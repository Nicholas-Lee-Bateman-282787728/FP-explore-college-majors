4117117,5,B003F1WA7C,"Harry Brown, played brilliantly by Michael Caine, is a pensioner and ex-marine living on a run down housing estate somewhere in the east end of London, who can't take the shortest route to visit his ailing wife in hospital because it involves passing through an underground walkway frequented by louts in `hoodies' and their girlfriends. His wife no longer recognizes his presence and his one remaining solace is playing chess with long-term friend and near neighbour Len.

One day, in their local - the venue for their chess games - Len reveals to Harry how he is being terrorised by local yobs and how much he lives in fear. Harry advises him to go to the police but Len decides to take matters into his own hands, with a predictable result. From this moment on a series of tragic and horrifying incidents convinces Harry that, if the police appear powerless, `natural' justice demands payment and he sets about making it happen.

This is a brilliantly realized depiction of the hell in which some people are forced to try to live out their lives; particularly, the ill, the lonely and the elderly. The film plays, obviously, on the prejudices of those watchers who have lived under similar circumstances. It makes no excuse for the excess of violence and does not seek to justify the social and economic deprivation that might explain it but it definitely is an accurate reflection of some aspects of urban life on some run down housing estates: it's not a documentary or social commentary, just a good old-fashioned piece of brilliant British film making showcasing the extraordinary abilities of a range of home-grown acting talents (witness the two druggy gun dealers!) including the national treasure that is Michael Caine.",1280707200,36,1730,4.921232876712328
4117118,4,B003F1WA7C,"Sir Michael Caine is always a pleasure to watch. He's one of those actors who seems to effortlessly bring a touch of class and sophistication to every role he plays. Here, Caine is the titular Harry Brown, a pensioner (retiree in US), widower, and Royal Marine veteran complacent with the violence he sees going on outside his window that is so commonplace. The residents are terrorized by violent gangs of teenagers and drug dealers. When his best friend Len (David Bradley, the caretaker of Harry Potter fame) is murdered by the gangsters, Harry is pushed over the edge and buys a gun. Angered and grief-stricken, he sets out to find the identity of the killers and avenge the death of his friend.

Harry Brown is essentially a revenge film. It is well-produced and well-filmed with some fantastic shots of the ugly underbelly of south London, particularly the ""sink estate"" where Harry lives, Britain's version of public housing projects. I can appreciate the film for its realistic portrayal of the frightening living conditions in London's socially and economically under-privileged areas. This is definitely not the quaint and idyllic England many Americans are used to seeing on film. It reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Street-Hooligans/dp/B000FBNG1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Street Hooligans</a>&nbsp;in its depiction of the subculture of violence and hooliganism.

The story itself, however, is a very conventional and straight-forward portrayal of inner-city violence. The issues are very black and white, with the youth shown as unrepentant thugs with no redeeming characteristics, so it's easy to see them get offed. The film doesn't ask any questions about justice or the nature of right and wrong, and breaks no new ground as far as storytelling goes, but it is definitely watchable owing to Michael Caine's strong performance. Without him, I doubt the film would've been as interesting. I found the escalation of violence and collapse into civil unrest towards the end a bit over the top and unconvincing.

Worth a look if you're a Michael Caine fan or like urban crime thrillers.",1276992000,6,2166,5.459701492537313
4117119,4,B003F1WA7C,"London, The Present: Elderly pensioner Harry Brown lives a largely solitary existence on a sinkhole council housing estate in London where drug dealing and recreational violence are the norm and disaffected hoodie-wearing teenage criminals (or ""chavs"" as we call them in the UK - a word derived from the acronym of ""Council Housed And Violent"") treat the ugly concrete canyons as a combination of a playground and the gladiatorial arena. Harry, despite a once prestigious career in the Royal Marines, is an affable, peaceful man who keeps himself to himself; literally going out of his way to avoid confrontation on a daily basis. But when a tragic series of events results in the death of one of his dearest friends, Harry finds himself inexorably drawn onto a collision course with the violent criminal elements that have terrorized the estate.

Harry Brown is not a perfect film, but it is an important one. It's probably the only film that realistically deals with the reality of the plight of the elderly and vulnerable at the hands of what has now become an epidemic of casual violent criminality in the UK. Make no bones about it, the England that you see in this film is far closer to the reality of living in a major British city than the Richard Curtisesque fluff-pieces (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Love-Actually-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Love Actually (Widescreen Edition)</a>) that are exported abroad in the hope of drumming up UK tourism. The failure of successive post-war UK governments to deal with an ailing education and law enforcement system has led to the reassertion of almost Dickensian levels of violence, poverty and hopelessness, and, as a British expat now living in Australia, I experienced an old familiar sinking feeling as I observed the frighteningly well-realised portrait of an increasingly dystopian Britain. Take it from one who knows - this is as real as it gets.

The tone of the film itself is an odd mixture of the jarringly realistic and the satirically surreal: the scenes depicting the recreational thuggery of the chavs are frighteningly on-the-money, while the scenes with the buttoned-down, pathologically polite and well-spoken police chief appear to be satirical jabs at authority's completely inability to cope with the escalating social problems of modern Britain. The tone of the film is somewhere between the work of Ken Loach,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Wish/dp/0449022684/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Wish</a>&nbsp;(indeed, this film is far more in keeping with the spirit of Brian Garfield's novel than the original Bronson vehicle) and Kubrick's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Clockwork-Orange-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000UJ48T0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Clockwork Orange (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

The acting is divided into two camps: Caine has never given a finer performance and the character's mordant sense of quiet sadness and desperation is palpable from the moment that we first see him open his eyes after a restless night. Brown, despite his eventual descent into violence, is never anything but a victim and Caine really does deserve an Oscar for his beautifully judged turn as an Emphysemic everyman caught between a rock and a hard place. Similarly, plaudits must go to the young actors playing the teen criminals, as well as massively underrated UK actor, Sean Harris, for his brief, scene-stealing cameo as an emaciated, homicidal, heroin addict who inhabits a hovel that far surpasses the worst fever dreams of De Quincey. By way of juxtaposition however, Emily Mortimer's performance as a police woman attempting to get to the bottom of the violence dogging the film's sinkhole estate is something of a damp squib. It could be that this is another satirical jab at the ""touchy feely"" modern metropolitan police force on the part of the director though.

Harry Brown is a film that will divide audiences. I observed an old chap, who sat near me in the cinema, informing the girl at the refreshment kiosk that ""the world needs more men like Harry Brown""; Several seconds later, a young, coiffured film studies student who had also been in the screening, and who was clearly acquainted with the same kiosk girl, informed her that ""it was a load of simplistic crap"". There are many people who will be of the latter opinion and yet more who will write it off as nothing more than a right-wing vigilante wet-dream. Then again, most of the liberal intelligentsia who have already espoused the latter opinion have never had to live in a place where the police turn up mob-handed or not at all. For those of us who have walked a mile in Harry's shoes though, regardless of our opinions on vigilantism, it is not a film that is so easily dismissed.",1276646400,200,4920,5.469736842105263
4117120,4,B003F1WA7C,"Harry Brown stars Michael Caine as Harry and his performance is well done perfection of character.  Harry is about 80 years old and a former Marine, which he does not talk about much.  He put away all his medals and former fighter life when he met and married his wife of many years.  The beginning scenes show Harry as he handles his wife's death and misses her sleeping next to him on an empty pillow.  He is a widower with just one friend, Leonard.  Harry and Leonard play chess together and both are witness to much violence on the street due to drugs and teenage delinquents without  positive supervision from local law enforcement.  They are allowed to get away with any number of crimes without punishment.  Harry watches attacks from his window but stays out of getting involved.  Every day he sees them congregate under a near-by bridge on his walk to a local pub.

Harry has emphysema, is way past his prime and physically out of shape.  He is old, wise and does not want to go back to his Marine ways.  He wants to stay apathetic and does not care anymore if he lives or dies.  The tipping point in Harry's old age comes when he learns that his only friend Leonard is killed by a gang of young punks.  Harry digs deep into his past and his mental and physical prowess learned in the Marines.  He becomes vigilante justice for the weak and old as he becomes the Clint Eastwood/Charlie Bronson character that takes on what the Police ignore or refuse to confront.

The film ends as the Police finally attack the growing, festering gang problem and the stooped, determined Harry delivers his best to save two detectives caught in the fray.

The movie is a riveting thriller, stylishly filmed in dark brooding hues.",1275955200,6,1722,4.55700325732899
4117121,3,B003F1WA7C,"A vigilante film of only medium level quality, despite the presence of the renowned and impressive Michael Caine. Actually, Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood have done this type of role in  much more effective ways in the past. Nonetheless, the theme of justified revenge is always an appealing one (even to those who won't admit it), and there is enough entertainment value in this film to warrant it's purchase (when it comes out on Region I DVD).  The presence of very scary looking amoral criminals definitely gives added value.",1275436800,2,533,4.977528089887641
4117122,5,B003F1WA7C,"We live in an apparently, increasingly violent world. A world of uncertainty. And fear. Academy Award nominee Daniel Barber's first full-lenght feature film, ""Harry Brown"", was quietly released in England in 2009. It's already available as a Region 2 DVD. Now, in May 2010, it has been released to the American art theaters. And just now, it's being shown in the first-run theaters. Did we miss something the first time around? Harry Brown(Michael Caine) is an elderly shut-in, doomed to a lonely, desolate public housing tenement(referred to as ""the estate"") in outer London. His wife is slowly slipping away, in a coma, in a nearby hospital. Harry spends his days playing chess in the pub with best friend Leonard(David Bradley). They sip beers and chat about the past. Harry was once in the Royal Marines, stationed in Ireland. Leonard asks him: ""Harry, did you ever kill a man?"". Harry's face turns dark. ""I don't talk about that..""he mutters. One rainy night Harry gets a call. His wife is dying. He rushes out to have one more minute with the woman he loves. He could take a short-cut through the Underground tube exit, but it's crowded with noisy, dark youths, chanting curses and selling drugs. So Harry goes the long way, and arrives too late to spend even a moment with his beloved. He sobs like a baby. Leonard comes to visit. He's frightened. The youth-gang has threatened him. ""Why don't you go to the police?"" says Harry. Leonard says: ""I already have.."". Just shortly, two overburdend detectives(Frampton and Kickok) knock on the door. ""We're sorry to inform you.."". Harry's friend Leonard has been brutally murdered. Much later, Harry will watch the killing, as it was filmed on a Blackberry phone-video. Harry, the former Royal Marine, has had enough. Watching the gang, Harry approaches them, asking for a transaction. Led to their disturbing, murky lair, he aks to buy a gun from them. They ask ""What for?"". Harry says: ""I want to shoot the pidgeons off the roof"". Out comes a Smith-and-Wesson 38, a Gluck 9mm, and a 45 automatic. This begins Harry's almost epic quest. The quest of a vigilante seeking justice the police are unable to provide. Somewhere between ""Death Wish"" and Eastwood's excellent ""Gran Torino"", ""Harry Brown"" swats the multi-headed beasts of abandoned old-age, loneliness, drug addiction, police incompetence, and revenge. Michale Caine is quite good. Rated ""R"" for violence(at least), ""Harry Brown"" offers several chilling scens of Broken Britian's viscious youth underground. Despite a tiny budget, Barber displays a knack for cinema realism. It's real. Very real. 77-year-old Michael Caine owns seven restaurants(six in London). Caine is currently in pre-production on ""Batman"" 3, due in 2012. It is untitled.",1274486400,8,2752,5.09070796460177
4117123,4,B003F1WA7C,"I am uncomfortable with myself for liking this Gran Torino Inglese. Of course there is more Death Wish than Gran Torino here: Harry has nothing to defend, he is just going for plain revenge. He goes out waiting for the attack and the opportunity to strike back. And yet, Michael Caine's Harry Brown can't help making me think of Clint Eastwood as old man vs the bad guys.
A difference: Clint's bad guys are civilized citizens in comparison to Harry's. While Clint's Kowalski lives in a friendly suburb, Caine's old man lives in a hellish settlement, where the underworld has taken over the streets and tunnels and corridors, where the police (poor mousy Mortimer) are afraid of the thugs. If the world is as this film shows it, we are in deep trouble. I don't really know, for lack of factual knowledge, whether this is truth or apocalyptic vision (think of The Road as end stadium of the process).
Harry/Caine is a former marine (what do the Brits call theirs?) who watched the mayhem in his neighborhood with mildish astonishment until his wife has died and his only friend gets killed by the thugs. When he has nothing any more to lose he starts hitting back. The story has no mysteries, but there is suspense, and we can't help rooting for the hero. I wonder if it is wrong. I am sure someone will tell me.
The other possibilty is that this picture of the world is grossly exaggerated and that the film is therefore a reactionary anti-social piece of garbage. I don't know.",1274400000,2,1477,4.598484848484849

things are just as messed up in jolly old England as in the USA. It is funny that

4117125,4,B003F1WA7C,"Harry Brown is more ""The Crow"" than ""Death Wish"", as his vigilante behavior is mostly motivated by revenge.  Whereas the Bronson film explores a man fed up with criminals in general, Harry's anger is largely focused on those connected to his friend's death.  Another similarity is a subplot involving Emily Mortimer (Redbelt) as an investigator who suspects Brown is more than just a bystander to the killings.

The film slowly heats to a boil until its halfway mark, when it begins to explore very gritty and violent situations.  From the moment Harry attempts to buy his first gun, the movie pulls you in and never lets go.  The film offers a few minor twists, and though the story isn't especially original, a terrific performance by Michael Caine easily carries it the distance.

The cinematography is great, and the soundtrack is very stark and haunting most of the time.  My only real complaint is that the use of CGI for certain scenes of violence was unnecessary.

The only reason I'm giving Harry Brown four stars instead of five, is that the concept isn't very original.  But it's still a very interesting look at a man who has reached his tipping point, played by an excellent veteran actor.  This is a film worth watching for Caine's performance alone.",1271980800,50,1264,4.810185185185185

4117148,5,B003F1WA7C,"I saw this at a friend's house and am now looking to buy my own copy.

FIRST UP: Question for my fellow Amazoner-s - I couldn't see a Questions section for the movie - DOES THE US BLU RAY COME WITH AN ULTRAVIOLET COPY?

For the movie I thought it was outstanding. Having grown up in the UK, although thankfully not on Harry's council estate, I really appreciated the gritty, real story nature of this movie. This movie is for me, the antithesis of the pretty, handsome and polished (AND EXPENSIVE) that often comes out of Hollywood - or maybe it's that the high spending consumers don't like unpleasant, ugly & inconvenient. By contrast this movie needs the characters to be dirty, squalid, ugly, mean, violent, frightened, selfish, dangerous, hard as nails, edgy & unpredictable.

The line - ""you have failed to maintain your weapon, Son"" is by the way fantastic. Anyone in or ex-mil will recognise that line - it's not a gun, it's not rifle, it is your weapon - so address it as such.

Getting back to the movie, the situation - the loss of law and order in built up inner city housing estates is believable. High rise flats that were for their '60s architects a utopian vision of social interaction and answer for the need for more, lower cost post war housing turned out to be something much much different. Rightly or wrongly, vandalism, mugging, drugs, riots all became synonymous with high rise / council estates (yep I know I bridged to low rise there) and it's that end that the story is set in, so don't tell me this story isn't believable - the setting is wholly believable, and the vigilante aspect, especially the countering views of some that it's a crime vs other that say Harry's doing the community a favour is absolutely believable. What would be your stance?

Some things change, some things stay the same. Today those flats are being flattened in the UK because we've realised that miscalculation and the cost of policing, cost of community. For Sir Michael Caine, he remains top notch. His character here somewhat reminds me of Get Carter&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Get-Carter-1971-BD-Blu-ray/dp/B00HGBAG5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Get Carter (1971) (BD) [Blu-ray</a>]- the '71 original, which also had grit and raw purpose - not the convenient tripe we often see today, but something that had a good story and real insight and emotion. I've enjoyed many of his movies. Loved him as an arrogant pr!@k in Zulu. Hated the character he portrayed as Alfie - but then again, you were meant to... then pity him. He's good stuff that Sir Michaal - a ""British Treasure"" and he's had some great movies to act in. Harry Brown is one of them.

Should say that it's not just about the actor, it's about the story, the situation, the dialog and setting - thinking about it, this is probably why I enjoyed Gran Turino&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gran-Torino-Blu-ray/dp/B015S4DS1K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gran Torino (Blu-ray)</a>&nbsp;so much - almost a US parallel. Excellent movie that too and surprise, surprise, am a fan of Dirty Harry movies and Clint (except when he did that Republican conference sketch - he's better than that - those weren't real Republicans and they don't deserve his endorsement - he needs to team up with real people of character and start a real party for real people - McCain, Bernie, Clint - get it going please - you heard me). Would call him a US Treasure if I may!

Finally if I might make a recommendation on a similar theme, I saw another ""gritty"" movie from the UK called ""The Veteran""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Veteran/dp/B009CF6EN6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Veteran</a>. Reminded me of the setting for Harry Brown. Much more violent, much more continuos flow and much more about action, but I would also recommend that film. Especially if you want to see the kind of environment, people less fortunate than yourself might live in, and to feel the fear and hopelessness that those environments can instill in good people.

I'll still watch ""easy to consume, convenience of thought"" Hollywood romp movies for sure, but gritty movies like these, which challenge, have great acting and I suspect do it on a sixpence budget (love the underdog) are things I really appreciate, live for and hopefully will find more of. Not proud of high rises, but damn proud of British movies like Harry Brown and all the people that go into making those movies great.

4117158,3,B003F1WA7C,"Harry Brown
This artistic little British vigilante flick has a lot to recommend it.  A lot that is beyond watching another Michael Caine movie, which is always worth while.  (I think I'll order out some of his films I haven't seen for a few decades.  Still good I bet.)  The story involves an old dude living out his last years in one of those Stalinist housing projects in England where poor people are tucked away, given some money to live on and asked by society to do nothing productive.  Naturally this hasn't worked out very well.  In this tale the local gang hangs out in a pedestrian tunnel that goes under a big highway.  A natural choke point where predators can lurk and sell forbidden goods and victimizing the helpless.  Well, Harry Brown-who looks about 80, is an ex Royal Marine and he has had enough, thank you so very much.  The brutal criminals are much hardier that the pensioner but he has a wily nature and years of battling the cunning gunmen of the IRA behind him.
 Script writer Gary Young has a half dozen screen plays in the stack, none of which became famous.  While not brilliant his effort here is serviceable.  He gives his characters interesting things to say, which in many cases is all we can ask.
 First time feature director Daniel Barber also turns in a workman like effort with no flash to distract but also with no ah-ha moments to knock us out.  Perhaps his best scene has rioters and police going at it in a colorful way.  Barber has an Oscar nomination to his credit for a short film.
 The actors make this little film worth our time.  Michael Caine in the lead as the elderly Harry Brown of course turns in his usual superior performance.  We also have a strong back up group of very skilled and experienced English actors.  Emily Mortimer plays the police detective inspector who is the only copper clever enough to divine the truth about Harry.  She has appeared in many famous films and plays a restrained English police woman, polite, determined and hemmed in by the cumbersome bureaucracy of her department.  Iain Glen, now famous from his role in Game of Thrones, plays her clueless superior.  Also famous as the Onion Knight in Game of Thrones is Irish born Lian Cunningham who as a small but important role.  Sean Harris is simply brilliant as one of the many villains.  He is an actor of skill and intensity who throws himself head on into the few minutes he has on screen.  David Bradley, another English actor, has some 120 credits, and brings his experience to the role of Leonard, Harry Brown's friend, perhaps his only friend.  We do not see any others.
 This average, artistic, gritty little film is worth out time.  Made on a tiny $7.3 million budget the one hour and 43 minute film brought in a sup par $10.3 million at the box office.  It is better than that and I hope the producers made up the money in DVD and TV sales.  2009.",1484956800,,2889,4.510597302504817

4117206,4,B003F1WA7C,"When an actor has had a career that spans six decades and includes hundreds of films, it's hard to choose a defining role. Even if you can choose just one performance, it's usual from way back when they were in their prime, but at seventy-six years old, Michael Caine proves that some things are just better with age. Caine is portraying Harry Brown, an lonely old man, who has recently lost his wife. All Brown has left is his best friend and a tiny apartment, but that changes when a group of thugs start reeking havoc on the neighborhood and slaughter his best friend. After that, something in Brown just snaps, and he turns to skills he learned in the army a lifetime ago. This isn't a film about some over the hill action star in the CIA, there is no weird twist, or strange background associated with Harry Brown. He is just a real person, dealing with a situation that people have to face every day in lower income neighborhoods. The gangs have taken over and no one is safe, especially the elderly, and that is very apparent in this film. Harry Brown is an action thriller, but it is also one of the realist movies I have ever seen. Every thing from the gangs activity to the way Harry goes about is life is as real as it gets, and it is truly frighting. Michael Caine stars and he doesn't have the moves, temperament, or even style of your typical action hero, yet somehow he's better than all of them combined. For Caine it's never been about brawn, it's about brains, and that's what he uses against a gang that's a third of his age. Critics raved about this film, while I avoided it, because I honestly couldn't see Michael Caine cleaning up his neighborhood and taking out thugs at his age. I was wrong, because Harry Brown is one of the best performances of his career. This film is just so realistic and clever, I never would have expected it to be the amazing experience that it was. This film really got to me and it includes one of the best performances I've ever seen. Harry Brown is a true gem of independent cinema, it is free of any Hollywood b.s., and it is the reason people still go to the movies. Please take my advice and don't miss this one.",1434326400,,2169,4.371287128712871

We do expect the officious department head and the dangerously erratic drug addict, both here very well acted.  In addition, at the end of most contemporary films we don't expect to see such complete credits; in this case taking over 6 minutes to run.  All of these things show the fine attention to detail of this movie.  The female D.I is dangerously unthinking, and her proposed reassignment to identity theft detail seems like a reasonable decision. Michael Caine does his usual magnificent job playing the very believable estate vigilante; in an estate so like the one in which the actor grew up.

Caine's character is  trapped in a reality that he and most of the other people in the community don't deserve.  British communities have a different type of ghetto than the States, a ghetto more racially diverse, but in some ways more frustratingly oppressive. The director of the film just doesn't get it.

4117264,2,B003F1WA7C,"The worst kind of bad movie is the kind that is well-made -- cast with a sympathetic star, and with good cinematography and ""production values.""  ""Harry Brown"" is such a movie.  Who doesn't like Michael Caine playing a sensitive, sympathetic geezer, and with emphysema no less?  But this movie is false at the core.  For one thing, Harry's actions, for a man in his condition and at his age, are totally improbable -- unless we're to believe that adrenalin can work wonders on people who have trouble breathing!  But the whole point of this movie is to play on our feelings and make us approve the violent vigilante action of this geezer.  To make this even remotely acceptable, the bad guys have to be totally demonized, and so we have here a druggy gang of youths portrayed as if they're denizens of one of the lower circles of hell.  They are, in a word, monstrous, and their look, their clothing, their haunts, their language all point to that monstrosity.  And who doesn't want to get rid of monsters? So . . . go Harry!!  Further efforts to make all Harry's violence acceptable include the portrayal of the police as worthless.  The nice ones come across more as social workers than police, and the police bureaucracy, symbolized here in a caricature of Superintendent, played by Iain Glen ( a fine actor here wasted), is portrayed as clueless.  The attack by the police on the druggies, complete with riot gear and shields, ends with a rout of the police that seems just a convenient backdrop for Harry's final heroics.  And in the final scenes, there is a revelation about a hitherto minor character that seems motivated only to put Harry in a last tight spot to get out of.  And sympathetic as Harry is (because we see him mourning his wife and his friend soulfully), we never get a sense of any moral cost to him of this violence -- a violence he deliberately foreswore when he left the Royal Marines to marry, many years earlier.  Nice to see, though, that after fifty years or so, he hasn't lost his touch with a gun!  The makers of this movie must surely know that the problems of social breakdown (never addressed or acknowledged here) aren't going to be solved by brutal and silly police tactics OR brutal and silly vigilante tactics.  To think otherwise is a dangerous fantasy.",1384646400,2,2293,4.624691358024691
4117265,4,B003F1WA7C,"To call ""Harry Brown"" a ""revenge flick"" would be to do it a disservice. It does have shades of ""Death Wish"" and the original ""Taken,"" but it is something more. There are underlying threads on the vulnerability of the common man, the ruthlessness of aging, and the ravages that time can bring upon relationships, society, and your very soul.

Harry Brown (Michael Caine) is a recent widower. He eats alone, takes walks alone, and lives alone in a ghetto called ""The Estate,"" in London. The only social contact he has is with his friend Len at the local dive pub where they play chess every afternoon. The city around the two elderly men is deteriorating. Gangs have formed around a framework of violence and drugs, and people even avoid walking through the local underpass for fear of what will happen in the dark. Len confides that he is terrified every moment and has decided to take a stand since the authorities will not. Harry cautions him but will not help. His memories of the violence of combat during World War II are too raw, and he cannot dare to dredge those feelings back up. When the police arrive at Harry's apartment to reveal the murder of poor Len, Harry feigns ignorance and begins to plan revenge upon those who would prey on decent people.

And here we have the setting for a stereotypical revenge movie and all it entails. To be sure, there is violence and there is revenge, but Michael Caine and director Daniel Barber bring into this genre a fresh take. There is frailty in our hero emotionally, as well as physically. He is not the usual model-handsome rogue with three-day stubble who is a ninja as well as a computer expert. Harry can't even work a cell phone. All he has is a numbing readiness borne of long nights in dark places during the war and a determination brought about by the rightness of his cause. Michael Caine is both brittle and weak, as well as awe inspiringly strong, as he and the world around him seem not only plausible, but relatable to anyone who has experienced fear when walking alone. Here is a character that speaks to our hearts and minds as we contemplate the thought of growing older and the sadness of past glories never to be reclaimed. The memories of friends lost and the long, lonely nights to come.

Sadly, this movie may not find much of an audience in America. It is too foreign, too stark, and not nearly fast paced enough for the usual action movie crowd. I have to admit that I only heard about it because I happened upon it on the shelves of new releases and was intrigued by simply seeing what Michael Caine would do with such a role. This is a good movie and it deserves an audience. If you have the chance and want to see a different take on a usually clich ridden genre, then give this one a go. You might be surprised at what you find.",1381708800,,2808,4.469785575048733

He is as you will see in this film how a pro expresses anger , agony , sorry, and remorse with subtle as well as intense gestures. You do not feel as if you are watching a film. Michael C. brings you in as participant in ,yes a violent film, in which we see a metamorphism from observer to executioner, who we support.
""But (officer) he told you of his attacks and you did nothing"" . Similar to GET CATER he takes the law or unwritten law into his own hands. AND WE SUPPORT this man . He makes us want to join him in his retaliation not for himself but for his friend and a helpless bystander mother
There is a scene where he is questioned by a detective while standing over a chess board. She says you have no one to play now. Here is where you see his absolute lonliness and pain in having his best friend lost to him . You really feel the loss and pain he is holding inside.
There have been other good films on vigilantism but you are a spectator . In Harry Brown Michael Caine invites us to share in this retaliation as a last resort. He kills one of the murderers and at the same time brings his overdosed girlfriend to safety. He is not irrational at all. He wants justice that cant be found.

Harry Brown (Michael Caine) and his friend Len Attwell (David Bradley) are sitting together in their local pub playing chess when Len admits to being terrified by the young hooligans on the estate - so terrified that he has armed himself with a knife. The teenagers openly deal in drugs, stolen merchandise and under-age prostitution. The police it seems are either powerless to intervene or, because of pressure of work, do not have the time to care. Then Len is murdered and sensitive D.I. Alice Frampton (Emily Mortimer) and gung-ho D.S. Terry Hicock (Charlie Creed-Miles) call on Harry to give him the bad news - that brash and totally insensitive Hicock calls a `deathogram'. One of these thugs tries to mug Harry on his way home after Len's funeral, threatening him with a knife. But Harry has a bigger knife, and sticks it in the chest of the young thug. The complete lack of effectiveness in the police provokes Harry into following one of the gang to their lair on the pretext of buying a gun. When the gang members threaten him, he shoots them with one of their own guns. He takes down a few more thugs before collapsing. He is rushed to hospital, D.I. Frampton thinks he might be the vigilante they are looking for, but her superior office doesn't want to know and transfers Frampton to another division. When armed police eventually storm the estate, the operation turns into a full-scale riot, such as we have seen all too often in Britain. This is a British version of `Dirty Harry' and is very satisfying film in that good triumphs over evil - well acted by all the principals.",1374710400,,1710,4.722408026755853

The area is riddled with gang and drug crime and following the murder of his only friend he goes out to set things right. Caine's character is an ex-Royal marine and he uses his old military skills to deadly effect. It was interesting though to see how his age was shown to affect some of his reactions and stamina. He is no super-vigilante but he has a trick or two up his sleeve. The strongest element to the film is the bitter bleak portrayal of a housing estate gone to hell. A dull colour wash and jarring use of camera shots set the tone for a gritty, and as far as can be expected in a film, realistic portrayal of a part of society that is absolutely disengaged from anything decent. At times it is hard to follow the working-class dialogue and be warned that the street language here is completely unsanitised (those words always seem to be clear!). Also, the violence and depictions of the criminal underclass make for several very unsettling scenes. The resolution is a bit unlikely but then so is the basic storyline altogether.

HARRY BROWN is a well-acted, poignant, disturbing, brutal, and, in the end, strangely satisfying film. The no-frills but painstaking cinematography puts you right there in working class London, with some of the most chillingly real hoodlums I've ever seen on film.

4117286,4,B003F1WA7C,"Harry Brown is more ""The Crow"" than ""Death Wish"", as his vigilante behavior is mostly motivated by revenge. Whereas the Bronson film explores a man fed up with criminals in general, Harry's anger is largely focused on those connected to his friend's death. Another similarity is a subplot involving Emily Mortimer (Redbelt) as an investigator who suspects Brown is more than just a bystander to the killings.

The film slowly heats to a boil until its halfway mark, when it begins to explore very gritty and violent situations. From the moment Harry attempts to buy his first gun, the movie pulls you in and never lets go. The film offers a few minor twists, and though the story isn't especially original, a terrific performance by Michael Caine easily carries it the distance.

The cinematography is great, and the soundtrack is very stark and haunting most of the time. My only real complaint is that the use of CGI for certain scenes of violence was unnecessary.

The only reason I'm giving Harry Brown four stars instead of five, is that the concept isn't very original.

4117288,5,B003F1WA7C,"Michael Caine is Harry Brown.  He lives in a nasty council estate ruled by drug-dealing thugs.  For the moment, he has other things on his mind.  His beloved wife Kath is dying and it is questionable whether or not she is even aware of Harry's presence when he comes to visit her.  Kath doesn't make it through the first reel.

He has a single friend, Len, with whom he plays chess in a local, seedy pub.  The toughs are starting to confront Len, to harass him and humiliate him.  Harry tells him to go to the police.  Len's already been to the police; it's time to stand up.  He shows Harry his weapon--a bayonet that looks very nasty.  Unfortunately, Len is old and outnumbered.  Len doesn't make it out alive either.

A detective comes to visit Harry, to inform him of Len's death and to console him.  She looks at the photos in Harry's flat.  Harry is a former Marine.  Much-decorated.  He served in Northern Ireland.  Effectively.

Harry is confronted by a heroin-addled mugger who puts his knife point below Harry's eyes.  Suddenly the knife is in the mugger's chest.

Harry goes to a pair of drug dealers to buy a gun.  By the time he is finished he has three guns; the drug dealers are both dead; their marijuana farm is ablaze; a young girl that they have abused and exploited is taken to the hospital to recuperate.

The police are swanning around, acting as if they are going to take out the drug dealers on the council estate; the kindly detective (and her sergeant) are caught in the middle.  They're worried about an ex-Marine with a grudge and some heavy skills.  I'll leave the delicious ending to the viewer, who can probably see where this is going.

The film is very gritty, with ugly, explicit sex and violence.  This is a serious revenge story and who better to carry it than Michael Caine?

The Bad, Plot twists although they are hinted at at the begining of the film they are almost given away as a twist near the end of the movie as cop out to add balance between Caine and the British punks so as not to have him totally dominate the little brats.

4117298,4,B003F1WA7C,"Michael Cain makes this film, one of a handfull in the ""Vigilante Genre"", effective and hard-hitting.  He's the semi-elderly man with the tough background of a British Soldier, who decides not to be a victim and fights back against the young criminal gangs in his neighborhood.  I recommend watching this film in comparison with the other vigilante movies, notably ""Death Wish"", ""The Brave One"", ""Gran Torino"", and ""Dirty Harry"".  They all strike an emotional nerve and offer the viewer a safe way to vicariously experience the dubious yet definite ""thrill"" of fighting back against the criminal Barbarians of slowly-decaying modern Western societies.

Americans who think that large British cities like London are quaint and safe, had their naivete rudely broken by the 2011 riots.  In reality, even before the riots, violent non-fatal crimes like assault, beatings, stabbings, robbery and rape are MUCH more prevalent in London, statistically, than in most American cities!  (Although homicide is more common in America, but homicide is very low-rate in either country compared to other crimes.) And with the lawful British citizens legally disarmed and hand-cuffed, there is little recourse for them against ceding control of rough urban streets to the abusive criminal element.  ""Harry Brown"" gives us a pre-riot glimpse of this modern onslaught of criminality into Britain, and the dysfunctional & ineffective way in which the police have grappled with it.  You really get a feeling of helplessness as Harry's elderly friend is murdered and the authorities wring their hands.  You feel like society all around Harry is becoming more barbaric and uncivilized, until he finally snaps, gets his hands on some illegal handguns, and starts his kick-ass counter-assault.  Harry's first experience is a startling defense from a mugging (no guns involved), and his next encounter, where he gets into it with decadent, gun-selling drug dealers, is admittedly disturbly violent.  Then he goes after the local gang members and underworld types, a really despicable lot.

Of course the movie is unrealistic in some ways because (1) Harry gets away with most of his vigilante acts  (In reality, look at the cases of Bernard Goetz in New York and the recent T. Martin case in Florida); and (2) Harry is an old guy and he seems to come on like a much younger kind of superman.  But it does get you hooked and you wonder what miscreant Harry is going to plug next with his illegally-obtained firearms and soldier's training.  Michael Cain does pull this old-man tough-guy act off admirably (like Eastwood in Gran Torino).

What is prescient about this movie is that it shows violence and even riots happening and the London police strangely non-reactive and ineffectual.  It's like they have the directive from above, to be utter wimps.  This is disturbing to watch, and THEN you realize that this basically happened in the 2011 riots.  YouTube clips from the real unrest showed the rioters running wild, looting & attacking police, and the local cops backing off, showing ridiculous restraint, and losing the streets to the thugs.  This was shown in the movie before it actually happened!  Probably the movie-makers knew the inside scoop about the ineffectiveness of the London cops.  Well, Britain needed about 100 Harry Browns during those riots, and you would have had a lot of dead thugs but the riots would have tamped down quite a LOT sooner than they did.  Of course, most of the 2011 rioters were black, and while this movie de-emphasizes the racial aspect of London crime, but you should give the movie-makers an out on this because they have to make films within the politically-correct boundaries that the liberal media establishment sets out for them.

Overall I thought that Harry Brown was well directed/acted, ""realistic"" in most ways, and has quite the surprise ending when the viewer doesn't know if old butt-kicker Harry will live or die.  Once again, I recommend you watch it (and compare it with its American counterparts), to experience the thrill/agony of the vigilante mentality played out in ordinary citizens, who are fed up with being victims and start fighting back.",1333670400,,4183,5.1071953010279
4117299,3,B003F1WA7C,"The story starts out sweet and gets really, really nasty. Caine is fascinating throughout as usual.  The script however is somewhat implausible to Harry's advantage as his activities are completely ""overlooked"" by the police.  In reality neglecting to investigate Harry further is not very likely at all. Some will find the graphic scenes midway and near the end of the film extremely tense if not downright nerve-wracking.  This film shows the dirty underbelly of the UK big city drug culture, which really isn't all that different from any other big city drug culture today.  The morale of the story is never ever mess with a Marine, no matter how old they are.  Some compare this to ""Gran Torino"" and found it inferior, but I liked ""Harry Brown"" much better. Unlike ""Torino"" this film has more of a Film-Noir genre feel, pace and plot.  Good casting, excellent direction and lighting even if it has a slightly flawed storyline.  Sometimes the sound needed tweaking to understand the semi-mumbled dialog which should have been re-recorded or doctored in post production.  This was a reasonably large budget film and while it looked professional enough, the audio needed some work which is all that kept me from giving it 4 stars.",1331856000,,1231,4.941747572815534

He just dominates the scenes when he's on screen. Not only is he a terrific actor but he's smart enough to take roles that are in keeping with his advancing years.

The setting is a London housing estate where hoodies rule, and there are some paths or pedestrian underpasses that you just avoid.  Michael Caine is a retired marine, living out his latter years quietly.  However a series of events brings him head to head with the hoodies, and the tough soldier turns out to be not so far under the surface as it at first seemed.
It's not an unfamiliar sort of vigilante type story, but it works for two reasons - one, the housing estate is so well portrayed it seems real, and even if you don't live in an area quite as bleak as this one, there are elements of the familiar which make it seem vivid and authentic.  Secondly, Caine's performance is not showy, but works a treat.  He manages to portray a character who is simultaneously frail and elderly and yet able to mete out acts of violence where he feels required to do so.  He convinces us that the man we meet with that familiar voice, who is evidently a compassionate human being loyal to his friends, can also become cold hearted to those he comes in to confrontation with.  Some minor plaudits to for Emily Mortimer who is the sympathetic policewoman investigating the surge in violence.
Certainly decay seems to be a theme the filmmaker is keen to explore.. Decay is all around us in this movie- decayed health, decayed human beings, decayed souls, as well as the more obvious decayed housing estate.  However, it could be argued in places the decay goes just a bit too far - the scene where Caine goes in search of a gun is unsettingly grimy and unpleasant, and while one of the least watchable scenes in the movie, does not entirely progress the ideas of the movie forward much, except as a stepping stone in Caine's character rediscovering his more youthful self capable of violence.  Also, there are some glaring holes in the plot filled with contrivances it is hard to forgive.. the way the characters come together at the end is just hard to fathom, and smacks of the screenwriter running out of ideas, and how DID he find the seller of guns so easily if he kept to himself so much?
Having said that, for a first time director this is an assured piece of work, and in setting out the stall with slow scenes which place character development over easy action beats, benefits enormously by making us care for the characters.  Gains an extra * for Caine's unshowy performance.",1329264000,,2649,4.879732739420936

Unfortunately this movie did not get it's due here in the states.

4117306,5,B003F1WA7C,"I watched this film the other night and greatly enjoyed it despite the rather depressing plot.  Michael Caine is absolutely brilliant as the senior citizen, Harry Brown.  He lives a fairly solitary existence.  His wife lies in a hospital in a coma and he has one good friend, another senior citizen with whom he plays chess.  Within a short period of time, both are taken away from him: his wife of natural causes and his friend murdered by the drug-dealing and drug-taking hoodlums who have taken over the area in which he lives.  These individuals murder, steal and destroy with absolutely no fear.  The police must play within the rules and are powerless against them.  Only one young female cop, Emily Mortimer, even seems to care about the victims of these marauders.  However, the slime that murder Harry's friend make one mistake: they don't realize that Harry is a highly decorated Royal ex-marine. From then on, the film is slightly similar to Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish.""  The violence builds to a very satisfactory conclusion.
Caine is brilliant, his character suffers from emphysema and you can see the physical toll his vigilantism is taking on him.  Mortimer is excellent as well, a perpetual look of sadness on her face from what she must confront daily.  The hoodlums are the slimiest bunch of creeps I have seen in a long time, they are truly disgusting.  This film became even more relevant after the rioting a few months ago in London.  Many of those individuals looked highly similar to the creeps in this film.  My bus would pass by the Occupy Wall Street bunch camped out in Zuccoti Park in New York and many of that crowd looked similar to the individuals pictured in this film.
The picture and sound of the blu-ray are great: every gunshot or explosion would make me jump.  Other than commentaries the only extras are deleted scenes, most of which were absolutely excellent and probably should have been kept in the film.
In conclusion, this is an excellent film with a terrific performance by Michael Caine. (But really, how many bad performances has he given. Probably none.) I highly recommend it.",1322265600,2,2127,4.820936639118457

4117310,4,B003F1WA7C,"Revenge flicks have been around forever. This one pretty much has to be compared with Charles Bronson's ""Death Wish"", but here you have a much less sensational outing.

Michael Caine plays a pensioner living in some London projects. The neighborhood has pretty much gone to the dogs. Drug sellers and users have taken things over. He, and a good friend, are restricted in where they can go without fearing for their safety. His friend is killed by said thugs while trying to protect himself. Harry exacts revenge. Meanwhile two detectives investigate the various killings.

This is a much more somber movie than others in the genre. Yes. Harry was a marine, but he'd rather forget that part of his life. He was stationed in Northern Ireland and it seems he would rather forget the ugliness he experienced there. There is no macho posturing here. He just misses his recently deceased wife and wants to sit and have a game of chess with his friend while drinking a pint of ale. He's drawn into things unexpectedly. His first kill is almost an accident, but when he gets a taste for it he doesn't back away. He carries out his duties in near weary fashion. There is one set up later in the film that is a bit too ""Hollywood"" and it's a shame as it goes against the grain of the rest of the movie. Emily Mortimer and Charlie Creed-Miles play the detectives on the case. Both do a fine job. All who play the bad guys here are exceptional. One particular drug dealer will make your skin crawl. Just looking at him made me want to shower.

This film hits a lot of right notes. It has a good look. Much takes place at night and you do get a sense of menace about the neighborhood. You also get a good sense about the thugs. These aren't pumped up ""Hollywood"" thugs. These are just nasty little degenerates. I can't say I liked how the climax played out. I don't think the Mortimer character would have done what she did given how they set her up but it's still a good movie. It doesn't glamorize what Harry does, but you still like seeing his triumphs.

For a lot of people in the United States, seeing English cities burning and English shops smashed and looted was a shock, as we so often pay attention only for PBS shows and royal weddings.  But for many English, the reality of modern England is, frankly, stifling and dystopian.  This reality has been recorded before in books like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-at-the-Bottom-The-Worldview-That-Makes-the-Underclass/dp/1566635055/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes the Underclass</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Our-Culture-What-s-Left-of-It-The-Mandarins-and-the-Masses/dp/156663721X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Our Culture, What's Left of It: The Mandarins and the Masses</a>.  Now, with this film Harry Brown, we have a big screen dramatic portrayal of what life in modern England is like for the poor, the elderly, and the weak.  Retired ex-marine Harry Brown decides to clean up his neighborhood after the incompetent police fail to apprehend the gang members who murder his last remaining friend.

The film does a good job of showing us what lower-class England looks like, as the youths and urban landscape look very much like the news reports of the riots that have been coming out of England.  Michael Caine has an irrepressible screen presence, although as a person he remains as clueless as ever: just watch the commentary to confirm that, as he calls the gang members who were recruited to play in this film ""wonderful.""

Some people have complained that this is a ""right-wing fantasy"" film.  That's in the eye of the beholder.  For my part, it was refreshing to see a film that showed an old man being able to walk in peace again on his own property.  Also, it was nice to see a movie that didn't portray incivil ruffians and murderers as failed artists and social workers.  There have been other times in history when the poor didn't form a crimincal underclass.

Anyhow, in the future, hopefully this movie will be remembered as a silly retro action flick, like we think of the Dirty Harry movies.  But for now, it is a sobering but balancing view of English life in the 21st century.",1314921600,2,2496,5.63903743315508
4117313,4,B003F1WA7C,"HARRY BROWN is a low-budget, exploitative vigilante flick.  Films like DEATH WISH come to mind when searching for a comparison.  Yet a stellar, utterly convincing performance from the great Michael Caine makes this a must-see.

Caine is Brown, an elderly retiree living on an ""estate"" in England (an apartment complex we might call ""the projects"" here in the States.  He is a quiet man, who sees the gang violence and drug dealing all around him, but just hunkers down and ignores it.  He visits his dying wife in the hospital and plays chess with his one friend, Leonard (David Bradley, who you'll recognize as Filch from HARRY POTTER fame).  But, predictably, his wife dies and then Leonard is killed by the thugs Brown has been trying to ignore.

Brown quietly decides he needs to avenge his friend.  And what follows are several scenes of blunt, shocking violence.  An early encounter with two drug dealers who can sell him guns is chilling in its sordidness and ugliness.  This is not a feel-good movie...but there is the undeniable vicarious thrill of watching these sociopaths who are terrorizing everyone in their midst meet violent ends.

None of this would be remotely acceptable for a discerning film-goer, but the script by Gary Young is a bit above average (full of clichs, I grant you, but it gives its characters things to do and say that elevate them above cardboard caricatures).  And as I said, Caine gives it his all.

Caine continues to be a marvel.  He seems to take on any role that comes his way, and some of the movies he does are garbage (and it's been that way for many decades) and then some are pure gold.  He takes what he has and makes the best of it.  And then a well-done film comes along (late career examples are THE QUIET AMERICAN or CHILDREN OF MEN) and we remember, oh yes, Michael Caine is one heck of an actor.  And here's a guy who isn't spending time with the plastic surgeon.  He looks old and tired.  But when he starts on his mission, we see this old Harry Brown (years ago, he was a Royal Marine in Northern Ireland) begin to youth-en just a little, to get a modest spring in his step.  The performance Caine gives is fully-realized and subtle...but it's also fun to watch him just walking down a tunnel firing his gun at the head of a surprised drug-dealer.

I have to give credit to director Daniel Barber, at the helm of his first feature film.  He clearly knows how lucky he is to have Caine in his film and doesn't mind letting the camera just rest on Caine's face.  And as a viewer, not only did I love Caine as Brown...but my mind raced back to so many of his other great performances (HANNAH AND HER SISTERS, SLEUTH, even ALFIE) and I thought, ""as a film-lover, I'm so grateful that we've had Michael Caine for all these years.""  HARRY BROWN is great fun just on its own (even if the police are unrealistically bumbling and clueless), and I highly recommend it (for adults only...quite violent and seriously bad language).

Then there are the bad guys who are not just bad, but dope-growing, heroin-injecting, bystander-murdering, expletive-spewing, graffiti-spraying, gun-selling, girlfriend-prostituting bad. Harry Brown is a bit like Taken, another old-guy-takes-revenge film in which a respected actor adds needed gravitas to a production. But Harry Brown wants to gloss over its extravagances while Taken celebrates them elevating the film to a guilty pleasure. Still, you have to admire Harry Brown for its ambition, its acting and tonal richness even as you have to forgive its lugubrious moments for taking (a lot) more screen time than scenes of Michael Caine kicking ass.",1309219200,2,1018,5.5256410256410255

He remembers his Marine skills quite well but has just left them in his past up until the moment he is mugged on the way home. In the mugger's attempting to stab him, Harry just turns the knife on him instead and kills him.  This is only the beginning as his council estate is every bit as bad as Eastwood's inner city Detroit and Bronson's Central park after dark.  It is amazing in fact how similar London, Detroit and New York seem when one is living among its lower denizens.

Assuming you are up for a vigilante movie, this one again makes use of an excellent film actor at the helm to mount its reverse reign of terror.  Michael Caine is excellent as the vigilante. There is a video of his best friend being killed by the criminals of the estate so it is easy to compile a hit list.

One thing the hooligans of the council estate fail to factor into their criminal acts is that if one is taking drugs most of the time and also has never developed any skills in weaponry, it is feasible for an elderly,  former soldier to attack them.  He knows how to mount an attack.  All they know how to do is pull the trigger on a weapon with no particular skill in aiming it.  So even though they are perhaps fifty years younger, age is the only advantage they possess.

One caution: the movie is very violent so if that is not your kind of film, you don't want to see this.

4117318,4,B003F1WA7C,"In ""Harry Brown"" Michael Caine goes ""Death Wish."" He becomes a vigilante pensioner dispensing justice on a group of street punks responsible for the death of his best friend. The story itself may not be particularly original, but with a different location and twice-Oscar winner Michael Caine's riveting performance, ""Harry Brown"" is a better-than-average vigilante thriller.

The story revolves around an elderly former marine Harry Brown living alone in a South London housing estate, where a local gang terrorizes the residents. One day Harry's best friend Leonard (David Bradley) is found dead brutally murdered. First-time feature director Daniel Barber gives a twist or two to the familiar storyline, employing mobile phone camera images, but his narrative style overall is pretty orthodox, and the story stays mostly within the realm of plausibility.

Stories of vigilante movies take place under a certain set of rules. One of them is the police that represent the ineffectiveness of the laws. Emily Mortimer plays Alice Frampton, a detective inspector sympathetic to Harry. Alice's partner Sergeant Terry Hicock (Charlie Creed-Miles), not morally corrupt, still feels helpless. Iain Glen's superintendent is easily influenced by politics. There is nothing new here, though all characters are very well-acted.

The real driving force of ""Harry Brown"" is Michael Caine. He has created a credible character Harry Brown, an aged person who has no superhuman powers. Harry's military background serves him well, but not in the same way as John Rambo's.

I'm no prude, but the ""language"" used by the vile youth in this movie exceeds anything I've seen before and it's so harsh, and excessive, that it brings the film down. Add to that the current fad for dark, dank cinematography and gross realism and we get a real trainride into British Hell. If the state of the country is really as awful as this film depicts, I mourn for the English citizens. This movie has been compared to DEATH WISH, but compared to this, Charles Bronson had a walk in the sunshine.

4117323,4,B003F1WA7C,"If you follow British news and, in particular, the writings of Theodore Dalyrymple and other commentators, you know that Britain has major problems, particularly with youth crime.

 Of course, the social do-gooders control the establishment, so young violent offenders are basically not punished in any meaningful way.

 The victims of these young criminals include the aged who are least able to defend themselves. In fact, self-defense is now a crime in Britain.

 So here with have the 77 year old Michael Caine playing the part of Harry Brown. The movie opens with Harry about to lose his wife - and then his best and only friend is murdered by the young criminals on the housing estate. The young hoodlums know their rights and the police in the shape of Detective Inspector Alice Frampton (Emily Mortimer) are pretty much stymied.

 Harry Brown incorporates elements from ""The Unforgiven"" (the hidden violent past of the protagonist), ""Death Wish"" (the upright urban citizen who just isn't going to take it any more) and the more recent ""Gran Torino"" (the old guy who has nothing left to lose).

 Michael Caine carries the entire movie. He has a serviceable, if not first rate script and it is impossible to watch him without remembering the Michael Caine of old.

 The movie is predictable, wonderfully violent as the young toughs get what they deserve and leaves an open question about Detective Inspector Alice Frampton's intelligence.

 Overall, if you're not a goody two-shoes and enjoy a fantasy about what should happen to young street criminals, you'll like this.

But in casting one of the screen's finest actors, Michael Caine, as ""Harry Brown"", the film becomes more than a just a 'shoot-em-up' fantasy for frightened senior citizens, but a sad commentary on how ineffective law enforcement has become in a culture overwhelmed by street crime, as seen through the eyes of a tragic hero watching his world crumble.

Brown is a simple man, a British pensioner/ex-Marine who has just seen his wife pass away, after a long illness. Ritual helps him deal with the pain, how he dresses, how he cares for his home, and his regular trips to the local pub to see old friend, Leonard (David Bradley, who is terrific). Leonard is increasingly terrified, as his flat is regularly desecrated by punks, but Brown refuses to resort to violence to aid him...of course, Leonard decides to deal with the hoods, himself, and is brutally murdered. When Brown sees how hamstrung the police (represented by inspectors Emily Mortimer and Charlie Creed-Miles) are, in investigating the case, or in ridding the streets of obvious 'vermin', he decides to carry a gun to protect himself, and investigate Leonard's death, himself. Of course, a first act of self-defense leads to a decision to 'clean up' his neighborhood...and a brief but decisive career begins.

Caine's fundamental humanity shines through in every scene; unashamed to cry, his sense of loss and frustration is palpable, and unlike Bronson, he isn't some kind of middle-aged physical specimen, running and jumping like a 20-year-old, but an old man, racked by emphysema...yet, despite his pain, he takes an abused, drugged girl to a hospital, after shooting her pusher 'boyfriends'. Director Barber doesn't glorify vigilante tactics, or pretend Harry Brown is some kind of urban saviour; despite a chaotic, brutal, and kinetic climax, involving an entire police task force, an army of street hoods and innocents, the two inspectors, Harry, and a surprising 'puppetmaster' to the central crime, the resolution isn't 'happily ever after', tied up with a pretty ribbon; in the sad, dark, more realistic world of Harry Brown, only death is permanent.

4117328,3,B003F1WA7C,"When surrounded by evil and despair, sometimes the only way to set things right is to unleash the darkness within one's self. This is essentially the theme for the recently released, gritty revenge thriller ""Harry Brown"" starring screen legend Michael Caine.

""Harry Brown"" is the story of a former Marine and widower (Michael Caine) who has been content with living out his life in peace amidst the crime and decadence consuming his tenement. However, when his best friend is brutally murdered by a neighborhood gang, Harry decides that enough is enough. Calling upon his military training he begins his quest to discover who exactly was responsible for his friend's death and punish them accordingly.

Since the focus of the story is that of crime running rampant and an elderly former serviceman driven to vigilantism to stop it, one cannot help but draw an instant comparison to Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino"". Unfortunately, the inevitable comparison does not exactly work in this film's favor. While ""Harry Brown"" is an average movie, it sadly never attains the emotional depth and momentum that made Eastwood's film so great. This is a real shame, because the potential was definitely within this film's grasp.

The biggest problem with ""Harry Brown"" lies within the screenplay written by Gary Young. Throughout the entire film there are just too many missed opportunities for development (either for the characters or the emotional depth of the movie), inconsistencies within the story, and lulls where simply nothing of any consequence is occurring.

The missed opportunities are most recognizable in those scenes touching upon Harry's family or rather the lack thereof. He's a widower who was forced to watch helplessly as his wife slowly faded away. Obviously being his wife her death would leave a gaping hole in his life. However, I feel that the script could have taken some time to explore their relationship prior to her death so that the emotional impact of her passing wouldn't be reliant solely upon the obvious marital connection of the characters.

At the same time, there is a passing mention that he and his wife had a daughter who died at a surprisingly young age. The problem with this apparently minor plot point is that once it is introduced they never really speak of it again. Not that I want a child's death (fictional or otherwise) to be exploited in a movie, don't get me wrong. But, I do feel that the inclusion of this bit of history for Harry would have provided a little more emotional weight to the character, rather than being just another question mark from his past.

Then there's the inconsistencies found throughout the entire duration of this movie. These issues are glaringly obvious in regards to the various crimes the gang members cause and how widespread they may or may not be.

I mean, it's quite apparent that this gang has a stranglehold over the complex Harry lives in; however, he seems almost oblivious to any real threat existing from them. This blatant inconsistency becomes all too apparent when his friend Leonard is telling Harry of all the mistreatment and threats he has received at the hands of these hoodlums. Yet upon hearing the news, Harry seems surprised that things are that bad.

I just find it hard to believe that such a violent gang would be picky as to which tenants they choose to abuse. So Harry's lack of fear or knowledge of the gang seems unlikely, given the severity of the actions we are shown being perpetrated elsewhere in the complex. Admittedly he does express some slight trepidation when walking near the gang's primary place of business, but beyond those brief moments he shows no outward signs.

On top of those problems plaguing this film, there are the moments of boredom that creep in periodically. For instance, far too much time seemed to be spent on just showing Harry doing virtually nothing but sitting around his apartment or eating or something equally mundane. Granted, this was intended to show how lonely his lot in life had become, but I didn't feel that we needed to be reminded of this fact so many times. I'm not saying that there should have been more action sequences or something like that, but the story could have benefited from slightly more judicious cuts in the editing room to speed things up a bit.

However, not every aspect of the story was weak; the scenes focusing on Harry's vengeance were especially strong and compelling. During these moments every aspect of the movie seemed to be firing on all cylinders. I appreciated that the main character, which is well into his golden years, was allowed to show he could still dispense punishment, sometimes in an extremely violent manner, without losing any believability. For this achievement I feel that credit must be given to the film's first-time director, Daniel Barber. So many directors could or would have been tempted to go overboard with the violence to a point beyond the character's physical capabilities, but he chose to wisely show restraint and the film benefited from this greatly.

Another area in which the film really succeeded was in its casting. Front and center is veteran screen legend Michael Caine (""The Dark Knight"") as the titular character. Michael plays the role to perfection with a natural ease and grace, but also an underlying sense of authority and a quiet strength that demands your attention. He seamlessly blends together grandfatherly qualities one would expect from a man of his age, while at the same time unleashing a surprisingly grim and justifiably violent side that has remained dormant since his youth. It is this intriguing dichotomy at odds within his character that elevated this movie beyond its less-than-stellar screenplay.

Leading the supporting cast is actress Emily Mortimer (""Shutter Island"") as Detective Inspector Alice Frampton. Emily plays the straight-laced Alice with such conviction, smarts, and realism that she easily outshines her fellow actors portraying other members of the police force. Unfortunately due to how well fleshed-out her character is and the strength of her performance, all of the other police officers appear to be inept when it comes to their jobs. I'm sure this was not the impression the writer and director wished to convey regarding the police force, but it happened all the same and the film suffers for it.

Alongside Emily in a smaller, yet equally pivotal supporting role is actor David Bradley (""Harry Potter"" films) as Harry Brown's best friend, Leonard. Even though David is not given a whole lot of screen time, he does the most with what he has to make Leonard a memorable character. This proved vital given that Leonard's story arc is the crutch that the majority of the movie rests upon. I was somewhat frustrated by the fact that David wasn't allowed more time in the film because he is a good actor, but more importantly, his scenes opposite Michael Caine were some of the strongest in the movie. Oh well, I'm not the one calling the shots though.

In the end, it's a real shame that a movie like ""Harry Brown"" was hampered by this laundry list of issues, because the potential for an intense thriller was there. It's just that the writer and director failed to capitalize on all of the opportunities presented to them. Even so, the acting in the film is very strong, sometimes to the movie's detriment (in the case of Emily Mortimer) and the action is gritty and hard-hitting. While ""Harry Brown"" isn't the most well-written film you'll ever see, it is worth watching if for no other reason than Michael Caine's riveting performance.

Note: mild spoilers below.
--------------------------------
A slow, deliberate pace and relentless bleakness give this English vigilante/revenge drama its tone, while the masterful Michael Caine give it gravitas and heft. The portrait of urban blight in the UK and the modern-day embrace of hedonistic, mindless violence is chilling, although ultimately the film itself tilts towards the gratuitous and grotesque, undercutting the script's emotional impact and pulling viewers out of the story. It also feels as if, perhaps, a scene or two fell onto the editing room floor that might have made the ending seem less empty: Caine's confrontation with the local baddie, a barkeep who has helped turn his neighborhood into a hellish pit, didn't have the emotional impact that the director intended. It seems implied that this character, whose Irish accent suddenly comes to the fore, may have had a background in the IRA (which would tie in with the Caine character's military training as a royal marine who learned the ways of war while deployed in Northern Ireland) but the connection seems deliberately obscured, probably for political reasons. Also, we are meant to feel betrayed when this seemingly benign figure turns on Caine, but their friendly relationship is barely explored in the start of the film; the man hardly registers as a noteworthy character, so later when the film hits its violent climax, I found myself nonplussed by the revelation. I'm just guessing, but my hunch is that there was material that made these points more forcefully, which was mistakenly taken out in the final edit.  Oh, well.

Overall, this was an engaging, unsettling film with a melodramatic but probably not overly-inaccurate view of the moral and structural decay of in some British slums. Plus, you gotta love Michael Caine as a geezer with a gun.  I'd be scared of him! (Axton)",1286496000,,1923,5.257328990228013

LA, New York, Miami, London, and even some smaller cities ........  it seems we don't simply eradicate and eliminate people are are so criminal, so vile and so evil that they do not DESERVE to live.
They are nothing more than wastes of human flesh that offer NOTHING to their fellow man except pain and misery.

The film itself drags a bit for the first half (Like many British films) and actually spends almost too much time on plot development (a rare situation in modern film making)... but the last half picks up the pace and effectively delivers the intended social commentary and message.

4117334,3,B003F1WA7C,"There are two types of Britain in film/TV land: the anodyne version as portrayed in Love Actually and Doctor Who, and the squalid version as portrayed in Trainspotters and Harry Brown.

We're thrown into a world of mindless violence, in which teenage thugs wreak terror though possession of illegal handguns. This is the underclass of British life - dead-end lives eked out in dilapitated high-rise housing estates. Think Chicago projects or Parisian banlieue. This is a world in which the sub-human prey on the weak and the old.

This is, in short, a perfect setting for the old wild western hero, the man who stands alone against the bad guys with the odds against him. Harry Brown is a modern version of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns but in this case our anti-hero is a pensioner. And it's entirely appropriate therefore that this is basically an English version of Eastwood's valedictory Grand Torino. Caine's protagonist is more likable - and infinitely more vulnerable - than Eastwood's retired auto worker, and the acting is definitely in a class above, but the basic themes are the same. An old man takes on a teenage gang in order to make his little corner of this wide world a slightly better place.

As might be expected from a British script, there are nuances and subtleties totally absent from Eastwood's movie, but the violence is actually greater - and the more distressing for being so accurate, as when one of the gang urinates on the dying body of the old man they've just stabbed. Hollywood wouldn't tolerate such a scene - it might adversely impact popcorn and ice-cream sales to the audience.

If realism, brutality, and bleakness are your cup of tea then this is a much better movie than Hot Fuzz or Bruges. The script is tighter, the direction more compelling, and the acting is superior.

After an amazing career filled with memorable roles, this material doesn't begin to approach the top flight scripts that have passed through Michael Caine's hands: `Alfie', `The Cider House Rules' and `Dirty Rotten Scoundrel's' among them.  However, there are some memorable moments in `Harry Brown'.

In Harry Brown, we find Sir Michael as a pensioner tending to the remnant's of a troubled but hard won life. His ailing wife and pub mate Leonard gives purpose to Harry's existence that is surrounded by mayhem in the housing project were he resides. When his world suddenly turns upside down, Harry revisits a time in his life that he would have rather left alone.

Emily Mortimer, Charlie-Creed Miles and David Bradley are solid in support of world weary Caine set adrift in an ocean of decay. Daniel Barber directs in his first feature length release. He handles the silence of grief and crescendo of chaos rather well. In particular, he allows his actors to build substance into a scene instead of beating his audience over the head with action.  Time is insanely limited in a feature and Barber's willingness to invest it on the actors can pay big dividends in future efforts.

It is a treat to watch an actor of Caine's caliber witness a mesmerizing turn by a relatively unknown talent. It occurs later in the film when Caine drops in on local dealer/Junkie Stretch's world. `Stretch' (Sean Harris) will forever be included in the conversation when the upper echelon of movie creepdom is examined. Not since Gary Oldman's `Drexel Spivey' has idiosyncratic mania rained down so hard. If for no other reason, see `Harry Brown' because of it.",1284336000,,1659,4.92831541218638

Brown's best friend is terrified of the violent and drug dealing teenagers and twenty-somethings in his neighborhood.  These two facts eventually spur the plot into action, and a journey into the underbelly of England's dark side begins.

Caine's performance is subtle, which slows the pace of the film, but not in a bad way.  When Caine takes the time to develop his character, he allows the chance for excellent photography and cinematography.  This is indeed what occurs, and the dark atmosphere that emerges is alternately tragic and magically noir.

Harry Brown posits a rather conservative commentary on contemporary violence among teenagers and younger adults in England.  The film positions the last-resort violence of war as heroic and the casual violence of the inner city as a cowardly insult to an elderly generation of soldiers who are near the ends of their lives.  It's a philosophical stance on the use of violence that audiences may or may not agree with.

The least interesting aspect of the film is the obvious plot.  After the first ten or fifteen minutes, it's clear what is going to happen, who is going to live or die, etc.  It's the kind of plot generally reserved for Hollywood's fast-paced exploding movies.

4117338,5,B003F1WA7C,"American readers of this review may not be familiar with Callan, a British television show from the 1960's although they are probably familiar with the star and anti-hero of the show, Edward Woodward, of the Equalizer fame.

This film is so very reminiscent of a whole raft of British movies from the 1980s such as For Queen and Country starring a young Denzel Washington, My Beautiful Laundrette and Sammie and Rosie Get Laid, which all were filmed against a background of urban decay and unrest.

Harry Brown is shot against such a background which shows little, if any improvement since the 1980's. In fact recent reports on crime in the United Kingdom show that gun and knife crime have increased dramatically even though police numbers have risen considerably during the Labour administration's period in office. Gang crime in some estates is rampant and drug use is at almost endemic proportions. Staying with the realitites for one moment, the police have been spending almost 3 times as much of their time completing paperwork and administrative duties as they do patrolling the streets and solving crime.

The bleak portrayal of low income life in sink estates is in a major contrast to the increasing suburbanisation of British life where aspirations are headed by home and car ownership for many young people. Much of the despair and squalor comes about partly through the gang behaviour and the rigorous enforcement of omerta and the police's inability to carry out effective policing through lack of manpower on the ground and ineffective planning and execution of major operations.

Harry Brown is a man with little in life, having lost his loves and harbouring a secret life as a well decorated marine serving in Northern Ireland. The death of his only friend and chess competitor brings Brown into conflict witht the gangs on the estate and he enters into a mini war involving the gangs and their suppliers with gritty backgrounds of heoin abuse and marijhuana factories and some harrowing scenes and language.

In the end of a gratuitous and vicious conflict, there is a twist in the tale which sees an old enemy return and confound a view that brown espouses to a female police officer.

Others have made reference to similarities between this and films such as Death Wish but I beg to differ. There are many undertones here involving comparisons and contrasts with wars against terrorists for instance or between legitimate business and their dealings and illegitimate ones, which death wish does not have. Harry Brown is s more three dimensional character than Paul. It is also hard to imagine a neighbourhood in South London which is so diverse and capable of laying their hands on bazookas, nevermind banding together and taking on such thugs.

Finally, throughout this movie it is hard to escape the conclusion that Harry Brown himself is based on the character of Callan. A quiet, self-effacing man, who keeps himself to himself, has had a very difficult and deadly job for little money and who uses the power of his brain by studying the minutiae of a strategy game. he reluctantly gets involved in a conflict and uses his finely honed skills to forge a solution.

4117340,3,B003F1WA7C,"Harry Brown is a story in two parts.  In act one, Michael Caine plays an elderly ""pensioner"" whose bleak life gets even worse when his wife dies and his only friend is murdered.  This section is quite slow, but it turns out to be the best part, as Caine's portrayal of the very decent Harry and the losses he suffers is brilliant.  Every nuance, every facial expression communicates Harry's loss, heartbreak and his attempt to hold himself together.

I thought things could only get better.  And maybe this is because I'm now closer to Harry's age than to the troubled teens he does battle with.  But for me, the second act crossed the line from entertainment to whatever it is people go to horror movies to see.  It would be easy to say Harry Brown is like Death Wish with talented actors, but it seems there was a conscious decision to make the killing not only more graphic but also more sadistic than in previous movies with this plot line.  It may be that things are this bad, but this is still a work of fiction, not a documentary.  I'm not going to describe the addicts shooting up or the strangling of a woman (apparently quite enjoyable) but these were not things I needed to see in such detail in order to follow the story.

In the end, lots of death, not much satisfaction.  Harry's life is still as gray as an English winter day and one can imagine the same story that just played out is starting all over again, a few blocks away.  Amazon's description, that its not fun to watch but it stays with you is about right.  Its worth mentioning that the commentary by Michael Caine and the director is pretty interesting and Caine tells a few good jokes.

That said, even a Royal Marine would be hard pressed to take on youthful gang members at 70+ years of age.  Kind of like Grand Torino (revenge of the Geezers)but with a predictable ending.  Also if you don't follow thick Cockney accents, you'll need to select sub-titles to follow some of the colloquial ramblings of the gang members and others.
I still enjoyed the film and the violence was more realistic than most films. As a 50+ geezer myself, its fun to watch this stuff, but time slows one down thats just the cruel truth.  If you don't mind suspending your belief for a bit, then its a good revenge film with a good cast.",1283990400,,706,4.407692307692308
4117342,4,B003F1WA7C,"I really enjoyed this film. It didn't disappoint me. After a few years of seeing Caine act well, and in good films pretending to be American, he is now back where he belongs, in London, playing the Michael Caine of yesteryear. He uses his hard man with a heart of gold persona well, and his playing of the part is spot on. It's a little hard to take the fact that Caine is now 77, and I, perhaps unreasonably, wanted to see him as a man in his forties, being a hero and getting the girl. But, given that that can't happen now, thoughtful director Daniel Barber does well in bringing the ageing Caine to the role

The director portrays the nasty side of London in an uncompromising style, and it's a sobering thought that Caine's character is a retired Northern Ireland veteran soldier, rather than being from the Second World War or even Korea like we might expect. This makes him familiar with street violence, but his character also benefits from being surprisingly fit and alert for his age. This stretches credibility a bit, but as it's Caine, we will let him get away with it. The commentary accompanying the DVD is excellent, featuring both the lead actor and director, and their insights are invaluable in inderstanding why certain things were done a certain way. It is interesting to hear Caine fan Barber's confession that he wanted to create a classic Michael Caine line in ""You've failed to maintain your weapon, son!"", and he has succeeded admirably in that. The support actors are all good, especially Johnny Mortimer's daughter Emily as a policewoman.

Perhaps the only bad points of the film are the fact that Caine is 77 and not 67, and that much of the plot seems very similar to the 80 year-old Clint Eastwood's Gran Torino.

Eminently watchable, and yes, classic Caine.",1283990400,,1788,4.66984126984127
4117343,5,B003F1WA7C,"HARRY BROWN is a film that escorts the viewer into a world we would all rather not believe exists, that filthy place where misguided youths spend their days and night on using, pushing, selling, buying, and killing for drugs.  It is a horrid place and writer Gary Young and Director Daniel Barber take us therein as realistic a fashion as anyone has been able to capture on film. This film is definitely not for the faint of heart as it is full of violence holding no bars telling a tale of no redemptive values. Yet despite the grunge and stench of the setting the actors bring into focus a very real and very contemporary problem we must all address.

Harry Brown (Michael Caine in a brilliant portrayal) is an elderly poor man whose wife Kath (Liz Daniels) lies comatose in the local hospital.  Harry spends his days, when he is not at his beloved Kath's beside, playing chess and drinking with his old friend Len (David Bradley) in a bar owned by Sid (Liam Cunningham).  Len is becoming terrified at the gang violence in the estate (a housing project) and warns his friend Harry (an ex-Marine) of the danger of the streets.  Two events alter the routine of Harry's life: Kath dies and is buried next to Harry's daughter, and Len is murdered by the kid gangsters.  Harry works with the police - DI Alice Frampton (Emily Mortimer) and DS Terry Hicock (Charlie Creed-Miles) - hoping to assist in finding Len's murderer, but the police in general say it is a useless cause when they bring in some of the gang (Ben Drew et al) for questioning and there is too little proof to arrest them.  Harry takes the law into his own hands, buys a gun from a filthy trashed out druggie Marky (Jack O'Connell in a mesmerizingly realistic role), kills Marky and his colleague, and goes after the rest of the gang.  How Harry Brown works his own brand of vengeance  - with some assistance form Alice Frampton - frames the end of the story.

Michael Caine is wholly convincing as Harry Brown, making the viewer hope that he achieves his vengeful goals.  Liam Cunningham in a surprisingly turn of a role is excellent as are the rest of the cast.  No, this is not a pretty film to watch, but it does drive home the ghastly world of youth and drugs that infest our cities and also the anguish suffered by the elderly senior citizens who remember better times.

Now if we all just gave the good ol' law-abiding people some more guns, then maybe we could get rid of the scum. I hate this film as much as I hated the Jodie Foster revenge-thriller ""The One"", cause it doesn't wanna tell a story about real people, it just wants to entertain and shock! And that just leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. The whole thing starts out pretty decent, but quickly turns totally absurd and unbelievable. Don't fool yourself and think this is a ""real"" movie - go get the horror/terrorfilm ""Eden Lake"" instead - at least that movie didn't pretend to be something it wasn't. The one star is for Michael Caine - he's always good no matter what they put him in.",1283558400,4,768,4.340277777777778
4117345,3,B003F1WA7C,"Michael Caine defines ubiquitous in all the best ways, cinematically, and he makes Harry Brown a film worth watching almost completely on his own. He gets well inside the role and you can easily believe that this is a real guy going through these experiences.

But his efforts are beset by a painfully predictable script. We took turns guessing what would happen after each cut and got well over 80% of the next scenes. If you're going to remake revenge classics like Death Wish, add something new. Clint did and formed a classic in Gran Torino. But here, director Barber seems determined to make the most grinding, grey film he can. And succeeds.

To my mind the revenge flick genre is the laziest of all film types, except maybe the teen slasher pic. Revenge flicks almost all start the same: we're introduced to wonderful, nice people whose lives are then made a nightmare by one or more bad guys with no redeeming features, pure cartoon types set up to be knocked down in a drawn-out siege of Good conquering Evil. And that's exactly what Harry Brown does, to a T: we see what a great bloke Harry is, and we see what horrible little thugs the kids are. But it's all too simple to really touch the thinking viewer. The lead bad kid has zero good aspects we can see; comes from a family of criminals, is proud of it, kills at will and for fun, etc. Unlike almost all real people, he has zero positive qualities...a good thing, as that would make enjoying his death a bit harder, and we certainly wouldn't want that. Besides the complete unreality of all this, we accept it because we know it will make Harry's revenge that much ""sweeter""...read: easier to swallow and feel ""good"" about.

And there's the problem with revenge flicks: they make us bloodthirsty. But isn't that why we hate the bad guys in the first place...they're bloodthirsty? Oh right, theirs has no Justice in it. Whereas our lust for blood and violence is redemptive! My my, but we really ARE the Good Guys, ain't we?

Harry Brown feeds all of these cliches and so many more, and without Caine this would be a pathetic ad for community-sponsored fascism, or more police, or something involving more guns in any case. Now there's a recipe for peace and happiness! And in the end here, it is as usual the guns that win the day, not the brains...the only brains are those on the pavement, belonging to all the right bad guys who get killed for all the right reasons. It's almost like the Powers That Be won't let this kind of movie get made (or almost any these days) unless the real hero is a gun. And that's why this movie is, apart from Caine, so standard.

Caine is great but the story is not. I wasn't really entertained except by him, and I've seen him do so many roles close to this that there was little new to love. The Estate flats are presented as entirely without joy, and life is in general pointless. Is Britain really this pathetic? I doubt it. But all the easy choices are made by Barber here, and that results in a basic movie that's been made a dozen times before. Take away Caine's measured turn here and this is barely watchable. Put him in it and he's a treat to see in action, but he's still in a labored, slow, predictable and unpleasant film.

Unless watching 2D cartoonish bad guys get shot is pleasant for you, in which case: step right up!

I'll stick with Gran Torino as the clear recent winner in this genre, and let Harry Brown remind me that revenge movies are all about making the viewer into what we're told to hate on screen: an unthinking automaton out only for the ultimately selfish visceral thrill and satisfaction of watching people get killed. And where's the good in that?",1283558400,3,3681,4.501497005988024

His life is changed when one of his last few living friends is brutally murdered shortly after his ailing wife dies. He becomes a soft-spoken vigilante, hunting down the gang that killed his friend and is terrorizing his nieghborhood.

This is a great movie, and Michael Caine is perfect as Harry Brown. It is surprisingly violent for a British crime drama, but the story, the acting and the subdued pacing of this film make it a must-see.

4117347,4,B003F1WA7C,"The titular character is portrayed by Michael Caine. If you look up Caine in Wikipedia, you will find that he has been in over one hundred films. He is seventy-seven. He was raised in South London, near where the film is set. Caine is a combat veteran of the Korean War; Harry Brown is a veteran of the Royal Marines with service under fire in Northern Ireland. So, Caine could draw upon a lot of his own experiences as he stepped into Harry's shoes.

Harry lives alone. He only has one close friend. This friend is killed by thugs who belong to a gang that terrorizes Harry's neighborhood, ""the estates,"" a huge housing complex that is in an advanced state of decay.

The aging Harry, burdened with a severe case of emphysema, decides to act himself when the police cannot build a case against his friend's killers. In fact, the police seem unable to control the thugs who spread mayhem which includes dealing  drugs, stealing  cars, and assaulting  people throughout the estates. Harry becomes a vigilante, using the fighting skills he acquired as a Royal Marine.

The film includes the classic cop who will bend the rules versus the by-the-book cops. There are some over the top bad guys. There's a den of iniquity that features scores of marijuana plants. The British rapper Ben Drew convincingly plays a brutal young tough.

If you're looking for avant-garde cinema or something at all subtle, look elsewhere. If you want a fairly good drama that includes another masterful Michael Caine performance and an exciting conclusion, you should check this one out.",1283299200,3,1563,4.809701492537314
4117348,4,B003F1WA7C,"Can it really be 36 years since Charles Bronson took justice in his own hands in the film DEATH WISH? Apparently it has but the genre of vigilante justice has continued on in his absence, taking form in various shapes such as the new release HARRY BROWN.

Michael Caine stars as Harry Brown, a retired ex-serviceman whose wife passes early in the film and whose days are filled with little more than a chess game at the local pub with his best friend Leonard (David Atwell). While playing and drinking beer, Leonard comments on how the local punk kids are harassing more and more people and the one at the bar is dealing drugs openly without fear. Harry suggests he calm down and let it pass.

But Leonard doesn't let it pass. While Harry avoids the underpass walkway to get where ever he is going, Leonard has had enough. He shows Harry one day in the pub restroom that he is now carrying his bayonet from his time in the military. It becomes the same bayonet that is used by the gang members to kill and disfigure Leonard that night.

As the police investigate Leonard's death Harry is outraged, especially when investigator Alice Frampton (Emily Mortimer) tells him Leonard should have contacted the police. Harry tells her in no kind words that Leonard did call the police and nothing happened.

Alone with no wife and no friend, Harry decides to take it upon himself to defend the neighborhood he lives in. A man pushed to the limit, like Leonard he has had enough. Weaponless, Harry decides his first mark will be the very punks responsible for putting guns on the street. Armed and dangerous with both the punks and the police searching for the man behind the murders, Harry plans out his next line of attack. But will he be prepared for the discovery of who is behind it all.

The film is an action film but plays more as a drama. The focus may at first seem to be the story of youth violently gone wild but beneath that surface lies a character study of an aging military man who reaches the breaking point and a depiction of today's youth, bound up in video games, developing no sense of right and wrong, of not caring about anything or anyone except for the quick fix.  Both are capable of great destruction, but only one does so for all the right reasons no matter how bad it seems.

It is through subtlety that Caine brings to life this character that has seen better days for both himself and his neighborhood. No long drawn out monologues or stretched out scenes of violence. Yes Harry uses violence, but the fact is while the punks tend to become violent and use it in game like fashion Harry has an objective and moves forward to get there rather than drag it out. No words are necessary; his righteous indignation at the world as it is plays out in his face and his actions.

The vigilante film has been around for ages but DEATH WISH took it into the urban landscape. Subsequent sequels took it to near cartoon stages with overplayed and overdone villains. HARRY BROWN takes the genre back to more realistic roots, offering some strange villains of its own but ones that you actually feel could and do exist.

In a world filled with laws and loopholes that allow violent criminals an exit or escape at times, viewers have always clung to the vigilante justice allowed by movies. Be it Bronson in DEATH WISH, the character of Bufford Pussed in the WALKING TALL movies or Harry Brown, we all wish that there was someone out there willing to take the extra step needed to see that justice prevails when justice is subverted. And because of that desire movies like this will always find an audience.

Unfortunately this film received little or no release to screens across the country filled with multiple showings of the latest blockbuster. Fortunately DVD releases give us the chance to see things passed over by the local multiplex. That being said, HARRY BROWN is a solid drama that delivers exactly what the trailers showed: a man seeking justice for wrongful acts. And Michael Caine offers a dynamite subtle performance that may not be the best thing he's ever done, but shows he can still act with the best of them.",1283299200,,4137,4.578378378378378
4117349,4,B003F1WA7C,"After watching this once, I decided to watch it a second time. It was just as good the second viewing. Although it is being reviewed incorrectly as a run-of-the-mill vigilante film, those reviews are not accurate.
The movie, in my opinion, was not like other movies. The fact that the main character (Michael Caine) is not only losing his wife, sick himself, now his only friend has been killed and the police are doing nothing to help, makes it a very different movie. He does NOT just walk into a room and shoot up the place in a fake, Hollywood way. He struggles to survive every encounter and doesn't always get away without injury. The one police officer (Emily Mortimer) that is trying to help is not only getting no info from the victims but is being shut down by her own inept partner and boss. There is more to this movie than one story about a man who is pushed until he has to fight back, there are other stories going on in this movie.
I give it 4 stars because it was unrealistic that an entire police force has no way of handling unarmed rioters and they run away when they are confronted by civilians?? Has anyone ever heard of non-lethal riot gear such as sand bag guns, tear gas, or water hoses??
Also, there are very few special features.
I do still recommend the movie. It was well made and well acted. You really root for the good guy and really hate the bad guys in this movie. There were no substandard performances.",1283299200,,1438,4.409774436090226

VIDEO:

""Harry Brown"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  Picture quality is very well done.  You can see the detail and skin pores of the characters, blood can be seen with detail, especially the detail of scars, tattoos, the injuries to the detail of the grungy, graffiti dominated walls and old apartments in rundown areas featured in the film.

Certain scenes are quite vibrant and colorful but most of the film is shot at night, in dark and dilapidated areas.  Overall, good amount of detail, blacks are nice and deep and very well-done cinematography by Martin Ruhe (""The Countess"", ""Linear"").

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Harry Brown"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  The lossless audio for this film is fantastic.  The gun sounds that are captured on screen are very crisp, loud and clear!  Surround use is well done as we can hear crowd ambiance, telephone ringing so clear that you think it may be coming from your own house,  a television in the background to various sounds that are utilized through the film.

Dialogue is absolutely crisp and clear through the center channels and front channels are well-done in capturing the various gun sounds to windows being destroyed, vehicles crashing into each other and in one scene, this churning of sound that is captured throughout the whole room utilize the surround channels and LFE.  Overall, a good use of the lossless soundtrack!

  * movieIQ+sync (logo) and BD-Live connect you to real-time information on the cast, music, trivia and more while watching the movie!

JUDGMENT CALL:

With similar films such as ""Gran Torino"" starring Clint Eastwood to ""The Brave One"" starring Jodie Foster, ""Harry Brown"" takes a familiar concept but this time taking place in a crime-infested area of London where gang violence or drug pushers have taken control of public areas, putting fear into those living in the area and innocent people are beaten or murdered and not even the police are there to defend the peace.  Who else to defend the peace than one man's act of vigilante-ism.  Welcome to ""Harry Brown"".

With ""Harry Brown"", Michael Caine pulls of a fantastic performance and that certain situations can drive a man from law-abiding citizen to becoming a vigilante.  He's simply had enough of the violence that has plagued his neighborhood and after the film had screened in the UK, many people took to the forums and it was an interesting split of people who felt the world needs more people like Harry Brown and others who felt that there was no way an elderly man with emphysema can become a vigilante.

Needless to say, Gary Young has crafted a screenplay that is not only gripping, violent and literally draws you in (as you want to see Michael Caine really want to get back at the thugs) but the only way they were going to strike a chord with the general audience is that you have to show how things have gotten out of hand and how even the police are having their difficulties.

But where we have seen these problems unfold on the local news in metropolitan areas nearly everyday, many of us here in America may wonder, is this problem in London really that bad?  The more I started to do my research on South and East London, the more I started to learn about the racial divide, how people were being forced to move away because of race and it has gotten so bad that the drug problem and crime has taken control of an area.  Many Londoners have said that things have gotten out of hand in those areas that the character of Harry Brown really hit a nerve with many people who have had enough of the crime.

With that being said, I thought the film was smartly crafted but towards the third arc, that is where the film started to get far out there and without spoiling the film, as much as that third arc became a gripping and violent, the film strayed from what possibly can happen with a man turning vigilante and the cops suspecting him for murder to a film that was like a scene out of ""Black Hawk Down"" where there is just violence all over the city, the police were like soldiers venturing into an area of uncertainty and there was no decorum.  The police look as if they were overtaken by the criminals and the characters that we have rooted for become victims.

The ending does work, it's just a bit farfetched and things get off to easy.  I can go into detail and become a bit nitpicky about that third arc, but I would be spoiling the film.  So, I'll leave it to the viewer to determine how they feel about the final half hour of the film.

But I did enjoy the film and to see the character of Harry Brown change to a vigilante was very cool.  Michael Caine is a fantastic actor and by no means did the filmmakers try to turn his elderly character to the Punisher or anything like that.  His performance was wonderful.  Emily Mortimer's character as Detective Alice Frampton is a character that had its potential but to tell you the truth, I don't think the writers did any justice towards her character.  She has the potential to be a strong woman and instead she becomes a weak victim and it's not the way how I expected her character to be played out at the end.  So, as much as the performances and the cinematography were well-done, part of my problem was with the actual screenplay and primarily for that third act.

I have to say that the young talent playing the criminals did a wonderful job in their interrogation scenes.  I don't know how much of it was improvised but young talent Ben Drew did a wonderful job playing Noel Winters dishing it, making it feel real and showing his disgust towards the police and to see that cocky, F-U attitude was pretty impressive.

As for the Blu-ray release, you do get an entertaining, informative and hilarious audio commentary by director Daniel Barber, producer Kris Thykier and Michael Caine and you get several deleted scenes and that is about it.  I was hoping to see more featurettes from behind-the-scenes of the filming of the movie, interviews with the cast, Michael Caine preparing for this role.  Just something extra would have been nice but you do get a few special features rather than none.

Overall, ""Harry Brown"" is a gripping, compelling vigilante film that really showcases Michael Caine's talent and to show him in a different kind of film which many viewers have never seen him play before.  The cinematography was really well done and it was good play of colors during those night scenes that were well-done as well.  Despite my feeling that the third act became a bit too chaotic and like the London has reached Armageddon, if you get past that and just take the film as a whole, I had an enjoyable time watching this film.

If you are a fan of films such as ""Gran Torino"" or ""The Brave One"" and you enjoy the acting of Michael Caine, I definitely recommend giving ""Harry Brown"" a chance!",1283212800,10,7963,4.691864650827934

Viewers who are turned off by excessive violence and harsh language should avoid this film, but if you're the kind of person who, like me, cheers when a low-life criminal gets his, then this is the movie for you.

Michael Caine stars as Harry Brown, a retired British Marine and widower.  He lives in a gang and drug-infested housing project.  The police seem to be powerless, even after Brown's only friend, also an elderly gent, is brutally murdered by the gang.  Shortly thereafter, one of the thugs tries to rob Harry who, using his long dormant military training, kills the man, and then runs off.

At that point, Harry decides to come out of retirement and, single-handed, kill the gang members and drug suppliers that have destroyed his neighborhood.  Despite his advanced age, he does it very well.

Michael Caine, one of the finest (still working) film actors of his generation, is magnificent as Brown, and Emily Mortimer is excellent as an emotionally-torn police detective who suspects that Brown is the vigilante eliminating gang members, yet is sympathetic to his position.

Daniel Barber directs efficiently and Gary Young has delivered a taut screenplay with good dialogue, although he does tend to rely on coincidence a but too much during the last third of this, otherwise, quite entertaining movie.

4117354,4,B003F1WA7C,"""Harry Brown"", one of the latest examples of the urban vigilante genre, has often been called the ""British Gran Torino"", recalling Clint Eastwood's celebrated 2008 film about an elderly man facing gang violence in suburban Detroit.  There are certainly superficial simlarities, particularly the age of the protagonist (Caine is younger than Eastwood, and looks it, but paradoxically Caine's character seems much more physically impaired than Eastwood does in that movie), and the casting of an actor known as a first-rate action hero in his youth.  If ""Gran Torino"" sent Dirty Harry to retirement in the suburbs, ""Harry Brown"" follows an elderly Jack Carter onto the council estate.  However, the comparison really does not go much further than that - ""Gran Torino"" was a deconstruction of the urban vigilante genre, with the climax being Walt's realization that violence would not solve the problem (in its focus on the aftereffects of living a violent life and the realities of brutality, it was a companion piece to ""Unforgiven""); ""Harry Brown"" is a fairly straight example, albeit a very gritty one.  Spoilers follow.

This plays into, of course, the central question surrounding the urban vigilante genre, which took off in the United States in the 1970s capitalizing on middle class (predominantly white middle class) paranoia about crime rates and urban (racial minority, heavily) gangs.  The whole genre, particularly examples like the ""Death Wish"" films, have been called right wing fantasies aimed at ginning up support for harsher crime penalties.  And certainly there is something to it, particularly given that many remain convinced that crime is still spiralling out of control when in fact crime rates throughout the western world have been pronouncedly declining for decades now.  To sidestep the debate, one will simply say that it is a genre convention, and, much like many other films relying on lone wolves (superhero films, for instance), one doesn't need to accept such a thing as desirable in real life to enjoy the film.  As it is, this is a well-done revenge movie that does what one would expect:  sets up utterly loathable villains and then pits out protagonist to deal out some rough justice.  In this case, it's ex-Royal Marine Harry Brown (Sir Michael Caine), who, following the death of his only remaining close friend Leonard (David Bradley) at the hands of some street thugs, declares open season on the chavs that haunt the council estate.

The film owes a lot to its director, Daniel Barber, who opts for a very documentary style reminiscent at times of Paul Greengrass (though generally lighter on the use of the handheld camera or ""shaky-cam"" as it has been pejoratively dubbed; the most notable instance would be the harrowing opening scene of a couple of a chav initiation scene that ends with a mother and child shot dead for no particular reason); the screen oozes grime and urban decay.  Barber's depiction of the violence is likewise effective; whereas many revenge films opt for the balletic approach to violence, Barber shows it like it probably would be:  messy and disorienting.  Every single gun shot will make you jump slightly.  A good revenge movie supplies a gallery of detestable rogues, and ""Harry Brown"" delivers in spades; for critics of the vigilante genre's message, racial issues are non-applicable, as the villains are dealt from an exclusively white deck, leaving us instead with class as the main marker, as our foes are all deeply impoverished pond scum.  There's one thug whose horrific backstory is acknowledged, but otherwise they're a detestable lot of monsters.  The standout sequence is Harry's visit to a drug dealer to buy weapons, a masterpiece of slow burn tension.  Caine is expectedly excellent; Emily Mortimer as the face of the police is a bit too soft to be believable, but that may be part of the point.

4117355,3,B003F1WA7C,"I'll start off by saying that I'm a big fan of Michael Caine who I think is a brilliant character actor. I've sat through some of those mediocre films his made over the years (I think those ""pay the rent"" between the true classics that are not quite populist enough to help box office sales. While this film is not as weak as some he's made, Caine is the glue that holds this ""thriller"" together. Otherwise it's now-standard ""revenge"" film, which was done better with Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down"", and Tim Robbins in ""Noise"" after the whole chain of Charles Bronson ""Death Wish"" films.

Caine has a way of internalizing both the fear and anger he feels as a pensioner who has just lost his best friend (and chess partner) to a violent death by drugged punks. This is what ""modernizes"" the film. There's a whole scary drug culture to exploit.

As you would expect there are many graphic violence scenes, but this sells tickets these days. And the soundtrack has that eerie style of music that tells you this film is trying to be different. But, despite the violence, the film moves slowly until the next stabbing or shooting.

The actors, other than Caine, are not well known in the US but they are there to support him. The bonus features include just a handful of short deleted scenes, that wouldn't have added much, and a feature length commentary with Caine as well as the Director and producer (which I did not watch.).

If you are a Caine fan, like I am, you'll probably want to see this film for his performance. If it's a revenge film you want, you can certainly start with the aforementioned ones.

8395809,5,B003F1WA7C,"This is a great, very enjoyable, very engrossing film because of the action, the suspense, and most of all the acting by two-time Academy award winner Michael Caine. In the film, he is an old man suffering from emphysema. He is living in what is called in England, the estates, slums. His wife just died after suffering from dementia. His only friend, another old man who also lives in the estates, who was frequently harassed by the hoodlums who live in the estates, who was very frightened of them, has just been murdered by them. He is now alone. The police are unable to convict his friend's killers or stop the crime in the estates. He was in his youth a highly decorated marine. He decides to take matters into his own hands despite his physical condition. I enjoyed the film and think other will as well.",1524528000,2,811,4.523809523809524
