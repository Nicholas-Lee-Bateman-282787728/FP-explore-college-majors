8654017,4,B00JVFRL7K,"I saw She's Got Everything on TV and have not seen it on this DVD.  I haven't seen Smartest Girl in Town at all.  I gave it four stars instead of 5 because it is not as fast paced as say, Ghostbusters.  However, it is funny and the plot keeps moving.  Gene Raymond and Ann Sothern make the romance very appealing.  Helen Broderick is very funny as her aunt.  At the beginning of the movie the creditors are hauling off the furniture.  They lift the mattress off the bed with the sleeping Carol (Sothern) still on it.  Carol has discovered, upon her return from Europe, that her deceased father has left nothing but mountains of debts.  Her Aunt Jane wants her to marry a rich man to pay off the debts, but Carol wants to get a job and work to pay them off.  Aunt Jane and her pal Waldo plot to get her  married off to the rich Fuller.  Waldo gets her a job as Fuller's secretary.  Carol is happy to be working to pay off her debts.  The romance and the humor make it very appealing.",1401926400,7,982,4.154255319148936
