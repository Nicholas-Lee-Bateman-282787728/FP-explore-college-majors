2717646,5,B000LXHK3G,"This is a perfect DVD to start out with, or to do if you have taken time off from lifting for a while.  Shipped promptly.",1267056000,4,121,3.84
2717647,5,B000LXHK3G,"I first became aware of how exercise can affect bone denisty when my daughter's riding instructor, a very hard-bodied woman in her late forties who rode all day every day, told us about a horse falling with her, full on her ankle. The doctor sent her to X-ray saying she should prepare to find out it was broken and she called back from the gurney being wheeled away, ""Bet it's not!"" She was right. All her physical exercise had strengthened her bones to the point that 1300 pounds of equine couldn't make a dent. As I reach ""a certain age"" I think more about doing something about bone density as well as muscle tone. I don't want to be one of those poor elderly women who walk bent over and afraid.

Joyce Vedral's DVD, Complete Bone Building Body Shaping Workout, is the best and most do-able of all the ones I've tried. Joyce, as always, shows you step-by-step and gives you time to learn the routine. She also gives you options for getting down on the floor or sitting on a chair instead, which is always a nice choice to have. This routine is great for any age, since Joyce is doing it side-by-side with a younger woman to show how versatile the routine can be, and it is a whole body workout. At one point Joyce opts to do an alternate leg routine that will have the same effect but is lower strain and she explains it's because of recent knee surgery. I like the fact that she encourages the viewer by throwing out reasons for you to keep going - ""You want to be able to pick up those grandchildren!""

Good for beginner level of ability or as a maintenance routine for the already fit, good for any age, and offers all sorts of alternate positions and movements for special circumstances. Altogether GREAT!",1243555200,21,1714,4.438095238095238
2717648,5,B000LXHK3G,"I LOVE Joyce Vedral and have done her workouts (on and off) for about nine years and therefore own most of her DVDs already. But I have to say that this has to be one of my favorite JV DVDs. It is a no non-sense, basic, well paced workout. Some of her other workout DVDs are paced too fast and can be hard to keep up with, but not this one. It's brilliant and easy to follow. If you are just starting out or simply want a simple weights routine to do at home, I highly recommend this one. You will also need the book if you are starting out for all the extra info you don't get on the DVD.

Be aware that anyone looking for an advanced workout will not be happy with this one. It's basic but it WORKS!",1196640000,24,701,3.936619718309859
2717649,3,B000LXHK3G,"The instruction and routine is very thorough but there is no glitz to this one. Straightforward and no music. I found it too slow but if you have never done weight training of any kind, this one is really easy to follow and would probably be a good place to start.",1178928000,16,264,4.196078431372549
8165239,5,B000LXHK3G,"I've tried some Beach Body weight workouts but I think Joyce is the most easy to follow weight coach.  Her workouts are easy to follow, made for women and she's really funny.  Her form may not be perfect but she looks incredible for her age and I hope to look as good as her AND have bone density like she does!",1465084800,,311,4.081967213114754

8165242,5,B000LXHK3G,Bought this to accompany the video.  It gives lots of easy to follow exercises and explains the whole concept very well.  Love the pictures of the starting and finishing pictures. Very helpful information for folks concerned about osteoporosis.,1387411200,,244,5.394736842105263
8165243,5,B000LXHK3G,"Straight forward free weight workout. Joyce is a good teacher, she is funny too. If you are looking for a workout that has great instruction on how to lift free weights, then try this workout. I  am in my late 50s and this is not too hard to do; start with light weights and progress to heavier ones.  You have the option to do the entire workout or to split it into 2 days.  Well done Joyce.",1385337600,,392,4.064935064935065
8165244,5,B000LXHK3G,I like that it is a basic workout that you can do and customize to your own schedule.  I have picked up some pointers and really enjoy this as an into to work with weights.,1379808000,,172,3.914285714285714
8165245,5,B000LXHK3G,"I love Joyce Vedral. I got one of her books years ago, did the workout for a few months, then we moved and I lost it. Saw her videos on Amazon and got this one... and it's pretty good, I think. I especially think this one is great for a beginner to weights because she explains what a set is, what a super set is, etc. Plus her story is pretty darn motivating. For her age, she looks great. Heck, she looks great for someone 20 years younger! The workout itself is pretty straightforward and it makes sense. I have only started doing this so the jury is still out on how effective it is - but I am optimistic. She does have a pretty strong New York accent, which I actually like. And I like that the workout allows you to count down with her daughter (who does the count down) so you just keep pace with it. Easy to follow and clearly explained. The fact that this is an older lady should help people who are intimidated by weights, too.",1379203200,2,937,4.153846153846154
8165246,4,B000LXHK3G,"As I age this could be helpful,can substitute the exercises for men (but like Top Shape book would be better as you could apply eating plans etc.)",1377129600,,146,4.444444444444445
8165247,4,B000LXHK3G,"I searched around for a bone building work out and this is the only one out there that claims to do the job.  I have a bunch of Denise, Tammy, Kathy and Gilad videos that have kept me in shape for years. I'm in my 50s and never heard of Joyce V.  Well, I'm glad I found her, even though she must be about 65 now,  her older videos and books are relevant now that I'm concerned with keeping strong as I get older. Joyce is a tough, energetic lady who knows her stuff. Proof:  try to wear a bikini in your 60s!  I've been working out with this video for 3 months.  My arms are back in top shape, and I can see and feel a big difference.  I absolutely love her classic line in this video on day 2:  "" I never thought I would get old. But I'll be 60 on my next birthday. HELLO,  it happens!""  If there is a time in life when you really need to build up your strength, its age 40 - 60.",1370476800,2,880,3.8121546961325965
8165248,4,B000LXHK3G,"If you need to build strength, try Joyce's DVDs. A friend of mine used them and suggested I get them. I got one and was hooked. She makes it fun to build my body up! :)",1321056000,,168,3.6944444444444446
