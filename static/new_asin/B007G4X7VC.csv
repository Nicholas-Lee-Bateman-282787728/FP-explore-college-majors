5084692,2,B007G4X7VC,"I entered into THE RIVER as a program mostly due to the idea that good suspense-horror television is very rare, and from casting actors like Bruce Greenwood and Leslie Hope, it seemed like it would be a good pick. To be totally fair, the pilot episode is very strong. While light on things like creating interesting characters (Greenwood only appears in TV footage and he has a more fleshed-out character in his few minutes on screen than any of the other characters combined), it was heavy on creating atmosphere and terror and mystery. The conceit of the show really being two things:

1. It's another ""found-footage"" experiment from Oren Peli, the mastermind (if such a word can be used) of the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise.

2. There is actual magic out there, and it's not just a tagline, and that's what Emmet Cole was searching for.

Again, in the interest of fairness, I don't mind the ""found footage"" idea. It's propelled some very solid filmmaking like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project-Blu-ray/dp/B003Y5H59M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield-Blu-ray/dp/B0018QCXGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Exorcism-Blu-ray/dp/B003L20IF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Exorcism [Blu-ray</a>]. Of course, once something has been a proven success, the gimmick becomes over-exploited. There's going to be a third PARANORMAL ACTIVITY film, and there was the recent attempt of making a ""found footage"" comedy with the flop PROJECT X. With THE RIVER, the conceit can only last so long before it's obvious that there are moments on-screen that simply cannot be captured with multiple angles as they show. It also confines us to learning about the characters via more ""found footage"" or through on-camera interviews. I realize that the whole object of the show, despite the travel being done on the world's longest river, it's extremely claustrophobic since most of the show is set on-board The Magus. While that might work well for the terror and suspense, it's lousy for character development. Without good characters and good character work, it's very hard for an audience to maintain interest over several hours.

Then there are the characters themselves: They're so stock that it's almost embarrassing. You have the wounded yet devoted wife; the handsome, belligerent, resentful son; the son's pretty first love; the slimy and cuckolded euro-trash producer; the cocky and skillful cameraman; the silent and mysterious mercenary; the working-class grease-encrusted loyal mechanic; the spiritually-connected child who is the only one who sees the bad things to come and everyone ignores her.

The biggest problem that the program has isn't the lack of character development or the stock dialogue or the telegraphed shock moments. The biggest problem the show has is that not just the network, but the creators REALLY want this show to be the next LOST. It's been a while since ABC has had a phenomenon like LOST they can call their own, and they thought they found it in THE RIVER. The show also wants to create an all-too-similar atmosphere: secrets of the past, isolation, desperation, foreign territory, fear, and a series of weird ""WTF?!?!"" moments. Sadly, they've hamstrung themselves from allowing natural character growth to happen by confining the series to the ""found footage"" genre and while some people loved LOST because of those same kinds of story moments, most viewers loved LOST because of the characters. THE RIVER can't reach those heights.

My intent here is not to get on a soapbox and tell you how much I miss LOST and how I wish this show was more like it. My intent is to demonstrate how, in many ways, this show wants to be LOST and falls short in every way. I watched the first four episodes and had the remaining four on my DVR for far too long. I just couldn't find the interest in me to continue watching. I didn't care about any of the characters, other than Greenwood, and frankly, the whole show fails primarily because it's shackled itself to only one format of storytelling. That's fine for a film, but it's death for a serialized television program.",1333670400,6,4380,5.539611360239163
5084693,5,B007G4X7VC,"I really enjoyed the program on tv.  The show kept you wondering what is going to happen next, and with the ending as it was, almost anything can happen.  I obviously so enjoyed the suspense, but even more so, I liked the supernatural happenings.  I look forward to receiving the dvd so it can be viewed all at once instead of segments. I recommend it to nature lovers, lovers of the supernatural and even those who embrace the spiritual.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-River-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B007G4X7VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The River: The Complete First Season</a>",1332633600,3,625,6.160919540229885
5084694,4,B007G4X7VC,look i get that this show is familiar. but what i find the most intersting about this show is it's use of tropes in new ways. the best thing to me about this show is that it's typical horror t.v. monster of the week use doesn't preclude the progress of the search. it all has connection and keeps your interest. some eps. are better than others but the adult reaction with the colorful language and behavior for me makes this one of the better shows on t.v. i especially enjoy the relationships of the characters. this show keeps the viewers interest and to me it's better than celebrated shows like american horror and walking dead. why? because it seems to be less using the form of the genre while respecting the predicesors of horror. kind of in the way battlestar galactica did in the early millineum. i recomend this show for watchers looking for more depth in their scfi. especially if you are a reader of lovecraft and alan moores swamp thing - american gothic. it's everywhere if you open your eyes to it.,1332201600,21,1014,4.516304347826087
5084695,4,B007G4X7VC,I really like it. I have watched every show. I don't really care if they find him or not but I do want to know what it is that is going after every one. It can be scary in spots. The part with the monkey was icky. Worth watching. I do hope it comes back.,1331251200,3,254,3.6363636363636362
5084696,5,B007G4X7VC,"I bought this series back in 2012 and recently picked it off the shelf for another look. The synopsis on the cover always sounded promising but it doesn't do justice to this TV series which was cut short before its time.

Basically, a nature TV presenter goes missing in the Amazon and his wife, son and a ragtag group go in search of him some time later when a beacon triggers that he may still be alive. The search party enters the Amazon and runs into natural and supernatural phenomena and it treads the line skillfully so the production never becomes silly. It might sound pedestrian but there was something very special here which must have passed the viewers by and obviously the network when it came up for renewal.

But for sceptics, what makes this a no-brainer now is the price - I paid about US $20 for this (with a much better exchange rate!) but I can see it selling now for US $8.99. It's hard to go wrong with an 8-part series for this money.",1475712000,,958,4.376404494382022

Yeah, its average and probably could have been done better (considering Steven Spielberg was involved) but the happenings were weird and made sence to the plot. It did have have a conclusion even though it was cancelled after 1 Series.  Had more thought gone into it before filming I think it would have been rivetting viewing with interesting different ideas.

Why the comparison to Lost???  That loses me.  Did they even watch it??

I do question the G rating though???  Skinned and rotting bodies everwhere.  Blood and guts with occasional vomiting?????? Children would never be the same!

I'm a sucker for the Paranormal Activity series so the found footage feel and that fact that you have to suspend all rational belief when watching these types of films is nothing new to me.  Other than that it was an entertaining watch.  I bought for my sister and she really like and scared her quiet a bit.  I on the other hand didn't jump or flinch once.  But it was interesting to see where the story was going although I feel like they phoned it in at the end and there could have been a lot more put into the story given the producers and directors past.

5084735,4,B007G4X7VC,"Here I am a year and a half later, wishing this show would continue.  It was edgy, suspenseful, full of a little South American and Amazonian flavor.  And the black magic, voodoo, whatever you want to call it, kept me intrigued.  Yeah, so some of the characters spoke Spanish.  There are some Spanish speaking folks in Brazil.  Does not bug me.
What I wish Mr. Spielberg would consider:  If you want a cult following, find some edgy, contemporary music to add a better background.  There are several numbers on Radiohead's album King of LImbs (something like that) that would fit great as opening numbers for the boat going down the river.  Radiohead is just one example of some cool music to keep the audience coming back, wondering what new music will be introduced to the followers each week.
OK, for those of you who just don't get it, and don't care for this series....guess what, it ain't for you!  Those of us who loved it, want it back.

5084736,4,B007G4X7VC,"The River is a niche ""series"".  One of those you'll love it or hate it type of thing.  And, I quoted ""series"" because it says season 1, but it is basically a closed story arch with a cliff hanger.  So, while there is an opening for a follow up season, or more than one, if they don't carry on, it still ended fairly well.

The short and ugly of this product is this:

1. Wild life expert, and film crew, lost in Amazon.
2. Expert's family, with film crew, head to Amazon to find lost people.
3. Hand-held, shaky cam mixed with fixed angle security cam, occasional clips from earlier periods of time.
4. Various legend and and folklore of the Amazon touched upon.
5. Some questions just won't be answered, so... be ready for that.
6. Deaths do occur, but gore and bloody effects are minimal at most.

If you enjoy suspense, supernatural, or lost footage type films, give it a shot.  It is surprisingly well done for a ""series"" designed for cable t.v..",1383350400,2,950,4.394285714285714
5084737,1,B007G4X7VC,"Idea good, a few clever special effects and sets...otherwise, a bomb in every sense of the word. Either the ""actors"" (more correctly ""line repeaters"")couldn't act or they received the world's worst direction.  They memorized their lines but didn't deliver characters I could identify with or care about.  Neither did they relate to each other...it was like a group of marbles, rolling around, bumping into each other but not connecting.  They gave a new meaning to the word ""wooden"".

Cancelled?  The only surprise here is that they aired it in the first place. I read somewhere someone said that, because of the cancellation, viewers might have had a lot of unanswered questions.

I gotta say I never watch shows like this but the way it was shot and the setting made me get interested in it in the first place. I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. but it was really good, I googled around to see if there was a season 2, but all I saw was about it getting canceled from the channel that originally aired it which I think was abc? not sure, but Im very disappointed that there is no follow up season, you can only conclude from the ending that they never was able to leave and all eventually died. which with the ending they left us with it coulda been so much more if they had a season 2. so yes this is a good show, but because there is no season 2 and an open ending makes me sad to have watched it, I guess thats because I cant stand movies or shows that leave you with no real ending.

5084744,4,B007G4X7VC,I did a survey on the pilot episode which really caught my eye during the survey I said how much I enjoyed this episode. Later on it asked what channel would fit this show and based on what I saw I suggested channels like HBO and Showtime that could keep it on the air. It also asked if I would watch if it came on network tv my reply was no because they would kill the show too quickly. Sad to see I was right about that chalk up another hit from the networks with this one. I do plan on getting this just to see if they kept the original cast which I thought was good. My favorite parts of the pilot episode I saw was the missing fathers old tv show clips they had just the right amount of cheesiness to bring some humor into this show. Hopefully HBO Showtime or FX takes a chance on them would prefer HBO or Showtime as FX killed off the great Terriers show way too early.,1365206400,,875,4.005714285714285

Each hour long episode was like a mini Paranormal Activity; you were waiting for the 60 seconds that were really thrilling. For me, that type of formula was exciting, I like when you never know what's going to happen next, what freaky scene you're going to see. The reason it didn't get boring was because the story that the show was based on was very entertaining and kept you guessing. The acting was also really good, they meshed well, and there were no big names, so it was nice to see the talent of the cast. For me, this will definitely be a series that gets played through October and whenever else I need that freaked-out chill that comes along with really freaky horror flics.",1350172800,,1046,5.158823529411765

Very disappointing, not at all creepy and the characters, particularly Tess very irritating. Think twice before spending your hard earned money on this.  If you want to watch a good series try the Danish The Killing 1&2, The Bridge and French tv series Braquo and Spiral, I promise you'll never see anything better!",1346457600,5,411,4.857142857142857

EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS A NETWORK SHOW AND I WAS HESITATE TO WATCH KNOWING THEY CANCEL ANYTHING GOOD AND SURE ENOUGH I JUST READ THEY CANCELED IT AND SOME OTHER SHOWS. THIS SHOW WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT TO CONTINUE ON BUT OH NOOOOOOO! WE HAVE TO KEEP ALL THE JUNK THEY HAVE ON THEIR LINE UPS. GUESS THAT'S WHY I ONLY WATCHED THAT SHOW AND GRIMM..WHICH I'M NOT SURE THAT ONE IS GOING TO CONTINUE SINCE THEY ENDED FIRST SEASON AND STARTED THE NEW SEASON RIGHT AWAY. WHO DOES THAT. THANK THE LORD ALL OF MY OTHER SHOWS ARE ON OTHER STATIONS! I STILL HAVE THIS BOX SET AND WILL JUST ENJOY THE LITTLE BIT WE ALL GOT TO SEE!,1346371200,,690,4.080882352941177

5084758,5,B007G4X7VC,"I purchased this box set after seeing numerous commercials but never having seen an episode.  The price was good and so I decided to go for it.  It turns out that this series is great!  If you are into syfy and the supernatural, you will love this series.  I was disappointed when I watched the final episode because I wanted to watch more!  It was an interesting concept that played out very well.  I much enjoyed the season and can't wait for the next one!  I would recommend this to any syfy lover or anyone who wants to watch something both interesting and mysterious!",1344729600,,572,4.4423076923076925
5084759,3,B007G4X7VC,"This could have been a great series if the storyline and characters were solid and stuck with their original plan, however, along the way an adulterous wife Tess (Leslie Hope) and indifferent son Lincoln (Joe Anderson) become driven to find a man (TV celebrity Dr. Emmit Cole) whom does not wish to be found, nor evidently, understood. In the first sight of tragedy or death, most normal people would flee back to civilization and open a route to and fro, or at least bring back more strength in guns, or personnel, to find the missing man. Instead, we get flighty characters that stay in an indigenous place ABC obviously depicts as a boogiemans paradise, and natives which appear more African than South American, that when given the opportunity, do not serve up the lost Americans, and others, with beans and jungle pork. At least in ""Welcome To The Jungle"" (2007), the jumping camera manages to show body parts and human sacrifices of the sexually charged and stupid young.

Note the Blair Witch method of the face on the tent on disc 2. I did like the stories of the dolls, the ghostly kidnappers and the evil spirit, whom seemed to be only a ""jeanie in a bottle"" and tossed overboard, there are some notable horrors here, but as Bruce Greenwood gets more maniacal and his ever searching wife wants her mentally deranged family glued back together, I began to not care for these people anymore. Blinded by some reaction to a jungle chemical, its incredible how these people are convinced to linger on in a place where they are completely clueless where it ends and the pretty lone blonde daughter, Lena (Eloise Mumford) forfeits her opportunity to leave and remain with this insane venture. There is enough cameras and equipment on one ship to retreat with a few seasons of successful horror, but until the camera is dropped and blood filters the camera lenses with screams of an unfinished story, you really don't care what happens anymore. Films today seem to think that an unfinished painting is more successful and appealing than a finished one. The missing Dr. at one point contradicts himself by scolding his camerman in filming a ceremony, yet why he cannot see that his very presence as a scientist and observer might somehow rile the natives to suspicion and even anger, makes no sense at all. This is what tells us that writers ran out of ideas and this is why I lost interest in ""LOST"" when it aired and stopped watching it. It just went on and on and got more and more ridiculous.",1341878400,3,2497,4.687927107061504
5084760,4,B007G4X7VC,"It's not uncommon that shows like The River get canceled; TV networks always say they want Sci Fi/horror TV shows, but they always seem to lose faith in them between paying for them and airing them. This unfortunately leads to a great many cult shows all of which are highly involved, require you to watch from episode one in order to keep up and usually they end with an unfulfilled cliffhanger ending. This has resulted in many people avoiding them because they know that if they like the show they will most likely never see a resolution to the storyline.

I am writing this review in order to let you know that you won't be unsatisfied with The River. While the story is formatted in such a way that it obviously still has unresolved plot points and does have a storyline they were intending to continue, the producers of the show seemed to approach it like an author does a book in a series so this 8 episode season has a begin, middle and end, it just happens that it is part of a larger story. Never fear, you will learn the fate of Dr. Emmet Cole.",1341792000,3,1055,4.355329949238579
5084761,5,B007G4X7VC,This series is quite good. I really like the suspense it has and how it has a lot of lore in it. I would definitely recommend it to others.,1341705600,,139,3.8275862068965516
5084762,5,B007G4X7VC,"The River took me by surprise and by the end of this non-stop entertaining trip, I didn't want it to let me go.

With the first episode throwing you into the story, it's hard to warm up to the series, but by episode 3 I was hooked.

The characters, though some may call cliche, all had their own unique personality and added different dimensions to the story.

What really sold me on the series is the ""mockumentary-style"" that it is shot. I eat this stuff up so badly. With movies like Cloverfield and Quarantine being two of my all-time horror favourites, this was a complete treat for me.

At times the work seems derivative of others. One episode seems inspired by Quarantine and 28 Days Later, another seems inspired by the Exorcist, another inspired by the Blair Witch Project. For me, it was not bothersome. The River still felt entirely original whether or not I could see other movie references and inspiration within it.

If you're a fan of horror and suspense or even of the ""mockumentary-style"", definitely check out this television series.

I wish they would continue with the series and make a second season, but something tells me that is not going to happen.

It's not everyone's cup of tea, but if it is, you will definitely want to refill your cup over and over again with The River.",1341360000,9,1301,4.606060606060606

But the story line, the production values - which incidentally are well below par - and the other disappointing aspects of this production are only one opf the annoying aspects of this waste of money. I KNOW what the ""bad"" four letter words are for pete's sake but hey this is an adult series and I get really annoyed when the producers or censors or whomever decide whats best for me  ( at my age) by not only ""bleeping"" the said words with a loud annoying and frustrating sound - but now also blur the mouths of those saying them so I cant lip read the offensive (to some) expletives!! Now I pay a full price for a complete film - by doing this kind of thing not only am I buying an incomplete production, but my intelligence is being insulted by the producers.
If production houses are going to do this kind of thing in future I suggest its up to the retailer to advertise the product as ""incomplete and heavily censored"" and to discount the product accordingly! It should then be over to the retailer to deal with the issue with their supplier!",1338681600,8,1286,4.270491803278689

5084772,1,B007G4X7VC,"I went into this with high hopes, but the pilot episode was a huge let down. The entire 'hanging dolls' scene in the forest was obviously a direct ripoff from 'Blair Witch', and too many of the 'shock' moments were due less to compelling suspense than to the usual clichs attributed to this genre.

The absolute worst moment came in the season finale, with the shooting of one of the main characters. The plot of the show involves the fact that there are 3-5 cameras in every room on the ship, but apparently everybody on board seems to have forgotten that they could just check the tapes to see exactly who it was who did the shooting. Of course, that would have meant there was no 'mystery' to fill out the episode.

I can't imagine this going to a second season (most of the first season seemed like 'filler' as it was); and if it does, I certainly won't be among it's viewers.",1335052800,5,880,4.392638036809816

However, this product deserves one star, if any, for the following reason: ABC is releasing the Season 1 DVD while at the same time it is considering canceling the show! If you buy this DVD, you could have a story with no ending. You will be stuck at the climax and you will never know how the series ends or how the footage is found. To me, that is a waste of money for consumers and a money making scheme by the studio.
