8511736,4,B0077ERNSO,"This is the English video ""The Best of Elmo"" dubbed over completely in Spanish.
Look at the original version on Amazon to see hundreds of reviews.
Some of the footage is old, from the 80's, but Sesame Street never goes out of style.
Elmo visits with Ernie, Telly, Big Bird and Snuffy.
He chats with Whoopi Goldberg about different skin color and hair types.
Excellent immersion Spanish lesson for my two year-old.",1356998400,3,413,4.75
