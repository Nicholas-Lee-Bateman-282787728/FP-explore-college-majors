8636987,4,B0000TLAA0,"This DVD is great. Rich goes through making a great animated logo in lightwave and then After Effects. He shows shortcuts and problem fixes. The after effects part is especially helpful and interesting. I learn a lot from this dvd and will get the rest. This really gets 5 starts from me, it's just seems a little pricey, though you can make some money back once you ebay it. Highly recommended!",1085097600,4,395,4.577464788732394
