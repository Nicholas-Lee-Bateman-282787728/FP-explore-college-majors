3843655,5,B002436WH6,This is a great show!  I have been watching since season one and so has my oldest daughter (who is eight years old).  We were both deeply saddened by the rumors and tabloid exposure that they have had about their personal life.  We only wish them all the best.  They have given their children experiences that they would never have been able to have if they would not have agreed to doing this show.  The show has even given our family ideas of places to go and different things to do.  We plan on taking our children (we have 4) to try our hand at pottery/ceramics painting (which Kate took all the girls to in one of the shows). We will still continue to watch the show and look forward to purchasing the next DVD that comes out.  Hang in there Gosselins!,1243296000,8,757,4.288732394366197
3843656,5,B002436WH6,"With all the publicity for the show, I recently started watching.  It's been fascinating to see how their lives have changed since season 1.

3843681,5,B002436WH6,Love this series!!!!! As the series continued though it seemed like they were all about publicity and not so much about being a family and doing things together. Classic sign of fame getting to a families head!!!!!,1372723200,,214,4.8108108108108105
3843682,5,B002436WH6,"If you liked the DVD ""Big Changes"", you'll love this one too.  A continuation of Big Changes, it's just as enjoyable as the first.",1368403200,,130,4.416666666666667
3843683,5,B002436WH6,"I loved this DVD of Season 4 Part 1 because it has the episode ""Slopes, Sleds & Sesame"" which I've been searching for on Youtube forever. So I was very happy to find that and also other episodes I've been wanting to see for awhile. That's why it gets 5 stars.",1357603200,,259,4.098039215686274

3843685,5,B002436WH6,"My daughter has been in to Jon & Kate since they first came on tv, and even now that they aren't together anymore she still likes to watch the old episodes. She loves them, I don't know if she has a preference of past seasons dvd's, she has all of them and it seems like she watches them equally, I think she likes this one because they get the puppies on one of the episodes and she loves dogs. I've read some of the reviews on the Jon and Kate dvds some saying how they noticed tension between Jon & Kate, lets face it, Kate has always been bossy from the beginning, maybe adults tend to over analyze, I don't think a kid is going to notice any difference from these episodes as compared to the earlier episodes.
