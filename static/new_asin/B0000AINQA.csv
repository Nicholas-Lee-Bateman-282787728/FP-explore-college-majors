1906422,2,B0000AINQA,"Be warned, this edition is cut!, almost at the end of the movie, almost five minutes of the film are out of it...

The image is better than the other edition that you can buy, but don't expect a Citizen Kane restoration...

The only pro about this edition is the restoration of the original opening credits (the other edition has a collage of pictures instead of it)

I hope Vanguard Cinema exchange this DVD for one uncut.",1101945600,16,423,4.467532467532467
1906423,3,B0000AINQA,"___This is Cantiflas at his best with a strong performance by Joaqun Pardav and the rest of the cast.
___But there is not much  else in this DVD, the images are not even cleaner than what you would get on a regular VHS tape, though frequently better image quality is seen on broadcast TV. The extra material is scant and not worth the effort of looking for it. The English subtitles are not the best but are not terrible.
___Also, the original movie came out without any music except for a quick-paced tune at the opening and closing credits. Here this tune is switched for a danzn and the original credits with cartoon illustrations are also changed for pictures of Cantinflas.
___The worst thing is that in every funny moment, there has been added a music track to ""enhance"" the joke as in Televisa's Chespirito show. This just breaks the original movie's pace and charm. It is just plain annoying to be shown when one has to laugh in a Cantinflas movie as this is unnecessary.
___Whoever (someone without a sense of humor) thought it possible to improve such a great Cantinflas movie just made it loose some of its luster. Hopefully one day there will be a serious DVD production and treatment of all the movies made in the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema. Currently most of such releases are very bad, of poor quality and only the movies themselves save them from being a zero star and a waste of money.",1082332800,32,1404,4.549407114624506
1906424,5,B0000AINQA,"This film is considered to be one of the best comedy's ever done in Mexico. the story revolves around the confusion between a dog named Bobby and a gangster with the same name, and the series of confusions that arise as a result. This was the film that made Cantinflas one of Mexico's greatest stars, with a great story, as well as a great cast which includes Joaquin Pardave, Sofia Alvarez, and hilarious dialogue, this is easily one of the best films ever made in Mexico.",1039824000,5,473,4.511627906976744
1906425,4,B0000AINQA,"For those who understand Spanish and want to laugh a lot, but really a lot shouldn't miss this movie. Ahi esta el Detalle joins two of the greatest mexican stars of the golden movie era of that country:Mario Moreno( Cantinflas), the unique ""mimo"" and Sara Garcia, this unforgettable actress who became  the "" granny"" of Mexico. Of course, she is quite young in this movie. I can't forget either Joaquin Pardave, other incredible mexican comedian who makes a gorgeus caracterization of a jealous husband. I will  resume that, in spite of this picture is very old,actually keeps its freshness as one of the finest comedies I ever saw",997920000,9,631,4.833333333333333
1906426,1,B0000AINQA,towards the end it begins to skip parts of the movie. I had to explained to my wife what she was missing. Very upset for that!,1402444800,,126,3.8846153846153846
1906427,5,B0000AINQA,This movie is so incredible funny and do not know I many times I have watch it and still laugh a lot.,1395446400,,101,3.6363636363636362
1906428,5,B0000AINQA,"This early Cantinflas film is probably his best. He turns logic upside-down, and it's a laugh a minute.  English subtitles don't do the dialouge justice, but one can just watch it and ""get the drift"". Viva Cantinflas!",1377993600,,217,4.864864864864865

1906431,2,B0000AINQA,"I gave this two stars to go along with the other two reviewers who have this version, because if it is a cut version, then that would be a tragedy. This was the first Cantinflas movie I saw, and so far no other Cantinflas movie comes close. Ahi Esta el Detalle is an excellent film.",1235779200,3,282,4.1454545454545455
1906432,1,B0000AINQA,"Today is July `5th, and amazon sent me an email saying that the last day my movie was going to be delivered was July 7th. I haven't seen any movie and I am pretty mad right now. Not to say that there is no phone number in the site to call customer service, I seek for help in the site but there was no link that said something like ""Lost packages"". I don't know... Know I paid good 20 bucks for a movie that i don't think ill see in a long time",1184457600,,444,3.78494623655914
1906433,2,B0000AINQA,"I love this film, it is one of my favorites!  However this edition is cut short near the end.  It also does not have the subtitles that Amazon is indicating.",1157587200,8,157,4.2
1906434,4,B0000AINQA,I love all Cantinflas movies. They make me laugh a 1000 times a minute. Ahi esta el detalle is one of Mario Morenos best movies. But I'd have to agree with some of the other reviews that the DVD version isn't that great at all. It still captures alot of the great moments but they cut out a lot of stuff. Like the wedding ceremony and little parts throughout the dvd. At first I thought my dvd was skipping.=P Maybe someday someone will remake this dvd to contian the whole film without any editing. Id get the vhs over this but its still worth having in any format.,1107302400,6,566,4.25
1906435,3,B0000AINQA,"I always liked this movie and considered it one of the best made by Cantinflas.  As far as a movie goes I give it five stars. But the DVD quality is terrible (one star.)  The sound and image are bad.  The VHS version that I own is much much better, cleaner and clearer . The DVD version also has been cut and is missing a considerable portion of the ""wedding ceremony.""",1106956800,15,369,4.169014084507042

However, as another commenter has noted, this film is missing crucial scenes. There is a six minute sequence missing at 1:20 that makes the plot hard to follow, as well as other important snippets at 1:33. Please fix this!",1504569600,,315,4.943396226415095
