8646348,5,B0020KOJFU,"David Curtis really shares a lot of information and covers a lot of ground in this plein aire oil painting video..  There are 2 demonstrations of boats and two of landscapes.  He works fast and describes his objectives and techniques clearly and concisely.  He starts on location with a blank canvas and shares his strategy, mixing of color and you see his technique and brush work from start to finish.",1366848000,7,403,4.728571428571429
