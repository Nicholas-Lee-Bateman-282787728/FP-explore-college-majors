8478602,5,B005LVH47U,"This little documentary lives up to its title and then some. There definitely is heart, of the men and women of the 501st and the filmakers. It is a  very interesting look into the community of stormtroopers and other characters who use their passion for star wars to selflessly bring smiles to the faces of both young and old. This is most certainly a film you will have to watch if you're interested in joining the 501st and/or feel like shedding some tears. I wasn't able to keep it together during the Stafford scenes.",1465257600,,522,4.553191489361702
