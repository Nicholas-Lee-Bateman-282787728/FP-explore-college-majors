7873520,1,6304523955,"I received the Mystery Trooper DVD and started watching it two days ago.  Chapters 6 and 7 were unwatchable. I cleaned the disc, but was still unable to watch the finish of chapter 6 and for chapter 7 the screen stayed black and I had to restart the DVD again. I moved on to Chapter 8 , which seemed to start okay, but by then I had lost interest in Mystery Trooper.  I would not recommend purchasing this DVD.",1424304000,2,410,4.177215189873418

Douglas, continuity and dialogue by Carl Krusada...the cast includes Robert Frazer (Jack Logan), Blanche Mehaffey (Helen Holt), Buzz Barton (Billy Holt), Charles King (Mack), Al Ferguson (Jean Gregg), William Bertram (Chief Red Eagle), White Cloud (White Cloud-the wild horse), Lafe McKee (Frank Holt), William Von Brincken (mounted police inspector), Henry Rocquemore (Logan's Boss), Harry Beery (henchman), Dick Dickinson (henchman), Tom McGuire (George Romero)....special footnote, actor Charles King is about the best part of this 10 Chapter Serial, his presence in every scene gets an A plus in the villain department, and King isn't called ""Blackie"" like most of his B-Westerns....meanwhile back to our Guaranteed Serial which is always good till the last drop and this serial is no exception...there is a great deal of entertainment here for the cliffhanger fans out there...all courtesy of VCI Entertainment, who in my humble opinion is the best there is in restoring early serials and features.
