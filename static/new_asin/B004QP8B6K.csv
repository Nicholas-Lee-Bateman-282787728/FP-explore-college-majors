4453147,5,B004QP8B6K,"This films tackles the many questions surrounding the hype around the 2012 phenomenon. It gives the opinions of many well respected people within the realm of 2012. It goes beyond the media's sensationalist perspectives, and offers an in depth analysis of what people can REALLY expect come 2012. Cheyene is a great filmmaker, and this is just a testament to the talen he has both as a writer, but as a filmmaker as well!",1303171200,,421,4.702702702702703
4453148,4,B004QP8B6K,"At first I was skeptical of watching the film since previous documentaries on the subject left me with more questions then answers.  2012 Prophecy is a well thought out film, that captures the topic and gets to the heart of the issue. If you are interested in the topic i highly recommend it.",1302912000,,292,4.509433962264151
4453149,5,B004QP8B6K,"I watched hundreds of movies on this subject, and this one is the best! Why? What's the difference between this one, and thousands of others? Because I got the answer to my question! My question was 'Will the world end in 2012?' and this movie gave me clear and specific answer.

So if you want to know secrets about 2012 Apocalypse, don't watch any other movie until you watch this.",1302825600,,383,4.4714285714285715
4453150,5,B004QP8B6K,"Riveting documentary, filmmaker Shaahin Cheyene really did an amazing job on this one!  His films really make us think.  I like using films like this in my classroom to stimulate critical thinking skills. I highly recommend this to anyone, but particularly educators who are looking for a documentary that hits all the state and national standards while interesting kids by a high tech visual approach!",1302825600,,402,5.1692307692307695

Surprised to see how well it was shot and how informative the interviews were. You will look at the ""2012"" phenomenon differently after you see it. Definitely worth seeing.",1302825600,,282,4.549019607843137
4453152,5,B004QP8B6K,"Amidst all the addictive hysteria, superstition, and hyperbolic arguments about what the truth surrounding 2012 is, we finally have the opportunity to learn from an Aztec himself - and other experts - about what 2012 represents, which is nothing but a new beginning, a change, a movement that we are already seeing and experiencing in our lives and current times. This film is brutally humble and honest, refreshing to those who decide to watch it and to those tired of the sensationalist representation of the truth around 2012 in common widespread media, filled with wisdom that transcends ethnicity and speaks to all of us as human beings.

Real change occurs from within, being true to and understanding and embracing oneself, liberating oneself from fear - from the obstacles that prevent us from being who we are fully - and living fully, while accepting life's challenges and opportunities to grow and learn. One cannot change unless one accepts and sees it as an opportunity to better oneself. And this is true individually but also collectively. While individual change can sometimes be a long and hard process, collective change is often a slower and harder process, merely because there are a lot more forces resisting it, whether it is due to fear, interests, or other motives. Change has been resisted for as long as humanity exists, and in a world where we depend so greatly on malfunctioning economies and practices, it is not hard to understand how hard it seems for some of us to let go of even those aspects of our collective and social makeup that we know are not working. Not knowing what could happen if we let go, or what could happen to our safety if we even tried to oppose the forces of resistance, brings fear, which continuously brings us sadder and more scared. But fortunately, we know that 1) we have the power to change things, and 2) that the pain is greater if we don't embrace and become the inevitable and continuous process of change.

Change and betterment is what we want for our children but yet we sometimes have a hard time wanting to be and being such change, becoming one of the factors that will resist the change that we promised to our children and that they will not hesitate to demand for ourselves. We have come to a point where more and more people on this Earth are demanding a change, and more and more people are willing to be such change. But there are still forces (governments, corporations, religion, conservative thought) preventing it. The time has arrived, and such inevitable and imminent transformation can no longer be ignored. This is what this film is about and what the Aztecs foresaw happening in our current days.

Change is transformation, and transformation is what the Aztecs refer to and speak of 2012. The message of the Aztecs is a message of new beginnings, of ""New Year""-like optimism and discerning growth of the human society as a whole, of growth towards healing, respect, balance, awareness, sharing and integration. It is not hard to believe that we - western societies - would ignore such message and instead would fabricate a new one of destruction, pain, and fear around it, for we bath in fear and equate destruction with peace. But this film reminds us that any culture's psychological makeup can and has to change, as our own individual one, for this global change in the way we understand and go about doing things is clearer, louder, and more evident every day.

This film and message back up the real, obvious, steadily growing and leading force for change that is already defining a new era, a new social, economical, cultural, and environmental model in our societies. Like any other process of change, it does not happen from night to day. It is a long process but has already started, and it is one that will continuously move towards its intended direction. I guess that 12/21/2012 signifies, according to the Mayan Calendar, an important moment in this change. Let's be positive and welcome this new beginning!",1302825600,,4006,4.809869375907112
4453173,5,B004QP8B6K,"I'm generally a pretty conservative guy and I don't necessarily go for a lot of New Age hype, so when I read some of the other reviews, I was prepared to be underwhelmed.  In viewing this film with an open mind, however, I was pleasantly surprised at both the message and the presentation.  To me, the central theme of this film was the need to divorce ourselves from the fear and hyperbole associated with 2012 and examine our world in terms of what our times are likely to produce and how we can respond and adapt to the changes that are coming.  This is a film about the need for personal transformation at a time when the foundations of our current world order are being shaken.  From an objective standpoint, I honestly haven't seen any solid scientfic evidence that 2012 is going to usher in a global catastrophe.  Having said this, I think anyone who is in tune with current political, social and economic events can see that we are on the cusp of significant changes.  I appreciated the exploration of the Aztec and Mayan historical perspectives about the times we live in and I found the film-maker's message to be a positive one.  I also thought the editing and production values were excellent.
  If you are looking at the next several months from a position of fear, I think you will benefit from this film.  If you are looking to expand your perspectives on what the future holds, you will enjoy this film.  If you are looking for advice on long term food storage and firearm selection for the coming Apocalypse, you will be disappointed.",1303344000,3,1551,4.583333333333333
4453174,4,B004QP8B6K,"The main message of 2012 Prophecy is for people to pay attention to what matters most at a time when many of us realize that continuing to do things in the interest of short-term profits can't continue without terrible consequences. Central to this film are comments made by medicine man Miktlan Ehekateotl Kuahtlinxan, who reassures us that the Tetzkatlipoka view 2012 as a beginning, not as an end. Without many specifics regarding exactly what we might expect to see during this long-prophesized turning of a 5,215 year calendar cycle, this film leads the audience to view modern society and ways of life through eyes of ancient indigenous wisdom.

I love the way 2012 Prophecy points out the importance of love and compassion and kindness as the way forward. 2012 Prophecy includes wonderful footage of modern day Aztecs living in modern times, while retaining the core values central to humanity that humans appreciate most in all cultures around the world. I greatly enjoyed the inspirational interviews with Miktlan Ehekateotl Kuahtlinxan and Elena Avila in 2012 Prophecy, speaking about what we can expect at this time of tremendous transformation and change.",1303344000,,1167,5.174603174603175
4453175,5,B004QP8B6K,"Are the people who cite the Book of Revelation and claim that 2012 is the year the world will end correct? This film, which is eye-opening, thought-provoking, and made with striking and interesting images, offers the teachings of the ancient Aztecs and Mayans on the doom of civilization through a ""keeper of the ancient tradition,"" an Aztec Medicine Man. The Medicine Man agrees that December 21, 2012 is a significant date, but not because it is the day the world will end. His people, he explains, understood that the world develops in cycles. December 21, 2012 is the end of one cycle and the beginning of another. It is a time of change, a time of opportunity for improving one's self and the world, if only people would accept the science of his people.

 The Aztecs and Mayans, he states, foresaw that Europeans would invade their land, destroy their culture and their harmony with nature, and obliterate their civilization and environment. Mexico, which was once a verdant paradise, has been polluted. Mexico City today, he says, is the most polluted city in the world. Having foreseen the upheaval, the ancients made sure that certain wise men would go underground, and pass on and retain their culture. Now after 468 years, the Medicine Man has disclosed who he is and wants to share his people's science. People need to realize, he says, that 2012 is a time of change in physical, human, and social conditions. Those who understand this and who can change will prosper and grow. Those who cannot adjust will suffer. People must respect everything on earth for everything on earth is part of a single organism; harm done to one part, hurts everything else. People must learn more about themselves and the earth, develop themselves, and use the earth properly. They must rid themselves of fear, a cancer in today's societies, for the person who fears can be easily manipulated. The primary lesson is love, love for everything; for the one who loves the most is the one who wins.",1303344000,,1987,4.807017543859649
4453176,4,B004QP8B6K,"When I first watched this documentary I was surprised at how much artistry was in this production. I was expecting to see rough cuts of indigenous peoples from various backgrounds discussing why this 2012 is all nothing more than New Age hype. The cinematography is beautiful, the fluty soundtrack pleasing to the ear and there are many good quotes from a spiritual point of view.

There are many shots of Shaahin Cheyenne talking straight into the camera, other times you hear his soothing voice while a red loincloth-wearing young man silently twirls a batan in slo motion. I am not sure what this man is to represent, and there are many posed shots of red-painted people smiling, walking or just staring into the camera. This was the part I didn't care so much for, but this artistic aspect apparently is a Cheyenne trademark.

An English-speaking Aztecan medicine man, Miktlan Ehekateotl Kuahtlinxan, is the first person introduced, and he appears repeatedly throughout this production. He is one of 11 people in this short 45-minute documentary to tell the audience that 2012 is not the end of the world, but the beginning of a new one. No one needs to panic.
His words are repeated in different form by the others interviewed. One professor says there is no indication that 2012 is the end of the world, it's all New-Age hype, because he hasn't come across any such prophecies in Mayan hieroglyphics. Author David Pinchbeck says this prediction is based on a Mayan belief that a major astronomical event will take place fomenting great change. However, toward the end of the interviews the angle seems to lean more toward ""Kindness, Compassion Love"" and ""spiritual goodness"" and other more feel-good statements stressing communication, relationships and understanding the ways of our ancestors. Some people may be turned off by this.

Cheyenne stresses that not one person he spoke to talked about a worldly demise or great destruction for 2012. He does state, however, ""... what we anticipate to see in 2012 is a lot of social change, a lot of cultural change, a lot of economic change. Those who are there to embrace this change will really be in a position to flourish. However, those who don't embrace the change that may come in 2012 will unfortunately not survive."" (14:32) I stress the ""may come"" part here; we have been experiencing global change for several years now.

For those wanting a straight-forward, scientific proof that the world will not come to an end, these anticlimactic comments are lost in all the artistry. I have to admit that despite the beautiful photography and music, I was at first taken back by how much this production comes off as more of a poetic, artistic- spiritual production than a scientific documentary. The more I watched it, the more I liked it though as the real message that Cheyenne is telling us is that we need to listen to our indigenous people, we need to understand their ancient practices and their current culture. In the end he closes with the conclusion ""Why do they want people to be scared? Because when people are scared, they are more easily manipulated.""

So, in conclusion, yes, this is a very good production but I hesitate to call this a documentary. If you are looking for dramatic, scientific proof that the world is not coming to an end in 2012, look elsewhere. If, however, you are looking for deeper meaning to why there is such hype about 2012, this is very well done and will make you reflect on contemporary society.",1303344000,,3494,4.826377295492487
4453177,1,B004QP8B6K,"I was touched to have been selected to review this movie based on my many Amazon reviews. But being in my 6th decade, I have to confess that I have heard much of the message of ""2012 Prophecy: Change, Apocalypse and The End Of The World?"" before. A new age is about to dawn where human beings will be at peace, regaining lost knowledge that brings healing and allows them to live in harmony with the universe. Utopia, this time around, comes not from the hippy mantra ""Sex, drugs and rock and roll' but from understanding that 2012 is not an Aztec prediction of the end of time, but the beginning of an era time of transformation.

The film's main character is a self-styled medicine man who claim to ""bring a message from the past."" There are many shots of him praying, chatting amiably with women, hugging children, and the like. I have no way of telling whether his message (that 2012 will not be the end of history) is worth listening to, or is just the embodiment of a self-serving prophet looking to cash in on the worries of some gullible Norde Americanos. Not to mention that the Aztecs are an odd choice for the new peace-loving race of healers. They were a warrior people who conquered those around them and demanded tribute. They also practiced large-scale human sacrifice as part of their religious observances.

The film's production values were generally good, with shots of loin-cloth-clad natives re-enactors in facepaint, a soundtrack drench in of flutes and drums, and shots of beaches, sunsets and mountains. But some edges were showing. One interview, with a Greek Orthodox priest (not the kind of person prone to New Age chatter) seems to have been edited to support the film's theme. Another interview suffers from allowing the green screen to show. And the film's 50-minute length and lack of content made it seem like an extended infomercial.

Thanks for the free movie, but I can't really recommend ""2012"" to anyone. Sorry.",1303257600,11,1948,4.757396449704142
4453178,5,B004QP8B6K,"Shaahin Cheyene has written, produced and directed this reassuring and illuminating film that is a very quiet and simple manner shares the wisdom of the Mayans, the Aztecs and all indigenous peoples about the secret of the year 2012. In this beautifully photographed homage to humanity he has gathered several great minds, including renowned Aztec medicine man Ehekateotl, to offer a different connotation to the year and the day the world at large feels is the apocalypse.  What this sublimely spiritual film shares is the secret of the Mayan calendar date not as a time to fear  but instead as a time for change.  2012 is the end of a cycle, a cycle that has been poisoned with greed, the 'hunter' mentality, conquest, economic evils, and disturbing of the ecological balance.

The Mayans  or Aztecs view humanity as a single organism and as such foster kindness, compassion, and love - caring for each other, providing food and shelter in the most basic manner in harmony with the universe.  Instead of the date in December of 2012 as a time of apocalypse, the indigenous peoples see it as a cycle of darkness - darkness not as a fearful concept but as a time to shed the trappings of destruction imposed on the planet by the civilization now existing and a time for change.  Those who can accept change will survive and return to our roots celebrating the beautiful darkness that accompanies our entry and our exit form this life cycle and those who cannot accept change will perish.

Through a series of interviews not only with Ehekateotl but with others as well - including Shaahin Cheyene - coupled with images of nature, of indigenous peoples dancing and healing with holistic methods and inspiring ceremonies, birds in flights, plants and skies, the film gently encourages the viewer to stop dreading 2012 as the end of the world and instead to anticipate CHANGE into a world in harmony, both by finding the harmony within ourselves and by extending that harmony to every living thing.  'Surrender what we are to what we can become.' This is a film that would appeal to everyone and one that should be purchased and then shared with family and friends, preparing for this new cycle.

4453179,4,B004QP8B6K,"DISCLAIMER: I was asked to review this film, and was given a password that allowed me to view it at no charge.

I watched ""2012 Prophecy"" one day after watching the new Blu-ray of ""Network"". These films are not as far-removed from each other as you might think. Both are jeremiads, the former being decidedly more-restrained and less pessimistic.

There have been several TV documentaries on the supposed apocalypse (which, by the way, means an uncovering or unfolding, not destruction) awaiting us at the ""end"" of the Mayan calendar in 2012. A few have been sober analyses; most have been irresponsible ""info porn"", designed to titillate the viewer.

This is one of the sober ones. It repeatedly states that the Mayan calendar marks the end of a ""sun"" (era), and that a new and different era will follow. The principal narrator (Shaahin Cheyene) emphasizes that change and disaster are common to all eras, and the current one is no different.

The film then becomes a promotion for its producers' world view -- that Western civilization is excessively exploitative and destructive; that personal relationships are more important than material possessions; that most of the world's problems stem from bad or misdirected values. Unless you're Bernie Madoff, it's hard to disagree with this.

Most of the people interviewed /do/ feel the Mayan calender is tuned into some ""cosmic vibration"", and the change in ""suns"" will include signficant (and generally favorable) alterations in society, economics, and human thought -- but not Roland-Emerich mass destruction.

Some viewers will see this film as no more than the blather of modern hippies. Most of the interviewees seemed, to me, to be sober, serious folk trying to encourage people to reconsider their lives.

""2012 Prophecy"" touched on a number of things I've been thinking about recently, and kicked me (a bit) to consider where my life is headed. It's worth at least one viewing.",1303257600,,1935,5.085173501577287

4453181,3,B004QP8B6K,"If you go to a bookstore you're likely to see lots of books about 2012 in the New Age/Occult/Spiritual section.
Of course it's easy to see why there are so many books on this topic, with 2012 being only a year away.

With this documentary, by interviewing an actual Aztec medicine man and other scholars, it is revealed that 2012 has more to do with natural change than utter chaos.

Although this film is only about 50 minutes long, I felt that it could have been even shorter. Towards the beginning I recall a part where there was nothing but music and a mix of images and scenes that, although in keeping with the Aztec theme, didn't really add to the main subject of 2012.
Another scene that could have been left out was where the medicine man makes a statement along the lines of ""before the Europeans came, Mexico had the cleanest air in the world"". I'm sure if you talked to some Pacific islanders from way back when they'd probably tell you the exact same thing.

As mentioned before, one of the primary sources for this video is an Aztec medicine man, but I would have liked to hear more about why they chose that particular one. Was it because he was the only one they could find who could speak English? The medicine man himself stated that there are others like him scattered throughout. If so, why not interview more than just one? It's like using a GPS. If you only have 1 satellite, you aren't going to be very accurate, if you use 3, that's a little better. Use 5 and your GPS is much more likely to reflect where you actually are. Interviewing a couple more medicine men would have made this documentary far more convincing.

I personally have never had much interest or fear about the whole 2012 thing, but for those that are still on the fence or lack any sort of opinion on the matter, I still recommend this short film as I'm convinced it does comes across as more clear-headed than many of the other voices on this subject.",1303257600,6,1945,4.424581005586592

Unlike most other films and books on this topic, he focuses much-needed attention on what we can do to raise our spiritual energy, creating protection and safety for ourselves in the coming years. I recommend this film highly.",1303171200,,534,5.294117647058823
8438431,3,B004QP8B6K,"I will begin by telling you what the documentary 2012 Prophecy Change, Apocalypse and the End of the World is not. It is not an end-of-the-world disaster movie. Nor is it an in-depth study of the Mayan calendar and how it relates to the upcoming, long-awaited, sometimes dreaded date of December 21, 2012. For this reason, I feel the name of the film is somewhat misleading and perhaps was used in order to take advantage of the current hype surrounding the predictions for next year.

That said, the message Iranian-born filmmaker Shaahin Cheyene seems to be trying to share is that modern man has been progressively destroying the planet on which he lives. This is not a new thought, nor is it a wrong one. How this applies to the title of the film is what leaves me perplexed. Spiritual goodness, love, a strong emphasis on building relationships rather than war are the main topics.

Finding ""god"" within yourself is another. Most of us would agree with many of the comments that are stated here, but this is certainly not a new concept. I would describe it as a remake of the late 60s and early 70s ""love and peace"" movement; a slightly different approach but basically the same message.

At some point the topic of holistic medicine is interjected, most likely because Shaahin Cheyene is an herbalist and is the creator of Herbal Ecstasy products. Again, I could not understand the connection between herbal medicine and the end of the world, so it motivated me to Google Mr. Cheyene's name. You can do the same and perhaps draw your own conclusions as to why he would include it in this documentary.

Going back to the film, it is stated that it is the ""white man's"" interpretation that 2012 will mark the end of times, that it is a New Age concept, and it is being hyped by mainstream media. I don't disagree entirely with that. Mainstream media will certainly make the big bucks these next few months, playing on our superstitions, curiosity, and fears. But I would have to include Shaahin Cheyene in that group since he has drawn us into his film with a title that would suggest that we are going to learn something new about what to expect on December 21, 2012. We do not.

I will give the film credit for great cinematography and a nice selection of music. Somebody put a great deal of effort into that. We see artistic and candid clips of current day people and animals, the setting most often in Mexico City where it is suggested that some people are descendants of the ancient Aztecs. We also see clips of what the indigenous people (Aztecs) would have looked like. However, knowing what we do from history of the violent and ungodly nature of the Aztecs, I found myself wondering how Mr. Cheyene could use them as an example of wise and spiritual people.

And so what DOES this documentary say about 2012? Mr. Cheyene presents us at the beginning of the film with a man named Miktlan Ehekateotl Kwauhtlinxan who claims to be the last of a long line of ""healers"" or medicine men and who is the carrier of the ancient tradition. This man brings a ""message"" from his people and the ""truth"" about 2012. He is a main focal point of the film. At the film's conclusion, this medicine man finally gives us his prediction; 2012 will not signal the end of the world, but rather a period of change, the end of a cycle, a transformation.

At the very end of the film (after the credits and perhaps where some viewers will have already turned off the film), a clip is shown of a white man, obviously a believer in Christ evidenced by his T-shirt, carrying a sign and warning us that the book of Revelation in the Bible foretells the apocalypse and that he believes it will occur in 2012. Considering the entire content of Mr. Cheyene's documentary which totally disagrees with this thought, I can only assume that the filmmaker intended for this clip to poke fun at the ""white man's"" foolishness. I would have to say, however, that the book of Revelation is a more in-depth study of history and prophecy than what has been pulled together for this film, which seems more a study in spiritual mysticism than presentation of facts.

In conclusion, I would say this film is worth watching for its beautiful cinematography and music. It is a ""peaceful"" piece of art. It is thought provoking. And as long as you don't expect anything profound or prophetic regarding 2012, you might enjoy it.",1305590400,,4389,4.603580562659847

8438433,5,B004QP8B6K,"This documentary is about 51 minutes long and appears to have been filmed mainly in Mexico as Aztec Medicine Man Ehekateotl of the Tetzkatlipoka Tradition passes a positive message to us.  2012 is NOT the end, but the beginning!

Throughout  the video, Ehekateotl explains that the Aztecs knew the Spanish were coming to kill them long ago.  After 468 years of hiding they have returned and are sharing what their culture always taught, that 2012 is merely the end of a cycle and the time of transition.  But many would like us to live in fear, because we become easier to control and conquer.  Many film clips provide reminders of past destructive elements. Ehekateotl also tells us the Mayans never said that 2012 would be the end of the world either.

The theme of the movie is to preserve, respect, and restore what we have--to live in love and gratitude--to let go of fear--to connect your heart, mind, and soul.

The slightly less than one hour time period is adequate for the subject.  The music is good, the sound and picture quality are good, and the messages the film conveys parallel my own beliefs.

Note that many believe 2012 is the end.  I even heard a friend's children say it.  The scary part was that they said it as if it was a done deal, an expectation.  The children were discussing it in school and brought the message to their dad while I was having lunch with the 3 of them.  Scary!",1304899200,,1406,4.527777777777778

Interviews, Aztec recreations and a little common sense give voice to ideas that aren't usually considered.

Aztec shaman Ehekateotl is the main interviewee, more like a witness who discusses the true meaning of the 2012 prophecies, and how they should be interpreted. In discussing this period of being a time of change and transformation he espouses that man should seek to live more in harmony with the natural order and let go of our fear. There are also supporting interviews from scholars, philosophers, and spiritual leaders.

He then blends and contrasts messages from ancient cultures with the prophecies of Western interpretations of the so-called apocalyptic year 2012 and renders a collage-view that strikes to the very heart of the myths and spiritual awakening that centers on the Mayan calendar's predictions about December 2012.

The film tells us that there is hope beyond the dire cataclysmic interpretations of Western men of knowledge, that there's a deeper cultural shock-wave-effect happening within the planet's very soul, from its ecology to man's destructive and war-like tendencies to conquer and master all he sees and grasps. The director focuses his views that ancient traditions, beliefs and ""medicine"" about the process of the world's evolution through time will come full-circle to reveal the need for humanity's necessary, basic change of outlook from war-mongering, fear-laden societies where people's beliefs are separated from their physical presence so that they can be ""manipulated and controlled"" by the power brokers of conquering nations, to days of hope, re-emergent religious and social societies throughout the world.

Shaahin Cheyene's masterpiece is full of striking images used to highlight focus with our common beliefs such as ""darkness is evil and a time of fear"", where the Aztecs and their philosophy views darkness as a time for reflection, peace and dream-states that allows us to come to grips with everyday reality in a positive way. There's the constant theme of war, destruction of the planet by human greed, avarice and especially Western culture's need to conquer all that it sees on the earth one way or another, even if it means getting it all by physically altering the landscape to reap its bounty of oil, natural gas, gold, chemicals and earth's natural gifts. The film maker contrasts all of that obliteration and destruction with the philosophies of peace, good will, understanding, love and honor, and man's inner soul of goodness and mercy so that we come away from the film with a sense of hope and understanding about the so-called ""end of the world or days"" in 2012.

The film maker is constantly using a flash-back technique to dramatize the important consequence of forgetting our roots in today's capitalistic-dominated existence, where the almighty dollar and man's conquest of the earth's resources is causing such widespread global change in the ecology and atmospheric phenomenons, change that the world could well do without. There's a recurring theme of an Aztec or Mayan warrior in ""Shaman-dress"" with colored, painted face and body, with head-dress and all the trappings of his race which keeps flashing in and out of the documentary's lens, a never-ending reminder of man's need for spiritual and religious thirst and rebirth. There's Guru Singh's take on man and his worldly possessions versus enlightenment that takes up a good part of the end of the film, and he stresses peace, love and inner beauty, while novelist and philosopher Dr. Tom Pinkson discusses man's need for a strong philosophical presence. David Wolfe and V. Rev. John Bakas lend more credence to a rebirth of our inner selves in the coming years, while others speak to the necessity of man's rekindling of the essential human qualities that society causes us to leave behind in a wake of materialism and wealth-craving.

The film maker himself becomes the chief narrator of the journey as the film progresses to delve deeper into human psyche and the marketing of ideas to strangle our creativity, religious beliefs, and contain our soul's very being so that we can be sold today's bill of goods: money, power, and conquering nature's bounties, ravaging the earth's atmosphere, sacred rivers, forests and trees and oceans, lakes and streams...at what cost? The sobering reality of a world in a dramatic sense of chaos is a constant reminder of how out of control the voyage of capitalism and economics of wealth and power in Western Civilization has become, and every time the images flash on screen to remind us of this fact there's a quick flash forward or backward to the Shaman's words of wisdom and solace, a calming voice in the trees and wind, floating down into our consciousness to remind us that there is hope and time to resurrect our lost souls, and all we have to do is look to the ancient cultures for guidance and resources.

It's interesting how Cheyene has grasped the complexities of the Mayan Calendar's so-called ""end of worlds"" prediction and explains it so easily and naturally, a view that is really the concoction of Western idealism, not what the Mayans' felt or thought when they constructed the many faceted viewpoints the calendar's secrets hold. The Mayan view is one of never-ending adaptation, change, and a blending of mankind with his surroundings and natural resources, where everything is in balance one way or another, not out of control like the Western eco-chaos has become as time has marched on and the world teeters on the brink of various kinds of annihilation, be it nuclear war itself or its derivatives, ecological catastrophe and failure of the world's key resources like our oceans, clean, clear waters from lakes, rivers and streams, or the hole in the atmosphere from pollution that gets larger every day.

The Mayan view is one of man's evolution in a spiritual way as much as his ability to be one with the universe, both inner and outer reaches of this idea, and they didn't and don't consider December, 2012 to be anything but a beginning of a new era, rather than the ""end of the world"" or anything like it. This 464-year-period of time that the calendar encompasses is merely a segment in their overall view of time and man and the universe, it turns out, and when it ends a new millennium begins, it's natures way and man's way of seeing the earth and the universe...it's simply another of the fallacies of Western Civilization that so-called experts have grasped the calendar's end to be the ""end of the world""...the Mayans didn't see it that way at all, the ancient cultures just saw the whole thing as segments and pieces of the puzzle of time, space, and the universe and how man fits into it all.

Overall the film is a stunning work, and well worth viewing for many reasons: historically it gives perspective to the Mayan Calendar; ecologically it shows man's place in the world is tenuous and fragile, not solid and firm like Madison Avenue paints our existence; spiritually the film gives another world's view of today's realities, and puts perspective where myth and magic might take us otherwise; most of all the film shows how the calendar has been twisted and re-wired to be something it's not by so-called popular beliefs, how it's so easy to interpret something good and positive into something negative and self-effacing.

From a film maker's view the author uses very striking contrasting techniques to jar our senses into graphing the ideas he charts, and it logically follows a pattern from myth, to interpretation from expert views, to solid conclusions based on historical facts and evidence. I found the 45-or-so minute work to be substantially solid content-wise, and entertaining and captivating at the same time as it unraveled the ""mystery"" of the Mayan Calendar, and sets us straight on the ways of the medicine man, the Shaman, the historical directives contained in the examples he gives us to draw our own conclusions from. The film is a fair test of the film maker's art, and a good reference for entertainment and a solid work with believable characters, testaments, and ideals.

Have a go at it, you'll find that Shaahin Cheyene's film is a nice departure from regular so-called documentary productions. It gives the whole genre a nice kick in the rear end, and stimulates parts of our psyches that sometimes gets left out of Hollywood productions. This one is down-home good medicine for the soul with a message for the nay-sayers on this planet they maybe don't want to hear.

8438436,5,B004QP8B6K,"I was pleased to receive this gift of a DVD from the writer/producer/director of the film, Shaahin Cheyene. I'm particularly interested in the theme of 2012 and have reviewed several books on this subject, so I thought that that was why he'd sent me the DVD and why he purported to be a big fan of my reviews. However, it turned out that he was a big fan of many, many others to whom he'd also sent the film! Oh, well, that's life!

Apparently, there exist several, perhaps many, other documentaries on this theme. I haven't seen any of these, so can't judge the one under review in relation to these others. There are certainly some excellent, informative books available about the subject that can do much to dispel our fears or at least apprehension about what is going to happen. But since many people are not avid readers, I feel that Shaahin Cheyene's documentary absolutely fills a need for expert, ""factual"" information on this awe-inspiring event (the progression of our planet from the one cycle or ""age"" to the next).

Though I feel that Cheyene could have provided us with even more complete information about the date December 21, 2012; for according to author Gregg Braden, this date not only marks the end of a 5,125-year cycle, as Cheyene states, but  this cycle in itself constitutes also the last fifth of an even greater cycle - our 25,625-year journey through the 12 constellations of the zodiac. We can thus understand how momentous this date is.

The forte of the film is that all those whom Cheyene chooses to let express their views are highly spiritual persons with inner wisdom and deep insight into the significance of the present period in the history of our Earth.

First we hear the wise words of the Aztec medicine man Ehekateotl (and see his sageness also from his eyes). He brings a message from the past, from his people - 2012 is not the end, just the beginning.

He explains that the Aztecs did not disappear but sent small groups into hiding in order to preserve their living legacies. These groups integrated with the Mexican people.

Several experts impart information to us (and here I would have appreciated our having been reminded of these persons' names each time they reappeared). We are told that we need not be alarmed about scientists informing us about solar activity that could provoke earth changes, since this solar activity has occurred for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. Also,  floods, fires, natural disasters and so on have also been occurring for thousands of years, so there is no need for us to focus unduly on the significance of the catastrophes we have recently been enduring.

(This is one of Barbara Hand Clow's theses in her book ""Catastrophobia"", and she also asserts that we all at a subconscious level have memories of past catastrophic events thus triggering a deep fear in us of perhaps unfounded future catastrophes. As far as I remember this fear was also referred to in the film.)

Cheyene stresses that neither the Mayans nor the Aztecs have claimed that 2012 was the end of times, but merely a time of major change, where we will have to make human, economic and social changes. Those who embrace this change will flourish, while others will not survive.

It is the end of one world cycle and the beginning of the next.

There is a change in the energy, a change of frequencies. Everything is vibration, and everything is one. We are moving towards a different consciousness about the nature of time.

We must embrace the teachings of the indigenous cultures who have always understood that the need to preserve and protect that which we are using. To preserve our health we need to use herbal/holistic medicines and treat the person as a whole, not just address the symptoms.

I was pleased to see that Ron Scolastico was one of those whose views were represented, having tried in vain for years to get hold of this wise author's books through the library system.

The Illuminati/Secret Government who control everything are mentioned but not by name.

This is a film about deep spiritual values. It is stressed that change is the essence of life - we must change and transform. We must focus on the power of appreciation, gratitude and blessing. One person says: ""The universe is within our hearts"". Another states: ""There is a God in us, and we must align ourselves with that God.""

This is a beautiful film both as regards the visuals, the music and the intrinsic message - that it all comes down to compassion and love. ""The one who loves the most wins"". The harmonious energy of Nature is not destructive - it reconnects people with their own being.

You must be the owner of your own path. You don't need a master or a guru but your own Self. Your intuition is your own personal God.

I understand this film to indicate that we are going through a time of deep transformation because transformation is necessary, since our civilization has been headed in the wrong direction. Following this time of transformation there can/will come a golden age.

I feel that Cheyene has chosen to present what he deemed to be an appropriate content for the general film-viewing public. The film hints at more esoteric interpretations but these are not specified in detail. More detailed (and also positive) information about what we can expect can be found in the channelled works of Patricia Cori and the Kryon books.

I strongly recommend that you buy this inspiring film.",1303603200,,5449,4.751059322033898
8438437,5,B004QP8B6K,"Is the world on the brink of destruction? Does the Mayan calendar indicate that the life will come to an end on 12/21/12? Are we living in the end times and is Biblical prophecy being fulfilled before our very eyes? Are we hovering on the brink of Armageddon? Whether you're a believer in any of the doomsday scenarios being bantered about or not one thing is certain, there is an ever increasing amount of uncertainty and fear being generated unlike anything I've previously experienced in my lifetime. As negativity multiples at quantum speed accompanied by social unrest, political upheaval and natural disasters some type of change or transformation appears to be on the not too distant horizon. The only question is exactly what is it that lies ahead?

Shaahin Cheyene's new documentary film `2012 Prophecy Change, Apocalypse And The End Of The World' approaches the 2012 angst from a positive perspective through the lens of a rather unique spiritual tradition. The spiritual tradition is that of the Aztec and its spokesperson is Miktlan Ehekateotl Kuauhtlinxan, a self described shaman or medicine man. Miktlan shares in the narration along with Shaahin Cheyene who also happens to be the writer, producer, and director of this film. Both will share what 12/21/12 may portend for the future and our continued existence on planet Earth. To survive we must change and that change is holistic in nature involving not only what we do and how we live, but how we think and who we are as well.

We are told that modern society has gone astray from the ancient wisdom that now resides primarily in the beliefs and practices of indigenous cultures. While they have lived in harmony with the environment for millennia we have exploited the Earth's resources in ways that cannot continue if we are to continue on. Much of what is presented here isn't new. But then truth is as old as time so simply because we have heard something before doesn't mean we don't need to hear it again. The ultimate message is we must be open to a transformation or we will cease to exist.

The presentation is not high tech by any means but I see that as a good thing. A film such as this is about delivering a substantive message, not provide entertaining escapism. There has been much too much of that for far too long. The passionate belief of Miktlan and Shaahin comes across as sincere and heartfelt in my opinion, providing a very personal, intimate atmosphere to the film that I found quite immensely appealing.

Whether all the discussion and apprehension over 12/21/21 is legitimate or nothing more than a lot of emotional hype who really knows? We'll just have to wait until then and see what happens. In the meantime the moment to re-evaluate who we are and how we live is always now. I thank Shaahin Cheyene and Miktlan for keeping me thinking and wondering about the meaning of life here in the present moment. Isn't that what it's all about?",1303603200,,2934,4.758349705304519
8438438,4,B004QP8B6K,"The ancient Mayans were great astronomers who created an accurate calendar tracking the years over an incredibly long period of time, but their calendar has an end date: December 21, 2012. Did the Mayans know something we don't and does this mean mankind is facing an imminent demise?  Most people have heard of the Mayan ""doomsday"" calendar and many have accepted the interpretation of this as signaling the end of time, or what Christians call ""the end of days"" or the Apocalypse.

But filmmaker Shaahin Cheyene assures us that 2012 is not the Apocalypse, but rather points to a time of change in our world. This change will be seen in the behavior of people and a growing transformation of society.

He tells us that the indigenous people of the planet have a better understanding of these cyclical shifts, since they are more tuned into nature and themselves, while modern society is focused on competition and acquiring things. And also, on fear. Forces, he tells us, are invested in keeping people scared so they can be easily manipulated, and the doomsday interpretation serves their interests. Native peoples, however, are better able to understand that 2012 is not the end of the world, but rather the beginning of a new era. To the Mayans it repesented only the end of a cycle.

The film begins with a self-described ""Medicine Man"" (with the tongue-twister name of Ehekateotl Kuahtlinxan) whose forefathers were the Aztecs who, he says, were forced underground after their lands were conquered by the Spanish. Their knowledge has not been lost, but has been handed down through generations, including an understanding of the cycles of the Maya, as shown in their calendar.

The film has nice visuals and the circular calendar sometimes appears as the narration goes on. I happen to have a beautiful carving in green stone of this calendar in my guest room/library, which I bought in Mexico more than 40 years ago. I had always thought of it as ""the Aztec calendar"" until all the recent buzz about ""the Mayan calendar"" which turns out to look a lot like my Aztec calendar. But I now understand that the Aztec calendar and the Mayan calendar have the same origins and the civilizations that flourished in the southern region of Mexico and Guatemala are related. In the film, the Medicine Man is, according to the narration, from the ""Mexica"" people (a  name for the people who inhabited the region of Mexico City when the Spanish arrived).  The film did not clarify the relationships between the various ancient and current indigenous people or the history of the calendar, but it is generally acknowledged that the Maya developed the concept of the Long Count that has a starting point and an ending point (3114 BC to 2012). The details of their calendar are complicated; there are plenty of good websites and books with information.

The film combines interviews with indigenous spokesmen, current authors (like Daniel Pinchbeck) and academic scholars, interweaved with filmmaker Cheyene speaking directly to us. This is presented against visuals of cities, historic events, scenes of Mexico, and re-creations of ancient peoples engaged in various activities. At times an eagle peers at us with orange eyes, and a peaceful scene of waves gently lapping against the beach appears while soothing background music enhances the effect. The film is nicely put together, but short on substance in support of its main thesis.

I watched the film after just finishing reading Lynne McTaggart's book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Field-The-Quest-for-the-Secret-Force-of-the-Universe/dp/006143518X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Field: The Quest for the Secret Force of the Universe</a>, in which she explores the concept of the ""zero point field"" which bathes the universe and fills the ""vacuum"" that is space. Based on the observation and speculation of a small group of non-mainstream scientists researching quantum effects, ""The Field"" is said to be a matrix of pure energy that, through its energy exchanges, connects everything in the universe and stores the memory of everything, past, present and future. It provides a scientific basis for those who can see the past or the future or travel in their spirit body to anywhere instantaneously.

I had to wonder: Does the arrival of 2012 mean increased shifting of our awareness, through changes in The Field, of powers within ourselves? Is it possible we don't need technology to connect us to each other over the vast area of our planet, and even beyond? No one can doubt that the Internet and social networks have played a major role in the political upheavals in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and the other countries of the Middle East. But can we humans regain our ability to connect with each other through nature, using the natural connection we've always had, the connection indigenous people have always used and understood? As the Medicine Man said in the film, we have to learn to pay attention to ourselves, to be ""an owner of your own life.""

Cheyene tells us that those who can adapt to the changes will be fine, but those who can't ""unfortunately, will perish."" I'm not sure what he means by that. Why would anyone perish, and by what means? If earth upheavals are involved in the coming transformation, many may perish from earthquakes and tornadoes, as we are certainly seeing in 2011. The Japan earthquake was compounded by the damage and radiation leaks from the nuclear power plant, but, like the rain, nuclear radiation falls on the just and the unjust alike. Tornadoes and floods sweep away the homes of good people and of those who do evil, without disctinction.

But if the shift we are seeing with the coming of 2012 means people becoming more sensitive to each other and to mother earth, bringing about changes in society that reduce our tendency to war on each other, it's hard to see how anyone will perish because of it.

Those who pursue profit at the expense of others will not disappear, but they may become less effective as people gain a sense of their own power. Changes in society can begin with small changes in behavior from a few people who take control of their own fate. Urban gardening, which is taking place in many poor cities, began in Detroit (where I live) with a few African-American women growing vegetables in the  lots left empty by urban abandonment so their children could have healthy food. A few fearless people can inspire others to cast aside their fear and insist on a better life, as we saw in the popular uprising in Egypt and is now happening in other countries. Small acts are a catalyst for big change. Does the arrival of 2012, the end point of the Mayan calendar, mean more people casting aside their fears and making new beginnings?  Or are the doomsayers correct and our planet will see more natural disasters leading to ultimate extinction? We don't have long to wait to find out.",1303516800,,6944,4.994809688581315
8438439,4,B004QP8B6K,"I was asked to review this film, and given a free copy to do so.  That said, I really enjoyed the film.  It was well done, interesting, and a whole lot more hopeful than anything else coming out about 2012.  After hearing what an Aztec elder had to say about the date, I couldn't help but imagine how the indigenous people must chuckle at our over-the-top reactions to what is only a turning of the page of their ancient calendar.

As 2012 Prophecy Change,Apocalypse And The End Of The World, explains, the world moves in and out of cycles just as we move through the seasons every year.  For whatever reasons, the Aztecs and the Mayans, and probably other native peoples, could see the long cycles coming and going.  Apparently we are leaving the current cycle and maybe that's not such a bad thing.  As the film explains, our western civilization see things in 'my' mode, rather than a 'we' mode which is how natures sees things.  Since we are going against nature, our way of life is not sustainable.  Maybe we should be looking towards the indigenous people for answers to our society's ills.  They've been around for thousands of years, raising their families and keeping the earth is pristine condition, so it wouldn't hurt to give them a listen.

Shaahin Cheyene, the director narrates the film and does a great job of it.  He's calm, intelligent, and sincere and speaks well on his subject.  The scenery is powerful, but it's the Aztec elder who lends weight to this film.  The screen lights up every time you see him.  One of the facts that I didn't know was that during the time of the conquistadors, many of the knowledgeable Aztecs were sent away to preserve their knowledge, coming back to their people when it was safe.

One of my favorite parts of the film was the music.  It was obviously native music, flutes and such, and it fit the film wonderfully.  Another part of the film that stood out, was a young native dancer who embodied both grace and power as he danced with two sticks throughout the film.  Cheyene made a film that honored the native people, giving us hope as the clock ticks down to the dreaded date of December 21, 2012.

Even if this date weren't looming in our lives, this film should be shown in schools to show our youth that there is an alternative to the survival of the fittest mentality that we are currently living.",1303430400,,2358,4.542654028436019

I was given a secret password via email that allowed me to view this movie for free and to write a good top review for it. Only top reviewers like me were allowed to view and then review this movie for absolutely free, a $19.99 value. But, wait, there's more.

Here is what I saw. There is this guy who is almost naked so you keep your kids away and he looks like the father of the dancers in Lady Gaga's Alejandro video. He looks agitated from time to time but at other times he interacts with children and with the environment. All the time they play this strange music that I believe it's called 'trance music' and they show other people wearing props.

The idea is that the Mayans or the Aztecs predicted that something major is about to take place but it's going to be okay so maybe world hunger or world peace or something that is a two-word thing where the first word is always 'world' is going to be addressed properly and it's not world's end. It's a new beginning. But isn't something supposed to end if it's going to be a new beginning? I'm a little confused on that one so I'll watch the movie again soon if I can still find the password.

This was a very good movie and the actors were all great  and some of them were fat but I'd wait for after 2012 and for the 3D version before I spent money on a copy.
