Patrick gives practical tips for every working actor such as how to scale your performance to the frame and hit your mark, uses great exercises and clips from past films to show what it takes to be truthful on screen, and does it all with charm and funny anecdotes from his own experience working with such directors as Steven Spielberg and Brian De Palma.

4049194,5,B0031KLW2Q,"This is an incredibly succinct, insightful and logical exploration of the tricks and techniques an actor must learn in order to give a truthful film performance.
Pat has crystallized the lessons he learned during his many years of screen acting, combined them with his brilliant teaching abilities and turned out a must see series of acting lessons - each sequence building and expanding upon the previous - and each  loaded with `ahah' moments that demystify the craft - and make us realize that with practice, we CAN do it.
At the end, Pat says a subtitle for the DVD might be ""things I wish somebody had taught me when I started working in film"" - that is exactly what he does for us - we were blown away.  This is an invaluable tool for every actor.

This DVD really pushed me to make the decision on the direction I wanted to bring my passion for acting and I would like to thank McNamara for giving us actors these tools.

4049202,5,B0031KLW2Q,"Being new to the film scene, this DVD is a breath of fresh air! For me, his articulation of the art of film acting made it easy for me to draw connections, both similarities and differences, to stage acting. This is not one you can only watch once, but will be a consistent resource as you continue your film career. Worth every penny; I can't wait to use what I learned!",1351555200,,371,4.23943661971831
4049203,5,B0031KLW2Q,"As per any ""instructional"" video I approached this DVD with an open mind, but really did not know what to expect.

I found the information to be clear and specific. I guess in many ways I was looking for ""that one special trick"", or idea that would make it all make sense. I have read many books on acting by; Stella Adler, Uta Hagen, Eric Morris, Sanford Meisner, Michael Caine, Stanislavski, and a great deal more. In addition to multitudinous other forms of research and indirect learning I have gained from my time as a technician and my time directing. The bottom line is, there is no special trick. I think Meisner said it best (and I'll have to paraphrase, but) ""Becoming a great actor takes 20 years"". This being said, the biggest thing I have taken away from this DVD class is that ""I am enough"". Too long have I lived a neurotic existence, second guessing every single, arbitrary, thing I do.

So the next decade of my life will be spent practicing, using this simple but brilliant mantra as a means of perpetuating self-empowerment.

Well worth the price of admission.",1350432000,,1079,4.609375

Plus, the teacher really cares about the craft.

4049219,5,B0031KLW2Q,"I actually ordered the DVD to my hotel room while on location for a film (Tom Cruise and Robert Duval), so I might have something to study in my trailer and on my off days.  I've really enjoyed the DVD and have already spoken to a few of my friends/coworkers about it.  I've been a stuntman in Los Angeles for 10 years, with occasional small acting parts in big studio films.  First off, in response to a previous poster, the goal of this DVD is not to take someone's hand and carry them through A-Z on how to act.  That comes with years of intense practice and self-discovery.  What McNamara does is take the core concepts of acting, which encompass all that acting is, and makes it simple and tangible, by using, analogies and exercises.  He then takes you through a step-by-step instructional on how to prepare like a professional, from audition, to script, to callback, and to specific performance concepts and techniques while on camera, and what you NEED to know about the workings of a set crew as it relates to you.  The instructions, side notes, and advice could only come from a seasoned professional who's been auditioning and booking memorable roles in major Hollywood films for decades.  The wealth of compiled experience and knowledge in this dvd makes it worth WAY more than you'll pay for it!  What an investment!",1319932800,2,1329,4.669527896995708
4049220,5,B0031KLW2Q,"I was very impressed with the Craft of Film Acting DVD.  The DVD was organized well, answered a lot of questions and went into more specifics than many of my on-camera classes. It's definitely the kind of DVD you will watch a few times, take notes, rewind, and watch again just so you can absorb all the important details that J.Patrick McNamara has to offer. There are many details an actor should be familiar with when acting in front of a camera. This DVD explained much of those details to me so I can be better prepared, feel more comfortable when acting on camera and be more professional on a set. This DVD gets a thumbs up from me.",1315699200,2,639,4.369747899159663
4049221,1,B0031KLW2Q,"I bought this DVD because of all the positive 5 star reviews. After watching i am now convinced that they were written by friends and family of the teacher or people he asked to go write reviews.

The DVD contains little to no information about acting that isn't already known even to grade school actors. While some of his advice are really good ""life"" advice they do nothing to improve one's acting. For instance he talks about being confident when attending auditions and on the set. ""I am enough"". That applies to job interviews and meetings in general. He mentions stealing techniques from your favorite actor. Effectively saying ""I have nothing to teach you, go watch what the pros are doing and do the same""!

Total waste of money.

If you still want to buy the DVD, please check my garbage can first. You might find my copy there. When you are done toss in the can until the last sucker watches it.",1313020800,3,906,4.54601226993865
4049222,5,B0031KLW2Q,"Originally skeptical of the sticker price, this efficient, entertaining and invaluable two hours of instruction was well worth the price, and much cheaper than the several hundred dollars and several months you might spend on a similar class if you're lucky enough to live where one is offered.  McNamera is not interested in hearing himself talk, he's interested in making you a better actor. And he does. And he's good at it.

Not a primer for basic acting technique, The Craft of Film Acting gives you wonderfully efficient and clear adjustments to take your stage and other prior training and proportionally maximize your efficiency for the screen.

In quick, well thought out and articulate segments he gives very useful lessons, using personal experience, film clips, original video, and even animation to get his points and their value across. Michael Caine's excellent video on the same topic is a classic. The Craft of Film Acting is a new classic and a must. Like Caine's video, or Markus Flanagan's One Less Bitter Actor, it's a great gift to give to the journeyman actor in your life. It's a gift to be able to watch it.  Time and money well spent.",1303344000,5,1160,4.843434343434343

I feel it is an invaluable asset to anyone who is, or is aspiring to be a film actor.  It's obvious Mr. McNamara has mastered his craft.  And he teaches in a simple and concise manner--where anyone of any skill level can understand.

If you have any interest in film acting, you will do yourself a Great DISSERVICE if you pass up on this Opportunity-- to learn from Mr. McNamara on this DVD.

I highly recommend it.

My initial intention was to sit back and casually be informed, which I was. But, I soon found myself ""pausing"" and penciling down notes. It's a worthwhile investment for anyone wanting to know about the actor's role in filmmaking and the responsibilities of preparation. McNamara has put together a legacy of his personal experiences, found an interesting way to examine these challenges, and then offered possible solutions to his students. Highly recommended.",1289865600,4,568,5.322222222222222

This DVD is absolutely indispensable. J Patrick McNamara covers everything with such clarity. His delivery is professional, yet endearing and with just the right element of humor. He allows the actor to get a full understanding of every aspect of film acting... from the audition process to what to expect working on set.  There's no doubt ""THE CRAFT of FILM ACTING"" is a TREASURE.  From a selfish point of view, I'm reluctant to share it with the competition!
