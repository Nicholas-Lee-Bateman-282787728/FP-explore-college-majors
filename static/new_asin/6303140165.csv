578063,4,6303140165,"This movie was really funny to me.  I really loved Katherine Heigl in it, I wish she was in more movies.  Alicia Silverstone was out for the role but she was too fat or something, but I think Katherine did a really good job.  The script is funny, the whole thing about her making people think her dad  was her lover was hilarious.  If you don't want to buy this movie, you  should at least rent it and watch it.  It's adorable.",936835200,7,427,4.134146341463414

578505,5,6303140165,"I love this movie, though my ""girl"" is two granddaughters growing up.  Having lived in Europe, and had experience with helping to raise a ""goddaughter"" also, this is a humorous way to see a divorced father's trials and trepidations in a split (broken doesn't seem to be quite accurate) family.  Not particularly a Depardieu fan, I think he does very well in this.  And yes, the lovely Katherine Heigl is quite sexy, if pubescent, in this.  She does well also.  But if you're looking for kiddie porn, forget it: not this movie.  If you like beauty (and one could also say a ""beast"" of sorts), this is a good afternoon entertainment about parenthood, and several female friends found it good too.  Approach it as an entertainment, it's good.  Any other way will only keep you from understanding its underlying (and not so obvious) wisdom.",1423612800,,836,4.756944444444445

She's 14, and wears a thong bathing suit, guys keep looking at her like a piece of meat, and she makes up a wild story (that everyone believes) that he Father is her boyfriend so that she seems older and more interesting, and her out-of-his-depth father goes along with it to make her happy.  All that aside, the guy she likes is 18 and she's 14! Nobody seems concerned about that age gap.

578606,3,6303140165,"I never got around to seeing the 1994 comedy MY FATHER, THE HERO until yesterday.  With lesser actors in the two lead roles I would have enjoyed it less but Grard Depardieu and Katherine Heigl carry the film, which seems to use a rough draft script.  There's a better story somewhere in there in this comic yarn about a teen-age girl who tells tall tales about her father to people they meet on vacation.

I had never seen Depardieu but quickly understood why he is a star in his home country of France.  You just want to see what he will do next in MY FATHER, THE HERO, between his machismo (check out that prize fighter nose of his) and the big heart he shows, all at the same time.  But the reason I wanted to finally see MY FATHER, THE HERO was then-teen Heigl, who has grown up to be such an energetic comic actress.  While her character is not as developed as it should be, she nonetheless commands attention.  Too bad MY FATHER, THE HERO does not delve more into the teen-ager's conflicted feelings about her old man.",1412467200,,1024,4.3578947368421055

578893,4,6303140165,"In My Father the Hero (1994), which was adapted from the French version of the film, Mon pre, ce hros (1991), 14-year-old Nicole (Katherine Heigl) has an insatiable desire for the older men at a Bahamian resort. In an effort to attain the affection of the ephebophiles, Nicole attempts to make them jealous by pretending that her approximately 45-year-old father is her lover.

If the plot is not shocking enough, the 14-year-old Heigl appeared in the film in a very revealing white thong, which unsurprisingly caused a backlash in the media.

The humour is there but just doesn't work so well in French and there are some cringeworthy moments.

Heigl, though just as loveable at this age as she is as an adult, also just isn't a good enough substitute for Marie Gillain.

579219,4,6303140165,"This comedy is both wry and charming. Gerard Depardieu is one of the best known, best-loved French actors. He brings the same magic to the English-speaking screen with this romp through the perils and pleasures of raising a teenage daughter as he has with dozens of epic roles in French cinema. In this case, Depardieu plays an oft-absent father who is trying to make up for it by taking his 14 year old daughter (Kathleen Heigl) on a vacation in the tropics. As she wrestles with the feelings of young love for the island boys, she employs strategies that embroil both her and her father in comical adventures. While on the one hand this film is a light-hearted romp, it has its moments of tenderness and even depth.

There are two odd features of this blu-ray disk: 1) The resolution seems no better than a standard DVD. It did not detract from my enjoyment, but why make a blu-ray disk without the high resolution?  2) There are no subtitles at all. I searched the menus, and pressed the subtitles button on my blu-ray player. So if you have someone who's hard of hearing in your family, this disk may not be for you.

I lived and studied in France for a year, and appreciate movies like this that freely explore bi-cultural themes and even throw in a few French phrases, but you don't need to know French to enjoy this film.

Highly recommended.",1312329600,3,1349,4.539094650205762

579227,4,6303140165,"OK, this is a 1994 Hollywood remake, following the 1991 French original very closely with the same father, Gerard Depardieu, though with all different people otherwise, and you can say the original is more tender, more natural, more moving, the relationship between the father and the teenage daughter is more caring and sympathetic, the daughter more likable and lovable: I only knew it existed because a film club chose the French version when it was new, but this version is still well-worth having in your library - it's lots of fun, and deserves to be much better known!

I guess there are people who, not knowing French, don't want the experience of hearing a language they don't understand while they read sub-titles, and I guess this version was made for them: but even if you're comfortable with French it's very interesting to compare the two ...

As a detail, I personally find it embarrassing over-kill that the Hollywood version adds a scene where the father sings 'Thank heaven for little girls' - it's out of character that, with the degree of sensitivity he's otherwise portrayed, he would have missed the likelihood of its being considered in bad taste ... but maybe that's because I always found the song in bad taste anyway!",1275264000,3,1243,4.8584905660377355

Gerard Depardieu is fantastic (though a little hard to understand if you struggle with accents) and fathers can appreciate the humor behind his frustrations as a father with a teen daughter in this movie.  Kids do crazy things - especially teenage daughters - but you can watch this movie and appreciate that a little too much makeup isn't really all that bad when you think about it....  I'm a huge movie buff and on the Dad/Daughter scale, I give this one 5 stars.  The humor is sophistocated and clever.

This was a very cute and enjoyable movie. Gerard Depardieu (The Man in the Iron Mask) was funny as the father of a teenage girl who is dealing with her parents being divorced and her father not always contactable. The teenager is played by the now stunning (and over 18) Katherine Heigl. Everytime my wife and I watch this movie, the infamous bathing suit that Nicole (Heigl) wears always starts us up on a conversation. When he backside is showing, I'm the first one to say that our daughter will not wear that until she's 30, and NO THONGS!!! LOL.

The movie is basically about Andre (Depardieu) and Nicole going on a vacation to the Bahamas. Andre learns that his daughter is all grown up and is in that age where she will get agitated any second and fall in love just as fast. Nicole has been upset with Andre for a while but refuses to tell him why as she is also mad that he hasn't been around. Andre also has to figure out why his girlfriend, Isabelle, isn't speaking to him either. What complicates matters is the fact that during there vacation, everyone; both employees and fellow vacationers, think he is a pervert. This is due to the fact that Nicole had told a small little lie that Andre, her father, is actually her lover. This was to impress an older guy that she likes who happens to work at the hotel her and her father stay at. The fact is that this guy at first when he saw her near rocks on the shore ""treated her like a kid,"" telling her to not go on those rocks because it's dangerous---made her start her lies, first saying she was older than her actual age which was 14. The guy was 18. the lies got longer and stranger as the movie goes on.

The best part is when Andre plays the piano singing,"" I like little girls,"" to a stunned audience at the hotel. The laughs are spread out and is a delight to watch. A great addition to anyones DVD library.",1207958400,,1907,4.366197183098592

579398,3,6303140165,"There is nothing earth-shatteringly unique about MY FATHER THE HERO.It is a very lightweight comedy that concerns itself with the relationship of Andre (Gerard Depardieu) and his headstrong daughter Nicole (Katherine Heigl)as they attempt to reconnect after five years while on vacation at a Tiki resort. Nicole is nothing short of a cruel,manipulative brat and Andre is trying to re-establish a life with Nicole while attempting to decide about marriage with the woman he has been seeing. Now, the plot of this film is pretty flimsy...BUT it does feature France's best known actor for the last thirty years and a very young Katherine Heigl in her third feature film long before T.V.'s ROSWELL and GREY'S ANATOMY.Both do an excellent job with the material at hand. The most convincing scene concerns Depardieu feeding Heigl romantic lines aka Cyrano de Bergerac in order to capture the heart of her beau (Dalton James-whatever happened to him?).....very clever and convincing! Depardieu plays nothing short of a lumbering buffoon. He is such an amazing dramatic actor who has graced the screen with portrayals of such legendary figures as DANTON,CYRANO de BERGERAC,COLONEL CHABERT,Jean Valjean in LES MISERABLES that this fluff is so far below him as a great actor; that said, though,Depardieu is funny and touching in his sensitive and comedic turn as Andre. It is no small wonder that Katherine Heigl has turned out to be one of the hottest stars on American television. You can see all of her potential here in looks and in depth of skill. This is an American remake of the French film MON PERE CE HERO.
MY FATHER THE HERO is a fun 90 minute romp from Touchstone/Disney that will be enjoyed for the sheer entertainment of it all. Katherine Heigl's first film was THAT NIGHT and shows her at the age of eleven. It is a small role, but you will see the star power there! Depardieu has always been the greatest and should be seen in the above mentioned films for Americans who have not seen this magnificent Frenchman act. I also suggest A PURE FORMALITY,A LOVING FATHER,MOON IN THE GUTTER,JEAN de FLORETTE and ALL THE MORNINGS OF THE WORLD to view Depardieu in his Frenchiness ""magnifique"".His other American triumph was GREEN CARD opposite Andie MacDowell.",1197849600,3,2258,4.96042216358839

The young girl becomes extremely annoying as the movie progresses, which is probably what turned me off a little bit.  Steve Minor, the director, did a good job of creating a fun atmosphere though.

""He's my lover"", not my dad is where this gets to be hysterical... and to hear Grard Depardieu sing that old show tune about loving little girls... well, it's hysterical.
