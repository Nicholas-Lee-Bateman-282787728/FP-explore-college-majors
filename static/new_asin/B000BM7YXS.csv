2423609,5,B000BM7YXS,"I have alot of instructional dvd's on the blues and rock and this one by Warren Hayes is a must for anyone serious about learning to play GOOD blues guitar. I really liked his teaching style and his calm but knowlegable demeanor. The first part of the dvd shows you blues scales and bending technique which is so important, he also elaborates on how to think out your solos instead of throwing in as many notes as you can in a flurry of garble. The second part of the dvd is all about slide and the different ways to mute or hilite your notes using the palm of you hand and other styles like ""Delta Blues"".(he talks alot about Tone as well)

Other instructional dvd's i have purchased were either too hard or borring rehashes of tierd blues cliche's. This DVD will stick with you and help develop your own style.

Buy It.",1169164800,29,821,4.359477124183006
2423610,5,B000BM7YXS,"What a player and a super teacher, to boot (methodical and articulate).  Slide has always been a struggle for me.  Wish I had picked this up years ago because Warren quickly demystified it for me.",1157328000,17,196,4.571428571428571
2423611,5,B000BM7YXS,"I may be prejudiced by my love of Allman Bros music, but I really think that this is one of the best of the Hot Licks series. In case you don't know, these videos are basically private lessons by the world's best players. What would you pay for a lesson from this guy? They are packed with great licks and techniques and a really personal outline of the player's philosophy of the instrument. I have about 10 of the VHS's.

The Warren Haynes version finally gives me hope that I can play slide guitar. About half of it is just great blues insight. You will not be disappointed if you like this style of playing.",1137888000,43,611,4.3130434782608695
2423612,5,B000BM7YXS,Warren gives you great teaching and insight as well as feel. Hot Lick were great videos and it is good to them in DVD.,1395273600,,118,3.9583333333333335
2423613,5,B000BM7YXS,"Have the great Warren Haynes on your screen explaining with detail all the important parts of the Electric Blues and Slide guitar playing is a privilege. Mainly because, not only he plays extremely good, also because he transmit his guitar knowledge and feeling
Better that any guitar teacher I ever have. If you want to learn how to play Electric Blues and Slide Guitar this will be an excellent way to do it.

2423615,5,B000BM7YXS,"Warren did a wonderful job on his instructions. Easy to see what he is doing and his explanations of what, why and when are clear and uncomplicated. This study will revisited many times as there is much to learn from it. As always ... Thanks Warren!",1381017600,,249,4.434782608695652
2423616,5,B000BM7YXS,"My title says it all. This by far one of the most fantastic tutorials by a blues guitar master. If you're a complete newb tho, and only know a couple chordes this isn't for you however, if you know the pentatonic blues scale and want to break out of the ""same ole"" solo plague, you won't be disapointed!

2423619,5,B000BM7YXS,"phenomenal guitarist.  Way over the top.  Don't know if I will ever be this good.  All standard tuning, lots and lots to think about.",1362009600,,133,4.458333333333333
2423620,4,B000BM7YXS,"Good video all in all. Some really great insights, especially when it comes to slide playing in standard tuning. I bought a digital copy, so no book. It is still easy enough to follow, but might be difficult for a true beginner.",1358726400,3,228,4.4523809523809526
2423621,4,B000BM7YXS,"Warren Haynes knows his way around a Les Paul! The blues master himself from the Allman Brothers Band. First off, this was taped in 1995 in VHS form...it has now been re-released on DVD form which is great for staying up to date with today's technology. Warren never goes into depth on any one thing in particular, but coupled with the printed tab that comes with the DVD, you can pick up on some of the licks that he plays. I'd say it is evenly split with regards to time on subject matter: first half = blues guitar, second half = slide guitar. Don't expect any magical thing to happen to you by watching. It is very good but he doesn't go into depth on any one lick, technique, etc. Still, a good watch and listen.",1293580800,2,717,4.279411764705882
2423622,5,B000BM7YXS,"I have several hot licks videos. So are good, some not so good. I must say that Warren definitely has the gift for teaching. Very relaxed, thoughtful presentation. It really is like sitting accross the table from him and he's giving you a personal lesson. He breaks down each idea and technique and explains what he is thinking and why. Very smooth progressive lesson and presentation. ""Warning"" if you do not have a Gibson, Les Paul you will want one after watching this video.",1283904000,3,478,4.7023809523809526
2423623,5,B000BM7YXS,"Regardless to what level guitarist you are at this point, you can and will benefit from, and enjoy this DVD. Warren Haynes is not only one of the most talented guitarists to play the blues, he also has an excellent, down to earth personal teaching style that will make this DVD an essential part of your library. You will easily pick up suttle nuances from the DVD that you can apply immediately. Warren's commentary is very helpful, and his insight invaluable. Whether you're interested in picking up some new hot licks or in continuing to fine tune your skills, this DVD is definitely worthwhile. I recommend it highly.",1209513600,7,621,4.7592592592592595
2423624,2,B000BM7YXS,"This is a repackaged on DVD version of what used to be a video tape. This may be an OK learning program for experienced guitarists, but beginners should stay away. There is no written material other than a tab book that doesn't tell you how to read tab. Plus, the text in the tab book is almost unreadable. This DVD may have been marginally useful if the tab booklet was adequate, but it is pretty useless with this poor quality booklet. I gave my DVD away to my brother-in-law who is an accomplished guitarist.",1208563200,14,511,4.446808510638298
2423625,4,B000BM7YXS,This is a must have if you are a fan of Warren Haynes. He gives some great insight into his own personal style. Not an instructional dvd for beginners. I highly recommend it!,1207440000,,174,4.303030303030303
2423626,5,B000BM7YXS,"Being an advanced beginner, I would say this has been the best instructional dvd that I have purchased. Warren's style is engaging and easy to follow and he provides a broad range of material that is both below and well above my current skill level. I was particularly interested in his coverage of slide playing which has taken me to the next level. He does a great job of providing instruction on the basics of standard tuning slide playing, while also covering more advanced techniques. The split screen, loop, and slowed at standard pitch features are excellent, however the accompanying booklet is rather small-fwiw. You want this for electric and standard tuning blues, not for more traditional ""delta"" slide playing.",1199145600,9,723,5.033333333333333
2423627,5,B000BM7YXS,"I own several of the hot licks DVD's and this one blew me away.  It gives you a very broken down lesson on how to approach electric blues and especially how to play standard tuning slide. Haynes goes into great detail on how to play slide, as well as his own techniques on how to mute unwanted notes and how to bring out the best in the notes you do want.  The looping options on the DVD are a great tool to help you nail down the licks he provides.
  What I found most useful is how he actually plays longer licks here...not the normal 15 second or so lick and thats found on many other guitar instruction DVD's. The playing here is for more advanced players, but that does not mean that even beginners cannot get something out of this.  He really gets into the playing and it only helps aspiring guitarists learn some great licks from one of the best players of our time.",1199059200,12,873,4.234939759036145
2423628,5,B000BM7YXS,Next to Duane Allman there's Warren Haynes.  That's really saying something.  I've played for 30 years and found some good licks in this DVD.  I like it that a book comes with it with everything written down that's on the DVD so you can't mess it up.,1194393600,3,250,4.276595744680851

2423630,3,B000BM7YXS,"The warren hayes video is great. You can rewind and pause to get ideas for new licks but it does lack a booklet to read along with. I ordered it for Unbox video.

It does have some really good tips, ideas and insights for the beginning blues player.",1190764800,2,249,4.1875
2423631,5,B000BM7YXS,"If you want to learn some blues licks or get your chops up in that area, I would highly recommend this!!! Warren is an awesome guitar player, and I think he makes a great teacher in this video format!",1188518400,,200,4.153846153846154
8088719,3,B000BM7YXS,"Where is the music notation and tab of the examples? I used to have the VHS tape that came with a booklet, lost it, I thought the digital version would have that to.

Warren's training is awesome!

But this was my first purchase from Amazon video. If they are leaving out essential resources from the authors I will be very reluctant to buy again from Amazon video again. I tired to find a way to contact Amazon about the missing notation that should accompany the video, but the contact Amazon link led to a page with no way whatsoever to be able to actually contact them. Very bad customer service; they cannot be reached at all. As convenient as Amazon video seems, it is going to be a disaster for this department of the company if there is no customer service at all.",1473206400,,772,4.391608391608392

8088722,4,B000BM7YXS,"Great video to utilize from Warren.  Just be cautious that the Digital version does not include the booklet information to follow along the exercises. Also, it is a single file play, so there are not chapters to select, etc.  You must scroll through the timeline to find a certain lesson or area of discussion. Over all, Warren is great instructor.

8088725,5,B000BM7YXS,"A gentle, soft-spoken, unassuming guitar god sits you down and patiently explains how to play blues guitar with feeling starting with the nuances of half-step, full-step and step and a half bending, vibrato and string muting techniques and so on. He assumes you know the blues scale and can move between the pentatonic boxes, so I suggest you have that under your belt before diving in. Some people have complained about inadequate tablature and so on, but in spite of being a beginner, i found i could get a good idea of what he was doing by watching his fingers, and the using my ears to pick up whatever I missed visually. That's good exercise for anyone who's picking up a musical instrument. You gotta work for it a bit, right? To sum up, great lesson, and I can't recommend it enough. Every time I watch the video, I learn something. I also end up scouring eBay for a tobacco burst Les Paul that I can't afford. Yet.",1414972800,3,922,4.494047619047619
