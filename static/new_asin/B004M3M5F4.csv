4428385,5,B004M3M5F4,"I loved Home Improvement...  When I found that I could get all the seasons for this incredible price, I ordered right away.  I received it today.  It was displayed beautifully.  I had read a review on another series anniversary set and they were disappointed in the packaging.  This is beautiful.  Each season individually wrapped and put into the display tool kit.  It even came with a binford tool (a level).  Each season has bonus features such a bloopers.  I can wait to start watching.  I just wanted anyone wondering about the set to know  that is is worth it.",1305763200,3,566,4.616161616161616
4428386,5,B004M3M5F4,"Ha, Ha ""Home Improvement"" was one of the best shows of the 90's. Too bad I was so young to fully enjoy this show. Now I can catch it in syndication. Hard to believe it's been 20 years. It was tossup over who was the funnier character, Al or Tim and both had their moments especially Tim.",1305763200,3,287,4.052631578947368
4428387,5,B004M3M5F4,"Packaging is amazing. Show is amazing. I have been waiting for this for a while now and I am glad I got it.. The binford tool is comes with is pretty awesome as well..

4428388,5,B004M3M5F4,"This is a must own if you are a fan of Home Improvement and don't own the season sets yet.  For the price, it is almost half what it would cost buying the seasons individually.  And it comes in an awesome toolbox case with the bonus all in one tool.  Buy it while it is still cheap, you won't be disappointed.

4428389,5,B004M3M5F4,"If you are a Home Improvement Fan, I suggest you buy this item while it is at such an affordable price. I wanted to buy the complete season for a while now, and having to wait for this set was well worth it. Months ago I was thinking about buying each season, but the price for all 8 seasons...plus Shipping and Tax was way over my budget. I noticed this was coming out for half the price I would have paid and I decided to pre-order back in February and wait. I can tell you this..it was the best Set I ever pre-ordered. The entire series in in a Tool Box case with each season wrapped up individually, as if I bought each season separately in stores. I started watching Season 1 and will continue all the way to season 8. It is a must own if your a fan of the show and get it why you have a chance.",1305244800,42,800,3.9751552795031055
4428390,5,B004M3M5F4,"If you're like me, this was a no brainer to buy. I debated for a while before I found out this collection was coming out if I wanted to start buying the seasons seperate since I didin't own any yet, and its been on my check-list for a while now. I also got tired of seeing Home Improvement being thrown around on TV with bad time slots and decreasing epidodes. This show was a must watch every week in my house when growing up, and its a must have.... and like someone else on here said, get it while the price is good and/or before it goes out of print.",1305158400,26,554,4.045454545454546
4428391,5,B004M3M5F4,If you don't have any of season of Home Improvement. Then this is the thing for you. You will love it. It has the own case for all the seasons plus bonus epsiodes.

(It is rated PG.)  There are not too many decent comedies I can say that about these days.  The extras are an added plus.  The DVD set fittingly comes packaged in a Binford tool box, complete with a bonus Binford tool.  If you are a Home Improvement fan and have not bought the individual seasons yet, here is a good opportunity to purchase the whole series at a more affordable price.",1304985600,9,548,4.474747474747475

I was a little disappointed in the lack of quality of some of the seasons...in that a handful of the disc have scratches/glitches in them. There is one of seasons that has a glitch during a couple of the episodes and all of the disc in the last season starts out with a glitch. Fortunately, the glitch in the last season is during the very first part of the, not during the episodes. My lower rating is for the quality of the discs, not the show.

4428424,5,B004M3M5F4,"""This documentary takes a personal look into the lives of the Taylor family.  Exploring the postfeminism dynamic between man, wife; child, parent; neighbor to neighbor.  The power struggle between sexes, as both sides react to the changing landscape in gender roles.  Addressing the troubles of adapting to such shifts in the classic household paradigm and how such changes were passed along to younger generations within the Taylor clan.  This fascinating series shows us the growth of a family and other interpersonal relationships through these changes.  How they grow.  How they communicate.  And how ultimately, better one another.  The only way this series could be improved is with the help of legendary documentary narrator, Sir David Attenborough.""

A classic family sitcom that kept hammering out the laughs for 8 seasons!  This bundle is of the complete series and a must for any fan of the series.  There are a few extras (bloopers, behind the scenes and the ""reunion"" episode) on each season but nothing new from the already released collections.  Catch this on sale and it is definitely worth it!",1485302400,,1110,5.139664804469274

I did not realize my order could possibly not be delivered until after Christmas.  My issue was that I was leaving a couple of days after the holidays and would not be home to receive my order.  When I tried to change the delivery date it was difficult at best.  When I finally emailed to cancel my order THEN I got a response saying that the delivery address would be changed.  I responded that I would not cancel my order since the delivery address had been changed.

I received notice that my order had been shipped. My daughter has checked my mail several times and it has not been delivered there OR at her address where it should have gone if indeed the delivery address was changed.

This situation has been very frustrating and time consuming for both my daughter and myself.

I'm at a loss as to what needs to be done.  I am very disappointed with this whole process.  This was an expensive order and I hope that I haven't lost my money.  At this point I feel you need to straighten this mess out because I haven't had much luck.  It makes it extremely hard when there is no way to communicate, such as actually talking to a REAL person verses a computer.

Your assistance in correcting this problem, either reimburse me or get my order sent out correctly, will be appreciated and restore my desire to ever order anything from Amazon again.

the first disc of the first season was covered with some kind of sticky plastic ( which did come off with little damage).
and that same first disc holder had allot more of that sticky plastic stuck all over the inside (it also came off)

Sadly the first season's 3 CD pack had 2 of the 3 CD's skip throughout or freeze all together. After multiple emails sent to the seller about our issue with the season 1 DVD I got ZERO response. I guess when one of your customers drop $140+ they don't mean enough to you to respond. I will DEFINATELY remember this when I see this seller again.,1373241600,4,440,4.127906976744186
4428526,5,B004M3M5F4,"My husband and I enjoyed this show during it's run.  Even knowing what is going to be said or happen, we still find ourselves laughing and feeling the heart-warming moments.  We were disappointed when the show and later the reruns were taken off the air.  When I was going through weekly chemo sessions, those reruns were one of the few daytime programs we watched.  So when I found these, we were quick to purchase them.
Unfortunately, television has gone downhill.  There are very few shows without profanity, sexuality, and/or immorality.  These DVD's are a welcome change.  They are great to have around when our grandkids visit because we know they are safe and our grandkids enjoy them as much as we do.  Once we see or hear something - good or bad - it cannot be erased from our minds and can be replayed at any time.  I may be in the kitchen cooking but can still mentally replay the actions that go along with the words.
One of the other great things about these DVD's is that they are episodes.  We have DVD's on hand for longer time frames but we don't always have time to watch a full movie.  Because they are fairly short and commercial-free, we can easily watch 1 or 2.  There is usually one of those DVD's near our DVD player for that reason.",1373068800,2,1257,4.441048034934497

4428531,5,B004M3M5F4,"To this day I still absolutely LOVE Home Improvement, it is by far one of my most favorite TV shows to watch growing up. I remember snuggling on the couch with my family & we would all laugh & enjoy the show together.
The Show: All of the characters have great chemistry, they look their age & the Taylors even look like they could be related - how great is that! Shows on TV today aren't like this, the actors are always 5-10 years older than their characters & overall its just not the same; Im not saying everything is bad, there are some good ones, but overall its different.  Home Improvement is a great show for the entire family.
The DVDs: It was so great watching these episodes again, especially as an adult, I still enjoy them so much & can watch them over & over. There were a few episodes I hadnt seen before, so it was great to finally see all of them. The picture & sound quality is good, I have watched each episode & haven't had any issues with any discs. The menu screen for selecting the episodes or playing them all is very straight forward & easy to use.
The Collectors Toolbox: Its cardboard, however, its durable. I think its the perfect casing for a collection such as this. If the box had been plastic it wouldve made it heavier & depending on where you box set is going, that could be a potential issue; in my opinion, the box is perfect. Each season fits perfectly into the cut out hole in the center of the box keeping each season safe & new looking. It comes with a little Binford level with a small pen, paper & measuring tape. Honestly, I wouldnt actually use it for work around the house, but its a fun collectors item!
Overall: Im so glad that I bought this when I did, it seems like the price has gone way up, yikes! My order came early & in perfect condition. Ive said this already but it truly is the perfect collection for any Home Improvement fan! The quality is great & so is the box set. I highly recommend this to people of all ages, its a great journey down memory lane, Im sure youll enjoy it as much the second time around as you did the first!",1365724800,2,2087,4.230576441102757

4428538,5,B004M3M5F4,"I don't think there is much I can add to all the other rave reviews of this series. Except to say that I kind of think of it as the last of the great family sitcoms.  As much as shows like ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" and ""King Of Queens"" were just getting started when this show left the air, neither of them, nor any other series since has ever been one that is truly geared toward entertainment for the whole family.  It was never really about the kids in ""Raymond"", and there were almost none at all in ""Queens"".  Home Improvement was the show of choice for our family here when my son was a youngin'.  I especially remember looking forward to the holiday episodes every year that pretty much stayed on the same theme, but hardly did we ever grow tired of them. They never missed a chance to create a very memorable and funny piece when Halloween, Thanksgiving, and especially Christmas came around every year.  They were the best always.  It's so unfortunate the kids on the show had to grow up, and, that TV itself just drifted away from family sitcoms that were always innocent, and just plain fun...

As for this set itself, its the best.  The discs work perfectly, and the toolbox container is a nice nostalgic touch.  Probably best of all is the fact that as of the time of this writing this set is the best deal price wise on the entire series.  In fact I picked it up locally for more than what they are asking for it here.  A great deal on a series that unfortunately was near the last of its kind, but is still as good as the first time around.  Enjoy it together again with the new generation in your life that otherwise would be denied it... : )",1360713600,,1658,4.312903225806451

4428543,5,B004M3M5F4,"Bought this a year and a half ago when Amazon had a special and knocked $20 bucks off the price. Can't remember if it was a Goldbox deal or not, but it was also listed much cheaper back then. Paid less than $100 bucks at the time (after $20 discount). That figured out to be just over $10 a season. The asking price on this is much higher now and a little quick math shows that buying the seasons individually is cheaper. So the value of choosing this over buying individually is up to you. I will say that the seasons inside seem to be in the same cases as they would be if bought individually. That is, nice cases that will help keep the discs protected whether they are kept in the box set or placed on a DVD shelf. The box is made of heavy cardboard with the clasp and handle are metal. The little tool inside is more of a novelty, but I guess you could use it if you really wanted to. I keep it in the box as a neat little souvenir. The seasons are positioned in the case in such away that the box set as a whole will fit on a DVD shelf; though take up a little more room than if place on the shelf as individual season. All in all, a nice purchase.",1355356800,2,1154,3.978448275862069

I laughed aloud at least four times (which is unusual for me - I can usually predict what's going to happen in a show, but a lot of this humor was unpredictable and therefore surprising and funny.)  I purchased this series because I, too, am married and have three small boys and I wanted to watch this show with my family everyday during our evening meal.  We are all laughing and my young kids, 9, 7 & 5 look forward to our new tradition with a nightly question, ""Is is Tool Time?""  Good family viewing together.",1353283200,,631,4.367521367521367
4428547,5,B004M3M5F4,"All one can say is that (IMHO) ""Home Improvement"" was a comedy classic -- but one with an intelligent story line behind it.  The whole premise of the show is that an ex-hardware salesman gets his own handy-man show (ala Bob Vila), calls the show ""Tool Time"" and goes on to become the most inept and accident prone ""unhandy man"" anyone could ever imagine on cable television.

On ""Tool Time"", Tim Allen's character doles out advice about projects from installing a shelf or a wall outlet to creating an entire ""man's"" bathroom complete with built-in television and beer cooler.  Tim is usually saved from some near disaster of his own making by his basically insecure but really proficient assistant Al Borland, an old fashioned midwest kind of guy who just happens to only wear flannel shirts.

The other part of the program mainly takes place at Tim's home in suburban Detroit with his wife Jill, their three extremely active sons, and their neighbor Wilson who provides advice coupled with philosophy to the Taylors over the wood fence dividing their back yards.  Tim builds hot rod cars in HIS garage and tries to add ""more power"" to the home appliances while his loving wife tries to cope and keep it all under control while raising their three sons.  What shines through most of all is the genuine affection between Tim and Jill set against all little and big situations that occur in any average family.

The show ran for eight years, so you watch the boys grow up to young adulthood; Jill stars out as a free-lance magazine writer then goes back to college to earn a degree as a professional counsellor; and finally Tim's little show is swallowed up by ""corporate bureaucratics"" who buy out the tool manufacturing company that sponsored ""Tool Time"", and take the program out of Tim's hands.

""Tool Time"" still airs on some cable television networks but having the entire series on DVD was worth the price.  Oh, and the Anniversary Collection comes in that red simulated metal ""tool box"" with a handle on top and a ""binford tape measure"" inside.  It's fun and probably a neat gift, but now where do I put the box?  If you don't want the box, you'll find the DVDs in other packaging.

Added Note:  There is a terrific and much more detailed description of ""Home Improvement"" in Wikipedia.  It can be seen by searching on Tool Time in Google.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-Improvement-The-20th-Anniversary-Complete-Collection/dp/B004M3M5F4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home Improvement: The 20th Anniversary Complete Collection</a>",1348272000,6,2583,5.133651551312649
4428548,3,B004M3M5F4,"When I caught bits of this show on TV, I though Tim Allen was a big jerk.  Watching the dvds, I now see that Jill is the jerk... or maybe they deserve each other.  That takes away a lot of my enjoyment, but there are a lot of good gags that keep us laughing all the same.",1338076800,2,271,3.736842105263158
4428549,5,B004M3M5F4,This show made me laugh when it was on the air and is right up there with Family Matters as one of the funniest shows ever. I think its a little bit strange that they only started with Family Matters a couple years ago and therefore are only up to season two. They should have the whole series out as they do with this one and hopefully one day they will. In the meantime this show is just as popular and just as good so you should get it.,1337731200,,439,3.943820224719101

No special bonus discs like other shows have included with their complete sets (The Andy Griffith show, Little House on the prairie) What it does include is a box that resembles a tool box and an all in one tool (pen, tape measure, level, post it notes). I'm amazed at how the price for this set has sky rocketed. When it was first released the price was about $80 at the most.

Now if you purchase this series by season you actually save quite a bit of money ($30) now if the box and the all in one tool are worth $30 to you then I'd get this set, if your wanting to save money I'd purchase this set separately.

I can't believe I caught this collection at the price I did! And it arrived less than 24 hours after ordering (just happened that it was shipped just a few hundred miles away).

The DVDs are pristine, and the packaging is very good. Of course, each season's discs are in slightly different packaging, but that shows that you are getting the genuine original series as they were produced when released.

The video is excellent, but I must comment that I do not have a high definition TV. The video looks great on a Sony Trinitron. There has been no out-of-sync audio-to-video. The audio is excellent in my 5.1 system.

I have experienced a few ""freezes"" while in the root menus, but that is not a foreign occurence in any DVD system.

The heavy cardboard ""Tool Box"" that the collection comes in is a neat bonus novelty. I put mine away for safekeeping. It is a bit cumbersome having to open the box to get to the discs.

It would have been better to have a more creative idea. The case is thick cardboard with a glossy coating. I wish it was at least plastic or more sturdy. There is a metal handle and hinges.
Most of the discs do not have hardly any bonus material. I was hoping for more of a blooper reel or something. They basically just pick different scenes from different episodes and replay them in a small clip. There are a few ""games"" that are not entertaining. There was commentary on season 1 but I have not seen anymore commentary options on the other Dvds.
The Dvd quality is good. Each Dvd comes sealed individually. I am thrilled there is a box set;however, I wish there was more Dvd content and a better storage case/free gift. Even something like -Tool Time salt shakers or playing cards would have been better.
