3176616,2,B00180R040,"This movie is not about surfing and the magic, spirituality, and beauty of surfing.  I've surfed for over 40 years.  What I thought started out as a video of an epic odyssey of the magic and spiritualality of surfing and the surfing lifestyle, became a chronicle about a self absorbed and abusive man engaged in denial and cover up of severe dysfunction.  I don't have any quarrel with raising and home schooling kids outside the system, a healthy active sex life, discipline, and surf, surf, surfing.  I think these are goals to aspire to.  I assert that there was and is a very very dark side to Dorian and his family life that revealed itself in episodes where he encouraged one child to choke another.  That is just completely unacceptable. Such psychology and behavior only sullies the reputation of surfing and surfers and reinforces the unfortunate stereotypes that many people have about surfing and surfers.  I suspect that if we pull the cover completely off the Poskowitz family we'd find severe child abuse of the sort intolerable to all but predators.",1214006400,6,1064,4.845303867403315

3176624,4,B00180R040,"A family of 11. A mid-size camper. A father determined to haul his family cross-country hither and thither depending on his whims. Living the free life. A life without a taxes. Without drugs. Without sugar. The beach and the ocean were their playground. Dorian ""Doc"" Paskowitz was their father.

Imagine eight brothers and one sister never being corrupted by the public school system. Even though they were captives of their father's obsession to lead a better, more healthful lifestyle, they were encouraged to read, to play, to surf, and to live their lives to the fullest. Sounds ideal? Watch and find out why it wasn't. This documentary will give you both sides of the story. All 11 family members relate their memories and points of view on the unique Paskowitz family experience. If you're interested in non-conformists, or people who have gone ""off the deep end"", this should be your bucket of entertainment so long as you can stomach the occasional crudity. Doc Paskowitz may chip away at your cranium with his kooky ways and ideas, but the trippy soul-surfing music of John Dragonetti will leave you feeling invigorated.",1426896000,,1129,4.973544973544974

Sometimes funny, sometimes disturbing,  but always interesting and engaging, this is a personal look into the lives of the eight brothers, one sister, and their bohemian parents.

The family, as unconventional as their lifestyle was, was highly regarded in the surfing community.

This is an interesting documentary for fans of surfing, for those interested in the study of family dynamics, and those who dream to live life on their own terms, without being affected by the outsiders who may judge them.

First, the Paskowitz family are about as unique as it gets. The father is a health nut as much as a surf nut. His philosophy is in line with some elements of the primitive diet type movement ie no processed junk food; believes diet and lifestyle should mimic that of animals etc. There are elements of the story that are a commentary on sex, education.....like i said, this movie has a little of everything. Some of the stories that the kids tell (they are grown up in the interviews) are funny, strange, unique. You will definitely be drawn in.

3176658,5,B00180R040,"This film does a superb job of telling the incredible true story of the Paskowitz family, a once famous surfing clan who, according to the desires of patriarch Dorian Paskowitz, lived their own alternative lifestyle for quite a few years especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Some say that this film is about surfing; but the focus is really on family and the rewards and problems that arise when idealistic lifestyles are taken to the extreme. Dorian ""Doc"" Paskowitz, the family patriarch who had a violent temper, cared little for conventional life and materialism after two failed marriages and a year in Israel where he taught surfing but couldn't enter the military. Dorian returned to the states and although he tried to fit in with doctors in Hawaii he was unable to do so. However, Dorian did find a new wife, Juliette, and together they traveled in relatively small (24 feet), used, beat up trailers despite the fact that Doc and Juliette were having babies all through the 1960s!

The first thirty or so minutes of the film paint a ""romantic"" portrait of the family. Dorian took his wife and children wherever he wanted to go, free of the stresses and strains of a much more conventional lifestyle. The cinematography is terrific; just the way those surfers were filmed was very well done. However, family problems become more and more intense and the family begins to fall apart as the children get older and rebel against ""Doc's"" very rigid beliefs--in fact, Dorian was such a dictator that his eldest son David literally starts to choke one of the younger brothers because Dorian told him to do so! The brothers and their one sister also have to endure the rather loud lovemaking Dorian and Juliette engage in every single night and we find out what happens when their only daughter walks in on them when they are making love in broad daylight.

The thing that really makes me mad about ""Doc's"" lifestyle is that not only did he beat his kids sometimes until they bled; he also denied his children access to education he almost ruined their chances to get ahead in the real world after they left the brood. True, some of the children did ""climb the ladder"" but most of them were unable to completely realize their potential. For example, Adam was unable to become a doctor because he had missed too much time in school. In addition, siblings fight about how to run the Paskowitz family surfing camp and money was squandered because the children were never taught how to manage money. Moreover, the eldest son, David, sings some song about how his father has ""to go"" before he'll ever truly feel free to be his own person; the truth in David's song is a tragic outrage. ""Doc"" seems to have little comprehension of what he did to his kids; he refers to them as ""lazy"" and he never misses an opportunity to tell anyone anytime where to go--his last statement to the filmmakers is that since they were doing a documentary about him and his family that means it should have never been done. This guy lacks basic social skills!

Interestingly enough, however, most of the children have no regrets about their childhood. They still love their parents and it's a huge credit to the now grown children that they did find ways to make it in the ""real world."" They are articulate, too. Son Israel, for example, helps run Surfers Healing, a program of surfing for autistic kids. I do wonder, however, what ever happened to the two daughters Dorian had by his first two wives.

The DVD comes with well done extras about ""Doc"" and the Paskowitz family.

Surfwise is quite a story about the Paskowitz family; I won't forget it anytime soon. I recommend this film for people who like documentaries, especially ones about people leading alternative lifestyles; and people who appreciate sports documentaries may also want to add this to their collections.",1355702400,,3848,4.7458893871449925

3176661,3,B00180R040,"Ah, the Paskowitz family! Think ""Into the Wild"" meets ""Beach Blanket."" Surfwise proves there are a LOT of ways to get from Point A to Point B and Dorian Paskowitz chose his own path for himself and his amphibian brood.

Not nearly as warm and fuzzy as surf legend Woody Brown, the dogmatic Dorian still exudes a odd charisma that's strangely watchable (sort of in the car wreck way). In the end, the family has similar gripes and similar joys to many families who do follow the middle-of-the-road script of life.",1339632000,,512,4.626373626373627

The dvd includes extraordinarily candid interviews with everyone from dad and mom to all the kids with family videos of growing up and traveling interspersed among the interviews. For anyone who has thought about chucking it all and living on next to nothing, this is a must see. It is particularly interesting because the father, Dorian Paskowitz, was a physician with exceptional training so had options career-wise that few people do. He clearly had definite ideas about what was important in life.",1325289600,2,638,4.8090909090909095
3176663,5,B00180R040,"This is a doc film about a man and wife who raised nine children in a surfing lifestyle, living for years out of a camper moving from beach to beach, never attending school. This took place primarily during the 70's when alternative lifestyles were being experimented with across America. In this case the prime mover was Doc Paskowitz, who held very definite ideas about health and education. Trained as an M.D., he had dropped out himself and his wife and nine children were expected to live out his ideas. What unfolded next is depicted in the film unflinchingly in both its up and down sides. On the one hand, does it not sound idyllic to grow up with no responsibilities except to surf all day, childhood and adolescence an endless summer? On the other hand, the filmakers do not shy away from showing Doc as a megalomaniac and fanatic, who to satisfy his own ego committed his children to being seriously compromised in adult life. In one poignant scene, one of the boys tells how his dream of attending Stanford medical school - just as his father had - proved impossible; he was simply too far behind educationally. He explains this while working as a short order cook.

The film made me angry. The experiences of the nine children in young adulthood had more in common with breaking free of a cult than emerging from a supportive family. Yes, the teachings of guru Paskowitz promoted a healthy and natural life in some ways, but he also comes across as a selfish and totalitarian father who takes no responsibility for the limitations he imposed on his children.

As a doc film, well produced and highly recommended.",1310428800,,1625,4.698245614035088

3176665,4,B00180R040,"This movie shows the results of too much good intentions force fed by an intelligent, single-minded dad who drops
out of the system.  He means well and takes the kids along for the ride and they do lead an ""adventurous"" life,
but at what costs?  the transition from surf adventure to family dysfunction is too abrupt and unexplored to fully
depict what transpired.  However, I believe the film maker wants the audience to fill in some of the blanks on their
own. And that benefits the legacy of Doc Paskowitz because some seem him as a ""bero"" and some as ""villian"" but tne realiy like any family is that he falls somewhere in between.",1285545600,,634,4.543859649122807
3176666,4,B00180R040,"Dorian ""Doc"" Paskowitz has been riding the waves for nigh unto three-quarters of a century now.  In 1956, at the age of 45, he abandoned a career as a doctor to pursue a life dedicated almost exclusively to surfing and raising a family - and he hasn't looked back since.  In fact, Doc and his family have achieved a notoriety of sorts (in surfing circles, at least) for their nonconformist, iconoclastic lifestyle, which involved all eleven of them living together in a cramped 24-foot camper trailer, avoiding any kind of formal schooling, and flitting from one beach to another in search of the perfect wave.  Now, in his mid 80s, Doc, along with his wife, Juliette, and their nine kids - eight of whom are named after Biblical figures - discuss their lives and upbringings in the fascinating documentary ""Surfwise"" by director Doug Pray.  Life literally has been a beach for these people.

The thing that strikes us most about Doc is that he is no self-conscious radical trying to make an ideological point with his life; rather, he's a fairly average guy who's honest enough to admit that he never much cared for school or the money-grubbing rat race of the corporate or business world and that he is simply much healthier and happier when in the water.  And it is these values that he has chosen to instill in his children, along with a devotion to their Jewish heritage and a healthy attitude towards sex (apparently, he and his wife were less than shy about showing their affection for one another in front of the children, much to the kids` consternation at times).

But there has been a definite downside to this nonconformity as well, and the movie does not shy away from depicting it - whether it be in Doc's dictatorial, even violent, methods of maintaining his authority over the kids or in the children's understandable desire to break free of their upbringing to lead a lifestyle more in accord with social norms.  And, of course, there's the resentment they've come to harbor in their later years towards a father who, by willfully choosing to separate them from the outside world, rendered them ill-equipped to function in that world once they became adults (one son laments that he could never attend medical school because he was too far behind all the other applicants in basic knowledge to successfully compete with them).  The movie raises the thorny issue of just how much right a parent has to deny his children the privileges and benefits that come from being socialized into the society around them.  Was Doc practicing a form of child abuse - or simple providing his kids with a rare and perhaps enviable opportunity to live life as one long summer camp?  (The family does actually run a camp of sorts dedicated to teaching the fine art of surfing to crowds of eager youngsters).  Even the kids themselves can't agree on the answer to that question, with some feeling the need to defend their dad and the way in which he raised them and others choosing to lash out at and lambaste him for the same reason.  Yet, the children could hardly be classified as dysfunctional adults, with each of them pursuing respectable careers and raising apparently stable and healthy families. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the documentary is that it leaves it up to the viewer to formulate his own assessment of Doc.  We're never pushed to take sides in the conflict.

Through Doc's story, ""Surfwise"" provides a fascinating look at what it means to be a family, what it means to be a parent, and why it's important to find a balance between the overindulgences of the modern world and the deprivations of a simple life, not completely ignoring one at the expense of the other.  The movie ends on an upbeat note with a long overdue reunion where old wounds are healed and old grudges put aside - all in the name of Family.  Which is, I suppose, as it should be.",1272758400,3,3879,4.689248895434463
3176667,5,B00180R040,This is a great documentary about the Paskowitz family.  It really captures their lives and thoughts about how they lived.  Very interesting!  Amazon did a great job with fast shipping and a great price.,1272758400,,203,4.911764705882353
3176678,5,B00180R040,"Surfwise is a one-of-a-kind documentary. In 1956, Dorian Paskowitz, a Stanford-educated physician with a successful medical practice decided to ""drop out"" to become a vagabond and a full-time surfer. Through the years, he married and fathered nine children, but continued his search for the perfect wave. Surfwise tells the Paskowitz family's story.

The interesting thing about this documentary is that Dorian forces the rest of us to confront life's biggest question - why aren't we doing what we'd like to be doing? Dorian shows that we could break free from our humdrum routines if only we had the courage. I'm not a surfer, but Surfwise certainly made me think.

But Dorian also shows why most of us choose conventional lives. Dorian refused to give in to society, not one inch. He kept his children out of school and ruled the family as a dictator. Dorian exploded when his eldest child left home - at age 23. Apparently, Dorian thought that his children should spend their lives chasing his vision.

When the kids grew up, they had no skills to offer employers. One of the film's heartbreaking moments occurs when one of the Paskowitz sons reveals that he always wanted to be a physician like his dad; the lack of an education made his dream impossible. The kids have varied feelings about their father, but many are bitter that Dorian's narcissism limited their opportunities.

While I really enjoyed this film, one thing that I did not like was the clumsy attempt to fashion an ending. I don't want to spoil the movie, but the ending seems contrived.

How far would you go to chase your dream? If you are at all philosophical, you will enjoy Surfwise because it raises these sorts of questions. But be aware that the film offers the viewer few easy answers. We all have to find those for ourselves.",1268265600,,1807,4.778846153846154

It's another if you subject nine innocent children to a lack of food, resources, schooling, peer contact, and then add physical and emotional abuse to that lovely equation. It's a wonder any of those kids have their heads screwed on tight. I'd like a follow-up film entitled ""After the Fake Reunion Which the Kids Have Been Paid to Fly to,"" and in which the father has died and five or ten more years have passed and they see how their father's legacy has screwed up the next generation.

After medical training at Stanford, a respectable career as a physician, two failed marriages, and then a sexcapade around the world, ""Doc"" married his third wife Juliette. They decided on a carefree life of radical non-conformity centered around surfing. For the next twenty-five years they raised their nine kids (eight boys, one girl) in three different 24' RV campers. Daily surfing and strict diets were compulsory, formal schooling of any kind was prohibited, and money was scarce. Their whimsical lives as vagabonds sounds fun, but ""Doc's"" uncompromising idealism and tyrannical ways amounted to physical and emotional abuse according to interviews with his adult kids. After ten years of bitter acrimony as the adult kids tried to make their way in the real world with absolutely no preparation for it, the family meets for an emotional reunion in the last part of the film. Even a badly broken family is better than no family, weeps Juliette at the reunion, but this film makes you wonder. Jonathan Paskowitz helped to produce the film.",1234828800,3,1153,5.138297872340425

The latter includes spouse and some nine kids, who live a bohemian, itinerant, surf-centric lifestyle in a 24-foot camper van.  No school for these kids!  Nevertheless, they lived a somewhat regimented existence, one envied by kids who were more wealthy in material things.

All of the kids grew up with various ""baggage"" due to the unorthodox upbringing, and the father is a rather magnetic, charismatic character.

The cinematography here is great - you feel you are out in the ocean, in the surf, and can see how this aspect of nature would be seductive. SURFWISE raises questions about the tradeoffs involved in turning your back on the conventional path that society beckons you to follow - the good and bad features, the frayed nature of family ties, the family love that can (at least temporarily) transcend differences and childhood trauma.

3176694,4,B00180R040,"""Surfwise"" chronicles the story of the ""first family of surfing"": Dorian ""Doc"" Paskowitz, his wife Juliette, and the 9 children whom they raised in a 24-foot camper, traveling up and down the west coast of the United States and Mexico, following the waves and Dorian's whims for more than 2 decades. Dorian Paskowitz was a respected public health doctor and president of the American Medical Association in Hawaii, before he left it all behind in 1956 to live a peripatetic life of poverty that revolved around surfing. He isolated his family from the outside world, raised his children in his strict lifestyle regimen, and taught them to surf. Many became accomplished competitive surfers, and in 1974 the family opened the Paskowitz Surf Camp in Mission Beach, CA.

Dorian Paskowitz was 84 years old when ""Surfwise"" was made and still very much a passionate and controlling man, and still surfing. His children are all grown and living very different lifestyles from the one in which they were raised. Director Doug Pray tries to construct a picture of what it was like to be a Paskowitz, living the ideals of a single-minded patriarch in a crowded camper, and what its lasting effects were through archival home movies and interviews with Dorian and Juliette Paskowitz and all 9 of their children -7 boys and 1 girl- and Dorian's siblings. We also get an impression of the family's iconic stature and influence on surfing culture through interviews with ""The Surfer's Journal"" founder Steve Pezman and some big names in competitive surfing.

The Paskowitz children talk about the benefits and disappointments of their itinerant, impoverished lifestyle, isolated from most of American culture. They don't all have the same attitude toward it, in retrospect, some resenting that their isolation and lack of education left them unprepared for adult life. I would have thought children in such a bohemian environment would be very independent, but their father's controlling nature apparently dictated otherwise. ""Surfwise"" is an interesting account for fans of surfing culture, but this is, more than anything, the story of a family. It's an examination of the value of nonconformity and convention, selfishness and freedom, in the way families relate to one another and the ways in which upbringing may or may not influence the choices people make.

The DVD (Magnolia 2008): There are 4 featurettes and a feature commentary. In ""Doc on Health"" (5 min), Dorian Paskowitz explains his ideas on health, about which he has written a book. ""A Walk on Water: Surfer's Healing"" (3  min) is about the surfing program for autistic children founded by Izzy Paskowitz and wife Danielle. ""Dave Homcy: Surfing Cinematographer"" (3 1/2  min) is footage of surfers set to music. ""Outtakes and Breaks"" (12 min) are interviews not in the film, including some funny ones. The feature commentary is by director Doug Pray, producer Matt Weaver, and Salvador Paskowitz. They discuss the genesis of the project, the archival footage, Dorian and his philosophy, the family dynamic, and more. Subtitles for the film are available in Spanish.",1218067200,10,3117,5.1400394477317555
3176695,5,B00180R040,"I picked up this DVD thinking that it was going to be a lighthearted look at a family that I knew 'of' from the time I was a youngster.  I grew up surfing in San Diego, and used to see the ads for the Paskowitz Surf Camp in the back of just about every surf magazine I ever purchased.  I always wanted to attend, but ended up buying a board and teaching myself instead.

What I found was the story of a very strange family.  Sometimes their life looks so wonderful it makes me want to get a camper and take my kids away from the materialism and lunacy we experience in modern life. Other times are dark, contradictory and a bit disturbing.

What I took away from this amazing dissection of a unique family was to affirm my feeling that 'everything' in moderation is the way to live. I also will be more careful about avoiding attempts to control people in my life.

Highly recommended.",1217894400,7,885,4.301204819277109
3176696,4,B00180R040,"""Surfwise"" is another fascinating feature-length documentary by filmmaker Doug Pray, who has made several amusing, enlightening films on pop-culture sub-groups such as the Seattle grunge scene (""Hype"") and hip-hop DJ turntabulists (""Scratch"").

In this new film he paints a one-third celebratory, two-thirds tragic portrait of the Paskowitz family, a once-legendary surfing clan whose patriarch, Dorian ""Doc"" Paskowitz dropped out of mainstream society in the late 1950s, to follow a near-absolute rejection of modern materialism. Paskowitz and his wife traveled anywhere on a whim for over a decade, surfing up and down the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of North America, surfing, having lots of sex and making lots of babies. In all, the Paskowitzes had nine children, eight boys and one girl, and raised them outside the confines of ""straight"" life. Instead of going to school, the children surfed, and were reared according to their father's bold, yet ill-defined personal ethic.

Although Doc's decision to drop out preceded the hippie movement by almost a decade, his family's journey intersected with the 1960s hippie-era rejection of cultural norms, and with the ""Me Generation"" self-absorption of the '70s. But while these larger cultural shifts were widespread, the choices of the Paskowitz family were much more far-reaching and severe than most of the counterculture types of the time. With no fixed income and a total abandonment of the American work ethic, the Paskowitzes were both legendary and tragic. As the children came of age, the strains of traveling together in a small camper intensified, and the family fragmented and fell apart.

Just how much they fell apart is revealed in the film's second half, which skillfully explores the dark side of Doc's impulsive and absolutist philosophical rejectionism. Each of the (now grown-up) children reflect on the internal pressures (and joys) of their extreme lifestyle, and how completely unprepared it left them to make their own entry into adult life. Although the Paskowitzes dominated surf competitions in the early 1970s -- and got considerable media attention and corporate sponsorship --  because they were so naive about money matters, none of them held onto the money or the opportunities they made, and their professional careers largely fizzled out. Many of the children rightfully express their anger towards their parents for leaving them stranded without education or options, and the film is a fascinating reflection on the potential hazards of extreme alternative lifestyles.  Although Doc Paskowitz clearly shoulders much of the blame, he remains a roguish and compelling figure. Many of his critiques of modern society are pointed and incisive, and his candid assessments of consumerism, wage slavery and sexual repression are attractive due to his bluntness and accuracy. It is a complex portrait, and doesn't offer easy answers to the viewer, but rather many disturbing points to ponder. Definitely worth checking out.

3176697,4,B00180R040,"Anyone looking for a glorious ode to the surfing life should pause a moment before viewing this terrific documentary film about life in the Paskowitz family.  Although surfing was the stated main focus of this highly unconventional family's life, it's not the center of the story that's revealed in the film.  Kudos to the filmmakers, who peel back the layers of the story gradually until you gather the sense of the awfulness at the center.  We see a life that on the face of it might appear appealing -- who hasn't at some time or other wished for a more 'authentic' life?  What if we could slip the rules of the prevailing society?  What if we weren't forced to be educated in institutional settings?  This film and all the Paskowitz children, who thankfully are brave enough to speak of what they endured at the whims of two of the most narcissistic parents you'll ever meet, will give some answers to those questions.  Abundant with archival footage that makes the past come alive, the film also gives us interviews with everyone in the family that will resonate with you for a long time after you view it.  You may well be left with lots of questions after it's over, but one is very happy to see that the kids seem to have made good lives for themselves despite the bad models that were their parents.  In any case, this is a film for anyone who loves good documentary filmmaking -- you don't have to know anything about surfing to appreciate this one.",1215216000,21,1459,4.559386973180077

What I thought started out as a video of an epic odyssey of the magic and spiritualality of surfing and the surfing lifestyle, became a chronicle about a self absorbed and abusive man engaged in denial and cover up of severe dysfunction.  I don't have any quarrel with raising and home schooling kids outside the system, a healthy active sex life, discipline, and surf, surf, surfing.  I think these are goals to aspire to.  I assert that there was and is a very very dark side to Dorian and his family life that revealed itself in episodes where he encouraged one child to choke another.  That is just completely unacceptable. Such psychology and behavior only sullies the reputation of surfing and surfers and reinforces the unfortunate stereotypes that many people have about surfing and surfers.  I suspect that if we pull the cover completely off the Poskowitz family we'd find severe child abuse of the sort intolerable to all but predators.",1214006400,6,1064,4.845303867403315

3411155,5,B00180R040,"This film does a superb job of telling the incredible true story of the Paskowitz family, a once famous surfing clan who, according to the desires of patriarch Dorian Paskowitz, lived their own alternative lifestyle for quite a few years especially in the 1960s and 1970s. Some say that this film is about surfing; but the focus is really on family and the rewards and problems that arise when idealistic lifestyles are taken to the extreme. Dorian ""Doc"" Paskowitz, the family patriarch who had a violent temper, cared little for conventional life and materialism after two failed marriages and a year in Israel where he taught surfing but couldn't enter the military. Dorian returned to the states and although he tried to fit in with doctors in Hawaii he was unable to do so. However, Dorian did find a new wife, Juliette, and together they traveled in relatively small (24 feet), used, beat up trailers despite the fact that Doc and Juliette were having babies all through the 1960s!

The first thirty or so minutes of the film paint a ""romantic"" portrait of the family. Dorian took his wife and children wherever he wanted to go, free of the stresses and strains of a much more conventional lifestyle. The cinematography is terrific; just the way those surfers were filmed was very well done. However, family problems become more and more intense and the family begins to fall apart as the children get older and rebel against ""Doc's"" very rigid beliefs--in fact, Dorian was such a dictator that his eldest son David literally starts to choke one of the younger brothers because Dorian told him to do so! The brothers and their one sister also have to endure the rather loud lovemaking Dorian and Juliette engage in every single night and we find out what happens when their only daughter walks in on them when they are making love in broad daylight.

The thing that really makes me mad about ""Doc's"" lifestyle is that not only did he beat his kids sometimes until they bled; he also denied his children access to education he almost ruined their chances to get ahead in the real world after they left the brood. True, some of the children did ""climb the ladder"" but most of them were unable to completely realize their potential. For example, Adam was unable to become a doctor because he had missed too much time in school. In addition, siblings fight about how to run the Paskowitz family surfing camp and money was squandered because the children were never taught how to manage money. Moreover, the eldest son, David, sings some song about how his father has ""to go"" before he'll ever truly feel free to be his own person; the truth in David's song is a tragic outrage. ""Doc"" seems to have little comprehension of what he did to his kids; he refers to them as ""lazy"" and he never misses an opportunity to tell anyone anytime where to go--his last statement to the filmmakers is that since they were doing a documentary about him and his family that means it should have never been done. This guy lacks basic social skills!

Interestingly enough, however, most of the children have no regrets about their childhood. They still love their parents and it's a huge credit to the now grown children that they did find ways to make it in the ""real world."" They are articulate, too. Son Israel, for example, helps run Surfers Healing, a program of surfing for autistic kids. I do wonder, however, what ever happened to the two daughters Dorian had by his first two wives.

The DVD comes with well done extras about ""Doc"" and the Paskowitz family.

Surfwise is quite a story about the Paskowitz family; I won't forget it anytime soon. I recommend this film for people who like documentaries, especially ones about people leading alternative lifestyles; and people who appreciate sports documentaries may also want to add this to their collections.",1355702400,,3848,4.7458893871449925

3411160,5,B00180R040,"This is a doc film about a man and wife who raised nine children in a surfing lifestyle, living for years out of a camper moving from beach to beach, never attending school. This took place primarily during the 70's when alternative lifestyles were being experimented with across America. In this case the prime mover was Doc Paskowitz, who held very definite ideas about health and education. Trained as an M.D., he had dropped out himself and his wife and nine children were expected to live out his ideas. What unfolded next is depicted in the film unflinchingly in both its up and down sides. On the one hand, does it not sound idyllic to grow up with no responsibilities except to surf all day, childhood and adolescence an endless summer? On the other hand, the filmakers do not shy away from showing Doc as a megalomaniac and fanatic, who to satisfy his own ego committed his children to being seriously compromised in adult life. In one poignant scene, one of the boys tells how his dream of attending Stanford medical school - just as his father had - proved impossible; he was simply too far behind educationally. He explains this while working as a short order cook.

The film made me angry. The experiences of the nine children in young adulthood had more in common with breaking free of a cult than emerging from a supportive family. Yes, the teachings of guru Paskowitz promoted a healthy and natural life in some ways, but he also comes across as a selfish and totalitarian father who takes no responsibility for the limitations he imposed on his children.

3411163,4,B00180R040,"Dorian ""Doc"" Paskowitz has been riding the waves for nigh unto three-quarters of a century now.  In 1956, at the age of 45, he abandoned a career as a doctor to pursue a life dedicated almost exclusively to surfing and raising a family - and he hasn't looked back since.  In fact, Doc and his family have achieved a notoriety of sorts (in surfing circles, at least) for their nonconformist, iconoclastic lifestyle, which involved all eleven of them living together in a cramped 24-foot camper trailer, avoiding any kind of formal schooling, and flitting from one beach to another in search of the perfect wave.  Now, in his mid 80s, Doc, along with his wife, Juliette, and their nine kids - eight of whom are named after Biblical figures - discuss their lives and upbringings in the fascinating documentary ""Surfwise"" by director Doug Pray.  Life literally has been a beach for these people.

The thing that strikes us most about Doc is that he is no self-conscious radical trying to make an ideological point with his life; rather, he's a fairly average guy who's honest enough to admit that he never much cared for school or the money-grubbing rat race of the corporate or business world and that he is simply much healthier and happier when in the water.  And it is these values that he has chosen to instill in his children, along with a devotion to their Jewish heritage and a healthy attitude towards sex (apparently, he and his wife were less than shy about showing their affection for one another in front of the children, much to the kids` consternation at times).

But there has been a definite downside to this nonconformity as well, and the movie does not shy away from depicting it - whether it be in Doc's dictatorial, even violent, methods of maintaining his authority over the kids or in the children's understandable desire to break free of their upbringing to lead a lifestyle more in accord with social norms.  And, of course, there's the resentment they've come to harbor in their later years towards a father who, by willfully choosing to separate them from the outside world, rendered them ill-equipped to function in that world once they became adults (one son laments that he could never attend medical school because he was too far behind all the other applicants in basic knowledge to successfully compete with them).  The movie raises the thorny issue of just how much right a parent has to deny his children the privileges and benefits that come from being socialized into the society around them.  Was Doc practicing a form of child abuse - or simple providing his kids with a rare and perhaps enviable opportunity to live life as one long summer camp?  (The family does actually run a camp of sorts dedicated to teaching the fine art of surfing to crowds of eager youngsters).  Even the kids themselves can't agree on the answer to that question, with some feeling the need to defend their dad and the way in which he raised them and others choosing to lash out at and lambaste him for the same reason.  Yet, the children could hardly be classified as dysfunctional adults, with each of them pursuing respectable careers and raising apparently stable and healthy families. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the documentary is that it leaves it up to the viewer to formulate his own assessment of Doc.  We're never pushed to take sides in the conflict.

Through Doc's story, ""Surfwise"" provides a fascinating look at what it means to be a family, what it means to be a parent, and why it's important to find a balance between the overindulgences of the modern world and the deprivations of a simple life, not completely ignoring one at the expense of the other.  The movie ends on an upbeat note with a long overdue reunion where old wounds are healed and old grudges put aside - all in the name of Family.  Which is, I suppose, as it should be.",1272758400,3,3879,4.689248895434463

3411175,5,B00180R040,"Surfwise is a one-of-a-kind documentary. In 1956, Dorian Paskowitz, a Stanford-educated physician with a successful medical practice decided to ""drop out"" to become a vagabond and a full-time surfer. Through the years, he married and fathered nine children, but continued his search for the perfect wave. Surfwise tells the Paskowitz family's story.

The interesting thing about this documentary is that Dorian forces the rest of us to confront life's biggest question - why aren't we doing what we'd like to be doing? Dorian shows that we could break free from our humdrum routines if only we had the courage. I'm not a surfer, but Surfwise certainly made me think.

But Dorian also shows why most of us choose conventional lives. Dorian refused to give in to society, not one inch. He kept his children out of school and ruled the family as a dictator. Dorian exploded when his eldest child left home - at age 23. Apparently, Dorian thought that his children should spend their lives chasing his vision.

When the kids grew up, they had no skills to offer employers. One of the film's heartbreaking moments occurs when one of the Paskowitz sons reveals that he always wanted to be a physician like his dad; the lack of an education made his dream impossible. The kids have varied feelings about their father, but many are bitter that Dorian's narcissism limited their opportunities.

While I really enjoyed this film, one thing that I did not like was the clumsy attempt to fashion an ending. I don't want to spoil the movie, but the ending seems contrived.

How far would you go to chase your dream? If you are at all philosophical, you will enjoy Surfwise because it raises these sorts of questions. But be aware that the film offers the viewer few easy answers. We all have to find those for ourselves.",1268265600,,1807,4.778846153846154

3411191,4,B00180R040,"""Surfwise"" chronicles the story of the ""first family of surfing"": Dorian ""Doc"" Paskowitz, his wife Juliette, and the 9 children whom they raised in a 24-foot camper, traveling up and down the west coast of the United States and Mexico, following the waves and Dorian's whims for more than 2 decades. Dorian Paskowitz was a respected public health doctor and president of the American Medical Association in Hawaii, before he left it all behind in 1956 to live a peripatetic life of poverty that revolved around surfing. He isolated his family from the outside world, raised his children in his strict lifestyle regimen, and taught them to surf. Many became accomplished competitive surfers, and in 1974 the family opened the Paskowitz Surf Camp in Mission Beach, CA.

Dorian Paskowitz was 84 years old when ""Surfwise"" was made and still very much a passionate and controlling man, and still surfing. His children are all grown and living very different lifestyles from the one in which they were raised. Director Doug Pray tries to construct a picture of what it was like to be a Paskowitz, living the ideals of a single-minded patriarch in a crowded camper, and what its lasting effects were through archival home movies and interviews with Dorian and Juliette Paskowitz and all 9 of their children -7 boys and 1 girl- and Dorian's siblings. We also get an impression of the family's iconic stature and influence on surfing culture through interviews with ""The Surfer's Journal"" founder Steve Pezman and some big names in competitive surfing.

The Paskowitz children talk about the benefits and disappointments of their itinerant, impoverished lifestyle, isolated from most of American culture. They don't all have the same attitude toward it, in retrospect, some resenting that their isolation and lack of education left them unprepared for adult life. I would have thought children in such a bohemian environment would be very independent, but their father's controlling nature apparently dictated otherwise. ""Surfwise"" is an interesting account for fans of surfing culture, but this is, more than anything, the story of a family. It's an examination of the value of nonconformity and convention, selfishness and freedom, in the way families relate to one another and the ways in which upbringing may or may not influence the choices people make.

The DVD (Magnolia 2008): There are 4 featurettes and a feature commentary. In ""Doc on Health"" (5 min), Dorian Paskowitz explains his ideas on health, about which he has written a book. ""A Walk on Water: Surfer's Healing"" (3  min) is about the surfing program for autistic children founded by Izzy Paskowitz and wife Danielle. ""Dave Homcy: Surfing Cinematographer"" (3 1/2  min) is footage of surfers set to music. ""Outtakes and Breaks"" (12 min) are interviews not in the film, including some funny ones. The feature commentary is by director Doug Pray, producer Matt Weaver, and Salvador Paskowitz. They discuss the genesis of the project, the archival footage, Dorian and his philosophy, the family dynamic, and more.

I grew up surfing in San Diego, and used to see the ads for the Paskowitz Surf Camp in the back of just about every surf magazine I ever purchased.  I always wanted to attend, but ended up buying a board and teaching myself instead.

What I found was the story of a very strange family.  Sometimes their life looks so wonderful it makes me want to get a camper and take my kids away from the materialism and lunacy we experience in modern life. Other times are dark, contradictory and a bit disturbing.

What I took away from this amazing dissection of a unique family was to affirm my feeling that 'everything' in moderation is the way to live. I also will be more careful about avoiding attempts to control people in my life.

3411193,4,B00180R040,"""Surfwise"" is another fascinating feature-length documentary by filmmaker Doug Pray, who has made several amusing, enlightening films on pop-culture sub-groups such as the Seattle grunge scene (""Hype"") and hip-hop DJ turntabulists (""Scratch"").

In this new film he paints a one-third celebratory, two-thirds tragic portrait of the Paskowitz family, a once-legendary surfing clan whose patriarch, Dorian ""Doc"" Paskowitz dropped out of mainstream society in the late 1950s, to follow a near-absolute rejection of modern materialism. Paskowitz and his wife traveled anywhere on a whim for over a decade, surfing up and down the Pacific, Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of North America, surfing, having lots of sex and making lots of babies. In all, the Paskowitzes had nine children, eight boys and one girl, and raised them outside the confines of ""straight"" life. Instead of going to school, the children surfed, and were reared according to their father's bold, yet ill-defined personal ethic.

Although Doc's decision to drop out preceded the hippie movement by almost a decade, his family's journey intersected with the 1960s hippie-era rejection of cultural norms, and with the ""Me Generation"" self-absorption of the '70s. But while these larger cultural shifts were widespread, the choices of the Paskowitz family were much more far-reaching and severe than most of the counterculture types of the time. With no fixed income and a total abandonment of the American work ethic, the Paskowitzes were both legendary and tragic. As the children came of age, the strains of traveling together in a small camper intensified, and the family fragmented and fell apart.

Just how much they fell apart is revealed in the film's second half, which skillfully explores the dark side of Doc's impulsive and absolutist philosophical rejectionism. Each of the (now grown-up) children reflect on the internal pressures (and joys) of their extreme lifestyle, and how completely unprepared it left them to make their own entry into adult life. Although the Paskowitzes dominated surf competitions in the early 1970s -- and got considerable media attention and corporate sponsorship --  because they were so naive about money matters, none of them held onto the money or the opportunities they made, and their professional careers largely fizzled out. Many of the children rightfully express their anger towards their parents for leaving them stranded without education or options, and the film is a fascinating reflection on the potential hazards of extreme alternative lifestyles.  Although Doc Paskowitz clearly shoulders much of the blame, he remains a roguish and compelling figure. Many of his critiques of modern society are pointed and incisive, and his candid assessments of consumerism, wage slavery and sexual repression are attractive due to his bluntness and accuracy. It is a complex portrait, and doesn't offer easy answers to the viewer, but rather many disturbing points to ponder. Definitely worth checking out.

3411194,4,B00180R040,"Anyone looking for a glorious ode to the surfing life should pause a moment before viewing this terrific documentary film about life in the Paskowitz family.  Although surfing was the stated main focus of this highly unconventional family's life, it's not the center of the story that's revealed in the film.  Kudos to the filmmakers, who peel back the layers of the story gradually until you gather the sense of the awfulness at the center.  We see a life that on the face of it might appear appealing -- who hasn't at some time or other wished for a more 'authentic' life?  What if we could slip the rules of the prevailing society?  What if we weren't forced to be educated in institutional settings?  This film and all the Paskowitz children, who thankfully are brave enough to speak of what they endured at the whims of two of the most narcissistic parents you'll ever meet, will give some answers to those questions.  Abundant with archival footage that makes the past come alive, the film also gives us interviews with everyone in the family that will resonate with you for a long time after you view it.  You may well be left with lots of questions after it's over, but one is very happy to see that the kids seem to have made good lives for themselves despite the bad models that were their parents.
