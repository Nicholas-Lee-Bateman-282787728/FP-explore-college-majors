But, if you like your monsters not to be upstaged by gore, violence, and sadistic intent then this just may be your cup of tea.

I would highly recommend you sit in a room with friends when watching this and just find everything joke possible to poke fun of this film because it is supposed to be cheesy.  Don't get me wrong, it isn't like some of those movies where they are trying to be overly poking fun of how these b-movies of the 1950's and 1960's were so bad.  The movie maker actually tries to pay respect to the genre by creating a movie that would become a part of the genre, not a comedy.  The actors get the genre b-movie acting spot on.  I found this enjoyable.  I do highly recommend you see ""The Monster of Phantom Lake"" first.  That movie introduces several of the characters that are in this one.

2947466,2,B000VSDN1O,"I wanted to like ""It Came From Another World."" I really, REALLY did.
But it is sheer agony to sit through.
Lost Skeleton of Cadavra's success has inspired a breed of well intentioned, cheesy genre parody/homage films made by amateurs and that's GREAT, but...
It takes more than a tiny cast speaking stilted dialogue in the woods to expect people to part with twelve or fifteen bucks to buy a DVD.
When the humor comes naturally from the character interplay, as with the two ""Special Police"" (Special is the word alright) it's perfectly fine. Unfortunately, that's the exception here, not the rule.
Unfortunately, the audio commentary makes it clear that the filmmakers are madly in love with what they have done, in the style they've done it. I think I heard the phrase ""You know you love it"" or something to that effect 3 or 4 times in the 15 minutes or so of commentary that I made it through.
Maybe I've just seen too many amateur movies where people with obvious talent waste opportunities because they don't realize you have to give it 100% in every frame to actually make waves in the direct-to-dvd world, and a ten minute sketch dragged out to feature length just...
won't...

2947541,2,B000VSDN1O,"I like Christopher Mihm's movies. I just didn't like this one. It's ok to make one that isn't that good. 6 out 7 ain't bad (at the time of this writing).

I love these 'tribute' movies to sci-fi in the 50's. This movie parodies some obvious movies some not so obvious. I wasn't sure why the professor kept pausing when speaking. Perhaps this was a play on William Shatner? If so, it wasn't a very good parody.
'It Came From Another World!' parodies many different movies. The movie starts out with a small meteor landing in the forest. A scene reminiscent of 'The Blob.' I'm not sure how the idea for the eyes came about but they look very similar to those used in 'Killers from Space.' A earthling being possessed by an alien being has occurred in too many movies to mention. Off the top of my head, there is Invaders from Mars, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, I Married a Monster From Outer Space, etc. The title was obviously derived from 'It Came From Outer Space.""

I felt that this movie was too 'talky.' While most of these tribute movies are 'talky,' they usually at least move along. This movie feels as if it was 'stuck in the mud' for a good portion of it, especially the first half. The plot moved very slowly throughout the entire length of the movie.

I want to be clear here, even though I am being critical of this particular movie, I will continue to buy these types of movies and future movies by the same director. I throw my full support behind these efforts and feel kind of guilty awarding just 2 stars to this movie. I would probably rate it higher if I hadn't already seen better efforts by the same director.

Recommended strictly for people who want to own all of Christopher Mihm's movies. I am one of them. If you want to buy a tribute movie from the 50's, the same director has made others ranging from good to excellent.

2947545,4,B000VSDN1O,"I'm a fan of B-movies, and a fan of some faux B-movies (e.g. ""The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra""). Christopher R. Mihm has made a series of these films, and while ""It Came From Another World!"" is not my favorite of the lot (which is ""Attack of the Moon Zombies"") I still found enjoyment here. This film is noteworthy for a few nicely-placed comedic bits (e.g. Sven and Gustav, the Canoe Police, and the canoe paddle duel) and cult references (e.g. Professor Jackson's Shatnerian pauses) and overall the film is played more for comedy than some of Mihm's other movies.

This film features a meteorite capable of human possession, in this case Dr. Frasier (Mike Mason) has a bug-eyed possession courtesy of ""The King of the Universe"", who is pitted against our hero, Professor Jackson (Josh Craig) in a fight to save all of humanity. Along the way, in addition to swollen eyeballs, canoe humor, romance, and a hilariously dubbed scene of music around a campfire, there's a lot of ridiculous science babble (""We've achieved full subatomic demoleculation!"") that echoes the movies from the '50s and '60s that Mihm obviously seeks to emulate.

The DVD has a ton of extras including the amusing ""Eyeball Malfunctions"", some good deleted scenes, a decent photo gallery, a mixed bag of a blooper reel (it's long, but more consistently entertaining than in some Mihm films), and a commentary track with Mihm and Craig which I liked. Look out particularly for the musical scene and campfire blooper, which I loved.

If you've seen other Mihm films, you know what to expect. If you like his moviemaking you'll like this; there's lots of familiar Mihm faces here for fans of the series, and as in most of the films a special highlight is Mike Cook's performance, here seen as Gustav.

Beyond that, the use of the ""Pregnat Pause"" by Prof. Jackson is extremely well done and bigly suspenseful.",1523491200,,331,4.610169491525424

8219712,4,B000VSDN1O,"Good intentional bad acting. Not sure on homage for the pauses, however, some excruciatingly long pauses are somewhat funny. The sun block goggles effect is hilarious. A good funny sci-fi",1519689600,,187,5.266666666666667

8219714,1,B000VSDN1O,"Skip this spoof of 1950-era SciFi.  There are many better, and funnier, such as ""The Giant Spider"".  This movie has about 4 primary running gags, none of which are very funny.  One, where the scientist pauses increasingly long before completing sentences, gets old really fast.  Humor shouldn't be boring.  Mix a few ""spot jokes"" and several ""sight gags"" that almost always take too much screen time, you have the majority of the movie.  Acting could be called bad, except that the extreme overacting is intentional, though excessive.  Editing and direction gaps add to the movie's issues, and are inconsistent with the 1950s B-movie motif.",1519516800,,640,5.096153846153846
8219715,1,B000VSDN1O,"technically a better than average parody of a 1950 Scifi movie, except  most 1950 movies had better actoring. The timing of delivery  was so off, I assumed it had to be intentional.  Had to give up watching.",1518393600,,207,4.54054054054054

Absofreakinlutely HILARIOUS!

""Those Eyes!""
The late and much lamented Peter Aurness (aka Peter Graves) would have recognized them and so do I!
Once again the decade of the 1950s is captured perfectly.  Shannon McDonough's outfits and hairstyles are delightful. Especially the outfit with all the petticoats she is wearing when Dr Frasier (Mike Mason) encounters her after his night with Elisabeth (the Owl Girl) so beautifully played by Deanne McDonald,

Honestly, between Michael Cook and M. Scorr Taulman (Gustav and Sven, the Canoe Cops), the suave Josh Craig once again on hand as Professor Shatner...er JACKSON and this goofy but loveable tribute to the drive in classics of my youth I cannot FAULT this one at all!

You hit this one out of the park, guys!",1516320000,,787,4.9393939393939394
