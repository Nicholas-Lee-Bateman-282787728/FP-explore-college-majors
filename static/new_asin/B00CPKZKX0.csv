5732475,5,B00CPKZKX0,"Like many, I discovered Iceberg Slim's,  absolutely stunning, novels @ an outdoor news stand in Hollywood. The first being Long White Con, which is still one of my favorites; after reading the first paragraph, I realized I had something special & was immediately hooked. I bought his entire collection @ that stand, and began obsessively pouring over them. They're such unique & intimate stories that transport you to that time & place in which they're set. Slim is a master storyteller (especially in really life), who never judges his characters; simply painting an honest portrait of their lives, dreams & abilities. Even the worst of them are given a rich inner life. This important documentary, about one of the most important authors of all time, is full of intimate & revealing information about Slim. His youth, his growth & his transformation from an enlightened, but deeply troubled, pimp & con man into an enlightened, but deeply troubled, author who changed the entire game. He gave voice to the voiceless & allowed the world to truly see a slice of society that most would never see or understand without his rollicking & addictive novels. You should watch this movie & read his books. They're both full of gold & power that will resonate & educate for centuries to come.",1521849600,,1284,4.889908256880734

5732480,5,B00CPKZKX0,"An author I followed back when I was in grade school. His books were entertaining, informative, and real. Raw to the bone real. I enjoyed watching the film because I was always curious to see what Iceberg Slim looked like and how he came off as a person. I got the impression that he was as genuine as a ex-pimp, ex drug dealer and user could be, and I know from personal experience what drugs and living the fast life can do to a person. Iceberg Slim wrote in a stark and highly descriptive way of the pitfalls and pain that self destruction brings to black folks who choose to go down this pathway of life. He will always be a hero to me and most black people in America. It warmed my heart to see the beautiful and intelligent children that he and his wife brought up. It was plain that he did a good job of being a parent to his daughters. Rest in peace Ice, you did a lot to educate us from your personal experiences.",1469577600,3,922,4.156424581005586

5732482,2,B00CPKZKX0,"As a fun, full-family feature, this film is an abject failure. It's truly shocking that these filmmakers would intend for good Christian moms and dads to subject their beloved children to a sordid documentary about a horrible bad man -- a deeply disturbed African-American pimp, for the Good Lord's sake. The comedy was awful, but I think the kids will get a big kick from the musical dance numbers and terrific special FX. OK, maybe it's not so bad after all.",1463529600,,460,4.691358024691358

 received.  It is extremely well written and a must read to understand rap culture and life as it was (and still is, I might say) in the earlier 1900's.  It is one of those books and people that opened my eyes and I will n

It also shows his family life which is especially poignant considering one of his daughters featured in the film recently died of an overdose.

5732520,5,B00CPKZKX0,"Recently shown on Premium cable, this documentary is about Robert Beck, alias Iceberg Slim. His wife and daughters appear in the film, as well as his fans Ice-T, Chris Rock and others. Iceberg Slim has long been a component of the underground black street culture, I first read his book in 1970.
The film shows how the man became an author and was massively underpaid for the millions of his books sold by his publisher
His estate has a new publisher now, which I assume will be more financially beneficial..
This film is not about sex. There are many humorous anecdotes. Iceberg's great talent was as a storyteller. This film is not an instructional video on pimping.",1405296000,3,668,4.717948717948718

5732523,5,B00CPKZKX0,"I didn't realize that this film would touch me so deeply, but my applause to Ice T and Misty Beck among others for creating this tribute to one of the most important and unsung literary legends of our time, Mr. Robert Beck, aka Iceberg Slim. Growing up on the streets of Detroit, my options were few, work at a factory, deal drugs or hustle on the streets. Leaning towards the life of a thief and a hustler, I began examining the pimping game, loving the glamour, the ""celebrity,"" for which it brought with it, and of course, the women. However, praise to God that before I began to descend into that ""street poison,"" as Mr. Beck calls it, I read his books, The Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim, and Pimp: The Story of My Life. Mr. Beck's vivid accounts of ""The Life,"" and his fall into drug addiction and incarceration opened my eyes to the realities of such a life. Mr. Beck also turned my dreams of street hustling into a dream of being a writer, having been the first writer I had ever read who so eloquently blended articulation with street savvy; in other words, Ice made it cool to be both book smart and street smart. I wish that I could have met him before his passing, for he was truly a mentor and a hero, to a cat from the ghetto who really needed one at the time. Excellent work, and highly recommended to anyone, African American or of any nationality who wants to understand this paradox of a man, and his vision.",1404086400,4,1422,4.349624060150376
5732524,4,B00CPKZKX0,The movie really showed us what we didn't know about being a pimp!! It's nothing like what we thought obviously.,1401840000,,112,4.65
5732525,4,B00CPKZKX0,Wasn't a true pimp for very long. Sort of a surprise if you know his books. Wild life story though. Pretty cool.,1401408000,,112,4.136363636363637
5732526,5,B00CPKZKX0,This is entertaining as well as informative. There is lessons to be learned from his mistakes. I really believe he had a good heart as he aged.,1401321600,,143,4.333333333333333
5732527,5,B00CPKZKX0,"Great documentary. Chronicles the life and times of Robert Beck aka Iceberg Slim and focuses on his rise to fame as well as his struggles. Initially viewed it as a glamorization of the pimp life, but found that it instead is a stern warning against it. Beck himself viewed the life as detestable and harmful to the overall well being of society and in particular African Americans. Entertaining picture overall!",1401235200,3,411,4.885714285714286
5732528,5,B00CPKZKX0,I had heard alot about IceBerg Slim when i was growing up. A lot of my guy cousins wanted to be cool like him cause thats what he stood for....i found the whole idea disgusting...and I still do but there was more to the man than just a nasty womazing husteler......and i understand even more from this documentary.....in order to bring the pain..you have to be in pain...and Iceberg Slim was deifnately walking wounded who once he knew and had the courage to do better ...did better. UNfortunately too many of our Rapstars and some older men have the very worst of the Iceberg Slim lesson in life . I was suprised to see Chris Rock and Quincy Jones...be as raw as they were But i made for a deeper understanding of the man behind the horror and the myth. Ice T and Snoop Dogg or Lion or whatever he calls him self these days...gave insight into the kind of clownery the pimp life can lead too and the true cost of the life style if you don't get some understanding. Stop look and listen...that all Ice seemed to be saying......not do as i do,1401062400,,1041,4.343589743589743

5732530,5,B00CPKZKX0,"This is a masterfully crafted documentary about a man who most would find utterly repulsive and yet you'll find yourself drawn to his candor and vulnerability. We all love to root for the underdog and Iceberg Slim makes Rocky Balboa seem like a trust fund baby with a sweater tied across his shoulders! I laughed, cried, and reflected on my own missteps during this cinematic rollercoaster! Truly a must see!",1399420800,,408,4.8428571428571425

5732534,5,B00CPKZKX0,"I actually didn't know what to expect prior to watching this documentary.  I have to say that it really held my attention and the commentary by many who are featured in the film was insightful.  I also liked how the history of the US was woven into the film and gave one a sense of what was happening overall in the US that affected the decisions made by Mr Beck.  I know some people will always look at this line of work with disgust and will abhor the members who use violence as a form of control, but there are those who will look at this and rationalize the behavior described by Mr Beck and that's more concerning than the things he describes.  All-in-all, this is very well done and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of how Mr Beck became ""Iceberg Slim"".",1399075200,,799,4.306666666666667
5732535,4,B00CPKZKX0,"The documentary was well done and it certainly painted a vivid picture of Mr. Beck's life.

5732536,5,B00CPKZKX0,"I have been aware of the name Iceberg Slim for a long time. During my high school years I read books written by him as well as Donald Goines. These books allowed me to sub merge myself into the seedy, gritty and cruel world of the underbelly side of life within the urban ghetto. The realism of the characters and the tales of drug abuse, murder and the street hustle was fascinating. Myself being a resident of the so called hood was very aware that this world was all to real and the fiction tales based on non fiction made the stories even more intriguing. In this autobiographical documentary we are allowed to peer into the thought process of one the real OG's of the mack game. His insight and wisdom paints a picture of a very intelligent man who made some poor decisions but through the power of will and determination altered the course of his life and found his true calling as a dynamic storyteller who can articulate and describe a side of life many are not privy too. The wisdom he imparts about the human spirit rings loud and resonate long after the film is over. Kudos to Ice T for bringing this man story to the world.",1398729600,,1135,4.38388625592417

5732543,5,B00CPKZKX0,It was interesting to see the story of an underground Ernest Hemingway who exuded his life through his writing. This man graduated from high school at 15 years of age with 98 average. Within him lied genius that remained dormant while living a street life. On the flip side it was this life that granted him fodder for very compelling literary works. I loved this. Consequently I am now reading his books.,1388793600,3,405,4.638888888888889

5732547,5,B00CPKZKX0,Really shared a VERY interesting history that happened in my city (Chicago) a life I will never know (pimping). But like the movie Goodfellas this is a REAL story of the good bad and the ugly. He is not PROMOTING or GLAMORIZING pimping. It is just the OPPOSITE as he (Iceberg Slim) is talking against young men getting in the game. And to see him talk about it LIVE in person over the span of 50 years + and understand the history is AMAZING.,1381190400,3,442,4.273809523809524

THEY SHOULD HAVE PUT OTHER REAL PIMPS THOUGHTS AND OPIONIONS INSTEAD OF SNOOP DOGGS AND ICE-T'S BUT ITS STILL VERY INTERESTING TO SAY THE LEAST. ITS GOOD THAT A MOVIE WAS DONE TO LEARN ABOUT THIS MANS THOUGHTS AND ROAD TO REDEMPTION. TO FIND A MORE PEACEFUL &DECENT LIFE.
THIS MOVIE IS NOT TO PRAISE THIS MANS LIFE AS PIMP, BUT RATHER TO LEARN AND UNDERSTAND HIS EARLY LIFESTYLE AND CHANGE ""PRAISE HIM FOR DROPPING HIS LIFESTYLE AND TRYING TO DO RIGHT BY LEAD"".

5732552,4,B00CPKZKX0,Very interesting but could have been better with more personal interviews of Robert beck and less cartoon illustrations! The ending could have had a were are they now!,1378771200,,167,5.0
5732553,2,B00CPKZKX0,I thought that Ice-T would have enough street credibility to not put his name behind anything as ridiculous as this sorry documentary this bad boy is for 14-year-old white boys way out in the suburbs who never even seen a bitch up close American pimp this is not Rosebud or Kenny red are the real deal and don't forget San Francisco's slim you can skip this one on lease that's what I'm recommending leave this one for the white kids and their daddies,1377734400,,451,4.445783132530121
5732554,3,B00CPKZKX0,"I have read the book by Iceberg Slim, ""Pimp"", and this was more like a book review to me. Hearing stories from his family and friends made the movie a little more enjoyable.",1377475200,,173,4.2727272727272725
5732555,5,B00CPKZKX0,"Often, dangerous art will not trickle into the mainstream on it's first generation.  ""Iceberg Slim: Portrait of a Pimp"" reaches deep into a sparsely-recorded period of influential, recent American history to reveal the source of many of today's most celebrated and influential artists.
Broken homes, crimes, addictions and severe abuse are all colors on the palette that director Jorge Hinojosa uses to lay the foundation for the cause/effect story that created a man who's life deserves a serious exploration, and in this film, he gets it.  With stills, interviews and animations Hinojosa weaves his story.  Not another saccharine ""rags-to-riches"" story to perpetuate the pimpocracy that we are living in today, but a sober and objective study of human nature at its urban extremes of exploitation and survival.
Its made clear that opportunities for black men in Chicago were few when Iceberg Slim was pimping. Then, once a successful writer making a legitimate living inside the system, he and his family was virtually starved back into crime by the enriched publishers who claimed they ""did well by doing good"". Will the real pimps please stand up?
This film is required viewing of anyone who appreciates rap music, street art, straight-talking comedy, and a deep look at the chaotic and daring efforts of divided cultures to live outside the inapplicable rulebooks of the day.  As the music swells at the end for what ultimately feels like a love letter to a pimp, you realize the effects that Iceberg Slim's unchained novels had on so many artists.  How they resonated with the books and wanted to re-create that intensity in their performances.  Anything less would be limp.
This film reveals the disturbing source of that art, and the cracks and desires in human nature that force it to center stage.",1376524800,4,1807,5.0673400673400675
5732556,5,B00CPKZKX0,"This movie was very informative on his life, I think the book was more descriptive in some areas. The feedback from all the people involved around and in his life was very interesting. Great movie!!! Actually, way better than I thought it would be.",1376438400,,248,4.659090909090909
5732557,4,B00CPKZKX0,This video was but entertaining and insightful. I nice companion piece for those who enjoy Iceberg's work. Balanced and helps put things into a true perspective. No glamorization here.,1376265600,,184,5.379310344827586
5732558,5,B00CPKZKX0,"There are works that open one's eyes to seeing America in a new light, to seeing the nation in greater richness, history and experiencing unique lives that indirectly enrich ours.  Malcom X's autobiography was one such work.  John Steinbeck writings were others.  This film belongs in that collection.  The life of Iceberg Slim is revelatory, fascinating, and a true drama.  From a boy born in shambles, to succeeding as a charismatic pimp and understanding his world, to redemption, family, love and rebirth as an influential artist, this is a true-to-life Hero's Journey.  Watching this film is one of those experiences of sitting in wonder, having not known that such people and world exist and being totally enthralled experiencing it vicariously.  In the end, the film will change your perspective.

And the music in this film... wow!  Amazing.

Simply put: documentary filmmaking at its best.",1375315200,3,898,5.173611111111111
5732559,3,B00CPKZKX0,Filtered representations of a life after experiencing such a way of life for the gangster-minded during the depression and it's relevant impact of those today seeking to copy the criminal mindset of exploiting and manipulating females.,1374969600,2,235,5.555555555555555
5732560,5,B00CPKZKX0,"This documentary is an eye opener on an unknown world to most of us. From his early childhood through the turmoils of his life we have a vivid portrait of the man who became an influential writer. In-depth interviews with now famous rap stars as well as invaluable information from Slim's own family, especially his now deceased wife and daughters, give an even more intimate picture of this complex writer and his life.  His experiences cover most of the social spectrum and we are able to view him with all his bumps and accolades. Photo images and clips from the past to the present help to give us a rounded picture of the way street life was while he was living it. Very enlightening, engrossing film.",1374883200,14,706,4.603174603174603
5732561,5,B00CPKZKX0,"This doc was mesmerizing! Thank goodness it wasn't a pimp and ho show but something so much deeper. The story is really well told, the visuals were really stylized and really well done and the music was amazing.",1374796800,,211,4.578947368421052
8584538,5,B00CPKZKX0,"My advice: pair this film with the book ""Pimp"". I'm not sure if one would get as much out of this film without having read at least one of Iceberg Slim's books. ""Pimp"" is constantly referenced but the true realness and weight of the book isn't fully represented here. However, it was fascinating to see Iceberg Slim's family and listen to the stories and impressions that he had on others.",1530921600,,389,4.571428571428571
8584539,5,B00CPKZKX0,"It sheds light on the psychological, cultural and historical reasons the author endured the lifestyle he shares about. Although his story is fascinating, he doesn't glamorize it but wants others to understand it and strive for better.  As a result of watching this, I now understand the stories behind some of the rap song lyrics I have so often detested. Yes, I too I can't wait to get a copy of his book (which I suppose is available on Amazon).",1530835200,,447,4.5875
8584540,1,B00CPKZKX0,The stream is terrible. It's really choppy and unwatchable. I tried watching other videos and they work fine but this video won't play right at all.,1530489600,,148,4.730769230769231
8584541,5,B00CPKZKX0,I am now going to buy his collection of books. I am 23 and never heard of Ice Berg Slim and his influence but I am intrigued. This movie is most definitely worth the watch!,1529884800,,172,3.942857142857143
8584542,4,B00CPKZKX0,"I read the Iceberg Slim paperback and I found it  enlightening to a young man growing up away from ""the Life"" . I never wanted to be a member of the ""street Life"" but, at that time thought I needed a ""ten-foot-pole"" knowledge of some of the things I had seen and heard. As well as what to look out for, in the 'Streets' , where I was NOT allowed to go!  I am glad 'Slim' spoke against ""the GAME"" because what I found out made me very weary of what there was to find ""out-there"". After all, I found I really did not need to know what I found out! This expose' underscored exactly what I had gleaned from reading, seeing and the little I personally experienced in Chicago's vast areas of sectionalism and segregation.",1528934400,,715,4.25
8584543,3,B00CPKZKX0,"This documentary would've been better had they used an audio mixing technician who knew what they were doing. The music was blaring over top of the interviews in many places, making it nearly impossible to hear what people were saying. This seriously needs a re-working.",1528156800,,270,5.022222222222222

There were some photos from a book by two psychologists that studied the life in San Francisco. I was part of that life. Not exactly good times, but abundant memories. Thanks Ice-T for bringing this to life.",1526083200,,310,4.456140350877193
