I live in Mexico City and on an average we pay almost double for just about any dvd or cd  that comes from the U.S. I paid the equivelant od 37.00 U.S. dollars for this dvd and many others that make up my collection and of course keep in mind at about 1/3 the salary that most people make in the U.S.

Our music stores have great variety and are very well stocked but you cant wait around when you see something you really like or you will lose out on it. And it could be months before you see it again, if at all.

So the next time you think a good dvd is overpriced, just remember there are poeple in third world countries willing to pay almost twice that price to have it. Mail order doesnt help much either because it can sit in customs for a couple of weeks and then they stick a hefty tax on it when you go to pick it up or wait even longer to have it delivered.

Black Metal & Death Metal rule .....When will the likes of King Diamond....Venom.....Sodom......Bathory...the real pioneers of this music have a dvd we can add to our collection (amen) !!!",1095984000,2,1286,4.128
8323964,2,B0001933AE,"Mericless(...)if you are a fan of ol'skool Death Thrash, BUY THIS DVD! Merciless, formed during the summer of 1986, are one of the first underground Death/Thrash Metal bands in Sweden, inspired by the early works of godz: Kreator, Sodom, Destruction and Bathory! although the band took a break in 1994 due to a bad contract with a horrible record label, they have risen from the ashes of a once thriving scene, to unleash this killer live set from 2003! the sound quality is mint and captures the brutal heavy grinding that only Merciless can wield! you won't find any Gothenburg junk here! you also get a second DVD of some promotional videos and various antics. all in all a killer collection... *BUT* ...the company that released this DVD dropped the ball! the content on both DVDs could have fit onto ONE SINGLE-LAYER DVD! the total size of both discs = 4.3GB, which would fit on 1 DVD very easily. but they waste the DVD format and put out this 2 DVD set, which also jacks up the price. not a very good idea. this is the ONLY REASON that i gave this DVD a rating of stars.
