8325155,4,B000HEZF5E,"This is a fascinating film, a propaganda piece that focuses on presenting Deng Xiaoping as a kindly fatherly figure to the Chinese nation and as a genius who led the way in modernizing the Chinese economy and in bringing his country back to the forefront of global politics. Everything about the film down to the English language narration is clearly heavily influenced by the political agenda of the filmmakers. For casual viewers this documentary is enjoyable because of the excellent footage of important moments in Chinese history presented. I use this video in class to show my students how Deng's achievements have traditionally been presented in China, though I look to stimulate some conversation afterwards regarding the issue of bias in the presentation.",1339977600,,764,5.219512195121951
