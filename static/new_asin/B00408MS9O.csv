4240302,3,B00408MS9O,"I bought Haydn's Il Mondo della Luna trusting the four reviewers' write-ups, especially the excellent review by ""Giordano Bruno"" [who was burned for his writings at the stake in Rome in 1600, but his writings did not yet include his opera reviews].
I was also interested in the two available Haydn opera DVD-s. With numerous operas to his credit it is strange that only two of those are marketed. Haydn wrote this ""dramma giocosa"" [jocular drama] only two years before Mozart's jocular drama, La Finta Gardiniera was produced, but Haydn's use of a Goldoni-libretto should have given him a chance for a better product. Unfortunately, neither of the two are what one should call ""masterpiece"".
The music of Haydn's opera is enjoyable, but there is not enough of it to carry the opera's second act. If that is due to an extensive amount of slapstick activity by the staging or if that is a part of Goldoni's libretto, I don't know. Nevertheless, the second act quickly becomes quite boring, and one has the feeling that less of it would have offered a lot more entertainment.
The first, and the quite brief third act are reasonably well staged and do not evoke yawning by the audience.
""Il Nolano"" [Bruno's nickname] gave a good description of the singers, who are unquestionably of professional quality, and of course Mr. Harnoncourt's conductorship is good even at the golden age of 80.\
Still I, and my opera-loving wife, agreed on no more than a three-star rating: first, it is by far not a masterpiece by Haydn, second, it is so heavy handedly staged, that in places it became a bore.",1294963200,10,1586,4.7709090909090905
4240303,5,B00408MS9O,"While I'm a huge fan of Haydn - every one of the 106 symphonies has something wonderful in it, and the masses and oratorios are all great, not to mention the scores of chamber music - the operas have up till now struck me as curiously uninvolving. So I took a chance at watching one staged. This is a gem. The best argument for regie opera that I have seen. It was staged in 2009 at the Theater an der Wien in a delightfully wacky and hypermodern setting that highlights exceptionally well the comedy and the pathos of the story and the relationships of the characters. The mostly young cast of singers, all unknown to me except Vivica Genaux, are very fine and Nicholas Harnoncourt in the pit makes the most of all of the style, wit and feeling in this score. Highly recommended!",1293753600,8,780,4.423611111111111
4240304,5,B00408MS9O,"Any opera incorporates two 'works' - a drama of words and a drama of music. Most of us 'opera fans' are accustomed to expect brilliance from the music and mediocrity from the libretto... come on! you know it's so ... despite the fundamental premise of opera, that it should achieve a 'totality' of artistic meaning. But because we assign primacy to the music, we headline the composer's name, we catalogue our opera experiences by composer, we often ignore the identity of the librettist, and we find it possible to relish operas and opera productions on the basis of fine musical values even though the libretto or the stagecraft may be dismal. In fact, it's rare to find an opera libretto that could possibly 'hold the stage' without its music.

That's not so with ""Il Mondo della Luna"". The libretto is an uproarious 'commedia dell'arte' by Carlo Goldoni (1707-1793), the most popular and successful playwright of the 18th C, whose theater pieces include some of the most beloved works of Italian literature. Goldoni's librettos were set by every major composer of his era and beyond. The picaresque heroes of his comedies were the prototypes of Mozart's and Rossini's scampish Figaros. ""Il Mondo della Luna"" is as funny a play as Moliere's 'Scapin', and in the same tradition. It could easily be adapted to the modern stage, without music, or made the basis of a knee-slapping film. This libretto was first set to music by Baldassare Galuppi and produced in Venice in 1750. Eventually it was set as an opera buffa by four other composers, including ...

... Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809), who chose it to be performed at the wedding of the younger son of his patron, Prince Esterhazy, in 1777. Haydn wrote at least 20 operas, few of which have been staged or recorded in modern times. It's been the accepted ""wisdom"" that, whatever their musical value, they lacked stage-worthiness and dramatic cohesion. Like most accepted wisdom, that's nonsense, and the gradual revival of operas by Handel and other pre-Mozartian composers can be expected eventually to lead to a revival of Haydn's operas as well. (At least, so I hope!) There are now two Haydn operas available on DVD, this ""Luna"" and also ""Orlando Paladino"", which I've reviewed previously. Haydn's music for opera is another important facet of his genius; in fact, the orchestral writing for his operas and his masses fueled the development of his mature symphonies.

Both recent stagings of Haydn operas, available on DVD, are artistically bifurcated. The music is performed on 'period' instruments and the singing is rigorously ""historically informed"" in vocal technique. The dramaturgy -- sets, costumes, theatrical concepts -- however, are unapologetically 'modern', not based whatsoever on the stagecraft of the court theater of the Esterhazys. If anyone had a gripe about this production of ""Luna"", it wouldn't be Haydn. It would be Carlo Goldoni. But I swear with all my integrity and credibility that Goldoni would have loved this madcap modernization of his themes. It may have light projections and onstage hot tubs, but it's still 'commedia dell'arte' in spirit. The principal scamp -- the con-artist Ecclitico, sung by tenor Bernard Richter -- would be recognizable in any costume by audiences of any culture. If the actor Jim Carey had lived in 18th C Venice, he would have been triumphant in such a role in Goldoni's theater. As it happens, Bernard Richter looks remarkably like Jim Carey; if Richter ever gives up singing, he can be assured of a career in Hollywood comedies. He's a born scamp with a marvelous voice. The vocal performances of the two sisters are equally marvelous -- gorgeous voices, polished technique -- but the most outstanding unity of acting and singing is accomplished by baritone Dietrich Henschel in the role of Buonafede. Most of Haydn's music in ""Luna"" is high-kicking froth and low-brow sound effects, but there are gorgeous moments, particularly the duets sung by the two sisters in the first act and by Ecclitico and Clarice at the opening of the third act. The latter is a love duet as poignant as any of Mozart's. Curiously, one of the arias sung by Ernesto later became the basis of the Benedictus of Haydn's powerful ""Mariazeller"" Mass.

""Well, folks, ol' Papa Haydn didn't write no second-rate music.""

Ecclitico, as I said, is a con-man. His scam involves a preposterous gimmick telescope, with which he shows gullible people images of the ""life on the Moon"", with the help of several henchmen. But Ecclitico is in love with Clarice, sung by Christina Landshamer, the daughter of the rich but 'moonish' Buonafede, Buonafede has a second daughter Flaminia, sung by Anja Bahrmann, who is loved by the boyish Ernesto, sung by Vivica Genoux. Buonafede also has a serving girl -- Lisetta, sung by Maite Beaumont -- whose 'affections' he pursues, but Lisetta is secretly in love with another servant, Cecco, sung by Markus Schfer. The three young man conspire to gull Buonafede into believing that he is transported to the realm of the Emperor of the Moon (Cecco in disguise), where he bewilderedly consents to the marriage of his daughters and his maid to their respective lovers. It's loony-toony throughout, both in words and in music, and puns on the double meaning of the word ""lunatic' abound. The cast of singers are all excellent comedians, who rescue their extended ""recitativo"" passages from any monotony with antic delivery worthy of the Marx Brothers.

""Il Mondo della Luna"" has been called the first science-fiction opera. There's more fiction than science in it, even for 1777, but the concept that 'people' could be living on the Moon and perhaps on other planets was current in Goldoni's times and just as controversial as today, for the same theological reasons. My namesake -- Giordano Bruno da Nola -- could testify eloquently about the heat of that controversy. As far as I know, no other 'science fiction operas' were composed until the 20th Century, with works by Leos Janacek, Gian carlo Menotti, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Gavin Bryars, Lorin Maazel, Philip Glass, Meredith Monk, Poul Rouders, and Tod Machover. Hey, anyone impresario out there interested in mounting a Sci-Fi Opera Festival?",1289260800,4,6220,5.028128031037827
4240305,5,B00408MS9O,"This 2009 production of Haydn's Il Mondo della Luna for the Theater an der Wien, conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt for his 80th birthday celebrations, is a treat for anyone interested in seeing rarely performed opera of quality and distinction, and seeing this particular 'dramma giocoso' done playfully and intelligently with respect and understanding for the material.

It's understandable that some would rather see a faithful period production of the 1777 opera, but there is nothing in Il Mondo della Luna that is period specific or anachronistic in a modern setting.  While the one notable event is the fact that man has in the meantime now walked on the moon, its mysteries remain.  Those mysteries are delightfully exploited by Ecclitico and his friend Ernesto, the two of them wishing to marry the daughters of Buonafede, while Ecclitico's servant has designs on his maid, the rather formidable Lisetta.  They plan an elaborate scheme to trick the old man into believing that they have transported him to the moon in order to show him the foolishness of his ways and turn his outdated ideas about women against him.

The world on the moon, it transpires, is the mystery of the workings of women, whom the opera playfully labels ""lunatics"", their behaviour strange, mercurial (to mix planetary metaphors), inconstant and inconsistent.  It's a subject evidently that is as contemporary now as it was then, or even when Mozart tackled the subject somewhat later in a similarly humorous manner in Cos Fan Tutte (or even perhaps The Magic Flute, to which Il Mondo della Luna feels like a closer relative).

Appropriately, the drama and singing are low key, with no grand exhibitions of vocal virtuosity, the performances rather delicate, modest, playful and charming, each of the singers however all getting their moments in the spotlight in an opera that is principally made up of a running series of arias with short recitative in-between (although there is one beautiful duet towards the end, 'un certo ruscelletto').  The staging is modern and just a bit too glittery, but it uses technology well without ever contradicting the libretto or the intentions of the drama.  The craft of the staging is impressive, a revolving stage, imaginative props and some minor acrobatics keeping the action fluid and always interesting.

The technical aspects of the Blu-ray are faultless - the 16:9 image clear and sharp in a 1080i transfer, the sound mix available in LPCM stereo and DTS HD Master-Audio 5.1 giving a good stage to both the orchestration and the singing.  A 25 minute Making Of featurette is included and is of particular interest for a good interview with Nikolaus Harnoncourt.",1288137600,8,2689,5.074829931972789
4240306,5,B00408MS9O,"I went to see this production in Theater an der Wien in December 2009. My wife had graciously alowed met to go as it was my birthday and so I flew from Amsterdam to Vienna, especially to see this production. I have been following Mr. Harnoncourts productions where I can for a number of years and wanted to see this one very much because you rarely are able to see a good production of a Haydn opera at all.

Theater ander Wien has for some years now been bringing opera productions again after a long time of only musicals and they have been able to do what the salzburg festival has not: secure Mr. Harnoncourts collaboration to conduct an opera every year. He has done Orlando Paladino (Haydn), The Rake`s progress (stravinsky) and will be doing a Rodelinda (handel) in 2010. Il mondo della luna is his second collaboration with Tobias Moretti, a well knwon German actor who has been increasingly active in the field of opera staging for some years. The first production they did together was Mozart`s La Finta Giadiniera at the Zurich opera. Yes, I saw that, as well.. And there is a dvd available of this production.

I really enjoyed the staging. It brings out the ridiculous and somewhat incredible story of the idiot Buonafede really well. Hilarious at points, but very severe at others. You are made to feel as if it could almost have been you..
Theater an der Wien has a large trickbag available, everything revolves, flies, turns, falls, rises etc. Mr. Moretti makes good use of this, there is always something to see and the jokes often turns to extreme human emotion in a second. This is Haydn at his best. A complete whirlpool of emotions that has you laughing and crying at the same time. (literally..)
Of course, the musical subtext has a lot to do with this. Concentus Musicus seemed even better, sharper than ever (if at all possible) and the sounds that came out of the pit were at times hardly recognisable as any kind of instrument.

The singing, too, was excellent and the singers were evidently well able to live their parts. As it were, they were not singing and/or acting it, they were IT.
Most of the very young cast I did not know. Of course, Dietrich Henschel is known to me and I had heard of Bernhard Richter, the others I did not know. Maite Beaumont made o profound impression on me, as did Vivica Genaux. Christina Landshamer and Anja Nina Bahrmann were stretched to the maximum of their abilities, but the dramatic expression was such that I easily forgave and forgot the few mistakes that they made.

The real star in the end is Mr. Harnoncourt, though. How this venerable old and wise man is able to touch everything he does with golddust is something that I have given up trying to understand several years ago. The story comes alive under his hands, tension is never released and most of all the human side of the characters is brought out to such a degree that the whole thing holds a mirror in front of you and that can be painfull at times..
I do not think that there is any production available that brings out the stunning genius of Haydn as a composer and as an opera composer to such a degree as this production does. Often underestimated, Mr. Haydn knows very well what goes on inside of us and how to address it. Perhaps he, in the end, is the true star of this production.

I would like to add a few comments after having viewed the DVD:

The staging is excellent. As a great compliment to Mr. Moretti, I have very rarely seen a staging that supports the music and the handling so well as this one does. Jokes are extremely funny and witty, made at just the right times and never preventing the singers from doing an excellent job. On the contrary, the singers are supported in bringing accross the idea to a great extent by the ideas of the staging. Also, the staging makes long lines and presents the story as a whole. Very well done.

The sounds that Mr. Harnoncourt produces from the orchestra are stunning. Much more than beautifull music, a life story with a large double bottom is presented here and the musical subtexts are extremely well done. This means that the joke or the drama is not allways evident in the text or the staging but comes from the musical subtext and is often taken further by the staging. This seems to be a production that is thought out to the smallest parts. It does not bring, however, a feeling of forcedness, but comes out very natural. As a whole, the production therefore provides one with a very entertaing evening filled with laughs on one hand, and on the other hand leaves one stunned and drained at the end. As Mr. Harnoncourt so justly said, when you scratch the surface of Haydn you find absolute madness just underneath.

The cast of singers really is excellent. Where do they find these people, that give their hearts and souls to such a production? As mentioned before, the majority I did not know but they are of a very high quality. I would especially like to mention Markus Shaefer her as I had not mentioned him before. Well sung and very well acted. Bravo!

When will we finally realise that the Haydn that everyone values, the Haydn of ""creation"" and ""seasons"" is the other side of the coin, that his operas are equally masterfull, are proof of the absolute genius of this composer. Mr. Harnoncourt and Mr. Moretti and their cast have set a standard here. Please, let others follow where they have led.",1286409600,39,5404,4.540041067761807
8412239,5,B00408MS9O,"My favorite Haydn opera so far. The music is very fine; lively and expressive, especially memorable at the moment Buonafede imagines he is traveling to the moon. The Vienna production is deft and clever, involving all sorts of modern items (like a computer monitor substituting for the telescope) and acrobatics from the singers. I personally would have preferred an effort to replicate a production of Haydn's time, but on the other hand this opera is so silly it is not easy to desecrate. (Concerning the contemporary phenomenon of music-hating Euroschlock opera productions, you may regard me as a canary-in-a-mine, and I don't think this is one of those at all; it treats Haydn's piece with considerable affection.)

The performers are generally quite good and two are really outstanding. Tenor Bernard Richter is a sweet-voiced, expressive, and exceedingly charming Ecclitico. Baritone Dietrich Henschel as the duped old man Buonafede submits to endless indignities on stage, but he plays a fool who nonetheless has a certain forcefulness and gravitas. His singing is excellent.

The period-instruments players conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt are quite virtuosic. Harnoncourt fusses with the tempos too much, but it's not all that irritating.

Alas the recording was made live with a quite haphazard recording arrangement, and the sound quality is mediocre at best. The singers come across with different volume levels depending on where they are on the stage. I'm looking for a good CD recording just to get a better impression of the music.

So, a few minuses to go with the pluses. But overall, I found this recording delightful and recommend it very highly.",1414022400,2,1668,5.235955056179775
8412240,5,B00408MS9O,"I never warm to modern productions, and even less could I imagine how an 18th century composition of Haydn be staged in any meaningful way in the 21st century.  It would require a real genius to realise this project if it is to be successful.  And it DID here!
I watched this on the website first, then rushed to obtain a copy for my 'collection' of great operatic performances.
Absolutely amazing is my only reaction to this almost unbelievable 'product'.  It is like watching a modern satirical drama, but sung and not spoken, and with fantastic music to boot.  The singers here rival the best Shakespearean actors/actresses in their performances.  I particularly find the two male leads unbearably piercing in their portrayals.
Dietrich Henschel and Bernard Richter not just 'sung' their roles, nor 'acted' their roles - they 'lived' their roles.  It is wonderful to have a live video recording of their superlative performances, for if I watch it in the theatre, chances are that I would only be able to catch 60% of their ultra-fine and subtle facial expressions, and only receiving 40% of their body languages and sung lines.  Perhaps they should both receive an Oscar Award for such terrific acting, really.
Good old Harnoncourt has by now after more than half a century become an icon of European opera.  I particularly like his 'King Arthur' in Salzburg, though I do not understand German.  Here, in Vienna, he is like a lighthouse in the pit, enlivening the entire programme, reacting with the performers on stage (he mimed the echoes 'on the moon' at the pit).
Needless to say, Haroncourt's great band plays great music, and so do the singers, even if the two girls are a bit green, admittedly. I am scared with Maite Beaumont's 'treatment' of the rabbit, though, but I quickly understand that my reaction is purely Asian, not being used to eating rabbits at home!
Vivica Genaux has become a big name in opera since this performance, and I must say that her singing has improved with time. So does Bernard Richter, now a first-rate lyrical tenor even if relatively unknown at the time of this production.
This is a piece of high art that no music lover could afford to miss.",1407974400,,2185,4.774535809018568

8412242,5,B00408MS9O,"This performance, recorded in 2009, was in effect a birthday celebration for Harnoncourt and took place the day before his 80th birthday. Haydn has written a very amusing opera here and fully exposes the lunacy of men who have an oversized ego coupled with a desire to control their women. The entire plot addresses this and this modern production and setting is both truly lunatic and blessed with a cast of singers/actors who completely revel in the humour of the opera as envisioned here. Needless to say the plot is resolved with the correct partners being successfully joined and the lunatic father exposed for what he is.

The story is complete nonsense of course so the updated production, also nonsense, seems appropriate. There is an interesting bonus feature in which both Harnoncourt and the producer, Tobias Moretti, fully explain their views about Haydn and this opera in particular. Essentially they, rightly it seems to me, see Haydn as a composer of extremes who fully indulged this side of his character in this composition. The updating of the opera to a world of computers would initially seem to be doubtful. How would the main character be duped into believing himself to being on the moon at a time when this had already been achieved for real? In the event it really does not matter as the opera concerns itself with universal truths - and as Harnoncourt says, people are still people regardless of period. I would add that sharp observation is still as valid today as ever it was.

The cast is young, very talented as regards singing and acting skills and athletic enough to deliver all of this with energy, enthusiasm and abandon. Bernard Richter as the bogus astronomer and Dietrich Henschel as the duped father are both outstanding in these regards. The two daughters and maidservant performed by Christina Landshamer, Anja Gahrmann and Maite Beaumont, are pleasingly attractive enough to merit the appropriate likely attention from their respective admirers and Vivica Genaux make a convincing job in her trouser role as Ernesto. Marcus Schafer is also convincing in his unlikely role as the Moon Emperor.

The camera work fully involves the viewer and the imaging is very crisp. The sound is presented in both DTS 5.0 and stereo and fully shows the skills of the Concentus Musicus Wien off to good advantage as well as the singers.

This is a most enjoyable, if somewhat unusual, production and can be fully recommended to anyone prepared to be flexible and amenable to a good modern production. On that basis it would be hard to imagine purchasers failing to derive considerable pleasure from this disc.

The silly and over-the-top production quickly becomes annoying, and after the first thirty minutes, one seriously starts to wonder whether there is actually any real music in this piece... it seems to be an endless chain of recitativos.

I know that musical taste is just that and quite personal, but this was one of the most boring performances I've ever watched (in spite of the slapsticks antics).  First of all, the music is hardly first rate.  Haydn wrote magnificent masses, but as an opera composer (in my opinion), he was not at the top of his field.  This production tries hard to overcome this second-rate music and in doing so, makes the music even more trivial.

I've watched it once and now it will stay on my shelf until I decide to bring it to a second hand store and get some money for it.

8412247,4,B00408MS9O,"I have given the title for this overview (rather than a review) with the greatest respect for the oft under-rated Haydn. It is like riding a superbly souped-up version (I am referring to the time-update) of the highly respected Model T cars of Ford.
In this, you can 'feel' the origins of many operas of Mozart, Rossini and even Donizetti to a very great extent... which of course, was Haydn's contribution to the evolution of Music of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. So adequately sung and beautifully played by the orchestra. I doubt whether Harnoncourt had too much to do really...

I would have deemed it (Euro)Trash like one of the fellow reviewers seems to have referred it as, watching a few 'rushes' of the opera on presumably the Youtube or such sites. Normally, I would have trashed this rendition too, as I am so against the normal Eurotrashy renditions of many operas.
However, in this one, the updating works to the extent that it makes it a 'point to ponder' insofar as the thematic content of the opera is concerned. Although yes, men have walked on the moon and moon-people and such stuff may be scoffed at today, just imagine, if one were to substitute the moon for just another dimension a la the string and the M theories, such allegories could be the stuff of sci-fi even today, however stupid the plot may seem.
I felt a little bored to start with, with the saccharine sweet music, but as the opera progressed, I realized that this is a calculated risk that I took with this production, that has really paid off.

I may not watch it over and over again, but all the same, would love to return to it once in a while, with an anticipation of being able to get a 'feel-good' feeling after all the brouhaha of the opera.

To those who care about the historicity and origins of music, especially Opera that we universally love, it is a production to behold. To others who know most operas of Mozart, Rossini and their ilk, and are eagerly anticipating one more work to internalize, the music is nothing new other than the original of originals of the style. To such people, I would advise..... avoid.

8412248,4,B00408MS9O,"Of all of Haydn's operas ""Il Mondo della Luna"" (""The World of the Moon"") and ""l'Anima del Filosofo"" (""The Soul of Philosophy"" also known as ""Orfeo ed Euridice"") seem to be the most frequently revived. ""Il Mondo della Luna"" is not, in my opinion, Haydn's greatest opera (I'll give my own opinions on these later), but it is certainly wonderfully charming, with a very durable, whimsical, and occasionally truly witty libretto by the dramatist Carlo Goldoni, whose plays, with their wooden two-dimensional characters, are all but forgotten now. ""Il Mondo della Luna"" was certainly popular, having been set not only by Haydn but also by Galuppi and Paisiello (among others). And there is good reason for this - it's funny, whimsical, has a hint of fantasy, and plays well.
  The only problem with this wonderful performance was in the director's decision to update it to the 20th century. Goldoni's libretto reeks of the 18th century (in which it was written). Goldoni pokes fun at the advances in science (and the relatively new science of astronomy) as well as the wild claims which were being made at the time by hack astrologers with their ""miraculous"" telescopes. It would be hard for anyone today in our post-modern world to believe that the moon was inhabited with people, kings and queens, houses and cities - yet in the 18th century this was still a somewhat believable, if not widely respected, notion. What might have seemed like science fiction in the 18th century is pure fantasy to us today - so to try to encumber this text with the modern trappings of closed circuit television, telescope monitors, etc. is clumsy and completely out of keeping with the spirit of the text.
  The opera's central character, named ""Buonafede"" (Italian for ""good faith"") is one of the most credulous in all Italian opera, but his credulousness in a modern setting goes almost beyond belief. It is fun and comical to see an 18th century character believe that the moon is inhabited, believe that by taking a sleeping drought mixed with opium that he is literally ""flying"" to the moon's surface - but this just doesn't work when it's set in a modern, realistic frame.
  This is somewhat made up for by the somewhat fantastic 2nd act, which has a set more in keeping with Goldoni's ideas. Buonafede, who, I think, Goldoni meant us to laugh at, really comes across as a rather pathetic character in his ridiculous Barbara Eden ""I Dream of Jeannie"" get-up, and his attempt to stop the turntable from spinning at the end of the second act, to remain in this fantastical world of the moon (including his incredible acrobatics and the additional line not found in the text that he still wishes to live his life as a ""lunatic"") make his rapid conversion in the opera's third act a little more believable.
  Haydn's music is, of course, at all times charming, and sometimes even really exceptional. However, this was an old libretto even by Haydn's time,and even Mozart would have been hard pressed to flesh out the stereotypical characters(Buonafede's daughters are interchangeable, and only the serving maid Lisetta shows some liveliness - but, she, too, is a stock figure - in a long line which would also include Mozart's Despina). Yet, I found myself really thoroughly satisfied after the performance, and had the desire to dig out my old Dorati recording to hear the music all over again. The performances in this production are first rate all the way, with special gold stars definitely going to Dietrich Henschel (who makes Buonafede as sympathetic as one could possibly manage to do) and the magnificent Vivica Genaux.
  Those who go into this expecting revelation will be disappointed. As previously stated, Haydn was not given exceptional material here - but several arias stand out and the two action finales are beautifully constructed. But if one really wants to hear a Haydn operatic ""masterpiece"" then I would heartily recommend ""Orlando Paladino"" (which, at times, comes close to Mozart's ""Don Giovanni"") or the practically perfect ""l'Isola Disabitata"" - also based on a warhorse of a libretto (Metastasio's text was set by countless composers) yet this libretto (that of ""l'Isola"") is one of the simplest and most beautiful ever written, and Haydn's setting of it amazingly forward looking.
  Not that ""Il Mondo de la Luna"" is any bad shakes. Those not familiar with any of Haydn's operas should give it a try. Yet, it's a shame that a plot which simply demands an 18th century setting has been muddled and made hopelessly confusing by resetting it in a time period which is completely at odds with its own peculiar conceits and conventions.",1300147200,15,4642,4.906887755102041
