4529867,3,B0052EE3S4,"THE PROS:Looks and sounds great! And the performance was really good. Although im sure the vocals had to be slightly tweaked.

THE CONS:As another reviewer stated,way to many camera switches,split screens and audience shots. I want to see the band not some shirtless guy with his mug so up close in the camera that you can see his boogers. Disappointed in the filming of this. From now on im going to wait and read reviews on concert dvds before i purchase to make sure their not filmed this way. There's too many concert dvds out there like this and i hope it stops! Its sorta nauseating.

THE BOTTOM LINE:Get it to fill the gap in your collection if you have to but i would suggest just sticking to Live at Donnington or Plug Me In. Or better yet,save your money and put it on the great ""Let there be rock"" box set thats coming out.",1305072000,26,834,4.374193548387097
4529868,5,B0052EE3S4,"This DVD is awsome. One of the better made ones ac/dc put out as far as way it was made in last few. I liked the bonus features as well like the guitar techs,etc. Much better quality sound and video over past dvd/s,must be advanced newer technology showing itself. Great dvd. If you like ac/dc ,you will like this dvd. And I actually waitied and gave an honest review-waited to review it until after it was actually out and available and I actually saw it,unlike some of the reviews above me who reviewed it before its release date. Amazon shouldn't allow things like that. How can it be reviewed before its for sale?",1305072000,3,617,4.469026548672566
4529869,5,B0052EE3S4,"Just Got It And Listened/Watched The DVD....Nice Mix Of AC/DC Songs And GREAT Audio Mixing ! The Behind The Scenes Was A Nice Treat, A Little More Of Angus In There Would Have Been Nice Tho...I Saw The show Here In California 2X With Floor Seats Next To The ""Catwalk"" Was Just Unreal, Angus And All The Lads In TOP Shape, Great Sound, Nice Effects ! Was Nice To See Them Out And About Signing Autographs Pretty Cool Of Them To Do That ! I'm A Little Mixed On The Split Screens During The Show ...Hummmm....Maybe I Just Need To Watch It A Few MORE Times xD....All In All A FANTASTIC DVD ! SUPER High Energy ( High Voltage !) Crowd And The Band Of Course Played Their A**s Off....Angus Could Power SF ..Just Plug A Cord Into Him lol ....No DTS But The Dolby Mix 5.1 Is Still Great !

4529870,5,B0052EE3S4,"I am looking forward to this big time but am a little disappointed they always leave out certain songs. I was kinda hopin' they'd finally do something with 'Big Gun' and 'Who Made Who'. These are awesome songs but they never use them in any live dvd packages. I know it's because they'd have to pay the film companies some royalties but who cares, a few dollars here and there shouldn't be a big deal, especially with how well their stuff sells. Next time guys. You gotta loosen the purse strings and use these songs cos they're awesome songs.",1304899200,2,543,4.494949494949495

THEY ALWAYS GIVE YOU OVER 2 HOURS OF THEIR BEST. NO OTHER BAND CAN SAY THAT. YES, SOME HAVE BEEN AROUND LONGER, BUT THEY DON'T DO IT LIKE AC/DC!! IT IS NOW 2017, AND I THINK THEY ARE DONE, BUT WHAT A RUN. ONE OF, IF NOT THE BEST EVER! THEY WILL BE MISSED. YOU BETTER GET ONE OF THESE, CAUSE THERE WILL BE NO MORE!!

4529878,5,B0052EE3S4,"I had dabbled in AC/DC live before, but never really got into it until discovering clips on Youtube and the occasional live album, like ""If You Want Blood,"" with Bon--which was great. River Plate was my first visual experience to the band live, and it did not disappoint. Of all the concerts I've seen since, this still rates as the best.

Great setlist, mixing in a few tracks from the then new ""Black Ice"" album--and, of course--all the familiar hits like Back in Black, Highway to Hell and maybe the best ""Thunderstruck"" of all-time. Crowd was hot, the band was hot, what more could you want....",1499299200,,598,4.6415094339622645

4529911,4,B0052EE3S4,Well... at age 70 I bought this...wanted to see what all the buzz was about since some classical violinist is including Thunderstruck in his  repertoire. Interesting at the least. I like Johnson's vocal energy and Angus's guitar for sure. I am not sure I want to live next door to someone sporting an AC/DC shirt . Unbridled sex like a dog or with discipline....?!,1431388800,,364,4.6875

4529919,4,B0052EE3S4,"Concert itself was great. Music quality great, bass is just right, stereo sound great. Brain Johns and Angus Young were dynamos and gave a great performance, Johnson's vocals spot on. Included all the usual AC/DC signatures such as Angus' striptease. Concert performance gets an A.

The video fails to get five stars due to some weak points. As other reviewers point out the editing results in quick sequences and there are some annoying split screens. Also a lot of time is spent showing the crowd and can get annoying during some songs. But other than Johnson and Angus, the other members of the band don't contribute that much to the energy so showing the crowd a lot was almost a necessity. The worst part for me was that the ""wide shots"" showing the entire stage were so close that you a lot of things were cropped out or the shots were so far back that unless you have the largest big screen television you can't get the full impact of the light show and extras going on (in the documentary one person even points out how far back the camera is and how the people sitting in that section can't see a lot). Video gets a B.

The documentary extra was pretty lame, focusing mostly on the Argentina fans and was a C at best....could even cut it from the DVD and have no effect.",1421452800,,1279,4.438297872340425

Top pressie though, and it saves having to view on You Tube 1 song at a time (some of the You Tube clips appear to be better quality than the DVD).

I have seen every major release all the way back to the midnight movie from the eightys by AC/DC and the donnington concert which is awsome, but to see the entire infield at this stadium jumping at the same time will blow your mind . This would have been a dream concert to be at, having some two hundred plus concerts on dvd It easily ranks in my top twenty. The camera - HD work is some of the best I have seen from any concert in my collection . The song selection is very good some new and many oldies but kick a** songs.

4529956,5,B0052EE3S4,"As a huge AC DC fan, this CD is incredible.  I was fortunate enough to enjoy the show live on tour BLACK ICE.  This is a quality reproduction of the live concert, antics, show and performance of one of the greatest bands of all time.  If you ever wanted to see AC DC in concert, this CD ""Live at River Plate"" is a close second to the real thing.
At the concert, my dad really wanted to see the cartoon that started off the show.  I looked everywhere and couldn't find it.  It is included in its entirety on this CD.  It is humerous and entertaining in typical AC DC fashion.  I am enormously pleased with this addition to my AC DC collection.",1355875200,2,642,4.170731707317073

4529961,5,B0052EE3S4,"I've been a fan of AC/DC now for the past 30+ years, and I know the band in and out. This concert shows them in their purest form with their original line up when Brian Johnson joined the band in 1980.

A few minor flaws in this concert are the 5.1 mix makes you sound farther away from the stage. I prefer to leave it in default 2.0 PCM.
Also the setlist should have included ""If you want Blood"" instead of ""Shot Down in Flames"". And should have included some songs from the ""Stiff Upper Lip"" CD.
And it is obvious this was filmed over 3 days. In one song, Phil has a cigarette in his mouth, then the next shot he doesn't, then he does in the next shot. Then he doesn't.

But overall, this is a must have DVD if you are a big fan like me.",1324944000,2,739,3.953020134228188
4529962,5,B0052EE3S4,Just got this great DVD for Christmas. I know it has been out for a few months but it made a nice gift to me from the family. We saw this concert in its arena form on this Black Ice tour and this is a great souvenir to have of it. Angus is probably slowing down but you can't tell from watching his performance. The rest of the band is as rock steady and professional as ever. This is my generation's Rolling Stones. They have so many great songs and they just keep keepin' on. I hope they keep at it till they can no longer pick up their guitars. Just love them and their high volume boogie rock n roll. I have read some complaints about the constant cutting between cameras but this is just the way things are done today. They have lots of cameras and the director tries to capture both audience and band with lots of cutaways and some split screens. I did not find it that distracting. The color and sound was fantastic. I also enjoyed the small documentary on doing the show in Argentina that was included as an extra. All in all nice package.,1324857600,,1047,4.213930348258707

4529965,5,B0052EE3S4,"I have been a fan of AC/DC/ for over 30 years. I listen to them everyday while I draw my graphic novels. I listen to both the Bon Scott and Brian Johnson eras. I love them both. I guess you have figured that I have every CD they ever recorded.
After their last CD before Black Ice, all I wish for for years was please just one more AC/DC CD. Well in 2008 I go my wish. Black Ice was released. It may sound crazy but I'd never been to one of their concerts. It's a long story. Well along with the new CD, this was probably going to be my last chance to see them. I actually got the tickets 10 seconds before they were sold out at Madison Square Garden. I was one of the best monents of my life. When their tour ended, the next thing I wished for was a live CD for the Black Ice tour. It didn't come out. They released the DVD instead, I never bought a DVD of AC/DC before because I was hartbroken that I never got to see them live. I order the DVD. and it was incredible in brought me back to Madison Square Garden. This thing is increadible! I have allready bought 5 for friends. Now I have so many  other DVDS to get from the best group in the history of rock and roll! Man, life is great with AC/DC in it. I will never forget them and just maybe they will do it again for me one more time. You have got to get this DVD. Even the teenagers today still listen to them. They are imortal! I'll stop now.

4529967,5,B0052EE3S4,"Like most people who purchased ""Live at River Plate"", I am also an AC/DC fanatic.  I have bought literally everything they have ever made over the years, and as far as Live DVD's go, this one is superior to the others.

My favorite DVD prior to this was ""Live at Donnington"".  The crowd in England was electric and MASSIVE!  They were on their ""A"" game.  Oh, I'm a fan of the old Bon Scott Live DVD as well.  I mean it's AC/DC we're talking about.  What's not to love?

What puts this latest effort above the rest is, well, geez...I can't put my finger on it.  The band sounds great.  They are right on every song.  The crowd is absolutely amazing.  They are so fired up!!!  They start Jumping at the first chord of ""Rock and Roll Train"" and just never stop.  Obviously anyone can get nitpicky about what songs they chose to play and stuff like that, but man, this thing is filmed wonderfully and truly shows the raw unabated power that is AC/DC.  No other band on the planet even comes close...not even in the same league.

If you're questioning buying this, just go on line and view the video for Rock and Roll Train or Dirty Deeds Live at River Plate.  I guarentee you will scoop this up in seconds.

Trust me...get it.  So much better than ""No Bull"" or anything else they've done in years.  They wanted this one, and they nailed it!",1313366400,7,1336,4.331983805668016
4529968,5,B0052EE3S4,"At this point in time, if I had to recommend 2 ACDC concerts on DVD, I would find it hard. However, with three, The collectors edition of Let There be Rock is essential, Live at Donnington, and Live at River Plate. The three concerts show how solid ACDC have been for a long time, and how they sweat blood to give the fans what they want. Whilst I have no problems with the quick cuts ( you have to remember that there are 32 cameras at least, over the three days of shooting), and since I saw what MAIDEN did with their Live in RIO quick cuts and loved that, so if you don't like that, at least remember the sound on this is amazing, and its current sound. The only difference in my recommendation is that Chris Slade does the most outrageously great drum work at Donnington, and in 5.1 its awesome. Phil Rudd's work here is great too, just different, more in line with the Let there be Rock sound.
  There are plenty of other concert videos of ACDC, so, if you prefer a more ""static"" approach, then take your pick. However, I got the DVD with T-shirt, and since no two concerts are ever the same ( even comparing them to when I saw them in 2001, or so on the Stiff Upper Lip Tour, where the concert was filmed in Munich and the CGI , 500 foot high, version of the Angus Statue used in the tour was SUPERB!! What I saw Live is the same feel as the three DVDs above I recommend, in my view) , I think it was almost inevitable that a quick cut edit was going to come out of it. If you don't like the Quick cut, just stick the DVD in a Theatre sound quality system, and listen to the guys ROCK !!!
Besides, if you don't like this, then change it for another ACDC dvd, its ALL great from the foremost Rock band in the world !!
( Afterthought: If the quick cuts are really that big a hassle, then put the play back to 50% or 35% of full, and you will see what you want, or better yet, watch the thing a lot, I am sure the news media is moving from 12 second to 4 second, if you say so, cuts, and this way you get to be ahead of the skill curve.)",1312329600,2,2041,4.0

In my opinion that's because this is not really music captured while the video was; it is video edited to follow previously recorded sessions. Otherwise you would hear the thousands of people screaming during the concert. I prefer ""really live."" I enjoy watching it as it was played.

Malcolm gets much more camera time this time. I prefer the drummer from Donnington better than this guy; I really don't want to watch someone play drums with a cigarette hanging of his mouth. Not very professional in my opinion. Overall, the music is great as AC/DC always is; but not really a Live Concert in my humble opinion.",1309046400,4,707,4.747967479674797

The concert is a steller Ac-DC one over 60,000  fans jumping and rocking in unison to ripping set performed by one of the worlds greatest r 'n'r bands of all time. Played  over 3 shows at the River Plate  football stadium in the Buenos Aires in Argentina and recorded in full HD at times with 12 cameras at  the concert  with regular 'cut in's' of the explosive South American crowd, I looked in awe as the 'rock frenzied' fans jumped and rocked at every note belted out by Brian Johnson,  unlike fans in the US and Europe they were  quite amazing!!!The Argentine women looked sooo beautiful expecially the ones in their bras! Ac-Dc certainly did not have much to do in working up the crowd they played their classics from the Back in Black album as well as the Bon Scott era classics and of course cuts from the new  'Black Ice' album they were promoting in 2009, however i thought more songs should have been played from the 'For those about to rock album. Angus worked the crowd well as well at Brian Johnson, god only knows how they do it performing for over 35 years. The rhythm section of Malcolm Young, Cliff Williams and Phil Rudd was solid as ever.
Fans would love the bonus features on the DVD as it takes you back stage as the band gave brief inteviews about their 9 day stay in Argentina.

4529981,5,B0052EE3S4,"Reading some reviews from all AC/DC DVDs, makes me realize what kind of AC/DC fans there's here.

There's always the high-rated 1 star review about how the video keeps changing angles and stuff.... who cares? AC/DC is not a band known for their perfectly done video editions, I mean, look at the Thunderstruck video from 1990, editing is a mess, but who the &$#! cares? Enjoy what you have, and most importantly, listen to the music!!!

Then there's the guy who says ""too much of the crowd, little of the band"" Well, DUH!! The crowd is one of the bests of the world and we have INFINTE material of the band playing, so when you have something to showcase in a DVD release, well, go do it well! The crowd is amazing, and the image looks superb, you can almost recognize EVERY face from the crowd at an amazing distance... kudos to the HD cameras here...

On the DVD, I think it's amazing. Maybe it seems better to me because I was at the River Plate concerts, (I went to the December 2nd show) and watching all my people there, singing, jumping in joy is just breath taking.
But that doesn't mean the DVD is bad, actually, it's amazing, take a look at ""Dog Eat Dog"" , ""Whole Lotta Rosie"", ""TNT"", ""Let There Be Rock"", ""Hells Bells"" , ""The Jack"", all are amazing versions that beat by far the ones in ""No Bull"" and ""Stiff Upper Lip Live"" and are there up with ""Live At Donington"".

Yeah, sure, the split screen is messed up at some points, but is it not great to see the band doing something and the crowd's reaction at the same time? Didn't you like watching Ang and Mal playing the Back in Black riff at the same time? or some great shots of 3 members at the same time WITHOUT changing angles so quickly?
And about that, here's some major improvement for the ones who doesn't like quick camera changes.... the end of ""TNT"" says it all.

Just go get the thing , sit down and enjoy more than 2 hours of the greatest rock n roll band on the planet and don't complain about the little things, you should be thankful that a bunch of guys at their 50s and 60s are still around and kickin ass!",1305936000,3,2085,4.295165394402035

I went for this with high expectations that this did not follow the same trend of previous releases (not only by AC/DC, but by other bands as well). No such luck. Editing is atrocious, you can barely watch someone playing at all, the takes are all over the place, changing from second to second.

Gosh, it's so frustrating. You know the music is there (after all, you're listening to it!), the performance is there, but can simply NOT SEE IT!

But, my goodness, it's almost painful to watch.  While they had 32 cameras I don't think they used them well at all in the final product.  No scene holds for more than a couple of seconds.  It bounces around all the time.  Oh, sure, you get Angus for a good amount of time but how many times do I need to see the crowd?  Come on guys.  I was really hoping, with that many cameras, that we'd be able to choose, at least sometimes, which camera angle to watch.  But, they didn't include that.  Instead, it's a very jumpy production.  And, way way way too much of the crowd shots.  I bought the DVD to see the band, not the crowd.  Spend a little time with the different angles.  I loved the one from behind Phil.  But, no, it's 1 second of that angle and then a cut to the crowd, and then then 1 second on Malcolm and back to the crowd.  This could have been soooo good.

Anyways regarding this DVD it was a pleasure to have a commemorative DVD for this tour and maybe their last, but once again there seems to be too much crowd scenes and not enough of JUST some ACDC on stage playing their arses off! I felt too bombarded every 4-5 seconds with a scene change, whether it be from band member to band member or from band member to crazy crowd. I wish they would've made it an option to be able to watch the DVD without so much of the crowd. If you saw them on this tour you will also see how they chopped up the animated beginning quite a bit and to me that was a shame because that really set the tone of the show. Whatever happened to music DVD's that concentrated on the group more than the crowd?
