1738220,5,B00006AGH3,"What a surprise.
From the first to the last minute I was in stitches. The storyline was fresh and original and Marissa Tomei is superb.
It is a seemingly accurate but humorous portrayal of how superficial Americans can be in assuming anyone of Indian or Asian Nationality must either work in a Indian Restaurant or is some religious Guru as is the case in this movie.
I would really put this up as one of the best comedies that have been released in the past couple of years.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie first and wasn't planning to go see it, but then when i had free tickets i thought: Why not?
Well, i'm glad i saw it, cause the movie is great fun!
It has a funny story (won't say anything), great soundtrack (specially the 2 versions of ""Chori Chori gori se"" haha....you'll see!), funny dancing, romance and a lot more.

1738275,4,B00006AGH3,"-  America is the land of dreams and riches. For Ram he is stagnant as a dance instructor in his native India. He decides to seek his fortune and move across the pond to the USA.
When answering an ad for a movie he discovers quickly that is for a porn movie.  Unable to rise up to the occasion, he seeks the sage advice of porn actress Sharonna (Heather Graham) and she sets him on a journey of the joy of sex.
Ram then coverts this new knowledge into a role of a sex guru, where he begins a rise up to fame and fortune.
Mixed in with a tad of Bollywood glamour, this movie is cute and shares the message that it all works out if you stay true to yourself.

1738306,5,B00006AGH3,"We went to see the US documentary Kumare the other night (don't know how to do the accent above the e) and on our way out of the theater we heard another couple talking, and one said tellingly, ""Nothing we haven't seen already in The Guru with Heather Graham.""  i'm glad she mentioned that Heather Graham part because as it turns out there are many many movies called The Guru, and when it came time to track down this film I would have gotten confused between Mike Myers and Peter Sellers and who knows who all else.  But Heather Graham is hard to miss.  If you haven't seen Kumare, it's hard to describe what makes the two movies so similar, considering this is supposed to be a fiction film and the new movie a a documentary but basically both of them are young, handsome Indian guys who decide to pose as gurus in order to--well, in this case, the guy needs money, and in the documentary, he wants to show the spiritual hunger in America that will snap up and make a star of any wannabe spiritual leader who can talk the talk.  We wound up liking The Guru quite a bit, but Miss Graham, have a long talk with your agent, why on earth are you making yet another movie that calls for you to play a pornstar?  After Boogie Nights, I would have thought you'd have said to yourself, OK, Ive done that now and i did it well.  Now let Lindsay Lohan or someone from a new generation play my old part.  But instead here she is doing it again, and it isn't all that amusing.

During the musical numbers, she looks gorgeous, the hair and makeup people are really on the job, but in the other parts of the movie she looks a little beat up, not just by life, but by the makeup artists having deserted her, like they never came back from their coffee break and she was a true professional and went ahead and did the scenes without anything on her face and her hair like soggy old dishwater.  Marisa Tomei had something of the same problem--she's supposed to be a heiress but she has to go through the motions she's not getting any help from anyone.  Jimi Mistry looks different in every scene, sometimes spookily like Adrien Brody (whom you would not want to be your guru, would you?) and in other places, the exaggerated eyebrows of Cruella De Vil.  But he seems like a good sport and the scenes where he learns to feel comfortable acting while naked are the sort of thing that makes you glad remote controls were invented with perpetual rewind buttons. Oh, but wait, in The Guru (2012 documentary) there is also a similar scene where the handsome fake guru (Vikram Gandhi) has to parade through a crowded cityscape with his own amazingass hanging out behind him, showing I think that, yes, I expect Gandhi saw this movie and learned plenty from it and went to work on his glutes right away just like good old Jimi Mistry.

And one learns the same lesson in both films, ""It doesn't matter that I, your fake guru, lied to you, because by this happening to you, you my devotees, have learned that we all of us carry our own guru inside of us, so let your feet march to the beat of your heart.""",1347753600,3,3081,4.339130434782609

1738347,2,B00006AGH3,"The Guru is one those pictures which is more interesting watching the film with the commentary on DVD than watching the film without it. Actually there are two sets of commentaries on the DVD: one with the director, Daisy von Scherler Mayer and screenwriter, Tracey Jackson together and another with the film's star, Jimi Mistry. There are all kinds of facts about the making of the picture that are quite fascinating (for example, the director decided to leave in a scene of a real-life paparazzi taking a picture of Heather Graham as the film was being shot!).

On the plus side, The Guru has a strong cast which includes the extremely funny and talented Michael McKean (I loved him in 'Coneheads'), Christine Baranski (she was excellent in the recent Broadway production of 'Boeing, Boeing') and the very versatile Marisa Tomei who steals the show here as a spoiled, neurotic daughter in a upper-crust New York family who pursues eastern spiritualism without giving up her western decadence and sense of entitlement.

Despite the potential, The Guru ends up as lightweight fare, the kind of entertainment you will soon forget about after a first viewing. While the plotting is more than acceptable, the problem is that the story simply isn't funny. This is mainly due to a lack of inspiration on the part of screenwriter Jackson. She readily admits that she intentionally softened up some of the more unsavory aspects of her story--particularly in her treatment of the porn industry, in order to lighten the overall mood. By doing so, she dumbs down her characters into sentimental cream puffs so that the humor no longer has an edge. No one clear-cut antagonist emerges for Ramu Gupta (The Guru) to oppose. Instead, the focus is more on his internal arc in which he battles the seduction of crass materialism.

Even if we are willing to accept the screenwriter's distorted but 'affectionate send-ups', the Guru has a more serious problem. If you think about it, The Guru is a story that could actually happen. How many times have we heard stories about various Svengali-like figures seducing masses of gullible people? Even though the Guru is supposed to be an exaggerated tale of seduction, the method by which the seduction is executed must be somewhat credible. When the Swami passes out at the catered party and Ramu has to pretend that he is now the all-knowing Guru, he first breaks into a dance which immediately seems to mesmerize the group of pretentious New York intellectuals who have been waiting for their next spiritual mentor to open up their chakras and show them 'the light'. It's a farcical moment, not very clever, but something we're willing to accept in order to see what comes next.

As it turns out, Gupta relies on his muse, Sharrona (Heather Graham), the porn star masquerading as a substitute teacher, for a string of aphorisms that somehow turns everybody into cult-like followers. The aphorisms aren't clever at all. Sharrona coughs up such profundities as ""Fear is cold, it freezes up""; when we come, we let go of our fears""; ""my pussy is the door to my soul"". The point is that the pretentious intellectuals are so stupid that they fall for these inane pontifications. It's obvious stuff and in screenwriter Jackson's dumbed-down world, the Guru has it TOO easy seducing these buffoons. Jackson's satire has no bite since she has created no credible targets to satirize. The Guru's victims needed to be more fleshed out, real people and the Guru needed a much more clever, original and believable plan rather than merely spouting a few trite aphorisms that sway everybody to him.

Toward the end of the film, the Guru jokes have worn out their welcome (they weren't funny at the beginning of the film too!). The Guru devolves into standard romantic comedy fare with Sharonna suddenly realizing that she was meant for Ramu all along. The Guru cannot be accused of not being good-natured however. In a plea for tolerance, Sharrona's fianc realizes that he too (all along) has been in love and at the movie's end he's fallen for his gay firefighter boyfriend.

The Guru was filmed on location in New York City as well as some of the early scenes on location in India. It's a colorful film, well-acted including some lively dance numbers. Nonetheless, The Guru is so lightweight that it lacks the main ingredient for comedy: laughs!!!",1236988800,2,4364,4.882591093117409

Marisa Tomei is appealing as the poor little rich girl who finds a leader in Mistry's character.

But I'll tell you - you have not LIVED until you've seen Michael McKean dancing Bollywood-style. The film is a great fusion of Bollywood musical with American-style romance.

It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Jimi Mistry, Heather Graham (who is GORGEOUS!), Marisa Tomei, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!

1738381,4,B00006AGH3,"This is a delightful romantic comedy, Bollywood style, with an excellent cast. Indian dance instructor, Ramu Gupta (Jimi Mistry), wants to seek fame and fortune. So, what better place is there to do that in than the United States? He leaves India and joins some of his friends who are already in New York and making it big, or so he thinks. He is quickly divested of that idea once he arrives and finds them working in restaurants and driving taxis.  He temporarily takes a job as a waiter in an Indian restaurant, while seeking his fame and fortune.

Ramu then seeks work in a film, initially not realizing the type of film that it is. When he gets the part, he meets his co-star, Sharonna (Heather Graham), who is a lovely young woman, but finds himself unable to go through with the role, despite Sharonna's philosophical guidance, as it is nothing more than a porn film. When he goes to a high society party where his friends are working, he finds himself with an unexpected opportunity, when the hired Swami falls down into a drunken stupor just before he is to begin entertaining the guests.  He is then thrust into the role of Swami. Passing off some of Sharonna's philosophical encouragement as pearls of wisdom, Ramu suddenly finds himself thrust into the role of the Guru of sex. It is at that party that he begins a relationship with the daughter of the house, Lexi (Marisa Tomei), a seriously silly, fabulously wealthy young woman who lacks direction in her life, but believe that she has found something special with Ramu.

With her connections, she puts Ramu on the fast track to fame and fortune. Still, his initial sexual philosophy came from Sharonna, so he arranges to meet with her for some more philosophical guidance, under the theory that he needs her help in order for him to be able to get over his fear of breaking into the porn business. Using her pearls of wisdom, Ramu develops a following, and Ramu, as well as  his friends,  find themselves traveling on a first class gravy train. In the meantime, Ramu also finds himself falling in love with Sharonna.

Sharonna, meanwhile, is leading a double life, as her firefighter fiance thinks that she is a substitute teacher. He and his family have no idea that she is a porn star, and she prefers to keep it that way.  Her fianc&eacute; is a serious Irish Catholic, who does not even believe in consummating their relationship before marriage. This should have told Sharonna something right off the bat. While helping Ramu, not knowing that her pearls of wisdom are being used by him in the context of his being the Guru of sex, she, too, begins falling in love with him, only she doesn't know it, as yet.

With its Bollywood style musical numbers, this is a fun, lighthearted  film that boasts an excellent cast. Heather Graham is simply wonderful in the role of Sharonna, the porn star with the heart of gold who is  doing it simply for the money. Jimi Mistry is delightful as the Guru of sex, funny and sexy. Marissa Tomei is terrific as the madcap heiress, who has too much money and too much time on her hands. Christina Baranski is excellent as Chantal, Lexi's wacky upper crust mother.  The film holds some surprises, but never fails to amuse. Those who like Bollywood style films, will definitely enjoy this one.",1118880000,9,3293,4.639175257731959
1738401,4,B00006AGH3,"Heather Graham is a comic actress of impeccable timing and really wonderful presence, it's a mystery to me why she's not cast in more big movies.

Annihoo.

""The Guru"" stars Jimi Mistry as Ramu Gupta, a disillusioned Indian dance instructor who comes to America to seek fame and fortune in the movies. Via a misunderstanding at an audition, a porn star with a brain (Graham in fine form) and

a wealthy society ne'er-do-anything girlfriend (Marisa Tomei), he finds himself catapulted into the adulation-filled world of a spiritual sex therapist, all the while trying to keep his twin identities secret from the ladies in his life.

This movie, while borrowing heavily from the fabulous Bollywood traditions of loud and colourful dance numbers and a sweet, simplistic plot, isn't really Bollywood - so very little of it actually takes place in India, and so very little of it has anything to do with song and dance. For all that, though, director Daisy von Scherler Mayer (what a fantastic name!!) has managed to produce what is essentially an American movie that retains the warmth and hectic vitality of the grander Bollywood romance stories.

Jimi Mistry is wonderful here; cast in a sympathetic role that plays to his expressions of wide-eyed naivete and his talent for subtle slapstick, he's charming and adsorbing enough as Ramu to make the hero of this movie a truly likeable character. Tomei is great as the jaded, shallow champagne spiritualist Lexi, and Graham shines in her role as the sensible, forthright porn star with a heart.

The only real problem with ""The Guru"" is that it's a little on the underdone side. It's a very standard plot saved by some highly endearing performances, but more could have been done with the staging and photography (and particularly Ramu's ""Grease"" fixation - it seems merely perfunctory) to make the production hop from the screen. That said, it's still a hugely entertaining sort of movie, and one that you'll definitely get a kick out of watching.

Yes, it's a parody of the whole indian guru thing, but there is a lot of wonderful philosophy in the thoughts Sharonna shares with Ramu. It may sound corny because it's so simplistic, but the greatest truths in life often are. The performances and the screenplay are perfect for the movie. Heather Graham and Marisa Tomei are both priceless, and those who reject their performances because they think it's silly and stupid are only losing out on a heart-warming experience that intellect alone could never create. Like the pornstar who is a wonderful, warm-hearted person inside, this movie is a gem under all that apparently corny fluff.

Inspite of  powerful performance by Heather Graham, playing an adult porn star in US, with an unusual sense of spiritual sexuality , Jimi Mistri, the Indian dance teacher who had come to US to become a big shot in Hollywood, and Marisa Tomei,the American girl who is obsessed with Guru culture, the plot has its inherent shortcomings. It ranks among one of the most disastrous and desperate attempts to make a comedy. Of course this movie should not be watched even with an ounce of seriousness....but even if you are looking for some light entertainment turning off your brains for a while (as many people want to do after a week's hard work), this movie will disappoint you....people are sort of hypnotized by the GURU ,so much so that they readily shake off their pants at his slightest indication...this is most unreal... can't they come up with something better if they are so desperate  to profane the Indian Guru culture? the DVD is ok...sound and picture quality is average. i will give the movie 2 stars, mainly because of some good acting from Heather, Jimi and Marisa but the plot does not even deserve one star !",1088380800,4,1179,4.718446601941747

After that, the movie gets off to a slow start, with Our Hero (Ram) moving to America, the land of opportunity. The opportunities aren't quite the ones he expected, or even really wanted. The first was thrust upon him when a faker of a fakir falls down drunk just before a performance. The second happens when he fails to get up for another kind of performance.

1738440,3,B00006AGH3,"Let me first remind you this; ""The Guru"" is not exactly a ""Bollywood-Meets-Hollywood"" film.  It's more like ""Boogie Nights"" in romantic comedy style.  And you see lovely Heather ""Roller Girl"" Graham as a porn film star (this time with clothes on, however).
The film's real star is Jimi Mistry (""East Is East"") as handsome dance instructor Ramu Gupta living in India, dreaming of success in America.  Determined to make it there just like his hero John Travolta's Danny in ""Grease,"" he goes to New York City only to find that cold reality.  The only chance he got is a porn film, and he blows it because of very embarrassing situation.
But he has a pep talk about sex from his co-star Heather Graham, and because of that advice accidentally is mistaken as a genuine New Age ""guru"" by Marisa Tomei's character.  Ramu gets famous, with a help from unsuspecting Graham, among those people who are willing to pay for any good, enlightening advice on life -- and it's New York you know that -- and he is about to be big when he knows that he is using her.  And moreover, he seems to have fallen in love with her.
The story is too contrived, and the script is too ineffective to be really interest us.  Ironically the ""guru"" part is not as good as romance part, lacking the power to convince us of the situation.  It is the characters that make up for the loss of plot coherence, brightening up with their good and delightful performances.  Let's forget about Ms. Graham's ""Killing Me Softly"" debacle for she is very charming, and so is Ms. Tomei, the latter even given a brief moment of displaying her sexiness you usually miss in her films.  But the most impressive is Jimi Mistry, always funny and likable even doing the most silly gags (see his auditioning dancing).
As to the Bollywood elements, ""The Guru"" succeeds in mixing them with Hollywood romantic comedy formula.  The dancing and songs look like real Indian films, and the music is aptly the combination of traditional instruments and techno pop.  I only regret that they use too few moments showing these ""Bollywood"" musical set-pieces.  The rest of the film is made from rather clithed ingredients from usual rom-coms and tired jokes including the ones about gays.
Light as feather, but still funny thanks to the able actors included, ""The Guru"" is a romantic comedy with a twist.  But the twist is too slight, and if you have not seen those delightful ""Bollywood"" films, I recommend you should see one of them first, or soon after watching this one.",1062374400,4,2508,4.670454545454546
1738441,4,B00006AGH3,"It's funny how you can come upon movies. While on a plane
earlier in the week I saw (in parts) a movie I'd never watch
on my own, ""Anger Mangement,"" which wasn't so bad. An actress
I'd never seen before, Heather Graham, had a small, uncredited
role. I tracked down ""The Guru"" from the Internet, and was
pleased that Marisa Tomei, who had a large role in the other
movie, was also in ""The Guru."" There is a bit of role reversal
here, for she has a much smaller role than Ms. Graham. I was
also attracted to ""The Guru"" because I've been into Eastern
teachings for a long time, but I am also quite aware of how
much fakery there is in the ""guru"" business.
  ""The Guru"" is in part a spoof on gurus and how rich people
who have nothing to do but meditate (on their navels!) will
believe just about anything. Imagine a Indian guru of sex, who
gets his information/inspiration from a porn star, yet thousands
of followers think he's wonderful!
  ""The Guru"" simply works. The lead actor, Jimi Mistry,
gives a great, believable, heart-felt performance. Ms. Graham
is also excellent - the role of a beautiful, deeply philosophical
porn star who is about to settle down with an unknowing fireman
into a mainstream life suits her to a tea. She also shows some
fine range in her role. The chemistry between the Indian
immigrant and the beautiful porn queen as teacher works
surprisingly well. Most of the secondary actors are very
effective, especially the actor who plays Mistry's sidekick
(later manager). The movie is about truth, being true to oneself,
and true love. The dancing and music are entertaining, uplifting,
therapeutic. ""The Guru"" is a fine movie also because it doesn't
take itself too seriously, so we can easily forgive the ""imperfections.""
  I am very quick to criticize the garbage that the movie
industry puts out, but more than willing to praise and recommend
a very unpretentious, entertaining, fast-paced romp, and I
would recommend ""The Guru"" to almost anyone. It is a movie that
would appeal to almost all ages and all tastes. I wouldn't be
surprised if it does very well in its post-theatrical ""incarnation""
through word-of-mouth recommendations.",1062201600,13,2161,4.764705882352941

music, good acting, a plot with intriguing and

has something more: it has a wonderfully witty
edge of social satire that has been so lacking
in movies of the past ten years. Paste all your
stereotype labels tightly on the charcters and
hold on to laugh hard and to be entertained, to
be sure -- but also maybe to learn a thing or two
and to find yourself challenging yourself about
stereotypes. In this seemingly classical romantic

It is incredibly stupid, with a laughable plot, and spoofs everything from the porn industry, to musicals, to religion, to Bollywood, to the American Dream.
I LOVED IT !
A young man from India, played by Jimi Mistry, influenced since childhood by American musicals, especially ""Grease"", is seduced by the promise of wealth in America, but finds the dream somewhat elusive when he finally arrives.
Stereotypically, he lives in an apartment with three other men, and works as a waiter in an ethnic restaurant. When this doesn't pan out, he makes an unremarkable non-entry to the porn industry, and meets the porno queen with the heart of gold, brilliantly portrayed by Heather Graham, who teaches him her version of the mysticism of sex.
Luckily, he accidentally makes contact with another set of stereotypes - rich, bored Americans seeking mystical solutions to their unfulfilled lives, and thanks to the power of alcohol, becomes the next Sex Guru, spouting the teachings of Sharona the porn queen. Marisa Tomei, as Lexi, a rich girl seeking spiritual gratification, carries her part very well, to the point of looking skeletally anorexic. Christine Baranski's lifted face is frightening to behold, but plays the warm, loving, maternal figure to perfection. (Just kidding)
The dance numbers are a violent clash of East and West, bringing the choreography of Indian movies to an all time low. There should have been A LOT MORE of them. Singing and dancing can make true Indian screen productions last up to 3 hours, and this movie was just too short.
As the plot would have it, people are not always what they seem, and both the Porn Queen and her good red-haired Catholic fiance, unbelievably named Rusty, are living double lives. Of course, the hero and heroine fall in love, leading to a strange and surreal ending.

An East Indian (played by Mistry) comes to America with the hope of making it big in Hollywood (could we get any more unoriginal?), stumbles into a porn studio and a star therein posing as a Catholic virgin. Following an equally predictable turn of doozy events, fails to hit it off in Hollywood (surprise?). Siphons off his [prostitute] friend's philosophy about life and lands up in a fortuitous position as a high-priced ""Guru"" by regurgitating this advice to the noveau riche of America (who clearly are gullible enough to fall for anything with ""Guru"" associated with it). Amidst all this sillyness, a lovestory blooms between the [prostitute] and our newfangled wiseman.
Mistry turns in a remarkably ludicrous performance, he can't even lipsynch to the songs if his life depended on it. Heather and Marisa, two admittedly hot numbers, are the minor saving graces of the movie. As is the occasional burst of pop hit singles. But neither the girls nor the lilting music manage to go too far in saving the utterly silly predicament.
If you don't mind a creampuff comedy (and that's a dignified label) laden with ethnic cliches that managed to put forced smiles on people unfamiliar with the real India, then this may be worth your time.

But with the  aid of the insightful Sharona, Ramu finds himself tackling the acting role of his career by becoming a self-styled Guru Of Sex with the experienced Sharona teaching him about the spirituality of sex- which he then uses on his followers without her knowledge. Of course Ramu becomes a sensation on TV so it's no surprise what happens next.
THE GURU is a strained, not terribly funny one-joke comedy which is a strange mix of sweet-naturedness with sleazy undertones. It's cheerful enough, but it doesn't really work. As proof that Hollywood has no new ideas, the movie rips off GREASE at the climax- clips of which are shown earlier with Indian subtitles.
THE GURU is a movie with a self-satisifed script, and this is always a bad sign for audiences: Apart from the GREASE [copy] note that a) Marisa Tomei's character gives an Oscar reference. We all know she's an Oscar winner, the cover of every one of her movies states that. b)Heather Graham's big break came by playing porn star Rollergirl in Paul Thomas Anderson's BOOGIE NIGHTS and c) The obvious ""Bollywood"" references which show Hollywood trying to be hip, because even though its well known India has the most prolific cinematic output worldwide; it's only recently that Western audiences are learning about it. Oh well, at least you get to see Heather clad in black PVC bondage gear. And from one of Ramu's Indian friends comes this dialogue which could only sound funny in an Indian accent: (after speaking to Sharona on the phone) ""I talked to a real life porn star!

1738469,4,B00006AGH3,"The Guru is a little film that snuck up in theaters during the bleak month of Janurary that offered a colorful and fun filled comedy romp about sex.  I have to admit, I had fun watching this movie.  The first time seeing it I really didn't laugh too much, just smiled a lot.  A few weeks later one of my friends hadn't seen it so I agreed to go watch it again.  I must say I laughed very hard the second time around.
The comedy gets better once you can fully appreciate how good some of the performances are.  Merissa Tomei was SO FUNNY in this.  When I saw Anger Management, which she was also in, I was so angry at the film's creators for not making more use of her! She really shows her excellent comedic ablities in The Guru.  It's amazing to think of her in dramatic roles (In the Bedroom for example), because she's a fine actress in them, but this is a total turn around for her.  She can play practically anything.
The other actors do a good job as well.  I especially like Christine Branaski as the upper class snob mother.  She was a hoot.  The cast is nice all around.
The major complaint I have is with the finale.  Was it cute?  Yes.  Was it sweet?  Yes.  Did it belong in The Guru?  NO!  For a movie so creative, funny, and original (its not in every movie indian dancers belt out songs from Grease in Bollywood fashion), that the cliche ""catch the girl and stop the wedding"" finale simply did not fit.  I would have liked an ending that could live up to the rest of the movie.
I also admired that the film didn't have to rely on gross out sex gags.  It is a sex comedy, but with wit and sophistocation.

The sexual overtones are indeed hillarious particularly the scene where Mistry fakes his role as a plumber to avoid a confrontation with Graham's fiancee.

The movie is about Ramu (Jimi Mistry) who has a dream of becoming a big star in America. He does not like the entertainment in India. He always enjoys the American entertainment (Grease for example) so much more. He loves to dance and wants be a star.
He tells his family that he is flying to American to become famous. So his family assumes that he will be driving a cab.
When he arrives, he moves in with his Indian friends Vijay (Emil Marwa) and Amit (Raahul Singh). There is a third roommate who does not have a single line in the whole movie and yet he is there. Ramu lands a job as a porn star along side Heather Graham (miscast). When he realizes that he is not really doing what he wants, he gets a great idea at a dinner party. The party is being hosted by Chantal (Christine Baranski) who hires a guru as a gift to Lexi (Marisa Tomei). The guru passes out and in steps in Ramu. He is a big hit and realizes what he has here. He becomes the sexual guru.
The sickest scene in the whole film is when Ramu gets to have sex with Lexi. I don't know what they, the powers that be, were thinking when they dressed Marisa up in that gross underwear.
To add more spice to the film, Sharonna (Heather Graham) is a ""subsitute teacher"", at least that is what she tells her fiance Rusty (played by Dash Mihok). Rusty is one of the members of New York's finest heros: a firefighter. Rusty is also religious strick when it comes to sex. Little does he know that his girl is a porn star.
Boy meets girl, girl gives out signals, boy missreads signals. Girl discovers truth about Ramu.
The funniest scene was at Sharonna and Rusty's wedding. Apparently Rusty does not love her but loves his ""2nd hose man on his truck"", Randy (Bobby Cannavale from Third Watch). That was a hysterically touching moment.

In the midst of it all came THE GURU, a wonderful romantic comedy that incorporates sex with Bollywood musicals. Why Universal decided to limit THE GURU's wide release just days before its theatrical premiere is beyond me. Maybe moving the release date to a less competitive weekend would have been a better answer (The Recruit, Biker Boys, and Final Destination 2 all started on Jan. 31st, 2003). THE GURU is a sweet, good-natured comedy with great performances by the entire cast, some hilarious comedic moments, and cute send-up's of BOLLYWOOD. The plot is outrageous, the situations are implausible, but the movie is plain FUN. It's a superb indie-like studio picture that benefits from bright dialogue and the impressive cast. The one thing I would have liked is to have seen more musical moments amidst the craziness...there was definitely potential for them. All in all, THE GURU is a great romantic comedy. Much lighter in tone than MONSOON WEDDING and much more fun (and shorter) than LAGAAN. Although dealing with porno and sex, it is all done tastefully and not as explicitly as it could have been.

But he is soon disheartened to realize that the only opportunities open for him include the stereotypical occupations of taxi cab driver or Indian restaurant waiter. During his quest to become a star Ramu meets Sharonna (Heather Graham) after mistakingly auditioning for a role in an adult movie and in addition meets Lexi (Marissa Tomei) while working during her birthday party. What follows is a comedic journey of love, sex and lots of laughs.
Director Daisy von Scherler succeeds in creating a funny movie, especially during instances when Ramu gets his English confused. Jimi Mistry played a convincing role. I hope to see more of him in upcoming movies. Heather Graham and Marissa Tomei are also good. Sure, there's not much depth in THE GURU but that's okay with me. It's fun to watch a goofy comedy once in a while.",1045353600,7,973,4.763313609467455

It is hilariously funny throughout the movie.  It's a very happy film with a message about finding ones path in life.  The theatre gave it a standing ovation, everyone I went with loved the movie as well.  I recommend it to all because I plan on buying this as soon as it comes out on DVD myself.  And the music rocks!!!",1043280000,18,471,4.177777777777778

It does help if you understand a bit about Bollywood movies, the guru-disciple relationship in Hindu tradition and cheap porno. Then the movie is very funny, poking fun at everyone.  If you miss the first two, or all three...well, you will end up baffled.

A dance instructor in India is lured to the states with promises of wealth from friends, only to find they made up most of it and are crammed into a NYC apartment, working as cabbies and wait staff.  He tries out for bit movie parts, not understanding that the tiny studio cranks out quick X flicks with titles like ""The Pride Of Miss Jean's Booty.""  There he meets a young women in ""the industry"" who leads a double life as an innocent school teacher to fulfill her dream of marriage and a house with a white picket fence.  Her beau, who is conservative (Catholic or Episcopal) falls for it.

The dance instructor saves the day at a society birthday party when the scheduled spiritual guru passes out before he can be introduced. Naturally, the dancer fills in and is a hit and then things begin to spiral out of control.

There were enough one-liners to keep me laughing, as well as a sweet undertone about people needing to be who they really are.  It's not Citizen Kane, but it is very funny.

As is the case with real Bollywood films, there are dance and singing numbers mixed in the film.  It is especially charming to see the entire cast of actors playing a society dinner party really do a dance routine.  Keep in mind that may were far from 20 years old. Actors learn to do it all, and it ain't as easy as it looks!

This is not a kid movie, as there is a lot of sex talk and some brief nudity.  I enjoyed it, especially the ""Graduate"" type church ending --with a surprise or two!",1438387200,,1944,4.424157303370786
