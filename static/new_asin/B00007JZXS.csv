1817423,4,B00007JZXS,"This movie does a great job of telling Ron's story and how he got to the cultural Icon that he is today. Hilarious clips from his past videos. I just got this as a gift along with a new Ron movie called ""Being Ron Jeremy"" For those who like Ron's comedic side check out the very funny DVD ""Being Ron Jeremy"" (also on Amazon) a spoof of ""Being John Malkovich"" starring Ron Jeremy and Andy Dick. It includes Ron's full stand-up act and a segment called ""Inside the Porn-Actors studio"" where Ron goes more in depth about his porn career then in ""Pornstar"".",1111276800,,553,4.378640776699029
1817424,4,B00007JZXS,"R.J. is quite the character.  It's dramatically shown in this documentary about him.  He's the fan of the everyman out there that sees him as the porn messiah.  He will speak his mind whenever and whatever occasion.  That is why, I look up to him, (not literally, but as a fan).  He goes with his gut and knows what he should expect in movies and what to expect from himself.  This documentary proves that RJ will always be talked about, in positive and negative terms.  If you asked him that he wouldn't really care what you thought.  It would appear though that he is a overall a nice guy with a big piece.

Which is kind of nice because when your with your friends they all gloat and go all night about telling you the girl they were with.  But in RJ's case, I think when watching one of his videos or this docu, he takes you along and shows you and wants to be respected and if you do that, then he would do the same to you.  His mainstream movies aren't to pretty to see.  But the girls sure are in main and behind the hand held camera.  Maybe that's why he's been in the business as long as he has.  Maybe that's why also I've been a fan of him for as long as I have to.

If your a fan of docu-porn this is a good one, it certainly beats Stacey Valentines.  It's also good because he recommends and suggests what he would do in some situations, with jokes and good clear humor.  His porn co-workers and pals are on hand and being interviewed and they give their insights on Ron and his career which is a good feature as well.  Thanks Ron for sharing your life and this video.",1108339200,,1581,4.144736842105263
1817425,3,B00007JZXS,"A veteran of over 1,600 adult films, Ron Jeremy is everything you would never expect to see in a porn star. He is not build, nor slim, nor anything except well equipped in the pants. One of this female fans describes his beast as 'Big, but spongy', whatever the hell that means. An extremely likeable guy on both camera and off camera. According to some of his adult industry friends, they all say he is one of the most nicest guys they ever met, and with his fame and success they would expect a prick but he is anything but that as you can in this documentary.

Scott J. Gill offers us a look inside Ron Jeremy's life, a life that might be a dream to many but we actually learn that it is not all it's cracked out to be. According to Ron and friends, he does get lonely just like everyone else and all the money and the fame he has can't fix that. To some this might seem stupid since he is a porn star and whatnotbut loneliness conquers all. With this said, this documentary does not make you feel bad for this guy, it is actually far from it. Here you have a guy bordering the big 50 who has slept with a ridiculous amount of women. One time he actually had sex with 14 women for 4 hours straight, now if that's not stamina I don't know what is.

Ron's dream was to be a mainstream actor, not an adult star. However, he got into the business and it doesn't seem like he will be getting out any time soon even though he getting old.

This documentary shows Ron's adult film buddies such as Seymore Butts and Tabitha Stevens, along with many others who offer a word or two about this guy who proves that even guys that look like him can get girls. I guess it's true what they say, looks don't matter, the size does, at least this documentary seems to speak that.",1105488000,4,1764,4.182352941176471
1817426,3,B00007JZXS,"This is a better documentary than I expected, but it has its problems.  Ron Jeremy comes across as a nice and sympathetic man, whose ambitions outside of porn are simply larger than his talents.  Yet you have to admire a guy who soldiers on anyway; in Hollywood, persistence is the key to success.  We get to see the workmanlike manner in which porn is assembled (hardly erotic), which is fascinating.  The clips of his white trashs fans are not, which is unfortunate because there is an entire story there about the kinds of straight men who are devoted fans of a male porn star.

But missed opportunities abound in this movie.  Ron is a man on the cusp of several important life choices.  How will he face being too old to do porn in a few years?  He wants to do more mainstream film, but can he give up the porn lifestyle?  He appears to have some kind of relationship with the woman Venice we see a few times, and he talks about wanting a real relationship; can he make it work?  There are some great stories there that are barely explored.  And his enormous phone binder with all those notes - what a launch pad for a documentary!

The movie never quite jells; we get a bunch of disparate things that are jammed together, without much narrative or plot as you would expect from the best documentaries.  But at a minimum, this is worth a rent, even if you are not familiar with the Hedgehog's work, or a big fan of porn.",1105401600,4,1424,4.3688212927756656
1817427,5,B00007JZXS,"first & foremost, you don't have to like pornography or documentaries necessarily to find this docu film enjoyable. in fact, it may very well give viewers an inside(no pun intended) look at one of america's happiest men. porn star succeeds because it's honest & has very little to hide as far as the industry goes in the eyes of mr. jeremy. ron jeremy speaks candidly in front of the camera & is always fun to watch. if you aren't careful, you jsut might learn a few things through a series of interviews with friends & those who've known or loved ron. we also get a very solid image of who mr. jeremy truly is which perhaps will break down many of our inevitable misconceptions.  mr. jeremy is not only a legend in the adult film industry (having made thousands of skin flicks) but he is a big cult figure in the mainstream entertainment business as well. it's extremely rare to see an actor in the adult film industry do well in mainstream cinema but this is mr. jeremy's ultimate dream & he mentions this throughout the entire film. we also get a glimpse of ron's earliest childhood memories which is very poignant & heartfelt. in between the interviews or candid talk with jeremy, we are treated to some clips from his body(no pun intended once again) of work which could easily stand beside some of the greatest moments in b- movie history &  even a little bit of animation like we would later see in michael moore's bowling for columbine. it's almost hard to believe that at one time the adult cinema closely resembles what are now considered to campy films or cult classics. in some ways, porn star is similiar to a reality tv show as we watch ron doing everyday activites such as traveling or being tested for sexually transmitted diseases at a local health clinic. although i've never been a real fan of documentaries as a general rule of thumb, porn star was an insightful & funny mixture of entertainment. i've seen this film several times since purcahsing my own copy last year in february. if you dig documentaries, this is most definately the film you'll want to see. if you don't like documentaries, this or bowling for columbine are a wonderful place to start. if only all documentaries could be this interesting, right?",1078358400,3,2236,4.629722921914357
1817428,4,B00007JZXS,"I would have NEVER watched this but my brother in law dropped it off & told me I needed to see it -- It was surprisingly better than I expected, more of a bio of Ron Jeremy than a behind-the-scenes look at the porn industry.  Ron Jeremy comes off as a normal guy --funny, optimistic, a little insecure, who just happens to act in porn films.  It's a job.  He could just as easily be a car salesman, accountant, or (as he once was) a special-education teacher.  He seems so normal.  His father, a physicist, interviewed for the film, seems like such a normal dad.  They have a normal father-son relationship.  His sister, interviewed for the film, seems like a straight-laced professional, very fond of her brother.  Ron Jeremy comes off as a slightly slovenly typical guy.  Other persons from the porn industry are interviewed for the film -- they don't come off nearly as well as Jeremy.  Particularly entertaining are the interviews of Grandpa (from the Munsters -- I don't know his real name).",1073520000,3,996,4.64
1817429,3,B00007JZXS,"Guys (and girls too) you know Ron Jeremy. Chances are, if you have ever watched two [adult] videos, Ron Jeremy was in one of them. In fact, you probably fast-forwarded through his scene. However, as you were fast-forwarding (and laughing at how ridiculous sex looks at high speed) you were you thinking, wow, how did this guy end up in this video? Jeremy is short, hairy, and fat, and yet somehow is the world's most recognizable porn star. You just gotta wonder: how did he do it?
Well, ponder no longer, Porn Star: The Legend of Ron Jeremy has arrived. This 80 minute documentary follows a day in the life of Ron Jeremy while telling his life story. Interviews with his family, friends, and his, ahem, distiguished colleagues, keep it interesting as they discuss the man, the myth, and of course, the legend. Actually, Jeremy is a pretty regular guy, and dare I say, boring.
Seriously though, we all owe a little debt of gratitude to Ron Jeremy. Deep down in places not usually discussed at the dinner table, we all (generally speaking) admire Ron Jeremy: the ugly guy who gets the hot girls. Jememy was in the first porn I ever saw and I'll never forget it. This may not be the crowning achievement Jememy wanted, but it is his legacy. God bless him for it.",1052092800,19,1260,4.5550660792951545
1817430,5,B00007JZXS,"if you have any doubts that ron jeremy is a geunuinely sincere and nice guy, see this movie.  it will set all stereotypes aside.",1051315200,2,128,4.333333333333333
1817431,5,B00007JZXS,"Adults Only!  To some of us men, Ron Jeremy was our ""Teacher"".  Through his films, he thought us how to make love and the art of sex.  If there was something we do not know quite how to do well, Ron Jeremy could show us the professional way. He talks about his boyhood, growing up, one of his first times, and how he got into the adult film business.  He will share with you many clips from some of his work and you will also get to see him ""at work'.  Much of the story is how Ron would like to be a legit actor in mainstream movies, but he has only been able to be an Extra or do small bit parts.  In Hollywood, if you have been known to do porno films, your chances of being ""an actor"" working your way to an Academy Award is zero. (There have been a couple exceptions, mostly in the soap opear business).  When ""Hollywood"" finds out you have done porn in the past, you're fired from your current acting job.  Ron Jeremy is trying to break the conception.  Now that Ron Jeremy is no longer the young stud of the 1970's and 1980's and has put on a few pounds, how is he still able to be wanted in the business and do more ""adult"" films?  Ron and some of his friends tells you and shows you why at the age of 49.  This DVD includes ADULTS ONLY material.  Full Male Nudity and Full Female Nudity and Real Sex and Language.  This DVD also includes many deleted scenes.",1050364800,28,1367,4.074906367041199
1817442,4,B00007JZXS,"Most mainsteam americans have at least heard the name Ron Jeremy, and many of those will admit to seeing his work...and the rest are lying.  An unlikely icon he is. A masters education in special educations, average looks (to start), also a decent actor,  and he makes his name in Pornographic films.  To top it off, as his career went on, he gets hairier and fatter, yet the work keeps coming in. Luckily for him despite the odds, he came ""equipted"" for the job from birth.  This film is a quick glimps inside his life.  He the man most guys wishes they could be, a great representation of an average american man, and as the film says, give anybody hope to go out with anybody, and that is his ticket to stardom.  enjoyable film, check it out.",1171497600,2,745,4.401459854014599
1817443,4,B00007JZXS,"I've seen Ron Jeremey in porn since his waist was 32 inches.  Starting with Suzy Superstar in the late 70's where he was studly to today's performances that aside from his phenomenal penile performances, usually amount to freak shows.

I have to say it does appeal to my purient interest to see a 50 something guy, with a 40+ waist putting it to a young 20 year old.  Reminds me of the story of Grendel and Beuwolf.  Jeremy being the hairy Troll of course.

Don't get me wrong, I have the same body hair and underwent the same metamorphosis as Jeremy, but thankfully my waist has stabized at +- 36.  LOL.  But I do look in the mirror and wonder at how the stud I once was has disappeared beneath the sweater of back and shoulder hair.

Ron Jeremy has always been a hero of mine.  I fell in love with his performances, one in particular in ""Snatchbuckler!""where he played a Captain Jack pirate character, Shadbelly,  long before Johnny Depp began acting.  His dialog was a plethora or ARRGGs! and creative salty langurage, as he gleefully impaled many a british lady prisoner on his massive ""rudder post"".  Great stuff.

This movie, while humanizing Jeremy, also shows his emotional frailty, and other things, like his apparent narcolepsy.  It hardly endeared him ot me to watch as he drove recklessly down the highway and shoulder while fighting to stay awake.  I'm glad I don't live and drive in L.A.

That aside, the movie is a hoot.  I plan to purchase the uncut, unrated version just for the titillating scenes of Jeremy with the latest female porn flavors of the day.

There will be no other Jeremy's simply because he is probably the only one that doesn't drink or do drugs.  North and Byron may join him on the pedestal eventually, but Jeremy will be on the top step.",1165276800,,1774,4.556962025316456
1817444,5,B00007JZXS,"This film is unbelievable...

For many, Ron Jeremy is the ultimately identifiable yet most unlikely male porn star... after watching this film you'll be even more amazed as he's so... neurotic and Jewish.

The film offers a behind the scenes look at not only the porn industry, but Ron Jeremy himself... who despite being a superstar seems more like a guy who just wants to be accepted and loved (especially by the mainstream film industry who will barely give him a part now and then in a small flasher film.) - - I dare say that some of the scenes in this film will stick with you a long time - - and you'll definitely never look at a dirty movie the same way as before !",1147824000,5,673,4.291338582677166
1817445,3,B00007JZXS,"Ron Jeremy is one of, if not the least, likely people to be a porn star. Ron is dying to break into mainstream movies. Ron is just your average, nice guy.

Throughout the film these three facts are somewhat repeated ENDLESSLY but through various friends, family, admirers and co-workers.

Its an entertaining, but short documentary that barely scratches the surface of what people really want to know about the world of porn. We learn all about Ron's amazing ""talents"" and his former loves...but the rest of the DVD is Ron trying to understand why no one from Hollywood will hire him. Yea, the AIDS test is scary....and should be....but that's really all there is on the serious side. The rest is Ron being a class clown. Fun and entertaining to watch...but what ISN'T said would be a heck of a lot more interesting.",1134864000,7,816,4.699300699300699
1817446,3,B00007JZXS,"Ron Jeremy was not always the fat, slightly slovenly looking man he is today.  When he entered the pornography business in the late 1970s he was reasonably if not uniquely attractive, determined to make a name for himself on stage and screen as a serious actor, and he saw pornography as a way to pay the bills and make contacts in the film industry.

The idea was not quite as far-out as it might seem. At the time, pornography was a big screen venue and films came with plots, dialogue, and reasonable budgets.  As it happened, Jeremy had what it took to be a porn star and then some: a nine and three-quarters inch endowment and the amazing ability to control it on cue.  But he failed to recognize a well-established show business fact that not even such legendary (and comparatively discreet) performers as Gypsy Rose Lee could overcome.  Once a stripper, always a stripper.  Once a porn star, always a porn star.

Twenty years after he made his adult film debut Ron Jeremy is still a porn star, only these days he is a chunky, sloppy one who commands a following largely due to his unlikely appearance and quasi-comic persona and who continues the career thanks to that near-inhuman control.  And even as he takes a monthly AIDS test, scrambles for extra and bit work in mainstream film, and makes one porn flick after another he continues to dream of a ""legitimate"" acting career that will never come.

In theory, it is the stuff of both great comedy and great tragedy, but this fairly short documentary is neither; it has a touch of pathos, a touch of humor, but it never goes far enough in its exploration of Jeremy as a human being.  I did laugh a little and I did feel a bit sorry for him, but the big questions were never asked and the big issues were never more than indicated.  In the end, I feel like I met Jeremy at a party in passing--and when he left the room I knew little more about him than I did when he first came in.

1817447,5,B00007JZXS,"Ron is disgusting, fat, hairy, greasy, he's not one to be considered a fabulous porn star...but he is. Even though the thought of him naked makes me want to vomit, you've got to respect Ron Jeremy fo putting himself out there, knowing that the people will see him with mixed emotions. This flick was great in my opinion, showing that Ron isn't the A-typical pornstar, and that he's actually a pretty hip character. I think even little kids should see this.",1128556800,2,456,4.6419753086419755
1817448,4,B00007JZXS,"Porn Star is a documentary that tells the real life story of Ron Jeremy; a seventies blue movie icon who continues to gallivant with beauties beyond the imaginations of most men both off screen and on. The joys these women offer leave most of us speechless, but Jeremy, not so surprisingly, seems rather desensitized to it all by the time we meet him. His life certainly is not one big party. Oh, he does go to parties, practically every night, but it is not to engage in wild activities. The reason he attends is more due to the fear of being alone than for the purposes of finding sex and euphoria. He is a very ambitious man, yet, paradoxically, his ambitions are constantly thwarted by the stigma attached to the profession which has made him famous.

There is a certain childish naivet that Jeremy has in regards to the outside world. He really doesn't know a whole lot about himself and seems to know even less about those around him. He is a sensitive man which is one of the reasons that the average viewer can so identify and like him. His ego is often hurt by the rejection of mainstream culture. Jeremy is so used to porn it's as if he cannot comprehend just how odious it is to some people. Even folks like this reviewer, who don't think there's anything wrong with his choosing such a lifestyle, are rather sickened by the sight of one of his costars have a pre-sex pow-pow with her ""husband,"" wherein they begin excitedly exchanging high fives in anticipation of the anal sex she is about to receive from Ron. ""What's our favorite kind of sex? Anal sex!"" Yuck, such rah rah, ""my wife is getting nailed,"" cheering is eerie indeed.

Jeremy brags about all the Hollywood movies he has appeared in until the production chiefs heard about it and cut his segments out. Their rejection wounds him deeply. He admits to flying all the way to Paris just so he could appear onscreen for five seconds before getting shot in the movie, Killing Zooey. He is so trusting that he even extends his good will to the person of the evil radical feminist, Susan Faludi (I couldn't believe it either), who, predictably, tears him to chubby shreds in print. Despite the mounds of cleavage and sultry femininity his body has enjoyed and probed, one cannot help but feel a little sorry for a man with so little preparation for the ways of the world.

Ultimately, Ron Jeremy is a very likable guy. This is not only because he is a ""regular Joe,"" but because he's self-effacing and sensitive. He is hurt when female porn stars insist in their contracts that they should not have to sleep with him, which points to the best thing that can be said in his favor, he is an authentic man. The life that he has, even if it sometimes doesn't look it, is real.",1128124800,5,2739,4.495983935742972
1817449,5,B00007JZXS,"Enjoyed it at movies, enjoyed it more at home.  Ron is such an average man, unhappy and lost in the image others have of him.  Great inside story of the grit under the glamor, the small town quality of sin without passion.",1124323200,,222,4.261904761904762

But, as a young starving actor, he found his way into porno and the rest is American freaky cultural history. Ron's father, Al Hyatt, is interviewed. Also mentioneed is his mother, who died of Parkinson's Disease when Ron was still a kid.

From here most of the emphasis is on Ron's career, both in porno and mainstream films as well as stand-up comedy. The picture that emerges is of an ambitious, intelligent guy who is also rather lonely and has a obsessive need for public attention. Hey, you gotta give the credit for what he has accomplished.

As a result, Jeremy has to remind us over and over again about the miniscule appearances he has made in non-adult roles.
