7168285,5,B00XJ091G2,"I purchased this video a while back and have been using it to train my horse. Sam Burrell does an EXCELLENT job on helping you understand how to install a thorough operating system, why you want to do this and spends time demonstrating the techniques he uses. I would highly recommend this video to anyone needing to increase their horses training, begin training or become a better rider.
Sam is easy to understand and his methods can easily be used.",1438473600,,451,4.65
7168286,5,B00XJ091G2,"First let me say, I never bought any horse training dvds before this one. And I'm glad I did. I have trained horses myself and wanted to see how Sam Burrell installs his operating system in a horse. Sam emphasizes in so many words that there is more to it than meets the eye and takes a long time to get a horse to respond well to all his aids and teachings. I can tell you first hand experience that at first it seems like you may be getting nowhere fast with Sam's method, but you must, to succeed, persevere no matter how long it takes. As Sam says, its not hard it just takes time. I watched this dvd 3 times so far and learned more than several new things that I will use. He visually shows you very clearly which leg he is using and how and where he is using it and the rein and  the positioning  for you to teach the horse to do what you want. This dvd solidly will get you loving to ride your horse more than ever if you follow his easy to learn tutoring. It will make your horse safe to ride which is very important and way more fun. Sam is very deliberate in what he says in the video so there is no misunderstanding him which may seem like it is taking to long to get to the point, but , that's what is so good about it. He teaches how a horse learns your cues and understands what you want him to do. I like to say, a lot of horseman/women have manual typewriter horses and some have electric typewriter horses. Electric typewriter horses are safer for the horse and the human and a whole lot more fun to ride. I recommend this video to everyone. hope this helps, Tom from NJ",1438473600,5,1587,4.050955414012739
7168287,4,B00XJ091G2,I am new to horses and this is the first DVD I bought and watched.  I was impressed with his horse's response to cues and that brings me to acknowledge his methods work.  I will need to watch several times to absorb.  It's good to have a my library.,1438473600,,249,4.040816326530612
7168288,5,B00XJ091G2,"very good and practical/delivery was fast
thanks for the discount",1438473600,,65,5.6
7168289,5,B00XJ091G2,"I haven't had time to watch the whole thing yet but Thank you, Charlie for the opportunity to review this DVD.  The quality of the recording seems great.  I will update when I get a chance to sit down and watch the whole thing.

I finally had a chance to watch the Sam Burrell video on ""How to install an operating system in your horse"".  I am impressed.  Sam has a way of explaining things that sinks in.  I now know why my trainer has me doing some of our exercises.  I  have a mare that needs no encouragement to go forward.  These exercises should help us communicate and I will be working on doing them at a walk.  The explanation of where your feet and legs should go and why is great.  I think I sometimes give my horse pre-signals unintentionally and I will be paying more attention to deliberately giving her signals so that she isn't anticipating but knows what I want to do.

I will watch this video asap and I am sure I will glean more out of it.",1438300800,2,958,4.174863387978142
7168290,5,B00XJ091G2,Very informative well many great tips. I recommend to novice as well long time horse people.,1438300800,,92,4.8125
7168291,4,B00XJ091G2,"Very dry and kind of boring, but very informative info. The informative info makes up for it being boring.",1438300800,,106,4.631578947368421

8716041,2,B00XJ091G2,Very boring video!,1518566400,,18,5.333333333333333
8716042,3,B00XJ091G2,"I liked the details of what he was teaching, but his voice was so monotone I just couldn't force my eyes to pay attention. He is a good trainer, but not much of an entertainer and if people have trouble staying alert it is difficult to learn. I had to watch in short spurts to keep my mind from wandering. It reminds me of a very knowledgeable professor I had who talked so darn slow and was so dry that his students couldn't help but drift off. Perhaps take these learning tools and have someone spice it up a bit to make it more entertaining and keep people alert during the lessons?",1505088000,,585,4.232142857142857
8716043,5,B00XJ091G2,Best horse training video I've ever seen. I wish pat Burrell would make a video on how he starts his horses on the ground.,1458000000,,122,4.125
8716044,5,B00XJ091G2,Gift for my granddaughter who continues to watch it.,1448150400,,52,4.888888888888889
8716045,4,B00XJ091G2,"I'm a trainer and instructor, and I had a student ask me to watch and review this video to see if it would be useful for her.  It will.  That said, I feel Sam uses some unconventional terminology and beliefs.  A leg yeild is not a bad thing, and you can leg yeild without dropping a shoulder.  Furthermore, he uses the term fullpass for sidepass.  His method for teaching the stop is great for a basic western or trail rider, but I feel he closes the door on pushing the horse into a balanced stop (for a more advanced balanced stop).  Furthermore, in the middle of the video he stresses not dropping shoulders but at the end, he tells you if your horse is going faster than you want you should pick up one rein and spiral them down.  One rein may not steer the shoulder on an inexperienced or spoiled horse on a sprial.  That said, he does a good job of focusing on your outside, indirect rein, which can be really confusing for inexperienced riders and I think there is a lot of value in this video for that alone.  Worth the purchase.",1444953600,4,1037,4.276923076923077
8716046,2,B00XJ091G2,"This is the most painful video to ever watch.  I feel like I want to finish...  every... sentence... this... guy.... says.....  I watch every video from start to finish when it comes to horses, I have not been able to finish this.",1442188800,4,230,4.428571428571429
8716047,5,B00XJ091G2,Love the step by step presentation for how to do various exercises with your horse.,1440633600,,83,4.6
8716048,4,B00XJ091G2,Good information. Especially for testing a new horse. I like that he tells you not to expect changes in 1 lesson.,1440547200,,113,4.428571428571429
8716049,5,B00XJ091G2,I'm new to horse training & have been reading & watching everything I can get my hands on in addition to a personal trainer. Sam's DVD is the best I have seen. It is so detailed and thorough I plan to use it as an integral part of MY training program.,1440115200,,251,3.9411764705882355
8716050,4,B00XJ091G2,Extremely good!  Recommend for everybody just starting to ride or have ridden for years.  Well worth the $.  Thanks!  Lynn,1438646400,,122,4.95
