2664322,2,B000IZJ20Q,"That sums up the problem with K-dramas. The producers said that it was hard to make a show based on a graphic novel that hadn't been finished yet. It doesn't seem that they struggled that hard with the challenge. The Palace is just a mindless regurgitation of K-drama cliches that should have been put out to pasture years ago. Here is the premise of this show. Boy loves girl, girl rejects boy so boy gets involved with another girl that he doesn't really like. The first girl then decides that she made a mistake so she tries to get back with the boy. The boy finds himself pulled between his first love and the new girl (because she is cute and good natured). The cute girl leaves the country (to study abroad or for business) and the boy realizes how much he loves her. Sound familiar? It should, it is the exact same plot of every single romantic K-drama that has been released in the last decade (and maybe longer).

When The Palace started I thought it would be different. The costumes and sets are gorgeous and the directing style riffs on anime style. But, within a few episodes, the lavish production can't hide the fact that there is nothing new here. Even worse, all the digital trickery of the first few episodes completely disappears.

Here is a breakdown of how a typical episode works. Character meets character and they talk. Next scene of characters sitting and talking. More characters talking while riding in a car. Characters talk while they eat. And finally, characters talk some more. Nothing is ever implied which can be stated. When characters are alone, they talk too. Throw in some tissue thin villians (a vengeful ex-crown princess and her ""too pretty to be a boy"" ex-prince) and much ado about a retroactive enthornment, and you have a series that would have been long at 12 episodes, but is torturous at 24.

The only person to come through this series looking good is Yoon Eun-Hye who is a Korean Audrey Hepburn. The rest of the cast, especially Kim Jeong-Hoon and Song Ji-hyo (washed out, mousy, and without an ounce of personality), will leave you reaching for the fast forward button.

And one more thing, if we are supposed to believe that a character spent their entire life in England, the least the producers could do is find an actor that can speak English.

Skip this and watch My Name is Kim Sam-Soon. It is the same exact story, too. But at least all the actors are good in that one.",1170028800,7,2425,4.578341013824885
2664323,5,B000IZJ20Q,"I love this Kdrama.  It has everything--great characters, gorgeous costumes and sets, an interesting storyline, and lots of fun!  In a fanciful tale set in modern day South Korea, the country's crown prince and an ordinary schoolgirl find themselves in an arranged marriage thanks to their grandfathers' whims.  Now two opposite personalities must somehow come together in this 'political marriage' and stand the test of jealous rivals, scheming royalty, and the media always following their every move.  Filmed in beautiful locations with an exquisite production design, this modern-day fairy tale is sure to please anyone--whether Korean or not.  I was pleased to see that this U.S. release by YA Entertainment did justice to the series; not only is the packaging beautiful, but there are also quality English subtitles and a fairly wide array of bonus features.  I would recommend this show to anyone who loves a fairy tale romance with a beautiful cast and lots of comedy along the way!  :)",1164585600,25,994,5.136645962732919
2664324,5,B000IZJ20Q,"This is a film set in fictional modern day Korea. It has a soap opera feel but is suitable for all audiences. When a young girl Chae-kyeong(19) learns that she is the fiancee of prince Lee Shin, she is shocked and surprised. She eventually agrees to marry him to help her family who is about to go bankrupt. Unfortunately prince Lee Shin is a difficult young man to like, and Prince Yool (his cousin) has also fallen for her. Will Chae-Kyeong win her husband's heart or is she destined for heartbreak?

Thus begins a love triangle which takes up most of this film. I admit, although I found Prince Lee Shin hot, I preferred Prince Yool for his devoted qualities. Some of the things Lee tells Chae-Kyeong are pretty terrible. Also some of the costumes were really outrageous.

I enjoyed Chae-Kyeong. The actress who plays her is fantastic and her facial expressions are great. I really wish there will be a second season, but that doesn't look to be in the cards. Overall, this was a vastly entertaining series.",1200614400,10,1010,4.636871508379889
2664325,5,B000IZJ20Q,"Never heard this korean drama before and after watching the movie clips in YouTube, I immediate bought the DVD and i looooooove it. Warm, light and romantic. I love Crown Princess(Yoon). She is very funny and you can easily relate to her being quirky and airhead. I am hooked. I highly recommend this K-drama eventhough i don't understand korean and just watching it thru subtitles. Still, if you are a romantic and is a sucker for cinderella type movies, this one's for YOU!",1189555200,4,475,4.734939759036145
2664326,5,B000IZJ20Q,"This is still one of my favorite K-dramas of all time. It is such a unique story line. Basically, it is based around the premise that Korea still had a monarchy in present day and they lived in the palace. A commoner girl, who's grandfather made a pact with his friend who was the King at the time, that their grandchildren would get married. Now the time has come and she must move into the palace and learn how to one day be the future queen. However, her future husband and her have made a pact of their own. He says he will grant her freedom later and give her a divorce if she goes along with it now, letting her poor family be taken care of with money and to get them out of debt. The prince however, is in love with someone else and also must compete with his cousin for a title he doesn't necessarily care about. With evil aunts, backstabbing cousins, love triangles and chaos it is everything a good K-drama should have. The acting is fantastic, the guys are hot (aren't they always :) and this boxset is beautiful with perfect subtitles. Don't miss out!",1188086400,17,1063,4.32
2664327,5,B000IZJ20Q,"Maybe Princess Hours has some similarities with other Korean series, but Princess Hours stepped up to present a Korean drama series like no other. New actors Yoon Eun Hye (Shin Chae-Gyung) and Joo Ji Hoon (Prince Lee Shin) gave dignity to their roles as Crown Prince and Crown Princess. Even though they were new to the acting industry they have presented their characters so well that made this series so lovable. While watching Princess Hours you will feel a tingle in your body and little by little you will fell in love with it. Like any other Korean romance series they also have a comedy side on it and you will laugh your heart out watching it. Every episode is worth watching for. What I love about Korean series or any other Asian series is the pacing of the story. They know how to make each episode interesting so that you won't get bored watching it.  The cinematography of the whole series was amazing and you will never see that on other Korean series. The actors together with the whole production of Princess Hours did a great job adapting the Goong mangga to the small screen.

I've already seen it thrice and I just can't get enough of it because I really fell in love with this series. I hope to see a Princess Hours Season 2.",1182124800,4,1245,4.4801762114537445
2664328,4,B000IZJ20Q,"I must say that this drama was well done. The main female lead didn't come off as ""strong"" and ""I can do anything"" sort of way. And the supporting female character, I felt was not annoying or too obtrusive (much like most of them are made out to be). The acting was superb and things ranging from the costumes, settings, and music kept me intrigued in the series the entire time. Another note I'd like to add (for my own satisfication), I strongly felt that the supporting male character was much more deserving of the lead actress. But, alas, like any typical Korean drama, this is never the case. The lead male and female must always come together. This is a must see for anyone interested in seeing the lives of rich people, figureheads of a country, and such, and the many things they must go through to maintain what they have.",1181606400,2,832,4.480263157894737

2664331,5,B000IZJ20Q,"I just saw the drama and its so cute. None of the characters in the drama makes you really hate them. All the character have their own reasons for acting the way they do. Its another one of those tales of how boy meets girl, boy and girl hates one another, boy and girl falls in love one another and then problems strikes which causes boy and girl to separate. Of course like most love stories the boy and girl finally end up together. The acting might not be to good but the story line is pretty good. I found out that it was pretty fun to watch and wanted to know how everything connected in the end. My favorite parts were the teddy bears but if you guys want to know what I'm talking about you'll have to see it.",1178496000,3,716,4.085106382978723

I am a repeat customer, and the reason I'm a repeat customer is because when I buy from this vendor, I know I'm getting not a good product, but a GREAT product.  Mail delivery is super quick since it comes priority mail, DVDs have always come well wrapped, DVD quality great, and English sub-titles excellent.  I am certain if I received a product I was unhappy with the vendor would work with me to resolve the issue.  I can't say enough good things about this vendor, and will definitely continue to buy from them with future purchases as I develop my Korean drama library.",1361577600,,687,4.560975609756097

8147846,5,B000IZJ20Q,"This series was very entertaining with the comedy, drama, romance. This movie was about an average girl that was pledged by previous kings to an arranged marriage with the Crown Prince of a modern type Korea. Nice twist to that. Like having an American Movie still be controlled by Britain.

Loved the Drama, I'm betting that most people that like the Korean Dramas will also.",1306713600,,376,4.7846153846153845

Sad thing is I cant translate Korean and the package states to read warning label before opening.. and I cant. all I know is that the package I recieved is not this item I thought I was getting. I cant even find the box I recv'd today in the product link. I will never order from this merchant( The Rolling Donut) again. Took 2 weeks and 1 day to receive my package.

8147848,5,B000IZJ20Q,I absolutely LOVE my DVD set! It is very organized and very presentable! This is the only Korean drama I bought that came with Special Features and they are great! I think the best part about this are the English subtitles because some Asian dramas that I've purchased in the past haven't exactly had the correct use of English subtitles--this one by far is the best!,1226275200,,367,4.575757575757576
8147849,5,B000IZJ20Q,"I love Princess Hours.  I rented it on Netflix, I didn't really know what to expect when I read their review. It had such high ratings from the people who watched it, I had to give it a try.  I'm very glad I did.  I'm not the kind of person to watching anything girly or sugar sweet.  But this was perfect.  It's got a great balance of comedy and drama.  There is a realistic depth to the characters, which makes them likable.  I was laughing and crying the whole way.  I spent a lot of the time on the edge of my seat waiting to see how things turned out.  Waiting for the next disc was painful.
The basic plot:
Modern day Korea, but with a twist.  There saying what if the Monarchy system was still in place.  It's all about what happens when an old promise between the last King and his friend who was a commoner, for there grandchildren to marry.  Enter Crown Prince Shin, still in high school mind you, who's as vain and egotistical as they come.  Then there's Chea-Kyung (Gyung in the Korean version), sweet, loud and very determined.  The two are forced into an arranged marriage.  That only the beginning, the real fun starts after they're married and have to live together.  With both of them being pursed romantically by other people, and having to keep face for the Royal family.  There going to have to learn to like each other, weather they want to or not.
Funny, sad, romantic, and jaw dropping, this show is a must see.  It's a little slow the first 2 episodes.  But they help lay the foundation for all the fun that comes after them.  This is a must see for all those who love Kdramas, or anyone who loves TV dramas in general.",1214352000,5,1643,4.30718954248366
8147850,4,B000IZJ20Q,"The DVD itself is wonderful. However, I am disappointed at how long it took to receive the DVD. I ordered ""Full House"" from another provider for a lower price and received it faster than my order from AMAZON. This does not stop me from purchasing from AMAZON; however, I will think twice when it comes to these types of DVD box sets.
Palace is an awesome series, and I watched it with my mother who also enjoyed it.",1206576000,,415,4.333333333333333
8147851,5,B000IZJ20Q,I really loved this drama. The story line is very romantic and filled with hilarious comedy. After watching just one hour of this show i coulldn't stop. I ended up watching the whole series in one night.,1201996800,,203,4.513513513513513
