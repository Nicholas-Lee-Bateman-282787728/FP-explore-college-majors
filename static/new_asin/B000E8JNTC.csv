8107051,5,B000E8JNTC,"Was born and raised in France so Cousteau is part on my TV culture! This is so nice to be able to watch these expeditions again on TV. My hubby and I are fond of them! Our child is also watching them and cannot have enough of it! These are great as educational programs. Of course, some of the methods will raise your eyebrows (like blowing up a pond with dynamite to make a catalog of aquatic species! and punching the shark in the nose) but you have to remember WHEN this was done. NOBODY had done this before! Cousteau made us discover a complete new world and made a generation of ocean lovers like us. Besides these unorthodox methods, Cousteau was the first one to raise awareness about the negative impact of men on the ocean. So I cannot recommend more these Cousteau's DVDs.",1424822400,3,783,4.406896551724138

8107055,5,B000E8JNTC,"A good product in good condition and in common with the other Cousteau DVDs, nicely packaged.

More comment on wider issues in this series than just water and animals, but I guess Cousteau was looking for another angle on things as David Attenborough has.

Most enjoyable!",1297123200,3,272,4.891304347826087
8107056,5,B000E8JNTC,"The Cousteau Amazon series is monumental and worth five stars in itself.

The picture quality of these excursions is not perfect but I think it gives a feel for the time in which they were created. I can't remember seeing any better picture when I first saw these in the early eighties. Back then you were lucky to have more than a 19 inch color set. So if you're not spoiled by HD/enhanced everything, these are fine. I'm happy to have any of Cousteau's work available in this permanent form.

The refit of Calypso in preparation for the Amazon reminds of my days as a member of ""Friends of Calypso"" in the Cousteau Society. One benefit of that was to receive small piece of wood taken from planks removed from the hull of Calypso. I still have it.

What young man of those times did not take SCUBA training and not dream of signing on to crew the great ship, I know I did. So relive those wonderful days and have those dreams all over again.

(This set comes from Amazon in three double-disc thin cases, which together use only .75 inch of shelf space. -- If you have the other Cousteau sets in thick cases, buy double-disc thin cases and transfer them. It takes some work to do, but when complete all three sets will fit in 2.25 inches.)

8107057,1,B000E8JNTC,"I purchased this collection because  I was interested in rediscovering the TV series. Mississippi and the Amazon are the last demosnstration of the climax of Cousteu. Anyway, the producers could have managed to make the image a lot better without much work: adjusting sharpness, video, blacks, gamma and chroma the product would have been 400% better. Regarding the Danube  episodes they are a shame. After Mr Cousteau fought with Jean Michel and the crew of all his life he remained alone. He simply managed to convince TBS to make home movies with his new kids. I've done better home movies than these chapters, not talking about the poor image  and story quality.",1150156800,13,666,4.928571428571429
