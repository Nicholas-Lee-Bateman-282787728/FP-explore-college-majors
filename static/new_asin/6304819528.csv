939372,5,6304819528,"Just when you think you have the case pretty much figured out; ol' NEVER PLEAD GUILTY Rumpole surprises everyone -- including himself!! He is a tenacious old English bulldog and pursues the right course no matter what. Yet his humility, masked in a bumbling English persona, never ceases to bring a childlike wonder to the screen. What you see is Man in all his charm, deviousness, and pride, Yet there is something positively honest, authentic and redeeming about the barrister. He brings justice to the married couple who do not divorce, and gets ""his man""  - dirty Dickerson at the end. Runpole is a genuine person, not a religious or secular mannequin who postures for the public. Watch the ol' boy and learn what it means to be a human being.",1063324800,,747,4.702290076335878
939373,1,6304819528,"Katharine Hepburn is breathtakingly beautiful and a wonderful actress to boot in this, her very first film.  BUT, this film is terrible.  One wants to smack all of the characters for needlessly throwing their lives overboard.  I'm a sympathetic girl but only to a point.  It's impossible to sympathize with the motivations of Hepburn and the whole lot.",1004140800,,352,5.017241379310345
939374,5,6304819528,"Hedy Lamarr plays a professional editor for a women's glamour magazine involved in a murder investigation. As police probe, suspicions turn her  way. She's not the person she is believed to be. Also starring: Dennis  O'Keefe, John Loder
We love Hedy Lamarr. In real life, she is the reason  behind the cellular phone technology. During WWII, she patented a means to  help navy devise a radio-signal to guide torpedoes that would the Germans  couldn't blow up. She suggested a shifting sequence, as in the signal of  one device would synchronize like a musical song with another. If you  didn't know the song, you couldn't jam the radio signal. She never  collected a dime. After her patent expired and ignorance died out, the navy  re-looked at her idea. Hedy Lamarr-- the lovely actress with a clever mind!",967680000,11,807,4.875
939375,5,6304819528,"Despite Boyer's unfounded criticism of Hedy's acting ability, this is a wonderful film in which she displays a range of emotions including perhaps the hardest thing to act, being tipsy. She is a good actress and is totally gorgeous as a NYC ""modern woman"" with a promiscuity problem in this film. Through the Providential intervention of a wise shrink, one wonders if she will overcome it and find true happiness as a simple doctor's wife--or revert to life as a well-paid, hi-fashion mag. editor... Helen Gurly Brown should be so lucky to have Hedy's looks!
One of her six husbands and the father of two of her children, John Loder, is in this film as well. If you like Hedy, you'll like this film and you'll like seeing John Loder get dead.",948585600,9,742,4.628787878787879

939484,4,6304819528,"I have loved this film from back in the day when all the movies on television were black and white. Great actors, great plots, and shocking stories about strong women who had to fight their way through a society that judged them harshly, for whatever reason. This is a beautifully done film that deserves to be released with corrected sound quality. As much as I loved it, I had to stop watching this version because the quality was so poor. For that reason alone, I am deducting a star.",1469318400,,487,4.48314606741573

939486,4,6304819528,"Entertaining film with Hedy Lamarr  has a high powered art director.  Again as with most vintage films one has to over look some inherent sexism in how the genders are treated differently.  Also, the psychologist is more of a mind reader versus a therapist but at this time in the USA the majority of Americans had limited access or knowledge of the field. The presentation here has nearly a carnival aspect to it.

Hedy as always is beautiful and has that indefinable star quality.  The supporting male actors were chosen not to outshine her which works with the story line of the film.",1468713600,,587,4.660194174757281

The movie is an ""honesty is the best policy"" morality tale. Superficial and predictable, the writing is nothing special, and the male actors are merely adequate, so the only reason to see this film is Ms. Lamarr, but that is reason enough.",1465516800,,365,4.703125

939543,3,6304819528,"We had a problem with the sound being echo-y and the B/W video seemed to be a kinescope. The film took a bit to develop a story but the resolution of her problem was clever. Hedy Lamar was a good Hedy Lamar, i.e., eye candy; Dennis O'Keefe seemed miscast. Portrayal of her love interest was flat. Entertaining but not above a B minus grade.",1445558400,,340,4.328125

939545,3,6304819528,Hedy Lamar is stunning.  The plot is predictable but still holds your interest. The movie is dated in the fact that it is hard to empathize in 2015 the outrage society felt concerning Hedy Lamar's love affair. What made this movie difficult to watch was the poor quality of the film. It badly needs to be restored.,1438992000,,314,4.508771929824562

939612,3,6304819528,"Here is a film ripoff of a play, according to what I read.
I also read that this was a vehicle for the lead, though it seems funny to me that a woman would go out of her way to play a dishonored woman as a showcase for herself. I went in blind, and it seems early that it's fairly exploitative and by the end it becomes more of a legitimate film. I wish it had chosen one route.

We follow a dark protagonist, a beautiful woman working for a magazine, a whore and thrill seeker who apparently takes after her poppa, who was apparently a pink plunderer with an artistic flair. That's mentioned, but again the movie feels split in two between the skank-at-large and the story of the redeemed lady.

The dishonored lady meets the man of her dreams, a geeky scientist. It's not totally convincing when he falls snap out of infatuation for her when confronted with her other side. Plot is too much at the forefront. The acting is fairly good. In some instances the film chooses to ""tell rather than show"" with a virtuous psychiatrist character. The film seems to me to milk Casablanca and Citizen Kane imagery, but maybe I'm crazy.

It brings some sadness to me when reminded of the fact that at one point it was actually a bad thing to be a whore. That day is behind us. These days, it's pretty hard to become ""dishonored"".",1297382400,,1319,4.375510204081633

939618,5,6304819528,"Hedy Lamarr at her BEST.  After her production role of the fascinating and morally complex STRANGE WOMAN (see my separate 5 star review for that), Hedy was awarded this great murder mystery, based on a true story, DISHONORED LADY.

  I saw this on a very poor VHS transfer (not purchased through Amazon).  The script is wonderful - a bit melodramatic, the casting is great, but the post production aspects, especially the music are a real disappointment because Hedy shines in this film with HER FINEST ACTING WORK ON FILM.  In another role that is complex and real in its portrayal of a ""party girl"" trying to straighten out her life, her self, when she becomes a murder suspect.

  This is a real ""slice of time"" film in that it deals with women who were working, ""like men"" who ""thought like men"" i.e. enjoied and wanted careers; which was considered a real social problem at the time as men came back from the war and wanted their jobs back.  Women were meanwhile enjoing the freedom of having their own jobs their own independence, and this was seen as transgressive, especially if the woman, like this one, was also sexually liberated.

  The script hits all these notes appropriately, but the awful operatic music hammers away.  Fortunately, that wasn't on the set.  Hedy gives a layered, thoughtful, and - a rarity - a relaxed, humorous, and joyful performance.  She has a ""drunk scene"" that is playful and completely real, a very subtly funny portrayal of being ""pleasantly inebriated.""  All this makes me think this must be who she truly was.  She had just finished a film she had fought for, and was working on this fantastic character who liked working and was interested in science (as she was herself).  It is simply a MUST see for any Hedy Lamar film  (as is THE STRANGE WOMAN for other reasons)- for a glimpse of her entire range.

  Looking at her bios, this was a turning point where she started her disenchantement with roles she was being offered.  She is beautiful and tempestuous in the later SAMPSON AND DELILAH, but her heart is not in that the way it is in this film.  And she slowed down her acting quite a bit after these.

  See this to see Hedy Lamar the actress surrounded by a great supporting cast (including Margaret Hamilton - Dorothy's wicked witch), in a film which I feel is her finest work.",1143504000,2,2328,4.625916870415648
