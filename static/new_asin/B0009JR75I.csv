8062672,5,B0009JR75I,"This recital by Frank Braley offers a varied program of works by Liszt, Debussy and Gershwin. Unusually the whole program is played without a break and without applause even though it is `live'. As a result the pianist is able to achieve an unusual level of continuous and unbroken thinking as regards his performance.

The first three items are all by Liszt and are all thoughtfully inward pieces. This is not to say that they are in any way easy to play! Braley's stye of playing throughout this recital is as if in private communication with the composer with a range of facial expressions suggesting almost a conversation and with some occasional shared amusement. The works by Liszt are two of the Petrach Sonnets (123 & 104) followed by La Lugubre Gondole.

These are followed by a selection of 9 Debussy preludes played out of normal order. They include 6 from the first book and 3 from the second. These too are played with the same sort of internal raptness that marked the Liszt.

The recital finishes with an arrangement for solo piano of Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue which is played with considerable flair. This, being the end of the official recital, is followed by the enthusiastic and long-awaited applause then Gershwin's 3rd Prelude as a short encore.

The recording quality is excellent with crisp and involving imaging where the remote camera work is totally sympathetic. The sound is particularly realistic as is the case with all the discs in this series of concerts. In this case the sound is presented in DTS 5.1, Dolby digital 5.1 and stereo.

This is an absorbing recital and very well recorded. It is therefore reasonable to expect many purchasers to get considerable pleasure from it and therefore for it to be assessed as a full 5 star issue.

Further note on this series:

The series of concerts at the Roque d'Antheron has been recorded within a specially built recording venue which features state of the art recording facilities producing wonderful piano sound and sympathetic remotely controlled camera work. The intention was to record outstanding recitals each year and to release them on DVD. In reality this project seems to have stalled with only a handful of issues released in 2002 and 2004. But what riches they contain! This is as good a place to start as any. Once you have one you will want them all. There are 13 and the titles are spread around but not usually under the artists, the music or the venue. At the moment the most effective search on Amazon has been to choose the category `Film & TV' then search 'naive dvd' within it. You will then find most of the series is listed. A wonderful collection of great artistic and recorded merit.

Outstanding recitalists in the series, featuring several previously unknown to me, include Boris Berezovsky, Frank Braley, Eliso Virsaladze, Francesco Libetta, Frederic Guy, Nicolai Luganski, Paul Lewis, Vanessa Wagner, Zoltan Kocsis and the Ivaldi / Pennetier duo",1343520000,,2954,4.870517928286852
