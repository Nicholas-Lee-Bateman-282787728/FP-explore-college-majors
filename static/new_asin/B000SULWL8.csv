2890885,5,B000SULWL8,Great collection of C&L episodes.  We've purchased nearly all the volumes because my son loves this show.  It's cute and fun and always has a good message.  The books are amazing too.,1231718400,,183,4.65625
2890886,5,B000SULWL8,I would order from this person again. The product arrived in good condition and in time to enjoy for Christmas.,1231200000,,111,4.6
2890887,5,B000SULWL8,"This DVD has several episodes on it, not just the one about Christmas.  My 3 year old loves Charlie and Lola, and I don't mind watching the DVD over and over again with him.",1198713600,8,173,4.088235294117647
2890888,5,B000SULWL8,"From all of the Charlie and Lola dvd's, this is our favorite.  They are all really good though but we like this one because it has a Christmas episode in there.  The Charlie and Lola cartoons, are so thoughtful and stylish and thinking outside the typical cartoon you see on tv these days.  The artwork, the music, and the characaters are so friendly and helpful towards one another and just a nice cartoon you want your kids to see instead of the violence and weirdness you see. I really like the relationship the brother-sister duo has.  Imaginative and just cozy.  This is a winner in our library.",1197158400,10,600,4.570093457943925
2890889,5,B000SULWL8,"All right, so maybe the DVD isn't extremely magic, but ""I Am Extremely Magic"" is one of the seven ""Charlie and Lola"" stories featured on this DVD. And after watching all of these episodes, you and/or your kids might feel that the show is extremely magic too.

The title episode for this DVD is ""How Many More Minutes Until Christmas?"" It's a double-length story in which Charlie & Lola receive an Advent calendar for Christmas. They excitedly count down the days until Christmas,  but are shocked when it appears that Christmas has disappeared from their calendar. There's a lot of great moments and funny dialogue in this one and it conveys the magic of the holidays quite nicely. Oh, and the theme music in this episode has a holiday sound to it.

My favorite and my best story on this DVD though is ""I Completely Know About Guinea Pigs"" as I own a guinea pig myself. The guinea pig in this story is very cute and there's a funny surprise ending.

Other stories on this DVD are ""Charlie is Broken!,"" ""I Spy with My Little Eyes,"" ""I Am Really, Really, Really Concentrating"" and ""I Really Wonder What Plant I'm Growing."" The DVD also includes subtitles, as well as two bonus outtakes and the sweet ""It's Snowing"" video montage.",1194134400,32,1227,4.614678899082569

2890949,5,B000SULWL8,"We added this to our growing collection of Charlie & Lola dvd's (there are now 10 or more in the series) and this one does not disappoint.
The books are a nice compliment; in fact, our youngest daughter read one of these books in front of her class and the teacher was very impressed with the intonation & voice (much of which she copied from the videos) so they do a good job of providing a positive example to children of the type of voice inflection that should be used when reading. (All of the video segments are actually books in the C & L series).",1290729600,,554,4.235849056603773

2890951,5,B000SULWL8,"My stamp of approval is placed on Vol 1-6 of Charlie and Lola.  I've seen later episodes and they don't have the same feel.  The more recent episodes remind me of daytime disney shows... bland.

The Christmas episode is a delight.  My wife, son, and I adore these two children and the adventures they share.  Charlie is such a good older brother and Lola has the most unique and fun personality.",1278460800,2,395,4.507042253521127

2890957,5,B000SULWL8,"I bought this and several other Charlie and Lola videos for my 3-1/2 year old daughter.  The title episode is adorable; the music and graphics are delightful.  My daughter ""absolutely completely"" loves them all so much so that she has committed several episodes to memory, down to the English accent.  I even catch myself watching these videos over and over with her because they really are so well done.  I never liked cartoons when I was growing up - probably because the choices included Tom and Jerry and Bugs Bunny and the like.  The characters really are not nice to each other.  By contrast, Charlie and Lola are so sweet to each other without being syrupy.  I think the videos teach great lessons about respect for one another.  I highly recommend this particular video and the whole series.  Hard to pick just one favorite.",1239235200,6,832,4.722222222222222

2890960,4,B000SULWL8,"Since daughter was 6 1/2 she's enjoyed vol. 1-8 Charlie & Lola.  She's now turning 9-that's value! Educational, family-friendly entertainment that actually engages a child ALL DAY. Lovable, intelligent characters with some knowledge of right and wrong.  I like how they work through conflicts/problems. This shouldn't foster bad habits/language/attitudes. Pretty long running time, colorful and theme music not annoying. Glad they have some diversity, with Lola's African-American best friend.

Could be more educational as long as it doesn't compromise the fun.",1231891200,,562,5.91358024691358
8206909,5,B000SULWL8,These are such sweet DVDs.  My 15 year old daughter still loves Charlie and Lola and so we knew we had to buy them for a little 5 year old acquaintance.  They have a message as well as just being so cute that they melt your heart.  I hope this series is available for years to come.

8206918,5,B000SULWL8,"My 3 year-old loves the stories of Charlie and Lola. The programs are in short segments (11 minutes each), and they always feature the interplay between the older boy, Charlie, and his little sister, Lola. It is a nice spin on childrens' TV to see a show where the feelings of other children and the guidance of an older sibling are used as devices to demonstrate appropriate behavior rather than the dcommands of parents and adults.

This disk is simply presented with a case and one disc, but it contains a good number of stories, and they all played well in my DVD and Blu-Ray player.

I recommend both the show and this disc very highly.",1432080000,,641,4.517241379310345
