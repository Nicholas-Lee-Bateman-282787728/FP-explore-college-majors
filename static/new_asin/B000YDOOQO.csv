3027577,2,B000YDOOQO,"People seem to either love or hate ""Great World of Sound."" Some people respond to the part traditional film, part mockumentary format of the movie.

I admit that the premise is wonderful--two guys who need jobs get wrapped up working as ""producers"" for a record label called Great World of Sound. They audition people looking to be discovered and then require money as the artist's financial commitment. They don't deliver anything other than a crappy recording session; in essence, they swindle unsuspecting artists into giving away their money.

It's a sad yet interesting premise, and its interest is compounded by the fact that the artists auditioning are real people coming in to make it big. They don't appear to know that it's a movie. They actually think they're auditioning for a record label. And then the guys hit them up for money.

As a movie, however, Great World of Sound falls flat. Frankly, it's boring. The actors are good, and the premise is good, but the film would have been a lot better had it been a completely scripted film and did not involve the non-actors. Those parts are simply boring. Even the rest of the movie was slow, but it still had humorous parts.

I hesitate to call this a comedy, though, for I don't remember laughing at all. As a version of American Idol, it works, but it really doesn't critique the American Idol culture. Sure, everyone wants to be a star, even when they're not that good. Maybe they're even willing to pay for it. But don't we already know that from watching American Idol?",1208822400,4,1534,4.712686567164179
3027578,5,B000YDOOQO,"I laughed throughout this entire movie. Some of its subtle humor, and I think rewatching it will make it even funnier. There's stuff I'm sure I didn't catch the first time around. And Pat Healy and Kene Holliday definitely need to be paired up again in another movie. If not a sequel, then something. Although I'm game for a sequel, I'll watch Martin work any job. Make him a record exec (ah-ha, promotion) in charge of cleaning up music piracy (doh, demotion) .",1206230400,2,462,4.578313253012048

3027582,1,B000YDOOQO,"This movie was glacially slow, with forced dialogue, and almost nonexistent humor. Without giving away the ending, let's just say there isn't any character development.

3027583,5,B000YDOOQO,"Maybe it's just that I spent years in the music business but I found this to be one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen in years. Where did they get all these musical acts? Absolutely authentic and amazing. Nobody seemed like they were acting. Was much of the movie improvised? I don't know.

3027584,5,B000YDOOQO,"Up until now, Craig Zobel was known for just one thing: being one of the writers of the children's book that would eventually spawn Homestar Runner, the wildly successful Internet cartoon series. But you won't find any of the site's obtuse humor and pop-culture references in his directorial debut, ""Great World of Sound."" Instead, you'll find a subtly nuanced drama/mockumentary hybrid about the trials and tribulations of a pair of talent scouts working for a record label that may be less than trustworthy. Kene Holliday delivers a wonderful performance that would've been Oscar worthy had the film received more exposure. Pat Healy does a terrific job as well, and the banter between the two characters is very well-written.

If you're expecting a laugh-out-loud comedy a la ""Office Space,"" look elsewhere. If you want a satirical look at the repercussions of living in a vast wasteland of ""American Idol"" wannabes, then ""Great World of Sound"" is highly recommended.",1202774400,11,970,5.178343949044586

8232304,5,B000YDOOQO,"Great deception of trained con men who were scammed into thinking they were going to be record producers.

Very sad because some of the prey were giving their last dollars for stardom which wasn't going to happen, performances were great throughout.",1455235200,,249,5.073170731707317
8232305,4,B000YDOOQO,"I liked it.  The 'auditions' of the amateur groups are priceless, so realistic it is hard very hard for me to believe they were staged.  Kene Holliday's performance is genius. He is absolutely convincing, it is hard to believe he is acting, but he is!  The concept: a couple of con artists recruit others to carry out their trickery and, of those, one pair succeeds.  One partner is naive yet, when he needs to be, ruthless, while the other partner is perhaps more ruthless and charismatically street smart.  They each provide, finally, two or three small doses of humanity in an otherwise very bitter brew of deception.  The concept is completely believable.  The only reason I don't give this movie five stars is because of the ending -- it is inescapable, you see it coming and there can be no alternative -- but, for me, it was such a downer, all too believable finally.",1420588800,,874,4.636363636363637

8232308,4,B000YDOOQO,This movie was a great portrayal of the under lining story of what a lot of people don't know because their eyes are so green for wealth in fame of a dream that should not be deferred. We see a cycle of the inside of scamming producers that birth a new version of scam artist and someone that is truly there to help the artist but see saw on the edge of wanting to be helpful and not harmful. This was just a great depiction.,1359590400,,425,4.011764705882353
8232309,4,B000YDOOQO,"I wouldn't call this movie funny, at all. However, it does make you wonder how far you would go to ""help"" people achieve their dreams. It's a bit unbelievable that the main character did not realize he was ripping people off from the beginning. I'm sure the writers felt his good intentions blinded him to the obvious. Kene Holliday was amazing and, as others have noted, gave what should have been an Oscar worthy performance. I learned through other reviews that the auditions were real and I almost believed Kene was a real salesman too. Also, very noteworthy was the too short scenes with Tricia Paoluccio: I think they got it wrong in casting and should have had her play the main character's girlfriend. Perhaps her incredible voice convinced them otherwise. This movie is not for everyone, but provides an interesting and real look at how vulnerable people can be when pursuing their dreams.",1348444800,,898,4.837662337662338
8232310,4,B000YDOOQO,"In a word, this movie is very authentic.  The audition scenes were performed by real people (not actors) without knowing it was actually a film shoot.  Hidden cameras recorded the interactions between the lead actors and the unsuspecting musicians.  What a great idea, and the end result is thought-provoking and worthy of all the praise this film has gotten.  This is particularly going feel impactful for people interested in music and/or sales.  My highest recommendation, and I would give it 4.5 stars if that was an option.",1341446400,,528,5.022988505747127
8232311,1,B000YDOOQO,"I cannot imagine who would find this delightful. Watching layers of losers try to take advantage of another group of losers was not fun, it was disheartening. I felt sad when it was done. If I was supposed to laugh at the inept and delusional musicians, I sure couldn't. They were mostly well-meaning and earnest people, sometimes overbearing but generally just young and not wanting to wait tables for their whole lives.

No need for a long review. I felt soiled at the conclusion of this film. Not amused. Not entertained. Not informed. Just slightly bored and overwhelmed with pity for those vultures who prey on their weak and needy neighbors.",1323993600,,647,4.828828828828829
8232312,4,B000YDOOQO,"I really don`t get how some people considered this movie ""hilarious"". Maybe the first 10 minutes have funny spots, but after that don`t wait for laughs - unless you`re laughing at other people`s sadness.

A grim movie, quiet and that develops slowly and smoothly, making little things seem so important and sometimes devastating - as they are in life, I guess.

I don`t see this as a movie about ""the music industry"" either. it`s so much more than that. They could have written it to take place anywhere that it wouldn`t make that much of a difference (but probably would weaken it a little). To me it's about life, how people have hopes, and how others take advantage of that in so many ways.

As I said, a sad movie, but moving, subtle and beautiful.",1256860800,4,752,4.555555555555555
8232313,1,B000YDOOQO,"I have no idea what the second half of this ""film"" is like and I don't care.  The first half was so boring that I decided to use it as a sleeping tool.  ~ Worked like a dream. :)",1215129600,,178,3.5384615384615383
