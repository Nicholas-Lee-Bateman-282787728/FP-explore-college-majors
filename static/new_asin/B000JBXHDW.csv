2668397,1,B000JBXHDW,"I was in love with the Old ECW but not the WWE Verison. This is what vince wanted to do with ECW back in the 1990's. The Card was Horriable the only Good Thing about it is that Lashley won the ECW championship, The Hardy's and MNM had a great match but it was the lowest point for ECW if you get a good deal meaning $5.00 or less then buy it but this ppv was Horriable",1179964800,,368,3.792207792207792
2668398,3,B000JBXHDW,"I think quite a few people, (myself included), felt like they got ripped off because Sabu was inexplicably pulled from the main event DURING the ppv.  They should've filled the slot with Sandman or Dreamer.  Hardcore Holly is a walking contradiction to the ECW style.

Hardyz vs. MNM

This was billed as ""one night only"" but we all know better than that.  A really great match.  A rarity in today's tag team world.  All 4 men are pretty impressive here and are given so much time because of the ppv's shortcomings.  A lot of technical wrestling and high flying and false finishes really get the juices flowing.  The only true dream tag team match.

Balls Mahoney vs. Matt Striker

I'm not sure why so many people called this a bad match.  It's short and to the point.  Striker is a great heel and Balls showed off some real wrestling.  I thought it was good for what it was.

Eiljah Burke & Sylvester Turkay vs. F.B.I

Okay, so here is the first real bomb of the ppv.  Poor FBI.  They are great wrestlers and once upon a time were very popular.  Not they're reduced to doormats.

Tommy Dreamer vs. Daivari

This is bad because of the decision to put Daivari over.  Otherwise it's decent enough action and won't put you to sleep.

Mike Knox & Kelly Kelly vs. Kevin Thorn & Ariel

Sorry, heel vs. heel, no thanks.  Kelly Kelly for a stage name is even worse.  Total dud in every sense of the word.

Extreme Elimination Chamber for the ECW World Championship

Big Show vs. CM Punk vs. Test vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Bobby Lashley vs. RVD

The first problem is that this wasn't extreme.  It was booked poorly.  I still found it entertaining though and was pleased with the outcome.  It's not the best EC match but not boring.  Test even has a great spot in this.",1175558400,,1755,4.418238993710692
2668399,2,B000JBXHDW,"Between 1997-2001, if you would have told any wrestling fan on the planet that a PPV with the initials ""ECW"" attached to it would result in being one of the worst PPV's of all time, we would have thought you were nuts.  Even after the One Night Stand PPV's, most people would have still thought you were nuts but man how times have changed.

Normally on my PPV reviews, I'll review match by match but I'm not going to waste my time here & I'll get straight to the point.  I gave this DVD 2 stars for 2 reasons.  One is the crowd interaction because this had the crowd reaction that Vince was scared of (which is why this PPV was moved away from the Hammerstein Ballroom).  This was a crowd that wasn't going to take any crap & let WWE know about it and that's the only reason I wasn't skipping through every match past the opening tag.  You would tell that from their reaction to when they replaced Sabu with Hardcore Holly, or when the two most popular stars on the ECW brand were the first two eliminated from the chamber match...even to the point to where they started to chant ""TNA! TNA! TNA!"" during a match (which isn't edited out on the DVD) which reminded me of when the fans chanted ""ECW! ECW! ECW!"" during the King Of The Ring PPV in '95.

The other was the opening match between MNM & The Hardys.  This was the type of tag team match that you don't get in WWE anymore..they were given alot of time to go out there & tell a story and give us a match that will be talked about for months without having to crash through a table or jump off a ladder.  WWE doesn't care about their tag teams anymore so to see a tag team match like this is a blessing for those fans who actually value tag team wrestling from as recent as London & Kendrick, MNM, Team 3D/Dudley Boyz, and the Hardys to teams of the past like the Steiner Brothers, Road Warriors/Legion Of Doom, and the Hart Foundation.

Besides these two points, this show was a 3 hour edition of Shotgun Saturday Night in which it was dry & heavily one-sided, all these matches were thrown together at the last minute, they did a last minute bait & switch on the main event, the PPV ended over a half hour early, and the one character who was used on all the poster & promos for the event (Sandman) only made a cameo appearence at the end of a match.

The DVD extras include post-Chamber match comments from all the participants along with the Big Show's final match against Lashley from ECW on Sci-Fi.  I only suggest you rent this DVD just to check out the Hardys/MNM match and also to amuse yourself at how the crowd just completely turns on this entire show.  Besides that, this will go down as one of the worst in wrestling history next to Legends Of Wrestling, nWo Souled Out, Starrcade '94, and the '04 Great American Bash.",1172275200,8,2787,4.2958015267175576

December 3, 2006
James Brown Arena
Augusta, Georgia

Hardy Boyz V. MNM
Everyone is saying that this match stole to show. Umm...no. This match was a little above average in my book. Both teams were botching spots and the match was why too long for me. Even though it had to be long. This match is NOT as good as everyone says it is. The Hardyz win. ***

Balls Mahoney V. Matt Striker
horrible match. Striker gets in all the offense and Balls gets two moves in and wins. 1/4* only because Striker worked on Ball's arm for most of the match so there was some psychology to it.

Elijah Burke & Sylverster Terkay V. The FBI
another horrible match. nothing really noteworthly here. Burke & Terkay win. 1/2*

Tommy Dreamer V. Daivari
just horrible. Are you seeing the theme here? Better than the last two matches but again, nothing worth talking about. Daivari wins. 3/4* Notice all the ECW originals are losing every match except Balls who got no offense in.

Mike Knox & Kelly Kelly V. kevin Thorn & Ariel
again, I got nothing to say about this match except Ariel is hot. What, I like a little meat on my women. Key words a little. Anyways, Thorn & Ariel win because Knox turns on Kelly. *

Extreme Elimination Chamber for the ECW CHampionship:
Big Show (Champion) V. RVD V. CM Punk V. Test V. Bobby Lashley V. Hardcore Holly
Not as bad as everyone thinks it is but it's one of the worst elimination chamber matches. Solid action from RVD & CM Punk and the rest is just decent. Lashley wins the title. ***1/2

Overall, the worst WWE Produced show every. No really it is. The buyrates were around the 90,000 mark, making it the lowest in the histroy of the WWE. However, everyone is calling this ""December To Disappoint"" I am going to be very harsh here but...WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING??????? it's not like this was a very loaded card. There were only two macthes named to the card with six days left on the PPV. So you know that they weren't going to go 3 hours. This was a one match show and very one match show I have every seen sucked. I agree that this PPV was the worst ever, however, you don't have to be pissed off that you ordered it expecting WrestleMania and got WCW Uncensored. That's your fault for not knowing that this card sucked. I didn't order it because I know it would be horrible. So if you want to piss and moan, go ahead. Hell, I was surprised that it got 90,000 buys. The WWE should be happy that people were that stupid.",1171324800,13,2463,4.364628820960698

They had about 3 good matches, all took place after an intermission. This PPV is like a Sci Fi show and should have not even taking place. Ive seen Lashley wrestle live and the guy stinks; He's a modern day mix of Ultimate Warrior and Ahmed Johnson. ECW is getting a little better, but not that impressive. Taking stars like Sandman, Balls Mahoney, and Tommy Dreamer, making them whipping boys, isn't a great idea. ECW should just be canceled",1168214400,4,620,4.3076923076923075

If anybody remembers WCW PPV's towards the end, this is better than that. This DVD is worth buying if you are a loyal fan of ECW.

The EMC was a joke how do you let CM Punk and RVD get eliminated and let Lashley of all people win the title??? FBI jobs out to a team noone even heard of. The only match that was worth a damn was the Hardy vs MNM. Sabu getting replaced with Hardcore Holly was horsecrap. I think its time everyone boycotts WWE. Seriously this crap they are putting on tv week after week. Is getting really tired. Its seriously a joke anymore. Vince done all of this on purpose. Brought back ECW so he can kill it. If you want to watch a quality promotion. Watch Ring of Honor you will get your moneys worth. All and all avoid this PPV at all cost.

2668453,1,B000JBXHDW,"Matches

1. Kevin Thorn & Ariel def. Mike Knox & Kelly Kelly

  Pretty much anything with Mike Knox is a worthless, pointless waste of time. Sad to see that the Vampire character is still around. I'm guessing it's only because WWE likes keeping the large chested Ariel on TV.

2. Elijah Burke & Sylvester Terkay def. F.B.I

  So these ECW newcomers take on a couple ECW old-schoolers. Nothing special here. This is not a ppv caliber match. Filler basically.

3. Balls Mahoney def. Matt Striker

  Balls, a lifetime ECW Mid-carder takes on Matt Striker, evil teacher and poor heel. Balls was always fun to watch and his matches were usually pretty decent. It's just hard to care when he's wrestling a jobber like Matt Striker.

4. Daivari def. Tommy Dreamer

  Sandman has the night off. Him and Dreamer could have brought some legitimacy to this ppv by having a good old school ECW match. Instead they give us Dreamer vs. Daivari. Dreamer takes a brutal bump near the entrance way from the Great Khali. Khali has no business in a ring. It's sad to see Tommy still in ECW. I guess he stuck with it through it's dying days in 2001. Now he'll stay with it as it sinks down to being the worst wrestling show on television (Behind RAW, Impact, and Smackdown)

5. The Hardys def. MNM

  A decent tag match. Weird how neither team has ever had anything to do with ECW. I guess when they don't develop their roster, they have to bring in Raw and Smackdown guys to fill out the ppv card. No really amazing bumps or excitement.

6. The Extreme Elimination Chamber Main Event

  Sabu is mysteriously taken out of the match. Not sure what that's about but I'm not happy. They replace him with Bob ""hardcore"" Holly. Big Show is the champ going into this match and he takes on Holly, Lashley, CM Punk, RVD, and Test. RVD and CM Punk seem to get the biggest reaction from the small crowd. The match has a lot of weapons and a couple big spots. It's in no way worth the price of the dvd. The previous elimination chamber matches were all better than this. Big Show loses the title to Lashley after a very weak looking spear.

This ppv takes place in Georgia of all places, so the hostile, northeastern crowd is taken out of the picture.

From top to bottom, this ppv is hard to watch. I am not surprised to hear that Paul Heyman is now done with this brand and with WWE. I would expect that RVD, Sabu and Sandman will pack their bags pretty soon too. They can let the new breed blue chippers like Matt Striker, Mike Knox, and Kevin Thorn carry the torch of ECW. CM Punk, having talent, will likely be moved to Raw or Smackdown.

The ECW One Night Stand ppvs are vastly superior to this junk. Buy those and I guarantee that you'll have a fun time watching them. This will just bore and depress you. If you're a fan of the old ECW, do not even consider watching this. It's the same name but a completely different product.",1165363200,9,2904,4.389513108614232

8149719,1,B000JBXHDW,"I finally bought this ppv to complete my 2006 wwe collection. I heard this was the worst event and this led to Paul Heyman leaving WWE as WWE had destroyed his baby in ECW. Fans were chanting TNA and booing. I hated most of this ppv and I do think WWE could have given this ECW a better roster and let Paul Heyman have full creative control. It seems WWE just wanted to see if they could make money off The 'ECW' Brand without actually giving ECW Fans 'ECW'. I liked the main event. Don't get me wrong I was a ECW fan and It was horrific what Vince did to ECW including making himself ECW champion he stole all their concepts might as well steal their belt too.

  The Hardys vs MnM was a decent contest. I think these wrestlers should have been used in the card differently but this wasn't a bad match.

  Matt Striker vs Balls Mahoney this was a decent match because of Balls. Matt Striker is an announcer not a wrestler. Striker was a very bad wrestler that shouldn't have been put on The ECW roster if you are trying to kickstart this thing.

  Burker and Terkay vs FBI I enjoyed this match it was great to see FBI again. Burke was a pretty good wrestler but like Striker ended up better served as an announcer. Burke was a good guy to put in ECW roster he had promise.

  Tommy Dreamer vs Davari. Once again awful match but was saved by Dreamer for me. Davari is another terrible wrestler not deserving of a spot in The ECW roster if they are trying to make ECW a viable brand. Davari winning was a slap in the face to The ECW Wrestling fan and was turning this brand into a choke.

  Mixed Tag Team Match- Mike Knox and Kelly Kelly vs. Kevin Thorn and Ariel I love Kelly Kelly but there was no saving this match. We had some nice divas but two terrible wrestlers that didn't deserve to be on The ECW Roster.

  Extreme Elimination Chamber Match- Big Show vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Test vs. CM Punk vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Rob Van Dam Heyman came out and was honest to the crowd hinting at this was WWE's version and recreation of ECW. If Heyman had control this disater of an event would have been a great PPV. This match was awesome and saved the event for me. I think RVD should have won. But Lashley winning was great too. I am a Lashley fan and I saw him as a star in the making. ECW helped get him a push to a great main event against John Cena. Lashley was one great thing to come out of this doomed experiment.

  This does go down as the worst ppv in history. There are no words to describe how disappointing it was. Do yourself a favor buy an old ECW PPV from 1995 off RF Video when they had the best wrestlers before WCW and WWE stole them all. I'd say pass on this one for sure but if curious take a chance on it if its cheap.",1461369600,,2738,4.11864406779661
8149720,5,B000JBXHDW,"The only reason I bought this is because I have other ECW titles and wanted to add it to the collection.

I don't recommend this PPV unless you simply want to own it.",1360022400,,318,3.9076923076923076
8149721,2,B000JBXHDW,I only bought this on DVD because I actually went to the event and I try to buy all of the PPV's I go to on DVD. I would not recommend anyone else buying it however because it is easily the most disappointing wrestling event I have ever been to.,1359244800,,245,3.92
8149722,2,B000JBXHDW,"After WWE re-launched ECW on Sci-Fi in June of '06 it was natural the idea would come up to give the brand its own PPV. However it should've just stayed as an idea as outside of two matches this was easily one of the worst PPV events WWE ever put on. The two advertised matches were good, but the rest of the card was average to terrible and not very well booked.

-Tag Team Match, MNM vs. The Hardy's: This was one of the two advertised matches, it was billed as One Night Only and it was a very well done tag match. Reminded me of tag team wrestling of old as both teams were allowed the time to work their opponents over and they all told a good story. There's the usual quick double teaming from the Hardy's, MNM use dirty tactics to gain the advantage and work both Hardy's over seperately cutting off the ring. The match is just great storytelling so watch and enjoy. Matt hits a double neckbreaker on both MNM, then Jeff hits a Swaton and covers Nitro to win the match. Great opening contest. 10/10.

-Striker's Rules Match, Matt Striker vs. Balls Mahoney: In a pre-match promo Striker says he is enforcing his rules to in no certain terms assure he wins. Its more wrestling than anything as Balls was actually a high school amateur wrestler so he had a wrestling background. Its not too good though, the gimmick of Striker's Rules really brings it down, Balls uses an arm bar, but soon after goes into the ringpost and Matt works over his arm and shoulder, but Balls won't stay down. Nice rolling arm bar by Striker, but doesn't get a tap out, Balls comes back hitting jabs and hits the Nutcracker Suite and covers for 3. 3/10.

-Sabu is found laid out cold and it looks like he won't compete in tonights main event, much to the crowds dismay.

-Tag Team Match, Elijah Burke & Sylvester Terkay vs. The FBI w/Trinity: Well Burke and Terkay were an odd pair, with a mix of size and quickness, FBI are a good team and this isn't horrible, but there's not much chemistry between these two teams. There's some good quick tags from the FBI, with some arm drags by Guido, then Terkay comes in and impressively catches Guido and throws him over the top onto Tony. The FBI dropkick Terkay out of the ring, but Tony gets a huge punch from Terkay then hit with a facebuster and Burke covers for the win. 4/10.

-Tommy Dreamer vs. Davari w/The Great Khali: Dreamer had issues with both Davari & Khali in the weeks prior, Davari gets tossed around by Tommy, with some dirty tactics by Davari, who gets helped to the ring by Khali, who pulls the ring rope down but the ref sees it and ejects the giant from ringside. Tommy gets worked over as Davari targets his neck with a sleeper hold, Dreamer comes back hits the Tree of Woe dropkick but soon after gets rolled up for the win. 3/10. The aftermath saw Dreamer chases Davari but Khali comes out with Tommy in hand and chokeslams him onto the stage.

-Paul Heyman talks to Hardcore Holly about replacing Sabu in the main event, which was met with a chorus of boos.

-Mixed Tag Team Match, Mike Knox & Kelly Kelly vs. Kevin Thorn & Ariel: Easily the worst match of the night, Knox and Thorn do well I guess, Kelly and Ariel are just eye candy. Kelly & Knox had issues due to Kelly having eyes for CM Punk in the weeks prior but early on they seemed to be on the backburner as Mike seemed to want to make sure his team won. Once Kelly was in the ring and she was beaten up by Ariel, Kelly and went to tag Knox, he dropped down leaving his girlfriend to fend for herself. Soon after Ariel hit an modified STO and covered her for the win. 1/10. Side note: At least Ariel and Kelly looked good, but this match was horrible. But at least the aftermath was nice with the Sandman making an appearance and caning Thorn a lot, much to the crowds delight.

-There's a pre-match promo from Paul Heyman where he talks up the chamber and the level of violence the crowd will see in the main event chamber match and also how the original ECW is dead and that the Big Show will lead the charge of the new ECW.

-Extreme Elimination Chamber Match for the ECW Championship, Big Show (Champion) vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Test vs. CM Punk vs. Rob Van Dam vs. Hardcore Holly: Due to the chamber gimmick its decent for this card, but as far as other chamber matches go its the least of them. Four men are in separate pods each with a weapon and RVD and Holly start out for the first 5 minutes, Holly hits a nice suplex from the chamber floor into the ring. Punk is out next and uses his weapon a chair then takes it to both guys, but gets the chair back to the face. RVD gets bloodied and sent face first into a chair in the turnbuckle, then Test is out next and uses his crowbar on both Punk and RVD. Punk gets hit with the frog splash from RVD and Punk is gone, Test nails a boot to Holly but the ref waves him off after a 2 count and he gets Holly out of the chamber (guess he was injured before).

Test does hit an impressive elbow from the top of a pod and RVD is gone, now Test has a bit to rest before Lashley is next but Heyman's security prevents Bobby from coming out so he uses the end of his table to poke a hole in the chains of the pod roof then hits a big clothesline from the top to the ring. Lashley sends Test into the wall of a pod then works him over and hits a spear and Test is gone, its down to Show and Lashley. Show brings in his barbwire bat and they have a decent match, Show goes into the pod wall but Lashley gets thrown into the ring and beaten up. Bobby hits a spear out of nowhere and covers Show to win the title. 6/10.

Extras include interviews with the chamber participants

-12/5/06, ECW, ECW Championship Match, Bobby Lashley (Champion) vs. The Big Show: Two nights after the PPV, we have this re-match where they both battle pretty well, Show knocks around Bobby and Lashely comes back hitting some impressive power moves including a big power slam for the win as Bobby retains. 6/10.

The event itself wouldn't have been so bad if it was a 3 hour TV taping and not a PPV that people paid big money for. The opening and closing events are the only ones worth getting this for, but it needs to be a very cheap price.",1318204800,,6172,4.233644859813084
8149723,1,B000JBXHDW,"It pains me to include the ECW initials in the title, but that's what it was billed as. We all know better though.

Ya know, because only announcing 2 matches before the show and holding 3 PPV events almost 3 weeks in a row didn't have anything to do with it, right? Anyway, and this may surprise you, it wasn't the worst show I've ever seen. Sure, if I ordered it on PPV and it ended 40 minutes early, I'd be furious. But for a 2 dollar DVD, it's not the worst.

1. The Hardys vs. MNM= This and the main event were the only two matches announced, and this and the main event were the only two matches that really delivered anything. This was a great tag match, they gave these guys a whole lot of time to do their thing and they delivered. Of course, they had to give them plenty of time to just fill out PPV time. 4 out of 5.

2. Striker's Rules match- Matt Striker vs. Balls Mahoney= Striker's Rules is just a bunch of mundane things that would make it easier for Striker to win. This wasn't very good. I appreciate the ring psychology and the selling by Balls, but this could've been so much better. Not the worst match on the card, but a disappointment. 1 out of 5.

3. Elijah Burke and Sylvester Terkay vs. The FBI= This was...just ok. Nothing terrible here, nothing really good. It certainly isn't as bad as any of the other undercard matches that were added, but don't expect anything great. Little Guido with the hat on is great though. 2 out of 5.

4. Tommy Dreamer vs. Daivari= Terrible ending, who booked this one? Anyway, this was like a match you'd see on free TV, or maybe even a dark match before the show. Not much fun, not awful, but not worth it. 1 out of 5.

5. Mixed Tag Team Match- Mike Knox and Kelly Kelly vs. Kevin Thorn and Ariel= Oh jeez. I was a huge fan of Kevin Thorn's gimmick, but this was awful. Especially with the women in there. Nice to The Sandman at the end, wish he was in a legitimate match up though. 1 out of 5.

6. Extreme Elimination Chamber Match- Big Show vs. Bobby Lashley vs. Test vs. CM Punk vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Rob Van Dam= Heyman cut a spectacular promo before the match, because as I see it, it was clearly a subtle message from Heyman to the fans that ECW was dead and buried and that this was now the WWE's version of ECW. He just said it in character. Sabu was originally supposed to be in this match, but for whatever reason was replaces by Hardcore Holly. Each pod had a weapon, and the weapons were a steel chair, a table, a crowbar and a barbed wire baseball bat. Of course, they never actually used the barbed wire baseball bat as a weapon. The thing about this match is that it's basically two matches. When the first 4 guys were in there, it was a great match that's very fun to watch. When Lashley and Big Show were in, this was a painful bore. Still, this is far and away better than almost every match on the card. 4 out of 5.

Not a good show, and if I paid $40 for it, I'd hate it. But for $2, you won't be breaking the bank to see 2 good matches.",1281916800,,3218,4.1392
8149724,1,B000JBXHDW,"This event was just a bad as The 1997 film:Lost In Space. The ONLY GOOD match on the whole card was The Hardly Boys vs. MNM.The ""Extreme"" Elimination Chamber was no better then TNA's Reverse Battle Royal of that same year(2006).The rest looked like they were putted in at the last minute. I rather watch WCW Greed it is that awful. I give this event a 1 out of 10.",1276819200,,364,4.214285714285714
8149725,2,B000JBXHDW,"ECW's last brand-only PPV is such an easy target.  I mean, it's like the guy who walks into a public place, and doesn't realize his buttcrack is showing.  Yet, I've decided to not give this a one-star rating.  But......<cue dramatic music>......how can that be?  Well, read the rest of my review, and the suspense is short-lived:

1) MNM v. The Hardys
---This fantastic opener is the only reason I'm giving DECEMBER TO DISMEMBER more than a 1-star rating.  This 20-minute showcase between two outstanding teams is a Match-of-the-Year candidate.  This was the only advertised match along with the main event, and hopefully ECW kept a few more fans with this tag team clinic.  I was lukewarm to their ROYAL RUMBLE 2007 rematch, but this truly is the real deal.  Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time, huh?
""9.0 / 10""

----------------------------------------

2) Striker's Rules
Matt Striker v. Balls Mahoney
---Okay, the praise stops right here.  Ever since I saw Striker's debut in the Kurt Angle Invitational, I was really hoping this guy would have a better heel push.  I mean, he's so good as ticking off the crowd, and he's got some in-ring talent.  It's too bad we didn't get to see more, not to mention on this PPV.  Mahoney was an ECW Original for a reason, but his ECW career (if he still has one) has been boring at best.  The Striker's Rules stipulations is basically Striker coming up with ridiculous rules to help him win the match.  Well, it amounted to 5 minutes of boredom.  Enough talk, just skip this one.
""3.0 / 10""

----------------------------------------

3) The FBI v. Sylvester Terkay & Elijah Burke
---This tag team contest actually shows signs of being better than it turned out to be.  I thought the Terkay/Burke combo had a lot of potential.  Thankfully, Burke (until recently) has proven to be a go-to guy for ECW's Tuesday broadcasts.  Everybody else, not so much.  As for the match itself, it's not terrible, but goes on for way too long and rarely excites the crowd.  I think my wishful thinking might've inflated my score, but here it is.
""5.5 / 10""

----------------------------------------

4) Tommy Dreamer v. Daivari
---This was part of an abandoned angle between Dreamer and The Great Khali.  Frankly, these two guys mesh much better, if you can call ""mediocre"" much better.  This one - like most matches on this PPV - just doesn't get off the ground.  It's not that Dreamer & Daivari can't do good work; the fact of the matter is they just didn't get it together before the finish.  At least they're par for the course.
""4.5 / 10""

----------------------------------------

5) Kevin Thorn & Ariel v. Mike Knox & Kelly Kelly
---Maybe I'm being too nice on this PPV, but again I see missed potential.  Thorn was a bit rough around the edges, but he and Ariel were an appealing couple, and were onto something with their gothic vampirism gimmick.  Knox & Kelly Kelly were stuck with a jealous-boyfriend-angle, which unfortunately had run its course at this point.  The match itself is unremarkable, especially when Ariel & Kelly mix it up.  Sorry ladies, but in December 2006, your in-ring skills weren't cutting it.  As for Knox & Thorn, neither their wrestling nor their characters engaged me.  I can stomach pointless exhibition matches, but if you don't have character or physicality, you've only wasted my time.  My goodness, have I given a whole paragraph to each match on this PPV so far?  Better move on.
""4.5 / 10""

----------------------------------------

6) Extreme Elimination Chamber Match - ECW World Title
Big Show (champion) v. Test v. CM Punk v.
Bobby Lashley v. Rob Van Dam v. Hardcore Holly
---In case you didn't know, each chamber pod had a weapon inside, and Sabu was inexplicably replaced with Bob Holly for the main event.  When the Georgian crowd learned this, there were ""BULLS__T!"" chants loud and clear.  What's even more confusing is how CM Punk, who entered to the hugest pop of every wrestler, got eliminated first.  Well, enough statistics, how's the match?  Contrary to popular opinion, I personally don't think this is the worst Elimination Chamber Match.  Nope, to me it's the SECOND worst.  Well, that's something, right?  The action progresses with fits and starts.  The Chamber Match isn't very brutal, and doesn't tell a compelling story at any point.  The blood is obligatory, and there are few weapons spots that don't feel stale.  Even when it's down to Lashley & Big Show, the main event feels very by-the-numbers.  To Big Show's credit, I've read he wasn't very healthy on this night, but he still competed for over 10 minutes to make Lashley look good.  But all in all, this Chamber is very memorable.  It's not terrible by any means, but won't inspire positive conversation among most fans.
""6.0 / 10""

----------------------------------------

Well, there you have it.  ECW's DECEMBER TO DISMEMBER is nothing short of a disappointment.  This isn't the worst PPV of 2006; I think the insulting SURVIVOR SERIES deserves that moniker.  It's too bad, because the MNM/Hardys opener really is an incredible display from four talented superstars.  Unless somebody offers this to you for around 5 dollars, just go to YouTube.  I don't think WWE needs to be afraid of people illegally downloading a DVD this bad, anyway.",1222732800,,5309,4.875699888017917

DECEMBER TO DISMENBER

This is the one and only pay-per-view that the revived ECW had before all three brands started competing on each pay-per-view. Regardless of what other people say I actually like this event and think it deserves more credit then it gets.

1. THE HARDY BOYS VS MNM-this was a pretty good opener to the event, it kinda reminded me of tag matches back in the day. Nothing to fancy and nothing to over the top, but enough there to keep you entertained. I don't know if I would call it match of the night but it was an entertaining match none the less. There were a few high spots and a few good exchanges between the two. While this match might be slow at times it is still highly competitive. The Hardys take this one in the end. 4/5

2. MATT STRIKER VS BALLS MAHONEY-this is a decent match and like the previous it reminds me of the old days. This is more of a traditional wrestling match due to Striker's rules but I kinda like this bout. Maybe it is because I like both of these guys I don't know but I like it, Balls takes this match and Striker's ring wear is classic. 3.5/5

Sabu is attacked behind the scenes and therefore is out of the main event.

3. ELIJAH BURKE & SYLVESTER TERKAY VS F.B.I.-this is a good match up right here, it is the old ECW verses the new. It wasn't an extremely exciting match but it was pretty entertaining. I think it was on par with the last two, these four guys put on a good show in a good back and forth battle. Burke and Terkay take the win and prove they belong in ECW.4/5

4. DAIVARI VS TOMMY DREAMER-this match featured one of my all time favorite wrestlers of all time, Tommy Dreamer. Khali gets sent to the back after he interferes in the match, which gave me high hopes for Dreamer against a really talented performer. Maybe it is my being a huge fan of Dreamer but I think this was a really good match. This was more of a technical battle more then anything. Anyway Daivari ends up winning this one by hooking Dreamer's trunks, then Dreamer takes a huge bump on the entrance ramp from Khali. 4/5

Next up we see Hardcore Holly added to the main event.

5. MIKE KNOX & KELLY KELLY VS KEVIN THORN & ARIEL-another decent match with this mixed tag team event, both of the men do well in this match and try to keep the action going. But this is one of the few instances that the women are out shining the men, both of them really make this one interesting. The pin fall that Ariel gats on Kelly Kelly is great. 3.5/5

The Sandman makes a great appearance directly after the match and canes Kevin Thorn like crazy.

6. ECW CHAMPIONSHIP-EXTREME ELIMINATION CHAMBER-BIG SHOW VS RVD VS TEST VS C.M. PUNK VS HARDCORE HOLLY VS BOBBY LASHLEY-Hardcore Holly and RVD started this unique match off and go at it from the jump. It was cool to see these two start this one off because these two had a classic match on ECW on Sci-Fi, Holly got a huge gash on his back during that match. There is a great spot between these two were RVD turns into Spiderman. C.M. Punk comes into the match next and explodes on RVD and Holly, there is a lot of great action that takes place once Punk is in there. Test comes in next and starts going to work on a bloody RVD. But RVD still manages to deliver a sick frog splash and eliminates C.M. Punk. Right after that Hardcore Holly is quickly eliminated by Test, who then goes on to eliminate RVD with a great elbow drop from the top of a pod. Lashley finds a creative way to get out of his pod when Test won't allow him to come out the door. And after Bobby tears Test apart he quickly disposes of him and waits for Big Show. After these two rip into each other Lashley wins the title and goes on to have a weird feud with Vince. 5/5

BONUS MATCH

7. ECW CHAMPIONSHIP-BOBBY LASHLEY VS BIG SHOW-this was I believe a rematch that happened at the very next ECW show after the pay-per-view. I also believe it was Big Shows last appearance for a while in the WWE, not positive though. This is one of the better matches that Bobby was in after winning the ECW title. He delivers along side Show a great one on one match, much better then I thought it would be. When I watched this live I was sure this would not be that great, but I was pleasantly surprised. Lashley keeps the belt after a hard fought battle. 5/5

This event is better then it gets credit for but it kinda sucks that this was the last ECW pay-per-view. Good post interviews.",1220832000,2,4423,4.244946492271106
8149727,1,B000JBXHDW,"Everyone knows just what the McMahons think of ECW, and how they've made the phrase ""ECW on Sci-Fi"" into more of a joke than the XFL. Ratings plummet, quality deteriorates, and the WWE FORCES Sci-Fi to pick up ECW for 2008.

Anyway, on to WWECW's first PPV! And what better way to start off than to feature a 30 minute match featuring two RAW and two Smackdown competitors?

""One Night Only""
The Hardy Boys vs MNM (not the rapper or candy)
This match went about 10-15 minutes too long in my opinion, and it only really showed in the beginning. The first half of this match was a sluggish, typical WWE brawl consisting of lazy moves, go-nowhere headlocks and submission holds, and lameness galore. By the second half, it escalated to an amazing tag team (including a use of the forbidden standing Shooting Star Press by Nitro) match, which ultimately suffered from having that boring as hell first half. This was great wrestling, but it wasn't ECW. (8/10)

Matt Striker vs Balls Mahoney
This could be a phenomenal match. Not only is Balls Mahoney a great hardcore wrestler from ECW, but he's got a legitimate wrestling background, as does Matt Striker So the WWE decides to give you perhaps the worst 7 minutes of the night, and that's really saying something. Balls gets in maybe 4-5 offensive moves in, while Striker pulls off even less actual moves, and Balls suddenly gets the pin out of nowhere. This match sucked, and the audience knew it. (0/10)

There were very LOUD and NOTICEABLE chants of ""TNA!"" from the front row, a small select group all throughout the night.

Elijah Burke and Sylvester Terkay vs F.B.I. w/ Trinity
Great to see the FBI back. And I personally loved Trinity's dress.  The match was not that horrible, but it was a bit bland. Terkay surprised me by having some wrestling skill, and Tony Mamaluke and Little Guido worked with perfect cohesion. Still, it was not reciprocated much, and the ending came out weak. (4/10)

Tommy Dreamer vs Daivari
Continuing the McMahon tradition of bombs comes this match, very poorly executed, and heralding chants of ""TNA!"". It ended horribly, involving Tommy Dreamer chasing Daivari and getting attacked by The Great Khali. The highlight of this match was one guy in the audience, who screamed ""THIS ISN'T EXTREME, IT'S ENTERTAINMENT!""  (0/10)

Mike Knox and Kelly Squared vs Kevin Thorn and Ariel
Aside from when the women did things the audience was dead, utterly dead. No one really cared about Knox or Thorn, and it showed. ""TNA!"" chants occurred. I thought Kevin Thorn did quite well against the dud that was Mike Knox, and Ariel did amazing against the even bigger dud that was Kelly Kelly. But nothing could save the match, not even Ariel's thonged rear end poking halfway out her skirt. (0/10)

""Extreme"" Elimination Match
Rob Van Dam vs The Big Show (C) vs CM Punk vs Bobby Lashley vs Test vs Sa-... Hardcore Holly?
Yeah, midway through the event, Sabu was taken out of the event, because you don't want to climax an ECW event with an ECW star and innovator in the main event. You want Hardcore Holly! A man whose charisma and skill is as dead as a Best of Al Snow collection. So now we have yet another dud in the ""EXTREEEEEEEME"" Elimination Chamber match. I thought the first ever Elimination Chamber was overrated, so I'm expecting nothing from this one.

Paul Heyman comes out, and dies inside as he spouts out his McMahon-approved script of essentially turning his back on everything ECW, claiming old ECW sucked the likes Rob Van Dam and Sabu and The Sandman are dead, and the future is in... The Big Show, Test, and Hardcore Holly.

Also, when Heyman declares that Big Show is the future of ECW, some smark in the front row screams ""YEAH, UNTIL HE RETIRES NEXT JANUARY!"" He must have been a psychic because the Big Show indeed never returned to WWE TV after December.

Match begins and the six competitors come out, starting off with Hardcore Holly and Rob Van Dam, while the other four go into chambers, with such ""extreme"" weapons as a table, a chair, a fake crowbar, and oh look, a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire! Something actually extreme.

Holly simply sucked.  Luckily, Van Dam managed to make him look good, and pulled off some of the same stuff he did in the first one. Then CM Punk came out.

I was expecting nothing, so when CM Punk went and started to rival Rob Van Dam in high flying and great wrestling, I was shocked. Then the two went at it, and I was stunned. They had phenomenal chemistry, and the makings of a great feud. But in typical WWE fashion, they completely fumble that, and put CM Punk against... Mike Knox, The Miz, and other people who suck.

Suddenly the eliminations came... CM Punk was eliminated first, and the audience was livid. People started chanting ""BULL****"" as he left. Then Test came out, and Hardcore Holly was... pinned? I'm thinking the referee must have been retarded. He didn't count a three, and Holly kicked out at three, yet still he eliminated him. Test then eliminated Van Dam, again to the anger of the crowd.

Bobby Lashley was out next, and Heyman's goonies kept him in the chamber. So the table is now out of the match as he uses it to bust out of the top of the chamber and climb out. Lashley had the makings of a good power wrestler but the booking wasn't right. His spears are weak, and he isn't given enough things to do. Test is eliminated, and we literally get a whole minute of nothing to wait until Big Show comes out.

The last five minutes of the match consist of Lashley dominating the Big Show, then pinning out of nowhere and winning. Total dud. (3/10)

Just like the first ever one, they completely over-sold the Chamber and it's ""brutality"". Even worse than the first one, as aside from the use of perfectly normal hardcore weapons, this was a normal match that happened to be surrounded by a circular cage.  And the commentators make you think they had just been in a flaming Hell in a Cell with barbed wire and broken glass with hypodermic needles full of ebola virus riddling the cage.

Total bomb. And the McMahons dare to lay the blame on Paul Heyman.",1195084800,3,6110,4.611981566820276
