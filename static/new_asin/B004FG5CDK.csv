8427811,4,B004FG5CDK,"When You Can't Breathe - I'd give this individually a 5 star review.  I purchased this directly from her aligned and well website for a reasonable price, though I can't remember the exact amount. If you're after this for the exercises, you get 5, and she guides you through them.  There is other material that you'll probably only view once, but the exercises are something you'll view many times - at least until you're confident you can replicate them correctly w/o the DVD guiding you.

Aligned and Well series - I'd give the series as a whole 3 stars, which leads to the averaged 4-star review shown above.  The series as a whole gets 3 stars because though the exercises are indeed valuable, many are repeated across the DVDs.  If you want DVDs of totally unique exercises, stick to this one and the Fix Your Feet DVD (also on her website for a reasonable price).  No exercises are replicated between those two.  If you pick up other titles, you can expect to see at least one of the exercises from one of these two DVDs repeated, sometimes more. However most of the other DVDs do have at least one or two unique exercises as well.  So, you probably wouldn't be too disappointed if you picked up one more that addresses a subject area of particular concern to you.  But, the more DVDs you get, the more you'll be frustrated with seeing the same exercises over and over again.

If I were to recommend a combo to someone, I'd recommend this DVD, Fix Your Feet, and to pick up her book ""Move Your DNA"" where you can see a variety of other exercises, as well as learn a lot about how to improve your movement patterns in daily life.  If your goal is to improve your movement patterns, I'd also recommend Gokhale's book ""8 Steps to a Pain Free Back"", since even if you don't suffer back pain, it provides many helpful suggestions regarding healthy posture and improving the foundation of your movements.  Goodman's Foundation training, which I've only viewed on Youtube, also addresses these matters, and is consistent with Bowman's and Gokhale's work, though Goodman takes it more into a fitness format.  If you do experience back pain, I have found the Melt Method and, specifically, using the Melt Method's blue foam roller, provides instant relief.  For that I got the Melt Method 3-DVD set with blue foam roller directly on Hitzman's Melt Method website.",1431129600,10,2359,4.653012048192771
