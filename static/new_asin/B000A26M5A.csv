Of course some information is interesting and will remain relatively timeless, however on a whole, a significant amount of it has little to do with motion picture technology directly. The first film, from the 1930s, is about sound effects in radio programs - it is one of the better films. Other programs, are also dated and veer well away from the core subject of this mistitled collection. One film, dealing with light and light theory, was originally produced by Chevrolet Motors and is in fact explaining sealed beam headlights.

The producers have added nothing to the material other than an apparent template dvd menu with two chapters of self promotional materials.

As a testament to the producer's quality control, the two disk set that I purchased, contains a mislabeled first disk from the second set in the series which unfortunately, I also purchased.

You may want to visit the motion picture section of the Internet Archive - archive.org - for a sampling of the type of - if not the actual - material found on these disks and save your money.

The producers should really be ashamed for the misleading title, careless project direction and poor quality control.",1242604800,3,1316,4.8097345132743365
8174984,5,B000A26M5A,"What an interesting documenary. Watching this film I learned a lot about how movies are made and how film projectors work. It was fairly basic information, because the film itself was made years and years ago, but obviously the theory of light and sound and moving pictures remains the same today. I thought the most interesting part was the explanations of  how sound was transmitted over the air. I'd like to learn more, so I may buy the second volume.",1148428800,3,454,4.675
