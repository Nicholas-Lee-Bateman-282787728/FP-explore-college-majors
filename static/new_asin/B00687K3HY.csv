8494645,3,B00687K3HY,"Tim Holt, back in the '40s, was the star of many a B-western for RKO, although you'd perhaps remember him best for what he did in The Treasure of Sierra Madre. Holt was sturdily built - what you'd call strapping - and he came across as a stand-up guy, honest and square. He often had sidekicks for comic relief and there's frequently a cowboy in his pictures who broke out in song. That was how they did it back in the day. 1940's The Fargo Kid is a trifling sagebrush yarn that follows that formula to a T. In it, Holt - or the Fargo Kid - is mistaken for the notorious gunfighter Deuce Mallory, on account of the Kid's riding into the mining town of Micaville, AZ on the outlaw's signature copper-colored sorrel. There's a $1000 reward on Deuce Mallory's head. See? Notorious.

Someone in Micaville - namely, the dastardly assayer of precious metals (Cyrus W. Kendall) - has put the hit on an old prospector who doesn't know that his mining claim hides a rich vein of gold. So, there's the Fargo Kid getting compensated $5000 for that assassination gig. The Kid takes the money even as he gets his bearings and proceeds to nose around. But it isn't long before the real Deuce Mallory (Paul Fix), mean and murderous, comes to town.

If you've got an hour or so to spare, The Fargo Kid isn't a bad time-waster. There's no depth or nuance to it. It's a straight-forward, run-of-the-mill oater, the sort they rolled out with regularity in yesteryears to rake in the quick buck. The big bad, Cyrus W. Kendall, is straight out of some stock company, and he may as well have been in the silent movies, so exaggerrated were his villainy ways. Tim Holt is a steady presence and, every now and again, he flashes this cocky, sh--eating grin that lets you know he's not taking things too serious, and, so, you shouldn't, either. There's a girl in the picture, and our hero flirts with her some, but Tim Holt always was more comfortable when he's in the company of horses and cowhands and brutes. There's a novelty to how he stashes away his $5000, although one can instantly see the future dilemma in his method. In the end, the Fargo Kid saves the day, with some help from his sidekicks: that old coot and a band of crooning musicians. He also leaves the girl hanging. Told you he was awkward around womenfolk.",1442188800,,2301,4.4892601431980905
