8072980,3,B000A2UBMA,This movie had all the hallmarks to make it great but somehow fails I think.  The story is ok but not great.  Very superficial really and not how real life is or maybe it is for some people.  As a lesbian woman I feel they miss the point and accept ordinaryness when a miracle was within their reach.  Sad movie.,1338508800,,312,4.15
8072981,5,B000A2UBMA,"Round Trip - A Feature Romantic Comedy - Film Review

 The feature length romantic comedy film, Round Trip, directed by Keith Behrle, is an interesting character based story, about three couples surviving and understanding love. Each character has a distinct personality that adds diversity to the script. Told through three intertwining storylines, the film creates parallels between their relationship troubles, making it intriguing to follow and relate them to our everyday lives.
 The production design of the film worked very well with the story line. Each of the characters personalities were visually described not only through the acting, but through this production design. Example: Glen's love/job for basketball, Darren's messy house, (which fits his chaotic life style) and Robbie's optimistic view on love as an adult, shown through his ""candle room.""
 The original music produced for the film was catchy and fun, including ""Round Trip"" by, Shoot The Moon.  Performed by Jules Levitt. The lighting was generally good, especially in the exterior scenes. The sound throughout the movie was clear, and was not overpowered by the music. The editing in the film was generally seamless and created good continuity through the entire film.
 All in all, the film is truly a story about the possibilities and struggles of love. It is about the fears and risks that falling and being in love endures. Proposing the tough questions about compatibility, distance in a relationship, and the risk of putting yourself out there, this film covers it all. Comically told through everyday dialog between three best friends, this is the film's greatest attribute.",1229731200,,1657,5.329501915708812
8072982,4,B000A2UBMA,"Keith Behrle's  ""Round Trip"" is a romantic comedy that follows three different couples, each wanting a relationship but ""aren't really ready for one"". While the production cost is low, Behrle's directorial skills, the theme of coming going and the acting of Laura Lynn are able to draw the audience into the story.
Behrle's use of close up and medium-close up shots help to create a sense of intimacy and voyeurism between the characters and the audience. The audience is able to feel engaged with the characters because they are presented this way.
Another enjoyable aspect of the film was the theme coming and going. This can be seen mainly through two characters, Yuki and Meryl, as well as the camping trip.  This aspect of the film creates a sense of excitement and fun for the audience and keeps them engaged.
The acting of Laura Lynn is an additional bright spot in this film. Her portrayal of Britney is very well done and she comes across as very believable. The scene in where she is explaining to Darren why she can no longer be with him is very well done and the conviction in her voice is very believable.
All and all Keith Behrle's  ""Round Trip"" is more than just a romantic comedy, but an endearing film of love and lost with characters you can't help but be connected to.  While the production cost is low directing, story and acting are able to keep this film enjoyable and entertaining.",1227830400,,1404,4.649193548387097
8072983,5,B000A2UBMA,"Yeah, this is a story about  n o r m a l  women-mothers providing for their kids, struggling to meet ties, as they exercised their true nature pressured with reality a world presents.

A typically-traditional ending of such an ""amoral story"" is just a way producers follow for letting their works to reach a viewer, whether two females kissing or a teen playing around (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garcon-Stupide/dp/B000EMG93Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garcon Stupide</a>).

Personally, I hardly understood how an illegal migrant happened from Ghana -according to a movie info provided on this page, because a six year old son of her had been to Nigeria, but it was so arranged, perhaps, for local reasons, while highlighting a non-Muslim background of a foreigner having found as many others non-Jewish (Muslims from around a globe inclusively) a refuge in the Jewish state.

A movie is the new dimension opening of Israel to me and, perhaps, to many non-Israelis.",1211932800,,1014,5.644736842105263

8072986,2,B000A2UBMA,"During most of the film, the main character, Nurit, doesn't smile - she hardly seems to have any personality at all.  Then she meets Mushidi who moves in with Nurit and her two children as a nanny.  Nurit and Mushidi become lovers and, finally, Nurit smiles.  She is obviously happy with Mushidi.  But then, her estranged husband finds out about the two women and threatens to take the children from Nurit.  Nurit can't give up her children so she gives up Mushidi.  Mushidi, in turn, turns herself into immigration and is deported.  Talk about depressing!  This was such a 1950s ending, and while I wasn't sure what I was expecting, a 1950s ending was no where on my horizon.",1134777600,6,676,4.621848739495798
8072987,4,B000A2UBMA,"This is a wonderful film that covers far more bases than I anticipated.

The acting is fabulous, the filming evocative, and the story an inspiring

and fresh one that keeps your eyes glued through every minute, and then

some.

Nurit (Anat Waxman) leaves her husband and takes her two children to Tel

Aviv. As a single mother working long hours as a bus driver, she needs

help

taking care of her two admirably self-sufficient children who are lost in

the world of leaving their father and adjusting to the new city. The woman

she finally hires to help her brings the most unexpected help anyone can

imagine. What unfolds is an evocative, laughter-filled love story between

a broken Israeli family and a breath-takingly phenomenal woman from Ghana.

Shining light on broken families, interracial relationships, nationality,

class, and unexpected lesbian love, ""Round Trip"" is an absolutely amazing

film. It's the whole package, guarenteed.",1132185600,12,947,5.144736842105263
