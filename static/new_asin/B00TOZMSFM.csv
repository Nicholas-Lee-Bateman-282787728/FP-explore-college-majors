8702419,5,B00TOZMSFM,"Great series.  Better quality (animation wise) than the first series while still keeping up with an awesome story line to follow.  Great show for adults and children alike who are fans of the HTTYD movies. However there is one thing I should note to fans of the first series (Riders of Berk), and that is the way they animated and rendered the scenes in this season are different.  Unlike the first series on DVD that looked sharper, this DVD set lacks that because they made objects and people in the background look out of focus and blurrier than those in the foreground hence why it might look lower quality than the others.  However, I'm pretty confident this is because of how they made the series look trying to make the scenes look more blended and not artificial looking hence why I feel that the animation quality in this is more professional looking than that in the previous one.  Also when the show was on tv or any third party site, it looks the same way so its not just because of the way they made it for DVD release.  This still might bother viewers hence why I'm mentioning it in my review.  Still a wonderful series with a fun storyline to follow.",1444694400,,1165,4.466981132075472
