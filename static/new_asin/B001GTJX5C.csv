8307035,4,B001GTJX5C,Good for people over 60.,1453507200,,24,4.0
8307036,3,B001GTJX5C,"I love Tony. Guess I just didn't expect quite this level of senior-citizen-working out, and it's not enough for me.  I'll put this one on the shelf and pull it out when I hit 65-70.  Guess I'll stick with the Power90 for now, and other things.",1450224000,,243,4.260869565217392
8307037,5,B001GTJX5C,Used this as group exercise. Everyone loved it. After we did it the first day we were a bit sore. I had one previously but lost it and wanted another one.,1416700800,,154,4.0
8307038,3,B001GTJX5C,I am 65 and I had not been exercising. The DVD was ok for a few days then it was boring.  I didn't even sweat during the workout and Tony does talk too much!,1365897600,,157,3.6176470588235294
8307039,5,B001GTJX5C,"As an over 50 person who knew she needed to begin some kind of workout, but had the excuses of no time, too tired, my knees hurt etc I was given this by my daughter. She did the routine with me the first time (way below her level as she does Tony's P90x ) and I can honestly say it was very enjoyable-not too strenuous for someone not used to exercising, but still offering a nice workout... so I know I will continue it ( which in all honesty if it was too difficult I probably would not have gone back to it)",1329868800,10,510,3.9611650485436893
