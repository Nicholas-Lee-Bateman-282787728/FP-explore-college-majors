The sound is great, the band swings, but the video quality is less than it should be. It appears to be in perpetual soft focus but there are hard uneven lines outlining the musicians on the shoulders and sleeves of their clothing which I found distracting. Unfortunately there are not a lot of latin music DVDs out there so I have to recommend it anyway. Poncho and his group deliver the goods. It's just too bad the video production quality doesn't match the sound quality or the performance. Buyers should also be aware that this is not in a widescreen format.",1033430400,21,723,4.569230769230769

7967977,5,B00006FMBK,"My advice? Move the furniture and roll up the rug. If you love Latin music you will not be able to hold yourself back from tearing it up. These musicians are superb. The Banda brothers are kickin' (...) and the are rest takin' names. Pancho, of course, is a super congero and vocalist. The horn section is killer. You will have chosen wisely.",1107302400,4,342,4.444444444444445
