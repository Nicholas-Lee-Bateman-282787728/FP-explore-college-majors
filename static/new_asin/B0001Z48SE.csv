2043864,5,B0001Z48SE,I really enjoy this movie I have watched a little more than a few times. I love Alex Carter in this it shows a funny side to him that you didn't get to see in some of his other films.,1174521600,,183,3.6
2043865,4,B0001Z48SE,"Carly Westin (Kim Huffman) is a self-employed caterer out to make a name for herself. When she agrees to a Cyrano-situation where she cooks a meal for a friend to impress her new lover, she never suspects that she will be a witness to her murder. Identifying Chester Winnifield (Corbin Bernson), who is better known as ""Professor Passion"" makes her a target from both his fans and Winnifield. When she starts to receive strange notes and attempts are made on her life, sexy detective Jack Brannigan (Alex Carter) moves in to watch over her, and the sparks begin to fly, much to neighbor Elliott's strife.

Based on Kristen Gabriel's ""Bullets over Boise,"" the film retains the novel's chemistry thanks to great casting and the humor of the leads (particularly Jack's bumbling antics when he helps Carly on her catering assignments).  It's definitely one of the better Harlequin novel-to-film adaptations. In fact, it was better than most of the romantic comedies to make it to the theater lately.",1172016000,,995,4.952095808383233
2043866,5,B0001Z48SE,"When I found out that Harlequin Romance novels were made into movies I was a bit unsure if I should watch them. I always pictured the male heroine in the stories to be gorgeous...and figured that a made-for-tv movie might cast some well, not-so-hot- leading characters.

This is not the case with this movie!!

Alex Carter makes a great leading man. I thought his acting was great and he really played the tough cop well. I didn't even realize that he was going to be Carly's love interest (but then I saw he was the only hot guy in the movie so...duh). He really is the perfect leading man. He has these gorgeous blue-green eyes and fabulous Greek good looks. Mmmm. And even though I was annoyed with the late 90's fashion (neither ""Carly"" nor ""Jack"" can dress to save their life) he was still totally hot under all those horrible button up shirts. And no, I'm not being pretentious b/c harlequin heroines always dress well in the stories (unless of course they're ranchers--so they're excused).

Anyway, I won't get into the plot...but I loved it. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",1170288000,3,1070,4.650793650793651
2043867,5,B0001Z48SE,"I don't know if it was because I was very anxious to watch the movie, but it seem to take longer than usual for the movies I purchase with Amazon. However the wait was worth it and I've enjoyed it very much.",1127779200,,207,3.9523809523809526
2043868,5,B0001Z48SE,"As a romance - YES!

As a mystery - darn good!

As a comedy - pretty neat!

Carly Westin is struggling to get her catering business started - after walking out on an overblown boss.

So she has agreed to help a friend [who can't cook worth a darn] set up a meal to impress a gentleman.

Now wouldn't you know they get themselves killed by ""Professor Passion"" with Carly hiding in the kitchen.  Whoops!

Carly has to call in the murder and gets police investigator, Jack Brannigan who wants to put Carly into the Witness Protection Program.  This sure wouldn't help Carly's business.

Jack is driven to distraction by the way all of Carly's neighbors come and go in her apartment.  Then the threatening letters and phone calls start.

Jack has gorgeous eyes [my observation! Wow] He senses interest and maybe competition from Carly's neighbor, Elliot.  Oh! Oh!

Sure loved the entrance through the attic into Elliot's apartment.

There is so much more to the story that my bare outline.

Jack was definitely what one would want in a masculine lead - compelling eyes - tender confusion - sense of humor [loved his handling of the little spoiled brat]

Would like to see more of this caliber of movie and great group of actors and actresses.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED - this is a Great addition to a DVD collection.",1105228800,31,1306,4.633187772925764
2043869,4,B0001Z48SE,"I initially was interested in seeing this movie because I'd read the book (""Bullets over Boise"") by Kristin Gabriel, who is one of my favorite romance writers. The plot of the movie strayed in more than a few places from the book, but the barebones plot was about the same, and the sense of humor and likeability of the characters was the same.

The two main leads (Kim Huffman and Alex Carter) were very appropriate for this film. I was not disappointed that they were chosen for these rolls! Huffman plays a pretty (but somewhat zany) caterer who has a ""wholesome girl next door"" way about her. She's very likeable and natural and not at all self-conscious. (I dislike actresses that seem so *aware* of how beautiful they are. She doesn't do that.)  I really liked her.

I've seen Alex Carter in other shows, and he usually plays a rather unlikeable fellow -- either a villian, or at least someone who is humorless and a little unpleasant. You can see why he'd be good in such parts -- he has this penetrating look and sharp (but handsome) features. But in this role he's very different. At first you think he's going to be the grim and brooding cop, but then he starts to show a sense of humor and an absolutely dazzling smile. Carter should play roles such as this one more often. He's great and is a wonderful complement to Huffman.

The plot is flimsy and implausable in some ways, but I didn't care. It's cute. It's funny. It isn't one of those tedious ""chick flick"" type movies where the women are all tragic victims, or where nothing happens and we're bored to death. Stuff *happens*. There is adventure, drama, humor, and mystery! It's a lot of fun! It had more than a few wickedly funny lines that made me laugh out loud.

Even though it is a Harlequin Romance movie, it's quite different (in a good way) from the other ones I've seen. I'm sure it didn't win any awards, but it holds up just fine and is quite entertaining. I'll definitely consider it to be a great addition to my DVD collection!",1085702400,39,2007,4.487671232876712

8018616,5,B0001Z48SE,"This is one of my favorite Harlequin movies because the story is interesting. It's a Harlequin, so we know how the story is going to end, but the main characters are interesting and the character dialogue includes romance, humor and a little mystery. Good combination and well scripted.",1433894400,,286,4.979166666666667
8018617,5,B0001Z48SE,This movie was very entertaining--it's humorous and is a nice who-done-it mystery.  Movie arrived securely wrapped and was as vendor described.,1361059200,,143,5.809523809523809
8018618,2,B0001Z48SE,"This is supposed to be a romance, I think--or maybe a mystery--or a thriller--or a comedy.  Kim Huffman decorates an otherwise dreary mish-mosh, but it is beyond her acting ability and girl-next-door appearance.  The detective tries to be so serious and tough.  The other assorted players are one dimensional:  the sister with marital problems, her straying husband, the neighbors, the female prosecutor, the villain, etc.

Granted, there's not much in the script to work with, and the ending is blushingly silly silly silly.  The director didn't put up much of a fight to make this watchable.  It was made for TV movie, a genre famous for its shallowness.  Only Kim Huffman seemed to give this a genuine effort.  She's not exactly beautiful, nor does she have a great figure, but she has an appeal as a young woman you might meet anywhere.",1320278400,,840,4.859154929577465

8018624,3,B0001Z48SE,"It wasn't an exciting movie; sort of guessed there was more to it (won't say what in case someone is keen to buy the DVD).
The romance could have started sooner, but did enjoy the mellowness of it all.
Never seen the actress in a movie, but enjoyed her character in this one. Would have enjoyed a bit more wit from the detective.
Loved the elderly neighbour - she was a hoot.
Looking for a light, romantic, touch of comedy at times, then get this DVD.",1201824000,2,451,4.255813953488372
