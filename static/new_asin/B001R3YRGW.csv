The setup is that you learn a few steps at a slow pace for a set period of time, then a medium pace, then fast pace. Then you do the routine through at the fast pace for a set time, but don't necessarily complete the last part of the routine. In other words, once the timer goes off, she stops you wherever you are and that's it for that segment. That bothers me. I prefer to learn and complete the dance steps for the joy of dancing and having fun, not to get a workout over with which seems to be the mindset here. If you are looking for good ballroom workouts that are well put together I highly recommend, Dance with Julianne Cardio Ballroom, and Dance it Off Ballroom with Kristina Milova. These are challenging and a total blast!",1271289600,7,967,4.2896174863387975
8337254,3,B001R3YRGW,"The Ballroom Body Blast starts out alright...I tried to have a positive attitude.  The DVD includes; warm-up, 4 dances (jive, salsa, samba, disco)and cooldown. Lisa first gives you the break down of the steps for each dance. After the quick overview of steps by Lisa, the dance is done with the group - SLOW, MEDIUM, and FAST.  The problem is the lack of cueing in reverse.  This was frustrating at first, but manageable. When it was time for the samba, manageable went out the window.

She does give you the beat prior to showing the steps, which was helpful. Several times, the camera angle wasn't on her feet during the dance - it needed to be!  This will get your heart rate up, and you can at least learn the breakdown of each dance. I was disappointed in this as far as cardio fitness.  I recommend this for more recreational uses =)",1243036800,4,839,4.4868421052631575
8337255,5,B001R3YRGW,OK so I looked at Playboy to see Lisa and I was struck with amazement at her body.  For her age it's amazing.  I know she is a big dance person so I bought this DVD to see if it's a good workout.  It is!  A little complicated but a very engaging - going through the full DVD is almost impossible with out breaks but doing each dance is a great start to my home fitness routine!,1240531200,7,377,3.857142857142857
