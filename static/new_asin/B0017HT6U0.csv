8265967,4,B0017HT6U0,"Towards the end of his life, Karajan was lauded by his cronies and retainers after a performance of Don Giovanni such as this. In a moment of self-honesty, however rare, he was heard to whisper: ""but Furtwangler would not have liked it.""

There is much to admire here. Overall, the production has more vitality and lan than the '85 studio version made in Berlin. Much of the cast is identical: Kathleen Battle is a delight on the ears and the eyes; Furlanetto makes a playful Leporello - I much prefer him in this role than as the Don himself; Burchuladze is suitably sepulchral as the Commendatore; I always liked Anna Tomowa Sintow as Donna Anna and she steps up to the big moments. There is an upgrade here: Agnes Baltsa from the '85 production was replaced by Julia Varady who is more of a Mozartian. The production itself is stylishly done. The bright spark who thought up the cosmic backdrop in the penultimate scene should be congratulated. The Vienna Philharmonic plays alertly.

But there are two failures - and catastrophic ones at that.

Don Giovanni is subtitled ""Il dissoluto punito"" and Samuel Ramey falls short. There is no sense of lascivious menace about him whatsoever. Emasculation has befallen him - even Whistler's Mother would be safe. Indeed, his inability to project any sort of sexual magnetism acts as a drag on the production whenever he lumbers into view. His Don Giovanni never strikes one as being so defiant of moral norms that the gods must intervene summarily.

The other achilles heel is Karajan himself. For much of the opera, his pacing is unerring. The overture, for instance, is a rocket. Whenever Ramey is not on stage, the production has the requisite tension, drama and sparkle. But Herbie falls short at the worst possible point. The Penguin Guide rightly said that his Act Two finale in Berlin ""went off the boil"" and so it is here - there must have been a systemic issue. Consider the key moment when the Commendatore intones ""Dammi la mano in pegno!""  - Furtwangler opens the gates of the Underworld at this point&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mozart-Don-Giovanni-Furtwangler-Salzburg-Festival/dp/B000006DEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mozart: Don Giovanni / Furtwangler / Salzburg Festival</a>. In Karajan's hands, it passes tamely. The Act Two Finale is arguably the greatest music ever composed - but not when it is performed like this.

If Kierkegaard fervently urged us to ""listen, listen, listen"" to Don Giovanni, I am not so sure that his imperative is fully applicable to this production. And Herbie, you were right: by a hairs-breadth, your predecessor would not have liked it.",1315872000,4,3051,5.467091295116773
8265968,5,B0017HT6U0,"""Just listen... And then compare""... I now many versions from this opera... This is a treasure...
Don't believe me... you have just to compare... For example, the very famous Furtwngler's interpretations from 1950, 1953 and 1954, are superb, of course. But not emotionnaly and musically so powerful...
Visually, the images are perhaps too dark. That's right. But what's the matter? Is this so important? Music is important...
Karajan as always, provides nuance and force its interpretation and the singers are remarkable...
Anna Tomowa-Sintow is poignant, with this single tear in her voice that suits very well here its role...
Ferruccio Furlanetto is the best Leporello I could hear...
The other singers are all in their proper place and perfect with their characters.
This DVD is also a technical improvement provided by German engineers from Studio B-Sharp in Berlin.
This would be a pity not to take advantage...

Historically, Karajan, born in Salzburg, makes a fine tribute to his illustrious countryman Mozart and this version was recorded in 1987, that is, exactly 200 years after its first performance under the baton of the composer... in 1787! (the description of the DVD has about it an error: it mentions the year 1984 instead of 1987... error not found on the previous edition published in the collection ""his legacy""... which was not ""B-sharp"" remastered ..)

It remains for me to wish you a great listening...",1305590400,7,1426,5.142241379310345
