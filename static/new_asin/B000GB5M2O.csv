2604083,1,B000GB5M2O,"Bunk. I feel as if Tobe Hooper screwed me for that $15.00. I had such high hopes for this one, once again, Masters of Horror has let me down. If you want horror, if you want to cringe at the screen if you want to gasp, hell, if you just wanna see A LITTLE blood... Don't look in here! So far the only M O H episode I have seen that was ""horrific"" was Ciggarette Burns! I guess I will stop buying them. Showtime obviously has no need to pursue horror. I will get ""Imprint"" because I have faith in Takashi Miike not being afraid to startle and disturb... And Showtime refused to air it. Leave this title alone!",1158278400,5,608,4.117647058823529
2604084,3,B000GB5M2O,"I totally agree.  You take a story by Richard Matheson, get Tobe Hooper to direct it and give Robert Englund a choice role and you would think this outing of Showtime's ""Masters of Horror"" would be a real treat.  Instead the result is quite disappointing and I would argue that the reason is an ironic little case of history repeating itself (insert ""Twilight Zone"" music here).  The good news is that the special features on this DVD take away some of the sting of the experience of watching ""Dance of the Dead.""

Set in a dystopian future that is right around the bend, ""Dance of the Dead"" is about a world where something has happened and now toxic residue falls from the sky.  The specifics on the war or terrorist attack are unclear, as are what exactly happens to people when they stuff falls on them, but America is clearly in a death spiral.  Meanwhile, poor sweet young Peggy (Jessica Lowndes) is bored with her mundane (but safe) existence working at her mom's roadside cafe.  When good looking Jak (Jonathan) and his obnoxious partner Boxx (Ryan McDonald) blow through town, she decides to take off with them and see what life is like in the big bad world out there.  Of course she finds out more about death.  The two guys are blood merchants, and then take Peggy to the Doom Room, where they sell plasma to the M.C. (Englund), who uses it as part of a secret Army recipe for this special juice that reanimates the newly dead for a short period of time.  The Army used it to get more from soldiers on the battlefield, while the M.C. uses it to reanimate female cadavers.  Use cattle prods to shock them, and you have the dead dancing for the entertainment of the wretched audience that comes to the Doom Room.

Now, in addition to turning his novel ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" into the movie of the same name and ""I Am Legend"" into ""The Last Man of Earth,"" Richard Matheson also did the scripts for Roger Corman's adaptations of the works of Edgar Allan Poe, most notably ""House of Usher"" and ""The Pit and the Pendulum.""  For television Matheson did scripts for ""Star Trek"" (""The Enemy Within"") and Steven Spielberg's debut effort, ""Duel.""  But if you talk about Matheson's work on television then first and foremost you need to talk about what he did for ""The Twilight Zone,"" where we wrote 16 scripts including the classic episodes ""Nick of Time,"" ""The Invaders,"" and ""Nightmare at 20,000 Feet.""  It was when I thought about Matheson's great work on the ""Zone"" that it dawned on me what was wrong with this story.

After three successful seasons of ""The Twilight Zone,"" the network executives decided that the show could be even more successful if it was twice as long, so for the fourth season episodes of the ""Zone"" were an hour long instead of a half-hour.  Overall, the resulting episodes were big disappointments, and Rod Serling' show went back to the half-hour format for its fifth and final season.  When I finished watching ""Dance of the Dead"" I realized the problem was that the story was twice as long as it should be.  Take the first ten minutes and the last twenty minutes and the story works a lot better than it does in this bloated format.  Now, it would be easy to point the finger at Richard Christian Matheson, who did the screenplay adapting his father's short story, but I think this one was doomed as soon as it was green lighted for the hour-long ""Masters of Horror"" format.  Strip down the story as I suggest and you have the makings of a classic episode of ""The Twilight Zone.""  The twist at the end is set up at the very beginning and by the time we get to the payoff you have probably forgotten it because the focus has become all about Jak showing Peggy the underside of the rock the world has become.

Several of the special features warn you that watching them before you watch ""Dance of the Dead"" will spoil the feature, which I find rather ironic.  There are commentary tracks by both director Tobe Hooper and screenwriter Richard Christian Matheson.""  I especially liked the ""Working With a Master: Tobe Hooper"" featurette with its walk down memory lane, which goes along with his ""Primal Screams"" interview.  Richard Matheson is also the subject of an interview, as are Englund, Lowndes and Tucker, all ""On Set.""  Then you can throw in your basic behind the scenes/making of featurette, still gallery, storyboard gallery, Tobe Hooper bio, and some trailers (mostly Horrorfest stuff).  In DVD-Rom mode you get the screenplay and a screensaver.  Like I said, the extras here are pretty solid and I am tempted to round up on the rating because of them, but ""Dance of the Dead"" itself is just too disappointing given our high expectations and the rating needs to reflect that sorry fact.  Check it out, but have no illusions about what you will see.",1176422400,10,4796,4.621462264150943
2604085,3,B000GB5M2O,"Written by Richard Matheson (an Outer Limits veteran with credits on ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"") and directed by Tobe Hooper (the gore-master who blessed the world with ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""), ""Dance of the Dead"" has a lot of creative oomph to live up to.  Unfortunately, despite a provacative premise and electrifying directing, this ""Masters of Horror"" installment still sputters and stalls.

The story concerns a post WWIII-America smattered now with pockets of anarchy and new chemical scourges.  Blood is let on suburban street corners in broad daylight, the scarred victims stumble about like painful, shadowed reminders of old regrets, and the living dead are unceremoniously dispatched in alley-way dumpsters.  It's a gloomy portent of a human-less land, where the last glittering bits of soul that are left are either mocked, co-opted, or drowned in neon, violence, and drugs.

There isn't much of a story.  Peggy (Lowndes) lives with her over-protective mother in a part of America that tenaciously holds onto old cultural mores (working at a cafe that still serves homemade apple pie).  Two brash, biker boys with questionable vocations enter and one of them, Jak (a blank-eyed Jonathan Tucker -- someone buy this kid a facial expression!), falls in ""love"" with Peggy's antiquated, wholesome appeal.  ""I haven't seen anything like you in a long time,"" he tells her.  At the hands of Jak's tutorship, Peggy learns some secrets about her past, her family, and the world she has been ignoring for so long.

All of the ""Masters of Horror"" clips (that I've seen so far) suffer from one real problem: timing.  The shows are just barely shorter than actual movie times.  Perhaps fearing the confusion of a plot that can't be squeezed into an hour, all of them have taken short story premises that would be best suited for a twenty-minute framework, and have tried to add ambience, needless (and poorly done) character development, and false scares to pad the show out to its required length.

""Dance of the Dead"" is well-done and, furthermore, is an interesting story, a clever commentary on society's dismissal of the very nature and idea of death.  Hooper pieces together the bits of the tale with jittering, feverish light and a patient eye for detail.  (Englund as an M.C. at a macabre club of perversion and chaos is the only real weak link, overacting as the mouthpiece of the writer's real ideals ... but, then again, Englund has made his entire career out of overacting.)  However, the story loses its potency because Hooper is forced to draw it out, to water it down with glaring noise and sound.  Much like the title characters, Hooper keeps forcing his tale to twitch and jerk, long after it is already dead.",1175126400,3,2727,4.97136563876652
2604086,3,B000GB5M2O,"About as horrifying and creative as your average episode of Tales From The Crypt or The Outer Limits, and maybe that's all this series was meant to be, I dunno, but I expected more. This story is mostly a mediocre teen drama, like a third rate Freaks And Geeks episode, with some brief disturbing but contextless torture scenes, and the requisite twist ending. Blahsville.",1174780800,3,372,4.828125
2604087,2,B000GB5M2O,"'Dance of the Dead' is director Tobe Hooper's (Poltergeist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre) contribution to the uneven first season of 'Masters of Horror'. The series contains 13 mini-horror films helmed by famous horror directors.

Some entries have fared better than others. This particular episode is, unfortunately, one of those others.

The setting is a post-apocalyptic society where a plague has wiped out most of humanity. There are two kinds of folks left: the decent kind, and 80's-movie, leather-clad baddies.  Sound familiar? That's because it's adapted from a short story by Richard Matheson who penned 'I am Legend', another 'Omega Man' style yarn that draws a clear line between good and not as good.

It isn't, however, the story that I take issue with. It's a decent 60-minute distraction, and the premise, from which the title stems, gleefully earns its horror stripes. The acting isn't all bad. One can always count on Robert Englund (all dolled up as the wicked drag queen MC of this freakshow) to bring something original to the table. Rather, the issue at hand is the stylistic choices, or lack thereof, employed by our featured director.

Tobe Hooper has directed everything from horror masterpieces (The aforementioned 'Poltergeist' and 'TCM'), to interesting misfires ('Spontaneous Combustion' and 'TCM 2'), and even some absolute stinkers ('The Mangler', 'The Funhouse'), but they've always had that distinct, old-school Hooper stamp. This, I am sorry to say, does not.

If I am to ingest an episode from a series with the moniker 'Masters of Horror', wherein a featured director brings his own sensibility to the table, then that is exactly what I expect to see. What we have here is a director who, afraid of taking a misstep, ends up delivering something entirely not his own. 'Dance of the Dead' is a slap dash jumble of a film that heavily employs bargain basement level 'MTV-Style editing', which is only as tired and outdated as the term 'MTV-Style editing'.

Don't get me wrong, for fans of the series, it is not to be missed. Those that desire to know every aspect of the production (from the adaptation of the story to Englund's inspirations for his character), this episode is for you. However, if you're in the market for top-shelf Masters of Horror, you'll find better company in Don Coscarelli, John Carpenter or Stuart Gordon.

This one is better left for dead.",1168300800,3,2395,5.03030303030303
2604088,4,B000GB5M2O,"Fans of SF or horror who can wrap their heads around stories (and the films based on them) like Orwell's 1984 and Burgess' A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, who understand that such stories are meant as cautionary comments on contemporary society more than they are predictions, will appreciate Tobe Hooper's nihilistic ""Dance of the Dead,"" the auteur's first-season entry for Showtime's MASTERS OF HORROR series.  Hooper updates those classic cautionary tales to give the world a fresh glimpse into the post-apocalyptic future, this time through a computer-age lens tinted with goth and punk sensibilities.

Hooper's tight and visionary direction is supported by the outstanding cast and crew.  Portraying Peggy, the audience's window into the grim future, beautiful Jessica Lowndes exudes unvitiated innocence as her character's eyes are newly opened to the reality of her world.  Actor Jonathan Tucker is perfect as Jak, a brooding, introspective black-marketeer who struggles with guilt over the questionable ethics of his vocation.  And horror icon Robert Englund's delightfully over-the-top performance as a grizzled, cynical nightclub MC--a sort of post-apocalyptic re-interpretation of Joel Grey's performance in CABARET (1972)--is itself worth the price of Anchor Bay's DVD.  The script by Richard Christian Matheson, based on a short story by his famous father, is a literate, frighteningly nihilistic speculation on the post-nine-eleven possibilities that threaten our world.  And the frenetic, multi-layered cinematography of Jon Joffin (enhanced by Andrew Cohen's the top-notch editing) perfectly complements the horrific, chaotic atmosphere and lifestyle of the potential future Hooper here depicts.

Any moviegoer who comprehends and enjoys SF-based horror will certainly come away satisfied after watching ""Dance of the Dead.""  While not necessarily the best entry from the first season of MASTERS OF HORROR, it is a great mini-movie nonetheless, and it proves that director Tobe Hooper is, indeed, a master of the genre.

The excellent DVD from Anchor Bay is well worth the price of admission.  It offers a pristine digital anamorphic transfer of the flick in its original aspect ratio of 1.77:1.  In addition, there are over three hours of cool extras, including two commentary tracks (one featuring director Hooper and one with scripter Matheson), interviews with Tobe Hooper and the main actors, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and more!  A fine addition to the film collection of any SF or horror fan.",1166572800,9,2508,5.58575197889182

I thought it was the Best Master of Horror I've seen.  I liked how the gore was less and the premise was actually realistic, unlike other movies in the genre.

So great in fact that when it first aired on Showtime, I caught it on 3 separate airings and since buying the DVD earlier this week, I've watched it twice already, and then caught it again when it aired one last time on Showtime! How can this not be a stellar short film? Definitely one of the best in the series to date. Great storyline, great accompanying music, and excellently cast(hello! Robert Englund!), with newcomer Jessica Lowndes giving a stunning performance as the young, naive Peggy, and Jonathan Tucker in a far cry from his other roles as the bad boy you can't help but love, Jak. All in all, an excellent ""Masters"" film, and one of the best Tobe Hooper movies to date!",1161561600,2,860,4.449367088607595
2604092,2,B000GB5M2O,"One of the most eagerly awaited episodes in Showtime's Masters of Horror series, Dance of the Dead is sadly disappointing.  Now granted, it's been a long time since Tobe Hooper, the craftsman behind the legendary Texas Chainsaw Massacre, has done anything remotely spectacular, but the potential was here.  Based on a great story by I Am Legend author Richard Matheson (and adapted by his son, Richard Christian Matheson), Dance of the Dead revolves around a Mad Max-ish post-apocalyptic future in which a sheltered girl (Jessica Lowndes) gets in with a bad boy (a beefed-up Jonathan Tucker, from the 2003 re-make of Texas Chainsaw Massacre) who does work for the MC (genre icon Robert Englund) of a club that does some very different performances than you would expect, only to learn a shocking truth about her family.  What's the most disappointing here is Hooper's techniques, which are quite a number of quick flashes, edits, and cuts; which were most likely done to give the story a tripped out feel, but only distract the viewer.  Not to mention that a majority of the cast are so bad delivering some truly atrocious dialogue (Lowndes and Tucker are the only ones who don't seem to be sleepwalking) that the episode has an overly campy feel to it, and the music (allegedly by Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan) is nu-metal drivel that is as derivative as Hooper's directing techniques.  It's a shame, there was a lot of potential here between Hooper, the story, and the cast; but it all got wasted.  There's some nice moments here and there (the apocalyptic flashback sequence is very nicely done), but there's not enough here to make Dance of the Dead what it could have been.",1160265600,7,1689,4.867595818815331
2604093,3,B000GB5M2O,"Well, at least Hooper has good taste in source material.  The excellent short story this is based on is too short for a one hour film, so a few things have to be made up, and it takes awhile before you really get to the horror aspect of the story.  The plot is about a young, sheltered girl working in her mother's diner, who gets swept off her feet by a ragamuffin bad boy who proceeds, along with his pals(one of which is a poor man's Jack Black), to introduce her to sex, drugs and rock & roll.  She's taken to a rock club run by Robert Englund where the house entertainment is extraordinary.  The film takes place in a kind of Mad Maxish near future after WWIII.  I did like this movie.  It won't ever be remembered as Hooper's best work, nor one of the better Masters Of Horror episodes, but I did like the story.  The actors were all throwaway except Englund, who seems to be having a ball playing the sinister MC.  My biggest complaint here is that Tobe decided to shoot this movie in that trendy double-vision, shakey, zoomy, rock video style that's so prevalent in movies anymore.  I know alot of people must like this style, otherwise we'd never have seen it again after Natural Born Killers, but I absolutely hate it, and it's really beneath Hooper to stoop to it to seem ""cool"".  Plus the lousy nu-metal soundtrack is enough to make you wanna upchuck in your shorts.  I guess that really can't be helped though coz the film has many scenes in a rock club and it is a product of the times.  Anyhow, this particular episode really isn't winning people over.  I wouldn't buy it and watch it twenty times, but Tobe at least deserves a shot, doesn't he?  I'll tell you one thing, Bub, it's a helluva lot better than that friggin' terrible Lucky McKee episode!!",1160265600,4,1767,4.396923076923077

I am, I'm sorry to say, bored with his stuff.  this takes place in some unknown future, Jonathan and a friend hijack people's blood on the street.

8130182,3,B000GB5M2O,"Masters of Horror: Dance of the Dead (Tobe Hooper, 2005)

Robert Englund may be the single most inconsistent actor on the planet. I never know whether Englund is going to end up bringing the A game that makes his roles in movies like Dead and Buried, A Nightmare on Elm Street, or Red shine, or whether we're going to get the Robert Englund of The Phantom of the Opera, Wishmaster, or Strangeland. This is not necessarily a bad thing, if an actor's good output generally outweighs his bad (and it has long been my estimation that Englund's does; even when the movie around him is bad, as with the first Elm Street movie or the more recent Inkubus, his part is usually at least worth the buck rental), so I keep watching Robert Englund flicks and hoping for the best. The same could be said for director Tobe Hooper, who pops out every once in a while with a film that may not be great, but it as least damn good (you probably missed Mortuary, and that's a shame), but is just as likely to come up with something that's just plain ridiculous (ever see Lifeforce? I did...). Throw the two of them together and you get the kind of probability malfunction that can lead to you having to go back in time and kill yourself in order to forestall the destruction of the entire planet, but since this little amusement was released under the Masters of Horror aegis, which has consistently gotten excellent work out of over-the-hill directors (John Carpenter and Dario Argento both turned in their best work in years for this series, and Incident On and Off a Mountain Road actually jump-started Don Coscarelli's dormant career; he's now making some of the best stuff he ever did), I figured I was in for a pretty good time. And I was right.

Plot: America, after the fall of society. Peggy (Autopsy's Jessica Lowndes) is seventeen, a good kid, kept on a short leash by her mother after the death of her twin sister Anna some years ago. The time she doesn't spend in school, she's working at her mother's diner, and it is there she meets Jak (The Ruins' Jonathan Tucker). There's a powerful attraction between them, and when Jak asks her to sneak out on a date with him that night, Peggy accepts. Jak and his cronies take Peggy to a nightclub run by a dementedbut kind of funguy (Englund) who's cooked up a drug that will bring the dead back for a short period of time. With the right stimulus, they dance. And given the right audience, they may do much more...

It's fun. It's not great cinema by any stretch of the imagination (I admit I was a bit surprised upon finding out that Richard Christian Matheson, who has penned some short stories that can be called timeless with a straight face, was responsible for this script, which is quite good but not destined for classic status), but you certainly won't feel like you've been cheated by the slighty-less-than-an-hour you'll put in on it. A feature-length treatment could do a little more exploration in some key scenes (did you buy the attraction between Peggy and Jak, for example? That should have been a priority, since the entire rest of the story turns on it), but what's here is a solid second or third draft, a barrel of fun with maybe a little too much left out for it to really pack the punch it deserves. ***",1392681600,,3263,4.517766497461929

Classic plot of good girl meets a bad boy and they fall for eachother...but with a horror twist and without all the lovey-dovey crap. I would also compare this episode to the movie ""Moulin Rouge"" due to the whole club scene. The story takes place in a post-apocolyptic world where criminals roam free among the streets.

This whole episode has a music video style of editing with alot of quick cuts and special effects that are out of this world. I congradulate Tobe Hooper for giving us this dark and twisted tale. The acting is brilliant, and there is nothing negative about this episode...except that there is no sequel.
