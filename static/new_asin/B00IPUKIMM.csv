8644567,5,B00IPUKIMM,"I actually thought this was going to be a dramatized movie about the English saints so when I started the movie I was initially disappointed.  But as I watched and listened to the conversations, I found myself immensely enjoying the conversation and learning much about the period.  I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it, but would caution the would-be buyer to be warned this is not a dramatized presentation of the English saints, but a conversation primarily with two English priests who are actually quite entertaining.",1501459200,2,531,5.0227272727272725
8644568,5,B00IPUKIMM,"This movie is AWESOME!  So informative and moving.  The two priests who act as our tour guides do a great job.  Lots of information about the English martyrs from the days of the Reformation.  You visit shrines, churches, and homes, and peep into hiding places where priests would hide out after saying illegal masses in people's homes.  And the lucky priest-hosts get to have mass right there on some of the same altars in these homes!!!  I found that particularly moving!",1462233600,3,473,4.777777777777778
8644569,5,B00IPUKIMM,"A nice documentary.  I used to be very anti-English because of what the English did to Ireland and other places.  Now I realize that England's Catholic heritage was stolen from the common Englishman, and that was because England was the most Catholic and faithful countries on earth.  The Devil gave his best attack on England, but he did not fully succeed.  I am shocked to see how the true Faith and the True Church (Catholic) survived in spite of centuries of devilish attacks.  England is Mary's dowry.  ""His Mercy is unto a thousand generations for those that love Him"".  You can see this love England had in the English people today.  Slowly, slowly England is coming back to the true Church.  That's not to say that there won't be many lost souls until that time comes.  May God Bless the English.  May the new Our Lady of Walsingham Ordinariate thrive.  It will be ironic if England ends up far more holy than Ireland.  Ireland is going downhill by it's own vain accord, sucked in by the allure of the modern world.  The English at least has/had the devil to blame.  If you ever visited Walsingham you will know immediately what I mean.",1449273600,2,1144,4.594059405940594
8644570,4,B00IPUKIMM,"The video was nicely done and the history was really interesting, especially if you have English ancestory. I take one star off because the DVD didn't work in my computer and I had to send it back for another one, which didn't work in my computer either. However it works fine on regular DVD players. Turns out other people have had the same issue. I think that the company that issued the DVD may have produced discs with errors resulting in not being able to play in computer disc drives correctly. If you can play it on regular DVD players, the program is worth watching.",1420070400,2,574,4.476190476190476
8644571,1,B00IPUKIMM,I ordered this DVD twice from Amazon and once from Ignatius press. All three copies stop about a minute and a half into the DVD and refuse to play the rest of the chapter. Until this problem is fixed I cannot recommend it.,1398988800,2,222,4.186046511627907
8644572,5,B00IPUKIMM,"This documentary, of course, cannot mention all of the Catholic martyrs from 1534 to 1681, including the 40 canonized by  Pope Paul VI, the 85 beatified by Pope John Paul II, not to mention those canonized separately, like St. Thomas More and St. John Fisher, St. Oliver Plunkett, and St. John Ogilvie (of Scotland, technically). But through its travelogue format, ""Faith of Our Fathers"" does highlight a representative selection of clerical and lay martyrs sensitively and effectively.

In London highlights include Westminster Cathedral with their visit to the shrine of St. John Southworth and pointing out the plaque displaying the continuity of the Catholic Church in England despite the English Reformation. The priests visit then Archbishop of Westminster (recently named a Cardinal), Vincent Nichols and he discusses his admiration for St. John Fisher.

Leaving London, Fathers Holden and Schofield visit Stonor Park to focus on the network of recusant Catholics, priest holes, and St. Edmund Campion. They interview Thomas Stonor, Lord Camoys. From Oxfordshire, they travel to West Grinstead in Sussex to discuss Blessed Thomas Bell, speaking with a former Anglican about how learning the truth about the English Reformation influenced his conversion.

Their travels continue with visits to the Ladyewell Shrine, with the Bishop of Salford, Terrence Brain, and St. Mary's in Chorley. Reluctantly leaving Lancashire (they are both from that area), they visit Yorkshire: Ampleforth Abbey, the ruins of Rievaulx, and the shrine of St. Margaret Clitherow in the Shambles.

Heading back to London, they visit the Tyburn Convent to hear more about the martyrs who suffered at Tyburn Tree, where one of the Benedictine nuns recounts the last words of some of the martyrs. During their journey, Fathers Holden and Schofield do not neglect Catholic culture in England: they highlight William Byrd's music; Hilaire Belloc; the loss of the monasteries and its affect on the people; the loss of Marian shrines and the bonfire of statues and images at Chelsea in 1538, etc.

This is an excellent overview of the Catholic Martyrs of the English Reformation, with beautiful and appropriately selected music, good videography for the most part, and two excellent narrators plus their guests. Highly recommended.",1396483200,5,2304,5.386111111111111
8644573,5,B00IPUKIMM,"What does your faith mean to you? What place does the holy sacrifice of the Mass have in your daily lives? What pains do you go through to support your faithful priests, to educate your children and raise them in the faith, to make your Catholic religion the epicentre of your lives, to live and die upholding the TRUTH, as given to us by Holy Mother Church and revealed by our Lord Jesus Christ? Deep and pondering questions, but this is exactly what this documentary is all about: Courage in the face of adversity!

""Faith of our Fathers: In search of the English Martyrs"" may not appeal to us in North America. After all so little is known about them. They seem so distant. However their story is more relevant to our own age as it was in theirs. For it was in the face of a state sanctioned persecution that we meet these brave men and women who disregarding the dangers that accosted them sacrificed all so that their fellow brothers and sisters would be brought to the knowledge of the one true religion.

Father Marcus Holden and Fr. Nicholas Scofield take us on a pilgrimage of discovery beginning in London in the archives of Westminster Cathedral and from there we visit very many sites associated with the lives of these Holy Martyrs. Who are these Martyrs? There were many. However these names take pride of place: St. Thomas More, St. John Fisher, St. Edmund Campion, St. John Southworth, St. Margaret Clitherow, St. Ambrose Barlow, Blessed Roger Wrenno.

Among the places visited are Chorley in Lancashire, the ancient Marian pilgrimage site of Ladywelle, Tyburn convent, Ampleforth and Riveaulx abbeys, Stonor Park to name a few.

And though these sites and locales provide a visual treat for the eyes. the existence of churches (and such beautiful ones too!) that have been resurrected in these places does lift up ones spirits. Also there are relics galore, both corporeal (actual relics of these Saints) and material in the form of chasubles, chalices and hidden altar tables where the Holy Sacrifice was offered in secret. Also we learn the harrowing accounts of the martyrdom of these heroes and heroines of our faith, and get a glimpse of the cleverly constructed hiding places for these priests aptly named ""Priest holes"".

This documentary is not merely a pilgrimage but it is a feast on the profound history of the Catholic Church during the difficult times of the English Reformation; the ploys and efforts of the government to stomp the Faith out completely and the underground Catholic church culture that sprung from it especially in music, in the works of Byrd and Taverner; eminent English composers, appointed by Elizabeth I to her chapels though they were secret Catholics, and the architectural masterpieces and art forms that were associated with the revival of the Catholic faith in England.

This Ignatius press version has a running time of 95 minutes in a one disc format. It does have a scene selection which enables the viewer to access his/her favorite scenes. Also it has trailers from other Ignatius press releases. It is in English without subtitles

This is a documentary that will most of all, in an effortless way, show us that standing up for our faith is worth every thing! ""For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it; for he that shall lose his life for my sake, shall save it."" St. Luke 9:24

Truly the Martyrs of England and Wales can be fittingly called ""The Patrons of our troubled times"".

NB: I have purchased both the North American and the UK editions of this fantastic documentary. The UK edition comes with two discs lasting approximately an hour each, in total 114 minutes. It is presented in English with no subtitles. The second disc has special features which are:
1) Information regarding the various pilgrim sites visited (i.e. www address, postal address and phone numbers.).
2) The music of the Martyrs ( Hymns composed during the period of the Reformation by Catholic composers and performed by the choir of Westminster Cathedral; these are merely clips of certain tracks and is accompanied by beautiful imagery of Westminster Cathedral)
3)Trailers from other series hosted by Fr. Marcus Holden.
The North American edition does not have the special features listed in the UK edition. Though its running time is shorter by comparison to the UK edition, nothing is omitted. It merely has better editing.",1394668800,12,6831,6.280982905982906
