8389111,4,B0035L3J9U,This was a present for my wife who has always had trouble painting roses. She watched the video and with a few starts and stops can now paint roses that look real. Other techniques picked up make her backgrounds better as well. The video is easy to follow and I can reccomend this to anyone who wants to learn.,1389139200,4,310,4.271186440677966
8389112,1,B0035L3J9U,"I found this DVD which has been reproduced from VHS; to be of poor quality. The beginning of the actual painting project was so bright and you could not see what she was doing and it actually gave me a migraine headache trying to watch it. I personally, would not recommend it to anyone. Both the Floral DVDs with Bob Ross and Annette Kowalski have problems. I have several of the Bob Ross DVD collections (some from Amazon.com) which are great; just that the Floral ones have problems, as far as, I know. Happy Painting.",1317254400,6,521,4.494736842105263
