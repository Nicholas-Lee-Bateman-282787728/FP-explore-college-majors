Sister Kenny is a biographical drama about a nurse whose mission in life developed into bringing relief to those who suffer from polio or infantile paralysis.  As a bush nurse in Australia she found an effective treatment that greatly reduced the crippling effects of polio.  Let the reader understand, until polio vaccines were developed in the mid 20th century, polio was a plague, a scourge and a blight to mankind.  Sister Kenny's treatment brought her into conflict with the medical establishment.  The title of ""Sister"" was given to Australian Army nurses during World War I.  The movie was originally released in 1946 by RKO Radio Pictures in black and white.  Dudley Nichols is credited with directing, producing and partially writing the movie.  The movie was adapted from a book by Martha Osteno and Elizabeth Kenny called ""And They Shall Walk.""
Rosalind Russell stars as Sister Elizabeth Kenny.  Alexander Know plays the role of Dr, McDonnell.  Dean Jagger is cast as Kevin Connors.  Philip Merivale plays Sister Kenny's antagonist Dr. Charles Brack.  I have seen the movie and found it to be heartbreaking and hopeful, an emotional roller coaster ride.",1428278400,,1306,5.027906976744186
