I very much appreciate the positive Amazon rewiews of the three fellas who praised Hou Hsiao-Hsien here before I did. But would it have been too much to tell us others who are not owning the '8 Movie Set' yet WHICH eight films are included - since Amazon is saving this important information from us?",1318896000,4,437,4.341463414634147
8311577,5,B001IZI0OE,"If you like films by directors like Abbas Kiarostami (to name another great director over the last ten to twenty years) you really must take the chance to see the films in this marvellous box of this remarkable director. And PLEASE allow yourself to take your time with these films. Beautiful as they all are,just to look at, their real beauty only comes to you slowly, after repeated viewings. One needs to know as much as possible about how he works, and why, to truly enjoy these films, but BELIEVE me: even at an idle first glance, there is so much to look at, and enjoy! But with every new look, the richness is enhanced. I recommend anyone interested in the art of cinema, to get acquainted with the work of Hou Hsiao-Hsien.",1314921600,2,730,4.496240601503759
8311578,5,B001IZI0OE,"Like the previous reviewer, I had been waiting for this to come out for a while. I've seen previous versions of this and the transfers for these films is as good or better. However, be advised that 7 of the 8 films are LETTERBOXED only, not anamorphic. Its all very watchable. Think first generation DVD back in 1998. Better than VHS, better than broadcast TV, but not like the DVDs we have these days (exceptions to the bargain bin at Walmart). I might have considered dinging a star or two because of this, but I already know there's nothing better available, so its not really fair. If you're a fan of Hou Hsien, this is an absolute necessity.",1296777600,7,646,4.483050847457627
8311579,5,B001IZI0OE,"I had been tempted by the earlier 4-DVD boxset of these, but could never bring myself to shell out the $225-$400 I'd seen it go for....then a few years later an 8-dvd set comes out for $45? Incredible.

The quality of the transfers is not phenomenal and City of Sadness is conspicuously missing but at this price point getting these 8 films for under $50 is worth 5 stars.",1296432000,6,372,4.391304347826087
