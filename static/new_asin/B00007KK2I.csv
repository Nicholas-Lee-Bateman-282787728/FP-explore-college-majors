7977527,4,B00007KK2I,"This documentary is riveting.  It will probably never see the light of day again, unless I am underestimating something.  A few months ago, I loaned my copy to my neighbor, who hasn't returned it.  Now what?  I'm not going to pay collector prices to obtain another copy, though I am tempted.  We live in the Atlanta neighborhood featured in the film, so of course it has a certain poignancy that others may not get.  But Benjamin captured the attention of world-wide stars Michael Stipe and Patti Smith, for very good reason.  He is one of a kind.  My only criticism is that perhaps TOO much of Smoke's music was featured in this film.  I prefer to listen to them as an audio-only document.  Still, anyone interested in the dark underbelly of human expression will love this movie.",1358035200,2,781,4.635036496350365
7977528,5,B00007KK2I,"I've only watched THE documentary at the 2012 DOC Lisboa (Portugal) and was bewildered by the quality of the documentary, the huge effort behind the film making and the amazing character (performer and singer) it portrays: Benjamin. Never had heard about Benjamin and by placing an order for this film, I look for redemption on my prejudices about ""differences"". Quoting Patty Smith and without  condescension: saw death singing. Long live to Benjamin's inheritance.",1351468800,,466,5.383561643835616
7977529,5,B00007KK2I,I ordered this expecting it to take at least a week or two to come but it came in only a few days! Very happy surprise PLUS the DVD had absolutely no scratches or sign of use!,1319846400,,175,3.7567567567567566
7977530,5,B00007KK2I,"Little to say about this film other than it is probably the most remarkable documentary I have seen. the fact that the filmmakers spent a decade off and on getting to know 'benjamin' means that two things happen: first, there's a complete intimacy and authenticity to the fragmentary shoots; second, the filmmakers don't go for quick sensationalism, and leave out just as much as you yourself would when telling the story of a close friend. It helps if you like 'Smoke's music, but it's not essential to be a hipster, the power of the voice comes through, and the makers use so many techniques to piece the film together, they totally avoid all the cliches of a music video or concert film, getting very close to the power of performance.
A truly wonderful film.",1316217600,,762,4.6940298507462686
7977531,5,B00007KK2I,"I was fortunate enough to be able to see this at the National Film Theatre when I was living in London.  I was in a film class through University College London, and we had the chance to see about 5 of Jem Cohen's documentaries - and the best part was that Cohen was there too, and after the film he got up and spoke about them and took questions.

I had never heard of Benjamin Smoke before seeing this documentary, but have been intrigued by him ever since.  The documentary is stunning in it's portrayal of Benjamin, and you really do get the sense that you've been taken somewhere else - a completely different realm - if only for a few minutes.  I'm a freelance photographer and I cannot say how often the images from this documentary have run through my mind as I've tried to capture my own sense of ""difference"" in the world.

This is definitely a mood piece, and I'd say that it'd be best to watch it in a place where you can just focus on the film itself - let yourself be mesmerized by it...",1195430400,3,1001,4.247368421052632
7977532,5,B00007KK2I,"The last thing Benjamin'd want is for some sycophant to ""justify"" his life.  Jem Cohen does as is his want in evoking the life of a true elysian navigator: pastels, washes, cinematic perfumes. Throughout it all Benjamin riffs; his grit betraying a lucidity that many choose to ignore.",1071792000,7,284,4.916666666666667
7977533,5,B00007KK2I,"If this is your first exposure to Benjamin and the music of Smoke, you might find his openess and life unsettling, but given a chance this drug-gobbling, dress-wearing poet will take up residence in your soul. This film captures, probably as well as is possible, the amazingly unique man that was Benjamin. While the film shows us tragic times, it isn't a tragedy. Instead, it's the story of a brave--and strange-- heart, who just didn't fit into the ""real"" world. Our loss.",1043971200,16,474,4.7926829268292686
