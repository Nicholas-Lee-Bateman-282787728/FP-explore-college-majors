8180560,4,B00008MTXX,"Fate Did Not Let Me Go - a story of a mother's love during the Holocaust.  Most mother's have at least one experience where the adrenaline kicks in and we experience what lengths we will go, at risk to ourselves, to protect our children.  This is one of those stories. Because of circumstances beyond their control, mother and son were separated, suspecting they would not be reunited. The one thing in the mother's control was her love for her son and ensuring his future. She did this by teaching him his faith, his heritage, and giving him incentive to carry on without her. Now, grown and with his own family, he has passed that on. The mother won over the cruelty of the people who imprisoned her and took her life.",1370390400,14,720,4.488549618320611
