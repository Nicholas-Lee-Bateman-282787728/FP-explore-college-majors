5324637,4,B009FFHV7Q,"This was a good toner exercise, still had some of the old moves.  The floor jacks wasn't for me.  Overall, a great workout.",1364774400,5,123,4.304347826086956
5324638,5,B009FFHV7Q,This is another great intermediate routine by Denise. I really enjoyed it-I did all 5 segments to make one workout and I felt every area was hit pretty well. I liked the new set and it was a well-cued routine.,1362009600,3,209,4.25
5324639,5,B009FFHV7Q,I am very pleased with this DVD. You can really feel every area you worked. I definitely recommend this work out DVD.,1361232000,,117,4.363636363636363
5324640,5,B009FFHV7Q,"I like Denise Austins workouts because of the length. New moves in this dvd actually make you feel the ""burn"" Great Short workout!!!",1361145600,5,132,4.782608695652174
5324641,5,B009FFHV7Q,I always get the most out of Denise Austion workout videos. I have been working out to her videos for 20 years now and I am always satisfied. The video is easy to follow and when I get done I feel like I have done a great workout,1361145600,4,229,3.7916666666666665
5324642,4,B009FFHV7Q,"I like this workout and would give it 3.5 stars. Don't love it, but it's good for a light day. You'll get some cardio, mostly strength workout. Denise's latest videos don't seem to have the intensity of her earlier videos.

The video is broken into five 10 min sections: arms & shoulders, back, abs, thighs, butt - plus warm up and cool down 5 min each. Denise alternatives doing 1 move for about 1 min and then move onto another move and (sometimes) alternates between cardio and strength moves. She goes at a slower pace, so the intensity is beginnerish. I didn't really break a sweat doing the whole video.

If you like Denise, you'll probably like this for a recovery/light day. Otherwise, skip it as there're better (more efficient) video's out there.",1360108800,4,756,4.676691729323308
5324643,2,B009FFHV7Q,"Overall I like Denise's videos but this one was a bit deceptive. Before I buy ANY video I will either go to youtube to look at a clip of it or collagevideo. I did that with this one as well. My left knee from time to time will give me a little problem, nothing serious, it will get a little sore sometimes. When I viewed this video I did not see anything that would cause any issues for me. I can do a few lunges, some jumping etc, just not constantly. Well once I ordered this video and did it, my knee was really bothering me. There are courtesy lunges, moves that have you jumping quite a bit, push ups where on the up motion you jump your legs apart and even burpee type movements. Soooo, if you have ANY issues with your knees DO NOT BUY this one. I hate wasting my money and did with this one so I am going to do all that I can to sell this one, trade it or something. Its not a bad video at all, just not good if you have sensitive knees. Anyone know where I can sell or trade it?",1356048000,39,987,3.915422885572139
5324644,4,B009FFHV7Q,"Overall I really like the 10 minute concept.  However, most people are probably going to combine two or more workouts with the 3 minute warmup and 4 minute cool down.  I think the aerobic nature of the first two workouts is nice but it feels a bit awkward to do one minute of cardio and then weights.  Many of the moves are new and you will sweat.  I found the abs, legs, and bun workouts effective and they do get your heart rate up a bit.  A good addition to your DVD collection for some fresh (and often challenging) moves.",1355011200,17,526,4.22

5324652,5,B009FFHV7Q,"Yes, the dvd is exceptional, as Denise Austin's work is.  The package arrived in a timely fashion on 10-3-14, but the carrier must have put it at the bottom of a very heavy load of packages--even though the sender had marked FRAGILE on the padded envelope, the outside was black--when I opened the envelope, it was the crushed and broken black dvd case that had bled through.  Fortunately, I do not need the case and the dvd was unharmed.  Seller may want to take the carrier to task on such a fo-pa--bad for business with most people.  As for me, I'm satisfied, just letting you know and can send you the envelope with broken case if you like or take it to USPS in Bolinas.",1413763200,,674,4.368

5324662,4,B009FFHV7Q,"I have used several Denise Austin workout routines over the years. This one is great so I am satisfied with my purchase. The routines are very doable for every fitness level and fun to keep up with. I would say the only thing I have trouble with is Denise ""rushes"" through routines a bit more than what I'm used to from her. I enjoy going at my own pace but not as easy to do with this one. Other than that I really look forward to my ""Denise hour"" every day and have become a little addicted to this workout. I've been using it for 3 weeks now and already see a difference in all 5 fat zones. Happy about that! *sidenote* it can be a bit hard on your knees at times so really listening to her tips on different muscles to use helps with that.",1367712000,6,743,4.061224489795919
