8749037,4,B01B1S2CXC,"If it was marketed as a legit system instructional video I would give it 3 stars, but it's priced appropriately and Oleg demonstrates some good info.  The audio isn't really timed right with the moves but he is good about making visual emphasis on technique.  It's a french dvd but narrated in english by Oleg himself and he does have a somewhat heavy accent.  I've been a fan since the first UFC's, seeing him pull off those rolling leg locks.  Not a serious step by step white to black belt kind of set, more off a 2 day seminar with Oleg(plus some footage of actual seminars in France).",1531180800,,589,4.425925925925926
