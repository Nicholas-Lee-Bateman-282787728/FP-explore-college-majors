if you have not seen these seasons then I recommend you do",1413504000,,1530,4.138513513513513
8081957,1,B000B5Y0FA,"I bought those dvd for someone who doesn't talk english since it indicate that the dvd are in french .  this is not the case.  the DVD are only in english . I was not able to be reimburse and when I sent back the DVD they kept them so I don't have the money and no DVD also.

I have written to amazon to they can correct the decription but they have not changed it.",1293235200,,365,3.776315789473684
8081958,2,B000B5Y0FA,"If you really love charmed, then you can buy 5 DVD seasons for the price of this three pack!  They are going for so cheep now, you might as well.  You don't get anything extra here, just the three packs wrapped together.  Why waist money? It is just as convenient to add  all three sold separately from Amazon to you basket and you save a ton.  If you have money to burn then buy this set.  I don't recommend it.",1167868800,,412,4.0875
8081959,5,B000B5Y0FA,"Having all 3 seasons in one pack may be a bit more expensive, but the convenience makes up for it. The first 3 seasons with Shannon Doherty were far superior to the following years. I have 3 sisters of my own and tho I love them dearly, there are conflicts and differences, such as the ones that are honestly portrayed in the 1st 3 seasons. The following seasons seem to be no more than an excuse for one liners, thereby losing the most touching and important thing about the show-that at the end of the day, your sisters are always there for you, as you are for them.",1158192000,2,568,4.268518518518518
8081960,5,B000B5Y0FA,"If you are a Charmed fan, or have seen reruns on tv then i highly recommend buying this three pack.  The first three seasons are the best, AND the only three with Shannon Doherty.  Unfortunetly there are no special features.

I got a great deal buying all three together.  Not to spoil, but i think the first few seasons are my favorites because of Brian Krause (Leo)developing a relationship with Holly Marie Combs (piper).  As well as the emergence of Julian McMahon (Cole).  They are very original in their writing, and the episodes are very entertaining while still giving you some drama.

Other than that, i can just say if you are enjoying the current Charmed episodes on tv, then i highly reccomend getting the three pack to see where it all began

I loved it!!",1142467200,4,768,4.595588235294118
8081961,5,B000B5Y0FA,"I agree with what another reivewer said. It's NOT cheaper buying the bundle. THe bundle cost $105.99 (free shipping) but if you buy seasons 1-3(Season 1: $29.96, Season 2:$37.99, Season 3: $32.99) seperately the total will be $100.94 (free shipping) which is a savings of $5.05 so even though it seems like a good deal, it's not. Buy it seperately...you'll save money. I am glad I didn't wait until the bundle came out. I bought each season as they came out. And I'm going to keep buying them seperately besides that, I don't want to wait...hehehehe. Anyways other than that, Charmed season 1-3 is great. I can't wait until season 4 and the rest of the seasons come out. Gooooooooooo CHARMED!!!",1134691200,7,694,4.743801652892562
8081962,5,B000B5Y0FA,"I am a devoted Charmed fan -- and have all three seasons of the Charmed DVDs. I highly recommend all 3 Seasons as the first 3 Seasons are my favorite years.

However, I would NOT recommend the bundle as it is more expensive than purchasing each season individually--and it doesn't appear that you get anything extra for purchasing the bundle!",1133136000,15,342,4.7
8081963,5,B000B5Y0FA,"Even though it's only the first three seasons bundled together sans extras, this release makes a wonderful purchase for the Charmed fan on your list.

Charmed is a WB sci-fi drama about three sisters who discover that they are witches. Living together in their old childhood home in San Francisco, they vanquish evil as the Charmed Ones, all-powerful witches.

They receive guidance from their White Lighter/Handyman Leo Wyatt (Brian Krause) and the spirit of their beloved Grams/Penny Halliwell. (Jennifer Rhodes) who raised them after their mother Patty died.

Two of the sisters will be familiar to many audiences. Shannen Doherty (best known for her roles on 90210 and Little House on the Prairie) plays Prue, the eldest. Alyssa Millano (who had starred on Whose the Boss and Melrose Place) plays the youngest, Phoebe.

I think these 'television returns' is what gave this drama initial interest for some people, but excellent writing and a good special effects budget subsequently kept large majorities of people hooked onto the series. In these early seasons, the show appeared as a cross between Charlie's Angels and Bewitched.

Purchasing this multi-volume set is an excellent idea for the diehard Charmed fan. Why on earth scramble to get the separate seasons when it's already bundled together for us?",1132099200,10,1311,5.194312796208531
8081964,5,B000B5Y0FA,"The successful show stars four women who are witches who bleong together as sisters. The oldest strongest short-lived, Prue(Shannen)power to move things and power to astral project. Piper(Holly)middle sister, power to freeze and explode things. Troubling Phobe(Alyssa)power to see the future, ex-empath and levitation. Last but not least, Paige(Rose)half baby sister, power like prue except for being part white-lighter. All these ladies performed there asses off for the show. That why it's so successful. In my opinion, all four ladies are wonderful!",1130371200,4,552,5.7439024390243905
