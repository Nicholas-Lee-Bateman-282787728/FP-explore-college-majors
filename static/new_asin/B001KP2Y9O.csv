3667313,3,B001KP2Y9O,This wasn't one of the better Harlequin movies made. The actors lacked any real chemistry and the female lead was portrayed as being so naive and innocent as to be unbelievable.,1422316800,,177,4.741935483870968
3667314,4,B001KP2Y9O,This is another Harlequin book that has been made into a movie. It was ok movie. Lot of Hrlequin books made into movies leave a lot to be desired.,1377302400,,146,4.068965517241379
3667315,5,B001KP2Y9O,This movie had some excitement and humor as well as romance. My fav harlequin movie so far. The film was well made and the acting good.,1351296000,,135,4.230769230769231
3667316,4,B001KP2Y9O,"The female lead plays a sweet, but somewhat defiant, character.  She's in need of funds to hang on to the money pit home her parents left her in which she currently rents out rooms and gives piano lessons.  Magically appears a bounty hunter willing to share a large fee if she helps apprehend a tenant that owes her back rent.  Thus begins a corny chase down the U.S. to Miami.  The no-nonsense former FBI agent-turned bounty hunter must deal with non-sensical behavior and feelings of passion that develop.  Still a happy ending occurs, even though by the end of the car trip, I was ready to ditch the girl.",1254441600,4,608,4.541284403669724
8315652,1,B001KP2Y9O,The worst!  The female lead looked and acted like the most annoying 10 yr old I've ever encountered in my life.  The entire pretense was boring.  Don't waste your time.,1509235200,,168,4.533333333333333
8315653,2,B001KP2Y9O,The lead character was utterly lacking in anything I could connect with.  I realize that character building was part of the plot but it would have been nice if she'd started with a foundation at least.,1508025600,,201,4.583333333333333
8315654,2,B001KP2Y9O,"Movie was okay, somewhat cute and worth watching although not a favorite of mine",1506902400,,80,4.785714285714286
8315655,1,B001KP2Y9O,"Others were  good, this one is terrible! There's no appeal. To me, it's unromantic!",1506816000,,83,4.928571428571429
8315656,3,B001KP2Y9O,Loved him. Hated her. Liked the movie.,1506124800,,38,4.571428571428571
8315657,3,B001KP2Y9O,"While not the worst tv movie I've ever seen, this one is extremely mediocre. Cynthia Geary played ""Shelly Tambo"" in Northern Exposure and I liked her nave, quirky portrayal of that character. However, after seeing this movie I've realized that is the only type of character she can play. Her character in this tv movie is quite annoying with her mousy, whispery personality and (literally) wide-eyed appearance. Cynthia Geary's British accent made me laugh out loud because it was so awful. The only reason I watched this one to the end was because I had some time to kill and the lead actor is pretty sexy.",1503619200,,607,4.735849056603773
