5368024,2,B009TT0BSE,It's a long movie but for as much as they cover it should of been longer. It isn't really all that great of a movie.. i have seen better for instance the world unseen is pretty good. this one is just ok,1359072000,3,202,3.8333333333333335
5368025,5,B009TT0BSE,"I love period movies, and this one is quite well done.  Diane Kruger makes an awesome Marie.  The cover is a bit misleading, as you think her mistress (the one in green) is one of the main characters, but in reality, the movie is more focused around Marie and her reader.  I really enjoyed watching this and watched it a couple of times.",1359072000,,337,4.317460317460317
5368026,4,B009TT0BSE,"Much was made in the media of a relationship between Marie Antoinette and La duchesse Gabrielle de Polignac which suggests a same gender attraction as an element of this film.  Further, the Queen's reader (described as a lady in waiting in some reviews, but little more than a higher class servant) has an equal infatuation or attraction for Marie Antoinette as the Queen does for the Duchesse.  This is really not the point of the movie, though the triangle is used as a device to get to one of the important centers of what I believe the author is trying to convey.  Devotion and betrayal, true sacrifice and perhaps a type of love in spite of betrayal. Aside from this, the movie takes some time to develop its themes and has a few shades of ""upstairs downstairs"" (mostly downstairs) view of life at the palace.

The beautiful palace and the magnificent dress are in almost every shot.  The cinematography is magnificent.  However, they are juxtaposed with the mundane conversations of both servants and masters.  This juxtaposition is intentional and strips away all those trappings to focus on life and situation.  There are no grand parties.  The soundtrack of this movie is not the Baroque, Rococo, or neoclassicist dance music we are used to.  It is the klesmatic, slightly disjointed, wandering and wondering of servants who seem the most out of tune with what is happening.  Indeed, the movie spends a vast amount of it's time developing as it shows the daily prattling of servants and occasionally masters.  The movie is beautiful, but there is no pomp and circumstance here.  The servants (particularly Sidonie the Queen's reader) are that ""fly on the wall"", observing. One would think servants would have a greater understanding of what is happening with the masses outside than royals.  However, this movie depicts a servant class even more isolated within the grounds precisely because they are not the privileged class.  Their worlds are also about to radically change and they strive to ascertain what is happening as they notice the stir among the royals.  We also see the more realistic ""come to Jesus"" moments for the royals as they realize what is happening.  The publishing of ""The List"" was particularly poignant.  The list is a document that details which persons must be beheaded in order to affect reformation in the country.  Contrary to what another reviewer called ""an outside view"", this is perhaps the most inner view and frank perspective one could have of life within the palace at that moment.  In my opinion, that is the greatest value of the movie over the relationships themselves.  That may have not been the intent and I don't know how true to the novel it is.  However, the time devoted to that perspective makes it hard to ignore.  The greater focus lies there.

Sidonie's predicament develops against this backdrop.  She desires an estimation and affection from the queen she cannot have.  The Duchasse has it and values it only as a passport to privilege.  I can say the greatest single moment in the movie (with a very long setup) is where the final meeting between Marie Antoinette and Sidonie takes place and tremendous favors are asked of Sidonie, or demanded however you take it.

There is little by the way of titillation that the media would suggest.  I would not even say I was that ""entertained"" by this movie.  However, I was impressed.  I did ultimately appreciate the viewpoint of life at Versailles that is never presented in movies about Marie Antoinette.  I appreciated the irony of Sidonie's situation and the possibilities eventually presented to her.  As I mentioned, this is not an entertainment piece.  But it is a fairly serious film.  Take that for whatever it means to you personally and decide whether it's for you.  I would not normally buy the movie, but I did already before seeing it, so I guess that's done!  I would definitely not have missed it and I will watch it again at least once some day.

Star studded (though Americans will not recognize all the names) and well acted.  I would even call this movie MASTERFUL.  Yet I was not particularly entertained.",1358726400,10,4132,4.838801711840229
5368027,5,B009TT0BSE,"Farewell My Queen takes place during the last days of the french monarchy while the French Revolution knocks on the gates of the Palace of Versailles. It shows the tense atmosphere among the ruling french monarchs as the revolutionary mob approaches them.

The lesbian affair between the Queen of France and the Duchess of Polignac is not the central point of the movie, but it turns out to be an emotional escape from the surrounding stress involving the characters. In this sense the movie poster can be certainly misleading for those hoping to watch a hot lesbian affair.

The actors are fantastic. Diane Kruger does a great job as the queen of France. Lea Seydoux absolutely steals the movie as incredibly talented and gorgeous.

The movie constantly reminded me of Downfall, the German movie that portraits the last days of the Third Reich as the Red Army approaches Hitler's bunker. Both movies portrait the reaction of leaders of doomed regimes as they get close to their end.

Highly recommended!",1358640000,30,1004,4.923076923076923
5368028,1,B009TT0BSE,"If you are expecting a splendid, historically accurate and sumptuous depiction of the final days of the court of Versailles under Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette, this may be disappointing.  Although filming may have taken place in parts of the Versailles complex, most of the surroundings (both upstairs and downstairs) look relatively shabby when compared even to a Downton Abbey.  The events of the drama run from July 14 to about July 20, 1789 -- from the fall of the Bastille in Paris to the flight of the Duke and Duchesse of Polignac from Versailles.  You do not see the fall of the Bastille or events in Paris, but hear about them via conversation among royal servants. The story is told from the perspective of a young and attractive female servant (reader) who becomes attached to the Queen, but is asked/forced by royal order to inpersonate the Duchesse of Polignac, the Queen's supposed lesbian lover, in her flight from Versailles to Switzerland in order to prevent her arrest.  The story ends with the refugees crossing the border. --  While the story ends at the Swiss border in July 1789, the King and Queen remained in Versailles almost undisturbed in their ceremonial and recreational pursuits until October 5, 1789, when the Paris mob and authorities removed them to Paris.  The Polignacs and the King's younger brother, the Comte Artois, fled in July due the low repute in which they were held for their ultra conservative views.  Although the Queen's reputed lesbian affair with the Duchesse of Polignac was the stuff of gossip, so too was her all too heterosexual relationship with Swedish envoy Count Axel von Fersen who remained with the family for several years longer. Louis XVI and his Queen were not beheaded until 1793.

While the Court of Versailles was reputed to have been lavish and colorful in its ceremonial, the relatively few ""extras"" and seemingly confused and cluttered stage managing are unconvincing.  This film compares most unfavorably in that respect (and others) to the fairly recent depictions of Versailles in its final months in JEFFERSON IN PARIS (2004) and THE AFFAIR OF THE NECKLACE (2002).",1358294400,7,2140,4.971988795518207
5368029,3,B009TT0BSE,"""Farewell, My Queen"" (""Les adieux  la reine"") chronicles the earlier days of French Revolution, but you will not see angry crowds or guillotines. Based on a Chantal Thomas's novel, the film is about one Sidonie Laborde (La Seydoux, ""Sabine Moreau"" of ""Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol""), a lady-in-waiting and reader to Marie Antoinette (Diane Kruger), just before the country is thrown into turmoil.

So the film's story is about a young woman loyal to the Queen even when the regime is falling apart and some even leave the King Louis XVI's palace looking for a safe place. The film (partly shot in the real Versailles) is memorable as a convincing picture of chaos and fear that slowly spread in the court.

Director Benot Jacquot, it is clear, intends his costume drama as something relevant to viewers living in 21st century, with a focus on a young woman Sidonie admiring capricious Marie Antoinette, who asks her one favor. Marie Antoinette has a close friend Duchess of Polignac (Virginie Ledoyen), of whom Sidonie is jealous, barely suppressing her emotions.

Well-acted as it is, ""Farewell, My Queen"" feels rather distant and detached. The film rarely explores the mindset of our protagonist, whose fascination with the Queen is made believable by the fine acting from the star La Seydoux, not by insightful observations about the relationship between them. The camera that moves too busily and overuses close-ups does not help.

After all, ""Farewell, My Queen"" is all about great performances from the stars, as well as locations that are both lavish and squalor, and gorgeous costumes. What the film doesn't have is a compelling drama between these characters.",1357948800,5,1676,5.102189781021898
5368030,5,B009TT0BSE,"Farewell, My Queen is a transporting film, vividly realizing its period and telling a compelling story about compelling characters.  An all-time classic.",1357257600,5,153,5.954545454545454
5368031,4,B009TT0BSE,"We have all wanted, at some point in our lives, to be a fly on the wall at a moment of historical significance. The fly - this time - is a servant to Queen Marie Antoinette played magically by Lea Seydoux.  The entire film revolves around ""her"" point of view.

Sidonie Laborde reads books to the Queen and is summoned at all hours of night and day to respond to Marie Antoinette's whims. It is apparent that Sidonie, a naive girl, has a schoolgirl crush on the Queen but is emotionally hurt by the fact that her majesty is in thrall to another beautiful woman, la Duchess de Polignac.  There is a telling scene where Sidonie opens the chamber of la Duchesse when the other is fast asleep and nude, and she examines the woman from almost a clinical perspective - trying to understand where is the charm?  But the love triangle takes second place to the reality of the urgent news that the Bastille Prison has just been stormed by the people of Paris and its jailer mutilated by the mob.  The very existence of the monarchy and the nobles is on the precipice.

The plot imagines three days in which the idea of revolution swims in the heads of the nobles and servants of Versailles; they realize that their carefully shut off existence is coming to an end and scramble to figure out a way to survive.  Most act badly...full of self interest...or even disloyalty.  Reluctantly, Sidonie Laborde accepts the request of the Queen to act as a decoy by getting dressed up as the Queen's lover and leaving the palace in a lavish carriage.  The purpose of the order is to allow both Queen and her lover to escape safely.  Some palace servants wisely warn Sidonie to refuse to be a decoy...since they fear their companion is going to be killed within the day. As these servants see it, the harm the royalty inflicts on the people they rule is just a minor nuisance to King and Queen.

Impressive highlights of the film are the gorgeous cinematography and costumes. (Yes, opt for Blu-Ray to capture all that wonderful detail).  The director shoots two sides of Versailles - its dark rooms and its splendid chambers.  The rapid disintegration of palace life is tangible and realistic like the discovery of water rats running through the corridors.

Most of all, I was moved by Lea Seydoux's underplayed emotional performance as she struggles to grasp the enormity of all these events - intimate and historical.  On balance, I recommend the film as one of the better entries of 2012.",1351468800,83,2469,4.605022831050229
5368032,3,B009TT0BSE,"Farewell My Queen (Les adieux  la reine), directed by Benot Jacquot with a screenplay written by Jacquot and Gilles Taurand and adapted from the novel of the same name by Chantal Thomas, is something of a mixed bag.  On the plus side, it shows an extraordinary attention to detail when it comes to recreating life as it was at Versailles at the time of the French Revolution, in everything from the sets and the costumes down to the court behavior and social structure.  But on the minus side however, it moves at a near glacial pace at times and doesn't really make a connection with the audience, always feeling a level removed emotionally.

Set at Versailles (much of the film was actually shot in and on the palace grounds at the real Versailles) on the eve of the French Revolution, the film is centered around the perspective of a young royal servant named Sidonie Laborde (La Seydoux) who serves as a reader to the Queen, Marie Antoinette (Diane Kruger).  But as the film shows, being the royal reader was actually more akin to being the royal radio, something for the Queen to half-listen to in the background as she does other things.  Which makes the character of Sidonie ideal as a witness to the goings on at court - always there, in the background, but largely unnoticed by the royals and the aristocrats who move about her in the same space but not at the same level.

The film proceeds to follow life at the palace over the next few days as the Revolution unfolds elsewhere, remote at first but gradually intruding more and more as rumors begin to creep in and a growing sense of uncertainty starts to pervade the royal court.  But there does not seem to be any coherent story arc and no exposition is given to help us put any of this into some kind of chronological context.  If you come to the film with a fairly well-grounded history of court life at the time of the French Revolution, then you will probably have a better sense of what is going on as the film progresses than I did.  As it was, the film in and of itself failed to provide that, leaving me with more of a sense of muddled meandering than any actual plot progression.

What Farewell My Queen is best at is showing the life at Versailles at a kind of split-level - the life of the nobility as seen by their servants, and the life of the servants themselves, which in a way tend to mirror the lives of the nobility they serve in that one's status among the servant class is directly connected to the status of the particular noble they serve, with everyone constantly jockeying for anything that will give them an edge.  Which makes information - and access to sources of information - the coin of the realm in this highly rarified world, particularly now that rumors of instability and revolution in the outside world (the world outside of Versailles, that is) are starting to seep into the palace, making nobility and servants alike increasingly uneasy.  This is well brought out in the film as servants and even aristocrats are constantly searching out and bartering for information even as they pretend on the surface that nothing is wrong.

The other thing Farewell My Queen is best at is showing the gradual descent into disorder that takes place as people become increasingly unnerved and end up either being toppled from their positions - for real or suspected failure or disloyalty - or simply running off in an attempt to flee the approaching chaos before it reaches them. Staff functions slowly begin to break down as well, to the point that a servant makes the shocked comment that he saw the Queen having to actually open a door for herself because the servant who normally did it for her had disappeared. One of the best scenes shows Sidonie and a fellow servant looking out a window late at night and seeing a couple of mid-level aristocrats in the process of preparing to flee along with their servants, hurriedly loading up their elegant coach with paintings, furniture and whatever other valuables they can lay their hands on; rats deserting the royal ship they sense is sinking fast.

And yet one more point in Farewell My Queen's favor, at least artistically, is that Jacquot works to show what the real Versailles was like by not only shooting it on the actual historic location but also using only sunlight and candle light to illuminate the rooms, just the way they would have been back in 1789. He also shows that certain aspects of life were inescapable - even for the nobility - by showing how even the royal palace at Versailles had a rat problem, and how servants and even the nobility could end up looking disheveled if summoned suddenly.  The difference in feel and appearance between the Versailles of Farewell My Queen and the usual ultra-sanitized and glamorized Hollywood version of a royal court is immediately felt and is vastly to the film's credit.

But for all of the artistry and atmosphere, Farewell My Queen ends up failing to make an emotional connection.  Part of the reason is, I think, flaws in the ways the two main characters - the Queen and Sidonie - were written.  Quite frankly, it's hard to sympathize with Diane Kruger's Marie Antoinette, who comes across as something of an insecure airhead with attention-deficit disorder.  Perhaps in an attempt to compensate for this, writer/director Jacquot created a sub-plot implying a lesbian relationship between Antoinette and one of her ladies-in-waiting, Gabrielle de Polastron, the duchesse de Polignac (Virginie Ledoyen), but instead of adding anything it ends up making both characters even less believable - or sympathetic - as it comes across more as just neurotic neediness on the part of the Queen and clueless befuddlement on the part of Gabrielle.  At the same time, Sidonie is something of an enigma.  While on the one hand she displays something of a fascinated loyalty to the Queen she serves, Sidonie reveals nothing of herself.  That this is done deliberately becomes clear in a scene where one of her fellow servants points this out, that Sidonie has never told anyone anything about herself - not  a word about where she comes from, or what family she might have, what she thinks or feels or anything else.  To which Sidonie responds with a silent look, after which she pretends the question was never asked.  Mind you, there's nothing wrong with a character being enigmatic, but when everyone else in the film is left as little more than a title or a function, it doesn't give the audience much to connect with.  The result, for me anyway, is that by the time the film reached it's supposed climax, I didn't really care because I never become invested emotionally in any of the characters.

This also comes out in the way that a number of scenes are visually crafted.  In several scenes, you can actually sense the characters moving into position and then staying there for a moment, giving you the impression that, for that moment, you're looking at a painting from the period where the people and the setting have been preserved on canvas.  But while this works artistically, it comes at a cost not only of further slowing the pace of the film, but of also draining the characters of any real sense of individuality or actual life.  Once in a while a character gets to say or do something that causes them to rise, however briefly, above the film's at times stultifying devotion to atmosphere, but it's never enough to allow them to come fully to life.

Furthermore, the film ends up having a frustrating and almost claustrophobic feel as all of the real action - there is a revolution going on after all - takes place off-stage, and we only hear about it in whispers of rumor and occasional hurried deliveries of news.  You frequently long to see some actual scenes of what's happening beyond the palace grounds, but the camera rarely goes there.

All in all, I can recommend Farewell My Queen for being a stylistically crafted film that's beautiful to look at, and for the way it conjures a sense of what court life at Versailles was like and the atmosphere that must have existed when that that life began to fall apart as the country was consumed by the French Revolution.  But in terms of offering anything in the way of historical perspective or even an engaging storyline or set of characters, I'm afraid it falls more than a little short.",1350950400,46,8345,4.6846785225718195

5368050,4,B009TT0BSE,"For people who enjoy period dramas about European royalty, this is an excellent addition to the canon. Told from an unusual point of view-- a lady-in-waiting who witnesses the very early days of the French Revolution from inside the courts-- we feel the claustrophobia and panic of the nobles and servants who know something terrible is going to happen, but don't know what, or when.

La Seydoux shines as Sidonie, the ambitious Queen's reader. She trades information with her fellow servants and becomes a pawn for higher-ranking aristocrats seeking to curry favor, but Sidonie herself remains a cipher. We don't know where she comes from or who her family is. All we know is that she is bewitched by the Queen and French royalty in general, perhaps because in those moments of intrigue she feels like she's taking part in a design greater than herself. Diane Kruger is also incredible as the capricious Marie-Antoinette. At one moment she trusts Sidonie with intimate details, and in the very next she dismisses her without a second look. The setting is also gorgeous-- the beauty of the costumes contrasts extremely well with the general decay of the palace in its waning days (seriously-- we swamp sores and dead rats).

More casual watchers who aren't into period dramas will probably enjoy it a lot less. The plot is thin and well-worn, and the main characters never have any agency. Even when Sidonie obtains information or favor, she is incapable of using it-- she's the queen's reader, but she's also just a lower class servant. Sidonie is only ever an observer, and the only connection the audience can make with her is to pity how helpless she is in being anything greater.",1486512000,5,1684,4.86411149825784

The queen also confides in her that she has sexual longings for a woman, Mme. Poligny.  As they all hear about the storming of the Bastille, everyone at the palace is worried about what will become of them.  Some begin leaving so they will be far away before the Revolutionaries get to Versailles.  Marie Antoinette wants to prevent her lesbian lover, Mme. Poligny from being killed so she invents a scheme to get her out of the palace and away before the hoards arrive.  She concocts a plan to get her lover out of the palace which includes the maid.

This movie was no exception, but had a completely different feel from most historical drama. As has been mentioned, the movie is from the perspective of a servant to the queen, so we see a lot more behind the scenes action than we do of Maria Antoinette. I found this offered a refreshing change and that I learned something new about what life was like as the monarchy was crumbling, rather than just watching the same old story I've seen before.

Also, the film incorporates some more modern filming techniques such as switching to a ""through the eyes view"" of the main character as she is pushing through crowds or running around. Those shots give a more documentary and modern feel that provided an interesting juxtaposition to the historical nature of the movie.",1456185600,5,860,4.733333333333333

It is an adaptation of a historical novel about a lady attendant who reads books to the queen she being Marie Antoinette wife of King Louis XVI. The action takes place at the Palace at Versailles during the period July 14-17,1789. We get to see life at Versailles and what the events on the 15th and the days following had affected everyone there. while most of the story is based on facts,yet there is some things including the character of Sidonie who reads to the Queen and An affair of the heart with one lady of privelege. Lea Seydoux portrays Sidonie. Lea brings the right touch and tone to her role and makes you believe she is Sidonie. Diane Krueger puts in a fine performance as the Queen bringing int he picture of a Queen on the edge.

I found this movie vaguely interesting. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's not the best. There are historical inaccuracies throughout but this is FILM...so for those of you complaining that it's not ""accurate""...it doesn't have to be. No Film has to be historically perfect, just as no work of art has to be from the school of realism. Film is Art. If you want to see a historically accurate portrayal, watch a documentary or read a history book.

My main problem with the movie (and yet, the most artistic and well done piece) was how slow everyone moved and spoke. One would think everyone in the film was on Valium for all the emotion they showed and the way they moved...Except for the Queen. She was the only one that didn't move at a snails pace and showed true emotion. Their world was crashing down around them and they knew their lives were in danger....but rather than flee they're milling around in the hallway in the middle of the night in their nightclothes for no purpose; the Queen's Reader, around whom this film is mostly based, is embroidering flowers for the Queen and talking about which books to read to her. I see where the director was going--they wanted to show the ennui of the French Court, their inability to face reality even when their lives were at stake, and their passivity in the face of loss. Having never done anything for themselves, when faced with a true crisis, they were incapable of making a decision or taking action. At the same time, this was the most Irritating part of the movie! The second piece was the lack of real dialogue. So much more could have been said that wasn't. Even taking into consideration the directors wish to show their passivity, more dialogue could have clarified a great deal and made this a more enjoyable watch.

However, the acting was very good; the costumes were lovely, great camera work. It was visually entertaining if nothing else. The musical score added to the film but didn't overwhelm.

I don't recommend this movie if you're not interested in period films or prefer a lot of action. But it's wasn't horrible and it certainly makes you think about the characters and their motivations.",1451088000,,2203,4.684754521963824

5368363,5,B009TT0BSE,"I thought this was a really good movie, and certainly not what I was expecting! One thing I will say though is for those of you looking for a true ""lesbian film"", then this is not for you. Yes, there is a relationship between 2 of the characters in the movie, but to be completely honest, it is portrayed more like an intimate friendship than that of lovers.

**Minor spoilers ahead**
The idea of being able to see Marie Antoinette's story through the eyes of one of her lady in waiting's was clever. You could see the affection and love that she had towards the Queen as well as her true loyalty. Even though it is made to appear that the love she had towards the Queen was romantically driven, I actually see it a bit differently than that. I think that she was completely in awe of the Queen as well as extremely curious of her relationship with Duchess . It is obvious that she is 100% devoted to the Queen, which is evident throughout the movie, (especially the ending) but I don't see that as coming from a place of a romantic love. Even IF she did have romantic feelings towards her, (and I mean if) I do not think she would have ever acted on them because of her undying devotion.

Overall, I really liked this movie. The actresses did a really good job in making it a believable period piece too. In fact, the lead actress in this also played Emma in the movie ""Blue is the Warmest Color"". The only small negative aspect for me (which is why I didn't give it 5 stars) is that there were some parts that didn't seem necessary for the movie, and other parts I wish they would have given more time and attention to. The relationship between the Queen (Marie Antoinette) and the Duchess would be one example of that. Other than that, I really did enjoy it and I think anyone who likes period films will too!",1450396800,,1812,4.326470588235294

Excellent acting, with subtle nuances that make it worth watching twice -- once to read the captions (if you don't understand French) and once to study the glances and gestures that convey so much more.

The acting was very natural. The script didn't try to keep everything tidy and logical. This flowed beautifully, as if you were there as events were unfolding, never sure what would happen next... or even at the conclusion of the film.

This was a five-star production, except for two points: First, the movie could probably have been about 30 minutes longer and provided a little more depth to a few key characters.

this is the only film I have seen so far, that distills both the nature of life at Versailles and it's downfall to it's essence.

the portrayal of Antoinette is tangibly realistic and ingeniously depicted through the eyes of a young servant girl who seeks to better her station through her unwavering devotion to the queen, but her ambitions reach too high and her efforts come too late to be of any use and she barely escapes catastrophe brought about by her own naivet&eacute;.

the queen does not in fact betray the girl, but merely uses her as a matter of convenience; as she would any other servant.

we witness how each member of the once illustrious court decides in his or her own manner how to interpret and deal with the inevitable calamity that is to befall them; and while some abandon the proverbial sinking ship like rats, others reach for a hope that is no longer theirs to claim, while others submit with a profound acceptance of their fate that rivals Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper.

5368539,4,B009TT0BSE,"**** This movie is in French and subtitled in English!! ****

Many pamphleteers and rumor-mongers asserted that Marie Antoinette had more than just a friendship with the Duchesse de Polignac, and this film is based on the idea that perhaps those rumors were true. Okay, actually it was a book first. I have not read the book (is there an English translation?) but I did enjoy this film. I have seen a ton of Marie Antoinette movies and Diane Kruger is definitely my favorite MA. So much more authentic than other portrayals. She is sensitive and compelling while also being flawed. Many movies portray MA as being either hard and cruel or totally innocent. Diane Kruger walks the line perfectly, shod in the loveliest of slippers.

Hearing French rather than British and American accents blundering over words like dauphin and comte really adds to your suspension of disbelief, not to mention the whole story makes more sense!!! It just helps everything seem more real.

If you enjoy the historical fiction genre or French films, pay no heed to those one star reviewers who don't like to 'read their movies'. A lazy mind would not appreciate this film anyway. Let them watch a Philippa Gregory adaptation. Even if you don't normally appreciate subtitled films, if you enjoy this genre, you will be glad you gave this one a try. The sets and costumes are luxurious, the story is exciting, the acting is wonderful. You won't regret taking a chance, even if the story isn't what you were expecting.

Other reviewers have told you all about the plot of the movie so I'm not going to do that. If I mention anything they haven't, I may spoil things for you. I will just say that I've never seen a French film that wraps up the ending in a neat little bow like Hollywood movies do. It's a little bit unsatisfying for me, as after about an hour I'm attached to the characters and I want to know how everything ends for them. You kind of have to use your imagination. Some people get all bent out of shape over endings like this but I try not to, since it is just a movie after all. If you are frustrated by open endings, you might want to skip this movie.

Lastly... I know very little French, but while watching this movie and reading the subtitles I realized that it was not perfectly translated. Some of the sentences and phrases were generalized or rearranged a little bit. Maybe to better fit the tastes of an American audience? Not a completely different translation that I could see, but it seems some little things were left out. Although, as anyone who has studied languages can tell you, there is no such thing as a perfect translation. Every story will lose some meaning in translation. But even so, this is a great film. I am considering purchasing this now, after having enjoyed the rental so much.",1424131200,21,2803,4.609218436873747

5368543,4,B009TT0BSE,"The film concentrates on the drama of the few days before the fall of Versailles and the last days of Marie Antoinette's court. The sumptuous costumes, wigs and sets are dazzling, with each scene carefully constructed and lit. You could photograph a still image of many scenes and hang them on the wall as fine art. Some of the filming was actually done at Versailles. Unfortunately, the need to concentrate carefully on the English subtitles sometimes draws your eye away from these gorgeous scenes. I had to occasionally replay a scene because I had been concentrating on the visuals rather than reading the subtitle and had missed some critical dialogue.

The plot is primarily centered around the perspective of a young servant to the court, the queen's official reader, named Sidonie Laborde and played by La Seydoux. Sidonie is infatuated with the queen and exists to serve her. She is often seen running through the long corridors of the palace when she is summoned by the queen to read to her. The queen confides in her of her deep love for Duchess Gabrielle de Polignac, which inspires a bit of jealousy in Sidonie.

The queen, played by Diane Kruger, is gorgeous and spoiled and demands constant attention from her court, but is not completely unsympathetic. Her fear and anguish about the uprising outside the gates is palpable, though she seems to have no idea what to do about it. She instructs her staff to pack her precious belongings (many trunks full) to flee to the country, but at the last minute the king decides they will stay. There are very few scenes between the queen and king, so you do not get a sense of their relationship.

Of course, everyone knows how the story turns out, so there is no suspense in that regard, but the film unfortunately fails to make you care about any of the characters to any great extent. We come to care a bit about Sidonie, who is in nearly every scene, but we are not really able to experience her fear or understand her motivations.

The film does a good job of portraying the chaos and disorganization of the court at the end, but almost totally ignores the historical context of the event. Nevertheless, taken on its own as a brief glimpse behind the palace walls during a critical juncture in French history, the film is worth watching, if only for the sumptuous settings and costumes.",1423267200,,2346,4.700729927007299

Farewell my Queen gives a intriguing and gripping POV of the events of July 1789 from a starstruck lady in waiting, who watches the established bubbe of Versailles crumble about her- and with it, her understanding and view of the La Reine Marie-Antoinette. Diana Kruger is brilliant in her role as the self absorbed, kind and ultimately ruthless Queen- a dimension of personality not depicted before. Virginie LeDouyen is a brilliant jewel as the glamorous friend of the Queen, Madame Polignac. But it is Lea Seydoux who really shines as Sidonie LaBorde, a 'reader' to the Queen. We see the palace of Versailles from her view- not the grand apartments, but the tiny rooms of palace servants, the cramped apartments of nobility, the plain food and leftovers that servants got to eat, the buzz and commotion of court. Ms. Seydoux gives us the performance of a ambitious onlooker, LaBorde, who realizes how much change is coming and how noble patrons ultimately regard her.

5368568,4,B009TT0BSE,"I've been watching German born Diane Kruger as an El Paso detective on TV's ""The Bridge"" for a couple years now.  I've been impressed with her performance as well as her memorable role in Tarantino's ""Inglorious Basterds"" from 2009.  This French film never made it to my area that I can recall, but I discovered the trailer watching another movie.

Kruger plays French Queen Marie Antoinette, set on the eve of the revolution.  While the Queen is an important character, this film really isn't about her.  It is about the royal staff that serve the monarchy.  We get a first person account from Sidonie, the Queen's ""reader"" played by Lea Seydoux (""Blue Is The Warmest Color"").  The film's director, Benoit Jacquot, mixes the opulence of Versailles with the dank servant's quarters nearby.  Sidonie has clear affection for the Queen that may even be romantic, but Marie already has a lover in Duchesse Gabrielle (Virginie Ledoyen), so has no designs on her.  Once King Louis XVI decides to ride out the rebellion in Versailles rather than travel to Paris, the Queen's fate seems sealed.  She asks Sidonie to go with Gabrielle and her husband to the country to escape the rebels, but insists that Sidonie portray the Duchess in case they are captured or stopped.  Ouch.

While this story is moving along, the audience is treated to a unique look at the hundreds of people who service the monarchy.  This underground society's social rank appears to depend on the gossip they learn from the palace.  The more you know, the more important you are.  This is a deliberate film, but keeps your attention and is fun to watch.  Miss Kruger is perfect in the role and seems as comfortable with French as she is with German and English.

This Blu ray transfer is encoded with 1080p and has a 2.35:1 aspect ratio.  The Cohen Media Group always seems to produce excellent high def pictures and this is no exception.  It appears that most of the lighting is natural, including dark indoor scenes lit with candles and fireplaces.  Colors are strong, especially in the palace.  Detail if very good including skin tones.  Terrific picture.  The audio tracks include a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 in French.  Although dynamic range is somewhat limited, the surrounds do come into play with ambient sounds including echoes emanating from the vast hallways of the palace.  Subtitles are clear and easy to read.  English is the only option.  Extras aren't great.  There is a trailer and a discussion between the director and Kent Jones of the New York Film Festival.  There is also a number of interviews with the cast in a TV format.",1411603200,2,2610,4.789237668161435

5368588,4,B009TT0BSE,"""Farewell My Queen"" depicts the collapse of the French aristocracy at Versailles palace during the three days after the fall of the Bastille. It is told from the viewpoint of Sidonie Laborde, the Queen's lectrice, a servant whose job is to bring books from the Queen's library and read to her upon request.

Sidonie, brilliantly acted by Lea Seydoux, is a young, clever and talented woman -- ""always reading"" another servant complains about her -- who is in love with Queen Marie Antoinette, while also nurturing a crush on a handsome male actor who works as a boatman on a Venetian gondola that traverses the palace's canal.

We see Sidonie scurrying back and forth, between the servants' lives in the bleak cellars, attic bedrooms and backstairs, and the plush quarters of the Queen, traveling between two lives, like the rats that infest the palace. She slowly learns about the impending disaster -- the bread riots, the fall of the Bastille, the desertion of the King's troops -- from whispered hints in corridors. quick stories in the servants quarters, and conversations of nobles behind partly-closed doors.

People begin disappearing from rooms and apartments where they have been fixtures for decades, quietly fleeing the court. Nothing and no one can be relied on anymore.

Sidonie is gradually drawn into a desperate scheme of the Queen's to save Queen's woman lover, the Duchesse de Polignac, from execution. Sidonie's devotion is exploited by the Queen to place Sidonie in a very dangerous situation.

The details of 18th century dress, etiquette, furnishings and class-linked behavior are meticulously observed, serving as a frame for a painful drama of betrayal and loss.

I gave the movie a ""4"" instead of a ""5"" because I felt that Marie Antoinette was depicted as rather frivolous in some ways, as she had been perhaps 10 years earlier, in 1779.

By the time the French Revolution struck in 1789, Marie Antoinette had reached her early thirties, seen two of her four children die, and had actually drifted apart from the Duchesse de Polignac into an affair with the handsome and honorable Count Axel von Fersen. Marie Antoinette was a much more serious person in 1789 than the movie suggests.

But the details of life at Versailles and the tiny scenes in which life there collapses bit by bit over a three day period were excellent.",1397433600,4,2349,4.944162436548224

The reader is devoted to the infamous Antoinette, and very protective of her. I never really did figure out why however, was it physical attraction?  (I believe it was--but I'm not sure) or attraction to station. I think this lack of development is the main weakness of the movie. As is the case with all in her despicable class, M. Antoinette betrays the loyalty of the lower classes and wantonly uses her reader for her own devices. Perhaps I'm dense (or we were simply tired when we watched it) but I never really grasped the Readers reaction to that betrayal, was she resigned to it, ready to sacrifice for her beloved, was she enlightened, for the first time realizing the truth about her awful mistress, or was it something else. As a better developed juxtaposition of the sensibilities of this era in French history, or a better developed personal story I might have really adored this movie, as it is beautiful to look at, and the acting is marvelous (there is a brilliant scene where Sea Ledoux is forced to strip, with a gorgounous aristocrat attendant hovering about her, where they all do an excellent job conveying the creepiness of the whole structure of their lives).",1394841600,,1387,4.731404958677686

In actuality, it's a plodding film that features very little romance--or excitement--unless you count the suspense of the French Revolution. You know what's going to happen to Marie Antoinette, so they refrain from showing the gory details. Much of the film is spent inside the palace with a rare glimpse into the panic that was felt among the royalty once they knew the people were upset and planning to destroy the aristocracy. In that way, the film gives you a different vantage point.

Diane Krueger portrays a woman struggling to be more intelligent and stronger than her position, upbringing, and education allows her to be. She is suffocating in the judgmental eyes of the court, who may or may not be misinterpreting what we might now simply consider to be a close relationship with a best friend as much, much more. Sidonie, naturally, idolizes the glamorous queen, perhaps understands her in a way that others do not, and understands much more about the court as a whole, providing the audience with a look at the frivolity, fear, and blindness that so many dealt with.

5368618,4,B009TT0BSE,"Les adieux &agrave; la reine (Farewell, My Queen) is a luxurious, visually stunning film about the moments before the citizens of France stormed the Bastille and headed for Versailles. Without a rather thorough understanding of that period of French history the film may leave some viewers confused as to the story line. This film is more about the manner in which Marie Antoinette functioned as a queen and as a woman with needs than it is about a precise description of what was occurring outside the palace walls.

In July 1789, the French Revolution is forming and gaining momentum. Seemingly oblivious to the people of France, at the Chteau de Versailles, King Louis XVI (Xavier Beauvois), Queen Marie-Antoinette (Diane Kruger) and their courtiers keep on living their usual carefree lives. The comparison to Upstairs Downstairs is evident - carried to the extreme. The matter of note is the window into the personality of Marie Antoinette who has been having a lesbian affair with the Duchess Gabrielle de Polignac (Virginie Ledoyen). To pass her time away when the Duchess is not available for assignations, Marie fills her hours looking at materials, fashion books, and she has a lady in waiting reader - Sidonie Laborde (L&eacute;a Seydoux) - read stories to her. The two become confidants and Sidonie is utterly devoted to Marie, knowing that Marie and Gabrielle are in a relationship. But when the news of the storming of the Bastille reaches them, panic sets in and most of the aristocrats and their servants desert the sinking ship, leaving the Royal Family practically alone. Sidonie remains at Marie's side and as preparations for the evacuation of the palace are made, Marie asks Sidonie to disguise herself as Gabrielle and to escape to Switzerland with Gabrielle and her husband dressed in disguise: should the French stop their carriage it would be Sidonie that would be beheaded, saving Gabrielle to return to Marie when the `nasty business outside Versailles is over'. Sidonie does as she is asked out of her devotion to Marie and the film ends with only with words of the results of the historical events (the beheading of Marie in 1793 etc) - a quite subtle and fitting ending to a moment of recreated history.

The film is based on Chantal Thomas' novel and written for the screen by Gilles Taurand and director Benot Jacquot. The costumes and settings are magnificent and the other members of the large cast (especially No&eacute;mie Lvovsky as Madame Campan and Michel Robin as Moreau) are uniformly excellent. It is an interesting look at the characters of French history and though the film in many ways lacks substance it still merits seeing for the period piece that it is.

5368619,4,B009TT0BSE,Really enjoyed this film...the rich costumes and decadence of Versailles are very well done. The contrast of the lives of servants and poverty of the people is portrayed well and is such a glaring contrast.,1369440000,,206,4.914285714285715
5368620,3,B009TT0BSE,"""Farewell, My Queen"" (Les Adieux  la reine) was adapted from the French historical novel of the same name by Chantal Thomas, who wrote of the turmoil in the court of King Louis XVI as seen through the eyes of a woman who was Queen Marie-Antoinette's (fictional) ""reader"". The events take place over the course of 3 days following the storming of the Bastille, 14-16 July 1789. A young woman named Sidonie Laborde (La Seydoux) is employed to read books and plays to the Queen (Diane Kruger) for her entertainment. Sidonie must be familiar with the library at Versailles and attuned to her Majesty's moods. She's very dedicated to the Queen, whom she believes is fond of her in return. But rumors are swirling around the palace about the storming of the Bastille. The royal family is considering flight to Metz, as everyone else tries to understand what's happening.

Director Benot Jacquot decided to make Sidonie a young, sensual woman instead of the middle-aged character of Thomas' book, presumably for commercial reasons. The film is more salacious than the book, though not particularly explicit, and I wonder if that may be an attempt to inject something into this narrative that the audience can engage with, as there is very little plot. ""Farewell, My Queen"" is more a vignette than a story. It provides a snapshot of the anxiety, confusion, and gossip at Versailles, mostly from a servant's perspective, at a time of crisis. It presents the court as isolated from the politics of Paris, to its own peril at a time of revolution. Information was difficult to come by, and even the royal family could not judge with any accuracy where it stood and how much danger they might be in.

The portrait of Marie-Antoinette is unjustly vicious. The film gets her personality completely wrong. Benot Jacquot and co-writer Gilles Taurand present the Queen in the throes of an infatuation with the notorious Duchess Gabrielle de Polignac (Virginie Ledoyen), her manipulative lesbian lover who has made many enemies at court. This is based on disparaging rumors that circulated after Marie-Antoinette's death. The Queen was also rumored to have been the lover of the Swedish Count Axel von Fersen, which is not mentioned in the film. These individuals were close friends of the Queen, but the stories of sexual relationships are unlikely to be true. At one point in the film, Versailles' archivist (Michel Robin) says of the Queen: ""Gabrielle de Polignac is a folly which cost her dearly. She's yet to finish paying for it."" That seems to be true to this day, as people are unwilling to let vicious rumors die.

Although ""Farewell, My Queen"" is a good-looking film, it offers little in terms of plot or socio-political comment, leaving the audience with only the experiences of the characters to relate to. But it remains distant, as if observing the characters' reactions without participating in them. Sidonie is an enigma to her colleagues and to the audience. We know little about her or what she thinks. This is strange, considering that every scene in the film either contains Sidonie or is filmed from her perspective. She's omnipresent, yet we don't understand her. This effectively leaves the film with no point of access. It says nothing and feels nothing. As to the actions and personalities of the historical figures, it's important to remember that this is fiction -though Louis XVI (Xavier Beauvais) might not be far off the mark. In French with English subtitles.

5368627,4,B009TT0BSE,"Much was made in the media of a relationship between Marie Antoinette and La duchesse Gabrielle de Polignac which suggests a same gender attraction as an element of this film. Further, the Queen's reader (described as a lady in waiting in some reviews, but little more than a higher class servant) has an equal infatuation or attraction for Marie Antoinette as the Queen does for the Duchesse. This is really not the point of the movie, though the triangle is used as a device to get to one of the important centers of what I believe the author is trying to convey. Devotion and betrayal, true sacrifice and perhaps a type of love in spite of betrayal. Aside from this, the movie takes some time to develop its themes and has a few shades of ""upstairs downstairs"" (mostly downstairs) view of life at the palace.

The beautiful palace and the magnificent dress are in almost every shot. The cinematography is magnificent. However, they are juxtaposed with the mundane conversations of both servants and masters. This juxtaposition is intentional and strips away all those trappings to focus on life and situation. There are no grand parties. The soundtrack of this movie is not the Baroque, Rococo, or neoclassicist dance music we are used to. It is the klesmatic, slightly disjointed, wandering and wondering of servants who seem the most out of tune with what is happening. Indeed, the movie spends a vast amount of it's time developing as it shows the daily prattling of servants and occasionally masters. The movie is beautiful, but there is no pomp and circumstance here. The servants (particularly Sidonie the Queen's reader) are that ""fly on the wall"", observing. One would think servants would have a greater understanding of what is happening with the masses outside than royals. However, this movie depicts a servant class even more isolated within the grounds precisely because they are not the privileged class. Their worlds are also about to radically change and they strive to ascertain what is happening as they notice the stir among the royals. We also see the more realistic ""come to Jesus"" moments for the royals as they realize what is happening. The publishing of ""The List"" was particularly poignant. The list is a document that details which persons must be beheaded in order to affect reformation in the country. Contrary to what another reviewer called ""an outside view"", this is perhaps the most inner view and frank perspective one could have of life within the palace at that moment. In my opinion, that is the greatest value of the movie over the relationships themselves. That may have not been the intent and I don't know how true to the novel it is. However, the time devoted to that perspective makes it hard to ignore. The greater focus lies there.

Sidonie's predicament develops against this backdrop. She desires an estimation and affection from the queen she cannot have. The Duchasse has it and values it only as a passport to privilege. I can say the greatest single moment in the movie (with a very long setup) is where the final meeting between Marie Antoinette and Sidonie takes place.  Tremendous favors are asked of Sidonie, or demanded however you take it.

There is little by the way of titillation that the media would suggest. I would not even say I was that ""entertained"" by this movie. However, I was impressed. I did ultimately appreciate the viewpoint of life at Versailles that is never presented in movies about Marie Antoinette. I appreciated the irony of Sidonie's situation and the possibilities eventually presented to her. As I mentioned, this is not an entertainment piece. But it is a fairly serious film. Take that for whatever it means to you personally and decide if the movie is for you. I would not normally buy this movie, but I did already before seeing it.  So I guess that's done! I would definitely not have missed it and I will watch it again at least once some day.

Star studded (though Americans will not recognize all the names) and well acted. I would even call this movie MASTERFUL. Yet I was not overly entertained.",1364428800,98,4093,4.823361823361823
5368628,3,B009TT0BSE,"The film covers the months from the 14 July 1789 storming of the Bastille to the eve of the arrest of the royal family that fall. The action, told from the perspective of a favorite servant of French Queen Marie Antoinette, takes place in the magnificent state rooms and gardens of Versailles and in the teaming warren of the below stairs of the palace. Like many French films, it is long on emotion, sexual innuendo, and beautiful locations, but glosses over the facts and the tragedy. It is mentioned that there is little food, but no explanation is offered of the precipitating cause of the French Revolution. The already fragile and mismanaged French economy had been in a severe economic downturn, since the massive fissure eruptions of Icelandic volcano Laki, beginning in June 1783 and ending in February 1784, disrupted global climate, causing acid rains that destroyed crops, and livestock, and created sores on people who worked outdoors and severe winters that froze the Mississippi over as far south as New Orleans and fogs that disrupted global trade. This information could have been worked into the plot through the serving girl's meetings with the learned palace librarian.

The film provides a snapshot of the elegance and emptiness of life at Versailles in its final days, while avoiding the tragedy and ugliness of the French Revolution. In my humble opinion the film ends too soon. It ends well before the frivolous Queen Marie Antoinette holds her 7 year-old son for hours, only to have him torn from her arms to be systematically beaten and starved. In the movie, the children are relegated to one brief scene of the Queen holding them. The little girl will barely survive and the very young prince is doomed to die. The audience could have watched the spoiled Austrian princess rise to the occasion of her imprisonment and death. She may have lived as a frivolous spoiled child, but she died as a mother and queen.

The tension created by the unrequited devotion of the Queen's servant who was her official ""reader"" contrasted by the queen's seemingly intimate attraction to another woman who was a duchess of the royal court, emerged as the main dramatic theme, set against a background of the gradual dissolution of the monarchy due to disloyalty and fear of reprisal. The two leading characters, the queen and her loyal reader, were excellently portrayed. However, little sense was given as to why the populace was up in arms against the monarchy, nor was there the slightest indication of any arrogance and disregard for her subjects by Marie Antoinette whom everyone knows famously quipped,  ""let them eat cake"" when the populace complained there was no bread.

8544296,5,B009TT0BSE,"You've got to be in the right kind of mood to fall in love with this movie. If you're looking for action or entertainment, you don't get any further than watching La Seydoux slip and fall a couple of times. This film explores the casual superficiality with which Marie Antoinette plays with the lives of her servants, in contrast to the loyalty of her servant Sidonie LaBorde. What motivates her to be willing to risk her life for this queen?
If you are looking for an introspective engagement with some intriguing characters, watch this film. It is a spell-binding study in love and commitment--both real and the pretended.
If not, you best look elsewhere.",1507075200,,657,4.771929824561403

Lovely to look at but poor soundscripting, unnecessary emotional weight given to rather minor details, I actually fell asleep for about half of it.....which is probably how I finished it at all.",1505088000,,252,4.883720930232558
