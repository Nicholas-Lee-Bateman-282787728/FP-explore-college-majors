8196269,5,B000QGE81U,"I bought this movie for my niece who is in a ""zombie"" phase.  I don't know if she'll like The House on Haunted Hill or not, but I've seen it.  I love both movies.  Night of the Living Dead is my favorite zombie movie.  The orginal version of House on Haunted Hill is much creepier than the remake.  Two great movies at such a low price is an unbeatable bargain.  It was kind of like buying one movie, getting the other for free.  So even if my niece isn't a fan of ""House"", I feel the cost of the movie was worth it for just ""Night"".",1300838400,,533,3.9716981132075473
8196270,1,B000QGE81U,"Neither of these movies were shot in 3-D. None of the attempts to 'remaster' or 'convert' them into 3-D have been anything but annoying eye-strains.

Save your money, and avoid this DVD like the plague. It's another snake-oil-salesman attempt at cheating you out of your money.

Both of these movies are classic black & white horror and well worth watching, without the extra eye strain. Buy them in their normal DVD versions.

House On Haunted Hill can be found on DVD (ASIN: B0009X75DI), and it was also recently remade in 1999. You can even get both the classic old House On Haunted Hill (with Vincent Price) and it's new remake on a single double-sided DVD for the same price (ASIN: B000FOPPBU).

Night Of The Living Dead has also been remade (more than once) ... Most recently in 2006 and actually shot in real 3-D (not the fake '3-D' on this eye straining DVD). The original version of the movie is a classic, and you can find it on DVD (ASIN: B00005Y6Y2, and many others) in a clean new digital re-mastering, with extras. Or, you can buy it in a double feature DVD, along with Carnival Of Souls, another classic black & white horror movie, for double the enjoyment (ASIN: B00005Y6Y2).

The remake version of Night Of The Living Dead that was actually shot in 3-D (2006) isn't available yet on DVD, as I'm writing this review. So you may have to wait to watch it. Maybe they are waiting to release it on HD-DVD in anaglyph 3-D (red/cyan 3-D glasses), which is how it was seen it's official theatrical release. (Though, it did have it's premiere showing using nicer polarized projection at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood -- so a field sequential 3-D DVD release of the remake could be possible).

Which ever way you want to see these classic movies -- this fake 3-D DVD is the worst!",1182297600,11,1791,4.598746081504702
