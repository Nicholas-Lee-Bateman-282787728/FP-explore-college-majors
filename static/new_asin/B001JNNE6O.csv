3658377,5,B001JNNE6O,"Very well done.  Again a doc that really follows the star Quincy with great interviews by the singers that he's worked with during the
years and fantastic input from himself and younger brother about his past.  Very intense!",1393804800,,224,4.868421052631579
3658378,5,B001JNNE6O,"May our world never forget the hardships and tribulations our most sacred and improvisational jazz artist endured with color lines for breakfast, or a ride to the next gig, or the segregated conflicts just going in and out the back door, or no bathrooms, and YET, the clever animal of JAZZ intuition, ever preys in their souls to find the directions that EXPRESS, that life lives in every note!!",1389657600,,395,4.739130434782608

3658380,5,B001JNNE6O,"Just finished watching it and I never ever stop being amazed of the music history and legends he has worked with. Sad to know the people in that movie of the legends who speak highly of him, including MJ are no longer here... I also liked how he kept it real about his relationships and marriages and personal & mental health impacted his career.",1276041600,,346,4.421875
3658381,5,B001JNNE6O,"This is enlightening to anyone who's ever been a fan or can appreciate the music of Michael Jackson, The Brothers Johnson, Chaka Chan, Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra, or Dinah Washington.  Quincy transcends musical excellence and in this film, it gives some insight into how the man became the man he is; and, also some musical insight into what brought him there.",1269993600,,360,4.901639344262295
3658382,5,B001JNNE6O,"The cool cat with nine lives is music legend Quincy Jones.

From humble beginnings on rough streets to icon status on Fifty-Second Street, Jones takes us back to the beginning and SHOWS us (doesn't just TELL us) his life story in this lush, musical and incredibly creative documentary. Flmmaker Ellen Wiesbrod gets so close to Quincy Jones, capturing so many moods and rememberances, that you can almost hear him think and breathe and grieve. Like great jazz, the film itself jumps with raw energy. One of the most creative pieces of moviemaking I've watched in a long time--and it's a decade old! Well worth digging up the VHS player to experience. Five stars.",1231113600,,661,4.849557522123894
3658383,5,B001JNNE6O,"This is an incredible documentary about an amazing man.  The film takes you on a ride through the histroy of jazz while telling the story of the phenomonal genius and versatility of Quincy Jones. The movie, and the life it reflects, are structured like a fine jazz number, layered and intricate with a rythem and flow gracefully linked by a unifying theme. Quincy Jones is high on music and life. Do yourself a favor and... Listen Up!!!",1038268800,4,436,4.662337662337662
8313132,2,B001JNNE6O,"Although the film is essential viewing for a fan of Quincy Jones, and has a huge amount of archival footage assembled, it remains hampered by very discursive and disjointed editing that makes the film quite difficult and frustrating to watch at times.  For example, at times, multiple speakers talk over each other. The film often jumps between time periods. At times, there may be one cut every quarter of a second. It doesn't suit my taste, but since I really wanted to learn more about him, I forced myself to schlep through the film.",1474156800,,537,4.712765957446808

8313139,5,B001JNNE6O,I have seen the documentary before and truly loved it.  I rented it for a musician friend that was visiting from the other side of the world and he had the same thoughts.  It is incredible the way this man has seen and shaped and made his mark in musical history.  He is a genius!,1419379200,,280,4.054545454545455
8313140,5,B001JNNE6O,"This is an incredible insight into Quincy Jones and it breaks the barrier, pushing you to stop viewing Q (as he's known) as an icon and Mythical Figure of your imagination.

This breaks the information down and you realize that Q is a product of his time and, when you look deeper, you realize that YOU can be a product of your time.

You need this in your life if you want to know more about Q!",1416700800,,395,4.116883116883117
