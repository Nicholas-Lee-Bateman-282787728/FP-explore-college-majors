8037986,4,B00063MCPM,"In the aftermath of the Soviet invasion and civil war, hundreds of thousands of Afghans fled across the border with Iran. There they struggled to survive, offering themselves as day labourers at exploitive wages, harassed by officials and just ignored by the bulk of Iranian society. Mohsen Makhmalbaf's 1987 film BICYCLERAN (""The Cyclist"") is an allegory for the Afghan refugee experience,

Nasim (Moharram Zaynalzadeh) must pay the hospital stay of his ailing wife and bring up his son Jomeh (Mohammad Reza Maleki), but even backbreaking labour as a well-digger doesn't pay the bills. When a local business learns that Nasim once rode a bicycle for three nonstop, he offers the desperate man the chance to save his family: ride a bicycle for a week in a makeshift circus ring.

Makhmalbaf communicates Nasim's lack of humanity by giving him very few lines. Most of the film consists of arguments among the gamblers and local politicians who stand to profit or lose from Nasim's act, as in the background he circles around and around and around. This film would already be heartrending if it were a straight-up tale, but Makhmalbaf makes it even more poignant with a light dusting of magic realism.

Though less elegant than some of his later films like NUN VA GULDOON (released internationally as ""A Moment of Innocence""), this is a memorable film and it's easy to see how it established Makhmalbaf's reputation internationally. Iranian cinema holds many delights, and this is one of its triumphs.",1320451200,,1499,5.036290322580645
8037987,5,B00063MCPM,"This film catapulted the rapid rise of ths talented director respect an issue rarely told. It's about the unthinkable perversity a human being is capable to do taking advantage of the misfortune of others.

A very humble man has emigrated with his family in search of a better fate. His young wife is pregnant and in urgent need of a doctor who treats her.

Lacking resources, for how to become a money and go to a ruthless mercenary who owns a street show of fun and frivolity.

Since in early youth, he was a great cyclist, makes a Faustian deal with that miserable human parasite. He must pedal for a whole week without sleep to do their part of the deal. In case of leave for any reason before the time is fulfilled, the contract is void.

Creepy, brutal and devastating in its proposal. One of the best film productions of the decade of the eighties.",1315612800,,855,4.461538461538462
8037988,3,B00063MCPM,"Iranian film director Mohsen Makhmalbaf's 1987 film The Cyclist (Bicycleran) is one of those odd little films (a mere 78 minutes in length) that, technically, is not that impressive, but whose narrative makes it worth watching. Makhmalbaf wrote and directed the film, and also may have edited it. Its technical merits are few, save for the spare screenplay. There are, however, no greatly structured scenes, no effects of any note, and the most interesting shots are those of the lead character on his bicycle and another character riding a motorbike around and around in a pit.

The acting is nothing noteworthy, because all involved were likely amateurs. And, again, the camerawork by cinematographer Ali Reza Zarin Dast is nothing special; even the occasional quick cuts look more the works of error than planning. But, in just this first film of Makhmalbaf's that I've seen, one can discern that he's likely to be a more daring filmmaker than his main filmic rival in Iran, Abbas Kiarostami. That leads me to my final comparison of this film, and that's with some of the earlier film work of German filmmaker Werner Herzog. The ends of films like Even Dwarfs Started Small and Stroszek are certainly an influence, if not directly, than certainly in some collectively unconscious way. Yes, Herzog's two films are, overall, more polished, but especially Even Dwarfs Started Small shares a zeitgeist with this film. It is as if the films take on lives apart from their directors' wishes.

  The DVD, put out by Image Entertainment, is of solid video quality, although the audio leaves much to be desired, in places. It has no English language dubbing, and only white subtitles (against the color background), for only 85% or so of the dialogue. Oftentimes this is the result of a bad job by the producers of the film, but, given the low budget feel of The Cyclist, it could just as well be that the translators found much of the banter between minor characters, and moments of byplay simply were not worth the time and effort, artistically nor financially. That's a shame, because some of the more revelatory moments in film come from the sotto voce moments between characters. There are no special features whatsoever. And, while I mentioned the audio quality being bad, that is something that may be the fault of the DVD company. What is the fault of Majid Entezami, who did the soundtrack, is the bizarre usage of musical interludes, often at inappropriate places, and often with music that is more Indian than Persian.

  Yet, despite its flaws, The Cyclist is a film worth watching again. Sometimes the rawest of art forms can strike deeply into the percipient, not so much for the brilliance of its polish and skill, but just for the strength of its plunge, and the sharpness of its edge. This film is one of those films. It is not great cinema, technically nor purely, but it is a worthwhile piece of art that distills the pros and cons of humanity in a universal way, as well as specifically detailing the hues of those pros and cons to a specific place and time. Would more films and artworks do so, in a similar manner, both art and politics would benefit. As it is, only the audience of Mohsen Makhmalbaf's film benefits. Good for them, and better for Nasim, and all those like him, who rarely get to see films, much less be the stars of them.",1282694400,,3355,4.754295532646048
8037989,5,B00063MCPM,"This remarkable film from the Iranian ""new wave"" mixes Sydney Pollack's dance marathon film ""They Shoot Horses Don't They"" (a clip of which is seen on a TV in a cafe) with a good deal of Fellini-esque imagery to produce a distinctly Iranian social critique. Director Mohsen Makhmalbaf retells a story from his youth in which a poor man raises money by riding a bicyle for days without a rest. In this film, made in 1987, the man is a poor, unemployed Afghan refugee with a hospitalized wife. Rescued by his young son from committing suicide by being run over by a truck, he allows himself to be billed as a one-man circus act, riding in a circle for a week while a crowd gathers, wagering on his ability to endure to the end.

At the start, the film cuts between a vigorous game of buzkashi, as horsemen compete over a headless goat, and a gathering of refugee day-laborers attempting to get work digging wells and ditches. A motorcyclist rides endless circles inside a big drum for paying customers who watch from above. There are shots of crowded Tehran streets, hospital visits to the cyclist's desperately ill wife, and the cycle-riding endurance test itself, all of it mixed together with moments of farce, documentary realism, hallucination, and heavy melodrama.

In several dream-like sequences, boys in prison garb throw red and white carnations from a balcony at the cyclist, a crowd of the elderly and dying and another crowd of shrouded lepers are brought to witness the spectacle. A gypsy woman tells fortunes, a referee watches in a track suit, and a doctor and nurse attempt to drug the cyclist, while tacks and nails mysteriously appear on the track. Meanwhile, the soaring music and the close-up shots of the exhausted cyclist bring to mind images of the Passion of Christ from any number of Hollywood biblical epics. Eventually, the media arrive with cameras and shouted questions to swarm around the cyclist like a pack of dogs.

This film is best seen along with Abbas Kiorstami's film ""Close-Up"" about a young man so taken by this film that he assumes for a while the identity of the director and winds up in a Tehran court charged with fraud. For anyone interested in Iranian cinema, a must-see.",1270857600,2,2216,4.765625
