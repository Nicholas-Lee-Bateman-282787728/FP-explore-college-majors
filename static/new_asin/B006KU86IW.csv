8500211,3,B006KU86IW,"I have to agree with other reviewer.  While I applaud the effort, the production quality was suprisingly low.  While the presentation covered a geographically broad range of Texas cowpunchers, the history is flung at you rapid fire in about one 3 minute segment.  I actually had to pause it, step back and try to determine what I had just heard.  What's missing here is depth.  As already stated, you really don't get any insight into the cowboys at work.  Absolutely concur with annoyance in having Waddie Mitchell pop up towards the end.  He belongs in a completely different segment, different planet rather.  Sort of goofy when all is said and done, though I can see what they were trying to accomplish using Mitchell as a means for constrast; just came off goofy.  Should I ever feel tempted to watch another, I'll definitely check the credits.",1357171200,,849,4.8
8500212,2,B006KU86IW,"I was really disappointed with this video. The low production quality really shows. Much of it looks like it was filmed with a cheap pocket camera. Lots of bad edits. Lot's of history on Texas, cattle and ranches but most of it doesn't correlate with the historical or modern cowpuncher and how he was shaped. Very little time was actually spent showing cowpunchers doing their work. Also, Waddie Mitchell, Queen of the Buckaroos, really shouldn't have been included is this video. It seems he was included purely to make snide comments about the cowpuncher way of doing things. I haven't seen any of the other videos in the series and after watching this, probably won't.",1355788800,,672,4.852173913043479
8500213,5,B006KU86IW,"i love all the movies to this series, this movie i like, it shows that it is not about all the show and glow. Rather about the man that can do the job at hand.",1326585600,,159,3.5714285714285716
