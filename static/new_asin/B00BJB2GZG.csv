8569417,4,B00BJB2GZG,"4 stars for Red Rock West one of my favorite new-noir films. Usually not a Nicholas Cage fan but this one was too fun for Me to pass up. So I forgive him his limited facial expressions and delivery. A good story, decently acted.",1521590400,,228,4.204545454545454

8569419,3,B00BJB2GZG,"I watched this movie (Red Rock West) a long time ago and remembered it being better than it was... it is watchable but don't get your expectations up or you will be disappointed.  I bought it in the set because it was cheaper than the individual DVD but, be advised, it's one of those irritating, ""unlabeled"" DVD's so if you store it outside the jacket it can be a pain.",1441929600,,370,4.285714285714286
8569420,1,B00BJB2GZG,NOTE: The Red Rock West discs are defective. This was true for BOTH copies I bought but we didn't figure it out until the return window closed.,1430352000,,143,4.333333333333333

8569422,5,B00BJB2GZG,I basically bought this because I wanted a second copy of RED ROCK WEST which is definitely a 5 star movie. ADAPTATION is a nice addition to this package.,1402099200,3,154,4.344827586206897
8569423,5,B00BJB2GZG,"Red Rock West is a personal favorite.  Dennis Hopper is great, and Laura Flynn boyle / Nic Cage are great with a story with a lot of twists and turns.",1373587200,5,150,4.0
