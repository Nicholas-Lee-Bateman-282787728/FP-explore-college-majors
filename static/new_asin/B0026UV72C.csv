8353607,2,B0026UV72C,"I ordered this because Word World is unfortunately no longer playing on my local network and my boys love, love this show.

Unfortunately, what is advertised is not what you get! I expected Castles in the Sea, and what I got was a DVD with various cartoons (Sid the Science Kid, etc) and only ONE episode of WW - and it wasn't even the episode advertised.

Also, it says 2 pack, but I only received one DVD.

The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of just 1 is because the seller was easy to work with and gave me a full refund when I expressed how unhappy I was.",1501891200,,570,4.117117117117117
8353608,5,B0026UV72C,"My kids absolutely love this DVD .. it's nice to be able to have it handy to watch, instead of having to wait until the slot time on TV..

Can't wait for more titles to come out!",1274918400,,178,3.810810810810811
