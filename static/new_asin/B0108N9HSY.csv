7306640,3,B0108N9HSY,"Angelo (Chris Mulkey) runs the LA gun dealing syndicate. He uses Haitians as his muscle. Rhyis (Amin Joseph) is the leader of the group of effective killers. Angelo has a tumor and little time to live. He anoints Rhyis as his crime heir to the dismay of his coke-head son Nicolas (T.J. Hoban). This creates issues. In addition Rhyis brother has been in contact with their long long father, who is also a very bad man.

The film is rather long. It includes a subplot with Bai Ling which really doesn't connect well with the film and might have been added just to get a hot Asian chick on the DVD cover. One of the reasons for the length of the film is the extremely long orations and dissertations they have for conversation. Our bad guys are educated and speak clearly without the urban slang and often speak symbolically.

The film does have killing, gun play, and one-on-one fighting but the lion's share of the feature is  R.L. Scott lecturing the audience on the 10 stages of civilizations to a woman's self confidence to chess playing to bourbon aging.

8721608,5,B0108N9HSY,"Absolutely awesome crime drama with explosive gunplay and Martial Arts scenes. Basically, the leader of a Haitian hit squad becomes the temporary head of an Italian mob family without their blessing. Meanwhile, his diabolical father has returned to reclaim his top-dog street status and now, our anti-hero has two armies to deal with. Call Me King is the best urban-themed dvd surprise since Blood and Bone. I keep ordering copies for my friends to own also. This movie rocks!",1482624000,,476,5.037974683544304
