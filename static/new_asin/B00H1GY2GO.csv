8629116,5,B00H1GY2GO,"I bought this for the bonus Lucille Ball interview.  I wish it was the entire episode, but even still Lucy's segment appears complete.  I would love for Carson Entertainment Group to release some of Lucy's other appearances on ""The Tonight Show""...preferably complete and unedited.  Maybe even a DVD compilation with some of the other Lucy cast member interviews, if the footage exists.

The DVD menus are very cleaver and appropriate.  I also love that the episodes have the option to watch with or without the original commercials.  I wish more vintage TV DVD's offered this option.

Thank you Carson Entertainment Group.  I hope more releases are to come.",1391385600,2,658,5.027777777777778
8629117,5,B00H1GY2GO,"Two more episodes (plus a bonus extended clip) all within two weeks' time in December, 1975.  There is a caveat with this one, regarding some ""minor video imperfections"" -- apparently, the only source video they had available wasn't in perfect condition, so any distortions you see (and they are minor) are from that and are not defects in the disc.  The distortions are only here and there, not constant; it's mostly brief flipping at the top or bottom of the picture, as with a videotape that needs the tracking adjusted (the liner notes mention the distortion only in the 12/5 show, but there was also a small amount late in the 12/12 show as well).  But it doesn't take away from the fun.  If you're a Gallagher fan, you'll enjoy seeing his ""Tonight Show"" debut; no Sledge-O-Matic, but lots of props and a weird performance, just the same.  The product description pretty much covers the rest of what you'll see.  I'm glad to see this series and look forward to seeing what is released next.",1390262400,3,995,4.6571428571428575
