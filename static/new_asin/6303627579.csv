7852114,1,6303627579,"NOT A LOT OF MONSTER TRUCKS.  MORE TRACTOR PULLS, MOTORCYCLES, MUD RACING AND EVEN SHOOTING A WOMAN OUT OF A CANON.  BOUGHT THIS FOR 4 YEAR OLD GRANDSON AND WAS NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.",1019865600,5,188,4.194444444444445
7852115,5,6303627579,"Our three year old became obsessed with monster trucks from the ""There Goes a Truck"" video, so we bought him this. He cannot get enough of it! He watches it spread out on our bed, surrounded by his little play monster trucks, and he imitates the actions going on in the video. I cannot explain this phenomenon, but if you have a monster-truck loving preschooler, this is definitely a must-have. It has music (think of music video style), it is not overly narrated, and it mesmorizes my son over and over. Money well spent here!",1007856000,8,527,4.557894736842106
