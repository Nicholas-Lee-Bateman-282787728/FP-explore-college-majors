3713749,4,B00078GL0S,"Although the film is very dated and everything (the acting, the directing, etc.) reflects that, I've always enjoyed it because of the history and the use of both archival footage and some real WWII aircraft, especially Spitfires. I first saw it when originally released in England in 1953, and the heroism of the Maltese people (and of course, the military) was still fresh in everyone's minds. Although she's not mentioned in bold letters on the poster, we all fell in love with Muriel Pavlow, who played the love interest to Alec Guiness. She featured again in Reach for the Sky, the Douglas Bader story, in 1956: she wasn't considered the leading star then either, but she was to me!
From what I can tell, the history portrayed in this movie is fairly accurate, and since it was filmed in Malta, it certainly looks authentic. But I suppose the Spitfires are the real stars. I've been to Malta about five times, and I always watch this movie again before I go!",1464220800,,962,4.6647058823529415

As to the movie. The battle for Malta is, at least in the USA, an essentially unknown topic. Thus, when I found this on Netflix, I had to watch it. The story is an inspiring one, upon which I will not dwell. Aside from the historical value (the movie clearly employed LOADS of wartime footage), the acting, production, and photography were all first-rate. Star Wars fans who only knew about Alec Guinness thanks to that series, but want to learn more about this incredibly gifted actor's work, should give this movie a view. Actually, I cannot recall ever seeing a bad performance from Sir Alec.",1452902400,,706,4.559055118110236

3713805,4,B00078GL0S,"I liked this 1953 quasi-document about the siege of Malta during WWII. It is very well done and moving - the only thing which I found weaker was the romance. Below, more of my impressions, with some LIMITED SPOILERS.

Malta, 1942. The hardest moments of the terrifying siege, which lasts now since more than two years. Bringing in the supplies by sea is now harder than ever and Italians and Germans bomb with unprecedented vigor airfields, ports and towns. Flight Lieutenant Peter Ross (Alec Guinness), an experienced photo reconnaissance pilot, stranded in Malta on his way to Egypt, ends by being assigned to one of RAF squadrons there. He soon meets Maria (Muriel Pavlow), a young Maltese woman working in the RAF operations room and they become close... And then the film really begins.

As already said, this is a quasi document, with fictitious characters being more a pretext to show the reality of life (and death) during the siege, than real heroes of the film. The hardships endured valiantly by the defenders and the sacrifice of those who brought supplies through blocade lines are the real subject ""Malta story"". The most dramatic and tense moment of the fillm is of course the convoy battle which raged in the western Mediterranean from 3 to 15 August 1942, better known as operation ""Pedestal"" (Italians call it Battaglia di Mezzo Agosto and to the Maltese it is known as ""The Convoy of Santa Mariya"", as it arrived on Assumption Day). The scenes with the tanker ""Ohio"" (the most crucial element of the convoy), a ship which was really martyred (there is simply no other word) are purely incredible in their intensity. The fighting spirit of the defenders, shown in many, many ways, including some defiant graffitis, is also perfectly shown here. This is a very moving, tragic but finally very uplifting and optimistic film.

The only thing which I liked less is the character played by Alec Guinness. The director ordered him to play a man who is more than calm and stoical - he is introverted and indifferent to the point of being completely cold and ultimately unlikeable. It hurst the romance aspect of the film because it is impossible to detect any kind of interest (let's not even talk about passion) in this guy. It probably makes him a good oficer and a great pilot (and before war a good scientist) but also a singularly uninteresting cinema character. Sir Alec Guinness was a great actor - it is a real pity, that here he was hardly allowed to act.

This film has considerable value as a quasi document, as it allows us to really feel what it was to be one of Malta defenders in thyose terrible years 1940-43. As a fiction on another hand it doesn't work that well. still, I am glad that I bought and watched this film and I will keep the DVD for a future viewing. ENJOY!",1442793600,,2798,4.680894308943089

It is poignant, with the love story of the British Flight Lieutenant and the young Maltese woman.  It shows how frequently relationships are developed and then destroyed in the throes of war.  The role of the Mother showed incredible strength of character, both in acknowledging her son as an Italian spy, and confronting the Lieutenant and asking him to wait to marry her daughter until the situation in Malta stabilized.

3713818,4,B00078GL0S,"Looked at as a movie about the gallantry of the people of Malta during WWII, this movie deserves five stars, but looked at as a love story it is somewhat lacking. Sir Alec Guinness as Ross falls mildly instead of wildly in love with Maria, making the story much more realistic than such sudsers as ""Stairway to Heaven,"" aka ""A Matter of Life or Death,"" but his doubts about the relationship---can he support her without giving up his archeological field work and can she adapt to a life away from Malta---give the movie a certain flatness. Realism is all very well, but movie watchers expect to pull out at least one hanky when the love scenes come along, and that never happens.

I can still clearly recall my reactions when I watched this movie as a 25-year-old college student. I simply couldn't empathize with the grand old British tradition of expressing emotion by not emoting at all.

I'm referring to the attitude of ""I say, old chap, this situation is so totally terrible that my face must remain totally expressionless."" This ""cement face"" routine only works if you're brought up to respect the special tradition of acting by not acting, and most people today can't understand it.

As a younger viewer, I just couldn't feel very much emotion about what was happening in this movie. The people on the screen didn't seem to care about what was going on, so why should I? The bizarre ending, where a catatonic Guiness pointlessly flies onward to his death when he could easily have hidden his plane in the highly visible clouds and survived, makes about as much sense to me as a Japanese Kabuki drama where the actors wear masks.

Movies like this dusty antique can prove that film is not always a universal language. The culture of the times is built into each and every 35mm frame, and when the culture has vanished, a film can become meaningless and even laughable. I personally want more from a war movie than lots of planes flying around, and this film just doesn't deliver.

If a Monty Python type of comedian ever redubs this movie, it could be turned into a comic masterpiece. ""I say, old fellow, I think I've got to fly away and die now."" ""Really, old thing?

3713885,4,B00078GL0S,"The Malta Story, 1953 film

Malta is a small island in the Mediterranean southwest of Sicily. It was an unsinkable aircraft carrier and port for the British during WW II. It held out against bombing attacks by Axis forces. It was supplied by shipping convoys, who also supplied Allied forces in North Africa. This movie uses Malta as the background for its drama and romance. You will see Spitfire fighters (armed with 20mm cannon instead of eight .303 machine guns). You can see a flight of JU-88 bombers as well. There was rationing and food shortages in wartime.

There is drama from a captured spy with a radio transmitter. The defense of a supply convoy can shorten the war against Rommel's Afrika Korps. You see actual photos of attacks against a convoy. The captured spy confesses his mission is to locate the fuel depot so it can be bombed. He is the brother of a woman who is involved with a British officer! The attack on a British convoy sinks ships. Civilians seek shelter from bombing. Spitfires attack enemy bombers to defend their convoy. Fuel is critical for their needs. They must defeat Rommel at all costs. Submarines attack an Axis ship.

It is important to find the Axis convoy so it can be attacked. Fighter pilot Ross alone is sent to find it and radio back its position. [This will put him in a perilous position.] He succeeds in locating the convoy in spite of very cloudy weather. The end of his radio transmission tells of his crash. This news allows the enemy convoy to be bombed and damaged. We see two engine bombers drop torpedoes against enemy ships. Then newspapers report the victory at El Alamein!

Malta was a serious thorn in Rommel's side as it lay right across his supply route and in the end it was his deteriorating supply situation plus the strong build up of the British supply position (with American tanks being newly available etc) that ultimately led to the victory at El Alamein.  But the often understated thing is the stoic attitude of the Maltese people who also took a pounding with endless bombing.  Their story is also one of heroism and it should be recalled that Malta's full title is Malta GC  (the entire island was award the George Cross for bravery).

Combat footage spliced into the film adds realism.  Americans can cheer with the British when the USS Wasp enters the Med to launch Spitfires to reinforce Malta.  When the charred and battered tanker SS Ohio, kept afloat only because it is lashed between two British destroyers, sails into the harbor with its cargo of fuel, it's not only the British and the Maltese on the screen who cheer.  You will too.

After you watch the film, you'll want to know more about the actual battle.  If you consult Wikipedia, ""SS Ohio,"" ""George Beurling,"" and ""Siege of Malta (World War II)"" will get you started.  The film is stirring, but it could only tell a small part of the story!

This 1953 drama does its best to do the story of Malta justice. Following RAF pilot Peter Ross, who becomes stranded in Malta while on a transport bound to Cairo, the movie looks at the British soldiers, sailors and airmen who persevered during the Axis air raids and the Maltese people who suffered from shortages during the blockade and the bombings. Although the pacing of the film suffers at times, the cast (led by Alec Guinness) give great performances. The movie was filmed in black and white and so it is difficult to tell how much of the combat footage is historical and how much was shot at the time with surplus Spitfires, radars and guns. While the movie lacks the grittiness of war films of the 1960s or the special effects of films made after the 1980s it is well worth watching if you can find it.",1313280000,,1254,4.623318385650224

3713894,4,B00078GL0S,"Despite the fact that it stars British superstars Alec Guinness and Jack Hawkins, THE MALTA STORY (1953) probably would have worked better as a documentary, rather than a dramatic feature.

The island of Malta, lying between the south of Italy and North Africa, was vital to the British supply lines during WW2.  Bombing raids by the Axis powers were an almost daily occurrence, and the people of Malta endured near-starvation and mass destruction from those brutal raids.

Newsreel footage provides a vivid picture of the island's ordeal in THE MALTA STORY, directed by Brian Desmond Hurst.

The filmmaker's have also tried to create a compelling human story, with Guinness cast as a pilot photographer, forced to stay in Malta when his transport to Cairo is destroyed.  There is a romance between his character and an island resident (Muriel Pavlow), who works with the British Army, and another intriguing storyline is introduced, but never fully developed, when her brother turns out to be an Axis spy.

Script-wise, the problem is that the story for the survival of the island is far more moving than any of the predictable human dramas created by screenwriter Nigel Balchinor.  His characters are rather two-dimensional, and the actors supply the only real spark in them.

3713895,5,B00078GL0S,This is a very interesting story about a photo recon pilot who got stuck at Malta enroute to Egypt. Much of the film appears to be authentic scenes of ships blowing up and bombs being dropped on Malta. As usual Alec Guiness is first rate.  Many of the British period actors are in the film whom you will recognize. I liked it a lot.  It is a much better film than many war flicks even though it has a lot of models being used in the air action.,1308096000,,444,4.034090909090909

Directed by Brian Desmond Hurst

VCI brings another great film from the British Invasion, as the British are coming
shown in the BONUS PROMO.

Most of the action is seen through the eyes of a very young Alec Guinness, a reconnaissance photographer stranded on Malta en route to Egypt. While on the island he romances a local girl in between hazardous flying missions. A no-frills account of the siege of the Mediterranean island of Malta during WW2. Much weight is given to the courage of the islanders in the face of appalling hardships, for which the island was awarded the George Cross by the British.

Viewers are drawn into the emotion and circumstance of the onscreen drama unfolding. Calling it a ""stiff upper lip"" may be one easy way to deal with the visual honesty, of those who are caught in a life and death situation.

Action score by the great composer William Alwyn gives this film a powerful documentary feel to it.

Near the final scene Guinness is requested by Hawkins to give location of the fleet and the
look on both actors is priceless, drama at it's best - unforgettable.

Overall, a very tense and well-written film that is great for history and aircraft buffs.

3713897,5,B00078GL0S,"The film `The Malta Story' is a great tribute to both the British and the Maltese soldiers including civilians, were both got involved in the hardship of this historical island.  Both the British and the Maltese soldiers fought to keep Hitler of ever invading Malta.  If Hitler managed to invade Malta, history could be much different.  During the non stop bombings over the strategic places on the island, such as the airfields and the ports, which were constantly bombed.  Fortunately the film was made when parts of Valletta and the three cities, on the other side of Grand Harbour, where actual evidence of war were still there.
The three worst instances when Malta was so hard hit were, The Attack on the Aircraft Carrier `HMS Illustrious', which for more than 24hours it was continuously attacked while it was being repaired in Grand Harbour.  (A Tribute to my father who during those attacks he was a gunner on one of the anti-aircraft guns which surrounded Grand Harbour. Luckily he survived the ordeal and continued firing on the German Luftwaffe till the end of the war).
The other; was the ordeal of the most welcomed convoy especially the tanker Ohio.  Most of the footage seen in the film was authentic as were also the scenes of Maltese praying and waiting for the convoy around the harbour.  If it did not arrive, Malta could have had to surrender.
Then there was the arrest of that Maltese who was caught spying for the Italians.  He used to be brought close to Malta; I believe in a submarine, and then paddles in a dingy towards the island of Gozo.
I don't want to forget, that Malta received the George Cross for bravery from King George of England; of which we are so proud.
Malta is just 120 sq Miles (320 Sq Kilometers; a floating rock; but it has a very big heart and an incredible history.",1305072000,,1813,4.626168224299065
3713898,5,B00078GL0S,Review for movie only..not quality of DVD........this is the story of a pilot played by Alec Guinness who is flying photographic missions off the small island of Malta during WW2. Filmed on location this shows the results of the year long siege by the Nazis and the effect on the islands people. King George awarded the George Cross to the entire population of Malta for their heroism and their fight to defeat the Nazis. Script is somewhat limiting and acting is not what we have come to expect from Sir Alec...however...this is must see for all those who like movies about WW2. I like the movie for it's historical value and to put the human toll of war into perspective.,1299801600,,673,4.616666666666666
3713899,4,B00078GL0S,"The island of Malta is less than 60 miles off of the southern coast of Sicily, and from Britain's heyday as a global naval power before the time of Horatio Nelson through WWII it was an important British naval base and part of the British Empire.

This small island lies in a strategic position where planes based there could harass enemy supply lines that stretched between Europe and North Africa and the Middle East.  It is a little known fact that Malta went through a Luftwaffe and Fascist Italian air force blitz for an extended period of time during the war.  This is the story that is stuff of this film.

THE MALTA STORY was filmed during the 1940s and highlights a very young Alex Guiness who plays a photographic reconnaisance pilot.  Jack Hawkins plays the commander of the British RAF at Malta.  Throghout the movie Malta is under seige.  Axis forces are trying to strangle Malta into submission by destroying conveys that carry food, fuel, and military equipment needed at Malta.

I thought that the use of archival footage from Malta, including post-bombing footage, as well as footage showing air-to-air combat from the ground was also a nice touch.

You should be prepared, however, for that characateristic British stiff-upper-lip approach to dealing with adversity.  This film did, of course carry important propoganda messages to the British home population, but it still tells the importand story of what happened at Malta.

This is a solid show, 4 stars.  I'm glad I watched it.",1287619200,,1500,4.8853754940711465

3713901,4,B00078GL0S,"Malta is known as ""the George Cross island "",the George Cross being the highest award for bravery by civilians within the British Commonwealth .The island was  rewarded for its collective heroism in World War Two when it staunchly resisted the efforts of the Germans to bomb it into submission and occupy the island .This movie recreates the assault and siege in a quiet, restrained and dignified manner. It is a clear eyed unsentimental movie that ,being shot on Malta itself,brings fully to life the hot,rocky and beautuful island that has so often been the crossroads of conflict .

The main character is ""Ross""(Alec Guinness) an air reconnaisance officer/photographer forced to land on Malta and bearing witness to and becoming involved in the attempts of the islanders and the British forces to repel a German invasion .the movie cuts between the civilians involved and the British military personnel ,in particular the Air commanding Officer ,played with customary skill by Jack Hawkins ,and the naval commander Banks (an excellent performance by the under-rated Ralph Truman).Nor does it neglect to pay due tribute to US assistance in the form of the carrier Wasp ,which brought much needed Spitfires at a crucial time .

Yet what one will most remember from the movie is the heroism of the civilian population -the quiet grave faces of the islanders as they endure privation and demonstrate resolve and fortitude .There is one particularly fine scene of children quietly playing in the street as the air raid sirens sound and a raid takes place.

Guinness is not at his absolute best and acting honours go to Dame Flora Robson as a Maltese mother whose children experience the contrasting fortunes of war ,and to Muriel Pavlow as a Maltese woamn with whom Guinness falls in love

Well directed by Brian Desmond-Hurst and shot in crisp monochrome this is a quietly compelling study in heroism ,civilain and miltary ,and reminds us that freedom has a high price sometimes -a message lost on the simpering jellyfish operating under the degraded name of liberalism",1197417600,,2068,5.035087719298246
3713902,5,B00078GL0S,"Some may think that old war movies can not be compared with the modern ones because of the lack of super high-tech effects and millions of dollars which current productions have in ambudance. Although it is true that no old movie can give you the terrific visual effects of ""Saving Private Ryan"" they do have some advantages, especially when the theme is about World War II. First of all, they were closer to the real time of the war, thus the heroes, the faces, the mentality, the materials, the surroundings and even the language are much more realistic than any modern director could ever hope for. ""The Malta Story"" belongs to this category of excellent old British war films, picturing the drama of the besieged Malta in 1942, through the story of a young RAF reconnaissance pilot strandled on the island. There are fine scenes of air battle, of the terrible bombardment by the Luftwaffe and the convoys' desperate efforts to reach the island. The story of tanker ""Ohio"" of the ""Pedestal"" convoy is especially well presented. Those old days the director had numerous authentic Spitfires at his disposal and he used these legendary fighters in a marvellous way!",1165795200,,1165,4.85929648241206

3713904,5,B00078GL0S,"What more could a man ask for in a War Film? What with the following: A small strategic island that lays in the way of the enemies supply line. A ruthless, cunning enemy doing its best to put it out of the fight. The British loyally doing their best to supply the heroic Maltese with huge losses of men and ships in the process. (We even helped out with the loan of the Aircraft Carrier Wasp to deliver some much needed replacement Spitfires.)

  A good love story and some really strong actors who seem to be at their best. That and for the time some very good special effects with a ending you don't expect. Altogether a tape that is well worth the coin. I just hope that the DVD comes out soon!",1114387200,,697,4.225563909774436

3713906,4,B00078GL0S,"The Malta Story is well worth watching, for it provides the viewer with a good, overall history lesson of the battle for Malta.  That the British were able to hold off a German invasion on this small, isolated island testifies to the strong spirit shown by Great Britain throughout World War Two.  In some ways, it reminds me of the battle for Corregidor, which was actually taking place during the same time.  Of course, the circumstances and outcomes were different in both battles.  By watching this movie, the viewer comes away with an appreciation for the sacrifices and casualties endured by British soldiers and sailors, in addition to many Maltese civilian deaths.
One interesting aspect about the battle for Malta is that it was one of the first times in the war that the United States used an aircraft carrier - the USS Wasp ferried RAF spitfires from Britain to Malta.  These aircraft were vital for the island's defense.  The movie honors the United States for the use of the Wasp with a fitting performance of the Star-Spangled Banner.
Alec Guinness does a good job portraying an RAF photo-reconnaissance pilot.  His character is warm and sincere.  The other British characters are quintessentially British, stiff upper lip and all.  The woman who plays Guinness' love interest also gives a good performance.  She was quite beautiful and rather charming.
The action scenes are fun to watch, and are quite good for a 1953 film.  All in all, The Malta Story is a good war movie that showcases an important part of World War Two history.  I highly recommend it.",1001289600,,1571,4.842696629213483

If you can ignore the ultra low-budget special effects and enjoy the acting of Alec Guiness, Jack Hawkins, and a fine supporting cast, you'll enjoy it. Also, the film doesn't shy away from depicting the extreme hardships and heroism of the Maltese population in the face of relentless aerial bombardment and starvation from blockade.
