5715611,5,B00CD45IYO,"I enjoyed watching this series when I could catch it.  Matlock's good-old boy country charm and practicality reminds me a lot of my grandfather.  I could tell that things happened before the episodes, but due to my hectic schedule never was able to follow it when broadcast.  I am thrilled to find this show in a single set so I'll be able to watch them in order.",1384300800,,363,4.388059701492537

5715615,5,B00CD45IYO,I have all 9 and they are all clear and good quality. the series is just fun to watch such a great actor. I do wonder if some were not recorded as I saw several on TV that are not on a disc. Can watch over and over and still enjoy,1376611200,8,230,3.5294117647058822
5715616,5,B00CD45IYO,It is great to finally have all of the TV shows in my possession.  I have always loved Matlock and am very sad Andy Griffith recently died.,1376352000,3,139,4.148148148148148
5715617,3,B00CD45IYO,"I've been a Matlock fan for many years and looked forward to purchasing the complete series which included Seasons 8 and 9.  I love the series, and it has been fun to see episodes that I missed.  I have two complaints.  The primary complaint is in the viewing quality of the discs.  Although I am still viewing Season 1, I have spot checked all the discs through Season 9, and all are very grainy rather than sharp and clear.  There is no comparison to the quality of the Columbo series that I recently purchased through Amazon.  The only other negative to the purchase of this series is that it does not come in a box for storing the cases.  I'm not sorry that I purchased the series because I am enjoying each episode, however, I do wonder if there might be a better quality product available.  If not, then purchase the series and enjoy!!!",1376265600,80,842,4.422077922077922
5715618,5,B00CD45IYO,"I have this complete collection of ""Matlock"" and ""The Andy Griffith Show"". Great shows both of them. Recording so far is great.

5715621,1,B00CD45IYO,"Let me be clear:  This review is for the DVD product, not the actual show.  Loved these Matlock shows, but the picture and sound quality here is ridiculous.  These appear to be nothing more than someone copying their old VHS collection onto DVDs with a vintage GoldStar combo machine.  Some of the tracking is off, resulting in static lines and jumpy images, and ghost images that make Andy Griffith and everyone else look like they have four sets of teeth when they talk.  I feel like I'm wearing drunk goggles.

Then there's inconsistent volume from one episode to another.  Headphone users beware!  Also noticed some distracting ghostly ""precognition"" sounds--those sounds you hear in the background and then 20 seconds later they show up in the actual show where they belong.

Overall, I'm glad for the chance to see these great episodes again after all these years!  But I have to say, I'm getting rather fed up with the desire of these studios to make a quick buck rather than provide the consumer with a quality product.",1521676800,5,1027,4.784090909090909
5715622,5,B00CD45IYO,"One of my favorite Andy Griffith series to date.  I love watching him as Ben Matlock, the gruff, but love able Atlanta attorney for the defense. Often taking on the worst cases and when all hope is lost, Ben comes out a winner!",1521504000,,227,4.27906976744186

5715628,1,B00CD45IYO,"So.  Matlock, great show.  These discs, not so great.  The picture quality is poor, as if someone transferred VHS tapes recorded off the air to the DVD.  I.E. I believe these are bootlegs.  Sadly, because of the holidays, I didn't start watching until it was too late to return them.",1518912000,,283,4.58

5715658,5,B00CD45IYO,I liked this series from end to end. I really like Andy Griffith in anything he did. He was very versatile. Even with the cast changes it was a very solid series. The one exception was Billy. He was so annoying. I can't figure out why the writers didn't have him as a semi-recurring guest.  Good series regardless.,1498694400,,314,4.413793103448276

Before I purchased I thought well, one of our older actors completely outside of his usual roles, but he is great as Ben Matlock.  Another older actor in a similar role is Buddy Ebsen as Barnaby Jones,  I finished watching those DVDs last week and that set was great as well.",1493510400,,355,4.253731343283582

5715665,3,B00CD45IYO,"Although it has significantly aged, I still love the actors in these series; the plots are not very strong but acceptable.
My biggest disappointment is that all seasons 1-4 are NOT subtitled, although advertised otherwise. It is a problem for non-native English-speaking persons. It is examplified in the very first episode, where the sound quality is just awful; I couldn't grab a single word out of the big-chested voice of the radio host, because it was horribly distorted.",1492732800,,476,5.115384615384615

5715670,4,B00CD45IYO,"I loved Matlock when it came on in the 80s and early 90s.  My whole family always enjoyed watching it, and we really wanted to own it all these years later.  This release is probably as good as it's going to get.  The number one issue I have with it is that it's a CBS release, and we all know the tragedy that is Beverly Hills, 90210 as released by them.  They always give that little disclaimer about changing music and omitting certain scenes, so you know it will be different from the ones you saw on TV.  I haven't found any particular issues with Matlock yet, but I haven't been all the through the collection, so we'll see.  Also, if you have an HDTV, the picture won't look crystal clear because these haven't been remastered, at least not up to today's standards.  Still happy to have it, though.",1488240000,,805,4.3624161073825505

I even bought the newer version (2015) at the suggestion of a previous comment and still had issues. I also had discoloration on the discs that I had problems with( about three, before I stopped checking. (This was very disappointing because I LOVE Matlock.

5715677,4,B00CD45IYO,"I enjoyed the series when it was on tv, and it holds up pretty well. In watching it in 2016, I was struck by how generally white the casts are, which would be atypical of Atlanta. I also would note that the DVDs now come in 3 packages. Seasons 1-4, 5-8 and 9 are grouped together. The DVDs are secure, but one does have to do a bit of shuffling to keep them in order when taking them out and putting them back in.",1482796800,2,413,3.9285714285714284

The DVDs seem to all be okay though. The quality is not very good on a lot of episodes. It looks as if we are watching them on VHS or an antenna with quite a bit of static. It's not so bad that it is unwatchable and it doesn't bother me very much, but the husband gets annoyed with it. Still a good show though.",1482710400,,489,3.8514851485148514

5715700,5,B00CD45IYO,"PRO:
This is one of the best TV shows ever made. The complete series comes in 3 plastic cases, 2 that hold 4 seasons each. We started watching the series a month ago and are on Season 4 and so far all the discs have played well. If there are any issues to report, we'll update this review. This is a good lawyer show in that Matlock not only sets out to prove his clients innocence but goes the extra mile to actually solve the crime for the Police. It's very cleverly done. What amazes me is that when Matlock puts it all together he spins a yarn (or so it would seem) at the trial that has the prosecution always objecting about how irrelevant the line of questioning is, but Matlock needs to get the person he is talking to to deny something so that he can catch them in a lie and prove his clients innocence.

CON:
The large plastic cases have to be handled with care, else the pages will come loose. That's the only bad part of the release. I would have preferred individual cases for each season to make it easier to find the disks and play them.

TIP:
We hold the case at a right angle instead of like a book and carefully thumb through the pages to get to the next DVD. So far this hasn't resulted in any broken or loose pages.",1470009600,6,1235,4.141666666666667

5715765,4,B00CD45IYO,"Edit alert! I reviewed this box set below but am adding to it as an update. I am now on disk 5 and the quality of this set has improved vastly. The first disk wasn't very good, quality-wise IMO, but the later shows have shown a marked improvement. I just wanted to update my review in the interests of fairness. I have also updated my rating to the 4 stars this set deserves. It's not a perfect box set, especially since it has no subtitles or closed caption option, but giving it 3 stars was a bit unfair and this truly is one of my favorite sets now. Great show!

I just received my complete set last week and have seen the first two disks. Reviewers who have said the quality of the picture is pretty weak are, unfortunately, correct, and shouldn't be mocked or given negative comments. The fact is that the picture, even on my new high grade Blu-Ray/DVD player is a bit grainy and I also see lines once in a while at the top of the screen which look exactly like the lines I used to see on my pre-cable TV when the reception was weakened for a few moments. It honestly looks like it was taken from a VHS recorder and slapped directly onto the discs from them.

That did disappoint me since I love Matlock enough to have purchased this complete set for around $88. Granted, for the entire set, in chronological order, I consider it a bargain since there are an amazing 195 hour-long episodes here. Okay, so they are actually around 48 minutes each because of the unfortunate reality that many, many commercials are a fact of life these days. Still, 195 episodes of that length is a LOT of material for the price! I am giving this complete box set only 3 stars for the reasons I just listed, but there's also one last reason I give what I consider to be a 5-star TV show only 3 stars. This is the sound quality, coupled with the fact that there are NO subtitle options. The sound quality is not terrible by any means, but it isn't very good either. The sound quality seems to go hand-in-hand with the video quality and makes the episodes I've seen thus far seem even more like a copy of a VHS tape of the show. I can't see where this set has been restored, re-mastered or cleaned up at all. Subtitles, or at least closed captions for the hearing impaired, are becoming a standard nowadays, yet this set doesn't include it, which is not only unfortunate for those hard of hearing but even for us regular folks since the sound quality is mediocre at best, and I have had to rewind the shows now and then in order to understand what was said at times. Not often, mind you, but without subtitles, once seems often and twice seems endless.

I love Matlock and very much wish to give this complete set 5 stars. I do like the way it's packaged, seeing as there are so many discs (which are one-sided, which is another plus), but I just feel like the overall video and sound quality is lacking. This show is not that old and I have no doubt there are very good quality masters from which CBS had to draw. These episodes do not appear to be cleaned up any more than a VHS copy-of-a-copy is.

Matlock = 5 stars!
Audio and video quality of this box set = 2 stars.
Overall I give it 3 stars and hate myself for doing so, because I love Matlock. I am trying to give an honest review, though, so this is the best I can do. Sorry if you think my rating is low. After all is said and done, I think this is a below average release of a classic series. This great series deserves better treatment.

I can't believe that this product is so highly rated here on Amazon.  I give it two stars grudgingly only because I can watch as long as I want to see Andy Griffith become a troll in long shots...hazy in medium shots...and only clear  in close-ups.  I sent the first one back because I thought it must be a lemon but the replacement is no better.  I would say buy only if you really want to see the show again, otherwise hold off for a better release, but it's up to you.
I know I'm keeping the second one only because I don't know how much time I have left to enjoy the mysteries and I certainly don't have time to wait for a better release.  The only saving grace was the price.

It took me about six months but I got the opportunity to enjoy once again every single episode of this highly entertaining series.  What I enjoyed most about this series is that there is a minimum of violence and very little in the way of sexual innuendo.  This is definitely a series that grandparents can enjoy with their grandkids.  I found that as the series wore on the quality of the shows did not diminish one little bit.....even in the ninth and final season.  Andy Griffith obviously enjoyed the role and it was fun to see the great Don Knotts guest star in 17 of these episodes.  There is a touch of humor in a lot of these shows and every once in a while some great music.  If you are a fan of classic TV, courtroom dramas, or family-friendly shows then I highly recommend this package to you.  Best of all you can now purchase the entire series for about 1/2 of the price I paid to buy them separately.",1428537600,52,1124,4.470588235294118

5715782,5,B00CD45IYO,"Andy Griffith is best known for his starring roles in two very popular television series, The Andy Griffith Show (1960) and Matlock (1986). Matlock is an American television legal drama, starring Andy Griffith  whose hair has now turned much grayer than when he was sheriff of Mayberry. And Don Knotts has a semi regular role, starting in season 3 through season 6, usually he's wearing a cap to cover his now balding pate - this was before being bald was in style.

 Andy Griffith (1926 - 2012)  Spouse (3)
Cindi Knight  (2 April 1983 - 3 July 2012) (his death)
Solica Casuto  (11 June 1975 - 1981) (divorced)
Barbara Griffith  (26 August 1949 - 16 October 1972) (divorced) (2 children

 Don Knotts  (1924 - 2006)  Spouse (3)
Frances Yarborough  (2002 - 24 February 2006) (his death)
Loralee Czuchna  (12 October 1974 - 1989) (divorced)
Kathryn Metz  (27 December 1947 - 17 March 1966) (divorced) (2 children)

My favorite moments are when Andy plays the accoustic guitar and sings folk or gospel songs - he does some in this series. His decision to end Matlock  in 1995, was because he wanted to spend more time with his family. He would reprise his role one more time, with Dick Van Dyke, in a 2 part episode of Diagnosis Murder (1993) in 1997.

5715789,4,B00CD45IYO,"The whole season of matlock was good. Season 1 was excellent. I could not wait for season 2. Season 3 was good and season 4 was good but there were some very boring episodes when they changed private investigators. It really messed up the flow of season 4 to have the private investigators switched in between seasons like that. But once I got used to the new private investigator season 5 and 6 was good. Season 7 ended with a bang and made me buy season 8 and 9. Season 8 was good but it started to slow down in the excitement. I found myself slowly feeling like Matlock had lost a little of it's touch. Season 9 was well played and thought out episodes. But I thought they should have been in season 8. Season 8 was good but they gave us some slow not so thrilling episodes as the Seasons of Matlock did before. Season 9 brought on the very well out episodes when the season was ending and we needed that in Season 8 and then 9 should have really went out with a bang. But overall I like Matlock. It made me think, it kept me entertained and it sure beat the repetition and drama of reality TV. Matlock was so peaceful I fell asleep a couple of times because I would stay up and watch episode after episode until I could not keep my eyes open. Well worth the money spent.",1423094400,,1274,4.182926829268292

The complete series of Matlock has been something I have been hoping would show up as a gift for a while.  I finally bought it for my husband to give to me as a gift and watched several episodes a night when possible.  The quality was worse than I thought it would be, but it didn't cause me to stop watching at all.  In fact, after the first season I didn't even notice that it was the older quality video.  Andy Griffith was one of my absolute favorite people to watch when I was growing up and I love the fact that I can now watch this show whenever I want.

(I enjoy finding the mistakes in filming) But seriously, enjoy watching Andy Griffith and especially the musical talent sometimes portrayed on episodes. I also have the old ""Mayberry"" Andy Griffith boxed set. Something to be said for a series filmed in the 50's and 60's still being shown on TV today and being watched.

With the advent of 14-18 commercials between scenes, much of many episodes were shortened ""to fit"" the time-slot required.  These episodes are fully complete, which thrills the heck out of me.  There are just a plethora of gems (deleted scenes) which have enhanced each episode so far.  And I've seen Matlock episodes (the first three seasons in general have run, re-run, and re-re-run on several channels, many, many times in the last 20-30 years.) often, enjoying  each.  Plus there is the added bonus of seeing actors providing excellent performances in their earlier days:  Lawrence Pressman, David Froman, Hector Elizondo (brilliant actor), Titus Welliver (brilliant in his part in RED, excellent in BOSCH), Robin Thomas (who could forget Halloween Town plus the many dramas and comedies he's given credence to, way before my favorite family film), Gary Frank (who introduced us to dual personalities: excellent)--the list is too long.  The quality of performances is worth every cent.  Buy this set!",1530230400,,1308,5.1084905660377355

8580383,4,B00CD45IYO,"I loved this show because I love legal dramas and this show had the extra entertainment features of slightly quirky characters, kitchen table wisdom, and clever courtroom antics. Andy Griffith's portrayal of Ben Matlock is simply the best depiction of a brilliant ""country"" lawyer ever committed to film. I must warn future buyers that this set has had some playback issues, skipping frames on my BluRay player. The Seller, Mighty Silver, was unable to offer a solution, nor an exchange or refund. The DVDs work okay on an older non-BluRay player, but it's an inconvenience not to be able to play them on all devices. I guess I should be glad this complete set of a classic older TV series is available at all.",1524441600,,710,4.733870967741935
