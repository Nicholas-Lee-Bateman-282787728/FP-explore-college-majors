6602785,5,B00MW52KJ0,I liked this series a lot.  The plot line is interesting and the actors deliver the goods.  Max Riemelt shows that he is a really good actor.  I've seen very few German shows; will check more of them out as they come along.,1419379200,10,223,4.1395348837209305
6602786,5,B00MW52KJ0,"This was an amazing drama. It was, of course, a German production, but its subject was the strange ethos of the Eastern European and Russian criminal elements that have apparently immigrated to the boom-town of the unified Berlin and their less than savory interaction with Berlin law enforcement and commercial enterprise. The writing, music and acting were superb.",1416614400,22,366,5.327586206896552

8674999,4,B00MW52KJ0,"""In the Face of Crime"" tells the story of a Russian-Jewish cop in Berlin, trying to advance his career all the while facing resistance from the Russian mob, his immigrant Jewish family and unsympathetic German culture; while trying to catch his beloved older brother's killer. Marek Gorsky is called a ""musar,"" or scum by each of the three groups for being a member of the police.

Still, Marek and his partner, Sven Lottner, are trying to move from the mundane City Police to the more exciting LKA, State Criminal Police and manage to get themselves temporarily assigned there. Soon they are tangling with the Russian mob, only to discover that Marek's brother-in-law Misha is involved. Then Marek finds that one of the shady characters he saw at Misha's Russian restaurant is a major suspect in LKA's case against big-time cigarette counterfeiters and smugglers that they are investigating and is also a suspect in his brother Grisha's death.

Simultaneously, two very pretty Ukrainian village girls, Jelena and Svetlana, wanting to improve themselves in Germany's economic powerhouse, succumb to an offer to work in a  ""good restaurant"" in Berlin, whereupon the two immigrants are forced into the sex trade.

Early success in the LKA soon changes as betrayal joins revenge as a major theme. Marek and Sven are betrayed by corrupt LKA officers and Marek has to question how much his sister knows about her husband's illegal activities. Furthermore, Marek learns that his uncle Sascha, once a major crime figure in the East, knows who killed Grisha but will not violate his criminal code of silence. Meanwhile, Marek keeps running into Jelena in the course of his investigations. The attraction is both mutual and immediate but can they trust each other: he is a ""musar"" and she now a prostitute. Jelena, on the other hand, trusted Svetlana when they left Ukraine but Sveta had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen.

The two story lines parallel each other for a few episodes before Marek's place in the interplay of cultures is so inextricably intertwined in the middle episodes that, but the last two episodes, the writers had a hard time trying to tie up the loose ends. There appear to be some missing scenes or poor editing and resolution for some of the many story threads devolve to explanatory dialogue rather than showing the action.

That said, the ten episodes make a pretty good story which moves along at a brisk clip with few slack areas. It consistently holds the attention, like so many Mhz imports; though one cannot help but wonder if the active process of reading the subtitles invest the viewer more into the story than the passive act of just viewing. ""In the Face of Crime"" was directed by Dominck Graf, a very big name in German media but not outside his native country. It was first shown at the 2010 Berlin Film Festival to a very enthusiastic response and since appeared at other festivals, even though it was originally written for TV. Director Graf has stated that he sometimes had the Corleone Family of Godfather fame in mind while developing the family drama portions.

This ""policier"" or ""police movie"" is well made with heavy use of Berlin and its environ; a consistent strength of Mhz imports. It is well-acted by the quite large and interesting cast. The two male leads are very likeable and worth rooting for as are Jelena and Svetlana, and Marek's equally attractive sister.  Many of the cast have that youthful, too-young-for-their-role freshness, that infests soap operas the world over. Except, however, the Russian bad guys, with their shaved heads, thick lips and big noses, the actually reminded me of the Nazi-era Jewish stereotypes.

This ten episodes series is far more HBO than PBS. Parents should be aware that there is a LOT of nudity, some sex scenes and a fair amount of four letter words. Almost every hour and half episode would be R-rated if the MPAA had jurisdiction. Adults, however, will find this a lively binge-worthy program",1458000000,,3995,4.889217134416543
8675000,1,B00MW52KJ0,Watching this series one might think that you have to be twenty-five and gorgeous to be on the Berlin police force.  A cast of Gen Y international crime fighters...?  Could not suspend disbelief.,1447459200,,195,4.878787878787879
8675001,5,B00MW52KJ0,"Those beginning to find that TV crime thrillers and police procedurals---even those from the School of Scandinavian Noir---are becoming increasingly hackneyed, with situations and their resolution seen many times before, will be delighted with the originality and energy of this German series.  Set mostly in the Berlin underworld and fascinating in its interplay of cultures---immigrant Eastern European Jews, Russians, Ukrainians, and Rumanians, all seeking their place in the new Germany through fair means or foul---the series is also striking in its novel take on conventional crime, its sometimes intriguing treatment of both love and sex, its frequent dramatic turns which surprise, and its occasional flashes of outrageous humor.  Not perfect, but fresh and very entertaining.",1443657600,5,784,5.808695652173913

8675007,3,B00MW52KJ0,"Could and should have been much better:
The idea and story line are good and topical. Cross border crime is prevalent nowadays. The acting was very good, and one can empathize with the characters. Unfortunately the writing was not up to par with the subject matter. The writing is rather sloppy and some very preposterous/unlikely events are portrayed. On top of that, while this story should be suspenseful up to the end, the opening montage at the beginning of each episode gave away the denouement of the story. It depleted the series of much suspense. I won't go into further detail, lest it might spoil the the pleasure of future viewers.",1421107200,12,643,4.801801801801802
