416084,2,6302035163,This is supposed to be a zombie movie but it is so badly dubbed that is is over the top laughable. it does however have some neat set designs and creepy music but the mother/son scene was a bit much. i watched it twice. the second time it was on a new video and you could acually see what was happening. maybe thats one reason this movie gets so many bad reviews because on the old copies you cant see anything. on the new print you can. there are a few creepy scenes like when the zombies trap a maid and so forth but its basically worth watching if you know what your getting yourself into. pure cheese and nothing else.,1070409600,2,622,4.148760330578512
416085,4,6302035163,"I am a fan of the eurohorror genre, but I even found this to be campy... but its still fun. Horrible dubbing and acting, and the lighting is preety bad in a few spots but I still love this movie. It has great entertainment value and preety good zombie makeup. I like romero's or fulci's zombies better though. I never wouldve guessed the same guy who did the make-up for zombie did it for this.... or a girl directed this one. I found bob wanting to have sex his mother to be hauntingly disturbing. By the way, this is the only movie I have ever seen where a womans breast nipple has been bitten off. I found myself laughing during alot of this, because it does have that un-intentionall comedy to it. The gore is excellent as well. The regular joe, would most likely hate this movie and so would your average ""scream"" fan. All in all, if you like eurohorror, zombie/cannibal movies and bad films that will make you laugh, get a copy of this.",1044057600,,942,4.357954545454546
416086,4,6302035163,"The year 1980 brought us many horror films including Cannibal Apocalypse (another Gianetto de Rossi special effects gore flick), Death Ship, Friday the 13th, City of the Walking Dead (d Umberto Lenzi), Macabre (d Lamberto Bava), Eaten Alive (d Lenzi), Maniac, Motel Hell, The Gates of Hell (Fulci), Dr. Butcher MD, etc.  This 1980 Italian film is the follow-up to Lucio Fulci's Zombie 2 (1979), although directed by a different director (Andrea Bianchi - a minor director of sexploitation and suspense movies) both films attempted to capitalize on the success of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead. In spite of that, both are superior zombie gore movies with Bianchi's Burial Ground a more pathologically regressive film than Fulci's Zombie 2, if you can imagine such a thing!  ""Burial Ground""(also circulated in Italy as La Notti del Terrore aka Zombie Horror aka ""Zombie 3"" - Fulci actually ended up releasing his own sequel to Zombie 2 also called Zombie 3 but that is a different movie and not nearly as good as this Zombie 3 - confused yet?) foregoes the tedious plot and narrative that weighs down the beginning of Zombie 2 and is devised with the intention of staging as many gruesomely visceral events as possible. The rotting undead (spewing maggots and worms!) emerge from an opened Etruscan tomb and invade a weekend sex party at a country mansion.  The violent carnage continues unabated from there. Special effects master Gianetto de Rossi handled the zombie make-up and gore for both Zombie 2 and Zombie 3, so both films have the same morbid, grotesque feel to them once the mayhem starts - these Zombies are the best and most repulsive of any ever to be seen in a low budget gore flick! Just a few of the gory events include a beheading, a crucifixion, bear trap, nail through hand, and the ripping away of a well endowed woman's bare breast nipple (must be seen to be believed) which almost out-does the eye gouging scene from Zombie 2. The violence is more directly sexual, the victims more attractive and the overall effect more satisfying than Zombie 2. Must agree - probably the best Zombie film ever made - would like to see the unrated version if one exists - let me know! Only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is the non-stop gore becomes almost monotonous after the first hour!",1022544000,,2306,4.745635910224439
416087,3,6302035163,"To properly critique this film I will attempt to rate all of it's elements separately.
Entertainment Value: *****
This is a very entertaining movie that moves at a fast pace. The best part is that the zombies are twice as clever as the humans. The undead concoct plans to outwit the characters, like tapping on the left shoulder then standing behind the right one. The humans fall for it every time.
Storyline: *
Thank goodness there where other zombie films made before this one, otherwise you wouldn't know what the heck was going on! This is basically derivative of all the better done, and known zombie films of the 70's, with some totally bizarre twists thrown in to keep us guessing. The script is very disproportional, and the dialog is awful. Basically, it would be very challenging to write a script this bad ever again!
Production Value: *1/2
This movie exerts almost no directorial style, and has the class equivalent of an 80's [...] The gore and makeup is done with very little, or no attention to detail, so it's hard to believe that the same guy that did the make-up effects for Fulci's ""Zombie"" did the effects for this film. The image looks murky and the camera compositions are undesirable. Also, the crew is seen once, for certain, and the dubbing is sloppy. However, I should note, that some of the soundtrack is pretty good.
Acting: 1/2
The acting is completely overdone, and definitely one of the funniest parts of the movie. I found myself gleefully anticipating every line!
So there you have it, a very entertaining, very bad movie. Possibly, one of the most entertaining films I've ever seen! Check it out!",1022025600,,1631,4.746478873239437
416088,4,6302035163,"Boy, sometimes reviews just completely miss the mark! I've actually seen many web reviews proclaiming 'Burial Ground' to be the worst movie ever made, a disaster, etc. While there's no doubt the acting is pretty bad and the script is essentially non-existent, it's a great zombie movie, period. Nobody watches a zombie film for character development, a deep plot, or great acting. I watch zombie films to see great-looking zombie fx, grisly killings, creepy atmosphere, and anti-Hollywood endings, and 'Burial Ground' delivers big-time on all counts.
Yes, the plot has a few holes, but is far from terrible.. A professor or archaeologist-type invites a group of friends up to his mansion for the weekend. The night before they arrive, he sets out to fool around in a nearby, ancient Etruscan tomb. He awakens the long-dead Etruscans, apparantly by smacking the walls with a hammer, although the inference would be he caused the corpse's awakening by crossing the threshold of their sacred burial ground. He's overcome by the zombies, and appropriately has his innards ripped out. His friends arrive to find the good professor missing, and his servant/butler lets them in. After a few obligatory sex romps & silly banter, the zombies descend upon the mansion, ripping everyone apart in gruesome fashion, with the newly-dead rising to join the massacre. That's it. For what the movie is, that's all you need.
Despite claims to the contrary, the zombie make-up is outstanding, with a few hokey-looking ones now & then. These are the ancient dead, and they look every bit ancient. They are worm-ridden, rotted, dusty husks of terror. Yes, when struck in the head with a stone, the skulls shatter like pottery. I wouldn't expect a zombie that has been dead for thousands of years to explode in a pool of blood when destroyed. These suckers are smart too, which is a great twist. Once the zombies trap the victims in the mansion, they begin using axes, hammers, and even a battering ram to get into the mansion for some fresh meat. Pretty cool! The gore effects are good as well, although the VHS copy is a bit too dark at some points. Good news is that an uncut DVD version is in the works. The film does borrow heavily from Lucio Fulci's 'Zombie', even throwing in an impaled eyeball on  a shard of glass. The mansion & its grounds create a creepy atmosphere, and although our victims manage to take out quite a few zombies, the horde seems to keep coming. As the hopelessness & despair deepens, no happy ending is visible. In the end, EVERYONE gets taken out by the zombies! Beats the cliched, typical 'heroes win' storyline in most of today's poor horror efforts. There is a weirdo plot device I must mention, however. One of the victims has a young son, who for some reason is portrayed by an elvish actor who appears every bit of 35-40 years old, and has an incestuous desire towards mom. After dying and returning as one of the zombies, he takes a 'bite' out of mom. Has to be seen!
'Burial Ground' gets right to the point. Roughly 15 minutes in, it becomes a complete zombiefest. The stirred undead attack, and we are never forced to sit through silly dialogue or plot twists. The monsters don't become secondary to idiotic character development. As a zombie film, it rocks! Those looking for character depth or storyline are in the wrong genre. If you are a fan of zombie films, this is a must-own. Don't believe the naysayers. 'Burial Ground' has suffered undeserved bashing. In my opinion, it is a more-enjoyable movie than 'Day of the Dead' or 'Tombs of the Blind Dead'. 'Burial Ground' is an extremely underrated zombie film, don't be swayed by poor reviews. You'll miss out! I found my copy ...in a clearance bin at the video store, and feel it was a complete bargain! I can't wait for the DVD version to be released!",1013817600,8,3825,4.743243243243243
416089,5,6302035163,"Okay, okay, so I know it's supposed to be a horror movie and all, but this is seriously the funniest movie I have ever watched in my entire life.  It's one of those so-lame-it's-hilarious movies. If you can actually watch this entire movie without laughing, congratulations to you, because I know I couldn't!

416120,4,6302035163,"""Burial Ground"" is the epitome of Italian zombie films. The film utilizes the ancient Etruscan civilization as the origin of the zombies. In the opening scene, a Rasputin looking professor is killed before the opening credits. Several couples come to visit at the house near the mausoleum providing us with a steady flow of victims.

The zombies in this feature have missing eyes and maggots. They utilize a slow zombie walk, a walk perfected in Haitian zombie movies, created before the foot drag became popular and a must. These zombies can also use simple tools like a battering ram.

And PLOT SPOILER...if you think you have seen this film before and can't place it, it is the one with the classic scene of young son Michael taking a bite out of mom's naked bosom.

A fun film in a campy kind of way. Not for serious film watchers. For those who want to learn more misinformation about the Etruscan civilization from horror films, try ""Neverlake.""

416121,5,6302035163,"This version may be better than and prior DVD release, but that is not saying much. I own this version, and let me say I was extremely disappointed with the transfer and picture quality of this one. It is very grainy to the point where it is very distracting in some certain scenes. The sound is ok and the colors are ok, but this was not ready to be released this way on Blu-ray. I honestly thought I was watching a DVD, and I have seen many DVD's that look better in terms of picture quality, compared to this Blu-ray version. I would recommend getting this if it is close to the same price as the best edition DVD out there, but if this is a lot more expensive, please save your money and get the best edition DVD. I can't even begin to imagine, it would be much worse than this.  *********UPLATED****** I just purchased the Severin edition release. This version is way superior over the shriek show blu-ray. I changed my rating from 3 to 5 stars. IF u have the shriek show release, sell it now  or gift it, and then get the Severin version.  Definitely worth the upgrade on picture, plus this has a bunch of nice extras too that's not offered in S.S. release. Get this release even if u have the S.S. release.

416122,4,6302035163,"In the early 1980's there was a new craze in Italian cinema. Giallo movies (murder mystery horror movies) faded quickly away. They had ruled Italian cinema for ten years but a now bloody horror movies were the output. this one was a freaky zombie flick in which a burial ground is disturbed and the zombies descend upon a manor house. The characters are weird and partying away. This was a hit film for a b movie in it's day and the zombies in this one are some of the best ever put on screen.  The effects in this one are very good and this is one of the better zombie flicks of it's era. It's dubbed into English for you too. The blu ray is a improvement on the dvd, but it's still not a restored movie.  So this isn't a movie that you buy for a huge upgrade, instead you buy it because you want a little better picture. This company doesn't spend any money to restore color etc. They just get the best print around and put it on dvd and then the same print on blu ray usually. Still it is a improvement and this is a must have for fans of zombie flicks and of course those of Italian horror. Which is now extinct pretty much dead. shriek show stopped releasing their horror titles on blu ray. They would have done better if they were priced at ten bucks new. But we never got any more releases from them as they pulled the blu ray line.",1365465600,,1339,4.1461538461538465
416123,2,6302035163,I have the DVD version of this and decided to upgrade. I'm sorry to say i was disappointed. I know this isn't a very good looking film to begin with but i expected it to look better than this on Blu ray. Very dark with mega grain throughout. Some of the close ups of the zombies and the gore looks a bit cleaner. The BR disc even froze and skipped in certain parts. It may be worth it to some but i think its a crappy transfer. There's no way this can be a restore from the original negative.,1357603200,,492,3.9797979797979797
416124,4,6302035163,"I have always enjoyed this zombie film. Another favourtite of mine. I really like the look of the zombies and the music. I have also have to mention the beautiful Mariangela Giordano and Michael the son of Mirangela played by the legendary Peter Bark.

I think Peter plays his character good who has thing about his mother. I like some of the classic lines in this film. like ""Mother, this cloth smells of death!"" and ""What's wrong? I'm your son!"". Some of the gore effects of course now look fake and dated, but this was pretty low budget film and i think the effects mostly look good.

Picture quality: 3.5/5

I think it looks good compared to my old Shriek Show DVD. It does have some problems. Like the Chroma noise. It has random little pixels of red, green, blue and so on. It`s not supposed to be there. It`s an error/artifact. I am sure there is some actual film grain also mixed in with the Chroma noise.

Despite, it looks better than my DVD. Some good details and the gore and blood looks better. Also think this film was restored too dark. It does have some minor and not so minor black crush, due to it being too dark. The DVD actually was the right opposite, it was too bright. Seems like they can`t get it just right.

Audio quality: 4/5

The DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 dual Mono mix actually was good. The music and some surprisingly bass from the pistols. I don`t remember anything wrong with it.

Film: 4.5/5
Overall: 4/5",1334620800,4,1436,4.437262357414449
416125,5,6302035163,"This movie is like one non-stop zombie attack once it gets going. The zombies move slow, but that doesn't matter, because the cast either falls every time they run, step in a bear trap, or huddle in a corner yelling ""No, no!"" or ""Help! Help!"" There's even one part where they decide to let the zombies in the castle to see what they want.
Even though the zombies are supposed to be scary with their rotted faces and gowns (They even borrow the worm and maggot faced zombies from ""Zombi"") the scariest thing about this movie is the ""kid"" Michael. This kid has the face of an old man and the worst haircut I've ever seen. He spends the movie whining or trying to grope his mother.
Best scene: When one of the women's face is shoved into broken glass, her head suddenly turns into a very obvious clay head with glass sticking out.
Blu-Ray transfer and dubbing are terrible. This movie could really use a new transfer and a release in Italian with English sub-titles.",1327104000,2,963,4.4772727272727275
416126,5,6302035163,"the blu-ray release of Burial Ground is well worth the upgrade if you are a big fan of this film. Great improvement on picture quality. the colors don't seem as washed out as previous releases, the action in the night scenes more visible and the blood and gore is more stand outish. the audio has been drastically improved too. I have been a fan of this movie since 1984 and seen some horrible transfers, but this is the best this movie is ever gonna look. those looking for a hollywood blockbuster transfer are gonna be disappointed, you gotta take into consideration the film was made in italy in 1981 for 1/2 a million dollars, it's not gonna look as good as star wars. a big thank you to the people who remastered the film, it has never looked better! so upgrade if you love this film, you won't be disappointed.",1314748800,3,816,4.446666666666666
416127,4,6302035163,"I just finished wathing the movie, and had to put that line in the title. Since most people who would buy this have probably already seen it and have their own opinion of it,  I will strictly review the blu-ray (But I do love this movie).

It seems to be the norm that older horror movies remastered to blu-ray will have a lot of digital noise.  This one is no exception - There are a lot of scenes that have a ton of noise, which gives the picture an almost pixelated look.  On the other hand, there is a lot of additional detail and color that was not visible in previous releases, and the overall look is sharper than it ever was on VHS or DVD. I have seen worse transfers (cough - City of the Living Dead - cough).

I tend to think that these films could use a little more processing when they 'upgrade' them to a blu-ray release, but in reality most of these studios probably don't want to put a lot of money into remastering movies like Burial Ground, and this is probably the best we will ever see of this title.

Media Blasters have included some extra footage (listed under 'outtakes') that I have not seen on previous releases.  It's incredible that extras like this even exist for such an obscure film. There are also interviews with the producer, and one of the stars.  Also, the sound is pretty great. If you are a fan of this movie, I would say buy this blu-ray.

I was dissapointed to find out that this does not include a DVD copy as it was originally posted when I pre-ordered it.  Especially since Media Blasters Zombie Holocaust DOES come with a dvd.  I haven't seen this movie in years - It was a blast to watch it again, and Media Blasters did a pretty good job.  Now if only somebody would re-release the Ilsa set on blu-ray..",1313193600,3,1748,4.295731707317073
416128,1,6302035163,"If you already have the dvd, do NOT bother with this blu-ray release. There is maybe a 1% improvment on picture quality.

SHREIK SHOW/MEDIA BLASTERS SHOULD SELL THEIR CATALOG TO BLUE UNDERGROUND AND HANG IT UP. They clearly do not know how to transfer a film onto any format correctly.

7819874,4,6302035163,"WARNING SPOILERS!!! Here's an Italian zombie/gore film I love for all the wrong reasons. The film begins with Professor Ayres (Renato Barbieri) discovering an ancient Etruscan burial ground among the ruins of a dilapidated country estate. Somehow he reanimates the decaying corpses of the Etruscans (it is never explained how he does it), who chow down on him (""No! Don't! I am your friend!""). We are then introduced to the sex-starved people who are spending the weekend at the country estate: Professional photographer Mark (Gian Luigi Chirizzi; TERROR EXPRESS - 1979) and model/lover Janet (Karin Well; SKIN'EM ALIVE - 1978), who has bad feelings about spending time at the estate (Mark should have listened to her rather than telling her that it is all in her head). Also at the estate are George (Roberto Caporali), his new wife Evelyn (Mariangela Giordano; PATRICK STILL LIVES - 1980) and her creepy-looking, bugeyed son Michael (Peter Bark), who has the hots for Mom. He will do whatever it takes to stop George from making love to her and is the sole reason why this film is special to me.
  It doesn't take long for the zombies to attack. As the zombies chase Janet and Mark through the estate's grounds (Janet: ""What is it?"" Mark: ""Whatever it is, it's not human. It's a walking corpse!"" How could it be not human and be a corpse? Don't think too hard because this film is full of absurd dialogue.), Janet steps on a bear trap (!), while necking couple James (Simone Mattioli; THE OTHER HELL - 1980) and Leslie (Antonella Antinori) come running to her and Mark's rescue, caving-in the skulls of two zombies by bashing their heads with rocks. George is the first to die, as zombies tear him apart and eat his innards, while Evelyn and Michael escape. Pretty soon, all the survivors are trapped in the house, while dozens of zombies chop away at the front door with axes (these are not your normal, mindless zombies).
  ""They can only be killed if we blow their heads off!"" says James, as he uses the zombies for target practice, blowing their heads off with a shotgun while standing on a second floor terrace. A short time later he runs out of shotgun shells, so everyone will have to find another way to kill them (Earlier in the film, Evelyn and Michael set two zombies on fire, but it would be stupid to do the same thing inside the house). Leslie is the next to die when a zombie pulls her through a broken window, the broken glass cutting her face into bloody pieces (The zombie that kills her suddenly drops dead! But why? Like I said earlier, don't ask too many questions!). Leslie becomes a zombie and puts the bite on Michael (who just put the sexual moves on Mom, in the film's most hilarious/unsettling moment). Evelyn discovers Leslie chewing on Michael's torn-off arm and she bashes Leslie's head in on the side of a bath tub. This won't be the last time that Evelyn has to deal with Michael, though. The zombies break through the front door and invade the house, so Mark and James pick up two swords and make mincemeat out of several zombie heads with well-placed blows. Professor Ayres (Remember him?) is now a zombie and kills butler Nicholas (Claudio Zucchet; YETI: GIANT OF THE 20TH CENTURY - 1977), chewing on his flesh like it is some fancy filet mignon dinner.
  Mark, Janet, James and a near comatose Evelyn (she is grieving for Michael) escape to an abandoned monastery, but it is not as abandoned as they thought. James sees a group of robed monks in the monastery's chapel, only these monks are now zombies who make James their latest meal. The trio escape from the monastery and end up in some model builder's workshop. They are greeted by a zombie on the second floor, while the rest of the zombies try to get in through the front door.  Mark hits the zombie with a hefty piece of wood (but keeps missing its head!) and eventually throws it over the stone railing. Michael shows up as a zombie missing an arm and exposes Evelyn's right breast (A delirious Evelyn says, ""Yes, just like when you were a baby!"") and, in a scene that will not likely be forgotten, Michael bites off her nipple! The film concludes with all the zombies invading the workshop, as a zombified James grabs Mark's arm and puts it in the path of a spinning blade of a table saw and the zombies surround Janet. The film ends on this note, as an end scrawl proclaims: ""The Earth shall tremble....graves shall open....they shall come among the living as messengers of death and there shall be the night of terror...."" - Profecy of the Black Spider (Their spelling, not mine)
  Like I said in the beginning of this review, this film is entertaining for all the wrong reasons. The person who dubbed Michael's voice is hilarious to the extreme and the dialogue that comes out of his and everyone else's mouths are risible, such as when Michael says, ""Mother, this cloth smells of death!"" (How in the hell would a child know what death smells like?). Speaking of Michael, actor Peter Bark (real name; Pietro Barzocchini) became a minor celebrity thanks to this film, appearing at horror conventions worldwide (an extra on this Blu-Ray is of an interview with Bark at such a convention in 2013). The fact is that Bark is more frightening-looking than any zombie in this film (he looks like a miniature Dario Argento!) and his incestuous relationship with his mother brings on more horror than director Andrea Bianchi (the amazingly entertaining crime thriller CRY OF A PROSTITUTE - 1974; the giallo STRIP NUDE FOR YOUR KILLER - 1975) wanted to convey, but since most of it is due to the atrocious dubbing, we can't blame him. The zombies are appropriately creepy (lots of maggots and worms), but static (very seldom do we see their mouths move). This film, also known as BURIAL GROUND: THE NIGHTS OF TERROR, was lensed at an historic Italian landmark known as Villa Parisi (another extra on the Blu-Ray is a tour through the location as it stands today). The location shoot is very atmospheric, making it a character unto itself. The script, by Piero Regnoli (CITY OF THE WALKING DEAD - 1980), is full of zombie cliches (no matter how fast our survivors are, the slow, shuffling zombies always manage to catch up with them) and, if you think too hard about this film, you will realize that it is a rather boring affair. Just keep your brain in check and you will probably have a good time with it.

This is one of the first non American zombie films I seen on dvd
I remember blind buying it at Best Buy for $18.00 early on during the dvd boom
When Best Buy actually had a huge chunk of the store devoted to films!

Burial Ground is a step below Romero and Fulci's work
But, it's extremely Grindhouse and sleazy
The main setting is more along the lines of a Hammer film
But, it's filmed like a adult film
It's Night of the Living Dead turned on it's ear and done very different
with over the top nudity, sex, violence and creepy incist
This isn't your Father's Zombie film

I've had both dvd and original blu-ray distributed by Shriek Show
This newer version by Severin Films is hands down a solid upgrade even against the previous blu-ray
Shriek Show is infamous for putting out dvd's and blu-ray's that have a poor lifespan  (Not sure if it's the disc they use or what)
The PQ is much better next to the previous blu-ray  (I'm pretty sure that the Shriek Show dvd was upconverted to HD and put on there blu-ray
If you want a pure HD remaster this version is the way to go
I watched 1/2 the new blu-ray release it's a much better transfer

The new exclusive extras with all honesty were a let down (All extras have English Subtitles)
The interview with Peter Bark was done at a Horror  convention (very loud the crowed/fans were very loud and rude)
this interview was interesting but, too short and done lazily (Berk comes off extremely likeable and humble the man looks good for his age)
Just for the Money: Interview with Actor: Simone Mattioli was also interesting and honest  But, very short
There are a few more extras just haven't had the time to view them

This release is for Fans like myself that love the film for what it is
It's not perfect but, it's still very unique and fresh for a sub-genre that has decayed more and more each year
Still to this day  no other zombie films has really been done like this
It's truly on it's own little island  8/10
UPDATE 9-8-2017

The best soudtrack is the Italian one,even if it is presented only in Dolby Digital 192 Kb/s.",1478304000,,255,4.953488372093023
7819882,4,6302035163,"For this review I'll be focusing on the release rather than the film. All I'll say is Burial Ground is one of the ultimate so bad it's good films. It's got gore and the weirdness is off the charts. The film simply put is a blast, but does run out of a little steam midway through, but still I give it a solid 3.5 out of 5

Burial Ground has had a few releases with the most notable coming from Media Blasters on DVD than later blu-ray and on blu-ray from 88 Films, which was region 2 and the latest release is from Severin Films on both DVD and blu-ray and region free. The Media Blasters blu was a bit below average and plagued by a number of issues, but for the most part was an upgrade from their DVD. But both editions weren't exactly great transfers. I was gonna buy the 88 Films release, but decided to wait and see what Severin would do. While they don't get the attention that Scream Factory does, but quality wise Severin along with Arrow and Synapse are by far the best cult labels on the market. First things first this is a major upgrade from the Media Blasters edition. There isn't even a contest here. Seeing as I don't own the 88 Films edition I can't comment fully. Searching for reviews for both Severin and 88 Films you'll be able to compare screenshots and based on what I've seen it looks like an edge for Severin, but without actually seeing the 88 Films release I can't fairly say. For this edition by Severin the first 3000 copies come with a slipcover with newly commissioned artwork, which is also what's used on the actual disc. There's a reversible cover, which uses both the original Burial Ground posters (Burial Ground like many Italian films may have a different title region to region it has even gone under the title Zombi 3, which is an alternate title for a whole slew of films).

Severin has a new 2k scan and restoration and the film looks amazing. Some sources say both Severin and 88 Films used the same scan and other sources say differently. Even if it's the same scan, Severin's has some differences. There's no DNR or anything of the sorts used. There's a nice layer of grain and some mild print damage here and there and Severin captures the original look of the film and once again they show why they're one of the best in the business.

As for the extras; this release isn't quite as epic as their Dr. Butcher (Zombie Holocaust) release, but it's still a terrific edition.

Extras are;

Villa Parisi: Legacy of Terror: Feature on the Historic House Location.

This is a tour of where Burial Ground was filmed and it was the location of a number of Italian horror films such as Nightmare Castle, Patrick Still Lives, A Bay of Blood, Hatchet for the Honeymoon, and Joe D'Amato's Beyond the Darkness as well as a couple of other films.

Peter Still Lives: Festival Q&A with actor Peter Bark

Brief, but effective and I'm sure any fan of the film will enjoy this. This feature smells of death!

Just for the Money: Interview with actor Simone Mattioli

Solid interview; Mattioli talks a bit of his career and work on Burial Ground and mentions how one of the F/X artist was later arrested for stabbing someone! This is also briefly mentioned on Villa Parisi.

The Smell of Death: Interviews with producer Gabriele Crisanti and Mariangela Giordano

This is a carry over from the Media Blasters blu-ray release.

Outtakes, extended scenes

This was also on the Media Blasters blu and also has no audio only music playing over.

Theatrical Trailer

If you highlight the trailer and hit to the left on the arrow key you'll get an Easter egg with the Italian credits.

As for the audio it's presented in either English or Italian with English subtitles. Now this is where most people make mistakes. I'm in awe of how many so called fans have such little knowledge of these films. I always read complaints when there's no Italian audio. These films from Italy were filmed with NO sound therefore all these films are dubbed. Also many of these films used English speaking actors (sometimes German and French). Sometimes onset English would be spoken by the actors regardless of how well they spoke it since again filming is with no sound. Sometimes everyone would speak their lines in whatever they spoke, but again it doesn't matter since there's no sound while filming. The cast here is all Italian actors and I have no idea what they spoke on set (my guess would be Italian). So if you go with the Italian track on this or any of these Italian films you're seeing it dubbed and not all the Italian actors do their own dub as Simone Mattioli mentions in his interview he didn't do his own dub in the Italian track. So going with the Italian track isn't anymore correct than the English track.

There is one reason however to watch the film in Italian with English subtitles; there's a difference in dialogue at times. There's scenes where the subtitles are the same as the English audio, but perhaps worded differently and there's other times where the English dub and English subtitles are completely different.

I should mention I put on the English subtitles to go along with the English track to see how they differ in dialogue and I only watched for a few minutes so I can't say how the entire film goes, but it was interesting to see how certain scenes differ in dialogue.

As mentioned I held off on the 88 Films version, but I'd suggest to research assuming you have a region free player. HD wise screenshots seem to favor Severin, but they're close enough that one isn't really better than the other. 88 Films comes with a Grindhouse transfer, which is unrestored and while a cool feature, but I prefer to see the film as the filmmakers intended. Extras the Severin release is the better of the two as on the 88 Films version there's an interview with an author who wrote a book on director Andrea Bianchi and there's also an audio commentary. Severin wins on the extras and about even on the transfer.

Overall Severin once again delivers a wonderful release. The only letdown is after seeing what a great release they gave Dr. Butcher (Zombie Holocaust), which is my top blu-ray of 2016 (yeah as I write this there's still time left, but can't see it being topped), but Burial Ground is a slight letdown compared to Dr. Butcher, but with that said this is the definitive release and is overall a solid release that's very much worthy of a purchase from fans of this totally insane cult classic.",1477440000,20,6442,4.550561797752809
7819883,4,6302035163,"The modern zombie film may have been invented in America, but its real evolution took place in Italy.  While the undead were still shambling around shopping malls in the states, Italian zombies were wielding machine guns (Nightmare City), battling sharks (Zombie) and laying siege to castles with battering rams in copycat quickies like Andrea Bianchi's Burial Ground (1980), a pasty-faced piece of exploitation filmmaking made all the more notorious by a tasteless bit of oedipal violence that still has the power to trigger your gag reflex!

Vacationing at a family estate, a wealthy host and his guests are trapped inside after an archeological dig resurrects the angry remnants of the local peasant population.  But locked doors and barred windows won't keep out this horde of vengeful corpses!  Despite their rotting frames, these zombies use a wide array of tools, weaponry and good 'ol undead ingenuity to break in and extract their pound of raw flesh.

Using Lucio Fulci's Zombie as a template, Burial Ground doesn't even bother with the pretense of character development beyond the mother-son duo of Evelyn (Mariangela Giordano) and Michael (Peter Bark, a 26-year-old actor playing a 13-year-old boy), whose incestuous sexual tension becomes a running gag throughout the film, culminating in the aforementioned shocker of a finale where Michael, now a zombie, bites off his mother's breast!  It's a disgustingly brilliant moment of Italian excess, somewhat reflective of little Karen consuming her parents in the original Night of the Living Dead, but oh-so much more sexually grotesque.

Director Andrea Bianchi was no stranger to mixing sex and death; in fact, it was his cinematic signature in previous over-the-top outings like Strip Nude for Your Killer and Malabimba: The Malicious Whore, all coattail riding genre pictures that pushed things to the extreme.  Burial Ground (aka The Nights of Terror) dutifully arranges the naked flesh for display, and then promptly devours it!  The zombies themselves are rather slipshod in construction, ranging from light make-up work and Halloween masks (keep your eye out for Karloff's likeness) to full-blown applications that look like they were melted in a microwave.  But there's something ridiculously charming about them all the same, especially when Bianchi films them shuffling around the castle grounds in an endless eerie loop.

The gore is your typical ""guts in a box,"" nothing that even comes close to Savini's work on Romero's trilogy...or even the ingenious eyeball puncture in Fulci's film.  Burial Ground leans towards Ossorio's Blind Dead series, relying on the strength in numbers and twisting the rules as needed; there's even a gathering of Knight Templars tossed in just for kicks!  The film's reputation rests mostly on little Michael's big mouth and a couple of humorous typos in the end credits.  So why all the fuss?  Italian horror doesn't make sense, and neither does the appeal for the uninitiated.  There are plenty of zombie flicks out there; feel free to enjoy their convincing special effects and professional acting...this one is ours!

And Severin Films is a perfect fit for Burial Ground's hi-def debut.  The self-described ""Criterion of Smut"" has put together an incredible special edition that starts with a stellar new 2K restoration of the film itself, looking consistently amazing all the way through.  Extras include a fascinating tour of the shooting location (which has been a hot spot since the early days of Italian Gothics), festival Q & A with actor Peter Bark, sit-down interview with actors Simone Mattioli and Mariangela Giordano and producer Gabriele Crisanti, plus deleted / extended scenes and a theatrical trailer.",1477353600,5,3722,5.288624787775891
