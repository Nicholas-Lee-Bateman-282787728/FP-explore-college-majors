3976265,5,B002RUNHL0,"All right, this is a romantic comedy, a romance, so it gains points with me, but I have also to be sincere, it's not exactly the best gay romance I have seen. It's quite clear that it's a small budget movie, setting, sound, scenography, photography, all have the hints of a small budget, and sometime I had the feeling that the director wanted to tell me something, but I didn't understand it (the ball on the beach?). And truth be told, it was difficult to link the main characters with college students, they seemed a bit too old for the role. BUT, again, this is a romance, the story of a young boy who wants his first kiss to be special, and there is a wonderful prince charming waiting for him, so, if you want to see, for once, a gay-themed movie without angst, well, this is definitely it.",1278288000,4,796,4.348993288590604
3976266,2,B002RUNHL0,"I've seen a lot of gay films (around 250 or so) and this one is not high on my list. I will first focus on the strengths. This tells a simple story of an innocent and idealistic young man looking for Mr. Right. He finds him in another man who is only beginning to explore the possibility that he might be gay. For both of them, they share their ""first kiss"" with each other and then the film is over. Prior to that touching moment, we meet a lot of odd friends who like to drink and smoke pot and behave in silly, goofy ways. The acting comes across as insincere. At thirty minutes, I thought, ""I hope this film gets better,"" but they almost never do after thirty minutes and this one didn't either. I recommend this film only if you have few other choices. My recommendations of tremendous gay films, awesome writing, insightful stories are: Priest, A Home at the End of the World, The Journey of Jared Price, Locked Up: Love Behind Bars, Milk, The Sum of Us, Making Love, Latter Days, Long-Term Relationship, Regarding Billy, and Touch of Pink, You'll Get Over It, All Over the Guy, Another Country, Back Soon, Beautiful Boxer (transgender theme), Beautiful Thing, Get Real, Big Eden, Boy Culture, Brokeback Moutain, Chris and Don - A Love Story, Coffee Date, C.R.A.Z.Y., An Englishman in New York, Fighting Tommy Riley, Gay Sex in the 70s, Gone, But Not Forgotten, Guide to Better Gay Sex (hot!), In and Out (hilarious), Just a Question of Love, A Love to Hide, Ma Vie En Rose (My Life in Pink) [transgender theme], Make the Yuletide Gay, and too many more to list.",1277164800,18,1568,4.505263157894737
3976267,4,B002RUNHL0,"Just finished watching this movie.  Overall, I enjoyed the story.  Very sweet and romantic.  But I agree with another reviewer, it was a little confusing with the flashbacks, and the sound was terrible at times.  The actors are all very cute, and the dialogue is fun and catchy.  Not alot of depth, but then, it isn't intended to be that kind of movie.  If you want a low budget, feel good romantic movie, I think you'll like this one.",1262217600,12,435,4.443037974683544
3976268,3,B002RUNHL0,"Mayson (Dan Selon) is a twenty-something gay man who is waiting for his first kiss (Yes, really!)  His BFF, Robyn (Kendra Thomas) is pushing Mayson to be more aggressive about meeting other guys, and be open to whatever might happen, such as speaking to the cute guy they saw at the library and again at a coffee shop.  At a party thrown by a mutual friend, Mayson encounters Reilly (his crush) again, and learns he had recently broken up with a girlfriend (Uh, oh).  Of course, since this takes place in the Los Angeles area, where all cute guys are gay, Mayson and Reilly find a common interest in each other, and it goes from there.

The story is told in flashbacks with quick cuts to scenes with different characters, making it a bit confusing.  While the concept is sweet and charming, and the attractive, inexperienced cast does the best with what they were given, the story (such as it is) suffers from rather cartoonish situations and some of the most inane dialogue I have ever heard in a film.  There are also problems with the sound, and I had to constantly lower and raise the volume to hear one bit of dialogue, only to be blasted out of my seat at the next scene.  Not rated, but would be a PG-13 at worst. DVD has no extras besides trailers and chapter stops. Best I can do on this one is give it three stars out of five.",1262131200,11,1336,4.362903225806452

3976290,2,B002RUNHL0,"If you are in the mood for light ""fluff"" romantic comedy on a smaller budget ""indie"" flavor...this can be sooth one's palette. The themes were nice and, overall, gave you warm and fuzzy....but some of the chracteristics/characters seemed ""one note"" and, at times, clich. If that is something enjoyed...the film is fun.

3976292,1,B002RUNHL0,"This sweet story of a gay wedding uses flashbacks to chart the course of the relationship.  That concept immediately ruins any sense of anticipation or suspense about the development of the relationship.  However, there are many more problems such as trite dialogue, silly characters, lack of consistent tone, and lame plot turns.  The actors are doing their best, but aren't able to elevate the vapid material.",1482278400,,411,5.196969696969697
3976293,5,B002RUNHL0,"I don't understand why some users are so critic about Be Mine. Its  just what it proposes, a fairy tale, with the most delicious ending. The fact is we are so much used to bad endings, and the life as it is thing, that such a proposal seems superficial, when it is not: its in the root of our never ending dream. But we must receive such good endings in a transvestite way, as if it isn't possible that a simple thing such as receiving a valentine card from someone we dreamed of cant be true. What a bad world is this one we live in.
To me, Ive taken this little tale as a gift, a way of passing a good day, of thinking that our wishes can come true, if we only let them be. Of course it won't always happen that way; but couldn't just for once this be true?",1478476800,,759,3.9607843137254903

3976317,5,B002RUNHL0,This movie is way too cute. I love how the message of the movie is just be who you are and things will come your way. Do not try to be someone else because it gets you no where at all. I have watched it on the Logo Channel so many times that I had to just go out and buy the movie.

3976411,3,B002RUNHL0,It was pretty good . Not bad the usual all the gay movie kind of the same. Could have been a little bit more realistic even if it is a comedy,1397952000,2,141,3.5806451612903225
3976412,4,B002RUNHL0,"So the movie begins.. a scene at the beach.  Two friends meet up after a wedding and they start remembering the past year that leads to the wedding.  At first, this movie looks and feels like a Indie movie.  Its feels more like a biography than a movie.

1 year prior.... Very simple plot... Two men, one who never had a first kiss; and the second, ending a straight type  more-or-less relationship meet by accident.  At a library, at a coffee place; then finally at a best friends party.  They eventually get to know one another over drinking way too much.  But whats typical is these men seem to have an attraction that is not really known to themselves in the beginning.  After a night of drinking and one of them takes care of the other, they meet up the next day for a ""thanks for helping me out"" dinner night.  They in turn happen to fall on valentines night (or it is indicated) and have a love connection.  Behold a year later, they are married and have a reception at the very same friends house they first really met.

I bascially like a romance/comedy film but if your not into films with very little plot, you will have to go more on ""Latter Days"" movie Or ""ECupid"".  *Be Mine* Movie kind of lags, but I enjoyed the concept.

Movie seems slightly incomplete and very ""party to you drop, OMG I find the love of my life"" fantasy.  Its good for what its worth and thats why I gave it a 4-star rating.",1395705600,2,1409,4.304182509505703
3976413,4,B002RUNHL0,This movie shows the main character as really being afraid to step and find what he's looking for.  I found the movie to be entertaining and humorous.  The movie also showed how it's difficult to judge a person based on what other people think of someone.  I liked the movie and would recommend it.,1392768000,,298,4.481481481481482

3976415,1,B002RUNHL0,"1/2 way through I almost turned it off.. and wished I had.  Good theme possibly (the story of falling in love and how everyone is not the same) but.. just ODD somehow.  It seems sort of like a prelude (or teaser) for the TV series the New Normal, but Be Mine is even further off the map from 'normal' with characters so far over the top it's no longer funny... spoof turns into farce.",1389052800,,384,4.175675675675675
3976416,5,B002RUNHL0,"The movie is indeed amateurish.  But that does not mean that that it wasn't effective.

Little more than an extended sitcom, it is nonetheless cute and funny, with likeable characters.  Selon makes an endearing hero, awkward and bumbling and very charming.

I liked this one much more than I expected.  It's nice to see something without lots of nudity and explicit sex and profanity for a change.  Great movie-making, no.  But it is a pleasant way to spend an hour or so.",1323129600,,508,4.651685393258427

The whole plots and the characters are all pushed to the extreme but I am in a good mood for a simple fairy tales so 4 stars it is.

3976469,4,B002RUNHL0,"We at Film Masters really enjoyed reviewing this film.  It is very simple,
non-complex romance story, and revolves around 2 time periods  (before they met, and
after they have married).  We liked it mainly beacause it is simple, has no
deep mysteries or mind boggling special effects.  People who see this film
might view  it has having no substance, but this film was not created as a hollywood
block buster or a must-see world event film. Two guys who never met before
meet in an awkward moment, then meet again later at a party where they slowly
take off.  Another thing we liked about it is this is not a boy-meets-girl, breaks-up
-with-girl, and gets-girl-back boring type of film that is so old its not worth to renting.
 Its slightly different where no one breaks up and  keeps you thinking how
these guys ended up like they did.

But by the time it ended I had gotten past all of its many flaws, the worst of which is that it is completely - and I do mean completely - unbelievable. But it's sweet, and it's innocent, so sweet and so innocent that it's like the daydream of the most romantic, nerdiest kid in the seventh grade who finds himself longing to kiss the star quarterback. I much prefer gritty, gutsy, handheld movies with bad sound, no stereotypes, and lots of rough edges, loose ends and unanswered questions - like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mala-Noche/dp/B000TXNDUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mala Noche</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Denied/dp/B00029NM4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Denied</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blue-Citrus-Hearts/dp/B0006J28C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blue Citrus Hearts</a>; but the world needs gay tween dream movies like Be Mine too, and I'm very glad it was made and I stuck with it till the end.",1286668800,4,1146,6.6466666666666665
8378916,3,B002RUNHL0,"Absolutely, totally OK. Not great, not terrible. Likable characters.",1520380800,,68,6.666666666666667
8378917,2,B002RUNHL0,"I really wouldn't say this is a horrible movie. The actors are OK, not really good, but mostly believable.

So why did I watch it twice? It's not very memorable. As I'm watching it the second time, I kept thinking it seemed familiar, but couldn't really remember anything.

So, if you have time to waste and want a boring RomCom, watch it. There us some nudity.",1518566400,,361,4.454545454545454
8378918,1,B002RUNHL0,To everyone involved in this miserable project: do not quit your day jobs. The movie business is not for you.,1518048000,,109,4.5
8378919,5,B002RUNHL0,"5 stars for being a cute, adorable, feel good movie.

The movie poster picture above does not do Riley (tanktop) justice. He is 10 times better looking in the movie. He has a very sexy, calming, take charge kind of voice.

The movie as a whole is just like others: straight girl in love with best gay friend, tries to fix him up. But, it was done well. The black friend is hilarious.",1510963200,,383,4.232876712328767

8378921,3,B002RUNHL0,"I have definitely seen far worse gay themed movies. This one was okay, it was cute, I laughed and that kiss at the end is pretty nice.",1499990400,,134,4.0
8378922,1,B002RUNHL0,"The only thing that made this movie ok was that it wasn't that long.  The premise was great, but the plot is shaky and Riley comes off as very unlikeable.",1494547200,,154,4.133333333333334
8378923,2,B002RUNHL0,Harmless. Slow for a rom com. Dull.,1492905600,,35,4.142857142857143
8378924,1,B002RUNHL0,"I got through the first 20 seconds of this and then stopped. Any gay movie that starts with immediate drug use (as this one did), is too cliche for me to continue.",1490140800,,163,4.125
