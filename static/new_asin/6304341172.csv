It would be a huge mistake to pass this movie up! With the master of low-budget action Menahem Golan directing you are in for a treat! His films are so bad they're just plain good. Twenty years after the Delta Force hit screens he proves he's still got the imagination and creativity to make the most absurd ideas work onscreen. I only wish Catwoman and Spider-Man 2 were this much fun to watch.

Terrorists with plastic guns that shoot real bullets...Somehow it works. Terrorist leader has the hots for hero's Smokin' redhead wife so bad he keeps her prisoner after letting the other hostages go a year later...American husband with undying love that he keeps trying to rescue his wife from the terrorists in spite of his country writing her off.... Somehow this works very well. Pare` and the cast make the campy screenplay work by giving strong performances that make the movie entertaining. Ironically, an Israeli director makes this Pro-America patriotic movie in Greece of all places. Go figure.

There's a huge fun factor to this film. I don't understand why this film made me want to smile. It looked like the actors were having fun on this movie, playing it straight but not taking it too seriously. I wish they made more action movies like this, the kind where you turn your brain off and just enjoy what's on the screen. I hate how the action genre has devolved into a ""message"" with filmmakers pushing their political agenda. I just want to see the good guys kick some butt.

I've watched a ton of 80's Cannon Group movies Made By Golan with Golan-Globus producing. Made on a shoestring budget all Yoram's films never fail to entertain. If only people like Roland Emmerich, Joel Schumacher, the Wachowski Bros and Sam Raimi could learn that imagination and creativity are more entertaining than how many distracting Computer Generated Images and special effects you can cram into every frame.",1107993600,5,2041,4.893063583815029
7870571,5,6304341172,"I admit to being a big Michael Pare fan. But he is an aquired taste and some of his stuff...weelll enough said. This is a typical B action movie from the creators of Missing In Action series. Mr. Pare has worked with them before in Killing Streets & First Light. I guess the reason I like this movie (Heroes)so much is the angle of rescuing his wife from the terrorists. The premise is our hero is a retired Navy Seal on vacation w/ wife & son in Greece. In airport on the way home terrorists hijack plane for release of Jose Maria Carlos (shades of Carlos ? the Jackal). The wife is taken and not released so our hero goes after her w/ a little help from Capt. Cody Brandt (Jan-Michael Vincent), former SEAL friend. There is action, of course but not mindless, unexpected humor w/ some excellent one-liners and romance. I think a lot of women would like to be loved like that. There is some heavy handed American patriotism (standard in Golan-Globus Productions) but who is to say they aren't right. Maybe America is too sensitive about being a bully in the wrong situations. I watch this movie when I get down it makes me feel good!",989971200,8,1134,4.430622009569378
