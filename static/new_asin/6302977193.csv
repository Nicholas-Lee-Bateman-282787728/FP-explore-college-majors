Also, what fun to see Elisabeth Moss, of future ""Mad Men"" fame, portraying Baby Louise.  She looked exatly the same then, only in a smaller package.",1401408000,3,301,4.862745098039215
537976,2,6302977193,I was hoping for a great movie but this was boring.  Too bad since Bette has nice chops!  I will blame the director for the bad acting because I've seen most of these people in other movies and they did just fine.,1397347200,,213,4.0476190476190474
537977,1,6302977193,"It all comes down to this basically.
How do you make a likeable show around such an UNLIKABLE character?
Admittedly I've never been a huge fan of the musical, but here you so rapidly get sick of, then totally irritated by Midler's harsh voice belting out all the numbers at full intensity.
Subtlety? She's just never heard of it, ...probably her ears are shot, because I was reaching for the volume after her second laser-like performance.
Midler gives Rose nothing at all to like. She's obnoxious through and through. Watching her is like being subjected to self-indulgent self-promotion.
Yes I know she's supposed to be a ""stage mother"" of the very worst kind, but if we are to sit through a whole movie about her, we need something however small to ""like""
Zilch, zip, ....zero!
She mugs at the camera, she over-acts, over ""Jew-ises"" and bellows throughout as though her lungs and vocal cords are made of leather!
I used to quite like Midler's work but after seeing this I never want to so much as hear her strident voice ever again.

The one high point for me in what seemed a VERY long movie was the appearance and song by the three strippers! A breath of fresh air in an otherwise very stale Midler vehicle. The lead stripper was so easily able to steal this whole show, even though she had only a small role, simply because Midler pitched her performance at such a totally disagreeable and obnoxious level.

I wanted to leave LONG before her long-suffering intended husband walked out on her.
One star from me, ...and that's for those afore mentioned strippers, who deserve far more, but that would over-inflate the rating for this supremely irritating performance from a ""star"" who just doesn't know the meaning of nuance.
I hated it!",1394668800,2,1741,4.723684210526316

This is a light, run-through, a good chance to become familiar with the plot and hear the songs belted loudly if not deeply.  I saw Merman & Klugman do it in the original, and I wish I'd seen Patty Lapone in the part.  This one is lifeless.",1373328000,,392,4.2

538194,4,6302977193,"I wish there was a way to combine the singing voice of Bette Midler and the acting skills of Ros Russell in one person and then you would have the perfect Mama Rose.  Nevertheless, Midler does a good job although in my opinion, no one can compete with Natalie Wood as Louise.  And can anyone top Karl Malden as Herbie?  Still this production is enjoyable and a pleasure to watch.",1327536000,2,379,4.385714285714286
538195,5,6302977193,"Once again, another great performance by one of America's greatest entertainers: Bette Midler. Is there anything this woman can't do?

538198,3,6302977193,"I was reading a bio on Bette Midler and did not realize she had played Mama Rose in another movie version of Gypsy.  I just had to see this film, so I looked it up on Amazon. My first surprise was the vast difference in price for the DVD vs VHS. It was $69.00 for the DVD - Yikes!  So I bought the VHS version for about 6 bucks. I just wanted to see the movie not frame it.  This movie impressed me as being more like the stage version which I did see starring the late Ethel Merman. I actually prefer Roslin Russell's Mama Rose, however.  All three are very talented ladies, but the character of Mama Rose is so harsh and in-your-face.  Roslin Russell was able to soften the character up a bit. Still if you like Bette Midler or the muscial Gypsy this is a good one to add to your collection.",1297209600,,793,4.090322580645161

538201,3,6302977193,"It looked good on paper: Powerhouse performer Bette Midler playing the most famous role in musical theater, directed by Emile Ardolino, the guy who turned ""Dirty Dancing"" into a national phenomenon.  So what went wrong?  The truth is, Midler simply isn't a good enough actress to capture the subtleties of as complex a character as Momma Rose.  She's all big eyes and broad gestures, waving arms and manic mood swings; it's a  community theater performance, going for the obvious at every turn.  Is Rose manic and driven at times?  Yes, of course; her father calls her a ""crazy woman"" in an early scene.  But from her first entrance, Midler seems to have confused ""powerhouse"" with ""bulldozer.""  She spits her lines out in rapid succession, with all the bawdiness with which she tells her famous Sophie Tucker jokes in concert.  But where's charm, humor, sexiness; all the manipulatively feminine characteristics that make Rose such a seductive, seditious presence in everyone's lives?  Rose gets her way not because she beats Herbie, June and Louise into submission, but because her dreams and desires are so strong they have no choice but to believe in them themselves.  Auntie Mame is described as The Pied Piper, but it's an apt description of Rose as well.  Midler's characterization is so grating, I can't imagine anyone doing much more than running in the opposite direction.

Unfortunately, with the exception of Jennifer Rae Beck's Dainty June and Linda Hart's Mazeppa, the supporting cast is average at best.  And however skilled Ardolino is at directing the musical sequences, he completely fails to mine the humor and tension of Arthur Laurents's brilliant dialogue.  The production values are first rate across the boards.  Personally, I think June's acts are a little over produced; a certain vaudeville seediness would have made more sense.  But the producers and Ardolino obviously adore the material -- who doesn't?  -- and they've approached it with tremendous love and attention, so it's hard to fault their decisions.

Is this a better version than the 1962 film?  Yes and no.  It's a far more faithful adaptation, with Laurents and Sondheim's bawdier material intact, but I think the earlier cast is far superior.  I know I'm not supposed to like  Rosiland Russell because she wasn't Ethel Merman, but I love the performance; for me, Russell finds the perfect balance between Rose's fierce passion and her crushing vulnerability.  And Karl Malden and Natalie Wood are superb, the latter fragile and extremely touching.  So as a record of the show as originally written, this version is a must for all musical theatre fans.  But if you're looking for the definitive ""Gypsy"" on film -- it ain't been made yet.",1216080000,2,2728,5.033482142857143
538290,3,6302977193,"About the best you can say for Bette Midler's performance is that she does her own singing. And even some of that is sloppy and careless. Her acting is one-note, and she kills her best comedy lines by alternately gasping or screeching them. (Say what you will about Roz Russell, she at least knew how to deliver lines.) We know that Madame Rose's kiddie troupe is getting a bit long in the tooth, but Jennifer Beck as ""Dainty"" June looks fully thirty years old. Cynthia Gibb is a lovely Louise/Gypsy, but Natalie Wood ""aged"" more credibly in the admittedly flawed by classier 1962 theatrical film adaptation. Peter Riegert is too mousy as Herbie, so much of the point of a strong man continually knuckling under to Rose's steamroller whim is lost. (When he does stand up to Rose, he seems more petulant than assertive.) Stars are wasted in bit parts, and Andrea Martin unwisely and unsuccessfully tries to be funny as Mrs. Cratchitt (who was played hilariously ""straight"" in the 1962 film by Jean Willes.)

The production itself looks cheesy and low budget, and the bright crayon colors don't help. Even the lamb was cuter in the earlier movie!

Still, it's an earnest attempt. And with great material like that, it's hard to go far wrong. As many others have pointed out, the adaptation is faithful to the original. But oh, why didn't somebody think to do a second film of GYPSY in the 70s while Merman was still around to do it?",1215993600,2,1430,4.648221343873518
538291,4,6302977193,"I was recently in a production of ""Gypsy"" and have grown pretty attached to it. I thought this rendition was done quite well, but I prefer the Baby June from the original film and I prefer the strippers from the original film as well. I like Bette's performance the best out of the other Mama Rose actresses from film and/or Broadway.

My only complaint was a small glitch in the DVD that causes it to skip. Maybe a spin on the Disc Doctor will cure it.",1183420800,2,453,4.267441860465116
538292,5,6302977193,"What can I say? Bette Midler is totally superb in the role of Mama Rose!

  She is fantastic!  Even though this was a television special, Ms Midler  out performed, and out sang Tyne Daly, had more passion that Ethel Merman,

and came neck to neck with Angela Lansbury in acting and singing departments.  Great DVD!",1167868800,2,314,4.6
538293,3,6302977193,"I have always loved this show, ever since my high school put it on decades ago.  Viewing this DVD, something about the production didn't quite work for me, but it took me a long time to figure out what the problem was. And I finally decided that the problem was Bette Midler.  She is a good actress, with a lovely voice, but I think she took the role of Rose a bit too seriously. She does a great job as the overbearing stage mother who 'just wanted to be noticed', but while her depiction may be accurate, it tends to trample over everyone else in the cast.  The scenes without Bette (Tulsa and Louise dancing to ""All I Need is the Girl"", Louise and June singing ""If Mama Was Married"", the strippers demonstrating the secrets of their success for Louise ... even Louise singing ""Little Lamb"" (probably the weakest song in the score) are all lovely and enjoyable. But then Rose comes back and starts chewing up the scenery, and all is lost again.

Really disapointing, because if Bette could have just turned it down a couple of notches, the production would have been almost flawless.",1152230400,6,1085,4.520408163265306
538294,5,6302977193,"Gypsy was a popular stage show with Ethel Merman with music by Jule Styne & Stephen Sondheim. From Everything is Comin Up Roses to Let Me Entertain You this show has many great songs. Filmed by Warner Bros with Rosalind Russell as Mama Rose & Natalie Wood as her daughter Rose who became Gypsy Rose Lee, this TV version(1993) is highly entertaining and runs the 150mins of the Warner film. Bette Midler plays her part well in a story that is very reminiscent of an era that was once in US live theatre. The opening credits depicts stills of performers in stills from this long gone era. I have the original Laserdisc of this TV version from its original issue and I was pleased to be able to get the DVD into my collection. It will be regularly run for my enjoyment. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to collectors of stage musical material.",1152057600,4,826,4.513333333333334
538295,1,6302977193,"Bette Midler has oodles of talent,we just don't get much of it here! In this version of Gypsy,Ms. Midler is either doing the show because someone told her she should,or,she did it to give Ethel Merman a run for her money! Rest easy Ethel! I did not get the feeling that her heart was in this performance. If Ego were shoes,Bette wears a size 13 in this performance,but unfortunately,she only has size 7 1/2 feet to fill them. I would disagree with some of the other comments on this version as well. I have seen Ethel Merman on BROADWAY,Rosalind Russell w/Karl Malden and Bette.

  Ethel has the voice, Rosalind is the superb actress in the role,(and suprisingly talented with her rendition of the score),

but Bette is neither. I suppose it's been a long,hard road since the days of ""The Rose""!?

  If you're into the musical score primarily,get the CD with Ethel,(all the songs are there). If your into the best all round show,Get Rosalind Russell, Karl Malden and Natalie Wood,(who,by the way is the best Gypsy Rose Lee of any production),the only drawback to this show is the editing out of 'Together wherever we go'

 If you're into throwing away your money on a lack luster performance,but just have to have everything Bette's ever done,go ahead. P.S. One more further comment on casting; It seems Midler knew she wasn't up to the project so insisted that nobody had more talent than she. Either that,or the casting director threw darts on a list of available names and went for it! If Midler's performance was disappointing, the rest of the cast's were just downright forgettable. This proves an 'ism' on stage AND film; When the show features a headliner with a bunch of nobodys,it spells Ego Grandstanding, not quality.",1141689600,7,1728,4.771812080536913

Naturally, that meant when I saw this in the Gold Box deals I went nuts and bought it right away! It came in perfect condition, and rather quickly as well (I ordered from the US to Canada).

It's a great movie, definitely better in a lot of parts than the Rosalind Russell version. Though the perfect film would be Rosalind Russell's voice, Bette Midler and Natalie Wood's acting, and the more 'open' way that the Midler version is presented. I would recommend this for any fan of burlesque or Bette Midler or musicals in general!",1125964800,2,699,4.4186046511627906

The production maintains the ""stage presence"" instead of trying to make it look like a movie set--a brilliant decision.  Midler captures the true strength and vulnerability of the character of Mama Rose in a way that no others have done before.  I have seen Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daley, Bernadette Peters and others perform in this show--one of my favorites.  None of them has been able to deliver like Bette.  Don't miss this one.

Not only was the Midler version far superior to the Russel one(though at moments there were glimmers in that one),but frankly I enjoyed it more than even the Peters rendition(which I enjoyed immensely) live in NYC!All three ladies mentioned are wonderful yet entirely different Madame Roses. What really clicked for me in this 1993 production was the supporting cast namely Cynthia Gibb as Louise and the ever consistently brilliant Christine Ebersole as Tessie Tura. Both performers were at the top IMO.This show is great material for super actors and this movie version,totally faithful to the original stage play( that is refreshing!)fires on all cylindars. The ride is jaunty and hilarious. Peter Riegert's timid Herbie is all the better when he finally unleashes on Rose.""Finally"" I said,""he got some nerve!"" Bette Midler is as marvelous as she always is. She was made for this role. I would be hard pressed to find another reason to remake this show again. This was as good as it gets.

538390,1,6302977193,"Though this ""Gypsy"" gets points or point for being the closest to the stage script, Midler is a two-dimensional battle-axe in a role that is one of the richest in American drama. There are no relationships in the film, no love, no nothin'. Rose is just a harpy stripped of any emotion. Anyone who saw Tyne Daly, Angela Lansbury, Ethel Merman or even the miscast Rosalind Russell will find this wanting. Particularly a shame as Daly was a major television star she wasn't used; or that Midler, who's a delightful comic personality, didn't have the chops, but this is a ""Gypsy"" only for those who don't know the work. If Midler is the only Rose you've seen she may cut it; for the rest of us, a major disapppointment.",1089158400,3,715,4.550387596899225

538392,3,6302977193,"Bette Midler as Gypsy! Sounded like dream casting. But Bette Midler unfortunately plays Bette Midler and forgets to truly develop the role of Mama Rose. Bette, who used to be a good actress, kind of gives the role lots of chutzpah but nothing more. Peter Reigert makes an interesting Herbie. For true scene munching and much better musical theatre goodies see the Gypsy with Roz Russel and Natalie Wood. One only need compare the two Mama Roses to see how Roz developed a character , while Bette
hasn't developed a character since the Rose. Why do actresses get lazy when they get successful?",1009411200,6,592,4.757281553398058
538511,5,6302977193,"Bette Midler is an outstanding triumph in this made-for-TV movie.  Unlike the 1962 film with Rosalind Russell, Midler plays the part with quite a bit more depth and with a much darker undertone.  Russell was still riding high from her Aunite Mame success and tried to recapture the madcap Mame character in her version.  Midler ignores all other portrayals and brings a definite sense of drama to the part of Mama Rose, something the part of the scrounging, pushy, overwrought character needs.  The comedy is definitely there, but even it is undetoned with drama.  Midler's pop culture voice may be a little unsuited, but it does keep the film lighter and airier than it otherwise would have been.  It also emphasizes the success story of Gypsy Rose Lee.  Her story was a tragedy, and the success in itself was tragic.  Midler also brings so much more to the demented, delusional, nervous breakdown of Mama Rose at the end of the film, heightened by her show-stopping rendition of Rose's Turn.  Midler's performance almost makes you feel sorry for Mama Rose, but at the same time accomplishes the intended action, making you very wary of her.
Cynthia Gibbs also portrays Gypsy better than most.  She makes the part come alive with drama of her own.  Peter Riegert as the long-suffering Herbie is on a par with Midler, an accomplishment in itself.
This film is a definite success despite its anit-Cinderella storyline.  Gypsy says something fairly hard to take.  Every child eventually has to be responsible for their parents-that you outgrow your parents, and eventually they become your children.
While no production of Gypsy will ever equal Ethel Merman's performance, as it was tailor-made for her, this one comes close.  Midler takes the show and runs with it, giving Mama Rose a rather different portrayal than usual, but one that is much loved and wanted.  If you watched the 1962 film and didn't quite get all the undertones, this film bursts them open and makes them clear.",996105600,17,1981,4.889221556886228
538512,5,6302977193,"This made-for-TV version of the classic Broadway show GYPSY is remarkable.  It sticks primarily to what to see if you were in a theatre.  The show is essentially what you would see if you were on Broadway.
Bette Midler is dynamite as Mama Rose, the ultimate stage mother.  She reportedly recorded most of her songs live, without the pre-recorded vocal track.  The role had been a dream of Midler's for years.  She makes an indelible impression in the role.
Cynthia Gibb (THE KAREN CARPENTER STORY) plays Louise, who would blossom into the burlesque stripper Gypsy Rose Lee.  She has a pleasant singing voice and charming acting style.  She has been highly acclaimed for her performance here.
Peter Riegert plays Herbie, Rose's love interest.  In a very under-developed and not very well-written role, Riegert tries his best.  He also sings wonderfully.
In supporting roles are Jennifer Beck as June, Christine Ebersole as Tessie Tura, Anna McNeely as Elektra, Linda Hart as Mazeppa, and Jeffrey Broadhurst as Tulsa.
A glittering, lavish, explosive production that can be revisited again and again.",988761600,32,1097,5.117977528089888
538513,5,6302977193,"Well, I was a bit skeptical of this when I first sat down to watch it. Although I was a big fan of Stephen Sondheim and Jerome Robbins, all I knew about this was that it had ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"", a song I had found to be all-too-optimistic-and-cheerful. However, when watching, I soon learned that the song is usually sung in a completely different context than its original. This is a marvelous version, far superior to the 1962 film. Bette captures the nightmarish, melodramatic personality of Mama Rose perfectly, and Cynthia Gibb is a wonderfully innocent - though later very much grown-up - Louise. Be warned - if all you know from Gypsy is ""Everything's Coming Up Roses"" and ""Small World"", you're in for a big surprise. Gypsy is a brilliantly dark story about a mother who pushes one daughter into showbusiness while at the same time ignoring the other, pushing one to the point of running off, and then forcing the other into stripping. This is an incredible play, and the film equals it (at least!).",980640000,12,1017,4.719101123595506

Unfortunately, despite Bette Midler's talent in areas where she  herself can shine, her voice is not well suited to the score.  Of course,  anyone would find Ethel Merman a ""hard act to follow"" as Mama  Rose, but Bette's voice tended to sound very strained.

Acting is  better than average for a film musical, and the overall presentation is  enjoyable, but Bette's voice being unsuitable to the wonderful score is a  disappointment.",964051200,19,653,4.962962962962963
538516,5,6302977193,"Finally, a film version that does this classic show justice.  It keeps the original book intact, along with Jerome Robbin's expert choreography, adds some smart dierection and a tour-de-force performance by Midler.  Though  Midler may look a little too young to play Mama Rose, she pulls off the  part remarkably well.  You can see her determination to make her daughters  succeed and deep sadness at her own failures in songs like ""Some  People,"" ""Everything's Comming Up Roses,"" and ""Mama's  Turn.""  The movies fine script really gives Bette something to work  with in term of character development and she succeeds.  The supporting  cast is strong enough to stand up against Bette, which is saying a lot.  The actress playing the title character really evolves throughought the  show from a meek tom-boy to a successful stripper.  She handles not only  both ends of the spectrum, but everything in between as well.  The music,  of course, is wonderful, and it's giving good showing in this production.  _Gypsy_ is a wonderful show, and its a good thing someone came along to  preserve it the way it should be done.",958521600,26,1117,4.935135135135135

These two things don't go together.  The lyrics couldn't decide whether this was a farce or a drama.  They were better as drama, and stupid as comedy (Mr. Goldstone).  Louise was wonderful at first.

7835054,4,6302977193,"The Divine Miss M. should have played Mama Rose on Broadway in a revival production of ""Gypsy."" Bette Midler channels her Ethel Merman to play the part and does an excellent job in playing the controversial ultimate stage mother with a first rate cast. Peter Riegert played long-suffering manager, Herbie, and Fame's Cynthia Gibb played Louise (who becomes Gypsy Rose Lee).

This musical film was aired on television and was faithful to the musical production. The director, Emile Ardolino, also directed the classic sleeper hit, ""Dirty Dancing."" This television version is first rate and earned an Emmy Award for Bette Midler in this performance. It was well deserved. Apart from Ethel Merman as Mama Rose, Bette Midler has made this role her own. The film includes an excellent supporting cast including Ed Asner, Tony Shaloub, Michael Jeter, Andrea Martin and Christine Ebersole as well.

If you want a faithful version of the musical, ""Gypsy,"" this version stays faithful to the stage production. It doesn't feel like you're watching a staged production. There is no audience and the film was largely filmed indoors. The music and book remains true to the stage production though. If you wonder why ""Gypsy"" is still popular and revived, you will wonder no more.

Unfortunately, this DVD doesn't include any special features about the cast, the musical and the adaptation from stage to screen as well but it still worth watching again and again.

I'm a big Bette Midler fan, but, I just felt something was missing. Had I never seen the original, I guess this would be the best. There's that mess by Imalda Staunton who bellows her way through and seldom looks at the other actors. I think Imalda is a great actress and a pretty good singer, but, when you keep turning the volume down and need a Valium at the end of the 1st act....hmmmm. Back to Bette and her version. Costumes by Bob Mackie and beautifully done. The supporting cast was OK. Actually, Tessie, Mazzepa and Electra were right up there with the originals if not even better. Tulsa was good, but, not as good as the original. The role of Herbie isn't much to begin with and paled to Karl Malden's version in the original. Overall.....enjoyable.
