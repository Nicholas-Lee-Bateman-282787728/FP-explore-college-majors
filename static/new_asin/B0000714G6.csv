7973701,3,B0000714G6,"I have always liked William Saroyan's books, and was curious to see these two plays by him.
Interesting to see Walter Matthau and Orson Bean acting in the early days of black and white TV drama. Larry Hagman
is also very good in a small part, in the first play. Not great plays, really, but if you're a Saroyan fan, you might enjoy
seeing them. I enjoyed ""Once Around the Block,"" but the characters and dialog in ""My Heart's in the Highlands""
make for a not very interesting play. Other Saroyan fans might not agree, though.",1518393600,,524,4.46875
