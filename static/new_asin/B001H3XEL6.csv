8336151,5,B001H3XEL6,"I first saw a few episodes of this telenovela when it originally aired but never had the chance to see the whole thing. I've now watched it through twice, and just love it. Although the story sometimes dips a little too deeply into the stock story elements of regular Mexican telenovelas (e.g., women is told her lover is dead, marries another whom she really doesn't love, but ""what the hell,"" then it turns out, oops, her true love isn't dead after all, ""dios mio, what now?!""), it does a very good job of weaving fictional characters and story lines into a sound, factually based historical narrative. Production values aren't always the highest, especially in big battle scenes, and can be a little slow moving at times, but over all, it is very good edutainment. Also has lots of trains, which for me is a plus.",1330646400,3,816,4.63448275862069
