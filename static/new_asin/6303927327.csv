7855523,5,6303927327,"Broadcast shortly before Dean Martin's death in December 1995, this A&E ""Biography"" provides an excellent overview of the singer-comedian's life and career during its 50-minute length. Good interviews with Jerry Lewis, Jeanne Martin and producer-director Greg Garrison - plus a generous selection of clips from Dean's classic NBC variety show. An insightful program that compares favorably with the 1983 BBC documentary ""Wine, Women and Song.""",1283558400,2,443,5.8307692307692305
7855524,5,6303927327,"Fantastic biography, a must for any Dean Martin fan.  While including life with Jerry and the Rat Pack, this story steps back and focuses on the man himself, including both his business and private life. From card shark to prize fighter this was a man of the ages.  There will never be another Dean.",1168819200,2,299,4.518518518518518
7855525,5,6303927327,"I think this version is just a transfer from VHS to DVD without any updating, and that would explain the lack of information about Dean's passing on Christmas Day 1995. The reviews about the VHS version are very good so I'll touch on just some of the highlights here. The DVD doesn't have any ""special features"" like most do, but that doesn't take anything away from the great stuff in it. It only has 6 ""scene selection"" choices but this program is so good that you won't want to ""pick up the action"" anywhere but at the beginning. The greatest comments and insights about Dean come from Jerry Lewis. I always thought that he & Dean hated each other when they broke up in the 1950's but Jerry reveals otherwise. Greg Garrison, Frank Sinatra, Joey Bishop, Jeannie Martin and even Dean himself share some great information about Dean's life. (No Sammy Davis comments but I think he died before this came out.) Narrated by Peter Graves, he comments on Dean's life from his Dad coming to America in 1914, through Dean's struggle to find work in the depression years to his becoming the highest paid entertainer of that time. The 2 greatest scenes in the program are the reuniting of Dean & Jerry on the 1976 Labor Day telethon and Dean's 72nd birthday surprise in 1986. Each one got a surprise! First Jerry on the telethon, then Dean on his birthday. The reason; they hadn't spoken for 20 years when the telethon aired and after that meeting, they didn't speak for the next 10 years until the birthday surprise! There are clips from The Vegas Rat Pack shows, Dean's TV shows, one from the ""roasting"" of Jack Benny and scenes from a couple of Dean's movies. The sound & picture quality are excellent and I only wish the show was longer and included more show clips.",1138060800,14,1761,4.575949367088608
7855526,5,6303927327,"I thought I was the only one who enjoyed his music and his TV variety shows. This tape really points out what a fine talent he was. He never really blew his own horn, he just did his thing and let the chips fall where they may. Frank always took the center  stage but he didn't have the timing Dean had and I also felt Dean sang much better, altho Frank did okay with some songs. I think he got much more publicity, but Dean didn't care. I really miss the guy, thankfully there are still some great CD's out there to listen to.",995587200,16,527,4.0673076923076925
7855527,5,6303927327,"If you don't have this tape in your collection it is an absolute must! It's one of the finest in the Biography series. Dean was one of the most entertaining figures of the 20th century and this tape is a fantastic look  at his life, from beginning to lonely end. I met Dean on numerous occasions  and this tape will make you feel like you've met him yourself. A classy  look at a classy guy! Enjoy!",945216000,15,398,4.2105263157894735
