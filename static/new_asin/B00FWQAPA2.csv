6034312,2,B00FWQAPA2,The actors (except Erik Estrada of course) was not as convincing in their roles. I like the plot but some parts was a bit much.,1397088000,,127,4.12
6034313,5,B00FWQAPA2,Good movie but based on actual events....Scary that young people actually fall into this and get kidnapped. Good warning movie for teens to see to show them what can happen with online predators. Good acting! Erik Estrada seemed like his Chips days except a bit more grey! Would recommend for Youth groups and parents also. Wake up call!,1396396800,,337,4.827586206896552
6034314,5,B00FWQAPA2,"This is a great movie that shares the reality of the ""sex slavery"" that's going on in America and sweeping across the world. It doesn't use graphic sexual content to prove it's point, which I think is important. Most movies have a bunch of nearly naked women and advertisements ""revealing"" the sex industry. I understand the point, but at the same time, I think it is just as harmful putting it all in a video for people to view -- enlightening, or not. However, this movie sheds light on the subject in a wholesome, yet powerful way. I do recommend others watch it.",1396137600,14,566,4.504854368932039
6034315,5,B00FWQAPA2,"well acted.  I think every family with teenager's should get it.  I am going to watch it over and over.  It was intense.  Sad and very
on the edge of my seat.",1395619200,,158,3.84375
6034316,4,B00FWQAPA2,Faith's mother didn't know how to really act out her role. Their was also other actors that didn't feel the story. I rated 4 stars cause It was a good message after all. Thanks and God Bless,1394236800,,190,4.162162162162162

6034318,5,B00FWQAPA2,"This is a hard to watch movie about online predators and the people involved in sex trafficking.  It is very important that parents watch this with their 10 and above kids who have any kind of online profile, Twitter, Facebook, etc.",1392681600,,232,4.658536585365853
6034319,3,B00FWQAPA2,"Truly enjoyed the message of the movie.  Even though some of the acting was not the best.  The mom was not as believable as she could or should have been.  The emotion should have been through the roof, but was missing in key areas.  All in all, I enjoyed the movie but wished I could have directed it!

6034320,3,B00FWQAPA2,"The Garretts are a model family for their church and community, but when an online predator abducts 14-year-old Faith Garrett (Stephanie Bettcher), their faith is pushed to the breaking point.

Erik Estrada(CHiPs) stars in this powerful story, inspired by actual events. The desperate search for Faith brings her family, church, and community to their knees, threatening to either tear them apart or strengthen their faith as never before. From Sheriff Mike Brown comes a compelling faith-based film about Internet safety every family needs to watch together.",1391731200,3,559,5.5

6034323,2,B00FWQAPA2,"way too religious for my liking and some of the acting isn't very convincing.it seems like they're trying to make religion more of the main idea than the kidnapping itself.plus how was she so stupid,that picture of ""ed blue"" was clearly fake.she was way too naive.i understand she was only 14 but come on.",1461974400,,305,4.666666666666667

6034325,4,B00FWQAPA2,This movie was very good.  One thing that they did an excellent job of was to show the dangers our children can face using social media.
