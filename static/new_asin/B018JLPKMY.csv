8742565,5,B018JLPKMY,"This DVD is collection of 2D animated stories that are both educational and entertaining. I like this series because it teaches children to ask questions about things they are curious about.  The lead character, Mily is a girl who asks everyone questions. Mily asks questions about typical things that kids are thinking and about everyday situations as well. The show originated in France.

I like the style of the animation. The background of each scene is an actual photo of where it takes place, such as a kitchen. We see an actual photo of a kitchen. The characters animation is over the background. I found that cool because Ive never seen that before in animation.

The message of this movie is to ask questions when you wonder about things. It teaches kids to ask questions even if they seems dumb. If someone doesnt know something, they have the right to ask.  No one should judge them for asking. It also teaches kids to be creative. In one of the episodes, Mily gets bored and doesnt know what to do. Her friends come up with ideas to keep her from not being bored. They get creative and make games.

My favorite character is Milys little sister Lola because she nags Mily in a funny way. She annoys Mily sometimes but you can tell that they love each other. I love how she helps Mily with her questions. She may be younger but she helps Mily a lot.

I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 5 to 10. This DVD is available now wherever DVDs are sold so, be sure to look for it.
