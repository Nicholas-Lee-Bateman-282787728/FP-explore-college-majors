5135334,4,B0087ITBFC,"After seeing a Wei Wei exhibit at the Hirshhorn, I was interested in knowing more about his work, about him, and about his thinking and processes. This video was biography, examination of technique and thought processes, and looking at his work(s). Documentary itself is interestingly put together--not sure I could say how, exactly, but it certainly is NOT a typical, chronological bio. It's fascinating . . . .",1356739200,,412,5.073529411764706
5135335,3,B0087ITBFC,"""Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry"" explores the recent life and politics of Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, who came to international fame in 2008 when he repudiated the Olympic Games in Beijing, even though he had contributed to the architectural design of its ""Bird's Nest"" stadium. Filmmaker Alison Klayman focuses on the years since then, as this is when Ai entered the public consciousness, though she does explore the artist's background in interviews with his brother and mother and a report on the time he spent in New York in the 1980s. Ai's recent political causes are interwoven with explorations of his art and a personal portrait. Klayman had very good access to Ai Weiwei, and he generally seems forthcoming, but the film's lack of focus and unwillingness to ask intelligent questions make it more of a fan documentary than an informative one.

Ai Weiwei came to the attention of Chinese as a political figure not long before he erupted onto the international scene as a ""dissident artist"", when he blogged about the lack of transparency surrounding the substandard schoolhouse construction that killed so many children when the buildings collapsed as a result of the Sichuan earthquake in May 2008. The Chinese government shut down his blog and put him under surveillance, so Ai turned to Twitter, where he has been posting politically charged tweets ever since. Ai attempted to testify at the trial of Tan Zuoren, another earthquake activist sentenced to prison for his writings, but was prevented from doing so by police who detained him at his hotel and gave him a head injury, for which he persistently seeks justice through the Chinese bureaucracy. These events are covered in the film.

Artists, art critics, journalists and some famous Chinese personalities contribute their views of Ai Weiwei. Many of the more insightful comments come from The New Yorker's China correspondent Evan Osnos, who inadvertently provides something akin to a narration in parts of this film. I wish other interviews were as good, but the filmmakers never seem to ask the important questions, not even of Osnos. There is no attempt to address how Chinese people see Ai Weiwei or what impact his activism has had. It is not clear what Ai's goals are, how he sees himself in context, or what he believes he has accomplished. Are a wall of names of dead children in his office and memorials years after the event the best way to convince the government to investigate corruption or to improve school construction? Or is it just morbid self-indulgence? We don't know.

Ai Weiwei gained notoriety for his ""quick, controversial gestures"", but his goals and worldview are elusive. Is he trying to be the radical who creates opportunity for others who appear more accommodating to advance the agenda? Or should his rhetoric be taken literally? I'm not sure he knows. Ai is new to political dissidence. He is a social critic. He tweets only in Chinese, but the free speech and democracy rhetoric is Western. How does this go over in China? Who are his followers? ""Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry"" doesn't ask these questions, much less answer them. Though confrontational, Ai seems patient with the system in China. And it is surprisingly patient with him until someone decides he might be a genuine threat. That happened in 2011 in the wake of civil unrest in the Middle East. He was detained but not injured. That's where the film ends.

The DVD (MPI Home Video 2012): There are some deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer (2  min), and 5 additional interviews (23 min), including 2 more stories from his brother, a tour of the Beijing studio, more interviews about the Tate sunflower exhibit, an interview with 2 women who translate his Twitter stream, and a New York Times OpDoc ""The Evolution of a Dissident"". There is an audio commentary by director Alison Klayman, producer Colin Jones, and editor Jen Fineran. The discuss their observations of Ai Weiwei, more about the people who appear in the film, some elaboration on the issues the film addresses, and the director's choices. The commentary is conversational in tone. The film is in English and Mandarin with English subtitles. Subtitles are also available in English SDH, Spanish, and Simplified Chinese.",1356048000,6,4231,4.978783592644978
5135336,5,B0087ITBFC,"There are always people criticize Ai weiwei as one nothing special old man but do all kinds of ridiculous actions to attract attention and fame and such. In this film, you can see how he indeed puts his life into what he think he should stand up, even the opposed side is a powerful, unpredictable giant. Ai weiwei does not say anything too vague or use any special smart words, and like his artworks, they are simply clear, direct, bold and powerful. China should be thankful that they have Ai weiwei as a Chinese artist, who care about the country, like other active artists, politicians, writers, and people who put effort for a better society where people are free to express. This film is not just for artistic people, is for everybody, the common folks, it will make you to question about the essence of human right and life.",1354924800,6,831,4.583892617449664
5135337,5,B0087ITBFC,"This documentary is one of the greatest documentaries of our global times and is essential viewing for everyone, even if you are not that interested in China or don't know who `Ai Wei Wei' is. After watching this, you will come to understand how important a figure he is, not just for Chinese citizens, but for the sake of the global community because of the grave dangers of the rising power of the nation of China and its abuses of human rights, freedom of speech, thoughts, beliefs and expression which are fundamental rights for every living person in the world today.

Watching it will touch a great span of emotions from fear to courage, from disillusionment to hope, and from tears to laughter; it will unveil actions from the barbaric to thoughtful ones based on the love for humanity; it will express the light-hearted humour that delights the youthful spirit in all of us against a backdrop of the grimness of politics seeped in corruption; and reveals the power of creativity that sparks spontaneously under an umbrella of suppression, fear and injustice.

In face of heavy challenges that most people can only imagine, Ai Wei Wei keeps moving forward one step ahead of a mechanical, inhumane authoritarian Communist Party government like a grand chess champion. He admits he is scared, but is defiant that there can be no retreat as there is real danger and if he does not keep pushing forward, the danger will only become greater. One thing he does not know or admit, is that the government is in greater fear for what Ai Wei Wei's courage, wit, wisdom and dogged determination will do by unveiling to the public for all to see using the marvels of modern technology such as social media - not just for the Chinese public, but for the whole international public to scrutinize (esp. now that this documentary is available for all to see).

The Chinese Communist Party is using all its manipulative, corrupt and deceiving tactics to control its citizens through propaganda, threats and violence, but this kind of archaic regime has no place in today's modern, global community where human rights should be respected and governments should no longer be able to hide behind an opaque screen to hide its corruption. Transparency such as what this documentary unveils is the only way such a suppressive regime can be forced to face itself and change for the better. Everyone in the international community needs to stand up and to keep speaking out against these injustices and abuses which has gone on for far too long.

I have already ordered two DVDs myself for future viewings - something I have never done with any other DVD release, and will encourage as many people as I can to see it.

By watching `Never Sorry', you will suddenly awaken to a whole new dimension of gratitude to the liberty that you take for granted each day and you will empathise for those living in certain countries who are still fighting for theirs. I gave a standing ovation to Ai Wei Wei for his courage and ability to listen to his conscience within to act against overwhelming forces. Let's support him by assisting in whatever way we can in bringing democracy to the people of China and for a more peaceful world.",1352851200,5,3205,4.746858168761221

5135339,3,B0087ITBFC,"A good but biased documentary. Its good because it gave a close look at the artist, Ai Weiwei. However, they didn't interview any artist or anyone else for that matter, that didn't agree with what Ai Weiwei was doing. Surely he had critics! The man is not perfect. Surely there was someone out there, who wasn't pro government, who wasn't a Chinese government mouthpiece, who still had criticisms about Ai Weiwei. Is he doing this to get attention? Is he sincere? Isn't it ironic that the failings of the Chinese government is fodder for his art, and in turn, profits Ai Weiwei? Is there truth to the tax evasion accusations? Finally, the man is who he is because of his history, yet the coverage of his time in New York, how he financed himself during this period, and the art pieces that he did, was cursory and tepid. This movie is still worth watching but more because there's no few documentaries of this ilk, than because this was a well produced documentary.",1352505600,4,965,4.616279069767442
5135340,2,B0087ITBFC,"This has been released on a B locked disc in Europe and this review is based on that disc. Pehaps the US release will be better but I think this is not likely so be careful. Technically the video is very good indeed but the audio and subtitles are a disaster. Starting with the interview, it is filmed outside with frequent wind noise - technically of very poor quality - and NO SUB TITLES so one can hardly follow what is said. The main program is not a lot better, no subtitles are offered when Chinese is not spoken and the English is heavily accented and it hops about with words in Chinese then a phrase in English and so on. No thought has been given to the unfortunate viewer at all.
The main program has full access to the charismatic Ai Wei Wei and as such it is interesting. It is however very poorly put together and is heavily critical of the Chinese goverrnment. I have no problem with that, they deserve it but I did not feel the way it was done was as skilled as it might have been. If you can pick this up dirt cheap it is worth a watch for those interested in China but it is not worth full price.",1351900800,4,1114,4.138248847926267
5135341,4,B0087ITBFC,"What a fascinating story! Ai Weiwei is the Chinese Artist/Dissident who boycotted the 2008 Chinese Olympics as a protest against the government's treatment of the people displaced by the Bird's-Nest Stadium in Beijing (he had been an artist/consultant for the project). After people's homes were condemned and demolished, they were hustled out of town for the duration of the Olympics because they weren't acceptable photo ops for visitors.

As he mastered the power of social network tools (he LOVES the Internet!), the government shut down his blog but he switched to Twitter and went to the site of the horrific Sichuan earthquake, where almost 5,000 school children died in shoddily built schools. Weiwei and his acolytes were on the spot, video cameras and cell phones in constant use. They gathered every name (most victims were an only child) and not only posted them on the wall in his studio, he coordinated an amazing project where people from everywhere contacted his Twitter site and each person read off a name, one by one, for everyone to hear and remember. It is phenomenal.

This guy is the perfect topic for a documentary: he spent 10 years in New York City, mastered English (he has an admirable vocabulary!), learned to love corned beef sandwiches, and watched the U. S. Government sue itself during the Iran/Contra hearings. He went back to China suitably impressed. He has observed that some of his stray cats have learned to open doors (with the lever-type door knob), but that they NEVER shut the door afterwards! While he was under police surveillance, he had his own cameraman shooting footage of the police cameraman; and of course, there is a third cameraman recording their encounter for posterity. It's pretty funny! Our 2012 Seattle International Film Festival audience enjoyed it immensely!

Weiwei is smart, articulate, original and charismatic...and despite the Chinese government's best efforts, his story is on-going. I haven't told you a fraction of what you will see in this documentary! Grab this one as soon as Amazon.com makes it available.",1348444800,23,2080,5.093841642228739
5135342,5,B0087ITBFC,"The Ai Wei Wei movie, Never Sorry, is eyeopening for those who care about Art.  After viewing it, I knew I would be thinking about it for a long time.  Ai Wei Wei is a man of enormous energy and charisma and charm mixed with real intelligence, whose art is more than pictures or color or shape, but includes action and response and challenge.  And, a call to action.  To watch him respond to the mindless bureaucratic enforcement of a police state is dazzling and comic and moving.  The intelligence of his response is eye-opening and just amazing.  And, the Sunflower Seeds exhibit at the Tate were revealed to be an emotionally moving work of art.
I long to find a dvd, which I assume  must vecome available because I want everyone I know to see it.  Never Sorry captured me.  Not only is AWW a rare individual, he raises issues of cultural history, activism, politics, and really, the breadth of Art.  I was struck by thinking, despite his family history, Chinese politics and our reaction to both, that in some way AWW, as an artist, was very much formed by his years in New York city.  The sense that a powerful artist can connect cultures via Art and maybe move the politics of a nation, suggests, wildly positively, that art is human and universal in the best senses of both words.",1348012800,11,1288,4.508620689655173

5135376,5,B0087ITBFC,"At first glance, the cameras that surround the studio of Chinese artist Ai Weiwei appear to have been placed by the man himself as a mode of security. It is not until the lens of Beijing journalist Alison Klayman pulls in for a closer look that the troubling truth is revealed. These cameras in fact represent the ever-watchful eye of a frightened government that Ai Weiwei views as his opponent in an eternal chess match.

Moviegoers unfamiliar with the fearless titular muckraker of Klayman's invaluable documentary, Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry, are practically guaranteed to become instant fans after seeing this richly involving portrait. There is perhaps no greater champion of individuality and its inherent power than this controversial icon, whose distinctive works powerfully function as both art and political statements. Consider his famous photographs in which he shatters a Han Dynasty vase, thus conveying that the past, however sacred, must be done away with in order for necessary reform to be achieved.

Ai Weiwei's field of 100 million individually-made sunflower seeds represent the diversity of ideas that remain repressed by the bureaucratic regulations of his country's communist party. No doubt some of his revolutionary spirit rubbed off on Klayman, who utilizes various clips from Ai Weiwei's self-made documentaries that he distributed for free online. The footage chronicles his activism and the abuse that he has endured at the hands of government officials. Klayman has echoed her subject's philosophy by openly admitting in interviews that she hopes her film will be pirated, acknowledging that such a crime could help spread Ai Weiwei's message past the boundaries of American art houses.

This is not the sort of stuffy, pompously ponderous doc that audiences view as the cinematic equivalent of nutritious yet tasteless vegetables. Klayman has made an immensely entertaining picture that garners a great deal of its mileage from the irrepressible charisma of Ai Weiwei himself, who subsequently appeared in his own send-up of PSY's ""Gangnam Style"" video. He is not above poking fun at himself, but he is immensely serious when it come to the message that he intends to convey through his work. There is a visceral thrill in watching him thrust his middle finger at corrupted monuments such as the White House and the Bird's Nest Olympic Stadium for which he served as an artistic consultant. He quickly turned his back on the Olympic Games in protest upon learning of the migrant workers being forced out of Beijing prior to the festivities.

One of the most powerful sections in the film centers on Ai Weiwei's enraged response to his government's utter refusal to investigate the faulty construction that may have dramatically increased the number of schoolchildren who perished in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. To further avoid sullying China's image, the government did not even make an effort to release the names of the deceased children, a disgrace that prompted Ai Weiwei to collect them himself. After posting the names on his blog to commemorate the one year anniversary of the tragedy, he displayed them in the form of a massive list accompanied by the audio recording of citizens reciting the names. Suddenly, the simple profession of the children's' very existence became an act of rebellion in itself.

Klayman's film takes the form of a thriller as it explores Ai Weiwei's failed attempt to testify at the court hearing of Tan Zuoren, a fellow investigator of the student lives claimed by the earthquake. Audio was captured of the violence the occurred when Chengdu police broke into the artist's hotel room and bludgeoned his head, causing a cerebral hemorrhage that required emergency brain surgery. With a boldness evocative of vintage Michael Moore, Ai Weiwei confronts one of the officers who beat him while being followed by his trusted crew. It is clear to him as it is to the viewer that justice will continually evade his grasp, but that is not reason enough for Ai Weiwei to give up on his righteous crusade. He may not receive an apology from the cop, but at least he will capture his sorry face on camera.

The story that Klayman unspools is so compelling that it registers as somewhat of a disappointment when it ultimately proves to be unfinished. Ai Weiwei's 81-day incarceration where he endured psychological torture at the hands of police received an international outcry in favor of the artist's release. Following his bail in 2011, Ai Weiwei was unable to give interviews and was not even permitted to leave the country. Klayman's decision to end her film in the midst of this dire crisis was perhaps unavoidable since the artist's unquenchable hunger to provoke ensures that his troubles with police will continue until his dying day. Though police claim that Ai Weiwei was arrested purely in the basis of tax evasion charges, Klayman's film makes a thoroughly convincing argument to the contrary.

At an effortlessly watchable 91 minutes, the film does leave certain aspects of Ai Weiwei's life underdeveloped, particularly his complex relationship with his devoted wife, who conspicuously vanishes from the film after it is revealed that her husband had a child with another woman. This detail may seem irrelevant to the film's central subject matter, but it is crucial in portraying Ai Weiwei as a flawed human being rather than a larger-than-lie saint. He has no desire to be worshipped, anyway. His single hope is that the vital truths his work illuminates will resonate with the multitudes, and that is precisely what has begun to happen. Ai Weiwei's status as a close runner-up for Time's Person of 2011 parallels the triumph of Chinese writer Liu Xiaobo, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize soon after being sentenced to 11 year in prison for ""inciting subversion of state power."" If these extraordinary activists prove anything at all, it is that one's power and influence can indeed transcend the boundaries of a governmental gag order. Ai Weiwei is more than a mere artist or activist. He is an indomitable force on nature.",1397520000,,6099,5.0869130869130865

5135379,5,B0087ITBFC,"Throughout history there are people who just don't care how those in power feel. They don't care how those in power might punish their arrogance. These carelessly brave souls have walked the paths of all sorts of lives. Many have been artists. They have manifested their thoughts about the powerful into paintings and sculptures. One such person is Ai Weiwei, artist and activist for human rights, son of wrongfully disgraced poet, Ai Qing. It is Ai Weiweis middle finger directed at the Forbidden City that graces the poster art for the documentary about his lifes work of art and campaign for government transparency in The Peoples Republic of China. Because, Ai Weiwei doesnt care.

 The film, directed by Alison Klayman, balances some of Weiweis personal history, like as a child watching his father, an ardent party member, being publicly disgraced. It covers some of his time in New York and the art scene there. It glosses over his marriage, his affair and the adorable son it produced. However, the focus is not Weiwei, the father, the husband, the lover, it is Ai Weiwei the artist. So, the film stays with the art he makes and why he makes it. It shows how he uses his art to shine a bright light of embarrassment upon how poorly the party handles corruption and treats the poor. For example, the activism that made him internationally famous was the government coverup of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.

 During this earthquake several government buildings, most schools and many of them elementary schools, collapsed and killed thousands of children. It was uncovered that the buildings were tofu constructions, or paper buildings. All were weak and under code. They were built this way because of greed and it killed over five thousand children. Of course, the Party keeps those numbers hidden and offered nothing, no compensation or justice, to the parents of those lost. They even went so far as to punish some parents for speaking out. The numbers that were made public came from Ai Weiwei and his team of helpers who researched the disaster and found over five thousand names of confirmed dead or missing children. These names lead to projects like recording people reading the names of the dead and publishing them on the internet. Or his famous piece Remembering, which was made of childrens backpacks, like the ones he kept finding in the wreckage of schools. He use them to spell out one mothers words about her deceased daughter, She lived happily for seven years on this earth.

 The film doesnt stay just on this earthquake coverup. It bounces around to other works of art that comment on other issues, like cheap mass production, as showcased by his sunflower seeds exhibition at Tate Modern in London. The film also follows Ai Weiweis encounters with the government. In one case he was beaten by a police officer. So, throughout the film we see him and his team file complaint after complaint with the police station to report the abuse. We also get to see Weiwei face down the cop, literally snatching the sunglasses off his face, because, Ai Weiwei doesnt care. The film becomes a witness to the government paranoia over one man who doesnt care what they think and doesnt care what they might do to him. He his fearless, waving at the police staked outside his home. Putting art up for the cameras trained on his studio. The Party can not make him bow to them.

 Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry is a modern account of the power of art. If someone says that a work of art has no power and an artist can change nothing, you could hand them this film. While Ai Weiwei is at the center of this, he never claims it is about him. He insists he could do nothing if it were not for the young Chinese he inspires to help him. Many of his art campaigns involve the internet and get a massive response from Chinese all over the country. They all know something is wrong, that things aren't playing out as planned and Ai Weiwei is one of their loudest mouth pieces.

 The year is 2014 and things have gone wrong. I want people to become aware individuals like Ai Weiwei, because I want us to learn from them. We can all stop living in fear and fight to change what is destroying us. What is keeping us held back. What is taking away our rights. What is poisoning our children. We are human first and foremost. So, what affects one corner of the world will affect another. The lines of difference we use to categorize each are just in out minds, but they are keeping freedom and equality at bay. We don't have to live under the boot heel of whatever system is in place in our block of the globe. We can, like Ai Weiwei, stand up with our middle fingers and say we are and never will be sorry for doing so.",1388793600,,4709,4.601907032181168
5135380,4,B0087ITBFC,"Very interesting documentary Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry follows the activities of Chinese artist and activist Ai Weiwei. But you may say, Who is Ai Weiwei? Well, you don't have to know that. You don't have to know anything about art or postmodernism.

This is a comprehensive documentary covering the recent activities of this politically outspoken person, who has been rebelling against the system in his own unique way. One of his most notable activities is the Sichuan Earthquake Names Project, a blog recording the names of more than 5,000 children killed in the earthquake in 2008, a devastating fact that the government wants to conceal.

As you expect, a considerable portion of the documentary is about a series of clashes between Ai Weiwei and the Chinese authorities, which culminated in his eighty-one day detention and subsequent house arrest. The documentary closely chronicles Ai Weiwei and his supporters activities and their run-ins with the Chinese local and central governments, which sometimes result in darkly funny moments like a police officer videotaping Ai Weiwei in the street, with Ai Weiweis cameraman filming the man just beside him.

First-time director Alison Klayman makes the best use of the chance given to her to film the artist up close. While her approach allows for the authentic portrait of the man, the film takes it for granted that viewers have already known some of the social and historical background, like, What happened to writers like Ai Weiweis father, a renowned poet Ai Qing, during the Cultural Revolution? or Why so many buildings collapsed when the earthquake hit?

Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry is not an in-depth study of the artists works, or incisive commentary about the modern Chinese society. You must keep in mind that Ai Weiweis fight has just started and is not likely to be over soon. This is a well-made documentary with a few inspiring moments, but we still need a more definite version of the real-life story that is still going on.",1388016000,,1988,5.015151515151516

Art can be an act that can be feared by governments that do not represent to actual needs and desires of their people.",1387497600,,450,4.6835443037974684

5135399,3,B0087ITBFC,"I had read reviews of top documentaries for 2012, and this film was in many of those lists.  Not really seeing why I would want to see this, I eventually ended up seeing a preview of the film and I was definitely hooked.

The film's editing I would say is good and kept a nice pace. I like the fact that the man himself uses his time, talent, and treasure to try to uplift his people but I wouldn't say there was anything riveting about it.

Kinda feels like a mix between Exit Through The Gift Shop (with Mr. Brainwash), and Berkley in the 60's and/or The Black Power Mixtape.  I wish there were probably less themes in his life being explored but deeper exploration of those.

Not a waste of money but I've seen better.",1366070400,,721,4.272058823529412

The artist does not settle on the results of daunting questions such as how many children die in the earthquake or is it okay to cause injury to me, his actions seeks out the answers.

8526016,5,B0087ITBFC,"He helped design the evocative, iconoclastic Bird's Nest stadium for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, a work that finally put Ai Weiwei on the map as an international artist. Yet as the Games approached, the Chinese artist-dissident mounted a campaign to boycott the Olympics, calling them hypocritical government propaganda.

""I'm not for the kind of Olympics that . . . tells the ordinary citizens they should not participate,"" Ai Weiwei says in Philadelphia journalist Alison Klayman's documentary, Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry.

A remarkable, joyous piece of filmmaking, Klayman's feature debut is an intimate, revelatory portrait of an artist whose work unmasks the institutionalized hypocrisy at the heart of China's regime. It's likely to change the way you think about art and politics and the state of China today.

Ai Weiwei's stunning proclamation in 2008 positioned him as one of the most outspoken and well-known dissidents in China and in the next three years he continued to turn up the volume. (In 2011, ArtReview named Ai the most powerful man in art. )

""Typical Chinese critics [of the government] are mild,"" a Chinese art curator says in Klayman's film. ""They don't directly criticize the Communist Party or the government. But Ai Weiwei is different. He uses the most aggressive words to point out society's dark side.""

Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry opens a rare, intimate window into his daily life in Beijing - we see him eat dinner with his wife, Lu Qing; discuss his years as an art student in New York; marvel at how one of his 40 cats has learned to manipulate door handles; and fly off to Munich and London for art shows. Klayman skillfully intercuts this footage with news articles, clips from other interviews with Ai Weiwei, and excerpts from the more than a dozen documentary films made by the artist himself.

There are always multiple cameras present in the film - including the ever-present police cameras that keep tabs on Ai Weiwei's movements.

He makes the authorities nervous: In one scene, he has a meal with his fans at an outdoor restaurant. By its very nature, the gathering becomes an act of sedition.

Ai Weiwei comes off as a man on a singular mission: to record the life around him before it is erased or distorted by a repressive government terrified by the smallest sign of nonconformity. His primary weapons: video cameras and Twitter.

Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry has a very definite, strong story arc that begins with the devastating Sichuan earthquake in May 2008 that killed more than 68,000 people. Ai Weiwei investigates how thousands of children died needlessly because they were inside shoddy government-built schools. Yet he can't even get an answer to his most basic question - the student death toll. We hear a government official tell him that information is an official secret.

Ai Weiwei's visits to the disaster site take an ominous turn when cops beat him up in his hotel room, causing a brain hemorrhage. Uncowed, he files lawsuit after lawsuit against the police. (They lead nowhere.)

Asked at one point to describe his artistic approach, Ai Weiwei says, ""I consider myself more of a chess player. My opponent makes a move, I make a move.""

The government's move comes in April 2011, when Ai Weiwei is made to disappear. Eighty-one days later, he's driven back to his Beijing house a broken man.

On probation for a year and charged with tax evasion, he tells journalists that under terms of his probation he's not allowed to say a word. He won't even speak with Klayman off camera.

Ai Weiwei's probation was lifted in June, but he has yet to turn up the volume again. Perhaps he no longer can.",1474588800,,3649,4.8739903069466886

Weiwei used social media as an instrument of defiance when he started to investigate the deaths of schoolchildren in an earthquake, because the school was built ineptly, but the government did not want any kind of criticism. The documentary shifts back and forth between him making art and him being a gadfly to the Communist state. If you are not interested in art and artists, or, if you are not interested in political repression, then this film is not for you. Otherwise, it is very good.",1461715200,,632,4.91588785046729
