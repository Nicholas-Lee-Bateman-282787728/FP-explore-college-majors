6433784,5,B00KMJBI7I,I absolutely love Fatal Instinct.  I am into satire and Fatal Instinct covers it.  Armand Assante is clueless and hilarious,1396483200,,123,5.1
6433785,4,B00KMJBI7I,"Kevin Klein is a funny character in The January Man. Superb Actor!
Fatal Instinct is a hilarious and sharp-witted pun based on the original, more serious movie.
Pay close attention.  Both movies and the price were good for the combo pack--thanks Amazon!",1381795200,,253,5.023809523809524

6433790,5,B00KMJBI7I,"In perfect shape and on time. Love The January Man.  Fatal Instinct is a parody of murder movies and for the first few minutes there are some cute gags, but it gets boring and stupid in a big hurry.",1438041600,,198,4.076923076923077
6433791,5,B00KMJBI7I,January Man has been knocked by critics.  I found it to be funny and exciting.  Went into my large collection.,1437523200,,110,4.45
6433792,5,B00KMJBI7I,"""January Man"" is an excellent piece of work, with a superb cast and excellent performances. It is both entertaining and heartwarming. If I had several appendages, I'd give this film 8 thumbs up!
""Fatal Instinct"" has its humorous moments, but is so-so at best. However, ""January Man"" makes this item well worth the price!",1428969600,,320,4.944444444444445

8660081,5,B00KMJBI7I,"I purchased this for ""Fatal Instinct,"" which is one hilarious movie that pokes fun at other serious suspense movies out around or before the time (like ""Basic Instinct,"" ""Sleeping With the Enemy"" and ""Fatal Attraction""). I'd forgotten just how funny it was and it is great to see a serious actor like Armand Assante out of character, loosening up in his role.
I found ""January Man"" somewhat entertaining but not as much a comedy. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is a joy to watch and fans of the late Alan Rickman will not be disappointed with his role in it.",1528156800,,555,4.673469387755102
