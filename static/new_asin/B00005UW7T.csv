1668596,5,B00005UW7T,"Three of the most seen teenager movies of the early sixties in Europe with Cliff Richard and the Shadows. I think it's a must for all those ""old"" teenagers who will never grow up.",1017446400,4,179,4.294117647058823
1668597,5,B00005UW7T,"I've not seen these on DVD yet, as they haven't been released, but I have seen the movies before. I'm giving it a 5 Star rating mainly because I can soon buy and enjoy these long sought after films!
For those of you who enjoy Cliff Richard music and his old movies, this will be a great acquisition for you!  Many of his early 60s hits appear in the movies along with some other great songs.  Not all the songs are great, but there is enough enjoyable music to please most everyone.  I'd equate these movies with the Elvis movies and other teen idol movies from that time.  They're not academy award material, but they sure are fun to watch and reminesce to -and better than most of the films from that genre.  Hopefully the picture and sound quality will be good. The release of these films on DVD will be a great prize for Cliff's many fans here in the USA and for [a great price] for the three, this is a real bargain!  For anyone who's a Cliff fan or who enjoys early 60s music from that era, buy this set!!!  ...and for anyone who doesn't know of Sir Cliff Richard, you've been missing out on one of England's great treasures!",1016582400,13,1131,4.28169014084507
1668598,1,B00005UW7T,what dvd is this? A collection of songs by Cliff Richard in 3 discs or just three of his old movies in three discs. How to reveiw this title.,1013990400,,141,3.896551724137931
1668616,5,B00005UW7T,"I was very happy to see this item on Amazon. I had watched all these movies as a child growing up in the UK and wanted my kids to see them. They were in great condition and the movies ran without any problems.

I am very happy with this purchase",1168473600,,245,3.9

1668618,5,B00005UW7T,"As handsome as his marionette Cliff Richard Jr. in the 60's british movie Thunderbirds Are Go, Sir Cliff Richard shows as the brightest star in the universe through three delightful movies. I was just glad to have found the collection after listening to Richard's songs on karaoke. My favorite is Summer Holiday, but I recommend watching it last out of the three movies. They are all brimming with laughs, love, and heart melting vocals. You're in for a real treat!",1083110400,4,465,4.825
1668619,5,B00005UW7T,"This amazing box-set comprises of the three musicals Cliff Richard made in the 1960's.  ""The Young Ones"", ""Summer Holiday"" and the vastly-overlooked ""Wonderful Life"" which is only available exclusively in this box set.
THE YOUNG ONES was the top British box-office attraction of 1961, and still my favorite of all the Cliff Richard films.  In the film, Cliff plays Nicky Black, the handsome son of a wealthy businessman (Robert Morley) whose talents lie in performing and not business like his stuffy father.  When the local youth-club is to be torn down, Nicky, his girlfriend Toni (Carole Gray) and their friends decide to stage a benefit show, with Nicky as the ""Mystery Singer"".
Top stuff. Carole Gray is showcased in several splashy numbers including her song ""No One But Nicky"".  Gray was one of the top West End stars of the day and had made acclaimed performances in ""West Side Story"" as well as ""The Boy Friend"".
SUMMER HOLIDAY was the follow-up to mega-hit THE YOUNG ONES, and features fine performances from Melvyn Hayes and Una Stubbs, with Broadway's Lauri Peters, fresh from her run as Liesl in ""Sound of Music"", as Richard's love interest Barbara Winters.
In the film Richard and his car-mechanic mates decide to drive a cumbersome double-decker bus from London to Athens for a vacation.  Along the way they indulge in some rather amusing escapades.
WONDERFUL LIFE was lushly filmed on location in the Canary Islands, with Melvyn Hayes and Una Stubbs again co-starring.  This time, a young Susan Hampshire (""Monarch of the Glen"") is wooed by Richard.  This film features many overly-designed dance numbers, and Richard is at his vocal best.
The transfers for all three films are remarkably-clean and free of dirt and scratches.  The colors are fully-saturated and the 2-channel stereo sound serves its purpose.  All three films are in their correct aspect ratio (2:35:1)
On the whole, to have all three films available in this box-set is superb.  THE YOUNG ONES and SUMMER HOLIDAY are also available individually.",1046476800,19,2028,5.026865671641791
1668620,5,B00005UW7T,"Since Britain's VCRs ran on a different format than America's, we on this side of the pond missed the British teen musicals when they came out on video, even though they preceeded the stateside Beach Party Bingos. The Young Ones is nothing short of great, and this set has the added bonus of introducing two more musicals. Cliff's got an easy, unaffected style like Ricky Nelson, while the Shadows seem to preshadow the Monkees.
The Young Ones invents music video, with antics predating the Beatles' Help. It takes place in the Carnaby Street environs currently popularized in Austin Powers. It influenced American beach movies and inspired the East Berlin teen musical, ""The Loveable Mouse."" Summer Holiday makes reference to the Mods and Rockers and the conflict that would explode the next year, so graphically portrayed in the Who's Quadrophenia. These films help fill in for us stateside bits of British culture with which we are only slightly familiar. That said, The Young Ones is enormously entertaining, with the sort of innocent 'sixties appeal of the original Bye Bye Birdie--another teen musical about a maverick musician.
I'm glad Cliff's albums are being rereleased on CD, because apart from the few that came out on Elton John's Rocket label, his records were generally not available here. I don't know how many films he did, but I hope they all find their way on to DVD as well. I find Cliff's musicals more enjoyable to watch than either Elvis Presley's films or the teen beach movies. It seems surprising that they were never widely shown in the US, but I am delighted to have found the DVD set of The Cliff Richard Collection.",1035158400,4,1645,4.878571428571429
1668621,5,B00005UW7T,"I left the UK for the shores of the USA almost four years ago. The night before I left England I watched both The Young Ones and Summer Holiday in the fear that I would never see these wonderful movies again. You can imagine how delighted I was to find them here, at Amazon, bundled up in this fabulous collection of Cliff movies, and in a format that will play here in the USA - universal DVDs. Now I can relive all my childhood memories again.",1033171200,,445,4.186046511627907
1668622,5,B00005UW7T,"I should start by saying that I gave this set 5 stars because Anchor Bay has done a wonderful job of presenting these 40-year old films in their original wide-screen, colourful glory--and also because I never-ever-thought that I would see them released in North America. I have been a fan of Cliff's since the 50s, but--let's face it--his success in the U.S. has only been sporadic. So having his three best musicals on DVD is a real treat for people like me !

""The Young Ones"" ( aka ""Wonderful to be Young"" in the U.S. )was not Cliff's first film, but it was his first as a star. Overall, I would give it 4 1/2 stars, because it is still a lot of fun, and when it was released, was probably the best musical made in the UK to that point.
The plot is old and familiar--to save their clubhouse from a greedy developer, Cliff and his friends decide to ""put on a show""--it helps that the group includes pro dancers like Carole Gray and Teddy Green, amusing comedians like Melvyn Hayes and Richard O'Sullivan, musicians like the Shadows and , of course, Cliff to handle the singing. The ""greedy developer""--who also happens to be Cliff's ""father"" in the plot--is played by Robert Morley, who steals every scene he is in. I took away half a star only because there is a certain lack of chemistry between Cliff and Carole Gray, his leading lady, and also because when the Shadows ( in their original line-up ) have their big number at the end of the film--""The Savage""--it is truncated--a real shame, since they were the biggest, most exciting group in British music before the Beatles.
Thanks to the magic of DVD, you can also play ""The Young Ones"" while listening to the comments of its director, Sidney J. Furie. I found his comments fascinating--he not only talks about the film, but his own early days in the movie business and what it was like filming in the UK in the early 60s.

""Summer Holiday"" was the second film in this Cliff Richard musical trilogy and, for me at least, it is the best--magical fun from start to finish. When Cliff appears after the opening credits, black and white turns to colour, and this fun movie gets rolling--actually ""rolling"" on the wheels of a bright red, double-decker London bus ( ""London Transport said OK"" ) that Cliff and his pals take to France, across Europe and ultimately Greece.

There are many reasons why this movie works so well. There is a great cast of young, supporting players who match Cliff's enthusiasm, and Lauri Peters is a lovely leading lady. The dance numbers are expertly done--Cliff may not be Gene Kelly
( who is ? ) but he acquits himself very well, and watch out for one of his mates played by Teddy Green, a real pro. Comic sequences are very amusing. On-location European scenery is a big plus--Cliff singing ""The Next Time"" with the Acropolis behind him leaves a lasting impression. The soundtrack is quite simply Cliff's best. ""Summer Holiday"", ""Bachelor Boy"", ""Dancing Shoes"", great production numbers and three excellent instrumentals by the legendary Shadows add up to super entertainment.

Sir Cliff was about 22 when this was filmed--he looks great, sounds great and has charm and charisma to spare. If there is one film that will explain why he has had such a long career, and remains so popular all over the globe, it is ""Summer Holiday"".

The ""Summer Holiday"" DVD is particularly gorgeous--lovely colour, excellent detail. You can also watch the film while listening to the comments of director, Peter Yates. Mr. Yates has terrific ""recall"" and his comments are a fascinating bonus for fans.

The last of the ""trilogy"" is ""Wonderful Life""--aka in the U.S. as ""Swingers' Paradise"". I would give this movie 3 1/2 stars, mainly based on Cliff's charisma, the charm of leading lady, Susan Hampshire, a clever sequence in the middle of the film depicting the history of movies, and the beautiful Canary Islands scenery.

This film is a ""must"" only for Cliff diehards, because it certainly has some problems. The most glaring problem is the plot. While light-hearted musicals are not expected to be ""Citizen Kane"", the plot for ""Wonderful Life"" is anything but ""wonderful"". The dialogue is very lame--where ""The Young Ones"" and ""Summer Holiday"" had many amusing sequences, the comedy here--even with Melvyn Hayes and Richard O'Sullivan again on board--seems forced and flat.
The Shadows are given much bigger roles in this film--even dialogue--but there is no attempt to give them any sort of personality. Walter Slezak, as the megalomaniac movie director, has none of the humour or charm that Robert Morley displayed as the lovable ""villain"" in ""The Young Ones"". Derek Bond, a popular British actor in the 40s and 50s, is wasted in an embarrassing role as a cowardly movie star.
The soundtrack has a couple of good numbers, but doesn't remotely compare to that of ""Summer Holiday"".

With all these problems, the film had the misfortune to be released around the same time as ""A Hard Day's Night""--suddenly ""old fashioned musicals"" seemed to be just that--""old fashioned"".

One more point--where Sidney J. Furie's comments on ""The Young Ones"" were very interesting, his first statement about ""Wonderful Life"" is that he has no recollection of the film whatsoever ! This does not stop him from chatting about other films he made, including ""Lady Sings the Blues"" where he gushes about the thrill of working with Diana Ross ! Sorry Sidney--if you don't have any real memories of ""Wonderful Life"", why bother ?

Overall this boxed-set is a fitting testament to a star who continues today--he's now a 62-year old ""Young One""--to please his fans all over the world. Again, a big ""thank you"" to Anchor Bay. For Cliff's many fans, this collection is absolutely indispensible !",1031875200,20,5740,4.81237322515213

1668624,5,B00005UW7T,"Cliff Richard went virtually unnoticed in the US in his 1960s heyday, but the films he made were more energetic and sincere than all but a few made by Elvis. ""Summer Holiday"" is a bit thin on plot but a colorful, tuneful treat. ""The Young Ones"" presents a gritty-but-clean look at the UK club scene circa 1960. It's a hoot. ""Wonderful Life"" is the lesser of the three films, but still enjoyable -- and unavailable outside of this boxed set. Finally, this set comes in at the price of two of the DVDs bought separately. Nice!",1022889600,5,524,4.46875

7955427,5,B00005UW7T,"Well, I'm no longer one of the ""Young Ones"", but I was when the movie ""Wonderful To Be Young"" played in Cincinnati. I liked the movie, and loved the music. I played the record until it could no longer be played. I liked ""The Young Ones"" the best, followed by ""Summer Holiday"", and then ""Wonderful Life"" but would not give up any of them. My daughter came to me when she was a teenager wanting me to see this new singer that was on TV by the name of Cliff Richard, she really liked him. I showed her the record cover, and told her that he was as good then as he was when I was a teenager.",1223510400,,587,3.983050847457627

7955429,5,B00005UW7T,"As a teenager in the Philippines, I saw the movies when they were first released, and Cliff Richard was the singing idol then.  Getting hold of them through Amazon thrills me to pieces.  This may not qualify as a review because I'm totally biased.  I simply say that this DVD set is absolutely delightful.  I'll never get tired of watching Cliff.",1202083200,,346,4.622950819672131
7955430,5,B00005UW7T,"In my teens, I missed watching The Young Ones and Summer Holiday because I was an Honor Student and refrain from watching too much movies, so now that I have been given the opportunity to have this collection, I appreciate it so much. I brought it to my sisters' house and watched all three movies on their big screen and everybody enjoyed them. The songs, the dances, the story line. Cliff may not be an actor worth receiving awards for his acting, but I think he is a natural. He just acts like normal teenagers would in his time, and his singing is superb and his dancing doesn't get behind all those dancers that were with him in the films. I wish I could get hold of 'Finders Keepers' too.",1198972800,,694,4.346153846153846
7955431,3,B00005UW7T,"Looking at all the other reviews, I'm certainly in the minority when I say this collection of Cliff Richard movies doesn't hold up well today. The very essence of a good musical is good songs and I mean GOOD, MEMORABLE and ICONIC songs!  In this case it was the title songs themselves, these were the big hits not to mention the big hit instrumentals from THE SHADOWS.  Unfortunately, the movies were designed to highlight Cliff and not the greatest guitar group of them all.  Now thats purely subjective on my part, but looking at THE YOUNG ONES, SUMMER HOLIDAY and WONDERFUL LIFE on a cinematic basis, they are as the main reviewer points out, just British versions of old MGM B-musicals. And when the Beatles came along in 1964 with A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, that old wornout musical formula was totally blown away.

At the time when I was a kid, I actually went to see all three movies at the ABC cinema in my London neighborhood. ABC even produced them at their own studio. They were BIG hits and Cliff Richard was the biggest singer on the British pop charts. But all that was before pop groups REALLY started to take off both in Britain and the US. Unlike Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley, Cliff's acting skills and charisma were not so electrifying. However again, if you're a long time dedicated Cliff Richard fan, anything he does is great. For me, THE SHADOWS should have been in the spotlight more!

Looking back at the time in which they were made in the early 1960's, they were all-so innocent and naive to what was going on in the REAL world. The Cuban missile crisis, the Profumo sex scandal that brought down the British government, the JFK assasination and so on. What a contrast, but then movies are mostly made to be escapist entertainment. With that in mind, this collection is a good value moneywise at least. And like a lot of things that seemed so good when you were young, well you know what I mean...",1192924800,,1919,4.534682080924855
7955432,5,B00005UW7T,"I bought this collection because I'm a big Cliff Richard fan, and these musicals are a lot of fun.  I was expecting an OK picture transfer onto DVD, because these are pretty old and I figured no one would really care.

What a pleasant surprise!

I had just bought a new HD-DVD player, and even though these aren't in HD, the picture quality is just stunning.  All three are fine transfers, with good sound too.

Like the other comments say, ""Summer Holiday"" is the best of the lot, but all three are good nostalgic fun.

If you like 1960's era musicals, you can't go wrong with this set.",1175731200,,587,4.388888888888889
