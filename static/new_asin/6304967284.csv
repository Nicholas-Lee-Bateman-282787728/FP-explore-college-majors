942936,5,6304967284,"Mr. Orlando has accomplished a rare feat. The ease with which this video relays the deep and hidden inner art of real and effective fighting methods is astounding. Secrets of the arts not taught in the everyday dojo are uncovered with amazing ease and confidence. The deadliest of techniques -- impaling, leg trapping, multiple points of contact -- you name it, it's here. Traditional practitioners -- look behind the curtain and see your kata/form movements come alive. Many black belts that have trained for a lifetime are not this effective and do not have this knowledge.
Bob Orlando is an excellent speaker, informative, and has the ability to demonstrate and break down complicated movements that even a novice will be able to understand. If you're a serious martial artist that isn't afraid of what you don't know, you simply HAVE to buy this tape!!!",1017705600,,857,4.958333333333333
942937,5,6304967284,"I watched this video 3 times in the course of a couple of days. It is, hands down, the best video of its kind I've seen. Guru Bob Orlando distills the fighting arts of silat and kuntao into a handful of principles from which unlimited techniques may be generated. The communication is masterful, the material incredibly well-organized. Mr. Orlando is a superb teacher. You can and will learn from this video and be able to incorporate the principles into your own art, regardless of the art that you practice. I cannot say enough about this video and the companion publication, ""Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals."" Buy them and learn.",978480000,,633,4.925233644859813
942938,5,6304967284,"I practice & teach Kenpo in Arkansas. In this video, Mr. Orlando shares principles & concepts that would be very beneficial to you, regardless of the style of martial art you practice. I have heard great things about his teaching ability, but now that I have seen his work on video, I am a definite believer. If fact, I am currently making arrangements to travel to Colorado to train with Mr. Orlando in person. Thank you, Mr. Orlando, for pouring your knowledge into these great learning tools & making them available to everyone.",970012800,,531,4.720430107526882
942939,5,6304967284,"We study Maphilindo and Mande Muda Silat at our school and I've been looking for books and videos on the subject to supplement what we cover in class. After reading Bob Orlando's excellent book, Indonesian Fighting Fundamentals, I decided to purchase his video. It just arrived today and I've watched it twice already.
Instead of focusing on the specifics of the techniques, he uses the techniqes as teaching tools to demonstrate the underlying principles behind them. He also shows several partner drills one can practice to help put it all together.
All in all, an excellent video.",958953600,,583,5.020618556701031

7879972,4,6304967284,alas someone finnaly did a dvd on principles and concepts instead of a bunch methods to deal with specific attacks the material is clearly explained sometimes using analogys with humor .and letting the student know that in understanding the all important concepts they can be free to devise an almost endless arsenal of effective responses to unorthodox attacks .you find yourself graffting the principles onto your existing art making it more brutal .this dvd is worth its weight in gold keep up the good work mr. orlando,1413676800,,522,5.011494252873563

7879974,5,6304967284,"I've been wanting to purchase this DVD for a long time, however I am based outside the US (in Africa) and the shipping options available to get it to where I stay were standard mail. I always select the fastest delivery from Amazon since that uses either UPS or DHL for international delivery, which is fast - 3 days - and much safer than standard mail. Unfortunately purchasing via Bice books doesn't give me this option.
So, what did I do?
I traveled to the US (Maryland) for a 'business trip' and ordered the DVD.
That either says I am crazy, or that the DVD is worth it.
I might be crazy, but the DVD is definitely worth it.",1361318400,2,628,4.285714285714286
7879975,5,6304967284,"Professor Orlando's DVD is superb. The way he presents his teachings is very clear, practical and with a little humor. As he says, you need to have fun when working on something serious. Techniques are solid and easy to learn when dedication is applied. You can add these as additional tools to your practice. I have bought other DVD sets recorded by professor Orlando and my plan is to get them all for my DVD library. Great resource!",1345507200,,435,4.589743589743589

7879977,5,6304967284,"This is one of my favorite Silat training videos today. Even though it is already over 10 years old, I still watch it time and again as Bob's method of teacking appeals to me greatly and his attention to detail is truly spectacular. Just to add, you'll want to search for his other 3 videos as they expand upon what was said here. Overall, Bob Orlando's videos represent the standard for what all martial arts training videos should be. The only negative I can give is that Bob doesn't have anymore videos for me to buy!!!",1267747200,2,522,4.447916666666667
7879978,5,6304967284,"Thank Your Mr. Orlando,

  I've been studying Silat for about six years with some of the best in the Martial Arts.  This video was a great supplement to my training.  Given my geographic disposition which makes it hard to train with the people I would like to all the time.  This is a great way to help fill in the blanks.  I hope to some time in the near future to train in person with Mr. Orlando.  Thank You!!!

7879979,5,6304967284,"This is a must have, for any one in the arts. I have gained so much understanding, as well as my (training partners) in the principles of the Indo Arts because of this book. Mr. Orlando is clear and to the point. He is one of the best that I have ever seen on video or read in type.
