7413652,5,B014IAWFKU,"As a fan of the MGM musicals, it's a pleasure to see TCM and Warner Brothers team up and release this DVD set spotlighting the talented Eleanor Powell in an affordable DVD set. Granted all previous films have been released already on DVD in separate box sets it's a treat to have all of Powell's Broadway Melody films together. Oftentimes Eleanor Powell is often overshadowed by other dancing legends including Astaire and Kelly but in the 1930s Ms. Powell was the dancing queen of the MGM lot. As for the films there isn't much plot wise but the numbers are entertaining and have that grand MGM style. Included in the set are:

Broadway Melody of 1936 starring Powell with Robert Taylor and Jack Benny. Many of the songs in this film went on to be featured in Singin' in the Rain years later. One interesting number actually has Robert Taylor singing.

Born to Dance features Powell and James Stewart who also tries singing in this Cole Porter musical. This is my personal favorite out all four films. I think the ""Swingin' the Jinx Away"" number is one of the best numbers ever filmed in a MGM musical.

Broadway Melody of 1938 teaming Powell again with Robert Taylor and Judy Garland in a supporting role. Personally I think this is the weakest film in the set but still very enjoyable. Seeing a young Judy Garland sing Dear Mr. Gable is one of the highlights of the film.

Broadway Melody of 1940 is last film in the set. The film features Powell and Fred Astaire and includes the famous ""Begin the Beguine"" number, arguably one of the best numbers from a MGM musical and rightly so.

If you're a fan of Hollywood musicals from the Golden Age of Musicals definitely pick up this set and enjoy the music and dancing!",1447113600,21,1718,4.564935064935065

And one of the films shows Powell dancing with George Murphy, an all-time favorite and could dance along with the best of them.  When Powell retired, Cyd Charisse stepped up to belong with these Hall-of-Famers.  Enjoy!",1485734400,,350,5.196428571428571

7413666,5,B014IAWFKU,"I don't know much about tap dancing but watching Eleanor Powell is pure pleasure.  She just has such a lovely smile and she oozes niceness. And what she does looks like great tap dancing. I watched her through these four good but not great films and she just made me feel great. And the last dance with Fred Astaire in ""Broadway Melody of 1940"" to ""Begin The Beguine"" still has me awed and smiling.  I watched it four times.",1477526400,7,424,4.3544303797468356

7413679,3,B014IAWFKU,"This is a good collection of old MGM musicals with Eleanor Powell. In these films she dances to the rhythms of Herb Nacio Brown and Arthur Freed, and Cole Porter. In BM of 1936, Eleanor Powell makes her debut in the movies and shows she is the queen of tap dancing right away. I enjoy watching her dance You are my Lucky Star in a dream sequence, Sing Before Breakfast, and Broadway Rhythm. She's quite wonderful tap dancing as a French performer. The BM of 38 features Powell dancing along George Murphy and once more with Buddy Ebsen Follow in my Footsteps, Feeling Like a Million, Your Broadway and My Broadway, Broadway Rhythm, and  Get a Pair of New Shoes. Although this film doesn't show a lot of Powell tap-dance numbers, it offers a special treat by presenting Judy Garland in her first performances singing Everybody Sing and the famous Clark Gable song, You Made Me Love You. Finally, the BM of 1940, you may watch the King of tap dancing, Fred Astaire, dance with Eleanor Powell on three occasions to the tunes of Cole Porter songs: Juke Box Dance, I Concentrate on You, and Begin the Beguine. This film is famous because of the pairing of Astaire with Powell. Then there is Born to Dance, where she shares a leading role with Jimmy Stewart.

I wish there were a second collection of other MGM films she made just to watch Powell dance.",1456012800,16,1347,4.539094650205762

7413682,5,B014IAWFKU,"She outdances them all!  I agree with most of the comments of previous reviews except her being overshadowed by other dancers such as Astaire.  If you really watch Begin the Beguine, she dances more effortlessly and is much more at ease than Astaire - who tends to look at his feet sometimes.

8730853,5,B014IAWFKU,"Of course the reason to buy this set is the great Eleanor Powell.  Most of her dance numbers are solos, because there were not that many men who could hold their own with her.  Only one dancer could match her--the equally great Fred Astaire. Their duet  in ""1940"" is a classic.

Other reasons to buy this set...a very young Buddy Ebson (and his sister!) reminding us that he was a dancer, before becoming a very rich Hillbilly from Beverly Hills.  A pre-'Wizard of Oz"" Judy Garland singing ""Dear Mr. Gable"".  Sophie Tucker belting out ""One of these Days""

But the surprising stand out is the ""snoring"" man in ""1936"".  He also appears as a sneezing man in ""1938""  The first time he appears, it's ""cute"".  The second time he appears it's ""annoying!""  But the last time he appears, he is so hysterical that I was laughing out loud and rolling on the floor. However, it soon became obvious that sneezing is no where near as funny as snoring!!!!!

I can just hear the conversation with Louis B Mayer:
""I just saw this really funny guy!""
(Mayer)  So, What does he do?
""He gives a lecture on the different types of SNORES!!!""

Just what do you do with a talent like that???!!!!!
Leave it to MGM to actually figure that out.",1511913600,,1216,4.468181818181818

8730858,4,B014IAWFKU,"There was a day when I would not be caught dead watching an M-G-M musical.  But a funny thing happened on the way to my first Social Security check.  About a year ago my wife and I purchased the ""TCM Classic Films: Legends--Fred Astaire Collection"".  We positively loved each and every one of those films and were left wanting for more.  Since then we have purchased a few more of these collections and are very glad we did.  The most recent addition to our collection of classic films is TCM's marvelous 2015 release ""TCM Classic Films: Legends--Eleanor Powell Collection"".  While a couple of these titles did not quite measure up to the other two we really did enjoy viewing each and every one of these four films.

If I had to rank these four movies I think my favorite by a nose would be ""Broadway Melody of 1936"".  It was the first time we saw Eleanor Powell in a feature length film and we became instant fans.  In addition to all of the fabulous singing and dancing the film also had a terrific story line.  Robert Taylor was great in the role of Robert Gordon and it was a revelation to see a very young Buddy Ebsen and his sister Vilma perform. In addition Jack Benny does a terrific job as newspaper reporter Bert Keeler.  I would definitely give this film the full five stars.

I would say much the same about ""Broadway Melody of 1940"".  Fred Astaire is simply outstanding as Johnny Brett while George Murphy and Frank Morgan turn in stellar performances as well.  The music of Cole Porter was simply wonderful and the closing dance number featuring Astaire and Eleanor Powell is one of the most memorable in the history of film.

Now the other two films in this collection leave a bit to be desired.  Both ""Born To Dance"" and ""Broadway Melody of 1938"" have very weak story lines  and pale in comparison to the other two.  But having said that each of these films do have their moments and were fun to watch in spite of their shortcomings.  I would assign three and a half stars to ""Born To Dance"" and three stars to ""Broadway Melody of 1938.

As usual the folks at TCM have cobbled together a very enjoyable package featuring some terrific special features.  We especially enjoyed the
M-G-M ""Happy Harmonies"" cartoons.  All in all I believe that ""TCM Classic Films: Legends--Eleanor Powell Collection"" would certainly be a welcome addition to any library of classic American movies.  Recommended!",1499990400,2,2408,4.614117647058824
