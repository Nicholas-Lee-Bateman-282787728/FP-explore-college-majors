7912730,5,B00000JN2Q,"The successful shoot and location accomodations put forward by the New Mexico Film Commission for ""ELIMINATOR"" in 1989, were critical in building the momentum to turn that state into a viable alternative to Hollywood.  Beautiful scenery throughout this film.",1181520000,2,258,5.615384615384615

7912732,1,B00000JN2Q,"This wretchedly made film concerns a scientist in the field of weapons technology research who has accepted responsibility for developing an ""independent thinking"" aviatory robotic laser weapon and who, upon the device's test implementation, is torn, for the sake of humanity, with misgivings concerning his vocation. Burdened by disillusion with his government employers, also with his awareness of widespread knavery within the related defense industry, he believes that worse is yet to come if he continues with his researching and therefore, after the initial illustration of the weapon's efficacy, in a scene mindful of a Flash Gordon serial he obliterates his weapon by remote control. He becomes targeted by a dishonourable FBI agent and a group of recreant, non-sequital intelligence agents who are plotting to kidnap him and his daughter so that the scientist will reveal his core knowledge and, to prevent this, he hires two former Special Forces veterans, played by David Carradine and Frank Zagarino, as protection. A reckless attempt is made, through abduction, to obtain the coveted artificial intelligence technology, but the principals of each side are scenario stricken by incredibly moronic scenes and stupid dialogue, aggravated by limited direction, lacklustre acting and superfluous violence combining to produce a general lack of those production values indispensable for an interesting film, even one with bantamweight objectives as in this instance.",1121904000,,1473,5.63963963963964
