8239245,1,B0010X7446,"I'd read the other peoples reviews. I thought the ones who didn't like this film just missed the point of what it was all about. I mean, I LOVE the ""cyber-punk"" films. Rubbers Lover is so so delicious, Tetsuo the iron man, was one great image after another, and even Pinnochio 964 while not quite as good as the other two, still had enough of that special ""something"" to make it a favorite. I always wondered why Body Hammer never had that special, hyphenated slogan printed across the top of it's dvd case like the others. I figured by the time Tetsuo 2 had come out there were just too many cyber-punk titles out for this to be in the same group as the ""classics"".

  There was something fishy about this film, but i couldn't put my finger on it. All the arrows pointed to ""s**t sandwich"", but i couldn't seem to resist the urge to try it for myself and ignore all the others who tried to steer me clear of this absolutly terrible movie- Those people only ""think"" they know what makes a movie good, i thought. They're just like my sister/best friend/co-worker/pet dog who i lent Iron Man to and couldn't understand the brilliance of that incredible film. I thought Tetsuo The Iron Man was like ""a symphony on celluloid"". I thought because i could think of such a fancy group of words like ""a symphony on celluloid"" to describe the first Tetsuo, that there was no way i couldn't enjoy the second one. I thought that guy who said the music sounded like it was from some old 80's videogame was just some jerk who wasn't giving credit where credit was due...

  I decided that i had made the decision to buy the first Tetuo on my own- despite a few bad reviews and I'd be damned before i'd listen to some poopy-heads who didn't know a thing about what makes a movie great, stop me from purchasing enjoying this film.

  But if your like me, you made your mind up as soon as you found out there was a second Tetsuo, and no matter what anyone else said or wrote, you were going to have to see it for yourself... Well, go ahead and buy it, you're going to have to shell out some greenbacks if you want to see something as bad as this. You know it's kind of like that unfaithful girl who you asked out and thought would be faithful, just to find out she was cheating on you; only difference is, with this film it doesnt take so long to figure out everyone else was right.",1207008000,6,2365,4.296629213483146
