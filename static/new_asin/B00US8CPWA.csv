7070690,4,B00US8CPWA,"I got this set at a good price. I don't like the color episodes as well as the black and white ones, but there are some funny ones here. I don't have cable anymore, so it's good to have on hand. I was watching these on YouTube, but the commercials were annoying.
The complaint I have is the packaging was already broken and the discs don't stay in the case. Very irritating.",1477785600,3,374,4.208333333333333

8707975,5,B00US8CPWA,"I assume that this being the fifth season, that you now know what you have bought the previous seasons. Now you are ready for episodes 128 through 159. I also assume that you did not get your fix with just the first four seasons.

For those people who are buying the fifth season (1964-65), before viewing the first, the Andy Griffith Show is unique in a sense that it started out fun and had all the standard encounters and stories that most TV programs had but it never deteriorate or got so left field as to lose its appeal. Every show is entertaining and usually carries a message.

A lot of other programs spun off form the characters that played in this series. And you always think that Opie Taylor (Ronny Howard) is always young; don't look at that old dude that is now a producer of exceptional movies. Everyone knows that they issued Deputy Barney fife ""1960-1965"" (Don Knotts) one bullet that has seen a lot of action in his pocket. Too many people to name here.

This series will bring back old memories or can also create some new ones.",1524268800,,1049,4.453125

8707982,5,B00US8CPWA,"This is the last 30 episodes broadcast 1967-68. Some of the episodes are kinda crazy. There's the one where Aunt Bee flies planes. Opie appears to be the town wise man in several episodes, dispensing wisdom, sound advice and knowledge to Goober and others that is far beyond his years. He's 14 this season. Barney is in one episode where he is supposed to find a large house to host a meeting with the Russians. He makes use of the town mansion by walking in, despite Andy's protests, and calls his police station in Raleigh saying they can come as he found the perfect place. The elderly owner finds them and threatens to call the state police. The group eventually stays at the Taylor residence. The Russians are soon won over due to Aunt Bee's cooking.  Barney works at the Raleigh police station serving coffee.

There are two real touching episodes with Goober. In the first he meets an old buddy and tries to impress him and hide the fact that he works at a gas station. In another he goes on a Tinder date (OK, computerized blind date) with a lady psychologist who is touched by how well treated she was by someone like Goober (local hick).

There are new characters this season like Emmett the town fix it man played by Paul Hartman. Paul was a dancer the likes of Fred Astaire and Ray Bolger. He shows off his dancing in an episode where Howard throws a party and Helen is the only female and gets danced to near exhaustion by Goob and Howard.

Ken Berry plays Sam in the last few episodes and seamlessly fits into the group and ends the series singing on his porch with some Italians.  The next episode is a whole different series called Mayberry, R.F.D. (Rural Free Delivery).  Andy and Helen get married and go to Florida on a honeymoon with Barney Fife. The new theme music was frequently heard in season 8 of The Andy Griffith Show. This episode should have been included as a bonus, but there are no bonus features other than previews of other classic showsin the first disc. Each episode is over 25 minutes long.

One wishes that all three seasons of Mayberry R.F.D. were released as well since they continue the lives of all the characters including Andy who appears in several episodes. So far only the first season has come out on DVD.  After that show ended in 1971, Goober would be featured on Hee Haw. It wasn't till 1986 that the rest of the cast would be reunited.",1516233600,2,2388,4.486175115207374
