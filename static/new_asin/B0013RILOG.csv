3118901,4,B0013RILOG,"A delightful little piece that moves along well,  Animation is creative and quirky.  I will watch it again, in Spanish..",1374796800,,120,4.95
3118902,5,B0013RILOG,Saw it with my son at the New York International Children's Film Festival and was sooo excited to find it as a DVD ;),1372723200,,117,3.9166666666666665
3118903,5,B0013RILOG,"This is a beautiful film with great animation, acting, character/background design, and storyboarding. The perspective is fresh and interesting, and I had a good time watching it. I got it in Spanish because that was all I could find for my region, but this version comes with both Spanish and English Audio, so it really is the same.",1356998400,3,334,4.775862068965517
3118904,5,B0013RILOG,"An enchanting story about a young boy, being raised in an orphanage, who is afraid of the dark. Life is hard for little Tim, until he meets the ""Cat Shepherd"" and is sent off on a wild adventure into the mysterious and fascinating workings of the night. Watch it in the original Spanish, or my version has nicely done English dubbing as well. Subtitled in both English and Spanish. Great for any child over the age of 5 who is afraid of the dark or enjoys watching the stars. Enchanting for adults as well!",1354579200,,506,4.3936170212765955
3118905,4,B0013RILOG,"Nocturna is one of the most creatively designed and beautifully animated films I have seen in years. The look of this film is superior to some of the juggernauts, Disney in particular. The movement of the characters is beautifully captured and the world they live in is lushly detailed and lit. The attention to detail and light is on par with recent 3D Dreamworks films. It showcases many of the virtues of 2D animation, and is clearly a labour of love by its creators. Headless Productions is an excellent company, and if you peruse their production blog you'll see that they have a stock of brilliant ideas just waiting to be funded and realised.
I can't give it five stars though.
It's a beautiful looking film but it has a story that really needed tighter editing and direction to shine. The central conflict and its cause are not foreshadowed in a particularly effective way, which means that dramatic conclusion isn't as satisfying as it could be. There are a few too many characters and loose ends. The initial villain isn't intimidating, and while you expect the main character to fall from grace late in the story, he's given an immediate out. This is a kind message for children watching the film (it's ok when you make a mistake without meaning to) but it means that the end of the film meanders. It's not very satisfying. I consider it to be a good film to put the kids in front of but it won't necessarily capture their interest for long. It's value is that it shows just what this company could be capable of and what you can achieve with good art design and a stellar animation crew.
With some decent marketing it would've done very well but I don't think it got that. It's a gorgeous film though and I consider it a must for animation fans.",1328054400,22,1757,4.545741324921136
3118906,5,B0013RILOG,"I'm a little frustrated and very surprised that this film still haven't been released on DVD in the US, and is not known by many people.
It is a gorgeous, magical, engaging animation about the night-time adventure of a little boy. The stile used in the animation is very unique, very European. The story is original, adorable and educational/informational to children (I wouldn't recommend for very young kids, the villain -which is Fear itself, is a little scary). I love this animation, the cuteness happening in this film always warms my heart :)
By the way, the Soundtrack (which I believe is available on Amazon) is AMAZING! I listen to it all the time!",1317513600,8,658,4.780701754385965
3118907,5,B0013RILOG,"It is surprising to me that a film with the quality of Nocturna has not been released in America yet. Everything about this film is well thought out and executed to a T: the colors are vivid and beautiful, the story is well written and paced appropriately, and the characters are conceptually interesting and visually appealing. This film was a large motivating factor in my purchasing an all-region DVD player.

Amazing, truly amazing.",1275696000,22,436,4.972602739726027

3118909,5,B0013RILOG,"This creative, delightful movie has something for adults as well as children.  You'll learn why your hair is messy when you wake up, and where that lost sock goes.  The animation is original too.  Things get a little tense at times, but nothing small children won't ""get"" and appreciate.",1486252800,,287,4.816326530612245

3118911,5,B0013RILOG,"I had been searching for a really feelsy animated film after having seen The Secret of Kells 10x times. I enjoyed the art style and the story was very pleasant and easy to watch. If there's one motif that follows throughout cultures, it's that red-headed children are terribly mean.",1485820800,,282,4.775510204081633
3118912,4,B0013RILOG,"I had seen this movie listed and was waiting to watch it with my Amazon Prime account (meaning watch it free of charge).  I wasn't sure what the movie was about, but I love animation, so I decided to give it a shot.  The film is about a boy in an orphanage, who can't sleep at night unless he she his favorite star.  He is a bit of an insomniac.  One night he sees something he is not suppose to see.

He sees different characters doing their job i.e. rustling of leaves, scratches on window panes, creature that light the street lights..  He falls in with a cat herder..  Yes, a cat herder. Cats are assigned to make sure that the children go to sleep each night.  One night, his favorite star disappears and he has an adventure finding how and why to fix the problem.  Throughout the movie there are a lot of different characters, the afore mentioned cat herder, creatures that put the dew out at night, talking light filaments, plus a lot more.

I enjoyed the animation, nice and sharp and dubbed in English.  The film is a joint French and Spanish production and the lip-syncing is a little off at times, but it does not distract from the film.  Also, I thought that the movie ended rather abruptly, but on the whole, a rather enjoyable movie.  Definitely kid friendly!",1485734400,,1273,4.412017167381975

3118938,1,B0013RILOG,"This movie is a really poor imitation of some of the magical children's movies it appears to be looking to for inspiration (Studio Ghibli movies, The Song of the Sea and The Book of Kells).  The characters are annoying--inconsistent and unbelievable--while the plot feels forced and makes no sense.  I felt like I was watching a really weak piece of drama -- throughout the movie I remained hyper-aware of the fact that someone had actually written this ridiculous dialogue, trying to be deep or create tension, but doing it in such a heavy-handed way that it had no transporting effect.  Definitely skip this.",1478649600,,610,4.902912621359223

3118944,4,B0013RILOG,"I would give this film one more star, if not for the loose ends in the plot, which honestly could have been better. Still, this movie is a cinematic gem that deserves a ton of appreciation. First of all, it's a 2D production, that is so refreshing in a time of 3D movies. You can clearly tell that this was created by a group of people who love their craft and who pushed their talents to the Nth degree. What else can I say? The night never looked so enchanting and so dangerous at the same time.",1477267200,,497,4.134020618556701

3118947,5,B0013RILOG,It is a lovely story with incredible art. Highly underated movie in my opinion.,1475798400,,79,4.714285714285714
3118948,5,B0013RILOG,"This movie has an amazing premise. From start to finish, the creativity is fantastic and the art style is just fun. Add to that some quiet, minimal music and some great voice acting and you've got 5 stars. As an American, I honestly don't understand why we don't get more European kids films like this one over here. Disney's great and all, but you don't get the ingenuity of movies like Nocturna.

Plot
The basic plot of the movie surrounds a young British boy, Tim, who is afraid of the dark. When his favorite star disappears from the night sky he is determined to find out the cause and quickly discovers that the night is not all that it seems. Meeting creative and silly characters along the way, Tim and his new friend Cat Shepherd must fly along the city at night to reach the man in charge. Of course, there's a tad bit of danger along the way as well.",1475625600,,861,4.3478260869565215
3118949,3,B0013RILOG,"This is a cute, imaginative kids' movie that makes being alone and afraid of the dark more magical-seeming than it would otherwise be.  I would recommend it for kids and family nights.",1475539200,,184,4.75

3118957,4,B0013RILOG,"This is a great story and whimsical world idea. Fun to watch, and the choices in voices adds some uniqueness to the characters. The primary issue is the strange contrast in levels between music and the voices. I could barely hear the voices. Or perhaps it was just a poor job done with the audio levels. It detracted a lot from the experience, anyway.",1474070400,,351,4.5

For some reason this movie is the first one that shows up when ""Miyazaki"" is searched. The first 5 minutes of the opening scene may fool you but there's a big chance you'll lose interest just past the 1/4 way point, and give up all hope by the 1/2 way point..

3119082,4,B0013RILOG,"In a worn-down orphanage there is a little boy who does not fit in.  His name is Tim and he has an unabiding love for the stars, one in particular that he claims is his.  One night, after a stressful day, Tims star disappears.  After several more stars go missing, Tim grows worried.  He strikes out on a self-appointed mission to find out what happened to his star.  In the process, Tim falls off a roof but is saved by the Cat Shepherd.  Through a bit of coercion, the Cat Shepherd reluctantly agrees to take Tim to Moka, guardian of the night within the world of Nocturna.  Maybe he can help.  But Moka has no intention of helping Tim.  Instead, he does everything he can to separate Tim from the Cat Shepherd.  Will Tim find the Star Keeper in time and keep the Darkness from engulfing Nocturna?  Or is this the end of life as we know it!?!?!

Nocturna is a Spanish/French fantasy directed by Adria Garcia and Victor Maldonado.  The artwork is elegant and unsophisticated.  The backgrounds are gorgeous but the characters are freakishly odd (bulbous heads and tiny hands).  The story is purposely vague until the final few minutes when it is revealed to be rudimentary at best with a very simple explanation/solution.  Its like that old song, is that all there is?  I was unimpressed but sufficiently entertained; I will keep it for future viewings.",1452816000,4,1353,4.617647058823529

3119118,4,B0013RILOG,"Before I review this film, a word of advice; Don't spend seventy dollars on an old VHS tape. This movie is available for free on YouTube! Now for the review. This movie is one of my guilty pleasures. I love this film. Yes, it doesn't have much of a plot. In fact, I think it would be a better film if they did away with the story and just had Nai Bonet twirl around on dance floors and take baths throughout the entire film. Forget about John Carradine and Yvonne De Carlo. Nai Bonet is the real star. She gets most of the screen time and she's the real reason to watch this film. She's beautiful. She's sexy. She has a delightful smile. She's not modest. She has a charm that rivals Betty Page. Pass the popcorn, I'll watch. She is limited as an actress but this film does not test her limits. She was a belly dancer before she did movies. This film shows her getting in the middle of disco floors and proving to the world that she is...a belly dancer. A belly dancer who doesn't know how to disco dance. But she's beautiful and not modest so, who cares? I also love this film for sentimental reasons. I'm an old dog who grew up during the 70's and disco music makes me nostalgic and I like some of the music on here. Gloria Gaynor's theme song (Love Is Just A Heartbeat Away) is great. I like some of the other music too. I also like spooky castles and cheesy special effects. I also eat up the on location shots of Times Square as it was during the seventies before they cleaned it all up. It's not a horror film. It doesn't really work as a comedy (Brother Theodore is not everyone's idea of comedy). The movie is as superficial as it gets. But it never fails to put a smile on my face.",1442534400,,1690,4.1871165644171775

3119128,5,B0013RILOG,"A work of art. No one should believe animated films are exclusively for children. This is definitely, thematically, a movie geared for adults. It's a beautiful, whimsical story that is completely relatable on many, many levels. I highly recommend sitting down with a glass of wine and maybe a bowl of ice cream and watching.

3119177,4,B0013RILOG,"If you are looking for an action-packed anime, this isn't it -- This is a sweet and at times slow video, though there is plenty happening at various points. The visuals are absolutely stunning and it also has elements of surrealism that elevate it above standard ""churn-em-out children's flicks.""
The development of the two main characters and also their relationship to each other is complex, and there's a lovely theme running through about fear of the dark and the unknown.  I bought it based on reviews, and was initially somewhat hesitant, but now I am glad to have it in my collection, even though I won't necessarily watch it a lot (like, say, a Pixar flick).  However, it is quirky, so you might want to watch it before buying, if you can find a copy.",1433894400,,759,4.614814814814815

3119257,5,B0013RILOG,"Without giving away too much of the story line or plot, Nocturna is simply beautiful to the eyes. I tried out this movie on a whim, expecting average animation and average colors with average character designs and average actual character development... boy was I wrong!

Starting out with the animation, it's smooth, clean and sleek... and while every once in a while I can catch the mouth not quite matching, nearly 98% of the time it's spot on to the point you can't tell this movie's original language isn't English! The actual animation style is nothing to sneeze at either - thin lines and interesting shapes and angels, it's certainly nothing short of spectacular.

Above and beyond the actual animation is the colors. The lighting and shading in this movie is anything but normal, so the interesting hues and blends of colors they chose to illuminate a movie centered on the nighttime hours is actually extremely impressive. It almost puts an entirely new spin on what it should mean to have a nighttime movie scene, and how adequate lighting and hues can make or break a scene surrounded by apparent darkness. Amazingly new and stimulating, thats for sure.

The designs for the characters themselves is well very different than what youd expect in just a normal animated movie. The differences in body shapes, expression, and proportions is very extreme, but in a way that is not too far over the top to get comfortable with. It keeps the designs for each character unique and easily identified without going over the top and bordering on distracting.

Character development. The area a great deal of movies seem to overlook or, plainly put, lack. This movie, in my personal opinion, does justice to the characters and their overall development as the story progresses. Its very stream line and reasonable, and their choices later on are easily relatable based on how themselves as a character has been changing and adapting to the circumstances. Overall while some might border on predictable, its the ones that catch you a little off guard that really seem to settle in nicely with the overall picture.

All in all this is a fantastically put together story with amazing animation, something Id recommend to anyone in need of a feel good plot with a very happy ending.",1424649600,2,2279,4.8785529715762275

3119265,4,B0013RILOG,"When I first saw the online trailers for this I was intrigued.  As both a fan and an artist of traditional animation I was happy to see that the artform was still being produced by some studios somewhere.  I didn't know what to make of the story at the time but I'd hoped it would be as strong as the animation.  Now that I have seen the film, I have to say I was overall very happy with it.  The 2D animation was very nicely done and the effects work and character designs were well done.  The only thing that bothered me just alittle were the main charcarters eyes.  For a child, his eyes were just alittle to beady for me.  It made it difficult at times for the charaacter to emote any major emotional reaction compared to the character of the cat shepherd whom I loved.  I also loved the design on the nightmare creature.  Very well animated.  I would probably give the story itself about 3 to 3.5 stars just because there were some parts of the movie that needed less talk and more action.  I felt some of the story points were a bit underdeveloped and just didn't push far enough toward a really strong gripping end though it was a good resolution to see the main character finally overcome his fear of the dark and be accepted by his peers.  Even though I have seen other animated films with stronger stories, I am very glad I purchased this film and I would recommend it for others who are fans of 2D animation.",1422144000,2,1419,4.293233082706767

3119271,5,B0013RILOG,"If you're wondering what I mean by real animation Im speaking of the classic style of animation, drawn for the most part, as opposed to the CGI animation most movies are made from these days. This is not to discredit those films, they're wonderful as well. But there are times when you just long to see that classic Disney style of animation from the past. So it was a wonderful welcome when I put in NOCTURNA and pushed play. I was taken not just to a time when that form of animation was the standard but to a wonderful world and story thats great for all ages.

Made in 2007 the movie makes its way to DVD now. The story revolves around a young orphan named Tim, a boy who dreams of a much bigger world and who is obsessed with the stars. Thats in part because he has a fear of the dark. Each night when the lights go out he pushes his bunk bed to the window and unlocks the shutters so he can look at the stars in the sky, in particular one he calls his own.

When his secret handle is stolen so he cant open the shutters, Tim goes to the roof to look at the stars and notices that they're beginning to disappear, starting with his star. As he worries about this he notices a large number of cats on the roof followed by a huge person who identifies himself as the cat Shepherd. The cat Shepherd is part of an unseen world to humans, people who control the night and sleep of children around the world. Each cat is supposed to make sure his human child is asleep. Tims cat is more prone to sleep on the job rather than help Tim sleep. When Tim tells the cat Shepherd what is going on he receives a deaf ear. When he threatens to stay awake until he sees the man in charge the cat Shepherd takes him to headquarters.

Rather than be taken to this ruler as he wished, Tim is forced to sneak in to see him. At that time he is given a quest to help solve the problem of the missing stars. The journey takes him to various parts of the city at night, eventually landing at a light house where he may or may not find the answer that he seeks. Along the way he bonds with the cat Shepherd and faces dangers that many in this land of night might not survive from if he isn't successful in his task.

The movie is not only a joy for the eyes with old style animation that glows on the screen but offers a nice story as well. Tim is the hero that children will root for, one of them, a young boy who is afraid of the dark and unwilling to admit it at first. As the story progresses he must face his own fears if he is to save the world as we or they know it. Its a story of heroism in the face of danger but not a danger that might seem actually life threatening to a child.

The movie holds your attention from start to finish with what has been described as a Tim Burtonesque style of city. I can see the comparison a bit but not near as much as most. There are similarities but not enough that this movie doesnt offer its own world for us to enjoy. The characters we are treated to are at times odd, at times humorous and always interesting. Tims acceptance of each of them displays the innocence of a child who doesnt see the differences in the rest of the world.

The movie offers a great story, great animation and a lesson that all children can benefit from by the last panel. It offers something rare to find these days, entertainment that the entire family can enjoy without adults being bored and that children will be delighted to watch. For some just looking at the visual treat will be enough. Id suggest that you take it all in though and enjoy every bit of it. Not one to rent but one to put in your collection, even if you don't have children.",1417564800,9,3653,4.109243697478991
3119272,5,B0013RILOG,"NOCTURNA - A DAZZLING WORLD OF LIGHT AND SHADOWS - FILLED WITH WONDEROUS CHATACTERS

This long overdue U.S. release of a European animated film is truly the highest quality.  If you only saw a poster or ad featuring the graphically flat features of the characters, you may mistake this for only a modestly good quality cartoon.  This is absolutely not the case.  The intentionally flat looking characters populate and contrast a very three dimensional world.  Their personalities are filled with depth and character.  In an age of burp and fart humor, here is a children's tale filled with meaning and inspiration.  The artistry as well is brilliant!

THE STORY:  Tim is a little boy in a large and aging orphanage where he is not particularly popular or consequential.  He is also terrified of the dark and sleeps near a window where he can see his star Adhara that comforts him while he sleeps.  One night he is alarmed by the discovery that his star Adhara has disappeared.  Tim goes to the roof to investigate and nearly falls off the building, but is saved by a strange character called the Cat Shepherd.  This creature is responsible, along with his cats, for making sure little children go to sleep.  As they discuss the missing star, others begin to disappear as well.  The world is growing darker.  A mysterious and shadowy force is hiding the stars and attacking the Luminouses that are responsible for making the street lamps burn bright.  Tim is soon on a journey throughout Nocturna to find the star keeper and defeat the evil that is stealing all the light.  He is aided by a strange and wonderful cast of friends including the Cat Shepherd, his guardian cat Tobumori, The North Star, and many others.  But in the end he will have to face his own fears of the dark when things look most bleak.

Beautiful and evocative, this will entertain many adults as well as children.  However, it is a children's tale after all and subjective as to whether it will entertain teenagers and above in age.  It has a wonderful message and a well fleshed out story.  This is absolute quality from the art to the voice acting.  I highly recommend it, though you may want to rent first if you are an adult who just loves animation.",1415923200,31,2227,4.651282051282052

3353402,4,B0013RILOG,"Nocturna is one of the most creatively designed and beautifully animated films I have seen in years. The look of this film is superior to some of the juggernauts, Disney in particular. The movement of the characters is beautifully captured and the world they live in is lushly detailed and lit. The attention to detail and light is on par with recent 3D Dreamworks films. It showcases many of the virtues of 2D animation, and is clearly a labour of love by its creators. Headless Productions is an excellent company, and if you peruse their production blog you'll see that they have a stock of brilliant ideas just waiting to be funded and realised.
I can't give it five stars though.
It's a beautiful looking film but it has a story that really needed tighter editing and direction to shine. The central conflict and its cause are not foreshadowed in a particularly effective way, which means that dramatic conclusion isn't as satisfying as it could be. There are a few too many characters and loose ends. The initial villain isn't intimidating, and while you expect the main character to fall from grace late in the story, he's given an immediate out. This is a kind message for children watching the film (it's ok when you make a mistake without meaning to) but it means that the end of the film meanders. It's not very satisfying. I consider it to be a good film to put the kids in front of but it won't necessarily capture their interest for long. It's value is that it shows just what this company could be capable of and what you can achieve with good art design and a stellar animation crew.
With some decent marketing it would've done very well but I don't think it got that. It's a gorgeous film though and I consider it a must for animation fans.",1328054400,22,1757,4.545741324921136

I wasn't sure what the movie was about, but I love animation, so I decided to give it a shot.  The film is about a boy in an orphanage, who can't sleep at night unless he she his favorite star.  He is a bit of an insomniac.  One night he sees something he is not suppose to see.

He sees different characters doing their job i.e. rustling of leaves, scratches on window panes, creature that light the street lights..  He falls in with a cat herder..  Yes, a cat herder. Cats are assigned to make sure that the children go to sleep each night.  One night, his favorite star disappears and he has an adventure finding how and why to fix the problem.  Throughout the movie there are a lot of different characters, the afore mentioned cat herder, creatures that put the dew out at night, talking light filaments, plus a lot more.

3353435,1,B0013RILOG,"This movie is a really poor imitation of some of the magical children's movies it appears to be looking to for inspiration (Studio Ghibli movies, The Song of the Sea and The Book of Kells).  The characters are annoying--inconsistent and unbelievable--while the plot feels forced and makes no sense.  I felt like I was watching a really weak piece of drama -- throughout the movie I remained hyper-aware of the fact that someone had actually written this ridiculous dialogue, trying to be deep or create tension, but doing it in such a heavy-handed way that it had no transporting effect.  Definitely skip this.",1478649600,,610,4.902912621359223

Still, this movie is a cinematic gem that deserves a ton of appreciation. First of all, it's a 2D production, that is so refreshing in a time of 3D movies. You can clearly tell that this was created by a group of people who love their craft and who pushed their talents to the Nth degree. What else can I say? The night never looked so enchanting and so dangerous at the same time.",1477267200,,497,4.134020618556701

3353445,5,B0013RILOG,"This movie has an amazing premise. From start to finish, the creativity is fantastic and the art style is just fun. Add to that some quiet, minimal music and some great voice acting and you've got 5 stars. As an American, I honestly don't understand why we don't get more European kids films like this one over here. Disney's great and all, but you don't get the ingenuity of movies like Nocturna.

Plot
The basic plot of the movie surrounds a young British boy, Tim, who is afraid of the dark. When his favorite star disappears from the night sky he is determined to find out the cause and quickly discovers that the night is not all that it seems. Meeting creative and silly characters along the way, Tim and his new friend Cat Shepherd must fly along the city at night to reach the man in charge. Of course, there's a tad bit of danger along the way as well.",1475625600,,861,4.3478260869565215

3353454,4,B0013RILOG,"This is a great story and whimsical world idea. Fun to watch, and the choices in voices adds some uniqueness to the characters. The primary issue is the strange contrast in levels between music and the voices. I could barely hear the voices. Or perhaps it was just a poor job done with the audio levels. It detracted a lot from the experience, anyway.",1474070400,,351,4.5

3353579,4,B0013RILOG,"In a worn-down orphanage there is a little boy who does not fit in.  His name is Tim and he has an unabiding love for the stars, one in particular that he claims is his.  One night, after a stressful day, Tims star disappears.  After several more stars go missing, Tim grows worried.  He strikes out on a self-appointed mission to find out what happened to his star.  In the process, Tim falls off a roof but is saved by the Cat Shepherd.  Through a bit of coercion, the Cat Shepherd reluctantly agrees to take Tim to Moka, guardian of the night within the world of Nocturna.  Maybe he can help.  But Moka has no intention of helping Tim.  Instead, he does everything he can to separate Tim from the Cat Shepherd.  Will Tim find the Star Keeper in time and keep the Darkness from engulfing Nocturna?  Or is this the end of life as we know it!?!?!

Nocturna is a Spanish/French fantasy directed by Adria Garcia and Victor Maldonado.  The artwork is elegant and unsophisticated.  The backgrounds are gorgeous but the characters are freakishly odd (bulbous heads and tiny hands).  The story is purposely vague until the final few minutes when it is revealed to be rudimentary at best with a very simple explanation/solution.  Its like that old song, is that all there is?  I was unimpressed but sufficiently entertained; I will keep it for future viewings.",1452816000,4,1353,4.617647058823529

3353615,4,B0013RILOG,"Before I review this film, a word of advice; Don't spend seventy dollars on an old VHS tape. This movie is available for free on YouTube! Now for the review. This movie is one of my guilty pleasures. I love this film. Yes, it doesn't have much of a plot. In fact, I think it would be a better film if they did away with the story and just had Nai Bonet twirl around on dance floors and take baths throughout the entire film. Forget about John Carradine and Yvonne De Carlo. Nai Bonet is the real star. She gets most of the screen time and she's the real reason to watch this film. She's beautiful. She's sexy. She has a delightful smile. She's not modest. She has a charm that rivals Betty Page. Pass the popcorn, I'll watch. She is limited as an actress but this film does not test her limits. She was a belly dancer before she did movies. This film shows her getting in the middle of disco floors and proving to the world that she is...a belly dancer. A belly dancer who doesn't know how to disco dance. But she's beautiful and not modest so, who cares? I also love this film for sentimental reasons. I'm an old dog who grew up during the 70's and disco music makes me nostalgic and I like some of the music on here. Gloria Gaynor's theme song (Love Is Just A Heartbeat Away) is great. I like some of the other music too. I also like spooky castles and cheesy special effects. I also eat up the on location shots of Times Square as it was during the seventies before they cleaned it all up. It's not a horror film. It doesn't really work as a comedy (Brother Theodore is not everyone's idea of comedy). The movie is as superficial as it gets. But it never fails to put a smile on my face.",1442534400,,1690,4.1871165644171775

The development of the two main characters and also their relationship to each other is complex, and there's a lovely theme running through about fear of the dark and the unknown.  I bought it based on reviews, and was initially somewhat hesitant, but now I am glad to have it in my collection, even though I won't necessarily watch it a lot (like, say, a Pixar flick).

3353754,5,B0013RILOG,"Without giving away too much of the story line or plot, Nocturna is simply beautiful to the eyes. I tried out this movie on a whim, expecting average animation and average colors with average character designs and average actual character development... boy was I wrong!

Starting out with the animation, it's smooth, clean and sleek... and while every once in a while I can catch the mouth not quite matching, nearly 98% of the time it's spot on to the point you can't tell this movie's original language isn't English! The actual animation style is nothing to sneeze at either - thin lines and interesting shapes and angels, it's certainly nothing short of spectacular.

Above and beyond the actual animation is the colors. The lighting and shading in this movie is anything but normal, so the interesting hues and blends of colors they chose to illuminate a movie centered on the nighttime hours is actually extremely impressive. It almost puts an entirely new spin on what it should mean to have a nighttime movie scene, and how adequate lighting and hues can make or break a scene surrounded by apparent darkness. Amazingly new and stimulating, thats for sure.

The designs for the characters themselves is well very different than what youd expect in just a normal animated movie. The differences in body shapes, expression, and proportions is very extreme, but in a way that is not too far over the top to get comfortable with. It keeps the designs for each character unique and easily identified without going over the top and bordering on distracting.

Character development. The area a great deal of movies seem to overlook or, plainly put, lack. This movie, in my personal opinion, does justice to the characters and their overall development as the story progresses. Its very stream line and reasonable, and their choices later on are easily relatable based on how themselves as a character has been changing and adapting to the circumstances. Overall while some might border on predictable, its the ones that catch you a little off guard that really seem to settle in nicely with the overall picture.

All in all this is a fantastically put together story with amazing animation, something Id recommend to anyone in need of a feel good plot with a very happy ending.",1424649600,2,2279,4.8785529715762275

As both a fan and an artist of traditional animation I was happy to see that the artform was still being produced by some studios somewhere.  I didn't know what to make of the story at the time but I'd hoped it would be as strong as the animation.  Now that I have seen the film, I have to say I was overall very happy with it.  The 2D animation was very nicely done and the effects work and character designs were well done.  The only thing that bothered me just alittle were the main charcarters eyes.  For a child, his eyes were just alittle to beady for me.  It made it difficult at times for the charaacter to emote any major emotional reaction compared to the character of the cat shepherd whom I loved.  I also loved the design on the nightmare creature.  Very well animated.  I would probably give the story itself about 3 to 3.5 stars just because there were some parts of the movie that needed less talk and more action.  I felt some of the story points were a bit underdeveloped and just didn't push far enough toward a really strong gripping end though it was a good resolution to see the main character finally overcome his fear of the dark and be accepted by his peers.  Even though I have seen other animated films with stronger stories, I am very glad I purchased this film and I would recommend it for others who are fans of 2D animation.",1422144000,2,1419,4.293233082706767

3353768,5,B0013RILOG,"If you're wondering what I mean by real animation Im speaking of the classic style of animation, drawn for the most part, as opposed to the CGI animation most movies are made from these days. This is not to discredit those films, they're wonderful as well. But there are times when you just long to see that classic Disney style of animation from the past. So it was a wonderful welcome when I put in NOCTURNA and pushed play. I was taken not just to a time when that form of animation was the standard but to a wonderful world and story thats great for all ages.

Made in 2007 the movie makes its way to DVD now. The story revolves around a young orphan named Tim, a boy who dreams of a much bigger world and who is obsessed with the stars. Thats in part because he has a fear of the dark. Each night when the lights go out he pushes his bunk bed to the window and unlocks the shutters so he can look at the stars in the sky, in particular one he calls his own.

When his secret handle is stolen so he cant open the shutters, Tim goes to the roof to look at the stars and notices that they're beginning to disappear, starting with his star. As he worries about this he notices a large number of cats on the roof followed by a huge person who identifies himself as the cat Shepherd. The cat Shepherd is part of an unseen world to humans, people who control the night and sleep of children around the world. Each cat is supposed to make sure his human child is asleep. Tims cat is more prone to sleep on the job rather than help Tim sleep. When Tim tells the cat Shepherd what is going on he receives a deaf ear. When he threatens to stay awake until he sees the man in charge the cat Shepherd takes him to headquarters.

Rather than be taken to this ruler as he wished, Tim is forced to sneak in to see him. At that time he is given a quest to help solve the problem of the missing stars. The journey takes him to various parts of the city at night, eventually landing at a light house where he may or may not find the answer that he seeks. Along the way he bonds with the cat Shepherd and faces dangers that many in this land of night might not survive from if he isn't successful in his task.

The movie is not only a joy for the eyes with old style animation that glows on the screen but offers a nice story as well. Tim is the hero that children will root for, one of them, a young boy who is afraid of the dark and unwilling to admit it at first. As the story progresses he must face his own fears if he is to save the world as we or they know it. Its a story of heroism in the face of danger but not a danger that might seem actually life threatening to a child.

The movie holds your attention from start to finish with what has been described as a Tim Burtonesque style of city. I can see the comparison a bit but not near as much as most. There are similarities but not enough that this movie doesnt offer its own world for us to enjoy. The characters we are treated to are at times odd, at times humorous and always interesting. Tims acceptance of each of them displays the innocence of a child who doesnt see the differences in the rest of the world.

The movie offers a great story, great animation and a lesson that all children can benefit from by the last panel. It offers something rare to find these days, entertainment that the entire family can enjoy without adults being bored and that children will be delighted to watch. For some just looking at the visual treat will be enough. Id suggest that you take it all in though and enjoy every bit of it. Not one to rent but one to put in your collection, even if you don't have children.",1417564800,9,3653,4.109243697478991
3353769,5,B0013RILOG,"NOCTURNA - A DAZZLING WORLD OF LIGHT AND SHADOWS - FILLED WITH WONDEROUS CHATACTERS

This long overdue U.S. release of a European animated film is truly the highest quality.  If you only saw a poster or ad featuring the graphically flat features of the characters, you may mistake this for only a modestly good quality cartoon.  This is absolutely not the case.  The intentionally flat looking characters populate and contrast a very three dimensional world.  Their personalities are filled with depth and character.  In an age of burp and fart humor, here is a children's tale filled with meaning and inspiration.  The artistry as well is brilliant!

THE STORY:  Tim is a little boy in a large and aging orphanage where he is not particularly popular or consequential.  He is also terrified of the dark and sleeps near a window where he can see his star Adhara that comforts him while he sleeps.  One night he is alarmed by the discovery that his star Adhara has disappeared.  Tim goes to the roof to investigate and nearly falls off the building, but is saved by a strange character called the Cat Shepherd.  This creature is responsible, along with his cats, for making sure little children go to sleep.  As they discuss the missing star, others begin to disappear as well.  The world is growing darker.  A mysterious and shadowy force is hiding the stars and attacking the Luminouses that are responsible for making the street lamps burn bright.  Tim is soon on a journey throughout Nocturna to find the star keeper and defeat the evil that is stealing all the light.  He is aided by a strange and wonderful cast of friends including the Cat Shepherd, his guardian cat Tobumori, The North Star, and many others.  But in the end he will have to face his own fears of the dark when things look most bleak.

Beautiful and evocative, this will entertain many adults as well as children.  However, it is a children's tale after all and subjective as to whether it will entertain teenagers and above in age.  It has a wonderful message and a well fleshed out story.  This is absolute quality from the art to the voice acting.  I highly recommend it, though you may want to rent first if you are an adult who just loves animation.",1415923200,31,2227,4.651282051282052

3353771,3,B0013RILOG,"NOCTURNA stars the cadaverous John Carradine as Count Dracula. He's ancient, wearing false-fangs now. He's being cared for by his granddaughter, NOCTURNA (Nai Bonet). Drac's castle has been turned into a hotel. This is, of course, a comedy, but the leaden acting and humorless ""jokes"" derail the movie fast. Also, since it was made in 1979, it's filled w/ bubblegum disco music! This is especially disconcerting when it blares during the love scenes! However, NOCTURNA herself is definitely a dancing queen! If you happen to be a disco dance fan, then you will flip over NOCTURNA's blazing moves! It's too bad Ms. Bonet can't act at all, or she'd be perfect! Yes, her clothing flies off at regular intervals. Her bubble bath is heavenly. It features her oil-is-my-friend sequence. Oh my goodness! Brother Theodore ""stars"" as the horny / creepy desk clerk. He's a perverted riot! NOCTURNA soon relocates to NYC, and stays at the Brooklyn castle of her friend, Jugula Vein (Yvonne De Carlo!). Ms. De Carlo is excellent, and looks fantastic! She's the only other reason to watch this silly movie. Although, there are a few funny scenes. The NY brothel scene is priceless!
