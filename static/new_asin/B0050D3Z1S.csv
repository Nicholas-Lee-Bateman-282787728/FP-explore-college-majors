8451064,3,B0050D3Z1S,"Let me preface this review by saying that the only reason I found out about this DVD was due to a news story relating to the untimely death of one of my all-time favorite wrestlers, ""Macho Man"" Randy Savage.  I had no idea that the Poffo family were the ""caretakers"" of the Gorgeous George legacy until then.  When I saw that they were offering this disc, I immediately bought it, not only because of my desire to learn more about the history of the sport, but because I wanted to ""do my part"" to help the family establish what I hoped would be a venue to produce more DVD's of the early days of 1950's era wrestling.  While right at 2 hours long, this DVD was nothing special.  I hate to say that because of my respect for the Poffo family and all they have done to promote the art of what we all now call ""sports entertainment"", but it's true.  Back in ""those days"", matches were 2 out of 3 falls, often with 60 minute time limits.  And that's what you get with this disc.  You get to see three matches with Gorgeous George battling 3 different opponents.  Lanny Poffo serves as the host/narrator during the show.  While I have a great amount of respect for George as a pioneer in the sport, I can't help but feel that this DVD falls flat in its' execution.  I completely understand how ""Macho Man"" used Gorgeous George as his influence, but in all honesty, I would much rather have seen a documentary about the Poffo family.  Since GG was inducted into the WWE HOF a couple of years ago, I have to say that now, after Randy Savage's death, future DVD's should focus on the legacy of the Poffo family, if they continue.  I have reverence for what GG did during his time, but his matches don't make for an interesting DVD.  They should certainly be viewed by all who love to see the chronicles of this sport, but all in all, it didn't make for a very fun viewing experience.  As I stated before, I hate to give a negative or so-so review to this disc, but I can't help it.  Let me close by saying RIP Randy Poffo, and thank you to Lanny for being a very good host for a somewhat lukewarm DVD.",1306627200,,2093,4.263291139240506
