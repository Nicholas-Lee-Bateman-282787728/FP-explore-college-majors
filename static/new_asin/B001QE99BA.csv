3764557,4,B001QE99BA,"380 minutes of running time means these discs include only the original 9 episodes that already aired on television. Even these producers didn't have the kahonies to produce a conclusion to satisfy their diehard fans whom one would assume would gobble up this set at a chance to get some answers. If even they don't have faith in their own product, then I will keep my $20 (+shipping) and just watch the episodes I have recorded on my Apple TV. I'm really disappointed in NBC for canceling it in the first place, and in the show's producers for not producing a conclusion to include in the DVD. Shame on all of you!

I loved this show, but this DVD set is a real disappointment.",1238198400,111,678,4.467741935483871
3764558,5,B001QE99BA,"It was good seeing Christian Slater on-screen again. I looked forward to this show every week. There was a little suspense with each show as to when and under what situation that mild-mannered Henry would appear when hitman Edward would be in the middle of doing what he does. Definitely should still be on the air. Reminds me of when New York Undercover was taken off the air.

Some of us DO enjoy non-silly programming and prefer shows of substance. Can we start a petition to bring it back?",1238112000,44,493,4.53932584269663

3764564,5,B001QE99BA,"The premise only appears to be ""thin""; the delivery is excellent. Granted, I could probably enjoy Christian Slater performing the telephone book, but he manages to create two very different personalities who, ironically, share not only the same body but the same dilemma: Which one is the ""real"" one? Without offering any substantive spoilers, I can tell you that there are moments when the ""suburban dad"" actually has a better solution to a problem than the ""hard-core spy."" The contrast is presented well, creating whole new situations for both characters to have to deal with, often in not merely comical but moving ways.

I agree that it's disappointing not to have a real conclusion to the series. Several stories such as this have had their plugs pulled, suddenly and without warning (""Harsh Realm"" comes to mind). It's not enjoyable to have your fun stopped in the middle (a sort of voyeurus interruptus), but the rest of the experience is more than worth it.",1444003200,,966,4.92638036809816

3764577,2,B001QE99BA,"My Own Worst Enemy was one of the critics picks to be the big winner of the 2008 Prime time TV line up, but was cancelled after just nine episodes. Despite gaining a cult following, and being released on DVD, the show was very expensive to make and just wasn't that interesting. Christan Slater plays Henry Spivey, a simple businessman with a wife and two kids. Every day when Henry goes to work at his Insurance office, he looks into the elevators retinal scanner and is transformed to another person, Edward Albright, a top spy for an unknown U.S. Government agency. The first problem I had with this show is that the whole family situation could have been copied and pasted right from the film True Lies. If that was the only issue, I could have gotten passed it, but the truth is the every episode in the series was nearly identical and the show just went around in circles. Something breaks in Edward/Henry's brain and he keeps switching back and fourth at the most inopportune times. The two are made aware of each and often have to take each others place. They even leave digital messages for one another. That fact is that this show just wasn't that original, not to mention it was very predictable and extremely frustrating to watch. You had to know that almost every time Edward went on a mission Henry would appear and have to do something he wasn't trained for. It was cute the first time, but by the fourth or fifth time, I had more than enough of it. The same is true with the Edward showing up during family time and seeming strange to his wife and kids. The bottom line, My Own Worst Enemy had a great cast, but a mediocre, predictable story, that just went around in circles. All the guns, explosions, and special effects in the world would have been enough to save this show.",1420934400,,1793,4.486238532110092

3764583,4,B001QE99BA,"""I'm not sending you back anytime soon..."" My Own Worst Enemy is suspiciously on the heels of BBC's Jekyll (2007 mini-series by the great Steven Moffat) but with more Spy than psychopath and THIS Jekyll has a hi-tech support staff that isn't always too supportive. Great cast, sadly short-lived (NBC!). Suburbanite &  Efficiency Expert Henry Spivey discovers he is two people in one body, his dark alter-ego Edward Albright is a operative for alarmingly amoral covert group. The problem is the switch isn't happening upon activation as planned by the powers that be Henry & Edward (just like Robert Louis Stevenson's characters) are waking up in each other's business. Henry's past is unraveling as his present becomes more precarious. Helping Henry along this dangerous path  and adding another layer of insight (and exposition) is the sexy company ""Head shrinker"" who Henry any exactly confide in as thing grow more complicated with each mission. Questions arise about Edward's parents' death and Henry's son and his possible dark half traits. Questions about his wife...Throw private detectives and federal agents into the mix and you've got yourself a show.

Christian Slater's performance in the duel roles is far more subtle than James Nesbitt's in Jekyll.
Recurring cast includes Oscar nominees James Cromwell & Alfie Woodard who are the series answer to 007's ""M"", also writer/producer Mike O'Malley serves as co-worker Tom and a fresh from Twilight Taylor Lautner  as Henry's son. Sharknado's John Heard and Predator's Bill Duke turn up briefly a villains.

Light on humor, heavy on espionage and spy pseudo tech My Own Worst Enemy is a very watchable series, but sadly incomplete at 9 episodes ending quite unended for obvious reasons, but it's not less furstrating.",1405555200,,1776,5.195804195804196

3764594,3,B001QE99BA,"I may be in the minority here with an average rating of this series, but it truly did not blow me away.

So first, I will say that I'm a Christian Slater fan, that was one of the draws for me towards this series.  The other was that I was intrigued by the premise of this show, (also it didn't hurt that I picked this series up for 6 bucks.)

I was however disappointed after watching the first few episodes.  My disappointment may be due to the fact that I may have been expecting him to play a character similar to the one he played in the movie Kuffs (classic), and also the fact that I had just recently watched Chuck, Human Target and currently watching Burn Notice.

I like spy movies and TV shows, but I found myself becoming frustrated watching this show because it was a little difficult for me to wrap my head around the premise that a chip can be placed in an operatives brain that can completely isolate their personalities.

I had issues with this when I considered that when not on missions, these operatives are normal business people with families, and have no idea that they are in fact spies.  Since I don't believe in spoilers in my reviews, I will not go into the other paradoxes I had trouble with.

Overall, for the price, it may be worth it to get this series...or not.",1392854400,,1292,4.331950207468879

3764603,5,B001QE99BA,What an AMAZING show. I found out about this show by browsing through Amazon's TV section and I had to buy it because of Christian Slater. I devoured the 9 episodes in less than 2 days and was extremely disappointed. The producers really should have concluded the show properly for their fans. Now I have to imagine my own ending. The show is phenomenal but the DVD isn't worth the cheap price because of it's disappointing and abrupt ending. I'm upset that I bought this and fell in love with it just to be let down. I'm not going to return it but I wish I hadn't bought it in the first place.,1372896000,,594,4.265486725663717

3764610,5,B001QE99BA,"So I stumble across this tv show and being a fan of both Madchen Amick and Christian Slater for their previous works I decided to borrow the DVD of My Own Worst Enemy...I watched about 10 minutes of it and hated it...Hated it. I left it in my DVD player for like 4 days then decided to watch more of it and kinda fell in love with the show. Im not a spy action type of gal and I think in the beginning thats what turned me off but I really think this show was clever and im disappointed that it was canceled. Christian plays Henry, a man with a split personality named Edward. Henry is a normal guy with a full time job, beautiful wife * played by Madchen Amick* and two kids. All American dream kinda. Edward is his other half who happens to be spy and a real lady killer. Edward works for this agency who sends him on different missions and they have the ability to switch the personalities on and off. The only problem is that all of a sudden they cant control Henry/Edward's mind and when they need him to be one person, he's the other. It seems a bit crazy I know but I gave it a chance. The storyline is great and it does keep you on the edge of your seat. Alfre Woodard, James Cromwell and Mike O'Mally are also involved with this spy agency. Christian and Madchen have a great chemistry as husband and wife. They look good together on screen. FINAL WORD: Great cast and good plots. A definite must see. I think the only issue with the show is that it would have been better suited for cable. Showtime or HBO.",1356998400,,1516,4.177474402730375

3764612,4,B001QE99BA,"I liked the look of this one while it had it's run, wish it had lasted longer. The ""look"" of the series was always very good and the writing seemed pretty good too. Similar to Joss Whedons' ""Dollhouse"" in that the character ""Edward"" has a dual identity as ""Henry"" imprinted in his mind, activated when he's off duty. I was never really sure who, or what Edward worked for- some shadowy Government, or private, agency?- but the stories were interesting and always had a good look to them.
Christian Slater did a good job portraying dual roles as Edward and Henry, I'd have loved to see how that one would've worked out. Judging by my memory, and the air dates Amazon lists, NBC didn't give the series a lot of respect- they certainly cancelled it quickly. Probably had too big a budget and wasn't an instant ratings success.

I've rewatched episodes 1-6 & 9, all good. The first 6 at least have a young Taylor Lautner in them (the packaging makes a point of emphasizing ""Twilight"") he's good but miscast as he doesn't look anything like the rest of his ""family"".

Even if you don't like My own worst enemy it's still better than most of the trash out there.",1355702400,,1156,4.5

3764614,5,B001QE99BA,"Once again, a good piece of television programming succumbs while the hog-wall'er, bitch-slap, scripted reality world continues to spin out of control with overly fed tow truck drama queens, pawn shops seeing more action than a mid-town police station at 11:30 at night, over wrought cooking/contestant/dancing/prancing/etc. nit-wittery  and Scooby-Doo ghost hunters. I don't watch much television because, after an hour of cringing at any overt banality that currently enthralls and keeps the masses in a stupor of stupidity, my whole body cramps up.
  This show had more than a one note tune going on. Christian Slater filled out the Henry/Edward character very admirably and the supporting cast was, pretty much, top-notch, as well. Once introduced to the show, I was hooked and loved the tension built upon the uncertainty of who would manifest at any inconvenient moment.
  Smart, tense, well scripted with enough of a salt shake of humor to insure enough pathos to find Henrys'/ Edwards' dilemma compelling enough to continue watching each episode.
  Ah, well, .... more time to read a good book.

3764616,5,B001QE99BA,"This was a fun little series that was cancelled before its time.  It is interesting to see similar (but less exciting) dual-life concept shows still popping up in television today (""Awake"", ""Lone Star"", etc).  Most of the fun in this tv series comes from the ""fish out of water"" scenarios as domestic Henry often ""wakes-up"" in the middle of Edward's spy missions and vice versa as Edward ""wakes-up"" in Henry's domestic life.  Henry stumbles through Edward's dangerous spygame life using his nice-guy personality to somehow win over informants and KGB spies alike while maintaining national security.  Similarly, Edward puts his spy knowledge to good use in Henry's life (for example, Edward's carefully honed bedplay skills are put to good use with Henry's wife to inadvertently help save his marriage and Edward's encouragement of his son's martial arts abilities help him bond with his son).  Both Christian Slater and Mike O'Mally do a fairly good job of differentiating each personality so that we can tell who they are playing despite the lack of external cues.  For example, at the start of the episode or an act break, Slater would have to manage to convey which character he is playing (Edward or Henry) often without any exposition or visual cues.  The audience must tell strictly from the characters' facial expressions and body language alone.  This is not always successful, but for the most part Slater and O'Mally do a fantastic job and some of these episodes are a real testament to their acting ability.

Episodes are currently (as of April 2012) available on Hulu in the US but if you are looking for something to watch on the go (an overseas business trip) or want to introduce a friend to a fun little series as a gift (and then discuss potential outcomes of the unrequited cliffhanger ending) pick it up and give it a go.

3764619,3,B001QE99BA,"This is indeed a riveting series ... at first sight.
A bit of thinking, however, brings up so many inconsistencies that the whole setup becomes ridiculous.
Obviously, one premise is the acceptance of the given: that it is possible to create another persona of a human being by implanting some chip in his brain. And to control this chip (even in a remote fashion, wow). OK, let me accept that (after all this was also the case in the splendid Dollhouse). Let me also accept the possibility that an organism owning this control, including advanced ICT means, can exist without being detected.
Fine. So, where do the families (wife and kids) of the fake personas (Henry & Tom) come from?
When an operative is ""broken"" (i.e. the switch doesn't work anymore), he/she gets terminated which means, returned to their original persona and the fake person gets erased from their memory, right?
But then what is the original persona of Ellen/Paula? It seems to be Ellen. But would Ellen have voluntarily submitted to the implant experiment? Remember, however, that in the case of Andrew/Henry, it is Andrew who is the original. Idem ditto for Tom/Raymond: it is Raymond. Or do I get it all wrong?
So what is the idea here: the brutal persona is the real operative, and the meek one is the fake? Seems appropriate ...
But then, why? Why would the operative need such a dormant persona? Since they are continually called up for missions, there is not great need to disguise them as sleepers!
Further: when the manageress finds out that Henry/Andrew is broken, why does she not immediately terminate him. After all, he proves to be a considerable security risk!
It seems that sys-management has other ideas, and agent Proctor is on the verge of physically eliminating Andrew/Henry. Ah! But wasn't the policy in such cases to return the person to his original persona?
And what about the worn thin clich of a responsible agent (the Psychologist) being in a torrid love affair with Andrew, for which reason she jeopardizes the whole organization?
Next, Henry and Andrew sharing the same mobile, the same computer? How is that for a security risk?
The interpretation of Christian Slater also leaves something to be desired. Admittedly, he has a nice challenge playing Henry, then Andrew, then Andrew pretending to be Henry, then Henry pretending to be Andrew. However, he does not always succeed in differentiating. Maybe that is what was desired by the writers, though.
In many ways, this series is also comparable with Alias, just as incredible, but much more consistent.
Writers of such ""disbelievability"" must be the more attentive to consistency. Such is not the case here.
Exasperated, I stopped viewing after episode 4, and I feel that it is appropriate that the series be discontinued.

3764620,5,B001QE99BA,"Yes, the concept is tricky; but it was ably smoothed out after the first episode. Everything was improved (they were five stars start to too-soon finish.) So MY OWN WORST ENEMY joins FIREFLY and a long list of other too-good-for-the-Networks.

MY OWN WORST ENEMY is, er, was a great series. Their quality showed in every episode - their international locations and consistently fine components (noted in the title, above)would have found an audience eager for such quality. And Slater was a charismatic, forceful lead; at the same time, believable as a domesticated wage slave and a covett operative. I hope Network management reads the comments of disappointed viewers; for MY OWN WORST ENEMY and the many prematurely axed shows which have been inappropriately turned into history.

Methinks that Network canceling executives have a very dim view of their viewers. Foolish, too. Considering start-up investments of producers and Networks, this bad
taste by TV execs is wasting so much money; no wonder America is in a recession.

Deduct one or two stars if you really despise finding a series you love only to have it cancelled and left completely unresolved.

I would recommend it to people who liked the USA La Femme Nikita series.",1320624000,,408,4.285714285714286

3764627,5,B001QE99BA,"I really enjoyed this show. It started off a bit slow - I was lukewarm about the first couple of episodes, but by the 4th episode it really hit its stride. A lot more character development than is typically seen in the spy vs. spy genre, and it grapples with the always interesting concept of the inherent duality in everyone. But, there's also a lot of action (with excellent production values) and tech so it can be enjoyed on that level as well.

As you know, the series was cancelled, so it ends with a non-resolved cliffhanger. Still, it's well worth getting especially if you're a Christian Slater fan. His performance as ""both"" the stars of the show is excellent, and the supporting cast is also quite good (for the most part - a couple of the performances are just adequate).

It's a shame that this was cancelled - I would absolutely love to see another season! But, even though the storyline does not have a resoultion, it can still be enjoyed.",1284768000,2,954,4.540697674418604
3764628,4,B001QE99BA,"Honestly, I feel bad for Producer Jason Smilovic. I notice his name is on really good high concept, televison shows that get axed because of a damn Writer's Strike. There's BIONIC WOMAN, MY OWN WORST ENEMY, and KIDNAPPED (which actually wasn't canceled because of a strike).
I really enjoyed this show a lot, and was really pissed off at the ""series finale"". Why they couldn't produce one more episode to give it a proper cliff-hanger ending. Instead, we're given a ""What's gonna happen next episode--oh wait! There never will be one!"" kind of ending.
I enjoyed the show very much though. Christian Slater was great in his interesting dual-roles, which to me was slightly reminiscent of Kevin Spacey as Verbal Kint/Kaiser Soze in THE USUAL SUSPECTS. Mike O'Malley was so good he was unrecognizable as the funny guy from ""Yes, Dear"".
It's really a shame that this became a casualty of the WGA Strike of 2008, but I enjoy it nonetheless.",1280534400,2,935,4.813664596273292
3764629,4,B001QE99BA,"This show had great potential but I believe it was marketed incorrectly and not given enough time to build an audience.  I remember the over-the-top trailers for the show during the summer and thinking it was going to be another ridiculous action-show.  But I decided to watch it anyway because I liked Christian Slater.  The show turned out to be more character-driven than I would have guessed, but with enough action and intrigue to satisfy the show's target demographic.  Slater was solid as Edward Albright/Henry Spivey and watching his character(s) navigate their lives kept me interest throughout this short-;oved series. There are many reviews for this show so I won't add my own other than to say that NBC continued its streak of early cancellations before the show could develop a following (Life, My Own Worst Enemy and Kings, even Southland).

In closing, for $10 it's worth giving it a view.  The previous reviewers are correct in saying that since this show was cancelled there's really not an ending, but I still say the 9 episodes you get are worth ten bucks",1278892800,2,1074,4.873626373626373

Although the show was great, if you buy it, you'll be greatly disappointed to find, as many NBC series go, there was no ending to it. It is one that they left completely unanswered. Read the other reviews, it is very disappointing.

3764632,5,B001QE99BA,"Well, I guess it's my fault this show was cancelled.  Because I found it to be so daringly original and liked it so much.... Which nearly always seems to be the kiss of death for shows that have that impact on me, going back to Nowhere Man, Due South, Keene Eddie, and more recently The Black Donnellys.
I spose I'd be much happier if I could get into something less challenging, like Jerry Springer or those ""reality"" shows maybe.
But I just don't seem to have the right sensibilty.

Too bad, cuz in some ways it's a curse, really.

3764635,4,B001QE99BA,"I missed this when it aired.....the commercials just didn't appeal to me and made it look messy from a story standpoint. I found  it deeply discounted at my local record store as used and picked it up figuring I'd watch an episode a day with my workout.  The first episode (which I assume was the pilot) I felt was a complete mess...and too full of exposition for its brief 43 minutes we got what would have been much better fleshed out over a 2  hour airing. I just about gave up but watched the second episode and it started to slow down, develop some story and characters and make a small  amount of sense...but I believe in our society...that was too late. As the episodes evolve I  am enjoying the story arc but I think its  still a bit ""alias wannabee"" and there are just a couple of plot holes too large for my adult brain to get around.  Its fun and enjoyable but I can certainly understand why it would most likely have a HUGE budget and need big ratings to make that all worthwhile.

If you like Christian Slater (I'm  not  particularly a fan of mini-men  actors who play tough and imitate Jack Nicholson)...you will be pleased. If you want a less than brilliant action soap opera espionage show with high production values ....if purchased for 10 bucks its a good bit of fun.",1245888000,3,1286,4.406779661016949

We ended up watching the entire series in one sitting - last night.  I can't believe they canceled the show.  It was original in concept (to me) and characters engaging.

3764639,5,B001QE99BA,"Christian Slater has had a knack through his career of landing in too many so-so movies. It is nice to see at this stage of his career he turns in one of his best performances. The supporting cast is good with Mike O'Malley being especially interesting. The budget seems to be decent.

Like the somewhat similar British series Jekyll the most interesting aspect of the series is the conflict between two apparently separate people inhabiting the same body. Edward, the Bond-like spy, is ruthless, and Henry, the family man, has never handled a gun. They do not seem to care much for each other but as they only have one body they find they must work together to stay alive. Everything was fine until Henry, previously unaware of Edward, discovers Edward's existance in the first episode. That they now switch back and forth at any moment is the tale.

The last episode appeared to be working its way to a conclusion, but in the final two minutes they throw a curve. The show is good, worth watching on its own, but it would be nice to see a second season.",1240531200,15,1055,4.5473684210526315
