8513847,4,B0034PJWH0,"Brilliant. Funny. Scary. Farocki shows the blurred lines between professional training and mind-numbing indoctrination. There is no commentary, but the editing of the sequences creates a hypnotizing rhythm of very serious, yet absurd situations in which every human movement and interaction has been corrected to conform to a rational explanation. This film is a must for fans of observational documentaries and cinma vrit like the work of Frederic Wiseman or Ulrich Seidl. If you truly want to understand Kraftwerk's 1978 hit song ""The Robots,"" watch this documentary.

The Facets DVD is quite bare-bones (no extras), but the only one on the market with subtitles.",1437091200,,665,5.394230769230769
8513848,5,B0034PJWH0,"How to Live in the German Federal Republic is an essential political portrait of the process that went into every day life in 1980s Germany.  Similar to typical Forockian style, we observe training footage of women learning how to give birth, children getting tips on the proper way to cross a street and learning the exact way to act on an interview.  Farocki frees his footage of any intellectual banter and presents a raw and stripped down essay about the mechanicalized German public whom had little room to improvise in even the most fundamental aspects of their realities.

After viewing the film, I begin to question the process of my own realities.  How much control and influence are we really under and how are we to know this without an outer force documenting the everyday habits of our actions and the influences behind them.  After an impressive career of over 90 films and numerous installations Farocki continues to question our perception of reality in his newest installation piece Serious Games I-IV at MoMA until January 2nd, 2012.",1317686400,3,1051,4.915254237288136
