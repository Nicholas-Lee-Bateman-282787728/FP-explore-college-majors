7855697,5,630392011X,Got the tape in good condition and it played well on my vcr. Enjoyed the workout very much and will do it again.,1369872000,2,112,3.9130434782608696
7855698,5,630392011X,"This is one of my favorite workouts, a shame this is not on dvd. It takes place on a beach in beautiful Jamacia. There are basic easy to follow moves to songs like ""that's the way I like it"" by Dino. There is a warm-up. Buttocks exercises are done standing, basic leg lifts while laying on your side and abdominal exercises in the form of crunches. The music is motivating, and time really flies! This workout works and it is not strenuous. It targets all the areas that really need toning. I really recommend this, especially for people who enjoy the 1980s to early 1990s style workouts, like I do.",1331769600,7,599,4.454545454545454
