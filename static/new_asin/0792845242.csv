156698,3,0792845242,"I really like this movie.  Yes, I know it's a warm&fuzzy film but it also makes me laugh.  I loved the short bits of artography between the  scenes.  And though I did feel that VS Brodie could have really worked on  her lines a bit more, and the sound occasionally left something to be  desired - all in all, it is a fun movie that I love to watch often.
My  one question is...what is the name of the song at the VERY end of the  movie?  When Max & Eli are walking on the rocks?  Who is the artist?  Unfortunately, the credits do not reflect this song at all. Anyone out  there have any ideas?

From start to end, this book is engaging.  It's  characters are real and recognisable.  The dialogue is natural and honest  and the storyline is magnificent.  Anyone who is currently breathing is  sure to relate to this funny and at times un-nervingly familiar world of  love, life and relationships.

I found it even more interesting that a group of lesbians was ready to burn the ""Daria"" character at the stake for sleeping with an actual man.  I agree with some reviewers' criticism that some of the acting was stilted and felt as though the actresses were just reciting their lines.  I agree with other reviewers' remarks, however, that the storyline itself is worth watching.  The story was about finding love, and I felt that the movie achieved that goal.

156829,5,0792845242,"This film is a lesbian classic; if you're not a lesbian/bi woman you won't get it.  Made for about $50 by a bunch of mates who wrote the script, acted all the parts, constructed the sets, filmed themselves and probably made their own tea.  If it feels a bit wooden at times it's because they're just a bunch of women, not all professionals, acting out scenarios from their own lives and those of their friends.  It's a lovely, warm girl-meets-girl story.  The gorgeous Guin Turner is the more worldly one, who does the seducing (the scene where she cuts her girlfriend's fingernails as foreplay is brilliant), and she meets Eli who isn't what she expected her g/f to look like, and they fall in love. There are lots of funny little vignettes and the story wanders about in a pleasantly aimless fashion - like having a really good natter with a really old mate.",1377129600,3,860,4.564935064935065

156831,5,0792845242,"I always go back to this movie.  Until I just ordered a new dvd Ive been watching the same old vhs that is just starting to whistle and jump at the end. lol vhs lasted... This movie isn't for everyone.  Ill say that upfront.  Its shot completely in black and white and is very much independant. The sexy picture on the cover is not a scene from the movie.  The woman on the cover is the lovely Guin Turner but in this movie she plays a tomboy in her early twenties.
Its sketchy, with images thrown between scenes. Its narrated by guin turner through a bit of it but her being a writer its a real treat. The women in the film aren't perfectly shaped or made up. Some are thick, some skinny, some are flat chested but best yet they are more real than anything youll find in hollywood gay films. The potrayal of the gay community is pretty dead on. Its not a drama or a comedy.  Its got a little bit of both.  Again, its very indie.  If you like the film id suggest following it with ""the watermellon woman"".

okay onto the plot. young max west is in a rut and she tends to judge women on their looks and is pretty much on the lookout for ""hip hop barbie"" (as one main characters puts it), she lives with friends and they have decided with other friends to match her up with the seamingly ugly duckling ""ely"" whos got a heart of gold and no fashion sense.  Ely is in a dead relationship and max has a big mouth (sorry lol she does and its always getting her into trouble).  Anyway, they are on a full scale mission through a game they have called ""Go Fish"" to set the two up.  Its a fun trip watching Max grow up and find the beauty in Ely and Ely to learn to allow herself to be happy. Its predictable in that sense but its the ride there thats the movie.
Go Fish is a lesbian cult classic.  I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn't embraced by most of the younger lgbt viewers.  It was made when you really had to hunt for gay movies.  To me yes it's always been one of the most honest ones.",1335744000,,1986,4.085051546391752

156838,3,0792845242,"I watched this movie after turning off The Ninth Gate. Compared with Polanski's plodding film, I found this refreshing, invigorating. There are visual effects reminiscent of Godard, Bergman, Cassavetes, Warhol. Very interesting. Some parts were lame, such as the gathering of female heads to discuss the prospects of the relationship between Eli and Max, but other scenes made up for this.

In one scene the talking heads are discussing what to call the female genitals, and no one says the ""p"" word. That surprised me.

The movie did seem a bit sanitized, like Spike Lee's Do The Right Thing. No bitchiness, no cruelty, no stealing your friend's girlfriend... The goodhearted confrrie of lesbians was a little cloying.

Finally, I ordered this film from Netflix because I thought it was by a filmmaker who made a legendary lesbian film in 1974. But her filmography says she is much younger. I ordered the wrong ""Go Fish"" by the wrong filmmaker.",1247443200,,945,4.968354430379747

156848,4,0792845242,"Ok, I know that GO FISH has some bad acting.  I know that the lines are sometimes self conscious and try too hard.  And I understand that some people find the actors to be unattractive.  But here's the thing:  any movie made by dykes, for dykes, is a valuable part of our community, even ones that make us want to cry (in the bad way).  So it doesn't represent you and your friends.  Ok, well, maybe you haven't noticed that dykes are an extremely varied group of people, so shut up and make your own movie about your friends.  And then everyone can complain about how it isn't just like them.

Maybe I'm biased because GO FISH was the first lesbian made movie I ever saw in a movie theater.  Maybe I'm biased because the fashion in the film, horrible as it is, is EXACTLY the kind of clothing that my friends and I wore in the 90's.  But I kind of like this movie.  LIke it or not, a lot of dykes are really mostly interested in sex and dating and finding someone to love.  Is that so bad?  In my experience, straight people aren't all that different.  And film in the 90's was really into that ""let's just show people how they really are"" thing- remember Reality Bites?  No one gets all mad if straight people in straight movies talk and think about sex all of the time- why should dykes be any different?

Some of the things I really admire about this movie:  it deals honestly with the ""when are you a dyke, when are you bisexual"" question, it has more than one dyke character of color, it has a family situation where the parents aren't ok with their dyke daughter (that's called reality, not like Better than Chocolate), the women are all normal bodied, with stomach rolls and hairy legs, just like the women I know, it actually talks about safe sex (unheard of in dyke film- did you catch it, when Daria gives Ely a ziploc bag before her date?  uh huh), and, for that matter, the slutty character is the one who practices safe sex, a really valuable message for dykes.

So this movie will always remain one of my favorites.  To me, it absolutely marks a time and place in dyke history.  And as much as I hate to say it, apparently the 90's are now a part of dyke history....",1222992000,2,2181,4.296568627450981

156855,4,0792845242,"It's funny that a lot of people are claiming they were ""duped"" by the cover of this movie, thinking it was going to be about two hot straight-looking girls getting it on. That's exactly what I thought when I saw the cover, which is why I never rented the movie after years of seeing it in the video store. Then after seeing almost every lesbian film there is, I decided, finally, to watch Go Fish, and was shocked when I realized the main characters weren't straight-looking at all (accept for Turner, who seems a little akward playing a butch but tries to pull it off the best she can). I was surprised that I actually ended up liking this movie a lot better than a lot of other lesbian films I've seen, even though the acting is stale. But you have to bare in mind that the movie was extremely low-budget, didn't have any big-name backing, and was basically homemade. I was also a little shocked to find that this movie was made in the early 90s, revolutionary for it's time. As for the comments people have made about the attractiveness of the actors, grow up. The whole point of the film is that looks aren't everything, and yes, in real life, we do sometimes fall in love with people who are, godforbid, unattractive. And you'd think that in the 21st Century people, especially within the lesbian community, wouldn't be as misogynistic as to say ""we only want to see hot girls making out."" As far as the ""duping"" cover of this film, I think it's sad the producers had to use it to trick people into buying it, since so many people are too shallow to see past the fact that the characters in this film, except for Turner, aren't beautiful, and that's the whole point, by the way. It's also ironic that so many people who posted hear are saying ""Go Fish"" sucks, rent the ""L Word"" instead, when the writers and directors of ""Go Fish"" are two of the ""L Word's"" creators (Troche and Turner). The story line is a bit immature but fun, and the film brings up a lot of important issues about gender and sexuality and includes people from all different races and backgrounds (another rarity, even in lesbian films).

The reviews I've seen for this movie are way too generous I must say.  Believe me when I say that I am not a strict critic...I can be easily entertained by the corny ones.  But this one could not be salvaged, and one star is much more than it deserves.  The fact that is in black and white can be overlooked, but the bad acting, and pseudo-artistic scenes reminded me of a film made in middle school.

At the center, yes, this film is a traditional love story, yet it is so much more.  This film depicts gender, identity, and the confusion we experiece in dealing with these personal issues.  The black and white film approach emphasizes the restrictiveness of people in accepting difference.

156858,5,0792845242,"This fim's real and artistic look at the lesbian dating scene in the big city was excellent. The film was so original with the poetry and related fantasies. When she talks about ending up with a man and how one could be waiting for her, i found it to be hauntingly real. I believe it's like that for most women and men who are gay. If they don't ever decide to come out they may end up in a bad marrige and that's what she was talking about. It's a true factor all of us have to take into consideration. Will we live a lie?, get forced into a relationship we don't want? or face up to our parents or to our friends. The decision is up to all of us and once you except who you are gay or straight or bi, you will be successful.",1130198400,2,726,3.945578231292517

The reality? The movie is definitely not as bad as the reviews make it out to be. The acting is ok, except for Guin Turner, who really does seem like she's reading off cue cards. The storyline is amazing, and the girls seem like real lesbians, versus Hollywood's idea of what a lesbian is supposed to look like (i.e., blonde, thin, femme). There is such a variety of lesbians here: black, Spanish, white, butch, femme, and in-between. The black and white gives it a nice artistic quality.

156860,1,0792845242,"I predicted in 1994 that this cinematic flash-in-the-pan wouldn't stand the test of time. It was all the rage in 1994 and I still can't honestly tell why. With its painful --- and I mean painful --- bad acting and its relentless attempts to be hip and trendy, it seems to be little more than someone's ""artsy"" home movie.

I agree with the reviewer who finds it depressing to see lesbians frequently portrayed as unattractive, self-obsessed, women-children.... That was big in the 1990s but I think it's changing. (In fairness to the film, I can also appreciate that GO FISH was attempting to portray a segment of society not air-brushed and blown dry.)

What makes this film ultimately fail, in my opinion, (aside from the acting) is that its story takes place in the vacuum of the 1990s young, urban lesbian ghetto. Almost all of the characters' issues, views and attitudes too narrowly reflect this tiny, specific demographic.

There are a few crossover fans out there, but I can't imagine too many Midwestern, middle-aged and/or rural lesbians will find much to which they can relate. As a lesbian friend of mine said at the time this film came out: ""Why would I want to go see some grainy, black & white film about a bunch of lesbians whose lives don't remotely resemble my own?""

The normal answer to that question, of course, is: because it's an interesting story with compelling characters. However, in the case of GO FISH, neither applies. There's not much of a story and frankly, you could probably get your junior-high school niece and her friends to do a better job acting it.

Watching this film is like seeing someone's 10 year-old home movies --- bad cinema, bad entertainment.",1127174400,7,1692,4.780821917808219

156862,1,0792845242,"This may be the first time you hear me say this, but Go Fish was too artistic and dated for my enjoyment.  I think that if I had seen this film when it was first released back in 1994 I would have been impressed.  This was a very avant-garde film that tried very hard to discuss an issue that was very ""hush-hush"" back in the early 90s.  Lesbians were very closeted back then and were not a major part of the culture norm as they are today (well, as much as we recognize them today).  This makes for a very provocative film, but it also makes for a very dated film.  This was my biggest issue with this film was that it nearly felt like a comedy instead of this symbolic struggle to pursue happiness like any heterosexual relationship.  I realize that director Rose Troche was trying to show us that a lesbian relationship is no different than a male and female relationship and even lesbians talk like men talk about women, but somehow it just felt very dated and clich for me.  It didn't open more doors in my mind to the lifestyle of lesbians, but instead gave me this dated image of this butch lesbian that is rebelling against something instead of embracing the true lifestyle.

The black and white photography, while symbolically trying to show the black and white of the situation and relationship, just felt like an art film.  This was an art film, so what am I griping about?  I guess I just didn't want to see an art film with this topic.  I wanted to see something along the lines of Kids or even a documentary, not something where the uneducated will laugh at and ridicule even harder.  I wanted a film that was going to punch me in the face, not build upon dated/old clichs that instead poked my mind randomly and not very hard.  It was unimpressive.  It wasn't bold filmmaking, but instead just this random, average production about a lesbian love story.  Was it to be educational?  I think there were elements that could have been explored greater and into detail to cross that education/lifestyle acceptance line.  The scene dealing with bisexuality is the first that comes to mind.  This probably sounded great on paper, but when it was actually filmed out, it seemed high schoolish and bland.  The inner voices were not struggling with the character, but instead causing confusion and chaos that will never be resolved.  Another scene that could have played out just a bit better was the dinner scene where a group of lesbians have gathered for a party.  There could have been more discussed between the lesbians like lifestyle, issues, and current problems (that would help with the dated feel) instead of just sex, sex, and more sex.

That was a huge downfall for me was the constant reminder that all these women wanted was to have sex.  There were times when I was watching this film where I felt a bit of sweetness in my mouth because I thought there was some candy-coating happening.  This does not need to happen in a film that is supposed to bring the lesbian lifestyle closer into the spotlight.  I never felt that these women in this film were given the best light to show their stuff anyway.  From the beginning of the first scene until the last (and all those snippets in-between) all they could talk about was sex.  They wanted to have sex more often than I honestly think about in a day.  It really made the rest of the non-existent themes seem blurry and unimportant.  There was just a consistent lack of togetherness for this film that ultimately hurt it in the long run.  This wasn't a film about women's rights, but instead a dire attempt to show the similarities between homosexual and heterosexual relationships.  I agree that this happened, but just not very coherently.  There seemed to be other elements strewn together in a very loose fashion that took away from the overall power of the film.  Don't get me wrong, this could have been a very powerful film about a lifestyle that this world is still not accepting, but instead it went too far to the left (which isn't bad, except in this case) and chose to go the bleeding artist route instead of the informative, here are the facts route.  The black and white photography, the lack of character development (who really was Ely's partner?), and the cheesy moments between scenes where women talked to me about the illusive ""honey pot"".  It just wasn't coming together well for me and eventually fell apart all together.

Overall, I was not impressed.  There are greater films out there that express the power of the relationship and do not create this unimpressive ""raw"" sensation by trying to shock the audiences.  One of my favorites is the film Big Eden which accepts homosexuality like it is commonplace in society.  If Go Fish would have been done in a similar style, I think I could have walked away from the film with a better taste in my mouth.  Instead, I am stuck with an unimpressive story that did nothing except joke about why lesbian women like to play the game ""Go Fish"".  Ha ha ha h....it just isn't working for me.  I do not recommend this film in the least bit.  There was one, singular scene that made me chuckle and for the likes of me I cannot remember why.  It was an unmemorable feast of bad cinema.  Skip it.

156863,3,0792845242,"To my mind, independent lesbian films almost usually fall into one of two categories: the coming-out story (which is, of course, going to be relevant to almost all of the intended audience), and the somewhat harsher look at the social, political, and familial ramifications of being a gay woman (definitely relevant). ""Go Fish"" eschews both of these traditions, while still occasionally playing them tribute.

It looks like an independent film, and it feels like an independent film, but it's smarter than it first appears. The script is very quick, balancing what is really a romantic comedy with darker, more substantial undertones, including some of the ""what does it mean to be a lesbian?"" questions I alluded to above. It functions almost like a classic Greek play, with the very best moments being played as an aside to the action, through the conceit of the chorus (which I kept thinking of as the ""lesbian brains trust""). This would probably be a great stage play, and credit must go to Rose Troche and Guinevere Turner for making something so fresh out of very traditional roots.

Unfortunately, the acting just about kills ""Go Fish"" before it even gets out of the gate. With the possible exception of Anastasia Sharp as Daria, only Guinevere Turner seems capable of moving and speaking her lines in a natural, comfortable fashion. Most of the actors seem so stilted, delivering very normal, day-in-the-life dialogue in clipped, nervous tones that are conscious of being watched by a camera. I understand the director probably wanted to save money - indeed, may even have wanted a real-life feel to her work - but I can't think of anything more detrimental to a film like this. While I would probably enjoy sitting and reading the screenplay, I don't think I could watch the whole film again. The performances are just too irritating. Even characters I enjoyed - like T. Wendy McMillan's Kia - began to wear on my nerves by the second half, and that's a bad sign for a film that, without the credits, is barely 80 minutes long.

So, do I recommend you see ""Go Fish""? If you're interested in this type of film, then - yes. You should rent and see it once, for sure. It's still worthwhile viewing, but I wish I could give it a heartier recommendation; unfortunately, the only extra on the DVD is the original trailer, so the only reason you have to get the film is the film itself. Just try, if you can, to see the good ideas presented beneath the weak acting. They are about a hundred times more interesting than those in more watchable, slicker films of this sub-genre.",1109289600,2,2578,4.75

156865,5,0792845242,"Go Fish! was made at what I call the last years of truly indie film. It's rough, the dialogue can seem awkward at times, and it's a black & white film because Rose Troche couldn't afford to go in colour. All that said, it's one of the gems of my movie collection, and has been since it first came out on VHS. It was one of the first lesbian films to play with sexual identity in what we now call 'gender queer' terms. I see it as a bridge between lesbian identity built during the sex wars and a freer form sexulity, in which butch, femme, dyke, and so on, have less defined roles in lesbian society. From a historical perspective (Can I say that, even if the film's only 10 years old?), Go Fish! captures a society in conflict, on the cusp of a new order. And let's face it, who can hate a cast that includes an African American woman, a Latina, and a sub community in which race is nothing more than an element of one's being, not the entirety of that being? Some today may see it as a bit hokey, but when I first saw it in 1996, it rang as true as it still does to me!",1095638400,3,1071,4.032863849765258
156866,1,0792845242,"This film is just plain UGLY, in more ways than one! I rented this movie and I couldn't finish it~I made it about 1/2 through. This movie sounded good when I read the description; two women, one attractive and outgoing, the other shy and plain, find romance. Well the movie began and it was in a very unappealing black-and-white. So off the bat I was turned off. I have watched and liked other B&W stuff before~but for some reason I just couldn't stomach it this time~probably because it just looked so ugly in this movie. Well then I started to look for the main character, you know the attractive and outgoing one (and aren't the pretty ones always outgoing???)? Then I realize it's MAX! Yikes! I don't know about the outgoing part, but this woman looks like she hadn't hit puberty yet! She's wearing baggy pants, a baggy top, and a baseball cap~she looked like a young, immature boy! Attractive?! Not! But get this, Max was absolutely STUNNING to me once I laid eyes upon her would-be suitor I-forget-her-name!!! And that was in the beginning BEFORE she chopped off most of her hair into a mohawk cut! After that, this movie became TOTALLY unwatchable! That chick was one of the ugliest people I have ever seen. To just have her in a movie is one thing-but to pair her up? I had to hit ""EJECT"" on this one! That's one sex scene I DID NOT want to see! Don't get me wrong, I can't stand it that in most movies the actors are all so beautiful and perfect, but this movie is at the other extreme. Lesbians on the whole are not like the ones in this movie-pre-puberty looking and boyish, or extremely ugly. Those are the choices for the white characters anyway. But lesbians are also not like the ones on the L Word-stunningly beautiful. Lebians are simply regular women. Some are very pretty, others are plain. Just like all women.

Needness to say, she's not having an easy time, until her roommate, a more experienced woman, begins to take an interest in finding someone for the lonely girl.
This movie portrays lesbian life in a very accurate way.  The way the characters speak, dress and gesture all have a strong sense of reality.  At the same time, the conversations are frequently quite funny and insightful.  It's a wonderful and rare mix of humour and education, thanks to an extreamly well written script.
The only real weakness is the acting.  The entire movie feels as though the cast mearly read the script then went and filmed it as soon as they could stumble over the words.  However, the acting is at least consistant, which makes it easier to ignore, as opposed to inconsistantly played characters.

  I think the people that dislike this movie, perhaps feel a kinship to the negative ideals that this film tries to dispel.  Nothing like being outed.

The main purpose of the movie, which seemed to be to get these two women together just wasn't very interesting, or compelling enough to draw the rest of the movie together.
 I realize this movie was probably made on a small budget so I'm trying not to critisize the acting too much, although there was definitely some rather poor acting in this movie, along with bad camera shots and audio recording.  I found myself laughing during some scenes, but the problem is, I don't think those scenes were supposed to be funny, it was just my reaction to some of the rather lame scenes that I was watching.
 I guess if you are into art house films, you might want to give this movie a try, but I don't think it's really worth your time.  If you want to see a better film, I'd recommend ""The Incredibly True Adventure Of 2 Girls In Love"" instead.  It was a much better picture.",977616000,,1609,4.442176870748299

But every time I go somewhere where there are a lot of lesbians, they ask me, why am I there. You see, I don't look like an official lesbian. It is like you have to go down on them to prove you are a lesbian. I hope one day I meet a lesbian that doesn't care that I like ear rings that are 3 inches long and have shoes galore that match every outfit and have sea foam colored pants and also other pants of every hue imagine.",1504915200,,569,3.7899159663865545
