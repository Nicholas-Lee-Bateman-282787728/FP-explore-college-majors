I gave it 5 stars because I simply fell in love with Elizabeth Harnois (who plays the President's daughter).

1081637,5,6305791953,"Disney - the genius of family entertainment, guaranteed to please the entire family!
Will Friedle is a wonderful actor, that I've enjoyed watching in Boy Meets World, and am pleased to find him in several movies now.  My daughters were actually a little young for this one (ages 4 and 5), but they liked the action scenes that involving the car theft and the pool hall scenes.  However, I loved this movie and I think in a couple more years, they will find it more interesting to sit through.  So this one is better for children about 8 years and up.
The scene where Will is looking for his date's home... then realizes it's the White House... well, that's just hilarious!  Excellent, must see Disney movie!",1026345600,3,707,4.587301587301587

But when Duncan pulls up to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and realizes it's the White House, he thinks she's played a trick on him. To his surprise, he's ushered into the Oval Office to meet Hallie's father -- the President of the United States (Dabney Coleman, ""Inspector Gadget,"" ""You've Got Mail""). Soon Hallie and Duncan leave on their date -- accompanied by two Secret Service agents. Excited about her freedom, Hallie wants to cram everything she's ever wanted to do into this one night. They ditch the agents, but just as their fun begins, Duncan's car is stolen, they're chased by bikers, and the President is mistakenly arrested while out looking for her!
One of the wildest comedy adventures this side of the Potomac, ""My Date with the President's Daughter"" is one date you won't want to miss!

7895845,5,6305791953,"So glad to find this charming and quirky film.  My copy is missing and was probably damaged.  It would be nice to have all of these older films be put on dvds but that's okay.  Will Friedle plays the young man who ends up getting a date with the president's daughter, having no idea she is.  His dad voted for the OTHER guy.  She just wants out of the White House.  What follows is an unbelievable but funny run from bumbling Secret Service Agents to try to get to a school dance.  A film to watch over and over again, for the old and young.",1481155200,2,541,4.095238095238095
7895846,5,6305791953,"Pfft, who needs Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright when you have Disney Channel navet and old-school 90s Full House camp? This stunning, Oscar-worthy film will prove once and for all that both Aaron Sorkin and Beau Willimon are full of crap and don't know how to write proper political dramas with plotlines that aren't even HALF as good as the one in this puppy.

It's entertaining. It's like five bucks. Buy it.",1436054400,,408,4.666666666666667
