4384770,2,B004I9SJG6,"When American moviemakers are looking for convincingly masculine and rugged leads, they are increasingly going outside the country to find them: 3:10 To Yuma, two Aussies; Thor; another one; Superman, a Brit (a Brit!); The 300, a Scot, etc.  American actors are just too soft, too boyish. Eg Bradley Cooper: handsome, but a city boy and a lady's man. Couldn't play threatening if his life depended on it*. So, why is one of the few classic American manly men left in films stuck in this typically head-shaking SyFy clunker? The magnificent Ed Quinn. I hope they paid you well, buddy. I hope they paid you well.

Most SyFy flix have the obligatory Phallic Female, who asserts her testicular dominance by being a b**ch and insulting and humiliating the inept beta-males who drool over her. There's a bit of that here, but the females are also resistant and hysterical, as well, then helpless and inept. Such depth of character. When The Cigarette Smoking Man from X-Files --played here as a misunderstood old guy-- is trapped with ""Zoe"", who is stupid, self-absorbed, fearful, uncooperative and a basically dead-weight teenager, I just wanted him to backhand her so bad...

In the end, it's all my fault for watching this. But Mr Quinn was there, so...

*Update in April 2015. I was wrong about Bradley Cooper. He was convincingly lethal as can be in ""American Sniper.""",1361059200,,1367,4.879310344827586

Many are quite enjoyable if you don't take them seriously.  Behemoth stands squarely on the trash side of the scale.

I will admit that on a lot of levels this one is a stinker.  Maybe that's why I really liked it.  Someone has to; it's like the ugly puppy no one wants.  It's daffy, it's dopey, the hero is a logger for pity sake!  Who just happens to know how to use the SECRET weapon that was lying around the forest!
I'm a sucker for monsters.  I like them grumpy and I like them big and this one's bigger than a mountain...or was the mountain...or something like that.  Anyway, it's a Mayan Monster (like that explained anything!)  I thought it was a hoot.  It even starred William B.

4384776,4,B004I9SJG6,"""Behemoth"" was originally released on Syfy in January 15, 2011. I'm surprised it's available on dvd already.

THE PLOT: In the Great Northwest the Walsh family's patriarch seems to be going crazy with his blathering on mythical prophecies about some colossal beast awakening and creating havoc. Meanwhile there are ominous geological signs that something earth-shattering may be occurring. The local authorities finally take heed and give the word to evacuate. The problem is the beautiful Walsh daughter is camping with her fianc&eacute; on the mountain, which is the focal point of the catastrophe. Her older brother and a scientist girlfriend go to the mountain to save her. There's also a government agent investigating things. All hell breaks loose literally.

""Behemoth"" combines the plot of ""Dante's Peak"" with countless monster-in-the-woods flicks, so this may not be the most original film out there but it's well done for what it is. Where it scores high marks for originality is the cause of the disaster, the behemoth itself. Most monster-in-the-woods flicks feature creatures about the size of Bigfoot, e.g. the many ""Sasquatch"" flicks, ""Goblin"", ""Man-Thing"", ""It Waits"", ""Carny"", ""Prophecy"" ('79), ""Gargoyles"", etc. Not so here. The creature in ""Behemoth"" is indeed a behemoth -- so huge, in fact, that it literally sleeps/lives inside a mountain!

Some have complained about the appearance of the monster as goofy and badly done. I don't get this. I think it's pretty cool looking -- a multitude of tentacles, malevolent head, gaping maw. What do you expect for low-budget CGI? I think it's better than any creature in the ridiculously expensive cartoon ""Avatar"" (no offense to ""Avatar"" fans, my wife loved it, it's just not my cup of tea).

""Behemoth"" was shot in Squamish, BC. Although this is a dreary area (cloudy with lots of rain) it's exceptionally scenic!

The likable cast is a plus, particularly the Walsh family, but the ages are off. Ed Quinn as the main protagonist, Tom, is old enough to be Cindy Busby's father. Cindy plays Grace and is said to be 20 whereas Quinn is 42. The Walsh father is played by William Davis who's past 70. He should've played the grandfather and Quinn the father. Oh well, no big deal.

Like I said the cast is very likable and I like their closeness and love for each other. It's nice to have a group of people you can root for.

Another plus is the women. Cindy is gorgeous to say the least. If you don't know who she is imagine Lindsay Lohan if she were prettier, healthier and had better curves (instead of resembling a stick). The scientist, Emily, played by Pascale Hutton is also good. And then there's the girl-next-door, Zoe, played by Jessica Parker Kennedy, an obvious acquired taste.

Some have complained that the ladies scream in terror too much rather than doing something useful, but one of the main protagonists is the geologist Emily, who pretty much keeps her head at all times, so that blows that contention. Yes, Grace & Zoe scream a lot but a freakin' mountain is coming alive and destroying everything & everyone around them, including their loved ones. I think it's a fitting occasion to scream, don't ya think? Besides, screaming babes is a horror tradition.

Some complain about the slow build-up but this is par for the course for disaster/monster flicks, e.g. ""Dante's Peak"", ""Alien"", ""Prophecy"", ""Jaws"", ""Man-Thing,"" etc. Giving away the creature or crisis too early spoils the mounting crisis. Besides, the film only runs 90 minutes and so the build-up merely involves the first hour. Plus the creature is fully shown in the last act.

BOTTOM LINE: Don't listen to the grumps, ""Behemoth"" is a worthy low-budget TV creature feature. It has all the staples you'd want for a disaster/monster-in-the-woods flick, including a likable cast, gorgeous women, spectacular locations and an original monster.

4384778,2,B004I9SJG6,"Strange seismic activity, and gas emissions around a mountain, become a cause for concern, in the Sy Fy original movie Behemoth (2011), a goofball science fantasy, featuring a weird mythological creature that rises from beneath the ground.  While not particularly well written or acted, it is at least fairly watchable, with some campy special effects and low thrills action scenes.

After a government scientific team is wiped out while investigating activity at Mount Lincoln, agent Jack Murray (Ty Olsen) is sent to check into what happened.  Also investigating the situation is Emily (Pascale Hutton), a scientist who returns home to the nearby town of Ascension, where her old boyfriend Thomas Walsh (Ed Quinn) a logger, is recruited by Murray to act as a guide.

Thomas's sister Grace (Cindy Busby) and her boyfriend Jerrod (James Kirk) have gone up the mountain for a weekend of camping, and find themselves in danger as the seismic activity increases.  Walsh's father, professor William Walsh (William B. Davis, the cigarette smoking man from the X Files) is a strange fellow who often speaks about ancient myths and legends.  He is at the town's diner, when it sinks into the ground, and is trapped there with Zoe (Jessica Parker Kennedy), a waitress, as the Behemoth makes its way to Mount Lincoln.

The acting is passable, and with a couple of exceptions, the characters mostly escape being annoying, bumbling halfwits, although as excitement reaches an apex, the level of intelligence does dip a bit.  It's understandable, as facing a gigantic creature with multiple appendages, perched on a mountain top, tends to have that kind of effect on people.  The special effects are not too bad for a B-grade film.  The monster isn't seen much, but it's ugly and looks rather menacing.  It's origin remains a mystery.  Some of the action scenes are rather uninspiring, particularly Professor Walsh struggling to climb up a ladder.  Thomas fires a bazooka-like weapon at the creature, where the projectile magically transforms into a missile with multiple warheads.  Those trapped on the mountain then escape via a conveniently available helicopter.

Playing like a sappy fairy tale, Behemoth is lightly funny entertainment, with a low level of thrills.  While it might be suitable fare for families with teens, it probably won't do much for most science fiction fans.  As a recent production, it can probably be found on the Sy Fy Channel.",1299283200,,2444,5.100502512562814
4384779,4,B004I9SJG6,"Behemoth is everything I expect out of a B-movie... well, except for the gratuitous naked chicks and the f-bombs. In this case, the icky bug is a beastie that has been awakened to wreak havoc on the world for polluting too much. Like what has happened at least twice in the past, according to the hero's father, otherwise known as William B. Davis, or Cancer Man from the X-Files. Love that guy! I'm glad to see he is still around. He plays a great slightly off-kilter father figure.

Quinn, the hero, used to be on Eureka, but quit the series a while back. He does a good job as the mountain guide who takes the government agent up the mountain to look for the team that already knows about the monster and actually has a weapon to stop it. Huh? One of many big plot holes, but I don't watch these movies to quibble over details like that. I want to see conflict and body count! In this case, though, there aren't really very many victims, or there don't seem to be. Maybe I was just distracted by the spectacular Canadian scenery. Aww, who cares?

The monster, when it finally appears, is pretty hokey CGI. Let's just say they didn't go all out on that one, but that adds to the charm. What probably would have made it a bit better would have been a bit of string here and there, holding up the octopus-like arms.

This is my kind of icky bug. If you are looking for realism or art, you are barking up the wrong tree. If, however, you are just looking for a good time, I highly recommend this movie.",1295308800,13,1501,4.296819787985866

They usually contain one recognizable name either someone who usually does ""B"" movies or someone whose career is no longer going so well.
