The longest segment addresses the issue of Hitler's Secret Weapons, a term which sounds more fascinating than it really is.  The V-2 rocket, which did rain down on Britain to some degree in the final year of the war, is no great secret.  The real mystery in this case hinges on Hitler's prioritization of the rocket program above all other military projects.  The pouring of money into V-2 production robbed other military projects of good standing and proven effectiveness from turning the tides of war back in the Third Reich's favor in the wake of the crippling Russian campaign and tide-turning landing of the Allies at Normandy.  After all, these complex and quite expensive rockets never carried anything more powerful than standard conventional warheads.  The possibility of Germany delivering weapons of mass destruction via the V-2 is raised but stands only as a topic of conjecture.
The Enigma of the Swastika is a very good short history of the swastika.  The symbol has existed since long before Adolph Hitler adopted it for the symbol of the Nazi party, and this video does a commendable job of showing its evolution over time.  Adopted by Madame Blavatsky for her Theosophist society in the late 19th century, the symbol actually was not uncommonly used throughout Europe in the early years of the 20th century.  Its evolution was further spawned by occult groups such as the Thule Society, the symbol appearing quite frequently among the German troops in the First World War.  At the hands of the influential German occultist Guido Von List, it came to represent the mythological Aryan race and was thus naturally adopted by Adolf Hitler as the symbol of the Third Reich.  The final segment, Himmler's Castle, raises some fascinating questions but comes across as highly speculative.  Few people may be aware of the immense castle Himmler had reconstructed to serve as an almost sacred site of his SS ""religion.""  The video basically just formulates questions as to possible secret occult rites performed in its dark interior and offers speculations as to Himmler's secret thoughts and plans that don't seem to be easily justified by a paucity of evidence.  The segment ends quite abruptly after informing the viewer that the contents of Himmler's very secret safe disappeared with the American servicemen who discovered and opened it, leaving one quite frustrated at the thought that we will probably never know what secrets of the Third Reich's most dangerous and evil personality will forever remain unknown to us.
Overall, the content of this video is quite good and highly informative, if sometimes overly speculative.  However, the sound quality, on my copy at least, is quite bad.  The narrator's words are never clear and sometimes, when there is background noise or music accompanying it, very hard to make out clearly.  The audio is not bad enough to be unintelligible, but it is certainly of a low enough quality to be very annoying and frustrating to the viewer.",1048723200,,3090,5.039292730844794

Even though the photography is not that good, the movie tells us about the advancement in technology of Germany in the 3rd reich. Its quiet astonishing.
All in all, it's a good effort.",1007251200,4,352,4.786885245901639
