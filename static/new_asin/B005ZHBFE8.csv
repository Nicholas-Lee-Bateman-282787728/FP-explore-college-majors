8489663,5,B005ZHBFE8,"The Ian Whitcomb of 1976 and the Ian of today, looking back in the commentary version on the DVD, are both wonderful observers of the absurdity of life in L.A. for the British expatriate community.  And what a life it was during the U.S.'s Bicentennial year!  Thrill to exterior scenes of Dodger Darts and Schwinn Varsities, and interior scenes with things like Princess phones.  And the clothes!
