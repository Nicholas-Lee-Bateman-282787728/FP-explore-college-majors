4217064,5,B003XKQ61Q,"Do you entertain guests at your house with your entertainment room?

If you have a big screen, and I mean a big screen like 60+ inches or a projector, this is mandatory. The run time is about an hour. Not a whole lot of dialog. But my gosh, it will blow you & your guests away! The fly-over at such close range to the objects in focus is nothing less than mind blowing with the hi-def 1080 resolution.

This is a excellent choice as an additional bill for an entertaining evening double feature. No matter how old or young your guests. It's not to long, visually mesmerizing, and because the dialog is selective and limited it allows your guests to chat and ""ooh & ahh"" about how spectacular, pristine, and almost dizzying the experience is. When people watch this on a projector system, they won't shut up. Seriously. They will be riveted and add their own dialog to the spectacular experience you're putting your guests through.

Again...this is my #1 feature to play for an evening double-bill movie night with guests. #1! My guests always want to see it again and again.

Buy this. You won't be sorry.",1363219200,4,1105,4.565656565656566
4217065,4,B003XKQ61Q,"I was awestruck at the quality of the visuals, just stunning. The only flaw was that the "" Over America"" episode didn't show Florida, the Great Plains, the Dakotas region, and the northwest, and i think the New England region. Other than that,it's definitely worth buying. I don't regret the purchase.",1360281600,,301,4.921568627450981

4217067,4,B003XKQ61Q,The video itself I felt was very good in all areas of quality.  The video was a blessing.  The music was very loud and somewhat brash - guess they were trying to impart a feeling of excitement.  I would have much preferred relaxing music to go along with it.  The music was my only complaint.,1320624000,7,292,4.254545454545455
4217068,5,B003XKQ61Q,"I bought this video a couple years ago and every time that I watch it, I get amaze on how beautiful is this country. This is a well done video. I recommend it.",1298160000,,159,3.8484848484848486
4217069,4,B003XKQ61Q,The cinematography was great but the conversion to Blu-Ray was not there It was shot Pre-9/11 so I don't think the cameras were up to par for a conversion.,1297641600,6,155,4.379310344827586
4217070,1,B003XKQ61Q,"I had just asked for a full refund by e-mail on the basis of the poor resolution in this blu ray.

The resolution of this blu ray is worse than DVD and is totally unacceptable for blu ray.  All the screens flicker and are aching / hurting the eyes.  ""Dog teeths"" on all building edge, coastlines, rails, etc.  Even screens of crop fields view and building view flicker.

There are not much verbal narration.  Over 85% are background music.",1296950400,18,439,4.493670886075949
8408235,2,B003XKQ61Q,"This is not in 1080p.  It is upconverted from 1080i in places, but in some areas it looks like upscaled SD.

The image quality suffers due to major interlacing.  See the screenshot attached for an example. If you look at the tree tops or airplane, you can see the interlacing lines.

It does show amazing views of America, and will inspire you to go visit the National Parks.  However, if you want to show off your TV, it won't fit the bill.",1467936000,,441,4.329268292682927
8408236,5,B003XKQ61Q,Obviously shot pre 9/11 because it beautifully captured the grandeur of the Twin Towers shaping the Manhattan landscape. Spectacular aerial views of famous landmarks throughout the USA. Almost like taking a sight seeing tour in a single engine plane over the countryside. Would be interesting to see them do a sequel with the advances in camera and drone technology.,1464220800,,366,5.220338983050848

8408240,3,B003XKQ61Q,"Over America is a nice look at the U.S. from what appears to be airplane, helicopter and hot-air balloon view points.  I just wish it had more content and the production quality of Over California.",1440806400,,197,4.628571428571429
8408241,5,B003XKQ61Q,Nice remake in Blue Ray dvd from years ago done in VHS Hits the highlites only  lots of prominent places left out however other dvd's cover in mired detail certain states and regions overall very enjoyable birds eye view of our beautiful country,1423958400,,245,4.6976744186046515
8408242,5,B003XKQ61Q,Ordered this to watch on Thanksgiving. Thought it would be a nice way to appreciate our beautiful country and at the same time create a diversion for the usual group of TV addicts that disconnect and sit glued to the boob toob every holiday. This year we ALL sat together and watched something nice for awhile after stuffing our faces. It is so beautiful to watch that everyone was mesmerized. I highly recommend it. Even if you play it with the sound turned off as sort of a screen saver while you have company its nice.,1420761600,,521,4.4375
8408243,2,B003XKQ61Q,"I bought a copy of this  Blue-ray Over America for my mother a year ago and it was beautiful and the quality was B+. However, this copy was so grainy that I was disappointed it was like watching my 1965 television with lots of snow. I guess now that these copies are dubbed by splitting the signal so many times the quality is bad. I had to take my sharpness control on the TV down to -64 and the contrast to -55 and the brightness to -5 to be able to see the picture. This made the experience seem as if I was watching this video in 480i

Sad to see how poorly the copies of blue ray materials are getting.

Before I buy anymore Blue-rays I will check the quality via the internet.

Would not recommend the dvd but the seller was great. I received the dvd very quickly",1399507200,,769,4.1066666666666665
8408244,5,B003XKQ61Q,I loved the bluray I once saw on TV. The product really filled my expectations and tells how beautiful is USA.,1396224000,,110,4.285714285714286
