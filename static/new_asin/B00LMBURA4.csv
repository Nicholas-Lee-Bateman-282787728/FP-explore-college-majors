6491430,1,B00LMBURA4,Wow is this terrible. Was expecting real animation. The cover and disc art totally misrepresent these. It's comic book style panels that have been partially animated. Sound and voice acting is good. But was very disappointed with the set.  If you like comic book art stick with that. This collection was a Marvel over marketing joke.,1419552000,,333,4.946428571428571

6491434,1,B00LMBURA4,I give it one out of five stars because one out of these five discs is not available anywhere else except in this collection.  That klnd of cheap shoddy marketing is just plain rude to the people who have already bought the first four.,1415577600,,235,4.340909090909091
6491435,3,B00LMBURA4,marvel doulbe dipping all but on of these dvd's. I bought this just to get the sabretootn reborn disc was not released solo. It should have been a to disc set of wolvie vs sabretooth. if you didn't get the earlier released of these motion comics this is a great buy.,1414368000,5,266,4.235294117647059

6491457,5,B00LMBURA4,Different style of animation that was new to me kinda like an animated graphic novel. Cool storyline and material I've never seen before,1439856000,2,136,4.956521739130435
6491458,1,B00LMBURA4,Please do not buy this dvd.  The anamation is terrible.  I will never watch it again.,1434844800,3,85,4.25
6491459,3,B00LMBURA4,"Story wise, definitely worth it. However BE WARNED that if you're expecting legit animation/cartoon, you will be disappointed. These are ""motion comics."" Truthfully I would have much rather preferred that. Also, these ""movies"" are shot within 9-11 minute ""episodes."" So even when clicking ""play all,"" do not expect a smooth transition, there are opening and ending credits each time. Yes, opening and ending credits every 9-11 minutes. So if you can a.) deal with all the time wasting in between with the credits, and are ok with it being a motion comic / moving illustrations, then it's worth the money. If you are NOT OK with it not being an animated movie series, than DO NOT BUY this set.",1433203200,13,692,4.823529411764706
6491460,2,B00LMBURA4,"My fault but I thought this was an animated movie, not a motion comic.",1429574400,3,70,4.071428571428571
6491461,1,B00LMBURA4,"I actually got this at Walmart, but either way, I'm extremely dusatisfied. Firstly, there was no indication that these discs were all motion comics. The cover art and disc art were misleading. The music and voice acting were pretty good, except for Origin. Personally, I couldn't finish any of these. Secondly, why does this exist as it is? Why not put some money into this and fully animate it? Seriously, bad move, Marvel. I will be trashing these discs directly after writing this review. Waste of time, money and patience.",1429142400,3,526,4.855555555555555
6491462,5,B00LMBURA4,"Very easy to order and came very quickly. Also these were very good stories, but the drawings could be a little better.",1427932800,,119,4.454545454545454
6491463,5,B00LMBURA4,love it . excellent 5 stars across.,1427500800,,35,4.142857142857143
6491464,5,B00LMBURA4,Excellent. All the movies in one place. For little over the price of one of the movies.,1423267200,,87,4.176470588235294
6491465,3,B00LMBURA4,"Five stars for the stories, 1 star for the animation. My average 3 stars all together. The stories are very well told but the animation is that live comic book style animation sort of stop motion animation. It truly sucks. It's a real shame too, because the lack of solid animation ruins the stories. To make matters worse the stories are in 6 chapters each. And, each chapter has it's own opening and closing credits. This also ruins the flow of the story. Why not just make the story as a simple animated movie without the interruption of  credits every 10 to 12 minutes. They could still use chapter marks and not stop the flow of the story. But, no not these disks, they have to stop for each chapter every 10 to 12 minutes, then there are opening and closing credits which are identical to the credits before. I am sorry, but in my opinion, this set is not worth the time or the money, though I am an avid Marvel animation fan,  I will be selling this set on EBAY. What's even scarier,is that individually they get about $10 for each disc separately.

8666610,1,B00LMBURA4,"Buyer beware- this collection is NOT standard animation but cheesy stop motion digital manipulation of static images. Imagine the animation of Terry Gilliam from Monty Python, but put some lenses flares and color swaps together with a little digital tweaking and you'd be pretty close to what this animation style is. ALL the movies in this collection use that same style. Not worth it in my opinion.",1440460800,5,400,4.985074626865671
