Dustin Hoffman's performance as a man who has been forced into violence is excellent.  While his enemies use  rocks, rats, guns, knives,fire, and the encouragment + influence of alcohol  to kill him and his wife, Hoffman's character uses his wits to  defeat them  all. Peckinpah's use of the lonely, misty landscape and slow-motion  photography add to the films tension and power.  Very well done and highly  recommended.",939340800,4,535,5.2

280999,5,6300251217,"My two favorite Peckinpah movies are Straw Dogs and The Wild Bunch, though Ride The High Country is very close behind those other two.

Ultimately, I prefer Straw Dogs because it displays so much remarkable precision and intelligence. I admit, though, that the world view it presents is more depressing than The Wild Bunch. In The Wild Bunch, Peckinpah suggested that the violence has a cleansing effect. After the blazing shoot-out at the end, I felt that a catharsis had been achieved. Maybe a younger and better generation will rebuild on the battlefield of corpses--maybe.

Straw Dogs is darker, bleaker, and more claustrophobic. Violence and cruelty are a way of life and you just have to get past that sadness of lost innocence. Editing is top-notch. Jerry Fielding's music echoes Stravinsky's The Soldier's Tale and adds a proper dirge-like touch. Dustin Hoffman and Susan George excel in their roles.

Hoffman's farm is ultimately a microcosm for society at large. Violence and aggression abide beneath the bucolic calm of appearances everywhere. I agree that the rape scene is tough to watch, but it's not as bad as A Clockwork Orange. At least Peckinpah lets us see George's face and her range of emotions during the scene. Women in Kubrick's film are treated as objects. I think viewers should stop complaining about sexism in the film and praise Ms. George for tackling a very difficult role.

Having said all that, I will also say that Straw Dogs (like A Clockwork Orange) probably could not have been made in our time. In the 1970's, society had a long way to go in respecting women. I haven't seen the remake, but I'm guessing it was tepid and lame compared to Peckinpah's distinguished original.

The Criterion transfer is pristine, as we have all come to expect. If you know what to expect from Straw Dogs, you will not be disappointed with this release. Extras and special features are excellent.",1455408000,,1914,4.895061728395062

281055,1,6300251217,"After seeing my first Peckinpah film, The Wild Bunch, I thought ""Damn, great brave movie!"". After reading some reviews on youtube(watching a trailer for the movie first) and on amazon I thought I was in for a medium-fast past movie with the signature peckinpah bloody violence, like in The Wild Bunch. For anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet, this is a 1hr 55 min movie minus credits, so the first hour is setting everything up, with a soft R rated scene happening at the hour mark, now just over 30 mins later some small action happens....but its the last 15 mins of the whole near 2 hour movie that you see the somewhat violent climax. In that 15 min feature only a couple of bloody images..and the trap scene was more pg-13ish than R rated. Dustin Hoffman puts in a good, not great performance throughtout the movie, Susan Goerge plays his wife was just freaking annoying through most of the movie, her character was very disappointing and she didn't put up much of any fight in her assaulted scene. The back of the movie case described a disturbing decent in violence, very misleading to me! I'll finish with this, I expected soo much more from a greatly raved movie, but only saw a boring 1hr 55min movie with a couple of signature Peckinpah bloody scenes in the 20-15 min climax. I'll stick with The Wild Bunch.....Straw Dogs(1971) just disappointed me greatly.",1446768000,,1368,4.6570247933884295

Dustin Hoffman plays a ""spot on"" performance here, but he is matched in every way with the then new ingenue 19 year old Susan George who had an infinitely more difficult role to play.  In many ways I believe that it unleashed and gave permission to women to act out on their rough sex fantasies.

281197,4,6300251217,"It's easy to interpret this film as a ""shabby little shocker"" that appeals to the audience's most-depraved sensibilities. The audience anxiously awaits the final showdown with The Bad Guys, hoping they'll expire in brutally unpleasant ways -- and it's not disappointed. But -- dangerous though it is to try to read the mind of a deceased director -- I think Peckinpah's intentions were more than a simple gorefest.

Let's start with the casting. To view David Sumner as a coward is a mistake. Dustin Hoffman is a small, slender man. So we can't automatically accuse him of cowardice for feeling fearful when around large, nasty people.

Then there's his occupation, changed from English professor in the novel, to mathematician (specifically, one studying the structure of stars). Physics is largely a mathematical study, so David is a man involved with the most-fundamental principles of the universe. That's his job -- discovering principles.

His failing (if he has one), is the belief that human beings are sufficiently rational to respect the law. He respects it, in protecting a likely murderer from the people who want to kill him: ""This is my home. You have no right to do him harm."" There is no surprise /whatever/ when he moves to protect himself. He isn't a wussy intellectual finally discovering his manhood, but a principled human being standing up for what he's always believed in.

The villain of the piece is his wife. She's a tease, a slut, and a sniveling coward. Though the friction between David and the town would have existed anyhow, it is she who makes everything worse, indirectly provoking the final confrontation.

This is a film worth seeing and discussing -- assuming you have friends who actually discuss movies.",1408492800,,1741,5.010380622837371

281199,1,6300251217,"Saw ""Straw Dogs"" in the theater when it first came out.  At the time, I was among many who thought of Peckinpah as a major player in American film, and I am one of those who regard ""The Wild Bunch"" as one of the best westerns of all time.  I thought seeing ""Straw Dogs"" again via this unrated version DVD would improve my opinion of the film, but time has not been kind.  This is just one of those stories with no one to root for.  David (Dustin Hoffman) is a young mathematician who has recently moved to his wife's hometown in rural England to finish a book.  Amy (Susan George), the wife, has proudly returned home with her academic husband, which she believes significantly improves her social standing among those with whom she grew up.  Evidently, Amy ran with a pretty rough bunch, and there is much about them to which she can still relate.  ""You can take the girl out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the girl.""  Clearly, David didn't marry Amy for her intellect, but they do connect physically,  On the other hand, Amy's sexuality radiates to all males within a mile of her.  She may have kept it in check back in the States while David courted her, but now, back home, she is careless about it.  Furthermore, David may have been the coolest professor on campus back in the USA, but here, compared to her former boyfriend and his mates, she comes to see him as a cowardly wimp.  And, he is.  They probably have no business being married to each other, and the story arc of this film tests the marriage in the extreme.  But I still feel, even after my recent viewing, neither Amy nor David is a better person for all they have endured, and there is nothing implied in the script or in any shot the director composes to indicate these characters' feelings for each other have changed.  Regarding the performances, both Hoffman and George are nearly perfect.  If that is what drives you to watch this film, you won't be disappointed.",1404604800,3,1961,4.450980392156863

281283,3,6300251217,"One of the most violent films ever, director Peckinpah tried to tell a pagan tale about a wimpy man who is finally moved to violence against invaders when he realizes a primordial instinct to defend his home. As a violent, stomach-churning, nauseating (and this is a very unpleasant film to watch - not merely scary, but sickening)  roller coaster ride, this succeeds. As a film, it fails. What's wrong here? 1) The film is poorly paced. Poor editing could have helped here.  2) Dustin Hoffman is all wrong for the part of the wimpy husband. Yes, he's a nerdy little guy - but he never convinces when the transformation takes place and the character gets in touch with his primitive violent side. 3) Susan George is too beautiful to play the part of a nerdy mathematician's wife. She looks like a Playboy bunny - and like a woman who would have no interest sexually in mathematician/squirt of a man David Sumner, never mind marry him. 4) Some parts of the film make absolutely no sense. At the end of the film, Hoffman drives the mentally deranged Niles to his home?!! Niles just killed a girl and attempted to kill Hoffman's character's wife. Why is Hoffman not driving him to a police station? 5) The excuse for keeping a bear trap in the home is that the wife collects traps??!! Huh?? Give me a break. The only thing the wife collects is men.
There's a lot of excitement here - once the violence begins, it is not only relentless, it escalates to a fever pitch. But this may leave a sickening feeling in your gut - it did mine. If Peckinpah's intention was to show how man can be reduced to violence because it is still a part of his primitive nature and ready to be unleashed when needed, he confuses the issue with his almost voyeuristic portrayal of rape. Is this anthropology or torture porn? It would have been a better movie if it stuck to the former.",1398124800,2,1860,4.5

Without mentioning the obvious misogyny of Peckinpah. He seems to want to remind the ladies their duty to better defend their citadel rather than let it consensually be taken.

Perhaps the scenario would have been more accurate if it had been completely reversed ( boring household scenes would then have led to the departure with a young happy woman.) Be that as it may, past the fight to get it, almost nothing still justifies any interest for the scorned woman. Maybe yet some good paternalistic feelings or otherwise the insipid presence of a classmate a little teasing.",1393718400,,725,4.934426229508197

I am not saying I am a pervert that I wanted to see the rape in its full-length but that I paid for this movie because it was promised to buyers as being ""unrated and extended"". I am not sure what is ""extended"" here because this version is the same as the trimmed down versions I had seen in rental shops in America. How ironic that I saw the actual unrated version on VHS back in India a long time ago in the 80's (when there was no prudishness or censorship in America or elsewhere). You will be very disappointed with this version. The climax has also been ""moderated"" and you are not going to get any ""bloody Sam"" satisfaction from it. Disappointing and a bloody let down with an English accent!!",1384905600,6,1016,4.380952380952381
281290,2,6300251217,"Falsely sold to audiences as the story of one man's personal redemption, ""Straw Dogs"" is instead an extremely misogynistic and distasteful excuse for filling up two hours worth of screen time with blood, breasts, and brutality.  The advertising campaign for this film claimed that director Sam Peckinpah set out to tell the tale of a cowardly pacifist (Dustin Hoffman) who finally gets a burst of testosterone and becomes a ""man"" when his home is threatened.

Now that plot line might have made for an interesting and morally appealing film.  Instead, what Peckinpah has delivered is the tale of a man whose whole life is built around self-delusions: nothing about his world is as it seems.  The peaceful English town he lives in is actually a cesspool of violence and cruelty; his marriage is in reality a lie; his house is not the fortress he thinks it is.  And what is the main problem, the driving force behind all this dysfunction?  Well, women, of course.  His toothsome wife (Susan George) is actually a tramp who flashes her breasts at men she used to date and who are still trying to bed her.  When she gets raped, she says ""no"" at first, but soon enough, she starts enjoying it.  You know how women are (and yes, I'm being angrily sarcastic at Peckinpah's unconscionable use of that old cliche).  Naturally, she keeps this information from her husband.  And one of the young girls in the village?  Since Hoffman won't respond to her sexual advances, she instead approaches a simpleton who has a reputation for molesting young women, and tries to seduce him, which leads her father and his drunken friends to go on a murderous rampage when they can't find her.  (Naturally, this being a completely nihilistic film, we know she's dead, even though none of the characters in the film know it.)

The whole mess ends in the handful of drunken village men assaulting Hoffman's Home Sweet Home as if the Frankenstein monster were hiding inside.  And Hoffman takes on the invaders and, well ... far be it from me to tell you whether or not he survives ... I'd hate to ruin the ""suspense"".  Let's just say that it all fades out with what is supposed to be an ironically symbolic exchange between two characters that comes off as unbearably trite and corny.

Two stars is being charitable.  The blu-ray is a 20th Century-Fox release of an MGM film, adequately presented, and the only extras are the theatrical trailer and 3 TV spots.  Study them as an example of how an audience can be manipulated and misled.  Overall, not recommended.",1384646400,,2536,4.733485193621868

281359,5,6300251217,"Recently this movie has been remade taking place in the American south.  However, it does not compare to this original version with Dustin Hoffman playing the leading role.  The movie is a wonderful example of how people from an outside country are abused by xenophobic Irishmen who not only abuse the newcomers, but make every outright effort to kill them.  Yet, by using his tremendous mental abilities, Hoffman prevails and injures or kills all his attackers, ultimately saving his life and the life of his beautiful wife who had been raped and beaten by the natives who resent their presence.

The movie is a wonderful example of how natives often abuse and terrify outsiders.  Yet, how in some cases, those outsiders have special talents that allow them to prevail and overcome.  It is highly recommended to viewers with the ability to handle significant violence and bloodshed, but such violence depicted beautifully and righteously in all its glory.",1379116800,4,956,5.057324840764331

The ultimate film about never judging a book by its cover or what man is capable of when he's pushed too far and how the appearance of weakness causes meat eaters to gather around their prey. Superb performance from Hoffman and Susan George (One of the most underrated actresses of our time) there is one scene in which she pulls of a once in a lifetime captured on film moment. She conveys with her expressions, anger, fear, desire and shame all in one look! This is the way films should be made if you like your movies to build slowly with characters that all have a deep mystery behind them and when they finally unfold layer by layer it explodes like a nuclear bomb and the shattered pieces blow all over the viewer until once he has finished watching the movie he has to clean off the debri and he realizes he has just been taken on a cinematic pleasure ride.",1378684800,3,955,4.401129943502825
281361,4,6300251217,"I put off seeing Straw Dogs for years thinking it was a revenge picture. I had the idea that it was about a timid man whose threshold for abuse is tested by some bullies. If that were all the film was about it wouldn't be worth my time and it certainly wouldn't be worth the acclaim it has received. Straw Dogs is more than a simple tale of a man pushed too far; it's about the nasty side of human nature, particularly the way women play men off against each other.

The movie is set in a small English village, where Hoffman and his wife are vacationing. His wife has some history with one of the local men. The man and his friends do some work on Hoffman's vacation home. At some point, Hoffman's wife begins nagging him to confront the men. I found this odd. Why does he need to confront them, I wondered? Just because they're outside laughing? For whatever reason, she has an unseemly desire to get Hoffman into a violent confrontation with the men. Hoffman is unresponsive to his wife's goading, which frustrates her, so she turns her attention to the men, whom she entices by strutting in front of a window nude. Her passive-aggressive game pays off by the end of the film, at which point the men are trying to murder her and Hoffman.

I found the last 20 minutes of the film frustrating because Hoffman is too stupid to realize why the men are after him. He doesn't realize that his wife provoked the whole episode. If the men were so unpleasant, why did they allow them to work on the home? Why didn't they spend their vacation somewhere else? His wife knew this would happen. She worked to make it happen, then played damsel in distress. Hoffman doesn't see everything the audience does, but he should be able piece things together.

I'm aware that the film has been remade, but I can't imagine that it would portray the female character this way. Films like Straw Dogs and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf aren't made anymore.",1378425600,2,1934,4.473087818696884

281564,3,6300251217,"Sam Peckinpah's controversial 1971 film still packs an emotional and visceral impact 40 years later.  I actually saw the 2011 remake just the other night and while there are many similarities, the significant difference is that in the original David and Amy Sumner are vastly more complex - and unlikeable.  David is an emotional void--condescending, insensitive, rude and extremely self-centered.  Amy is more vapid, flirtatious, and emotionally abused.  Peckinpah's noted assurance of filming violent cinema in an almost poetic fashion is evidenced in the climactic finish.  Dustin Hoffman is his usual competent self, going from the repressed nerdish mathematician to the vicious warrior he eventually becomes.  I was more impressed, however, with Susan George, an actress who never seemed to go anywhere with her career.  Her rape scene is very disturbing in its enigmnatic complexity---rape or some form of kinky sex?  It's the ambiguity that makes it so disturbing.  An uncredited David Warner is chillingly effective in a small but significant role as the village ""idiot"".

While I understand, and sometimes participate in, suspension of belief this movie had me scratching my head to say the least. While no movie is perfect by any means, this one had so many potholes you could drive a fleet of trucks through.

I have to agree with others regarding the the rather explicit mysogynistic tendencies of the director. Case in point: the first appearance of the female lead (Amy) is a close-up of her erect nipples through a sweater. Talk about first impressions! Also, the often mentioned rape scenes, the first one in particular. How many women come on to, then reject, then come on to their rapist! While home alone in her bathrobe, she not only lets this guy in the house but offers him alcohol literally within the first 5 seconds! When he initially forces himself on her, she appears to be alternately returning and rejecting his kisses. This is after he's smacked her around a couple times. As if it couldn't be any more puzzling, during the rape she sensuously tells him to go slower (WTF!) then afterwards asks him to hold her in some twisted post-coital embrace! I'm sorry, but isn't rape supposed to be a brutal and violent violation of another human being for which people that perpetrate such a crime (even in that era) rightfully get locked away for long periods of time!?

The ""awaking of the beast within"" for Dustin Hoffman's character was wrong on so many levels. Granted, he didn't know at that the time that he was actually protecting a pedophile who had just murdered a child. But during all the brouhaha, he hears his wife screaming from upstairs and rushes to the bedroom to find the guy he's protecting trying to rape his wife! He pulls the guy off of her and merely gives him a disapproving LOOK (shaking his head ""NO"") before locking him in the attic? Are you kidding me?

The last thing I'll point out about this film is the irony of Hoffman's character being a mathematician yet he can't count to five! There were a total of 5 bad guys out there and after he's dispatched of 4 of them he says: ""I've got them all"". Of course, he quickly discovers he didn't count correctly. In a brief aside, since when does a foot injury become a fatal injury? Just one of those things that make you go: ""Hmm.""

What I find most amusing are the people that find this movie so deep and profound. My first thought was: did they watch the same movie I did? But then I thought about the late, great Peter Sellers in Being There. It was a masterful, and hilarious, satire regarding how people can interpret the most arcane and benign actions as having some greater meaning even though that was not the intention.",1319500800,3,2739,4.516129032258065
281650,5,6300251217,"Sam Peckinpah's STRAW DOGS is one of those movies that polarizes its audience in various ways: it's blatantly violent; it's incredibly slow-paced; it's so realistic as to seem lazy; it's nihilistic and incredibly down-beat.  Almost everything about it is predisposed to controversy, which is arguably what makes it such a brilliant examination of the violence within.

David Sumner has come to England to live in his wife Amy's hometown.  Immediately he recognizes his outsider status; the locals don't take kindly to him, and David for his part thinks himself superior.  This leads to tensions building between the Sumners and the townspeople, enhanced by the fact that one of the agitators was once Amy's lover.

The fires in the film burn slowly, but when they reach their peak, they are massive.  It's an eruption of violence, much of it almost unwatchable, yet Peckinpah injects enough humanity--easily mistaken for sexism and egoism, perhaps--into all of it that you can't help but look away.  As David and Amy, Dustin Hoffman and Susan George have dynamic, realistic chemistry--their love is palpable, and so are their fights, and the slow disintegration of their marriage makes complete sense given the context.  The violence that ultimately ensues is not over-the-top, really; it's just awful to watch because it hits close to home.  What Peckinpah is suggesting is that every one of us is capable of discovering something new, and that we may not always like what we find.

The Blu-ray (which I'm reviewing) is a mixed blessing.  It's nice to have the film available again (remakes are good for something, I guess), and it looks/sounds fantastic (sound, indeed, is a big deal here, especially in the brilliant climactic scene).  However, there are no bonus features aside from ""TV Spots"" and ""Theatrical Trailer"" (which sounded so mundane I didn't even check them out).  A making-of, tribute piece, or even a bit on Peckinpah himself (as we got with THE WILD BUNCH, a brilliant documentary narrated by Kris Kristofferson) would have been a nice addition.  As is, we get to judge the film on its own merits (as it should be), but the package is a little too bare-bones for the price tag.

Make no mistake: STRAW DOGS is not for everyone.  Many will be bored; many will be appalled.  But if you are unafraid of films that examine the human condition, that take their time to make a frightening point, then this film is a must see.  If nothing else, it proves that Chekhov's old adage about a gun in the first act also applies to bear traps.  Yikes.",1319155200,6,2556,4.888631090487239
281651,4,6300251217,"This may be fanciful but I draw a parallel with this film (and its descent into savagery; the loss of civilisation in a remote English village) and that same loss in William Golding's Lord of the Flies (on a remote tropical island). There is a brooding under-current of potential menace almost from the start. The young wife is becoming disillusioned because her husband is wrapped up in his mathematical research work. ""I need to be left alone!"" he declares. She needs him; his love, his attention. Local men are repairing the roof to the garage. They see her in her mini skirt and bra-less sweater and think their lecherous thoughts. She passes an open window to the bathroom, opposite where the workmen are and can see clearly. She has removed her sweater (in preparation for the bath) and stands for seconds, topless, looking at them. Is she wanting the thrill of `being seen'? She certainly wants attention. Eventually she gets it. Her husband is lured to a day of shooting ducks. While away, one former friend knocks on her door. She offers him a drink. He makes a pass. She asks him to leave. He tries to kiss her. She slaps him. He slaps her back. Her hair is pulled as she is dragged to the sofa, rape ensues, where she protests then takes him for the `attention' she wants. As it ends, another lecher has entered the room and been watching. The sordid business is repeated, this time with no allusion to fleeting tenderness. The rest of the film descends further into simple violence. This was controversial when first released (at a similar time and with a similar reaction to Clockwork Orange). This is not for the faint-hearted. Its serious point however may be to show how thin the veneer of civilisation actually is!",1318118400,8,1731,4.678688524590164

281653,5,6300251217,"A brilliant but apprehensive mathematician and his beautiful wife retreat to an old farmhouse in the English countryside to escape the political strife that they encountered in America. After settling into their new home, their marriage continues to falter as Amy begs for attention while David remains fixed on his work. Meanwhile, the lazy locals that have been hired to complete work on the house have taken a notice to Amy's liberated feminism, and their incendiary behavior finally causes David to snap into a rage of primal violence and retribution.

Sam Peckinpah continues to break the mold of classic cinema in STRAW DOGS, which has been both hailed and criticized for its extreme depictions of rape and violence. These arguments are not entirely unfounded, when the film features an ambiguous rape sequence that has long been the source of controversy. In addition to Peckinpah's depictions of male savagery, STRAW DOGS would seem to lend itself to a misogynistic interpretation of events. A surface level reaction such as this only serves to discredit the carefully crafted characters, growing tension, and psychological breakdown that the film represents.

From the opening scenes, STRAW DOGS maintains a constant sense of unease that continues to build until the thrilling climax. This is can be seen in every single element of the film, from the key editing to the ways the characters interact with each other and through to the specific sights and sounds that Peckinpah chooses to include in order to keep his viewer on the knife's edge. There are countless exchanges and dynamics that must be examined to fully appreciate the complex psychology behind the plot. On one level, Peckinpah deconstructs the marital problems between his lead characters, problems which manifest in subtle and not so subtle ways on screen. Then there is the recurring theme of courage and what it means to be a man, which is constantly reproached both in David and Amy's arguments and in the way that David chooses to defend himself when facing the boorish thugs.

Dustin Hoffman and Susan George are each brilliant in their own unique ways. They are entirely believable as a young married couple, despite their many differences. Hoffman is timid and awkward throughout most of the picture, but there are slight cracks that occur mainly after Amy has pushed his buttons that will foreshadow his hidden aggression. George is given perhaps the most complex role as Amy. With David, she is playful and needing of attention, and often portrays the character as a naive schoolgirl. Things change as she becomes the object of desire for the workmen, where she puts up a callous front as the strong and defiant modern woman. During the notorious rape scene, she struggles with her own faithfulness and sexual desires, having been pushed aside and ignored by David for so long. This scene should not be interpreted as her submittal to the rape, but rather to her own wants. Her horrified reaction when Scutt joins in shows a shift to her true objection and violation. Although she constantly berates David for being a coward, we find in the end that she is the more fearful and hesitant of the two.

STRAW DOGS unleashes a raw and gritty violence that is unrelenting and unforgiving once the events unfold in the end. Peckinpah holds nothing back, and puts all of the graphic scenes on full display. This is, again, a major point of dispute for many film critics, who conclude that Peckinpah looks to exploit the bloody action. If this were the case, the struggle between the Sumners and their aggressors would have occurred much earlier on in the picture. Instead, Peckinpah takes a much more timely approach to the violence, and the final assault on the home becomes a metaphor for David's collapsing psyche. It is extreme, yes, but this is in direct contrast to the bloodless first and second acts.

As far as story and character development are concerned, STRAW DOGS outperforms any other film about rape and revenge. It marks a tremendous shift in movie making as a whole, and is considered by many to be Sam Peckinpah's greatest work.

281732,5,6300251217,"Is this an anti-violent film? Or does Straw Dogs advocate the use of violence in extreame circumstanes?

David Summner is a math academic. He and his English wife, Amy, move to England's countryside in 1971. Amy's home town. His wife implies early in the movie that they have gone there because David did not want to take a side during the campus upevil, a big issue in America in the early 70s. This was only a few years after the Columbia takeover, and Kent State.

Neither David or Amy find the peace they look for in the UK. Both are soon confronted by  the ruffian villagers, who are doing repair work at the Summners. One of them has been in jail, and the other had a long ago daliance with Amy. These are not nice man, but it hardly helps matters when Amy stops, topless, at a window in front of the workers. This is no justification for anything, but with these men and with 1971 standards, it is a foolish move.

Eventually, the men distract David, and Amy is raped, first by her former suiter, and then much more forceably by another in the possee. She does not tell David, but, he knows. Still, he does not confront the men.

But he does, the next day. When a disabled man accidently kills the daughter of one of the toughs, David accidently hits him in his car, and takes him home to care for him and protect him from the gang. The hoods arrive, and demand David hand him over. David refuses, and the men raid the house, setting fires, trying to get in.

He has had enough, and David fends them off with guns, knives, and homemade hot acid he prepares on his stove. He is transformed: at one point, one of the men is bound, his neck on broken glass, and the once jellyfish David says ""good, I hope you slit your throat."" Amy at first refuses to help David, but he, slapping her, litterally threatens to kill her if she does not. ""We're dead if they get in."" he says

One by one and with increasing relish, David kills all the men,

On the surface, the arguement that this is a pro-violent film is pretty strong. David seems to get vindication for himself, and Amy, by confronting and winning the battle with these sociopaths.

But at what price: David ends the film, clothes torn, blood stained,
his home in ruins. He has hit his wife and crossed lines he can never uncross. Was he right? Did he have any other real options? What has this done to him at his core--he will cetianly never be the person he was before that night. His marrage: what is going to happen to both these people?

In 1971, you could apply these questions to Vietnam, student uprisings, race riots. Now, you could ask: what do we do about an Osama Bin Ladin, a Taliban? How does a peaceful person act when confroted by an amoral bully? Eight years after 9/11, Abu Grabe, Gauntonamo Bay, are WE ever going to be the same? What has the unthinkable made US do?

This film is not going to answer any of the questions it poeses in  a way that makes thinking people feel comforable. But, then and now, it does  provide a context in which we can think about when violence is really needed, and how we deal with it when it is. Straw Dogs shows the COST of violence.

At the end of the film, the disabled man says ""I don't know my way home.""

""That's ok,"" replies David.

""I don't know, either.""",1246665600,4,3270,4.327332242225859

Since then, even a better one came out on Criterion and who knows, maybe we'll even get a great Blu-Ray transfer some day. The old VHS tapes of this  film were awful.

I have to admit: watching Susan George is one of the big enjoyments of this movie. She is hot! In reality, it's doubtful someone like her would marry a nerd like the character played by Dustin Hoffman, although that ""nerd"" comes out of his shell in the suspense-filled last half hour.

This is one of those early `70 films that broke ground and shocked a lot of people.  It's still an intense, uncomfortable movie, some 38 years after it was first released.",1241136000,,743,4.474074074074074
281734,4,6300251217,"The whole time I sat through `Straw Dogs' I was uncomfortable; not in a bad way though.  Director Sam Peckinpah does a phenomenal job of making every sequence feel more and more unnerving, even if the violence and terror doesn't truly take place until the tale end of the film.  You feel dirty, almost as if you were a voyeur taking a peek in on the lives of this beautifully conflicted couple as they expose themselves to you; flaws and all.

You feel like the enemy.

The film tells the story of David and Amy Sumner, a young couple who moves to rural England while David is on sabbatical.  Amy once grew up in the small town, and her new husband, the book smart yet socially clueless mathematician, is less than welcomed by the community.  As David immerses himself in his work his relationship with his wife begins to strain until she finds herself taunting the eyes of a local ex-boyfriend who happens to be helping fix up the Sumner's home.  This teasing can only go so far before it takes a turn for the worse, and when a seemingly mutual tryst goes all sorts of wrong it paves the way for the Sumner's new life to come crashing down on them.

The film is breathtakingly honest and brutal in its delivery; very gritty and raw.  There are scenes that are very hard to stomach, not necessarily because they are gruesome or explicit (the violence is mild compared to the horror movies of today) but because each and every scene feels real.

The acting aids in this feeling of reality, especially from the two leads, Dustin Hoffman and Susan George.  I personally feel that George is the standout here.  Her characters development is very passionate and convincing.  The big pivotal `tryst' scene is the best acting in the entire film; the confliction (`do I want to, yes, no, yes, no') and then raw emotion is utterly mesmerizing.  Hoffman is also very good here, some of his best work really.  He captures his characters sense of justice, and as the film escalates into the pits of violence we see his views change drastically, yet always convincingly.

My one complaint is that, while the film seems to have a lot to say about human interaction and the natural desire to exact pure justice, it seems to lose its head in the finale.  It almost feels like just an excuse to bleed forth with unrelenting violence.  It has a purpose, but it doesn't feel like it, so it winds up feeling unnecessary.  That is just my personal take.  Honestly, the film up until the finale is much more successful in delivering the haunting chill with the quiet moments of uncertainty.  The fast paced and rather frustrating barrage that is the final ten minutes feels like too much at once.  It's not a bad way to go out, but it's not the way I would have chosen.

Still, there is much to be said about this film and its powerful impact.  One can easily draw the moral code being flaunted throughout the piece; a certain warning against acting on our imperfect desires and impulses.  No one within this film outside of David (who is the outsider here) restrains themselves, which serves as a lurid foundation for our own social standing.  Are we a people who pride ourselves on control, or are we happy to allow our true person shine through, no matter how devastating the after effects?  `Straw Dogs' is a disturbing look at what life without control would look like.",1233532800,,3352,4.5711892797319935
281735,5,6300251217,"Eerie and disconcerting from the very first frame. Director/Co-Writer Peckinpah creates a strange alternative universe where people act on their base impulses. A stuffy professor (Dustin Hoffman) and his gorgeous young wife (Susan George) are thrown into this world and almost destroyed by it. Peckinpah creates a rich tapestry of characters and brilliantly explores the subtle and occasionally explosives shifts in power between them. The high-minded sophistication of film-making belies the outwardly lurid nature of the subject - ""Deliverance"" springs to mind as another example of this. Stunning in every department - acting (especially by Hoffman and George), editing, writing, music, cinematography, and of-course direction. In many ways Peckinpah's best film.

There is a fairly grpahic ""sort-of rape"" which is never brought up between the husband and wife after it happens.

Since you really find it hard to care for any of these people, the violent conclusion is not worth waiting for.  Maybe in its' day ...",1225584000,4,751,4.828125
281737,2,6300251217,"If there has ever been a more over-interpreted and stolidly misinterpreted film than director Sam Peckinpah's 1971 Straw Dogs, I've yet to encounter it. Yes, films like Citizen Kane and 2001: A Space Odyssey have had more ink spilled over them, but most of the ideas tossed about are on the money, and far less is read into them. Also, they have one big thing going for them that Straw Dogs does not. They are great films. While Straw Dogs is not nearly as good a film as its hagiographers claim- for Peckinpah had all the subtlety and psychological depth of a sledgehammer, nor is it as irredeemable a bit of pornography as it detractors insist, it is, above all, a very dull and mediocre film. This is not a word- dull, that has likely ever appeared in a review of the film, but what else can one call a film that telegraphs its end in the first twenty minutes, and has all the realistic character development of a Warner Brothers Roadrunner cartoon? Excuse me: let me rescind that. Wile E. Coyote, at least, plumbs some true existential angst.
  By contrast, the nearly two hour long Straw Dogs is not even that innovative and certainly not `naturalistic,' for the ultra-violence it depicts was done better (and strangely, even more realistically) in Stanley Kubrick's deeper and darker humored A Clockwork Orange- released the same year, and earlier by Peckinpah, in The Wild Bunch, by Arthur Penn, in Bonnie And Clyde; its scenes of cretins trying to break into the lead characters' home are pale echoes of George Romero's masterful low budget Night Of the Living Dead, and even the Vincent Price horror classic, The Last Man On Earth (and it's remake, the Charlton Heston vehicle The Omega Man); and the revenge theme done more engagingly in Wes Craven's campy debut film Last House On The Left- sans the guilty pleasure, and more deeply in the film Craven was inspired by, Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring. It acted, however, as a springboard for other films showing increasingly stylized violence, such as Deliverance (1972), Death Wish (1974), and Taxi Driver (1976)- films with different styles and artistic merits. As well, the film's politics and psychology are badly dated. This is especially true in the infamous `double rape' scene. Compared to Alfred Hitchcock's Frenzy, released a few months later, Peckinpah's motivations seem downright silly, which is especially noteworthy since Hitchcock built a career on Freudian pseudoscientific motivations for his criminal characters, yet abandoned that all for realism in his underappreciated 1972 gem.... In short, being controversial does not always equate with quality, and Straw Dogs seems more and more like a puerile attempt to simply shock (which it no longer even does), yet one with pretensions of something deeper- it is an ok B film with a better pedigreed director and A film production values. Ironically, that very lack of pretense is why a film like Last House On The Left works better, and a film like Night Of The Living Dead touches far deeper into the human psyche and far richer into true art. Shock filmmaker David Fincher (Fight Club), a manifest Peckinpah acolyte, once said, `I'm always interested in movies that scar. The thing I love about Jaws is the fact that I've never gone swimming in the ocean again.' Well, aside from his love of a rather routine and trite Steven Spielberg thriller (though the director seems to have gone all downhill since then), Fincher's dictum is not met here, for even the controversy of the alleged `double rape' and the violent ending seem, nowadays, to be much ado over very little, as not a single image sticks out in viewers' minds, not even the film's blurred opening of kids in a playground, which quotes Peckinpah's earlier The Wild Bunch. When an artist cannot even equal his earlier glories it's a sure sign of a lesser work of art. That's what Straw Dogs is, no matter how one interprets its inner workings.",1221696000,4,3936,4.864381520119225
281738,4,6300251217,"In this disturbing and violent film, Sam Peckinpah proposes that even
the meekest wimp has the makings of a ruthless killer, and that a flirty
woman, with the right man, could enjoy being raped.  This Cave Man-level
theory is acted out by a strong cast in rural Cornwall, England.

  The Dustin Hoffman mathematician can't cope with the primitive, rough
men of his sexy wife's hometown.  They are lazy, shiftless, conniving,
alcoholic cat-killers, but Peckinpah deep down likes them, just like he
liked the ""Wild Bunch.""  They are handsome, masculine young bucks who
are fond of laughing, singing rowdy folksongs, and hoisting beer mugs.
There's also a nasty, aggressive old drunk who is a bad influence on them.

Dustin channels HIS aggression by making the young vicar and his wife
squirm, playing loud bagpipe battle music (to be repeated later on),
and putting down religion.  But with real tough guys, he's hopeless.

When Dustin shelters a deceptively mild but actually quite dangerous
moronic sex offender, the drunken layabouts storm his stone farmhouse
like it was The Alamo.  The intellectual professor, through escalating
acts of violent defense, becomes a Cave Man, dragging around his younger
wife when she's being unhelpful.  He starts to enjoy his command of the
situation, and his new-found domination of his immature spouse.  By the
wrap-up, Dustin knows there is no going back.

Here's a plot-hole: after the nasty old drunk blows off half his own foot,
he is summarily forgotten.  Did his younger buddies let him bleed to death?
This is funny: when the hooligans are working for Dustin, they feign
mildness and call him ""Sir,"" then wave him past their truck and almost
get him killed, laughing uproariously.  When Dustin finally gets a knife
to the throat of one blackguard, the guy is back to calling him ""Sir!""",1219622400,4,1831,5.016556291390729
281779,3,6300251217,"Straw Dogs is a good film, but one that causes me to look down on limeys. Usually, Englishmen are respectable enough. However, I find myself losing respect for them after watching this film. Perhaps Sam Peckinpah was somehow inaccurate in his portrayal of limeys as depraved animals. Even in British director Peter Greenaway's films, notably The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, the characters aren't usually all bad. In Straw Dogs, all the Englishmen are depraved.

Take the Hedden family, for instance. Headed by the old, filthy drunk Tom (Peter Vaughan), they are a bunch of neer-do-wells who spent most of their time crawling about the local pub and screwing their own sister. The daughter in this case is Janice (Sally Thomsett), who is treated as a sex object both by her father and her teenaged brother, Bobby (Len Jones). Hell, even Bobby seems to be portrayed as a scumbag with all his incestuous yearnings and misogynistic attitude toward his own sister.

Then there's the trio of workers hired by David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman), to make repairs on his home. One guy, Cawsey (Jim Norton) steals a pair of Amy's (Susan George) knickers for his own amusement. The other two men, Venner (Del Henney) and Scutt (Ken Hutchison), invite David on a hunting trip, only to sneak back to his cottage and rape Amy in a most brutal scene. The first rapist, Venner, isn't entirely without feelings but is still an animalistic scumbag. Scutt is an utter degenerate.

Speaking of perverts, there's also child molester and one-time pedarast Henry Niles (David Warner), who, despite warnings from his older brother John (Peter Arne), continues to go about his perverted ways with Janice. Her eventual fate causes all hell to break lose. The only other main English characters in the film, including Major Scott (T.P. Mckenna) and Reverend Hood (Colin Welland) aren't given much to do besides drink and ogle Amy.

Most of these parties eventually meet to culminate in a half-hour siege on the Sumners' home, where David kills all his attackers in an orgy of bloodletting. Thus, ending a quite decadent movie full of animals and sexual perverts.

Sure, Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch featured its share of loathsome degenerates, but Straw Dogs isn't set in America. That's the difference. I feel Straw Dogs would've worked better if Peckinpah did some research on Cornish rednecks in general and not portray them as such monsters in the film.",1215993600,,2436,4.96078431372549

The second time I fell in love with it; for all the wrong reasons.  The third time, something clicked and I realized this isn't a Hollywood movie, there's a reason it still strikes a nerve with so many people: it's one of the few films that says to you, in a whisper:

""If you like this movie for the action, you're scum; if you associate with any of the characters, you're scum.  If you cheer during the siege, you're utter scum.  This is not a heroic film, there are no good people, because in life there are no good people, we are all animals.""

At the time, and to this day, claims of the glorification of violence are heard, but this is just idiotic.  In order to glorify something, in the end, it has to be shown in a majestic light.  Straw Dogs does everything but this; it begins quietly and ends bleakly, you'd be heart broken if you weren't so scarred and trembling.

Sure, Hoffman goes from mouse to ""man"", ""but at what cost?"", the film asks.  His already crumbling marriage is utterly obliterated by the final sequence of the film, where he declares that he's no idea how to get home, because what once was his house, wife and all, is no longer a part of him.

It's a statement on many things: the animal nature of the human being: territory, sex, violence, pride; the futility of law.  Highly recommended, but don't expect a chipper feeling when the credits begin.",1195430400,22,1502,4.359712230215828

281788,5,6300251217,"Straw Dogs (Sam Peckinpah, 1971)

I sat down to re-watch Straw Dogs, my favorite Sam Peckinpah movie, this weekend, and realized that somehow I'd never managed to review it. I'm rectifying that now, partially because I never did review it, and partially because I realized something new about the film this time-- something that most people who write plot synopses of the movie don't seem to have ever caught. Since I'll be discussing that, and it plays on a critical point in the movie, this review will be laced with spoilers. If you haven't seen the movie (or read Gordon Williams' book The Siege at Trencher's Farm, upon which the movie is based), you might want to skip over the second half of this review until after you have.

The plot, if you've never seen the film: An astrophysicist, David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman), and his wife Amy (Susan George, who, like seemingly every other actor born in Britain, recently did a stint on EastEnders) leave America and buy a house in Amy's old hometown. It needs work, so they hire some local lads to do it, headed up by Charlie Venner (Soldier of Orange's Del Henney), an ex-boyfriend of Amy's. David is a bit of a pushover, and the provincial attitude of the natives gets to work trying to find interesting ways to humiliate him. When he tries to stand up to them, things escalate, and the cycle keeps growing until things have no choice but to end badly.

BEGIN SPOILERS.
Here's the interesting bit (and the big spoiler): most of the plot summaries I've read of the film (the current detailed synopsis on IMDB is an exception, going so far as to point out the exact same thing I'm about to) point to Amy's rape as the crux of the matter. (As a side note, this scene, which almost landed the movie an X rating in 1971, would likely garner it a mild PG-13 today.) This is in no way the case. I somehow managed to not notice, in all the times I've seen this movie in the past, that Amy never tells David she's been raped. It is a crux for the viewer of the film, but it in no way affects any character in the film save Amy and the workers. (And it affects Amy far less, when the crux of the movie does come, than it seems it should; she's still just as willing to side with the natives. The provincial attitude runs deep, it seems.) When the crux of the movie does come, it is, perhaps, the most important moral lesson the movie has to make, and it is one that has been buried over the years: that Henry (played remarkably by a young David Warner) is always a passive element in the events that surround him. Teenaged Janice (Man About the House's Sally Thomsett, whose film career would end in retirement soon after, as she switched over to theatre) is never less than fully, consciously aware of what she's doing when she seduces Henry, which makes the village's reaction to the situation all the more absurd (but, in today's idiotic culture of ""teenagers aren't old enough to know what they're doing,"" distressingly understandable), even more so because there are eyewitnesses to Janice's approaching Henry. It is truly shocking, and depressing, that this film holds up as well as it does today; were the same situation to happen today, the public would likely have the same ""off with their heads!"" reaction, and they'd be just as wrong. In fact, there was a situation in America a few years back that is almost an exact mirror of the Henry-Janice scenario in Straw Dogs, and it did, in fact, end with the public calling for blood. You have to love people who cling to outmoded and morally unjustifiable social mores, don't you?

Given these two facets of the film, the way they combine in the climax of the movie leads to a bit of confusion, at least on my part. There is a scene where David realizes that Charlie has slept with Amy; however, it's set up in the opening scene that he is apprised of the fact that they're exes, and there's nothing in the scene to lead David to the belief that they slept together recently. I grant you, jealousy may run as deep as provincialism in Goodman and Peckinpah's script, but I get the feeling there's a scene, or even a snippet of a scene, missing somewhere. I also spent a great deal of time wondering (though this is nothing new) why it is that David cares at all about Amy after the events that open the final scene. She has shown beyond any doubt that her provincialism has won out over her marriage, a balance that's been tipping the entire film. She has a complete lack of understanding of the tenets that David has embraced and that cause his transformation (one which, when it's completed, will mean he no longer needs her). While she eventually comes to accept the shifting of the balance of power in the relationship, does it seem realistic to you that either of these people would still see a relationship between them at all? Now, obviously, this question goes unanswered at the end of things, as all we see of the aftermath of the siege is David leaving to drive Henry home, so it's entirely possible that David and Amy do part ways a few frames after the movie ends. We'll never know. But the implication is that they'll stay together, and that the previously assertive Amy is willing to accept that all the sudden David has taken charge. I'm just not buying it.

END SPOILERS

None of that makes Straw Dogs any less my favorite Sam Peckinpah film. The pacing and the tension are pitch-perfect throughout, problems that Peckinpah sometimes struggled with in earlier films, and the casting is phenomenal; I can't imagine anyone other than Dustin Hoffman as David Sumner, and that's a rare thing for me. Peckinpah and excellent action cinematographer Jean Coquillon (who would go on to work with Peckinpah on two more films) fill the screen with unforgettable shot after unforgettable shot, making the film as much a visual feast as it is an obscene morality play. The script is fantastic, even when I end up asking myself questions about it for days afterwards (in fact, isn't that one of the things that makes for a great script?). For some, it will not be an easy film to watch, but Peckinpah has some very interesting things to say, and they should be heard. **** ",1190332800,4,6173,4.555855855855856
281819,4,6300251217,"I don't think Dustin Hoffman thought too much of this film, as, in his own words:  ""I did it for the money.""  The literary reference to the phrase ""straw dogs"" has to do with effigies of dogs made of straw and burned by others, like witches tied to stakes.  I don't know if the phrase is supposed  to refer to the husband and wife in this film, but if not, they're certainly castigated, to say the least.  I've seen two different versions of the rape scene, one of which was from Amy's POV, which made it truly horrifying; and  Susan George was only 21 years old when this film came out.  (Both Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight seem to have a thing for movies with sodomy scenes: ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""Deliverance"").  I think the finale was more bizarre than scary, and the film had too many scenes with no emotional content or reason, such as Susan taking her top off for the camera, or focusing for several seconds on her panties as she takes forever to get out of the car.

281822,5,6300251217,"Dustin Hoffman was young then, young and slightly mellow, maybe even plump. In this film he has a delicate role and he is learning the trade. He has to be both a mathematician immersed in his maths and a husband reacting to his wife's feeling of insecurity. When the local neighbours become aggressive, killing their cat and hanging it in their closet, then raping the wife, then attacking them at night because they are harbouring the local simpleton who was going to be lynched by the villagers, the father of the girl who had provoked him at the head of them with a fire-gun, he loses his calm and yet keeps his head. That makes an explosive cocktail that brings the local ""authority"" down dead, and then all the members of the lynching gang down dead or not far from it. Of course the beautiful renovated Irish farm does not have one window left and has suffered heavy damage. But the scientist-husband has managed to have the last word with these drunk hooligans and also with his wife, though she never said two of them raped her in the afternoon. But she is the one who uses a lying-about gun to kill the last assailant. She finally finds some courage instead of waiting for her dear husband to do it in her place. The film is quite bizarre though because it seems to show the Irish as being more or less whisky-bags or beer-bags, if we can use these words, and at the same time, the American wife is vain and seems to believe that her being married is going to make these men forget she had been mooching around with them during her vacations before being married. The American husband is both an intellectual engrossed in his own thinking, easily fooled by these locals who take him on an expedition hunting the snark on the heath, and an extremely cold-thinking defender of his home and wife, as well as of simple principles that make lynching an out of question solution to any situation. Dustin Hoffman cuts a very credible character in spite of his youth or because of his youthful naivety.

281823,5,6300251217,"As an unsettling and draining look into the horrors of fascist and territorial ideas breed out of masculinity, the 1971 film ""Straw Dogs"" is an emotionally peeling viewing that will bring your own viewpoints to the surface. The film garners the high proverb of being a messed-up western, character study, thriller, war film, action movie, social analysis, and an art house film rolled into one; while its philosophies show its perceived messages as an absolute: yet, one may see a gray area between those apparent viewpoints, ones speculated, and the rest will bring about the viewers own real life feelings into light about the context of the film. All these subtexts inside Straw Dogs are presented in a mature, non-exploitive way, piling on the dimension of its unique central characters, without giving a definite feeling of sympathy.

The plot concerns the nighttime assault by a group of ruffians on a pastoral home in which a man that is suspected of killing a girl is staying.  The owners of the house, David and Amy-- Dustin Hoffman and Susan George,-- feel the man is entitled to a trial, and must find a way to fight back and survive the night.

Some may see Straw Dogs as a feminist film, in the way that the stereotypical male hormonal and aggression concepts set forth in the initial two acts of the  film, are further acknowledged by the violent and bloody testosterone set pieces in the final ""showdown."" Yet, there is no female or male character to connect to in the typical cinematic way of them  being ""purely likeable."" The audience will rather connect to the characters of David and Amy more because they are the only marginal likeable characters in the film, and we can agree with many of their actions, even if its often in the form of self-serving, or if the rest of the film depicts them as unsympathetic cowards. This is because the humanistic side of the audience will not want any more violence be committed to any character in the film, because its not ""cool violence,"" rather it is brutal, and nihilistic.

These medieval concepts are shown in David's  ascent into a ""man"" protecting his territory. This is poetic in the way of ultimate truth over the ""peace-and-love"" beliefs of the time; while Amy, despite some childish antics of young boys, is in many ways the man of the relationship, before going callow for most of the final siege scene. Yet, when the time comes to have her pick up a sword--so to speak-- she obliges. Yet, this absolute truth, also has a definite, antisocial reaction in the way that there is not one glimmer of decency seem to be left in all those who survive-- rather they go off into their own respective roles of ""man"" and ""woman"" without a sense of direction for the future.

The often written about two dialogue lines show this, they are:

Henry Niles-- ""I don't know my way home.""

David-- "" That's ok. I don't either.""

It is this dialogue exchange that shows the way that the rest of the cast was either one-noted stock characters, or neanderthalistic sexual and/or violent fix-seekers; and there is no sense of valediction for any of these ""animals."" Their violent actions, no matter how necessary they seem at the time, only make them more isolated from others. Peckinpah`s real life personality was driven by a lust for alcohol and a clenched fist ready to fight; this educated, but untamed persona seems to bleed through the film, as if it is a demon exertion exercise for Peckinpah, an acknowledgement of who he is, but as if saying this is how all people are when pitted with grave life-threatening obstacles, it thus becomes survival of the fittest, like in the animal kingdom. Yet, at the same time, when we make this choice to go back to our ancestry, it does not come without consequences-- in this case, total isolation from the rest of the civilized world, as if going back to the hunter and gathering civilizations.

It is this philosophy of humans as an animal that makes ""Straw Dogs"" still so bloody good today. As this is certainly one of the best films of all time, and is a masterpiece of savagery that clearly shows that human horror is the most threatfull thing to our race of all.

281824,5,6300251217,"I will start with my thesis, namely that this film is one of the single greatest American films of all time, ridiculously complex psychologically, completely satisfying on an aesthetic level but at the same time hating itself as said success. Not a shot or line of dialogue is unnecessary, and almost every scene is ambiguous enough to be read any number of ways. It is easily more complicated than Pauline Kael and Roger Ebert would have you believe, and is in my mind a much subtler and more intelligent father to the cinema of satirist Paul Verhoeven.

I don't believe David is the villian, that is too simple of a subversion, nor do I find him to be as unsympathetic as others do, but I think that is the whole point. We are meant to identify superficially with David, to congratulate ourselves on our intelligence and civility, all the while enjoying the inevitable brutish spectacle play out as it does in all genre films, only this film is one of the very few that is aware of the voyeuristic beast that is the audience. Rather than cartoonish villians, I would argue that the villagers should be seen as more overt manifestations of David's personality throughout the film. He is smug and condescending, secure in his intellectual and moral authority, and he is just as much an aggressor as they are, flaunting his money, car, and knowledge as opposed to his drinking, crudeness, and sexual potency, and using it to constantly one-up everyone around him who will bear it (the single scene in that most exemplifies this is his meeting with the reverend). Amy is too often knocked for being a one-dimensional ""tease"" character, but I would argue against this as well, although I'm not sure I would call her the most sympathetic character in the film as some would. I would instead argue that she expressing herself sexually because it is the only way she can express herself in this microcosm, where every woman is objectified and men are only interested in them for sex and as a symbol of status. In the end no one is right here, though some may be more abused than others. Everyone is fair game for Sam Peckinpah's misanthropy in this great and crude masterpiece.",1172966400,5,2171,4.698162729658793
281825,5,6300251217,"'Straw Dogs' deceives the viewer by focussing on mild-mannnered mathematical wimp, David Sumner and his bored, restless young wife Amy. What the film does is to give the impression for much of its time that David is a coward, when he fails to stand up to the bullying local workmen fixing his garage roof. That is the main purpose to the long, slow build up of this plot. But it's only in the violent finale when the true nature of David's aggression is unleashed, and presumption of his cowardice is finally shattered.

What starts out as friendly banter and mild teasing by the workmen gradually develops into more sinister taunting as David remains poe-faced and refuses to show any sense of humour or reaction toward these locals. 'They think you're strange' says Amy. 'Is that because I'm an American' asks David? 'No, just strange' she muses.

As the men become more brazen toward David they cross the line when one of them manages to enter the house and strangles Amy's cat. On discovery of this unfortunate event, Amy nags David into confronting the men over this, and he finally, but reluctantly concedes to the idea. He invites them into his house for this purpose, but again he backs away, not even mentioning the cat, and instead is tricked by the men into going on a hunting trip with them, used as a ploy to get him out of the house for a period. David mistakenly takes this as a real opportunity to bond with the men. What follows is one of the most unappetising and controversial scenes of its day, and is still uncomfortable viewing now.

When David is deserted on the shoot and returns home feeling humiliated he finds his wife in bed tearful. We are not told whether Amy ever reveals what happened while he was away, but the grim expression on David's face when he sits down outside, just after firing the men the following day, suggests that maybe he did know or suspected something untoward. It was also the first time in the film that he shows genuine courage in confronting the men and firing them on the spot.

The siege on David and Amy's home is the final chapter when he is pushed over the edge. Like the rest of the film it raises so many questions. Did David use the injured Henry Niles as an excuse to maim and kill his aggressors, or was he genuinely trying to defend the man he had accidentally knocked down earlier in his car? Were the workmen genuinely concerned about the fate of Tom Heddon's daughter, or were they exploiting the situation to bully David? And of course there is the one answer to the question of whether David was ever a coward, as accused by his wife earlier. He said then that he wasn't, and boy did he prove that point in the last half hour or so. It's an exciting climax to a film that seems ponderous for the first hour or so. But the film has a lot more depth and layers to it than revealed in a single viewing, not least the relationship between Amy and David itself. And I've only touched on a few of the connundrums in this story.

Director Sam Peckinpah raised many social issues in this unfortunate tale. The acting is first rate all round, and the film is essential viewing.",1171152000,4,3139,4.490367775831874
281826,5,6300251217,"This is my favorite Sam Peckinpah film.  I always loved it as a high schooler, and I still do.  To see Dustin Hoffman, a calm, reserved intellecutal type turn into a monster like he does is chilling enough.  But you find that you're actually cheering him on at the end of the film.  This film, along with A Clockwork Orange (released the same year!  What a year 1971 was!), really get into man's darker nature, and tell us some uncomfortable truths about ourselves.  We really root for Hoffman, even though he's killing people, and he's enjoying it.  Even in the quiet, rural, ""idyllic"" English countryside, there's still human garbage and barbarism.  You can't escape life, so to speak.  The editing, direction, and performances are first rate, making this one of Peckinpah's most daring films.",1170806400,,795,4.873134328358209
281827,4,6300251217,"Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" has to be one of the most thoroughly unpleasant movies I've ever seen.  As film it is important in only one way: to what degree the notion of manhood is a cultural fiction and to what degree it has a very basic biological reality.  This will be the subject of endless debate, most of it taking place outside of film school.

Force as an opponent of the ideal and vice-versa is the conflict at the center of this exercise in degradation, mistrust, embarassment, and any other hellish feeling you can imagine jacked to the maximum.  Dustin Hoffman does a fantastic job as the thoroughly emasculated David Sumner; in each scene up until the end you can really feel the reclusive, fearful, and completely testosterone-free nature of the man.  You can tell this is a more a sociological study via cinema than a movie meant to be believable: a man like this, steeped in his intellect to the behest of every other quality, would not be with a woman looking or acting like his wife, the unbelievably annoying and stupid Amy Sumner played achingly well by Susan George.  He'd probably be alone and have other intellectuals as friends, and she'd probably be bar hopping until she met and married one of the thugs who harass the two throughout the movie.  I think Peckinpah wanted everything stacked against David to see how he would eventually react, and a thoroughly unappealing female leading character was necessary.  Even his wife can't give him a break and feels disappointed in him because he isn't violent enough.

Also, why the hell does he hire Charlie if he realizes from the get go that he was a former lover of Amy's?  When he sees him leaning over her in the car at the beginning, why doesn't he run out there and confront immediately?  Even the mousiest of men, in my experience, would have snapped long before this guy does.

The rape scene is one of the most confusing and disturbing things I've ever seen in a movie, although I saw it coming. It isn't clear whether Amy wants Charlie to just make out with her or go farther.  It is even more disturbing when she says, after being slapped twice, ""hold me, hold me"" and behaves in a puzzling way indeed.  But it is a rape, plain and simple; yes, she did invite him in, yes, she did turn down his request to leave which seemed very sincere; but he used force when she clearly asks him to stop.  What finally puts the lid on any any indecisiveness about the scene is his friend brutally joining in.

The scene in which the two attend the church function and the disaster ensues is among the most nail-biting sequences I've ever encountered in a film.  It is a la Hitchcock the whole way and leaves the already horrific situation open for a vista of horrifying possibilities--most of which come true, all except the death of Henry Niles, the handicapped man played brilliantly by David Warner.  The death of the teenage girl infatuated with him has some pretty obvious echoes of ""Frankenstein"", and works almost as effectively.

The only likeable characters in this film are David Sumners and the aforementioned Niles.  The cop is decent enough but he's almost impotent as Hoffmann's character in dealing with these scumbags.  I have to admit I enjoyed the ending very much, particularly the only decent people in the film driving away together.  I would agree with Peckinpah (if this is what he is trying to say) that it took violence for David to become more of a man, but my question is, why?  Are these kind of things inevitable?  Not at all.  Has he committed some horrible crime by lacking the instinct which keeps inner city kids shooting at each other and people f**king each other up in barfights?  To that I would say no.  This movie is a success in provoking a lot of discussion and thought, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it again.",1170547200,2,3828,4.591176470588235
281828,5,6300251217,"I think this is one of the most misunderstood movies I've ever run across.  Even the DVD box description on the version I have states that it is the tale of ""one man's journey from cowardice to courage"".  And after reading customer reviews that would go on for reams if they were written on paper, it seems that many of the people who have watched this movie understand it little better.

I never viewed Hoffman's character as a coward or a weakling.  Certainly he was a bookish man of academia, unused to the coarse company of country laborers, but I never viewed him as frightened or even really intimidated by any of the gang in the film.  He never had any problem talking to the work crew as subordinates and hired men, especially when finally firing them.  His character was simply that of a very civilized man who did not anger easily or resort to violence for petty or trifling reasons.  He was a serious academic from NYC in Britain on a fellowship grant to study mathematics.  He wanted little else but to be left alone with his work.  His alternately comely and shrewish wife invited most of the trouble that came their way.

I don't believe that he was AFRAID of violence, but that Hoffman's David was a man who did not believe that violence solved things.  It was the flauting of the rule of law in the lynch mob outside his door and their serious lethality that spurred him into action.  It was not the barrage of insults or petty tricks or harrassments.  It was the fact that the simpleton he was harboring in his home would be immediately KILLED if turned over to the boys outside, and moreover the fact that he, his wife, AND the simpleton would be killed should the boys come inside.  Back against the wall, David was not indecisive nor afraid of confrontation or action.

The director, Sam Peckinpah, believed strongly in the element of violence in the natural world.  That it is neither necessarily good nor evil....only present and real and hanging over all of us as human beings even in ""civilized"" times.  He made violence and the exploration of it main themes in most of his movies, though probably none more obvious and direct as in Straw Dogs.

I believe that his main theme for this movie is that the world is a violent place, and that being prepared to meet violence violently is a necessary rite of passage, for any person male or female.",1168646400,5,2366,4.540094339622642
281869,4,6300251217,"Dustin Hoffman stars as timid mathematician David Sumner in Sam Peckinpah's highly controversial film, ""Straw Dogs"".  The film filmed in England and banned there due to excessive violence was released at a time when this type of film action was starting to be in vogue.

Hoffman and his flirtatious and comely wife Amy played by Susan George go on retreat to the farmhouse she grew up in in the Cornwall countryside.  Looking for solitude to complete his research he hires some locals to complete some repairs of the house.  Sensing his cowardice they become abusive and intimidating which culiminates in a brutal rape scene of George, the main reason for the banning of the film.

George keeps the incident from Hoffman but when he accidently strikes local pervert Henry Niles played by David Warner on a foggy night with his car he feels responsible.  He offers him shelter in the farmhouse not knowing that Warner had accidently just strangled a local girl.

Hoffman seeking to protect Warner and George morphs into a merciless warrior defending his turf in a segment festooned with violence as he proceeds to bloodily dispatch the group trying to gain entrance to the house.

Peckinpah's penchant for the display of violence in his film was demonstrated quite vividly in ""Straw Dogs"".  The portrayal of the rape scene was disturbing even to actress George and had to be toned down. The ambiguous depiction of her reaction to her violation was extremely puzzling and branded Peckinpah as misogynistic by his critics.",1165968000,2,1652,4.952898550724638
281870,4,6300251217,"Sam Peckinpah, the legendary Hollywood director as famous for his drinking and fights as he is for his films, made his first non-Western with ""Straw Dogs.""  In this movie, filmed in the rustic windblown countryside of Cornwall, Peckinpah makes marriage look as ugly and violent as the Wild West ever could.

""Straw Dogs"" stars Dustin Hoffman, fresh off ""The Graduate"" as David Sumner, a young American mathematician who flees the raging cauldron of America during the Vietnam War to sit in his basement in Cornwall, England and ponder lofty math theorems.  His gorgeous, nubile British wife Amy (Susan George) struts her sexually-liberated-and-frustrated stuff through the tiny Cornwall town, taunting the locals and tempting fate.  She can't but help catch the eye of her former beau, Charlie (Del Henney) and his gang of labourers.

David and Amy really have an ugly marriage.  They are in love with each other, but it's clear they are far from soulmates.  David spends hours ignoring Amy in his basement study working on math, and Amy responds not with understanding but with petulance.  He does not respect her, and she does not respect him, and for such an attractive couple (Amy is a particular knock-out and insists on wearing the shortest of skirts and no bra, to everyone's notice) it appears that they have a rather hum-drum sex life.  To all of which they respond with little games of one-upsmanship and other minor relationship turf wars.  David is one unlikeable guy, and Hoffman manages to play against type superbly here.

***Major Spoiler Alert!!!***  I usually don't include spoilers in reviews, but this is essential to understanding ""Straw Dogs"" and has also been the subject of much discussion over the years.  The movie takes a dark turn when the handful of labourers David has hired to work on his old farmhouse set up David and Amy for the infamous rape.  What makes this scene so controversial is the fact that Amy, after some initial-but-ineffectual fighting, actually seems to enjoy it when the first rapist takes her.  She is horrified when another labourer joins in, completely against her will.  This scene is Peckinpah's well-documented effort to make the audience feel guilty, 'cause we've been ogling Amy just like the rapists have.  And it succeeds - ""Straw Dogs"" is a movie that generally makes you feel pretty darn bad inside.  But it's undeniably effective.

The rape scene is essential to the theme of the movie, but not its action.  Amy does not mention the rape to David.  David, however, runs up against the labourers after firing them.  He naively makes matters worse when David picks the wrong side of a local village war.  One Henry Niles (David Warner) is a simpleton but has a history of hurting young girls.  When Henry gets spotted leaving a church social with the daughter of one of the local toughs, a ""posse"" goes out for him.  David accidentally hits Henry with his car and brings Henry to his house to wait for the doctor to arrive.  The toughs learn of this and demand David release Niles into their ""custody,"" a sure death sentence.  David refuses out of principle.

This leads to a long scene where the toughs get drunk and try to bash their way in to get David, Amy, and Niles.  It's one heck of a violent scene, for David taps into his hidden violence and is surprised to find out both how much he is capable of and also how much he enjoys it.  Peckinpah handles these violent scenes with realism - there are no Bruce Willis quips or ultra-slick ""kill shots.""  Just long, drawn-out brawling.  Nobody does that better than Peckinpah.

At the end of the day, there is a high body count in ""Straw Dogs"" and no clear hero.  There is not a sympathetic major character anywhere in the movie, and that's just how Peckinpah wanted it.  As a result, be warned before diving into ""Straw Dogs.""  You will surely admire the movie, but the odds are pretty good that you're not going to like it very much.

Running Time:  118 minutes

Rated R for violence, a disturbing rape scene, nudity, and some language.

Reveled Director Sam Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" (1969) was one of the most controversial films ever made for its time and is still be considered violent today. Plot progression was dealt with quickly but the violence was carefully elongated to create full pitched battles with shocking bloodletting. Most of the violence was filmed in slow motion, even when civilians were caught up in it. Death was no longer reserved for the ""bad-guys"" dressed in black. Every character was portrayed in different shades of gray. Also, Peckinpah used great dialogue and characterization so that combined with the performances of excellent actors (William Holden, Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oates, Ben Johnson, Edmond O'Brien, Robert Ryan) he managed to pull together not a mindless gore-fest, but a picture that spoke of loyalty between friends and honor in death. Two years later Peckinpah directed ""Straw Dogs"". Although it, too, can be considered violent and it was definitely controversial (banned in the UK), ""Straw Dogs"" is a slight disappointment. It's set in a small town in rural England, which becomes the new home of American David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman) and his British wife Amy (Susan George). Together they are trying to escape the violence of American society and decide to settle down in Amy's peaceful hometown where David can find the time he needs to write his book on ""stellar interiors and their radiation characteristics"". The details on what he does are very vague. All that Peckinpah wants us to know is that David is one of society's intellectual elite. Of course, to follow the clich when it comes to nerds in thrillers, David is portrayed as a coward without a spine. The locals soon begin to dislike David since his mannerisms seem alien to them. The situation deteriorates faster because one of the locals, Charlie Venner (Del Henney) was once Amy's boyfriend and is obviously jealous of David.

The Sumner's move into Amy's father's old house and hire several men to repair the roof on their garage. Slowly the men (Charlie among them) begin to harass the two and invade their privacy. It gets worse as their actions become more sadistic and abusive. The tensions finally break one night when David is trying to protect the village idiot from an angry mob. Janice, the daughter of an uncontrollable drunk (also related to Charlie), was seen walking home one night with the idiot (who has a shady past when it comes to the safety of young girls) but then disappears. David, while driving home from a community event, accidentally hits the idiot and finds that it's his responsibility to take care of him at home. The drunk gathers together a mob and tries to manhandle the idiot into telling him where Janice is. David sums up his courage and decides to be a man, taking on a ""my house is my castle"" mentality. A bloody siege ensues.  Similar to ""The Wild Bunch"", ""Straw Dogs"" has many of Peckinpah's trademarks. It opens to a scene of children torturing a dog (""The Wild Bunch"" opened to the same thing except the dog was a scorpion). Both films end in bloody climaxes. The script for ""Straw Dogs"" has well-developed characters (right up to the last twenty minutes) and there is an excellently created atmosphere that helps deliver a sense of uneasiness with each line delivered by the outstanding cast. The differences between Amy and David, along with the harassment of the locals, all creates an almost unbearable tension. Amy is a lighthearted and beautiful young woman who acts so immature it's childish, and David is a selfish, solitary workaholic afraid of taking risks. The surrounding characters are all stupid, rude farmers with the exception of the local magistrate. All is perfectly set for the climax. Actually, the setup is so simple it's a little predictable. From there the movie goes further downhill. Peckinpah showed his talent for directing violent climaxes in ""The Wild Bunch"", but in ""Straw Dogs"" the violence is so long it's silly. The mob circles the Sumner home trying to break in. The doors are thick oak reinforced with steal, so it would seem sensible to go through the windows. No, that would shorten the action so they mill about for a while destroying the property. All is plausible since they're drunk, but a minute before they were sober and on a mission to save a young girl. Plausibility comes into question. It's all for violence's sake, which in the process cheapens the movie.

Dustin Hoffman was never an actor to fear controversy, and ""Straw Dogs"" catches him right at the peak of his best years as an actor, after ""The Graduate"", ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""Little Big Man"", and before ""Lenny"" and ""All The President's Men"". His performance is as amazing as in any of these, and again Hoffman proves his rare range, as well as his sensitivity; his performance carries the film to true excellence, and perhaps that's the other reason that the film was a bit more difficult to take than ""A Clockwork Orange"" - to take nothing away from the wonderful Malcolm McDowell, what Kubrick's film simply didn't have was a protagonist for the viewer to identify with, and therefore, like I stated before, it was easier to take as an analogy, and Alex functioned more as a symbolic and iconic character than as a real human being. David Sumner, on the other hand, is a remarkably realistic and convincing character, and one that is very easy to relate to, which makes the change that comes over him towards the end of the film all the more shocking. Again, it is that building up of tension that makes this film such a powerful experience. Besides these flaws ""Straw Dogs"" is an enjoyable motion picture with a different message than that of ""The Wild Bunch's"". In the latter, criminals past their prime go down with guns blazing to save their friend, proving their honor amongst thieves. It portrayed the ""bad guys"" as honorable but the ""good guys"" as greedy railroad barons. It showed that no man can be classified as either ""black"" or ""white"". We're all gray and everyone has sinned, it just matters whose shoes you're in whose eyes you see things through. ""Straw Dogs"", however, is about one man's personal transformation in order to protect his abused dignity. As the tag-line says, ""The knock at the door meant the birth of one man and the death of seven others."" ""Straw Dogs"" is still an enjoyable and thought provoking film.",1150848000,2,6635,4.889777777777778
281874,4,6300251217,"It's funny how everybody who reviews this movie comments on how heroically the mousy professor defends his wife against a gang of English thugs. Nobody ever seems to mention that the Dustin Hoffman character is a totally cold and insensitive jerk who verbally abuses his wife every chance he can get. When the thugs come to his house initially, it is to get a drunken man who had possibly done something to the daughter of the gang; Hoffman's character refuses to hand the man over-- mostly because out of sheer arrogance that sparks the big, and final confrontation. I watched with grim fascination how  he fought off five bad guys while at the same time I was thinking such a horrendous jerk really needed and deserved to get the stuffing beat out of him.

All in all, I really like this movie; Susan George gives a great performance as the put upon wife who is abused by her husband and raped by the men in the village where they live and Peckinpah's direction gives us many plot twists that go right up to the ending. Hoffman plays such a cold-hearted S.O.B. that I can't say that I enjoyed his performance but that's no fault of his, but this still a great movie.",1140566400,2,1168,4.504716981132075
281875,5,6300251217,"Sam Pecknpah followed his extremely violent and critically acclaimed 'The Wild Bunch' with the even more violent 'Straw Dogs', which didn't sit as well with the critics; in fact, 'Straw Dogs' was shocking enough to be banned in the UK where it was filmed, although in the US it was released with an X rating. Critics attacked it as being overtly violent and sexual, and entirely missed the message Peckinpah was making. Three and a half decades later, though, it's easier to appreciate 'Straw Dogs' for the groundbreaking creation that it was, and its influence can clearly be seen in the works of such contemporary directors as David Fincher, David Lynch and Todd Solondz, among others.

With hindsight, it's hard to miss the fact that the sexual and violent content of 'Straw Dogs' isn't a whole lot more shocking than that of Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange', released that very same month. 'A Clockwork Orange' also created its own share of controversy, of course; yet somehow it was more rapidly recognized as the masterpiece it is by critics than 'Straw Dogs'. In part, I think that's due to the fact that while 'A Clockwork Orange' is an ultra-violent surreal fantasy from its very beginning, 'Straw Dogs' seems entirely innocent at first, like a very realistic and light-hearted drama, and the violence builds gradually throughout the film. That sense of realism, which 'A Clockwork Orange' never pretends to, makes 'Straw Dogs' much more difficult to take as an analogy; it cries out to be taken at face value, which makes it much more difficult to swallow.

Dustin Hoffman was never an actor to fear controversy, and 'Straw Dogs' catches him right at the peak of his best years as an actor, after 'The Graduate', 'Midnight Cowboy' and 'Little Big Man', and before 'Lenny', 'Papillon' and 'All The President's Men'. His performance is as amazing as in any of these, and again Hoffman proves his rare range, as well as his sensitivity; his performance carries the film to true excellence, and perhaps that's the other reason that the film was a bit more difficult to take than 'A Clockwork Orange' - to take nothing away from the wonderful Malcolm McDowell, what 'A Clockwork Orange' simply didn't have was a protagonist for the viewer to identify with, and therefore, like I stated before, it was easier to take as an analogy, and Alex functioned more as a symbolic and iconic character than as a real human being.

Again, it is that building up of tension that makes 'Straw Dogs' such a powerful experience.

'Straw Dogs' is a film that creates controversy and disagreements, and so it should. It's easy to create controversy with sex and violence; but many years later that initial shock fades, and the real test is whether or not the film stands the trial of time and still manages to shock and engross. Like 'A Clockwork Orange', 'Straw Dogs' stands that test. Love it or hate it, it's hard to deny that it's an important and influential film, and it's essential viewing for any film lover.",1140220800,9,3219,4.796396396396396
281876,3,6300251217,"About the infamous rape scene...

It's important to bear in mind that this is a work of fiction, not a documentary.  In fiction, people do not necessarily behave in ways that people do in real life.  It is, for instance, highly unlikely that the meek Dustin Hoffman character could successfully slaughter a half dozen brawny opponents, but that's the story.

The second point to remember is that the rape scene comes in two parts, with two different sexual couplings.  The first is merely a ""fantasy rape scenario"", while the second underlines that point by showing a far more realistic example of rape.

How does fantasy enter into the scenario?  Although some may deny it, studies have routinely shown that 'forced sex' fantasies are popular with both genders. Nancy Friday, in ""The Secret Garden"", documented the popularity of such fantasies with women. Anyone who has ever read a typical romance novel from the 1970s (the time this movie was made) realizes that the 'rape' scenario has played a key role in women's erotica.

This does not mean that women want to be raped (nor that men want to rape them), merely that many women are sexually aroused by fantasizing about non-violent situations where they find themselves overpowered and 'forced' to do what they really want to do.  In these fantasy situations, the women are really in total control, of course, because the fantasy takes place only in their own minds.  The fantasy 'rapist' does only what they choose for him to do, no more no less. He is, in fact, the puppet in the fantasy, not them. If they chose, they could just as easily fantasize about them raping HIM (another theme that arises in some women's fantasies).  As such, there is no actual 'rape' at all in 'rape fantasies', only the iconic use of masculine force and a pretense of resistance to add heat to the imagined situation.

In the film, just such a fantasy is presented, then contrasted with the reality of rape.

The Susan George character knows the first 'attacker' well.  She grew up with him and introduces him to her husband early on. There's a strong possibility that they were lovers in the past, or at least boyfriend and girlfriend. Residual sexual tension remains between them. It is clear that the man desires her from the moment they meet again. It is likely that the continued attraction is mutual.

Although the Susan George character no doubt admired the peaceful, civilized manners of her husband when she met him in a culture which valued these traits, it is clear that she is repulsed by (and ashamed of) her husband's perceived weakness once they move to the backwater community where she grew up - a more primitive and violent environment where his passivity is seen as a mark of shame.  It's hard to shake one's upbringing, and once back in her home town, she bristles at having to watch the macho locals ridicule her passive husband.  She reverts to the villagers' way of valuing things, and when she does, the socio/sexual value of her husband dims by comparison to that of her former macho boyfriend, a native son who understands the rules of survival there.  A part of her yearns for the rough, primitive kind of man she grew up with - but the Hoffman character seems incapable of being that man for her.

As her husband continues to ignore her sexual needs, and resentment between them increases, the (fictional) Susan George character seems to make a (conscious or subconscious) effort to goad her former boyfriend into making a move. Perhaps she is hoping that her husband will respond by becoming a more masculine protector, perhaps she is trying to prove to herself that she is still in control in the backward environment (even though it is clear that she is not), or perhaps she secretly hopes that her former boyfriend will force her into the affair she secretly craves.  Either way, she is playing a dangerous game, but seems to feel that any result would be preferable to the current situation of being ignored by an ineffective husband.  She exposes herself to the man and his fellow workers on several occasions, virtually daring them to do anything about it.  Having grown up there, she must realize the likely consequences of goading these kind of Neanderthals.

When the men lure her husband away on a hunting trip and her former boyfriend comes knocking at her door to test the waters, her actions are revealing.  She meets him wearing just a robe over panties and a T-shirt. She lets him into their home while she is alone and helpless, despite knowing his aggressive nature. She offers him a drink.  When he offers to leave voluntarily, his offer seems to be a sincere one, but she tells him to stay. She challenges him openly about killing her cat, even though she must know how a primitive like that would respond. Finally, when he kisses her, gently, she doesn't resist.  Quite the opposite, she responds sexually, clinging to him and kissing him back, displaying obvious desire for him. While still in his arms, but not resisting, she says ""Please leave me"", sending what may be the world's most mixed message. He kisses her again, and once again she kisses him back, although she mixes in a minor show of resistance while doing so.  Suddenly, she pulls away and slaps him, hard, in a mock pretense of outrage.  Predictably, the confused Neanderthal reacts aggressively. His angry response is more violent than she expected, as he loses his temper, slaps her back hard.  She backs away, as he begs her not to tease him (which is exactly what she has been doing, whether intentionally or because of conflicting desires).  When he reaches out gently to brush her hair, she she slaps him again, which to a man of this social level would be translated into a challenge to his masculine strength, perhaps even a message of ""if you want me, you'll have to take me by force"".

He believes that she is merely teasing him, and (in this story) he is right. In stereotypical caveman fashion, he drags her by her hair to the couch, slaps her again and rips off her robe.  She is briefly overcome by fear & pain, by resentment of being manhandled, and by guilt over betraying her husband, so she resists at first. Even then, though, there is something in her heavy breathing and 'heaving bosom' that seems to come straight out of a bad old romance novel. Her resistance, while real, seems less than whole-hearted. Her breathy gasps of ""no"" are mixed with returned kisses and embraces of the man who is about to 'rape' her.  And despite making a few threatening gestures when needed to subdue her, the 'attacker' otherwise seems suspiciously gentle and romantic in his approach, in line with typical bodice-ripper fantasies.  The former boyfriend seems to genuinely care for her. He even says ""I'm sorry"" as they finish.

Once she is stripped naked and taken on the couch, she soon responds sexually to her old lover, pulling his head down to kiss him passionately, caressing his face, and clearly enjoying the sexual act, perhaps even achieving orgasm.

This is not really supposed to be rape that we are watching, this is a fictional, unrealistic 'force fantasy' playing out on screen, the end result of a lengthy game of sexual one-upmanship in which she has manipulated the Neanderthal male into doing what she wants - taking her by force, and hence absolving her of the guilt associated with voluntarily cheating on her idiot husband.

To view it as actual rape (despite the initial violence at the onset) is to misunderstand the dynamics of the scene.

The SECOND part of the incident, on the other hand, is meant to illustrate the actual crime of rape, and to contrast it to the earlier fantasy situation.  This time the attacker is a stranger (not a sexy former lover whom she secretly desires). This time the sex is truly involuntary. This second time, it really IS rape.  There is no romantic tenderness this time, she is held face down and either sodomized or taken from behind in brutal fashion - and she definitely doesn't enjoy it.

We are seeing two different events: a real rape, and a pretend rape.  Fantasy and reality. The former, in this script, being no more than an extramarital affair played out under the guise of resistance. The latter being a clear act of violence and sadism.

(On another note, on first viewing, it's easy to make the mistake of assuming that Dustin Hoffman's orgy of violence is an act of revenge for the rape of his wife.  But in reality, his character never learns that his wife was attacked. His violent explosion comes as the result of the men invading his home and challenging his manhood - an idea that is probably more open to criticism than the rape scene.)",1133654400,35,8675,4.731739707835326
281877,4,6300251217,"Could this be (apart from A Clockwork Orange) the most controversial movie of all time? I think so. Whether or not it's a great movie is another matter, however i've chosen to give it 4 stars and so I guess it must be good.

Firstly, there is the rape scene, which I personally think is responsible for the films sucess. ok, so it's a bit dodgy, but the gangbang in 'I spit on your grave' was 10 times worse. People need to get over the fact that SHE GETS RAPED! Big deal! You get to see nothing but half her breast and so why all the fuss?! Is it because she seems to enjoy it with one man and then struggles in agony to break free with the other rapist? Let me explain. She only apears pleasurable with the first man because she's known him all her life! He isn't a complete stranger. The second man is. And so it would appear that being forced to have sex by someone you know is not as bad as been raped by someone you don't...understand? Ignorant 1 star reviewers? It's not because she fancies on man more then another as one reviewer stated (he was probably 13). You have to get over the fact that sex in films isn't awlays bad, and so critizing it blatently because of a naked breast is being shown is nonsense!

I felt the movie didn't portray any sort of humour in any way. Ok, so it's hard to make someone laugh when they've just seen a women get slapped around and raped, but black humour could have neutralized the acid for this one.",1131235200,,1444,4.209386281588448

281920,5,6300251217,"Confrontation, self-doubt, self-knowledge appear to me to be the themes of this very fine movie. What makes a movie great? If it stimulates thought, pushes into the recesses of the mind, remains memorable for decades. What person, not having been tested,  knows exactly how they would behave if threatened by an overpowering group of thugs, or how, if a woman, they were raped and what their post-rape reaction might be? The film is extremely unsettling, and, I suggest, we are not entirely sure that we wouldn't behave rather like the Hoffman or George characters in similar circumstances. That is, none of us are as resolute and heroic as we'd like to think we are, or as Hollywood pretends we can be. This film is real --- Bruce Willis and Gary Cooper are romantic fantasies. Like other Peckinpah films, there is nothing feelgood about this story. He works at the cutting edge of the unbeautiful truth of these matters.

The acting is superb. Peckinpah extracts terrific performances from both Hoffman and George. Especially George, perhaps. The build-up of claustrophobic tension is exceptionally well directed. It resembles Polanski's Repulsion, to some extent. A collection of highly flawed personalities, with relationships on the brink of disintegration, each damaging the other's psyche. A good deal more true to life, in my experience, than the masterful command and surmounting of every challenge presented which characterizes the stereotypical Western drama.

The second one : this is a movie about revenge. But just as we are not aware initially of the director's sarcasm towards the audience, the main protagonist is also not aware that his actions are in fact acts of revenge towards those who fully deserve it based on events that took place in the past. He may think his actions are based on current threats, but his antagonists and audience know better. What you don't know may still hurt your enemies.",1122249600,,654,4.504201680672269
281922,5,6300251217,"Caution-possible spoilers ahead: The old Hollywood production code required that justice be rewarded and evil punished, the last genre to hold onto this concept was the Western (and prime time television). Violence was always highly selective; you might see the good guy wounded once in a while, but it was almost always the ""deserving"" bad guys who got killed. This reflected the U.S. mainstream view of violence and of pre-Viet Nam foreign affairs. What made 'The Wild Bunch' revolutionary was that Peckinpah made violence universal. Everyone stood in the same shade of gray/neutral moral middle-ground and everyone; men, women, children, dogs, and chickens were shot up in the final scene, regardless of their guilt or innocence (not unlike the diverse group of victims at Kent State in 1970).

Then along comes 'Straw Dogs' and Peckinpah makes another violent anti-violence film where the moral distinctions between victims (be they physical or psychological victims) is again ambiguous.

The film opens with a processional of Amy and 'Wannabee Amy' (Sally Thomsett in a dead-on Lolita performance) turning all the male heads as they walk through the village. And this introduces us to the parallel stories that will be taking place during the film. Amy will spend much of her time amusing herself by provocatively arousing a group of young men in the village. Thomsett's character will spend her time flirting with David (the Dustin Hoffman character) and with the village idiot (David Warner doing Lon Chaney's Lennie from 'Mice and Men'). Just one year removed from playing an innocent child in 'The Railway Children' Thomsett is perfect as every father's nightmare of a post-pubescent boy-crazy daughter.

Peckinpah's theme is about personal responsibility (and irresponsibility) and how actions have consequences. Amy and 'Wannabee Amy' will play with fire during the first part of the movie. Amy will tease the young men of the village, will playfully run them off the road with her car, and will fearlessly challenge them about killing her cat. She will even become a willing participant in what starts out as forced sex with her former boyfriend. But Amy will suffer the consequences when this is followed up by an actual rape. 'Wannabee Amy' will seduce the village idiot and suffer the consequences when he panics and accidentally kills her.

At this point Amy wants no more consequences from her irresponsibility. But David stubbornly insists on protecting the village idiot until the authorities arrive. When the magistrate arrives and is killed by the five goons outside their house, David pragmatically concludes that the goons cannot let Amy and him live, even if they turn over the village idiot. Once cornered David must fight and reverts to primitive animalistic behavior.

I think Peckinpah is telling us that we still have an innate instinctual capacity for violence and instinctual responses to violence, that women are still excited and attracted by these displays and may consciously or subconsciously incite them. Call it part of the courtship ritual, it probably has an evolutionary function.

In addition to the parallel story lines that occasionally touch each other before finally coming together and essentially ending, Peckinpah structures the film so that a third storyline then takes over. After Amy's need for excitement has set the events in motion and they have escalated beyond her control, she withdraws and refuses to deal with anything anymore. Her active role is then taken up by the formerly passive David, who until this point has been dodging confrontation. First he is pushed to a point where he stubbornly refuses to back down any further, and finally he is cornered with has no place to back down even if inclined to do so.

I was very impressed with the work of the Production Designer on this film. The countryside, village, and house have a very uniform visual style that fits the storyline of a foreigner dealing with an insular community.

I really have no problems with this film. I found it one of those few films that are riveting from the very start. During my initial viewing I recall hating the scene where David and Amy are arguing while sitting on opposite sides of the fireplace. I was mentally protesting 180-degree rule violations and the disorienting cuts. But by the end I realized that this visually reinforced the unraveling of their relationship; it is a good example of why movie-making conventions can be broken if breaking them advances the story line.

'Straw Dogs' takes place in a Peckinpah world where men must be willing to do life's dirty work and anything else if they wish to survive, and where actions have consequences. This is a world where love has limits and might even be impossible.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1120176000,6,4818,5.0566750629722925
281923,5,6300251217,"There are few movies that more melodically ring the chimes of discovery than Sam Peckinpah's 1971 classic, Straw Dogs.""  I made the point of seeing it the other day after coming across a review that condemned its unsavory and animalistic view of human nature.  At that point it became a ""must see"" for me.  A few moments past the credits, one comprehends why it so traumatizes our polystyrene (over)sensibilities.  There is nothing friendly, forgiving, or welcoming about it.  The movie is uncompromising and forces the audience to examine urges which they would deny having.  In our age of therapism, such affronts have little appeal, but, for this reason alone, it a film that should be enshrined in our cultural memory.

""Straw Dogs"" was crafted by a man who, when moderately sober, was one of the most talented directors of his time.  Sam Peckinpah never saw entertainment as being an end in itself.  Here, his embellishments create a tale of tremendous anthropological significance.  It illuminates our inner drives more thoroughly than any of the books you'll find on display in the self-help section of your local bookstore.

Although, that is not to say that the film only has value due to its theoretical implications as it is strong on the surface.  It possesses a clever plot and features characters that easily capture our interest.  With the force of a Hummer, it propels us into the personal world of an intellectual, David (Dustin Hoffman), who is isolated in a foreign country and surrounded by hostile forces that modernity has no way to explain or dismiss.  His wife, Amy (Susan George), should have been a towline to safety, but, instead, her loyalties are nebulous and her actions seem to willingly exacerbate every problem that arises.

The year 1971 is not remembered as a glorious time, but, back then, a story like this one could still be told.  Nowadays it would be self-censored by Hollywood.  Life from the vantage point of our ancestral African Savannah is no longer welcome or acceptable to the social engineers of our day.  They do not wish us to see it, and, if we do, it is only allowable through the microscopic analysis of bones and rubble.

""Straw Dogs"" transcends our diagnostic categorizations and instead reveals the psychology of the tribe.  Dustin Hoffman is trapped in a situation where playing a gentleman means that one will be eaten alive. In today's environment, the gelled and feminized metrosexual would be garroted and have their head put on a pole, while those women wishing ""to have it all"" would quickly find themselves inseminated or dead.  The main character's determination to defend himself results in his repressed instincts being released, and this forever changes him. The astrophysicist can never return to his old life.  His tasteful, prefabricated self is no more.  Indeed, he announces this in the final scene when he informs a guilty man, who was the catalyst for the movie's climax, that he ""doesn't know the way home either.""

The most revealing, and dare I say ""revolutionary"", character in the film is the wife.  Susan George plays a woman whose agenda could not differ more radically from that of her husband's.  George craves Hoffman's attention and does not understand why he would rather work rather than interact with her.  To secure his regard, she even goes so far as to sabotage his efforts by changing around the mathematical signs he has written upon a blackboard. She also behaves seductively towards the workmen, and refuses to wear a bra in their presence.  When she opens up the car door, she hikes up her skirt so that they can more fully gaze at her legs.  Hoffman warns her that her teasing demeanor is partly to blame for their malattentions.  By his making such a statement alone, the film would be judged to be beyond the pale by radical feminists.  Indeed, in the 1990s when Camille Paglia made a similar statement about female dress, it resulted in a firestorm of feminista ire.

A hallmark of political correctness is to question the psychology behind critics who question the dogma.  It is the ""let's call you Sakharhov"" approach to argumentation.  Contradictory positions are never responded to but psychologized instead.  Admiration of ""Straw Dogs"" would be interpreted as an individual's personal affirmation of violence and barbarity, but, of course, it is no such thing and actually the polar opposite.  To treasure the film is to value the fragile balance that is our society.  The audience embraces Hoffman for his resourcefulness and we are elated when the village louts receive exactly what they deserve.  An isolated intellectual in the beginning becomes a symbol for every domesticated man by the end.  The film forces us to be grateful for the civilization to which we were born.  It is a civilization that protects our mothers, wives, sisters, and daughters from predators...and defends us from ourselves.  ""Straw Dogs"" reminds us just how fragile our hold is over the invisible forces within.",1118102400,23,4997,4.965102286401925

281925,5,6300251217,"Movie: This is not a film for everyone.  When I first saw the movie, I wasn't quite sure what to think or how to feel.  Sam Peckinpah has a way of doing that to his viewers, sometimes.  So, I watched the film again and I began to see the brilliance of the film, the examination of violence and how it occurs through the parable of the mathmatician and his wife who move to a Cornish village.  The performances and the way Peckinpah uses violence to make his point, and indeed, examine his own demons and problems is amazing.  Those going to this film expecting to see the ""most violent ever made"" may be disappointed, as the violence seems a little tame by today's standards of cinematic violence.  Although few films have the creative vision and strong characterization that Peckinpah has here, and uses to great effect.  The film is great (once one gets used to it)!

DVD Package: Critierion is always on top of things when they release a DVD and they don't skimp out here, even for a fairly obscure movie that has only recently gained some attention from cinemaphiles because of the Criterion release.  On the DVD, there is the invaluable commentary by Stephen Prince, a Peckinpah biographer and a strong admirer of the directoir's work.  His commentary is a fascinating analysis of Peckinpah's style and content, breaking down even the composition of the frame to give depth and meaning.  The Peckinpah bio is good but a little long.  The disc also includes some essays that further help shed light on Peckinpah's artistic vision and use of violence.  If one is a film buff or a fan of film criticism and critique, than buy the Criterion release for the Stephen Prince commentary and the essays.  Stephen Prince, through his commentary and essay contained here, has helped me enjoy this movie more and has helped me look closer at the movies I watch.

Bottom Line: If you like 'Straw Dogs', the films of Sam Peckinpah, early 70's cinema, or good film analyses...find and buy the Criterion DVD release of Straw Dogs.  Buy quickly though, as the Criterion release is Out of Print.  MGM bought the rights to release the film, and they did so without any of the great special features available on the Criterion release.  If one is unsure about Peckinpah or this film, rent it first or buy the cheap MGM release.",1114128000,4,2312,4.666666666666667

This film is about an introverted, unassertive wussy who is married to an extroverted, smoking hot young woman. Throw in some cultural displacement and some local jerkwads who want a piece of said young woman and you've got acres of room for character development.

Dustin Hoffman is, as usual, compelling as David Sumners, meek mathematician, who just got married to his beautiful young bride. They are moving to her house in rural England where a group of men are working on her garage. However, they begin to harass her and David, increasingly intensifying their efforts as they realize that David will do nothing about it. However, David cannot take much more, and is finding it harder and harder to control his primal emotions that we all have. What Peckinpah is asking is, is violence a necessity in one's life? Is violence essential to deal with the external conflicts brought on by others? In this case, yes. Violence can only be answered by violence in David's scenario.

While not for the easily disturbed or squeamish, ""Straw Dogs"" is a film any serious moviegoer should see and praise for it's never lessening vitality and brilliance.",1099526400,,1027,5.035294117647059
281971,5,6300251217,"Despite it's reputation for being gratuitously violent, ""Straw Dogs"" isn't really.  The film, until it's climax, forbodes violence which in many ways is more chilling than the act of violence itself.  The film concerns itself with a pacifist mathematician, David Sumner(Dustin Hoffman) who moves with his youngish British wife, Amy(Susan George)to the Cornish village from where Amy was reared.  Sumner is met with immediate resentment by a segment of the town's populace particularly from a group of laborers who Sumner has hired to fix up his cottage.  In the meantime, it is apparent that the marriage between the Sumner's is somewhat rocky and not without tension of it's own.  This lethal mix has all the earmarks of a combustible explosion and does it ever.  The more popular reading of this film is that when the most passive of men are confronted with a violation against themselves or their property they will react in kind to protect themselves.  However, on the film's commentary track, film scholar Stephen Prince has a different interpretation for Sumner's behaviour.  This is one of the better scholastic commentarys I've heard so anybody who has already seen ""Straw Dogs"" would be advised to play the DVD with it on.  As for the performances, Hoffman is excellent as Sumner but the real revelation here is Susan George as the woman-child Amy.  Prince in his commentary picks up on the complexity of George's performance that I had not picked up on in my initial viewings of this film.

281972,1,6300251217,"This piece of misogynist crap from the early seventies has been justified by mostly male critics for far too long, though kudos to the one guy in this line of reviewers brave enough to voice his feelings to the contrary. Once again we have the boring premise of enigmatic, teasing sex kitten who ultimately deserves everything that happens to her, and boring, cold nerd who ultimately triumphs over all the bullys who used to beat him up on the playground at school. I wouldn't be quite so bitter except that the lighting is dull, the dialogue wooden, the camera work uninspired, the editing primordial, and the relationships ridiculous. At least Clockwork Orange was brilliantly written and shot. I sense that the odd consensus on how great this film is stems from the mostly male audience and filmmakers deep hatred of the women who rejected them (hence the gratuitous hanging pussy scene), and their need for a very visceral revenge (hence the truly vile rape sequence, lovingly overdone as if the filmmaker himself were the rapist). And the righteous ending is a way to make it all seem as if there were a higher purpose to their venal rage. What are we supposed to get out of all of this - that only the nerds are allowed to be sexist brutal pigs? That women really are one-dimensional sex objects that deserve to be raped over and over on camera? My question is this - why wasn't Susan George asked about what she thought of all this - wouldn't it have been a much better use of the special features? I suspect it was because her hatred of the film would have made it impossible to put a good spin on it. The only positive thing I can see coming from this piece of cinema dreck is its use as an accurate  dating barometer.

The main problem here is that almost every character in this film is utterly unlikable, and terrible things happen to the two characters who are likeable. But even that wouldn't be so bad, if the film had a message.
Dustin Hoffman's character is a whiney, wimpy, and mean spirited person who, when he finally decides to act, he does so for all of the wrong reasons & defends the wrong person. I end up hating him MORE than the bad guys.
I rank this as the most unwatchable movie I have ever seen, even below ""Short Cuts"".

281974,5,6300251217,"It's not at all hard to see the connection between Peckinpah's two greatest movies: Straw Dogs and The Wild Bunch.  Both are studies of what it means to be a man, a look at the masculine and sometimes violent male nature.  Basically, Straw Dogs is about an extremely timid American intellectual who decides to escape the Vietnam-fueled violence of the USA by moving into the small English town where his wife was raised.  However, the man soon realizes that violence is pretty much omnipresent, when the men he hires to fix up his new home begin pushing him and his wife around.  I won't give away the ending, but if you know Peckinpah you can probably guess.
of course, most people will probably want to see the movie for its infamous rape scene (which got the film banned in the UK, where it was filmed).  Not only is the rape graphic, but the victim actually appears to enjoy it; at least at first.  Here I must disagree with the lengthy rant of a prior reviewer when I say that the rape scene is not simply an exercise in mysoginy, but rather helps to show just how immasculinated the main character has become.  Throughout the first half of the movie we see his wife slowly flirting with the contractors (at one point even letting them see her topless).  This suggests quite obviously that she has become so disgruntled with her husbands lack of backbone that she is actively seducing the very masculine contractors, and the fact that she enjoys the rape is simply the logical extreme of her desire to have a truly ""manly"" partner.  Of course, those who've seen the movie know that eventually she's punished for her covetry of man's aggressive nature.
Overall, I highly recommend this movie.  In fact, I'd suggest you get it ASAP, since the Criterion version has been out of print for months now and won't likely be available for much longer.  You need a strong stomach to watch it, certainly, and the pace is very deliberate, but those who have patience and put effort into understanding the meaning of the film will be very well rewarded.",1080172800,4,2045,4.621546961325967

The subtle actions of each individual leads to a huge crescendo in the end when David must take a stand.  Straw Dogs is a dark and clever film that has tremendously rich character development.

281977,4,6300251217,"I remember hearing Charlton Heston once remark about Sam Peckinpah that the man had a great career and vision but then sadly ""started blowing off heads."" Heston may be right in his analysis of Peckinpah's dedication to dramatic violence, as one need look no further than the closing sequences of the seminal ""Wild Bunch"" to see a death toll of truly shocking proportions. This director's proclivity for bloody violence, usually shown in slow motion to ratchet up the effect, doesn't find as much expression in the 1971 psychological thriller ""Straw Dogs."" There are a few nasty encounters with a shotgun peppered throughout the final twenty or thirty minutes of this atmospheric picture, but nary a head leaves its shoulders here. Starring Dustin Hoffman, a few years after his stint in ""The Graduate,"" and a fresh-faced Susan George, ""Straw Dogs"" spends more time setting up a pervasive sense of doom than concerning itself with a huge body count. Actually, this movie's restraint is surprising for a Peckinpah picture. Then again, I haven't seen a lot of Sammy's films, so perhaps this movie falls into a period when the director felt a need for moderation.
David Sumner (Hoffman) and his British wife Amy (George) decide to rent a cottage in England while David works on writing a book. The village the two decide to live in has intimate connections with Amy Sumner, who lived there before meeting and marrying the bookish David. A gang of local thugs, who the Sumners hire to repair the roof of the cottage's barn, well remembers Amy. One of the guys actually had a relationship with this mouthy woman, a link that bodes ill for the amiable but wimpy David. Even worse, the goons have the support of the primary troublemaker in town, a man who even the local constable tiptoes around. The Brits resent David's slightly arrogant manner, his nerdy appearance, and the fact that he goes home with one of their own every night. Disrespect for David takes mild forms at first, usually in the form of funny looks or comments muttered under the breath, but soon the tension between the men and the Sumners escalates into the murder of a pet cat and intimidation on the road leading into the village. David rationalizes away the threats by stating that the problem will simply ""go away"" if he ignores it. His wife, who seems to know more about how things work in town, urges David to confront the local men. The tension becomes palpable as Sumner must deal not only with the hostility of the local populace but with his wife's strident calls for action as well. It soon gets to the point where Amy questions David's manhood over his meek manners and sycophantic behavior.
Things go from bad to worse when Amy's former boyfriend, who sees David's simpering personality as a sign of weakness, decides to reassert his claim to Amy. In a scene that led to a ban on the film in Great Britain for three decades, the gang lures David away from the house so Amy's former beau can pay her a visit. The subsequent scenes are tough to watch, not necessarily because of their brutality but due to Amy's response to part of the proceedings. Not until another goon steps in does Amy show great resistance to what has happened, leading a viewer to believe that David's wife actually encouraged this sleazy rendezvous. Peckinpah seems to want us to think so, since Amy casts aspersions on David's manhood immediately before this incident. Surprisingly, Amy's misfortune is not the final straw that breaks the dog's back. Instead, a local criminal accidentally kills a local girl affiliated with the same village dregs making David's life miserable. Subsequent events find David providing sanctuary for this criminal as the thugs lay siege to the Sumner cottage. The result: a meek, educated man regresses into an animal capable of incredible violence.
""Straw Dogs"" moves at a glacial pace as Peckinpah builds tension through the encounters between the Sumners and the locals. The performances are generally good, with Hoffman standing out as the harassed mathematician who wants to leave well enough alone and finish his work. David Warner, a personal favorite, does a good job as the mentally challenged criminal Henry Niles. Unfortunately, Warner doesn't appear onscreen as much as I would have liked. The thugs are, well, thugs. Susan George, on the other hand, grates as Amy Sumner. I hated her character, a woman who is quick to push David into confrontation, calls into question his manhood when he resists her efforts, and then essentially stands back in the end by letting him face the goons all by himself. Amy's reacquaintance with her former boyfriend creates a sense of ambiguity on the part of the viewer towards Amy Sumner: on one level, you hate her for ""enjoying"" the crime, but on the other hand you feel for her when things go further than she anticipated. But you feel sorry only to a point, and perhaps that is what Peckinpah intended. I cannot help but think this director created the Amy character in order to express a deep-seated misogyny.
Overall, I liked ""Straw Dogs,"" but I wouldn't watch it again soon. I unfortunately watched the Anchor Bay DVD version, but a Criterion disc has since emerged sporting lots of extras that might shine a spotlight or two on the inner workings of the film. If you want to watch this picture, you should probably get that disc. Obviously, there won't be a Peckinpah commentary on the DVD (he's been dead for years), but Criterion does a good job with its releases.

Hoffman's performance especially towards the end of the film is amazing and is this film's only redeming quality in my opinion.

282029,4,6300251217,"Dustin Hoffman is a living legend. You can read any of the other excellent reviews here to get a good idea of what the movie is about, so instead I'm going to give you 'the truth as I see it' about why you should see this movie.
Obviously, Dustin Hoffman plays the role of David wonderfully. Susan George does a good job, although it would have been nice for this intended town hottie to have a pretty smile along with her pretty physique. But I guess that's the catch 22 in selecting a British cast, especially from that day and age.
The controversial rape scene in this movie, is almost paralyzingly disturbing. (Yes, paralyzingly...I don't care if it's not a word.) It's disgusting really. It was also very confusing for me, because of the fact that she was saying no, but the viewer actually does get the impression that she doesn't mean no. She kisses her 'rapist' and pulls him closer, and she invites him in in the first place, and then tells him not to leave. A very awkward occurrence. When the second guy rapes her, we understand clearly that she does not want him, but still she seems to have some strange bond with the first guy (apparently and ex-boyfriend or something) as they have a sort of strangely mutually understanding chemistry throughout the movie. This was one of the most disturbing scenes in any movie I've seen recently. It doesn't help that all the while we get up close facial expressions from her, showing a sense of horror and disgust, but at the same time thrilling satisfaction.
Basically, she gives in very easily when there is any sense of punishment as a consequence of resistance. She is trapped in a kind of school-girl mentality, playing childish pranks and teasing the men by showing her breasts and underwear to them. I'm guessing this is related to the way she was treated when she was that age. David, on the other hand, is a controlled, maturing man, trying to focus on his work. He doesn't give in so easily, and although some have said that he plays the role of mouse time and time again until he finally emerges as a 'real man' in the end of the movie, I personally feel that he is not the timid guy everyone thinks him to be, but rather that circumstance does not allow him to show his manliness (for example, when his wife brings in the bowl of milk with the beers). He is more confused than anything because he doesn't believe there is any real reason to confront the hooligans, until the execution of Kitty.
Anyway, like a lot of other people I was very confused by the ending. The implications of David defending his house, his wife, his honor, and his sense of manhood by protecting a man that actually was guilty of murder (albeit accidental), raise a whole other topic of discussion.
The violence, with the exception of the rape scene, is pretty tame according to today's standards, but the psychological horror is in full throttle here. This is a thinker's horror/suspense (not horror in the conventional sense of the word) movie.
The laughter of the crazy hooligan was really annoying to me. I'm sure many people will disagree with my views on the movie, but I think it's important to look at the movie for what it IS, as well as what it means.
I'm definitely glad to have seen this movie, and would highly recommend it, but I don't believe I'll be adding it to my collection. I might see it again one day, but movies this disturbing and confusing aren't usually on my list of favorite flicks to cuddle up to late at night.",1069113600,2,3480,4.534181240063593
282030,5,6300251217,"Straw Dogs is very loosely based on the book ""Siege at Trenchors Farm"". It is directed by Sam Pekinpah and it would be an understatement to say that this director is never shy to show a little blood in his movies. When this movie was released in 1971it is was critically acclaimed but also had its fair share of censorship problems. The movie was banned in the UK for almost 30 years afterwards and countless other countries cut it to ribbons before it could be shown on the screen or television.
Basically the story revolves around a quiet, shy, mathematician, David Summers played by Dustin Hoffman and his wife Amy played by Susan George, who move to the English countryside for some rest and relaxation in a house that belonged to her parents. They hire some men from the local village to help restore the house and some of these men have a past connection with Amy. They also display a talent for xenophobia and start to tease David and his wife. Back in the village Major John Scott a local policeman is having problems keeping some of the more rowdy villagers in their place. A simple man called Henry Niles, played by David Warner, is also taking an unhealthy interest in one of the village girls.
Basically the film is one big buildup to a siege at Davids home where he harbors a man who may have murdered someone in the town. He wants to turn him over to the justice officials but some of the town just want a lynch mob instead. David tries to overcome his cowardlines by making a final stand in his own home. The climax which lasts some twenty to thirty minutes is violent, graphic, bloody and shocking.
It is controversial because it contained a very realistic rape scene sequence for its time (1971), but this is not all that makes this film controversial. It also has scenes of child abuse, a few scenes with animal abuse (watch Hoffman smash an apple off the family cat), a blasphemous statement or two and an authority figure who gets the long end of a shotgun barrel. It is also very dogmatic showing a very brutal dumb countryside folk in stark contrast to David intelligent American. Even the local priest is treated as nothing more than a money grabber. All in all, this was enough for most censorship boards to be worried that the film may offend people and make no mistake about it - this is a very offensive film in very many ways.
Pekinpah wants us to be offended. He wants David to be offended. He wants to see how much we and our main protagonist can take before we finally break. Straw Dogs is one big boiling pot of hate and sooner or later it is going to exploded.... and it does.
Straw Dogs is a very original movie that makes a psychological impact. You have never seen anything like it before and you will probably never see anything like it again. Just do not buy into all the prejudice that is on display here. It is only just movie even though it seems all too real at times.

282031,5,6300251217,"Anyone who has ever wrote on the subject of movie violence has ackowledged Sam Peckinpah, both for this 1969 masterpiece ""The Wild Bunch"" and his gritty ""Straw Dogs"". Both are fantastic movies, but I have always loved ""Straw Dogs"" in particular. Criterion has finally done the movie justice with this superb DVD package, one that any serious movie collector would be proud to own.
This is the classic revenge formula, with a young American mathematician (Dustin Hoffman) and his sexy British wife (Susan George) moving to a small town in England and soon find themselves in battle with the drunken and brutish locals. Hoffman's character, as a mild-mannered bookworm, is contrasted by his later rage when he must defend himself and his home. The DVD cites this movie as ""a harrowing and masterful investigation of masculinity and the nature of violence"", which perfectly describes the tone of the film, as well as the intended message.
The violence in ""Straw Dogs"" is, while not overly graphic, potent nonetheless. It also has one of the most brutal rape scenes ever done on film. Both in terms of structure and content, ""Straw Dogs"" was well ahead of it's time. The acting is solid, and the script is beautifully written. The characters range from people we empathize with to people we love to hate. Despite the age (the movie was released in 1971), ""Straw Dogs"" never seems dated.
The Criterion DVD is packed with quality extras, starying with audio commentary by film scholar Stephen Prince. Thankfully, it is not overly intellectual, but also doesn't lack insight, and it quite easy to follow. The documentary ""Sam Peckinpah: Man of Iron"" is an interesting 80 minute documentary that has interviews with his friends and family. Although no footage from his movies is shown, and no interviews with the man himself, we get a lot of insight into Peckinpah's life and work. Next is the Behind-the-scenes footage, which is rough at times but still fun to watch. The Dustin Hoffman segment runs for 30 minutes.
Criterion have excelled themselves with ""Straw Dogs"", and you can expect to spend at least 4 hours with this DVD. The transfer is the best ever released, and the selection of extras makes this worth every penny. Essential.",1059177600,18,2231,4.9361702127659575
282032,5,6300251217,"This film gets excellent treatment in this DVD, despite the quibbles one might have over over-acadamized touches in some of the essay/commentary material, but I suppose that only goes to prove the film's impact and staying power.  Lots of interesting extras, well worth the investment, especially for Sam fans.
I have a mixed reaction to the voice-over commentary, much of which is interesting, some of which I find debatable.  I take exception to the idea that David is in fact the ""heavy"", though his passive-aggressive conduct is note-worthy.  Peckinpah may indeed have originated this notion, but he was known to be argumentative, and not always the most trustworthy interpreter of his own films (Major Dundee as Moby Dick in the desert?).
I think he may have been trying to down-play the idea of David as home-defending hero, which he knew would be a reaction, and was mainly planting the idea that the character wasn't all that admirable. I mean, if David's the heavy, who's the protagonist?
A quick glance at many of the non-academic reactions to the film's climactic sequence should give a clue as to whom the audience at least wants to root for. Maybe we're meant to be completely repulsed, and not pull for anyone in the final melee, but that's tough to do; I don't believe the case can be made that the local toughs are the good guys, anyway.
David Sumner is definitely the film's protagonist, and rather like Alex in the other infamously violent film released the same year, A Clockwork Orange, he attracts audience sympathy despite his flaws. The director needs for the audience to identify with someone in his story, while setting them up to question what that identification means.
Also, the voice-over guy is locked into a woman-good, man-bad mindset, at least in regard to the Amy and David couple.  According to the commentator, David is completely cold, uncaring, vicious, selfish, and other bad stuff, while Amy is his noble, all-virtuous victim.  Not only does this contradict the usual Peckinpah-as-misogynist stuff available in the ""Man of Iron"" documentary, but it goes against the director's running theme of violence and complicity.  He completely ignores Amy's role in pushing David into a more macho, violent stance - he only seems interested in finding ways to denigrate the David character, and you can hear his argument running out of steam toward the end.
As for ""Man of Iron"" - I had seen it broadcast some years ago, and recall being somewhat disappointed, though I appreciated it more on seeing it again.  It is rather rambling, with some I think dubious interiew subjects - the screenwriter Alan Sharp for instance, who apparently only worked on one picture with Peckinpah, which he seemed ashamed of, and otherwise didn't seem to really know the man or think too much of his work.  The documentary tends to go off on tangents, like the obligatory woman-hating and brutal-behaviour accusations, which go mostly unsupported here.  On the other hand, Kristofferson, Coburn, R.G. Armstrong, L.Q. Jones and others offer lots of interesting incidents and insights, and make it overall a valuable, touching look at the maverick filmmaker.",1054857600,2,3168,5.019047619047619
282033,2,6300251217,"I began reading this novel and couldn't get past the first 100 pages. It seemed like a good story though so I bought this DVD. Maybe it went over better in the 70's, but really this movie is just not good. While watching it with a friend, we had to fight back the urge to hit the next chapter button. It just seemed a very slow and dull movie. Even when there is action, it's kind of boring. When all the men attack the house, Dustin Hoffman sets up many traps and it's pretty much just a 1970's Home Alone. I think Home Alone is better though.",1054857600,7,544,4.093457943925234
282034,5,6300251217,"This is probably not his best known film. Yet again, Sam Peckinpah is not very known at all outside his audience or film majors. But you cant deny his wit and style that influenced many filmmakers in the generations that followed with his distinct ways. Straw DogsEwas also released the same year as A Clockwork OrangeE giving us 2 violent classics in one year. Many blamed Straw DogsEfor glamorizing a violent lifestyle, and using violent images as a way to rebel and/or entertain audiences. From the rape scene to the violent end, images haunt you. Especially the way Peckinpah intercut shots of the rape scene further into the film, almost subliminally with a single frame.
But Peckinpah did not use this movie to glamour violence, but only to show how much it can destroy one self, and hurt others in the process. It is more about growth, of how a man who could not stand up for himself in the past can transform into almost a monstrosity of power in his own self defense. At the same time distancing himself from what he used to be, and coping with what he has become. This is not glamorous. He shows how this can be very dangerous. But if you were in the same shoes as David Sumner (Dustin Hoffman), would you do the same? Or if you were a friend of Davids before the movie, would you still befriend the David after the closing credits?
This is distinctly a Peckinpah film with a psychological twist. And only human. Many layers are involved and can definitely use multiple viewings. Image Entertainment released this movie a while back bare-boned and non-anamorphic. Criterion Collection got the rights and preserved this the way it is meant to be.
The restoration is unbelievably good, and it probably has not sounded or looked this good since its premier in 1971. But all in all, its all about the supplements. An intriguing booklet with tons of essays and an interview with the ever-stubborn Peckinpah is also included. The second disc is filled with material, including recent interviews with Susan George and Daniel Melnick, and an on-location interview with Dustin Hoffman (the new It GuyEin cinema) from 1971 BBC. But the BBC documentary Man Of IronEstands out the most. An intriguing documentary about one of the most influential directors who ever lived, with many clips of friends and family tell stories of the directors style and might, trying to explain his material to censors, critics, and audiences and his ultimately lonely end.
Criterion has done extremely well on this one. This one is too good to leave on the shelf, and especially with the fact that this DVD will only be around until 2004 (supposedly). THIS IS THE WAY A CLASSIC UNDERAPPRECIATED MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE TREATED. Thank you Criterion, you answered many fans of cinema, and Peckinpah.
Best Shot/Sequence:
You HAVE to watch the movie in its entirety to understand this. The very scene, where David is driving Niles away, and Niles says I don't know my way homeE David tells him that Its OKE For a while he pauses and grins and tells Niles I don't eitherE It was arguably Dustin Hoffmans best deliverance in a movie, and the PERFECT conclusion to the movie which was adlibbed, and not even the original ending of the book (which was too happily ever after at the end).",1053734400,,3259,4.729349736379613

282036,4,6300251217,"In 1971 Sam Peckinpah's controversial STRAW DOGS was censored by the British Board of Film Classification.  The cuts made it even more provocative than Peckinpah intended.  Consequently, Straw Dogs was labeled by the media as an obscene, misogynistic piece of filmmaking. Regarding the uncut American version, even the esteemed Pauline Kael said it's ""the first American film that is a fascist work of art.""

""Straw Dogs"" stands as one of Peckinpah's best, and a reminder of the ongoing struggle between an artist's freedom  and suppression by the powers that be.  But more than that, it's a brilliant and harrowing exploration of man's primitive animal nature and its implied, inherent violence.

In 1971, this brilliant film galvanized critics and audiences alike.  The new unrated hi-def version allows for moments of even more explicit sex and violence that actually enhance the rhythm and intensity of this disturbing meditation on the will to survive.

The Blu-ray looks very nice. Missing are the interesting DVD extras that included an 80 minute look at Peckinpah's films and a new interview with Susan George, who talks about her daring, controversial performance of a woman who -- for a few brief moments -- seemed to enjoy being raped.

What does the phrase ""Straw Dogs"" mean?  Is it from the saying: Behind every coward's eyes burn straw dogs? If so, what does that mean? What are ""straw dogs""?",1049241600,2,1406,5.073913043478261
282057,4,6300251217,"This 1971 film was considered so violent that it was banned in the U.K. at the time.  I can understand why, especially since a group of British ruffians are shown in a bad light.  Yes.  I found it violent.  And yet it is more than that.  It's a psychological study of the hero turning from mouse to man.
Dustin Hoffman stars as a quiet mathematician who moves to England with his wife, Susan George, for peace and quiet and time to work on his studies.  A gang of young toughs harasses them with dire results.  Time after time Dustin Hoffman refuses to take a stand against them.  Susan George taunts her husband, picks fights with him and tries to compete with his love of mathematics.  Eventually, the violence against them escalates and Dustin is forced to defend his home.
I found the beginning slow but this was the director, Sam Pickenpah's intention.  The tension mounts slowly and then, when it does erupt, it bursts forth with horror. The acting was excellent even though the situation seemed a bit overdone.  Mostly I enjoyed it for its historical significance because I know that this kind of film wouldn't be made today.  That's because the role for the wife is nothing less than that of a stereotypical female.  She doesn't have any meaningful work or interests of her own other than trying to get her husband's interest and flaunting her body in front of the workingmen.  She is whiney and weak and has big tears in her eyes most of the time.  Finally, at the end, she somewhat redeems herself, but she is definitely an unlikable character.  And so is Dustin Hoffman, until he decides to let out the straw dog of violence, which has been locked up in him for a lifetime.
I was disturbed by the film, which held my interest throughout, and feel it certainly was well done. I do recommend it but even though it was good, I feel there is better stuff around.",1048636800,13,1869,4.534328358208955
282058,5,6300251217,"Visceral...that is this film in a nutshell.  The main question is how in the world Hoffman and George's characters EVER got married.  They have no chemistry and absolutely nothing in common.  But get beyond this relationship and this film builds with wonderful intensity.  It is a test for both Hoffman's character as well as George's to have the marriage be rocked by the old male ""freinds"" and to see Susan George's character slowly slip away from David because he is not ""man enough"" to put an end to the Brits' unacceptable behavior.  She has lost her civility now that she is back on her home turf (a real irony since they came from the USA, where we are so much more barbaric than our UK bretheren).  Only when the constable is killed and you really feel that all hope is truly lost does Dustin hop into action.  And he really takes over and ""proves"" that he is a real man.  Okay, so it is sort of a macho trip, but it is one of the most intense films of the 70s, certainly Peckinpah's best in my opinion.  This DVD version is a rehash of the laserdisc, the print is identical to the Japanese letterbox import laserdisc.  I bought Hoffman's character all the way.  The locals are wonderfully menacing in a covert way.  Very well done...and a lot of credit goes to the editing for this pacing.",1041120000,2,1298,4.453389830508475
282059,5,6300251217,"Though the film's graphic violence created quite a stir upon its initial release and therefore got most of the critical attention, this is a movie with surprising depth of character and meaning. There is so much going on just beneath the surface that you might want to view it several times to let it all sink in. I think this is Peckinpah's finest film--one that raises vital questions about violence and the people who must resort to it. STRAW DOGS is an underrated masterpiece, just as powerful now as it was in 1971.",1040947200,,520,4.602150537634409
282060,3,6300251217,"Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs is set in deepest darkest Cornwall among a collection of yokels and idiots that would give the inbreds from Deliverence a run for their money in the half witted sexual deviant stakes. Leaving aside obvious grievances that the Cornwall Tourist Board will have with the film, what lies beneath the surface of this slick and stylish Western-by-the-sea ia a far more intriguing, puzzling and reasonably disturbing proposition. Taking residence in the quiet, backwoods (surely backwards?) English county with his English wife, Amy (Susan George), mathematician David Summer (Dustin Hoffman) is hoping the peaceful rural surroundings will help him finish a theory he is working on. Just one problem - this is Amy's birth place, and the couple are soon stirring the attentions of the locals, particularly Amy's ex-boyfriend. And the attentions are not exactly welcome.
 Peckinpah's odyssey of masculine enlightenment is troubling in a number of ways. There, is of course, the now infamous rape scene, itself considered too daring by UK censors for the best part of twenty years due to its ""she likes it really"" philosophy. This may grab all the headlines, but the real trouble here is with the issues this, and the later siege at the cottage, present to the audience.
 Straw Dogs is essentially a film about the empowering effect of affirmative action, of violence. In its exploration of primal urges and instinct it probably shares more in common with a film such as Fight Club than the 'Rape' films of its era, such as Clockwork Orange, with which it is constantly and unfairly bracketed. Peckinpah's film is a much darker and more intriguing piece than Kubrick's modern morality fable, but intrigue does not always guarantee satisfaction. He is grappling with a serious and sensitive idea here, and he has to be applauded for his bravery in doing so, although Peckinpah was never one to shy away from 'difficult' issues. But for all his intentions (good or otherwise) it is maybe this gung-ho, no holds barred balls in hand attitude that is the films flaw. The final scene, in which David, who has for the majority of the film been avoiding any kind of conversation, much to the annoyance of Amy, dispatches the various locals who are attempting to break into his house in a variety of gruesome ways, is probably the most troubling. As he drives away from the scene, David allows himself a self-satisfied smile. He has become empowered, more of a 'man'. This, allied to the rape scene's ""she likes a bit of rough"" sentiments seem to create a rather simplistic and quite ugly moral philosophy. Amy is raped by her ex, who to her is the symbol of the rugged primal male psyche which she has for too long been deprived of from David. Men should be men and anyway thats how women want them to be, regardless of whatever deeper implications others may place on the film, seems really to be its message.
 The blame for this can really only be pointed at one man, Sam Peckinpah. Peckinpah is one of America's greatest directors, but his mysoginistic tendencies hamper his handling of a complex matter. The film is fascinating, watchable, interesting and nigh on essential for followers of cinema, but it is hard to watch it without being confused by its intentions, and without taking away a slightly sour taste in the mouth.
 It would be difficult to call the film an honourable failure, so an interesting one would be more appropriate. Still, imagine what would have happened if Hitchcock had directed it... I dread to think.",1040515200,5,3543,4.89018302828619
282061,5,6300251217,"Forget THE WILD BUNCH, personally I found STRAW DOGS to be the crowning achievement of Sam Peckinpah's career. An American mathematician (Dustin Hoffman) and his sexy British wife Susan George are tired of the violence of the US so move to the wife's home town in England. What seems to be an idyllic new beginning is shattered when they find themselves harrassed by several local hooligans. Watching STRAW DOGS is like being subjected to chinese water torture, Peckinpah builds the tension slowly and with such expertise that though everybody knows what is going to happen to the couple it's a matter of WHEN.  The violence is not glamorised, nor as graphic as the likes of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. I'm not a huge geek or anything, but I will say that this is the type of movie intellectuals pee their pants over and debate over tiny cups of espresso in arty-farty cafes. As more of a beer and meatball sub kinda guy I'll spare you the varisty style nonsense and say that STRAW DOGS is a definite must-see, with Hoffman giving one of his best performances (which is REALLY saying something considering the likes of LENNY, PAPILLON etc etc). Peckinpah has never been darker (or better).",1033603200,4,1183,4.714975845410628

""Honey, do you remember that summer down in the country when I slaughtered half the population of a village for breaking and entering? You suffered a bit of that yourself. Do you remember how I left you alone in the house to take the crazy guy home and forget all about that guy who only had a bit of his foot blown off and so was probably still alive and dangerous? I think they call it a plot hole, sugar. Say, this pasta is great."" Mind you, their relationship would have been hard pressed to have survived all that, so grandchildren would have been an unlikely prospect.
This film sticks out like a sore thumb even for the Seventies. There's no film quite like it. Incredibly, it has only just been cleared in the UK by the film classification board after years of banning despite once being freely available. I have a video copy. I'm embarrassed to report that the board consultated a couple of psychologists as to whether they thought the rape scene might be harmful to the public. I love democracy, don't you? An un-elected body consulting a profession that can't even agree if there is such a thing as personality disorder or an Oedipus complex to decide for millions what they can and can't see certainly takes the proverbial dog biscuit. Luckily for us, quack central past the scene as not harmful. Yes, but what if you already have a personality disorder? Still, you can now speculate about the notorious scene for yourself, soon. Was she faking it because she feared for her life? Did she have split loyalties right from the start? Gosh, I'm not touching it with a bargepole. The film, I mean. No, that's cowardly. Basically, when confronted by a bully you have two options, one of which is appeasement. Amy takes this option and is then taught a traumatic lesson. Still not willing to confront the lesson she attempts to repeat her mistake until her husband stops her and spells out what would happen to the pair of them if she carries out this option. Only when finally forced to take up arms does she qualitively learn. Is this the only way ultimately to deal with terrorists? There's little doubting the director's perspective, but what's yours?
The atmosphere of Straw Dogs is horrible from the start. I rarely watch it because of this. The editing is brilliant, the script strong and it lacks that distancing effect you get with most films. It is uncomfortably real. Should this have been the film to be titled THE OMEN? The brother grabbing his sister by the neck as they watch the couple in the cottage get into bed. The trap nearly springing on Charlie as the workmen try to put it on the cottage wall. Aspects of a cowboy movie filter through creating a bizarre atmosphere. Preposterous plotting means the film is best viewed as a strange nightmare, with human beings reduced to and even turning into rats before our very eyes.",1030060800,2,2925,4.648648648648648
282063,3,6300251217,"STRAW DOGS is a violent movie, but it is not the mindless violence that littered the streets of Charles Bronson's DEATH WISH. It is a movie about the violence that is pent up in one's soul only to released in a controlled manner. Dustin Hoffman has made a career of playing the intellectual urban New Yorker. In STRAW DOGS he is the married more mature Benjamin Braddock of THE GRADUATE. He lives in America, happily married to a sexy Susan George. Despairing of living in a country that he came to see as increasingly violent, he and his wife move to her country in Wales, where she encounters a former boyfriend. While Dustin is out of town, in walks the boyfriend, and within minutes, what the audience thought might turn into a graphic rape scene instead morphed into a graphic condemnation of his wife's chastity. Their clothing hits the floor and the wife stands revealed as an adulteress. Clueless Dustin at first suspects nothing, then he gets involved both in protecting a retarted man, well played by the perennial villain, David Warner, from a lynch mob, and escaping from the a group of Welsh hooligans who seek now to murder both him and his wife. These local toughs are seen as being tough in body but weak in mind...
 STRAW DOGS shows the difference between a man who can control his violence and release it only as needed and one who allows his violence to control him. When a wandering wife is added to this mixed brew, the result is often the closing scene of a movie that can be repeated in real life too.",1026259200,,1524,4.541818181818182
282064,5,6300251217,"What makes the violence so powerful is the source of it. And the source of it all is Susan George. She is a beautiful and sexy blonde who all the rural lads remember from her youth and they are all jealous of Dustin Hoffman who is the American who has won her. Susan George and Dustin Hoffman seem a hopeless mismatch and she seems to know it before he does. She is just an English country girl and she resents that he is trying to make her in to a female version of himself, ie a more intellectual, responsiblespectacle wearing chess player. What she has that he underestimates the worth of is sensual appeal. And when he doesn't pay attention she advertises to any man near by just to prove she has it.
The way Peckinpah sets up the Hoffman/George relationship it is almost assured to lead to trouble. Instead of having Hoffman and George fight it out between themselves Peckinpah has them wage their war through the hired hands which are little more than hoods recognizing the opportunities when they present themselves.
George has a past with one of the lads and she does not exactly resist his advances and this is just more proof that things are not all well in her marriage. Though things go much much further than she had perhaps anticipated.
The atmosphere of the movie is great. The village is tiny, just a pub and a few houses. And the stone English country house that Hoffman and George rent for the year is like a small castle and decorated with weapons. The final confrontation is country manor warfare at its most intense. The final result is cathartic but feels more like an exhilerated confusion than a clear resolution.
Acting wise Hoffman is magnificent but George is also great displaying a wide range of moods and motivations.
Other movies have shown more violence than this one but still the violence in this one is of a very particular type, the type that Peckinpah suggests is seething below the surface of many man/woman relationships. Whether you agree with Peckinpahs assessment or not the movie is a charged and memorable one.",1017360000,8,2054,4.645604395604396
282065,4,6300251217,"Yeah, some people would like to like this movie.  It's great film-making at its worse.  You are not entertained, but hung somewhere between a visceral viewing of Schindler's List and a car race in which, deep down, you're waiting for a fatal crash.  This isn't some Brit-Western with a triumphant hero and a defeated villain.  This isn't a mob movie with likeable bad guys.  Every second of this movie is violence.  It starts out as a game--i.e. the children playing in the open scene, the recurring game of catch between a young girl and Henry the pedaphile, Dustin Hoffman hurling fruit at the household cat, Henry kills the young girl, Hoffman's nearly-adolescent wife erasing part of his blackboard, etc.  It soons turns cruel--the killing of the cat, wife Amy's defacing of Hoffman's blackboard out of SPITE.  As Hoffman remarks several times ""it's not a game"" anymore.  Soon, the viewer is scandalized--nearly duped by the director's subversive desensitization of violence.  But one shouldn't feel duped or desensitized.  Especially, when one considers that the characters are scandalized by each other, by themselves, by the director.  Amy is raped, Hoffman strikes Amy, everyone is trying to kill everyone--and even as Hoffman vows that ""no one will do violence against this house"", he proceeds to destroy it in order to kill the others...only to save the life of the guy who during the Hoffman's Last Stand, also tried to rape his wife.  Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange"" was released during the same time as ""Straw Dogs"".  Kubrick, predictably, decided to leave out the final chapter of the harrowing novel--in which Alex is as genuinely reformed as he can be, repetent and at peace.  In making America's ""VIOLENCE"" film, perhaps no director wants any sort of resolution.  This is, above all, an antithethical philosophy on cinematic violence.  No heros to feel good about, no victory we can stomach.  Director Peckinpah walks a fine line with this movie--but succeeds if this is his goal.  No one leaves without be completely bloodied, no one leaves with their innoncence--not least of which, the viewer.

282132,5,6300251217,"Aside from the notoriety, and aside from the viciousness (the film leaves you most of all with a taste of viciousness in your mouth, a sour, bitter, metallic taste, akin to that feeling you get reading ""The Tin Drum"", the piece of metal stuck in the back of your throat), what you get from ""Straw Dogs"" is a manifestation of personal demons (specifically, Sam Peckinpah's personal demons, but also, both more generally and more acutely, masculine demons) and an exploration of a certain type of male sexuality.
To do the film justice, you need to plug your brain in.  Which, on the surface, may not appear to be the case, because the story - what it is - is relatively simple.  It's an English western.
David, a mathematician (Dustin Hoffman), is on sabbatical from the university where he teaches.  He has left the states and returned with his wife Amy, (Susan George) to the tiny English village in which she grew up.  From the word go, David has to contend with the fact that Amy has a history in the town.  He also has to contend with the fact that she is younger than him, and bored.  Her boredom serves as a distraction from the reason behind his sabbatical.  Amy on the other hand has to live with a quiet, ""odd"" American who does not give her the attention she requires.
Within the town, there are various echoes at work: there is a character called Niles, played by David Warner, who has a known history of problems relating with women (to the extent that he has served time for undisclosed offences); there are the locals, who divide their time between procrastinating over work on David and Amy's roof, and leering at Amy (who periodically informs David about the effect she has on them, how they ""lick her all over with their eyes""); and there is David himself, spending a little more time than he really should looking at teenager Sally Thomsett.
All of which feeds into the terrible rape scene (a scene of which Peckinpah is quoted as saying - in the excellent biography ""If it moves . . . kill 'em"" - ""I wanted to film the best rape scene ever"" - a line ripe with complexity and moral disorder): Amy is raped by Charlie, leader of the leering locals, who may or may not be her childhood sweetheart (two earlier scenes indicate that (a) something went on years earlier and (b) Charlie took it further then than Amy was happy with).
At some point during the awful protracted rape, for whatever reason (and there is something manifest at work in her face, palpably desire but desire for what - who knows?) she stops fighting and starts (ugly this, but true - this is what happens in the film:) - starts to participate.  The participation is taken (by some) to be a playing out of a certain retrogressive masculine attitude (that all women - deep down etc etc etc).  However you interpret it - and it does require interpretation, importantly - the participation is at the dark heart of ""Straw Dogs""' notoriety.  The fact that this is followed by the appearance of a second man, and a second rape, only compounds the difficulty - the cloudiness - that will inevitably surround any attempt to precisely articulate what is going on here.
At which point, the echoes become still more manifest: you have Niles, despised because of his weakness for young girls (and as such - in the context of the character's lives - a ""bad"" man), you have the men who rape Amy (a fact that remains undisclosed within the body of the film), men who later attempt to avenge themselves on Niles (in a vivid reworking of ""Of Mice and Men""), and you have David - a man in whom, perhaps, all of these violent urges conflict.
The film culminates in a series of extremely violent (and ridiculous) altercations, veering wildly between extremes (shotguns firing off left, right and centre, characters riding tricycles and playing bagpipe records, mantraps, boiling fat, fire, pokers, broken glass, wire).  But the central relationship - the whole dynamic of the film - between David and Amy continues to fight definition, remaining ultimately unresolved and unclear.
In the end, aside of everything else (aside of the fact that this film lingers with you, you do not watch ""Straw Dogs"" and leave it at that, those ""Straw Dogs"" take up residence with you, for a while), you have the fact that this film would not get made today - the Dustin Hoffman character is too complex and too unsympathetic, and there are too many (coldly intellectual) questions raised by what goes on.
It is dissatisfying but intentionally so: this is Peckinpah's ""Salo"": it demonstrates that resolution is the most ugly abstraction, that what gets wrapped up leaves the viewer with no space for thought: that which is left open, is that which remains discussed.  At the end, almost a week after last watching the film, I am reminded of what Ian McEwan wrote in his novel ""Black Dogs"": ""...I came face to face with evil. I didn't quite know it at the time, but I sensed it in my fear - these animals were the creations of debased imaginations, of perverted spirits no amount of social theory could account for. And . . .when conditions are right . . . a terrible cruelty, a viciousness against life erupts, and everyone is surprised by the depth of hatred within . . . (But) This is what I know: Human nature, the human heart, the spirit, the soul, the consciousness itself - call it what you like - in the end, it's all we've got to work with.  It has to develop and expand, or the sum of our misery will never diminish.""
That is - at last - ""Straw Dogs""' role: to develop, to expand, to show us what can be, what needn't be, but what is, and hope that something else (not necessarily finer) but something else, prevails.",1006300800,119,5675,4.590325765054295
282133,5,6300251217,"The first contemporary film made by Sam Peckinpah, whose five previous movies were all westerns, STRAW DOGS, in its study of how one seemingly mild-mannered man (in this case Dustin Hoffman) can be driven to defend himself through extreme violence, can, in my belief, be classified as a sociological and psychological horror film.
Released in late 1971, at the same time as Stanley Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, STRAW DOGS caused an enormous amount of debate on both sides of the Atlantic concerning not only its violence, but also the horrific rape scene involving Hoffman's wife (Susan George), which got the film banned in England, where Peckinpah made it.  Both Kubrick's and Peckinpah's films differ from each other, in that Kubrick's is a more political allegory and Peckinpah's is philosophical--and yet both films are, in their own ways, masterpieces.
Peckinpah, in a stroke of pure genius, with the exception of the hideous rape scene, holds off on his typical slow-motion violence until the climactic siege, where Hoffman has to protect a mental patient (David Warner) from a band of drunk hooligans.  This sequence is still nerve-shattering and violent, brilliantly edited, shot, and acted, with Peter Vaughan making for one of the most frightening heavies ever.
Besides the acting, the other fine points of STRAW DOGS are the ominous cinematography of John Coquillon, who also shot the low-budget 1968 British horror film THE WITCHFINDER GENERAL, and a brilliantly haunting Stravinsky/Herrmann-influenced music score by Peckinpah's favorite composer Jerry Fielding.  STRAW DOGS is not an easy movie to watch or to like, but for those so inclined, it is very much worth seeing.",994377600,13,1688,5.267657992565056

Wife is brutally raped but there's no repercussions for this act,  She doesn't tell anyone about it...pedophile murders a girl and ends up in Dustin's house.  Drunken Brits after the pedophile/murderer surround Dustin's house (the same ones who raped his wife) with guns.

I'll press charges!""  Just stupid stupid story.  Two seperate stories would have probably made two halfway decent movies but this mishmash makes no sense.  How about Dustin's wife is raped and they get revenge on the monsters responsible...or, take out Dustin all together, pedophile murders girl and town goes nuts killing him.  This stinkburger ends up with everyone dead but Dustin, his wife & the pedophile.  Stupid stupid stupid movie.  And the end!  Dustin rides off in the sunset with the pedophile leaving his wife alone in a house with a bunch of dead people.  Don't waste your time.

282135,3,6300251217,"Call me old fashioned but I believe when violence is used in a movie it should be done with integrity as a vehicle for expressing something greater than itself and not merely for its own sake. Kubrick succeeded brilliantly in doing this in a Clockwork Orange wherein the movies violence is used reflectively as an incisive critique on the ineffectiveness of criminal law control methods. No such redeeming qualities are to be found in Straw Dogs and even the fine performance given here by master duffus Dustin Hoffman is but frugal conpensation for the insipid violent innuedo that is this film.  Hoffman plays an American mathmatics prodigy who has recently moved to a small Northern English village to share a house with his nubile young companion. He hires local men to do some restorations on the house, one of whom proclaims to have had previous carnal relations with his employers mistress. Tensions arise, beer is split, guns come out of the closet (and a dead cat too- don't ask), testostorone needs an outlet and by the end all bloody hell breaks loose.  We are given next to no information about our protagonists past or reasons for leaving the States and none whatsoever about his girlfriend. Their relationship seems totally arbitrary; he the high brow professor, she a bubble gum munching dilettante they are diametrical opposites with nothing shared in common save the mutal need for sex. It's a gross missreckonig of the filmaker to blithely assume the viewer should be expected to care about such scantily developed characters.  Why three stars then? Peckinhams depiction of the repressed English characters ""stiff upper lip"" demeanour is bang on and worth some merit. Likewise he succeeds brilliantly in exposing the clash between two vastly different cultures. In terms of emotional impact this film will leave the viewer exhausted by it's end. Usually thats tantamount to a having a satisfactory movie going experience here it merely leaves the viewer feeling he's been swindled out of his emotions and asking by the films end ""What was the whole point?""",984528000,4,2074,5.023255813953488

282137,4,6300251217,"The packaging for this DVD shows the futility of banning the film. The slogan `Banned in the UK' can be used the world over as a means of selling the film. It is assumed that the film will consequently be ultra-violent, but this is a misconception. This film is not banned because of its gruesome conclusion, but solely because of the rape scene. I recently saw an interview with the British censor who explained his reasoning. He argued that the scene is unacceptable because it advocates the `male myth' that a woman will enjoy rape. The film could have been distributed with some cuts, but the studio, quite rightly, turned down this option. The absurdity of the censor's position is that there are other films freely available which have rape scenes which show a woman apparently enjoying rape, including Doctor Zhivago and High Plains Drifter. Moreover, Susan George's character in Straw Dogs can hardly be said to have enjoyed the experience in the end. She is left distraught and broken. It is a great pity that this film is banned in Britain, for it is a film of great artistic worth. It is not as if this is some cheap little sordid film, rather it one of the key works of a great director. I found the film interesting because it develops its story in a gradual way allowing time for characters to develop. The final dnouement has all the more power because of this build up. It is worth noting that there is some confusion regarding the setting of this film. It is supposed to be Cornwall, in the Southwest of England. This is clear from the accents of the British actors. This DVD has no extras, but at least it shows the film in its complete version. The picture quality is fine and only the sound is a little unclear at times.

I saw this movie twice when it came out and once again recently. It's true, as others have noted, that what was so shocking in '71 seems pretty much par for the course by today's standards (though I still wouldn't call it ""tame"" exactly). At the time, it certainly seemed like a blow to the peace and love ethic of the 60s.
As a visceral experience, the movie retains quite a bit of power. As a character study, it seems a bit heavy handed today. It's also a bit sketchy (e.g. just why DID they come to Cornwall anyway?).  Still recommended as an early-70s artifact and as an important work in both Hoffman's and Peckinpah's oeuvres.

There is truly no other film like this. Sam Peckinpah is such a great director and he did a great job with this. It has all of the usual trademark elements of his films such as slow motion, violence and a haunting Jerry Fielding score.  This comes straight out of 71 along with Clockwork Orange and Get Carter which was quite a year for tough and bleak films. The script is great and the violence while controversial is very well shot. Dustin Hoffman is quite convincing as the American being hounded by the local farmers.  All in all I would say that this film is not for everyone but it is still a classic.",979862400,4,761,4.170068027210885
282141,5,6300251217,"Benjamin Braddock meets Alex and the Droogs.  This movie has some of the tightest and most blood-curdling sequences of any thriller, thanks largely to the crisp editing.  The final, extended home invasion sequence (and I don't mean ""home invasion"" as the current trendy euphemism for ""burglary"" -- I mean a literal, terrifying home invasion) is particularly harrowing because the quick cutting constantly throws you off:  what are you seeing now, and for how long?  It was criticized at the time for its fascistic view of humanity, but I think the movie earns its stance (unlike ""Dirty Harry,"" which came out at the same time and was considerably clumsier).  The rape scene is also particularly incendiary to a lot of folks, but remember, although Susan George's character might ask for it, that doesn't mean all women ask for it.  The important thing is that she's a consistent character from the start.  It's a fiction, not a polemic.
My biggest complaint:  The finale is precipitated by an incident lifted too freely from ""Of Mice and Men"" -- it pulls you out of the story because everything else has been so original.
One of my favorite moments:  the chilling sense of portent when we see the shadowy visage of the village priest at the celebration as he reads the line, ""...and all the saints.""",978652800,,1299,4.841628959276018
282192,4,6300251217,"A key film in launching the ""Death Wish"" era,""Straw Dogs"" nonetheless deals with its subject in a much more thoughtful manner than subsequent formula pics of the genre. Dustin Hoffman is in top form as the nebbishy urban American who moves to the native countryside of his English-born wife,shagadelic 70's sex kitten Susan George. Sam Peckinpah quickly precedes to take this ""Green Acres"" scenario and turn it into ""Village of the Damned"". This sleepy little hamlet claims an inordinate number of inbred thugs as residents, including several who appear to share a seedy history with Hoffman's bride. The resulting intimidations and confrontations escalate to the inevitable, much-discussed ""Taxi Driver""-ish baptism of blood finale. Curiously, the popularity of 1999's ""Fight Club"" makes ""Straw Dogs"" suddenly seem less dated, as it is a similar attempt to deconstuct the eternally conflicted definitions of ""masculinity"". Look for an early, memorable performance by David Warner as a ""Mice And Men"" Lenny-type character. An unsettling but worthwhile film.",975888000,6,1057,5.530864197530864

Dustin Hoffman is a mild-mannered (to put it mildly) mathematician who is incongruously married to a former town-pump.  Having made the mistake of moving to the Cornish village she once called home, he is summarily tested in his manhood by various village ""types,"" most of whom the British critics found outrageous and/or stereotypical.

282195,4,6300251217,"It's a fascinating pleasure to discover little by little and scene after scene the western hidden behind the contemporary tragedy described by STRAW DOGS. Director Sam Peckinpah plays a subtle game with us by titillating our  memories and our love for movies. Firstly, the different spots where the  action takes place should ring a bell in each one of us : for example, just  imagine the pub's customers with stetsons and jeans and you will see in  front of you a saloon with the sheriff, the barman and the usual bad  boys.
Maybe, in certain scenes of STRAW DOGS, like the attack of Dustin  Hofmann's house -very FORT APACHE or RIO BRAVO like- or the description of  the lynchers of Charlie, the codes Hollywood directors used during 50 years  in thousands of westerns are more manifest. Anyway, we have understood that  Sam Peckinpah wants us to watch STRAW DOGS not only in the first  degree.
So, the scene of Susan George's rape should not have created so  much anger in our beloved critics. I sincerely think that, for most of us,  it's impossible to identify ourselves with the rapists. Sam Peckinpah,  before this crucial scene, has patiently described these drunken stupid  guys with their libidos hanging from their tongues and their below-average  intellectual level. Now, it must also be admitted that Sam Peckinpah isn't  an admirer of women's characters, at least in his movies, and that the  three women of STRAW DOGS do not specially give a rewarding image of our  beloved partners. Period.
So enjoy without any guilt STRAW DOGS in this  great transfer brought by Anchor Bay. As sole extra-feature, a scene access  (thank you so much !).

282196,3,6300251217,"Sam Peckinpah's ""Straw Dogs"" is a film that should be seen because of it's incredible realism. It's not as good as his other masterpiece, ""Bring Me The Head Of Alfredo Garcia,"" but it's  still alright. The screenplay and story are sort of weak, because they're  not complex enough. ""Straw Dogs,"" however, does succeed because  it shows violence and primal viciousness with a realism that few films have  captured. Like the best films of Oliver Stone and Luis Bunuel, Peckinpah  shows violence with a realism that hits hard and is hard to forget. This is  a study of violence and what can lead men to violence, or the primal  instinct to protect one's home. The script could have used one more  re-write or more thinking. Some strong events take place that never have  any important later in the story. Particulalrly one intense scene where the  hero's wife is raped in their home while he's away by one of the hoods, we  might think this is crucial, but it never has any real importance in the  rest of the story. I think Peckinpah was more interested in the surrealism  than the story, and in that area he works. This in a sense, is a bad movie,  but the violence is so real and effective that it elevates it into an  effective and disturbing film. It should be seen for the surrealism above  anything else.",950400000,,1308,4.573275862068965
282197,5,6300251217,"People seem to love or hate this movie.  I love it.  Dustin Hoffman plays professor on ""sabbatical"" to write a book on astronomy and computers.  There is some allusion to his having been driven to his sabbatical (or from his job) because of his refusal to take a stand over  some undefined issue at his place of employment. In any case, he retreats  to a farmhouse in rural England with his pretty wife, played by Susan  George.
When some of the local underemployed thugs start bullying  him--(The script and Peckinpah's direction of the actors hits  bull's-eye here; having lived in England, I saw the same sort of  behavior--punks all over, I guess, have mannerisms of bullying peculiar to  their culture.)
The violent climax to this film is--you hate to say  it--beautiful. It certainly isn't gorey by today's standards.  This, perhaps, is what makes people so uncomfortable about this movie--their own reaction to the violence.  Hoffman conveys wonderfully both the fear and the satisfaction his character is experiencing.
At one level, this film exists as a simple tale of revenge.  At another level, the movie affirm's Peckinpah's vision of violence as a rite of manhood.  Whether this rite is a regrettable one . .  . well, that remains arguable, and this ambiguity is part of what makes this such a watchable, and re-watchable, movie.",948240000,171,1342,4.95067264573991

Peckinpah was a hard man, and his vision of life and humanity  is shown in Straw Dogs, you may agree with him or not, but you will have to  accept the basic concept: in the heart of every coward, burns a beast, a  straw dog. And Peckinpah says in his movie that when you are caught in a  dangerous situation, you change, and you are capable to kill or do anything  in order to survive. No one did it better than this filmmaker, maybe  Boorman with Deliverance, but Straw Dogs is a cruel testimony of the  cruelty that common men are capable to do. Hoffman is terrific, and in the  end, when his house and wife are in danger, his whole coward character  changes, and he turns into a explosive and brutal murderer. Susan George  carries on a difficult part, the scene of the rape is one of the most  shocking and complex images of the seventies.
