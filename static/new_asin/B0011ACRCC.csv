8241218,3,B0011ACRCC,"I would say that these are lacking because they ate the very same videos with different covers on the outside case except for the one Titled Aliens among us with poor graphics and this one but there is no proof that Billy Meier ever was actually on another planet as the person that is explaining it in the video whoever the bald guy is, he relating it all in the past tense. I am a bit dissapointed with the production and presentation.",1427673600,,437,4.341463414634147
8241219,3,B0011ACRCC,"Twenty-six years ago, Michael Horn saw and purchased a coffee table book about Billy Meier that sparked an interest in the man he calls a prophet, a latter-day incarnate of the same spirit of Jesus. Meier lives on a compound in Switzerland to stay safe from death threats, and continues to receive information from the extra-terrestrials called Plejaren. It would be helpful to have the story of Billy Meier recounted at the beginning, for those not already familiar, but his current status is well discussed. This DVD is one in a series of lectures filmed during the 2003 International Scientific and Metaphysical Symposium in Brisbane, Australia.",1350777600,,648,5.122641509433962
8241220,3,B0011ACRCC,"Reviews for this DVD seem to hint at a lecture that will present wonderful photographs taken by the enigmatic Billy Meier.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The entire DVD is a single camera interview with Michael Horn as he sits in a chair and previews a lecture he's going to deliver that evening.

The interview, which lasts about 45 minutes, is interesting enough.  But that's all there is.  Horn keeps mentioning ""the case"" which one assumes comprises his lecture, and which one assumes contains a dazzling photographic component.  A shame that we don't get to see it.

Undoubtedly, the information about Billy Meier disclosed by Horn is significant and deeply mystical.  However, although there are references to the evidence and materials that will no doubt be presented at the lecture, the veiwer is left in the dark about what it actually is.

Additionally, despite what one reviewer claims, there is no mention whatsoever of an alleged tachyon drive or any other propulsion system used by the ""Plejarans"".",1215734400,,1024,5.011834319526627
8241221,4,B0011ACRCC,"""The Billy Meier Case"" explores the psychic and alien phenomenon of Billy Meier as explained by Michael Horn.  Horn gives viewers insight into Billy Meier's claim that he is a prophet who is given messages by extraterrestrials.  In Horn's eerie interview about Meier, he states that Billy, born in 1932, was first contacted by aliens at age five.  In support of Meier's assertions, Horn discusses an astonishing ""genetic connection"" between humans and extraterrestrials.  He also reveals an alarming list of Billy Meier predictions that have materialized over decades, which even a die-hard skeptic would find curious. If you are on a search for real ""X-File"" cases, this one will not disappoint you.",1205366400,3,700,5.223214285714286
8241222,5,B0011ACRCC,"Even aside from the amazing photographs Billy has managed to take of UFO's, this story is incredible.  From his physical afflictions to his claims of abduction, this story is incredible enough to make even the doubter question the possibility of abduction but aliens.  Great!",1204243200,,275,5.2272727272727275
