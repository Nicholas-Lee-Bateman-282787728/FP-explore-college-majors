5007241,5,B006NF2X92,"I was unsure about doing this video since I am a Yoga Flow student and thought that using a chair as a prop would make it to easy.  The chair is not a prop but a handle tool to keep you aligned and support your moves.  This practice has made my yoga flow even better.  I feel stronger than ever. I disagree with the reviewer who thinks the electrical plugs are a distraction and that the room is plain.  1.  One shouldn't be looking at plugs if they are truly focused, and the same with a view of ocean waves. 2. Yoga practice is a practice within.",1327363200,,548,4.08411214953271
5007242,5,B006NF2X92,"Just recovering from surgery, I watched the tape to see if it would work toward my recovery.  Valerie Rogers is a beautiful example of a body that can be not only maintained but made better from head to toe.  Breathing, exercising and relaxing are all in balance.  The music is gorgeous and her voice soft and soothing - but it doesn't hide her soft enthusiasm.  Who could believe that fluid, lithe form can be achieved if one is over 50??

It was a really novel idea to have a Gretchen `everywoman' demonstrate a less strenuous way to do the exercises, but I found it hard to take my eyes off of Rogers.  Obviously, she practices what she preaches.

Only a couple of comments:  I did find the studio rather bland and kept noticing the electrical outlet on the wall. For example, it would have been so cool to see a softly rolling ocean with some peaceful landscape features instead.  The intro screen appears to show that the tape is divided into sections, but there is no way to tell when/where each chapter starts if one wants to resume another time.  It might be helpful if Rogers named more of the classic movements as they were being done.  That might be reassuring to people who have a bit of yoga experience, let them feel more advanced or knowledgeable, and encourage them to participate all of the way through.  Overall, I was impressed by the chair yoga approach and will use this tape as soon as my recovery permits.",1327363200,6,1428,4.5136186770428015
5007243,5,B006NF2X92,"Because of the adaptations available in this DVD, Chogaflow is a great program for active baby-boomers as well as for those who are older or do not move as easily.  Having attended Valerie's Chogaflow classes, it is exciting to see that she has this DVD available for home use.  I am now stronger and more comfortable on my bicycle for my long-distance rides.",1325548800,,359,4.682539682539683
5007244,5,B006NF2X92,"My regular yoga flow practice was becoming too challenging for me (I have a bad knee & tweaky shoulders) and the seated chair yoga classes and videos that I tried, weren't challenging me enough. Chogaflow is the perfect in-between yoga practice. I get a great energizing workout with the standing sequence and a nice stretch with the seated part. Using the chair helps to keep my knee safe and stable. My lunge pose is actually more stable now than ever. I sometimes follow the woman who is demonstrating the modified version of the poses and other times I follow Valerie Rogers, so it is like getting two videos in one. You can make your practice as easy or as challenging as you like. Chair-yoga-flow is exactly what I have been searching for!",1325548800,,745,4.651515151515151
5007245,5,B006NF2X92,"Chogaflow is exactly the kind of yoga practice I have been looking for.  As one who has had rotator cuff and back surgery, I have to be careful not to strain my already weakened joints.  Valerie is encouraging while challenging you to do the best you are able.  She is a role model for the person who desires to be strong, limber and committed to maintaining flexibility and a youthful attitude.  I am grateful.",1413244800,,411,4.513513513513513
5007246,5,B006NF2X92,Valerie Rogers' Chogaflow is a wonderfully guided yoga practice.  Valerie is so good about explaining the cues and adapting poses as needed.  The workout is as intense as you make it - I hate when I have to miss it!,1412812800,,215,4.35
5007247,5,B006NF2X92,"Great DVD , helps with strength and balance as well as flexibility. Instructor does a great job, easy to follow.",1412726400,,112,4.65
5007248,5,B006NF2X92,The teacher has a nice uninterrupted gentle but challenging flow and the two different ways to use the chair allows for any one who would like to try yoga and might be challenged by there bodies can join right in as well..,1384387200,,222,4.309523809523809
5007249,5,B006NF2X92,"This DVD- WOW, where to start. I was recently diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis and I was looking for a gentle way to move and ease my joint pain. Chogaflow does this and MORE! This is SO SO SO much more than a chair yoga practice. Chogaflow really does create a ""flow"" between the body, mind and spirit. Valerie's graceful movements, her soft gentle soothing voice guiding you, Gretchen is Valerie's assistant, who shows you how to modify and does a splendid job. This and the dialog are all one of a kind and priceless!!!! Wonder-full! I will share with all my friends. It's a treasure!",1374278400,,595,4.6761904761904765
5007250,5,B006NF2X92,"I have MS and was looking for a good yoga dvd that isn't too strenuous and doesn't require a lot of balance... this is perfect! Valerie Rogers demonstrates a more difficult workout, and the other person demonstrates a modified workout.",1368057600,5,235,4.9
5007251,5,B006NF2X92,"I did yoga for about five years before osteoarthritis stopped me. Eight weeks ago I had a total hip replacement. After getting approval from my surgeon, I was anxious to give my new Chogaflow DVD a try. I unrolled my yoga mat, and grabbed a chair. I loved it! It had all the usual yoga poses that required the same muscloskeletal corrections; but I used a chair for support instead of going all the way to the floor. It flowed, so it was a non-stop workout like other yoga flow DVDs. And even though I skipped the poses that contradict my restrictions, I made it to the end. My body is SO happy to be able to do some form of yoga again. Chogaflow is a very suitable replacement.",1366848000,13,678,4.263565891472868
5007252,5,B006NF2X92,"The DVD is everything it promises.  You use a chair as a prop to perform basic yoga poses.  It is great if you have back problems, are not very flexible or are overweight.",1364515200,2,171,4.151515151515151
5007253,5,B006NF2X92,"I bought this video for a friend of mine, who suffers with fibromyalgia, and she
was so happy to be able to do it, and not hurt herself. I also do this video with my son,
and we are very healthy, and we love it. We feel so much better after doing it.
The instruction is perfect, and I found it very helpful, for a safe work-out, for
everyone.",1350000000,5,342,3.971014492753623
5007254,5,B006NF2X92,"After watching a few videos on YouTube, I purchase this through Amazon. Great Price. The instructor is pleasant and easy to follow. She does the more advanced poses while another woman does the modified moves. If you put all the stretch and extension into these poses you will come out so limber and refreshed but if you're not as limber, then the modified moves work too. Even though I thought it would be too long at about 50 minutes, once you're into the routine, it definitely moves smoothly. I like this even tho I can certainly do a lot of these moves w/o a chair. I would definitely recommend a sturdy chair and even a longer yoga mat but I use my regular mat and patio chair which works for me right now. Valerie is just a great instructor to follow. If she put out other yoga routines, I would buy them as well.",1342742400,7,820,4.3311688311688314
5007264,5,B006NF2X92,"The flow of this DVD is ideal, with clear vebal cues and an unhurried pace.  It's mesmerizing to watch- their movements are remarkable synchronized.  Newbies to yoga and the not so athletic can start by following Gretchen and progress to the more challenging work out with Valerie.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone.",1339372800,5,320,4.888888888888889
5007265,5,B006NF2X92,Valerie Rogers has been teaching yoga in our Athletic Club for years and now her students and everyone else in America have the chance to try her ChogaFlow DVD and can practice anywhere. Valerie would love to teach classes everywhere but that just is not possible so this is the next best thing. Her students rave about her class and the benifits are endless. Try it and you will like it!,1333324800,,388,4.47887323943662
5007266,5,B006NF2X92,My wife loves Chogaflow - she practices it at least two times a week. It is most beneficial in keeping joints limber. The great thing about Chogaflow is it can be challenging if you want it to be or you can have a more relaxed workout if you wish.,1332720000,,247,4.061224489795919
5007267,5,B006NF2X92,This is a great yoga video for young and old.  You can easily go at your pace and feel good doing what you can.  I cannot yet do the whole exercise but I can work toward it at home.  I will never be like Valerie but she makes it clear that it's ok to do whatever you can.,1330300800,,271,3.6379310344827585
5007268,5,B006NF2X92,And I thought this was going to be an 'easy' yoga workout.  I have been practicing yoga for years and was pleasantly surprised to find this workout is as difficult or easy as one chooses to make it.  It would be great for anyone starting out with yoga or who is not able to get up or down from the floor easily.  But even an experienced yogi will be able to get all the stretches in during this workout.  I'm going to pass this video on to others. Thanks Valerie.,1330214400,,463,4.111111111111111
5007269,5,B006NF2X92,I've been a student of Valerie's for over two years. I'm 78 years old and I was really surprised when chogaflow reduced joint pain and lowered my blood pressure in addition to what I had expected-helping me maintain flexibility. Her method is a middle path between a warm supportive understanding of what I'm capable of and challenging me to go beyond what I would do on my own. The DVD is a good substitute when I want to practice at home..,1329177600,11,441,4.45679012345679
5007270,5,B006NF2X92,"This is my first yoga video purchase and I must admit I was very impressed.  As a chiropractor I often recommend yoga as adjunct to my treatments to build balance, symmetry and elasticity to the joints.  I have been looking for something simple to recommend to patients that can be done easily at home.

This video fits perfectly.  If you are not flexible there are two options demonstrated at the same time.  You simply pick the one that feels more comfortable for your body.  The explanations are easy to understand.  The pacing is relaxing yet challenging.

Very professional and easy to follow!  I highly recommend. Thank you!",1329091200,17,630,4.813084112149533
5007271,5,B006NF2X92,"Speaking as someone who has become very sedentary and overweight in the last few years, I had lost so much strength and balance. I tried regular yoga, but just was not up to it. Chogaflow is something I can do. After a few weeks of doing Chogaflow only 2-3 times per week, I already have better balance, and my strength is returning. It is a pleasant, yet not an easy workout for me. I do work up a sweat. Valerie's sweet and encouraging spirit comes through in her voice and words. Chogaflow leaves me feeling both stronger and uplifted.",1329004800,14,538,4.444444444444445
5007272,5,B006NF2X92,"I am 71 years old and regular yoga was too difficult; however this chair yoga gives you a good workout, good stretching for all parts of the body, strengthening all parts of the body, especially, the back and legs.  I feel stronger, have better posture and my knee doesn't bother me anymore.  It is great, and many times we find we are not even really using the chair - it is just there as a support in case we need it.  Valerie gives wonderful detailed cues as to how your body's position should be in every posture.  It is wonderful",1328659200,,534,4.31
5007273,5,B006NF2X92,"I am an avid yogi, but there are times in every yogi's life when they need to take it easy.  This DVD is the perfect way to do that.  On those days when I am feeling a bit tired, or am a bit under the weather, or need something different, I turn to Chogaflow.  I can make the practice as challenging as I want, so even if I start out thinking I will just do a gentle, quiet practice, I sometimes find that when I get into it, I feel better and want to do more.  And so I do, going into the more challenging versions of the poses.

I have shared this DVD with friends who are new to yoga, (and new to exercise!), and they have loved it.  They have told me it takes away the intimidation of the ""unknown"" and allows them to experience yoga without feeling they have to ""do everything.""

It is such a peaceful, encouraging practice.  Try it for yourself - you'll see.

Namaste.",1327622400,,874,4.094117647058823
8501361,5,B006NF2X92,"This video is the perfect challenge for me, and a great confidence builder too. Im a beginner so I follow the woman in the video who demonstrates the modified version of the poses. I have a tendency to hold a lot of tension in my shoulders and after practicing the video my shoulders always feel very relaxed and tension-free. I also feel like my posture is getting so much better since Ive been using the video. I feel taller! I have a permanent corner set up in the family room with my mat and chair so I can easily pop the video in and start the day with Chogaflow. A great way to start my day!",1514419200,,597,4.155172413793103
8501362,2,B006NF2X92,"I got the impression that this would be a good video for people who may not be able to stand to do traditional yoga.  Instead, it was much more difficult than that.  My problem is that I bought this as a gift for someone with health problems.  Instead of helping, it made her feel like a failure.",1454544000,,296,4.157894736842105

8501364,4,B006NF2X92,Very good,1441929600,,9,4.0
8501365,5,B006NF2X92,"This is a great starter video for someone 60+. Even if you start out doing just the warm up, you gain benefit. I did find the warm up to go just a little more quickly than I thought it might, but the standing portion did slow down, as did the cool down/relaxation portion. No special equipment like blocks and straps required. Just me, the chair and the DVD.Love that she chose a ""real woman"" with actual breasts to perform the alternate poses. Curves present special circumstances and it was nice, for once, to be able to have a REAL peer with a real body to follow.",1440374400,,567,4.3584905660377355
8501366,2,B006NF2X92,"This is basic yoga just using a chair.  Valerie Rogers is just showing off her yoga abilities and not understanding the people with limitations who actually need to practice chair yoga.  I am an able bodied yoga instructor who loves vinyasa flow yoga and Ashtanga yoga, but I also want to be able to teach people who are unable to get down on the floor to practice yoga as it is more commonly practiced.  My ""chair yoga"" students are generally in their 70's and have had hip and/or knee replacements or have some other form of limitation.  If you can do this practice you do not need the chair.",1432339200,8,594,4.422018348623853

8501368,5,B006NF2X92,"Chogaflow is a wonderful practice that is both challenging and relaxing.  Valerie's voice is wonderful, gentle and guides you through the practice with such knowledge.  You can tell that she loves what she is doing.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a balanced and challenging practice.",1418688000,,316,5.038461538461538
8501369,5,B006NF2X92,"Great Find!  Purchased this video for my mom and she loves it! The poses are expertly explained and there are varying levels of difficulty, so my beginner mom has room to grow.  Highly recommend, especially for beginners or anyone with limited strength/balance/flexibility.  The instructor is encouraging while also making it clear that you should do what is comfortable for your own body.  Can't go wrong with this video!",1418601600,2,422,5.161764705882353
8501370,5,B006NF2X92,"I went to Valerie's Chogaflow class a year ago and was hooked! Valerie's enthusiasm keeps me engaged. Her cues are perfect. and her enthusiasm is infectious!
