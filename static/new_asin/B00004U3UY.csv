Shenandoah
Yellowstone
Yosemite",1242950400,,257,4.976744186046512
7923596,5,B00004U3UY,"What sets this DVD apart is the way it focuses on several specific hiking trails in each park.  Basic information is provided about each trail's length, difficulty and steepness.  This video won't replace a good trail map, but it will deliver a nice preview of what you'll find on your visit.

Six half-hour episodes are included:  Yellowstone, Shenandoah, Yosemite, Great Smoky Mountains, Mesa Verde and Zion National Parks.  These aren't new films, but they're still valid, since national parks don't change much.  With a pleasant tone and a relaxed pace, this DVD will provide an enjoyable afternoon for any armchair traveler.  100% kid-safe.",1237420800,,645,5.203883495145631
7923597,3,B00004U3UY,"The idea of sightseeing in America's National Parks through the marvelous picture and sound of DVD is reason enough to be interested in a release  like this. However, ""Touring Through Great National Parks of America,  Vol. 2,"" is a tad rough around the edges.
While the picture quality  is above average, it is not spectacular, and the sound tends to be a little  muffled in the voice over. But, on the other end, it's hard not to be won  over by the sheer beauty of parks like Shenandoah, Yosemite, Yellowstone,  and Zion, among others. The commentary is well researched and in depth, but  also tends to be a bit slow at times.
Overall, this DVD will delight  frequent visitors to America's National Parks, serving as a postcard  reminder of their magnificence. In addition, anyone interested in visiting  some of America's National Parks will want to give this a try to help  decide which one might be right for you.
Not a perfect DVD, but  informative none-the-less.",967593600,15,969,4.771084337349397
