2179508,4,B0006A9FJ6,"Paul Bettany has been carving out a rather impressive career as a supporting player in recent movies.  He was the scene stealing Geoffrey Chaucer in ""A Knight's Tale,"" part of a strong ensemble cast in ""Dogville,"" and has twice played a strong second fiddle to Russell Crowe in first ""A Dangerous Mind"" and then ""Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.""  Clearly, he is not going to be a leading man, which is one of the reasons it is nice to see him essay such a part in a movie like ""Wimbledon.""  The actor will not receive many such opportunities, but this story provides him with the perfect opportunity.

Bettany is Peter Colt, a British tennis player who has fallen to 119th in the world, having once been 11th, and who has decided that this Wimbledon fortnight is to be his last.  Usually the phrase would be ""win or lose,"" but Peter has never won a tournament let alone a Grand Slam event like Wimbledon, so losing is all he has ever known.  He tries to announce his planned retirement, but the press is distracted and so it seems that the only one who knows this is Peter's last hurrah is Peter himself.  But when he shows up at the hotel for the tournament he ends up being given the key to the room of Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), the rising infant terrible of American tennis.  If seeing her in the shower is not enough to get Peter interested, she manages to run into him again.

Neither Peter or Lizzie is sure about what is going on, although she certainly expresses more confidence in the relationship, which makes sense because she has more sense in her tennis game as well.  But Peter finds that he has feelings for Lizzie, and he also becomes aware that he is winning tennis matches he should not be winning.  Of course, her father (Sam O'Neill) thinks Peter is distracting Lizzie from the task at hand, and so besides his matches and her matches there is daddy dearest to deal with as well.  But as Peter's confidence in his tennis game increases, cracks start to appear in Lizzie's, and it is clear that for both of them what is happening off the tennis court is affecting what is happening on the grass of Wimbledon.

Those familiar with tennis might think that this particular story is based on the ""Love Bird Double"" pulled off by Jimmy Connors and Chris Evert when they were dating back in the 1970s, or even the romance between Evert and John Lloyd, the British player that she actually ended up marrying, but if anything this story is more in keeping with what Connors did at the U.S. Open in 1991 when he was ranked #174 in the world and made it to the semi-finals.  Of course there is a little bit of all of these things in this story, and all that is really important is that what Colt does is not so far fetched given what we have seen happen on tennis courts in our life time.

""Wimbledon"" is supposed to be a romantic comedy, but the best parts of this 2004 film from director Richard Loncraine are when Colt is on the court playing tennis.  More specifically, it is when Colt is thinking about playing tennis, as the script by Adam Brooks, Jennifer Flackett, and Mark Levin gives him lots of opportunities to pysch himself up (and sometimes out) as he gets ready for the next point.  It is from listening to these internal monologues that we get a sense of how Colt is on the edge, relying on brains, sheer well, and the good thoughts of people like his favorite ball boy (Jonathan Timmins) to make it through the next key point and then do it all over again.

A lot of this movie is predictable, but that is a common complaint about sports films, whether you are talking true stories like ""Seabiscuit"" or making them up as was the case with ""The Natural.""  Bettany's performance makes this one work because we get a sense for how much of a physical and mental effort it is for him to play in this tournament.  Yes, the tennis ball is computer generated, but the drama of sports is always the human element more than what happens with the ball.  That is why the big question in ""Wimbeldon"" is not whether Peter Colt will get the girl, but whether he will win the tournament.",1104796800,7,4121,4.4317880794701985
2179509,5,B0006A9FJ6,"I loved this movie.  Not only is it a cute romantic comedy, but it's set in Britain-what more could one ask? Paul Bettany is super cute, and the surrounding characters added many chuckles to the movie.  Hope to see him in more romantic movies.  Kirsten Dunst is great playing a spunky American, without being too loud about it.  The background music was well-selected as well.",1104796800,3,376,4.7384615384615385
2179510,3,B0006A9FJ6,This is a nice romantic movie. It starts out with two competitive tennis players. One who is declining and a rising star played by Kirsten Durst. Who will meet and fall in love. but alas there are obstacles. Will love conquer all? You have to buy it to find out. But it's worth it.,1104624000,,281,4.222222222222222
2179511,5,B0006A9FJ6,"I loved this movie!  What more can I say?  I am, however, a tennis fan, but I would have loved this movie anyway.  You can't help but love Peter Peter Colt.  He's just a breath of fresh air in this wonderful romantic comedy.  Wimbledon, which was produced by Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner, who also produced Love Actually (another favorite), Notting Hill, and Bridget Jones's Diary, scored another ace with Wimbledon.  Wimbledon is at the top of my DVD shelf and will sit there forever.",1104364800,3,483,4.623529411764705
2179512,5,B0006A9FJ6,"I knew I was probably making a mistake late last night when I put the DVD of WIMBLEDON in my DVD player. As a big fan of both BRIDGET JONES' DIARY and NOTTING HILL I suspected the decision would mean few hours of precious sleep before stumbling out of the house on the way to work this morning.

Yep, I sat their engrossed in the unfolding drama, and yes it meant I was still happily glued to the movie as my alarm clock slid past 2 a.m., but this movie not only met my expectations but exceeded them in all its free-spirited warm fuzzies.

The story has been done before - boy meets girl, girls father attempts to keep them apart, boy loses girl and then well - you need to watch the movie for that answer. However this movie is a winner because the backdrop (Wimbledon) provides for some nerve wrenching moments and tension and the other movies of this ilk did not star Paul Bettany (the same actor who proved great comic timing in A KNIGHT'S TALE) and Kirsten Dunst. Dunst has never particularly impressed me before and I never found her terribly attractive, yet she looks stunningly gorgeous in this movie and plays her part of the young tennis protg to perfection.

Bettany plays the part of a has-been tennis player named Peter Colt who (after being ranked #11 in the world some years before) wins a wildcard spot at Wimbledon which he accepts as a last hurrah before taking on the tennis pro position at a snooty English social club. There he meets up with aspiring young tennis star Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) who is competing in her first Wimbledon under the watchful eye of her father (played by Sam Neill sporting a horrible American accent).

Following a mix up over rooms and some other comic  misadventures the two gradually fall in love (although neither seems ready to admit it) and as Colt's game improves and he advances further into the tournament, Lizzie's game deteriorates.

I'm not sure if I bought Bettany and Dunst as a couple, the two certainly have a chemistry and Bettany is his usual charming self, but something about it didn't quite gel for me. But this is a minor quibble because everything else works perfectly and I don't think I have ever seen tennis portrayed so dramatically on screen. The movie also features a number of tennis greats in front of the camera (including Chris Evert and John McEnroe) to add a further sense pf realism to the proceedings.

Adding to this movie on DVD is a nice set of special features that include three short featurettes. They focus on the movie in general, the use of Wimbledon as a location and the tennis training that all the actors had to undertake (incredibly neither Bettany or Dunst were tennis players before starting work on this picture). There is also the theatrical trailer and a nicely relaxed commentary supplied by director Richard Loncraine and Bettany. You know you are in for a fun ride when Loncraine jokingly explains that Bettany insisted on being present so he (Loncraine) would not take all the credit for the movie.

This is a great movie and I will probably find myself watching it a second time before the weekend arrives - though at a more sensible time of the day.",1104278400,5,3168,4.6046099290780145
2179513,2,B0006A9FJ6,"Ok, maybe this movie didn't work for me because I am not English or because I really don't care anything about tennis. This is a stinker. It stinks worse than the locker rooms at the real Wimbledon probably stink. There is no spark between the two main stars and you find yourself just wishing Sam Neil (who plays Dunst's father) brought some of his friends from Jurassic Park along so they would eat the rest of the cast. Bettany, who saved A Knight's Tale from sucking, looks tired and not too impressed with himself in this movie. Dunst plays the same character she has played since she was a kid. Why can't she get hooked on drugs and disappear off the face of the Earth like all the other child actors. This movie, unless you really enjoy watching tennis balls go back and forth, is a total waste of time. I really recommend you go watch the Legend of Bagger Vance and watch white golf balls go back and forth instead of this movie. That was a joke because that movie sucked too!",1104278400,3,984,4.382513661202186
2179514,5,B0006A9FJ6,"Peter Colt was once ranked 11th in the world in tennis. Sadly, he is ranked over 100 now. He has a chance to play at Wimbledon though and does not want to look stupid.

When he checks into the hotel the players are staying at he mistakenly enters the suite of Elizabeth ""Lizzy"" Bradbury another tennis player at Wimbledon. This leads to an affair that Lizzies father does not initially approve of.

Amazingly after meeting Lizzie Peter starts winning, but after a while Lizzie starts loosing because she can only concentrate on Peter. During his last match Lizzie shows up and Peter wins Wimbledon.

This movie is very good. Kirsten Dunst and Paul Bettany are really good as Peter and Lizzie and the supporting cast members (especially the man playing Peter's brother) are really good too.",1103328000,2,789,4.786764705882353
2179515,5,B0006A9FJ6,"A bunch of people have said that Wimbledon was 'too predictable.' Well, it's a romantic comedy. Of course it's predictable: boy meets girl, they fall in love, trouble pursues, they get together in the end.

The point of seeing a love story is to see HOW all this happens. Wimbledon does a great job coming up with an original plot (love and tennis) while presenting the story in a way that draws in the audience. You really care about the characters. Kirsten Dunst, especially, creates a wonderful portrayal of Lizzie Bradbury. Lizzie is a very bold, driven, somewhat selfish character, but Dunst makes her lovable. And Bettany (Peter) plays off Dunst's performance incredibly well.

I love this movie. It's incredibly sweet, and funny without the groaning and eye-rolling junk. It is an amazingly well-directed, well-casted, and all around well-done movie that immediately made it to the top of my favorites list.",1099440000,38,914,5.046357615894039
2179516,2,B0006A9FJ6,"What did WIMBLEDON have going for it? Kirsten Dunst hasn't exactly made terrible movies since becoming a major starlet. She got off to a great start with Sofia Coppola's very interesting THE VIRGIN SUICIDES. Since SPIDERMAN made her a Cosmo cover girl, she has chosen interesting roles with interesting directors: THE CAT'S MEOW, ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND, and Cameron Crowe's upcoming ELIZABETHTOWN - not to mention SPIDERMAN 2. I've liked Paul Bettany in everything I've seen him in: A BEAUTIFUL MIND, GANGSTER NO. 1, and MASTER AND COMMANDER. But apparently this extremely forgettable sports film came along and knocked them over like a tennis racket to the groin. The story itself is more like one of my serves - servicable but ultimately incapable of overwhelming anyone. Bettany is a likeable bloke; the only thing refreshing about the movie is he isn't doing the ""washed out athlete as world's biggest jerk seeking redemption"" cliche. But Dunst is an obvious wash of Monica Seles and the Williams sisters and the romance is dull and distracting. Speaking of cliches, this one has them all - the big match, the announcer who makes comments like ""This is his last chance. Is time closing in on . . ."" and the agent without a clue. A fine movie might have been made about has-been Bettany becoming inspired by the style of play of one of the world's top womens player, but this movie is more interesting in a romance that would seem standard by the Olsen Twins' producer. Too bad, because I've always thought tennis to be a very cinematic sport, and this will delay any other decent tennis scripts that come along. I was also saddened to find out that the director is not just an MTV reject who deserves a bad movie to suit his mediocre style, but the director of the Ian McKellen RICHARD III - one of the best Shakespeare movies of the last ten years. The Onion's Keith Phipps puts it best when says that it's ""the perfect movie for 14-year-old girls having a slumber party, and a must for everyone else to avoid.""",1488672000,,2031,4.707865168539326

2179522,2,B0006A9FJ6,"I was horribly disappointed by this movie, because it could have been so good. I love tennis, Paul Bettany, and of course Wimbledon, that grand old symbol of great sport, and I expected the movie to focus on Wimbledon. I had never seen the female lead, and found her to be neither attractive nor a good actress. That would not have mattered much if the movie had been about Wimbledon, but instead, and in spite of having some of the tennis greats give their time to doing cameo roles in the film, ""Wimbledon"" was all bits and pieces, with a tree house, country club, a scene with father like a bad reprise of ""Love Story,"" confession of guilt for nothing in particular by Bettany, a little sex here and there, not very funny joking about the brother who bets on Bettany to lose, the girl's manager, Bettany's partner, etc., etc. I'm surprised the maker of Bettany's tennis rackets didn't show up to do a commercial! I gave the movie two stars instead of one because the last part, from Bettany being greeted in the Wimbledon locker room through the interestingly handled crucial match, was well worth seeing, and. I was charmed by Bettany's instant protectiveness of the ball boy. Just give Paul Bettany a kid to act with and you can't lose---not completely, anyway!",1481587200,,1266,4.65625

2179574,3,B0006A9FJ6,"Wimbledon is a romantic comedy that centers on a the romance between a washed-up tennis professional,Peter Colt and an up-and-coming tennis star,Lizzie Bradbury that occurred during the Wimbledon Championships. It features Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst.

The story of the film follows plight of Peter Colt,who is on wildcard participant at Wimbledon considering. At age 31,he intends to retire after the tournament and has decided to play a decent tennis match in it. Then he accidentally meets the up-and-coming Lizzie Bradbury after a mistake in the room given to him by a receptionist on the hotel he is staying. After they get to know each other after a series of events,they find each other attractive and fell for each other. This led to Peter improving his self-confidence and getting inspired playing at Wimbledon as he managed to win many matches and was able to finish at the tournament beyond many to fans' expectations.

I found the film overall bland and boring. Added to that,both Bettany and Dunst aren't really believable as a couple despite the fact that both had good performances. What's even worse is the fact that the tennis action is far from authentic especially when one is familiar with the sport. Everyone watching this pretty much knew what is going to happen at the end of the film and how Peter is going to perform in his last tournament which made it contrived and predictable. Overall,the presence of the lead stars and their acting skills save this film especially when it lacks strong features and make it functional for people who love films of these genre.",1428278400,,1592,4.936567164179104

I got over it by adjusting the color/tint/contrast functions on my TV. Nevertheless, this should be in every serious fan's collection because it show cases the best of a memorable personality.

As a successful tennis pro, she is the favorite to win at Wimbledon, yet circumstances intervene to make the challenge tougher than she originally anticipated. Bradbury is a somewhat self-absorbed character, played by Kirsten Dunst, that is forced to overcome her attitude problems as she matures both as a player and as a person over the course of the movie.

Peter Colt, played by Paul Bettany, is at the end of his prime. A moderately successful tennis player, Colt is anticipated a first-round defeat at Wimbledon as his last hurrah in the tennis world before taking a job as a tennis pro at an obscure club. Colt's chances, however, are changed, as he mistakenly walks into Lizzie's room on the first day of the tournament, seeing her in the shower.

This BBC coverage, by contrast, is an object lesson in how to do it right: intelligent, perceptive and minimalist.  The commentators include John Lloyd (British Davis Cup Captain and two-time Mixed Doubles Champion) and Jimmy Connors (two-time Singles champion &mdash; addressing his colleague as ""Lloydie"").  Both therefore have a deep knowledge of their field, and both are excellent.  Their remarks are all interesting and address such matters as why someone missed a particular shot, or who has the momentum; there are no repetitions of the umpire (Carlos Ramos)'s calling of the score, no statistics about how many backhand volleys Nadal has missed in this set.

And of course having no commercials makes such a difference.

The match itself has much to expostulate about.  Simply put, this is one of the greatest tennis matches I have seen in fifty years.  True, the 2008 final was closer, but Federer was spraying the court for the first two sets; whereas the tennis here is brilliant on both sides throughout.

I hadn't realised that the moment the last ball has bounced twice, someone instantly rushes to the Players' Entrance with a gold-leaf decal and adds the champion's name to the roster by the door, so that he sees it there when he re-enters the building after the award ceremony &mdash; a nice touch.

The two discs include the entire match, the award ceremony, interviews with both finalists, and footage of Bjrn Borg congratulating Roger afterwards.

Having said that, this film about a washed up British tennis player who falls into bed and then into love with the next American up-and-comer controlled by her controlling father is not half bad. The principals play together nicely and Paul Bettany portrays his rueful, sardonic, world-weary Brit with suitable gusto. Dunst is perky -- and I don't mean that in a derogatory way since in this kind of movie perky is good.

2179628,4,B0006A9FJ6,"Kirsten Dunst is one of my favorite actresses in young Hollywood.  She is spunky, charming, beautiful, quirky, engaging and just all around delightful.  She is like a sunnier Claire Danes to me (both are horribly underrated as actresses).  I'll pretty much watch her in anything.

Paul Bettany is one of those actors who has garnered a huge fan base even if he has yet to really break out into the mainstream.  He has graced quite a few great films, and has proven to be a steady and in-depth supporting actor, delivering great comic relief (`A Knights Tale'), supportive reliability (`A Beautiful Mind', `Master and Commander') and even disturbing romantic tension (`Dogville').  He is, in a word, brilliant.

Both of these actors are far better than `Wimbledon'.

This is not a bad film, at all, but it is not a great one either.  It misses a lot of opportunities to give us something special, especially with the cast it has.  It offers us nothing new, and the storyline is so predictable and clich&eacute; ridden that it is really a very unnecessary film.  The one highlight here is the delightful performances by the two leads.  Dunst and Bettany are stunning together and really elevate this `been-there-done-that' tale of two star-crossed lovers.

Bettany plays Peter Colt, a one time tennis champ (11th in the world) who has had a long string of bad luck leaving him ranking in the triple digits.  Lizzie Bradbury (Dunst) is a young and vibrant player who is doing remarkably well.  When all feels lost, Colt meets and falls for Bradbury.  As to be expected, his game improves thanks their love affair while hers suffers.

The film is funny and it has charm, thanks to the impressive cast.  Bettany and Dunst are not the only noteworthy actors here.  Sam Neill proves yet again that he is criminally underused in Hollywood, and the young (and now extremely adored) James McAvoy makes a really nice addition to the cast, proving why he is on the cuffs of major stardom.  I enjoyed this film, and I'm sure that you will too.  I just wish that it could have broken out of the conventional romantic comedy mold.  I wish that the script could have had the same spice and texture that the lead actors brought to their roles.

If this had stared two actors less competent and engaging I would have given this a C+, but the chemistry between the two leads alone brings my grade up to a B.  There are much better rom-com's out there, but even some better films lack the lovable chemistry this film oozes.",1254873600,2,2503,4.6880733944954125

2179635,3,B0006A9FJ6,"Paul Bettany's rangy, startling looks make him difficult to pigeonhole into any one sort of role.  He's mostly known for period pieces and unsettling baddie parts.  So it's refreshing to see him as the romantic lead in this frothy confection set in the high echelons of pro tennis.  His Peter Colt, a fading player facing down his 30s reflects with much interior angst on the impending demise of his disappointing professional tennis career, in which the high point was once briefly being ranked 11th in the world.  Having unexpectedly won a wild-card slot at Wimbledon, he's resigned to losing in the first round and announcing his retirement, upon which he will be forced to coach randy country club cougars for a living.  But then, in a Meet Cute that could only happen in this kind of movie, he encounters rising American tennis sensation Lizzie Bradbury (think McEnroe in a skirt), and an unlikely romance ensues.  What starts as a carnal fling over fish and chips develops into something deeper; even more surprising, Peter keeps winning his matches,  astounding himself even more than the whole of England.  Is Lizzie his soul mate--or a human good luck charm?  Or both?  Bettany effortlessly slips on the mantle of self-deprecating charmer unaware of his own appeal from Hugh Grant, but with a good deal less bumbling than Hugh Grant used to do.  He is, after all, supposed to be an elite athlete, and he looks the part of a professional tennis player quite convincingly.  He towers over his petite, considerably younger co-star, who is over-matched in both the tennis and acting departments, but these two sell their quirky blond pairing, and it works.  What sets this project a cut above other attempts at `sporty romances' (think `Cutting Edge') is its air of authenticity:  shot on location at Wimbledon and stuffed with real tennis talent, you can't fake this kind of detail.  Is it realistic to think that a player languishing at 119th could win a berth in the men's final at Wimbledon, AND find true love on the grass courts with a brash Yankee gal he's known for all of 2 weeks?  No on both counts--but that's precisely why we watch these movies, because in the rom-com universe, these kinds of happy accidents are the norm, and we can imagine they could happen to us.  By film's end, Bettany has convinced us that they couldn't have happened to a more deserving bloke.  From the producers of ""Notting Hill"" and the Bridget Jones movies, this one also boasts their hallmark bubbly score and views of a cheerful, affluent London where the sun actually shines more than it rains.  While you're waiting for Roger Federer to have his next crack at the Wimbledon title, let Bettany & Co. entertain you--and have some cucumber sandwiches while you're at it.",1238544000,2,2767,4.8241525423728815

Both players play smart tennis on a slower than usual, Center Court at Wimbledon.

2179638,5,B0006A9FJ6,"This film is far too underrated for all that it is.

Wimbledon is the tale of dear Peter Colt(Paul Bettany) who's beginning to learn that his tennis career is coming to and end and how in-fact he must deal with it. Everything seems to be going downhill until he meets upcoming super-star Lizzie Bradbury(Kirsten Dunst) and she help teach him how to love both the game and life again.

Now true this plot is not the most original, take Bridget Jones or You've got Mail and make them tennis players and TA-DA! But with that said, the performance of Paul Bettany makes it so much more.

Bettany is simply brilliant, over-thinking and awkward coming from a typically cold and slightly 'off' Brittish family to the fast-paced world of tennis. He doesn't quite fit in anywhere and doesn't have anywhere or anyone to run to. James Mcavoy is also pleasant as Peter's no-good gambling brother.

If you are a tennis fan it's nice to see a film with tennis in mind, although the match scenes are pretty weak and it's obvious neither Bettany or Dunst have much tennis experience.

2179640,5,B0006A9FJ6,"In this film, as has-been tennis player Peter Colt surprisingly ascends to prominence, his agent manages to line him up with a new Frito Lay potato chip to endorse, called ""Surprisingly Zesty."" This, to me, is as good a label as any when trying to describe this film. WIMBLEDON is surprisingly zesty. Tennis, in the states, is fairly popular but not as huge as the big three sports. So to say that this romantic sports film manages to be very entertaining is an unexpected triumph.

Love is such a strange racket, especially when it comes with no strings attached (sorry). WIMBLEDON tells of what happens when British tennis pro Peter Colt, on the very last legs of his career (once ranked 11th in the world, he's now 119th), meets young and fiery American, Lizzie Bradbury, as she competes for the very first time in the Wimbledon tournament, the most hallowed of grand slams. Sparks go up, and Peter and Lizzie venture into a mutually agreed carefree romance.

Peter, having earned a wild card berth into the tournament but having already decided to retire immediately afterwards, finds his game suddenly elevated. And, because athletes are ridiculously superstitious, he assumes his unexpected success stems from his fling with Lizzie, as, so far, he's spent the eve of each of his Wimbledon matches with her. As he keeps winning, the pressure is on to maintain the romantic routine. This, even as he begins to seriously fall for Lizzie. On the other hand, Lizzie finds herself losing her game face and focus. And, this, as she begins to seriously fall for Peter.

So there goes the carefree romance...

I happen to dig tennis. I date back to Sampras, Agassi, Graf, Hingis (when she was at the top of the world), and even as far back as my man John McEnroe. But most folks I know just aren't that into tennis. However, regarding WIMBLEDON, you don't have to be a fan of the sport to get into the story. This is tennis made accessible and the play on the court is grippingly presented. You actually get into the matches. Paul Bettany has that slim, athletic build to convincingly pull off his role, and he did plenty of the stunts (even if, a lot of times, the tennis ball had to be inserted graphically). One only wishes that Kirsten Dunst had been on the court more (but, no, she isn't as convincing as Bettany on the tennis court).

I don't know too much of Paul Bettany. I've only ever seen him in two other films, the rollicking&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Knight-s-Tale-Special-Edition/dp/B00000F4ZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Knight's Tale (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;(he plays Geoffrey Chaucer) and the mediocre&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Firewall-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000F8DV1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Firewall (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;(where he plays the lead villain). This is actually Paul Bettany's first time as a romantic lead, yet I wasn't all that surprised by how easily he shouldered that role. Guy simply spews that casual charisma (these Brit gents all must attend How To Be Disarming and Urbane 101). Of course, his rootability is enhanced by the film's use of ""radiohead,"" a device in which the audience is allowed to listen to Peter's turmoiled, neurotic thoughts during his matches. It's fun listening to his mind state scale increasingly frantic heights, the deeper he advances. Peter Colt is such a warm, wry, and engaging character. You can't help but pull for this underdog, on and off the court.

I don't want to say too much about Kirsten Dunst, 'cause I've been crushing on her for a while now. I'll just end up gushing like a numbnut. But, listen, the romance is frothy and light and easy to swallow, buoyed by Bettany and Dunst's sparkling chemistry. Even if you don't dig the tennis play, the love story makes you want to stick around. Not to mention, WIMBLEDON is pretty funny, with one of my favorite moments taking place during one of Peter's matches and involving a sheepish Jon Favreau.

The leads are ably supported by Sam Neill (as Lizzie's stern pops), Jon Favreau (as Peter's dubiously sly agent), Nicolaj Coster Waldau (as Peter's German friend and practice partner), and a fresh-faced James McAvoy (as Peter's brother, who bets against Peter in his matches). I particularly enjoyed the relationship between Peter and Dieter, it comes off with such effortless warmth. Tennis bedrocks such as Chris Evert, John McEnroe, Mary Carillo, and John Barrett (the voice of English tennis) give their seal of approval by being in the movie as themselves. This opens up several funny moments with Johnny Mac poking fun of his (in)famous personality. The film crew received permission to shoot scenes on Wimbledon grounds, this lending the picture another layer of authenticity.

Who wins Wimbledon? Who loses? Does Peter end up being an unhappy tennis director at a posh health club? Will Lizzie manage to curb her temper and refocus her drive? Does John McEnroe drop any F bombs?

Look, just go see the movie.",1216339200,2,5054,5.138686131386861
2179641,5,B0006A9FJ6,"For me, there's nothing like a good romantic comedy, and when the story is set in the sports world, my interest level can be counted on to double. This one has a tennis theme, so naturally I checked it out as soon as it became available on DVD.

Journeyman pro Peter Colt, played by Paul Bettany in a bit of stellar casting, has never quite made it to the top, and is now facing the end of a long career. He's got a wild card for Wimbledon, and plans to announce his retirement as soon as he loses a match.

When a mistaken room assignment brings him to the suite of American superstar Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) - she behind the frosted shower glass, he bags in hand in the hall - romantic sparks fly and delicious repartee flows. It's all great fun, and we know right away this one's gonna be good.

When in a surprise, Peter wins his first match on court 17, things begin to look up for him. The romance is right on track too, as the two discuss the merits of fooling around on the night before a big match - over fish and chips, no less.

For Peter, fooling around seems to have hurt his game. His second round match is a budding disaster. He's headed for defeat until who should show up but Lizzie to cheer him on. In a stunning turn of events, he plays for her and wins. A streak that continues when in round 3 Peter dispatches his best friend and practice partner Nikolaj (Dieter Prohl) - despite the increasingly evident disapproval of Dennis, Lizzie's driven father and coach (Sam Neill), and the re-appearance of Peter's long absent agent Ron (Jon Favreau).

Meanwhile, Peter's dysfunctional family add really great touches of color. His feuding mother and father (Bernard Hill and Eleanor Bron) have reached the point where his father has moved to the treehouse in the back yard of the mansion, and Peter's younger brother Carl (James McAvoy) provides comic relief as  (to the disgust of the bookies) he bets against his brother (""He's been on such a good losing streak."").

All told, Wimbledon is a light-hearted love story with a strong sports angle filled with great one-liners and several nice little plot threads that add up to an outstanding whole. I really loved it. I think it's the best sports-theme film to come along since ""For Love of the Game.""

2179646,3,B0006A9FJ6,"Really this film falls short, not bad but it just peters out in every category.  The categories are:

1) Love and Relationships:  Hmmmm, not really feeling it here, there just is not much of a convincing connection between the two main lovers.

2) Triumph and Rising to the top:  The whole film tries in vain to make the viewer feel like they are seeing greatness, but for a player who ends up in the big one, it just does not make one feel it.

3) Family and other things:  Give me a break, what kind of mother would be planting flowers in her garden and scoff when her husband tunes the radio in to hear their son's match being broadcast at Wimdbledon?  A real mom would drop the lettuce and trowel and be glued in.  The portrayal of the parents, particularly his mother is poor.  The girl's father is about the same, he never really shows any emotion, I mean c'mon people there were times in this film when he should have been furious with the guy who was seeing his daughter, and his strict behavior towards her as some overbearing father wanting his daughter to succeed was very, very weak.  They could have cast a loaf of bread or Oscar's trash can lid as her father and gotten better results.

Just reaches out into so many different areas, and yet never really hits any major points in any of them.  The relationship is a joke and even the paparrazi style of assault being shown in the film is short lived, like everything else.  They tease the viewer with a million different things and then let it all just roll along.  Still okay but could have been so much better.  Trying to mix a love story with an underdog sports story is not easy, but at least try!  I suppose if you like Tennis you might like this movie.  John McEnroe is in it and boy howdy I wish we could have seen HIM make a cameo appearance on the court.  Loved the way he used to throw his racket and scream at those incompetent line judges.  Sorry, did not mean to be so hard on them, but you need instant replay in this sport or otherwise the people who should win will not always do so.",1186963200,2,2063,4.281653746770026
2179647,4,B0006A9FJ6,"On the rare occasions when I watch tennis or golf, I always wonder what the player is thinking when they are getting ready to hit the ball. This movie answers that.

First of all, I LOVE Paul Bettany. I think he's a great and charming actor and is the main reason I originally watched this movie. But I ended up really liking it for the way the movie was shot as well. The tennis matches were fun to watch and I enjoy this movie more each time I watch it.",1180656000,2,455,4.055555555555555
2179648,5,B0006A9FJ6,"This match is one of my favorites to study for many resons. Borg's ability to hold out on the baseline on grass was unbelievable when you

consider the number of attacking players around at the time. In this case,

Vitas would be the classic attacking player against a great baseliner. Even though Borg did work on and develope a fairly reliable net game, he rarely if ever looked comfortable up there. If anything, I think his fitness was the main reason he was able to hold out for so long on a surface that didn't really suit his game. Being able to hold out for 5 sets & play at the top or near top of his game was certainly a reason for his sucess. He showed this clearly in the last set of this match, and it's for that reason I feel he won. There were few if any low points in the entire match and the competion from both sides was fierce. Plus, there are a number of great and just plain fun points, to say nothinig of one of the most funny moments when Borg, attempting to run around his backhand to hit a forehand return of serve, actually runs into Vitas' Kick delivery. However, you can, I think, see even here one of the reasons why McEnroe was able to finally defeat him. If you watch the rallies, you often see Borg bobbing up and back during a baseline rally, rarely moving forward to take a ball early unless he was moving in to the net. Watch Vitas and you'll see him forced back, but often he's moving forward to hit the ball even if he's not on his way into the net. Still amazing to watch Borg develope into a 5-time Champion. And what might have happened had he worked on taking more balls earlier from the baseline rather than constantly pulling back? This isn't a match to be missed and I consider it one of the best examples of the Baseliner VS the Attacking style.",1178668800,12,1790,4.24633431085044
2179649,5,B0006A9FJ6,"Peter Colt, played by Paul Bettany and Lizzie Bradbury, played by Kirsten Dunst, team up to provide a brilliant performance, which result in a wonderful film.

The theme centers around professional tennis and these athletes, through their competitive spirits, and desire to win... at all costs... provides the background for an incredible story, filled with romance, drama, comedy... and love!!!

The plot surfaces a tennis player, once ranked 11th in the world, losing his grip and ability to win. He confronts the end of a great career and is looking for alternative employment, choosing to teach at a ladies club.

This is his last Wimbledon tournament and there, he meets Lizzie Bradbury, who is a very strong player with a great future ahead, guided by an over-protective father, who strongly believes that a relationship would put an end to her concentration.

They fall in love. Their first encounter provides for great fun. Soon, they are madly in love... and this seems to be the potion our hero required to gain his power back, for he gets to the finals and may become the next champion.

Throughout the movie we found ourselves enchanted by the performances, the dialogue is simply superb, and the monologues of Peter... Peter Colt... are priceless jewels of British humor!

Sincerely recommend this movie if you want a winning combination to entertain you and your family... fun... clean... with great energy... romance... comedy... and tennis!!!

This is a semi-final, however, and it shows Rafter at his best. He undoes Agassi at his own relentless baseline game, mixing up spins and speeds, and then delivering the power shot. Rafter would go on to stun Sampras in the first set of the final, but then the rains came. He would not win-- perhaps he was destined never to win at Wimbledon.

2179654,3,B0006A9FJ6,"While it's nothing new, `Wimbledon' does serve up some nice entertainment to help pass the time.  I'm a fan of Bettany, I mean put him next to Russell Crowe and he shines, but here to me at least he struggles a bit to carry the film.  Dunst on the other hand is brilliant.  She's always as bright as ever, completely engaging and no one can argue that the camera loves her.  So, onto the film...this is a movie we've all seen a hundred times over.  Guy meets girl, guy likes girl, guy and girl aren't good for each other, guy gets girl anyway in the end.

Here that said guy is Peter Colt (Bettany) and that said girl is Lizzie Bradbury (Dunst).  Both Lizzie and Peter are vying for the Wimbledon championship, Peter being the wild card player, once ranking 11th now ranking 119th, and Lizzie is the hot shot new competitor who's favored to win in her division.  After a chance meeting the two of them begin `secretly' seeing one another, mostly because Lizzie's overbearing father Dennis (Sam Neill) who believes that any distraction will cause his daughter to lose what she's wanted her whole life.  The catch is that Peter's game seems to drastically improve the more he sees Lizzie while her game begins to worsen.

Like I said, it's nothing we haven't seen but Kirsten is delightful as always and a joy to watch interact with Paul, who while he isn't the strongest leading man still offers up the same wit and charm that we saw him develop in `A Knights Tale'.  It was also nice to see Sam Neill acting again.  Like many have mentioned, it's not as good as `Love Actually' or `Bridget Jones' Diary' but it is entertaining enough to pass a rainy day.",1166400000,3,1654,4.476666666666667
2179655,5,B0006A9FJ6,"I am not a fan of tennis, but I thoroughly enjoyed this film and the background. Kirsten Dunst plays a rising tennis star. Paul Bettany is playing a pro that was once ranked number eleven on the tennis circuit and has fallen to 119th at the beginning of the movie. Paul's character has given up on his professional tennis career but has drawn the wild card spot at Wimbledon.

Our two stars have great chemistry on film and it flows through to the characters. And of course Wimbledon is a co-star of this film. Besides the romantic comedy this movie is supposed to be, it also does a wonderful job of showing the inner workings of Pro Tennis. The tennis through out this movie looks real. The director has succeeded in making the actors look like great players. And the stress and determination it takes to play the game at this level.

This movie is actually two movies combined into one. A tennis film and a witty romantic comedy that is about chasing your dreams. And shows that if you are going to try and succeed at something, in order to do your best you must do so with all your heart. It is worth watching.",1162252800,,1114,4.402912621359223

If you like romantic comedies, this is a really good one.  Paul Bettany is really good and if you are or have ever been an athlete you can identify with his inner dialogue as he is competing.  They way it is shot and edited is quick and clean.

The only slight flaw in the film that  I noticed was just a few lines between the two main characters that got a little sappy.  But then again, I may be more cynical about love than most.

Also, because they is no nudity and they only eluded to sex without fully showing it, it is appropriate for older teens.  (They show them in bed afterward and clothes strewn on the floor but no graphic scenes)

I highly recommend this film as a feel good romantic comedy.",1155686400,5,936,4.202247191011236
2179657,5,B0006A9FJ6,"It's hard to define what makes 'Wimbledon' work so well where the vast majority of other romantic comedies are such utter flops.  The ending is somewhat predictable, the story follows the same basic line, there's the usual healthy interspersing of sex and jokes. But still, there's something special about this movie that makes it simply a joy to watch.

Certainly, the chemistry between Paul Bettany (as the seasoned tennis pro) and Kirsten Dunst (as the enfant terrible of the game) goes a long way toward what makes 'Wimbledon' so worth watching. Whenever these two are on the screen together, from their first meeting to the final shot of the film, they seem utterly meant to be together.  They seem to share a genuine warmth and easy attitude together, never a put-on or an act. Rarely have I seen an on-screen couple that seemed so natural and unforced.

The humor of the film is also of a higher caliber than most similar movies. Always clever and sharp but never overdone, the laughs in the movie are many, and they are also remarkably genuine.

The style of the film, capturing the tempestuous game of tennis both on and off the court, helps a great deal as well.  Most romantic comedies don't go the extra mile of capturing their subject so well, but I came away at the end of 'Wimbledon' energized equally by the sportsmanship I'd seen (an illusion remarkably well pulled off for the movie) as I was by the flowering romance essential to the story.  From dynamic, 'follow-the-ball' camera shots to timed-exposure and uniquely dramatic angles and editing, I found myself enjoying the film for its technical wizardry as much as the story -- and I didn't even realize until it was over and I watched some of the DVD extras just how much of the film was crafted after the fact!

'Wimbledon' is the sort of movie that you can get caught up in easily. Truly warm, charming, and funny, it's just the sort of pick-me-up movie that can lighten the darkest of spirits, and make you feel good about love and life.  And really, what more could you ask?",1154822400,8,2051,4.659279778393352

Will Lizzie learn that swinging a racket means on court and not in bed?  These are the earth shattering questions answered in the inane, cutie, treacle film, Wimbledon. While Paul Bettany give another excellent and solid performance as the charming Peter Colt, audiences have to tolerate Kirsten Dunst, whose performance is both whiny, irritating, and uncoordinated.

Reading the many reviews on Amazon I often wonder if people have actually seen the same movie. However, this film more than any other proves to me that personal taste is completely unpredictable.

I shouldn't like this film - I play tennis every week and used to play for the county when younger - and neither leads look like they could actually hit a four year old chipanzee off the court, let alone have a ranking. Admittedly, Paul Bettany's character carries off the ball skills a little better (what is Kirsten Dunst's service action supposed to be doing?), but the chances of him winning any match are fairly slim.

I'm English - a film that focuses and sort of celebrates our complete inablity at producing a tennis champion seems a little like a kick in the b**ls. That he only succeeds because he finds inspiration from an American lass is like grabbing my nipples whilst kicking me in the ba**s.

I live in Wimbledon - just two minutes away from the All England Club, and every year I curse the arrival of thousands of tourists, eagerly clogging up the streets, clutching their ticket to experience what is essentially two people hitting a pressurised rubber ball at each other. The sudden and frequent down pours and extortionate strawberries only seem to increase their enjoyment.

I grew up in Brighton (the seaside town where Peter keeps his flat) - how romantic it all looks, all lovely Victorian lamps and run down tennis courts in prime reality. So where di they hide all the brides-to-be that are found running around town every weekend with a kiss-me-quick hat on and an L plate attached to her back? Cos without them, this isn't the Brighton I know.

Also, the flat that Peter keeps.....Sussex Square. Where Cate Blanchett lives...house and flats going at 2m plus. His furniture maybe IKEA but he hasn't done too badly from his 'playing' to earn enough for that pad.

But the funny thing is. It doesn't matter, any of it. I like this film and I have no idea why. It could be because of all of the things above and that it simply resonates more with me, but this film make me smile and leaves me feeling a little warm inside.

The chemisty was unique.  I forgot that it was a movie.  Those are always the best ones.  When they looked at each other, or smiled, the flirting and other relationships were very believable.  The bonds seemed very real.  The characters seemed to geniunely like each other and to belong together. I found that to be true of all of the characters, not just the main couple.  I find this to be very rare in movies.
Being a little bit of a wise acre myself, I always enjoy the witty repartee.  It abounded in this movie!  It never seemed forced or fake.  I don't usually enjoy watching movies over and over, but this one never bores me and I always get caught up in it again.  The magical chemisty does that for me.

From what I read, Colt meant to be played by Hugh Grant too but due to his commitment elsewhere, Brittany took his place instead.  In fact, the Colt's character suited him to the dots and tees.  Colt was a retiring professional tennis player that had passed his prime and someone who's talented but lacking of self-belief and conviction.  Then, his world was turned upside by meeting the feisty but talented female tennis player in the form of Kirsten Dunst.  They fall for one another instantly to much the dismay of Kirsten's character's ambitious father, suitably played by Sam Neill.  Talking about art imitates art!!  Haven't we read about Mary Pierce's father, Jelena Dokic's father and even Maria Sharapova's father?  That gives the reader an idea, no?  Anyway, inspired by his new found flame, Colt became a more rounded player whilst Kirsten's character's game was falling apart.  This is a classic feel-good movie where in fictitious term, England gets to finally  win the silver plate back and that the top guy wins his girl.  Originally, I thought the movie would be dull but surprisingly, it's fun and gripping to watch.  In the end, I really vouched for Colt to win.  Simplicity in this movie is deceptive and the extra features showed how to make the actors and actresses into professional players, the significance of CGIs.  Professional players such as McEnroe, Everts gave this movie some credibility and technical advisor in the form of Pat Cash helped too.  The players commented that what made this movie real to them was the fact that the inner voices that kept talking to them and that's when they need to focus preventing themselves from being choked at the crucial moments.  Overall, a movie made with respect and sensibility and not just for the tennis fan.  Highly recommended",1139097600,3,1927,4.96875

But, he doesn't pull off the romantic leading man in this movie. As for Kirsten Dunst, she is the perfect cast as the bratty American tennis player. But she and Bettany simply do not have the spark on the screen.  Maybe these two actors do not have the chemistry to make a romantic film all together. That's just too bad, because I like them both.

Kirsten Dunst, while always cute, is slightly weak in her role, but that is more than made up for by Bettany, who will one day catch the right part, in the right movie, and become a household name. He shines wherever he goes.

The tennis action is servicable (intended) and the romance is more or less believable--their chemistry works. We honestly do root for their relationship in the end, even though Dunst's character is a little questionable. The supporting parts run are all pretty fun, but sometimes a little over-the-top (for example, the sports agent). The editing/camera tricks, with its slow motion, freeze frames, hyper-color and voice-over narration don't really add anything and, at times, distract. Certain aspects, like Bettany's relationship to a ball boy, are a little syrupy and unnecessary.

Overall, this movie will not set your world on fire, and it has some flaws, but they don't prevent the film from being a cute and worthwhile romance. For a date night, recommended.",1130716800,4,1197,4.915841584158416
2179667,3,B0006A9FJ6,"""Wimbledon"" is a charming love-conquers-all romantic comedy set in the highly competitive world of professional tennis.

Peter Colt is an aging player who has slipped to 119 in the world rankings; it is for this reason that he plans to hang up his racket after what he believes will be his swan song appearance at Wimbledon.  What he isn't counting on is that he will meet and fall in love with a beautiful and sexy up-and-coming player named Lizzie Bradbury, a turn of events which seems to be having a very positive effect on his game.  Soon, he's racking up surprise, come-from-behind wins in the tournament, becoming a major focus of attention for appreciative fans all over Great Britain.  The problem is that, as Peter`s game improves as a result of the romance, Lizzie`s seems to be getting worse, a fact which threatens to put a serious strain on the young couple`s burgeoning relationship.

Although the story itself is rather innocuous and silly, Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst do achieve a genuine rapport on screen.  It's also nice to have a protagonist in a romantic comedy who is not exactly in his physical prime and who is facing some of the rigors of advancing age (he's all of 30, practically his dotage when it comes to professional tennis!).  Moreover, the setting is novel and there is just enough of that brittle British humor in the screenplay to keep the film from feeling puerile and canned.  It's true that Lizzie seems to be an entirely different person off the court than she is on, but that is just one of those inconsistencies we tend to expect from a movie in which credibility isn't necessarily a prime factor in determining our overall enjoyment of it.  And director Richard Loncraine manages to generate some genuine suspense in the final showdown between Peter and the odds-on favorite he isn't expected to beat.

""Wimbledon"" is pure Cinderella romantic fantasy crossed with a David and Goliath, underdog-takes-on-the-reigning-champ sports story.  If either of those genres appeals to you - or, even better, if both do - you should have a fun time at ""Wimbledon.""",1122249600,3,2098,4.848739495798319

2179669,4,B0006A9FJ6,"""Wimbledom"" is told from the point of view of Peter Cort, a player that at the beginning of the movie defines his place in tennis quite accurately. In his words, ""Presently ranked 119th in the world. Sport is cruel. Now I know it doesn't sound too bad. Four million tennis players in the world, and I'm 119th. But what that really means is this - 118 guys out there are faster, stronger, better and younger. And it gets you thinking"".

The plot of this movie is simple: two professional tennis players meet at Wimbledom, and start falling in love. One is Peter Cort (Paul Bettany), playing his last tournament before retirement, and very accustomed to losing. The other is Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), a budding tennis star playing her first Wimbledom, a young woman that loves to win and is good at it. Their relationship starts to have unexpected results, as Lizzie impresses on Peter some of her on-court aggressiveness, and he stars to win, to the amazement of everybody (including himself). Of course, there is more to the plot of this film than that, but what would be the point of watching it then?.

All in all, I can say that I was unexpectedly surprised by this film. The truth is, it is really good, even if you are not much into tennis (and yes, that is my case). It isn't a classic, and it isn't perfect, but it is an excellent choice if you like movies that are a good mixture of romance and comedy. If you do, I highly recommend ""Wimbledom"" to you  :)

He decided to retire from pro tennis. This was last Wimbledon for him. He met with Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst) and this relation gave him a big motivation and he started to win. At the same time she losses her concentration. His family, his friends, and her father were in the relation. It is very well filmed, perfect British comedy. It is as good as ""Love Actually"".

2179671,3,B0006A9FJ6,"This movie is a nice way to while away an evening with a romantic partner.

""Wimbledon"" is a romantic fantasy based at the tournament of the same name in London starring Peter Cort as Paul Bettany, an aging English tennis veteran, and Kirsten Dunst as Lizzie Bradbury, an American star on the rise. Sam Neill plays Lizzie's ineffectively protective dad.

The film was shot during the Wimbledon tournament and many of its on court action sequences were captured before the actual crowds that gathered for the tournament. This gives the little fantasy and element or realism unusual in this kind of movie.

The two leads meet early in the film and strike up a romance almost instantly. It forms the basis for the movie, which revolves around each player's turn at Wimbledon. The film is about equal parts romantic and tennis fantasy, and succeeds equally in each portion.

No principal won any award for this movie but its sum is probably larger than its parts, the reaason it so clearly succeeds as a feel good/date/romantic film. It must have been a great movie to see with a date, perhaps a first date that you had high hopes for. It remains a fine evening's entertainment on DVD.",1121126400,2,1181,4.718446601941747

The acting wasn't so bad, but the script lacked any real depth, and outside of a few facets (their relationship with their family, and their love for tennis), the characters were very simple and hardly explored. This one was literally a snooze-fest.",1120521600,7,627,5.26

Until she meets Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) who has nothing to lose but his heart. What starts off as a one night thing turns into something that can last a life time. But Lizzie ( Kirsten Dunst) has to decided whats more important winning at Wimbledon or winning at love. This movie has great scenery and the acting was wonderful. The whole movie was great execept the last 30 mins. They kind of drag on as Peter plays his last game. I think the end could have been a little better but just the same the movie was good through and through. I would highly recommed this movie.

2179676,4,B0006A9FJ6,"I play tennis frequently and like to watch it on TV, and my wife likes romantic comedies, so this movie was a very good blend for our tastes. On top of that, I really enjoyed the film and found it an above average comedy, since it delivers great laughs in an unexplored topic with good actors.

Everything starts with Peter Colt (Bettany) playing in one of the tournaments that serve as a preparation for Wimbledon. He is in the declining stage of his career, since he is thirty-one and lately he has been consistently crushed by up and coming young players. This explains his current ranking, 119th in the world, which has dropped considerable from his best at 11th. In most people's mind he has another point against him, he is a rich kid, and it is common belief that you need to be really hungry to be a top player and succeed.

Wimbledon looks like Peter's last chance to achieve his dream (same as every pro player in the world has), and the experience starts better than he expected, right from the moment he arrives at his hotel. A mix-up with the room assignments ends up with him going into the room of Lizzie Bradbury (Dunst), an American star expected to win the female singles. After seeing her in the shower, Peter's day clearly improves. When later they start a relationship, the plot evolves around whether it is possible for them to have this and still be focused on the tournament or not.

Having Pat Cash as an advisor certainly helped to make the tennis aspects more believable, for example we get to see how superstitious tennis players are. When Peter starts winning he does not want to change to a better hotel room, similar to what Gustavo Kuerten did when he was an unknown player and ended up winning Roland Garros. Some other aspects of the movie also shown similarities with the real world of pro tennis, like Lizzie's relationship with her controlling father, bringing to mind the cases of many famous females players in the tour.

The movie is an above average comedy because the subject matter is original and it has the power of keeping us interested throughout the almost two hours it runs for. Dunst and Bettany are very good in their roles, and I was surprised when I found out that none of them had played tennis before. Even though in the scenes showing games the ball was not actually directed by the hitting of the actors, but rather through CGI, they had to mimic the strokes, and for beginners these were pretty good (Pat Cash's influence again). For many couples out there in which the guy does not really like romantic comedies, and the gal does not like sports, this may be a perfect compromise.",1117929600,,2639,4.584745762711864
2179677,3,B0006A9FJ6,"When I saw the previews, I groaned.  Here was another film with Kirsten Dunst as the star, getting all the attention, while everyone else falls at her feet.  But this movie is really about Paul Bettany and his not so quiet end to his tennis career at the biggest stage pro tennis has- Wimbledon.  Bettany plays Paul, an aging pro who has slipped from the top 15 of the rankings (I was eleventh!) to 119, barely enough to get a wildcard entry into his last tournament.  After a quick defeat, he will go be the tennis pro at a local club.

Upon arriving, he is given the key to a gorgeous suite, which he thinks is odd.  When he enters the room, he sees Dunst in the shower and quickly leaves.  But of course, they will meet again, and even have a fling which becomes love.  He seems bolstered by the relationship, but she seems to lose focus on her game.

Oh, that's right.  She is a tennis player too.  I forgot to mention this at the beginning, because frankly, I can't figure out what the point of having her be a pro tennis player was.  She has about 2 scenes where she actually is playing, and while I am no tennis expert, I can tell you without doubt that she has zero game.  However, she is not only a pro, she is an American phenom who is appearing in her first Wimbledon.  But the movie smartly avoids seeing her on the court much, because she is terrible at tennis.  Paul Bettany is better, and looks more like he can play, which is why he gets the lion's share of time on the courts.

Is the ending predictable?  Of course.  It goes without saying that the ending will be happy on both fronts.  It is cute, and watchable, and in the end, it has some charm.  I do want to mention, however, that I don't really like the direction PG-13 movies are heading these days.  This one has that rating, yet it features the following:  A full body silhouette of Dunst in the shower, well lit, several shots of Bettany's behind, naked, and an affair which starts about 10 minutes after the main characters have introduced themselves to each other.  They are seen in bed, obviously naked, more than once, and I just can't see the point in showing that to a 13 year old.  The movie was just as good without any of that, so why is it there?  Just for money I guess, why else?",1116633600,8,2269,4.257611241217798
2179678,4,B0006A9FJ6,"This is a now familiar trinity of film companies -- Universal, Canal Plus, and Working Title joined forces again to produce a romantic comedy featuring Paul Bettany and Kirsten Dunst.  The film is made with golden formula -- two likeable characters, one from America meets the other from England, both falling in love with each other.  Though 'Wimbledom' is no 'Four Wedding' or 'Nottinghill,' it is still very charming in its own way, largely thanks to Bettany who keeps on surprising and amusing audiences with his down-to-earth persona.

Though you think Ms. Dunst is the star of the film (after her 'Spider-man' success), the film is virtualy about one Peter Colt (Bettany), English veteran professional tennis player who is thinking about retirement.  When Paul wearily participates in Wimbledom tournament using wild card, thinking this is his last entry in this prestigious games, he meets a young, lovely, upcoming star of the court, Lizzie (Dunst).

Like Hugh and Julia in 'Nottinghill,' she falls in love with him, a bit too suddenly.  There are some obstacles between them including the media and the lack of confidence on Englishman's side -- like 'Nottinghill' again -- but the old-fashioned ending is there, you can see it from miles away.  Paul is surrounded by unique characters, his daddy living in the tree house, his brother always betting on his opponents, and the ladies at tennis club, as 'occupational hazzards.'  At first look, the film's script seems done by someone like Richard Curtis, but in fact it is not.  (It is by Adam Brooks, 'Practical Magic,' the sequel to 'Bridgit Jones' and Jennifer Flackett & Mark Levin.)

Richard Loncraine helms the whole film fairly well, but the film's charms all come from the two leading actors, especially Paul Bettany.  His apparently tired attitudes suddenly change into unexpected defiance, expressing the subtle moment of life when you choose the quiet resignation or the smallest hope.  In short, he is an old underdog who is allowed to win for the last time, and his acting is superb enough to cover the lack of  chemistry between him and Dunst.

The story is predictable, but that's nothing bad in this film.  You wish Paul Colt to win the game, and Lizzie's love too, and you certainly get what you want.  That's the part I like best about 'Wimbledon.'",1116115200,,2324,4.951030927835052

I usually get pretty exhausted by overly familiar romances, and Wimbledon is about as familiar as they come.  You know the drill:  Boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back.  On top of this age-old plotline, Wimbledon stacks a whole series of cliches from the sports film genre, right down to the... well, I won't spoil the ending, but suffice it to say that you won't be terribly surprised when it happens.

Still, the two main characters are absolutely charming.  Lizzie Bradbury is a teenager who is taking the tennis world by storm.  Peter Colt is an older, fading star, the sort of player who makes you grimace when you see him on television because you can remember just how good he *used* to be.

It's not hard to imagine what they see in each other:  She gets a taste of his experience and his love for the game; he gains a little of her fire and enthusiasm.  An amusing subplot involving Peter's family spices up the story, but in the end, it's still one cliche right after another.

Still, cliches become cliches precisely because they work, and Wimbledon uses them to good effect.  It never challenged me as a viewer, but it never insulted me either, and I enjoyed myself throughout.",1111190400,6,1277,4.528384279475983

I thought it interesting that Lizzie's father was her 'coach' - probably he always wanted to be a tennis player and was living his dream through his daughter. Isn't that the way it usually  works?

I found myself cheering in the end. I don't know anything about tennis, but did catch a glimpse of LOVE meaning zero when Peter commented that he was experiencing it. I particularly liked the slow-motion effects during the matches. Cool.

No need to go into the plot as others have already done so. If you like the tennis scene, you'll like this movie. And, if you like romance (who doesn't?), you'll like this movie. . . a happy ending.

However, was I ever surprised at the film I got.  First of all, Dunst does give us one of her better performances.  She's a driven tennis player with a smart mouth and eagerness to win at all costs.  As with most parts she plays, even the ones she's not so good at, Dunst is able to draw us into the psyche of the character.  However, the real breakout in this film is Paul Bettany.  Bettany gives us an insider's view of a tennis player in his 30s who is getting too old to win against the teenage up-and-comers.  This Wimbeldon tournament will be his last and he hopes to take home the tropy for himself and his country.  It is this behind the scenes view of the tennis world that makes the film most interesting and you really start to root for Bettany's underdog character to take home the championship.  Along the way, you also start to root for the burgeoning relationship between Dunst and Bettany's charatcers.  One other great thing about this film is its English setting and the quirky English actors throughout.  James McAvoy as Bettany's brother is absolutely hilarious; although, it is hard to believe that the dark-haired, several inches shorter actor could be Bettany's brother.  Also fabulous are Bernard Hill (Lord of the Rings' King Theoden) and Elanor Bron as Bettany's parents.  Although the ending is a little too saccharine, it doesn't deter from an otherwise great film.  Bettany and Dunst has great chemistry together and the insider's view of tennis, of Wimbeldon, is very interesting.

Bettany who was in ""A Knight's Tale"" & ""A Beautiful Mind"" as well some English films ""Gangster No. 1,"" ""Dead Babies"" & ""Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang)"" has good screen magnetism with his blond hair/blue eye looks and a the self-assuming character of Peter Holt for whom modesty was a way of life.  Dunst, who it will be interesting to see in Sofia Coppola's ""Marie Antoinette"" this year, does a good job as the driven tennis professional Lizzie Bradbury who has a lack of tolerance for movers & shakers but connects with Peter Holt.  Sam Neill as Lizzie's dad isn't called upon for a lot, but delivers with believability.  Eleanor Bron does a nice cameo as Peter Holt's mom who falls back in love with his dad during the flick, kind of a foil character romance.  She appeared in the Beatles' ""Help"" film back in the 60s and more recently in ""Iris.""  The special features on the DVD are also interesting.  As I watched the film, I didn't have an inkling of all the efforts that went into the excellent tennis sequences, actors hitting at air with tennis balls being computer generated.  It looked fantastic on screen.  The movie builds nicely to the climax as Holt seeks Bradbury among the cheering crowd.  I thoroughly enjoyed this romantic little gem.

Surprisingly Kirsten Dunst, her performance, her expression, her acting in this film is quite intriguing although I'm not a big fan of her. I think they really do make some chemistry in the movie. Alright, if you're a tennis fan or a good tennis player, don't expect to see both Kirsten & Paul playing tennis as a real pro even though they'd been trained for 6 months on how to swing and pose like a pro. Some scenes may make you laugh at their serves and strokes. Anyhow, see it as a romantic comedy will give you some fun time.

2179690,2,B0006A9FJ6,"Wimbledon is a dull romance centered around the tennis event in Britain.  A washed up tennis contender, retiring at the end of the season improves his game and goes onto win after finding true love with Kirsten Dunst.  Conversely, her game suffers because of their romance.

Bottom line, there wasn't enough going on with the characters to make the viewer care.",1108598400,4,361,4.885245901639344
2179691,4,B0006A9FJ6,"Ok, so this movie may not be to everyones taste, and it does have some problems, but on the whole I found it light hearted, often funny, and somewhat of an uplifting romance caper. Paul Bettany plays an old man in a young mans game, in this his last Wimbledon tournament as a ""wild card"" entry, before fading into obscurity as a Tennis Pro for a nouveau riche London country club. Enter Kirsten Dunst, as a vibrant young superstar in the making, fiercely guarded by coach and father Sam Neill, who has aspirations for her to be the next big thing. An unlikely chemistry appears between these two very different players, who almost fall unwittingly fall into a pre match ""workout"" style fling. His game improves ten fold, whilst hers begins to suffer under the unwelcome (as seen by her father) distraction of a boyfriend of any kind. One or two little tiny comic subplots lace the back story, and we are kept guessing as to the outcome of it all, however apparent it may seem to begin with. Is Ms Dunst just having fun? Is this love at first stroke? Will she lose? Will he win against all odds? Much fun is had along the way at a little under two hours in an old fashioned love tug sort of way, with some inventive camerawork and direction, and wonderful cameos from the likes of John McEnroe, and Chris Evert. Bettany is excellent, and a believable tennis pro (considering he couldn't play before filming) and although Ms Dunst hardly has to delve into her acting bag of tricks, the film has more in the merit than complaints department, for me anyway. Probably not huge on the repeat viewing scale once you know the end of the movie, but if you are looking for some clean romantic fun, a good story, and good acting, look no further. 4 stars is a little generous, but still a lot of fun. Enjoy",1108252800,4,1795,4.458966565349544
2179692,1,B0006A9FJ6,"Normally, I give these kinds of movies a break, and I usually like them - Notting Hill, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Bridget Jones, Love Actually, About a Boy, You've Got Mail - all had merit in one way or another.  I thought this would be in line with all of those movies.  I thought it would be a bit unbelievable and a bit predictable - but in the end cute and amusing.  I like the Brit actor.  I really like Kirsten Dunst.  It can't be too bad, can it?

Wow - was I wrong.  This movie was a new low for the romantic comedy genre.

It was predictable and unrealistic, and on top of that the story was so pathetic and thin that they had to fill up at least a quarter of the movie with fancy special effects on the tennis court that hid the fact that these actors can't play tennis.  The characters were so shallow, undeveloped, and wooden that there was no way to have any feelings for them.

Gosh the tennis/Wimbledon details were even screwed up.  When was the last time a men's quarter final match played on an outer court?

Add that to the fact that the production wasn't very good either.  Obviously they screwed up recording Dunst during the shoot because several of her scenes were obviously overdubbed later - overdubbed poorly.

Please avoid this movie unless it is the only one on Earth that you haven't seen.  Even then might I suggest pulling your fingernails out - it will be more stimulating.",1107648000,6,1408,4.361538461538461

2179694,5,B0006A9FJ6,"This story is a classic and fit for anybody. Acting is great and it is truly a heart warming story. Additional features are great including the making of Wimbledon and the story about how the Wimbledon tournament is produced.

2179695,4,B0006A9FJ6,Finally A Movie involving Tennis! Wimbledon is absolutely 2004's best romantic comedy! Bettany and Dunst are one of the greatest on-screen couples! Their chemistry is amazing! This movie is an unforgettable experience!,1107475200,3,218,5.84375
2179700,4,B0006A9FJ6,"This is one of the better sports movies to come out in the last ten years.  The plot is very similar to For the Love of the Game, with an aging star making a last stand supported by the love of a woman.  In this case the star is Paul Bettany, who has never quite risen to the top of the tennis world.  He falls in love with Kirsten Dunst, an up and coming American star who is at her first Wimbledon.

The plot doesn't really have a lot of twists and turns - if you are looking for a movie with suspense, you will be sorely disappointed when you've figured out where the movie is going based on the first 15 minutes.  That is not necissarily a bad thing - everyone knows Romeo and Juliet will meet a tragic end, but it is still an enjoyable play.

The drawbacks to the film mostly revolve around Dunst's acting and her charachter.  The acting is subpar, particularly compared with the classically trained British/Australian contingent around her (including a solid but not spectacular turn by Sam Neill as her father).  She doesn't look particularly comfortable playing tennis, while Bettany looks like he's been playing all his life.  Most disturbing is the fact that Dunst's character's age is never addressed - most females play in their first Wimbledon in their mid to late teens, giving a creepy veneer to Bettany's 31-year-old falling in lust, then in love with her.

There are a couple of solid cameos in this film, including a surprisingly witty John McEnroe commenting that he'd 'be burning the stadium down' after a bad call.  The film has several funny parts that help keep the mood light; during the commentary Bettany says that he and Dunst made a choice early on to have some sort of light moment at the end of each one of the romantic scenes, which keeps the film from being too full of itself.  There's a thematic element with a comet that has returned that is horribly overdone and could easily have been edited out, but that is the exception rather than the rule.

The DVD has a commentary with the director and Bettany which is mildly amusing but nothing spectacular.  There are four featurettes that all basically boil down to different aspects of making the film.  The technical effects one is particularly interesting since you would never guess that most of the tennis balls that are batted around in the film are actually CGI - this film is actually a case study in not having your effects and special camera shots get in the way of a good story line.

The most imporatant thing about this film is that it is a love story set against a backdrop of tennis instead of a tennis movie with a love story.  Even if you don't appreciate the finer aspects of the game the story, unlike in For the Love of the Game, is strong enough to sustain the film without the action on the tennis court.",1107216000,4,2807,4.494094488188976
2179701,4,B0006A9FJ6,"Although billed as a romantic comedy, this movie is as much, if not more of a discussion about the psychology of winning in an athlete. The romantic comedy is an aside to the real plot of how an aging tennis player who never had a taste for the jugular deals with winning and losing -- on the losing side of a long career.  Paul Bettany plays this scenario well, and his internal dialogue as he hits those critical match points make this movie alone worth watching. As a romantic lead, he's winning, if not overpowering.  He and Kirsten Dunst have a nice chemistry, and make an attractive couple,  though the romance and comedy plots seem secondary to the main theme of winning.  You don't have to know anything about tennis to find this movie worth watching.  Not a strong five star romance, comedy or sports movie, as it tried to be a little of each, and thus can't succeed overwhelmingly on any one of the three.  But it combines them credibly, and should provide something for everyone.  Mostly it is memorable for the wonderful portrayal of athletes in clinch moments and the discussion of how they deal with them. Dunst is somewhat less driven than you'd expect her to be, and her father, portrayed by Sam Neill is the least credible of the trio -- you are expecting a stage/tennis dad, and he is far more easy-going than seems believable. But watch Bettany, his struggle with how to win is the real point of this movie, and enjoy the eye candy side plots for what they are.",1106438400,3,1480,4.520599250936329
2179702,4,B0006A9FJ6,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I especially liked the tennis action, which was done in CGI (special effects), to make Dunst and Bettany look like real tennis pros.  I thought they did a good job in convincing the audience that they were actual tennis stars.  I almost forgot that they were actors.  The movie captures some brilliant action shots and sequences.  If the tennis scenes are not believable, then the whole movie would have tanked.  The ending of the movie was pretty predictable and has been done a million times, but other than that this is a good movie and story.",1106092800,4,576,4.653465346534653
2179703,3,B0006A9FJ6,"Wimbledon is a cute romantic comedy, that follows all the rules of the genre. What makes the movie good is the tennis. Even if you don't like the sport, you'll find yourself at the edge of your seat as you watch the matches.",1106092800,,224,4.232558139534884
2179704,1,B0006A9FJ6,"Why would Paul Bettney's character,who is 31 years old, be afraid of the father?

The whole movie is one big cliche. A script that could have been written by a monkey. Line such as:

""Your turning my first serve into mush""

Dunst and Bettenry drive at high speeds in a convertable for hours and there hair doens't move AT ALL?

Just bad, so bad.

What also was wierd was that I sensed some homosexual overtones in the movie. A shot of Betteny's ass that doens't make sense.

And then a scene in which Betteny is in the suana with his playing patner, another guy, and I thought they were about to kiss: very strange.

2179705,5,B0006A9FJ6,"Well I'm a Brit and have wanted to see us win Wimbledon since I was a tiny girl.  I loved this movie, I really felt as if we'd won at last.  It was such a cute movie, with a really feel good factor.  If you're a Brit & you like tennis (what Brit doesn't like Wimbledon?) watch it.  Best film of 2005 for me so far.  My MUM is Wimbledon's biggest fan, but unfortunately she can't get it over there yet.

2179706,4,B0006A9FJ6,"Director Richard Loncraine delivers a sweet romantic comedy about two pro tennis players who fall for each other on the grass courts of Wimbledon.  When Peter Colt (Paul Bettany) is accidentally given the wrong room key, he meets brash, ambitious Lizzie Bradbury (Kirsten Dunst), one of the top women players on the tour.  Lizzie is the darling of tennis fans and the press while Peter is on the way out, about to retire and start a life as a pro at a local club.  The two decide to have a fling, no strings attached, but (of course) they find themselves caring a lot more than they expected.  The problem is that Peter distracts Lizzie from her game even though she increases his focus, and Lizzie's controlling father (Sam Neill) is furious.  After all, Lizzie is a star, and Peter is not.

Tennis players will cringe watching the technique of Kirsten Dunst because there is NO way that motion is going to deliver the killer serve she supposedly has.  The same is true of her ground strokes.  Bettany is slightly more believable.  Still, if you can get past the amateur tennis technique, this is a sweet, if predictable, movie about the unpredictability of love and sports.  The computer graphics make the games exciting, both visually and by triggering the rush of the game.  The romantic chemistry between Dunst and Bettany is believable, even if Bettany has the stronger presence.

""Wimbledon"" is a second-tier romantic comedy, not among the best but certainly deserving of an audience.  The spunk of both Dunst and Bettany make this an enjoyable, charming film about love, competitive edge, and finding the balance between the two.",1105660800,17,1637,4.845323741007194
2179707,5,B0006A9FJ6,"Won't go into the movie details as they are throughly covered by other reviews.  Excellent writing, directing, effects, authenticity, script and actor chemistry.  Enjoyed from start to finish.  This movie is a keeper.",1105660800,,217,5.515151515151516
2179708,2,B0006A9FJ6,"Was the purpose of this Hollywood film to see how just how many clichs they could fit into a two hour timeframe?  Perhaps it was just I, but I counted nearly twenty in the first hour.  From the accidental meeting to the overuse of the ""good luck charm"" theme, Hollywood successfully packed in these and a bunch more for this little British film.  With clichs weighting down the truck of this ride, we also have two actors helming it that need more skill in the romantic comedy genre, or else they may find themselves veering off the road and down a steep hill crashing into more and more poor films.  Bettany was not a substitute for the Hugh Grant style of British acting that this film desperately needed, while Kirsten Dunst is not aging well at all.  Her acting seems to be depleting with her charm and looks, causing us to actually watch the tennis games in this film instead of their performances.  Thankfully, we had these CGI tennis matches to watch, which was the only eye-catching element to this entire film.  It covered the element that Bettany and Dunst were lacking, which was talent.

So, was I too harsh with the beginning paragraph?  I don't think so.  What could have been a decent film with better British actors and a stronger leading lady, eventually fell apart with the nonchalant emotion of Bettany and the ""collecting my paycheck"" style of acting from Dunst.  Even veteran actor Sam Neill couldn't escape the clutches of clich as he played the same father-esque figure that we have seen time and time again in this genre of film.  I hope his paycheck will go to the reconstruction of the broken nerves in his face that were unusable in this film thus giving us a reason why his character did not smile nor show any form of emotion towards his daughter or boyfriend.  It was as if he was rehearsing for a role in The Stepford Wives instead of this movie.  These three actors literally gave the worst performances of their career.  They never broke their own mold, but simply followed the lines and direction given to them from the script.  If the script itself could have done its own acting, this may have been a better film.  Instead we are lead on an emotional carriage ride that has squares for wheels and seems to be lost the entire time.  If I had to give a reason as to why this film was not as successful in the box office as it could have been, I would have to say it was the acting.  It really slumped this film deeper into a darkened corner.

If one can look past the acting, there really isn't anything else to see.  Lacking the excitement from a sports film, even if it is tennis, director Richard Loncraine follows the same route as every other sports film released by Hollywood.  Imagination was not a prerequisite for making this movie.  From the overplayed underdog story, to the forced connection between Dunst and Bettany, to finally the unemotional ending, Loncraine gives nothing short of disaster.  When these films are being produced by the dozens in Hollywood, it is your job as the director to give us something new.  Either a fresh face, or a fresh course of events.  Do not fall into the same clichs over and over again, as it seems that Loncraine has opted to do (referencing my comment about packing as many clichs as possible into this film).

If I must note only one good thing about this film, I would have to go with the use of CGI.  Apparently, the graphics department was ordered to use their imagination to give us a new perspective on the game and to freshen up the look of tennis.  This was successful as I thought that the uses of CGI to capture the effects of the ball on the court were outstanding.  It is an element not used often enough in sporting films, so it provided some ease to my eyes that were swollen from the rest of this picture.  As I think about it, even the CGI was a bit disappointing because it proved that the actors were not actually playing the sport, thus only destroying whatever believe we had in their feeble characters.  Oh well, I tried.

Finally, I would like to say that I was a bit disturbed by the idea of Bettany and Dunst together.  I felt that their relationship was built upon Bettany doing better at the game.  She was his good luck charm.  He knew that from the beginning, yet decided to stay with her to help him reach new heights of fame and fortune.  He, in other words, used her.  Director Richard Loncraine does a fantastic job of avoiding this issue and placing the entire emphasis on love.  That is all fine and dandy, but we need reality to take into effect her and demonstrate that without Dunst, Bettany would have ultimately failed.  Loncraine tries to give us some explanation at the end of the film (not to give anything away), but is unsuccessful because of the clich surrounding it.  I personally thought there was no emotion between the two love interests, only this dark addiction to being victorious that kept these two together (or at least one rushing after the other).  Think about this as you watch the movie.

Overall, this film was pitiful.  Nothing in it was spectacular, nothing was imaginative, and nothing sparked any bit of creativity or excitement for me to pick up a tennis ball and begin playing again.  Bettany and Dunst gave the worst performances of their careers as they stumbled through the emotions and lines of this film.  With these two hardly showing any skill it was only a matter of time that the remaining elements followed suit.

Grade: ** out of *****",1105401600,5,5498,4.5350253807106595
2179709,5,B0006A9FJ6,"this movie is somewhat cheesy but, BUT effective. once again I wish to tell people the greatest performance are not from those actors just seemed trying so hard to spray that so ""wow"" performance of their on screen, but from those who play so involved with their character and so make them fun while you are watching them play. I admit I'm toward to like Dunst's movies but she always allow me to like her be in her role as she pretty much deliver her ""involveness"" on her character most of times ( may be except for spiderman series). You must admit in usual terms american stars and british stars don't look quite bright toghether, its either the american actor try too hard to be british or the other way around. In this one Dunst jsut play herself all the time which WORKS. The movie doesnt really ask you to think of the possibility how those2 actually loves each other but it simply telling you they speak differently and they do like each other and that's just how it works, even Notting Hill that got me doubt about the2 but this one is essential enough. Works on me.

matching scene are predictable but the camera works quite well and I didn't raise any complaints. What I don't like is the story is very very apparently benefits the male side, I'm a male I do like to be the hero all the time but I guess I'm decent enough to see that the movie pretty pity on the prize is not just as important for the girl as for the guy. IT is not the question whether which racial side but the problem is Dunst's character doesnt seem like one taht would give it up so easily, the only flaw in the movie, overall is jsut enjoyfull",1104883200,3,1627,4.316993464052287
