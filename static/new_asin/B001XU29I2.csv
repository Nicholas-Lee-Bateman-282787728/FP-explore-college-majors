8347716,5,B001XU29I2,A superb documentary of a design genius. His work will last for a long time and the images and sounds of this masterpiece will help to maintain his legacy.,1436486400,,155,4.379310344827586
8347717,4,B001XU29I2,Content of the program is excellent.  Only complaint is the quality of the video itself.  Looks like it was transferred from a  videocassette instead of transfer from the original film.  On the basis of the content I would recommend it.  David E. Weber,1373068800,2,252,4.767441860465116
8347718,3,B001XU29I2,"This programme dates from around 1982 and includes a lot of very interesting videos and information on a wide variety of FLW architecture including some less well-known buildings.  Some of the scenes have been staged with period costumes and vehicles to better show the building as it would have appeared in context when first completed.  Content deserves 5 stars, but I can only give 3 stars due to the poor video quality.  It appears to be taken from an old video tape with low definition images and juddering even for slow image panning.  Plus the DVD is a cheaply produced DVD-R (or similar) rather than a proper factory-produced DVD.  Overall, I don't regret buying this, but if only the producers could have done some image restoration (since afterall the images are so important in architecture), and I think that this disk should have been priced at around half of the listed price, say US$12.",1273708800,11,901,4.824675324675325
8347719,5,B001XU29I2,"This 75 minute video with the help of the Arts Council of Great Britain presents many intimate photographs of many of Wright's homes and projects. This video does not focus on the controversy surrounding FLW's life, but explores in great detail the work of the man and those who influenced him, including his Welsh family and roots and Walt Whitman. Anne Baxter, one of Wright's granddaughters, does a masterful and calm presentation of her grandfather's work. This is THE video that you want in case you cannot do a 'round the country tour of Wright's projects, which seem to span from The Guggenheim Museum in New York to the Marin County Civic Center in California to Taliesin West near Scottsdale, Arizona. Save some time, money, and air fare by purchasing this disc, which is far less expensive than a complete tour of the many FLW projects which are shown in this video. The emphasis of this DVD is on the design, craftsmanship, and integrity of FLW, and not on his apparent ""mistakes"" of his life. This video will be good for the family, the classroom, AND for the Soul. Happy FLW viewing!",1263772800,7,1096,4.713541666666667
8347720,5,B001XU29I2,"The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright is a thoughtful, well crafted presentation of a gifted man who through his entire life was concentrating on creating special and unique architectural designs which incorporate the site - landscaping which supports and illuminates the design, the architecture itself, which stretches technology and imagination to its limits, the interior design which complements the end users life and lifestyle and the furnishings - furniture and accessories, textiles which are an extension of the design and a part of a well thought out whole.

Great visual presentations of a great variety of Wright projects.

Also, it is very nice to have the narration for the film done by award winning actress Anne Baxter who was Frank Lloyd Wright's granddaughter.

Overall, very worthwhile for those who don't know or who already know about the man and his work.  Very informative.",1252713600,4,898,5.258741258741258
