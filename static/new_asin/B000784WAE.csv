Very much disappointed by the adjudication that took place in this competition: the vote was definitely stacked the WRONG way -- all the way. Just so you know, the Houston Sigma's HAD IT TOGETHER -- great comraderie, esprit de corps, the look was commendable and professional. Get the project just to see them.",1157328000,2,426,5.085714285714285
