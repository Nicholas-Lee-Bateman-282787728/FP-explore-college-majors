8751309,5,B01BSW1O62,"This is a must have DVD for GG Allin fans. I've seen stuff like Hated and that one hour interview with Merle and Dini Sex where they talk about the whole life of GG. This is interesting because they found some tapes from 1991 with GG talking about everything going with his life at the time. He talks quite a lot about his time in prison and how the secret service caught him and interrogated him for two hours. He talks a lot about his many arrests and the countless times he's been in hospitals over injuries that he couldn't just walk off. There's a lot of GG being himself, and at a point in his life where his on stage persona really blurred so much with his personal life. The quality of the video and sound is good, they did touch up the original video footage and put in some filters for dramatic effect. They have a selection of songs from the Carnival Of Excess album with newly created music videos, like using footage from early 90's photo shoots or some, where they use animation in a style really similar how GG would draw. It's a no frills package, you get a DVD menu with a play button, and that's that. There's no bonus materials, but really the whole DVD is like a bonus set of unseen footage. It's about an hour and 13 minutes, there's nothing that feels like filler, and they did a great job editing this footage together and remastering it.",1464220800,4,1361,4.341176470588235
