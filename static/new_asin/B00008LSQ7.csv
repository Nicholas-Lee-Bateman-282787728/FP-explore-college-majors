7985302,3,B00008LSQ7,"One may wonder why a film with several distinguished and popular actors, which is the case of ""Semana Santa"", has had no Amazon-U.S. reviews until now (writing in Jan. 2015). Well, there are a dozen of them, at present, for the film in its North American packaging, as one finds it on the North American edition viewed (Alliance Atlantis 20645) as ""Angel of Death"" (in French titled ""Ange mortel""). The film has not had much of a welcome on DVD, judging from Amazon and IMDb reviews. That is understandable, however, despite so many good ingredients, not least of which are the beauties of traditional, Spanish Baroque encrusted and super-Catholic Sevilla as well as elsewhere in Andalusia, the movie's settings, which also are its filming locations. The first part of this motion picture makes Seville's visual splendour very present to the viewer's attention.

The other truly major visual asset is Olivier Martinez, the French actor of the Spanish family name. He looks in top form, and, let us face it, the man who has been called ""the French Brad Pitt"", rather inappropriately due to the decidedly latin character of his undeniable physical beauty and grace, thus differing considerably from Pitt's very Anglo-Flemish/American brand of charisma) is terrific ""eye candy"" to find in such a minor-league film. Unfortunately, Olivier Martinez' acting, as seen here, does not manifest itself, alas, at his best. Mostly Martinez displays too seldom relenting states of irritation, pique, and male-chauvinistic boorishness; although that is, of course, in large part the fault of the movie's mediocre script, Martinez' crude acting here on this outing does nothing at all to compensate or to make the best of it. It doubtlessly would be rather a pity for many that the film gives such an elegant stud, as Olivier Martinez certainly is, no occasion to shed some clothes! Probably the film's often incoherent script left him too uninterested in any potential results. Martinez might just as well have employed that part, the visual one, of his gifts on a good photographic fashion-shoot in Milan or Paris rather than on this motion picture.

The rest of the cast is better, whether marginally thus, or, in the case of the ageing and very great Alida Valli, sublimely so. Mira Sorvino is the female lead who is a criminal investigator, in harness with Martinez, looking together into the spooky case of a serial murderer in ecclesiastically anonymous disguise (due to the red hood that completely obscures his head, as hoods, mostly white, abound all over the place in Seville's Holy Week celebrations) whose identity and motivations the two investigate. Sorvino's acting is better than Martinez', but not by much. Again, she seems miscast and probably as bored with this incoherent project as her far more glamourous male co-star is.

For views of Sevilla, one would do better to acquire a tourist video about the famous old city. For the story, one definitely, too much so, would have to read the novel on which this farrago is based. There just is too much of the story about which the movie leaves those watching it frustratingly in the dark. So, this is a visually splendid film, but one that lacks too much in the quality of other good cinematic ingredients.",1420243200,,3259,4.998158379373849
