nothing good to say about this movie.....just a waste of  time",1439424000,,127,5.0476190476190474
7011003,1,B00TJ61HWQ,This is a terrible movie ! up there with Noah,1439251200,,45,3.6
7011004,2,B00TJ61HWQ,I am a big Star Trek fan.  I saw Connor Trinneer's face on the cover and the five star avg so I jumped right in and rented away.  Bad move.  I think five of the actors must have voted.  It's not a complete waste of time...just don't expect much.,1439251200,,245,3.938775510204082
7011005,2,B00TJ61HWQ,"Wow, pretty bad.",1439078400,,16,4.666666666666667
7011006,5,B00TJ61HWQ,Incredibly fun movie!,1438905600,,21,6.333333333333333
7011007,5,B00TJ61HWQ,A classic western but with modern day (high octane) action and story. The cinematography is phenomenal. Some of the best I've seen in a western. What a green and beautiful world to set this story in. The hero and villain were both fun to watch. The sound department didn't do a good job but the Camera crew deserves some kind of award. I don't usually watch independent films or westerns but this was a nice surprise. Make more!,1438905600,3,428,4.5
7011008,5,B00TJ61HWQ,"Loved it. Is very appropriate considering all the attention big game hunting is getting now days. Connor Trinneer is wonderful as always. Loved the rest of the cast as well. My only complaint, it left me wanting more.",1438905600,3,217,4.7368421052631575
7011009,5,B00TJ61HWQ,"Connor Trinneer is great in the old west and Nadia Lanfranconi looks amazing with a shotgun. Fun action, a good story by Rene Perez and some of the best scenery I have ever seen!",1438646400,5,178,4.264705882352941
7011010,1,B00TJ61HWQ,Story could have been good but the way it's played out is really comical. The credits and music go on for what seems forever. The opening scene has no explanation or leading into it. Just a really poorly staged fist fight. And goes down hill from there.. Like a lot of these movies Amazon is offering are not worth the price even if it was free I'd not be inclined to watch it.  I shut it off  about 5 minutes after the man hunt began. The trailer is not really a good indicator of how good or bad it is.,1447027200,,504,4.03
7011011,2,B00TJ61HWQ,Not worth the time--,1446940800,,20,4.25
7011012,3,B00TJ61HWQ,"Interesting plot in this low-budget movie. Good performance by Connor Trinneer. Nice locations in California. The music is distracting, though; too loud and poorly executed.",1445904000,,173,5.96
7011013,2,B00TJ61HWQ,Too much like a B movie for my liking,1445817600,,37,3.2222222222222223
7011014,4,B00TJ61HWQ,good watching,1442880000,,13,6.0
7011015,5,B00TJ61HWQ,I love Connor. Great old western style movie. Love it. Watch over and over many times.,1441670400,,86,4.4375
7011016,3,B00TJ61HWQ,"Not to bad.
Could have been more realistic though.",1441152000,,50,4.666666666666667
7011017,5,B00TJ61HWQ,As expected.,1441065600,,12,5.5
7011018,1,B00TJ61HWQ,I would give it 0 stars if i could,1440720000,,34,2.888888888888889
7011019,3,B00TJ61HWQ,"What follows is only my opinion and worth exactly what you paid for it. Oh, there may be some spoilers so proceed with caution.
First, for the most part the music was amateurish, most of the acting wooden and the production values left much to be desired. For example all the clothes looked new as did the weapons. The scenery was beautiful. Not sure why the Mad Maxx shoulder pad was there.
I am a fan of Connor Trinneer from his work on Star Trek so I gave it an additional half star for that alone.
There were some obvious holes in the plot. For example {SPOILER} at the beginning of the film the sheriff asks Chamberlund if he got the all the guys that killed his wife, but later the lady who takes his daughter away says the sheriff, the jury and the judge didn't believe his story.  Also it must have been a very quick trial since he looked the same as he did when the sheriff took him in.
Now having said all that, It wasn't that bad. Increase the production values and replace some, not all, the actors and it could be a good movie.
It held my attention and didn't require much participation on my part. Its a good, kick your feet up, relax and don't expect too much from it kind of movie.",1439683200,,1197,4.22707423580786
8702005,5,B00TJ61HWQ,It's like the episode of Enterprise where they go to the old west planet. But it's only Trip. What more could you want in a movie?,1521331200,,130,4.038461538461538
8702006,3,B00TJ61HWQ,"As I suspect many viewers of this film did, I watched it because it starred Connor Trinneer, ""Trip"" the engineer from Star Trek:Enterprise. Conner did very well. But the overall film suffered from the writer/producer/cinematographer/editor trying to wear too many hats. From the outset, it was cast as a violent film. But the so-called violent scenes in this film looked like they were filmed in the 1920's. I am not a fan of excessive violence in films; but the violence in this film was so muted that it robbed it of the urgency demanded by the storyline.",1510531200,,557,4.752577319587629
8702007,5,B00TJ61HWQ,Great  product and good seller experience,1474070400,,41,5.833333333333333
8702008,3,B00TJ61HWQ,ok,1472774400,,2,2.0
8702009,4,B00TJ61HWQ,Connor Trinneer is in it.,1466553600,4,25,4.2
8702010,1,B00TJ61HWQ,"Worst credits (how can you screw that up?) fake fight scenes, bad audio, bad music, bad direction, beautiful scenery with bad camera exposures.
Less than a B movie. You may have never seen a film this bad, you surely have never paid for one!
Amazon should be ashamed to charge for this.  I was robbed of 1 hour and 20 min of my life!  I want it back!
I like Conner Trinner but, he was wasted on this -almost home made flick.",1458345600,,424,4.158536585365853
8702011,3,B00TJ61HWQ,It was a good movie,1457049600,,19,3.0
8702012,3,B00TJ61HWQ,kind of predictable,1455580800,,19,5.666666666666667
8702013,5,B00TJ61HWQ,"Hd is up and personal....Connor I loved, the old man great job, the pretty lady that cared for the little girl was really good and I liked her attitude . I really liked the movie I did wished little longer I agree music in some areas way too loud and so was f the breathing or example (eating breakfast) but all in all I love it. I can't wait till more core ,... I lo ed it!!!!!",1450656000,,378,3.9220779220779223
8702014,1,B00TJ61HWQ,If I've ever seen a movie this lame it doesn't come to mind.  The seventh graders down the street could make a more exciting western.  Certainly they could write a more exciting story and play the parts better.,1449187200,,210,4.5
