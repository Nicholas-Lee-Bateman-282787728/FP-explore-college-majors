8662197,5,B00KWM5VYG,"I saw this film many years ago on cable TV shortly after it's 1981 release. Since then I have been waiting for a DVD release and finally decided to buy this French edition. The film quality is excellent and the additional bonus features (in French) are very good. Amanda Plummer gives a stand-out performance as 'Cattle Annie'. If you enjoy an entertaining Western, I highly recommend this film. It deserves a much wider audience. On a separate note, this DVD includes the English version of the film (with French subtitles), plus a dubbed French version. There is also a 50-minute documentary on Burt Lancaster (in French, with no English subtitles).",1492992000,,651,4.927272727272728
8662198,4,B00KWM5VYG,"Since I wrote the novel ""Cattle Annie and Little Britiches"" and the first four drafts of the movie as well, I'd give it a four for acting, and a three for keeping the spirit of the novel. There was another writer who came after me who softened it all up. The script should have been much tougher. But the producers were afraid to make it that way because they were terrified of the critical response. I wanted the picture to be more like Badlands than Sky King. Too soft, to sweet but still pretty good. Burt Lancaster was great, and Diane Lane and Amanda Plummer were excellent. Steiger was ok. Maybe the next time they make it they'll listen to me. After it was shot Alan King, the producer, admitted to me that they should have gone my way. It was ok. It could have been great.",1480723200,3,780,4.312925170068027

8662200,4,B00KWM5VYG,"This is a rare piece.  So rare I hadn't seen it before.  I also agree that the French sub titles were annoying and I could not get rid of them.  This was a good little western about two young teenage girls (Amanda Plummer and Diane Lane)  romanticized by Ned Buntline's dime novels deciding to tag along with the Bill Doolin (Burt Lancaster) and Bill Dalton (Scott Glenn) gang of outlaws.  The outlaws are amused by the girls and let them ride along as they plot disasterous crimes while trying the avoid Marshal Bill Tilghman.  This film is based on real characters and Annie McDoulet and Little Britches (Jennie Stevens) were eventually captured and sent to the Massachusetts Correctional Institution.  An entertaining little western and well worth a watch.  Also remember like most Hollywood movies the truth is stretched a bit.  Lancaster was 67 as he played Bill Doolin, when Doolin was shot to death he was 38.  But the movie is fun.",1425859200,2,939,4.7407407407407405
8662201,5,B00KWM5VYG,"Excellent quality, sound etc., on this French import movie which was not available any other way. Must admit though, I wish I could get rid of the French Subtitles even though the sound was in English, but after enquiring I was told this was not possible, may think again in future ...",1422489600,3,285,4.5
