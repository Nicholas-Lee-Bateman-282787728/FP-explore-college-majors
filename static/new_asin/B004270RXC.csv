4246764,5,B004270RXC,"This is an absolutely EXCELLENT war movie that draws on human emotions and doesn't over glorify war, but rather shows it honestly. At the finish I was absolutely mesmerized. This film is an experience, and not just a movie. I couldn't stop watching until the credits stopped rolling and the screen reverted to the main menu. Its that good. If you appreciate war movies, this is a ""must-see"". The direction, tightness of the script, based on the real life diaries of Oliver Woodward, and quality of the actors of this movie is unbelievable. Everything works and comes together. This DVD from amazon is excellent, and is all-region NTSC format, so you can watch in the USA.",1299024000,3,671,4.793103448275862

4246795,4,B004270RXC,"The film Beneath Hill 60 is a very good film about Australian miners trying to dig underneath German lines and blow them up.  The perspective is relatively new and the movie really gives you a sense of how dangerous it was to do their kind of work. All of the actors are believable and do a very good job.  The camaraderie between the soldiers is very well portrayed in this film.  It has a lot less cliches than your average troop film.  The movie does have some flashbacks developing the Oliver Woodward the lead character's back story.  He seems way to old to date the teenage girl who has a crush on him.  I like that fact that Oliver is not really accepted by his troops until he proven himself to be an effective leader.  The movie does a good job of showing the horrors of trench warfare.

I found the film highly engaging and was interested the whole time.  The German troops on the other side are also played as competent and smart trying to figure out what the English are doing on the other side of the tunnels.  The movie is very authentic and the CGI graphics that are used blended in very well seamlessly as they should be.  I wish more movies would be directed like this focusing on realism and not just CGI special effects to carry the film.  The film does not really touch on the chemical warfare side of the war when both sides were gassing each other maybe that was toward the end of the war.  I liked the opening monologue letting the audience know that both sides were at a stalemate and looking for ideas to advance on the enemy position.  That would not really be accomplished until the end of the war and dawn of the tank.

The most famous film focusing on Australians fighting in WW1 is Gallipoli starring Mel Gibson which came out 1981.  I liked Beneath Hill 60 much better, it was interesting seeing what great lengths the miners will employ to accomplish there mission.  They required a lot more thinking and technical skills, I found those scenes exciting.  Overall I would recommend the movie and rate it 4 stars.  I was not expecting much from the movie and was pleasantly surprised.",1440806400,,2114,4.458333333333333
4246796,5,B004270RXC,"This movie is thought provoking and takes one through an experience, which is mind-boggling; it is an experience unheard of in today's world of warfare.  This movie places one in the very private & isolated environment of the individuals beneath hill 90; it not only exposes one to the experiences miners have to tackle underground, but combines everything with a once in a lifetime experience of underground combat.  This sort of combat is something we may never every see again in history; it is something I am sure many are not aware-of, and it is something we should never forget!  I know I will never forget this movie, and I'll never forget these civilian warriors!  It is a must see movie!",1439510400,,696,4.7272727272727275

4246801,3,B004270RXC,"This film tells the story of Australian tunnellers in WW1. Many had been civilian miners and they dug some incredibly deep tunnels under German lines to plant explosives and counter German efforts to do the same. It was quite a deadly cat-n-mouse game at times and this is shown in the film. This means there are several scenes shown underground featuring candle light and whispering. Generally these are easy enough to follow, though at times I found it a bit hard to hear some dialogue. The story is clear enough, with a focus on the huge mines planted under German positions at Messines in 1916/17. A few developments are slightly confusing but there were some interesting technical angles, especially the problem with water seepage. There are also a few war clichs but the reality of trench life, the army and tragic deaths invites these. The general look of uniforms, equipment and sets is quite authentic. Theres a bit of over-acting at times and an awkward passage or two but overall it is a reasonable war drama with a different basis to most other war films. I cant see myself watching it a second time though, so 3  stars.",1429747200,,1132,4.717171717171717

4246804,3,B004270RXC,"Based on the true experiences of a soldier who served underground during the First World War, the films tempo suffers a bit because of its frequent flashbacks to the mans prewar life. Apparently the filmmakers felt the need for plenty of above-ground scenes, to prevent the everlasting tunneling from giving audiences a bad case of claustrophobia, but unlike the classic Second World War tunnel-movie The Great Escape, there don't seem to be enough good factual or fictional excuses for interesting open-air action.

Also unlike The Great Escape, which did perfectly well without a woman in the cast, Beneath Hill 60 is one of those war movies that include a love interest, which I suppose might be hoped to improve the films appeal to female moviegoers. Focusing much of this movies fresh-air scenes on the developing romance between the soldier and his future wife provided that draw, as well as a couple of opportunities for comic relief to lighten the mood.

I do pretty well with understanding most British and Irish accents, but I don't hear Australian speech very often, so until I got used to the Down Under accents, I had some difficulty deciphering the dialogue. This was complicated by the whispering in the underground scenes, but sometime before the halfway point, I got up to speed.

It strains credulity a bit that an officer would have been sent to the front line without his understanding what enfilade fire is; likewise, for there to have been a soldier who could have experienced a significant amount of action under fire, but who still thought he could outrun machine gun bullets. The film also employs the popular lions led by donkeys perspective on the upper-echelons, and does it in a rather heavy-handed way.

But despite its weaknesses, the movie does a good job of shedding light on an aspect of early modern warfare that tends to be overshadowed by the artillery, the aircraft, and the futility of frontal assaults, which constitute the usual focus of First World War films.

4246840,5,B004270RXC,"I wish that the U.S. film industry would learn some lessons about how to make an excellent character-driven drama from the Australian Film Industry. In Beneath Hill 60, the Australians continue to demonstrate the art of fine film making. It is not about non-stop special affects or ridiculous love triangles, but developing characters so that they seem like real human beings. Even though the film focuses on an Australian Tunneling Company at the Battle of Messines Ridge in June 1917, where thousands died, the film manages to evoke empathy for each character and deaths are thus more painful. The story is dramatic and well told, of how the Australian company assisted in completing a tunnel underneath a key German position on Messines Ridge. Interestingly, the film also depicts several German characters and their attempts to detect and defeat the Australian tunneling effort, so there is a cat 'n mouse aspect which adds tension to the film as well. There are some cliches in the film, such as displaying British senior officers as pompous and careless with men's lives, or the father-son team that you just now will end in tragedy. Nevertheless, Beneath Hill 60 is an excellent war film and succeeds in highlighting an aspect of the First World War (tunneling) that has not been covered in any detail before.

The film starts with the entrance of Lieutenant Woodward to the Australian mining company, presumably in early 1916. Initially not like \d by the senior non-com, Sergeant Fraser, Woodward eventually wins the men's loyalty by his caring attitude, technical competence and willingness to stick his neck out for his men. This aspect of the film is basically a primer on effective small unit leadership. Once all doubts are removed, Woodward (now captain) leads the company on the next asssignment to Messines Ridge. I was a bit surprised how the company was depicted - always the same 8-10 men and the unit can all move in one truck. The film mentions briefly that hundreds of men are working on the tunneling project and surely Woodward's company had more men, but they simply aren't depicted. It's also odd that he has no second-in-command (CPT McBain appears, but is commander of another outfit). The film goes to great lengths to depict how tuneling was done and the difficulties of dealing with the wet clay around Ypres. Viewers may not understand why the British/Australians were going to all this effort, since the film really doesn't discuss previous efforts to dislodge the Germans from this terrain. While the frequent flashbacks to Woodward's past in Australia are useful, a flashback that explained the missing ""why tunnel?"" aspect of the film might have been useful for viewers.

The final part of the film focuses on Woodward's efforts to complete the project before the Germans discover it. One German sergeant is depicted as identifying the Allied tunnel and makes a last-minute effort to destroy it. As with most Australian film efforts, the quality of the cinematography is gernerally excellent - they have a talent for displaying wide tableaus. The combat scenes are generally good, particularly an early effort to destroy a German machinegun position. Some scenes - such as the final detonation of the mine and the British bombardment - are a bit underwhelming. The special affects - such as artillery explosions - are not that realistic and look like TV affects. In the First World War, soldiers differentiated between mortars, light artillery and really heavy artillery and acted differently, based upon the particular weapon's lethality. Like most movies, the actors run around like wet hens whenever any shell lands in the area. I think that both All Quiet on the Western Front and the Price of Glory addressed this issue more realistically. It would also be great if film's like this tried to use more ""soldier dialogue"" specific to the time period - read any account of the Western Front and they are loaded with jargon, but the films avoid it. Jargon could be explained to the audience by using the ""new guy"" as a device to explain lingo.

The actors do a fine job and the film feels authentic as it's a true story.

4246865,5,B004270RXC,"This is an excellent Australian war movie, based on the real events, about the tunnelers - soldiers who waged a little known but extremely dangerous and deadly war under the trench lines during World War I.

This film tells mainly the story of one Australian tunneler unit, composed mostly of coal and copper miners, during their succesive missions on Western Front in 1916 and 1917, with the dramatic battle of Messines (7-14 June 1917) being the final fight. The main character is Lieutenant (later Captain) Oliver Woodward (Brendan Cowell), who actually really existed - this film is based on the written accounts of his actions which were conserved by his family.

The scenario is very strong and very dramatic. Fighting scenes are excellent. The conditions of life in the trenches during World War I are very skillfully recreated. Details of weapons and uniforms were very well respected. All actors performed very well and dialogs are good.

But the real strength of this film is the perfect control of the film by the director, who chose to show the ""War to end all wars"" by sticking to the facts and events and keeping drama and emotions at a reasonable level, and I believe this was a winning move. People certainly do not hide their feelings in this film and there is one scene with a shell shocked young soldier which is pretty intense, but the thing in never overdone. The language is occasionally very strong but here also director avoided the excess - as it is true that unlike Hollywood would like us to believe most people do NOT use the F-bomb in every sentence, even under stress... And I found that the tired and occasionally cynical stoicism of the ""diggers"" and ""tommies"" showed more about the horror of trenches in World War I than most of extraverted gesticulations and yellings.

A good idea was to alternate war scenes with occasional back flashes of Woodward's life in Australia before he joined in 1916 and especially his memories of the love of his life, Marjorie, who at 16 was still too young to be married when he went to war... Those memories of another life and their contrast with war in trenches are a very succesful thing.

I will not say much about the undergroudn war and savage fights in the tunnels shown in this film to avoid spoilers, but this is a unique thing. I never saw before a war film dealing with this particular kind of warfare and this one immediately set the standard to which any possible successors will be measured.

Another strong point is that even if one high ranking officer is shown as an arrogant and mostly incompetent jerk, as a whole this film does not criticize the army. Some characters which seem as snotty and unsufferable appear in a completely different light once shots are fired in anger and if generals and officers are ruthless, this is because they have no choice... The film shows that if war is mostly evil, it is not necessarily the case of people who wage it... And such a reasonable approach is a very rare and precious thing in modern cinema.

Bottom line, this is one of the best war films I ever saw and definitely the BEST war film I saw recently. Enjoy!",1355097600,,3140,4.657039711191335

4246868,4,B004270RXC,"Most wars run on a long time and contain many chapters. The chapter depicted in this movie was news to me. I know this same stunt was executed by the North during the American Civil War but I thought that was a one off. Evidently it wasn't.

Here's the scoop. The war fronts in France, and later in Belgium, are at a stalemate. To break said stalemate the army has recruited mining engineers to tunnel under the German lines to set off charges. Oliver Woodward is the guy they use to take down Hill 60 in Belgium. The Germans also have tunnels though it doesn't show them doing anything with theirs other than listening for the Allies. Will the plan work?

This is a nifty flick. It deals with the Australian troops in Europe which is something I never really thought much about. Digging tunnels under enemy positions is also a new wrinkle so there was a lot to see and learn here. The hero, Oliver Woodward, is an interesting guy. They show him at home down under as he begins a romance with a friend's daughter and juxtaposes these scenes with the ones in Europe. This isn't a new technique but it works well. The depiction of the war is good. The near constant rain and ubiquitous mud, lice and death really create a mood. There are some ""hi-lite"" scenes that are good and take you off track from the main story. They help break things up a bit. My only complaint is the outline. When Woodward enters the war he's in France. They're doing the tunnel thing for quite a stretch of time but nothing comes of it. Then he's sent to Belgium where they go for Hill 60. So the first near half of the movie seems to serve little more purpose than to introduce the viewer to the players. That being said, this is still a good watch. You learn a lot about tunneling and explosives and some things blow up real good.  The acting and all the production values are top shelf.

If you're into war flicks this is one of the better ones.",1351468800,,1923,4.348189415041783

Beneath Hill 60 offers up a closer and gritty look at the role that some Aussie Miners played in the war of the trenches and offers up a very realistic and frightening view of a little known segment of the war.
  Afraid of tight spaces or the dark, are you? If not, then this movie will make you afraid. It is a well done movie that will have you wondering how these soldiers fought this underground war and manage to do what they did. It also offers up a look at a quiet man (maybe a few at that and maybe a rowdy one or two as well) who reluctantly went to the fight and returned battle scarred as genuine heroes.

When Oliver Woodward (Cowell) and his men are called to the front lines of Germany in order to secure and protect a series of tunnels that are filled with explosives and is directly underneath the German stronghold of Hill 60 they are tested to thier limits.  One of the biggest problems facing new war movies is that inevitably they are compared to ""Saving Private Ryan"".  Besideds ""We Were Soldiers"", this is the only one I have seen that can stand up to the comparisons.  I'm not saying it is as good as those but it is pretty close.  Much like the other two, the focus is split between the action of the war and the personal struggles of Captain Woodward.  The fact that this is about an Australian battle and not an American one is irrelevant to Americans liking this movie.  You are so caught up in the story that country doesn't seem to matter (we were on the same side in the war anyway), and you still feel a sense of pride watching the men work.  This movie will not disapoint.  Overall, one of the best war movies I have ever seen. Watch this, you will be glad you did.  I give it an A-.

4246882,5,B004270RXC,"I would just like to thank the other positive reviewers on this page as it was due to them that I bought this DVD. I thought it was based on the book of the same name but the book is a follow up, rather like 'Saving Private Ryan'. This film itself tells of the exploits of a group of volunteer Australian miners who were employed during WW 1 to undermine and then blow up enemy German positions. It should be noted that most of the tunnelling was a British effort, but the aid from the Commonwealth was invaluable. I only found out recently that Chineses'coolies' were used extensively for the trench digging too. This then is part of their truly monumentally brave story.

The film is so authentic in its presentation of the terrible conditions endured by all sides at the front and is more astonishing as it was filmed in Australia and funded by inter alia The Australian Film Commission. The acting is spot on, the cinematography though not beautiful does exactly what you would want in terms of conveying the filth and the sense of claustrophobia when below ground. They do not shy away from the gruesome detail and Alan Dukes and Brendan Cowell are both excellent leads.

That said there is not one lack lustre performance and every one comes across as believable. The story is told with a modicum of flash backs but this is so well balanced that it helps the narrative flow. For fans of 'Birdsong' by Sebastian Faulks, this film will add to the plot. For fans of history it also tells a part of the amazing Allied attack on the Messine Ridge. For language wary types, there is some German with sub titles, but as I speak a bit of Deutsh I did not find it off putting. This really is a great film that seemed to just fly by (only one cup of tea - always a good sign)you will not be sorry for the purchase",1302566400,117,1809,4.397014925373134

The story follows the Australian tunnelers responsible for mining under the German lines and blowing them to Kingdom come. Every detail is well done both big and small and you are rewarded with a true story and an interesting one to boot. The mining war under the trenches is well realised, with the Germans launching countermeasures and everyone trying to be silent since the other side is listening and here the two sides duel. The situation above ground it well done too, with life in the trenches all soaked in mud and sometimes blood.

There is also some time devoted to memories from back home and here it helps that the Aussies have added a bit of humour that makes it all worth while.

8413248,5,B004270RXC,"This is a 5+ star movie with a great story line, great directing, and fantastic acting from all the cast members.  I first watched this on Netflix and luckily Netflix offered English subtitles because some of the Aussie-accented dialogs between the troops can be hard to decipher.  Disappointingly, the Multi-Format Blueray DVD that I bought here on Amazon doesn't contain any English subtitles or Closed Captioning.  I was still able to make out everything they said because I had watched the movie on Netflix with full subtitles and could remember most of the dialogs.  Someone watching this for the first time without English subtitles may have a much harder time making out what some of the characters say in that Aussie accent.",1494547200,3,732,4.975409836065574
