8277097,5,B001AD6UI2,"THE DEAD TALK BACK is one of those examples of cine-cheese that simply astounds with its all- around ineptitude; one viewing, and you'll readily understand why this flick was lost for thirty -six years.  It's as if someone had seen an Ed Wood film, and declared,  ""I CAN BEAT THAT!""  If you truly love bad movies, you must buy THE DEAD TALK BACK.",1467936000,,346,4.4603174603174605
8277098,5,B001AD6UI2,"'Manos: The Hands of Fate', 'Monster A-Go-Go', 'The Incredibly Strange Creatures'. This movie falls into the long list of movies skewered by Mystery Science Theater 3000. This is yet another film from said list that contains ridiculous acting, plot/structure/dialogue, camera angles, major lighting issues, etc. However this is what makes this kind of movie special. Yes watching this kind of film under the guidance of MST3K is a hilarious 90 minutes. But watching it on its own is an entirely different experience.

A scientist, who lives and works in the basement of a boarding house, is allowed to work alongside the police to solve a murder of another boarder from the house. They go through all of the suspects who all live in the house and in the end pick out the guilty person by supposedly talking through an amateur-ish radio setup. Which this so-called ""talking to the dead"" is fake as it is one of the fellow boarders acting as the murdered woman (to which no one noticed a fellow missing boarder!?).

That's the entire plot. But all things aside this movie is fantastic in terms of bad movies. I do recommend this but for only those who have had a vast experience into viewing these kinds of films. Thank you Amazon for making this film easily available on DVD.",1299456000,3,1274,4.760180995475113
