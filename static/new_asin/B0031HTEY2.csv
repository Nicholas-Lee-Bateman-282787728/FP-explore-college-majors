8386986,5,B0031HTEY2,I been looking for short workouts I can do while traveling. This workouts are perfect. I bought these workouts at a great price too. Stephanie is a great instructor.,1493769600,,165,4.724137931034483
8386987,5,B0031HTEY2,Love it,1448409600,,7,3.0
8386988,5,B0031HTEY2,"This is exactly the same video set as the Stephanie Huckabee's PowerFit with a slightly different name.  Amazon suggested them together so I bought them both as there is no information on the product.  Don't but both or you too will have 2 sets the same.

The set of DVDs is good.  Beginner level but great instruction/cuing and easy to follow.  Old Firm style instruction.  Good for an easy day.",1393545600,4,396,4.585714285714285
8386989,4,B0031HTEY2,I've always enjoyed Stephanie Huckabee's workouts.  As I've gotten older this 20 minute workout is great.  I usually combine with it with another dvd for a fun workout.,1368576000,,168,4.964285714285714
8386990,4,B0031HTEY2,"I really like the 5 different workouts in this package.  And at just 20 minutes each, you can do more than one of them a day if you have time and want to do more.  The only thing I didn't like was that she didn't give you time to learn the moves, so I was a little lost the first few times.  Overall, I would highly recommend this workout.",1363478400,2,339,3.8840579710144927
8386991,5,B0031HTEY2,"I enjoy the workouts, fast and fun. But 20 mins isn't really enough to lose weight. I like this for maintenance and when your short on time or a mini workout in the morning.",1355184000,,173,4.117647058823529
8386992,3,B0031HTEY2,"I like the DVDs, and it's a great set. Except for the fact that my DVDs arrived at my apartment scratched. Only one of them was damaged, but it's not so complete or ""a deal"" when four out of the five DVDs work. Stephanie Huckabee, however is very bubbly and motivating, I don't find her annoying as I do some other instructors and her workouts are grand. I'd suggest the DVDs to beginners such as myself or anyone looking for an easy and manageable workout.",1331251200,2,457,4.3882352941176475
8386993,5,B0031HTEY2,"I have been using these DVDS for about a month. I am 55 and have been working out faithfully for the last 15 years (when my kids were old enough to not need me every second!) I have at at least 50 different tapes and dvds I have used over the years besides using my treadmill and elliptical machine. I'm at the point of just wanting to maintain a decent level of fitness without wearing myself out so I'm totally exhausted when I'm done working out. So, since I've always preferred Stephanie Huckabee's FIRM workouts over most of the other FIRM workouts, I wanted to try these. 5 DVDS each 20 minutes. I do 2 DVDS each time and don't use the cardio one since I run. This is a basic workout that hits all the muscle groups and not to hard with the purple band. I am going to buy stronger bands to make it tougher. (The purple one that came with it tore already.) If you are new to exercising this is a great place to start or like me just want to take it easy but still maintain muscle tone this will do it. I also have arthritis and this is easy on my joints. This is NOT P90X, but a fun easy-going workout that you will feel. And I just like Stephanie Huckabee as a person!",1269129600,28,1174,4.108695652173913
