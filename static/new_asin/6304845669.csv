932788,5,6304845669,"Great Movie - Carter Wong's best in my opinion. Carter Wong plays
an invicible Tai Chi master who along with his cohorts kill the
top masters at a kung fu school. The students vow revenge and go
into training. One by one they go and challenge the evil-doers,
until only Carter Wong is left for them to deal with.
Unbelievable stuff in this movie. A definate buy for the kung fu
movie collector.",973555200,,394,4.410958904109589
932789,4,6304845669,"Carter Wong lends his star power to this otherwise small scale simple tale  of a villianous Tai Chi master.  The plot is passable and forgettable, but  the highlight are Carter Wong's fight scenes, demonstrating his Tai Chi  style, climaxed by his simultaneous drawing of a Tai Chi symbol with his  feet.  His fighting is not confined to the final battle.  On the contrary,  his fights are plentiful and very satisfying.  While the movie is not what  I would call a top-shelf movie, it is very entertaining in the 70s classic  tradition.",968284800,,537,4.791208791208791

933023,4,6304845669,"Movie: Born Invincible (1978, Chinese w/English Dubbing)
Rating: 3.5 of 5 (very good)

One of a better non-Shaw martial arts classics from the 70's.  This one features an entertaining variant on the 'revenge for wronged school / slain teacher' theme, and features an interesting spin on the invulnerable villain motif (compare for example with ""Kid With The Golden Arms"").  For me, the most enjoyable part of the movie were the series of training vignettes where one lead student after another trained themselves to a personal peak, and a unique personal style, and challenge the villain again, and again, and again, only to repeatedly fail in turn ... a film maker's ode to duty, honor and perseverence.

Recommended.",1460505600,,718,5.111111111111111

933132,5,6304845669,"This masterpiece of wushu martial arts, featuring Grandmaster Carter Wong - whose original training was in Shaolin but also has black belts in Taekwondo, Hapkido, Karate and Muay Thai (having trained under the greatest masters of the respective disciplines), and was also trained in Wudang and has pioneered an all new form of Tai-chi that incorporates various disciplines, and who has trained innumerable martial arts champions, as well as being the representative of kick boxing in the People's Republic of China, and is currently the martial arts instructor of over one hundred martial arts schools worldwide, that has been inducted into The Kung Fu Hall of Fame, can truly be considered one of the greatest martial arts movie of all time that puts martial arts movies from Hollywood to shame by making Aikido practitioner, Steven Seagull, and World Karate Champions, Jean Claude Van Dame and Chuck Norris, appear like ill-trained, fledging amateurs, whose worthlessness is self-evident in their Hollywood flicks.

The movie revolves around the innumerable failed attempts by the successors of a martial arts school whose Grand Master was killed while attempting to defend an old master martial arts - who has made a vow to Buddha not to engage in any form of combat but, nevertheless, finds himself being forced to fight the notorious members of a martial arts school seeking to gain control of the People's Republic, seeking revenge on their masters behalf only to find each successor being killed in combat by the invincible Carter Wong and the members of his school until a Buddhist nun and a Taoist priest provides them with the requisite training to defeat the bad guys.",1408665600,4,1679,5.1054545454545455
933133,5,6304845669,"I watched this movie during the 80s in old cinemas,it's one of the best kung fu movies I ever watched, Carter wong is superb with his tai chi technique, Lohlie also, but  I kind of not like his sword he attack his opponent with,the ending also,wong is a great fighter I doubt if he wasn't aware that his opponent might hit him on his throat.the movie has fighting scenes from the begining to the end,its a must for every kung fu fan. I rate this movie 5 out of 5, pls customers buy it, u won't regret. bye.",1325030400,,506,4.163265306122449
933134,5,6304845669,"Born Invincible is just one of those movies that you know is going to be interesting. The beginning of the movie is proof enough that you are truly in for a treat. The battle between the Hei-Pai killers and the school uncle is one of the most exciting demonstrations of weapon fighting since Master Killer.

True fans will fall in love with Carter Wong's Tai-Chi style Kung-Fu. The near invincibility of the Taichi style leaves our heroes Mark and Jack Long in a seriuous quandry: Find his weakness, or die. Fortunately, The Taichi master has one glaring flaw in his technique.

Can the heroes live long enough to exploit it? You'll have to buy the movie to find out. But I guarantee that you won't be disappointed.",1293148800,,715,4.622047244094488
933135,5,6304845669,"Born Invincible must be the most underrated kung fu flick. Kung fu fans never mention this one with the other great classics.  This movie is a true old school classic. It has ""great fighting"" scenes..many of them. It is hilarious. You will laugh every time you hear Carter Wong (who is the tai chi master) speak. Years of training tai chi made his hair white and voice high pitch. He also laughs every time he kills someone. Born invincible has every thing you like in old school kung fu... easily 5 STARS!!!!
$ well spend!",1051315200,6,523,4.505263157894737
933136,3,6304845669,"Is this film a little bit strange? I'm not a fan of Kung-Fu films per se, but this must be among the most ridiculous ever made. First, great fighting, with brilliantly implausible sound effects, and funny cartoon-y characters as well. The main bad guy, though, will crease you up. For some reason he speaks and laughs like an old lady in distress. It makes the film impossible to take seriously. Also, the plot and the final twist are very well worked, so that the whole movie is like a guessing game for both the viewer and the good characters. It's not classic film-making at all, but for a non martial arts fan I liked it.",1026950400,,625,4.443478260869565
933137,5,6304845669,"Carter Wong has come a long way from constantly getting beat up in Lady Kung Fu. His hair is bone white, He is invincible (execpt for an undiscovered weak spot)His voice is humorous & he has a sinister laugh. Classic Kung Fu Villian Profile. Sometimes the sound effects when he does his Kia gets annoying. But this one is definately recommended. Lo Lieh (5 fingers of death,White Lotus) is his right hand man. Both kick major butt in this one. Good fighting scenes, Good villians & Good training sequences make this a must buy for any true Kung Fu Movie fan.",1005782400,,558,4.534653465346534

933139,4,6304845669,"Carter Wong is amazing as the invincible Tai Chi master. He wallops all his opponents, and as if that was not enough, he draws a symbol with his leg when fighting. Lo Lieh is his colleague and they are trying to wipe out a martial arts school led by Jack Long & Mark Long. The fight scenes were quite decent, but I did not like the way it ended. The good guys were by far no match for the bad guys. This is definitely a movie to keep for any wutang afficionado. Also check out Carter Wong in 18 bronzemen.",985305600,2,505,4.06
933140,5,6304845669,"When I first saw this movie on the store shelf,I was attracted to the box. I have been trained from self-experience not to purchase a movie on mere sight of nice box art. However,I kept visiting the store several times to look at this box that I seemed to be magnetized to and after about a week,shelled out the cash for this film. What I discovered here was simply a masterpiece...A great work of art in it's own right. Carter Wong stars along with Lo Lei in this fast paced,action packed classic as bad guys who are a force to reckon with. After killing the teachers of a school and an old man who owes them a favor,The students of the school set out after Wong and Lei to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. This is not an easy task seeing as Wong was born invincible...invincible to swords,hand-to-hand combat,knives,poles and anything else that you can imagine. He has a weak spot,and out of the 108 pressure points found on the human body,He has one...All they have to do is find it....But for the incompetant students,this task isn't easy. I recommend this fu-flick to all fans of classic martial arts. It is simply a must-have in any true fans collection in my humble opinion.",984700800,,1187,4.525581395348837
933141,4,6304845669,"What can I say? I can say that this is probably one of the best movies that  has Carter Wong (Wong Ka Ta) in it. Then add such notables as Lung Fei and Lo Lieh and with fight choreography by Yuen Woo Ping and you have a great movie. Not to mention that this was directed by legendary director Joseph Kuo. From the open scene, you know that this is going to be good as the narrator gives you the history of Tai Chi (note there is little to no Tai Chi in this movie). Then the first fight between the Pai Mei Killers who are played by none other than legendary fight choreographers Corey Yuen Kwai and Yuen Shun Yi who have both done extensive work on Jet Li's more current movies. Also add in Kung Fu experts Mark and Jack Long who always shine. Their most notable roles were in 7 Grandmasters and World of the Drunken Master. The story is basic Jack and Mark Long must Avenge their masters death by killing Lo Lieh and the mad man Carter Wong. There is extensive training sequences as well as excellent fighting throughout this story up to the final fight scene.  I beg to differ with those that say that this is a run of the mill movie as it is one of the best of the old school genre.",984096000,,1186,4.12987012987013

Classic wuxia film of the late 70s with Carter Wong, not David Chiang starring and Joseph Kuo writing, producing, and directing - not David Chiang.  Virtually nothing in the description or ""editorial review"" above has anything to do with the DVD that's advertised.  I'm glad it was such a good movie, but my attraction to it was David Chiang.  So I give it 4 stars for quality and reserve that 5th star because the seller got lucky with a good movie and a meaningless and misleading description.",1505174400,,527,4.695652173913044
7878011,5,6304845669,"When we are talking standout hits outside of the Shaw Brothers umbrella, this one fits neatly within that category. Directed by Joseph Kuo who also has movies like 7 Grandmasters, Mystery of Chessboxing & 18 Bronzemen, this film centers on the white haired Tai Chi kung fu master in Carter Wong. It starts with his 2 top henchmen (two of the Yuen brothers in fact in Corey Yuen & Yuen Hsun Yi) on the hunt after an old man & his daughter. When students from a nearby kung fu school (headed by Lung Fei & students include Jack Long, Mark Long & Alan Hsui) come to their rescue, their destiny becomes alter when Carter Wong & his right hand man Lo Lieh enters the picture. This leads to a series of awesome fights, slick weaponry & a lot of vengeance along the trail.

Carter Wong played the role of the puglistic unbeatable Tai Chi expert as good as anyone we've seen outside of Lo Lieh's Pai/Bai Mei. Speaking of Lo Lieh, just add this to the stellar baddies he's played in the past with his crazy weapon chock full of secrets. Jack Long was fantastic as one of the students as well as Mark Long. Alan Hsu also look pretty good in the few fights he had. Lung Fei did fine for his time on screen.

All & all, this one cannot be missed if by chance any old school heads & those new to the genre has not seen this tour-de-force piece of work!",1493683200,,1339,4.247058823529412
