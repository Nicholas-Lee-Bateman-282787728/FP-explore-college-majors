6928788,3,B00RDTTAMK,"This 2-plus hour British docudrama on three major English historical events of 1066, including the Battle of Hastings, is narrated by Ian Holm from the Lord of the Rings series. It's also got a title, ""middle earth,"" and frequent references to ""orcs"" which suggest a LOTR approach even though these words come from ancient English. Anyway, once you move past the misleading cover title and art, you've basically got a 2-hour History Channel documentary without the talking heads here. While the film follows a plot, it's really just narration and re-enactment stuff. Informative, but not a ""movie movie"" if that's what you're looking for. It's also not quite a documentary.",1430524800,5,673,5.127272727272727
6928789,4,B00RDTTAMK,"I can understand peoples' frustration with the film's title. Tolkein named his setting based on Germanic mythology and the concept of Midgard. That being said, the title is true to the Anglo-Saxon/Norse view of the world, even in Christian  times. But, not everyone knows Germanic mythology. Shame on the BEEB for trying to cash in on the Lord of the Rings with the title. That being said, the film is surprisingly historically accurate. It's portrayal of the battle tactics, weapons and armor of the time are fantastic...much, much better than the History Channel's VIKINGS, which totally gets the Anglo-Saxons ALL WRONG. As another reviewer stated, the biggest weakness historically is Hastings itself. They did not depict the battle accurately and the mini series disappoints because of that. Fulford and Stamford Bridge were fairly well done, although it is my understanding that Stamford was fought in a field and not in a forest. Still, all in all, this beats the daylights out of any other Anglo-Saxon era film I've seen.",1428105600,17,1028,5.0828402366863905

6928792,3,B00RDTTAMK,"I'm sorry, but I have to laugh at the poor sods who accuse this historical docudrama of being a ripoff of the Tolkien franchise. Sure, the retitling of the 1066 miniseries was calculated to capitalise on Tolkien's current popularity, but the back-of-the-box description makes it abundantly clear what the story is about. In future, I suggest these people remember the old adage about buying a pig in a poke. In the name of full disclosure, my area of historical expertise is Anglo-Saxon England and the Viking Era, so The Battle for Middle Earth didn't excite me as much as the 1066 in the title.
  As to the DVD itself, it isn't really a movie, but - as I said above - a BBC 3-part semi-documentary miniseries. As such, it's quite good. It is far from perfect, but its sins are more of omission than commission. Harold Godwinson of England makes only a minimal appearance as does Harald Hardrada of Norway, but that's still better than Duke William of Normandy who only appears in the narration.
  My first disappointment with the series came when the narration depicted Harold as an opportunistic usurper who just happened to be at Edward the Confesssor's bedside when he died. In truth - and in front of witnesses - Edward named Harold as his successor. Even at that, ANY choice of successor had to he confirmed by the Witan (a sort of Saxon high council) which Harold WAS immediately. However, the usurper accusation was both Hardrada's and William's opinions, giving it some historical credence, so I let it slide with a minor deduction of points in this assessment.
  Luckily for the makers, the immediate run-up to the Norman Conquest lends itself to a 3-part story. Part One concentrates on the 20 September Battle of Fulford (Norse victory), Part Two centres on the 25 September Battle of Stamford Bridge (Saxon victory), and Part Three wraps up the story with the 14 October Battle of Hastings (Norman victory). Being shot on a television budget, the makers chose to tell this grand story from the point of view of the common folk. It was a wise move financially, but the Norman Conquest, one of the most pivotal points in world history, deserves a much grander stage. By avoiding the major players (including Harold's traitorous brother, Tostig, who is never even mentioned), the series relies heavily on telling the ""bigger picture"" through the narration by Ian Holm. (Yes, Bilbo himself which probably reinforced the mistaken ""Tolkien ripoff"" argument. I also grew weary of the narration calling the Normans ""orcs."")
  The costumes, weapons, and armour are very accurate, due mostly  - I presume - to the contributions of the Regia Anglorum group of living historians credited at the end. The accurate Old Norse and Old English languages as well as the way they blend seamlessly into Modern English for the audience's sake are very nicely executed. Needless to say, the locations are authentic, adding to the ""you are there"" experience. Holm's narration itself is accompanied by nice annotations regarding Eleventh Century mores and terminology (even though their concept of huscarls is somewhat off) as well as intermittent comparisons of the action to its counterparts in the Bayeux Tapestry.
The first two battles are fairly accurately portrayed for a television production; I particularly enjoyed the famous lone Viking defender of Stamford Bridge and the ignominious end he met.
  However, the narrative falls apart a bit with the Battle of Hastings.  Harold barely appears, as I said, and when he does, his armour and general dress - while accurate to the era - is more plain than some of the men of the shield wall. Speaking of the MEN of the shield wall, why does actual history always have to take a back seat to modern sensibilities? Yes, the director felt compelled to put a Saxon woman in the shield wall. (Sigh.) Before you scream ""Sexist!"" at me, I was equally disappointed that one of Hardada's Vikings, Snorri, joined Harold's fyrd to fight at Hastings. (That being said, Snorri was by far the coolest character in the whole miniseries with the Saxon, Ordgar, coming in a distant second.)  IF Snorri had joined Harold's army, a fighter of his stature would have become one of Harold's huscarls, not simply fallen in with the farmers of the greater fyrd.)
  The Normans are portrayed as being so utterly loathsome (which, to be honest, they generally were) that the narration feels compelled to add, almost in an aside, that they weren't ALL monsters. The Battle of Hastings goes about 75% true to history, so I wondered if maybe the BBC was running out of funding for the series by that point. The battle's abbreviation perplexed me since Hastings was THE battle of 1066. It, more than the first two, should have been painstakingly accurate. Part Three rated one major rolling of the eyes and one barely suppressed ""Yawp"" from me, though. First, the eye-roll: Edith Swanneck, Harold's Swedish hand-fast wife, had to identify his corpse after the battle ""by certain marks."" The makers apparently tipped their hats to current fashion trends by making those marks tattoos when it's always been pretty well accepted - and far more likely for the combat-tested Harold - that the marks were actually scars from old wounds. As to the ""yawp,"" Harold and William had actually been close friends earlier in life, and there was a great mutual respect between them. Probably as a personally-imposed penance for four of his knights horrifically decapitating and mutilating Harold's body, William allowed his body - and his alone - to be buried on the battlefield. Why, then, does the director show Edith mourning beside a cairn on a beach MILES south of the battle site?
  As I said, for all its flaws, it's a docudrama that I would have gladly shown to my world history class. It's accurate enough to rate as history and certainly entertaining enough to hold students' attention. All in all, I would recommend purchasing this DVD to history lovers, to fans of the Vikings television series, and even to fans of Tolkien who drew most of his imagery and terminology - including Middle Earth - from the Saxons and Norse.",1427760000,41,6134,4.888354186717998

THREE BATTLES OF 1066, INCLUDING THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS WITH WILLIAM THE CONQUEROR, SEEN THROUGH THE EYES OF THE FOOT SOLDIERS AND COMMON PEOPLE - ANGLO-SAXON PERSPECTIVE RATHER THAN NORMAN

***This modest docudrama focuses on events in 1066 which would prove to be huge turning points for Britain, the advancement of the Normans, and signs of decline in the Viking age.  The mention of ""Middle Earth"" may interest some, but the narrator is quoting from Norse poetry or sagas with the word ""Midgard"" (for dramatic effect) during the Viking portion of the dramatization.  So Yes, it's being played up a little and the font on the cover is likely no accident (to my chagrin also), but there is context for inclusion in the title.

THE STORY: In 1066, England suffered not one, but two pivotal invasions.  First the Vikings to the north, then in September the Norman forces of William the Conqueror landed on the far south-eastern coast near Hastings.  This docudrama, with excellent narration by Ian Holm, presents a dramatization of three main battles and runs much like a movie in two episodes.  The story is told through the eyes of common foot soldiers and their perspective is a very central fixture of the dramatization.  We follow fictionalized characters called up as recruits from the real village of Crowhurst in the southeastern region of Sussex.  As the expected Norman invasion fails to materialize during normal fighting months,  the band is called instead to repel a different invasion by Vikings much farther north.  This accounts for two of the three fateful battles mentioned as they meet the forces of Hadrada at Fulford, and at the Battle of Stamford Bridge.  Unfortunately for these farmer soldiers, the Norman landing does ultimately happen and they must make the exhaustive march south again to defend at the famous battle of Hastings (a critical event in the Norman Conquest).

PRODUCTION VALUES:  For those looking for a great historical drama at a cinematic level, it's just a little short of that despite its quality.  The resources are just not that lavish.  HOWEVER, for a modest docudrama employing a few actors and a competent reenactment group, this is really pretty good.  The acting is good overall and the battle scenes as well if compared to other mere dramatizations.  The narration in particular is excellent and the whole thing does flow like a movie.  Just go into it with those expectations and you should be rewarded.  The causal viewer looking only for entertainment might be disappointed.

ACCURACY:  The general events are pretty good and this is a great overview for someone who may know little about this hugely pivotal turning point for Britain.  There are minor inaccuracies that don't kill the worth of the program as a whole.  The armor and costumes are also pretty decent considering we are using a reenactment group and there isn't exactly a Hollywood budget.  There may be little quirks there too, but I will let the armor and clothing historians write their own reviews and critique the minutia.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  Through using common-folk stories, this docudrama attempts to deeply humanize the Anglo-Saxons (who by then called themselves English).  The noblemen hardly appear in this program.  As such, this doesn't have that regal feel of an epic tale some viewers may be seeking.  It's mainly just the common man's plight and his struggle to survive.  I recommend the program within the context I mentioned.",1420848000,58,3708,5.032840722495895

6928827,5,B00RDTTAMK,"This was a interesting live action documentary, that they for no reason tried to tie in the the Lord of the Rings movies.  Narrated by Ian Holm, Bilbo Baggins who adds historical background information about the Battles of 1066, ending with the famous battle of Hastings, when Norman the Conqueror, defeated King Harold II.  Rather than show how the various leaders fought the Battles, we see the action of a few soldiers from a small Anglo -Saxon village.  The main characters in the story are fictionalized, but the story is based on the actions of real people who fought in the Battles.  I enjoy historical movies and documentaries.  This film combines live action depicting their lives and emotions with narration providing detailed information about what is going on.  I found myself identifying with some of the Anglo-Saxons from the village and hopped they would survive the wars.  The Battle of Hastings changed the course of history in England as the Normans took over the country.  During the story we see women weaving a tapestry, which has become famous as the Bayeux Tapestry.
