8176778,5,B000NDDEA2,"Good clean comedy.  There are a wide variety of acts here, some definitely funnier than others.  This collection is worth it just for the original Tim Hawkins set alone, but there are really some other gems in here as well.  Highly recommend!!!",1309132800,4,244,4.761904761904762
8176779,5,B000NDDEA2,"These comedians are very funny and very clean.  It's hard to find comedy that the whole family can watch, but this is an exception.  The best part is that they are just as funny as their foul-mouthed counterparts.",1200787200,7,213,4.578947368421052
