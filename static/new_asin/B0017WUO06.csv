While the extant material doesn't come up to the standard of a highly polished output, the chance to view the Experience with Hendrix, Mitchell and Redding in full control of their powerful visual and musical talents is more than worth the price of admission. Spoiler: as the performance unfolds, watch how the staid audience loosens up!",1525478400,,479,5.075949367088608
