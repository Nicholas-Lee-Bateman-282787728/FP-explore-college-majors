5509710,2,B00ATK01W8,"Based on all the stellar reviews I really got my hopes up for this one, but I can't blame anyone. Everyone's opinions are different and with a steller cast like Leon, Crawford, and Robin Givens I knew I couldn't go wrong...but I was wrong! This might as well had been a play, as a matter of fact a play might have been better. All the scenes take place in one freakin room. The characters walk in and out this room depending on who's turn it is to get their shine and the storyline was just a total drag! My brother sat down to watch it with me because we've seen Crawford do stand up and we love the guy! Even had him as our screensaver for our home computer at one point. And we're familiar with Robin and Leon from better roles they've played in. We were really excited to watch this thinking we were going to get major laughs but the only thing we laughed about was the fact that someone actually had the nerve to write this terrible script and put out there as a movie! After 40 minutes of waiting for a turnaround in the storyline or just anything interesting to happen my brother just got up and left and I shut it off and threw another movie in. Not sure I'll even bother to finish watching it, where I left off the one girl shot her ex's girlfriend in the arm. Even that wasn't funny...Geesh. I don't blame the actors and actresses for this mess. We've seen them do way better, even the guy who plays Cole off Martin. I can't even say the storyline was horrible. Just needs better writing and more locations, changes of clothes, punchlines, stuff that makes real films interesting. Without these elements this ""movie"" was a bust!",1365552000,6,1638,4.356209150326797
5509711,2,B00ATK01W8,The plot was weak and the acting was even weaker.  Unfortunately Mr. Johnson is making movie after movie and rushing through them.,1365465600,,130,4.909090909090909
5509712,5,B00ATK01W8,"The was an excellent movie. It covered alot of information dealing with how to keep a good amn or woman.r It discussed situations dealing with relationship, man and girlfriend interactions, lying, cheating, BFF and low down dirty individuals. I highly recommend this movie and jyou might see your relationship in there ot it might help you someone stay together. I truly enjoyed this movies and watched twice in one weekend. It is worth seeing, it could just open some doors in your relationship that was shut.",1365379200,,510,4.941860465116279
5509713,4,B00ATK01W8,I had to purchase this item because I am a fan of Lavell Crawford. I find him to be hilarious. I gave it a four rating because I thought it was a play rather tnan a movie. But it was still funny with some thought provocating moments.,1365206400,,233,3.978723404255319
5509714,5,B00ATK01W8,I might be a little bias because I enjoy all of Je'Caryous Johnson's works!  Important storyline that he combined with comedy.  All that equals fantastic play!,1364428800,,159,5.076923076923077
5509715,4,B00ATK01W8,Commit to no one until your leftover baggage is gone.  That way way when your blessing comes your will be ready for it.,1364342400,,119,4.173913043478261
5509716,3,B00ATK01W8,"I liked the movie just wished that they could have changed scenes. The characters stay pretty much in the house the entire time and some of the case do not change their outifits even though they say they were at the place for a few days. However the acting and plot was well written. It was kinda funny seeing Robin Givens with a younger man (not to give the movie away), but overall I would recommend people to see the movie. O by the way the guy who used to play Cole in Martin Lawerence show is quite FINE in this movie!! :)",1364256000,,527,4.12621359223301
5509717,2,B00ATK01W8,its ok but they shouldn't have the lady doing nasty moves and call the lord's name..... same on you all.....,1364169600,,108,4.45
5509718,5,B00ATK01W8,"I really enjoyed Marriage Material.  Je'Caryous Johnson is such a talented writer, producer and director.  I am looking forward to see what he does next!",1363219200,,153,5.08
5509719,5,B00ATK01W8,I loved this. Lavell was so funny. I bought it cause of him and I'm so happy I did. Well worth it. It was well written. Can't wait to watch it again. This time with my wife.,1362873600,,173,3.7027027027027026

5509723,3,B00ATK01W8,"The message is the most important thing to take away from this movie.  I wish some of the lines, therefore the writing, could have been better.  There were attempts at punch lines, but did not generate laughter from me.  I liked the overall message, the movie was a little slow, but the three stars is for the message: Be sure of the reasons why or why not you want to marry someone.  Or the fact that you should.",1395792000,,413,4.256410256410256
5509724,1,B00ATK01W8,"No surprises here. Good choice of actors, with the exception of Lavell. His timing was awful and comedy forced. That's the theme all the way through. It's super predictable and fairly cheesy. Blocking is awful! Spoiler alert: A woman shoots another and they walk right past each other in the very next scene and don't say a word. SMH.
Overall, just disappointing, typical urban stage play. He cheats, she's scorned, new man rescues scorned girl. Everyone hugs. The end.",1391558400,,469,4.949367088607595
5509725,4,B00ATK01W8,"It was more like a play.  World I watch it again no. It was not really funning. Mostly, it was about different types of  relationships that occur in a black culture. Relationships between young men and women coming from a man's perspective.",1389830400,,240,4.690476190476191
5509726,1,B00ATK01W8,The movie did not grab me .they could have put more thought to it .I will not recommend this movie to no one,1389139200,,108,3.739130434782609

5509728,5,B00ATK01W8,"Even though there were scenes that were a little boring and slow, for the most part Marriage Material made it's point.  It was a good watch and I really enjoyed it.  Carl Anthony Payne personified how love can truly prevail even in the most difficult situations.  Would recommenend.",1377475200,,282,4.833333333333333
5509729,3,B00ATK01W8,"Interesting title ,actors ..not what I thought it would be ..If I had only ten dollars and it was a toss-up to buy this play or a meal.. I would buy the meal..",1375920000,2,159,3.8484848484848486
5509730,4,B00ATK01W8,Leon was the only reason why I really wanted to see what it was about. He always brings a certain type of sex appeal to any character he portrays on screen. The movie itself was interesting and entertaining.,1375142400,,207,4.473684210526316
5509731,3,B00ATK01W8,It was slow but the message was real. It makes you really think about you and the person you are attracted to and whether or not both of you are marriage material,1374624000,,162,4.09375
5509732,5,B00ATK01W8,It was very funny and everyone did an exceptional job with their parts.  You won't regret buying this play it has a twist to it.,1373241600,,128,4.12
5509733,4,B00ATK01W8,"This movie was good n had a good storyline, the actors was good, Robin n Jazsmin did their thing and Carl Payne n Leon, love their parts, every girl dream is too have two Men fight over them, you as a Woman should know which one you should be with and choose the right one. It ends Great!!",1369785600,,289,4.0
