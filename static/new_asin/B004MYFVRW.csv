8436321,5,B004MYFVRW,"Bernie Lau is the real deal! Former law enforcement officer and Aikijutsu Sensei. I first saw this publication on VHS in the early 1990's. This is not your typical Cracker Jack Black Belt who has a beer gut and weighs 240 lbs when he should weigh 170. Lau has been featured in Black Belt Magazine and is an American martial arts legend. Aikijutsu was the chosen martial art of the Samurai. Because these are timeless techniques taught today as they were in feudal Japan the age of this publication does not degrade its value and relevance. If you are interested in self defense, aikijutsu, aikido, locks, throws, etc., then you will want to own this video publication.

Thanks for reading my review. I hope it was helpful.
