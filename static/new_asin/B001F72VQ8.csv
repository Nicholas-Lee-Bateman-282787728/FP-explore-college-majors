8301085,4,B001F72VQ8,"A good double feature deal. I, Robot, based on the Isaac Asimov story is a serious sci-fi in contrast to the more parody-style sci-fi of Independence Day. Oddly enough, the lead character in I, Robot shows more ""attitude"" than the lead character in comic Independence Day. Will Smith handles both roles well.",1425772800,,308,4.9423076923076925
