IGNORE ANYTHING SCHTOOKUS HAS WRITTEN

 Schtookus (have no doubt this person is under the impression that even their screen name is comedy gold) has written a lengthy review completely degrading of both the film maker(s) as well as any viewers that may have enjoyed the movie. And like most of the negative reviews has written incorrect facts about its origins and/or intentions.
 Within the review Schtookus has attempted to out do Trey Parker in the humor department and shows exactly why he's sitting at his computer trying to be funny while the person he's ripping apart has actual comedic talent. schtookus missed the mark on every attempt yet tries to critique what's funny and what's not, as if he has an understanding of it?? A critic that has to resort to name calling and personal attacks on anyone with a favorable opinion about a movie is really a waste of time, theirs as well as yours. What's the point right?

Tip #1
 Never mind a movies VIEWERS! Their feelings toward the film, whether positive or negative should have no bearing on your own opinion.

Tip #2
 Never criticize the author/director/actor/etc. personally. That's not what ppl are looking for in a movie review. Who cares what you think about them

Tip #3
 Concentrate on the work itself. If you have strong opinions and want to pick apart every detail I suggest doing two minutes of research about the film so you don't spread false information. Which ultimately makes you come off looking like a dolt for doing so.

Tip #3
 Critique as you would want to be critiqued.

 99% of the bad reviews (even some favorable) have no understanding of the films origin, intentions, and apparently how it wasn't an attempt at being a normal ""mainstream"" movie.
 Knowing the timeframe, availability of funding, actors, wardrobe, equipped, etc. should help point you in the general direction this film was aiming for. Thus giving you a clear understanding that this film was never meant to be anything other than a young college kids (first) attempt at making a ridiculous, over the top, campy comedy...with music...silly music...making it a musical?? Okay yes it's a musical, but not your run of the mill musical so don't tune out just yet. If you can still find it streaming for free what do you have to lose. If it's not your cup of tea just turn it off. Simple. No name calling required, just shut it off.

I find that I need to have the extra features that come with DVDs and BluRays, and boy howdy does this movie come with special features. As for the movie it self? Weeeeeell you have to remember that this is TROMA, the industry leader in indy B cinema. This is also the first feature length film Matt Stone and Trey Parker ever made; literally, they made this while in college. Regardless though, you can still see some of the beginnings of there mad genius on display here as well as there ability to make catchy ear worms that would help them conquer Broadway with ""The Book of Mormon."" The special features are a real but give me mixed feelings. The main reason for this is that a lot of the special features from the old DVD do not make it onto this one, with the exception of the infamous Drunken Director's Commentary. On the one hand I liked it because it meant my original copy of Cannibal! still had worth in my collection, but that also means that this is not what you would call the ""definitive"" edition of Cannibal! That being said I still love this movie and this DVD and have zero regrets to my purchase. If your a fan of TROMA, or any of Matt and Trey's other works (South Park, Orgazmo, Book of Mormon, etc.) or if your just a fan of low budget cinema that has a lot of heart to it, I would highly recommend you pick up this film.

If you stumbled across it, it might not be your cup of tea. This movie is from the creators of ""South Park"". Honestly the humor in South Park has a broader appeal than the humor in this movie, and South Park is considered to be only for a select few itself. By no means am I saying that it isn't funny.

This movie is a must buy IF you are one of the following:
You love Troma movies
You loved Baseketball
You are a die-hard South Park fan and must own everything they make
You appreciate watching no-budget movies and the art of making something with nothing

This musical is done in the style of ""OKLAHOMA!"", as a story of cannibalism should be told.  It starts a little slow, but the musical numbers alone are worth watching the film in its entirety.

1077388,4,630576350X,"Created long before they dropped the world of ""South Park"" on the universe, this is the first work by the satirical geniuses, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. Steeped in the traditions of using toilet humor and music, which they have come to make famous, they tackle the true story of one of the most harrowing and gruesome events in American history.

While the subject matter would seem ill-advised for comedic trope, they manage to make it funny with the many outlandish and ludicrous situations and songs to keep this parody palatable. The song ""Let's Build A Snowman"" is one that will quickly get stuck into your brain and you'll be singing along with, before you know it.

The opening scene is quite bloody and macabre, which will serve to remind you that this event was no bag of laughs for those who were involved, but the lowbrow and slapstick nature of the humor will keep you laughing throughout the proceedings. Like watching a chef hone their skills, you will get a very good look at the style of humor Parker and Stone would make a staple of their career. It's obvious this film is very near and dear to them, as the opening song, ""It's a Shpdoinkle Day,"" is still played at the end of every episode of ""South Park."" This is a bit more lower budget than some of their later films, like ""Orgazmo"" and ""BASEketball,"" but the true talent of these twisted minds still shines through. The overall transfer of the DVD is pretty good, which is a bit surprising coming from Troma, and is one of the best films from the company's catalog.

If you are a fan of Parker and Stone's other works, then you'll need to have this film in your collection (if you don't already). But even if you only like comedy that isn't ""politically correct,"" then I fully believe you'll enjoy this film and all the ridiculous, off-beat and completely irreverent antics found within.

There are vicious trappers, Japanese Indians, and a bittersweet love story between Alfred Packer and Lianne. And in true musical fashion, the characters have a tendency to burst into song.

As you might guess from the presence of Parker & Stone, Cannibal the Musical is hysterically funny and cheerfully disgusting. Add several weird and catchy songs, and it's impossible to resist. Truly, it's a shpedoinkal movie.",1227139200,,676,5.25

The plot is quite daringly clever as it keeps you attached to the magnificent dialogue and jokes betwixt feverishly addicting musical scenes.  The romance in the film is also heart-felt, forcing tears to slide down the cheeks of anyone who watches the scene where Alfred Packer professes his recently departed love, whilst reminiscing wonderful memories of joint happiness together.

If you're willing to join Trey Parker in this ""Whoa-It's-Like-I'm-Actually-Venturing-Along-With-Alfred-Packer"" kind of film, then put on your ""I H8 Trapperz"" shirt and hop along for the ride.

Kabuki Man' and 'The Toxic Avenger', which were good.  I also saw some duds, like 'Surf Nazi's Must Die' and 'The Stendhal Syndrome', the later of which I wish I could get that two hours of my life back.

So what differs between the past version and the recently released 13th Anniversary Edition?

For one there are never before seen deleted scenes that are so funny and twisted that they should have kept them in the movie. At least now we get to take part of them as well.
There is also a new commentary track that involves some of the other people involved in the production and you get to hear their take on things. I can only say one thing; the production of it seems to be as interesting as the movie.
But the real treasure is the 1 hour of interviews that has been located and shares with us. Here you get to hear what everyone thinks of the movie and Trey Parker and Matt Stone. And its not all good things haha
Other features include new production stills and many things more.

There's gore and gay songs and humor along the way.  The sick side of Troma actually seems toned down quite a bit though, this is no BloodSucking Freaks.

The film shows the excellent effort of a few budding young filmakers as they spend their spring break creating a movie that follows a hypothetical plotline based around the very real Alfred Packer, the only person in American ever convicted of Cannabalism.  The movie itself is entertaining, and contains some creative songs.  The real gem of this video, however, comes in the director's commentary.  The creators and a few of the other costarring actors decided to watch the movie, drink heavily, and just say whatever came to mind.  The results are a hilarious track that I agree should be nominated for ""Best Director's Track Ever!""!!

One day they come to class telling me about this bizarre sounding movie, and I was crying from laughing so hard just from them telling me about it. I knew I had to see it. A friend and I rented it and we have never laughed so hard. This movie literally changed my life. After watching it I knew I wanted to become a filmmaker and I am actually following those dreams. Hopefuly somebody else will be affected the same way I was by this masterpiece. It opens up with this incredibly gory scene of Packer brutally murdering a bunch of men. And it is hilarious. In this one part Packer rips this guys arm off and beats him with it while saying ""Jeepers... Jeepers"". I can't beleive how talented of a filmmaker Trey Parker is. He is the best writer, Director, actor etc. in movie making today. There is nothing that he can't do. No one can come close to Trey.

The songs in this movie are even better than the songs in South Park:Bigger... The trapper song is definitley the best. The fur trapper Frenchy is singing what it is like to be trapper ""My pa was an elaphant but thats irrelevant, my ma was an eskimo."" Trey Parker dubs over his voice so it is actually Trey who is singing and the lyrics are so funny you will crying from laughing so hard. That's All I Really Want is a super funny song too. Same with Shpadoinkal ""The sky is blue and all the leaves are green. My heart's as full as baked potato. I think you know precisley what I mean when I say it's a shpadoinkal day. As I ride with my girl, she's my best friend in the whole world..."" Lets Build a Snow Man is hilarious. If you look closely in one scene the snow mans head changes to an aliens head.

Trey Parker and Matt Stone (South Park, Orgazmo) made this independant film when they were in college.

The story begins in Utah when a group of miners realize that there is more gold to gain in Colorado. They get Packer to be their guide and they head off. Along the way they run into Trappers, Japanese Indians, and Packer loses the one thing that means the most to him, his horse Lianne.

1077614,1,630576350X,"I must say that I am very open to new film, bold styles of filmmaking, and the opportunity to see the obscure, but I am not open to a lack of excitement.  I thought that this was an interesting first film for Trey Parker to create while in film school, but I think the hype behind this movie and one of the reasons that it is referred to as a ""cult"" film is because of the South Park fame that has subsequently followed this team.  Personally, I didn't see the value in this picture at all.  The actors seemed unexcited to be in the picture, the story seemed flimsy at best, and the songs had the feeling of third-gradery to them.  Don't get me wrong, I am always excited about seeing student films and how powerful a fresh mind can be, but in this film I just felt that Parker was trying to press certain buttons, but failed miserably.  His comedy was not funny, his scenes of gore can be credited towards Troma, and the references to South Park continued to boost my impression that this film became popular after their South Park inheritance.  Parker had no control over this film, no control over his actors, and most importantly, no control over himself.  It is difficult for me to watch a film where the main character is only giving 15% at best.

Again, I would like to stress that I am not against this type of filmmaking ... when it is done right.  In the case of Cannibal! The Musical I didn't feel that there were any elements that stood out, seemed creative, or were original.  Parker seemed to be going for the shock value more than creating a decent piece of cinema.  To begin, the characters were all one-dimensional.  I cared nothing for the band of men stuck in the Colorado area without any food.  If they died or if they survived, I could have cared less.  I didn't know them, I didn't get to know them, and Parker wasn't allowing me to see them as three-dimensional people, so my sympathy towards them further plummeted this film.  Everyone in this film was silly and stupid instead of funny and independent.  I went into this film wanting to see a sharp, independent film that would surprise me and make me laugh.  The characters of this film brought that concept to a complete halt.  Packer was the worst, providing no emotion at all to his character and simply whispering all of his words.  It was pathetic and a very sad sight to see.  Then, as if the other actors were following suit, they brought nothing emotional or comedic to the table, but instead went through their lines and did the bare minimum that they had to.  I would have to say that the failure of this film began with the actors poorly giving us any decent characters.

Another failed element was the story, which seemed to jump around all over the place like a scratched CD.  The film technique of making us believe that this was a ""true"" story by using pseudo-documentary moments just hurt this film more than helping it.  It made the overall production seem cheap and uninformative.  There was no consistency or excitement to get from one scene to the next, and I think a reason for this was the poor choice of songs.  This was to be a musical, and I have seen Matt and Trey write songs (see South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut) that were both humorous and powerful, but in this film, they just felt like eight year olds created them.  You could tell that they were dubbed over and that some of the actors didn't even know all the lines to the songs.  These are elements that need to be addressed during production because it could either make or break a film ... and in this case it broke it.  The only song that I found myself breaking a smile was the ""Let's Build a Snowman!"" ditty that at least showcased some originality.  Outside of that, I don't believe that I broke a smile once during this film, and this was to be a comedy?

Finally, I would like to say that you can not create a film with the idea that it will become a ""cult"" film over time.  I could see this pompous nature in Parker as he was creating this film.  During his performance as Packer, you could see that glimmer in his eye that screamed, ""This will be bigger than we imagined because smart people that love South Park will love this later in life.""  It nearly made me wretch.  These actors knew what they were doing, and I think Troma did as well, since all are now cashing in on this film since the popularity of South Park.  There just seemed to be this aura of arrogance while I watched the film that hampered my enjoyment.

Overall, I was very unimpressed.  I was expecting bigger, bolder, and much more creativity behind this feature than what was presented.  As I watch what these boys can create now, I cannot help but think that they have a much smarter head on their shoulders than Cannibal! The Musical presented.  This could have been a very lucrative and intelligent film, but instead they seemed to make it just a cheap production with a catchy name and simplistic songs.  I do not recommend this film, unless you are in desperate need of more sleep at night and desire to see the boys of South Park finally fail!

It contains alot of Parker's trademark touches that informed his later work in ""South Park"" and ""Team America"" such as it's outrageous humor and goofy songs.  The film is conventional in some ways in relaying the story of Alfred Packer and his doomed expedition into the Colorado Territories in the late 19th century and at heart there is a certain innocence in this endeavor.  It's definitely a low-budget affair but it is compensated with the high spirited stylings of Parker's direction.  Those turned off by the film's title fear not.

It's quite disgusting at times with blood and gore, it contains nudity (on the bonus features) and a fair bit of bad langauge... and thats why I love it.

Trey has not made any kind of acadamey award winning movie with this, but it's a Tromo film, there never meant to be... some silly acting here and there, goofyness and weird bits now and then, and all around comedy of a group of a man who is the last survivor of an ill-fated trip to the Colorado Territoy, he tells his story of what really happend when he is convicted of cannibalism! Also, don't forget, it's a musical, sort of.

The DVD is also completly packed with extras, it has a South Park kind of feel to the animations of the menus's. There is also 2 intro's, the original and a newer one from Troma head Andy Kauffman, there not really worth looking at again.... there is a few interviews about the film with Trey Parker and Matt

Stone, theres some didgey behind the scenes footage, there is a silly game from Troma to test your knowledge on there films, if you get the question right, you get to see a short clip of some racks.. but if you get it wrong, you get a clip of blood and gore and people being crushed in bad ways... all clips from different Troma films... theres a few trailers, not just ones for CTM either... there is a tour of Troma, you can select a room to veiw and go on a joke tour of Troma headquarters... there is a public service announcement, which is a scene from a more recent film Trey and Matt did with Troma.. and there is also a commentary, which doesnt give you much insight into the film, it mostly contains Trey, Matt, Jason Hughs, Dian Bucher, Andy Klemer making fun of there film and each other, and Matt Stone farting into the mic every few minutes as they all get drunk.

It's a great DVD package from Troma, well worth the money you pay for it, excellent presentation in its digitaly remastered format, the only 2 things i have a pet peeve about is it doesnt have any deleted scenes, or Subtitles... but it's still a great package!

Remember tho, this movie is rated R, it's not a kids or fammily movie, it's not for anyone who wants to see some great acting, it's basicly.....well, it's like a real time version of South Park, with the same over the top antics... so sit back, leave your IQ at the door, and enjoy the film!

1077619,4,630576350X,"If you have never sat all the way through a Troma film or have never found anything about ""South Park"" to be funny, then do not bother to watch ""Cannibal! The Musical,"" because you are not going to enjoy it.  Matt Stone is around in 1993 when this film was made (but not released to mass consumption until 1996), but Trey Parker gets the primary credit for not only writing the script and songs, but also directing and starring as Alfred Packer (and the Cow Bell Guy).

In 1873 Packer and five prospectors were snowbound, lost and hungry in the San Juans of Colorado.  Only Packer returned alive and when the other bodies were discovered it was clear they had been eaten.  Parker was eventually convicted of murder and not cannibalism, although Colorado lore likes to claim he was ""the only man in U.S. history ever convicted of cannibalism.""  At the University of Colorado at the grill at the Student Union is named the Alferd Packer Grill (the spelling of Packer's first name is but one of several points of dispute in the story).

Parker and Stone were students at Colorado and so it is not surprising that Parker would turn Packer story into a musical.  The film was originally entitled ""Alfred Packer: The Musical"", but Troma's owner Lloyd Kaufman argued for the name change because while Packer is a legendary figure in Colorado, his cannibalistic claim of fame is little known outside of the state.

Actually, there is not as much cannibalism as you would think in this movie, and there are certainly enough songs.  The latter is the bigger complaint, because the songs are the best part of the film and the funniest parts as well.  The humor outside of the songs is just not that ambitious: the best bits are the Nihonjin ""Indians"" being played by Japanese (with ""Nihonjin"" being Japanese for ""Japanese"") and the debate as to whether ""The Trapper Song"" was in F sharp major or E flat minor (as the relative major of F sharp with the relative minor being three half-tones down).  And if you do not know that the lead characer is going to be offered fudge at some point, you have just not been thinking ahead.  The good news is that when you get to the ""Finger Food"" extras you can go back and do the songs, not only as they appear in the film but also as performed in a live version of ""Cannibal! The Musical"" by the Dad's Garage Theater Copany.

As he proved in ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut,"" Parker can master the nuances of the musical forms identified with both Broadway and popular song.  It is hard not to think of Curly opening ""Oklahoma"" when Parker as Packer shows up and starts singing:

The sky is blue and all the leaves are green.
The sun's as warm as a baked potato.
I think I know precisely what I mean,
When I say it's a shpadoinkle day.

My favorite song has to be ""Ode to Liane"" (a.k.a. ""When I Was on Top of You""), which Packer ostensibly sings to his horse, but which Parker apparently wrote to revenge himself on an ex-girlfriend who obviously did not know what sort of person she had dumped (she also contributes to her own demise by doing the choreography for the big finale and dancing in it as well).  I also like ""This Side of Me,"" sung by reporter Polly Pry (Toddy Walters), which is a sweet little song about a woman's forgotten side, until one little line in the final chorus skews it a wee bit.  The ""Trapper Song"" and the big finale, ""Hang the Bastard!"" are the big productive numbers, relatively speaking.  It really is much more of a Cowboy musical than a cannibal music (notice the lowercase ""c"" for ""cannibal"") and once you understand that you can stop closing your eyes in anticipation of the eating of human flesh.

As you would expect the DVD is loaded with extras that exaggerate the importance of this film, including Parker, Stone and several other cast members who gather together to get drunk while watching the movie.  But if you can take a three-minute trailer as a joke for film class and then raise enough money to actually make a movie that gets sold to Troma, home of ""The Toxic Avenger,"" that is your basic American success story.  It was because of this movie that Parker and Stone were able to go to Hollywood and eventually end up doing be ""South Park"" and thereby corrupting a much larger segment of America's youth than are ever going to stumble on this movie.  Finally, if you are looking for some sort of profound and deep meaning to all of this, I would refer you to the lyrics of ""Let's Build a Snowman! Part I,"" which evince a sense of relativism that usually found in the current post-modernism tradition:

Sometimes, the world is black.
And tears run from your eyes.
And maybe we'll all get really sick.
And maybe we'll all die.
So...

Let's build a snowman!
We can make him our best friend.
We can name him Tom or we can name him George!

He goes on a journey for gold with a couple other guys (South Park co-creator Matt Stone is one of them) and they get lost. Lots of stupid stuff happens especially how the one dude started going crazy and tried building snow men. There's a good amount of gore too to make the movie even more hilarious.

The funny thing about this film is it also relfects on Trey Parker's real life. In the movie, his horse, Leanne, that he loved so much, leaves him.

If you aren't careful, the songs are catchy enough to stay in your head for days.  (Just try getting the ""Trappers' Song"" out of your mind once you've heard it!)  The characters tend to start singing for no apparent reason, and most of the songs have a cheerful musical feel... despite their somewhat morbid or offbeat lyrics!  In one scene, a recently-dead character even threatens to sing while his companions contemplate whether or not to eat him!  There is choreography, in this case executed in a painfully amateurish (yet charming) manner...  the ""tap dance"" in ""Let's Build a Snowman"" is not to be missed!
The acting and production has a ""gee-whiz"" feel, and it is very apparent that this movie was lots of fun to make. The costumes and effects, including the fake beards, fake blood/organs and fake frostbite, are hilarious.  So is the fake gore in the opening sequence...  simply wonderful stuff!  The color on the DVD is atrocious, looking like the treatment from a 1950's color western.  Through all this, it becomes apparent that Parker has an obvious love of films and of film history, as this movie satirizes many conventions of American musicals made 40-50 years ago.
While I enjoyed Parker's role as the lead character Alferd Packer, I think Matt Stone and Dian Bachar also turn in fine performances in this film.  For those of you who have seen ""Baseketball"" and loved Bachar's role in that movie, he also shines in ""Cannibal!"".  He has a lesser role here, but his talents are used to great advantage.  Stone's role here (as a near-total doofus), is delightfully over-the-top at times...
Trey Parker seems to show a certain amount of comic genius in most things he does.  This movie is no exception.  There is a lot more to Parker than ""South Park"", and if you love his smart-ass sense of the absurd, you will love ""Cannibal! The Musical""!",1077321600,,2498,4.711981566820277
1077739,5,630576350X,"I will admit up front that my opinion of this movie may be jaded by the fact that I am a Coloradoan, the very territory where Alferd Packer forged his infamous reputation in the high country above Lake City; but this is one of the most treasured DVDs in my entire collection.
Trey Parker, Matt Stone, Dian Bachar and a team of truly strange individuals put this film together with marvelous original tunes written by Trey Parker. It is both a comedic and musical treat that always produces gales of laughter when I play it for folks who have never seen it before.
The writers have fairly faithfully presented the story of Alferd Packer as he claimed things happened when he took 5 miners into the mountains and became snowbound during a powerful winter storm. Packer returned as the sole survivor. Further investigation of the remains of his companions indicated they had been gnawed on... By a human!
Parker and Stone collaborated on producing this film without much of a budget, while still attending film school at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Many of the locations used in the film were around Boulder. Notable exceptions were the actual court house in Lake City where Packer was tried for cannibalism.
The final scene, which has a wonderful song: ""Hang the Bastard"", was shot in Buckskin Joe, a restored ghost town created by fetching buildings from ghost towns around Colorado and relocating them to a location just south of Canon City. Nearly 100 folks took part in the final number, many of whom were university students willing to work for a song, if you'll pardon the pun.
This movie is like South Park, but with more bite. It is truly a movie one can sink their teeth into, and satisfy their hunger for campy comedy and hysterical songs scattered throughout the film.
I give this film only 5 stars, because that's all they allow! I'd actually rank it a 10, and regard it as great as Dr. Strangelove, but different.

The way some nerds feel about Star Trek, I feel about Cannibal The Musical. Trey always adds subliminal things into his work. And they are evident, with the constant alien sightings.
This is the incredible fact-based story of Alfred Packer (The first man convicted of Cannibalism). It is the story from Packer's point of view, but Trey added in some great stuff from his own life. Liane (also Cartman's mom on SP's name) is the horse, and the story of the horse running off was an interpretation of Trey's fiance Liane leaving him.
I could go on forever about his movie but, I won't. I'll let you view it for yourself. To view this movie and enjoy it, you must not take it too seriously. Look at it for what it is, a bunch of college kids trying to get their movie out there. But then view it again to look at how genius this film really is.

With only...[a small amount of money]and a few buckets of blood, the young bucks made this insanely funny and digusting film.

The scenery and the script are suprisingly accurate, in fact it's almost historical.  The movie acts also as a sarcastic look at musical theatre and massacres the stereotypes by borrowing them in order to place them in an ever increasingly ludicrous setting.  The songs are actually quite good and almost irritatingly catchy.  The opening song (spidoinkle day) is a laughing response to ""O' What a Bueatiful Morning"" from ""Oklahoma"" and you have a chance to witness the comic genuis that led to Southpark in a virgin unabashed stage.  The movie has moments when it is actually charming, though those moments soon devolve into barbed humor.  Several scenes are obsessed with the process of musical writing or film-making.  With these scenes it takes a swing at the ever-increasing masturbatory entertainment industry.  If you are a western historian, or just a Troma freak who has seen ""Meet the Feebles"" or ""Tromeo and Juliet"" than this film should be on a list of movies to see.
Pitfalls include a cast of actors who cheese up truly funny material, and struggle with holding a tune.  The live stage version claims some time on the DVD version and is well worth the intrigued viewers time as the performers are more talented than the movie actors, which brings the point that this muscial should be brought to the live stage at a professional level.

Admittedly, it's not a professional production in any way, shape, or form, although Parker's energy level and willingness to play with the obvious anachronisms make the amateur production values part of the gag.  Parker seems more comfortable with animation than live action (behold the ""South Park"" movie), but he does a decent job here.
Where this movie really stands out is the sound; the DVD has Parker's approved sound mix and he crams it with gags.  You have to pay close attention with ears and eyes to catch everything (which you won't, at least not the first time around), for which Parker deserves kudos.
There are only two parts of the DVD that bug me; one, the extras have more to do with Troma than with Cannibal, although we do get clips from the Cannibal stage show and an audio commentary that's a riot, and the Troma Intelligence Test is pretty amusing.  Two, if you've seen the movie on Cinemax or before Parker and Stone took off, then you know there's a short deleted sequence, the ""Don't Be Stupid"" song.  It's been axed from this print of the movie, and it's nowhere to be found on the disc.  This is annoying and if there's an explanation for this unnecessary edit, I haven't found it.

Now, I have read several of the reviews which were written for this movie, and I'v heard the complaints, but here's what I have to say:
This movie is unique.  This movie is the kind of movie(s) which is dying out now.
First off, it is a musical.  This genre, whose sole supporter for the last few years (Disney) has almost completely left, is one which I in particular treasure.  Sure, it's goofy to imagine that someone could suddenly burst into song in the middle of their heartache (or their triumph, or when describing what it's like to be a trapper :), but musicals speak to something within us, making the world just unreal enough to love.  It's unique in the movie business in that it's surreal ways can increase the closeness someone has with a movie by being engrossed by the songs.
Secondly, it's an Indie...a GOOD indie.  A COMEDY/SLAPSTICK indie.  And while there are no lack of sophmoric comedies availble, no one does it with such gusto, imagination, or daring as Trey Parker.  The last indie with such imagination and zest that I'd seen was from Sam Raimi and Kevin Smith...and look at them.
This film is unique.  It's subtle in alot of ways, with alot of points to make which can been seen in more then one viewing only.  True, sometimes there are periods without specific jokes, but if you watch the movie, you realize that the whole damned thing is one big joke.
Plus, the music is simply amazing in it's fun and catchiness.
In short, movies like this and Orgazmo (another of my favorites which has it's own brand of humor and much of the same cast) are gems to be treasured.  They shouldn't be thrown out because they were made by two young college guys without any experience...
Or two young guys with a well known TV show that many people have preconceptions about...
To be honest, if Mel Brooks or another veteran had decided to undertake on this project, they probably wouldv've been applauded.  So I applaud Trey Parker (this was truly his baby is you read the credits) for his genius, ingenuity, bravery, and wonderful singing voice.

1077856,5,630576350X,"People put it down for it's ""numerous fart jokes"" (which is greatly exagerrated), ""crass humor"", and ""horrible"" acting. What they don't realize is that the horrible acting is the joke. It's the 90's version of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's making fun of every bad musical ever made, just like Rocky Horror was a parody of ever single b-movie ever made. And in true Rocky style, they made it so bad that it was comical.
The style is of a movie that is trying to be serious but desperately fails (you know the type I'm talking about.) Everyone knows that the ""facts"" about the movie are false, that Packer really was guilty, but that's part of the joke. A perfect example is how in the beginning, the prosecuting attorney was telling how Alfred Packer brutally killed and ate his fellow travelers. Packer looks at the camera and says ""But that's not the way it happened."" It's satirizing the movies that are ""based on a true story"" that really just make the entire thing up. The songs, while catchy, are purposely cheesy as hell (my heart's as full as a baked potato!) and much to spontanious (let's build a snowman!) to satirize the woefully inept musicals out there. The plot is extremely cliched. And many don't get the fact that the acting is supposed to be bad and exagerrated to parody how badly many actors over acted in the western's in the 50's. But through it all, it's the home to one of the best movie lines of all time- ""Shpadoinkle!""
I guess there's a reason it's a called a cult classic. To the untrained eye, the jokes are too spread apart (although extremely hilarious.) To the rest, the entire movie is a joke. So I say that if you're a Rocky Horror Picture Show fan like me, or if you just enjoy sublte parody, then you should buy this movie. If you like joke-a-minute movies, the skip over it. But please don't put it down only because it was made by the creators of South Park, appreciate it for what it is-a genius piece of satire.",999648000,6,1957,4.484593837535014

1077858,4,630576350X,"It's darn amazing what you'll find at the local rental store.  For instance, I recently couldn't find a copy of ""State and Main"" (or, for that matter, ""Rocky""), but unbelievably, there was ""Cannibal! The Musical"" sitting right there in the comedy section.  My best friend and I were in a warped mood, so we picked it up without a moment of hesitation.
With tongue planted firmly in cheek, a young and peculiarly gaunt Trey Parker (or Juan Schwartz, if you prefer) undertakes the task of recreating cult historical figure Alferd Packer -- the dude who was convicted of cannibalism sometime in the mid-1800s-ish -- with the assistance of a college-aged cast and crew and a nonexistent budget.
While the comedy loses steam when it should be reaching its apex, as many comedies are won't to do, the humor is nonetheless fresh, alternating between whimsy and bite.  The gore scenes weren't my favorite, as I am a squeamish girly-girl equipped with a quirky sense of humor but a low tolerance for gross-out jokes.  I was, however, amused with the anachronistic tendencies (one character would call someone a ""Gosh-darned so-and-so!"" while another would out-and-out call someone an a--hole).  And, in an unrelated thought: as I'm sure you've already heard in everybody else's reviews, there is an excellent song called ""Let's Build a Snowman!"" Joy in the face of adversity, that's what musical theater is all about.
The movie (which looks exactly like what it is -- a college production) smartly mocks the genre of musical theater.  Yet it simultaneously, and paradoxically, embodies the doe-eyed enthusiasm and naivet it supposedly resents, in a way only a rebellious-but-hopeful young cast, in the purgatory between youth and adulthood, could possibly bring to fruition.
Hey! There's also a fantabulous cowbell solo, which made me long for my Special Lad (who is a drummer of occasionally questionable talent).  Shpadoinkle.",995760000,,1919,5.131410256410256

Along the way, the group becomes lost and cold and hungry...and soon they resort to eating each other in order to stay alive, and they also sing some catchy songs along the way before tearing each other apart!

1077861,3,630576350X,"Trey Parker has made a name for himself (at least in my eyes) as a remarkable triple-threat auteur, who's various strengths are shown to varying degrees in this comical odyssey.
Parker's strength as an actor is twofold.  First, he has a look of innocence about him, which is a wonder because it conceals a hyper-healthy subversive streak.  He has these mopey wide eyes that may as well be sparkling, a goofy kid grin, and a perfect gee-whiz-aww-shucks quality to the way he speaks.  Second, he manages to inject complete sincerity into the most ridiculous scenes (especially when he's singing) without a trace of irony.  He understands his own material well enough to know that if he exaggerated his actions the humour would deflate.  Co-star (and ""Orgazmo"" vet) Dian Bachar acquits himself equally well in this way, as a young man anxious for gold and woman (though not necessarily in that order).  Contrast this with his partner Matt Stone's over-the-top acting style.  Stone gets a lot of great lines here, but his lispy speech and contorted facial expressions nearly ruin the gags.  Parker never falls into that trap.
Parker the director tries his best to spread his wings, but is hampered by his film's measly budget.  He has a tough time overcoming the cheap sound, cinematography and special effects he's saddled with.  Sam Raimi, in similar circumstances with his ""Evil Dead"" movies, managed to create gloriously fun moments with his supreme inventiveness in editing.  Parker tries his best, and nearly succeeds at times, but can't fully achieve his cinematic vision.
Which is fine, because he does achieve massive success with his songs.  And this being a musical, I suppose that the songs are key.  Anyone who enjoyed his surreal odes to a certain ""mountain town"" in ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut"" will surely get a kick out of the tunes Trey's come up with here.  Peppy opener ""It's a Shpadoinkle Day"" sets the stage (""the sun is hot like a baked potatoe!""), followed by ""When I Was On Top of You"" (a double-entendred filled paean to, you guessed it... his horse!), and ""Let's Build a Snowman"" (which rightfully entails execution to anyone who sings it).  The final, showstopping number, ""Hang the Bastard"", even features some nifty choreography and a rockin' cowbell solo!  The remaining songs, while sometimes hampered by poor sound and unintelligible lyrics (""The Trapper Song"" being the cruelest victim), are comic masterpieces.  Parker deserves additional credit for co-writing the score, which is uproariously cheesy but perfect for the film.
The jokes here aren't as fast and furious as I expected, which makes them tougher to spot when they do come along.  Some of my favourites include: the expedition's Mormon contingency repeatedly threatening to send a particular rowdy member to ""take a time out""; a group of ruffian trappers who have their gang name (it's ""Trappers"", natch) sewn on to the back of their pelt jackets; and Parker's incredulous reaction to the old villain-who-won't-die-even-when-a-pick-axe-is-buried-in-his-chest routine.  And there are some silly surreal moments to cherish as well, such as a band of Japanese ninjas disguising themselves as Indians, an absurd ballet dream sequence, and a hilariously heated discussion of musical theory between the trappers and the expedition.  The sheer inventiveness of the whole enterprise makes one wonder what Parker and Co. could have done with a respectable budget and a top notch cast.  Since we'll never know, why not enjoy ""Cannibal: The Musical"" in all its campy glory?",991267200,5,3566,5.134948096885813

1077863,3,630576350X,"This movie received its fair share of bad reviews, and much of the criticism centered on the quality of the cinematography and sound.  Keeping in mind that this was Trey Parker's first picture and had a very limited budget, I must say that I believe those criticisms are for the most part exaggerated.  In fact, I think this film is much better than anyone had a right to expect under the circumstances.
""Cannibal! the Musical"" is the story of the ill-fated journey of Alfred Packer and his party from Utah to Breckenridge Colorado when they became stranded and without food resorted to cannibalism, with Packer being the lone survivor.  Parker plays the title role and the usual suspects-Matt Stone and Dian Bachar-play members of the ill-fated party.  Those who have seen ""Orgazmo"" may recognize the oriental actor who played ""G-Fresh"" in that picture in the role of an Indian chief here.  The acting is good, but you won't see any Oscar worthy performances here.  I found the movie to be quite entertaining although somewhat uneven and not quite as funny as ""Orgazmo"" or ""Baseketball"".  The musical numbers are all very good and have very clever lyrics (a strong suit of Parker's).  You'll be singing them to yourself for days afterward.
Overall, I think Parker acquits himself well in ""Cannibal! The Musical"".  Check out the credits at the end of the film and you'll realize that this was Trey's baby from beginning to end.  If you're not squeamish or a prude this motion picture is worth a look.",985305600,,1500,4.801556420233463

1077934,4,630576350X,"While many will be turned off by the film-school budget and cheap video appearance of this film, I must first say that for being an extremely low budget film, it is a marvel.  However, if I were to look at it from a Hollywood stance, it is pure schlock.  I don't look at things like Hollywood does, so this film still stands tall with me.  Cannibal! The Musical is a delightful farce of the horror and musical genre that began as a trailer for a film class and erupted into a full length cheese fest.  The acting is atrocious, but everyone knows they suck so it really doesn't matter because they're having such fun.  The story centralizes around Alfred Packard, the only man to ever be convicted of cannibalism in the United States.  After getting a party lost in the wildnerness while on the way to Colorado, Packard decides to get them even more lost by following the trail of his lost horse, Leann.
While this summary is the plot of the story, it really doesn't matter, because when you either purchase or rent a movie named Cannibal! The Musical, it's my guess that you're not looking for twists and plot development.  You're looking for stupidity, and that is what you get.  The songs are quite well written and funny and can even rival some of the songs written by the terrific Rogers and Hammerstein.  Like I have said previously, the acting is horrible, but you expect that.  The sets and costumes are even worse (wait until you see the TP's!).
Like I have said in the previous paragraphs, this film was not intended to be an award winner at all.  It's nothing but good solid fun with a delightful story, funny characters, and a great musical score.  If you're looking for great campy fun with a little bit of gore and violence mixed in, then Cannibal! The Musical should fit you nicely.",981331200,,1796,4.526315789473684
1077935,1,630576350X,"While I can understand true Matt Stone and Trey Parker fans drooling and blustering over this silly amateurish movie-musical, I can't see any reason why somebody this side of the Betty Ford Lobotomy Clinic would find it any more than an amateurish albeit remotely entertaining piece of student film exploitation.  The point of this exercise is pure capitalism. You have a neat little piece of cheap cinema you put together with your friend and $25,000 after quitting college. Now, after perfecting your style and humor, you've become famous for something completely peripheral (South Park). How can you cash in on your fame even more? Why, tap into your already existing fanbase with that piece of crap you have in your closet from your college years!  Fans of the show will eat this up like Marlon Brando at a twinkie factory simply because it has their favorite fart-joke duo at the helm. They will give it exaggerated praise filtered through their idolizing lemming brains, adoring it for the very reasons Parker and Stone lambast in their brilliant ""South Park"" movie. They will love this movie not because the film was good, but because it was made by the rebels they have come to adore.  My point is this. The lavish praise in all of these ""reviews"" isn't based on anything but a kneejerk reaction to enjoying the work they have already seen of Matt and Trey's. I don't want to pee on anybody's ""golden goat"", but this movie stunk. Stunk like 3-week old deep-fried hamster testicles dipped in fermelnahide. Stunk like a sweaty jock strap tied covered in cheese whiz and dipped into a septic tank. It was bad.  But that's not necessarily bad! It was so bad, it was good. Do you see my point? I don't know if most South Park fans have a even a vague notion of what this concept is, or even the name for it. Well, I'll tell you. it's called ""camp"". No, not summer ""camp"" at Lake Humpaneighber. What I'm talking about is ""camp"" as in ""banality, mediocrity, artifice, so extreme as to amuse or have a perversely sophisticated appeal"" (Websters dictionary). Another word that might be properly suited for this movie is ""kitsch"". No, not the tasty pastry with all those yummy fillings. That's ""quiche"". ""Kitsch is art, writing, or in this case a movie ""of a pretentious but shallow kind, calculated to have popular appeal."" I think much of ""Cannibal"" is chock full of ""camp"" and ""kitsch"". I think Matt and Trey knew this while making it.  And that's the problem. Movie making that is overtly self-conscious is simply not good movie making. It's as if throughout the movie, to compensate for a lack of talent, acting ability, directing experience, and even general cinematic know-how, Trey went out of his way to bring attention to the lack of budget, experience, or any artful means. That added a klunky kind of energy to the campiness of the film, but it didn't compensate for the lack of all the previous. I have seen student films made on a similarly tight budget that were infinitely funnier, and could be considered good films alongside mainstream movies.  Because Stone and Parker have a large juvenile following, this obviously juvenile film will get undo attention. Also, while I'm sure the DVD commentary is rightly hilarious (especially if they get drunk), one comment below is telling. A viewer remarked on how this audio commentary had him laughing harder than the movie. This is sad. It means that a bunch of guys sitting around a table drinking beer can be funnier than this film. It means that Stone and Parker were funnier 'on their own' than this movie was in its entirety.  I don't care if Trey Parker becomes Sultan of the Sudan. It won't change the fact that this movie would be rotting in obscurity and rightly be considered a piece of radioactive sludge if South Park hadn't taken off. It's not even the South Park style of thinly veiled social satire laced with expletives and fart jokes (which I personally love!). It shows that Trey's ideas were a work in progress, and he needed to move on and hone his humor and song writing skills (which he did with his South Park movie and the considerable help of Marc Shaiman).  Fame does interesting things to people's concepts of quality. A painting of a waterfall that a collector would burn if they found in their cheap motel room suddenly is worth 10,000 dollars to him because it was drawn by Paul McCartney. That doesn't make it a quality piece of work. That makes it a piece of crap drawn by a celebrity. We tend to put an extra price tag on anything done by celebrities, whether it's in the past or present. ""Awww, Mr. McCartney can draw. Kind of. But not well. But who cares? He's Paul McCartney!"" It's like we treat celebrities as little kids. ""Aww, little Timmy drew a picture of a Hippo and wiped a booger on it. let's put it on the fridge! Isn't it perty?""  I don't want to see the dumb home video of ""Lassie: a Tale of Murder"" Trey Parker made when he was 12 with his video camera, three gallons of ketchup, and the help of the neighbor's chihuahua 'Skippy'. Why would I want to see an amateur film they made of a bad musical when they were 22? And then fawn all over it like a horny puppy dry humping a Furby?  It would be like selling a tape of Rachmaninoff practicing scales on the piano at age 5, and considering it an ""early work"". Our artists have no chance to develop their craft anymore. Trey's skills were simply not developed when he made this movie, and anyone who isn't blinded by celebrity or their wild obsession with South Park should see that too!  Now, after all of that, I want to say, I didn't necessarily ""not"" like this movie. I liked it in the Ed Wood sense. I enjoyed the camp. The purposefully bad lyrics. The purposefully exaggerated gore. The self consciously atrocious acting. I liked it- but only in the sense that it was ""camp"". Like Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"", it was so bad, it was good! So I laughed. I thought some of it was silly. Anybody who thinks there is anything of lasting quality in this movie has been deep throating the exhaust pipe of a Toyota Tercel with transmission problems.  It was kind of entertaining. Trey and Matt admitted they made the movie in a rush, not having a clue how to make a film, with barely a cent to work with. It shows. I'd shave off my eyebrows if with a year of preparation, a reworking of the script, a proper auditioning period to find high quality actors, and the assistance of Marc Shaiman with music, the movie didn't improve ten thousand percent. I'm a fan of some of South Park, especially the movie which satirized fanaticism and Hollywood's hypocrisies perfectly. But that doesn't mean I have to like Trey's work when he was just some obnoxious college kid with an attitude- and a dream.  The movie occasionally made me laugh. That doesn't make it a good film. I think Adam Sandler is funny. I also think he's a terrible actor. Just because he makes me laugh in a film, doesn't mean I think he's a quality performer. For some reason, most people who watched this movie used the following equation. Funny = Spectacular acting, music, and direction. Half of what I found funny was due to obviously bad acting, music, and direction. If a movie makes you laugh, that doesn't make it a high quality movie. I can differentiate between laughing at something, and respecting it for its craftsmanship. Can you?",980726400,7,7368,4.610983981693364

Back in college, Parker did a play about some guy in Colorado history called Alfred Packer. Later, he made a movie out of it. No one would publish it until he became famous, at which point the great Troma team published it
This is a musical. Like most Parker films, this one is about Mormons. About half dialog, half singing. Standard cast (Matt Stone, Screech, other UColorado alumni). Surprisingly, there are almost no jokes here - this isn't really a comedy. Well, maybe it is since all the characters act odd (stone is a liar, parker loves his horse, Screech wants to have sex, another guy is always happy), but no one really tells jokes or does anything really unrealistic. Despite supposedly being a cannibal movie, it's not really shocking or antisocial. It's just sort of a historical pic with some really bad songs (the reporter's love song, the schpedoinkle day song). Oh yeah, the plot - Parker (Alfred Packer) leads a bunch of mormons to colorado in the winter. If the movie was 90 minutes, about 70 minutes of it is spent talking about walking and whether they're lost. Maybe 5 minutes is spent when the freezing party eats a guy who was already dead. It's a slow paced movie

It's hard to find a  guy with this sharp a sense of humor, so I'm just glad Trey Parker is out  there sharing his talent with us.  The music is catchy and the lyrics are  witty - what more can you ask for?  And if you don't die laughing watching  Matt Stone's character, you're probably brain dead.

1077996,5,630576350X,"Trey Parker is a modern-day Jule Styne or Oscar Hammerstein. He is singlehandedly bringing the musical back into our lives, and I for one, am eternally grateful. To be honest, the only reason I saw this movie at first  was because I think Trey Parker is pretty hot. Not to mention I love  musicals, too. The cast is perfect, Matt Stone and Dian Bacar, as always,  are wonderful. The songs are really witty, but there's one thing that I  wonder about. Does the begining of ""That's all I'm asking for""  purposly sound like ""Kansas City""? Was that a choice? The song  ""Other side of myself"" (I think that's the title) is one I'll be  using in auditions. I hope he comes to the New York theatre scene soon, we  need him!",964483200,2,716,4.412213740458015

The film isn't the greatest, but the songs show Trey Parker to  be a musical genius, and you can see where the early inspirations for South  Park come from.
Very funny stuff.",958435200,,399,4.364864864864865
1077999,4,630576350X,"I truly enjoyed this film, but if you don't find South Park funny you may tire of the style of humor. I felt it was ok for my kids (7 and 11) and allowed them to see it. They both enjoyed it, but some of the more graphic  scenes bothered my 7 year old.
There is little of the swearing you  expect from Trey Parker, and very little sexual inuendo. There are some  over-done graphic dismembering scenes, but they are so over-done as to be  almost cartoon like. Watch youself and decide before allowing children to  watch.",958003200,3,519,4.309278350515464

There is something in it for  everyone: singing, dancing, blood, gore, side-splitting humor, and snowmen,  of course.

1078030,5,630576350X,"One night I saw that a movie by Trey Parker was on so I taped it. I thought it was pretty cool,  but not the greatest movie of all time. But then this funny bald man started building a snowman, and I started taking a  lot more attention. When he was shot, I was laughing so much I almost  smashed into a poodle. ( Don't woory about that though.) Now a year later,  the whole movie has grown on me, I watch it consistanly. I have gone  completely mad. I reckon it is better then Baseketball and Southpark (Both  of which kicked arse.) Trey Parker is a brilliant song writer, and I listen  to each Cannibal song, From ""That's all I'm asking for"" to  ""Let's build a snowman"". This movie has seriously got me  addicted. Greatest movie ever, and it only cost $100,000?  All I can say  is...""SNOWMAN!""",956102400,,795,4.304054054054054

As for the movie, some may be turned off by the low production value.  But considering the budget (practically a Blair Witch budget) and  the age of the filmmakers (21-23), this movie looks very good, even down to  the ""colorized"" look of the film.  Trey Parker's muscial score  and sense of humor overshadow any budget limitations.  The hilarious  commentary in which they polish off two bottles of scotch during the course  of the movie is also suprisingly informative.

I have all of the songs from this movie stuck in my head.  This is the greatest musical ever made!  The story line is brilliant, and  the scenery is beautiful, I guarantee that if you like Trey's style of  humor, you will love this movie.  If you don't like Trey's style, you will  probably like this movie anyway.  See it, you won't be sorry.",954979200,,506,4.071428571428571

1078035,5,630576350X,"For anyone that saw South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut, or Orgazmo, and was turned off by the swearing or inappropriate content, this movie is unbelievably funny with little swearing and almost no sexual references.  If you loved the sex and swearing of those first two, and could go for some  violence to boot, this movie is the greatest!  The violence is almost  nonstop, but it's not as disturbing as it is goofy.  They use a ridiculous  amount of blood and gore.  It's hilarious.  I recommend this movie for  anyone that isn't a Puritan.  By the way, what is it with Trey Parker and  Mormons?

1078036,5,630576350X,"The movie itself is a great bit of inspired gross lunacy that you'd probably expect from the South Park team (Parker and Stone).  It's a homage to the old Hollywood movie musicals like Oklahoma, but it's about a true  story of cannibalism in Colorado Territory before it became a state.  You  wil not be disappointed:  the movie is a hoot, and the songs are  terrifyingly catchy.
But the DVD special features are extraordinary, and  the director's commentary audio track is worth the price of the disc alone.  Parker gets together with Stone and many other stars of the movie, they  announce their intention to drink heavily during their commentary, and  proceed to do just that.  A constant stream of hilarious behind-the-scenes  anecdotes, the complete low-down on Lianne (the girl who broke Parker's  heart and inspired a lot of the movie's content), and a lot of jovial abuse  of the movie itself (they cheerfully admit they were 22 and didn't know  what they were doing half the time).  The banter among the commentators is  lightning fast, uniformly profane, and unbelievably funny.  I wanted to  split a bottle of whiskey with these guys before I heard the director's  commentary, and now I have to at least once before I die.  The cast and  Troma should be proud:  this is what all DVDs with Special Features should  aspire to.
I can only hope that Parker stages a similar event for the  as-yet-unavailable Orgazmo disc (when, Trey, when?).",953942400,80,1448,4.836065573770492

After Packer returns as the only survivor,  he is charged with the crime of cannibalism, but the truth is a bit more  complicated.
