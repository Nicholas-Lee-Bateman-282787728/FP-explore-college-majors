8360936,4,B002BANC6G,"I really like these guys music! This concert is really excellent actually as far as the music itself and the sound quality. The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is because I reserve that high of a rating for a concert in which the music is excellent and the show itself is something special - like Pink or Madonna's for example. However, I do definately recommend this concert and I'm sure I'll give it plenty of listens in the future!",1290470400,,439,4.365853658536586
