I look forward to being a teacher, and look forward to helping spread the message. Educating girls will change this world. Education should be a basic right of all children. It is up to us not to let them down. Our silence will only condemn us all. Act. Wake up, and change. Loved it.",1396915200,,459,4.287356321839081
6095816,5,B00GOT1244,"This movie is well-made, awesomely narrated, powerful, and approaches very difficult topics in a delicate, kid-friendly way, but not in a way that dilutes the reality of what these girls have experienced in their lives. I was brought to tears multiple times the first time I watched it; then I showed it to my 7th grade students and got a truly amazing response across the board. One of my 12 year old boys was begging me to let him borrow my copy of the DVD so he could watch it at home and feel free to cry while he watched (he was embarrassed to let his emotions go in front of his classmates). My students were all deeply touched by what they learned and it really got them thinking about how grateful they should be for what they have and QUESTIONING why things are the way they are in the world. A truly wonderful documentary for all ages and audiences.",1396742400,13,859,4.375

It was an incredible piece of movie-making -- poetic, beautiful, shocking -- but also the message of many girls' situations around the world was very powerful.

6095820,5,B00GOT1244,"The hard truths this film reveals are life changing. It points to the truth that by educating girls we can literally change the world for the better in ways that nothing else can. No political system, no religion, no application of money, no war, no demographic shift. Absolutely nothing should be a higher priority because from THIS change all the rest will flow naturally. We can achieve political resolution, resolve religious differences, spend money more wisely, stop wars and most of all END the suffering of millions of women AND men on this planet. If you watch this film and fail to take action you don't get it. I was in favor of equal pay for equal work, in favor of the promotion of women to positions of power and equal treatment in all areas before I saw this film. But this message made me a hard core feminist. The way women are treated in EVERY nation needs to change. Let's fix this world. Let's educate every girl.",1388188800,51,933,4.559523809523809

6095822,5,B00GOT1244,An excellent documentary.  It brings much needed attention to the global problem of leaving girls behind in education while providing some good solutions.  Teaching girls raises every level of society and we need to talk about and support this issue more.

Although it doesn't show American girls (I'm an American myself), I know how they feel. I was abused when I was fifteen, and it took me a year and a half to forgive the person who hurt me. So, this movie really unites girls who have been through or going through abuse.

We did not watch the whole film. We watched 4 vignettes and analyzed them for both rhetoric and overall discussion about the issue of girls'  education. I liked that it connected the issue to other issues like poverty, sexual assaults, and marriage, but in a way that was not so complex that a middle school girl could not understand. The girls were especially captivated by Yasmine's story and it made for GREAT conversation, everything from the director's purpose of choosing to present it via graphic novel style to intended audience to victim shaming.

6095858,5,B00GOT1244,"The audience viewing the film is an essential factor in evaluating its efficacy. Of course a college student would be underwhelmed and need more concrete information. But I am showing this film to a middle school girls' group because this age group is just opening up to starting, and I mean starting, to consider the darker side of humanity and injustice. Developmentally, this is the great place to start educating them. Too much dark, too much depression, and you risk actually alienating or scaring them. They need to be introduced gently and incrementally if they are going to do what needs to be done, which is cultivate social consciousness and feel empowered to change the world for the better.",1457481600,,702,4.907563025210084

It is certainly eye-opening for the average American high school student but it is age appropriate.  Although it discusses many heavy themes, it refrains from displaying graphic or shocking images which makes this a great resource for teachers.

My only complaint is with regards to the packaging of the DVD itself.  It was substantially damaged on arrival.  In the end, this is inconsequential to the value of the movie itself, but was a disappointing drop in the usual quality control standards of products I purchase from Amazon.

6095872,2,B00GOT1244,"To preface this review, I showed the film as extra credit to an upper-level college course on the politics of race, class and gender.

Pros:  The film does a nice job of bringing in stories to articulate the many ways that a lack of education can have detrimental effects on young girls and, as they grow up, women.

Cons:  The overall presentation was pretty weak from both an educational standpoint and a motivational standpoint.  The movie relies only superficially on the use of logos... very few statistics are actually presented to help drive home their points.  Additionally, the movie seems to want to avoid the most depressing stories in favor of maintaining a dose of optimism... this isn't to say that the stories presented are exactly happy, but many of them have ""happy-ish"" endings (all things considered) or are presented in an odd fashion (highly stylized, artsy additions that make some stories come off as corny; a rape story that is presented in such an abstract way, via a cartoon, that some of my very bright college students didn't understand that the story was about rape at all!).  Add that to the fictionalized presentations of the girls' true stories, and the voices of easily recognizable celebrities doing the narration, and the use of pathos simply fell, well, flat.  Which on the one hand sounds terrible, because these girls have gone through absolutely terrible things (even those with the least sad stories are still terribly sad), but on the other hand is simply the reality of the matter-- if you study this kind of stuff, you've simply seen worse... much, much worse.

During the movie it seemed odd to me that they'd choose these stories given that more depressing stories are out there, but by the end it became clear that this film was as much (if not more) about empowering women than educating the audience.  The problem with this is that the optimism is presented as being fully warranted and I do not believe that should be the case... such a presentation actually makes it easier to write off the horrific crimes against girls and women every second of every day.  And because of that, and because they are treading very controversial political territory, the film really offers no solutions-- in fact, though education is offered as the lone solution, the last scene of the movie lectures us-- the audience-- about not blaming a laundry list of things, including religion and culture, and it does not tell us who or what to blame instead (and fails to address why these things should not be blamed, which is confusing because they seem linked to the reason of why girls in these places can't have an education in the first place).  The one other solution they seem to mention is directed toward victims of violence, slavery, abuse, etc. and is problematic as well:  the story of a young girl from Sierra Leone tells us that reaching out to their mothers will help solve the problem, but we saw in previous stories in the film that mothers were directly responsible for the horrendous conditions they lived in and, in the case that a mother actually tried to help, nothing was able to be solved despite her best intentions and attempts.

Optimism + no place to focus the blame (and therefore channel efforts to create change) = a movie that is not particularly inspiring.

Instead, they try to inspire us in the very last scene by showing a bunch of girls taking their burqas off and running into the sunlight.  The main problem with this scene:  the fact that the girl whom the story was about REFUSED to remove her burqa for the film due to fear for her safety (something that is totally understandable and for which I do not blame her).",1426896000,15,3683,4.738654147104851

6095874,5,B00GOT1244,"""Girl Rising"" is a startling and moving documentary about the lives of girls around the globe - girls who don't have the opportunity to get an education.  Deprived of the chance to go to school, whether by culture, poverty, or gender bias, their stories are compelling and inspiring.  The ripple effects of females being deprived of schooling are astounding, and well-documented.  After viewing this film, I realized how much education is taken for granted in our country.

6095885,5,B00GOT1244,"There are more women than men yet, somehow, women are the most marginalized of any minority one could name - except for children, which leads us to the nine female children, ranging from about ages 6 to 14, profiled in the 2013 documentary GIRL RISING.  Their homes in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Haiti, India, Nepal, Peru, and Sierra Leone offer little, education the denied common need that reduces their chance of knowing a life better than their mothers have.  Sure, this film is sponsored at different levels by the egregious likes of Nike, whose international sweat shops may have child labor making their sneakers; Goldman Sachs, the ""vampire squid"" investment bank that's made the poor even poorer; toxic mortgage peddler Bank of America; and the noxious Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which wants to hand over your Social Security to Wall Street; but GIRL RISING's message is too powerful to question the company it keeps.

Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchette, Selena Gomez and Anne Hathaway are among the narrators of the nine tales GIRL RISING tells.  As much as America has gone downhill starting with the Reagan '80s life is still nonetheless even worse in more than a few corners of this planet, the film reminds us. How interesting that, in America today, teachers and public schools are the latest targets of those who want to funnel yet more from working people to the affluent, as GIRL RISING drives home its point about education as the one thing denied to girls in those nine nations.",1411171200,2,1509,4.952569169960475

6095894,5,B00GOT1244,How amazingly brave and courageous these young women prove to be through their insistence on and pursuit of education. Wow. This film really stirred a call to action inside me.,1403222400,,176,4.9
6095895,4,B00GOT1244,"Not every short story seems to fit within the theme, but overall a great film that is very touching and inspiring. Not too much of a downer, which is impressive given the topic and the current societal landscape of girls' rights and living conditions around the world.",1401840000,2,268,4.723404255319149
6095896,5,B00GOT1244,"I incorporated this documentary into a class I was instructing last semester. It is a unique account of various females and their struggles with stratification of education access due to their gender.

The movie takes on a blended understanding by discussing females psychological and societal influences on the access to education. Very good",1401408000,2,342,5.452830188679245
6095897,4,B00GOT1244,"This DVID strongly advocates for the education of girls as the key to freeing girls from the oppression of servitude, arranged marriages, sexual abuse and other tragedies which plague girls worldwide. The film introduces the viewer to 7 girls in approximately 10 min segments. Each segment is preceded by background facts pertaining to the issue addressed in the subsequent segment. The lives of these girls are poigniant examples of the tragic consequences which await millions of girls.

The filmakers have made every effort to present the real circumstances of each girl free of sensationalism. Because of the sensitive subject matter, the film is not appropriate for young children. The film is limited to the extent that all of the girls are black- or brown-skinned. No white girls are portrayed. The implicit message is that white girls do not have threatening life experiences while their colored counterparts do.

The quality of photography, script and graphics is high. Overall this film is an excellent resource for educating young people and adults about the issues which girls face.",1401148800,21,1094,5.2457142857142856
6095898,5,B00GOT1244,"This is a journey around the globe that introduces the viewer to how unbalanced the world can really be. Going to school for many young women is not a given, and can be dangerous or against the law. Hopefully this will open up the hearts of the ones that were not aware and will prompt help and support for the ones that fight for their education rights.",1401062400,3,354,4.298507462686567
6095899,3,B00GOT1244,"This movie reminded me of my freshman year in college. The cultures studied view women as second class citizens at best.  The poverty imposed upon those unfortunate women is a result of no education, no societal standing, coupled with a perverse male dominance, that in America would be classified as spousal abuse. It is not a happy film, but allows insight into other women and their plight.  The moral, could be, pick your birth country with care, if you are a girl!",1400457600,,469,4.7073170731707314

6095910,5,B00GOT1244,This is a must see!  Everyone should be aware of how our girls are being treated throughout the world.  It is time for the degradation of the female species to end.,1400112000,2,164,4.258064516129032
6095911,5,B00GOT1244,"Very moving and beautiful documentary chronicling the lives of various girls in difficult circumstances around the world.
It's beautifully shot and crafted. The girls are unforgettable and their stories are told in such a compelling way.",1399507200,,237,5.611111111111111

6095913,4,B00GOT1244,"The topic is very important and the DVD should be widely distributed especially among educators and among elected policy makers. I found it difficult to view some parts where people were in the ""shadows"" so in those parts I lost interest.  My eyesight, age 85, is not the greatest but I generally do not have this problem with professional films.  President Carter's recent book, ""A Call to Action"", covers this topic very well and should be recommended reading for educators and policy makers.",1399161600,6,494,4.9397590361445785
6095914,5,B00GOT1244,"This documentary offers a glimpse into the lives of nine girls. Each shows grit and determination in the face of often cruel circumstances. For girls/women in the US, this documentary is an eye-opening experience to the many blessings we often take for granted.",1399161600,,261,5.093023255813954
6095915,5,B00GOT1244,"It was mesmerizing.  I saw it with my 15 year old granddaughter in a school auditorium.  No one moved for the entire movie.  The next day I purchased it so that my husband, grandsons, and friends can, too, see it.  Yes, it's about girls working through seemingly insurmountable roadblocks for an education, but it's also about focus, determination, and working through those roadblocks to their goal which is educational for boys and adults alike.",1398902400,,447,5.0
6095916,5,B00GOT1244,Wonderful. I learned and cried and learned some more.  Please share this with your family.  Especially your daughters. Would recommend to anyone who wants to know how to solve the problems of the world.,1398729600,,202,4.911764705882353

6095918,5,B00GOT1244,"When I saw this film at a local viewing, I was transfixed by the power of these girls' stories. I had to own the video.  I am currently planning viewings in my own home.  I want to evangelize this project as much as I can.  It is a real, meaningful way to make a difference in the world!",1398384000,,287,3.913793103448276

8625670,4,B00GOT1244,"The trailer for ""Girl Rising"" made me feel very emotional - the way you feel when something is very beautiful and meaningful. As I then watched the movie I felt the stories were powerful, poignant, poetic and profound. In America we take education for granted and don't always realize it isn't the way things are around the world. This documentary succeeds in telling the stories of girls who desire education and want to improve their lives. Some of their lives start out really sadly but many of these stories end happily. I felt this documentary was beautifully filmed and I hope it will bring awareness to real issues in the real world. Don't be surprised if this movie makes you cry. Freedom is a beautiful thing. The only reason I took off one star was because the situation of polygamy was taken so lightly in one story. How can a woman be happy knowing her husband is marrying other women? I guess it is normal in some countries but this issue may need to be explained to teenage viewers.

8625671,2,B00GOT1244,"I ended up tossing it out and not even showing my class. The narrators voice had such a strong accent, difficult to understand. The movie was extremely slow, and followed the girls and their families during an average day. It didn't hold my attention and would certainly not hold the attention of other teens.",1502668800,,309,4.7407407407407405
