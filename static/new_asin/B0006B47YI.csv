Since purchasing this video I have watched it over 50 times, Ken ""Puppy"" Lanewood makes my heart melt. I have started a religious society devoted in creating ourselves after this man!

We believe this video will one day bring world peace, and may be the cure for cancer. Unfortunately scientists believe that Ken may be infected with numerous STD's and that is life along with many others that he has come in contact with will be cut short. We wish he had made a DVD about those types of infections first before completing this masterpiece. Our Religious will miss our God. Buy it now while it and he lasts.",1237420800,,727,4.549618320610687

but I'd have a hard time saying it's worth a whoppin' twenty dollars(!)
worth of use for just one shopper...",1186617600,,189,4.588235294117647
8041027,1,B0006B47YI,"Basicly this is just and instructional video on how to use Ad-Aware spyware removal software.  The software isn't that hard to use anyway, so why do a video on it? Click the check box to remove, wow, thats difficult.

The production of the video is bad, (I think the host is also the camera man), it appears to be done with just a home camcorder.

The ""so called"" spyware expert is just some tech shop guy.  He does not go into any details on how to remove the spyware other than using Ad-Aware.

And finally, ""End Spyware Forever"", hardly, Ad-Aware only knows about spyware thats already attacked systems.  With new software coming out daily, (maybe hourly), it's only a matter of time before your system will get hit.

A video on keeping your system updated, locking down your system, using firewalls, setting security zones, and not going to porn sites would be far more informative.",1136592000,,886,4.67741935483871
