1687837,1,B0000633SA,"I was hoping that this video would have done 2 things:  1, given me a bit of a tour of the filming locations, like Christ's Church, Gloucester Cathedral, Glenfinnan Viaduct, and more and 2. given me a bit of history that led to the book, both mythic in telling and in real locations like Wookey Hole Cave.  Basically, I wanted a fan tour without having to pay the 2-3K it costs to actually do that.  Instead, I was given sort of ""this is the junk we have in our pocket"" presentation.  It's not worth your money, unless you're REALLY interested in listening to some guy who calls himself the ""white witch"" babel on about proper broom flying technique.  I suppose the author date should have clued me in that it wasn't likely too be all that useful, but I'm still disappointed (to the point I signed on to author this review), and I watched this for free.",1200009600,3,853,4.407643312101911
1687838,4,B0000633SA,"It is an alright documentary.  But if you are any kind of a ""Pot-head""  (i.e. a serious Potter/Rowling fan) you won't find anything really new in here it was filmed in 2001. Still it is nicely filmed and excellent narrations by Hugh Laurie.",1185148800,2,240,4.558139534883721
1687839,5,B0000633SA,We liked the movie very well. It is always interesting to learn whats behind something that is popular.,1171670400,2,103,4.777777777777778
1687840,5,B0000633SA,"i loved it, it was very informing and entertaining",1124323200,3,50,4.666666666666667
1687841,4,B0000633SA,"I did like this DVD but do wish it had been close-captioned.  Sometimes the Brits are hard to understand, especially when one has hearing problems, even with hearing aids!",1120694400,8,171,4.896551724137931
1687842,4,B0000633SA,"Most fans of Harry Potter (books or films) will enjoy this documentary. I believe I saw it either on PBS or on a discovery channel type TV channel.  While it suggests that it will uncover how Harry Potter exists in the real world, it actually covers related topics quite well for children and family viewing.  You learn more about related topics, but always from a springboard of discussing Harry Potter's settings, people, objects or practices.

As mentioned, the narration is very good and the program is quite entertaining.  However, one should not be expecting to see any clips from the HP movies here, nor is this a Harry Potter tale. This is an exploration of the subject matter that Harry Potter's world is drawn from.

Still, it's great fun for HP fans and families, and I wouldn't hesitate to order one up. Just realize that it isn't one of the movies.  (See other reviews above, as they are all quite accurate!)  PS: I watched the whole thing LIVE on tv and tapped it on an old VHS...tried to get my two HP fan kids to watch it, but they didn't get into it as much as I thought they might. ""It's OK Dad, but can we go out and play now?"" ""Why did you make us watch that DAD?""  Guess it can't be all bad if they want to go play instead of sit glued to the TV all day, eh?",1102982400,,1279,4.278008298755187
1687843,1,B0000633SA,"This is, as advertized, a PBS special about the possible origins of some of the ""Harry Potter"" mythology.  The production values are on a par with that kind of show - a bit interesting.

  What I found so very disappointing was the fact that ALL of the ""Special Features"" were nothing more than the original show cut differently with an extra 30+ seconds of new material thrown in here and there (perhaps a whole 10 minutes more in total?)  The extra material looked like deleted scenes from the original.

  I would not have purchased this DVD had I known that.",1101513600,26,562,4.55
1687844,2,B0000633SA,"I got this DVD for myself and my 4 obsessed children, hoping to see more of the real places  mentioned in the books - like a little travelogue perhaps, as well as more about the author, and some discussion of the myriad references to mythology in the books.  There was some of that, but there was also a great deal of a fellow in robes calling himself ""The White Witch"" talking about wicca and how his wand works, etc., which was not at all what I was looking for.  I wound up not letting the children watch it at all, as the good did not balance out the bad.",1076112000,38,559,4.110091743119266
1687845,5,B0000633SA,Well potter is made up of many diffrent people in history. J.k Rowling did her research. I loved this movie it showed sites from the movies and also showed how harry potter is made up of more realty then myths. I think anyone who is a fan of Harry Potter or even a fan of Mideviel times should buy this!,1053734400,30,303,4.066666666666666
1687846,4,B0000633SA,This DVD contained a lot of interesting information on real background events contained in the Harry Potter series. The author's childhood home with the cupboard under the stairs. A childhood playmate named Potter. The real N. Flamel. Also includes fun extras.,1048464000,50,260,5.365853658536586

7958603,1,B0000633SA,My nine-year-old HP fan didn't like it.  it's fairly boring.,1438646400,,60,5.0
7958604,5,B0000633SA,Very interesting movie revealing things about how the movie was created.,1407801600,,72,5.636363636363637
7958605,3,B0000633SA,It is a short book but interested.  I have the book for my son on Christmas and he like it.,1385078400,,91,3.55
7958606,3,B0000633SA,"The film provided some of the real-life background which gave JK Rowling some fodder for the magical world she created.  It was a bit interesting, but rather amateurish and shallow.  It seems to me that someone threw it together quickly after the first Harry Potter movie came out, to capitalize on the popularity of the franchise.",1370563200,,331,4.892857142857143
7958607,5,B0000633SA,Such fun to read. I'm a fan and will be always. I have several books and enjoy the background of this wonderful series. Hat's off To J K Rowling.,1360454400,,145,4.0344827586206895
7958608,4,B0000633SA,This is a fun addition to my ever-growing Harry Potter collection.  The background information provided is interesting and fun.  Pottermaniacs will enjoy learning about the very real stuff that support the Harry Potter stories and mystique.,1327708800,,240,5.638888888888889
7958609,2,B0000633SA,i ordered this thinking it would be a lot more about Harry Potter but it's sort of a pseudo documentary that's not very good.  There are a couple good segments and it's a little interesting but i would have MUCH preferred to hear about JK Rowling and the Harry Potter characters more than the 'possible' places and people she might have been writing about.  i thought it was okay but my kids thought it was super lame!,1257033600,,418,4.415584415584416
7958610,5,B0000633SA,The book was in great condition and came quickly.  It's a good choice if you like Harry Potter books.,1255478400,,101,4.315789473684211
