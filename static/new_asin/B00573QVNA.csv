8460231,1,B00573QVNA,Started out interesting but quickly lost appeal. I thought there would be more skating.,1464307200,,87,5.285714285714286

8460233,4,B00573QVNA,"If you never look below the surface, you'll dismiss this movie/documentary as nothing more than a group of lawless anarchists.  But as the action unfolds you find Brewce (the owner of Skatetopia) is a business man, mentor, and believer in the pursuit of those things that make you happy.  Too often we are consumed by other people's idea of what life is supposed to be.  It's nice to see someone living as close to freedom as life will allow.  And provide the same freedom to others that he wants for himself.  Who wouldn't want to cut free and be themselves?  I, for one, enjoy the chaos created on 88 acres of insanity.  Give it a go.",1419206400,2,636,4.431034482758621
8460234,1,B00573QVNA,"I am an avid skater crazy about movies especially docs, nothing quite like real life people and places inspiring and raising your level of understanding. Or like this movie pissing you off! I would say watch it just to see what a little property and a lot of bad ideas get you, a dumb ego maniacal hillbilly. Comes complete with white trashy girl friend, hepatitis b and c, and a buncha pathetic fatherless drones.  I quite watching when leaving jail after 60 days he said ""I really miss being a dictator."" This guy's just some douche that figured a way to make money off people who just wanna skate and have fun.  Creepiest part is he has an entourage of like 16 to 20 year old boys he gets to do his laundry and clean. John Wayne Gacy did the same thing and he had like 20 bodies under his house this guy's got acres upon acres.",1406246400,,830,4.280254777070064
8460235,1,B00573QVNA,Sucks.  Horribly.  Don't waste your time.  I wish had not wasted my money.,1399766400,,74,4.538461538461538
8460236,4,B00573QVNA,"This movie was educational in the respect that life has many risks and rewards. I like that Brewce Martin built a skate haven from the ground up with little to no support but from close friends and pure donations. It is really quite great what Brewce and his crones have created, and the insight to what pure chaos that ensues anarchy. This movie is for Anarchists and skaters alike for anyone else steer clear.",1354147200,2,411,4.5675675675675675
8460237,5,B00573QVNA,An exciting look into a culture that many people would never know about. Brewce is truly one of a kind.,1318636800,3,103,4.2
