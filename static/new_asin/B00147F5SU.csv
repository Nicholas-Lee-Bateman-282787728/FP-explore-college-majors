8254612,4,B00147F5SU,"It Figures exercise host Charlene Prickett released this VHS tape about eating healthy in the early nineties. Her exercise series lasted 18 seasons and was shown on Lifetime network for years.

Charlene is the reason that I watched the series. She talked to her audience. She encouraged everybody to get up and move. She was joined by two friends who worked outside like Renee Martin (a genetics researcher); Lonnie Balbi (a lawyer); Lori Shyba (a journalist) and others. She included seventy year old Ruth, an inspiration to us all.

Charlene talks to the audience where we are only human with regards to our heating habits. Charlene is a realistic person and character. She was born and raised in Arkansas. She married a Canadian architect and they moved to Calgary, Alberta Canada. There she became a local television celebrity.

This VHS tape shows Charlene in her own Calgary home. It is modest in reality. I wished she was still on the air. She is sorely missed by her fans like me who could never get enough. She should have her own talk show on radio or television or the Internet.",1429056000,,1089,4.751322751322752
8254613,5,B00147F5SU,"I've worked out with Charlene since the 1980's and have most of her videos.  I remember her talking about her book with this title.  I could never find the book so when I found this old VHS I jumped at it.  This is a great hour of tasty low fat recipe's, snack ideas and she cooks everything while talking in her kitchen.  Charlene has a great sense of humor (she could easily do a cooking show) and her recipes are easy and look really good!  Some of the info is a little outdated - like having to take the skin off the turkey before cooking to reduce the fat content (in one of her later workout videos she said she learned about the membrane around the bird that keeps the fat from soaking in to the meat so you don't have to de-skin it) but for the most part, the information is great and still relevant.  Charlene is a perfect blend of 'cute' and 'knowledgable' - you can't help but love her. Now if she'd only get back on the air with more workouts and recipes.....",1308528000,,971,4.193548387096774
