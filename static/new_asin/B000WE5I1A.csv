8222899,5,B000WE5I1A,"SHELL YEAH! THIS MOVIE WAS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE! I mean, I like the first one because it was a ""first attempt"" at a movie and I respect that. That must've went well cause this second is AMAZING! The concept is simple. A good variety of characters show up and come together... AND BEST OF ALL... On second thought, I better not spoil it. Besides THAT part probably just appeals to my twisted nature. Heh heh,",1389139200,,433,4.493670886075949

8222904,4,B000WE5I1A,"Private eye Richard Moore once was a cop, so you'd expect him to have some enemies. But things get way out of hand when an old case seemingly resurfaces in ""Case Closed Movie - 14th Target,"" a tightly wound whodunnit that relies on the tried-and-true manorhouse-style mystery. It's a far more intricate and perplexing mystery than its predecessor, with plenty of red herrings and subtle clues sprinkled along the way.

First, Inspector Maguire is shot with a crossbow bolt in the park. Then Ava is poisoned with her favorite chocolates. Obviously since they're both main/recurring characters, neither one dies.

But it's the beginning of a series of bizarre attacks on people that Richard knows who are connected to certain numbers (or, if you watch the Japanese dub, have a number in their names) -- with symbols of playing cards left at the scene of the crime. As the crimes pile up (including Dr. Agasa getting shot in the butt), the police unveil a possible suspect -- a recently released convict who Richard shot and put away over ten years ago, injuring Ava in the process.

But the real danger comes when Richard and Maguire try to warn a wealthy magnate at his floating resort, and find themselves with a large number of potential victims -- a model, a sommelier, a photographer, an American businessman, a food writer, a cop and Richard himself. But soon the resort is sealed off, and people start being murdered again. And Jimmy realizes that the suspected man is not the culprit... but one of the guests is.

While the previous ""Case Closed"" movie was a straightforward thriller, ""The 14th Target"" is a variant of the everybody's-stuck-in-a-remote-manor-house-and-somebody's-murdering-people type of whodunnit. The inexplicably Anglicized names from the English dub make the numerical connections... kind of improbable... at best (nine buildings? Eleven patents? Three siblings?), but otherwise it's an excellent, twisty-turny little mystery.

While it starts off as a pretty typical serial-killer case, it blossoms into a full-out mystery when the main characters all come together in the seaborne hotel. Red herrings, seemingly irrelevant clues and gruesome murders abound, until the literally explosive climax hits, complete with collapsing buildings, guns and a terrible choice. But it's also far less humorous than the average Conan adventure, complete with a dark subplot about the reason why Richard left the police force, and a car crash with terrible consequences.

In fact, Rachel takes more of a front-and-center role in this particular movie -- she's being haunted by nightmares about her mother being shot, which turn out to have some roots in the past. Conan still gets the spotlight, though -- he gets a high speed chase, some clever deductions, and even a dramatic climactic rescue. And we see that Richard can actually be a pretty competent cop and detective sometimes, if still kind of a doof.

""Case Closed Movie - 14th Target"" is a thoroughly solid little mystery movie, only handicapped by the stretched-to-the-point-of-snapping substitutions in the English dub. A nice solid little anime mystery.",1258156800,,3129,5.196428571428571
8222905,4,B000WE5I1A,"Unlike The Timebobmed Scyscraper, this movie is actually very much in the spirit of the show, presenting a mystery which the main character must solve.

The ending is somewhat supprising, but I figured out the romanitc subplot between Richard and Eva before it was explained, which might mean I'm a little disturbed.",1243641600,,316,5.076923076923077
8222906,1,B000WE5I1A,"The quality is very very very very.... bad!!!

The Anime is very good. But because of the bad quality this is a worse product I have ever seen.",1201132800,,143,4.107142857142857
8222907,4,B000WE5I1A,"If you are a fan of Conan Edogawa, then you're really wasting your time reading reviews, because you know this show has it all.  Action, adventure, romance, suspense, and most importantly mystery!  This movie is no exception to the quality of the show or the other film they've released.  The english voice actors all return for their roles and the sound quality is good too.  The plot is not too far from the norm for Conan, but it is pretty original.  Plus, having a feature length, there is more time to flesh out the story.  Enjoy!",1199836800,6,535,4.520833333333333
