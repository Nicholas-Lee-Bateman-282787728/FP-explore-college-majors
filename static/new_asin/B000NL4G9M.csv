Some are repetitive and that gets a bit boring, especially since there are way too many car commercials. However, many of the commercials are truly reminiscent of days gone by. Overall I think it is overpriced for what you will be getting. I wouldn't buy it again.",1485907200,,393,4.7101449275362315
