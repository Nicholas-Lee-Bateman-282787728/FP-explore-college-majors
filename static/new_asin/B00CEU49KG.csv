As somebody too young to have experienced the Pigpen years, Bruce Hornsby was always one of my favorite of the Dead keyboardists and he is here on accordion, electric keyboard and piano.  Incredible second set with Help>Slipknot>Franklins Tower with Dark Star and then Space>Stella Blue.... hitting what are my personal favorites all in one show.

I really appreciate that the View from the Vault used the media from the soundboard and video screens from the live show since it really brought back the experience of being there.  While some might find them hokey,  I was surprised at how clearly I remembered some of the ""psychedelic"" segments that the Dead put on the screens during the second set.  However, the one downside is that there is no crowd microphone so the connection to the crowd is very muted which removes a huge component of the Dead shows... for example, on the tape I have of this show you can clearly hear the roar that filled the stadium at the start of DS when we realized it was something unprecedented.",1501632000,,1056,4.774725274725275
8581089,5,B00CEU49KG,"This was a interesting time for the Dead, with Vince on keyboards and Bruce on the keyboards, grand piano, and accordion like on the first song Cold Rain and Snow. How hard it must be to take that big piano on tour with them. Wang Dang Doodle is a stand out with Bruce with his look of amazement just being their with Garcia.",1466985600,2,325,4.174603174603175
8581090,5,B00CEU49KG,I attended both of the shows on the DVD at RFK. One of my favorite venues to see the Dead. So pleased that these are available on DVD. Incredible - both the video and audio quality.,1456876800,4,181,4.055555555555555

8581092,5,B00CEU49KG,"I was at this show and this brings back so many wonderful memories.  Great video, great sound, and the videographer captures not only the Dead but the crowd's energy.  This actually brings back smiles and sadness that the Dead are done forever.
Excellent purchase.",1441152000,2,264,4.9772727272727275
8581093,5,B00CEU49KG,"Vince Welnick era shows get a lot of flak for being inferior---This show is great. Nice setlist and I love the two keyboard lineup w. Welnkick and Bruce Hornsby. Trust me, this show won't disappoint...Love Wang Dang Doodle and the Drums/Space and of course Dark Star...I have been listening to a lot of Welnick era recording lately and if u keep an open mind, they can be a really rewarding listening experience",1418083200,2,411,4.722222222222222
8581094,3,B00CEU49KG,"Like all dead shows this one has some very nice moments... but after 35 years or so the shows are pretty standardized, its hard to stay fresh and find inspiration playing the same songs for 6000 shows. Ironically IMHO the curse of the keyboard kept them fresh. God knows what they would have sounded like if Pigpen was still playing keyboards. Ironically I think Vince brought some freshness to the band, and a little inspiration and it seems to me those are the best parts this night. So unless you are a diehard or not a Vince hater...",1409961600,2,537,4.489795918367347
8581095,5,B00CEU49KG,Great vintage Dead concert from 1991 in DC. Bruce Hornsby on keyboards is a nice bonus and this was a long concert.,1372636800,2,115,4.2727272727272725
