8673844,3,B00MPUGA7K,"This is a rarely available way to see this film, which is enjoying renewed interest due to an opera, and the opening of Cuba.  Would have liked to have had multi-lingual closed captioning on this release, as it is an English language film, and this is a spanish version playable in US market.  Good film - not a complete Blu-Ray package",1492387200,,336,4.491803278688525
