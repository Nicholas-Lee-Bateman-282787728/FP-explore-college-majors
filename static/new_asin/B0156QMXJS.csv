7429232,1,B0156QMXJS,The trailer looked cute but i rented this movie and i would not recommend buying it! Very low budget movie. Couldn't keep my interest. Could have been a good movie. Actors not very good at acting either.,1456185600,,203,4.513513513513513
7429233,4,B0156QMXJS,"I think that this is supposed to be Christian but I don't fully agree that it is. The messages that this movie sends are mixed...they have an alcoholic beverage every time they are together. I think that if he was a Christian, he shouldn't be with this girl at all. Not that he is better than she is but that men are weak and she was pushing herself onto him all of the time. There is too much temptation here. The dialogue is strange...who speaks like that? Throughout the movie. ""He hasn't kissed"" , ""He hasn't kissed anyone"", ""please close them"" , ""If you lose you have to give me a kiss"", "" dated him just so I could get a kiss"". Who says it that way? I would say that ""he has never kissed a girl"", ""Please close your eyes"", ""If you lose, you have to kiss me"", that would be  more realistic. I like the movie but still, find it strange. The music is weird too and doesn't fit the parts. The ending kiss is not smooth or realistic. Why, if this girl loved him and he loved her would they do this to each other?  What was that fight at the cabin? How could she not see that Kami was sabotaging their relationship and how could he not see that also? How could he not see that Kelsi was the one chasing her and not the other way around? Some things don't seem realistic here. But, I am happy that he decided not to hold all this against her and she decided to start trusting the right person, the person that she has a relationship with and not her so called frenemy who was sabotaging their relationship...they both got into this for the right reasons but they both fell in love...it could happen that is why, if you don't want to marry a person, you shouldn't date them.",1456185600,8,1672,4.205607476635514
7429234,1,B0156QMXJS,"Definitely not a ""faith"" movie.  Bad production and mixed messages on faith and Christian values",1455667200,10,96,5.4
7429235,3,B0156QMXJS,"The movie was supposed to be romantic. Instead it looks like a horrible drama that just went on and on. The guys like Tyler don't even exist, even in a Christian world. I don't know who wrote the script, but it was just a bad drama movie with some Christian faith undertone. It was somewhat disappointing, I liked the ending, but it almost makes me think they fought so much that how that relationship can survive. He is a self-righteous judgmental guy who thinks that he treats women right, but he more comes across like a self-righteous prick. Anyway, a little disappointing. I put 3 stars because actors did a good job, but the plot is just unrealistic.",1530057600,,656,4.567796610169491
7429236,1,B0156QMXJS,I so couldn't wait to watch this movie after watching the trailer. Within the first 5 minutes you could tell this was a low budget film. The plot while seemingly good was executed terribly wrong. The acting was awful. Glad I didn't pay to watch this movie.,1528675200,,256,4.468085106382978

7429239,1,B0156QMXJS,This is not a Christian movie! The actor lies at least two times which was very disappointing since. And it's all about being a good person but not about God's standards. They are so childish that it's just annoying.,1525824000,2,216,4.564102564102564
7429240,1,B0156QMXJS,"This was just a confusing mess.  It was almost like they had different character stories going on because some of the characters seemed to be two different people.  I couldn't keep up with the changes, just sat scratching my head.
The worst part is that I have never watched a movie and wanted so badly for the couple not to get together in the end.

7429242,2,B0156QMXJS,"Mostly bad acting and a poor script made this laughable for me.  Unrealistic...completely.  BTW, I don't think a scout is going to interested in someone 30 years old or so.  (He looks older.)  Please, she was not a bad girl and he was not a great guy for ""not kissing"" anyone until he finds his true love.  Kissing can help bring romance and can enhance love.

7429250,3,B0156QMXJS,"I like some parts of the movie, that for the guy sticks to his ""kissing"" goal despite girls throwing themselves at him, but glossing over that he's a Christian and she's not, rolls her eyes when he wants to bless the food, for example, is a red flag for me.  Maybe he should've waited for the kiss a little longer after they've set a firmer foundation about things like that.  A lot of drama in this movie.",1518134400,,406,4.259740259740259

7429279,1,B0156QMXJS,"begins with a demonstration of how sporties with their prepubescent ""no girls allowed"" clubs are into homosexual dominance rituals such as ""baseball"" and ""purity"" rings rather than hetero activities (not shown how they molest other males in their locker rooms and insist young people ""stay in school"" to be subjected to criminal assaults and homosexual regimentation).  The homosexual dominants spew such things as ""women are not my focus, it's baseball"" as if participating in thuggery makes human connectivity impossible (which perhaps it does and may be the purpose of compulsory homosexual regimentation courses in ""schools"").  Especially disgusting is how such thugs form ""promise keeper"" all male gangs to support their lesbian criminal slave owning peers in the divorce racketeering fraudocracy (also not shown in the putrid film but the primary purpose of felonious enslavement is the majority subsequent divorce).  More amusing was the ""what would Jesus do?"" as if that protector of decent hetero working girls was somehow as absurdly homosexist as Tyler (see also ""The DaVinci Code"" for further understanding of what Jesus actually was as distinct from what the belligerent blaspheming slave mongering ""religion"" gangs pretend).  The subversion of healthy hetero relations is compounded by such lines as ""Mommy said so"" and ""I wish more guys were like you"" and ""they (the felonious enslavement demanders) say things worth having are worth waiting for"".  Then there's the pretense that females freeloading on males in the ""dating"" swindle system is ""treating [her] well"".  For that matter the implementation of pretense of *ownership* based on prior hetero relations is but another part of the criminal gang insistence on perpetuating ownership rituals into monogamessiness.  Pretense that being a puppet of millenial criminal enslavement gangs is ""values"" was the most absurd spewing of all corroborated by Tyler having developed no human feelings whatever.  It was a well photographed, curiously well played film but the intent of promoting felonious enslavement and denial of human hetero relations required a one star rating for this putrid, males as second class citizens to be tortured maimed and murdered, felony tax evading ""religionist"" film.",1504828800,,2260,5.511560693641618
7429280,1,B0156QMXJS,"NOT A CHRISTIAN MOVIE - in truth it is anti-Christian. For a true Christian, faith that guides and affects my life putting Jesus first is a given.
It is what Christianity is all about.
The movie begins with an unknown male telling Heather he cannot see her any move because she doe not shave his beliefs/values.
Then the story follows Tyler whose values are strong enough that he has not kissed a girl - waiting for the 'right' one. Tyler concludes Heather is 'the one' despite the clear message that she says she is nicer now, but still does not understand or believe in his value basis. She emotionally loves him and has become a 'nicer' person.
The movie teaches that being a nice person and 'feeling' some kind love is, in the end, what really matters. God's love wants the best for the other person, to help them be all that God made them to be. In this movie it is extremely frustration to watch 2 self-centered young people hurt each
other. He loses big time by dropping his basic values and replacing them for a girl. Contrast the first quick scene of a young man honoring his beliefs over Heather.
It begins with a quick scene of another male breaking up with Heather because she does not share his basic values. Tyler sells out his values
for a pretty face.",1504828800,4,1267,4.4655172413793105

7429286,2,B0156QMXJS,"WARNING #1: this is not a Gospel movie. This is a be-a-good-person movie. I believe there is a critical difference.
WARNING #2: this is not a movie demonstrating good dating habits for ""good people"" either, especially guys.
Explanation #1: The title includes ""Catching Faith"". We went to a church while on vacation a couple of years ago, and afterwards asked our kids what they learned. The upshot: never, not even once, was God/Jesus' death on the cross/ our sin/ need for a savior mentioned... The whole service was about being good to others, moral citizens, consistent servants in good works. This movie reminded me of that. Be good. Don't be judgmental. Be loving. Christian movies define ""good"" according to the Gospel message of sin-Christ's death-saving grace-faith in Him. The writers of this screenplay set up multiple opportunities to have this explained...and fell into the ""being a good person"" definition. Friends, the way to hell is paved with good intentions. Being good is not faith in Christ. So I'm not sure what ""faith"" is being caught.
Explanation #2: ""Pitching Love"" - the movie pits the hunk (having never kissed a girl and his intent to wait) against the hunk-ette (having every intention to break him and get him to kiss her). So somehow this creates safety from being in stupid situations? Like going hot tubbing alone together late at night? Like going to a secluded cabin?? While I would love to believe people watch movies for entertainment only, sadly people get their ideas of what is proper vs. improper from movies. So, if you are a person dating, liking the idea of saving your kiss (and -implied- sex), realize that you need to practice discernment all the way around and not put yourself in compromising situations, believing that your personal commitment to saving yourself is going to save you. It won't.
If you want to have a discussion about dating, discernment, and dumb - watch this movie. It will be a good springboard for a Bible study.",1502668800,20,1980,4.895833333333333

7429308,2,B0156QMXJS,I thought the trailer was good and seeing that it was filmed here in Utah it intrigued me so I rented it. I think the story showed potential but it was executed poorly. The transitions from scene to scene were confusing and I often felt lost in what was really going on. The main actors seemed to have good chemistry but could have used a better director. A lot of the dialogue was awkward and too ambiguous. The movie is suppose to be a Christian film but the faith of the characters was never directly addressed. It's like they were constantly hinting at things but were never brave enough to just come out and say them. Another reviewer mentioned the music in the film being great and with that I would have to completely disagree. If anything I feel the music was poorly chosen and hurt the story way more than it helped. It defiantly showed the limitations of a small budget. There is a lot more I could say about the film but these where the things I had issue with the most. If none of these things bother you and you're willing to watch the movie more than once to understand the storyline then by all means rent it and see it for yourself. But I can't recommend it.,1462320000,,1174,4.316742081447964

7429311,4,B0156QMXJS,It's a clean movie with some solid acting---something to watch with young teenagers and not be embarrassed. The music is great and really adds to the film.,1459036800,,155,4.777777777777778

7429314,3,B0156QMXJS,"A baseball player meets a softball player and they each decide they will have  a relationship with the other for different reasons. Some mentions of faith but no faith is shown. Lies, gossip, and bad behavior are the norm for this. The guy looks like a young Dean Cain. The actors are good looking, just a sad mess. Make me think of 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days'.",1456272000,,364,4.2

8732827,1,B0156QMXJS,"So I turned it on thinking ok 2.5 stars, it can't be as bad as that.. I'm sure I'll be ok.. let's give it a chance. I didn't make it past 15 minutes where the guy is referencing how much he loves the baseball stick to make contact with the ball . The acting was not matching with the voices. It literally sounds like they have a different voice track from what the actors are doing. The storyline is confusing. I agree with another reviewer saying something in regards to it seeming like each character was two different people. I don't think this should even qualify as a ""B"" movie.",1535500800,,583,4.3090909090909095

They got to know one another by spending time together. Having picnics and playing sport. It wasn't jump into bed on the first date. Some people actually believe in waiting for marriage. How refreshing.",1534204800,,332,4.946428571428571

8732831,2,B0156QMXJS,"I don't understand this movie. The plot makes zero sense. The guy is supposed to be Christian, I guess...?? He doesn't act like he is. The main couple behave inexplicably, one minute acting like they like each other, the next getting mad over nothing and refusing to talk; they apologize for nothing a few times...I just, I can't even.  Nobody behaves like these people behave.  If he's a Christian who wants to remain ""pure"", why is he dating a non-Christian girl who is trying to seduce him?  At first, the movie suggests his baseball career depends on him dating her (as if that makes any sense...sure, baseball recruiters often jump to conclusions about who players are dating and then say they will only hire a player if he continues dating some random girl...), then just drops that motivation like it didn't exist.

Things just happen one after another with no logical connection or reason.  People behave inexplicably and nothing ever makes sense. At one point, he hands her a ""purity ring"" and doesn't explain what it means, just says something about ""make good choices.""  I am a Christian, and I am not even sure what a purity ring is supposed to mean...no sex before marriage, I am sure, but what about holding hands, kissing on the cheek, hugs? What does wearing it signify? Do you have to be a virgin to wear it? What if you wear one and make out...do you have to take it off? I don't know...how would the non-Christian girl know what the ring means?

I ended up not liking either of the main characters, and I didn't even care when things were resolved...I ended up mad at the way the final inexplicable flip-flop in behavior happened rather than happy.  I don't understand why it is called ""...Finding Faith"" when no one finds faith...she isn't a Christian at the end of the movie...who found faith in what? where? when?

It's like it was written by a squad of teenagers with ADD who have seen some Christian movies and think they understand how humans behave... and they wrote each scene separately so none of it fits together and the characters behave randomly in different scenes.  The production value (film quality, music, acting, etc.) was acceptable.",1533168000,2,2172,4.722222222222222
