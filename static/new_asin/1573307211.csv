191653,5,1573307211,My 2 1/2 year old daughter loves it. Be borrowed it of a friend 3 months ago and had it for 2 weeks in which time i think we nearly wore it out. Since giving it back she still asks for it so im buying it for us. We have another rainbow fish movie but none seems to quiet equal the one with dazzel the dinosaur. We didn't find it scarey!,1020556800,3,336,3.7464788732394365
191654,5,1573307211,"My 4-year old daughter likes The Rainbow Fish, but she especially loves Dazzle the Dinosaur. It is a story about how two young dinosaurs, Maia and Dazzle, reclaim their family's rightful home from the mean Dragonsaurus. She especially likes the video musical score "". . . it's all about courage, believing in yourself . . ."" as the two go about their mission. My daughter also has the book, which we read to her at night.",1009411200,5,421,4.552631578947368
191655,2,1573307211,"I just bought this video for my 2 year old and I'm  so disappointed.  We just love the board book Rainbow Fish, so I assumed, wrongly so, that this video was  age specific, and therefore perfect for her.  It has two scary scenes with a big toothed shark chasing Rainbow Fish as well as a snaggly toothed dinosaur who roars and tries to get Rainbow Fish.  It starts with Rainbow Fish being so unkind to his fellow ocean creatures.  Even though the ending teaches a lesson, it comes too late into the story, and appears to be insincere.  I would not recommend this video to anyone.",994550400,11,579,4.40566037735849
191656,4,1573307211,"I bought this video two years ago and have found that the children really love it.  I show it on rainy days for recess, and it has served to spark many valuable conversations about the morals discussed, interested the children in reading the other books in the series, and interested them in a wonderful card game that has been produced to go with the story.  They love both stories and want to watch them over and over.",987379200,9,420,4.441558441558442
191657,3,1573307211,"I felt that the video was a poor adaptation of the lovely story by Marcus Pfister.  In the book, the fish is naively vain, too wrapped up in himself to realize that he is alienating others.  In the video, he is outrageously  mean and rude, making the redemption story at the end unbelievable.  I had  to hide the video because my toddler was learning some very rude phrases  from it.  In addition, there is a gratuitously scary segment in the middle  that wasn't in the book and that did nothing for the storyline.",945734400,28,514,4.451612903225806

7798139,5,1573307211,I am Nathan Guel. I am eighteen years old. I watched Dazzle the Dinosaur when I was really young. We got it sometimes from the library. It was a pretty good show. I think this is a Rainbow Fish show I have also seen. I do not own it though. I really hope Dazzle the Dinosaur is not out of print. On Amazon it does not say 'in stock'. That makes me wonder if brand-new ones will continue not to be in stock. I sure hope it will always be available.,1510963200,,447,3.923076923076923

7798143,5,1573307211,"Rainbow Fish has been one of our most favorite videos of all times.
It is watched at least 20 times per week.",1389052800,,109,4.0
7798144,4,1573307211,"I purchased this as a gift for my dinosaur fan who watched it on YouTube and wanted it. He enjoys watching Dazzle the Dinosaur. As a preschool teacher, I have rather high standards for children's literature. The Rainbow Fish is not on my must read list mostly because the prose is rather ordinary. The illustrations are above average and children like it.",1360108800,,355,4.741935483870968
7798145,5,1573307211,"The children in my kindergarten class love these movies.  We have used them to talk about how to treat others and the importance of being a friend.  They love to sing the songs, I really need to find the lyrics - if anyone has them or knows where to find them I would appreciate it.",1238112000,,282,4.109090909090909
7798146,5,1573307211,Nice video  of the book!  There are intense portions. It was helpful to warn the children and keep the room not dark but dimly lit.,1236988800,,131,4.2
