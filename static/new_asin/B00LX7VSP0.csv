This is exactly the kind of thing that gives writers a bad name. Get over yourself you stupid hack Nick Cave. How in the world did they expect anyone to be able to make it past 5 minutes of this mindlessly overthought dribble is beyond me.

Trying so hard to make much ado about absolutely nothing.",1453507200,,334,4.459016393442623
6509152,5,B00LX7VSP0,Nick Cave shows that anyone can write music about any subject and make it really excellent. If you are an artist struggling with artist block this film is a great boost to the imagination and worth viewing several times.,1453507200,,220,4.666666666666667
6509153,5,B00LX7VSP0,"I honestly cannot understand why this has been reviewed so poorly by viewers. Perhaps they expected something different but I thought it pretty great. There were moments of insights into his methods, his views, his humor, his approach to life and performances, his hope, his past, and the recording of Push The Sky Away. Some parts were quite humorous while others were deeply philosophical. It's a worthwhile watch for fans. I'll end with a quote from the film that really stood out to me:
""All of our days are numbered. We can not afford to be idle. To act on a bad idea is better than to not act at all because the worth of the idea never becomes apparent until you do it. Sometimes this idea can be the smallest thing in the world; a little flame that you hunch over and cup with your hand and pray will not be extinguished by all the storm that howls about it. If you can hold on to that flame, great things can be constructed around it; things that are massive and powerful and world changing. All held up by the tiniest of ideas.""",1448841600,,1037,4.3782383419689115

6509175,5,B00LX7VSP0,"This isn't a biographical movie, it's a guide to one man's creative process. First we hear Nick Cave ruminating on the nature of creativity. Then we witness a faux-psychiatric interview where Cave riffs on some childhood memories. We overhear conversations among creative people, including wonderful conversations with real people who may or may not ""be"" there at the time, like the mental conversations we find ourselves holding with absent friends. And then the filmmakers follow Cave and his bandmates into the studio and onto the stage to bypass all that talking and show the creative process in action.
The film is a brilliantly realized piece of art in its own right.",1442016000,,673,5.072072072072072
6509176,4,B00LX7VSP0,"Decent documentary, worth seeing. Found it a bit lacking on the Bad Seeds history, Blixa makes a brief, brief appearance etc. Starts strong but I found I lost focus in the last 20-25 mins.",1440979200,,188,4.5588235294117645

6509178,5,B00LX7VSP0,"You probably need to know Nick Cave for a long time and consider him a poet already, otherwise he may come across as rambling and/or ostentatious. But if you, like me, grew up with his music, this is a wonderful insight into his creativity and his inner world. You won't her much of his classic hits from the '80s or '90s, but some of his most recent music, which I had not paid enough attention to, came to life in amazing ways.",1440028800,,429,4.2439024390243905

6509182,5,B00LX7VSP0,"20,000 Days on Earth might be my favorite music related film I've watched. It's somewhere between a documentary and dramatized look at Nick Cave, his career, and his creative process.

It works well in this regard because it captures him on an intimate level while reflecting the artistic elements of his work with a fever dream sort of storytelling. Cave comes off as passionate and sincere without looking pretentious, which I think is difficult to capture when filmmakers try to capture the essence of a personality like Cave.",1438819200,,529,5.011363636363637

6509189,3,B00LX7VSP0,"A very interesting concept by a brilliant, long time, chameleon in music.
I enjoyed the back story. Places he'd lived, music and musicians he worked with
and some still were pals. The women and life events that influenced so many of those
great songs and the new material he seemed to constantly be working on.
My only issue was the length of the movie. Nick Cave is known for those
rambling, cerebral, haunting, yet beautiful songs, fans (like me) embrace.
However, the producers/editors of this movie might have suggested ""tightening things up""
a bit to improve the overall watch ability. 3 1/2 stars actually for me....",1437177600,3,622,4.877358490566038
6509190,2,B00LX7VSP0,"Not a traditional documentary but more a staged episodic visual musing on Nick cave. If one enjoys his music but does not have any particular emotional attachment/connection to the artist then it's apparent that throughout he is merely showing his public mask while occasionally pretending to let it drop. (Sort of like at the end of the prisoner number six rips number two's mask off only to have another mask revealed.) There are some definite missed opportunities but those opportunities where never within the scope of the ambition of the project. Still, a worthwhile watch.",1437177600,,578,5.094736842105263

While the framework is a fictionalized day-in-the-life, the stories and questions answered are real. Cave chauffeuring his collaborator's around Brighton while they talked was an inventive idea, especially the funny and poignant conversation with Kylie Minogue.

6509208,3,B00LX7VSP0,"First off, I'll make it clear...I enjoy Nick's music, even appreciate his soundtrack contributions.
But a ""semi-dramatized documentary"" is just a bit too pretentious and dull for all but the most committed fan.
The limited performance footage is a major drawback as well; musicians just really aren't that interesting to watch when they aren't onstage, though they may be enamored of their image, most people (fans included) just get bored watching them noodle around in the studio or at a fake therapy session (or is it a interview with some faceless dork)?

6509220,4,B00LX7VSP0,"It seems to me that the majority of the 1 star reviews are from people unfamiliar with Nick Cave or maybe vaguely familiar with him and I will admit upfront that this film will probably appeal mostly to people who are already fans and have a general knowledge of who he is and his work. Some reviewers seemed to think this is a fictional narrative type movie, it is more of a fictionalized documentary. The directors have set out to make a film about ""Nick Cave"" but have approached it in a conceptual manner not just a straight forward doc style where you will find interviews with friends and colleagues and performance clips. It becomes more a film about ""Nick Cave"" the personality than the actual person, told through a mix of existential inner dialogue and preconceived scenes of dialogue- to take the place of the traditional ""tell me about the time you..."" interview segments. Yes, it is an artsy, ambitious film. If you are a Nick Cave fan you will enjoy it as a very different take on how to tell the story of a person. Film buffs may even enjoy it from this angle. But if you are looking for a film that will tell you a straightforward story or your basic concert film this probably isn't for you. I found it to be a fresh new take on the musician documentary.

6509266,4,B00LX7VSP0,"Solid but scattered look into the amazing life of one of the best live performers I have ever seen--Nick Cave. The film is a mix of a chronological procession through Nick Cave's life--including looks at rare photos and artifacts from his past, the making of his ""Push the Sky Away"" album and small vignettes with some of his collaborators over the years--namely Blixa Bargeld and Kylie Minogue. The film has a very catchy style which sucks the viewer in and in the end leaves you wanting as it cannot hope to cover all the significant data of a 35+ year career. The best parts are when Nick describes his songwriting and his views on the artistic process. At 100 minutes this needs to be double that to be fully satisfying or more focused on either Nick and his career in retrospect or the work on the new album--thus 4 stars vs. 5. Still a worthy view into the dark mind of one of music's most individual and captivating personas.",1426291200,2,932,4.520710059171598

6509376,1,B00LX7VSP0,I love the title. I had read some of the other reviews and decided to give it a chance. However it was very very slow and could not keep my interest. I did not watch more than 10 minutes of it.,1424649600,,193,3.731707317073171

6509382,4,B00LX7VSP0,An enigmatic approach to the universal truths of taking on the role of a performer. A heavy layer of grit covers each scene and Cave's narration scrapes all the mud off life's tumultuous twists and turns. I thoroughly enjoyed this film and have found comfort in knowing there exists artists who take the world of performing seriously and chase the ghouls of truth out of their earthy graves.,1420588800,,391,4.764705882352941

6509388,5,B00LX7VSP0,"As a long-time Nick Cave fan, this was the icing on the cake for me. Ah, to see Mr. Cave in all his glory, and tongue-in-cheek in so many ways. The scenes with Warren Ellis are just fantastic, and the small bit with Kylie are a nice surprise. It's a beautiful glimpse into this amazing man's life. Highly recommended for any Cave fans, and anyone interested in what goes on in an obscure musician's life in a day. Beautiful. Loved the scenes with the psychiatrists. So many good quotes.",1418083200,3,486,4.47191011235955
6509389,4,B00LX7VSP0,"Sort of documentary about Nick Cave, now in his 50's.  I'm not a big fan but it was an interesting film.",1418083200,2,104,3.9523809523809526
6509390,5,B00LX7VSP0,"Excellent film, hard to say where the reality lies in the narrative, but that in and of itself carries the theme discussed throughout.

6509394,5,B00LX7VSP0,This is a great peek inside how many musicians minds think. Anyone who knows Nick Cave's work knows how he is different from others; it is great to see how he is similar. A documentary not just for super fans.,1416960000,5,209,4.25

6509397,5,B00LX7VSP0,"If you are a fan of Nick Cave, you know you are going to see this film regardless of any reviews.  The format is unique, and allows the viewer to see a different side of Nick Cave, albeit an artifice.  I plan to purchase the Blu Ray so that I will have access to any extras - to me this is the one drawback of the digital format.  I purchased the digital format for the sake of expedience, so I could view the film as soon as it was available in the US.  At this point, you can purchase a disc, so I would probably recommend that option rather than the digital.",1416528000,8,561,3.982142857142857
6509398,5,B00LX7VSP0,"An intricate and stylized blend of documentary and fantasy, 20,000 Days on Earth is a chronicle of a day in the life of Nick Cave, the legendary Australian singer and songwriter who has led an ever-expanding-and-contracting group of musicians known as the Bad Seeds for 30 years.  He drives around Brighton, the rain-swept seaside city he now calls home.  He visits his therapist.  He contemplates a personal archive of diaries and photographs.  He watches Scarface with his twin sons and also has (perhaps imaginary) conversations with such luminaries as ""Where the Wild Roses Grow"" duet partner Kylie Minogue and actor Ray Winstone, who played a significant role in the Cave-penned Western The Proposition.  We also see he and his Bad Seeds composing and rehearsing songs from their most recent studio album, Push the Sky Away.  A bright peripheral personality is Warren Ellis, the bearded violinist who has become Cave's foremost collaborator.

Cave is a larger-than-life figure on record, conjuring a wildly profane lyrical universe of angels and demons, deviant outlaws and romantic heroes.  And he may be larger still on stage:  gyrating, lean, well-tailored, screaming, whispering, and doing his very best to both seduce and disturb the audience, particularly the adoring victims in the first few rows.  This film, directed by Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard, lets him explain itself and hold an intimate type of court, but it never feigns absolute honesty:  it is an intoxicating cinematic act of sleight of hand, diving beneath parts of this cult hero's mythology while also forging fresh dimensions of chic, sinister mystique.  The photography is beautiful; the hand-held, on-the-fly images often expected from a pop-music documentary are replaced by careful compositions and evocative atmospherics.

Cave is a masterful weaver of stories not only in song, but also in conversation, and it is a pleasure to hear a man with his vocabulary and acumen for introspection explain, say, the torments and triumphs of creativity.  There are several touching moments, including remembrances of an enigmatic father who read from Nabokov for bedtime stories and abruptly died when Cave was still a teenager.  There are also instances of humor, apocalyptic daydreams, and enthusiastic cultural memories, such as a Nina Simone concert Cave recalls transforming from tense and uncomfortable to celebratory and transcendent as the night went on.  For people who are established fans of his, this film is the definition of a must-see.  It is a gift beneath the tree on Christmas morning.  (The other gifts might be a Colt .45, a lyre, a red right hand, and a dead firstborn.)  I suspect it will also entertain and delight Cave neophytes, even if it mystifies them at first.  Such is the quality of the production, and such is the magnetism of the man.",1416355200,20,2843,5.165938864628821

8668709,5,B00LX7VSP0,"I was expecting this to be a fairly indulgent look into Nick Cave's persona, but was so pleasantly surprised by the fantastic blurring of reality and fantasy in this film. Now, I adore Nick, don't get me wrong - his music & writing have been incredibly important to me since my late teens, but sometimes he almost chokes on his own bizarre cult of personality. Not so here - his neuroses are almost charming, and even though it's not a true documentary, it somehow felt the most honest I've ever seen him (and I have read/watched many, many, many interviews. Bless him.) I loved the look into his process, the little vignettes with familiar faces like Warren Ellis and to see Blixa reunited with his old friend (even if it may be something of a fever dream)! I wasn't keen on ""Push the Sky Away"" at first, but this film helped me connect to the album better as well. This documentary-film really pushes the genre and is a wonderful meditation on the perils & pleasures of persona, memory, creative process and more. A must-see if you are a Cave fan!",1456272000,,1049,4.526315789473684
