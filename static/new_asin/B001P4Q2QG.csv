8332092,5,B001P4Q2QG,"It's 8 episodes of the new Care Bear series on CBS.  Great show, my daughter loves it.  Very colorful.  I find myself watching it too.  The old version of Care Bears was on when I was little. I was excited to see the new version of the Care Bears, more modern.  The show has lessons on caring and sharing. Real cute. Look it up on CBS, they have clips of the show for preview.",1245369600,2,376,4.027027027027027
8332093,4,B001P4Q2QG,"I give this DVD 4 STARS. This is my first Care Bears DVD and they are so cute, it's almost hard to criticize them at all.  The stories are wholesome, cute and fun, although not as educational as some of the other shows for this age group. There were a lot of previews before the show starts. Episodes are: Growing Pains, King Grumpy, Cheer, There & Everywhere, A Case of the Grumpies, Gobblebugs, Grizzle-ized, Two of a Kind, and Stand Up and Cheer. My daughter seems to like it (she's 2).  Overall happy with the purchase!",1243900800,,523,4.4375
