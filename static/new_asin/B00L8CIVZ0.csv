6474222,4,B00L8CIVZ0,"While an alternate version of the story, the movie did a decent job of keeping key elements from the manga.  Like others, my only real complaint is the subtitles.  Although the description says it is the Japanese movie w. English subtitles, the movie was distributed from Malaysia and the subtitles have been translated from Japanese to Malay or Chinese then to English.  Unless you want to constantly read then re-read the subtitles because they did not make sense, fork over the extra money for the Japanese version or wait until the Hong Kong version is released.",1411430400,14,566,4.875
6474223,4,B00L8CIVZ0,"Overall the film was above average.  Personally I didn't like the updated story line (changing the setting from Victorian England to an Asia in the future setting), as well as some drastic character changes.  Subtitles were not the most accurate.  But the acting was very good, and visual fx were realistic.",1410998400,5,307,4.980392156862745

6474228,3,B00L8CIVZ0,"I waited a long time to see this movie.  Black Butler, or Kuroshitsuji is based on the manga  of the same name by Artist/writer Yana Toboso and published in GF Fantasy. This is my favorite Manga. The original manga is set in an alternate universe version of Victorian England, and while this movie is set in the future (2020) the plot is basically the same.  We follow the story of Shiory Genpo, the sole surviving descendent of the Phantomhive (the character's original name) family.  The original character Ciel Phantomhive sells his soul in exchange for revenge against the people who humiliated him and murdered his parents.  He becomes the ruthless force in the London Underground, Queen Victoria's watchdog, controlling the criminal underground by force, while running a legitimate business empire. In this movie, the demonic contract has been passed down for generations, each succeeding family head contracting the services of the demon butler Sebastian Michaelis.  But there's a catch:  the leadership of the family can only be inherited by a male, and the sole surviving heir...is a girl.  The story follows the original Black Butler Manga, barring the absence of a few characters:  Finnian, the Gardener, Bardo, the Chef, and Grell.  If you've seen the original Black Butler, either as a manga or anime, and liked it, you shouldn't find this story too different.  I wanted to like this movie, but there were some problems, and not with the film itself.  The movie is marred by awkward translation work which hampers some of the philosophical points the author tries to make in regards to Sebastian and Shiory's relationship.  Also, there is the annoying tendency for the translator to call Sebastian ""Sebas-chan"" which is a 'little girl""  style diminutive used by one particular character in the manga who is 'not' part of the story 'here'. (Kind of like calling a girl named Christine ""Chrissy"", or Michelle ""Missy"") On a closing note, I'd like to correct the people who did the Amazon.com synopsis.  ""Black Butler"" is not related to the ""Captain Harlock"" story in any way, shape or form.  ""Captain Harlock"" is the story of a space-going pirate.
Black Butler is an entertaining film, but if Warner Bros. is going to distribute Japanese movies, they should at least try for accurate translations.  This is like reading a book with out of focus printing.",1406332800,40,2364,5.005115089514066
6474229,5,B00L8CIVZ0,"Great movie. I think a more official release will be June 4th.  I saw this in the theater and the English subtitles in this particular DVD are wrong just FYI.  They change the wording in several spots (i.e. instead of using the word ""master"" ""lord"" instead"" and some other lines)",1405382400,13,279,4.56
6474230,5,B00L8CIVZ0,I love this movie. It was very entertaining. The only thing I can possibly say negative is the movie's subtitles in English were at time awkward and at times contain incorrect grammar.  I could still follow the movie and understood.,1405123200,8,232,4.8
6474231,5,B00L8CIVZ0,Was a very goo movie! It came in beforehand.  I enjoyed watching it~! ^^ :3,1404777600,,75,4.0

I have seen this movie before, and I guarantee you, it is a beautiful piece of cinema!",1448150400,,114,4.0
6474234,4,B00L8CIVZ0,"I love this movie and I've already watched it twice. It got to me a lot quicker than I thought which was great but the subtitles are pretty bad. If I didn't already understand the plot and what Black Butler was about, I would have been sooo confused.
Another thing to keep in mind, this is a Japanese movie so keep in mind, like their books, the front of the case is actually the back. So the label isn't backwards, it's just the way their books and dvds are..",1445212800,,460,4.179775280898877
6474235,4,B00L8CIVZ0,"not what I thought I be, but it was ok. had to have the sub titles on throughout the hole thing it leaves much to be desired.",1444608000,,125,3.6666666666666665
6474236,5,B00L8CIVZ0,"Wonderful!! I watched it last night and although the grammar was a little off, I could still understand it fine! Having been a fan of Black Butler since I first started to watch anime, I thought the plot would suck because it wasn't like the actual anime, but I loved this version. Definitely recommend!!",1443225600,,304,4.648148148148148
6474237,4,B00L8CIVZ0,Weird story line and sadly it change the main character. Other than that the movie was good.,1440201600,,92,4.470588235294118
6474238,5,B00L8CIVZ0,"I like the movie, the quality of image and sound is good, now, the translation to English is really not the best, but personally I don't mind it. I had no trouble with the packaging or delivery (nothing that was not caused by my doing! :D )",1439164800,,240,4.127659574468085
6474239,4,B00L8CIVZ0,not what i expected,1438732800,,19,4.0
6474240,5,B00L8CIVZ0,I loved the movie although I am not sure if it was just the kind of tv I was using but sometimes parts of the bottom line of subtitles were cut off. and there should be an option for full screen or wide screen other that I really enjoyed the movie and the description of what the movie was about was pretty much on the mark,1433462400,,323,3.909090909090909
6474241,5,B00L8CIVZ0,We loved watching this movie! It played in our DVD player perfectly. The picture quality and the sound was also very good. The subtitles were also well done for the movie. We are fans of the Black Butler/ Kuroshitsuji  series of Manga and Anime. I recommend this movie for Older Teens to Adults. Some scenes in the film may be unsuitable for younger viewers.,1433203200,,358,4.59375
6474242,3,B00L8CIVZ0,"The English subtitles are really bad. You will literally have to re-translate it in your head for the movie to make sense and sound more like the characters from Black Butler Anime / Manga. It's also strange to see Sebastian with long hair.

The story was predictable if you watch the anime, but it was entertaining and the mystery really felt like it was from a short story written by Yana Toboso.  The movie has great potential and could turn into a really in-depth series and explain why it's basically the manga repeating itself decades later.  Watch if you are a fan of the series, but be prepared to laugh at the subtitles and brace for plot holes.",1433203200,,654,4.52542372881356
6474243,5,B00L8CIVZ0,Love it!!!!,1430697600,,11,5.0
6474244,3,B00L8CIVZ0,"subtitles were awful , this is not Kurositsuji lol",1429747200,,50,4.666666666666667
6474245,3,B00L8CIVZ0,"I haven't read the graphic novels this movie is based on so wasn't familiar with the plot. For me the movie storyline was interesting but got pretty predictable half way through. The ending scene in the factory dragging on a bit with not much action and a lot of talking when you knew what certain characters were going to say and do, this could have been edited down a bit, as the entire movie goes for two hours after all.  The ending scenes were the only time I started to get bored.  But there are some really cool choreographed action scenes throughout, we're initially introduced to the demonic butler character and his master in a warehouse where young girls are being beaten and shoved into wooden crates.  We're quickly introduced to some awesome butterknife (yes butterknife) fight action here.  There's other methods of combat and weapons used throughout the movie including a really cool female character as the kicker of ar in a firing guns action sequence.  The action in all fight scenes is over the top unrealistic but it's a lot of fun.

The demonic butler actor looks very similar to the one seen on the graphic novel covers so obviously very well cast there.  The master though, if we're supposed to buy that everyone she comes across thinks she's a boy, the fact the actress has a very feminine face doesn't really make this plausible. I don't know what she looks like in the books but for someone who hasn't seen her in them I just couldn't believe anyone would mistake her for a boy. Even her short haircut isn't one you see on guys.  The clutz maid character I thought was really good although I have no idea if she's like the one in the graphic novels but she was enjoyable to watch for sure.

The film is spoken in Japanese with English subtitles, sometimes Japanese subtitles when a public speaker or some character is speaking in English. Sometimes the two languages stay on the screen at the one time.  It would have been better to have put the subtitles on a clean version of film before the Japanese ones were added.",1428192000,,2046,4.580821917808219
6474246,4,B00L8CIVZ0,one of the prettiest films I have seen in a while. gorgeous costumes. and it was true to the anime in my opinion. same feel. subtitles were a bit of a mess in a couple of places...but that happens and it is easily overlooked,1427414400,,224,4.113636363636363
6474247,5,B00L8CIVZ0,Best movie ever! It follows the anime yet it's a whole new story..if you pay attention to the details it says after the Phantom hives were attack their daughter comes back after a few years with the butler..she then gives the appearance of a man an changeso the family name to.protect her new identity as a man..I know there will be a part 2...subtitles are fine it's not hard read...,1426377600,,384,4.5
6474248,5,B00L8CIVZ0,Love this movie A+++++,1426291200,,22,4.75
6474249,4,B00L8CIVZ0,"This story is set in an alternate modern-times in Japan. Shiori is a decendent of Ciel Phantomhive who disguises herself as a boy in order to inherit and to carry on the family ""business"" on behalf of the English Queen and her family's Funtum Company. Sorry for that run-on sentence. Okay, the story is like this: The same horror that targeted Ciel back in the late 1880s desends upon Shiori, along with the same demonic savior, Sebastian. The current case involves a dangerous biological weapon, a terrible betrayal, and connections to the group/conspiracy/enemies that stole away Shiori's happiness. It is a good movie but not an outstanding one. I blame the casting. They SHOULD have gotten someone else to play Sebastian and also stayed true the REAL butlers hair style as depicted in the mangas, animes, and the live-action musical plays. In any case, If your a fan of the manga/anime then you'll want to get this. The only reason a true fan would hesitate to by this would be because of either lack of money or your not sure if your BLUERAY/DVD player can play this DVD. If its the former, just save up and get it later. You're already planning to get this, right. If its the latter then I can tell you that THIS dvd is region fine for America or to play on a player of the type sold in America.",1425427200,,1301,4.540425531914893
6474250,2,B00L8CIVZ0,"the fighting was really good but the subtitles was really really bad, a 5 year old could have done better, it didn't make any sense, totally ruined the movie for me, I still love the anime.",1424476800,4,189,4.277777777777778
6474251,5,B00L8CIVZ0,My granddaughter loved this gift.  She is a big fan and the movie was a unique gift for her.  Arrived as promised.  No complaints.,1423612800,,130,4.333333333333333

6474253,1,B00L8CIVZ0,"The subtitles may be in English but the grammar is horrid and makes it hard to read. Sometimes, it's even impossible to understand. Other times the subs are written over the Chinese (Malaysian?) subs so you can't even see them. The audio and video are also pretty poor. I'm was really disappointed. I love the anime/manga but I'm returning this.",1421107200,15,345,4.766666666666667
6474254,5,B00L8CIVZ0,"I am so happy that I bought this because I did get this movie on time and I love the anime series and this is just as same.

6474258,4,B00L8CIVZ0,"the was good ,as a critic the setting seems off perhaps it would have been better if it was so random like instead the future it was the far past, in the manga it mentioned that internet's relation to the Phantomhive was deep and mysterious that it even included Ciel's grandmother for undertaker had her hair on the chain Ciel took from him , now that would make for a great movie ,that would also give a chance to lengthen the cast and be for creative when it comes to personality of the characters , because  the cast choosen were all completely off on capturing the persona, because of this the movie it self with the random setting/ fashion/law and new characters loses collector's value because it's uncomfortable/incompatible to the anime or manga or it's merch",1417651200,,768,4.647058823529412

8664292,1,B00L8CIVZ0,"Barf-o-rama!! This movie is horrible. Not the absolutely worse remake but close. they changed the names of Ciel to something even harder to pronounce. They changed him from a guy to a female character. The storyline is no where in the original anime series. The dialogue is stilted, dry, boring. The only single absolute saving grace is the actor who played Sabastian. Still not as cute as the anime (sorry but that's my opinion) but his fighting style is really awesome. It's about as horrible bad as the live action adoption of Blood and Chocolate, in which everything was changed including the ending, only the names stayed the same. Don't buy this. Just watch it on Youtube if you have to. Otherwise stay away from this pile of ugh!",1471910400,,736,4.713178294573644

I was a disappointed when I saw that it wasn't the Ciel from the anime in the movie but the storyline, the action, the new main character, and Sebastian made up for it. Sebastian is portrayed beautifully in the movie. If you love the anime you will enjoy the movie.",1459209600,,382,4.175675675675675
