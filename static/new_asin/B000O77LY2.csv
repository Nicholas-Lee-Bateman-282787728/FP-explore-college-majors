2792082,5,B000O77LY2,"THE ALAMO is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time. THE ALAMO is one of our nation's greatest cinematic icons of ""Film Americana"" ever made. Through word, song and picture the legend of the Alamo was handed down and stills lives today. Men and women of different religious, ethnic and social backgrounds came together and died or lost loved ones at the Alamo in a noble effort to overcome tyranny and preserve basic human freedoms. John Wayne preserved that legend on film. John Wayne produced, directed and starred in this epic mixing nobility with bawdiness resulting in a reverence for the ideals of the defenders seen through their personal lives and conduct. The cast, script, production design and score added to the richly textured look and feel to the film. John Wayne is effective in his portrayal of Col. David Crockett. However, John Wayne takes a back seat to the brilliant performances of Laurence Harvey as Col. William Travis and Richard Widmark as Col. James Bowie as they feud and bicker over the virtues of military protocol vs. military expedience. Wayne in turn approaches the role of Crockett as the levelheaded onlooker who interjects this legend with passages of homespun witticism to keep the defenders from losing focus of their reason for being there. Cinematographer William Clothier's images are proud and majestic depicting the honor of the defenders. James Edward Grant's script is intelligent, energetic and moving. Equally energetic and moving is the eloquent and multi-textured score by Dimitri Tiomkin. Tiomkin's scoring of the final battle scene is brilliant and highly overlooked. Tiomkin integrates the nobility of the combatants with the fervor of the conflict and with simple queues he emotionally captures the falling of each defender in a brief moment of reflection as the battle rages on. His song ""The Green Leaves of Summer"" is beautiful, reflective and haunting and is effectively integrated into the context of why the defenders gave their lives. THE ALAMO thanks to John Wayne's determination and insight to what drives the American spirit.

I believe it is the nature of the THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN gunfighters, their motives for that one chance at gallantry and redemption. That combined with the way the story is visually told makes for its greatness. It teaches us something about nobility, dignity and devotion. The hearse-ride taken up to Boot Hill with Yul Brynner driving and Steve McQueen riding shotgun sets the stage and tone for the entire film. Images such as when Charles Bronson, is bent over with a bullet inside and the three little Mexican boys clutch him crying out his name while in his death throes bring a tear to the eye. In another the viewer reflects along with Yul Brynner as he takes the lifeless James Coburn's knife out of the adobe wall and folds it gently in his hand. These are heart rendering and indelible images. Even Eli Wallach as the bandit Calvera gets his moment of pathos. After being mortally wounded by Yul Brynner's bullet, Calvera can not believe that the seven came back to save the village even after the villagers told them that they did not want their help anymore. ""You came back. A man like you. Why?"" asks Calvera as he dies. Yul Brynner has no answer for him. It was as if Brynner had committed some sacrilege.

Director John Sturges captured the ambiguities of the human spirit in this film.
For me Yul Brynner was the epitome of `cool' and aplomb. From his dark gray and black outfit down to the tip of his thin cheroot he was the kind of man others look up to but keep their distance. Yul Brynner as Chris, was a man of few words and often communicated by the mere gesture of the hand. Of the seven, he was the cohesive element that drew them together simply by his demeanor. The aura of his worldliness beckoned them all to the place he was heading. He was just the first to recognize it. Brynner too was the cohesive element that kept them all together. Brynner was the one who followed some unwritten code of honor that is only alluded to in a few passages. McQueen was perfect as the gunfighter who was ""just drifting"" and signed on with Brynner. The levelheaded McQueen represents the other characters' realizations one by one as they join. James Coburn was perfect, as the stoic knife throwing Britt, who lived only for the thrill of the moment. Charles Bronson as O'Reilly played his stoically rugged but sympathetic role better than any actor could have. Bronson had a unique visual presence whose kind facial expressions counterbalanced his pockmark face and strong physique. Bronson was a conundrum unto himself and perfect for the role. Brad Dexter's performance as the unlucky fortune hunter has gone unrecognized. He was the least noble of the seven and died the mercenary to the end. Still, he gains our sympathy after returning in the clutch and saves his friend Chris and in turn is killed. Dying in the arms of his friend, Chris lets him go to the grave with a lie. Robert Vaughn's character was probably the most interesting of the seven. His enigmatic portrayal of Lee the tormented soul and not really the coward he labeled himself somehow never stood out. Only his act of redemption, his gun play and death during the finale lingers. Vaughn's portrayal is a success because as he said he was ""the coward hiding out in the middle of a battlefield"" and at that he succeeded. Horst Buchholz gave an energetic and bravura performance the only one of the seven that had not yet been corrupted by the world. At the end he symbolically hangs his guns up and roles up his sleeves. Brynner and McQueen say that ""only the farmers have won"" and they lost. As they ride off into screen immortality I think we all won.",1205539200,20,5734,4.785065590312815

2792111,4,B000O77LY2,"I ordered this set to acquire The Alamo, and that's the movie I'll review here.

The positives: the picture is pretty good and upscales nicely on a BluRay player, though I noticed a few artifacts on occasion. Sound is also very good. And, the entire movie is in widescreen.

Negatives: this is the cut version. Problem is, the cut version is all we have left after MGM accidentally destroyed the 70-mm used to produce the Director's Cut on laserdisc (which I owned at one point). The film has yet to see a BluRay release. I would like to see a BluRay release of the complete film. The bulk of the film could be remastered from the many parts that exist for the cut version, while the missing 30 minutes could be salvaged from the analogue laserdisc version. Sure, those 30 minutes wouldn't have the high res of the rest of the film, but what other option is there? I happen to own the complete Director's Cut on VHS tape. It includes the missing 30 minutes, and I can say without equivocation that those 30 minutes are extremely important to the tone and message of this movie. It is almost as if those cuts were made to change the message of the movie from being inclusive of numerous viewpoints to a simple action/adventure film.

I won't review the DVD of The Magnificent Seven here. It came up beautifully on BluRay and that's the version and format you should purchase.",1485388800,4,1374,4.532258064516129

=========================

THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN

Released in 1960 and directed by John Sturges, ""The Magnificent Seven"" is about a Mexican peasant village oppressed by a group of bandits, led by Calvera (Eli Wallach). The village leaders resort to hiring seven gunfighters from America to help defend their town. The seven gunmen are played by Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Horst Buchholz, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn and Brad Dexter.

Despite the contrived plot, based on Kurosawas Seven Samurai (1954), you cant beat the lusty score, the superlative locations and  the excellent main cast (the villagers, by contrast, are mostly weak). Unfortunately, the movies ruined by hokey script flaws. For instance (***MILD SPOILERS ENSUE***), Chico (Buchholz) is able to effortlessly infiltrate Calvera's bandits, utterly fooling them, even though there were only 32 of them by this point (rolling my eyes). Even if Calvera & his brigands failed to make out Chicos face, which is a big IF, his dialogue & accent wouldve given him away. Keep in mind that he was just an unseasoned teen.

Another prime example is the village leaders' sudden cowardly turnaround (i.e. betrayal), which totally contradicts their earlier resolve. Yes, I realize they learned that the bandits weren't run off and that they were going to return to the village out of desperation, but there were only like 30-32 bandits left at this juncture and the combined forces of the seven gunmen and the fighting villagers now had the opportunity to annihilate the thugs for good (***END SPOILERS***). The sad thing is that both of these script hitches couldve easily been fixed, but this kind of lame writing reflects too many Westerns before the 60s when the modern Western came to the fore with One-Eyed Jacks (1961), Hombre (1967) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969).

The film runs 128 minutes and was shot in Mexico and Old Tucson, Arizona.

GRADE: D+

=========================

THE ALAMO

Released in 1960 and produced/directed by John Wayne, ""The Alamo"" is a Western about the 1836 siege and fall of the famous Spanish mission-turned-fortress by Santa Anna's army of a couple thousand disciplined troops. The Alamo is defended by a ragtag assortment of roughly 200 soldiers, militia men and volunteers, including the famous frontiersman & politician Davy Crockett, loose cannon Jim Bowie and by-the-book militarist Colonel William Travis, the latter two regularly butting heads. Sam Houston (Richard Boone) is on hand as a significant peripheral character.

As early as 1945 it was Wayne's goal to film a picture about the Alamo and James Edward Grant was hired to write the screenplay, but Wayne and the president of Republic Pictures, Herbert Yates, clashed over the estimated high cost and the fact that Yates only wanted John to star in the movie, not produce & direct. Wayne left Republic over the feud while the studio took the script and released 1955's ""The Last Command,"" which I've never seen. Meanwhile, John started his own production company with Robert Fellows to forge ""The Alamo,"" which came out five years later and naturally shares many elements of ""The Last Command.""

The first two-thirds of ""The Alamo"" is a steady build-up culminating in the thrilling and utterly savage attack on the Alamo in the final act. The movie is surprisingly evenhanded with the events (considering it was 1960) and works despite inaccuracies, like the death of Bowie's wife, which actually took place a YEAR before Santa Anna's siege, not to mention the final assault, which took place in the dark of the pre-dawn hours. In the movie's defense, it does show the attack taking place at first light, which would make it only about 2-3 hours off from when it really happened. Wayne obviously made the decision to shoot in the daytime so viewers could actually SEE what was going on, rather than deal with the numerous negatives that come with shooting in the dark.

As far as the story goes, it's all about the characters because, if we don't care about the protagonists, the final assault falls flat, despite the awesome action. Thankfully, Wayne as Crockett, Richard Widmark as Bowie, and Laurence Harvey as William Travis deliver the goods, not to mention the script. All three are phenomenal in their own unique way. They're doomed to die, of course, but when their deaths occur they're both shocking and moving.

This version is just all-around more entertaining than the dreary 2004 version, although that rendition earns points for being way more realistic and giving Santa Anna considerable screen time, which this version doesn't do at all. Not to mention, the 2004 film ends with the humiliating defeat of Santa Anna & his army in a mere 18 minutes just six weeks after the fall of the Alamo. The rallying cry of Sam Houston & the Texian Army was naturally ""Remember the Alamo!"" Basically, Wayne filmed the Spirit of the Alamo with everything that goes with it, like big historical speeches, while the newer film tries for a more accurate telling.

But keep this in mind: No movie has ever been made, or will ever be made, about the Alamo that's thoroughly accurate, except for the obvious gist of things. Why? Because ALL of the defenders were killed. Even the Mexican eyewitnesses who were there disagreed on the major events that took place. For example, there are those who claim Davy Crockett was killed in the assault, as shown in this version, while others say he survived the battle along with 5-6 others only to be captured, lined up, and executed, as depicted in the 2004 film. So any movie you see about the Alamo is going to contain a lot of conjecture.

Dimitri Tiomkin's score is a dramatic, thrilling and tragic multifaceted piece that captures the slow build-up, eventual battle and aftermath. Carter Burwell's score for the 2004 version is mediocre by comparison; while certainly adept and adequate, it puts a dreary overcast over the proceedings.

The short version of the film, which is the only one I've seen, runs 161 minutes and was shot in Brackettville, Texas. The long version runs 40 minutes longer, but 10 minutes of that consists of (unnecessary) overture, intermission, and exit music, which leaves 30 minutes of deleted scenes. Naturally, some of these scenes help make sense of certain sequences in the shorter version, such as a fight in the church where the arms are discovered and the leader of the non-patriots is killed; that is, the man who tried to force Mexican beauty Flaca (Linda Crystal) to marry him. In the short version he just seems to disappear into thin air. Another scene that should've never been cut is the death of the Parson (Hank Worden) because it ties into the earlier conversation that Crockett had with him: When Flaca leaves and the Parson asks Davy if he ever prayed Crockett responds that he never had the time. In Parson's death scene Crockett takes the time. Another significant cut scene involves the birthday party of Captain Dickinson's daughter, which I've heard is moving.

Aside from Linda Crystal in the female department, Joan O'Brien appears as stunning blond Sue Dickinson, one of the surviving non-combatants who supplied one significant account of events inside the fort.
