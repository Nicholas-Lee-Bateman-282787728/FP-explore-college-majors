2397826,5,B000AYEL56,This DVD is great to either see for the first time or relive old memories.  A compilation of Super Bowls the Raiders have won with players  sharing some special moments.  A must for the die hard RAIDER FAN!,1178409600,,206,4.368421052631579
2397827,4,B000AYEL56,"Since many NFL fans are interested only in their favorite team and their victories, Warner Video has provided single volume, 2-disc sets for the 49ers, Cowboys, Steelers, Packers, Redskins and the Raiders.  Each of these teams have won, at least, 3 Super Bowl titles. So for the fans of these teams, they can have the video highlights of the NFL year that these teams played for their title and the review of the Super Bowl in which they were victorious.  However, all the highlights and special features were taken from the Warner's Super Bowl I-XXX Collection.  The Super Bowl highlights are the same footage NFL fans have seen on ESPN and previously produced volumes.  Consequently, there is no new video footage only a difference in focus and packaging.

Raiders fans who have already purchased the volume entitled the  Super Bowl XI-XX Collection need not purchase this particular product, since it contains the same footage, highlights and ""Special Features"" for Super Bowls XI, XV & XVIII in that one volume.  What's disappointing about the Collection series and the Super Bowl Champions sets are that the review of the season does not focus on the team season with a game by game review, but with an overall view of that NFL year.  In the case of the Raiders, this means this set contains highlights of the 1976, 1980 and 1983 NFL year and not each Raiders game of that year.  Presumably, this is done to set a context in which the Raiders had emerged into prominence.  Each NFL Year in review is approximately 23 minutes long and so is each Super Bowl review.  The ""Special Features"" section contains video features on the Raider Mystique, Ken Stabler, Jim Plunkett, Howie Long & Marcus Allen.  Since each one of these features are only about 5 minutes in duration, it keeps the serious Raiders fan wanting more.  Is this the intent by Warner Video?  What makes this set a must for Raiders fans is that it focuses on the Raiders victories.  Fans who need to keep their Raiders collection complete will find this product a delight.

His face is weather beaten, he wears a hood sache, with a silver hat upon his head and a bristleing black mustache. The Autumn Wind is a Raider Pillaging just for fun He will knock around and upside down and laugh when he's conquered and won.

8080817,5,B000AYEL56,"Of course being an NFL Films production it's going to be fantastic. It is, but the thing I loved was along with the actual Super Bowl game hilites, you first get a review of the NFL season of that Raiders' Super Bowl season. That means it's just not on the Raiders but a league overview. From this there are some classic snippets--Krazy George in Oilers' gear, visible trees behind game footage of Bert Jones at Memorial Stadium, a great mud game between the Skins and Cards, a snow game (Steelers-Bengals), Lions' players singing ""Another One Bites the Dust"" and Verne Lundquist doing Cowboys games.

The main focus is, obviously, on the Raiders and everything bar the Eagles' Super Bowl program is of great quality. For some reason the pic quality of that Uber Bore is very grainy with way too many overhead shots from the roof of the Superdome as well as too many clips explaining plays with a telestrator.

The DVD extras focus on the Raiders mystique and various players. The features on Jim Plunkett covers his entire career from NE to SF to the Raiders so you get some variety footage of the '70s there. The Marcus Allen extra to me was the hilite of the bunch--pure class and style.",1320451200,2,1190,4.6084905660377355

8080819,3,B000AYEL56,"This 2 DVD set was a real disappointment.  The Raiders, a team that I dearly love, may have had a few more seconds of coverage than any of the other teams that played football during the year of the Oakland Raider Super Bowl wins.  To make it short and to the point, this DVD set is not for the Oakland Raider fan.",1192665600,4,314,4.048387096774194
