8584198,4,B00CP0DKYQ,"The opera is not quite on the level of the best known  examples of Donizetti opera buffa, L'Elisir or Don Pasquale, but it has its charms, and the performances are expert.  Serra was a fine coloratura and the men are all practiced performers in this genre.  The production is apt and not overdone.  Not indispensable, but entertaining.",1399161600,4,335,4.824561403508772
