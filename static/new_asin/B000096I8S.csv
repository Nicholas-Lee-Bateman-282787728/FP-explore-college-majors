""Spiritual Guide to Weight Loss"" and ""The Joy of Weight Loss"" are a documentary program about five people who have lost weight with God's help, and through various means.  The DVD also contains additional food instruction, and a dance/movement segment.

I spent a lot of time and own money on this, and I know it will help you.

It is a motivational companion to my book, and many thousands of people tell me they watch and listen to it often.

8440534,2,B000096I8S,I very much like Mr. Chumley's book and philosophy on weight loss.  I thought the DVD would be an instructional companion to the book.  I was wrong.  It is a copy of his infomercial on his system.  I feel I was misled.,1141948800,4,218,4.119047619047619

8440537,5,B000096I8S,"This is no diet but a really easy change of lifestyle for the better.  I am so inspired by this I watch it all the time over and over.  Chumley is so nice and kind.  I never did ask Jesus to help me because I didn't think I was good enough, but I did and it worked and I don't feel bad about that.  This show is not about fast stuff, but simple and slow, easy does it.  I love it.  I Cant say enough good on this.",1065312000,26,413,3.6363636363636362
8440538,5,B000096I8S,"This program works.  No gimmicks.  I have followed Norris's advice for many years, and get his daily emails from his website ... and use the message posting board.  I lost 30 pounds and am keeping it off forever.  I have his book, Joy of Weight Loss, and now am happy he did this new one about food and simple movement.  Losing weight is a JOY, and I also found God to be very helpful, where nothing else worked before on me.",1059523200,36,425,4.197530864197531
