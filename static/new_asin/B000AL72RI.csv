I would HIGHLY recommend this movie to any one that isn't easily offended, because some of the people are just in a league all their own.  But anyway, I don't want to give the movie away because it is one of those things you have to see to believe.",1127433600,,423,4.25
2389417,5,B000AL72RI,"One of the craziest films Ive ever seen.  It really goes in depth into the world of mail order wives. There is a big twist at the end but I won't give that away.  The footage is very raw so if you're week at heart then you might want to think twice. Overall, a very entertaining film that I highly recommend to anyone intersted in documentary style films about controversial subjects. A must see!",1125532800,,396,4.337837837837838

2389431,1,B000AL72RI,"I got to the dinner party and now am writing this review.  This is disgusting and bottom drawer so called movie making.
Amazon, I am truly disappointed you would stoop to this level.  This is someone's story, probably many women's story, trusting they would have a better life, the having men take advantage of them.  That make this not dark humor, but everyone involved cashing in on women's plight in a country that is supposed to respect women as equals.... WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.  Really disappointed in Amazon.com",1492128000,,517,4.775280898876405

2389436,4,B000AL72RI,"I just finished this movie and like a lot of us, I thought it was real until I just haaad to dig deeper and pull it up online after she freaked out at dinner.

For the parts I watched without realizing it was a mockumentary - I thought was so sadistic. I was up on my bed cussing at that jackass until the filmmaker changed my entire aura changed. My spirits lifted a little while my eyes dripped of happy tears. Next thing you know I'm pissed again!

Once I found out it wasn't real I still enjoyed it as I give the film makers a pat on the back for dark humor. Not a lot of people go there and it didn't feel like it came from a true pervy perspective but rather a dude who's dad either left their mom for an 'international telatuonship' or studies this stuff. I feel both genders were powerful.

I recommend it. Hopefully you don't read these reviews until after the film though. Much better! ^_^

In Thailand the people never had a word for lie. Until the French, Americans, Germans, English, and then the Russians came to that country. In the early 1960's they started coming and today the young girls forced into prostitution  to help support their families are some of the best at scamming.

2389521,5,B000AL72RI,"This is the 2nd time this happened to me now.  I saw this movie, which is a piece of fiction, and the script and acting were SO GOOD, I thought I was watching a real documentary film.  (The first time this happened to me, but LESS so, was watching the first episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm that I ever saw, the one about Larry getting ready to do his own HBO, stand-up comedy special, which never materializes.)  This just seemed so realistic.

In fact, even now that I know it's a work of fiction, I STILL feel like I learned about one of those hidden little facets of American life, one of its strange subcultures, the world of mail-order brides.  (What do I know?  Maybe it's not really a strange subculture.  Maybe it bears no resemblance at all to how it was portrayed in this movie, but I doubt it.  After all, the central idea is that a First-World guy, after trading just a few letters with a Third-World woman, a woman who grew up in a VERY different culture, under very different material circumstances, agree to get married on the first day they actually meet, and then they do so.  That's GOT to be a strange scene.)

Anyway, I STILL feel like I just saw a documentary on the topic.  I'm very impressed.",1301702400,,1215,4.379464285714286
2389522,4,B000AL72RI,"I hated this movie from the very start, but I was also aware that it is a gifted piece of film making. If this were a romantic comedy (sort of what I was expecting), we would expect the separated lovers (Lichi and Andrew to finally get together, resolve their issues, and live happily ever after. I mean, how much more ""meet cute"" could anybody want than a mail order bride? No, wait -- someone ELSE's mail order bride?

The first part of the movie lives up to expectations. Lichi is more or less ""purchased"" through a legit service to marry Adrian, a working class slob who wants a wife to clean for him, shave him, act in his porn movies and (one would assume) sleep with him. When Lichi takes the humiliating tape to Andrew, he is horrified and invites her to live with him.

Well, any moviegoer knows what will happen next, and it does. But what we discover through the story as it progresses is that Andrew -- the upper class graduate of a film making school, working on what he hopes will be the documentary to make his career -- turns out to be as big a creep as Adrian. She ends up cleaning for him, as she did for Adrian; there's no doubt they are having sex, despite the fact that he has a serious girlfriend; and through things he does and says,shows himself to be a racist and, well . . . a pig.

Speaking of pigs, one of the funniest parts of the movie is when Lichi gets her first ""allowance"" from Andrew, who tells her to ""spend it on anything you want"", and shows off to him her purchases: dozens and dozens of pigs. None of them is real, of course, but the ""artistic"" representations of them are astounding. She has a name for each one of them, and knows what each of them does in life (e.g., ""This Earl Pig. He take care all the other pig."") There's also Ballerina Pig, Exercise Pig, Twin Pig, Baby Pig, and so on. Her husband responds to her with heavy sarcasm and in passing, reminds her (and us) that they are living in ""his"" house, not ""theirs;"" suggests she is ""crazy"" to want to live with so many pigs; and wants to limit her to 4 or 5 pigs at a time. He suggests the others be put in storage, to which Lichi responds, ""Pig no like storage."" Damn straight. She also reminds him that although he might not like all her pigs, she doesn't like all his porno tapes.

It's an involved, complicated story, and Lichi turns out to be, in a technically legal sense, the ""worst"" one of the three. But it doesn't take much to realize that of the three she is the sanest and the most sympathetic.

As I said at the beginning, I loved this movie from the beginning. It has a sense of whimsey and there are plenty of chuckles (if not belly-ripping roars) and it's a compelling story. But I also hated it, for good reason: if I had known at the beginning that each of these characters would turn out to be as unsympathetic  as they are, I never would have watched it. It's extremely difficult for a writer or film maker to get a reader/viewer on the side of ""the bad guy."" But this movie does that, at least if you watch it all the way through. It's a good lesson in judging books by their covers and how easy it is to demonize certain people not like you. So it's a good LESSON. It's enjoyable to watch, the first time, before you know what's coming. But what it is NOT is likeable. Tough for a movie to achieve all those things, but this one does.",1280448000,2,3358,4.2390625
2389523,5,B000AL72RI,"I wasn't paying that much attention to it when I began, I was fidgeting with my Blackberry and watching random scenes. 20 minutes into it, I told my friend I'll talk later because I have something interesting at hand. I didn't get up from my seat until the end of the film. Mind you, I was watching this in the living room on my laptop. And then began the most intriguing of storylines.

You will not believe what happens in the film if you haven't already seen it. It goes from one end to another. There is no party you feel like siding with. In certain characters, I saw myself. The film has shock value and eventually it's humorous, this is one of the most simple unique films you will ever see. When it ended, I wish there was more to watch.

This is one of the best documentaries you will ever see.",1262736000,,803,4.241830065359477

I know, I may be gullible but this is the only way to watch the film!  Now looking back I wonder how I could've been so gullible in thinking that everything I saw in the movie was true.

Of course, now that you are reading these reviews, you in fact know that this is a MOCKumentary.  But I invite you to buy the movie, tell everyone you know that this is a documentary and watch it with them... and watch their reactions!  It's priceless.

The movie is definitely one of those sleeper movies that not many people know about.  It is put together very well and keeps your interest throughout the whole movie.",1228694400,4,765,4.198630136986301
2389525,4,B000AL72RI,"Unlike most viewers, I have had some personal experience with this subject, so I knew right off the bat that it wasn't the real documentary it tries to sell itself as.  I didn't order my wife from a catalog, and we lived together for several years in her country before moving to the US to get married, but I know for a fact it isn't nearly that easy to bring a fianc&eacute; over from Asia!  The interviews, proof of real relationship, endless forms and background checks...it takes a lot of time and a lot of money, and isn't the casual thing portrayed here!

So after seriously suspending my disbelief at the unrealistic premise, I enjoyed ""Mail Order Wife"" much more than I was expecting to. In fact, everything about it was not what I was expecting.  Even knowing the nature of the film, it manages to keep you on your toes, give you that uncomfortable feeling of not knowing if you are supposed to laugh or be outraged, and then hitting you with scenes so funny you have to stop the DVD because you are laughing so hard.

The first portion of the film plays it totally straight.  A tubby and lonely doorman, Adrian, orders a wife, Lichi (brilliantly played by Eugenia Yuan, star of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Eye-2/dp/B0009W5KHW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Eye 2</a>), from a catalog.  The whole process is paid for by Andrew, a documentary film maker who gets a little too involved in the subjects.  Adrian treats Lichi like a maid and a porn star, and she finally escapes and runs to the rescue of Andrew.  Things seem to be going well, but Andrew is not the nice guy that he seems, nor is Lichi content to be the subservient housewife.  At this point, the whole story takes a turn to the ridiculous, and any trickery about this being a real documentary goes out the window.  That's when the movie gets really good.

Lichi is really the star of this show.  Eugenia Yuan is an amazing actress, who can effortless pull sympathetic tears or belly-busting guffaws from viewers.  To anyone who has seen the movie, all I have to say is ""pigs"" or ""baby"" to get you laughing again. The director and lead, Andrew, has apparently tried to balance his skills as a documentary filmmaker with his desire to have things turn out the way he would like to rather than the way they are.  A previous documentary of his, about Frat House hazing, was later discovered to be full of staged acts instead of the real thing.  With ""Mail Order Bride"" he gets to have the best of both worlds, while playing with the audience as well.

To those in the know, there are some major flaws in the film, like the above mentioned ease with which Adrian acquires Lichi, and the fact that even though she is supposed to be from Burma she speaks Chinese.  But that is going to happen to any movie when you know too much about the subject, and it is time to just shut off that part of your brain.

The DVD has some great extra features, included deleted scenes and audition tapes.  The deleted scenes are pretty funny, but it is easy to see why the director chose to take them out as they would give away the game too early.",1216339200,2,3149,4.60931899641577
2389526,4,B000AL72RI,"Like the others here, we thought it was a documentary, until half-way thru - Norman and I looked at each other and asked ""this isn't a documentary, is it? it's a 'movie,' right? like actors, a script.. you know...?""

There are funny moments, and sad. And, if it were true, which it is possible that this does go on, then sad for the girl of course. The price to pay to be able to come to the US.

But, she finds her voice and does stand up for herself. The pig collection scene is priceless. the ""I want baby!"" scene wild!

The main guy, Adrian, is a fat ugly pig, but, at first you think he might be an OK guy, but, soon find out, not so much. The second main guy, Andrew, not a lot better.

Lichi is wonderful. great acting.

This is an amusing, entertaining film. Very original. Not going to impact the world or be on my top 100 list, but, I liked it. So did my Norman. thanks, SS.",1210723200,,884,4.086705202312139
2389527,5,B000AL72RI,"When my mom asked if my friend and I wanted to watch this movie, we were rather taken aback... I mean, a film about a guy doing a documentary on a mail-order bride? I've read enough in the papers to be both appalled and curious... of course not all mail order brides are going to be put in terrible situations when they arrive, but there are plenty of stories about the women who are... I was curious and had to watch.

It was horribly appalling, my friend and I were shocked and horrified by much of the action... we found ourselves rooting for the poor girl even when it got to the point in the movie where it was obvious she wasn't totally the vulnerable victim anymore, that she'd become more adjusted to life in America and was starting to do things for herself. The depth of human depravity, our disgust for both the men in the movie - the first for his terrible treatment of his mail-order bride and the other for his confused attempts at heroism and then his demand for her eternal gratitude, we couldn't, didn't want to, believe this atrocity of human interaction... but we knew it was real.

Then, imagine!, our shock and surprise (and I know I'm not ruining this for anyone because other reviewers hve already revealed this)... it WASNT a documentary! The people were actors! As soon as the gag reel started, along with the credits, we were confused... and as it slowly dawned on us that we'd been had (my mom's laughter at our faces helped) we couldn't stop babbling about what a terrific movie it was.

Half the fun, honestly, was not knowing that it was a mockumentary and discovering that at the end... and I still need to buy this and play it for my friends who haven't even heard of this little-known movie. But either way, it's still a good movie, if only because it showcases - not just the story - but ourselves. Yes, my friend and I were appalled at the treatment of the girl in the movie... but we were also willing to believe that it was actually happening. It's the thrust of human nature, we believed it, were appalled by it... and couldn't stop watching it. And immediately wanted to share it with our friends...

If however you like movies that make you think, and that work with you on many levels, then you may enjoy this indie sleeper.

When you break it down, Mail Order Wife is the story of three lonely people.  All losers in some way whether by life, circumstance or simply character.

Adrian, the sad sack New York doorman, orders a mail order bride with the help of Andrew, a documentary film maker.  When Lichi arrives she is quickly exploited first by Adrian, then by Andrew.  Lichi who at first is vulnerable, quickly becomes and exploiter as well, though she may be forgiven given her circumstances.

This is a film where everyone is using everyone else, yet all seem oblivious to the fact of what they are doing.

What I did like about the movie is that you are never quite sure where it is going, and as it moved toward the climax I had no clue how it would end.

It is the morning after, and I am still thinking about this film.

Although the characters are not necessarily likeable,and their motivations are definitely not pure, any film that makes you think is a winner in my book.

Cheers!",1206057600,6,1247,4.421052631578948

At first I didn't even know it was a mockumentary, it was so convincing, but by the end of the movie I was beginning to suspect that it was probably a set up.

Although it does have some sex scenes which some viewers may find disturbing, and it does get a little slow - parts of which could be cut to make the run time a little less and it wouldn't affect the outcome, we really enjoyed this movie! As others have said, it really surprised me at how great of a movie it was. I'm hoping to order it soon!",1203638400,2,667,4.091603053435114

I was disgusted by the bride, groom and then later at the guy who was making the documentary. Until the very end when I learned it was a mockumentary I still was in disbelief. I think this film was gutsy to make based in fiction, but the point of the film is that it is so easy to see this as a work of non-fiction in todays depraved world. I want to show everyone this film, but I will tell them all it is a documentary so they get the same impact that I got out of it! Why is it that films this unique never make the mainstream?

2389533,5,B000AL72RI,"This movie is a classic example of how a great movie is not made by star power or cgi effects, but by a solid premise and splendid execution.

_Mail Order Wife_ is a movie about Andrew, a young and arrogant filmmaker, who decides he'd like to make a documentary about Adrian, an NYC boy who has decided to order himself a mail order bride.  An immediate problem is presented when Andrew helps pay for Lichi, the Burmese woman, and brings up a classic dilemma about moviemaking also addressed in great films like _Man Bits Dog_--Andrew is already showing signs of getting involved with his subject matter a little too subjectively.  This is reinforced after Lichi arrives and Adrian turns out to be much less than an ideal husband, and Andrew decides that he needs to rescue this woman from an awful situation.

This may sound like the premise of a light, romantic comedy, or a hackneyed Lifetime made-for-TV, but what I revealed so far is only the first 30 minutes of this 90-minute film, because things don't move along so easily, and that's because these characters aren't easily categorizable, which is also a sign of strong filmmaking.  Andrew has his own problems, with an inordinate sense of 'normalcy' and an arrogance streak that leaves him, in his own mind, justified in everything he does.  Adrian, though a twisted man, is somehow charmingly simple.  And Lichi isn't simply a quiet, victimized Asian girl, but one who has her own ulterior motives.

_Mail Order Wife_ is a comedy with dark undertones--there are wonderfully subtle moves, like how Andrew is always carrying his director's notebook even when involved in 'personal' conversations, and (you've seen it in the credits above) a surprising appearance by Jose Canseco, but these are also very troubling characters, played by unfamiliar actors to help make the mock-documentary motif seem all the more plausible.  The movie takes many unpredictable and sensible turns, that makes 90 minutes feel like a satisfyingly large glimpse into these people's lives.

I would highly recommend this film to many, and I relish in the fact that such a small budget can result in such a wonderful endeavor.",1156291200,15,2160,4.941988950276243

The storyline is so audacious that I often found my mouth hanging open in disbelief.  I was totally engaged by the story and the offbeat characters, and I too thought I was watching a documentary until the closing credits revealed that it was a totally fictional experience.

Its about a guy doing a documentary on the process of another man ordering a wife from a foreign country. The husband to be is a slob, rude, and has pretty much no friends, which is equal to his love life...or lack thereof. the guy documenting this offers to pay for the wife and her plane ticket. when she gets over, she can speak very little english, but fulfills her wife dities like a stepford wife. as the filming goes on, the ordered wife tells the filmer that her husband ties her up and takes pictures of her for the internet, and other disgusting things that she doesn't want to do. at this point, the documenter and the ordered wife have a close bond that is a little more than freindly. they have a little something, and hey try to get seperated from the husband.

she ends up playing them both and goes back to her country where she appears on another Mail Order Wife website/company.

Its confusing because i'm still not sure if this was a real documentary that went array, or a film with a script and a little improv.

That's another thing about this film, it goes where a Hollywood film would fear to go without comic relief immediately diffusing the drama while still containing drama and lines that aren't exactly punchlines, but they come off hilariously anyway.  Kudos to the filmmakers who truly have created one of the best independant films in that past few years. To let those who want to know a little more about this film, it's shot in a mock-documentary style so you get the feel that you're actually watching the material shot by the fictional documentary filmmaker in the film.

2389550,5,B000AL72RI,"If you're reading these reviews, your experience will be different than mine -- I saw the DVD without any preconceptions (other than it was in my list of recommended films to see).  At first, I accepted the film's premise that it's a documentary about ""Lichi,"" a mail-order bride from a poor 3rd world country (in this case, Burma) and Adrian, an overweight, lonely NYC doorman who orders her from a catalog.  Adrian initially appears to be a bit ignorant and unattractive, but an earnest, hard-working and decent guy.  However, after Lichi's arrival and quick marriage to him, events take a subtly dark and increasingly-abusive turn.  At several points, I wondered if some scenes, events and dialog weren't a bit staged -- would people really act out so openly in front of a camera crew?  More implausibilities kept cropping up, from minor details (i.e. why does Lichi -- a supposedly poorly-educated, destitute girl from rural Burma -- speak fluent Chinese in Chinatown?) to major plot issues (the build-up to a Jerry Springer-like finale).  Early on, I began to wonder how a theatre audience would react: women likely would howl over the overt exploitation, and human beings with a heart would recoil at the growing manipulation and opportunism, perversity, and heartache.  The film reeled me in and hooked me quite effectively: the unknown degree of truth kept me engrossed -- laughing, cringing, and wondering could this be at all true?

This movie states some very important issues. As anyone who has seen the fallout of what happened when the US Government decided to close down Clarke Air Force base, near Manila in the Phillipines can attest, this happens all too often. Coming from a circumstance of lesser fortune and desiring a better life isn't what the institution of marriage is about in the first place, but this movie illustrates how these sharks from other countries are preying on naive European-American men looking for love. This movie does well to illustrate just that, as the lead character turns to a Mail Order service in order to satisfy the void that dating has left in his life. It appears that he is just naive enough to believe that these women from Asian countries are looking for the same thing, namely, an interpersonal relationship when in reality they are looking to get out of their 3rd World countries where, in most cases they stay in poverty and enter the sex industry.

2389596,5,B000AL72RI,"Ok, only one word can describe this movie...Great!  My friend told me how funny this movie was, but I didn't really believe him until I watched it for myself.  I loved that part where the old guy ends up taking the girl back to a motel instead of gowing through with the original plan.  That was an awesome twist.  I could not stop laughing.",1129507200,,341,4.28125
2389597,5,B000AL72RI,"I don't think that I've ever laughed as hard as I did when I watched this movie.  I saw it when it was out in theaters, so I bought it the other day.  The plot is just out of this world wrong.  I think that's why it's so hillarious.  The fact that it's both disturbing and funny at the same time makes it one of my favorite movies.  And let's talk about the girl and her fascination with pigs.  I think someone else in here mentioned it in his review, too.  I agree...that moment was classic.  It was the most ridiculous thing.  I'm glad that there are still movie makers with twisted minds like Andrew Gurland.",1129161600,,611,4.198275862068965
2389598,5,B000AL72RI,"I liked this movie for so many reasons.  But the best thing about it is that it had me laughing for like 10 minutes straight.  This is probably the best comedy I've ever seen!  I rented the movie the other night without really knowing what it was all about.  And I was pleasantly surprised.  I knew that it was a comedy, but I didn't know it was going to be this funny.",1129161600,,369,4.069444444444445

When I was watching this, I did not know that it was a mockumentary.  And it's a good thing that I didn't, because it makes for  a nice surprising ending.  To all the people out there who already know that this movie is not a documentary, i suggest you watch it anyway.  It is still probably one of the best comedies you'll ever see.",1128556800,,467,4.25

2389602,5,B000AL72RI,I could not stop laughing when I watched this.  The characters are so amazingly original.  The main character is probably the biggest loser in the world.  Whoever came up for the idea of this movie should have been nominated for something.  And when the girl started decorating the house with all those pigs...that was classic!,1128556800,,327,4.890909090909091

The characters in this movie are so unbeliveably dumb...I could not stop laughing!,1128556800,,311,4.618181818181818
2389604,5,B000AL72RI,"WARNING: To all lonely and single American males who maybe considering sending for a mail order wife from the Orient. See this film before you do.

This is a surprisingly good and very insightful film in the disguise of a documentary about Adrian, a lonely doorman (Adrian Martinez) from Queens, New York who gets involved in an overseas correspondence with Lichi, (Eugenia Yuan) a pretty young girl from Burma. She agrees to marry him and he pays the fees to fly her to America. He ends up treating her badly and she escapes into the arms of Andrew (Andrew Gurland) who happens to be filming their relationship.

However their relationship also quickly falls apart as their maritial and relational expectations for each other go misunderstood and unfulfilled.

Wonderful examination of two nice people who really seemed to love each other, but simply didn't have the understanding or communication skills to work out their cultural differences. This may not have been a real documentary, but its message sure comes across as one. Highly recommended!",1128470400,4,1050,5.057803468208093
2389605,5,B000AL72RI,This is a great movie.  It's one of my favorite movies of all time in fact.  It may not have any special effects like every other big budget blockbuster out there.  But I think that this movie captures human emotion so much better than any big budget film.  I think Andrew Gurland should have been honored in some way for making such an amazing movie.,1127952000,,351,4.3538461538461535

I loved disturbingly funny movies.  And the fact that they trick you into thinking that it's a real documentary makes it even better.  I didn't figure out that it was a mockumentary until I saw the credits.  I was totally shocked...but in a good way.  It was so convincing.

The ""documentary"" goes on to demonstrate that both the original ""husband"" and the film maker are simply exploiting and further brutalizing a young person who had already reportedly had a difficult life in her native country.  Such brutalization is the primary reason that ""being alone"" is far preferable to engaging with American trained thugs of both genders and for that matter with advertised wannabes of the felony theft divorce racketeering industry whether via ""dating sites"" or ""mail order brides"" or otherwise arranged by the felony tax evading, slave mongering, hate mongering against male citizens, war mongering for purposes of ""sacrificing"" yet more male lives in foreign wars created for the purpose, male baby raping, belligerent blaspheming ""religion"" gang ""churches"".",1494028800,,898,5.4071428571428575

The Dr. at the gynecological clinic was something out of the male-dominant, ask-no questions 50's.  The film-maker's mom--every momma's-boy protector; 'no one is good enough for my son' is a graceful condescension expert.  All believable people.  Hook, line and sinker, I fell for.
