8701789,4,B00THR9L9I,"Another gem out of Pat Cascio's archive released by Paladin. It is about 30 minutes of very succinct and useful instruction on three point shooting techniques. The techniques are very simple and easy to learn. This is of course the point, and despite the low res VHS source tape, the instruction is crystal clear. Col. Applegate adds some comments making this a great addition to the library of anyone interested in close combat techniques. It is extremely inexpensive, and gives good techniques to practice. If you are a fan of the late Col. Applegate, I will throw in another tip for you. Go to archive.org and type in https://ia802706.us.archive.org/22/items/MobAndRiotControl/MobAndRiotControl.m4v. This is a film produced by Charles Cahill and Associated titled Mob and Riot Control. Applegate was a technical advisor and had a cameo appearance in the film as well.",1436227200,3,870,5.266187050359712
