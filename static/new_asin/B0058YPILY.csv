4604956,5,B0058YPILY,"I really like this season of Criminal Minds. All of the episodes have good storylines,writing,etc. I also like the fact that at times in each episode we get to see that the characters are human and have feelings just like the rest of us. I am very pleased with my purchase. Again Thank you for asking.

4604957,5,B0058YPILY,"This episode was another good one. The episode had a really good story and then I like the fact that we get to see that Agent Prentiss is human because she is still dealing with what happened with Doyle. I think that this episode is one I really liked. I am pleased with this purchase. Thank you for asking.

4604959,5,B0058YPILY,"Criminal minds is heavy on the minds.  It may be ""the show"" for intellectuals, but it is high in suspense, even when they let you in on the culprit early in the show.  It may take some twists and turns, but the closeness of the characters and how they make up a family is one of the features that makes this so-called horror show so endearing.  I highly recommmend it.",1331596800,,368,4.228571428571429
4604960,5,B0058YPILY,"This story intrigued me with the condition the main character had, that caused him to see people known to him previously, as strangers now.  The fact that he would recognize someone by voice, if unseen, was a tricky detail with his wife and daughter.  I was prepared to grab the daughter when she rushed in the door to see her father toward the end.  The whole program kept growing in intensity to the bitter end.",1330560000,,413,4.48
4604961,4,B0058YPILY,"This was an interesting story, partially told by the man who was running his video recorder.  Initially I was confused with the red dot showing up on the screen, and then I realized what was happening.  The writers keep coming up with more and more twists of main characters, but the BAU team does their job well!",1330560000,,313,4.473684210526316
4604962,5,B0058YPILY,"Serial killers, rapists, psychopaths, and kidnappers are no match for the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU). CBS captivates viewers of Criminal Minds by putting an original spin on the generic police procedural television program. Criminal Minds premiered September of 2005 and is now on its seventh season. The series follows a team of FBI profilers from the Behavioral Analysis Unit (BAU) based in Quantico, Virginia. Criminal Minds differs from other procedural drams by focusing on the criminal versus the crime itself.
Jason Gideon (Mandy Patinkin) and Aaron Hotchner (Thomas Gibson) initially lead the Behavioral Analysis Unit. In the first season the team is composed of Elle Greenaway (Lola Glaudini), Derek Morgan (Shermar Moore), Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler), Jennifer ""JJ"" Jareau (AJ Cook), and Penelope Garcia (Kirsten Vagsness). During the second season, Greenaway left and was replaced by Emily Prentiss
(Paget Brewster). At the start of the third season, Gideon departs and is later replaces by David Rossi (Joe Mantegna). While the main team sees several personnel changes, their success isn't affected.
Each character brings something original and vital to the BAU team.  The team leaders Hotchner and Rossi bring experience and assertive attitudes to run the team. Aaron ""Hotch"" Hotchner, formerly a prosecutor, leads the team with confidence and experience. Hotch struggles to balance the demands of the FBI with his personal life, son Jack and wife Hayley.  David Rossi is a Senior Supervisory Special Agent who worked in the BAU during its early years.  Rossi is a highly experienced special agent that brings the old-school vibe to the group.
Derek Morgan is confident, assertive, and often a hot head.  Morgan was a troubled child during his youth and was molested by his childhood mentor.  Penelope Garcia is the team's technical analyst.  She joined the BAU after bringing attention upon he self by illegally accessing their equipment.  She took the job in lieu of jail.  Morgan and Garcia engage in highly-sexual banter and add humor to the team's strenuous job. Emily Prentiss is the daughter of an Ambassador.  Prentiss is fluent in several languages and has lived all over the world.
Dr. Spencer Reid is the youngest member of the BAU team.  He graduated from high school at age 12 and holds PhDs in Mathematics, Chemistry, and Engineering as wells as Bas in Psychology and Sociology.  He continues to work on a BA in Philosophy.  Reid has an IQ of 187, can read 20,000 words per minute, and has an eidetic memory.  Most of the team is intimidates by his profound knowledge and he is always read to offer some statistic.  Reid's mother suffers from schizophrenia and is currently in a mental institution.  Reid has mild Asperger's Syndrome.
Jennifer ""JJ"" Jareau is the maternal figure of the team.  She acts as the Media Liaison for the team and selects the cases for the team to work. As Hotchner once said, ""No one on the team is replaceable.""  The BAU is so successful because of the perfect balance of the team members.  Jeff Davis created the characters to ensure the variety of personality types and life experience.
Each episode begins and concludes with a quote by an influential figure.  The quotes establish a little context for what will be happening and also summarize the episode. From a viewer's standpoint, the quotes not only apply to the episodes but are usually applicable to daily life. This connection between viewer and television help establish a personal viewing experience. By doing this, the audience feels more emotionally connected to the victims and the members of the BAU.
Serial rapists and pedophiles pull on the heart strings of the audience by pinpointing several emotions: empathy, anticipation, and pure fear. Jeff Davis, creator and producer of season one, is in the early stage of his career. Besides creating Criminal Minds, Davis has created, directed, and produced the new MTV show, Teen Wolf, a teen romance about werewolves.  The sappy show is very similar to the hit movie series Twilight: poor writing and even worse acting.  After seeing his work with Criminal Minds, Teen Wolf is a downgrade.
 The dark and disturbing content might be a little discomforting for certain audiences.  The graphic content and scenes seem a little over the top but it's scary to think that these ideas had to evolve from something.  Watching an episode of Criminal Minds is both exciting and annoying.  The thrill from watching the BAU kick ass can be over-ridden by the disturbing crimes.  However, this is what keeps viewers coming back for more.  There isn't any criminal the BAU can't take down, so far...",1329264000,2,4676,5.0625814863103
4604963,4,B0058YPILY,"I was one of those who mostly gave up on the show last season, but once they brought JJ and Emily back, I decided to give it another shot, which has been an A++ TV watching decision.

The basics of this episode: several bodies are discovered in a lake, and when the team goes to investigate, they find an unsub who is spiraling rapidly downwards. This episode delves into faith vs. myth, and the resolution has repercussions that tie back into the main characters lives (particularly Rossi's).

Overall, another strong episode in a string of them this season.",1320710400,,559,4.6938775510204085

4605051,2,B0058YPILY,"Is there any way to tell if these are being sold in the original slim cases or the reboxed single case? I was hoping for the slims so they'd match the other seasons I own, but nope. The cover is also mangled and wrinked like the paper got wet and the latch side of the box looks broken.
I'm REALLY getting tired of ordering dvds - new from Amazon directly - and having no idea what actual condition it'll arrive in. I expect new merch to arrive in NEW condition. No broken boxes. No mangled covers. No scratches on the discs. At this point I might as well pay more for used at a local shop and be able to inspect the set before I buy.

As for the season, I waited to buy season 7 because I wasn't very fond of where the writing went at that point. I bought this to fill in my collection and little else. ...And now it looks like I may be returning anyway in order to look for the right cases as well as a set that isn't mangled.",1484265600,,928,3.989247311827957

4605160,5,B0058YPILY,Great series! great series! Love this series!  Although definitely not kid friendly it is a great adult treat. The main characters are super engaging and you find you can get really emotionally invested. The writers and producers are genius and make each episode its own story. You can easily walk into the series at any point and get enough content information to know what is going on and not feel completely lost. The BAU team are thoroughly entertaining and their character plots are quite thought provoking. The content can be graphic at times but not over the top. There are multiple story lines going simultaneously but it's done eloquently so you get just enough critical detail to remember from episode to episode. When applicable they give review segments before the episode so viewers can get caught up on crucial details from previous episodes that are relevant to what you are about to watch further deepening your understanding of the narrative. You leave each episode emotional and excited about what is going to happen next. It's easy to get wrapped up in the mind and workings of the BAU. I love that the focus isn't targeted exclusively at the murderers but rather the development of the profile and thought process of the information analysis as well as relationship between main characters. It's engaging and thought provoking. I can't wait to watch more!,1458000000,,1375,4.9523809523809526

4605810,5,B0058YPILY,"As with my whole seven acquisitions of the series, the DVD's arrived on time, well packaged and in excellent conditions. I do recommend all seasons to those who have a special interest in viewing--without commercials--criminal stories well written, well orchestrated, and with a superb cast of actors, directors and extras. I will definitely acquire the whole series through Amazon. I must also add that I have been for years a fan of British detective stories and spy novels. But these criminal stories have a particular interest: the methodology by which potential criminals are investigated, persecuted and submitted to justice or their fate: What the BAU from the FBI calls ""profiling,"" which means submitting background information and behavioral data to a rigorous analysis before moving on to persecute those suspected of violent or otherwise inhumane acts against fellow human beings. Its just the way the investigations go throughout the seven season so far seen on the screen. Profiling might just be an excellent tool for securing a broader knowledge of the human condition and for understanding individual behaviour.",1405123200,,1128,5.378531073446328

4605863,5,B0058YPILY,"I feel Criminal Minds is one of the best shows on television.  I look forward to watching each episode.  Prentiss' return at the start of the season was great, but the finale left me somewhat sad knowing who was leaving.  All in all I enjoyed every episode.  I'm now watching season 8 & enjoying it very much.",1400976000,,309,4.368421052631579
4605864,5,B0058YPILY,"There's a tendency among us TV fans (me included!) to wax nostalgic about a long-running series' earliest seasons and lament how the show inevitably declines in quality with every year it remains on TV. Much to my very happy surprise, though, the seventh season of Criminal Minds turned out to be one of my all-time favorites. There's a certain energy, emotion and vibrancy that was, for me, lacking in the previous couple of seasons. The cases are especially compelling and have a psychological complexity to them that means they'll stick with you long after you've watched them. There's a little more bonding among the team members, and we actually get to see Hotch smile on a regular basis again for the first time since somewhere around Season 2! The set features an amusing blooper reel that I've watched more than is normal :) I very, very highly recommend this season!",1400544000,,875,4.84

4605866,5,B0058YPILY,"From the action-packed ""It Takes a Village"" to the riveting, explosive, yet tear-jerking ending of ""Hit/Run,"" history was made for the series during the 7th season.

One of the main focal points of the series is the evolution of Reid... we start to see him as an adult, with emotions - someone that is able to get angry - not just a human robot with a photographic memory.

For the long-standing fans of Paget Brewster as Emily Prentiss, her departure could not have been more eloquently filmed.

Tricia Helfer took evil to a shuddering new level during her performance as unsub ""Lady X/Queen of Diamonds.""

It is a reminder that evil lurks in plain view.",1400025600,,655,4.6695652173913045
4605887,5,B0058YPILY,"My only complaint is I wish the actors would just stick to acting and not Directing, it gives them less screen time and takes away from the show.",1399075200,,145,4.214285714285714
4605888,4,B0058YPILY,"I originally bought this season to see (and keep!) the wedding of JJ & Will (D6/Ep3, 2-hr. episode called ""Hit/Run"".) I don't like most of it because there's a lot of sadistic violence; however, other things redeem that, like the superlative acting [of course!]. Others I like [by title only] -- ""It Takes a Village;"" ""From Childhood's Hour;"" ""Hope;"" ""Self-Fulfilling Prophecy;"" ""Unknown Subject;"" ""Foundation;"" ""The Company;"" ""Divining Rod.""  Since you know how much I hate gratuitous violence, gore, and too much emphasis put on horrible UnSubs, perhaps you can guess that most people will like Season 7 very well.  But it's the last one I'll buy for myself until ""Criminal Minds"" focuses more on profiling and less on the gory criminal.  Betty L. Willard.",1397347200,,758,5.096774193548387

This season follows several sub-plots, including the Replicator, which will absolutely blow your mind!!  It's a dark dark show, but with good character development and storylines.

I told my wife that, and she said, ""Really? I don't get that."" Of course, she doesn't like ""Raising Arizona"" or most Coen Brothers films, and so I know better than to discuss the relative artistic value of film and television with her.

4606166,5,B0058YPILY,"I still miss Gideon, but Rossi has grown on me.  It helps that in this season, his character's generosity is explored further.  Honestly, I look forward to CM being available on Amazon prime.  For the entire 7th season, we ended up buying all 23 episodes at $1.99 each - so yes, it was a little pricey but that was the only way we could afford it (we watched it over a span of 2 months), instead of paying $40+ off the bat, for a season that we may end up not enjoying.

Enjoy it, we did!  Each episode is so well written, with enough nerdy material, humor, suspense and tragedy.  Some material is disturbing, especially if you picture it happening to yourself and your family.  But as they say, it is better to be aware of how random crime and people can be, rather than be gullible.

Thumbs up to the screenwriters, producers, directors and cast!  Loved it and recommend it.",1377561600,,876,4.391304347826087

Unfortunately, I waited too long to get to this particular season because I wanted to watch the first 6. When I got to season 7, the disks and packaging looked authentic; however, the quality looks like someone copied them from vhs tapes. All other seasons look as good as Blu-ray and they are only standard dvd. So when you buy something from one of these other sellers here on Amazon make sure you test the quality of all dvds. This is happening everywhere. I had the same problem on ebay. You can't trust anyone these days, it seems like. I should have purchased from trusted Amazon seller.

4606220,3,B0058YPILY,"What is with the bleeched teeth. What is wrong with the natural color of teeth? All the actors have teeth so white they look cartoonish. When they show a drug addict, homeless person or prostitute they all have bleeched white teeth. As a matter of fact the show loses it's serious nature when every single actor looks like a clown every time you see their teeth. I am all for clean bright teeth but not when they look cartoonish and are the color of a bright toilet bowl. Also, they need to ease up a bit on the makeup. I own seasons 1 to 7. Many episodes are fantastic. Some episodes are unrealistic. I think i may throw in the towel and look elsewhere for future crime drama.

By season seven, the show's starting to run out of steam in our opinion; the episodes have taken on a sameness. They're still enjoyable, but how many times can you see the same thing happen? The Emily Prentiss story line is compelling, and the last episode is masterful. I only wish that the show's creators had decided to wrap things up after season 6; the Prentiss story line could have been introduced early, and the wonderful last episode could still have been done. By contrast, the creators of ""Flashpoint"" had the good sense to end after five great seasons.",1366070400,,686,4.773109243697479

But Criminal Minds shows another award-winning season with this DVD release! Absolutely the best crime drama on TV, hands down! I liked the extras on the DVD, showing how some shows went from concept to creation, and the gag reel!

4606693,4,B0058YPILY,"I find it difficult to believe that there are so many quality television shows on the air these days. For so long it felt like there was nothing to watch. Now I find myself torn between shows appearing on opposing channels at the same time or find the DVR overloaded with shows I've missed. This is one of the reasons that shows being released on DVD at somewhat affordable prices are doing so well right now. And one show that continues to remain a quality series is CRIMINAL MINDS.

For those who have never seen the series (or who missed when I've spoken of previous seasons) the show revolves around a group of FBI profilers who are sent around the country to help law enforcement agencies apprehend serial criminals. Some cases involve rape, others arson but for the most part they seek out serial killers. The statistic that at any one time there are up to 80 serial killers walking around at one time is scary. The thought that there is actually a group like this seeking them out should help you sleep at night.

There isn't one single character that stands out among this ensemble piece but while the focus may change from one to another with each episode Thomas Gibson as Agent Aaron Hotchner is the focal point. The leader of the team has gone through some serious problems in the past (one serial killer murdered his wife for revenge) and this year we witness him adapting to being a single parent. But while Hotchner's life is seen so are the lives of the other cast members. And the series opens with the effects of what happened at the end of season 6 when the group thought agent Emily Prentiss (Paget Brewster) was killed.

Agent Derek Morgan (Shemar Moore) has been using his own time to seek out the killer responsible for Prentiss' death unofficially. When the group is called before a hearing concerning their activities only one person can clear them: Agent Prentiss. As we saw (though the group didn't know) she was still alive. Now as the season progresses we watch as each member of the team must deal with the return of someone they held dear who was unable to let them know she was fine. While they still work together and are closer than most working groups, a certain amount of distrust is the residue left over from this secret and something that must be roughed out as the season progresses.

In the meantime there are plenty of criminals still out there that the BAU (Behavioral Analysis Unit) must help catch. Kidnapping with ties to the 80s, a copycat killer imitating a case Hotchner and Rossi (Joe Mantegna) worked on years ago, a 9 year olds abduction, murder at a military boy's school and more form the cases the group works on. Each one calls for various members of the group to put their personal skills to the test and find the guilty party before more damage can be done.

While the search for criminals continues the personal lives of the group come into play as well. Not only do they have to deal with the return of Prentiss, they are also still dealing with the return of JJ (A.J. Cook) who left the team in season 6. Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler) continues to deal with the mental problems he fears he inherited from his mother. Morgan finds himself involved in a case where the missing cousin discussed in another season may have re-appeared. And Garcia (Kirsten Vangsness) finds herself in a romantic situation.

Watching this series from the beginning you begin to identify with the characters involved. They begin to feel like family. You find yourself caring for each and every one of them. It doesn't seem like these are merely characters on the screen but friends you've grown comfortable with while watching. That's the secret of a great ensemble cast and CRIMINAL MINDS has developed one of the best ensemble casts ever assembled. The talent of each actor pours from the screen and not one is left to the side and not given some personal chance to prove their mettle here.

If you're a fan of the series you'll want to make sure you add this season to your collection. If you're not a fan, then by all means start collecting from the beginning and work your way to this one. I've picked them all up and have found that they are never boring to go back and watch again. This series is one that gets better was it moves forward and should satisfy the most jaded mystery fan.",1350345600,11,4338,4.560975609756097

I was hoping it wasn't a typo, but we do get two episodes with commentary.  Weirdly, ""It Takes a Village"" and ""Hit/Run"" I sure would have gotten a commentary, but alas, no.  And I do wanna say that most (if not, all) of the special features of subtitled, too.  Which, is always a plus.  Good job, CBS DVD!

4606917,5,B0058YPILY,"I have watched Criminal Minds since it 1st aired in Sept. of 2005. I have also purchased every season DVD boxset, as well. It has become 1 of my all-time favorite shows-a show that I can watch episodes of multiple times & enjoy them as much as, if not more each time. When Season 6 aired, I wasn't all that impressed. When it came out on disc, I hoped that I would enjoy them on their 2nd viewing a bit more. Again, I was a bit dissapointed in that season.
However, Season 7 was amazing-the show went back to being the intense, original, well-written, plot-driven program that I had loved since the start. Some of the stand -out episodes for me are ""True Genius"", ""There's No Place Like Home"", ""Profiling 101"", ""Snake Eyes"", ""Proof"", & ""Hit/Run"". I will miss Emily Prentiss, as she has been my favorite character on the show since she started in Season 2! When pre=ordering this, I made sure that it would be delivered on the Tuesday of release (Sept. 4th). I cannot wait to relive what is, in my humble opinion, 1 of the show's most original, disturbing, & entertaining seasons. 23 engrossing episodes await me on 6 discs come Tuesday!",1346544000,8,1136,4.519417475728155

I really liked the flashbacks and also I thought that the fact they were teaching students about Criminal Profiling was a good story.

4606973,5,B0058YPILY,Love criminal minds. Season's end was good. Eventhough was expecting a bigger cliff hanger. Leaving us dedicated fans waiting for new season. Bitter sweet to see Prentice leave. Hopefully she will return in future.,1338768000,,214,5.323529411764706
4606974,5,B0058YPILY,"I love this show. It's just something about it, which keeps me tuning in every Wednesday night for a brand new episode. Due to the subject at hand it's NOT the show for everybody, but if you are a fan of psychological thriller's this is the show for you.

""Criminal Minds"" will challenge your mind every episode. It shows what it is like to get into the mind of serial killers, and with every episode we get drama, mystery, and action. These cases are twisted and eerie, and most of the time what you think is going happen, doesn't. Every show literally has me on the edge of my seat.

Pros: 1. The writing is superb
2. Every character is well defined
3. Great acting
4. Compelling cases

Cons: 1. There is none really, unless you count the season ending cliffhanger.

I won't be giving away any spoilers for those who haven't seen it, but ""criminal minds"" isn't like any other show on television. I highly recommend it, you will not be disappointed.",1337212800,35,950,4.473988439306359
4606975,5,B0058YPILY,"""Criminal Minds"" returned for its seventh season in 2011-2012, with a fresh set of disturbing and violent crimes to be solved by the FBI's elite Bahavorial Analysis Unit (BAU) and its ecclectic collection of agents.  A highlight of the season was the return of profiler Emily Prentiss ""from the dead"", with emotional ramifications for the whole team.

The show continues to thrive on its crime-of-the-week format, as the BAU races the clock to identify and stop a violent killer or killers while saving victims.  Clever plots continue to take unusual twists and turns.  As in past seasons, the spotlight shifts from episode to episode among the actors in an outstanding ensemble cast, giving each a chance to lead on a case.  This season has featured increased insight into the personal lives of the characters.  One member of the team gets a girlfriend, another gets a marriage proposal, a third is haunted by an old case, and a fourth decides to leave the BAU.  A senior supervisor goes to pieces on the job.  The extended season-ending cliffhanger will have long-time fans on the edges of their seats, as the whole team is put in danger during a violent hostage standoff during a bank robbery.

The Seventh Season of ""Criminal Minds"" is highly recommended to its fans for its consistent delivery of solid, scary stories and good to excellent acting by its cast.",1337126400,63,1364,4.87012987012987

4606978,3,B0058YPILY,"As far as Criminal Minds episodes and season premieres go, this one rates pretty low. Sure, it brought back Emily Prentiss from the ""dead"", something which they'd already revealed at the end of season six, but the whole format of flashback interspersed with a hearing was a tired old format that made the whole episode transparent and boring.

It starts off with a rooftop fight and suddenly the unsub turns around and it's Ian Doyle. Hotch is out in Pakistan on temporary task force duty but apparently it's unimportant enough for him to just hop on a plane at the drop of a hat to come back home to investigate Doyle. Early on, they offer the teasing statement that ""two of your agents are dead"", but they quickly shake that off when you find out it's two random agents you've never seen or heard of before. JJ is back and suddenly she's gone from media mouth to field agent.

They chase some unknown baddies connected to Doyle and some silly scene at a plane happens and ends with a weak climax. Of course, the outcome is predictable and although an oath is used at the end for dramatic flair, it came off as Hollywood cheese and really disappointed me. It's starting to feel like this show is turning in the direction of SVU, which is honestly quite sad.",1336003200,2,1258,4.5131578947368425

Profiling is the best one though I am tired of seeing Rossi portrayed as a sex symbol. Seeing him in bed, with a woman, and he bared chested, is not necessary. It doesn't speak well of his character.

I have worked in the field with sex offenders but not in the position of hunting them. I felt sad for Tommy Yates who essentially had no life; he only knew that he was hated and abused beyond measure. Hence, his psychosis , a diagnosis i am nor sure of either. Would another who has been treated in this manner as a child become a horrific serial killer. I think not. Some could actually be a person who helps abused people.",1525046400,,901,4.389221556886228
