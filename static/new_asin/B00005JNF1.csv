1516825,5,B00005JNF1,"This is a movie that I have been waiting for!! This is a great movie for the entire family. It is about a boy who wants to join the circus, but Mom and Dad won't hear a word of it. So Toby runs away from home to join the circus. Fall in with a crooked penut vendor who cheets him out of some of his pay. Is befreinded by an old circus clown and the strong man (both played in an tv series call "" ZORO""). Toby is put in carge of a mischivious Chimpanzee, to keep him out of troubel. Learns to ride a horse in the circus after anccident happen to one of the star preformers. Tobys perents have been looking for thier lost son for a long time. When they do finialy find him, they find that he is a star in the circus. Tobys fanticy of becoming a star in the circus finally comes true.

I highly recomend this move.  (personaly five stars is not enough to rate this move add 5 more stars).",1114732800,9,885,3.966292134831461
1516826,5,B00005JNF1,"Based on the classic children's novel, Toby Tyler is ideal material for a Disney movie.  You may remember Kevin Corcoran from several other Disney classics, including Swiss Family Robinson, Old Yeller, etc. and so forth.  Here he plays a young boy who runs away from home and joins the circus.  The circus adventure and comedy is a bit predictable, but well played and well served by the high Disney production values with great color, stunts, etc.

My favorite part of the movie involves Toby Tyler learning to ride and do stunts standing on a horse, and they have him tied to a pole that swings around a post to follow the galloping horse.  I can't describe the scene in words, you just have to see this bit of comic genius. It's worth the price of the DVD for this one segment alone.

But if that's not enough for you, you get a plethora of circus performances and exotic animals in color.  Highly recommended for the whole family to watch together.",1114387200,43,952,4.564705882352941
1516827,5,B00005JNF1,"We own an old VHS copy of Toby Tyler. Our 2 1/2 year old grandson, who is not interested in television, viewed this movie with amazement. He watched the entire movie and loved it.

Our Uncle Mike was Walt Disney's private chauffeur for years. We're sure Walt would want all his childrens movies released on DVD's,for our future generations.",1105747200,20,340,4.762711864406779

Yes  I've  watched  it.  I  don't  watch  it  very  often.
His  uncle  in  the  movie  is  such  a  Jerk!
Young  Toby  runs  off  neglecting  his  chores  &  finds  a  circus  who  has  just  arrived  in  town.  Kids  that  age  are  mischievous.  They  got  their  own  ideas  about  what  they  want  to  do  in  the  future,  mostly  like  most  kids  want  a  little  light  in  their  life  when  things  seem  dim.
&  receives  a  pass  to  come  back  &  enjoy  himself.
When  he  returns  home  to  tell  his  aunt  &  uncle  his  uncle  is  furious!
&  Toby  gets  jumped  on  pretty  good.
He  runs  off  for  good  the  next  time  to  spend  more  time  with  the  circus.

1517014,4,B00005JNF1,"I'd never heard of this movie but saw it cheap and thought I'd try it.
Toby Tyler is a nice young boy who lives with his elderly uncle and aunt, but after his uncle scolds him for a mishap on the farm (saying the boy's a mill stone around his neck) Toby runs away to the circus where a concessionaire had already offered him a job.
While on the road, Toby befriends another circus worker, the tough guy Mr. Cotter who inwardly has a soft spot for Toby and looks out for him.
Then with the help of a kind clown, a curious chimp, and a delightful trick rider, Toby gets a taste of what it's like to be in the circus.
Everything is going fine until Toby uncovers his employers sneaky secret and we're spiraled to a near tragic end.
You'll have to get the movie to find out how they ultimately get to the happily-ever-after.

Overall, this was a nice movie, with lots of animals and a variety of fun characters. I've sometimes felt that old Disney movies could have ""dull spots"" where they spent just a little too much time on a certain scene, but this movie didn't have that. The plot kept moving and had enough mystery to surprise you at the end. So I give it 4 stars.",1496361600,2,1166,4.228699551569507

I was delighted to find this Dvd version & purchased to share with my two grand daughters ages 5 & 3yrs old. They both loved it and the 5 yr old clapped at the end, the first movie that I have seen elicit a response with that level of enthusiasm from her! High praise!!

1517344,5,B00005JNF1,"After being told by his uncle that you're nothing to us! and calling Toby a millstone, Toby (Kevin Corcoran) decides to run away and join the circus.  (Basically, he was his aunt and uncles indentured servant.  They later try to guilt him through letters into returning home to do the work the nasty uncle is no longer able to handle.)  And if Toby thought his so-called-uncle was an abusive creep, that was before he went to work for Harry Tupper (Bob Sweeney) a tough taskmaster and cheat.  Have you ever thought of joining the circus?  (And working for peanuts.)  Bottle washing was the least of Tobys troubles; he also had to deal with a kleptomaniac chimpanzee (sticky fingers Mr. Stubbs filched everything from candied-apples to money he was willing to throw away).  He also became a sharpshooter on one occasion.  Loved Mr. Stubbs (the unofficial star of this movie).

Today's movies are much faster paced and kids want movies that keep them entertained every second (so they don't have to think?). However, even if my 6 year old granddaughter got up three times saying she was bored, she didn't wander far and was back as soon as there was some audible cue that things were getting tense again.",1463702400,,440,4.444444444444445

I saw it as a child, but enjoyed watching it again, because I had forgotten a lot of the little treasures in the movie. Our grandkids were delighted with the movie. They loved (and so did I) the little dog sized elephants, and the charming, mischievous, and funny chimp, Mr. Stubbs (our fave)--he was a hoot, and the child performers on horseback. (The boy who played Toby Tyler also played as Francis in Swiss Family Robinson). It's also a fun glimpse into history, like how there used to be ""circus parades"" when the circus came to town, and how people used to say what was on their mind--plainly and clearly! This movie was good, funny, sad at times, charming, and clean, wholesome entertainment for the entire family, including grandma and granddad!",1421884800,3,834,4.719178082191781

It still has a charm that I enjoyed. Not flashy or sophisticated but small town and nostalgic. Most kids now don't get what a big deal the circus was in the days before tv, electronics and such. There's a loss of something simple, but change is part of life. Nice to watch with a child who might want to talk about old times and circuses.

The movie is well done, good acting, etc... It's sort of sappy but works well, I like those movies. It's very clean and a very good family movie. I've read some professional reviews about this movie and please forgive me for my defense of this movie. I read how the movie points out the failures of a capitalists society, how the Toby character was exploited. Well, in some ways the child was exploited but the movie has characters such as Ben and the carnival owner who are honest and fair in their treatment of Toby. The American way is about being honest, hard working and achieving by hard work and discipline. Exploiting folks is not not what I've learned. I grew up with holes in the floors and hitting cockroaches off my food.

1517933,5,B00005JNF1,"When Walt Disney Classic movies are talked about usually it's the animated classics like, Peter Pan, Snow White, etc..., and for good cause, BUT the live action classics deserve a place in the discussion.  The Classic Live Action movies like, The Parent Trap, Swiss Family Robinson, and The Absent Minded Professor are outstanding examples of classic family cinema that will stand the test of time.

In the group has to be the Classic, Toby Tyler.  This movie is outstanding!  Though it doesn't have the name recognition of say, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, this movie is every bit as good.  The story by itself is worthy of 4 stars.  The movie is based on a book by James Otis Kaler, and was written in 1880.  What makes that cool is that this is the setting of the movie and the book, meaning that it was written as a vintage period piece, but as a current work.  Which I think makes the story more accurate to the time.

The actors that make up the movie are an interesting class of character actors most notably, Bob Sweeney, Gene Sheldon, and Henry Calvin.  But the STAR of the show is Kevin Corcoran as Toby Tyler.  Kevin was the made young boy actor for Disney after Bobby Driscoll aged out.  He can be seen in several of the Disney Live Action Classics(Shaggy Dog, Swiss Family Robinson, etc...).

This is a great Film for families, those that love the period of film (late 50s-early 60s), Disney Lovers(the magic is there), and those that enjoy a great story.",1407888000,3,1469,4.561068702290076

But when it was over, I thought to myself that I was totally entertained. The characters are likable and the story kept my interest the whole time...and that's hard to do. NOW BE WARNED! Try as hard as I could, I just couldn't find any cursing, nude scenes, violent explosions, fancy computer animations, etc. About the only thing I could find, was a very charming and entertaining STORY! So if you need all those other things to keep you riveted to a movie, do even think about this one. But if you believe that the best movies are the ones that simply tell a story, you'll probably enjoy this one and it won't cost you much.",1399075200,3,976,4.368131868131868

he is up to the task.  He finds his place with his new friends.  All the time he
is concerned about his aunt, particularly, and their farm.  What a lovely ending!!

Accused of being ""a millstone 'round our necks,"" Toby decides to make a new beginning by joining up with it.

1518454,5,B00005JNF1,"If you ever wanted to run away and join the circus as a kid, ""Toby Tyler, or Ten Weeks with a Circus"" is the film for you! Based on the 1880 children's book by James Otis Kaler, this oft overlooked Disney live-action classic from 1960 is the tale of a small boy who does just that! After an encounter with a very friendly circus concessionaire and an unpleasant verbal lashing from his cruel Uncle Daniel, little Toby Tyler (official Disney Legend Kevin ""Moochie"" Corcoran) hits the road to be an assistant concessionaire himself. Now a part of the Big Top family, Toby learns the ins and outs of circus life from a non-performer point of view, making friends with a secretly soft-hearted strongman, a delightfully kind and wise clown, and a sweet little girl whose horse-riding skills make her a starring attraction. But it's not all cotton candy for Toby once his concessionaire boss, Mr. Tupper, quickly reveals his true colors as a selfish and greedy opportunist. But it seems best friends can be even more trouble, as Toby's closest circus pal, the mischievous little chimp Mr. Stubbs, seems to get the boy into predicament after predicament by simply acting like a chimp. It's all in good fun though, despite one dangerous mishap when the monkeys break loose in a small town and Mr. Stubbs gets his hands on a Sherriff's guns, but Toby repeatedly shows his willingness to face any situation rather than runaway like everyone expects him to, even when a fib and a thrust into the center ring get him in over his head.

So, what makes ""Toby Tyler"" such a great family film, great enough to be considered by many to be among Disney's best? Well, there isn't really anything bad to say about the film, I don't even think it's as predictable as some may have said and is instead rather original, but I think the real charm of it is how 3 dimensional all the characters are! Yes, this is a family film where everyone has real depth of emotion; everyone seems like a real person! Even the manipulative Mr. Tupper (Bob Sweeney) has more personality traits than greedy and selfish. Truly, he does seem to take some pleasure and pride in seeing Toby's moments of success, even if he never ceases to lookout for number one. And the performances of these wonderfully real characters! They're just excellent! And why not, when ""Toby Tyler"" stars some of Disney's finest, including Zorro's Henry Calvin as strongman Ben Cotter and Gene Sheldon as clown Sam Treat. The film is also brimming with the sights and sounds and nostalgic charm of an old fashioned circus and the small towns it passes through. Plus, it's got a monkey! A monkey! What's not to love?! I'll tell ya what's not to love: Toby's mean uncle. Even at the end of the film, I don't like the man. But, hey, still a wonderful, feel-good, family classic!

Every kid should get to see ""Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks with a Circus"" at least once, so thank goodness it is finally available on DVD! The DVD itself is a mix of good and bad. Everything it's got is good (the issue of formatting is in question with a lot of these old Disney films, and there is a good chance the fullscreen here IS appropriate). The problem is what this DVD hasn't got; specifically, bonus features. There's not a one. That's not all that unusual with classic Disney live-action, but it's still inexcusable, especially when Kevin Corcoran was brought in to do interviews and such for other films released to DVD around the same time. He's a big part of the Old Yeller DVD, so why don't we get so much as an interview here? Or the Walt Disney TV series intros for the television airings? Or even a trailer? Well, it's enough to complain about but not a reason to pass up on this excellent film that should be in everyone's home library. I recommend that you pick up this DVD before it becomes nearly impossible to find like so many other Disney live-action classics that I'm still trying to catch up with myself!",1238803200,4,3937,4.598862019914652

1518503,4,B00005JNF1,"""Toby Tyler"" (1960) is one of my earliest movie memories. In combination with the film Whitman Publishing released a book of the screenplay, which differed considerably from the source novel, managing to lighten up the story.

Most boys (at least in my class) were at first reluctant to see the film because it's star, Kevin ""Moochie"" Corcoran, had pretty much ruined the ""Spin and Marty"" serial when he was added to the cast after the first season. We also had suffered through his ""too cute"" acting in ""Old Yeller"". Rare is the child actor who was more irritating to his contemporaries. But ""Moochie"" was just a hammy kid who did what the director wanted; and fortunately the director of ""Toby Tyler"" dialed down the standard ""Moochie"" cuteness for his first staring role.

The film was the perfect escape for boys. Running away with the circus was almost as good as getting to spend the whole summer riding horses on the Triple ""R"" Ranch. Plus Toby's protector was Ben Cotter, our old friend Sgt. Garcia from ""Zorro"". Mr. Stubbs the chimp is given the ""too cute"" supporting role that ""Moochie"" normally played, which was most likely an attempt to expand the target audience to include pre-teen girls. It worked as the film entertained the entire family.

The story involves Toby's efforts to move from peanut vendor to circus performer. He eventually replaces a snotty boy in a bareback riding act. His partner is Mademoiselle Jeanette (Barbara Beaird), my first crush and most likely the reason that I remember the film so fondly.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1200787200,3,1581,4.822878228782288

1518506,5,B00005JNF1,"""Toby Tyler"" is an excellent family movie and a rare one as well since it is suitable for every member of the family.  I have watched ""Toby Tyler"" multiple times and find it as enjoyable now as when I first saw it as a child.

Toby Tyler (Kevin Corcoran, who was a Disney regular as a child and appeared in ""Polyanna,"" ""A Tiger Walks,"" and ""Old Yeller,"" among others) is orphaned and living with his aunt and uncle.  However, life is hard for Toby and he feels unloved.  After his uncle makes him feel like a burden, Toby runs away to join a circus passing through town.

Toby works as a concessionaire for Mr. Tupper (Bob Sweeney, who also appeared in Disney's ""Moon Pilot"" and ""Son of Flubber), who manages to make it appear as though he is helping Toby when he cons Toby regularly.  For example, Mr. Tupper convinces Toby that he must share his tips with Mr. Tupper.  Toby also finds a protector in Ben Cotter (Henry Calvin, ""Babes in Toyland"" and Sergeant Garcia in Disney's 1950's television series ""Zorro""), who turns out to be a good friend to Toby, along with clown Sam Treat (Gene Sheldon, who also appeared in ""Babes in Toyland"" and ""Zorro) and chimpanzee Mr. Stubbs.

Life is initially difficult for nave Toby.  He has a hard time focusing on his job and keeping food from Mr. Stubbs.  Even though chaos seems to follow Toby, an opportunity arises for Toby to take center stage at the circus.  Somehow things just never seem to go well for Toby, and he decides to leave the circus, but tragedy strikes.  The end of this movie will bring smiles and make you want to watch this movie again in the near future.

Kevin Corcoran seemed to play the same character again and again.  However, Corcoran excelled in ""Pollyanna"" and ""Toby Tyler.""  Toby is an innocent in a wild world and we get an opportunity to see the world as Toby sees it.  Even though Toby has some bad experiences, Toby also gets to do some very exciting things and for just a moment we can think back to an era when circuses visited smaller towns and it was common for boys to at least think about running away to join the hard life of the circus.

The marvelous thing about this movie is that it has action, excitement and humor, and yet is sufficiently tame for even the youngest members of the family.  The portions of the circus that we see add to the excitement of the story.  I also enjoyed how this movie ends.  Though we know that life is complicated and messy, for a brief moment life is joyful and unrestrained and we can all too briefly recapture all the possibilities that exist when you are a child.

1518582,4,B00005JNF1,"From the book/story Toby Tyler or Ten Weeks With the Circus makes plausable the attraction for the 'Glitzy' life of a roving performer.

BUT

For those of us who know better, here is the perfect vehicle for the best features of Kevin Corchran's portral of the Moochie charactaer.  The almost copyrighted close one eye in squint to gaze upward in ponder that 'Moochie' does best finds believable opportunity here.

The story line begins as expected with the unloved un-WANTED and percievably un-welcome orphan taking it upon himself to accept the hospatility of flashy, intrieguing  strangers.  A concessionaire literally lures Toby into the extended circus family only to be less than benevolent to the boy.  Here it is that Mr Walt portrays the mistreated youth completely sans what today would have called for explicit molestation, wounding, personal damage.

But the youth is KIND.  The youth is just that; a youth - a real child.  Toby is curious.  Toby is polite as best as he knows how. Toby is thoughtful.  Toby has some fun.  Toby likes some people and he doesn't like others.  Toby is not amorous but he does love (characterized by the Toby's friendship with his horse...  well, it WOULD have been a horse if this had been a western.  But since this is a circus movie his affectionate companion is a chimpanzee). Comic relief?  like a dwarf maybe.  Portral of emulatable ethics?  Absolutely.  Mr. Walt ever so cleverly,subtly teaches through demonstration values to which we now so tritely refer as 'family values'

These are the Disney trademarks that my generation came to know and love - - - and TRUST.

No sex.  No gore.  No smart ass.  No vicious.  No terror.

  A little heartache, a little success, a little labour, a little friendship, a little greed, a little self centered ego, a little happy, a little sad, and a little boy in the middle of it all.

  This is not Fast action, attitude, in your face, backward hat fare.  This is an intresting tale, portrayed in welcome (nay most-welcome) moderation.

I recommend this to anyone that is contemplating being a GOOD grownup regardless of their present age.",1142380800,6,2124,4.840782122905028
1518583,5,B00005JNF1,"This Walt Disney movie has never had the exposure it deserves. I think that any of us who first saw it as young children in 1960, immediately wanted to run away to join the circus as young Toby did.

It is colourful, exciting in parts and always entertaining. Toby shows us that you can achieve anything if you really want to. He goes from being a lowly concessionaire to a star turn for the circus in just 10 weeks. The antics of Mr Stubbs the chimpanzee will have you laughing out loud often.

This is a movie for the young and young at heart, I love it!",1141257600,10,556,4.186915887850467

I really don't know what the fuss is about it being in wide or full screens. the VHS was a fullscreen tape, and it was great. so there is no need to be worried about the widescreen effect. Either way its a great family movie, with lots to say and teach us, about values, love, and friendships. I Suggest this movie to everyone!",1129420800,21,361,4.246376811594203

Of course you can not take away from the film itself, it's wonderful and ever kids dream to join the circus.  I had even gone as far as being an employee of the Disney family until Eisner came in.  That was the down fall of Disney.  His only intension was to make LOTS of money, screw the Disney name then get out.  I worked at WDW during the 80's and a few years ago went back to visit.  THE MAGIC IS GONE!  It's turned into just an amusement park like all the rest.  Poor Walt and his good family name and the death of Mickey.",1128729600,9,677,4.099236641221374

1518588,2,B00005JNF1,"Once again Amazon is being mighty mysterious about whether or not this new (Aug. 2, 2005) DVD release of Toby Tyler is in widescreen!

Did Disney serve us well? Or did they blow it again? It's hard to tell, since Disney DVDs have proven to be a very risky 50/50 proposition.

If it's in widescreen, I recommend you buy it, and I'll add more stars to it later.
If it isn't, then FORGET it!

UPDATE, 2007: Amazon finally came out and admitted that it's NOT in widescreen. So, as I said, forget buying it until it is.",1123718400,3,514,4.278350515463917
