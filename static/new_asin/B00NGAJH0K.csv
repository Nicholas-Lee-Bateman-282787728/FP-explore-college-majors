6648989,5,B00NGAJH0K,"This turned out to be better than I thought it would be. This another one of those English made TV shows that is under-rated and gives an insight of the European life style of the early 70's, fascinating.  The stories and plots were very well written and location shots all over Europe were wonderful and insightful. Robert Vaughan and the entire cast were great.",1434844800,31,363,4.671875

6648991,4,B00NGAJH0K,"An ITC production, The Protectors (1971-73) was a half hour action series that ran for two seasons, producing 52 episodes.  After starring in the hugely successful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Man-From-U-N-C-L-E/dp/B00MWD1ZMK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Man From U.N.C.L.E.</a>&nbsp;(1964-68) Robert Vaughn returned to series television as Harry Rule, the leader of ""The Protectors"", a small group of highly skilled operatives.  Nyree Dawn Porter co-stars as the Contessa Caroline di Contini, and Tony Anholt is featured as Paul Buchet.

Rule lives in London, di Contini in Rome, and Buchet resides in Paris.  The group operates primarily in the Europe, where they become engaged in wide variety of activities, from basic detective work to espionage.  The individual members appear to be well off financially, and well accustomed to the good things in life, yet they are all too willing to become involved in intrigue and deception, and employ violence if necessary.  In action, the team embodies professionalism, operating with a sense of style and class, in the pursuit of justice.  The stories may not always be solidly grounded in reality, but the tone is always serious, with little played for laughs.  If you like adventure with a touch of chic flair, you might want to check out what this series was about.

Featuring a rousing instrumental main theme, and closing with the memorable ""Avenues and Alleyways"" sung by Tony Christie, The Protectors was originally released on DVD by A&E back in the mid 2000's.  Those sets are now out of print, and currently command premium prices in the secondary market.  This 2015 release is a more economical option, that may introduce this obscure British cult favorite to a larger audience.",1434067200,72,1787,5.557195571955719
6648992,5,B00NGAJH0K,"I thoroughly enjoyed this series.  The relationships among the key characters were believable, and I looked forward to seeing the next episode.  The scenery and locations were often beautiful.  I am glad I purchased this series after searching for Robert Vaughn movies on Amazon, even though it was done many years ago and I was unfamiliar with it.",1433808000,15,348,4.9655172413793105
6648993,5,B00NGAJH0K,I  have not seen this series since it aired in the 70's very enjoyable  for only a 30 min show lots of action Robert Vaughn  and Nyree dawn porter made a good team nice set good quality and sound would recommend,1506038400,2,211,4.097560975609756
6648994,4,B00NGAJH0K,Interesting show here.  I grew up with The Man from UNCLE but had never heard this show.  The on site European locations make up for half hour show.  Half hour is OK for a sit-com but for this type of action and espionage the half hour length leaves many gaps of explanations of plot.  All in all though a fairly entertaining show.,1505001600,4,331,4.290322580645161

6648998,5,B00NGAJH0K,OK!!!,1497225600,,5,5.0
6648999,5,B00NGAJH0K,"I bought this  a year ago and finally got around to watching the series. British TV at it's finest. The show is about a group of people in an organization known as the Protectors who describe themselves at times as Detectives, although they are much more than that. There is shades of Mission Impossible in some episodes and spy vs spy in others. It was interesting to see how far we've come with computers in 46 years since the show was first filmed. Back then Harry Rule (Robert Vaughn) would have to call in to get time on the computer, a mainframe somewhere. In some episodes we see that the Protectors is a much larger organization than the 3 main characters that it focuses on. Other episodes contain classic British humor.

The series ran for 2 seasons and were filmed in 1971 and 1973. The episodes are short, about 25 minutes each including opening credits. With the exception of one 2-part episode the entire plot line and conclusion is over in a short time. It's easy to watch the show (who can't find a half hour in a day)? I enjoyed it along with the Persuaders that I watched last year. I have a few more British shows that I will watch and hopefully enjoy as much as this one.",1493251200,,1191,4.409090909090909

6649006,3,B00NGAJH0K,Long ago.  A syndicated British half hour adventure series from the Andersons.

6649011,2,B00NGAJH0K,"My main complaint with this is the low quality of the DVD, everything looks blurry and the picture seems to surge between merely ok and just flat out bad. I have a lot of older series on DVD and the one thing I noticed is most other one hour series put 3 episodes on one disc; this series, while only half hour per episode crams 8 episodes on a single disc. I suspect the British production values are not as good as American ones but this show is hard to watch because the video quality looks like it was dubbed from a VHS tape left out in the sun too long. Compared to contemporary series like ""The Mod Squad"", or ""The Invaders"" the video quality is very poor, almost unwatchable. A pity really as the stories seem to be pretty solid and the acting is first rate, great Euro scenes as well. I'd love to see what this series looked like in it's original form. This DVD set is just way too compromised to give it justice.",1480982400,6,921,4.209039548022599
6649012,5,B00NGAJH0K,"I love this show! I'd almost forgotten it until I saw it on Amazon. Robert Vaughn is always a favorite, and I had such a thing for the Contessa di Contini when I was a boy, watching the re-runs many years after the show went of the air of course. Uh hum. It's only half an hour, so the focus is on action, which was unusual for the slower paced time when shows seemed to drag at times between action sequences. The plots are handled very well for the format, and are mostly believable. There's not always a happy ending either. The acting is great of course. The actor who plays Paul went on the play Tony in Space 1999. All in all it's a fun show, especially when you have 1/2 an hour to kill, or just want a really good show that's exciting but won't require all night to watch. Highly recommended for fans of action, adventure, detective stories, international intrigue, spies, and just a good yarn.",1477958400,2,902,4.34319526627219
6649013,3,B00NGAJH0K,"Had to buy this set to find out for myself what ""The Protectors"" was all about. What a lousy TV Series!

6649023,5,B00NGAJH0K,"This is one of those rare gems - a live-action Gerry Anderson show that stands the test of time.

Gerry Anderson got stuck working with puppets, something he had been very vocal about at times. His heart was in live-action shows, and so shows like Space:1999 were dear to him, but this show is one that slips by a lot of radars. It's a show with a formular similar to Secret Agent, or The Saint, or The Avengers, and it really holds up well.

When this show was made, Man from UNCLE, I Spy, The Prisoner and many others tried to do the Spy thing, as a natural by-product of the very real cold war going on outside.

The cast is wonderful, the stories solid, and the whole general feel is so successful that, now, in retrospect, it just has that exactly right feel.

Lovely. Thanks!",1461283200,23,781,4.328767123287672

6649028,5,B00NGAJH0K,"I'm enjoying the series.  It's fun seeing the scenes in Europe, the styles of the era, interesting story lines, and, of course, Robert Vaughn. Porter and Anholt were great additions.  It's also fun seeing the various supporting cast that ended up headlining their own series.  A very young Jeremy Brett played a villain and played a perfectly classical Sherlock Holmes (IMHO).  There have been so many others like a younger James Bolam of ""New Tricks"".  It's a half-hour show so it's handy to watch between activities and other programs.  I haven't finished yet but most certainly shall do so.  On the technical side, there are a few aberrations resulting from the digitizing process.  Very minor and have not interfered with my viewing so far.  It runs on my Toshiba DVD  which also plays BluRay and connects to the web.",1453766400,3,821,4.841726618705036

8677888,5,B00NGAJH0K,"We don't go out to eat often but when we do there is always a lively discussion of restaurants and menu selections. My Beautiful Saxon Princess is a gourmet, savors her meals and is quick to try new tastes. To me food is fuel and Im not one to experiment when I acquire a taste for something like a cheeseburger Ill order it quite often and feel no need to change.

Its a similar situation with The Protectors, a Gerry Anderson production that offered neither marionettes nor nubile young women wearing purple wigs and silver suits seemingly applied with spray paint  its definitely an acquired taste. Starring Robert Vaughn, Nyree Dawn Porter and Tony Anholt, The Protectors is one of that vanished breed of television programs that the British did so well: The half-hour action adventure series. It ran from 1971 to 1973 and  chronicled the activities of a loose network of agents that travelled across Europe fighting crime, defeating terrorism and generally being twentieth century Lone Rangers.

With only 22 minutes to work with there wasn't much time for character development, though we did know that Harry Rule (Robert Vaughn) still cared very much for his ex-wife, Nyree Dawn Porters Contessa enjoyed the privileged life of widowed nobility but also held a very subtle candle for Harry Rule, and Tony Anholt managed to show loyalty and likeability though the faade of Paul Bouchets Gallic pride. Despite their brevity the stories were engaging , with occasional innovations in plot and camera work that were pioneering for early Seventies. For example the  pilot episode involved sky-diving but there were some interesting shots made via car mirrors that focused your attention in a very effective albeit low-tech manner.

If I had a complaint it would be budget. Sir Gerry wasn't given much to work with and money was cut even further with the second series, causing the loss of the strength and wit of the Contessas chauffer Chino (played by Anderson regular Anthony Chinn).  Directors were also careful with location shooting, limiting Continental segments to Copenhagen, Paris, Venice, Malta or coastal Spain. At  each of these locations the crew would film exterior footage for several episodes then they would fly back to London for interior filming and editing. To the producers credit they spaced the shows out avoiding back-to-back adventures in the same city, but on a rainy day you can zip through your DVDs and piece together what was shot when. I particularly enjoyed the location shots as they let me see the real Europe rather than an idealized version as portrayed in shows like The Avengers that were tailored to appeal to what Americans thought the UK was like rather than how it really was.

So now were down  to my regular closing question: Does The Protectors consist of the finest visual literature?

No.

Is it fun?

That would be a resounding, echoing YES  but a qualified yes. The Protectors might not be everyones favorite, but if you have an appreciation for well-written short form video, a desire to see an honest glimpse of Europe forty years ago, or have a hankering to hear Robert Vaughn  deliver dialog in the way only he could, then The Protectors is the cheeseburger for you.",1528588800,,3220,4.915129151291513
