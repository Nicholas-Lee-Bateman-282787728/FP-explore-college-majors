4530648,5,B0052SO0YC,"This is about as good as it gets when it comes to making those dreary Greek myths palatable.  The casting was brilliant and the acting is superb.  If she was my stepmother, I'd certainly give it a shot!  A haunting and unforgetable face that will stay with you  for days, maybe a lifetime. And,  forget Norman Bates, Perkins as a lovesick boy is much more appealing and convincing.  These are Oscar worthy performances.  The real surprise though is Vallone as the modern day irrepressible Zorba pushed finally to the limit.  Man can be destroyed but not defeated!  The black and white cinematography is lovely, and the Greek locations and music wrap it up into a beautiful package.  The ""cloudiness"", both visual and intellectual, is just right. The transfer is better than you'd expect.  Hmmm, and just a mere 50years after its release, it finally is available on DVD ""upon request"".  Do it!  They don't make them this way anymore.  Alas!!!",1310428800,27,941,4.8
4530649,4,B0052SO0YC,"Judge James A. Stewart, DVD Verdict--Casting Anthony Perkins essentially made this movie. That's not to say that Jules Dassin's direction is flawed in any way or that any of the performances falter, but there's a certain extra level of foreboding for anyone who's seen Perkins as Norman Bates. His Alexis starts out with a polite naivete, with an occasional hint of something nasty underneath turning up as the movie progresses. Dassin throws in a few obvious things--like the eerie way the lights flicker as Alexis tries to make a plane reservation on the phone or the way he practically makes love to his ""girl,"" an Aston Martin car he can't afford--to make sure audiences get nice and nervous. The odd thing is that once I realized this was pretty much a red herring, everyone else in the movie suddenly had that sinister quality about them, especially Melina Mercouri as the jilted adulteress. At one point, her face just said ""murder."" As things get tense in Greece, Alexis and Phaedra play head games with each other, even as Dassin's playing head games with us, and you'll be sure something bad is going to happen, gluing you to the screen.

Mercouri mostly looks miserable, though, as she's sitting alone at her party after her husband's departure or throwing an expensive ring from her husband in the Thames. In the latter scene, she's joking about it, but her unhappiness in marriage comes through. Her performance hits home the message that her husband's fond of showiness--naming a ship after her or tossing flowers to her from his helicopter (a thorn could really hurt that way)--but not actually very loving. Points to Dassin for his bravery in casting his wife this way.

This was filmed in 1962, so the actual lovemaking scene is...a little weird. It starts with Phaedra kissing Alexis in front of the fireplace, and then things get blurry, literally. The justification is that Phaedra cries as she makes love. You'll see glimpses of writhing naked bodies, but the picture gets intentionally fuzzy enough that it's mostly in your imagination, like much of the rest of the movie.

It's a limited run, so don't expect any remastering, but except for the blurry bits, Phaedra's black-and-white picture looks good, as does the Greek scenery. Mikis Theodorakis' score, with Grecian hints, comes across well, too.

The only extra is a trailer which avoids the ickiness of the movie's stepmother theme.

4530653,5,B0052SO0YC,"It is CRIMINAL that I was kept ignorant of this film until I was almost 57....Forgive me if I gush, but aside from THE LAW, I am almost a Dassin (and Mercouri) newbie.  I bought the film because of my love for ancient Greek theater, and the candor of Western Civilization's first confrontations with the verities of human experience.  I wasn't prepared for an absolutely first-rate slab of cinema:  as far ahead of its time, if not farther, than LA DOLCE VITA; that is, current for the times, but well ahead of the movies, if one regards cinema as properly an art form for adults.  Not only is it totally (I am aware of the superlatives I'm stacking up) technically assured, with black-white cinematography so crisp and deep you wouldn't want it in color, but so free of movie B.S. that I can't help noting Dassin achieved it age 51 after starting at age 30, whereas it took Steven Spielberg until age 66, after starting at 25, to come by such an effortless and masterly command of cinematic storytelling and mise en scene, informed by REAL LIFE as opposed to other movies (or TV shows, serials or comic books).  One almost watches 99% of other films half-asleep, one knows so well what to expect at every moment.  Such spontaneity, conviction so real it's almost casual, absolute belief from the cast, a peerless juxtaposition of male and female sensibilities (befitting, one might say, Dassin's script collaboration with Margarita Liberaki), even the most well-thought-out and efficacious use of lap-dissolves in decades before or since, vaults this film beyond so many made even since then that I was more excited seeing it on TV than by anything on the big screen since Guy Maddin's THE SADDEST MUSIC IN THE WORLD or Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL (two other brilliantly alive black-white films), and have made room in my top ten.

How did I miss out on it?  I can only suppose it had to do with Dassin's being blacklisted during the McCarthy era, such that his subsequent European output was overlooked; or because he and Melina Mercouri, whom he wed, were accused in 1970 of financing attempts to overthrow the Greek military junta, following the overthrow of which they returned to Greece, Mercouri entering Parliament and Dassin becoming a confirmed Philhellene.  Here he has updated  Euripides' HIPPOLYTUS, but without any irksome atmosphere of Forbidden Passion Awaiting Divine Punishment--this being a given with an ancient drama based on yet more ancient mythology.  Dassin and Liberaki and Mercouri and Anthony Perkins (plus Raf Vallone) give us a portrait of passion so deeply felt, so accurately nailed, so out of the mainstream and so electric I can believe it came with personal resonance for either or both scenarists--it did for this reviewer.  For sheer candor and quality, it might have enjoyed the same longevity in critical and popular esteem as Stanley Kubrick's LOLITA, which enjoyed the decisive advantage of being based on a notorious and newsworthy 7-year-old international bestseller, rather than a 2,500-year-old dramatization barely remembered by any but scholars of ancient Greek.

It is no question of there being any life left in such antique materials, as Spike Lee's bracing, wildly ambitious CHI-RAQ (an update of Aristophanes' LYSISTRATA) demonstrates; in the West, the Greeks faced all the urgent questions first, bringing them no closer to resolution than anything since, but still welcome in their stark clarity and spare directness.  These stories will occur and re-occur throughout human history; it is up to the breadth of vision, depth of feeling, and scope of imagination in a writer and director to make us forget that we've felt these things and then asked these questions since the beginning.",1452556800,9,3738,5.008064516129032

4530657,5,B0052SO0YC,"Good Movie. Anthony Perkins gives a good performance. Phaedra (Melina Mercouri) is sent by her wealthy older husband, Thanos (Raf Vallone), to London in order to bring his son from a previous marriage, Alexis (Anthony Perkins), home for the summer. After Phaedra meets Alexis, they fall in love and embark on an affair. Alexis returns to Greece but feels consumed by guilt about the situation. When Thanos tries to arrange a marriage for him, it brings out jealousy in Phaedra that leads to a tragic series of events. When Phaedra opened, it was met with mixed reviews. It fared best in Europe, where it won praise for Jacques Natteau's wide-screen black-and-white cinematography and the love scenes, particularly the stars' first sexual encounter, in which rain on the windows creates a series of erotic, out-of-focus images. But even the European critics carped about some of the updating, particularly the use of cynical peasants as a Greek chorus, who are simultaneously entranced and repelled by the family's lavish lifestyle. Although Variety's critic predicted the sex and star power would make it a box-office winner, Phaedra was a box office failure in the U.S., only performing well in Europe.",1430438400,,1203,5.142857142857143

I remembered thinking Tony Perkins was very miscast, but he was not as unsuitable as I remembered, in some case doing some good work in the film. The whole thing is a little over acted, but interesting to watch. Fun scene was watching Perkins take his Aston Martin DB5 off the cliff on the corniche to the strains of the Bach Toccata and Fugue in D Minor. They no doubt did not trash a DB5, but the editing is pretty convincing. Dassin is better remembered for ""Topkapi"" and ""Rififi.""

However, they have twisted Racine's story and made the step-son the aggressor.  Plus in the original there never was an affair between the two, only the lusting in her heart, which Phaedra overcame.  There were the rumors by the servants which drove the story.  In the movie Theses was somewhat above everything and did not really care what the two were doing.  While with Racine, while nothing was going on Theses was maddened and cast out his son.  Death in the Aston Martin was a nice touch rather than the chariot.",1406246400,,631,4.482456140350878

The amorous triangle is played in Greece and Dassin made it with all the mythical deepness.

Just days ago, I viewed a rather fuzzy DVD of Dassin's magnificent, ""He Who Must Die"", also starring Melina Mercouri.  I had to send all the way to Greece for a rare copy of that one, and the limited resources of the outfit that made that transfer resulted in a viewable, but disappointing version.

It was glorious...and apparently MGM was the source of THAT print...for, here it is, available for purchase through AMAZON for home viewing. AT LONG LAST! RUN, DO NOT WALK, (figuratively speaking)TO OBTAIN YOUR OWN COPY. PLEASE!  This DVD transfer is awesome! Spectacular!
 In 1962, when this film was first released, I saw this film in an Art House Theatre in Center City Philadelphia with a posse of my friends. I was eighteen at the time and quite possibly, for all my pose of sophistication, the most naive teenager living. And then came PHAEDRA. In the 116 minutes of the film's running time, I grew up very quickly! You see, this was a story about LOVE and LOVE AFFAIRS...in and of every permutation. The throbbing, sexually charged immediacy of almost everyone in this film...is REVELATORY! I will not stop here in this little review of mine to give a pr&eacute;cis of the plot: that has been done to death since this film's release fifty years ago. When it was released in that dim, distant past, it changed cinema forever. It contain a scene of the most fearsome, fevered eroticism ever filmed. It was hardly explicit...one had to fill in the gaps in one's own mind...but it was filmed with such breathtaking beauty...such exquisite and ecstatic artistry...that it staggered and overwhelmed auditoriums filled with stunned spectators. The effect was unbelievable.
I must, again, without detailing the plot wholesale, describe the EFFECT rather than the FACTS of this film. It is High melodrama, loosely adapted from the Hippolytus legend. We are in the land of Greek Tragedy with all the symmetries and Classic Schematics of  the ""genre"" observed, But don't let that frighten you away. The tragedy is interpreted for modern sensibilities...and it is all at once bracing, shocking and immediate. And...it remains as current today as it was when it was first released. Despite the multiplicities of its tragic end... it is strangely life affirming. It left me, fifty years ago, with a determination to live my life right down to the dregs. And I have.
If you've seen the film...you will want this particular version of it...because it is the best transfer of the movie ever offered...and it is a must have for every movie buff's collection. If you've never seen the film...this is a rare opportunity to experience one of the high-water landmarks of modern cinema.

4530728,5,B0052SO0YC,"There are two very strong features of this film:  The chemistry between Mercouri and Perkins, and the scenery of London, Paris, and Greece.  These alone make it well worth watching.  The story is a tragedy, based on the play Hippolytus by Euripides.  The plot, which is rather didactic, shows how bad behavior and the transgression of boundaries lead inevitably to unhappiness and disaster.  Raf Vallone is not a very good actor (and not very credible as a Greek), and the other players are just competent, doing their jobs, but Mercouri and Perkins are magnificent.  They put everything they have into their performances, which are the best of their careers, as far as I have seen them.  Their passion just pours off the screen.

The first half of the film, in which Phaedra and Alexis consummate their love, is by far the most interesting part of the film.  The second half, in which the inevitable destruction occurs, seems to fall flat.  Perhaps it's so obvious that things are going to turn out badly that when it finally does it seems anti-climactic.  Mercouri and Perkins in their brief final scenes together again electrify the screen, and one hopes they can find a way out of their terrible predicament.  But of course they can't.

The sound track by Mikis Theodorakis is a beautiful compliment to the story.  Theodorakis' best popular work is The Ballad of Mauthausen and Six Songs<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballad-of-Mauthausen/dp/B0000005J8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballad of Mauthausen</a>.

It was somewhat like time travel because it still evoked the same sexual feelings, fascination with, and magnitism towards a man, but this time, the flawed father, not the young son, Alex. I loved PHAEDRA then, and love it now.

But more enticing than the erotisim Is the psychological interplay of the characters.  I went from being a virgin teen to a seasoned psychiatrist during the interim 50 years since first seeing this film. The film is psychologically dead on (no pun intended).  The artistic caliber - acting, photography, editing and musical score seem almost perfect, Maybe they are.

The object relations, stellar representation of human existance, and flawless mirror for us if we own our dark sides, is priceless.  Thank you for this gift!",1345939200,2,921,4.748427672955975

4530768,4,B0052SO0YC,"""Phaedra"" was a box office disaster when it first premiered in 1962, but it has dated well. Having seen a number of Perkins' films in which he romances an older woman (Sophia Loren, Ingrid Bergman) and delivers an embarrassingly souless performance, I was relieved to see him in a romantic drama in which he and his co-star actually generate some heat! The love scene by the fire was surprisingly erotic, and I sensed a real-life chemistry between the two actors (a suspicion that was confirmed by ""Split Image"", the Perkins biography). It's clear Perkins was affected by the warmth of the passionate Mercouri, and what's more, I couldn't help but notice the striking physical resemblance between her and Perkins' later wife, Berry Berenson. That physical type must have appealed to him and he managed to turn in a better-than-average performance. However, his soft-spoken manner, adolescent quirkiness and reliance on prep school charm makes this performance a carbon copy of his work in ""Goodbye Again"". Whenever Perkins gets angry, he fails to look really threatening, more like a kid throwing a tantrum because he's been grounded. Thanks to director Dassin's skillful editing, however, Perkins' tendency toward campiness is trimmed and the director did a great job maximizing Mercouri's beauty and the beautiful Greek island locations. You'll feel like you've traveled to Athens by the end of the film.",1329091200,7,1406,5.1982378854625555
4530769,5,B0052SO0YC,"Like evrybody else it seems, I've been trying to find even a VHS copy of PHAEDRA, even Netflix doesn't have it. This is a modern version of the classic Greek play by Euripides. It tells of a woman who has offended Aphrodite so grievously that the goddess curses Phaedra (played by a ravishingly beautiful) Melina Mercouri, making her fall in love with her stepson (Tony Perkins). Raf Vallone plays the Greek shipping tycoon husband & father.

The son from a previous marriage lives with his British mom in the UK & wants to be an artist. This desire, combined with his mother's endless complaints, has turned him sour on his Greek dad. There are inner-family tensions in Greece as well`as family members try to mark out their territory. Raf Vallone also wants his son to move to Greece & join the firm. Bad idea.

Phaedra goes to London to meet her stepson for the first time. They meet in the London Museum Greek Collection room (where else) near a statue of a headless Aphrodite.  One thing leads to another as the tragedy unfolds.

The choice of Perkins as Phaedra's lover seems strange at first & he is passive in the film; but it makes sense when you realize that Phaedra is the aggressor--on all levels.

Director Jules Dassin keeps in key elements of the original PHAEDRA, like ""the Nurse,"" Phaedra's sole confident--and the Greek chrous of women, local towns women, who are particularly effective near the end when the husband's flag ship, The Phaedra (naturally), goes down, killing most of the towns men on board. They beat on the office door, begging for news. Instead the door is opened and a steeley-cold & sun-glassed Phaedra walks out & pushes through the crowd without saying a word.

Dassin was basically forced to leave the US during the McCarthy period and wife Mecouri was involved in the Pan-Hellenic socialist movement, even serving as the Minister of Culture at one point. These 2 facts caused many US critics to pan the film, which may also explain why it's been so hard to find.

Is it great art? Maybe not, but it's steamy, interesting and has a particularly powerful theme song by the great film composer xxx. During the  love scene overlaying dark fire & Greek Orthodox icons appear to flow together & are superimposed on the actors..

Oh yeah, if you want to know what the quote means, ya gotta see the film.

Now to the technical side.  First of all, regardless of what Amazon say, ""This disc is expected to play back in DVD Video \""play only\"" devices, and may not play in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives"", you can probably ignore this warning (unless you're very, very unlucky). It plays with no difficulty whatsoever in my two Panasonic DVD multi-region recorders (one old, one newish). Secondly, although not mentioned, PHAEDRA is presented in 16:9 widescreen (1.77:1).  Although the theatrical release was 1.85, even after having seen it a dozen times in the cinema, I still can't see anything that's been cropped.",1322784000,4,883,4.782894736842105

4530773,4,B0052SO0YC,"I once asked my 92 year old grandmother what was the single most memorable event that had occurred during her long life.  Was it the invention of the automobile?  TV?  A-bomb?  Men on the moon?  Her reply was that she couldn't speak to my question but one thing she knew for sure: human nature never changed.

  Greek tragedies are studied in institutions of higher education because they resonate in the psyches of people today in much the same way they did before Christ was born, largely because human nature never changes.  The story of Phaedra's tragic mis-alliance with her stepson plays out in this movie because there are elements within it that are simply timeless.

  Phaedra, the pampered, adored but bored wife of a shipping tycoon, finds herself inexplicably and inexorably drawn into an affair with the tycoon's son from an earlier marriage.  It's a glorious thing.  He's young, attractive, sexually inexperienced and a breath of fresh air.  She's older but still beautiful, a rose in full bloom, no longer a bud but still desirable in the catnip way older women appeal to younger men today.  She's secure in herself and offers the promise of being an experienced lover.

  Ka-boom!

  When the stepson enters into business with his tycoon father, the impossibility of continuing the affair becomes apparent.  Phaedra is now repelled by the tycoon's sexual attentions and jealous of his son's youthful companions.  The stepson is young and trying to do the right thing, but can't deny he still has feelings for Phaedra.  It's doomed.

  The familiar story of Aristotle Onassis's life provided ample parallels with the backstory of this movie.  Onassis's cut-throat competition with his father-in-law Livanos is touched upon with Phaedra's husband's crazy workaholic alliances both with and against his father-in-law.  The death of the tycoon's only son presaged the death of Onassis's only son, Alex, ten years after this movie was made, as well as the suicide of Onassis's first wife, Tina Livanos Niarchos.

  What really resonated with me was Phaedra's implacable will, a force of spirit that swept everything before it, a will so inflexible that all consequences be damned.  I've known people like this.  It's not pretty.

  This movie was released in the early 60's and has some period details. The cast is perfect.  Mercouri is stylish and sexy, Tony Perkins is a far cry from his legendary performance as Norman Bates, and Raf Vallone as Phaedra's husband is spot-on as the tycoon trying to juggle his many business ventures as well as his famly life.  It's all the more effective that at the end of the movie he's only just beginning to learn of the wreckage his life has become, literally and metaphorically.

It is still as I remembered it: Anthony Perkins is terrific, poignant and self-destructive, abetted by Melina Mercouri whose performance in the title role is spellbinding. Although, how she could turn from Rafe Vallone's magnetism for a schoolboy's romantic charms is beyond me.

No black borders, just glorious Greece, London and Paris and Melina Mercouri and Anthony Perkins as the doomed lovers, not forgetting the magnetic Raf Vallone. It's just as good as when you first saw it in the cinema. And if you haven't, you absolutely MUST see it now. You won't see the likes of it again, not very likely.
Don't be discouraged by the stupid ""lesbian "" tag this film is given on this [the amazon] and other websites. It has nothing to do with lesbianism. But it has a lot to do with Greek tragedy. Powerful performances by Mercouri and Perkins. Neither was ever better in any film. Oh yes, almost forgot, and then there's the music by Theodorakis. Hauntingly beautiful.

Of course you have to make a few allowances for a film that is 50 years old, and how the world has changed, but it still hangs together.  Whether someone half the age of the film would feel the same I don't know but magnificent performances and a timeless story (as Phaedra says ""like all Greek songs its about about love and death"") its certainly worth a try.",1311379200,8,536,4.174757281553398

This modernized version of Greek mythology succeeds admirably, and the updated setting gives the story even greater power by providing us with characters and situations we can easily recognize.

Perkins has an odd, somewhat flat style of emotional expression when he acts, the opposite of Mercouri, seems a little like he did in Psyco.  The conclusion of the tragedy is largely predictable from early in the film so it lacks dramatic tension and uncertainty.
