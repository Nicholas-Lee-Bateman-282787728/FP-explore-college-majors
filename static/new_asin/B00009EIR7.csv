7990765,3,B00009EIR7,Liked this dvd. It's pretty funny. Lots of cursing though. It would be great if they didn't feel the need to swear all the time.,1364947200,,128,4.16
7990766,5,B00009EIR7,This is a great dvd that is full of great comedians in their younger years. It makes for a good laugh. It is always good to laugh. :) Thanks!,1353369600,,141,3.896551724137931
7990767,4,B00009EIR7,"It's got its highs, and it's lows, but overall it's got a lot of famous comedians with a variety in the material, and it's documented proof that these comedians got to where they are today because they're funny. I enjoyed it and am keeping it in my collection.",1217894400,,260,4.4375
7990768,2,B00009EIR7,"What a waste of time! The line-up of comedians is the B-listers yet they betray their high ranking with some lousy acts. Ray Romano does a decent job in trying to save the show but he cannot do it on his own. Sinbad simply isn't funny. Bill Bellamy is below par owing to his restricted repertoire. Overall, you would do well to give this one a miss.",1191628800,,349,4.223880597014926
