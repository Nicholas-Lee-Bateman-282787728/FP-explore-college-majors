8327514,5,B001NOMOJM,"Hilarious take on the Verne classic. Brit comedy fans will love it. Terry Thomas is his wonderful roguish self. Campy, yet clever.",1424390400,4,130,4.954545454545454
8327515,3,B001NOMOJM,The voices and the lips are not in sync at all picture quality is fair .  Problem is I have looked for this movie for years and could never foind a copy so in my book a bad copy is better than no copy.,1422230400,2,201,3.5681818181818183
8327516,4,B001NOMOJM,One of my favorite childhood movies. Except for the poor dub quality this is a great family movie. Just ignore the fact that the lips and the words don't quite match.,1407369600,,166,4.387096774193548
8327517,1,B001NOMOJM,"The title is a tipoff of what to expect, since Verne never wrote about a rocket to the moon. (The adventurers in ""From the Earth to the Moon"" were launched from a 900-foot long cannon.) This movie, like the title, has little to do with Verne... or good storytelling, for that matter. Adding insult to injury, as others have noted, the video transfer is lousy. Want Verne? Read a book. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.",1272931200,7,430,4.455696202531645
8327518,2,B001NOMOJM,"I've always liked this occasionally amusing attempt to duplicate the success of ""Those Magnificent Men in their Flying Machines"". In the USA this film was retitled ""Those Fantastic Flying Fools."" It's periodically shown on cable in a grainy, color-faded horrendously pan-and-scan version (the film is in Cinemascope, or its 1967 equivilant).

So I was overjoyed to discover an official widescreen DVD release. This feeling changed once I watched the movie. It is properly letterboxed, but that's the only good thing I have to say.

Problems? Let me count them:
1. it's apparently a PAL transfer and a clumsy one. The movements are jerky whenever someone crosses the screen or the camera pans, which is frequently;
2. The print is murky; it's almost always too dark;
3. the color fades in and out and rarely looks true;
4. the soundtrack is out-of-sync through most of the movie, making this British production look like a bad English-dubbed film;
5. even considering the time difference with a PAL-to-NTSC video transfer, the film runs no more than 108 mins. (103 mins. real time), which means there are at least 10 mins. missing from this version.

Stick with the pan-and-scan cable version (which runs 118 mins.) until someone does this one on video correctly! Wham! USA certainly didn't.",1240272000,23,1290,5.046948356807512
8327519,4,B001NOMOJM,"Also sold under the titles ""Blast Off"", and ""Those Fantastic Flying Fools"". This is a 1967 adventure comedy yarn very loosely inspired by the story of Jules Verne's classic tale, `From the Earth to the Moon"".  Set in the Edwardian age, it has a nice period feel. The British government is in an uproar due to the big failures of some new British inventions and they are worried they are falling behind in world stature. To turn things around they form a team of inventors and investors formed by P.T. Barnum.  Barnum is in England hiding out from creditors after his show burned down. They determine as a grand project to send a man to the moon.  The mission has to fight incompetence and sabotage along the way. Directed by Don Sharp with very good period costumes, believable sets, and fun special effects.
Burl Ives plays the part of P.T. Barnum rather well. The studio formed a stellar cast of character actors including Lionel Jeffries who appeared in ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" as Grandpa Potts, and Gert Frobe who appeared as the King in the same movie. Troy Donahue is the adventuring pilot. Terry Thomas plays the villain to form. Dahlia Lavi plays the lady with two fiancees.
DVD Quality: The sound and picture quality was poor, I would love to see this film remastered. I understand that there is another version sold at Amazon. UK (United Kingdom) that is remastered and has 10 minutes of fottage that is missing from this version.",1208736000,8,1442,4.691699604743083
