4013922,2,B002YVHOKW,"Robin Harris did a poor job on this act, I understand he was trying to get recognition to the upcoming comedians but, good lord, it's a complete garbage compared to his other masterpieces. So anyone looking to buy Robin Harris...Please don't buy this one it's horrible!",1398643200,,269,4.869565217391305
4013923,1,B002YVHOKW,"I chose this rating because it was horrible.
I didn't like the fact that it wasn't him preforming;however, I didn't get through the whole thing, so I don't no if he actually got on stage or not. I couldn't take any more.

Who would you recommend this product to? I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.

How do you rate this product?",1376870400,2,402,4.465753424657534
4013924,1,B002YVHOKW,"This video is a BLATANT ripoff to capitalize off of Robin Harris' talent and the shortage of comedic material he left behind due to his much-too-premature death.
It is essentially nothing but the EXACT, SAME product if you bought the dvd ""Robin Harris: Live from the Comedy Act Theater"" released in 2006. This version is just less edited and it includes the complete acts that he introduced on stage in the previously mentioned dvd. But this one contains almost the same Robin Harris footage, minus the interviews from people who knew and worked with Harris and little snippets of grainy but still hilarious Harris stand up comedy footage NOT seen in this version here. So, if you're buying this dvd to see Robin Harris (and, who would not) then there is nothing ""lost"" or ""just discovered"" about it. What IS lost in this dvd are the MINUTES.
First of all, start with the fact that the video is NOT 102 minutes as is CLEARLY stated in the product description here and on the dvd case itself. It is less than one hour in duration. As in, precisely 57 MINUTES. That is all.
And then, even with that, the video is not even an entire hour of Robin Harris' stand up comedy.
It is primarily a single comedy set and show where Harris was the emcee introducing other comedians (NONE of this or them are mentioned at all on the case description). Some of them funny, some of them not. (For the record, the comedians on this video are Myra J, who does a back and forth exchange routine on stage with Harris, Don Reed, Lewis Dix, John Henton and Renaldo Rey).
It even contains several comedic sketches of Harris (in drag) with actress Sheryl Lee Ralph.

But, the point is, is that this product is a CLEAR MISREPRESENTATION.
When all is said and done, what you have on this video is approximately 22 minutes of Harris on stage doing his stand up routine.
Harris was certainly a talented and extremely funny man who died tragically just as his career was getting ready to take off. Many times when someone dies suddenly they get undue praises and unrealistic expectations from others who like to say how successful or big of a star they would have been had they not died, but there is no doubt that this was true in Harris' case.
But, you'll still have to ask yourself if it's worth the price to see only 22 minutes of his stand up, when these routines have been seen and these jokes have been heard before by his fans.
If I had a choice, this would be the LAST available Robin Harris dvd that I would purchase. ""The Robin Harris Story: We don't die, we multiply"" and ""Robin Harris: Live from the Comedy Act Theater"" were both better than this.
Just keep in mind, that the one star I give for this one is for the copycat PRODUCT itself, NOT the performances.",1376524800,14,2745,4.479041916167665
