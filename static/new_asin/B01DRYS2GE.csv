8756745,3,B01DRYS2GE,"Back when there was a Soviet Union they get together with the Cubans to invade the U.S.A. Unfortunatly for them they chose to drop-in on one of the highest points in the world. The commies pick the wrong town to start their invasion. Here we find benevolent but defiant parents and the fiercest set of patriotic teenagers called wolverines; they will attempt to defend and free the country from the dastardly invaders. As we hear every cliche and see all the pitfalls, we get to kibitz.

Don't ask if an innovation can take place. It has. Now what are you going to do about it? Relatives shot, friends turned traitor, and outgunned, don't let that stop you.",1528329600,,657,4.615384615384615

The movie begins with news of political revolts in Europe and South America! What will happen to America? We see a small city. In September leaves are turning color and falling. [Symbolism?] There is a statue to the Rough Riders [the last Volunteer Corps in the US Army]. A teacher talks about the history of the Huns. Outside they see parachutes falling! The teacher goes outside and is shot dead! Automobiles crash in the parking lot! [Is this believable?] Teenage students grab supplies (food, arms, and ammunition) and head off to the woods. Can this well-regulated militia resist a professional army? [Refer to Europe in WW II.] These invader speak Spanish. They will gather Form 4473s to identify all owners of firearms in order to confiscate them. Never shoot twice as this allows the enemy to locate you.

The boys shoot a deer for meat and open cans of food. [Product placement?] When they run short they go into town. They notice changes. The KGB are looking for you! A lot of people were taken away to re-education centers. Its all gone says one man. You cant afford to cry. Go away before they find you. They learn about Free America. [Canned goods in glass should be on high shelves in case they fall.] One couple offers shelter and food. Horses don't need oil and gasoline. Radio Free America sends messages and songs. Things are different now. An enemy patrol runs into trouble, arrows and bullets. Citizens dig graves then are machine gunned. The resistance has captured AK-47s now. A girl delivers a package to a tank crew. The resistance attacks enemy troops, and leave a message. [Is the wolverine a state animal?]

There is an explosion in a club. [How different from terrorists?] One American pilot parachutes down and joins their group. He tells them what happened. Illegal immigrants were disguised combatants. They won't use nuclear weapons now. He tells them who is on out side! [There is a surprise.] Millions are starving. Snow falls. The Colonel gives lessons in military tactics. Whats a flank? There are attacks. The enemy is their supply line. An enemy tank approaches. There are casualties. More enemy troops arrive. A hunter can kill wolverines. The fighting goes on. One member is accused of treason. Will the good guys win in the end?

This is an exciting and colorful story for teenagers of all ages. Wars are waged for loot [land, people, oil or coal, etc.]. What does this small town have to offer except as an example that doesnt seem realistic? Many of the examples seem to be derived from WW II in Europe. [Do you know what happened when US forced were sent to Central American Banana Republics or the Philippines a century ago? This is a dramatic story, but I don't think this will ever happen. [Im an optimist, aren't you?] Could a few city teenagers do so well? They didn't play The Eve of Destruction at all.",1503187200,,2874,4.730538922155689
