7960514,4,B0000648Z9,"This is the fourth film I purchased directed by the very talented Stanley Kwan.  The first, Lan Yu, turned out to be an insightful essay on a gay relationship in China today with an outstanding performance by Hu Jun.  Everlasting Regret investigated the amourous choices our heroine made while the man who loves her and painfully suffers for it is rejected.  Tony Leung Ka Fai deserved an Oscar or is it a Golden Rooster?  Center Stage is a portrait of a famous actress who committed suicide at the early age of twenty five.  Using past footage and recreating scenes with Maggie Cheung mimicing her style.  A well orchestrated past and present juxtaposition.  Hold You Tight finds Director Kwan mining the world of human longing.  He takes you back and forward in time but, hey, you don't mind it all.  It works telling the love relationships.  Nothing is fixed.  All is in flux.  I viewed it for second time last evening and found it more rewarding.  Mr. Kwan can tell a tragic story with elan.  Final note.  All films reflect dashed hopes.  They remind me of Li Yu's Lost in Beijing.  But, they are a breath of fresh Chinese air.",1354406400,,1131,4.603015075376884
