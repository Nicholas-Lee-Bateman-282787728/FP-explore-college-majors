8646883,2,B00IZPWPUK,The rendition is modern although the dance moves are classical. Story set in modern office type surroundings. The interpretation lacks seriousness and passion and can be almost termed frivolous. The sweet music of Delibes jars with this choreography. Make sure you fully comprehend this interpretation before you buy. For me this was a waste of my money and time.,1414195200,3,363,5.169491525423729
8646884,5,B00IZPWPUK,"This is not a traditional version of Coppelia. It is also not a reworking in the classical tradition as is Patrice Bart's last version he made for the Paris Opera Ballet(his last work before retiring). This is mostly a completely modern approach to the story keeping the basic elements but not much of the traditional look. It is set in an artificial intelligence laboratory and Franz is a custodian along with three women(they are analogs of Swanilda's friends). Here we have a very active Doctor Coppelius who dances an enormous amount throughout this ballet. There is no Swanilda, as such, but we have the Coppelia doll who is an actual automaton in this version who moves and dances, but in a mechanical way. Both Dr. Coppelius and Franz seem enamored with her and fight a bit over her. There is a new character called the ""Spectral Diva"", who seems very similar to the Blue Fairy in ""Pinocchio""(the Blue Fairy is in the Disney version of Pinocchio; the original Collodi version calls her ""The Fairy with Turquoise Hair""), in the sense that she appears to make Coppelia human(as the Blue Fairy makes Pinocchio human). She shows her how to move and Coppelia follows her instructions. At the end, we have something like the ""Dance of the Hours"" and there appears to be a wedding of Franz and Coppelia. While all this is very different from the traditional treatment, there are a few aspects that should appeal to hardcore classical ballet fans: the story does try to give homage to the original and there is a lot(and I do mean a lot!) of very, very classical ballet dancing(yes, the women all dance on pointe as well). The dancing is also beautifully expressive and accurate, but with plenty of comic elements, which is appropriate to this ballet. The choreography tries very hard(and succeeds) in keeping us breathless and amazed at the energy and pyrotechnics and that is certainly a very classical approach. The music is also from the traditional version; no new music has been added(there is one strange exception: there is a small dance solo to the ambient noise of a dining hall!). If you are new to ballet this version should entertain you but won't give you much insight into the traditional version. If you are an old hand at ballet, this should be a welcome innovation. This is a great entertaining and amusing version, especially if you are already familiar with the traditional one.",1400284800,4,2397,4.792270531400966
