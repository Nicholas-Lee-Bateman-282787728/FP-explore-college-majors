8024523,5,B00029NMKO,The movie takes place six months after the first one. There's a ton of action as well as great visuals of the animation. Just wait for part 3 to be back in stock and I will be complete with the three part collection.,1456099200,,216,4.046511627906977
8024524,5,B00029NMKO,"Megazone 23 Part 2 was never a planned sequel and the fact that the same characters remain but with completely different character designs proves this and is somewhat disorientating at first, however you quickly get used to it. Part 2 was clearly made as a result of the unexpected success of the first one.

Part 2 was clearly on a very high budget, almost motion picture in look and feel. The character that truly comes off the best is Eve though who was designed by the legendary Mikimoto. Eve plays almost a central character in this. Her song 'Lonely Sunset', which plays briefly near the beginning but is also used at the end of the final scene and credits, is probaly the best song in the franchise, simply breathtaking. I also disagree with another reviewer saying the sex scene isn't as good as Part 1, Part 2 is actually more graphic, so much more so that some prude fans objected to it.

8024525,5,B00029NMKO,I have had my copy of megazone 23 on VHS since it came out. I now have it on DVD and I am still struck by how good the animation is. Very well done.,1286150400,,148,3.3823529411764706
8024526,1,B00029NMKO,"I feel very disappointed about this one... it is very bad, the first part Megazone  23 Part I was far better  I think that the sex scene was also better for that movie... the plot gets very confusing at the end and I really don't understand what happened to BD. and the renegades...those octopus beings what were them?  Please help me and explain...",1182470400,,349,4.507936507936508
8024527,2,B00029NMKO,"I will review this film like all others--I will list it's good then it's bad points. Please keep in mind I paid an insane $21.99 for this film.

The good- The Garland is back, but it hardly sees any action.

There is a little Yui and Shogo poster included with the DVD (wow...)...

The animation, like the original, can be stunning at moments (when the animators were not drawing in their sleep)...

Eve is back...

The not-so-good-...and so is Shogo.

Eve and Yui are the ONLY tolerable chars. in this film.

There is next to no action, and it is not very good.

The char. designs are so terrible I have no words. I feel like calling the fashion police on all of the face tattooed-bright hair-colored idiots in the OVA...painful to watch.

There is too much teen angst-like whining about adults. This was a trend in anime that I suppose started here, and now lives on in Evangelion, Gundam, etc.

I was actually glad when all the annoying chars. started dying (Dumpi, etc.), but in the end, they all lived anyway!

Like the last film in this series, their is nudity, which might make this unsuitable for the younger audience. But hey, at least that part was done well!

The animation, like the original, can suck most times.

The only reason this gets a VERY GENEROUS 2 stars is because of the garland, Yui, and Eve...",1171584000,,1319,4.514767932489452
