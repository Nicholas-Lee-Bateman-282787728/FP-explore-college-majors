1918607,3,B0000CDRW4,"[Includes Mild Spoilers]

""No Good Deed"" is based on Dashiell Hammett's short (and very short) story titled ""The House on Turk Street"" which is included in his book ""The Continental Op.""  The original short story appeared in 1924, but as is often the case with film adaptations, the story is extended to cover its running time, perhaps stretched beyond its limit.

In this noir film, not an ""op(erative),"" but a cop Jack Friar plays the usual role of reluctant hero.  Jack is asked to search the whereabout of a missing girl when he, being an amateur cellist, is about to join in the classic music festival.  Against his better judgment, he promises to seek for her, and goes to ""the house on Turk Street.""  Too late that he realizes he stepped into the wrong place where he, or any other cops, should not be.

There he encounters a motley group of criminals, who plan to get easy money.  Captured by them, Jack has only his brain to rely on, to get away from this big trouble.

Be warned.  This is a noir film, which means you cannot look for any conherent logics (can anyone summerize the plot of ""Maltise Falcon""?)  There are so many incredible decisions the characters make, or so many unbelievable coincidences.  If you don't like these kinds of situations too good to be true, just forget about the film.

But the film looks beautiful as noir, and director is Bob Rafelson, who recently gave us atomospheric ""Blood and Wine.""  ""No Good Deed"" has also equally credible sinister atmosphere, thanks to production designer Paul Peters and photographer Juan Luiz-Anchia.  If you love this genre, you might find the film  more engaging than other movie fans do.

As to actors.  Sam Jackson is as good as ever (have we seen bad Sam Jackson?) but his actions sometimes lack convincing touch, not because of his acting, but because of the plot (Amazon's editorial review is perfectly right).  As a femme fatale Erin who must survive, using whatever method she can grab, you can see Milla Jovovich, whom I thought, though she is doing her best, still slightly is miscast.  But some people might find otherwise, so leave it to other reviewers.

More interesting and funny is the couple of Mr./Mrs. Quarre, played by Joss Ackland and Grace Zabriskie.  They are simply amusing to see, with the wicked humor only those veterans can show.  Oh, and I almost forgot to say that Stellan Skarsgard is the leader of the criminal group, whose character is always full of menace hidden under his calm attitude.  He makes a great contrast with Doug Hutchison's most dangerous computer wiz that appeared on the screen.

""No Good Deed"" is not good indeed, but its characters are drawn farily well, and the film manages to show some nice atomosphere of noir films.  I don't think not many people have seen it, and that is understandable, but those who like the genre will find it pretty interesting.

By the way, in the film, you hear an old song ""I'm not Your Stepping Stone"" originally played by the Monkees.  Of course, Bob Rafelson was producer of this popular TV series (1966-68), and the version you hear here is performed by Peter Rafelson, his son who is also known for Madonna song.",1067731200,15,3171,4.695652173913044

It is about a serious cop (Samuel L. Jackson) looking for a particular suspect but ending up being kidnapped and threatened.

1918621,2,B0000CDRW4,"No Good Deed, 2003 film

A man plays a cello, then tests his blood sugar. A neighbor calls Jack for help, her daughter ran away with a sleazy man who lives on Turk Street. Jack asks people if they recognize the girl in a picture. None do. He helps an old lady with her groceries (what can go wrong?). We learn about the inhabitants in that house. The conversations tells about these people and their characters. Will things go as planned? Brunch is served. There is a personal conflict among the gang members. [Who doesnt fit in?] The gang prepares to leave in advance of schedule. That young man does his electrical work at the bank. Banker David meets Tyrone. Will something go wrong with their plan? Erin plays the piano, Jack the cello. What next? The money transfer is done at the bank, David keeps the floppy disk with the data. The gang leaves for their destination while the rain falls. Jack shows his temper! Erin has a problem with the telephone.

Can Jack use a wood dowel to trap Erin? Can Jack get free of his bonds? Not if someone shows up. Erin goes to meet David. Then there is more personal conflict! His fifteen minutes were up. There is drama in using that laptop. Tyrone decides to drive to Albany, fewer members mean a bigger split. We learn about Erins personality. Tyrone controls that young man, Erin manipulates both of them. Can a kitchen tool save Jack? Jack explains the scheduling problem to Tyrone. Then the old couple appears! Jack offers a deal to Tyrone. Will it work? Tyrone explains how to send $10 million in small amounts to avoid attention. Jacks badge allows him to avoid traffic. Mr. Abernathy picks up his checks at the drive-thru window. [No suspicions raised?] Jack knows how to switch license plates. They arrive at the border. Will something go wrong? Erin offers a deal to Jack, will he take it? Will Erin walk away to enjoy the loot?

There is a saying in New York City: no good deed goes unpunished. It means people who try to help a stranger suffer for it. Its a common scam for a crook to ask for help in order to get a victim. New Yorkers are cold and cynical because its a survival technique. Its different in small towns. This movie runs on too long, or, could use a better script. This story is loosely based on a Dashiell Hammett short story The House on Turk Street (in San Francisco). Im sure the story is better than this adaption; read it for yourself. Your Public Library probably has a book with Dashiell Hammetts short stories. A leader can get a gang together to commit a crime, its the splitting of the loot afterwards that creates problems.",1408579200,,2605,4.503171247357294
1918622,5,B0000CDRW4,The movie careens you to an understanding of how someone can mistakenly stumble into a person's life and ultimately alter their own.  It is good not to compromise life the way that it is because there are no shortcuts in reality.,1404691200,2,229,4.585365853658536
1918623,5,B0000CDRW4,"I saw a small bit of ""No Good Deed"" on television recently and realized that this was a Samuel L. Jackson film I had never seen or heard of.  I am used to seeing Mr. Jackson play cops but what drew me to the film was his love for the cello. I HAD to purchase this dvd just to see how this seemingly lonely cop/musician turned out.  It did not hurt, either, that this film also included Doug Hutchison (doing his Doug Hutchison ""thing"" that he is so good at). If you are a Samuel L. Jackson or Milla Jovovich fan, you should add this dvd to your collection.  I also got an explanation from the merchant who sold me this dvd, through Amazon, telling me why no invoice was included.  What a nice gesture.  I would purchase from this vendor again.  Thank you.",1401321600,2,755,4.208333333333333

1918631,4,B0000CDRW4,"To just only think about Bob Rafelson directing this film is by itself a solid warranty. That' s what it made to pay attention to this solid policeman  that deals with a diabetic and cellist police officer who spends his holydays trying to perform Johannes Brahms `  Trio Op. 8, when suddenly his neighbor wants for him to help her to search his missed daughter. He will refuse, but soon h3 will change of mind and so he will live one of these awful experiences that the fate keeps for all who preserve the white room of the law.

Soon he will get involved about a very careful plan to robe 10 millions $, and the quartet formed nobody trusts in each other. A wounded and mentally disturbed woman, a repressive husband, and two other who pretend her each one to his own, will absorb you in this intriguing movie, plenty of those psychological devices that one really appreciates. Suggestive work illumination conforms a very advisable film to watch over and over.

Recommended without reserves, but never a classic.",1174262400,6,1015,4.653631284916201
1918632,1,B0000CDRW4,"It started off good and then it went to crap all the way threw. Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard With A Vengenace) plays a cop who is helping out a mother of a lost child. So he sets out in search of her and ends up being taken hostage and tied to a chair. From there on it was too far too with stand. I couldn't bare the fact that Jackson signed up for this gargantuan of a bomb. Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil Apocalypse, The Fifth Element) seems like she is  still is in Resident Evil. Stellan Skarsgard (Deep Blue Sea, The Exorcist The Beginning) is boring as hell as Tyrone. Doug Hutchison (Bait) dies the same way he did in The Salton Sea...with something in his neck. Those old people were just too annoying and so was this. I was tempted to stop and rewind and send it back to the store but then Jovovich in the shower keeped me from doing it and then I said screw it and watched the rest. Ughhhhh is all I half to say.

1918633,4,B0000CDRW4,"The script pecks in every conceivable direction, and a few inconceivable ones, but surely not as terribly as the reviews would suggest. It held my attention throughout its winded course.

 The suspense scenes are fabulously constructed, revolving around universally appealing themes -- bank heist, kidnapping, layered romance, betrayal, and above all, some fabulous twists.

  Part of the slick fun is trying to figure out what the characters have up their individual sleeves, what surprising turn each may have to dish out. Result, an alluring semi-noir in which the audience is not privy in advance to how they'll all get away with it, or even who the good or the bad guys are.

  Towards the end, we fall into the net of one gratuitous turn too many, which the eventually simplistic plot clearly did not have an appetite to digest, but hey, overall it is pretty cleverly done. Renting, at least, may be a good deed indeed.",1091232000,6,925,4.884615384615385
