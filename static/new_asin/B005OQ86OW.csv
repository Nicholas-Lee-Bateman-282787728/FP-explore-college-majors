8481680,5,B005OQ86OW,"I waited so long for ""You Will Be My Son"" to come to the U.S. and I was NOT disappointed!!!!
Summary: A father continues a successful international wine business when his grown son believes he is under-appreciated and under-utilized. The son is ready for more responsibility--in hopes for taking over the business one day--but the father sees only shortcomings and disaster. A neighbor down the road (who works for the father) contracts cancer, which fetches his son from America. In an odd twist, the neighbor's son excels in the wine industry (although he is not yet established), which the wealthy father notices. I won't mention anything else since the developments are fascinating!
Reflection: I've never seen a movie broach the balance between family and business before, and it does a wonderful job showing the perversity of rejecting family for business. The Gilles Legrand's fictional lesson is well-timed in this modern era where one might find posthumous renown/success in industry more alluring than success in the family unit. Of course (like in a lot of French cinema), the acting is phenomenal, and Lorant Deutsch (the wealthy father's son) powerfully portrays the passion and confusion boiling in a neglected son. The themes require honest reflection and digestion. Well worth watching. And buying :)",1386892800,,1316,5.241706161137441
8481681,3,B005OQ86OW,"I'm a sucker for anything set in the French countryside.  There are many wonderful films that feature happy families sitting outside in the sunshine  around a table loaded with food and wine enjoying the good life.  To me that's the picture of Heaven on Earth.  So when I read that this film was set in a winery in Bordeaux  I was at the theater the first day it played.  So, admittedly my expectations may have been a little too high.

The story is good.  It features an older, Lear like father who is faced with the problem of who to turn over his winery to.  It has been in his family for eleven generations, it is huge, and successful.  He is in his late 60's and his foreman and right hand man has just been diagnosed with late stage cancer.  He has one son, a dutiful boy, who has a degree is viniculture from the university but who is the exact opposite in temperament from the father.  Pere is loud, impressive, super-confident, charming, and  huge-in-girth.  Think Hemingway/Orson Welles.. Fils is shy, dutiful, physically unimposing and... likes to jog. Think Woody Allen/""Gopher"" from ""Love Boat.""

Enter the son of the foreman, back from California where he works for Coppola's vineyard (!) to visit his dying father. He is charming, confident and gorgeous. (Think Matthew McConaughy.)  The vintner sees in him a perfect reflection of himself and everything that his son lacks.

The tale unfolds at a good pace, the actors are all first rate, and it winds up in a satisfying way.  The problem I had was that no one is very happy, the buildings on the estate are huge but furnished in a very mundane way.  There are no sunny picnics on the grass, the harvest of the grapes is not joyous--just big business.  The people are all at one another's throats.  The characters were realistic but other than the much maligned son, none of them is shown in a very sympathetic light.  The old guy, despite his acclaim (he is awarded a medal of the Legion of Honor) is really a monster.  For all of the hype about the qualities of his wines ""an earthy mixture of citrus, musk, wild roses.....etc."" I didn't get any real love for the country, the way of life or even the wine.  It was a product and a sign of this guy's outsized ego.  No joie de vivre here.

I give it three stars for the good performances.  But even though it was meant to be a deeply involving human drama I left feeling curiously unmoved. And a little sad that maybe the beautiful way of life that once existed has turned into another grim business.  I sure hope not.",1379894400,3,2535,4.487964989059081
