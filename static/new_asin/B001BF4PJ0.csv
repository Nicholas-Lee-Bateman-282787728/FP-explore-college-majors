3491388,5,B001BF4PJ0,"I grew up in a Polish community in the U.S., but was never interested in my Polish heritage until I saw  Mazowsze.  Then I was hooked.  The songs and the dances were so magfinicent that I fell in love with Poland itself.  The Mazowsze Polish Folk Song and Dance Ensemble is definitely Poland's # 1 ambassador !!

  Not only do they perform the 5 National dances of Poland (yes, the only country in the world that has Five... because music is so much an important part of the culture), but Mazowsze also performs songs and dances from the 40 distictive ethnographic regions of Poland, in beautiful costumes from each region.

  This is the first time in their 62 year history that a DVD has been recorded for sale.  There have been CD's, TV shows, and film appearances (most notedly the film: A Wife for the Australian which is a comedy about a man who comes to Poland to find a wife and falls in love with a singer from Mazowsze... the film is full of songs and dances from Mazowsze), however the stage is where Mazowsze is best seen, and their artistic director, actress Mira Ziminska-Sygietynska wanted to keep it that way.

  Fortunately the group is embracing the 21st century, not only with this DVD, but there is now a theater complex at Mazowsze's compound, an estate outside of Warsaw, called Karolin.

  This DVD is wonderful. ^_^

  Of course there is much more to Mazowsze than you see here, so check out the many CD's with their music.

  Also check out these blogs which tell their story, and show other video clips from live performances, etc.

3491389,5,B001BF4PJ0,Item as described and is wonderful to watch!!  Thank you...  =) This is one of my Dad's favorites now!,1287273600,,102,4.315789473684211
3491390,3,B001BF4PJ0,"If I were to rate this DVD on the performances alone, I would give it 6 stars (if there were 6 to give) the music ranges from cute/funny to happy/athletic to political (the ""coachman"" which asks the powers in control of Poland to treat the populace fairly) to beautiful (hush-hush, this song is stunning in it's beauty) the costumes are gorgeous (I feel sorry for the performers as some of the Ladys costumes weigh as much as 32 LBS. although watching them you would never know it) this is a PBS video/DVD so the fact that it's stereo comes as no surprise, although the large orchestra and gigantic hall screems out for surround sound to get the feeling you're there, it was shot in Hi Def, but there is no BLU-RAY to show it off to maximum effect, guess PBS doesn't expect to sell enough to make BLU-RAY financially worthwhile.  what is surprising, and the reason for not giving the disc a higher rating, is the sloppy camera work, and editing that should have gotten the responsible party fired, and the video done over, the editor has upon multiple occasions inserted views of the audience, right in the middle of the action, there is no need to show the audience at any time other then at the end of a routine when the performers are bowing/exiting the stage, it adds nothing and detracts from the performances, the camera people constantly move in for extreme closeups at the wrong times, often while tricks are being performed, effectively preventing the viewer from seeing what is going on, in one dance the men are doing cart-wheels using not the floor but with the support of the ladys to do them, of course the camera moves in and destroys the moment cutting off the action so you only get a glimps of one man doing this when there are several lined up to do the same, there is a long list of such amature work, however, do not get the idea that I don't like the disc, I do, I'm just disappointed that it wasn't done better, instead of an  average video/DVD, this could have been reference quality with just a little more work and thought, buy it for the performances and music, the colorful and gorgeous costumes, and enjoy it from that viewpoint, just be aware that PBS does and has done better with the technical end",1284940800,,2229,4.514851485148514

8283091,5,B001BF4PJ0,I saw this program on PBS awhile ago.  Bought one for my brother and decided to get one for myself.  It was a wonderful program and glad to have it on DVD to watch again and again.,1419811200,,180,3.8378378378378377
8283092,5,B001BF4PJ0,"The troop and the dancing brought back memories of my youth, and the dancing that I both performed and watched. The singing also brought back vivid memories of times gone by. An excellent production of folk music, songs and dance numbers. I only wish that it could have gone on and on.",1417996800,,285,4.5
8283093,5,B001BF4PJ0,"I first saw this on my PBS station a few years ago and was thrilled to find it at Amazon. Being of Polish ancestry, I am fascinated by the true and authentic folk music,costumes, and customs that Mazowsze bring to life. What an incredibly talented cast of dancers and singers this is! I would definitely recommend this DVD [ the Mazowsze Christmas Kolendy CD is wonderful too!] . You don't have to be Polish to enjoy anything Mazowsze.",1410220800,,435,4.589743589743589

8283095,5,B001BF4PJ0,"I originally saw the video on our local PBS station. I then saw the troupe perform live. I love folk music and dance, and Mazowsze is one of the best folk ensembles in the world. They have energy, humor, and virtuosity. Their costumes are stunning. I bought three copies of the video for myself and two relatives. The video is not just for Polish-Americans. I'm Irish, and I sometimes use the video to pick up my spirits when I'm feeling down.",1389139200,,443,4.481481481481482
8283096,4,B001BF4PJ0,"Had seen this performance live and though the DVD is a little shy on some of the more enjoyable acts, the DVD is still satisfactory.",1363651200,,132,4.32
