5690837,4,B00C5TC3HM,"This is not a slasher/gore fest kind of movie. It starts out funny and gets gross. It also made me think about things I don't typically watch with these kinds of films. If you are looking for something different, I say go for it!",1366761600,2,229,4.2272727272727275
5690838,2,B00C5TC3HM,Movie title was too funny  - hadt to check it out.  Wish I could get back the time spent watching it,1366588800,,100,3.7142857142857144
8577460,2,B00C5TC3HM,"Neat idea for a movie, but not much to see here. Art is a major theme, but we see none of it. Without offering us anything in that area, or portraying the cannibal scenes in any detail, the film fails to deliver where it matters most. Lame.",1529971200,,240,4.127659574468085
8577461,4,B00C5TC3HM,It had just the right balance between campy horror and black comedy. I really enjoyed it.  I just wish they would have shown the art they kept referencing. I want to know what the painting looks like.,1501286400,,200,4.405405405405405

8577464,4,B00C5TC3HM,"After an accident a decade ago, renowned Danish painter Lars Olafssen (Thure Lindhardt) lost his muse, and hasn't produced anything noteworthy since. In an effort to abandon the professional art world altogether, he seeks refuge in Koda Lake, a remote Canadian town, where he accepts a teaching position at a struggling art school. Yet despite Olafssen's best efforts, everyone from the overzealous school administrator (Alain Goulem) to his seedy agent (Stephen McHattie) are hoping he will once again pick up a brush, yet all he can do is stare at a blank canvas. But that changes after he takes in one of his adult students, Eddie (Dylan Scott Smith), whose curious nocturnal habit turns out to be just the inspiration he needs to paint once again. But how far is Olafssen willing to go for the sake of his art?

Shot outside of Ottawa, ""Eddie"" was directed by Boris Rodriguez, who also wrote the screenplay; this was based on a story by Jon Rannells, which was originally about a novelist who finds his muse in a werewolf's killing spree. Released on Blu-ray as ""Eddie: The Sleepwalking Cannibal,"" the title and marketing material alone should give you a good idea of what to expect from this Canada-Denmark co-production--and you won't be disappointed. It's a horror-black comedy where ""Fargo"" meets ""Shaun of the Dead,"" except that the traditional zombie is replaced by a living human named Eddie. He's an adult mute who witnessed a horrible tragedy in his childhood, to the point that whenever he faces an upsetting situation, he tends to sleepwalk--and ends up killing and eating any living thing that crosses his path.

Eddie's peculiar nocturnal activity is well known to those responsible for bringing Olafssen to Koda Lake, including a fellow instructor (Georgina Reilly) who has no problem with the two sharing a living space. It seems they're all willing to turn a blind eye to the increasing body count once they realize that a reinvigorated Olafssen will provide a major boon to the art school, as well as the community--and even the artist himself succumbs to the thrall of his new muse. Koda Lake's sole police officer (Paul Braunstein) seems to be the only one concerned about the increasing number of disappearances around town.

In fact, it's this ambiguity towards Eddie's activities that makes the slow reveal of each character's motivation all the more interesting. You'd think that someone who kills and eats other humans would be the antagonist of the story, but Eddie is just a pawn in a larger scheme to sell paintings. The film poses questions about the correlation between violence and creativity, the sleaziness of the corporate art world, and the importance of sacrificing everything for your art. But these serious topics are given a light touch, with a few appropriate jabs here and there; this is, after all, a satire.

Although this fun story may move slowly at times, it's recommended viewing for fans of horror-comedies, especially for those who like humour at its very dry best.",1407628800,,3017,4.98015873015873
8577465,5,B00C5TC3HM,it was worth ordering and watching.  love the comic horror humor movie.  didn't get bored watching it.  came in quickly also.,1388966400,,125,4.857142857142857
8577466,4,B00C5TC3HM,"I enjoyed it, but wait for a rainy day where you don't have ANYTHING else to do.  The ending had a good twist.",1368748800,,110,3.782608695652174
8577467,4,B00C5TC3HM,"Who says a horror flick can't have a sprinkle of comedy? This dry humored comedy-horror, Eddie: The Sleepwalking Cannibal had me fixated to the screen. Not only is Lars super attractive, Eddie was written as a lovable killer which is AWESOME. I recommend this movie to 10-50 year old couples looking for a thrill and to test their dates humor.",1366848000,4,343,4.733333333333333
8577468,5,B00C5TC3HM,"I'm a huge fan of horror, but not that big a fan of your typical Holywood horror-comedy. Eddie is funny, endearing and thought-provoking... and gory. Although it's not the unwarranted type of gore you see in the Walking Dead. It's a fun ride. I loved the unstated question - what would happen if you met your muse but your muse is a sleepwalking cannibal? Also my favorite exchange in the movie is: Lars: ""He eats small animals in his sleep?"" Leslie: ""It's not as bad as it sounds."" Lars: ""...it sounds pretty bad..."" Watch it, enjoy it, dare to laugh.",1366761600,5,552,4.53
8577469,4,B00C5TC3HM,"When I first heard the title of this film, I'll admit, I chuckled. But after watching 'Eddie', I realized how much more complex this horror-comedy flick really was. I was really impressed with the acting of the main character who conveyed so much through body language (it can't be easy to play a mute, nonetheless a sleepwalking, cannibalistic mute!). It you are into campy films, and have a stomach for a bit of blood, I say watch it!",1366761600,2,436,4.602564102564102
