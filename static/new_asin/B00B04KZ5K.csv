5538916,5,B00B04KZ5K,"I have all the Tonique workout dvds. Born to move( BTM) is the toughest one! Sylwia says she's the source of our positive pain and she wasn't lying! The moves move smoothly from one to the other, the lunges, squats and moves where you're hanging halfway to the floor while pushing your leg up really target your butt, thighs, arms. every part of my body works! This is an Advanced workoout and even htough i've been Toniquing for years now this is a challenge for me! Sylwia is her usual funny, encouraging self and makes me squat and lunge lower, and at the end of the workout i feel energetic but still thoroughly worked out.
The results are absolutely amazing! I have flat abs, a firm body and great muscle definition. i'll even go as far as saying that i look better now post baby and in my late twenties than I looked evenn as a teenager.
Tonique works, run and get this and don't give up! the results will definitely shock you.",1365811200,8,933,4.398843930635838
5538917,5,B00B04KZ5K,"Born to Move is one of Sylwia's newest dvds.  Oh boy!  It is challenging!  It will take me a long time to be able to work up to it.  At my age, Energy Mat is more doable for me, but I am attempting to do as much of this one as I can!

In my opinion, even the best athlete will find this one a challenge.  Sylwia always pushes us to the limit and this one will push you believe me!!!",1365724800,7,382,3.654320987654321
5538918,5,B00B04KZ5K,"I have several of Slywia's dvd's - and in my opinion, this new dvd is her most
challenging, creative and effective one yet!

I consider myself to be an advanced level of exerciser. I truly love this
dvd!!! It's exteemly high quality. It's soooo highly effective.

Girls, it will give you the MOST SEXIEST curves - above any other dvd out there.

I have tons of workout dvds - if I counted my collection, I'm sure I have
at least 100. I have done all kinds of workouts...everything from kettle
bells, step, rebounding, ballet bar. (Jari Love, Cathe Fredrich, Laren
Brooks, Tracy Anderson...to name a few) I have my favorites and they are the ones that get real results.

This dvd is unique in that IT WILL GIVE YOU CURVE DEFINITION that's unlike
any other dvd out there. I truly mean this.

I don't remember the last time I ever gave a review for any workout dvd.
After doing this dvd for just a few weeks, my hips became very beautifully defined - like a fine piece of art - if I do say so myself.....ha ha.. And, my rear has NEVER had such a lift before!!! It's seriously defined.

This is why I have pushed aside my other favorite dvds and favor hers. I know results when I see them. In addition to doing Slywia's dvds, I also do Laren Brooks kettle bell dvds. I love to do kettle bell also because it also delivers great results - but in different ways.

In addition to the incredible results I have experienced, I also enjoy the fact that her exercise moves unlike any that I see in other dvds...they are very creative. She uses dynamic stretching and when I am doing her workouts, I feel like it reaches ""EVERY"" part of my entire body. I don't get this feeling from other dvds. I'm certain that this is why I see such high definition.

I love Slywia's personality. She is beautiful - from the inside out. You can tell that she really cares about her work and her passion to help others.

When I workout, I get up at 4:30 am and I don't want to waste my time doing workouts that aren't serious. Every workout on this dvd is ""SERIOUS"" .... I'm breathing hard and struggling but I know that's a good thing. I almost always have to pause the dvd at various points to catch my breath.

I love the plain white background in this dvd, Slywia's choice of clothing (would love to see a clothing line), and I also really enjoy the music she has chosen. All are tasteful and easy on the eyes and ears.

I am looking forward to her next dvd - the sooner the better. In my opinion, they are all really good and tough; but this set is the toughest.

One final comment, I also have her new mat workout and it's incredible also. I rotate between both these new workouts. I've never seen a matt workout like hers before. It's also just as challenging, effective and creative as this dvd.",1362873600,22,2775,4.335907335907336
5538919,5,B00B04KZ5K,"Sylwia's Tonique workouts are some of my favorite workouts, and I am in love with this new one!  I ordered it  directly from the Tonique website a few weeks back, and have been using it two times a week, with great results. It (along with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Body-Workout-Series-5-DVD-Set/dp/B00BACDFHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Body Workout Series 5 DVD Set</a>&nbsp;set workouts) has already been helping me slim down my thighs and tone my legs and rear end.  It's an advanced workout, there's no doubt about it, but it's fun and effective!

If you like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sylwia-Wiesenberg-s-Tonique-Premier-DVD/dp/B003WKT7RC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sylwia Wiesenberg's Tonique Premier DVD</a>, you will love this workout!  I have all of Sylwia's workouts, but the Tonique Premier one has been my favorite of them all -- with Born to Move now tying for first place!  While she was filming this new Born to Move workout, she mentioned on her Facebook page that it would be closest to Premier, with lots of lunges and squats.  This is definitely the case!  While&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tonique-2-Fitness-Workout-Sylwia-Wiesenberg-DVD/dp/B003COAA2O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tonique 2 Fitness Workout - Sylwia Wiesenberg DVD</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tonique-Sculpt-Dynamics-with-Sylwia-Weisenberg/dp/B006WPDFD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tonique Sculpt Dynamics with Sylwia Weisenberg</a>&nbsp;have a lot of jumping in them, this one (like Premier) focuses on lunges and squats, but it's very low-impact.  I have a tendency towards tendonitis in my right knee and have a hard time especially doing Sculpt Dynamics, but this new Born to Move set is easy on the knees -- even though it's tough on the heart in terms of its cardio effect!

Since some people don't like Premier, it might be good to hunt down some clips of this new workout before purchasing it.  Personally, I get into a ""zone"" while doing Premier and the segments from Born to Move, and love just working along with the rhythm of the moves.

To do this workout, you will just need a pair of 1- or 2-pound weights and an exercise mat.  While I had a set of 2-pound weights, I ended up buying a new pair that is about three inches longer than my original pair.  (I bought these ones at a local store&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reebok-Rubber-Hex-Dumbbell/dp/B008R5HS8W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reebok Rubber Hex Dumbbell</a>.)  That additional length helps me do some of the moves a lot better, especially the ones where she has you balance the weights on the floor and kick one leg back.

This disk has three workouts on it.  The first part of Born to Move (which I'll call 1.1) is about 70 minutes long, and the second part (1.2) is about 40 minutes long. Sylwia designed for these to be one long workout, but there is an option on the main menu to do them separately, which is what I usually do.  In 1.1, she has you doing lots of lunges, and you end up working each individual leg for about 25 minutes, which is quite the killer!  If you need to work up to doing the full 25 minutes on each leg, Sylwia said that you can alternate by doing about 10 lunges on each side, before moving to the next side.

Workout 1.2 also focuses on lunges and squats, with lots of variations.  Since there is no real warm-up for 1.2, I've been doing a few minutes of her Energy Stretch to warm up.

Workout 2 is my favorite of the three workouts!  It is about 53 minutes long, and has more variations on lunges.

Also included is her 30-minute Energy Stretch workout, which is like a mini-workout on its own.  It has a lot of dynamic moves, and is done mostly on a mat.

There is also an overall focus on balance in all three workouts, and a good focus on core.

Since this is a tough workout, I'd suggest starting with 1.2 since it's the easiest of the three segments on BTM.  One you get comfortable with it, Workouts 1.1 and 2 will be easier to manage.

Throughout the set, Sylwia speaks in a voiceover, and she offers lots of encouragement, advice, and form pointers.  She is such a sweetheart, and her encouragement is fantastic and helps you really get through these tough workouts!  She really wants to help women succeed in their fitness goals, and her positive energy really comes through in Born to Move!  She mentions at one point that she filmed all three workouts in one day and that she filmed/worked out for about eight hours -- and I can't help but feel that she is Superwoman!  :-)

If you go to her website, she has also posted several new rotations that use this new Born to Move workout, her new Energy Mat workout, and the other Tonique videos.

All in all, if you're looking for something to kick up your workouts a notch and to challenge yourself, this is a great DVD to own!",1358208000,30,5042,5.29937106918239
8560003,5,B00B04KZ5K,"Sylwia is one of the toughest trainers in the world. She knows what she is doing and her body is amazing. I have several of her videos from Tonique, Tonique2, Addicted to Movement, Tonique Royale and her Hawaii Collection. I do her workouts 2x a week and it's challenging, repetitive and you want to quite but don't. Keep at it and in time your body will change. Everyone needs a Sylvia DVD in their collection.",1509235200,,411,4.493333333333333
8560004,5,B00B04KZ5K,"Being a huge fan of Tonique , I bought this workout to add to my collection and keep challenging myself. After using it for a couple of months, my legs and butt never looked better. And I've tried just about every workout on the market. This workout is hard as hell, and very advanced. I have to stop multiple times to catch my breath and wipe off the pouring sweat! I love it. It gives me something to work toward, and Slywia is infectious. She motivates you to not give up. If you are at an intermediate fitness level, you can do this workout. Each workout on the disc is different. And they all deliver a killer workout. I will keep doing these for as long as my knees and hips hold out. (Hopefully till I'm 80!)  They never bore me!!",1497484800,2,737,4.226950354609929
8560005,1,B00B04KZ5K,Did not care for this workout dvd. It was just her & her shadow.  I bought 4 of her dvds & I don't like any of them. They are tough so I'm sure they work. I just get bored with her dvds. Her dvds are costly also.,1423958400,3,212,3.5106382978723403
8560006,2,B00B04KZ5K,"I really wanted to like this,as I really enjoyed many of the other Tonique dvds but staying on 1 leg for so many reps was just killer on my knees. I tried this dvd several times and even modified quite a bit but ultimately my 40 something year old body just wasn't up for the challenge.",1410480000,,286,4.125
8560007,5,B00B04KZ5K,very fast service thank you. enjoy the work out however it is very long and hard. but worth the effort and time,1388361600,,111,4.090909090909091
8560008,3,B00B04KZ5K,"I think this is a great workout if you have the stamina to stand in one place on one leg for 35 minutes and then switch and do it over again. I can see were you would get results, but this is a slow workout on the basis of you work on one leg for 35 minutes and then switch to the other leg. The movements aren't fast and it totals 70 minutes which is a lot of time to devote to your legs. She also has a ab workout on here that is after the legs and is additional time, but for me after 70 minutes of leg standing and swinging I was done. Maybe if I build up to it or can get stop focusing on how bored I was I can make it to the ab section.",1385251200,9,642,3.592857142857143
8560009,5,B00B04KZ5K,I have all of Sylwia's workouts and I think they are all wonderful and wonderfully hard! This is a bit more intense than her others but I love the challenge. I also really like the length-not that I would ever do the whole thing through in one session! I like to either select a specific workout or on days that I'm feeling like pushing it I like to just hit play all and see how far I get! One gripe is about the dvd itself. I bought and returned 2 of these due to the workout pausing at minute 10:27 then skipping to minute 21. The third one does it too but I just rewind to 10:27 and it plays from there. Frustrating and for the price I expect it to play straight through. I love it so much though that I just deal with it. I really highly recommend this and all of Sylwia's workouts!,1382659200,4,787,4.051282051282051
8560010,5,B00B04KZ5K,"I have all the Tonique workouts and this new one is one of my favourites because it's challenging, motivating and makes you feel so good about yourself when you're done.  I love a good workout especially the ones that makes you feel like you accomplished something great.  This workout is similar to the Premiere workout but the new moves added are very different than anything you've ever seen and they are challenging but doable.  You can go at your own pace and not do as many reps at first.  What this doesn't have is a floor segment like Premier but that's okay because the BTM package comes with two DVDs.  On the first DVD is segments 1a (about 1 hour 13 minutes) and 1b (about 38 minutes) and an Energy Stretch section.  The second DVD has BTM 2 (about 53 minutes) and the Energy Stretch.  If you're up for it you can do all three but that would mean you're not human like Sylwia.  Most of us would do either one of the three or maybe two but that would be it.  I love the energy Sylwia brings to her workouts and her words are encouraging and you know it comes from a genuine place.  I never thought I would say this about any workout but I am addicted to Tonique and look forward to working out with Sylwia, via my T.V., and sweating like crazy.  I'm not bored with the selection of Tonique workouts I have.  I rotate between the ones I have.

I've lost a total of 38 lbs in a period of one year (most of it came off after 8 months) after having my 3rd baby and it's all thanks to Tonique and feeding my body the nutrients it needs so I can continue these workouts.  I feel good about myself and what I've accomplished so far but am not stopping, there really is  not limit for you and your body.  I've noticed how strong and firm my legs have become and not only that but how toned and more defined they look.  I also notice this in my arms and my abs.

I started with the Mat video, then moved to Premiere, Sculpt Dynamics, Cardiomat and T2.  I love them all including the other new one Energy Mat.  Yes the workouts are challenging but anything worth having is worth fighting for and requires your commitment.",1375401600,20,2122,4.2575
8560011,5,B00B04KZ5K,"This workout is very challenging verging on 2 hours long, but it can be broken up into two 1 hour workouts. It is a great workout that is a body workout. This is great for people who are intermediate fitness levels, not beginners.",1373932800,4,230,4.372093023255814
8560012,5,B00B04KZ5K,"I like this video because the majority of the tape focuses on the legs/gluts. She does alot of reps so you need to be prepared for that. I have a decent endurance background and can only make it half way through the video, so in a way it gives me a short term goal to work toward (finishing the video).",1366156800,5,302,4.05
