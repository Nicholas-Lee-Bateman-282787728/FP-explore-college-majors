8608763,3,B00ERH13A8,"Here we have a film which was absorbed within the influx of Euro Westerns released after the success of Director Sergio Leone's'DOLLARS' trilogy, Director Alfonso Balcazar's 'THE MAN WHO CAME TO KILL' aka 'L'UOMO DALLA PISTOLA D'ORO' aka 'THE MAN WITH THE GOLD PISTOL' aka 'HANDS OF STEEL'-1966. German actor Carl Mohner who played the villain in Director Sergio Bergonzelli's 'THE LAST GUN' aka 'JIM IL PRIMO'-1964 plays a gunfighter wanting to go straight.  He assumes the identity of a dead notorious outlaw and teams up with a marshall played by Luis Davila who would go on to grace Director Cesare Canavari's memorable cult Western 'MATALO'-1971  to defeat sleazebag Reyes played by scene stealer and everyone's favorite Mexican bandit - Fernando Sancho.  The female beauty is supplied by Gloria Milland and Irene Mir and you will also spot Euro favorite Umberto Raho in the mix.  It's a fair run of the mill plot which would be the start of a sub genre of Westerns concerning bad guys seeing the error of their ways and deciding to become sheriffs,marshals ,etc. usually swayed by a gorgeous female character or by becoming men of the cloth turning their priestly collars around when the gunplay ensues.  It has a haunting score by Angelo Francesco Lavagnino which adds to the proceedings.  Unfortunately, the film is released by Thunder Island films which transfers the film in full screen losing Photographer Mario Capriotti's 2.35 aspect ratio making his compositions flat and static.  The quality is,however,quite good culled from a blemish/scratch free English dubbed print so if you don't mind the full screen intensity, it makes a good title for Euro Western collectors until a widescreen copy comes along(yeah, right!),  A slide show of scenes from the film is the only extra.",1389225600,3,1790,5.0646258503401365
