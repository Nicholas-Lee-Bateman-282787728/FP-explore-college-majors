2639534,5,B000HOJR8A,"I think ""The Exodus Decoded"" was excellent.  Up until this time, I thought Exodus was just a great story.  It makes sense that the Egyptians would have documented these extraodinary events, if indeed, they took place. I think it is amazing that they found geological evidence, the volcanic eruptions at Santorini, that could have caused the plagues and parting of the Reed Sea. I don't understand why, just because we can explain or demonstrate a natural phenomenon scientifically, that it challenges the existence of God rather than providing insight into his handiwork. To me, a non-church-goer, this deepened my faith. After all, it still doesn't explain how Moses knew the plagues would come, and how he knew to go to the Reed Sea and cross where and when he did. To this day, we cannot predict Tsunami's.  I will leave you with this question (from my mother) to ponder: ""Why is this being revealed to us now?""",1161648000,11,914,4.808917197452229
2639535,5,B000HOJR8A,"You can listen, watch and process the information presented.  While the controversy surrounding the Exodus has existed for thousands of years, there are indeed facts associated with it.

The Producer, James Cameron, and the host, Simcha Jacobovici, an Emmy Award winning filmmaker, pull together and weave a compelling narrative that is historically, scientifically and Biblically engaging.  The science is solid and accurate.  The comparisons between the Bible's account and the review of facts that are pulled together, provide a fresh perspective that is well thought out and appears to be a valid rewrite of the ""scientific"" and ""historical"" record.

This film does NOT attempt to remove God from the story, only that God could have utilized the Earth and its natural forces to affect the outcome of a people and this time in history.

Highly recommended if you are open to a means of defining a Biblical account using science to show what could have really happened, via God's hand (or not).",1160870400,47,996,5.117283950617284
2639536,3,B000HOJR8A,"You don't need to be an expert to quickly get the sense that this filmmaker is too confident in his under researched theories. At one point, he suggests that certain stellas represent the Jews being chased by the Egyptians, based on his objective, common sense viewing of them. Perhaps he is right, but suspicion is not enough to be called science. This guy is a talented storyteller, but a flimsy researcher. If your not too preoccupied with real archaeological research, watch this film and be amazed.",1160179200,14,503,4.8604651162790695
2639537,5,B000HOJR8A,"From minute one the host of this fantastic program engages your mind.  The views are cold and hard edged in that they did not bother to remain politically correct.  Instead they give an awaking view of the events of the Exodus historically, biblically, scientifically and archeologically.  Anyone, Christian or not, could appreciate the lengths to which these brave individuals go by traveling to hostile territory to put to film evidence of this highly debated event of the Exodus.

Tensions build as the Egyptian government's armed presence on site tries to deter the explorers from filming archeological evidence that could very well prove the stories true.  After all if a mighty empire such as the one of the Egyptians was placed in such peril by a group of slaves, it is no wonder they try to keep the truth permanently buried in the sands of the desert.

A must see.  Intriguing!",1157414400,74,886,4.866666666666666

2639586,1,B000HOJR8A,"A work of fiction.  Hard to believe someone took the time and money to make this totally speculative nonsense.  Anyone who knows the Bible will recognize that most of the quotes are absolutely erroneous and purposely misleading.  I would have to say that at least half of the sentences in the narrative are not true at all.  There are no references because if one checks on the things told they will find out that they are non-existent.  Some absurdities are just glaringly ridiculous.  For instance, he claims some of the Israelites who were freed were actually Minoans and that after Mt. Sinai they went back to Greece to Santorini Island which he had just explained blew up in a volcano.  Nice place to settle, huh?  The Bible says that Mt. Sinai is in Arabia.  Arabia!  I can't believe that Jacobovici had no idea that all that he was presenting was hogwash.  Don't waste your time.  Read the Bible.  Watch Bob Cornuke and see where the real Mt. Sinai is and see Patterns of Evidence: Exodus  by Tim Mahoney for real proof of the Exodus.
I will give Jacobovici credit for quoting the Ten Commandments.  In this day that took real courage.",1501372800,3,1142,4.611940298507463
2639587,1,B000HOJR8A,"I really wanted to like Exodus Decoded, but it turns out that the documentary seems to host credible scientific Christians who are attempting desperately to force a scientific explanation for the events that occurred in the Book of Exodus. Without providing too many spoilers, The Exodus Decoded attempts to explain the blood that filled the Nile as a rust a deposit that was triggered by some natural disaster. The problem with this theory is that Moses is supposed to have commanded Arron to place his staff in the water and this was followed immediately by the supernatural contamination of the Nile. This theory then, seems to be another attempt to normalize the supernatural events found in the Book of Exodus as well as make their occurrences natural, rather than supernatural. Normalizing those miraculous events of Exodus only serves to help overactive minds that must complexity the issue  by way of dismissing faith in favor of facts. Faith does not rely upon facts, and this is the problem inherent in all scientific research.",1499212800,3,1037,5.02906976744186

What you will learn from him is that the departing of the waters was not at Red Sea but at the Reed Sea. Possibly a translation error from Hebrew to English? Also he claimed that it was different mountain that Moses received 10 commandments and not from Mt. Sinai. Also he claimed it was not Ramses who reigned at that time but actual a pharoah by name of Ahmose, because tablet Stela mentions a great storm possibly related to Exodus and his first born son died at young age of 12 around time by last plague.",1492214400,,806,4.683098591549296

This movie helped me understand the Exodus better.
In his journey of presenting the biblical scriptures and finding proof of what the bible tells us, I am in awe of how intelligently he presents his finding and matches them up to the biblical records. In his theory of tweaking the dates a little of two stories, you will see that everything matches up and makes absolute sense. The proof is there. This was a great movie that I thoroughly enjoyed.

2639629,2,B000HOJR8A,"It starts with interesting information, but takes a big turn.  Seems try too hard to fit the science into the bible.  Although some scientific evidence provide some plausible explanation, it makes too much assumptions and lacks solid evidence.

Attributes lot of plague related phenomena to that similar incident in Cameroon that caused reddening of water, skin boils, and death (that is massive affecting humans and animals, not selective) - which different from accounts in bible.  Video assumes that first born males were placed on lower level closer to ground which effects of nature ultimately killed - no solid evidence of first born males children sleeping closer to ground level was provided. Video attributes the parting of the sea as result of volcanic eruption and and result of ""mud/land slide"" that allowed water levels to drop - no evidence of such is presented; just speculation.

2639632,1,B000HOJR8A,"I found the whole premise of the video to be extremely sloppy science.  Rather than hard facts, the viewer is presented with innuendo built upon innuendo.  In most cases the viewer is presented with one or two archaeological finds that appear to support the biblical narrative of the Exodus, which then are assumed to be the factual basis of a convoluted theory of the Exodus as the video goes on.  What results is a house of cards that will easily collapse should any contradictory evidence be presented to dispute the findings and presumptions of the producers.  Of course no such contradictory evidence is ever considered.
  Videos such as these do a grave disservice to serious archaeologists who allow the evidence to speak for itself rather than trying to twist and contort it into a preconceived view of history.

The major points brought out in this film question long-held, but potentially incorrect dating of the events of the Exodus.  There is a small but growing group of experts who move the timeline of the Exodus back to circa 1500 BC rather than the conventional circa 1200 BC.  This rolling the date back neatly aligns archeological evidence to the timeframe (also see 'Exodus Revealed' on NETFLIX for more of this opinion).  Simcha also presents a likely candidate for the real Mt. Sinai.  I hope he produces more 'Naked Archeology' in the future and Amazon brings back the old series to Prime.

For us, believers, there is no need for evidence although faith is usually backed up by concrete science, time after time. But this was a LONG stretch and very manipulative way of ""backing up"" the story.

So sad. The ark, for example, is perfectly described in the Bible. It is a mystery where it is, but NOT a mystery how it looks like. The ark was even brought by David and set on a tabernacle where not only priests could see it but a LOT of singers and musicians who offered worship before it prior to it being housed in Solomon's temple.  AND the Bible itself describes that the Hebrews spend 400 years plus in Egypt, not 200. Very superficial way of placing a new date for the events just to match the ""mysterious"" stela and the whole santorino volcano.

2639673,3,B000HOJR8A,"It was OK if watched with a critical eye. Video production was very good. pseudo-scholarly in its repeated treatment of assumptions, possibilities, and interpretations as ""proof"" and in its ""creative"" re-arrangement of chronology. Looked like a typical case of a person who starts with a conclusion and cherry-picks facts to fit that conclusion. Velikovsky approached the same subject, esp. the chronology of events & the interpretation of the 10 plagues. Despite Sagan's somewhat cruel and arrogant condemnation of Velikovsky, I still find his Ages in Chaos and Peoples of the Sea to be far more intriguing than Jacobovici's film, which failed to ""nail"" his conclusions with sufficient evidence.",1461110400,2,696,5.453703703703703

2639676,4,B000HOJR8A,"The majority of criticism for this production, while well intentioned, assumes that everything we know and have been taught is not only true but inviolable--which is in my opinion a more dangerous stance than any potential stretch that Jacobovici might have made during his presentation. I'm neither a biblical scholar nor an archeologist, but I consider myself a competent and thoughtful student. I know enough about certain aspects of this story to know that little of what we have learned fits snugly with other bits and pieces--it's all very much like a shattered stela puzzle with some pieces still missing.

That said, I enjoyed the presentation and the hypothesis behind it. In the end, most of this stuff will inevitably lead us right back where we started: to a simple matter of faith that is no more or less true for its potential as fiction however unlikely some consider it as history.

I do hope that Simcha does not utilize computer technology so much in the future or as a standard.  The information was valid and delivered effectively, for this reason I gave five stars!  I actually prefer the Naked Archeology series over the big production dvd's that Simcha does in coordination with James Cameron.

2639699,4,B000HOJR8A,"I  enjoyed this documentary. What this documentary fails to mention is that the book of Exodus (and many Biblical texts) is a compilation of scriptures from different authors and is not a first-hand account, even though it says it was written by Moses it is actually the sacred priesthood of his tribe. Oral tradition reigned supreme in the actual time of Moses. In addition, the story of Moses' early life (such as his rise to prince-hood from an ark) is an archetypal element of many oral traditions in that time period. It doesn't make the the story any less inspiring.

It was apparent that there was some scrambling of dates to get it all ""aligned"", but seriously I just want to hear somebody intelligent talk about scripture for once. I get so tired of rhetoric dogma blah-ness and crave some truth about the people who lived in this time.

And again, I really enjoyed viewing this documentary, whether or not it was historically accurate. I teared up at the end because hearing scripture always gets me feeling so full of wonder... Even the Ten Commandments.

OH and I freaking loved the connections to Minoan culture, because obviously there was intermingling as they were NOT isolated peoples!  They had boats!!",1452124800,,1220,4.818181818181818

2639701,3,B000HOJR8A,"Please watch Patterns of Evidence: Exodus instead. I found myself enjoying the scientific explanations of the plagues, however this documentary is off the mark. Perhaps made 10 years too early. Biblical explanations were not studied in detail, instead were summarized. I had to stop watching when he says that the Red Sea in the Bible really translates to Reed Sea. The Bible clearly says this particular sea was like an ocean, it was deep, etc. The Bible also says that the water stood up on both sides of the Israelites and covered the Egyptian army where not one survived. They were correct in their initial assumptions, but since they didn't find evidence there, they searched elsewhere. They were initially correct, the ridge in the Red Sea is now assumed to be where the Israelites crossed, since other areas are entirely too steep going a mile down. And evidence has been found of chariot wheels covered with coral. I applaud their effort, but it didn't quite hit the mark. The documentary Patterns of Evidence: Exodus, was made in 2015 and is the best evidence, in my opinion, to date. It is available on Netflix right now.

2639714,4,B000HOJR8A,Excellent logical approach.  Would have been 5 stars except he makes the same mistake others have made trying to apply natural or scientific explanations for the plagues. All in all he nails the point that the Exodus was during the earlier Middle Kingdom and not during the reign of Ramesses II.  This theory has been investigated and substantially added to by others such as Timothy Mahoney in his 2014 documentary 'Pattern of Evidence - Exodus' narrated by Kevin Sorbo.  Combining Mahoeny's investigation of the lower dig in Avarus with Jacobovici's evidence pretty much proves the archaeologists got the time line wrong.,1444867200,,623,5.148514851485149

The earlier date allowed them to use carvings and written history of that time as 'proofs' of the exodus rather than what they actually were- accounts of completely different historical events.

The special effects are really quite excellent.  I learned quite a bit about the time period of and around the Exodus (in so far as that date is known). I find Mr. Jacobovici a most excellent host and a knowledgeable historian/archaeologist. However, the juxtaposition of several historical events used in this theory seems a  bit tight to me (if you watch the documentary this just look at the time line). The number of historical events which have to occur together in a relatively short time frame strike me as statistically unlikely in particular given the imprecision of dating any of these events.  You are basically back at the beginning with Divine Intervention. Mr. Jocobovici is quite honest and does say that many of his contributors/experts do  not agree with his theory.

This short film presents very plausible explanations for the events that occurred and some documentation to back up their claims. It was refreshing to see a short film that actually backs the claims of the bible and presents evidence that the people of the bible existed and the events took place. It helped melt some of my skepticism.

It is difficult to go back into Egyptian history and recreate these events because the Egyptians, as do historians today, only wrote the history they wanted their people to know. When the Egyptians fought the Hittites the pharaoh was lucky to get out alive although you can never read this in the ancient temples of Egypt.

Its unlikely Egypt would ever boast about slaves that escaped and almost destroyed Egypt.",1433030400,2,847,4.834482758620689

But some of his evidence is compelling, especially the Egyptian stela to establish dates, and the site names used to track down a more plausible Mt. Sinai location.

In this movie, Jacobovici investigates many of the stories, and looks carefully at the dates they were supposed to have happened.  He finds that almost all the records agree nicely if you adjust the dates to match historical as well as Biblical accounts.

There was one thing that I felt they did not address in this program that I felt to be highly important in this historical account.....  How did Moses know beforehand that each of the plaques were to take place prior to them being played out? Who was Moses talking to in the burning bush?  Those who adhere to the visitations of advanced beings in the past, (ancient aliens), may find this production another brick in the wall for that possibility.

2639822,2,B000HOJR8A,"Take note of the name Manfred Bietak.  He's a renown German archaeologist who's expertise on the Hyksos pharaohs of Egypt is used as the crux of the entire documentary's false thesis.

Having identified the Hyksos pharaoh, Yacoboam (the biblical Jacob), he establishes the 16th century B.C.E as the time reference for the Hyksos expulsion, i.e. the Exodus.  The journalist/filmmaker, Simcha Jacobovici (aka, the Naked Archaeolgist), uses this to turn the clock back more than 200 years from the generally accepted date of the 14th century B.C.E. for the Exodus occurring in the reign of the pharaoh, Ramases the Great.  At one point, Bietak states that this is a ""conundrum"" but never explains why.

But the reason is obvious to anyone with a rudimentary knowledge of the Bible.  Jacobovici is putting Moses in the same time as Jacob, his generational ancestor.  Of course, the subject of this ""conundrum"" is never broached beyond Bietak's simple conclusion because it negates all of the Old Testament stories and prophets between Jacob and Moses.  This is extremely problematic for any archaeologist, especially one with a religious agenda.

Towards the end, Jacobivici claims to identify the real Mt. Sinai as Hashem el-Tarif.  But he does so without a shred of evidence that can link a 16th century B.C.E, Hyksos presence to that site.  At no time does he state whether the site has ever had any previous research done on it or any collections associated with it.  Instead, Jacobivici plants the impression throughout the program that the Egyptian antiquities authorities operate a closely guarded and armed encampment trying to ""hide"" the evidence either by intent or incompetence.

This sort of bias is essentially propaganda driven by prejudice given the fact that Egyptian antiquities are dominated by European and American universities and academics.  Even so, the recent uncovering of Cleopatra's tomb by a female lawyer from the Dominican Republic is further evidence that Egyptian archaeological  excavations are hardly a closed shop.

Nevertheless, Exodus Decoded does have some redeeming value.  For example, the Greek connection is full of false claims, but not without pointing out the historical connection between the Danaans and the biblical tribe of Dan.  The documentary claims this tribe ""split"" from Moses and settled in Greece but never raises the likelihood of Hyksos colonization of Lower Egypt with origins in Macedonia (home of the Danaans) rather than Canaan.  However, Jacobovici's thesis would inevitably lead to the unsupported claim that Alexander the Great was a Jew.  Perhaps, he's saving that tale for another episode on his wild and wacky T.V. show.",1313798400,7,2685,5.272941176470588
2639823,5,B000HOJR8A,This video presents fresh (scientific)archeological evidence that supports the biblical accounts of Joseph and the arrival of Israelites to Egypt and the Exodus.  The historically speculative time period for the exodus and the presumed Pharaoh is convincingly challenged to be wrong and the actual time period of the Exodus to be earlier which explains why much of this evidence hasn't been discovered or associated until now.  It's great to see archeology support the Exodus and an original theory of natural phenomena that plausibly explains the 7 plagues.

The video is dynamic, very visual,well-presented, and thoughtfully concise. S.Jacobovici decisively combines the various fields of history, archeology, geology, anthropology, and vulcanology with the Word of God as presented in both the Torah and the Old Testament of the Bible to create an argument for all the aspects of the Exodus of the Jewish Nation from Egypt. That melding of their traditions, oral histories, physical evidence, and other written works over time regarding the issue creates a fast-paced program whose price is surprisingly low for the richness of information contained therein, produced by both Jacobovici and creative director James Cameron (Titanic,Avatar).I highly recommend purchasing this video and watching it multiple times with The Bible at hand, assessing what is advocated by Jacobovici and Cameron.",1289606400,,1063,5.52760736196319

We accept everything that tends to support what we want to believe and ignore evidence to the contrary.  This is a mistake.  It would be gratifying to believe that at last we understood the exodus of the Jews from Egypt, that we had incontrovertible evidemce that the Biblical account was accurate within the laws of physics.  But this program, alas, falls far short.

Timelines are rearranged, as well as Greek history, vulcanology, physics, and about everything else.  Not taken into account is the fact that there are no Egyptian tales of Moses and his miraculous escape across the Red Sea.  In fact, the one account we have is in the Bible, an account that would appear to deny the laws of physics as we know them, e.g., the parting of the waters to let the Jews cross the sea and the closing of the waters to thwart the Egyptian pursuers.  One would think that an event that miraculous would have been mentioned somewhere in Egyptian lore.

The attempt in this DVD documentary is to prove that no miracles were required, that Moses' escape was a result of the explosion of Santorini, a Greek/Minoan volcano.  That one event caused the plagues in Egypt, parted the sea, etc.  I'd rather have the miracles than bend physics to explain it all.",1275782400,4,1351,4.682203389830509

2639833,4,B000HOJR8A,"The Exodus Decoded (History Channel) DVD, produced by James Cameron, is a very entertaining slice of popular history. The argument is made that a fresh look at the time line in the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom eras in Egyptian history, will bring about explanations for some events in the Exodus narrative, by tying in some historical events researched by archaeologists and geologists. Is the central thesis conclusive?  No, but it is entertaining, with numerous sequences filmed in the areas of Egypt that are connected to the story in Exodus. Other sequences were filmed in Greece.

I am an avid historical buff and he shows the evidence from Egypt that has been a long time secret of Joseph, Moses and the Children of God. He reveals what was now just being discussed on the History Channel of Egyptian records of Greeks and Hebrews present during the biblical recorded time. Cameron's explanation of the miracles of God are addressed from a scientific approach. Makes one ponder regardless. Wither you agree or not to the Mosaic story, very compelling movie.

Nothing within this documentary could be construed as proof, yet everything is presented as such.  It has all the hallmarks of snake-oil salesmen telling people what they want to hear.  If the suppositions had been set aside and the material allowed to stand on it's own, it presents some interesting information, but the majority of the presentation misrepresents the facts, and often the content of the Bible in order to fit the narrative.

I see this ultimately as something more damaging than encouraging, and suggest that anyone with a mind too weak to see through the distortions of this documentary not be exposed to it.

2639839,1,B000HOJR8A,"I just saw The Exodus Decoded on History Channel.

At the beginning I found it very interesting and perhaps even convincing.

As the argument progressed, I became frustrated and exasperated!!! The extent of manipulation of Greek archaeology was amazing... As an experienced Greek archaeologist, who specializes in Greek prehistory for over 20 years, I was appalled by the interpretation of a number of the Mycenae grave stelai, and further more of the golden ornament with the doves.

It is very easy to interpret an artifact in such a way to fit one's story. The grave stelai are decorated with motifs that have been portrayed in Greek art since the 3rd millennium BC, and the golden ornament portrays a Minoan tripartite shrine (a motif very well documented in Minoan Art/Crete). Furthermore, the implications that the people who were buried in Mycenae/Greece were Hebrew, are beyond comment... Only someone who has no knowledge of Greek history and archaeology, would ever imply this.

The interpretation of the Thera fresco has also been manipulated to fit the Exodus story, too.

It is a great pity that a widely viewed channel, such as History Channel is, instead of stimulating people's minds, creates misconceptions of world history by offering dangerously misleading arguments, falling pray to the propaganda of certain producers and directors.

""The made-for-TV documentary, The Exodus Decoded, begins with some excellent special effects and a short excerpt from the Steven Spielberg-George Lucas thriller, Raiders of the Lost Ark. This introduction sets the stage for a fast-paced show with high production values and dramatic footage. Unfortunately, unlike the Indiana Jones movie, this film presents itself as non-fiction. Watching it is reminiscent of an expensive infomercial, in which the actor-salesman makes increasingly exaggerated claims for his product--it makes you lose weight, adds muscle, and makes you rich to boot. In this case, the actor-director is selling a highly dubious bundle of theories about the historical and scientific veracity of the Biblical Exodus.""

It is so sad that in this time and age we still have charlatans that make unfounded claims, wrong assumptions and all-out LIES on historical facts so that they can serve a political or religious agenda. Shame on History channel to endorse these charlatans.",1229644800,12,1144,5.494318181818182

2639847,3,B000HOJR8A,"Exodus Decoded is titled far more assertively than it delivers - it's more ""Exodus sort of looked at in a different way than most others have done while still leaving a lot of questions and some loopholes in process.""

The production values are certainly of the highest quality here - the computer graphics are whizbang, look very cool, and actually do contribute to the arguments and narrative that Jacobovici is offering.

Unfortunately, the level of scientific facts do not succeed in achieving the same heights of excellence as the whizbang graphics.

I'm not as willing as some other reviewers to call this entirely nonsense, but I'm also not as willing as some others to just accept everything here as absolute fact and go running around proclaiming ""See! The Bible is historically perfectly true!""

The truth is, we really don't know when (or even if) the Exodus happened, and if it did happen, don't really know how. Other than the account in the Bible, there isn't much secondary proof out there of any of the biblical claims. And trying to piece together anything that far back into history is somewhat of a fool's errand.

Given that we probably will never really know the details, I think Jacobovici offers some compelling stuff to think about, but not a lot to take super duper seriously, or consider as definitely ""solved"".

Watch this, but watch it with a critical eye and have your hermeneutic of suspicion set on 11 and ready to use at a moment's notice. Who knows? The Exodus could very well have happened in the mid-1400s BCE, as he proposes; the stele could show bas reliefs of the crossing of the Reed See; Sinai could be where he says it is; and so on.

Perhaps the best way to sum this up is to say that is worth watching, so long as you remember that everything Jacobovici says should be preceded with ""maybe"" or ""possibly"" or could end with ""but I might be wrong"".

Unfortunately, Jacobovici rarely offers that kind of humility and academic honesty in this documentary, and offers his statements as finished, completely researched and proven facts.

And that's why I give it three stars, and not five. If he'd said ""Here's some cool stuff I'm thinking about, and why - let me show you, and see what you think"", I'd like this a lot more. But when people say, especially about history, ""Here's what happened"", I grow weary and wary.

I am buying a copy to use in my church adult education, but I will be sure to offer it as a possibility and generator of discussion, not as scientific or even scholarly fact.",1216944000,12,2531,4.654708520179372
2639848,1,B000HOJR8A,"Where does one start with this abomination?
The Exodus Decoded claims to be a valid attempt at shedding light on the Biblical Exodus, though the arguments presented are laughable to anyone with basic/elementary knowledge of the peoples and the time in question.
This fictional approach has the audacity to claim that Mycenaean gold found by Heinrich Schliemann was actually Egyptian gold brought by Israelites who broke away from the main host (!!!) led by Moses and ended up in the Peloponnesus. Moreover, the documentary alleges that the Mycenaean swords found were brought to Mycenae by those same Israelites. Apart from the fact that if indeed they had been innocent slaves who just wanted to be set free they would not have been armed or carrying somebody else's gold with them which indicates that maybe they were not that ""innocent"" (and which is a different story altogether), mixing Israelites and Mycenaeans is dangerous and absurd to say the least.
After watching The Exodus Decoded I headed to the Athens Archeological Museum (30 minutes' drive) to see for myself these claims regarding the three piece stonework depicting the charioteer (Pharaoh) and the artifact claimed to depict the Ark. In both cases you have to let your imagination run amuck before reaching the conclusions that this ""documentary"" is trying to sell.
Presenting accurate and valid sources proving the close relations between the Minoans and the Egyptians and how the Minoans were the only people recognized by Egypt as being civilized has very little if anything to do with the topic apart from throwing in a few truths to make the tale being spun more believable.
This ""History Channel"" documentary is overflowing with bias and wishful thinking in all its glory. The so-called ""passion of Jewish-Canadian filmmaker Simcha Jacobovici"" mentioned by Tom Keogh in the editorial review does nothing whatsoever to prevent Jacobovici's work and by extension himself personally from being dishonored and discredited.
Is someone maybe trying to give much more significance to certain groups than is deserving or historically accurate???  Why is it that one gets the feeling that this was more the result of poorly conceived and executed propaganda and politics than anything else...

2639852,3,B000HOJR8A,"I was pleasantly surprised by this documentary, since what I'd read about it didn't have anything but the really stupid claim -- that the death of Pharaoh connected with the eruption of Thera -- which has been regurgitated over recent years.  There's no connection between Thera and Exodus, just as there's no connection between a 2nd millennium eruption and the end of Minoan civilization.  While I share the view that unusual natural events made the Exodus possible, Thera was not it; neither is there anything to the ""Mt Sinai a Volcano"" school of thought.

Jacobivici and company present the case well.  The graphical manipulation of various artifacts, IOW the special effects, I found to be eye-catching and helpful.  I found the detective work which led to plausible identifications of the Sea of Passage and Mt Sinai compelling.  But the supposed connection between the Thera eruption and the so-called site of Avaris (it isn't Avaris) had already been broken by the time of the broadcast when the pumice stone was found to be from a different volcano (and a volcano which erupted 10s of 1000s of years ago, to boot).  Even the expert shown in a clip stated that he'd found forty ash grains he claimed were from Thera -- that's a mighty small number for a super-eruption.  Of course, I had the same reaction when I learned that the average layer of (supposedly) Theran ash in Crete was 5 mm.

Worst of all was the blatantly false statement -- no doubt made due to overreliance on Charles Pellegrino -- that the supposed Theran super-eruption wiped out Minoan civilization.  That's been rejected for at least forty years, and during the last ten or fifteen years the drive to push the supposed super-eruption into the middle of the 17th c BC made the disconnect worse, because instead of 80 or so years for the civilization to die, it's now 150 or more.  To put that in perspective, it's as if, in 1859, Mt St Helens had erupted with three orders of magnitude more energy than it did in 1980, but US society managed to survive and thrive, only to vanish next year as a result of that eruption.

Amazon reader reviewer ScienceMinded was exactly correct -- Velikovsky should have been credited, since the naos of el-Arish and the Papyrus Ipuwer are linchpins for the late Dr's ""Ages In Chaos"".  Had Jacobovici et al been familiar with that work, they'd have noted that the name of the site given in the inscription on the naos synchs with the name of the place given in the Old Testament, thus strengthening their case.  In 1945, when Velikovsky identified the Papyrus Ipuwer as an Egyptian account of the ten plagues of the Exodus, the general view of its date was Old Kingdom, with some viewing it as Middle Kingdom in date; now Jacobivici states that it is generally  seen as a 1st Intermediate Period document, which exactly agrees with Velikovsky.

I liked the program's segment on the monuments from Schliemann's dig at Mycenae.  His novel interpretation of the images on those stones were interesting.  I didn't think he was right, not at all, and thought his treatment of that particular corner of his theory was sketchy at best.  Bietak excavated Tell el-Dab'a in Egypt and found Minoan frescoes.  Seagoing trade has been going on for thousands of years in the eastern Mediterranean (at least!), even into prehistoric times (the obsidian trade reached Aegean Islands and more).

It is generally thought that Linear A was invented (or adapted?) by the Minoans, and it is nearly universally agreed that Linear A does not contain Greek -- unlike Linear B, which does, and probably was based on Linear A.  If Linear A conceals a Semitic language -- and there's only one scholar of whom I'm aware who thinks it does -- then Jacobovici's idea about the origin of these monuments would be strengthened.  But he doesn't develop this idea, merely -- and sensationally -- equates a cryptic gold artifact with the ever-popular Ark of the Covenant.  There's even a clip of Indy opening the crypt and finding the Ark.

Jacobivici's claim that the Egyptian government doesn't like anyone trying to investigate the Exodus and kept an eye on the documentary group's activities rang true.  Anyone who calls that claim evidence of some kind of conspiracy theory is just ignorant.  Zahi Hawass has pushed his cuckoo view that ancient Egypt was slavery-free, and anyone who digs in Egypt has to toe that ridiculous party line.  In his own book, Kent Weeks, rediscoverer of KV-5, describes a problem his team had with the Egyptian government's destructive mishandling of aerial photos taken by the team in order to map the Valley of the Kings, a problem they had to circumvent by trickery in order to effectively do their job -- and the Egyptian antiquities authorities *like* the Theban Mapping Project.  Gantenbrink got banned from the Giza plateau simply for announcing his fairly modest finds in the Great Pyramid.  Some people seem to forget that nominally democratic Egypt is a police state.

I didn't notice anything that would make it objectionable for those few parents who still care what their children watch.  Jacobovici even closes the show by suggesting, despite the apparent natural causes of the plagues and Pharaoh's death, that God made it happen in order to free his Chosen People.  As long as the chronology used in the show isn't taken seriously -- Ahmose was most definitely *not* the Pharaoh of the Exodus -- I think you'll enjoy this disk.  I do strongly suggest reading Immanuel Velikovsky's ""Ages In Chaos"" to get the chronology straight.",1205107200,16,5556,4.850635593220339

Where to begin?

I was recommended this by a Christian friend of mine who isn't into these kinds of things so to her, this film was an eye-opener.  But as soon as the ""documentary"" starts, I can tell these guys are way out of their league, mostly, with what the bible actually says.

I could pick this ""documentary"" apart with a fine-toothed comb but I don't have alot of time and to be honest, anyone with a tiny ammount of bible knowledge wouldn't need me to.  But I'll list some probs that I can recall without even blinking:

#1) Not sure what to think about their idea of what happened to the Nile (gas theory) since EVEN THE WATER IN THE BUCKETS in Egypt turned into blood also. Oops, skipped over that did we?  Exodus 7:19-20.  This, in fact, is not even MENTIONED in the documentary.  They can decipher ""red"" and ""reeds"" but not even acknowledge the obvious and THEY are the ones making the documentaries?  Scary.

#2) They also don't explain how Pharoah's magicians did the same miracales Moses did at first.  Exodus 7:9-13, 7:22

#3) If the water at El Balah descended into sinkholes then you have discrepancies with Psalm 78:13, Exodus 14:22 and 29 that the Jews walked specifically on DRY ground and that the water stood as a WALL to the RIGHT and LEFT of them.

Need I go on?  I mean seriously.  Isn't this the same all-star squad that tried to tell us about Jesus' lost tomb?  I laughed at that too.

Shame on people like this.  Shame.

I'd recommend The Exodus Revealed to people with an actual interest in this subject.  Because the H channel blunders so badly with biblical history, it makes me wonder just how much other history they fumble.",1193097600,16,1672,4.506666666666667
2639856,4,B000HOJR8A,"Right off the bat I will admit that I am not a scientist or religious scholar as some commenting can legitimately claim. I am college educated in Sociology and other subjects, yet work in an academic environment where research and sourcing has always been a vital core. I am not religious, although I know about many religions. However, watching the Exodus Decoded was an enjoyable experience. I have always been very interested in using the primary documents of various people along with archeology to try and sniff out the past.

History Channel International provided me the chance to see this documentary and my hat goes off to Simcha for the effort. I intend to buy this on DVD as well. Despite the comments here, I feel the importance of this documentary is not in proving anything. Its value is in opening a dialog with the past. Too often the scientific community is more concerned with fighting over theories or differences in opinion. This documentary gets you thinking about the Bible and other documents as they should be seen: as a basis for exploration not for absolute verification of past events. The texts are an evolution of thought over time by various people, as well as a snapshot of our ancestors.

Documentaries pose a problem to those wanting citations explained in more detail in that the vehicle's main goal is often reporting on the experience had while researching or providing support for a theory, or both. Simcha does this, while using sources gathered. You can glean from watching how much effort it took to convince certain authorities to allow them access to the sites and artifacts in question. The film comments quite early as to the need to take the documentary as you desire to, with mention to experts who aided him even failing to agree with his view. This is his perspective, and you may gather what you wish from it whether that be ammunition against his theories, support for one of your own, or merely another view on the Exodus that you may not have humored previously.

I have not obtained my copy yet to see if perhaps a DVD-ROM session on the disc provides additional documentation or resources to look into the sources used by Simcha. It appears I am overly used to a works cited page. This may be included in part in the credits, though I do not have high hopes of total transparency. The importance of having the references utilized available becomes clearer when this item is used in an academic setting (or for personal research). To accept this as reference material, one needs to be able to get to the meat and fat that Simcha chewed on to find what he saw as answers.

Regardless of this potential flaw, given an open and critical mind your time will not be wasted watching this documentary. The case made is compelling and while it may well dissolve after closer inspection by the academic community, the experience and conscious-raising you will undergo while watching is well worth the effort. Overall you get a great potential picture of one slice of the ancient world thousands of years ago.",1190678400,9,3052,4.752830188679245
2639857,1,B000HOJR8A,"Where to start... this film is a documentary that apparently proves the story of the Exodus and grounds it with scientific evidence. Replete with cherry-picked examples of scientific proof, tenuous connections that boarder on the irrelevant, bad science and religiously-pervasive ignorance, it barely qualifies as pseudo-science. The over-reliance upon the Avaris excavation and speculative opinion of ""experts"" only contributes a weak case for their theory. I swear the hieroglyphs scratched in the cave by the unnamed sematic slave were done five minutes before shooting that particular scene (I mean, who the hell is ever going to travel back out there to check). The fire and ice hail was pure classic (as though by virtue of the CG animation alone, this proves the phenomenon). Complete with a conspiracy theory, whereby the Egyptian government is either constantly monitoring the team or outright interfering (apparently they are worried about the return of the Israelites if the theory is proved). Overall, I think this film undermines any case for the Exodus and irrevocably destroys the credibility of the ""experts"" involved in the project. This ""documentary"" begs for a parody and I can only hope that some clever wit will adapt the ""chronology machine"" to scientifically move the pieces of history around and prove once and for all the existence of FSM, peace (and mozzarella) be upon him.",1190419200,9,1400,5.2825112107623315

2639866,3,B000HOJR8A,"I think that this documentary is correct in that the Ipuwer papyrus and inscription of El Arish are related to events in the Book of Exodus.  However, the documentary should have given credit to Immanuel Velikovsky (1895-1979) who was the first to propose that these Egyptian texts contain historical memories of events in the Book of Exodus.  Velikovsky discussed these texts in his 1950 'Worlds in Collision' and in his 1952 'Ages in Chaos'.  Also, although the Ipuwer-Exodus parallels are indeed striking, the papyrus does not mention a hail of mingled fire and ice as claimed in the documentary.

The documentary's idea that the Israelites were Hyksos is not realistic.  The Hebrews would not have made up the idea that they were slaves, especially if they had been Hyksos rulers of Egypt who were expelled during a civil war.  However, Velikovsky's main ideas on the Exodus and on the identity of the Hyksos in 'Ages in Chaos' really make sense.

The claim in the documentary that Ahmose was the pharaoh of the Exodus is probably wrong, for Ahmose probably lived centuries after the Exodus.  Based on books by Velikovsky it appears that some pharaohs, including Ahmose, have been dated centuries too early in the conventional chronology of ancient Egypt.  If their dates are moved forward to correct this, Egyptian history fits more convincingly with the histories of neighboring countries.  The respective histories then shed light on each other.  Unfortunately, many archaeologists today probably know little or nothing of the real content of Velikovsky's works because Velikovsky has been widely misrepresented for decades.

The documentary does well in showing how earthquakes and volcanism might explain extraordinary events in the Book of Exodus.  Interested readers would also enjoy books by Velikovsky or 'Unwrapping the Pharaohs' by John Ashton and David Down.",1185148800,16,1874,5.2274247491638794
2639867,2,B000HOJR8A,"I would like to say that I enjoyed watching this documentary a lot.  In fact it influenced me to do a research paper on the Hyksos for my Ancient Egyptian history class.  After doing such research, I realized how selective Jacobovici is.  I'm sure for the average believer from an Abrahamic faith who hasn't studied much ancient history, archeology, or anthropology, this documentary may improve and reinforce their faith.

However, with the knowledge I have now, I see the selectivity in Jacobovici work.  He uses the Bible as his base, picks the parts of Egyptian history which seem convenient for his purposes, and totally ignores the fact that the Hyksos were not slaves (and there isn't a historical record for the ancient Hebrews being slaves in Egypt outside the Bible).  He completely portrays the Hyksos as the Hebrews described in the OT of the Bible rather than what we know through modern day Egyptology (a small group of Semitic nomads from Palestine who through infiltration took advantage of political weakness during the Second Intermediate Period and rose to power in the 15th Dynasty).  Furthermore, the Hyksos were able to gain control of Lower (Northern) Egypt due to their advanced military technology.  For example, Exhibit N in the film portrays a man on a chariot chasing another man, according to the film these are ""the Egyptians chasing the Hebrews.""  However, there is strong evidence to show that during this period, the Hyksos reintroduced the chariot which had fell into disuse until that time in ancient Egypt.  The ancient Egyptians adopted many new military technologies and used them to drive out the Hyksos.

Nonetheless, I would give credit to Jacobovici to having done such research such as looking into the scientific explanation for the plagues,  how Hebrews (or Hyksos) may have traveled to present day Greece, and few others.

I also understand that many of these networks are moderate to conservative in their presentation of history so not to offend any religious people by giving a whole new twist or proving anyones history false.  Whether you are a believer or not, this documentary is fun to watch and will educate you.",1181433600,16,2167,5.0
2639868,5,B000HOJR8A,"You either hate or like Jacobovovich, I like his style, he's also very dogged when it comes to the facts about whatever topic he is pursuing. I found his quest for the possible explanations and his statement at the end of the DVD very good perspectives. Mr. Cord attacks him for not digging the sea of reeds for evidence of egyption remains. Well he could not get a permit to do that. He was watched very carefully by egyption authorities and had to use his wits to get the footage he got. I would like to see what would result were this line of reasoning allowing the Hyksos to be the people of the exodus, fully pursued archeologically. Many of the sites are in egypt and the authorities are hostile to the whole idea, history and may not allow it........",1179964800,4,757,4.414285714285715
2639869,1,B000HOJR8A,"Director Simcha Jacobovici is fast becoming the Geraldo Rivera of historical biblical documentaries. In this film he manages to ""solve"" numerous mysteries that have eluded biblical researchers for centuries all in one fell swoop, almost stumbling onto ""evidence"" as he walks along! To the casual viewer, he presents a compelling case for his theory that the Hebrew exodus out of Egypt occured long earlier than previously believed during the reign of Pharoah Ahmose rather than during the time of Rameses II. He selectively morphs bits of evidence and words into an almost convincing arguement. But one piece of information that Jacobovici conveniently ""overlooks"" is Chapter I, verse 11 of the book of Exodus which clearly states that the enslaved Hebrews built the cities of Pithom and Raamses, both ordered constructed by Pharoah Rameses himself. Although the Bible does not specifically mention the Pharoah by name, this verse in Exodus is strong proof that the Hebrews had to be enslaved in Egypt during the time of Rameses II! Does Jacobovici want us to believe that ALL the other verses in Exodus are reliable, but this particular verse is not? Or that the Hebrews mysteriously returned to Egypt long after they escaped to build a few cities out of charity for Rameses II? Such is the case with most of this film. Jacobovici correctly points out that the Red Sea is not the correct location for the famous ""parted sea"" crossing of the Hebrews. He shows footage of divers fruitlessly searching for Egyptian remains at the bottom of the Red Sea. Yet, after he pinpoints with certainty what he believes to be the EXACT location of the crossing, he makes no mention of, or attempt to look for, ANY Egyptian remains at the site he says is called ""The place where God devoured"". This film is tabloid archaeology, and the sad thing is that viewers with little or no knowledge of biblical research will accept Jacobovici's mishmash as fact. If you are considering purchasing this DVD, save your money. There are numerous books and DVDs that offer far more reliable information on the story of the exodus and Egypt in general. Seek them out.",1175558400,26,2139,4.911602209944752
2639870,5,B000HOJR8A,"This is a very good representation of a scientist's theory of what happened during the Exodus. Whether you believe him or not, he has done a bang up job at being as thorough a researcher as the local laws would allow him. People are always going to believe what they want; no amount of evidence will change their minds. But I like how entertaining this production is.

Not everything is completely explained, though. This production does not explain how the low travelling gas (aka the angel of death) killed every firstborn male animal as well as Egyptian. The animals would have all been together. No one would have taken the time to separate the firstborn of every male animal, so the explanation of the firstborn sons of Egypt does not touch on the animals' deaths.

The figurines on the Ark of the Covenant were cherubim, or angels, not birds. The cherubim are to have their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim are to face each other, looking toward the cover. The image that is shown in the production is of two birds facing each other, but with their wings were not overshadowing the cover with them - they were splayed back as if they were about to take to flight.

Also, nowhere in Exodus does it say that the Hebrews suffered any of the plagues Egypt was tormented by. We assume that the scourge affected everyone, but the plagues were God's tools which He used to convince the pharoah to let His people go. The Hebrews were the people God was protecting, while the plagues were inflicted on Egypt as signs to the pharoah.

Overall, it was a very good production. I respect the scientific explanations with neutraility toward religion. It was not designed to slam anyone's faith, and I do not believe it does. It was a very well balanced and educational look at Biblical history from a scientific point of view.",1175472000,10,1854,4.660550458715596
2639871,3,B000HOJR8A,"Jacobovici presents interesting theories of possible natural causes for the 10 plagues, but like the Midas Muffler man, he ""makes it all fit"" by juggling dates and numbers. He pushes the date of the Exodus back to 1500 BC and moves the date of the Santorini eruption up 100 years from 1600 to 1500 BC to make the theory work. He claims that Jacob migrated to Egypt in 1700 BC and that they remained there for 200 years. This is a direct contradiction of Exodus 12:40 which distinctly says that they were there for 430 years which would bring the Exodus to around 1270 BC, not 1500 BC and long after the Hyksos expulsion. Also it is highly irregular to equate the Israelites, a farming and herding people who only migrated into Egypt due to famine, with the Hyksos who were a trading and warlike people who took Lower Egypt by conquest and held it for 108 years; they were not slaves in need of deliverance. The Hyksos were not freed due to the 10 plagues; they had to be driven out by the armed forces of Middle Kingdom Pharoah Ahmose who had evidence that they were forming an alliance with the Nubians to take over Egypt entirely.

Jacobovici's claim that the 10th plague was caused by carbon dioxide bubbling up from the water due to seismic activity as in the case of Lake Nyos in the Camaroon in 1986 seems plausible enough, but that was a lake of standing water. Iron deposits and gasses would not normally bubble up in a fast river current as in the case of the Nile. Plus he claims that the reason that only the first-born of Egypt died was because the first-born were highly honored and slept on the first floor as opposed to servants and poor who would have slept on the roofs and thereby not have been exposed to the gas. But would not Pharoah and the royal household also have had the same honors ? and yet none of them died. And would the fact that the Israelites were standing up celebrating the first Passover have been adequate to have kept them from succumbing? Don't gasses rise?

Jacobovivi uses the wall paintings in a tomb at Beni Hasan showing a seeming migration of distinctly non Egyptian peoples with non Egyptian dress and hairstyles to prove that this is evidence of Jacob and his family coming to Egypt in 1700 BC. But the inscriptions date the event to the 6th year of Sesostris II, ca. 1890 BC and are merely a caravan of Semitic traders bringing goods to Egypt for trade. He then uses mass graves of men only, near Avaris to prove the 10th plague of the first-born sons, but again, archeologists findings show that the skeletons range from 18-25 years of age and none younger and many have arrow tips imbedded in them suggesting that these were casualties of war, perhaps even Hyksos soldiers killed by the armies of Ahmose when he drove them out of Lower Egypt. Then Jacobovici goes on to postulate that along with the ""mixed company"" that left with Moses were Minoans from Avaris who may have crafted the golden Ark of the Covenant and then later sailed back to their homeland and created golden amulets accurately depicting the ark. But the Bible does not mention Minoans as being the goldsmiths who crafted the ark and the Minoans in Avaris were traders who were free to come and go at any time. There is no reason why they would have followed Moses into the Sinai for 40 years incurring the wrath of Pharoah and then return to their homeland later. Plus the amulets are not accurate depictions of the ark which had two cherubim on the lid, not two birds.

And then too, one does wonder why an all creative and omnipotent God would have found it necessary to use the volcano at Santorini to destroy the entire Minoan civilization and other coastal cultures (which had no responsibility whatsoever for Israelite slavery)in order to punish Pharoah with carbon dioxide gas and tsunami's in Egypt. It seems a bit clumsy and inconsiderate to me.",1175385600,17,3875,4.548710601719198
2639872,5,B000HOJR8A,"If I could rate this higher I would. Research made the film, technology made it vibrant, understandable, and highly entertaining.  They do have a background on the making of the film.  They made a believer out of me,  and I have made notes in my Bible.  The research involved is amazing, especially the Beni Hasan temple with the pictures of the Semites arriving in Egypt.  THEN, actually finding the rings of Joseph in that archaeological site where they have to plant over the site to hide it.

  The risks involved, with the locals not willing to allow anything that would give creedence to the Bible as history, and proof of the Israelites claim to living there that far back in history.  As for it going back to coincide with the Santorini volcanic eruption causing the plagues, you could say cause and effect.  You could go further and say: CAUSE=  a prayer by a hebrew slave in the mines  EFFECT= God (who is All-in-all) responding to that prayer by creating the circumstances to freedom---Santorini volcano erupts--10 plagues--the oil fields going off one by one (the pillar of fire) leading them to their freedom.  I would like to see a satellite generated map of the area--as they mentioned, it would show the terrain from that far back.",1175040000,3,1247,4.744186046511628
2639873,1,B000HOJR8A,"In every single case, except one, refutation of Jacobovici's ""findings"" are a matter of scientific record. Most of the scientists/professors that he interviews and the quotes used in this documentary are taken entirely out of context but that context is readily available to those who are willing to read the original scientists/professors work(s). Unfortunately, for the majority of people they neither have the inclination or have the resources to do so (which is often the problem. It can be quite tedious to refute pseudo-science with point by point arguments and examples but it is often necessary to do so so that pseudo-science does not win out at the end of the figurative day).

Jacobovici does generate some interesting ideas, but when an idea is based on fancy (such as the evolution of the name Egyptian Pharaoh Ahmose from the Hebrew Moses as a single example amongst many - Jacobovici proposes that the name Ahmose was perhaps given to him by his father Seqenenre Taa II because he remembered the Israelite prince he grew up with and Ahmose is simply a ""play on words"". Woah! Perhaps if you use English as the basis for the Egyptian spelling of Ahmose and then translated that to Hebrew. In other words, the ""play on words"" is based upon Jacobovici's mispronounced Pharaoh's name) then it is easy to refute such an idea with an education or even keen interest in linguistics and even proto-linguistics (there are reems of scholarly books on the subject). Although Jacobovici does stipulate this last idea as just a fanciful hypothesis, it does have a tendancy to lend credence to other ""factual"" claims that he makes further on in the documentary.

I can appreciate the level of quality that went into this documentary. Large dollars were spent as attested to the involvement of James Cameron as a Producer of the piece. Just because something looks glossy doesn't mean that there is any real ""science"" going on. And this brings up another fact. Science is not written in stone, it is not hardened against other more radical ideas supplanting it. However, for a ""new"" scientific understanding, reinterpretation of the available data, or refutation of that data comes to light through the form of hypothetical processes, they must be able to stand up against scrutiny from many different scientific practices and disciplines; Exodus Decoded does not. If you're unable to take my word for it (and I grant that I've only made the most cursory arguments against a very early point in the documentary) why should you accept Jacobovici's method? He is after all, just a film-maker.

There is one point that I thought Jacobovici makes which I do find to be fairly sound. Or, in other words, I've been unable to conclusively or even intelligently refute. This pertains to the Hebrew term ""Amo"", or as Jacobovici states, ""God's People"". I've read essays and dissertations on the flawed argument that ""Amo"" does in fact translate as such but it all seems rather vague. Jacobovici does point out in other mediums besides this documentary, that the Hebrew people often still refer to themselves as Amo Israel, and I cannot dispute this and so I'm left with a minor contention that Jacobovici is correct in this one assumption made on the documentary. However, this single contention does not accurately reflect or shed new scientific light on the proposed problems that are inherent within Jacobovici's hypothesis.",1166745600,23,3416,4.989473684210527
2639874,4,B000HOJR8A,"I found this DVD fascinating. I do not need to prove that the Bible account is factual since the Bible is inspired of God. I did a little research and found a few things that didn't prove true but might be refuted by someone else. The two scenes showing the ark of the covenant do not match the final image shown at the end of the video. If you check the Bible that contains a literal description you will find that there were not two birds perched on the ark but two cherubs. The first scene showing the ark being crated it appears that the images are the cherubs and not birds. Also the information about El, supposedly representing the Israel God was probably a Cannanite God. El is depicted as a rebelllious son that dethroned and castrated his own father.

For example - in the cave where the ""slave"" carved ""el help me"", it looks like old egyptian hieroglyphs and he clearly has no idea what anything he is looking at actually says.  If you are a slave under the whip, you are unlikely to have the time it takes to carve some inscription about your torment in the cave you work in.  Also, the mention of some random claim about turquoise being mined by slave labor without any reference to back it up is meant to give case for slavery in ancient Egypt.

I don't doubt that there was a people in Egypt who were expelled from the region, there is plenty of proof for a warrior race on he border of Egypt that was brought into the fold of Egypts military and later were expelled from the region once they had grown into too large a force to be easily controlled.
