1071936,4,6305763240,"This movie is the first Kungfu movie made in the mainland of China. Most of the actors have won national champions.

1071938,1,6305763240,"I'm a Jet Li fan, and own a couple of his films...but I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone.  It was a big waste of [money]!!  If you must see this movie...rent it or borrow it, but don't buy!!  I should have listened to the other ""one star"" reviewer who described the horrible pan and scan quality of this DVD.  I must admit that there are a few moments of interest in the movie...one can't deny the skill involved when viewing the individuals display their use of weapons.  But the story is bad, the acting is bad, the camera work is bad, the sound is bad (especially the repeated use of a single ""horse whinney"" sound effect used over and over and over...).  If you are at all squeemish about watching a group of hungry monks eat a roasted pet dog, don't see this movie.  I'd recommend ""Twin Warriors"" or ""Fist of Legend"" for a better show of Jet Li's talents.",995846400,6,865,4.3354037267080745
1071939,5,6305763240,"The Shaolin Temple in a fantastic movie. The fight scenes in this movie are so good, you will not be able to take your eyes off the screen. Plus: the movie depicts the ""drunken pole"" style which is outrageous. Jet Li plays this mischiveous character that wants to be a monk to learn kung fu for what else...revenge! Even though this type of plot line has been seen before, the movie takes on a life of its own when the monks get in on the action. This is a ""can't miss"" for all fans of this genre and especially for fans of Jet.
Also, this dvd allows you to watch the movie in dubbed english or the original language.",987811200,21,617,4.19327731092437
1071940,5,6305763240,"The Shaolin Temple was the first Chinese martial arts film to use real gongfu practitioners as actors (Bruce Lee's films are exempt because he did not use Chinese gongfu in his films; his style, which died with him, was  primarily western martial arts with Asian kicking). These actors were the  best martial artists in China. The film was funded by Japanese investors  and took about two years to film due to the injuries the cast received  doing their own stunts (the contact was real). According to the credits,  Pan Qingfu choreographed the film. This is not so. All the actors  choreographed their own parts. It is also not true that Jet Li was the  reigning Chinese National Versatile Champion at the time this film was made  (although he did hold the title for five years). That honor goes to Hu  Jianqiang, who played the leader of the young monks. He is one of the few  masters of both Northern and Southern styles, and Jet Li's friend and  senior. This film is leaps and bounds above the earlier Hong Kong films.",963705600,56,1022,4.622222222222222
1071941,4,6305763240,"I have seen both VHS and DVD versions of this movie. You must get the DVD one to watch the full widescreen (about 2.35:1 which tell you how much were missing in P&S VHS version) and to enjoy the excellent video / audio  quality. It offers both  Chinese Mandrin and dubbed Cantonese sound  tracks.(with English subtitle) The shaolin monks in the movies were  students from Chinese official martial art schools. Most of the action were  real stuff, not like those camera tricks or fake stuff in modern kung fu  movies.",956188800,8,516,4.677777777777778
1071942,3,6305763240,"Contrary to the package labelling, this movie is not in its original language.  I watched this movie when it was released on the big screen, and it was in Mandarin, not Cantonese.  However, the video and audio quality  was just as bad in the original film format as it is in the videotape.  But  technical difficulties aside, once you get your eyes and ears adjusted, Jet  Li will blow you away.  You can easily see China's wushu champion at work  in this movie; all of his movements are crisp, clean and very graceful, in  top form.  Add to that the acting ability he shows and the fact that he's  still just a kid, and it's a truly awe-inspiring film.  The supporting cast  is no slack-off either.  Even if the movie seems like pure show-and-tell at  times, the martial arts demonstrations are just fabulous.  This movie is a  must for all martial arts fans and for all Chinese culture lovers!",954806400,10,895,4.528301886792453

I've seen all of his others and I wanted to see his very first and it definitely did not disappoint.  All the  wonderful Shaolin fighters and their Wushu, man if I knew how to do that  stuff, I'd be a dangerous fool!  I liked the letterbox format for this  video and that most of the subtitles were in the black parts, not blocking  the action.  You got to check this out and see a young Jet Li whoop some  tail!

1072035,4,6305763240,"There are some amazing martial arts going on here, done by real Shaolin Monks, and much of the film was done at the Shaolin Temple in China; unfortunately, a good portion of the filming is badly lit indoor and/or night scenes.

Still, this is a classic film worth watching. The film accomplished quite a bit on a shoestring budget by getting the monks to spar on camera and act for practically nothing.

As mentioned by some other reviewers, it has a young Jet Li in his first film roll after winning first place in the National Wu Shu Competition(Chinese national sponsored martial arts competition) and many very talented, less known artist. Note: There are several schools of martial arts in China then and now; Chinese (Government) Wu Shu (official name) forms sometimes vary from the Wu Shu (same term also used as a generic name for all martial arts) forms used by other performers.

The fight scenes are brilliantly ""fought"" and choreographed; the speed of some of the maneuvers is tough to believe, but the film is not sped up--they are just that good.

As I said, my only complaint was that the film lighting (and quality) was not up to the standards of the martial arts. This is understandable and not surprising considering the time and special circumstances of the making of the film.",1335225600,3,1296,4.746666666666667
1072036,1,6305763240,"This film failed to deliver the kung-fu experience that I was so desperately hoping to achieve from an early 80's film. The plot sucked, the fighting was slow and sloppy (no technique). Do not buy this!",1323907200,3,202,4.638888888888889
1072037,5,6305763240,"Beware the digitally remastered verion with the light blue cover has great video but is dubbed as opposed to cantonese or mandarin. I had to buy a different version because I cant stand ancient chinese people speaking in high pitched english. I bought the shalin temple dvd with three movies shaolin temple , shaolin temple 2, and born to defense. This had pretty good video but the original language as an option. It has English too if you really want it. The subtitles seemed good to me. As a movie shaolin temple was good lots of martial art action. I guess all i said was wrong because *****i just figured out how to get alternate languages. I had to use the audio button on the remote and i got chinese language",1296604800,,716,4.473282442748092
1072038,2,6305763240,As I watched this dvd I was expecting and hoping for something more. It was mostly children doing workouts and I was expecting real monks. They were good but I actually thought this was a documentary on the monks at shaolin going through their daily routines and it wasn't. My mistake really. I cannot remember the exact title which I saw many years ago at a friends house. It was interesting to see Jet Li performing fantastically even at a young age indicating his skill was a gift really. Oh well.,1288656000,2,500,4.5054945054945055
1072039,4,6305763240,One interesting historical note is that senior members of the Japanese Shorinji Kempo organization were invited to perform a (very) brief fight scene in the movie. In the version I have it is at 1:16:28 and lasts about 15 seconds. They were invited due to the Founder Doshin So's connection to the Shaolin Temple while working as a Japanese spy in China during WW2.

The acting isn't the greatest. And the story is a bit unrealistic in some parts because of how one event in the movie always happens seconds after the last one. But its all worth it to have great martial artists in the film, and to have a lot of long fight scenes.",1261180800,,323,4.0625

1072105,5,6305763240,"""The Shaolin Temple"" is Jet Li's first film.  Just 16 at the time, he was selected to play the lead because of his Gold medal performances in previous Chinese Martial Arts (Wushu) contests.  Other Wushu artists of the time round out the film, so these are not actors, but rather real Martial Artists.  As a result, the acting is not always great, but who cares?  After all, why are you watching a movie like this if not for great Martial Arts action?  Supposedly this movie, two years in the making, was a Chinese government funded project based on a legendary tale of the Shaolin Monks.  Also, rumor has it that the dog wasn't actually killed, but who knows?",1224201600,5,659,4.5423728813559325

1072163,4,6305763240,"Hong Kong Mei-Ah may not be the best DVD production company in the world but for this movie at least, it is tons better than the US version.  It's anamorphic widescreen and remastered, put back in glorious color.  There's no extras, but this price, I don't think anyone's complaining.

This is the first landmark Mainland Chinese gongfu flick to make it big.  Back in the early 1980s, it's a huge box office hit, making a star of the very young Jet Li, who plays the lead role.  To take nothing away from Jet, the troupe of very accomplished young actors at the very least rivals him in martial artist execution (check out some of his senior brothers sequences in the film), and there's some very nice landscape shots of Shaolin on location.  I do find the story a bit short and thin in 98 minutes, but there's nothing short about the kungfu execution.  There's no wireworks, and on show is just plain and realistic Shaolin martial arts as seen in real life.  Animal lovers will flinch at some scenes (a poor dog and a squashed lamb are the victims), and some Buddhists will not find some of the tongue-in-cheek attitudes mouthed by the Shaolin monks to their taste, but for the most parts it's a fun and enjoyable spree run, featuring a sweet Ding-Lan as a shepherd girl as well.  The supports have a sadistic villanous general and a comically staunch senior monk in the subplot.  Jet Li plays a young avenger whose father was killed by the general and trains secretly in Shaolin.

Recommended.",1104969600,2,1495,4.60377358490566
1072164,5,6305763240,"I have been a Jet Li fan since the first movie I ever saw him in.  I have known of this movie for a while but was always hesitant to buy it based on the comments of such a low quality transfer and overall bad DVD.  Great News!  The Mei Ah Entertainment version is here!  I tracked down a widescreen version(edaymovie.com) and to my surprise it is digitally remastered and in anamorphic widescreen.  It is beautiful.  Dare I even say perfect!

Now for the movie.  Think of Gordon Liu and the Shaw Bros. classic Master Killer(the stories have nearly the same plot), except this one is so much better!  For starters, this is the first movie to ever be filmed at the real Shaolin Temple, and some of the actual monks are in the movie!  This film has a ton of fighting and training scenes.  Around 3/4 of the movie is non stop kung fu amazement.  There are so  many different weapons and styles used in this movie: spears, staffs, three sectioned staffs, rope and chain darts, all kinds of swords including a scene where a bad guy uses drunken sword style against Jet Li's drunken staff (worth buying the movie alone for), and other weapons.  There are also countless hand to hand styles, too many to mention.  Everybody in this movie is outstanding, not only Jet Li.

Like I stated earlier, get ONLY the Mei Ah Entertainment version.  It is digitally remastered and in anamorphic widescreen.  It is the best transfer of a movie this old you will ever see.  And the sound is great.  It is in DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 in the original language with optional subtitles.

If you haven't seen this movie before and you are a kung fu fan or you have an inferior version of this already, I highly reccommend buying this(Mei Ah version).  You will love it!

Other Mei Ah titles that are also digitally remastered and anamorphic widescreen are Jet Li's Kids From Shaolin and Kung Fu Cult Master aka Lord of the Wu Tang, Brigitte Lin's Dragon Inn, Jackie Chan's Snake In The Eagle's Shadow and Drunken Master, and Yuen Woo Ping's Drunken Master 2: Dance Of The Drunk Mantis.",1097971200,21,2060,4.508108108108108

 if your just starting out with Jet Li movies, get HERO, The Tai Chi Master, Fist of Legend (orginal, not the US version! ) or Kung Fu Colt Master(its a fantasy swordplay flick, confusing but great!)& Fong Sai Yuk.
enjoy!!",1086739200,2,572,4.308411214953271

1072167,3,6305763240,"World Video has released this on dvd AND vhs, and- for no apparent reason- put the widescreen print on the VHS edition and the fullscreen edition on DVD. Same holds true for ""Kids from Shaolin"", which is part two in the trilogy completed by ""Martial Arts of Shaolin"". These were Jet Li's first films and are stellar in their representation of the arts and the actors' talents, but the fullscreen format- in my humble opinion- compresses the picture and you don't get to see the range of action afforded in the widescreen format. The quality of the film transfer between the DVD and VHS editions is comparable, same for sound, so if you're a widescreen [fan] you might go ahead and hunt down a copy on tape AND dvd. If you can ascertain that the edition you are buying IS in fact manufactured by World Vision, then the tape should be widescreen, per any copies I've seen for sale and rent on a store shelf.
I don't work for World Vision, but I own the two formats and was miffed to find the dvd in FULLSCREEN- alone and as part of the ""Jet Li Action 3-pak"". Picky viewers be warned!!!",1045612800,12,1083,4.42
1072168,5,6305763240,"I am admittedly an addict of kung fu films. Ever since I was 10 and saw Enter the Dragon, I have watched literally hundreds of kung fu movies, practiced various styles and read the Toa Te Ching. I love all Chinese martial arts films from plotless two dollar chop sockey flicks of the 70's to modern day crime saga's to swordsman fantasies with sexy ghosts, hopping vampires and enchanted swords.
Shaolin temple and it's warrior monks are revered by movie goers and film makers, to the same extent they are admired by martial arts students the world over, so naturally shaolin and it's monks are featured as agents of virtue fighting for good in almost half the kung fu films out there. But no other film is as historicly significant and few are as visually spectacular as this one.
Firstly Shaolin Temple was the first martial arts film made in communist mainland China. Funded by the Chinese government in the early 80's to cash in on the kung fu film market in Hong Kong's success. One should consider the significance of this alone since religion of any kind was pretty much forbiden by the government of China, yet this film was made with quite a lot of Buhddist phylosophy and ceromony featured.
Secondly this was the debut film of Jet Li, who has since became the 3rd biggest star in martial arts film history (Bruce Lee #1, Jackie Chan #2) and his star continues to rise today. At the time Jet Li was the national Wu Shu champion of China. His performance in this film so amazing that after it screened in China, people walked great distances to see Jet Li at his home village, some days the line of people outsides of his house stretched for miles! No BS.
Also along side Li, the cast was made up of many other Wu Shu champions, unfourtunatly Li and all actors in the cast were paid about the equivelent of $0.20 a day, which is the same rate factory workers were paid! A few members of the cast are also real shaolin monks.
Another amazing feature of this film is that many of the scenes were filmed in the real shaolin temple. The temple itself is as stunning as most ancient Chinese structures, but there is something truely special when scenes are filmed in the forest of Pagodas, where the most respected monks are buried and also the hall with the holes in the floor is a true training hall in Shaolin and the holes in the stone floor have actually being worn down by centuries of practice. Something about the reality just astounds you in a way that mere cinematic specials effects never will.
If that is not enough, Shaolin Temple features some of the most lengthy and exciting, action packed and dazzling, skillfull and well executed fight scenes ever caught on film. The scenes feature plenty of different fighting styles and some of the more exotic Chinese weaponary, not usually seen in action on film. There is a great piece too where Jet Li peeks over a fence to watch monks practice, once again the REALITY (of their skill) is more stunning than any explosions or laughably phony CGI.
Shaolin Temple is a true classic of the kung fu genre and landmark film for many reasons. Ever since this film hit the screens, the Shaolin temple in China has received renewed fame and people the world over have flocked to the real temple in the hopes of learning from the monks. Hundreds of schools, a few are run by actual monks, have set up all around the actual temple. The power of the film Shaolin Temple has inspired countless people East and West and I am sure that it will continue to inspire.",1024099200,86,3511,4.539432176656152
1072169,3,6305763240,"The story element in this movie is good, the fight scenes are typical Jet Li quality (amazing), but the picture quality is so poor it is ridiculous. The picture is never clear, the colors appear as if they were applied with a big crayon, almost pastel in texture and color. The subtitles were just plain terrible. There is a good 3 to 5 minute narrative at the begining of the film that is not subtitled at all, so if you don't happen to speak Cantonese (which I don't) you have to switch the language, this also happens during the film itself, especially during one of the last fight scenes, sure they are talking but there are no subtitles.
For some obsqure reason though the sound quality is better than most films of it's age. I've seen a lot of cantonese films from the 70's and 80's in the past few years, and typically it is almost impossible to understand any of what they are saying even if you do speak the language.

Although it is not as slick as most Hollywood productions and many later Asian action flicks, it generates more energy than any film that I have seen for a long time.  That energy does not come from fast cuts, loud music, or any the other standard tricks of the film trade.  It comes from the fast and furious movements of highly trained human bodies.
