AAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGHH! The plot action was nearly identical and some dialogue was right out of the book, but the movie greatly distorted relationships among the characters, distorting the major focus of the book. The way the movie was filmed makes it impossible to fully understand the themes of the novel. I have warned my students against viewing the film.",1240185600,2,518,4.766666666666667

854129,1,6304385528,"Secret Agent was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Gerard Depardieu, Robin Williams, Bob Hoskins, Christian Bale, and Patricia Arquette among others.
The movie brings to the screen the story of an Englishman, living with his young wife and her retarded brother in the city of London.  Things, however, are not as they seem in 19th Century London, with spies, double agents, anarchists and revolutionaries having a field day...
In short, the acting is surprisingly average (!), the setting is pretty good, while the dialogues and the plot are below average.
The movie has that Sherlock Holmes feel about it, but without the ""magic,"" meaning that in the end you are left... numb, and wondering: ""Was that it?""
As for the rating, it could have been PG-13.

854130,3,6304385528,"Although this film has gotten some terrible reviews, it is well executed overall, and as faithful an adaptation of Conrad's story as you're likely to see.  It is let down a bit by slow pacing and a very wooden performance by Patricia Arquette, but the rest of the cast is fine, especially an unbilled Robin Williams, who normally bothers me. I recommend THE SECRET AGENT mainly to those who are familiar with the original story, and those who enjoy British period melodrama.  The DVD is of fine quality and played with no problems on my machine.",1122508800,5,545,4.666666666666667
854131,1,6304385528,"I love Joseph Conrad's novels, but the films are another thing. They virtually never work, and this is just about the worst ever. It's extremely rare and I don't know if it was ever even released in the UK. I know it never got as far as Scotland, for which we can thank Hadrian's Wall. The truth is, the Romans didn't build it, we did to keep films this bad out!

This was obviously a pet project for Bob Hoskins who produced it, but you'd not know it to look at him. He's terrible in the lead. No character, no soul, nothing. Well, he is funny a couple of times, eating his dinner with his hat on or his death scene, but I don't think it was intentional. But compared to the rest of the cast, Eddie Izzard hopeless as the Russian ambassador, Jim Broadbent doing his Only Fools and Horses bit as Inspector Heat, Chris Bale's baleful idiot brother, he almost looks good. But then with the lead going to Patricia Arquette, who wouldn't? She's been worse, but that still doesn't make her any good in this. Her Winnie Verloc is pitiful in all the wrong ways. Why do they hire her? The only consolations are the scenes with Gerard Depardieu and Robin Williams in the restaurant. They work and sum up some of the spirit of the novel even though the two are pretty dire in their scenes in the rest of the film.

The adaptation is faithful but dead. It tells the story but not the characters or the themes and the direction by scripter Christopher Hampton isn't very good either. Honestly, even if you like Conrad you couldn't care less about this one. Badly disappointing and then some.",1120089600,6,1579,4.404109589041096
854132,2,6304385528,"'Secret Agent' (1996) stars very strong cast -- Bob Hoskins (also ex-producer), Patricia Arquatte, Christian Bale, Gerard Depardieu, Jim Broadbent, Eddie Izzard, and uncredited Robin Williams.  The music score is Philip Glass, and the director is Christopher Hampton, who made 'Carrington' before this one.  So the film should be better than average classic novel adaptaions, which it isn't.  This Conrad adaptation is sluggish, not knowing what it really wants to show.

One great disadventage is that we have seen the adaptation of this Joseph Conrad novel before -- Hitchcock's 'Sabotage' (1936) starring Sylvia Sydney.  (Not to be confused with the same director's film named 'Secret Agent.')  This version, not perfect to be sure, knows what it is doing, for the master of suspence turned it into a spy story with a thrilling sequence about a bomb hidden in a bag carried by an innocent boy.

However, the new version, though it is more faithful to the original novel, and proud of its great cast, has no sense of what it really is doing.  The film opens quite promisingly, with Bob Hoskins' Verloc, a shopkeeper in 1890s London, who actually is a spy in the pay of Russian embassy.  He is summoned by the Russain ambassador (very good Eddie Izzard), who tells Verloc to demolish one symbolic building in Britain with a bomb, the building which represents 'time' (you know where).

So far, interesting.  But as if to imitate the original novelist's slow moving narrative, the film unwisely introduces many flashbacks that tell us the outcomes of the botched plans.  Yes, Conrad uses (intentionally or not, I do not know) the confused narrative that seems to have lost the sense of coherent chronological order (read 'Nostromo').  Hampton not only employs this flashback method once, but twice (!) to show how Mrs. Verloc (miscast Arquatte) meets her fate.  So irritating.

The production designs are excellent, the acting is good all in all -- Jim Broadbent as police inspector and Robin Williams as The Professor around whose body a bomb is strapped are memorable among them -- and Philip Glass provides good socre.  However, all is wasted or misused, and even Glass's music starts to sound repetitious.  The film uses it when there is no need, and that is really annoying.

I like the atmosphere, and I don't think Joseph Conrad is a difficult material to make a film out of it (see 'Victory' made the year before).  But Christopher Hampton as director, though good as screenwriter, seems to have killed the material with heavy-handed direction.  And its characters that should be more interesting with a smooth story, too.",1107302400,28,2630,4.988532110091743
854133,1,6304385528,"I actually made it to the end of Christopher Hampton's disastrous adaptation of Conrad's atypical novel, but I envy the wisdom of those who gave up halfway. It's yet another in the long line of failed Joseph Conrad adaptations, and quite possibly the very worst. This German-British co-production was an infamously troubled picture that spent a long time on the shelf before being barely released, and it's easy to speculate that much of that time was spent in re-editing. If that was the case, it certainly didn't improve the end product.

Conrad is an incredibly cinematic writer at times, but for some reason the film adaptations have all too often been staid, lifeless and overly verbose, and this is certainly a classic example. Where Ridley Scott gave a visual feast to represent the failure of the Napoleonic dream in The Duellists and Richard Brooks managed an relatively intimate epic adventure with Lord Jim, Hampton merely manages a way below average Masterpiece Theater TV adaptation that is short on real cinematic flourish, opening and closing shots aside. The script never comes to grips with the web of daily betrayals on the domestic front that are mirrored by political and official ones, nor does it ever reflect the self-loathing with which Conrad filled the novel (the Verloc family is a grotesque parody of his own). In fact, all it does is hit story points while leaving character and subtext barely touched.

Hampton's direction is even worse. Despite paring down the narrative and losing whole characters, he never builds up a sense of momentum. Shots seem awkwardly timed - not disastrously so, but just never quite right - and his handling of what should have been an impressive cast (bar the typically disastrous Patricia Arquette) extremely poor. The three lead performances are particularly anodyne. Hoskins is invisible in all the wrong ways as Verloc in an utterly inconsequential performance, Christian Bale never once convinces as the retarded Stevie and the bafflingly prolific Arquette once again proves that while she may have worked with some of the top directors in the business, she's managed to learn absolutely nothing from the experience. To be fair, the performance is not her usually utterly inept zombie impersonation: she has actually risen to the level of merely being very bad, her passable cockney accent almost giving the vague illusion that there might be vague signs of life somewhere under her clumsy line readings. But as a tragic heroine, she is indeed pitiful in all the wrong ways.

Robin Williams is almost successful in his dialog scenes as the Professor, the one part of the film where Conrad's nihilistic vision of the impossibility of combating political violence remains. His scenes in the restaurant with a gaunt Gerard Depardieu (a long way from his best here) have real power, but this is dissipated by those scenes that require more that stillness. When he moves through the streets of Soho with his hand on a bomb trigger, his stern demeanor frankly looks comical. Nor is he helped by his alleyway encounter with Inspector Heat, played all too broadly by Jim Broadbent in full ""'allo, 'allo, 'allo, and what do we 'ave 'ere?"" mode. Comparisons with his corrupt copper Slater in the Britcom Only Fools and Horses are sadly unavoidable. Nor does Hampton's obsession for casting comedians end there, with Eddie Izzard's naturally hesitant demeanor making him an awkward presence as the ambassador who triggers the plot (Germanic in the novel, Russian here). He almost manages, but menacing bureaucracy is beyond him.

Making matters worse is a typical Phillip Glass score. On its own musical terms, it is fine, but allied to the images it does the picture no end of damage. It smothers the performances, draws constant attention to itself and doesn't fit the milieu at all. Only in the impressive opening and closing themes does it add anything: elsewhere it just adds the final nail to the coffin.

A complete misfire on every level.",1100476800,4,4000,5.018072289156627
854134,5,6304385528,"Not for everyone.  Powerful and true to the spirit of the book.  A lot of it is from Conrad's own life, an alienation in a world of academic ideas set against the harsh world of everyday economics in bleak London.  Robin Williams is excellent as the professor, a rebel without a cause except rebellion for its own sake.  And Phillip Glass's soundtrack is perfect, a haunting cello.

7869095,4,6304385528,"You have to take into consideration that the book with which this was based was first published in 1907 and written by Joseph Conrad, author of ""The Heart of Darkness"". Conrad is not the kind of writer to spoon-feed ""good"" and ""bad"" characters. Simultaneously, the late 19th and early 20th century was not exactly an era teeming with spy thrillers. The closest comparable tales were those by Arthur Conan Doyle and his character Sherlock Holmes. (High-adventure books, such as Allan Quatermain, were all the rage.) And yet, this is a very literary take on the suspense-thriller genre that strangely transcends its era--almost eerily. But instead of the west vs east situation that became the perfect backdrop for spy thrillers of the late 20th century, this story centers around the very beginnings of socialist and anarchist groups that would eventually rise up and seize Russia and later China.

The film captures well the dark atmosphere of late 19th-century London on the east-side. Bob Hoskins in one of his finest performances is Mr Verloc, a plain person, who owns a plain shop inside a plain house in London of the 1880's. His one asset is that he has a beautiful wife, Winnie, played brilliantly by Patricia Arquette. And she takes care of a handsome brother who is feeble-minded enough to be on the verge of retardation, played by Christian Bale in one of his earliest films. (Of course, people didn't yet understand retardation at this time, and he is labeled a ""degenerate"".) They seem a happy family. But Verloc has some dark secrets. At first, we learn he hosts anarchist discussion groups at his home. But then we learn Verloc does much more than simply provide tea and cookies to would-be criminals and traitors to the government. He has a secret life in which continental agents hire him to make political statements through violent means. And Robin Williams (billed as Jeorge Spilvyn!) is the anarchist's anarchist who becomes the pivotal character.

Although it takes a few scenes to get moving, the story concerns one of Verloc's missions gone awry that has dire consequences to himself and his family. The form of the film is brilliant and is done in such a way as not to confuse the audience. We learn pieces of back-story in flashback, and it is not until movie's end that the entire picture emerges. Chief Constable, played by Jim Broadbent of ""Topsy Turvy"" fame, has put everything together, almost. And yet, the story keeps coming back to Robin Williams, the nameless ""professor"" who is the one crucial element.

Despite some of the negative press here, I think this is a brilliant film, subtle yet quite compelling from beginning to end. The performances are all top-notch, absolutely first-rate, from Hoskins to Gerard Depardieu as a self-centered lowlife often found at the tavern drinking with the ""professor"". Certainly, if you're looking for the usual 007 spy fair, you may have to look elsewhere. But if you're in the mood for something different and cerebral, take a chance on ""The Secret Agent"".",1433030400,,3030,4.9372549019607845
7869096,4,6304385528,"All I can say is that this version of THE SECRET AGENT is truer to the original Conrad story than previous versions.  The choice of Philip Glass as composer is inspired:  it sets the tone of the film immediately.  You know from the start that this is a Tragedy in the grand, somber, inevitable sense.  The performances are finely tuned.  I can see why Bob Hoskins wanted to play Verloc:  the man is a nothing, a nobody, wanting to be somebody in an oppressive world, and he truly believes he has made a difference as a spy for the Russians.  In truth, he is still nothing, and his past has finally fallen in on him.  A 22-year-old Christian Bale is an effective Stevie, the brother of Patricia Arquette's character.  He is, in modern parlance, ""slow"", but trusting and eternally childlike, looking up to Verloc as a ""good man"".  Arquette is miscast, but that is a minor note.  Eddie Izzard and Jim Broadbent essay lighter characters, but make no mistake, this is still a Tragedy.  The most disturbing character is an unbilled Robin Williams' explosives expert, or as expert as one could be in the late 19th century.  He is in love with violent death, so much so that he is prepared to initiate his own at any moment.  The film is in full screen on one side of the disc, and 1.85 widescreen on the other.",1408320000,3,1303,4.466101694915254
7869097,5,6304385528,"I very much enjoyed The Secret Agent. If you look up ""The Secret Agent"" on Wikipedia, you'll find that this movie closely follows the novel, written in 1907. WARNING, SPOILER ALERT: Set in London in 1886. The core story within this movie is Bob Hoskins as a London shopkeeper in the pay of the Russian embassy. After many years service in which he has done no more than give information to the Russians in exchange for a dependable salary, he is told that from now on, to be paid he must produce specific results. He is asked to set off a bomb to ""shake things up"". Although he has been a good informant, he is a bumbling terrorist, as he acquires a bomb from a bombmaker (Robin Williams) and taking his wife's simple minded brother along directs him to place the bomb. However, the bomb blows up prematurely taking the life of the boy in the process. What follows is Hoskins character ""Verloc"" attempting to avoid his wife finding out what has happened to her beloved brother, and his attempt to flee the country as his bumbling has caused a death and not produced the desired results demanded by his employers. Eventually, his wife does find out the truth, and in the process discovers that her husband, whom she thought was a good man, good provider and safe haven for her and her simple minded brother, is actually a cold and calculating scoundrel. Taking revenge, she flees with Verloc's money, and confides in a fellow anarchist of her husbands (Gerard Depardieu), who leads her to believe he will protect her, but instead steals her money and flees. Left with nothing, she commits suicide. In the final scenes, Depardieu's character is drinking and feeling remorseful, when the bomb maker comes in and hears the story. After leaving the bar, the bomb maker (Robin Williams) overcome with grief at the loss of the lives of his friends, detonates his suicide vest (you hear the click of his detonator, and the film then freezes to spare us the aftermath of the explosion) thus ending the movie.",1303689600,6,1999,4.665722379603399
7869098,4,6304385528,"Christopher Hampton's ""The Secret Agent"" has received a great many hostile reviews on this website and elsewhere, and i don't know why. Except for the wobbliness of Patricia Arquette's performance (she's totally unconvincing in the film's first half, but very good in her final scenes with Bob Hoskins), this film strikes me as a lost gem. The atmosphere is alluringly dark and seedy, the music by modern master Philip Glass is a wonder, and the bulk of the cast--Hoskins, Christian Bale, Gerard Depardieu, Jim Broadbent, Eddie Izzard---is superb. Robin Williams, in an unbilled role as the most nihilistic of the terrorists, is absolutely terrifying; this is the best non-comedic performance I've ever seen him give. Unlike some other reviewers, I had no trouble with the frequent flashbacks, and the film's ending--in which Williams features prominently--is every bit as scary as that of ""Fail-Safe,"" and for much the same reason. I have never read Conrad's original novel, but the film seems true to what I know of Conrad's style and moral vision. Personally, I think ""The Secret Agent"" is on a par with Hitchcock's ""Sabotage,"" taken from the same source material.

7869100,2,6304385528,"The Secret Agent (Christopher Hampton, 1996)

Ponderous adaptation of the Joseph Conrad novel that never really gets off the ground as the thriller it wants to be. Hampton is a serviceable screenwriter (along these same lines, he was responsible for the script for Phillip Noyce's adaptation of The Quiet American six years later), but his directorial career has been infrequent, with long gaps between projects; this may be an indication of why.

Verloc (Bob Hoskins) is a double agent, working both as a spy for Russia and an informant for the British police force in nineteenth-century London. He's doing well raking in cash from both sides of the dangerous game he's playing until Russia changes its ambassador to England. The new chap wants to see some actual results from Verloc's attempts to undermine the British government, so Verloc hatches a plan that involves his wife Winnie (Patricia Arquette)'s mentally challenged brother Stevie (Christian Bale) and a bomb provided for the operation by a shady anarchist known only as The Professor (Robin Williams in an uncredited role). Murphy's Law strikes, however, and Verloc's life is irreparably shaken up as a result.

Hampton assembled a phenomenal cast for this (aside from those mentioned above, one will find Gerard Depardieu, Jim Broadbent, and Eddie Izzard on display) and then didn't give any of them a great deal to do. While this approach did work well in Wayne Wang's Smoke, The Secret Agent is an entirely different beast altogether; things actually are supposed to go on here, but they rarely do. Of all Conrad's novels, The Secret Agent seems as if it would actually be the easiest to film; no one, however, has yet succeeded in filming an adaptation of it worth watching. You can tune into this one for the cast, but don't expect much. **",1263513600,3,1810,4.966996699669967
