<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Whore/dp/B001MBVCOE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Whore</a>&nbsp;first aired in 2008, a historical drama concerning the fictional Angelica Fanshawe and her involvement in the English Civil War of the 1600s. ""New Worlds"" is its sequel, set twenty years later. Angelica is now in her twilight years and her young daughter Elizabeth (a child at the conclusion of ""The Devil's Whore"") has grown into a beautiful young woman.

For those twenty years King Charles II has reigned over England, restored to the throne after the death of Oliver Cromwell in the hopes it would quell the unrest that led to the execution of his father. But Republican idealism is not yet dead, especially with the King's agents hunting down the regicides that had his father Charles I executed.

Their reach stretches as far as Massachusetts, New England. What is meant to be a colony loyal to England and its monarchy is already filled with Puritans eager to shrug off the King's power and establish their independence.

All of this is portrayed in broad strokes: the King is depicted as a sneering tyrant whilst all the Republicans are noble men fighting for self-government and religious freedom, though there is room for a little nuance. Despite all their talk of freedom and equality, most of the settlers are completely oblivious to the irony of having escaped a tyrant only to become the very same thing to the Native American population.

""New Worlds"" gives us four protagonists: Beth Fanshawe (Freya Mavor), Abe Goff (Jamie Dornan), Ned Hawkins (Joe Dempsie) and Hope (Alice Englert), all of whom become caught up in the ideals of Republicanism in both England and America. Beth and her mother fight against the acquisition of their lands to be turned into clay pits, Abe seeks resources and the opportunity to assassinate King Charles, Ned attempts to reconcile his understanding of freedom with the fact his father is swindling the Native Americans out of their rightful land, and tomboyish Hope is subjugated by the expectations of her Puritan community.

Naturally, their lives become entangled as they move between the two continents, events transpiring to bring them together and tear them apart once more. Backing them up is a fairly impressive supporting cast: Jeremy Northam, Eve Best, Michael McElhatton, Donald Sumpter, James Cosmo, Ralph Ineson and Patrick Malahide (basically, a significant portion of the guest stars on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-of-Thrones/dp/B00KHWSD1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game of Thrones</a>).

Like its predecessor, ""New Worlds"" is a miniseries divided into four parts, though I feel ""The Devil's Whore"" handled this format better. It focused on a single woman, letting the tribulations of the era play out around her, whilst this has to juggle four different protagonists. As a result a few get lost in the shuffle, and several loose-ends are left dangling.

It can also get rather melodramatic, with certain events feeling as though they belong more in a paperback novel than in what purports to be a serious historical drama (Beth for example is the sole survivor of a shipwreck, after which she's adopted into a Native American tribe and becomes assimilated into the culture) and there's also a fair amount of trite dialogue (""How shall I live?"" ""Your heart will tell you how to live."")

But after the first episode's struggle to get through all its setup and exposition, ""New Worlds"" proves to be an elegantly crafted and performed drama. There are bouts of continuity following on from ""The Devil's Whore"" (the garter, the stunted tree, a brief voiceover by Edward Sexby) and plenty of stunning cinematography as the story moves from England to the open vistas of America.

""New Worlds"" may well attract a new audience what with the recent stardom of Jamie Dornan, but its real value lies in shining a light on a period of history that is not often dramatized. This was a pivotal time in both British and American history, and anyone with a rudimentary awareness of what comes next for these two countries will see the seeds sown for future upheavals. Of course, the best these characters can hope for is a bittersweet ending, but the ""New Worlds"" of the title does not just refer to the exploration of America, but the growing dream of independent and self-governing countries. It's here that dream first began to take shape.",1427155200,20,4644,5.297554347826087
6994224,4,B00SXFIJ2U,"4 1/2 STARS -- SEQUEL TO A MOVIE CALLED ""THE DEVIL'S WHORE"", BUT SET 20 YEARS LATER  --- IT'S STYLE MAY DIVIDE SOME FANS, BUT IS SIGNIFICANT NONETHELESS  --- (SDH SUBTITLES)

BRIEF HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE INCLUDED BELOW

Monarchists vs. Republicans, Protestants vs. Catholics, Colonials vs. Native Americans.  This four part miniseries uses fictional characters and real ones alike to delve into a turbulent period that many Americans are not that familiar with.  This period will help sow seeds for our own revolution.  It's a sequel to a movie called DEVIL'S WHORE (in the U.S. it's called  -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Mistress/dp/B00JPL5IZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Mistress</a>&nbsp;--- Here is the DVD version of the same&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Devils-Mistress/dp/B004AUP3DA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Devils Mistress</a>.  My review there explains version differences between US and UK for that title.)  The name Devil's Whore sounds tawdry, but it was also a historical drama/fiction like New Worlds.  Both series have minor flaws, but are substantial in pointing viewers to a critical period in history that is underserved.  Like the first series, many central characters in NEW WORLDS are fictitious and some real relationships have been altered to fit the story.  Because of its heavy historical content and slightly less polished feel, a few avid period drama fans could find it dry compared to big budget productions - despite the high intrigue and action sequences.  On the other hand, strict history buffs might find difficulty at certain discrepancies with real history.  I felt it falls somewhere in the middle and was much easier for me to enjoy after I did minor research on the characters.  Certainly, if one isn't at least remembering names and their importance, it can turn a little dry.  I found it riveting once I put in the effort.

THE STORY (no spoilers):  20 years after the setting of Kings Whore, Charles II has also been on the throne for 20 years since the restoration of the monarchy and death of Cromwell.  Fictional character Angelica Fanshawe (central character to the first series and namesake ""Devil's Whore"") has not only survived the restoration of the monarchy, but is a countess married to a ""papist"" husband.  She tries to live quietly with her family despite a secret connection to fugitives in the colonies. However, with other nobles coveting her land, and a powerful enemy in Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys, her seemingly idyllic life is in great danger.  Jeffreys is seeking revenge on her family as an agent of King Charles II himself.  A person heavily associated with Fanshawe in the first series is real life character Edward Sexby.  As Jeffreys places a spy in Fanshawe's house, her 20 year old daughter Beth (Freya Mavor)discovers the secret of her own lineage.  She begins to support local rebels which places her family in even greater danger.  As it happens, the man she aides and falls in love with is none other than the son of famous fugitive William Goffe who fled to Massachusetts and was harbored for a while by Rev. John Russell (according to tradition).  His son Abe Goffe is played by Jaime Dornan.  While English republicans struggle against the restored monarchy, protestants are also continuing the suppression of Catholic practices.  Furthermore, Puritans and other colonists who have left tyranny in England are involved in their own conflict with Native Americans as they use all means necessary to expand their land (and expel the natives).  ""New Worlds"" refers not only to the Colonies, but to the New World of democracy and parliamentary dominance that awaits England.

MORE HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE:  Angelica Fanshawe is fictional as stated.  However, her name is likely borrowed from Lady Ann Fanshawe who was a royalist, married her cousin Richard Fanshawe, and had 10 children.  Her life was not similar in its course to this protagonist.  Col William Goffe is an example of certain characters whose circumstances are significantly changed.  I won't give it away, but it could bother historians.  As the producers say in their own special features on the discs, the story came first, meaning general history was important, but not paramount.  Their intent was to tell a good story which brings attention to the period in general.  Some Americans will not be familiar with the name Algernon Sidney (who was prosecuted by ""hanging judge"" Jeffreys.  His works are mentioned in the same breath with John Locke for their importance in political thought being proliferated in the American Colonies.  Perhaps we are also not as familiar with the affect of Charles' revocation of the Massachusetts Bay Charter (as he cracked down on republicans and colonists) and how it shaped attitudes in New England almost a century before Bostonians and a core of others helped draw a future nation into war.

FINAL THOUGHTS:  For those drawn to this production by Jaimie Dornan, you might be interested to know this is one of his best and most natural performances.  However, if you are not particularly interested in history, this series may be harder to engage.  As I said before, it falls somewhere between the realms of either good period drama and good historical drama.  It is good, but not entirely in one camp or the other.  I will reiterate that it is much easier to enjoy with light background, which is why I included a little here.",1424736000,35,5524,5.267734553775743

6994248,1,B00SXFIJ2U,"Ok, I admit it.  I am a Jamie Dornan fan, but I also am a big fan of historical epic dramas.  Normally I adore them, but this one absolutely appalled me.  I blame myself for not really believing the admonishing review on the cover that calls it brutal.  Brutal cannot even begin to cover this dark disturbing sickening mini series.  I made it half way through the second part of which there were four.  There were two discs but I could not abide the sickening violence.  In no more than I watched, there was as follows, a bloody slitting of a deer's throat and the young 'lady' of the aristocratic house soaking her hands in the blood, a horrible beheading with the head thrown into the church in front of all the brethren, a torture scene inflicted by the English, and no less that six hanging bodies that had been flogged to death for treason, their feet and bodies dripping blood, one a woman.  Mr. Dornan, I am a fan, truly, but the brutality in this film would make Christian Grey look like Gandhi.  That being said, there are a couple of romantic scenes and if seeing Jamie kiss a very pretty blonde would float your boat, I don't know, maybe you would like it.  All we can do as we review is to give our own opinion honestly, and this film did not sit well with me at all.  I don't mind watching documentaries about history, anything by Ken Burns is a favorite, but I can do without the gratuitous violence being shoved in our faces and calling it 'entertainment.'  Here are some excellent examples of those who did this without dwelling on it.  ""Elizabeth the Golden Age,""  ""Young Victoria,"" ""Centennial"", ""The Blue and The Grey"", ""Downton Abbey,"" ""North and South,"" are just a few examples.",1461974400,25,1699,4.49185667752443

6994251,1,B00SXFIJ2U,"Boring and dreary.  I watched it within 2 days, and it was not something I ever care to watch again.  I was a boring story, with a dreary, sad, and rushed ending.  It was like the writers ran out of money at the end, and had to quickly wrap up the entire movie within 2 minutes.

6994263,3,B00SXFIJ2U,"The British need to stick to British themes. They don't do Americans well - especially native Americans. My first impression was, ""Why are the native Americans white?"" The only native with a prominent role is not a native actor nor is he even a red skin. I don't get it. It looks like the producers did very little research on native culture - or at least the culture of the natives of Massachusetts. It doesn't show in the language, attitudes, culture, dress, or homes. That whole part is a travesty.

SPOILER ALERT: The part where the sole white female survivor of a shipwreck is rescued by the native is also a joke. So the whole tribe is oohing and ah-ing over her like they've never seen blonde hair before, yet at the beginning of the movie, the natives are attacking a settlement. In fact, the natives are so familiar with the colonists that the leader can speak English. Oh, boy. And the smallpox blankets? (eye roll) Yeh, another botched history lesson.

The English history part is good. I thought Jeremy North did a fabulous part of playing King Charles. The gist of what was going on to create an atmosphere that supported rebellion is good. There is impossible romance, political intrigue, and lots of conniving going on. If you can keep up, it should be fairly enjoyable. The scenery, costumes, and lighting all very effectively create a mood. The acting is good. It's all pretty good actually until the natives come on scene. Then the writing goes in the toilet and it just gets bizarre, hence the 3 star rating.

As many have already said, the ending is WACK. Things speed way up in the last fifteen minutes. You wonder how this can ever be wrapped up in that amount of time. It's rushed, not well thought out, and goes out with a sentimental whimper. Jeez.

Nice try. It's not a total waste- if you can suspend reality.",1451865600,,1836,4.588414634146342

Indians took her son but what happened? One line had Beth saying she would find him. Abe knowing nothing.,1434672000,10,581,4.1415929203539825
