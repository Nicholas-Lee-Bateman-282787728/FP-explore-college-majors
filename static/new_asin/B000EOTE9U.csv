8112262,1,B000EOTE9U,Just had way too many interviews and not nearly enough time devoted to watching the game!  Off to Sam Goody or the trash bin.,1526428800,,125,4.208333333333333
8112263,5,B000EOTE9U,"GREAT TRUE story.  Yes, I know some of  the kids and adults involved.  But I would like this in-depth look at Little League Baseball  even if I didn't.  I wonder how the filmmakers picked the team they followed.  The team ends up going to the Little League World Series!  Any Little League family would enjoy this.",1473292800,,314,4.5

8112265,5,B000EOTE9U,"This is a great story about what Little league baseball is all about.  It focus' on a small team from Aptos, California and their run to Williamsport, PA.

It's shot in a documentary style and the producers got lucky that this team went far as they focused on them.  It shows the highs and lows of youth baseball and the over zealous parents and coaches who live their dreams through their kids.

The games provide lots of drama as little league games always do. So many hero's and so many key events that make or break a season....if you like watching little league baseball - this is a classic.",1230076800,4,596,4.440366972477064
