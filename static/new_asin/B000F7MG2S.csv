2554643,5,B000F7MG2S,"This DVD will have you knitting like a pro in no time!  I love the up-close shots, which makes following the projects super easy and the fashion show makes me feel like a designer=) As an experienced knitter I was skeptical when I read that this DVD was for knitters of all skill levels but with all the stitches and patterns this dvd has to offer, it truly is for knitters of all levels!  As a knitter of 16 years, I'm far from outgrowing this DVD and would recommend this DVD to anyone that is looking for a great knitting resource w/ cool stitches and patterns.",1159488000,5,564,4.311320754716981
2554644,5,B000F7MG2S,"Knit Stitches in Motion is unlike any knitting DVD I have seen.

It's got 12 different stitch patterns, each with a stitch-a-long to show you exactly how to achieve them. It's shot close-up, which makes it very easy to learn. The coolest thing is, you also have the option to watch the pattern with an audio commentary, which gives you additional hints and tips about the pattern you're learning. I just think that's genius!!

You also get free patterns and there's a fashion show so you can see how the stitches look on actual garments and other items.

I am now an expert cable and bobble knitter, directly as a result of this excellent DVD. Thanks so much!!",1154476800,10,660,4.576271186440678
2554655,3,B000F7MG2S,"I've been knitting for about a month and learned to knit from another DVD. It was so easy to learn from that DVD that I thought it'd be interesting to see some more advanced stitches.  I went ahead and rented this DVD and I'm just honestly not that impressed with it.

CONS:

1.  There were never any pauses to see the stitch patterns in progress.  For me, the point of having the DVD was to see everything and feel reassured that I was knitting correctly.  It would have been nice if after each row there was a pause or picture to see what the swatch should look like.  There were some patterns where I was sure I'd made a complete mess out of things but it turns out that's just the way it looked half way through.  This is probably my biggest complaint.  Just adding this step would have made it worth having the DVD.

2.  The knitting along with commentary was not helpful. I'd hoped the commentary would explain some of the more difficult stitches (beyond just knit and purl, e.g. k2tog, psso, etc) or give advice on how to make them easier.  It very rarely did this.  I can barely even remember what the extra commentary was since it didn't provide anything meaningful.

3.  The included projects weren't very interesting.  I didn't even bother to knit one of them and just did the practice swatches.  The most interesting section was on creating the pom poms.

I'm a little confused as to the intended audience for the DVD.  If you're a beginner I'd think you'd be better off searching online for free demo videos of all the stitches then learning from this DVD.  There are also free knit patterns online.  If you're not a beginner then all you probably need is the listing of stitch patterns and the DVD is unnecessary.  The projects weren't interesting enough to inspire someone more advanced, or at least they didn't inspire me.

What I did like about the DVD was the included sheet listing all the patterns.  The only reason I'm giving this three stars is that I like quite a few of the patterns and I did manage to learn new stitches. If you don't want to take the time to search out better resources online this will get you the end result of learning these patterns.",1251936000,3,2180,4.460759493670886
2554656,5,B000F7MG2S,"I received this DVD today. It is the second DVD I have purchased about knitting. I have only been knitting for about 2 months. The only project I have made is one scarf all in knit stitch. But what I learned in this DVD is amazing. I do not work for Lesure Arts and I love this DVD. Within 5 minutes of watching it I was able to duplicate the the 2X2 rib stitch shown in the video. The stitch along feature with the automatic pause makes it very easy to knit at your own pace. Because the instructor names the stitch as she does it I have learned serveral new techniques just by watching. I have learned how to do a yarn over on purchase instead of by accident, how to knit two together, how to slip a stitch as if to knit and/or  to purl, it increased my knowledge as to how to read a pattern because the DVD shows the pattern, then the instructor says what she is doing as she knits it. You will learn the Berry stitch, the Moss Stitch Panes, the 5-Stitch Cable with Bobble, the 2X2 Rib, the Slip Stitch Boxes, the Moss Stitch, the Cross Stitch Zigzag, the Trellis Lace Stitch, the Small Wheatear Stitch, the Crocus Buds Stitch, the Snowflakes Stitch and the Yarn Over Cable Stitch. You will also learn how to make the following projects: a scarf,  a shawl, a headband, a shoulder warmer, and a spa cloth. I also have the Art of Knitting DVD by  Leisure arts. I did learn how to do the knit and pearl stitch with it but it is not anywhere as good as this DVD. It's too bad they faked some of the reviews because this is an excellent DVD.",1230422400,12,1539,4.157718120805369
2554657,4,B000F7MG2S,I have viewed this DVD as an independent person from Leisure Arts.  The DVD is nicely done.  Their are multitude of stiches in the index to review and knit along with the person on the DVD.Nicely done.  This DVD provided reassurance that I was doing a few of these stitches the correct way.  I would recommend the DVD  to the beginner person wanting to learn new stitches.,1210550400,,372,4.492537313432836
2554658,5,B000F7MG2S,"I have started to knit after I have been crocheting for over a year and a half. This DVD made it very easy to start to knit. I will be using this DVD until I am good at what I am trying to knit
Thanks for another great DVD.
I also bought the Crocheting in motion over a year ago I recommend them both

2554659,5,B000F7MG2S,"Bought this DVD at a local craft store. Put off watching it for months. I was just sure it would all seem too complicated. Not true. This DVD makes seemingly complex designs simple to understand. The instructor presents each stitch pattern row by row. It is easy to see what she is doing while she(patiently)explains each stitch. While watching, I realized I already had the skills to create some intersting stitch patterns. Just never had the confidence. Now I feel ready to tackle a trellis lace scarf.",1199491200,,504,4.804597701149425
2554660,1,B000F7MG2S,"Click on ""see all my reviews"" next to each reviewers name and you will notice that 99% of them reviewed identical books, all with GLOWING reviews.  All of the books ""reviewed"" by the posters are from Leisure Arts.  Coincidence?  I think not.  Because of these false reviews I will NOT purchase anything from Leisure Arts.  Making their own reviews, puh-leeeeeease!",1187395200,37,364,5.0

2554662,5,B000F7MG2S,"This dvd is fabulous!  Definitely two thumbs up! Simply put, the knit-a-longs in Knit Stitches in Motion will have you incorporating a variety of stitches into super-fun projects with ease.  Very easy to follow and fun to knit along with.

2554663,5,B000F7MG2S,"Knit Stitches in Motion completely exceeded my expectations. I just love this dvd! It has been such a valuable resource...I use it more than any of the knitting books I have and I have a LOT of knitting books.  After knitting-along with this dvd I don't think I'll ever go back to learning through confusing patterns and illustrations.  I've only had this dvd for a few weeks but it has given me the confidence to take on the advanced projects w/ the more complex stitches and I know that if I can learn it, you can too=)",1159920000,5,521,4.360824742268041
2554664,5,B000F7MG2S,"Knit Stitches in Motion is one of the best knitting resources I've come across!  I felt like I was sitting shoulder to shoulder with the instructor because I was able to see all the stitches up close from a knitter's point of view.  As a beginning knitter I was thrilled to finally learn how to do a 5 Stitch cable with bobble.  The A-Z index makes going directly to any topic easier than ever and the auto-pause feature allowed me to progress and complete the countless projects at my own pace.  Very happy with this DVD, I would recommend it to knitters of all skill levels!",1159488000,3,576,4.40566037735849

8118837,5,B000F7MG2S,The Knit in Motion was great but I would have preferred it to be able to see and work with it on my computer.  I had to only see it and work with it on my TV video player.  I really liked the set up and how it had all the things I wanted to do.,1413763200,,244,3.3392857142857144
8118838,5,B000F7MG2S,This dvd got me started.  I didn't know how to knit.  This taught me the basic knit and purl stitches.  Loved it.,1393891200,,113,4.045454545454546
8118839,5,B000F7MG2S,"I am thoroughly enjoying this video.  It covers so much.  Very helpful for me getting started again.  Has wonderful options for pausing without hassle.

8118841,5,B000F7MG2S,"I'll admit, navigating the disk can be a bit complicated, but I love this DVD anyway. It has easy to follow instructions and plenty of cool things to try from beginner to advanced. A friend gave this to me, and no, I am not from Leisure Arts.",1345852800,,242,4.170212765957447
8118842,4,B000F7MG2S,I had this DVD from the library. I borrowed it several times for several months. I watch it over and over and over again. So I decided to just buy it! I love it! I really learn alot. I also like to watch it while you learn. I am not crazy about the auto pause feature on the computer but I have worked around it so it is ok. For new knitters this is great! I recommend it because there are a variety of projects on the DVD. There are just alot of good features.,1320019200,,461,3.863157894736842
8118843,3,B000F7MG2S,"I came close to returning this DVD because of poor quality of the disk itself. The DVD would not play in the family player, or the kids' DVD player. It did play on my husband's laptop, but that is very much too inconvenient. I finally found an old half-broken portable DVD player it would work on. But it's not like I will be siting there for over an hour, as with a movie--so it'll do.
As far as the content, I am very pleased with that. And that is why I am not returning the DVD. It's just a shame the company which produced this couldn't be more professional and kind to consumers. Shame on them! I did not get what I wanted because I can't sit and watch this on the family TV.
My advice is to not get this from amazon, but to try to find an area store which carries it. Then, if you get a bum DVD as I did, at least you can try to return it without the shipping charges.",1292630400,5,875,3.977272727272727
8118844,5,B000F7MG2S,I love this DVD and have learned a great deal more from watching it.  The stitches taught are ones that I personally like and after learning abreviations like PSSO and others I am able to now read and knit from my other knitting books.  I am a visual learner and have enjoyed the Leisure Arts video's.,1266883200,5,301,4.357142857142857
