6351733,5,B00JAGF9WY,"This is a wonderful documentary, informative, honest, and inspiring.  It adeptly follows the ""path of one of the world's great spiritual traditions from the caves of Tibet to the mainstream of Western culture.""  Fifty years ago, little was known in the west about Tibet or its form of Buddhism, and then with the Chinese invasion, Tibetans were ""scattered like ants across the face of the earth.""

Victress Hitchcock's new DVD explores the results brilliantly, documenting a unique moment in history when radically different cultures discover and begin to change each other.  It covers a whole range from the teachers, students, and groups following completely traditional forms to those making substantial innovations.  It introduces both large groups and individuals. Viewers meet famous Buddhist followers like Richard Gere and less well known scholars and practioners, such as E. Gene Smith and Togden Achos.  People and groups are introduced in short segments, and then revisited as they or their works progress.  This non-linear, light touch makes the DVD interesting and entertaining throughout - but I suspect it will also reward multiple viewings.",1421193600,10,1156,5.424581005586592

8649440,5,B00JAGF9WY,"""When the Iron Bird flies""  effectively shows the philosophical/spiritual tradition of Tibetan Buddhism has adapted and survived in our modern, frenetic western world. The core teachings of Buddha remain intact and are generally available to the western world, as explained through interviews by teachers and practitioners.  This film shows how Tibetan Buddhism has altered its style, not content,  to be better suited to the western world.  The contrast of modern music and rare archival footage help show how what is old, is new. I found this film to be fascinating and highly recommend it.",1421366400,5,592,5.26595744680851
