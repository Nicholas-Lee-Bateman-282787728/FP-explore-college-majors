2552036,4,B000F4TMI2,"""Lancelot Link: Secret Chimp"" may be remembered as a silly, Saturday-morning kiddie show, but it's really a sharp satire on spy movies. The brave but dense super-agent Lance, and his somewhat brighter sidekick, Mata Hairi, battle stereotypical international villains in eight-minute vignettes. The very funny scripts include frequent, irreverent pop-culture references (cameos by a simian Ed Sullivan; the monkey discotheque ""The Coconut Groove;"" blackout gags with chimps dressed as burlesque comics, etc.). Typical is ""The Lone A. P. E.,"" an extremely funny Lone Ranger parody culminating in an epic chicken stampede!

Technically the show is superb, with intelligent direction and clever editing. The producers took a talented bunch of trained chimps to various locales (the auto races, the beach, a western ranch, a ski resort, etc.), gave them appropriate costumes and props, and filmed their amusing antics. Then the gags were embellished in post-production, with ingenious voice dubbing by Dayton Allen, Joanie Gerber, Bernie Kopell, and Malachi Throne. (Listen for frequent, funny ad libs.) In addition, the chimps appear in each episode as a long-haired rock band -- ""Lancelot Link and The Evolution Revolution"" -- with catchy bubblegum tunes by Steve Hoffman on the soundtrack.

This DVD set, on the Image label, represents only part of the series. The source prints are very good 16mm syndication prints (the ""Secret Chimp Hour"" titles are left over from an hour-long network version that was padded with Warner cartoons). The content easily merits a five-star rating, but the 16mm image quality is a step down from the pristine episodes that ran on cable a few years ago, and someone should have cleaned the stray debris off some of the prints.  Anyway, the show looks at least as good as you'd remember it from local TV. The DVD menus are as genially nutty as the show: one of the screens is heralded by the seldom-heard ""Ali Assa Seen"" theme song! The musical sequences can also be played separately.

Hats off to the production team of Allan Sandler, Stan Burns, and Mike  Marmer for this wonderfully zany comedy series. Plenty of laughs for all ages.",1152057600,2,2166,5.177142857142857
2552037,5,B000F4TMI2,I remember this show when I was growing up in the early 1970's.  This show was excellent with the training of the chimps.  No show can compete with it.,1151712000,,151,4.172413793103448
2552038,1,B000F4TMI2,"The reason the episodes are bad quality and that they are not complete is that this dvd is an illegal, pirated edition. The production company may have gone to great lengths to try to make it seem legitimate, but it is not. The legitimate co-owners, ABC and Sandler-Burns-Marmer, are not receiving a penny from the sales of this dvd.

However, as soon as this is resolved, it is likely that a legitimate, excellent quality, with bonus content, will be made available.

I encourage all people who value intellectual property to hold of on buying this until it's released legitimately.",1151452800,8,583,4.878787878787879
2552039,5,B000F4TMI2,"I watched this as a kid, so I was happy to see this go on sale. I think it is hilarious. I watch them with my 8 year old daughter and we laugh uncontrollably. I also watch them by my self and think they are hilarious. The big budget they enjoyed is reflected in the elaborate disguises and props used.

It is well worth the money and you will be glad you bought this. You cannot get humor of this caliber just anywhere.

The monkeys make the difference!

2552042,1,B000F4TMI2,"This was a very confusing DVD selection to try and purchase as different sources made mention that this would be the ""complete"" series. Well, after viewing the DVD's it's very clear that numerous episodes were ommitted which makes me glad that I still own the ""complete"" series on videotape. My second complaint is the terrible production quality of these recordings. Could they have put any less effort into these reproductions?  Very POOR POOR quality! I'm sorry I wasted my money!

Just got my DVD set and they are 16mm prints in the half hour syndicated format BUT still very enjoyable to watch.  I always liked the musical segments and LANCE is playing the same FENDER STRATOCASTER I have.  The voice cast led by DAYTON ALLEN is worth the price of admission alone.  Also, IMAGE did a nicer cover on the actual release (Not the one pictured here). Pure fun!",1150243200,21,471,4.430232558139535
2552044,4,B000F4TMI2,"This is NOT the complete series.  This is 11 and a half episodes.  (Each Lancelot Link episode is a pair of 10 minute stories with a musical intermission by the Evolution Revolution all chimp band.) If you count each episode half as an episode, there are 22 on this DVD set.
I can't find a complete episode guide online so I don't know how many were made.  I can find titles for 14 episodes on the internet but one episode (or pair of episodes) from this DVD is NOT on that list.  How many more are missing from that list?  Does anybody know?

Here's what you get (with episode numbers courtesy [...])

Disc 1
1.9) The Dreaded Hong Kong Sneeze / The Great Bank Robbery
1.6) The Reluctant Robot / The Royal Foil
1.7) The Great Great Race / The Great Plane Plot
?) The Lone A.P.E. / Missile Beach Party
1.13) The Evolution Revolution / The Great Water Robbery
1.1) There's No Business Like Snow Business parts 1 & 2

Disc 2
1.5) Bonana / The Greatest Chase In The World
1.12A) The Chump Code Caper
1.3) Lance Of Arabia / The Doctor Goes A.P.E.
1.4) The Surfin' Spy / The Missing Link
1.11) The Golden Swwword / The Chilling Clump Chase
1.8) Landlubber Lance / The Temporary Thanksgiving Turkey Truce

The ones we're missing:
1.2) The Great Brain Drain / The Great Double Double Cross
1.10) The Sour Taste Of Success / The Baron's Birthday Ball
1.12B) Weather Or Not
1.14) The Spy Who Went Out In The Cold / Too Many Chumps

I find it strange that they'd leave off a handful of episodes and VERY strange that they chopped episode 12 in half, showing only the first part of it.  The Weather Or Not segment is missing.  End Credits roll after the musical interlude.  Weird.

Still, it's Lance Link and Mata Hairy on DVD so I'm happy.  Well worth the [...].  The show hasn't been cleaned up and is rather grainy and faded but that's part of the charm, really.  The only special feature is an option to play just the musical segments.

Here's hoping Image releases a volume 2.",1150243200,71,1969,4.362637362637362

Good for kids and adults, the funniest moments on the show is parts where the voice actors are ad-libbing because the chimps did something completely unexpected.  I was actually on a list two years befor this came out to be notified if and when it ever came on DVD.  This set I purchased was replacement for a set that got wrecked.  The onyl complaint I have abou this set is that the transfers are terrible however I don't blame it on the process, it's simply obvious that the source material wasn't well maintained and I can't imagine that they will ever digitally remaster Lance Link so it's to be expected.

2552055,5,B000F4TMI2,"Wow, now here's a memory from my childhood that I thought I'd never get to relive!  And the best thing is that it's got a satirical element that I never could appreciate when I saw this as a kid.  Sure, I understood that it was ""Get Smart"" with apes instead of humans, and I could follow the story lines, but it was those little pop culture things that I missed out on and that I was pleasently surprised at when I watched this again after almost 40 years.

For example, having a celebrity named ""Raquel Wench"" show up at a car race to kiss the winner, or the spoof of Bluebirds and Campfire Girls when Mata Hairy dresses like a ""firebird girl"" to infiltrate a bad guy's secred headquarters.  That's the stuff that just went over my head as a kid.

So, it's great to see Lance again, but it's not something that I could immerse myself in and watch a marathon.  It could get old very quickly. I'll take it in episode by episode over weeks and months, like a fine wine made from bananas.",1210809600,,985,4.268817204301075
2552056,3,B000F4TMI2,"As I grow older, I become more nostalgic for the things of my youth.  That is my excuse for liking this two-disk set, regardless of its faults.  ""Lancelot Lot Link - Secret Chimp,"" was simultaneously campy and clever, and the most expensive Saturday morning television show of its time, costing more than one million dollars for the 14 episode season.

""Lancelot Link"" was a campy send up of various spy shows of the 1960, particularly ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E.,"" but also ""Get Smart,"" ""I Spy,"" and even the James Bond movies.  Lancelot had a beautiful associate, Mata Hairi, a boss who was a lot like M, Commander Darwin, and a host of baddies working for evil agency C.H.U.M.P.  What more could you ask for in Saturday morning television?

Each week, Lancelot and Mata Hairi would thwart the evil schemes of C.H.U.M.P., using Mata's cleverness, Lancelot's cluelessness, and miscellaneous gadgets that appeared a lot like ordinary devices.  The jokes were frequently corny, the chase scenes were laughable, and the script lines frequently elicited groans, and yet, it was all fascinating.  Matching the voices to the movements of the chimpanzee's mouths was excellent.  The chimps moved well and their training was phenomenal.  Even now, I am amazed at the attention to detail and how well the chimpanzees appeared to perform everyday tasks.

Also included in this collection are a bunch of songs from Lancelot Link and the Evolution Revolution.  The music is essentially late 60's pop, mimicking groups like The Archies and Josie and the Pussycats, only with fur; mostly forgettable, but still clever.  Both disks permit you to select the music videos independent of the episodes.

I do like this collection, but only because the collection is the only one available.  This collection, unfortunately, has flaws.

The biggest flaws are that these episodes are neither all the episodes nor are they the whole show.  ""Lancelot Link"" was shown for an hour in its first season, with cartoons between the live-action portions, and for a half hour in the second season.  All that is included on these DVD's are live action portions and a goodly number of songs from Lancelot Link and the Evolution Revolution.

I could probably forgive deleting the cartoon portions of the show if we got all the live action episodes, but out of the 33 episodes produced (counting ""There's no Business like Snow Business"" as one episode, even though it was two parts), this two DVD set only has 22 episodes.  11 episodes are missing.  Why make the collection at all if you are not going to provide all the episodes?

The other problem I have is that the video has had zero clean up.  The images are grainy and dirty.  It looks like they put the film into a projector and copied the result.  Okay, I understand that the audience is limited for shows like ""Lancelot Link,"" but why charge a price for this collection that is comparable to the prices for collections that are in much better condition?

How can I recommend this collection?  Missing episodes and grainy video are difficult to recommend.  On the other hand, this collection is the most complete available, to my knowledge.  If you have been waiting more than three decades to get your hands on Lancelot Link episodes, then maybe you should get these.  If you would really like to have Lancelot Link but you want all the episodes, perhaps you should wait a little longer.  However, a truly complete collection may never exist, and I am not getting any younger.  As Mata Hairi frequently says, ""Oh, Lancie!""

Good luck!",1210377600,21,3555,4.871666666666667

2552075,3,B000F4TMI2,"When I was a child of 11(9during 1970), I watched Lancelot Link. It satired the spy genre  with chimps playing humans. I enjoyed it then.

It was James Bond/Man from U.N.C.L.E. (when is that series coming to DVD)like show combined with heavy dose of Get Smart (another missing DVD show!) thrown in for good measure, done for kids. the story was simple...Lance (Dayton Allen trying to voice a Don Adams wantabee) worked for A.P.E (Agency to Prevent Evil) again CHUMP, just like UNCLE and Control. He had a Mr Wavely type in the boss Darwin, and Mata Haira, his assistant similar to 99 on Get Smart, always solving before Lance

 It also poked fun at all other genres other than the spy format show like Westerns (the Lone  A.P.E.), Laugh-in  (with their Chimpee), Ed Sullivan and even the cartoon band the Archies (with the ape band-the Evolution Revolution)

I recently recieved  this two dvd box set. It said 12 episodes, originally there were 16 showsin the aired series-so four were missing. Then I started to watch this, the episodes were very grainy, scratched dirty copies, when I buy a DVD-I expect a clean, clear copy.

Now the good news, the satire is STILL cute and fun..simple saturday morning fare from 1970. The talent of Daytron Allen, Joan Gerber and Bernie (Siefred from Get Smart) Kopell as the voices of Lance, Mata Haire and the Baron works so well. It Takes a Thief's Malachi Throne as the narrator give this satire an over the top edge. and Mel Blanc did other voices!

I give it 3 stars for the show's biting satire which is still cute and watchable 36 years later and  the show's good casting . Be on note, the DVD copies look TERRIBLE! It seems worse than a few Bootleg film copies I have seen over the years and this is a professional company, suppose to put out a profession product

The 2-DVD set looked great but was disapointed by the dirty picture and tinny sound, theres some bad vertical scratches running on some of the episodes. A few years back I remember a seller on Ebay auctioning off at least 7 16mm LLCC reels (I collect film), one buyer got them all and I got outbid on the ones I was bidding on. I'm wondering if the winner was the one who put this DVD out though Image. Speaking of Image, they better do quality control with the product they are putting out.

8117631,5,B000F4TMI2,If you remember Lance Link from Saturday mornings back in the 70's you will love this DVD. All the good shows are here for you viewing pleasure. This is a must and should be shown to all kids of all ages. Adults show this to your kids and grandkids so they can enjoy this treasure and be sure to watch it with them.,1397779200,,315,4.015873015873016
8117632,4,B000F4TMI2,"I still have a fondness for the show, but the quality is downright awful.  No one cleaned or digitized any part of it, so even though it plays well, the picture quality is poor.",1394668800,,177,4.205882352941177
8117633,1,B000F4TMI2,"I had never seen this show but a friend recalled it fondly from his childhood, so I got it for his birthday. I think I ruined his memories because we both were stupefied at how lame it is. Maybe you have to be a kid to appreciate it- even though I still crack up at Hong Kong Fooey. I stopped watching after 15 or 20 minutes.",1389312000,,325,3.9393939393939394
8117634,1,B000F4TMI2,My grandchildren really liked it! I saw it back in the 70s and had looked for it to show my grand kids. So glad to find it!!,1377216000,,124,3.6296296296296298
8117635,5,B000F4TMI2,"This is such a blast from the past, I hope they were very nice to the chimps that worked on this show.",1376611200,,102,3.6818181818181817
