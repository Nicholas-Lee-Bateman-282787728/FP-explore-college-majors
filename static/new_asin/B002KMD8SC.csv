8372118,4,B002KMD8SC,Thourgally enjoyable on Blu Ray! Recommended to me and not disappointed. Will keep this in my Collection for many years.,1403308800,,120,5.05
8372119,5,B002KMD8SC,"I love Isle of Man TT coverage every year and this is a great DVD to have. It'd be nicer if they had more high speed camera footage like they do on the TV coverage, but aside from that the camera footage is awesome. That and they cover all the classes in TT and not just the superbike stuff. They have neat bios on several of the riders so that's neat as well. Lots of great stuff here and would suggest to add this to your collection if you're a fan of Isle of Man racing!",1311552000,,473,3.9375
