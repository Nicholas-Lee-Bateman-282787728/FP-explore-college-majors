8072865,5,B000A2WA1K,"The ""Ultimate Collection"" series was a pretty good set of Fat Albert released on DVD in 2004. I know of 4 volumes in the series, this being volume 3, and each volume has 20 episodes. Problem is they sold out very fast and they are already out of print! Those episodes on each volume are taken from the many years of the series, (they usually aired 12 new episodes every year on CBS).  Now keep in mind that the earliest years were the best, and if you are interested in seeing the episodes in order or release, there is another set to consider that begin release in 2005, and is a bit cheaper in price.

It is called ""Fat Albert and The Cosby Kids, Volume 1: The Original Animated TV Series "". There are 3 volumes so far in that set, each with 3 discs, and each one includes a bonus audio disc of the songs from the episodes on the set. This set releases the original shows in their order of release, so you are buying one season at a time. For my preference that is a better way to go as I like the early years the best. Also check out their holiday specials discs.",1134345600,,1066,4.144927536231884
