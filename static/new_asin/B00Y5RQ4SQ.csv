8717539,5,B00Y5RQ4SQ,"Predictable plot about a girl, in this case a high school student, who falls in with her teacher, a drunk, but sympathetic character. 'Nuff said.  Very high production values, good audio.  I bought the DVD to improve my conversational Russian.",1474329600,,243,5.05
8717540,4,B00Y5RQ4SQ,"I find it difficult to rate this movie. There were parts of it that I liked  the directness and the way the mostly unpretty situations were shown in an unvarnished way, a sort of rawness; the black (bleak?) humor; the pace of the movie. And then there were aspects that ""rubbed me the wrong way""... There would be too many spoilers, so I'll leave it at that. The acting was quite good, all around. The oddity of some scenes is maybe only appreciated by viewers with an outsider's perspective (non-Russians), for example a 16-year-old who in all seriousness scolds her 37-year-old teacher about his way of life.
I found the film to be a sort of a roller-coaster of emotions and it is definitively entertaining.
On another note: The SUBTITLES of the DVD I received were about 50% Polish, and the English subbing was only partly idiomatic. I speak Russian, and also some Polish, so it worked for me, but without my language skills I probably wouldn't have understood much of it.",1462233600,,975,4.6686046511627906
