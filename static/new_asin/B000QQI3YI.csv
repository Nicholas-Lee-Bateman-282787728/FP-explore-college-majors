8196887,4,B000QQI3YI,"A good documentary aimed at enthusiasts (like me) with good footage of different Migs, Sus and the like. Don't expect lot's of technical data but rather enjoy the ride behind the Iron Curtain that these film presents. There aren't many documentaries of Soviet combat jets and that's why this is a great addition. My biggest complaint is that the Su-27 is not shown anywhere and that's too bad. maybe it is a testament of the secrecy behind the Iron Curtain.
The lack of technical details is no issue for me because I rather look those up in books and the Internet.
Don't be fooled by the 2007 DVD release date. The documentary is probably from the 80's.  That doesn't mean it's bad but don't expect 2000+ editing.
I own various DVDs from the ""In the Cockpit"" series. Target Tank is my favorite.",1271635200,,794,4.591549295774648
8196888,4,B000QQI3YI,"I'm surprised this movie hasn't attracted more attention. To be fair, it's not a great documentary in the sense that it's a detailed, technical look at Soviet fighters--it's not. What it is, is a documentary made in the mid to late 80's (when there still was a USSR) that gave what is clearly a USSR-approved look at Soviet aviation. That being said, it does have some great footage--include some in the cockpit footage--of various training missions with various Soviet aircraft. There is also some treatment of the pilot's lives--how they are selected and trained, their lives in front line units, a bit of their home life (we learn one likes to make model airplanes--of wood, because plastic kits are ""rare"" in the Soviet Union). The Soviet Bear is on his best behavior--his warmest, cuddliest, best--because in the bit on Afghanistan, although the Stinger threat is discussed, there is no mention of who supplied those Stingers. In that sense, this documentary is priceless for the version of reality it attempts to show. Bottom line, it's got surprisingly good footage of Soviet, mostly tactical aviation in the 70's and mid 80's, and for anyone interested in the Soviet Union, the fact that this is Moscow's stamp makes this all the more interesting. On that account, this movie compares favorably with ""The Wing: Documentary of the F-15,"" which is the USAF mirror image--same recruiting poster airmen, same Cold War era setting, same official version imprimatur--just different planes on a different side of the Berlin Wall.",1191196800,,1530,5.075396825396825
