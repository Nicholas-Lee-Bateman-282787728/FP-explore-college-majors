414399,3,6301966376,"What do you want -- a cheap-ass documentary that doesn't give you enough details, or a rich and complete documentary?  The second one, right?  Okay, the Compleat Beatles is all right, it goes through each album and presents concert clips here and there, the movies, the TV programs, and the many people involved with the Beatles.  All in all, not bad.
But since it's only two hours long, it's impossible to get all the details -- no mention of Shea Stadium, n mention of the Hollywood Bowl, no mention of the Beatles meeting Elvis, no mention of the Rooftop Concert (although the ""Let it Be"" film is mentioned).  These are all details left out in the Compleat Beatles, but left in on the Anthology set.
Second, the only people who can tell the full and the best story about the Beatles are the Beatles.  The Anthology is the Beatles' story by the Beatles, and is therefore mre compleat, and, in fact, more accurate.  (Some of the things Malcolm McDowell says vin here are totally WACKED!!)
Nevertheless, however, this gives you a good understanding of the Beatles.  So, if all you want is a general overview, get this.  If you want a more in-depth approach (which I stongly reccomend), get the Anthology set.",1024444800,3,1208,4.665094339622642
414400,5,6301966376,"This is a marvelous documentary of the rock band that literally rocked the world, The Beatles. This film, which features both black and white as well as color segments, is a tribute to the Fab Four. It details their rise from their humble origins in the grim, port city of Liverpool, England to the unparalleled heights of international fame.

The film takes the viewer on a trip down memory lane, showing how The Beatles first started, and where it all began. It grounds their inauspicious beginnings in the context of the music world of the time. It shows the influence of American music on the youth of England, who, in turn, would end up influencing the youth of the United States in ways that could not have been foreseen. The Beatles were to be the catalyst for the rising success of British pop stars who would dominate the music industry years to come.

There is some very early footage of The Beatles in their earliest incarnations as the Quarrymen and the Silver Beetles. There is also footage of Stuart Sutcliffe, a former band member and friend, who died early in the band's career. There is also footage of their original drummer, hunky Pete Best. The film details the reason for the change in drummers, as well as the role each member played in the group.

From Liverpool to Germany to the United States for their record shattering debut on the Ed Sullivan variety show, this film captures it all. The film also showa the musical development of the group, as well as the forces that were to later drive them apart. It expertly details the beginning and the end of the greatest and most inflential rock band to ever grace the music world.

The viewer can expect to be treated to a rock and roll exposition with film clips of early Cliff Richards, Billy Preston, and Tony Sheridan, among others. An older Gerry Marsden of Gerry and the Pacemakers fame (Ferry 'Cross the Mersey) expertly expounds on the influence of American music on the early British pop scene and the rise of the skiffle bands. There are also clips from those who had worked with The Beatles early on in their career, as well as those who worked with them long term, such as George Martin.

Best of all, there is the music and lots of it. The film is a veritable cornucopia of sound and a treasure trove of information about a musical past that still influences us today. All in all, this is an outstanding documentary that should appeal to those who are fond of this genre, as well as those who are fans of The Beatles, music lovers everywhere, and those who simply love a good film. Bravo!",1023235200,26,2572,4.570498915401301
414401,5,6301966376,"This wonderful documentary works on so many levels. Besides being a history of the individual members of the Beatles and how they met one another, it also presents an overview of the other music that was popular at the time, both in England and in America. It shows the influence of Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Elvis Presley and other soul artists and rock and rollers on what became the Fab Four. Also mentioned are such popular British singers as Lonnie Donegan (who created a popular craze of the 1950's called ""the skiffle""), Cliff Richard, and Tony Sheridan. And, of course, the Beatles perform many of their great songs, either in their entirety or through excerpts. As the film progresses, I saw the Beatles evolve from originally performing songs written by other composers, to the rise of Lennon and McCartney as song writers, and then introducing new and experimental music forms via their dabbling with psychedelic drugs and far eastern religions. With their ""Revolver"" album, Harrison first introduces the sitar; ""Sgt. Pepper"" becomes the world's first rock concept album. I also learned about the enormous influence that George Martin had on the production, arrangements, and orchestration of some of the Beatles' hugest hits. The film takes the viewer all the way to the late 60's and then to 1970, when each of the Beatles becomes restless and desires to go his own separate way. The increasing strain in their relationships finally led McCartney, who was often the healing force among the four, to leave the group. While each of the Beatles had successful post-Beatle careers it would never be the same again. What is left are all the incredible songs, the movies, and all the memories of the greatest and most influential rock band of all time.",1020297600,2,1770,4.962962962962963

This delightful film is a video version of ""The Beatles' anthology"" and the story telling combined with the Beatles' own music and the music that influenced them early in their careers ""Come Together"" nicely.
In watching this video, rare footage such as the pre-Ringo days in Germany and Liverpool (Ringo joined in 1962) and footage of other popular artists of the late 1950s and early 1960s are added treats.  Part of what makes this film so effective is the personal effects of each Beatle being included, e.g. John Lennon's high school detention sheet.  In watching this delightful video, one gets a feel for, a sense of each Beatle and the people they personally knew who influenced them, e.g. Astrid Kircherr (sp) who gave them the famous haircut.

414450,5,6301966376,"Coming out in the '80's with a companion book, this was the first meaningful Beatles documentary, apres le deluge, as it were.  In a short two hours, one is treated to the story of the Beatles, with photos, music, interviews (boy, did Billy J. Kramer get cuter later on!) and first-person recollections.

I have MANY MANY MANY Beatles tapes and dvd's.  This one is STILL my favorite - even over the tape/dvd set The Beatles themselves later put out.  This one is told (I think Malcolm McDowell is the narrator) in a concise yet sentimental way: fact and heart are merged together in this telling.

If I had to pick a documentary on the Beatles to send into outer space, to tell other galaxies their story and impact on this planet, this would be the one I would choose.  It simply has the most heart and is highly entertaining as well!

Too bad it has not come out on dvd, but I can tell you that I was able to convert my vhs tape to dvd via my Magnavox recorder (which I got here on Amazon).",1362614400,4,992,4.301075268817204
414484,3,6301966376,"George Martin wasn't the manager of the Beatles, he was their producer--big difference. The only bonafide ""group manager"" Fab Four ever had was Brian Epstein. But after the Beatles stopped performing live he really didn't have much to do, but the boys needed a business manager, so they ended up hiring the rather crooked Alan Kline. George Martin produced their recording sessions, and had nothing to do with the business of the Beatles.

There really is not a very good Beatles documentary--it is yet to be produced. Both The Compleat and The Anthology are just historical chronologies that lack any real focus. The story of the Beatles is a lot deeper and far more interesting than has been told in either of these documentaries.",1359936000,2,732,4.903225806451613

I happen to find a you tube feed from a supposedly excellent laser disc and ended up using it to make a DVD version. I think it looks like my original VHS tape to be honest with you, anyway, the film is excellent even though some venues as well as songs are not the performances in the film footage but still it was the ""Anthology"" of it's time. I recommend it if you still have a VHS player or can convert it to DVD. Anthology is still the best documentary on the band but in those days it really was not considered to get the surviving members back together since there was still bad blood between the band. There are plenty of reviews on this one and I'll just say again to check it out. Excellent narration was another key as well as the interviews. I seriously doubt it will be released though on DVD, but, I have made one and can see it again over and over.

Also contains great interviews with the people closest to the band, including producer George Martin who sheds the most insight on what the Beatles really went through, plus footage of Beatles manager Brian Epstein.

Nearly a quarter of a century later, and the longer more comprehensive Beatles Anthology (1995)being the superior successor,""Compleat"" is still essential,especially for those who want a speedier trip through the history of the Beatles.

414536,5,6301966376,"This was my intro to the band as a young teen in the 80's.  It's a wonderful film and documentary, that really gives a full story of the band from beginning to end.  Really get a glimpse into the personalities and the music's creative process.  Good clips of interviews, and music performances/videos.  Great choice of songs throughout, not just the hits (such as Tomorrow Never Knows, Why don't we do it in the road, Love you too, Day in the Life), even though they are usually shortened snippets.  Small complaint, but I just wish it had some of the Paperback Writer video because I love that song, but so many great ones are here.... blackbird, I am the Walrus, fool on the hill, I'm a loser, etc etc.  Again they are usually partial songs, but they fit in alot throughout, and it does not seem slighted or chopped up.  They are seemless and fluid throughout the film segued in and out of the narrration and interviews.

The film follows the band from their childhood and formation of the band, through the early hystaria of Beatlemania, to the more serious songwriting and artistic creativity that followed, the psychedelia, the trip to India, the arrival of Yoko, the Let It Be sessions, and finally the breakup of the band.

What really makes this movie great, and one I love to watch again and again is the narration by Malcolm McDowell.  I am a big fan of the movie A Clockwork Orange also because of him, and his narration throughout that film.  He just has a great voice and reading style, and it really separates this documantaries from all others.  He just seems to add an authenticity and intimacy that makes this very enjoyable.  I also really like that unlike the Anthology, this does not include interviews with Paul, George or Ringo later in their 50's looking back.  All the clips and interviews are from the period, and really allows you see them just as they were when they were young, and the film ends with the end of the band as it should.  Their engaging personas, insightfulness, and youthful optimism and spirit really come through.

It's of course not as ""Compleat"" as the Anthology, but it really has all you need IMO.  A film you can watch in one sitting, and can watch with the family.  A movie that is enjoyable as a movie, not just a rockumentary.  Well organized chronologically, the story really builds throughout.  Fun for Beatle fans who already know it all, and an excellent intro to anyone new to the band, and an excellent way to present the band to any friends you may have that are not into them, this will convert them.",1189036800,3,2561,4.574561403508772
414537,5,6301966376,"The Compleat Beatles is one of the most enjoyable films for repeat viewings. Malcolm McDowell's narration is the key element - his voice is both melodious and passionate. The film stock is uneven in quality - but that hardly matters. The audio quality throughout is exceptional on the 1991 HiFi stereo NTSC VHS which I recently bought second hand via Amazon (August 2007) - the cover boasts ""digitally duplicated Videophonic Sound"". I can't compare it to the analogue audio of my LaserDisc version because ""laser rot"" rendered those discs unplayable several years ago. Unfortunately the VHS has unpleasantly bright, overly contrasted video with poor colour - whereas my recollection of the LaserDisc was that it looked great.

The amazing thing that you get from this movie is that it all happened within such a short time. Required viewing for any young rock musician.

There were interviews from Allan Williams (the boys' first manager), George Martin (who crafted and refined their sound for the masses), the late Derek Taylor (who would also show up in the autobiographical ""Anthology"" mega-documentary), Bill Harry (editor of Mersey Beat), etc.  And there are plenty of sound and video clips to fascinate you (I got a bit ticked, though, when the clip for ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" was interrupted).

Anyways, we rented this video back in 1984 when it first came out, and I was hooked. Even before that, I loved the Beatles, and use to plug in the headphones and listen to their old records my mom had and this just added to my taste. You see my mom didn't have all their albums, but I ended up getting them all on vinyl before they discontinued them back in the mid 80's (the capitol albums). Anyways, what I'm getting at here, if you like the Beatles, and you don't know much about them, this will discribe it pretty good, considering it's narrarated, and it's before Anthology, and it's 1984, so they did a good recap on their lives without them really telling it themselves. It's got interesting things on their childhood, into getting interested in rock and roll, since it was born when they were teenagers, to the skiffle band John Lennon formed in 1956 called the Quarrymen, to their time in Hamburg with Stu and Pete, to kicking out Pete and getting Ringo. It's all here, from rags to riches, to fame and fortune, to calm to madness. People will remember the Beatles even hundreds years from now, and I'm not the only one who believes that.

414541,3,6301966376,"Back in the middle 1980s, if you were a Beatles fan this was one of your few choices in full-length home video. The misleadingly titled 'Compleat Beatles' was one of the first direct-to-video rockumentaries to later be broadcast on PBS and cable TV, and it was accompanied by a two-volume set of books containing sheet music. (The books were available separately.)

Nostalgia aside, there isn't much here that isn't covered in more depth in 'The Beatles Anthology.' Evidentally, the film makers couldn't acquire the rights to use actual film footage from either 'Magical Mystery Tour' or 'Help!' and so these films are represented by movie stills. Very little concert footage remains, and most of that consists of audience reaction shots. It's maddening how, after Ed Sullivan introduces the Beatles we are shown only reaction shots and hear a remixed studio recording of 'All My Loving' instead of the live version. There are no interviews with the Beatles themselves, save for old footage taped during the group's heyday. And few, if any songs appear without narration or some other intrusion.

On the positive side (and perhaps I am being generous here) are some first-rate interviews with the Beatles' original manager, George Martin, Gerry from Gerry and the Pacemakers, Marianne Faithful, and Billy Preston (among others). To my knowledge, these interviews were originally intended for 'The Long And Winding Road,' which would have been a rockumentary similar to 'Anthology' except completed in the late 1970s. Indeed, it seems that 'The Compleat Beatles' was made solely to salvage the hard work already done on 'The Long and Winding Road.'

I would like to see this film issued on DVD anyway, because there's a chance that more of these exclusive interviews might make their way onto the disc as extras. 'The Compleat Beatles' may not be as memorable a rockumentary as 'Hail! Hail! Rock and Roll!' but it doesn't deserve its out-of-print status either.",1128297600,18,1960,5.11875

The film is not as complete as Anthology. The drawback is that the interviews are from 1982 (when the film was made) with George Martin and none of the surviving Beatles participated. If you want more recent, and in depth, perspective look to the Anthology DVD.
With that said, this is a good 2 hour lesson on the Beatles beginning to end. The advantage to this is you don't have to sit through 11 hours of the anthology. Here you can get the basic story. This is a great documentary considering Apple records had nothing to do with it. The story is narrated in a respectful and accurate way. Here's hoping this sees DVD release in the near future. Long live the Beatles.",1076112000,4,945,4.5321637426900585

414597,3,6301966376,"I don't mean to sound overly critical.  This is a decent Beatles documentary for what it is.  But it does have some major flaws.

1.  No actual footage from the Help or Magical Mystery Tour films is here, only still images.  I would like to think that they could show at least a short clip or two from the movies, just to make it more complete.

2.  When describing the final 1966 tour, the audio used is actually from a 1964 concert.

3.  On that same note, when the narrator mentions Candlestick Park, the footage shown IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SHOW.

4.  During the 1964 Ed Sullivan Show segment, you actually don't see the Beatles play (only random audience shots) and a studio version of ""All My Loving"" is substituted for the live performance.

5.  There are a few factual errors in the film.  For example, the narrator says that Paul bought a guitar to help him through his mother's death.  The truth (as Paul himself says in the Anthology video) is that his dad bought him a trumpet and Paul traded it in for a guitar.

This was a reasonable effort in the '80s but I think it is now obsolete with the release of the Anthology videos in 1996.  That is the real ""Compleat Beatles.""",1055894400,4,1188,4.400921658986175
414598,5,6301966376,"My Beatles education began here!  Malcolm McDowell narrates this two hour documentary which came out two years after John Lennon's death.  This became Beatles 101 for me, and when I first saw it in 1987 while studying calculus at a friend's house, I knew I had to get more of their stuff instead of just their greatest hits.  There's lots of musical footage from their shows, the Hard Day's Night and Let It Be movie, press conferences, photo stills, and more than enough Beatles tunes played over the video.
The documentary goes into a brief history of rock, and how the skiffle craze hit the UK.  All teenagers, including the Beatles got into it, including John, frontman of the Quarrymen, and Paul and George, who later joined him.  It's a wonder they survived the indifferent clubs and six hour sets in Hamburg's red-light district, and I suffered along with them, but lo and behold, when ""Please Please Me"" became a hit, I cheered along--yes, you got it made!  It's more or less in two parts--from their birth to Rubber Soul, and their creative time from Revolver to Abbey Road.
If anything, George Martin is given prominence here, as he played a vital role in turning them from mop-top pretty boys to artists unafraid to experiment with new sounds.  He tells how he recorded a string quartet around Paul's ""Yesterday,"" how he got the LSO piccolo trumpet player to play on ""Penny Lane"" after Paul saw a concert with the instrument, and the swirling organ sound in ""Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite.""  My favourite bit was how ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" became the tune it was, and I've appreciated that song ever since.  He sheds so much light on the Beatles and the recording process, it's incredible!  Incidentally, ""Strawberry Fields"" and ""Penny Lane"" became the first Beatles song to be accompanied by ""promotional film.""  And this a full fifteen years before MTV.  Wow!  Sgt Peppers is given its proper due here, as ""attitude, graphic design, fashion, language and the recording business itself changed"" as a result.
It's when the subject turns to the Let It Be sessions that it becomes painful.  The bickering that had begun from the White Album sessions had heightened and even Billy Preston couldn't salvage it.  Abbey Road was the final redemption that the Beatles could still rock and roll, even though it was very polished.  As Lenny Kaye put it, ""it's all four of them working together as a band as if they knew it was to be their last hurrah.""  It was.
When Paul sings ""Let It Be"" from the movie, it's intercut with scenes from their earlier days.  As George Martin put it, ""they were of their time, their timing was right,... and they left their mark in history because of it.""  Nicholas Schaffner, author of The Beatles Forever, and guitarist Lenny Kaye add useful commentary to the programme.  This was Beatles 101 for me and a great place for those who want to be clued in on why they are a universally-loved group.
I can watch this over and over again and feel elated, entranced, and ultimately sad, but I come out of feeling glad I got to love their music so much.  For John and George.  And for the living, Sir Paul, Ringo, and George Martin.",1054857600,42,3169,4.672072072072072
414599,5,6301966376,"I've had this video since the late 80's, and I still have not gotten tired of watching it, even after seeing the Anthology.
This should be on DVD!
A great look into the Beatles from pre-stardom up to the bitter end.
An interesting look into the Mersey Beat scene they arose from, it meanders here and there to provide some great moments from Beatlemania, and has an excellent voice-over by Malcolm McDowell that doesn't fawn or bore you to death.
Highly recommended for it's even handed (although not thorough, I mean how could an entire 10 year span ever be fairly recorded?)

414600,5,6301966376,"This is a really great 2-hour documentary on the Beatles for those people who do not have the time to watch the entire multi-hour ""Beatles Anthology"", (which was done by Paul, George, and Ringo), and who want something more serious than the mockumentary; ""The Rutles-All You Need is Cash"", (which features a cameo by George). ""The Compleat Beatles"" gives out a great deal of infomation on the Beatles, and includes parts of many of their songs.  It deserves to be out on DVD as VHS does not do it justice. I'm positive it would be a very big seller. The Beatles should, (at some future date), also put out on DVD, an all-concert video; i.e. Shea Stadium and/or some other arena they played. There are some all-concert VHS tapes of the Beatles that could be easily upgraded to DVD.",1025568000,6,780,4.611510791366906
