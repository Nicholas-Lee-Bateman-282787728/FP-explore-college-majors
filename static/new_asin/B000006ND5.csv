1195781,3,B000006ND5,"Every one likes a good pirate movie.whether it be johnny depp and the carribean or dustin hoffman in hook.for my generation it was this film
I cant say it measures to the flicks I just mentioned or any others in the genre
But than again it shouldnt because its more of a spoof and satire than anything else.starring christopher atkins as freedric and kristy mcnichol as his love interest mabel, this movie with its clique plot and silly song routines will be entertaining enuff to keep you  busy for the 100 minute it runs.the charming ted hamiliton totally steals the show.and for the end all I can say is pizza time!
I like this movie for its simple story and cute characters

Then this is probably the movie for you.

This movie is probably not what one would call ""good"" or even ""not terrible"" but I gotta say, I think it is fun as hell and I'm stoked that I own it. Half of these songs have a vicious tendency to get stuck in my head and then I'm humming it all day long because they are seriously that catchy.

1195815,5,B000006ND5,"I bought this movie first as a VHS tape and then as a DVD.  Pirate Movie is a great comedy that uses exceptionally beautiful locations.  The acting is goods and the humor is too if a bit adult at times with some swearing and sexual innuendo.  Some of the jokes are related to popular movies of the day, so younger viewers may not get them all, but people who love the movie get them.  The music is also very well done and include some excellent songs.  This is one of the rare times I had a song get stuck in my head and actually enjoyed it.  The Pirate Movie is worth far more than the meager asking price, and I'd tell anyone to get a copy.",1468108800,,642,4.055555555555555
1195816,5,B000006ND5,"I was so happy to find this on DVD. It was always one of my favorite ""I need a laugh"" movies. And some of the songs can get stuck in your head for days.

Dowdy Mabel (McNichol) meets the man of her dreams (Atkins) at a demonstration of swordsmanship. He invites her to go sailing, and to ""bring a few of her friends along."" The friends, much younger and prettier than Mabel, send her to get food and leave her on the dock, ""kidnapping"" the young man. She tries to sail after them but is wrecked in a storm. The rest of the movie takes place in her head as she's unconscious.

A delightful blend of Gilbert and Sullivan music with original then-modern tunes, this parody of Pirates of Penzance will leave you smiling and humming the rest of the day. Will Frederic (without a K) and Mabel (also without a K - God they have so much in common!) get their happy ending? Only one way to find out!",1467504000,6,890,4.229411764705882

1195831,5,B000006ND5,"Why this movie did not do better is beyond me.  For those that don't know, The Pirate Movie is basically a retelling of Gilbert & Sullivan's The Pirates of Penzance.  However, it is not a movie adaption of the musical any more than Young Frankenstein is a movie adaption of Frankenstein.  The basic story is there, but there's many changes.  Most of the key songs are there with different lyrics and some original songs as well.  In short, I would call it parody of The Pirates of Penzance more than anything.  Whatever you do, do not take this movie to seriously and if you're a die hard fan of the Pirates of Penzance, you probably will not enjoy this take on it (Though I do enjoy both on different levels).  I must have watched it a dozen times on HBO as a kid.  Some movies you loved as a kid lose their attraction when you grow up, but for me, it's even funnier now that I get even more of the jokes.  I was never a fan of Kristy McNichol, but she really shined in this movie and Christopher Atkins was good too.  I can't believe it's not on Blu ray or digital anywhere.  Thank you for a chance to re watch a movie I thought I would never see again.  Now if only Amazon would get the soundtrack on CD for a reasonable price.",1455753600,7,1230,4.187234042553191

From the completely adorable and sexy Kristy McNichol and teen heart throb Chris Atkins who play teen lovers...that fall in love at first sight - well first song...to the hilarious Pirate King, played by Ted Hamilton, and his Bejeweled Codpiece this movie just kind of sucks you in.

If you're a first time watcher, come at this with an open mind expecting a campy time machine to the 80s and you'll have a great time.  I recommend gathering a few friends and having a few cocktails (if you're of legal drinking age).

The only downside I'll note is that most of the great stuff is in the first half of the movie.  It slows down considerably and drags on a bit in the middle (but it does have a killer closing number - who doesn't want a happy ending?).",1397865600,3,696,4.088235294117647

Maybe it was just another way to watch Chris Atkins without his shirt for 2 hours, following the Blue Lagoon.  It is a comedy, so it is all fluff with no seriousness at all intended.  I found it fun to watch, although very silly, without having to think at all.  Kristy McNichol was at her peak of popularity, so it was a great film for her to show off and even sing.  Parent may wan to watch before showing it to the kiddies due to some sexual innuendos, but otherwise it is harmless.  It is pure fun, silliness and enjoyable.",1389052800,,605,4.2631578947368425

1195946,5,B000006ND5,"I might love this movie so much because I first saw it as an 8 year old. Most of the jokes went right over my head but pirates + 80s music + first love + a strong woman lead + a happy ending AND a cartoon sequence made this daily summer viewing. But, I still feel happy watching it 30 years later, which is really not the case for a majority of movies that caught my imagination as a child.

You can read the 1 and 2 star reviews but they all miss a couple of critical points: the movie wasn't meant to be an award winning film and it wasn't meant to be a remake of the Pirates of Penzance. It *was* meant to be ridiculous; to be full of puns, long forgotten cultural references and innuendo; and to make people smile. For example, my favorite quote from the movie is:
Mabel: ""Frederic, these are the 1880s. You can't live your life by the outmoded conventions of a neo-imperialist society. Find your true center!"" Frederic: ""What? You mean Zen piracy?""

Standing the test of time (especially if time spans childhood to adulthood) is one of the clearest indicators of the quality of a story. This movie has succeeded in just that way for many many people.",1388016000,2,1155,4.317972350230415

1195948,5,B000006ND5,"Fun. Really, its the only word to describe this. Its not realistic in any way; in fact due to the tongue firmly in check nature of the storytelling its even less 'real' then most musicals. But. It is a lot of fun to watch and the music always leaves me smiling.",1384387200,,261,4.137254901960785

1195957,4,B000006ND5,"I saw this movie, when I was a young girl and never could forget it. Christopher Atkins' smile was pure sunshine, Kristy McNichol was delightfully lively, and snarky, and everyone from the pirates to the police were just plain, silly fun. Sure, it's dated, as are references, nor is it something to take too seriously, but it's loaded with '80s nostalgia with the pop music, bits of animation, and movie references, which make it a lot of fun for my contemporaries to watch and chuckle over. It does get a bit racy, but it never takes itself too seriously. At the same time, the plot goes at a fast pace with a few moments of gravitas, well placed amidst the madcap comedy. It's not for everybody, but those who enjoy it tend to have a real soft spot for this movie.",1372636800,2,766,4.439716312056738

I loved the scene's where one could tell by looking at him,that Chris Atkins' character lusted after Kristy mcnichol's heroine. And how he trhobbed at the sight of her heaving bosom in a tight corset. Also,his loyalty to the pirates who raised him as they were all orphan's,and guilted him into staying because of that shared thing in common,that was pitifully funny. But,his love was true in the end when it came to losing her. Also,whether they really sang their own songs or had singers fill in while they lipsynched to the music,had this viewer intrigued. This was a must have movie i had to have and got at christmas,when i was younger. True love shall prevail in all walks off life.the dvd should be cheeper though,for an old movie such as this.

Werribee Park - the mansion and Loch Ard Gorge where the pirate bits were filmed.

Hilarious to watch them come up the cliff from the beach and appear in front of the mansion given that each are many, many miles/kilometres apart.

1196008,5,B000006ND5,"I've been trying to find this movie for 20 years.

I saw this movie when I was in Yugoslavia as a kid.  Its ""Happy Ending"" Theme, Cute Puppy Love, Great Songs, Slapstick Comedy Style with Blend of Modern Parodies with Old Pirate Setting, Guantanamo Human Rights, Pirate Honor etc. is overwhelming and very inspirational that one forgets and totally overlooks the TV-production-ish negatives.

I want Kids to see this movie because I feel that it subconsciously made me the way I am: good humored, solutions oriented, creative, and strive for the best in life, which boils down to simply, ""Forget Your Worries, and Have A Happy Time!"".

And that's what the movie is about, taking one through a Roller Coaster Ride in a fun park, Running you through cute Slapstichs, Romance & Love, abit of Sex Feel, Songs and Dance, and then going to the turning point of the movie where everything seems to go downright bad, a big crisis. Then suddenly our heroine realizes that, in that ""Thin Red Line"" between Success and Failure, there is one Freedom that Absolutely No One Can Take Away from her- and that is the Freedom to Choose a Happy Ending and Influence the Rest to do the same!

Thanks to the movie makers, Stars (Nichols, Mr. Freddy and the Pirate King), for shaping me the way I am.  I would definitely want to meet these people in the future (if possible) and will look to buy the blu-ray when it comes out!

It sounds like a strange thing to say, but having recently discovered the tripe that he starred in has really done something to me.  What that is, I'm not sure, but this is a movie that slipped under the radar.  It deserved to slip under the radar, but going back to this hilarious song and dance takes me back to a simpler time.

This is a modern day version of Gilbert & Sullivan's Pirates of Penzance.  It's rather campy and silly with the off color humor, the hoaky costumes, and the typical Ugly Duckling story.  The Pirate King is Fabio, Kristy McNichol is the nervous geek girl, and of course Christopher Atkins (who choose to embrace his teen idol status rather than fight it) bares his chest a lot.

Have fun with it.",1216771200,,773,4.401408450704225
1196023,1,B000006ND5,"Well, I hate to admit to being wrong, but there actually is a worse Sullivan & Gilbert adaptation than ""Gentlemen of Titipu"".  This one seems to pin its hopes on the presence of some delectable eye candy - namely, Chris Atkins, fresh from taking his clothes off in ""Blue Lagoon"".  This is a performance that ""runs the emotional gamut from A to B"" - as the brilliant Dorothy Parker once snipped about the equally brilliant Katharine Hepburn.

Don't worry, friends; it goes downhill from there.

The film in question goes by the title ""The Pirate Movie"".  The reason for the title is, apparently, that the people responsible have pirated some pieces of Sullivan's ""Pirates of Penzance"" - just enough to make you wish they had pirated the whole operetta and jettisoned the drek they added to the maimed remains they used.

Appearing in this wanton travesty are a bunch of little- and un-knowns who couldn't have salvaged the production even if it was good.  Which of course it isn't.  So the whole baggage sinks under its own dead, dead, dead, boring weight.  Well, it wasn't their fault, really; it was a job for a lot of people who, judging by their credits on the IMDB, didn't get many.  The names are withheld to protect the presumed innocent.

The story of ""The Pirate Movie"" follows the general and well-known outline of ""Pirates of Penzance"" (which is easy enough to look up if you don't know it) - although with a number of rather stupid changes that sap it of its original vitality.  To substitute for this vapidity, a composer was hired to write some ""up"" music.  His talent, if any, is scarcely on display.  What we get meager quotations from some of Sullivan's ""Penzance"" tunes - although not always readily recognizable and usually not in the spirit of the original.  Then there is a lot of stuff in a two-bit modern idiom that is also wholly out of touch with Sullivan's originality and wittiness.

This film is so awful on so many levels it's hard to find anything positive to say about it.  The color is vibrant; that is to say, wasted on what it shows.  The sound is at least too good for the material.

Ah, well.  At least Atkins runs about in descamiado mode for most of the film, which I suppose is some slight compensation.  And not enough.  Avoid this turkey.",1205107200,9,2278,4.600496277915632
1196024,4,B000006ND5,"I happened to catch this on TV in the early mid-eighties; I was ALMOST a teenager when I first saw this.  I thought it was funny then.  Then, a couple weeks ago, I saw it on TV.  I had never remembered what it was called until seeing it this most recent time.  I didn't get a chance to watch the whole thing as I had to go to work, but I was laughing so hard I decided I had to buy it.
Needless to say, as a tween I didn't catch all the jokes, so everything I laughed at then was still funny as well as a few others.  A few boo-birds are trying to give this a bum rap.  I don't think it was necessarily intended to be someones riff on Pirates of Penzance.  It's more of a parody of Penzance, interlaced with satirical commentary of a 1980's sensibility and what was important at the time...sort of.  LOL

It is not real (who wants to be around murderers and rapists), but who does not want to revel in the sun and sea and be a bit tipsy and love and be loved.  Well, movies are not for moral instruction they are for enjoyment  While certainly silly and certainly tongue in cheek, and cheeky, this IS fun.  The locations are wonderful in Australia on in Victoria in mid-summer with blue skies and heat, with beaches, cliffs, gardens and pretty gals and handsome (for you ladies or men inclined so).  Common on!  Us Yanks ought to loosen up a bit (I would rather spend time in this little uneven crazy world of sun and fun than in 99 percent of the television and movies that are on today!

And yes, I had the soundtrack, on vinyl, which I listened to on my Fisher-Price (portable) record player...we won't go there...

But I have to say, this is one of those movies which becomes highly enjoyable as an adult - in a juvenile, flashback to your youth sorta way - because as a kid, you miss all the punchlines and innuendo, blinded by the pretty blond boy...and there is nothing better than having the light of realization dawn - finally - in your adult years, when you can sit back and say, 'Oh, so that's what that meant!!!' - and as crummy as the music is, I am ashamed, and thrilled at the same time, to report that I still remember EVERY WORD to those gawd-awful songs!!!

The thrust of the movie was not so much to ""remake"" Pirates of Penzance, but to update it and make the humor more accessible to a new group of people, as well as poking fun at those who believed that the now subtle humor of ""Pirates of Penzance"" was only for the ""highbrow.""  Well, giving a bit of a background of Gilbert and Sullivan their humor at the time was aimed squarely at the rigidity and formality of the upper classes, and was considered slapstick, silly and highly accessible in its time.  This movie pokes fun at the upperclasses, and was highly offensive to the reviewers of the time because of this.  Sit back and enjoy it, but also realize that this movie does far more than simply make fun of Pirates of Penzance, Star Wars and Raiders.....",1183852800,3,902,4.50920245398773

It's really enjoyable to watch all the cheezy singing and choreography.  It's funny how when you are older you finally understand the sexual undertone of things and the humor.

1196051,4,B000006ND5,"The movie is a fun musical romp. It is like combining Mel Brooks ""Blazing Saddles"" with Gilbert & Sulivan ""Pirates of Penzance"". That is fantastic! if you like the Bawdy Sexual Innuendos and Sensual jokes that Mel Brooks is famous for. But you might expected better from this director who also did ""Those Magnificent Men and Their Flying Machines"".

The leading actors are a pleasure to watch. Kristy McNichol is nearly flawless and I too am sorry to see she stepped out of acting. As of 2001 it is said she is teaching acting in a private school. Christopher portrays both innocence and passion! Their kisses are electric and the sensual humor will have any mans privates in a buzz.

The song under the water (with the dancing fish) is blatently referencing sexual actions and oral sex. Other than that, the song has a catchy beat and it is a fun way to portray the protaganists searching for their treasure.

I do Not recommend this film for Youth under 18!...

The DVD transfer is excellent. The grain at the beginning is intentional. If I explained, it would be a spoiler. Just look on the table next to the pirate announcing the next event; you will recognize the device.

1196060,5,B000006ND5,"The Pirate Movie is  an example of a movie that fared poorly at the box office that eventually reached a much bigger audience through such means as cable television, VHS and DVD. This is particularly true of HBO which repeatedly ran this flick over and over during the 1980's. As a result, later audiences were given a chance to appreciate The Pirate Movie as being the work of genius that it really is.

The Pirate Movie concerns the adventures of Mabel Stanley (Kristy McNichol) and her ex-pirate boyfriend Frederic (Christopher Atkins). Years ago, the Stanley family fortune was stolen by the evil Pirates of Penzance and Mabel enlists Frederic to retrieve it for her. Of course, Frederic insists that Mabel accompany him in his adventures against his former fellow pirates.

Along the way, Frederic and Mabel encounter a host of eccentric characters. Among these are Major-General (Bill Kerr), Sergeant-Inspector (Garry McDonald), Pencilstub (Marc Colombani), Aphrodite (Linda Nagle) and the fearsome Pirate King (Ted Hamilton). In the course of these adventures, Frederic comes to realize that he must choose between the true state of love that he enjoys with Mabel on the one hand and both duty and honor on the other hand.

The Pirate Movie is silly, funny, hopelessly romantic and definitely original. It is a model example of a goof ball flick. It was killed when it was originally released in 1982 due to mundane movie critics who could not comprehend its true originality as a comedy. All the critics could see was a parody of the play ""The Pirates of Penzance."" It was that, but it was also so much more. The fact that there are a number of sugary sweet pop songs in this movie makes it all the more wonderful. The Pirate Movie also features a great deal of slapstick silliness.

Maybe we can get a Baskin-Robbins ice cream tie-in!""  Whatever the rationale, ""The Pirate Movie"" ended up being one of the most deliriously enjoyable guilty pleasures of my childhood. Even at age 10 I knew it was trash, but I loved every moment. Now that it's on DVD, I find myself skipping the interminable love songs but relishing the shameless camp humor and nearly credible renditions of Gilbert & Sullivan's hits.  Kristy McNichol is, indeed, adorable, and I'm sorry she didn't make more films.  ""Tell him, Harry!""  Christopher Atkins was obviously cast for his resemblace to Rex Smith (Frederic on Broadway).  He is endearingly dimwitted in the role, and displays his tanned, toned physique to maximum effect.  Ted Hamilton is a hilariously lecherous Pirate King, and Bill Kerr is a credible Major General.  The jokes swerve from the sophomoric to the inspired, and the throw-away gags usually work the best.  For instance, at one point the Pirate King pretends to twirl his non-existant moustache, then looks confused when the imaginary 'stache makes a squeaky sound effect.  As stupid as it is, it's hard to dislike because the entire cast seems to be having so much fun.  So switch off your brain and enjoy ""The Pirate Movie.""

Oh yeah the review on this movie. IT IS NOT.. I repeat NOT! The Pirates of Penzance 100% yes the songs are there, but there are a LOT of fun 80's songs too. Also this has a lot of humor as well.  I find myself quoting this movie a lot, and I think that if you love silly, funny movies then you are in for a treat when you watch this movie. Don't expect anything, just watch and laugh.",1135900800,4,1141,3.75
1196069,3,B000006ND5,"If you're looking for a serious Pirates of Penzance film when you view The Pirate Movie, then you're going to be sorely disappointed. If you are looking for some silly fun in a brilliant send up of the very serious Pirates of Penzance then this is it!

As well as a poke in the eye to those in Hollywood who would have us believe that sex needs to be brought out front and center, this film is rife with sexual innuendo! You get a light-hearted pleasurable feeling watching this movie. The actors all appear to be having such fun and it becomes terribly contagious.

Supposedly the studio that released the film was more than a bit surprised that the film did as well as it did. The critics hated it but the public went - if not in droves.

The stars - by all rights - were never truly film stars: Kristy McNichol was a very hot property on television, but not on film. Christopher Atkins was the current boy pin up of the week who was wildly popular for his pretty-boy looks and his seeming indifference to wearing clothing on film (The Blue Lagoon, A Night in Heaven), but he has never been known for his ability as an actor. His very casting ( and maybe unbeknownst to him) seems to be a wink at his barely clothed reputation, but also to cash in on his pin up status.

Musicals are not terribly popular with boys, but girls love 'em. Casting Atkins guaranteed a steady stream of nubile young girls attending the film, while McNichols' rather unthreatening appeal kept the female filmgoers from feeling jealous. Atkins strikes quite the romantic leading man's presence in and partially out of the fantastic costumes even if he can't act; and McNichol looks more soft and feminine than she's ever been seen before. I don't know if the two got along, but if they didn't, you couldn't swear it by me, because these two seem to be having the time of their life.

There are several songs in the film that are takenly directly  (or rathter spoofed) from the Pirates of Penzance. ""I am the very model of a modern major general"" is absolutely wonderful. ""Taren Tara"" is beautifully performed. ""Pirate King"" is fun and silly. ""Pumping and Blowing"" is a duet with McNichol and Atkins that when heard and viewed cements the reality that this is innuendo. McNichol is actually quite good as a singer. Atkins' singing ability is painful at best - but certainly not cringe-worthy (Heck, even Gene Kelly kept being given roles where he sang and danced - and he couldn't sing - he was a trained dancer!).

Today, more than ever, with so many PG rated films being far more ""adult"" than need be, this playful, romatic, cheerful, and frankly wholesome for the whole family romp is a breath of fresh air on the DVD circuit.

You'll be tapping your toes to the songs, laughing at the dialogue (as was intended), and viewing this more than once.

Yes, this is a heaping helping of cheese! But for pete's sake if you can't get a kick out of some cheesy filmmaking on the light side, then you're taking yourself far too seriously.",1130284800,10,3009,4.52670349907919

It is wonderful to finally have the film in widescreen, Fox released the Pirate Movie in Australia(region 4) back in 2003 but it was only a pan & scan with no extras. The most disappointing thing about this edition is the Commentary with director Ken Annakin. He appears to have very fuzzy memories about the shooting of this picture. Having been to all locations for this film(entirely shot in Victoria - apart from the begining when mabel misses the boat and has to hire one shot in Rushcutters Bay on Sydney Harbour. He also talks more about other films he has worked on, rather than the Pirate Movie. Werribee Mansion and Loch Ard Gorge are the prime locations for this film. The most amazing thing i found when going to Werribee, is that all rooms and furniture seen in the film are there, Annakin simply set up cameras and shot away.

1196081,5,B000006ND5,"From my title, the Pirate King didn't know what to say when the pirate ship was about to hit land. Thinking about it as he scratches his head, the ship strikes land that is inhabited by 20 beauties. This was right before the Pirate King asked his fellow pirates about what they needed. All of them replied, ""SEX!!""

Anway, when I first saw this movie on cable I loved it. Call it campy, cheesy or a B-movie. It was goofy and was one of those shows that if nothing was on T.V. this would be the one to take out and watch. It's straight out of a 80's movie funbook. For a while I was looking for this on VHS (I'm aging myself) and I found it on Ebay a few years ago. I wasn't even expecting to find this to be released on DVD. Needless to say, I wash shocked. It's a typical 80's movie complete with a good soundtrack and good acting. It was your typical movie complete with one or two actors and actresses that we know of, and blends a crafty soundtrack. It won't win any grammies as the acting will not earn emmies but it just simply pokes some mild fun at the pirate genre as well as the Pirates of Penzeance.

This movie is a spoof of pirate movies. You have Christopher Atkins (The Blue Lagoon), Kristy McNichol (Empty Nest), and the actor/producer Ted Hamilton. Ted Hamilton is the Pirate King as well as the producer of this movie. The movie is about Mabel (McNichols) who is considered an outcast. In the 80's this would either be a nerd or someone who has no friends and is not popular. When Mabel hits her head on the boat, she dreams of this classic tale; girl meets boy and they live happily ever after. In between are pirates led by the Pirate King (Hamilton). Frederick (Adkins) was also a pirate but he felt it was time to retire as well the fact that he would rather die than join the very pirates who could be the ones who made him an orphan.

All of this adds to fun, humor, playfulness, good singing parts, and a nice take on the pirate genre. It's funny watching the pirates try to ""park"" their ship. The duel between the Pirate King and Frederick is funny. Ted Hamilton plays a good bumbling Pirate King. You wouldn't expect a Pirate King to have a ""cup"" that makes squeeky noises (like a clown nose) amd his continued reference to his package when he is forced to defend it. LoL. Also watch for the light sabre sword used by Frederick (towards the end). The DVD is pretty bare bones as it gets; some commentaries but that's it. It would of been nice to see music videos added from the soundtrack. The closing song ""Give me a happy ending,"" is cute with all of the actors at the end singing and dancing.

This is a good addition to anyones DVD library. This movie is for any fan of the 80's movies, spoofs, or just looking for a movie that can substitute for nothing on TV. While it won't (and it hasn't) win any awards or get (and it hasn't) high praise from critics, it's a cult classic.",1121990400,2,2908,4.26268115942029

The Pirate Movie is loosely based on The Pirates Of Penzance, but don't think you'll find much similarity aside from general plot here. Taking place in some odd dream sequence, Kristy McNichol's character wishes to marry before her older sisters despite family custom. When she meets an x-pirate and is determined to marry him, all sorts of odd adventures and cheesy swashbuckling mayhem ensue in between bouts of raunchy humor and hilarious pop songs. The sexual humor is abundant, or even extreme at some times, but it's all in good fun.

I loved it! The concept making a farce of the farce known as Gilbert & Sullivans PIRATES OF PENZANCE was brilliant. Ted hamilton does a greta job as the Pirate King and who could condem Christopher Atkins (The Blue Lagoon) and Kristy McNichols (Family) over campy romp with music and dance?

The brekaing of the ""fourth wall"" was the best part for me. I love it when they looked at or too the audience for support or reaction.

The Pirates were hysterical and the Major General and Chief Bobby were over the top - at their best! The music is hip and upbeat - refelctive of 1982 and the costumes were cleverly intertwined. It really looks like they all had a lot of fun!

The audio commentary is great and listening to the director, Ken Anakin (Long Day At The Beach) reminice about the shoot was great. I remember buying the Beta  and Laser Disc copy of this. I even have the original RECORD soundtrack....

I wish there was a Making Of documentary on it or I wish Chis and Kristy could have done the commentary too! That would have been fun!

This is a fun, fabulous farce. Campy and filled with music and inside ""sexual Innuendos"", Star Wars jigs, Comic Banter and nonsensical gags. I loved it and you and the whole family will too.

The director's commentary was great... would have been nice to have Ted Hamilton on it as well, but I wasn't expecting any commentary at all so I can't complain.

HOWEVER, I first noticed problems during the scene where Frederic uses the telescope to see the girls twirling their umbrellas and the circular view through his scope was right of center.  I then compared the DVD frame by frame with the original fullscreen release and there's actually a significant ammount of MISSING PICTURE along the wole top and right sides of the screen throughout the whole movie!  Things are cut off everywhere... when the camera scans up and shows all the way to the top of the pirate flag in the fullscreen version, the widescreen version cuts off much of the top of the flag.

It's like they just zoomed in on the fullscreen version and trimmed the edges to fool people into thinking it's widescreen, totally defeating the purpose of the widescreen format to preserve the movie in its original capacity.  This makes me pretty mad, and I hope they come out with a proper release someday.  Until then, there's still good reason to hold on to your VHS release of this great movie.",1112054400,3,1307,4.627705627705628
1196090,5,B000006ND5,"I love this movie. It is kitschy, it is juvenile, it is everything as bad as the critics say it is, but hey, this isn't Bergman or Antonioni, or Fellini. If you want edification, look elsewhere. This movie has no pretensions, it is just good clean fun, and above all it is happy. Even the director himself, in his accompanying commentary, is befuddled by it's eventual success and he attributes it to it's happy storyline which seems so rare in our sad time. With all its adolescent antics and blatant sexual innuendo, it still retains a surprisingly innocent feel to it. It's a pleasure to watch it again after more than 20 years.

Thank goodness this movie was released by Anchor Bay and not some cheap fly-by-night company. The film is transfered in it's original widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1 (enhanced for widescreen TV). I must admit that my heart sank when the opening credits rolled and the picture came out extremely dark, grainy and grimy. But that was apparently deliberate and the picture becomes immaculately clean as the camera draws away from the TV screen showing the stock footage of the opening pirate attack. I doubt if anyone has seen this movie in this pristine a condition since it was first released. The colors are rich, lush and brilliant with well rendered blacks and pure whites. In some scenes the brilliant reds and greens are so vibrant they look like they originated from old 3-strip technicolor reels. Picture detail is well nigh perfect, so much so that the tackiness of the cheap primitive matte shots stand out all the more.

The original dual channel stereo has also been remastered to 5.1 surround but I personally prefer the old stereo image. The new 5.1 sounds slightly artificial.

Kristy McNichol is adorable. It's sad to learn that this was her last major film. She burnt out far too soon.

Aside from the director's commentary and an old TV trailer, there are no other extras. But the beautiful transfer of this cult classic is alone worthy of the price.",1111536000,120,2001,4.75792507204611

Judging by the comments here at Amazon and at other sites I see that I'm not the only one that holds ""The Pirate Movie"" in high regard! A critical and box office disaster upon it's summer of 1982 theatrical release the film found it's audience on video and cable TV. I remember at the time of it's brief run in theaters I read many reviews blasting the filmmakers about being disrespectful to the creators of the original material. Leonard Maltin calls it ""Appalling"" and goes on to say ""...not only trashes the original but fails on it's own paltry terms"" Ouch, Len! Based upon Gilbert & Sullivan's play ""Pirates Of Penzance"" (which wasn't Shakespeare)  itself a fun, silly musical romp! In my opinion, the filmmakers were true to the original source while making it accessible to a modern audience. ""The Pirate Movie"" holds up quite well even with all of it's 1980's sensibilities.

About the DVD: Anchor Bay has done it again! A beautiful DVD Widescreen presentation! The movie looks and sounds better than ever and the packaging includes the original movie poster art. The insert includes a 5x7 reproduction of the movie poster. (BTW- all Anchor Bay titles include a 5x7 movie poster reproduction insert.) The original theatrical trailer is also included. The other special feature is an audio commentary by the director of the film Ken Annakin and the Anchor Bay DVD producer is moderating the discussion. The commentary is rather disapointing to me because it's more of a chat about the career of Mr. Annakin than a scene specific commentary about the movie they're viewing. The commentary contains many interesting tid-bits of information and trivia just not all about ""The Pirate Movie"" There is a slight spoiler in the commentary track (during the end credits) about Clint Eastwood's ""Million Dollar Baby"" so, be warned. Plus Mr. Annakin has an interesting theory about what really happend to Amelia Earhart. As I said, the commentary discussion is all over the place! The director has fond memories of the film as do the rest of us who have embraced this delightful musical romp! Perhaps inviting Kristy McNichol and Christopher Atkins to the recording session would have made for a more interesting and balanced commentary. It's not that I'm complaining! I'm happy to have the film on DVD, even if there were no commentary at all! The song in the finale says, ""Give Me A Happy Ending"" and now thanks to Anchor Bay and 20th Century Fox this film has the happy ending it deserves!

The only place this DVD loses a star is in the Directors commentary.

I found a used copy that I paid 10.00 for in a used video store.

1196102,1,B000006ND5,"I am stunned by how many positive reveiws I am seeing here.  This movie was a lazy mix of washed up 1970's teen talent, leftovers from The Pirates of Penzance and an Olivia Newton John album.  Well, I take back that last part...Olivia Newton John actually made music that was considered good and got radio play.

The comedy ""tone"" the filmakers were shooting for was something on the level of Bugs Bunny or Blazing Saddles.  Instead we get actors looking into the camera and trying to be cute, enough homosexual references to make it NOT okay for the kids it was supposed to aimed at, and unexplained set pieces that exist just to give the actors something to play with.  Why would there be a magician's false bottom coffin prominently displayed in the home of a wealthy governor?  To top all of this off, we have backhanded references to Star Wars and Indiana Jones that merely make you wish you were watching one of those movie instead of this one.

In one scene Chris watches Kristie strip down and says, ""I've never seen a woman like that before"".  To which she replies-""Hey, the body is an eight, but the mind is a ten!"".

This is the best written dialogue in the whole movie, it's that bad.

The Happy Ending song did make me happy because it meant the movie was over.  But then I was sad again because they played it during the final dance sequence...and then again during the

unexplained present day ending (are they married now?), and yet again during the credits.  But hey, it's Kristy's dream!  She can do what she wants...except make this turkey a good movie.",1095638400,8,1572,4.548042704626335
1196103,1,B000006ND5,"Like many in Australia, I grew up watching a crummy VHS tape of The Pirate Movie, and it was a film that in spite of going over my head a lot at first, really captured my imagination. As a satire of adventure films, it really hits the nail on the head, and often.

As an adult, however, the problems with the VHS tape version are readily apparent to me now. A pan and scan transfer that only allows us to see part of the picture (thus the picture ofen doesn't make sense, particularly during fight scenes), and a sound mix that is as flat as a tack. Sometimes, the vocals are utterly inaudible during the songs (the Pirate King's big number being a prime example).

So imagine my despair when the film was released on DVD in Australia last year, only to contain the same VHS-quality pan and scan video transfer, and the same flat-as-a-tack audio. A real kick in the teeth to the poor souls living in this country who supported the film on initial release, and a wake-up call to anyone who thinks they can just slap anything on DVD-Video and it will instantly look or sound better. People have asked me questions along the lines of ""isn't this better than nothing?"". It is worse than nothing. At least when you have nothing, there is a decent chance the distributor will eventually release a decent version. Not surprisingly, the enthusiastic response Fox were expecting for their pan-and-scan, flat Dolby stereo DVD pretty much evaporated as soon as the reviews were in.

So Fox, I have the following to say about this upcoming release. You've already made a hash of it in the country where the film was made. Get it right this time. Give us the proper aspect ratio (judging from some shots, it looks like a 1.85:1 hard-matted film), and if you can't get the original source elements to create a 5.1-channel mix, at least remix the Dolby Stereo so that cannon shots sound a little more aggressive than mechanical coughs, for one thing. Don't assume that you can just slap the material onto a disc and expect it to sell. Learn from the Australian market mistake.",1095552000,12,2061,4.564864864864865

Bad movies are usually a lot of fun and this one certainly is. Maybe it's pure nostalgia, maybe it's because I love Australian movies and maybe it's because there is nothing here that can offend anyone, unless the fact that Kristy McNichol spends most of the movie scantily clad offends you. (as it certainly doesn't offend me!!) Australian acting legend Bill Kerr is great as the Major General, and his line ""I'm older than the Beatles but I'm younger than the Rolling Stones"" always has me laughing. Ted Hamilton's turn as the Pirate King also deserves praise, who after ripping the sails as he desends them holding nothing but a dagger, turns to his put upon mistress and says ""sew that up love!"" giving the audience another throw away but very effective gag. As for the music, the film gives us a great mix of Gilbert & Sullivan standards and 80's pop music, obviously the producers had a mind to appeal to older people as well as the ghetto blaster generation.

Anyway, the soundtrack is awsome and I still know the words to all the songs by heart, and the costuming and locations are beautiful as well.  I still wish I had a dress like the one Kristy McNichol wore.  Sure maybe some of the acting is lacking (but I don't think they were really working towards an Oscar) and the jokes are outdated, but this movie is just pure fun!  I especially like the scene when Frederick is seeking the treasure and the animated fish dance and sing around him.
I really hope FOX gets their whits together and put this movie onto DVD.

However, I've always found this film to be delightfully charming in its own way. Following the storyline of ""The Pirates of Penzance"" yet not afraid to veer off in its own wild and eccentric direction, this one's an unexpected charmer. It showcases a lot of the songs from the original operetta, done with true panache. Altogether, I find it much more entertaining than the work it's based on (in particular Kevin Kline's bland rendition thereof).
The Pirate Movie is very much an early '80's film that comes accross as dated, and yes, some of the original songs in it are wretchedly silly. But it has a few really neat original numbers in it as well, in particular the closing song.

Watching it again recently I half expected to laugh through it,and find it to be not as amusing or fantastic as I did when I was 10.  I was surprised when after  the movie concluded, I realized that I still LOVED it!  I love this movie  for different reasons then I did years and years ago (for drooling over  Christopher Atkins, and wanting to be Kristy McNichol) The music is  wonderful and the scenes are entertaining and comic.  I think the actors  did a wonderful job making this a very fun movie to watch over and over  again! I'm so glad I have rediscovered ""The Pirate Movie""!",959385600,,641,4.364406779661017

1196139,5,B000006ND5,"I spent my teenage years in the '80s and now I am well into my 30s.  I have adored this film since the first time I saw it.  Last year I was lucky enough to purchase the soundtrack on vinyl in a little record shop in  London.  I was thrilled!  If the people in Hollywood would just take notice  and re-release this film on VHS and DVD it would obviously make a lot of  people happy.  I would also love to get the sheet music for this film,  because the songs are great.",954633600,5,469,3.956989247311828
1196140,5,B000006ND5,"I am an 80's child, and one of the best movies ever was The Pirate Movie.  It was one where a glass wearing shy girl finally gets what she deserves...the cute guy. It was funny, action-packed, and a bit romantic.  I would love to own this video, but am having a heck of a time finding it.  Can anyone help an 80's lover?",954374400,3,320,4.0476190476190474
1196141,5,B000006ND5,"To chance upon this video being reviewed by people who actually liked it was a real find.  To find it can be purchased - manna from heaven! I first saw this movie when I was about five, and I fell in love with the boyish  blondie, Christopher Atkins.  Ive seen this movie MANY times!  The music is  absolutely breath-taking.  'How can I live without you' must be one of the  best songs ever!  The jokes are horribly corny, but you don't really care  because the whole aura is just... freakishly good.  Great for girly slumber  parties and the like.  Ill be watching it when Im eighty!",952732800,6,584,4.40566037735849
1196142,5,B000006ND5,"Finally, Fox has re-released one of the best movies that I've ever seen!  The Pirate Movie has it all; songs, comedy, action, and fun!  Kristy McNichol and Christopher Atkins are so incredibly great in the roles of  Mabel and Frederic.  Truly cheesy fun for the whole family, even including  sexually themed jokes that only adults will get.  It could only get better  if this was released on DVD!",952646400,7,396,4.735294117647059

It is a fun movie for the young and old.  It  is a combination of an action movie and a musical.

From ""Pumpin' and Blowing'"" to  ""I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major General""  this movie keeps  you ""Hangin' On"" from start to finish.  I would always become so  absorbed in the movie that I felt like I was a part of it.  If you haven't  seen it,go to your nearest video rental place and rent it tonight!

The film loosely based on then Pirates of Penzance has most of the good songs mixed up with junk songs like ""Give Me a Happy Ending"" filled with half backed skits and off color puns it is hard to watch this to the end. There is no chemistry among the actors and even Kristy sleepwalks through her part.

Well if you can not think of anything original then corrupt a classic.",1504915200,,446,4.506172839506172

7904568,5,B000006ND5,"I grew up watching this movie. It's a spoof on The ""Pirates of Pensance"", which is a spoof itself. It has great cheesy 80s pop songs, as well as altered songs from the operetta. If you're looking for a serious movie, or one that will make you think about life, the universe, and everything, this is probably not your bag. If you're looking for fun and a bit of cheese, this is it.

There is sexual innuendo in this movie, but I didn't get it as a child, so maybe watch it first to see if it's one for the entire family.",1502150400,,519,4.088235294117647
