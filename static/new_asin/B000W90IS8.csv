2963468,5,B000W90IS8,This was a BLAST from the past. Very 1950 television and must give it a great big 5 stars. Due to Tom Sawyer (Bobby Hyatt) is my father.....Great to watch!,1418774400,,155,4.2
2963469,1,B000W90IS8,"The Chrysler  commercial in middle of show was really bad, never saw a commercial in a online movie like that before",1381190400,,116,4.523809523809524

8221756,1,B000W90IS8,"This is not a television show, this is a car commercial with a little bad drama thrown in to spice things up. John Carradine's performance is simply awful; he should have been thrown out of the Screen Actors Guild for this. It is no wonder that the actor who played Huck Finn, Charles Taylor, was never heard from again, since he plainly had no acting ability. On the whole, this was a regrettable viewing experience.",1524441600,,417,4.573333333333333
8221757,1,B000W90IS8,"This is NOT Huck Finn AT ALL!  For starters, there's no Jim -the runaway slave whom Huck befriends and through whom Huck learns 1) that black men are as human as white men and 2) that society's views (in particular toward slave-holding in this story set in the pre-Civil War South) are not to be trusted over one's own heart and convictions. Uh, that was Twain's main point in writing this novel: satiric societal commentary. How in the world could this piece of trash have been made from the first Great American Novel? Twain must be rolling over in his grave. Chrysler Corp who sponsored it should be ashamed of itself.",1506556800,,621,4.594594594594595

8221760,3,B000W90IS8,"The 1955 Chrysler commercials (when they owned Plymouth and Dodge) were the high point of this tale.  Mark Twain is probably rolling over at the slash job they did of his story.  And no Jim, by the way.",1445990400,,202,4.2894736842105265
8221761,1,B000W90IS8,Worst adaptation ever! Don't waste your time watching it.,1445472000,,57,5.444444444444445
