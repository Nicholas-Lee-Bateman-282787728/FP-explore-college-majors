Performances by Adam Baldwin, Lloyd Bridges, Patrick Cassidy were excellent. The topic, for the time the movie was made and presented, was very controversial, but timely and relevant to ANY time period. A truly REMARKABLE movie. If it is EVER made as a DVD, I will purchase that, also.",1355270400,,428,4.72

7904317,5,B000006FQ6,"I saw this on TV back in the 80's and have been looking everywhere for it on DVD.  It's a fantastic movie, a mini-series, but so well acted and I think one of Alec Baldwin's best performances, other then maybe Hunt for Red October.  A great drama and you don't know who's the killer until the very end. I am so thankful that Amazon has listened to customers and obtained this on DVD.  Thank you so much.",1329523200,6,403,4.207792207792208
7904318,4,B000006FQ6,"""Dress Grey"" is a compelling story of intrigue, set within the ""US Grant Military Academy"" (a thinly-disguised pseudonym for West Point).  A cadet's body has been found dead by drowning.  The protagonist (Alex Baldwin, in a bravo performance, one of his best) learns that there is more to the death than meets the eye, and that a cover-up is in progress.  The story develops quickly, and it is a powerful story of military politics, gays in the military, and other controversial topics.  The film has a gothic feel to it, and constitutes first-rate entertainment.  The supporting cast is excellent, and Hal Holbrook and Lloyd Bridges in particular turn in excellent performances.

This is a fine film, and it is extremely unfortunate that it is not available on DVD format.  It should be.",1240704000,3,788,4.924242424242424
7904319,5,B000006FQ6,"Set in the height of the Vietnam era, a murder and cover-up within a military academy and the pursuit of the truth finds a young Alec Baldwin (his best role since Joshua on Knotts Landing) trying to save his own neck while politically uncovering the truth about what actually happened. Alec gives a passionate and believable performance of a lifetime in this role. Alive with military intrigue, this 2-part made for TV movie has everything to keep you on the edge of your seat for the 192-minutes of its running. Stellar performances by Hal Holbrook, Susan Hess, Tim Van Patten, & Lane Smith round out a fine cast for a tale of twisted intrigue and suspense.",1231545600,,658,4.681034482758621
