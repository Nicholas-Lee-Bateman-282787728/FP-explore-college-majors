7873602,2,6304458630,"UFC 10 featured a good deal of fighters grappling and fighting each other while they were on the ground.  It is not, in my opinion, too much different than the other UFC's that I've seen so far, such as UFC 4: Revenge of the Warriors.
If you want to view a UFC tournament that contains a great deal of action, buy UFC 6: Clash of the Titans.",991872000,5,341,4.08955223880597
7873603,5,6304458630,"After the last UFC, a good show was needed and yes it was delivered! Don Frye was back to defend his ""tournament title"" against 5 newcomers and 2 other veterans. Frye did prove his grit, as he ended up in  the finals against former Olympian Mark Coleman. The final fight would  prove to be an all out war. There were no Superfights, but the final was  just that, as it made people almost forget the so-called  ""superfight"" in UFC IX.",964137600,,433,4.375
7873604,5,6304458630,THIS VIDEO IS A MUST FOR UFC FANS. THE FIGHTERS ARE MEANER AND TOUGHER THAN IN MOST UFC`S PRIOR TO THIS CHAMPIONSHIP. THE SUPERFIGHT BETWEEN MARK COLEMAN VS. DON FRYE IS EXPLOSIVE. THESE TWO WARRIORS ARE WHAT HAVE BEEN  MISSED SINCE THE KEN SHAMROCK VS. ROYCE GRACIE BATTLES.,935452800,7,275,4.729166666666667
7873605,4,6304458630,"This is the only UFC where no submission holds were applied.  Lots of striking.  Coleman makes his NHB debut, Frye and Goodridge are back.  There are better UFC's, but this is worth seeing.",932256000,5,189,4.666666666666667
