5958965,3,B00EZDHVU0,"Michael Caine is a good actor.  I rented this film because he was in it. I have enjoyed his work through many films. This story is somewhat interesting and I love the location However, I think it would have been better is Michael had played who he is, not an American and certainly not someone from New Jersey.  Why, I don't think the accent worked.  Secondly, the end of the film was confusing for me, didn't quite understand how they got from point a to point b.  Third, has the whole world forgotten that film is a visual medium? Even in these films were people feed compelled to tell other people their motivations, there is too much talking.",1383523200,8,646,4.4491525423728815
5958966,5,B00EZDHVU0,"If you want a movie with intelligent dialog- excellent acting, and a story that will touch your heart, this movie is for you.
if you worry about all the plot points being perfectly logical and 'realistic' maybe rent something else. at one level it's unreasonable for Clmence Posy's character to be so interested and open to essentially a complete stranger, but if you put logic on the back burner for a while, the story is very affecting, and very well acted. wholetoothmaui.com",1383350400,36,478,4.841463414634147

The direction, editing and screenplay allow the story to unfold so that the depth of the characters and story could be fully realized.  Perhaps because I am older and have lived long enough to wonder why I still exist that this movie speaks to me to so poignantly.

5958987,3,B00EZDHVU0,"Micahel Caine is always wonderful,(in spite of a terrible American accent here) and his co-star Clemence Poesy is every bit his equal.  Set in Paris, the City of Love, the film promises to be an echo of another May-December romance, Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper in ""Love in the Afternoon.""  However, mid-way through this one the tone changes into family dysfunctionality.  Too bad.  It doesn't quite work and the ending is terrible---a real cheat.  Still watch it for Caine and the lovely Mlle. Poesy.  Turn it off two-thirds through and make up your own ending. .",1445817600,,566,4.84375

5958999,2,B00EZDHVU0,"This movie is severely flawed. The story left me confused and unsatisfied at the end.

Michael Caine (whom I usually count as an excellent actor and like to watch him) uses an accent which fluctuates between somewhere in the U.S.A. and the American South.
It removes credibility from the character.

5959011,5,B00EZDHVU0,"Michael Caine once again comes through with a great performance. The story is lovely and touching, and I was not prepared for the ending. Watched it several times. Being a senior, many things easy to identify with.",1419897600,,214,4.8108108108108105
5959012,2,B00EZDHVU0,"I know the ending in ""Last Love""  can be viewed as perfectly true to life, especially if you have some of that gloomy French existentialism in you. But to me, it was simply an author's conceit. It would have been just as true to life if it had gone the other way. I won't explain as I don't want to be a spoiler.
 The director/scriptwriter made several mistakes, in my view. Matthew/Caine is supposed to have been a Princeton professor yet from time to time we get a hint of cockney in his voice and speech rhythm. Why not make him a London professor? I also needed a stronger motivation why this lovely young girl, Pauline, attached herself to him. Still mourning his wife, and near 80, he was no bowl of merriment. Nor did the fact that he had taught/knew  philosophy, give him any solace. Pauline's new attachment near the end of the film did not ring true either. A better director/scriptwriter would have led us up to it. In the French novel, whose title translates as sweetness/gentleness assassinated, Matthew is French and Pauline is a shop girl. This film made me think of that superb French film ""Amour."" It is also about the end of life and there is not a false or unbelievable moment in it. So if you don't mind languid, slow-paced films you may like this film. Since I am a senior, one of the pleasures of the film for me was when Jane Alexander, Matthew's  dead wife Joan, appeared. She is my idea of a beautiful woman. No wonder Matthew was in mourning three years after her death.",1419811200,2,1496,4.4489051094890515
5959013,4,B00EZDHVU0,"If you are in the mood for a poignant film about an older widower who literally stumbles into the path of a Parisian dance teacher and how their lives are transformed by their friendship with Paris as a lovely backdrop, this film offers that. Michael Caine plays lonely grief hauntingly. Clemencine Poesy is a radiant young woman who exudes compassion. The film is in French and English. It is slow moving at times. It is an interesting study of relationships and life's stages and provokes thought.",1418601600,,499,4.813953488372093
5959014,1,B00EZDHVU0,"And we got another pathetic film about an old couple tried so hard to reignite their romance and salvage their shipwreck marriage, decided to go back to Paris, rent the same room when they had their honeymoon a trillion years ago. But later found out that only loathing, disgust and despise to each other, a deep cynicism remained in their marriage. And in this pathetic and another highly unlikely film, we had an old fart, a walking-dead and walking-stiff American(?), played by the English, Sir Michael Caine, a widower aimlessly and mindlessly lived in Paris, the city of forever romance, just awaiting the Guy in the Black Hole to summon him anytime. Then miracle happened, a miracle that could only happened in a MOVIE; he met a young French woman twice younger his age. Then he suddenly rejuvenated, started to shave his white beard daily, had his fuzzy hairs on an almost baldy head professionally cut, shampooed and hair saloon-ed. Then his son with a broken marriage showed up and messed up the relationship and took over. What a pathetic but also so stupid scenario, I cried out-loud and asked myself: What is the purpose of making this movie? Why suddenly the movie makers became so interested in producing such kind of fantasy to fool we old farts? Then as it seems not enough to quench such last hurrah of romance, yearning to happen by most senior citizens, came the even more stupid and disgusting movie, ""Elsa & Fred (2014)"". Lord of Mercy, when you become such an old fart with all the joints hurt so bad day and night, with blurry eyesight with floaters swimming freely in your eyes, loosing, stinking rotten teeth, bad smell and mysterious odors oozing out of your body, with chronicle constipation, uncontrollable gas rumbling inside that results constant farting, noises whistling in your ears, swollen knuckles, shrunk muscles no matter how you try to exercise, white stubs under your chin...yet you are still craving for young women...and if you still have lot of money, would it be still possible to happen? And that's your shameless secret, your hush-hush wet dreams. Yeah, right, senor. Would you please give it a rest?! Where I put my reading glasses? Did I turn the gas off?",1418515200,,2203,4.830687830687831
5959015,5,B00EZDHVU0,fabulous movie,1418083200,,14,6.5
5959016,4,B00EZDHVU0,"""Last Love"" is not your average love story. Set in Paris, it is unique in the sense that it explores the special bond that forms between a grieving and lonely American widower, Matthew, (played beautifully by veteran actor Michael Caine) and a beautiful, young dance teacher,Pauline (played by the luminous Clemence Poesy). Three years after his wife's death, Matthew is still bereft and feels like his life has no meaning. One day while on the bus, Matthew takes a tumble, and Pauline comes to his rescue, insisting on seeing him to his apartment just to know he's ok. Matthew becomes smitten with Pauline and before long, the pair become good friends.

However, Matthew's inner demons are still there and he still misses his wife. A suicide attempt leads to a hospital stint and also brings Matthew's estranged children, Miles (Justin Kirk) and Karen (Gillian Anderson) from the US. The siblings want their father to move back to the States so they can keep an eye on him, and are cynical about Pauline's presence in their father's life (Karen calls her ""the bimbo"", and Miles' warns Pauline not to take advantage of his father).

The story meanders along, and is saved by the strong performances of the two leads: Caine is consummate as the grieving widower, and Poesy is breathtaking as the loving Pauline who has inner demons of her own. I felt the story  would have been better off without the introduction of the two siblings. Gillian Anderson is completely wasted in her minor role as the constantly harried and agitated Pauline (who apparently has domestic problems of her own). When I compare her performance in the BBC's ""Bleak House"" to this, I can only wonder at what prompted her to take on such an unrewarding role. Kirk is also rather wooden in his depiction of the angry son and the father-son scenes between Kirk and Caine are quite painful to watch because Caine's performance totally overwhelms Kirk's underwhelming attempts.

I would have liked to see the plot focused in more on Matthew and Pauline's friendship. What the pair share is so special and unique and I really enjoyed their interactions with each other: what initially seems to be a gentle courtship dance turns into a genuine affection and friendship, so unique and beautiful in its purity. If only the filmmakers had devoted the film to this story of two vulnerable souls seeking solace in each other, without the secondary plot that cascades into a mess of awkwardness and ends with a rather, in my opinion, bizarre ending. I still enjoyed it though, and would watch it again, if only for the scenes between Caine and Poesy.",1417132800,,2610,4.832214765100671
5959017,5,B00EZDHVU0,Michael Caine can do no wrong he is such a brilliant actor and a delight to watch this is a very nice film and I did enjoy it.,1414454400,,126,3.5357142857142856
5959018,2,B00EZDHVU0,"What starts off as a charming tale of a retired Princeton philosophy professor (Matthew Morgan, played by Michael Caine) barely hanging on in Paris after the death of his wife, his life given new meaning by friendship with a young dance instructor (Pauline, played by Clemence Poesy), becomes much less lyrical and winning after Morgan's grown children are introduced into the story.
The two offspring suddenly materialize after Morgan makes a feeble suicide attempt, and the caustic words exchanged by family members and their mixed motivations quickly muddy the simplicity of the original storyline. Morgan's attempt to kill himself makes sense at the time, as a response to memories of his wife made even more raw by his new feelings for Pauline, an impossibly youthful romantic object. But, in the aftermath of the suicide attempt, the story devolves into interminable heart-to-heart discussions and family squabbles. Pauline, caught in the middle, ends up carrying too much of the weight of these family troubles and, no longer the mysterious stranger in Morgan's life, becomes just another combatant.
Part of the beauty of the story lies in the gentle flirtation between Morgan and Pauline, which transcends their age difference, but that spell is broken when Pauline and Morgan's son develop an attraction for one another. Morgan attempts magnanimity, wishing his son the best even when that includes having Pauline, but the two men's hasty attempts to patch up years of differences don't really ring true.
SPOILER ALERT: Then, in a baffling ending, Morgan apparently satisfied that he no longer has unfinished business, appears to succeed in a second suicide attempt. This time no one seems particularly upset, and Morgan's son and Pauline walk offscreen arm in arm. Huh??
The movie is partially redeemed by the acting of Caine and Poesy, who, even when working with uneven material, are both a pleasure to watch.",1413590400,,1921,5.2

He has his books and a few friends, but his kids and their families live in the U.S. and don't have much time for him. He's sad and lonely, and just going through the motions of daily life with no joy and nothing to look forward to. He meets a lovely young dance instructor, played by the charming Clmence Posy, quite by accident and they start to hang out together. She listens to him and cares about him.

The two characters are perfectly cast, and the settings in his handsome apartment in Paris with a view of the Eiffel Tower, and his country home, are just stunning. This is a slow, sweet, quiet relationship movie with emotional highs and lows, no violence and no sex.

And so no way in this beautiful woman of a city is Michael Caine compelled merely by relative youth.  The entire notion and plot absolutely rings false.  I don't sense n'syncness or sympatico.  Basically this does not go in the same bin as truly madly deeply or even the deceptive lost in translation.  This is about disempowered hella grossness.

5959064,4,B00EZDHVU0,"A widower struggling with loss of a wife he still deeply loves, an unlikely friendship with a young woman, and the complexities of adult children with families of their own--as imperfect as modern families are. This movie does justice to its human drama, especially with Michael Caine playing the lead role--except that you quickly forget it's Michael Caine, who takes on the persona of the character in a humble, unassuming and all too human manner.  Clmence Posy, in the lead female role, is sweet and deep at the same time, completely believable as a dance teacher, who is lonely despite her good looks and the superficial male interest it draws. There is much to love and to identify with here. Some plot choices might be unlikely in real life, but overall this story and the setting in Paris make the movie more than worthwhile. Whatever one's family circumstances are, this movie touches on relevant emotional issues and makes you think. It's a good one.

5959066,5,B00EZDHVU0,"Sandra Nettelbeck (""No Reservations"", ""Helen"") wrote the screenplay and directed this small movie rich in emotion.  In this we are looking at how people love, all types of loving relationships, not solely romantic.  Nettelbeck makes you feel as if you are a fly on the wall while you are seeing everything and experiencing these things right along with these characters.  This is also how I felt when I first saw her movie, ""Helen"".  Another heartrending movie full of emotion and very patient in love.

When the film begins, Matthew (Michael Caine, who is phenomenally understated in this) meets Pauline (Clemence Poesy) by happenstance on a city train and they quickly form a bond. He has been extremely lonely since his wife, Joan (Jane Alexander), passed away some years - about 3 - ago.  Joan and Matthew's son, Miles (Justin Kirk), and daughter, Karen (Gillian Anderson), immediately get out to France and meet Pauline, who by now has strong feelings for their father and his towards her.  Karen seems like she is not phased by anything while Miles is filled with contempt towards his father, then turns it on Pauline.  Working out that anger becomes a major issue for Miles; he doesn't have all the facts about certain life-altering information that he should know.  Matthew is grieving so hard and also has his feelings all mixed up with Pauline's.  He has just undergone a horrible tragedy with the death of his wife and Miles thinks it is way too early for his father to be involved with someone that could be his granddaughter.

We see Joan as Matthew sees her, in the present, when she comes and advises him, snuggles next to him in their bed, or is with him so he is not alone.  You see the loving relationship that they had in their long term marriage and are now seeing him with Pauline as they are starting to open up with each other.  Things grow quite slowly in the film, it takes its time with the character development and the different relationships to form.  Growing them to fruition?  I wouldn't want to spoil this movie.  I enjoyed its slow pace and lackadaisical feel.  There are times when it will speed up, but always downshifts quickly.  This isn't a movie with action, suspense, physical fighting, it is more for your thoughts; cerebral if you will.  You could call this story emotional and moodily thoughtful.  It certainly made me think about my relationships and how important are second chances, and third, and fourth ...",1396396800,5,2454,4.756501182033097

5959097,3,B00EZDHVU0,"It is extremely difficult to find fault with Sir Michael Caine's work even when he is attempting to bring his masterful characterization capabilities to a looming tragedy being played out in the story.

The other two principals in the movie do an adequate job with their roles as the muse/with daddy issues and the son with daddy issues, but only adequate. I will admit that there was just one moment when the son is told something important to the story line that the actor manages to let his facial facade drop and you can actually see that, for that very brief moment, he was in complete tune with the story. Unfortunately, that was one moment in the entire movie that was not dependent on Michael's performance.

I would offer that if the writer had been really bold they might have attempted to tell the story of the recently (3+ years), widowed professor with only one character - Michael, and the story would have been more powerful, but more difficult to write, for taking that bolder path than the more maudlin path chosen.

That having been said, the story does play out as a more average tale of lost love and coming to grips with that loss in a manner that is more frequent and mundane. The story tries to push the audience to understand that one scene will lead to a more intense, but similar scene, in the very near future in the piece and I personally find that unreal mechanism to be annoying. After all the viewing audience may be brighter than the writer and director can fathom.

If you enjoy Caine's work than this movie will only add to your pleasure but if you are looking for a less-than-heavy-handed attempt to deal with such a poignant reality as meeting the end of the road then you might go elsewhere.",1390953600,2,1728,4.546623794212219

I read many of the reviews for this movie and thought I would buy it for my wife, but I watched it first.  I was surprised at how it affected me.  I guess it's because I had a similar relationship with my father, as did Matthew with his son.  It made me think about what my mother went through when the love of her life died at age 54 and she lived 25 more years without him.  And it made me think about the love I have for my wife.  Of all the people she knew when we met, why in the world did she pick me?

8610819,2,B00EZDHVU0,"Review of Last Love
Hot Toasty Rag, December 1, 2017

Its tough to decide whether or not to recommend watching Last Love. If you're a Michael Caine fan, youll probably want to watch him do some incredible acting, but you won't want to watch him in such a sad story. If you happen to like sad movies, you might want to give it a try. But, as much as I love Michael Caine, I could have skipped watching this movie. It was just too depressing.

The beginning of the film falls under the what does it take category of the Academy Awards. Michael Caine is sitting at his wifes deathbed, and after shes passed away, outsiders come in to try and remove him from the room. He fights them, wanting to stay with his companion as long as possible. I don't think its possible to watch this scene without bursting into tears, and Im sure Michael was just as baffled as I was that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar that year. Believe it or not, the rest of the film isn't really any more uplifting.
Jane Alexander plays Michaels late wife, and she visits him several times throughout the film, talking to him and giving him advice on his attempt to start a new chapter. He meets a French dance teacher, Clemence Poesy, and strikes up a friendship. The audience is supposed to realize that his unrequited crush is doomed to remain unrequited, because unless Clemence has grandfather-issues, she won't look at him as a romantic prospect. I still think of Michael Caine as how he looked decades ago, so I didn't understand why it was an unrequited crush in the first place.

In any case, this is an incredibly depressing film about how a man tries to continue living even though hes lost his life companion. Use your own judgement to see if you're able to sit through it.

Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to  depressing and adult content, I wouldnt let my kids watch it.",1512086400,2,1900,4.495652173913044
