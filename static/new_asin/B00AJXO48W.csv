5444370,5,B00AJXO48W,"I LOVE this show, and don't know why. (The acting isn't subtle, the dialogue is un-realistic, it's dated in it's sexism, and it's not at all plausible that a coroner--ESPECIALLY in L.A. county; where they have tons of murder--has the leisure to run around pursuing leads.) Also, I resent them making Sam & Astin so clueless. (They're both scientists, after all.) I realize it's to offset Quincy's genius; but it just isn't believable. Not to mention also making Monahan dumb; one doesn't get to be that high-ranking, by being stupid.

Having said all that; it's just addictive. I love it when Q gets on his soapbox; which he does at least once in every episode. His character is the most interesting, because his is the most 3-dimensional. His character has the gravity you'd expect in a coroner, but infuses it with humanity that's isn't hardened by what he sees on a daily-basis. And he makes the character charming, by being witty & even sometimes sweet. My fave episodes are when try to acknowledge a social-problem. The episode about child-abuse (not in this season) was great.

The show's premise was very original, and I feel like the CSI-series was a blatant-ripoff. I will sound old for saying this; but older shows are better in that regard. RIP, Mr. Klugman",1422489600,2,1268,4.8119266055045875

5444372,5,B00AJXO48W,"Welcome to QUINCY, M.E., one of the most enjoyable and influential television shows in the history of the boob tube. This is the story of Dr. Quincy -- no first name ever given! -- a crusty, hot-tempered, do-gooding Los Angeles County medical examiner (Jack Klugman) who uses forensic science to unravel mysteries which leave his cop friends Lieutenant Monohan (Garry Walberg) and Sergeant Brill (Joe Roman), and his paper-pushing fop of a boss, Dr. Asten (John S. Ragin) scratching their respective heads. Of course when Quincy is not solving murder mysteries he is taking up a lance for every public-spirited cause you can possibly think of, from child abuse to teenage drug use to illegal immigration to punk rock music and beyond. Can't fight City Hall? Quincy treats City Hall like a rock-'em-sock-'em robot!

Of course, in so doing, he aggravates absolutely everyone, from murderers, who try to kill him, to big corporations, who try to muzzle him, to his girlfriends (he has thousands), who try to leave him, to his long-suffering assistant Sam Fujiyama (Robert Ito) and best friend Danny Tovo (Val Bisoglio) who just try to put up with him. Half the fun of QUINCY is seeing the enraged or baffled expressions of everyone who crosses his path. Imagine a fiery liberal muckraker with a medical degree and a nose (a BIG nose) for mysteries and a taste for the ladies, and you've got this show in a nutshell: and the fifth season continues where three and four left off in that the budgets were getting larger and the episodes slowly but surely getting edgier.

Some of my favorites:

""No Way To Treat A Flower"" - Quincy is shocked to discover a deadly plant poison is being mixed with marijuana with deadly results, yet the sale of the poison to smokers is completely legal.

""Hot Ice"" - Quincy in Vegas. Stolen diamonds. Secret agents. Nuff said.

""Mode of Death"" - Quincy uses the technique of ""psychological autopsy"" to solve the mysterious death of a television evangelist.

""The Money Plague"" -- Money recovered from a D.B. Cooper-like unsolved hijacking turns out to be loaded with anthrax.

""For the Benefit of my Patients"" - Quincy once again tackles the practice of ""pay before stay"" at rich hospitals, which costs poor patients their lives.

""Murder by S.O.P."" -- Quincy's big mouth lands him in a small town jail, which promptly catches fire; he ends up railroaded into taking on the case.

""Cover-Up"" -- Circumstances surrounding the death at a medical clinic are covered up by two young doctors, who must then face Quincy's wrath.

""The Winning Edge"" - The death of a female gymnast puts Quince on the trail of a coach who may be dispensing uppers to her athletes.

""New Blood"" - Quincy butts heads with a good-looking pathologist who he feels isn't experienced enough to handle the politically sensitive murder case she's working on.

""T.K.O."" - When death strikes too close to home -- meaning at Danny's -- Quincy takes up a lance against unregulated medical care facilities.

""Final Gift"" - When an old friend of Quincy's dies from arsenic poisoning after a blood transfusion, he discovers that his other old pal, who donated the blood, may be the victim of a murder plot in progress.

""Deadly Arena"" - Quince must race against time to prevent a massive epidemic of botulism from wiping out the World Cup.

I'm leaving out some winners here, but suffice to say Season 5 is another winner, perhaps a percentage point or two below Season 4 in terms of overall quality, but still excellent and a lot of fun. In fact, QUINCY was and remains a unique series in the annals of television. It was neither a medical program nor a mystery show, but combined both elements and also introduced audiences to the world of forensic pathology -- twenty years before CSI hit the airwaves. At the same time its structure was equally unique, in that two-thirds of the storylines were about causes which the producers, and Jack Klugman, felt needed a champion, or evils which needed to be exposed to the viewing public: autism, the ""code of silence"" in medicine, toxic waste dumping, plastic surgery malpractice, dangerous airline regulations, affirmative action and organ donation are all subjected to the ill-tempered Quincy treatment. It's true that by modern standards the show is sappy and heavy-handed, that the technology is laughably outdated, and so on, but it's also true that nearly every ""cause"" tackled by QUINCY has yet to be resolved today. Some shows date badly, and others remain timely while having a wonderful sense of nostalgia. QUINCY is the latter. So the next time you're in L.A., give him a ring. You may be murdered during the visit, but I guarantee he will find out who did it.",1415577600,,4704,4.833333333333333

Season Five finds Quincy investigating a death due to laced marijuana, the unholy murder of an evangelist, a suicide wrongly labeled a murder, the death of a man by an abusive family member, a drunk-driving homicide, tainted food at a football stadium that threatens to kill 90,000 spectators and more!

Death may be the end, but crime never sleeps and Quincy doesn't rest until justice has been served!
