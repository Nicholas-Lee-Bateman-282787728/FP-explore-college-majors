5274093,3,B0096PBCXY,"While not a super yuk-fest  a'la Blades Of Glory, it is a solid piece of dark, quirky comedy from a woman's point of view.  Similar to the show Girls.  Anne Heche seems to get stronger and more funny every year, when given a troubled, to-smart-for-her-own-good part like this one.",1362182400,,280,4.673469387755102
5274094,5,B0096PBCXY,"This is a raw look at womens' relationship anxieties, self worth crisis, and freakin funny situations.  It's a movie for women...not cause it's all sentimental and goodie goodie. It's a view men don't often get to see and women totally understand...Chicks uncensored, unmasked, unplugged...and hysterical. Heche is really easy on the eyes...and played the irreverent ""bad ass"" to the hilt. She showed women can be sexy without taking off their clothes.  The whole cast played their roles well and each funny and poignant in their own unique way. It was like the anti-Bridesmaids! Both funny movies but this one has more grit, depth and WAY more surprises!",1356220800,3,655,5.11214953271028
5274095,5,B0096PBCXY,The funniest movie I've ever seen in years. These women are spectacular. You never know what's going to happen next and the photography was outstanding.,1353888000,2,152,5.12
5274096,4,B0096PBCXY,Gather your girlfriends (or not).....some margaritas and your best movie foods (a must!!) and watch this when you need a laugh (or cry). I loved this movie and it's going into my rotation of favorite chick flicks...crude at times..but still very funny! :),1351296000,,255,4.953488372093023
5274097,5,B0096PBCXY,"FINALLY! A movie that shows real, messy women getting through a real, messy day together. I laughed and cringed and laughed some more, all to be completely moved by the ending. Marcia DeBonis, Anne Heche and Alia Shawkat are wonderful as the three leading ladies who weather the storm (at one point, literally) together and deliver Kellie Overbey's snappy, raunchy and hilarious dialogue perfectly while also tugging at your heart. Such a good movie and hopefully the first of many joint efforts from Kellie Overbey and Carrie Preston. See it and then go hug your friends.",1350950400,3,572,4.96875
5274098,4,B0096PBCXY,"I loved this movie and the fact that it reflects real people with real
experiences, and, in a way that allows you to laugh WITH them and
AT them. The cast does an outstanding job portraying the lives
of 3 women out in the world just trying to deal with their everyday
lives and relationships. Directed by Carrie Preston and Written by
Kellie Overbey, both talented actresses who have clearly succeeded in
creating something relatable and funny from the other side of the
camera.",1350777600,2,478,4.7023809523809526
5274099,1,B0096PBCXY,This movie was not very good. It's a shame because I do think it had potential. I think that a different cast would have made it a decent movie.,1350604800,,144,4.0

5274142,3,B0096PBCXY,"I did watch it all the way through without fast forwarding. That get's it 2 stars..since I won't waste a lot of time on garbage. It's a totally dialogue driven fit,sometimes hysterically funny and sometimes over-the-top gross. I once dated a woman who was very similar to the character played by Ann Hecht. It was like walking through a minefield assured that they had ""cleared most of them."" The characters in their women-only world are likable and unlikable by turns.  Overall it was OK,definitely seemed like a 3 person play at times.

I'm just not sure who the target audience would be.  It's barely a chick flick,certainly not a date movie. Overall I would say it's an OK film,but I'm not surprised that some viewers don't get past the initial 20 minutes. AND-I hated the sound track!",1465862400,2,789,4.744525547445256
5274143,1,B0096PBCXY,Maybe later in life. For now I couldn't pass the first 10 minutes. Too slow for me. But others seemed to give it a pretty good rating so maybe later when I have more patience.,1465689600,,175,4.0285714285714285

5274164,3,B0096PBCXY,"Not worth five stars or one star so let's go right down the middle. A very average movie that's a good way to pass 90 minutes (plane ride, exercising, etc). I have always thought Anne Heche is a fantastic undervalued actress and she's great here too. If you are a Miriam Shor fan, like  I am, don't get this for her. It's crazy that she has a credit because she is in only one scene in a line for the bathroom. No dialogue at all, very misleading.",1463270400,5,447,4.137931034482759

5274168,1,B0096PBCXY,"I love Anne Heche and she was amazing in Six Days Seven Nights and Return to Paradise however even Heche could not save a this movie from imploding!!  The opening credits were way too long with a bad song playing in the background and the only funny part was when Anne Heche was brushing her teeth while she was smoking, that was hilarious!  However, the movie went drastically downhill from there and even Heche as great as she is even in this film couldn't save such smut!  Heche's friends in this movie were rather gross and the theme was let's so who can be the most idiotic person on the face of the Earth.  Maybe it got better though because after fifteen maybe the most twenty minutes I turned it off and having it exit the screen was better than any moment in the movie!!",1373587200,4,779,4.3517241379310345
5274169,5,B0096PBCXY,"This is an over the top comedy that makes ""Sex in the City"" look like it is for sissies. There isn't much plot in this film. Dee Dee (Anne Heche) is a foul mouthed hip New Yorker who has learned to survive the city in her own unique way. Her BFF is the rather Rubenesque Bebe (Marcia DeBonis). They meet Clementine (Alia Shawkat) at a coffee shop for the first time. She has her own problems. All three women have various issues with their boyfriends, ""Tom, Dick, and Harry,"" names that fit the theme that all men are the same and A-holes.

The action and language is over the top. The dialouge is quick and witty. I had a number of favorite lines:

""Article 265 of the Penal Code""
""Not the kind with fruit""
""Mercury is in retrograde.""
""Dry humped on the restroom floor by a guy who fought in the Civil War.""
and "" Please don't fight you guys, I'm getting carpel tunnel.""

The film contains sex talk, descriptions, and heavy cursing. It is very adult theme. You can't help but love Anne Heche as a likeable street savvy bad girl in this film.

Parental Guide: Heavy use of F-bombs. Brief sex and nudity. Would make for a good HBO series.",1367193600,,1137,4.349056603773585
