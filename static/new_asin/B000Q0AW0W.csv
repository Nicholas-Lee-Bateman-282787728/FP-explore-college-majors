8193978,5,B000Q0AW0W,They all come in one case but they each have a separate box inside the case. They aren't standard boxes they are the thin ones. The quality of the movies are okay. I think it's worth the money.,1440374400,,193,4.105263157894737
8193979,4,B000Q0AW0W,"This Broly Saga is a slightly overrated Dragonball-Z storyline saga, but the fights are entertaining nonetheless, and still worth paying the money for.",1415750400,,151,5.608695652173913

8193981,5,B000Q0AW0W,I love this series a lot I have most of the seasons. I have never seen all three Broly movies only one or two but not the Bio Broly. I did not even know that they made a another movie. I can't wait to start watching them. Thanks again.,1367884800,,235,3.816326530612245

8193983,4,B000Q0AW0W,"This set is very cheap compared to some of it's other releases, however, the DVDs are set in an odd order.
Broly The Legendary Super Saiyan (Movie 8)
Bio-Broly (Movie 11)
Broly Second Coming (Movie 10)

I know which movies are which so yes, I can just move Second Coming to where Bio-Broly is and vice versa, but for those who don't know will be watching them out of order :/",1330214400,,375,4.28169014084507
8193984,5,B000Q0AW0W,A definite get if you are into the Dragon Ball Z series. I watched the show every chance i could as a kid and it's one of my favorites of all time. This set comes with all 3 of the Broly movies which are pretty good. I recommend this set.,1266883200,5,238,3.78
