8490049,4,B005ZXKR9G,"Charlie Chan in The Golden Eye, 1948 film

A man walks along the pavement. Is he being followed? Mr. Manning is afraid for his life and wants help from Charlie Chan. Mr. Wong goes for tea, a man shoots at Manning! Charlie says it came from a German gun, common after WW II. He will go to Arizona with Tommy and Birmingham Brown. There is a comic scene in packing a suitcase! Also at the Lazy-Y-Ranch in Arizona. Lt. OBrien is there, working undercover. Manning had an accident at his mine, which has suddenly become more productive. OBrien has taken fingerprints from Driscolls glass for identification. Charlie Chan says he is a dealer in jade and wants to see Manning. He meets Evelyn, Mannings daughter. Back in his room Charlie meets Mr. Bartlett, a dealer in precious metals. He is interested in the gold ore.

The next day Evelyn speaks with Talbot about the strange accidents of her father. Pete the prospector drops by to ask about the ore. Charlie will go to Petes shack at night to explore. Tommy and Birmingham follow, and provide comedy. But Pete won't talk! Upon return Charlie finds his room was searched. OBrien visits him. Then Bartlett arrives with information. At night Evelyn calls Charlie with information about her father. Sister Theresa tells about Mannings condition. Charlie sees her shoes. At night men carry heavy boxes to the mine. OBrien is there and watches. He is caught and struck down! There are shots. Charlie and his assistants arrive, they are armed. More shots are fires. The gang leader gives orders.

Charlie explains the scam: Mexican gold at $7 an ounce is smuggled into America and sold at $35 an ounce! Sister Theresa is an imposter. Charlie, Tommy, and Birmingham return to Petes shack at night and explore the mine tunnels. Birmingham finds a bandaged man in a tunnel. But is soon disappears! Charlie goes to get Lt. Mike and they go to the ranch. Charlie discovers another imposter! A shot brings Lt. OBrien, Tommy, and Birmingham into the house. The Mexican police grabbed the gold shipment. Driscoll returns but escapes from the house. Bartlett shoots him to prevent his escape. Then Charlie solves the mystery and explains the motives. Aint that something!

This is an interesting mystery. Part of the story is set in a dude ranch, a popular resort of that era. It is mostly a mystery but with some comic scenes as in earlier movies. Did you suspect the ringleader? Wasnt there a clue in the assay of Petes ore? The presence of an official detective in a novel feature. Note the familiarity with firearms then.",1487116800,,2558,4.754504504504505
8490050,5,B005ZXKR9G,"This was one that I had never seen before and I enjoyed it very much.  I have all of the Charlie Chan movies that have been released, there are still some more that haven't been released yet so I hope they will release them soon so we can enjoy them to.  It you are a Charlie Chan fan then this is a good addition to add to your collection.",1377388800,,340,3.9130434782608696
8490051,3,B005ZXKR9G,"Many years ago, I bought almost the entire Charlie Chan series on VHS from someone.  As the DVD sets came out, I traded my VHS for DVD.  For whatever reason, their are a handful that have not come out on DVD,  This is one of them.  The DVD sets I had purchased were much better than my VHS copies.  However, this DVD appears to me to be a dubbed copy from VHS.  The quality was the same as my VHS copy.  I could have dubbed it myself.  I love the Charlie Chan movies and have watched many several times over the years.",1364515200,2,518,4.009803921568627
8490052,5,B005ZXKR9G,"I love vintage detective mysteries and have all the available Chan films from Oland and Toler, two Roland Winters films and even that horrible Peter Ustinov effort.  I'd never heard of a TV series other than the cartoon version, yet I bought the J Carrol Nash 50s series on a whim, and but for the 30 min series limits, I enjoyed the entire package.  James Hong plays Chan's #1 son, this time named ""Berry"" for some reason.
I've viewed this series twice already and wish the series had been given a second season.  And while I eagerly await the remainder of the Roland Winters films as well as the earlier Oland pictures not found in any boxed sets, and - from what I understand - the remaining unreleased Tolan films as well as Basil Rathbone's pre-Holmes Philo Vance and Wm Powell's 1st Vance pic, ""The Canary Murder Case,"" I am very happy with Nash's efforts to bring Chan to the small screen and would recommend this set to true Chan fans.",1358380800,,943,4.502923976608187
8490053,4,B005ZXKR9G,"Although I like Sidney Toler as the best Charley Chan, Roland Winters did a creditable job.  The plot in The Golden Eye movie was much better than a lot of the previous Chan movies.  I wouls recommned it for Chan affectionatos.",1355443200,,227,4.512195121951219
8490054,3,B005ZXKR9G,"This is a very good,classic Chan movie with Mantan Moreland stealing a lot of scenes.  My only disappontment was that I already have the story in a now very scratchy vhs as ""Meeting at Midnight"" and thought ""Black Magic"" was a newly discovered story.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Charlie-Chan-Chanthology-The-Secret-Service-The-Chinese-Cat-The-Jade-Mask-Black-Magic-The-Scarlet-Clue-The-Shanghai-Cobra/dp/7885727343/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Charlie Chan Chanthology (The Secret Service / The Chinese Cat / The Jade Mask / Black Magic / The Scarlet Clue / The Shanghai Cobra)</a>",1351728000,,628,7.722222222222222
8490055,1,B005ZXKR9G,"One of WORST movies (productions) I've ever seen.  Plot okay re gold mine, but scenes so dark, most of them, that can't tell what is going on.  For that price, DO NOT BUY.  I would not buy even for my collection if $1.00 - it is recorded that BADLY.  I have asked for refund.  ALso, NEED TRACKING on all your products, Quick N Easy -- not good to not track, as if someone doesn't get, YOUR loss. NOT GOOD SALESMANSHIP or policy to not track.  Will never order from you people again if I don't get satisfaction for my return of S&H & Label and full cost of movie o movies.  Not my error.  You need new master to record from--this is VERY POOR.

8490056,3,B005ZXKR9G,I am a CC fan and have all the movies that I could find and enjoy them as I remembered them from my childhood. The TV series is not of the quality I would wish for and the sound is poor. I have viewed other TV series of this era and the quality is usually disappointing also. I guess I am used to the Movie actors version of CC and J carol Nash isn't as good in my opinion. There are alot of episodes and it will take time to go through them. I am happy that I purchased the set.,1345939200,2,479,3.7524752475247523
8490057,3,B005ZXKR9G,"Of the half dozen Charlie Chan flicks featuring Roland Winters as Chan, ""The Chinese Ring"" is the only one to receive a legitimate release (on the TCM collection). ""The Golden Eye"" and the rest of the Roland Winters efforts are on a par with the mid-40's Sydney Toler releases, and feature the same supporting casts (Mantan Moreland, Keye Luke, Victor Sen Young). Winters was only 44 when he made his first Chan movie in 1947, making him slightly YOUNGER than Keye Luke.

These Roland Winters Chan movies are fairly well written and the stories are entertaining. As a ""Chan Fan"", I would not hesitate to purchase these in a reasonably priced boxed set. Note: the 3 stars are for the movie itself, not the blurry transfer being sold on Amazon as of this writing.",1330819200,17,761,4.67910447761194
8490058,2,B005ZXKR9G,"I am also a collector of all the Charlie Chan movies and have waited a long time for the Roland Winters series to be released - This is indeed a rare issue and it is mostly easy to watch and the sound is good - Roland Winters does a good job as Charlie but it is Mantan Moreland that, (as usual), steals the show - I hope that TCM will listen to the public (doubtful) and release the final Chan films as they might be very surprised at the public response -",1327622400,25,457,3.9782608695652173
