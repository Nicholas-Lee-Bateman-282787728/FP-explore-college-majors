1657151,5,B00005RRJN,"Just wanted the DVD version, all I had previous was VCR.  Great little campy black comedy if you are into artsy films with a touch of uncomfortable archetypes and brightly colored satire..  Blends ""waters"" style with in your face cinematic comment on banal self worship, greed, sexual predation on young girls, nave courage and even self hatred. Most will see it as stupid little low budget smart ass flick trying to poke fun at everything establishment, but it really has it's roots in something a bit more developed.",1414454400,,518,4.875

Mike Patton is in it, though!

1657154,4,B00005RRJN,"For fans of teen movies. Really fun to watch, a little odd though but not too many Troma films are normal. My only big problem was the fact that what could have been a side story took over and become the main store. overall I liked it a lot.",1297468800,2,241,3.938775510204082
1657155,5,B00005RRJN,"I absolutely love this movie.  What a hidden gem!  Fans of John Waters and other oddball fair will enjoy this. The lines are cheesy fun and of course the ""teenagers"" look like they're in their 20's.  It's really hard to explain the plot other than the school ""bully"" is not nominated to run for Prom Queen so she starts killing off the ones who are.  But along with that storyline is the ""my parents/adults don't understand me"" plot. If you love over-the-top, poorly acted and ridiulously funny B-movies, you will not be disappointed.",1274313600,3,534,4.709677419354839
1657156,5,B00005RRJN,"Absolutely love it!!!!! The main character, Cherry is so much fun to watch. She is such a psychopath! Upon finding out that she is not a prom queen nominee, she decides to start knocking off the potential prom queens. Meanwhile, 3 other students have kidnapped their abusive and corrupt school principal. The story line & characters in this movie are kind of out there, but if you're into B-films it may be worth your while. Personally I had a good time watching this and I had a good laugh.",1180051200,8,491,4.52808988764045
1657157,5,B00005RRJN,"Amazingly clever and cutting edge cinematography, captivating  storyline and an adorably cute cast make this one a B-film Must Have!
 I loved this movie! And I loved Cherry, the evil goddess of prom night even more (Played by Brooke Balderson). A very talented actress that has alot of potential.
  If you watch this film without taking everything too seriously then you will have more than a laugh or two and at least you will see all the sights of Wamego, a beautiful little town in the heartlands.",1068249600,,500,4.712643678160919
1657158,5,B00005RRJN,"I wanted to see this movie because it was a horror film and it looked different. What I discovered was one of those worlds like ""But I'm a Cheerleader,"" where everything is symbolic and stereotyped. I was intrigued by every part of this movie. If you like the counterculture and a movie that spits in the face of conformity, this is a great movie for you. The R rating is for violence, nudity, language and sexual content.",1023235200,4,422,4.4935064935064934
1657159,4,B00005RRJN,"...reads the tagline for ""Pep Sqaud,"" an amiably campy film, in the tradition of John Waters or Roger Corman.  The film--surprisngly rich in color and sound--follows three high school kids who hide their principal in their basement after he tries to rape one of the three.  Despite a plot-line that sounds terribly familiar and a cast of unbelievably awful actors, ""Pep Squad"" thrives in other departments.  For one, the music and score of the film, performed by Concrete Blonde frontwoman Johnette Napolitano, is excellent.  Secondly, the actresses playing the roles of Cherry, a psychotic sociopath determined to become prom queen, and Terra, the retro-snob on top of Cherry's hit list, blow the other actors away.  The conflicts between the two girls is reason enough to forget about the crummy acting coming from some of the other stars of the film.  As far as wannabe-cult-classics, ""Pep Squad"" squashes the competition.",1004572800,2,925,5.174496644295302

7952626,5,B00005RRJN,"Great film, I love the low budget feel of the film. Reminds me of the times when Hollywood did need big budgets to make quality films. This film is at best one of Thomas Gems.
The DVD cane new in a white & hot pink case, the only downside is the quality of picture looks mildly pixelated. Other then that no complaints.",1478131200,,319,4.161290322580645

7952629,1,B00005RRJN,"Better than most student films, but not much.

I didn't find any of the characters appealing or even interesting.  None have _star power_ at all.

Found myself flossing instead of watching this movie. Yes, it was that boring.
Goes into my ""never again"" list.",1464134400,,258,4.818181818181818
