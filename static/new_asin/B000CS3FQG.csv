Save your money, save your time.

The movie is just boring. It seems the director had only one thing in mind. No, not that -- cigarettes. Every minute someone in the movie has to hold a cigarette in the middle of the screen. I found this just disgusting.

We know that Hollywood has advertised cigarettes for decades, and is responsible for the suffering and death of millions of people. Now, this is hopefully history, is it? But it seems that Bollywood has to jump in and support the cigarette market in India.",1234224000,,542,4.520408163265306
