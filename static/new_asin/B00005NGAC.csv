7947212,1,B00005NGAC,"While Domingo certainly knows this opera, he could no possibly know what he was getting involved in.
The producers present an unbalanced and distorted view of the themes of Parsifal, especially Redemption through Compassion, by obsessing over Hitler's response to Wagner's works. No one here bothers to mention that the Nazis BANNED Parsifal from all German opera houses, including Bayreuth, in 1939 because they couldn't reconcile its message with their own. But there is an awful lot of blather about purity and blood which I dare you to show me in the opera's text. I've translated every word myself, including the stage directions. Even if you can't read German, there are plenty of good translations available, and a few good books, too, about this opera. Read something, and leave VHS taped garbage like this to the landfills.",1249948800,15,832,5.08029197080292
7947213,5,B00005NGAC,"I first saw this on PBS/KCET channel 28 and was pleased to know it is available on DVD. Tenor Placido Domingo has labored for the cause of opera more than any other tenor, with continual involvement in the arts (including conducting orchestral music) and speaking on behalf of opera. This documentary appeals to opera lovers and intellectuals. Domingo narrates the life and work of Richard Wagner, whose Parsifal was the final masterpiece he left the world with. It was staged in Bayreuth and immediately taken over by his imperious wife Cosima Wagner. The opera is suffused with Christian mysticism and allegory, and tells the story of Parsifal whose name means ""innocent fool"" who innocently embarks on a major spiritual quest. In Arthurian/Medieval Spain, the wounded king Amfortas seeks healing from a hero who must return the Spear of Destiny stolen by the evil wizard Klingsor. Klingsor has a strong claim over the ambiguous character of Kundry (is she saint or witch ?) who during the day serves the old King and who communes with the evil Klingosr in his castle at night. Parsifal takes on the mission of returning the Spear to its rightful owner. The ending of the opera is a magnificent apotheosis that finds Kunddry redeemed by love and Parsifal attaining spiritual enlightenment, finally saving the land and its King. Excerpts from the opera are performed (by Domingo in fine shape). Also, we look at Richard Wagner (played by Richard Burton) as he composes the final masterpiece. Further, the philosophical aspects of the opera are discussed. And there are many. The Hero's Quest (the much loved theme of Joseph Campbell's teachings), redemption through compassion and love, Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism and yes, even Nazism. Unfortunately, Adolph Hitler twisted this sublime piece into a dark, Aryan Supremacist propaganda piece. Hitler loved Wagner only because he related to Wagner's zealous German nationalism, in the same way that he appreciated Nietzche's Super-Man mentality. These things are discussed in the documentary. Filmed in Spain (where the opera takes place) and other parts of Europe, this is really a fine DVD. I don't understand why people have found it disappointing.",1123286400,4,2208,5.187675070028011
7947214,2,B00005NGAC,"I rented this thinking I would be viewing the opera and that was a big disappointment.  I did learn a little about how the Grail figures in religious history, which was interesting, but a lot of the commentary by both Placido Domingo, of whom I am a big fan, and also by a few other completely unbalanced people, were a bit ridiculous.  Domingo seemed to be saying that the opera could bring world peace and another commentator seemed to think the opera alone was entirely responsible for the holocaust.  All a bit simplistic thinking, really.",1107388800,4,543,4.6947368421052635
7947215,5,B00005NGAC,"enchanting and inspiring narration by Domingo and perspective introduction by Wolfgang Wagner. Also the only documentary avaiable on Parsifal, the theme and its opera. I love this DVD, only if it is with Chinese subtitles.",1068854400,2,222,5.371428571428571
7947216,1,B00005NGAC,"As others have noted, this is not a complete performance. In fact, the scenes from what appear to be an excellent Kirov performance are all too brief. What predominates this otherwise waste of 90 min is a self-serving attempt at commentary by some ""experts"" (who are not) who lack any understanding of the work or even of Wagner. If you want to get to know PARSIFAL, arguably Wagner's masterpiece, leave this alone as there are several books, such as the ENO guide, that do a far better job. If the complete Kirov performance ever does become available, that can be recommended. This cannot.",1068768000,7,591,4.747572815533981
7947217,2,B00005NGAC,"This video is not a complete recording of the Opera Parsifal but it offers description of the story of this opera narrated by Placido Domingo plus  introductions to the back ground of the opera, philosophy of the opera and  even the humanity implication of the opera as well as the composer's  biography. A lot of film clips were edited into video string of this tape  and it is nice to have scenes from various films though I do not necessary  agree with the points of view offered. If you are not crazy about Wagnerian  operas but you would like to own some kind of recording of Parsifal and  this is one you ought to have because it's got all the excerpts of the  highlights of the opera. If  you are a hot fan of Parsifal and you already  own a complete recording of this opera then it wouldn't hurt to own this  recording on the side for story telling and interest of the Holy Grail  Myth.
Vocally, Domingo was in great voice but lack of the youthfulness of  Jerusalem of the Philips Bayreuther recording. Kundry sung by Violeta  Urmana who acted well and whose top voice was very focused and brilliant  compared to the the Kundry sung by Eva Randova of the Bayreuther recording  who was sort of a mezzo-soprano pushing her middle voice up to sing the  top. (A lot of mezzo-soprano sings in that manner and once they found their  tops, they usually will sing dramatic sopranos instead.) However  Bayreuther's Kundry was more appealing since the opera describes Kundry as  the fairest of all of the Flower Maidens in the opera. klingsor sung by  Nikolai Putilin sounded good but look like a monster rather than a  devil.
The swimming sexy girls were ok to imply fantasy of the Magic  Garden.",965952000,17,1695,4.539735099337748
7947218,1,B00005NGAC,"Although there are some good scenes of the Kirov production, I was disappointed with this video. It is not a good introduction, and anyone who knows anything about Parsifal will wince frequently. The video includes far  too many extracts from other movies, especially Palmer's 'Wagner'. Palmer  mixes in music from 'The Ring' which might confuse someone new to the  topic. Domingo looks simply awful as Parsifal. There are a couple of scenes  with nude swimmers, which appear completely out of place with the style of  the Kirov production, and also are totally uninteresting as pornography. It  made me realise how good Syberberg's Parsifal is.",955670400,17,645,5.153846153846154
