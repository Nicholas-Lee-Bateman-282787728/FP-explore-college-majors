8155249,3,B00011HJ8Y,"I bought this video because I'm a Choy Lay Fut practioner and I used to train with Sifu Vince Lacey (Shane's dad).  I thought it would be cool to see what kind of video they'd produced and that having the Buk Sing forms on DVD would be a useful refresher.  Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't deliver what it promises.  While it claims to teach several forms, it in fact only teaches 1, the siu ping kuen (small level hand) - nice form, but not worth $30.  He does go through all the basic stances and strikes, but this is only interesting if you have no CLF background or are just curious about the differences betwen Buk Sing and your own branch.  I don't know if my DVD was defective or not, but the sound is HORRIBLE and goes from garbled (on a clean DVD) to normal to broken.  The transitions are repetitive, and special effects are used in an almost random manner.  If you've seen some of Doc Fai Wong's ALC videos, you'll recognize the style.

Now, all that said, the instruction is excellent.  Shane's demonstration is flawless and shows the form at regular speed, slow motion, and walk through.  The technical breakdown is very clear, with level 1 applications for pretty much everything.  Watching this section is really fun since he makes fairly hard contact with many of his strikes and you can see the pain on his partner's face.  On the whole that's why I give three stars rather than two.",1113696000,2,1398,4.503968253968254
