4842086,3,B005N1TKQQ,Download quality somewhat better.  Film of much better quality that any of the Iron Boys series.  At one point in the film. . .the download froze and remained that way for over a minute before it began playing again.  Still greatly disappointed by the downloading.,1358553600,,264,4.822222222222222
4842087,5,B005N1TKQQ,"Closeted movie star Brian Brecht comes to Miami on a publicity tour and his agent hires an actress to pose as his girlfriend, a role she takes a bit too seriously.  Brian actually has eyes only for David, the hunky bartender at his hotel, which is quickly noticed by a sleazy paparazzi who is looking to get proof to ""out"" the actor.  Meanwhile, a local art dealer being assaulted by her ex is rescued by a private detective with a secret agenda, and a homophobic television evangelist conspires to force his gay son to agree to reparative therapy.

The viewer soon finds that these three seemingly-unrelated stories have lots of players in common, and are all somewhat similar, in that they show how far someone is willing to go to keep what they have, even if it means risking the losS of everything. Director and co-screenwriter Kim St. Leon is impressive in her first feature release, crafting a low budget film that feels very much like an older, dark suspense thriller.  The cast is mostly unknowns but do a good job, with Mark Whittington (as Brian), Leif Holt (as Christian, the son of the televangelist), and a scene-stealing turn by character actress Avery Sommers, who plays a crime boss.  The ending was a little uneven, I thought, but this was otherwise an outstanding effort.  Five stars out of five.",1325030400,12,1314,4.716157205240175

""Lost Everything"" is a real loser. The editing is obvious and clunky, the plot, beyond the outing of the Hollywood teen heartthrob, is convoluted and preposterous, and the acting is generally amateurish.

4842128,5,B005N1TKQQ,"I love indie film.  This is a terrific sexual bending film that combines all the tension of a murder mystery with hot tension of Miami & Hollywood.  If you love those 90's Indie flix where the gritty plotlines weaved in and out with great acting and direction this is a terrific film.  Takes a while to get going, but that is because it was a little before it's time.  Now with things like SENSE 8 & TRUE DETECTIVE this film is doing what those productions did way ahead of the times.  Strong performancest, beautiful images, stylized writing and unforeseen plot twists that don't punch you in the head with a ""message"".  So glad I had insomnia and watched this on a whim.  I stayed up all night watching it to the end.  If it was a book, it would be called a ""page turner"".  Watch it!  You will be pleasantly surprised.",1439078400,,820,4.370860927152318

4842157,2,B005N1TKQQ,"Lost Everything is the story of a closeted thirtysomething movie star and his overbearing, Mommie-Dearest manager; a journalist intent on outing him; a bartender who becomes the love of his life; some gangsters led by a ruthless black Godmama; an insane televangelist; two straight women; and assorted gay men - all in Miami. They're involved more or less with each other in what I suppose is meant to be either a thriller or an object lesson on the dangers of the closet.

The whole thing is so preposterous, though, that it's hard to take it as seriously as it clearly wants to be taken. It might have worked as a campy farce, but that's not how it was played. It seems from the interviews on the DVD that the people involved in making Lost Everything were deeply committed to it; the problem is that none of them had enough talent to make it work. The story, dialog and direction are ludicrous. The only credible performance is by Leif Holt as Christian (the televangelist's gay son), but unfortunately it's a very small role.

Kim St Leon, the director and co-writer, comes across as a really nice person, so I wish I could have liked her movie, but I just don't. The first ten minutes were SO bad that I almost gave up, but I forced myself to finish it and even to watch the fairly extensive interviews on the DVD (the DVD says it includes a short called The Attachment, but it doesn't). It got a lot better the instant Holt appeared, and every time he was on screen the movie suddenly got interesting, but he wasn't on enough to redeem the rest of it. I'll look for other movies he's done, but he's all that makes this one worth watching.",1371340800,4,1644,4.476666666666667

The acting is decent, though in mainstream Hollywood's hands we would have been given some more interesting and adept people in the supporting roles and a much higher quality deployment of the gun shooting scenes.  I enjoyed how all the characters were tied together and there is something satisfying about the sense of justice imparted.  In my fantasy world, top notch big budget producer, director, and players take on the exact same script and we compare it's worth to what we have now.
