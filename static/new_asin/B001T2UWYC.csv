8340489,5,B001T2UWYC,"A fantastic collection of video game music, beautifully played by the Czech Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra
My personal favorite is the Commodore 64 medley, which contains music from International Karate, The Great Giana Sisters, The Last Ninja, Wizball, Forbidden Forest, and Zoids.",1401321600,,282,5.902439024390244
8340490,5,B001T2UWYC,Downloaded the mp3 versions and love it. The music is great and very enjoyable. No data quality issues with the mp3s.,1392854400,,117,4.619047619047619
8340491,5,B001T2UWYC,"I am disappointed to see those two or three one-star ratings drag the overall rating of this album down, especially since those reviews were based none at all on the actual soundtrack. If you do not have the product, do not rate the product.

Now, to the product, which I do own, and which I have listened to dozens and dozens of times. As a college student and a gamer, this album is one of my favorites. Now you may ask, ""why would a college student enjoy this music?"" This album as a whole is amazingly relaxing, as well as spot-on with some of my favorite gaming music of all time. That being said, in those long nights of studying, this album always accompanies me.

I have nothing bad to say about this album at all, besides the one guy that coughs really loud in the audience during the Oblivion theme. Shut up, man. This thing is being recorded.",1367193600,,853,4.3584905660377355
8340492,4,B001T2UWYC,"I didn't really know what to expect with this album, but eh, it works.  There are a few songs I really like and it was cheaper to purchase the whole album than just a few songs.",1350950400,,177,3.9166666666666665
8340493,5,B001T2UWYC,"This CD is one of the best orchestral collections of music from popular video games available.  Most of the songs are pretty long, and very well done, and some of them are even performed with a new spin on the original.  For example, the Silent Hill track is ""Theme of Laura"" from Silent Hill 2.  While the original is much more acoustic, the Czech Philharmonic uses a mixture of electric instruments and horns to give the song a completely new sound.  If you are a fan of Orchestral Music, Video Games, or the ""Video Games Live"" collections, this is a must buy.",1343520000,,562,4.480392156862745
8340494,5,B001T2UWYC,"Finally video game theme music is being seriously considered as worthy of Great Halls and song. To quote Peregrin Took (Pippin) in Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, when asked by Lord Denethor if he could sing, his reply was ""Yes,"" said Pippin. ""Well, yes, well enough for my own people. But we have no songs fit for great halls and evil times, lord..."" After that, Denethor ordered him to sing him a song, to ease his troubled mind. ""A Walking Song"" made its White Tower debut. This music may not be Handel or Chopin, but it stirs in us emotional sympathetic vibes nonetheless. The back stories and haunting melodies behind today's video games are complex, diverse and deeply moving. Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion (track 11) is my favorite. Check out the recently released video game homage by London Symphony Orchestra as well. Wonderfully performed.",1329004800,,858,4.804054054054054
8340496,5,B001T2UWYC,"I have steadily followed the PLAY symphony as it has trekked the globe, and they performances never fail to disappoint. A great mix of tunes from a variety of today's games, if you have any affinity for the music of video games then this is a must-buy, must-see offering.",1322006400,4,271,4.551020408163265
8340497,5,B001T2UWYC,"The person below me who gave this CD one-star is a blockhead. He didn't even rate the music itself, he just complained about a marketing strategy he disliked (and was wrong about to begin with), and I'm upset that now the rating on the CD will forever have a one on it, lowering its average.

Anyway.

The music on the CD is great, Play! has really gone above and beyond. I actually have only played 5 of the video games that Play! has made a song about on this CD, and let me tell you, they made the songs better. Not that anything was wrong with them to begin with, but hearing what was already a great song list backed up by the thunder and power of a full orchestra is so amazing. Hearing the Sonic the Hedgehog soundtrack brought back a flood of memories for me; they made songs for many of the levels in Sonic the Hedgehog 1, and even the boss fights.

That was just one example, the other songs are awesome as well. Kingdom Hearts Live blew me away. I adored the game's soundtrack already, but a new layer of beauty was created when Play! took a spin at it. For the Video Game Music fans out there, and fans of orchestras, I can't recommend buying this CD enough. Support the people who took the time to turn something from great to spectacular.",1316131200,9,1252,4.274261603375527
8340498,1,B001T2UWYC,This product page is what will be shown when the countdown for the Battlefield 3 beta ends today at 5pm. I find it strange that this product will be advertised when a countdown for the Battlefield 3 beta ends. I think that someone is trying to get some easy pr for this product because so many people are now going to [...] to await the Battlefield 3 beta. Just thought it was relevant to post information about the way this product is being promoted.,1315958400,5,451,4.380952380952381
