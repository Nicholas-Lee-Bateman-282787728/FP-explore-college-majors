7562638,2,B01948X3CK,"As a Dutch Canadian I am disappointed that this Blu-ray disc was advertised as being able to work on both region A and B Blu-ray players. Unfortunately it does not work on my Blu-ray player even after I troubleshoot my player and tried changing the settings to make it work. I know that this is a fantastic movie for the Naval history fan and every Dutchman like myself, but now I must wait till at least April to get the right format for North American Blu-Ray devices. Really disappointed as I have been patiently waiting for a year for this movie to come to north America.",1454889600,4,575,4.433962264150943

7562652,5,B01948X3CK,"An amazing historical drama. The action sequences on the ships were great. The CGIs of the fleets were the only mildly weak parts of an otherwise outstanding film.  A bit gory in places in the civil war part of it.  If you're interested in Charles II's reign, this is worth a look. Props to Charles Dance for his performance. The Dutch cast, and the final action sequence were wonderful. Enjoy!",1468368000,,394,4.614285714285714
7562653,4,B01948X3CK,"Oh my gosh! What a great movie! As a Scots descendant, I have a natural dysaffinity for the English. This historical piece made me Dutch for 2 hours.... If you like 3-master-sailing ships, frigates and man-of-wars battles at sea, and republican democracies over-coming the monarchy then ""Admiral"" is for you. Lammer, Dance, and all the rest of the cast give brilliant and powerful performances. The only, slight, downside for this swash-buckling flick is that most of it is spoken in Dutch (lots of reading, while missing the scenery). Take sail and take a look...",1467504000,,564,5.01063829787234

It is subtitled in English if you get the correct version, but the subtitles are well-done, easy to read, and hardly interfere with English-only speakers' enjoyment of the film.  Don't let those subtitles you from this wonderful experience.",1467331200,,389,5.655172413793103

7562658,1,B01948X3CK,"Listed as PG but contains frontal nudity. Love the movie and thought I would buy this PG version in order to watch it with my son. I figure with it being PG, it would not include the few frontal nudity scenes and perhaps some of the more gruesome torture scenes, but this appeared to be the full movie, with nothing cut out. I had this movie on Netflix already, so I just wasted $10.",1466726400,,383,4.1891891891891895

7562660,3,B01948X3CK,"I love the idea of this film and the visuals are often spectacular , it's great to see the battles and wide shots of fleets at sea but the CGI kinda takes you out of it , also the subtitles and really the accents and acting also could have been better in my opinion , Master and Commander and Tony Hopkins in Mutiny on the bounty still 2 of my favorite films and still the best ocean adventure films ever made in my opinion .",1466553600,,425,4.011764705882353
7562661,5,B01948X3CK,"Outstanding movie about the Dutch Republic and their wars with England and others.  The focus is on Michael de Ruyter, the great Dutch naval hero and perhaps the greatest admiral of the 17th century.  The cinematography, costumes and acting are great.  The sea battles are realistic if somewhat graphic.  I am not an expert on the history of the Netherlands and their wars with England but I have read several books on the subjects. So far as I can tell the movie is reasonably historically accurate as well as entertaining.

I streamed this movie via Amazon Prime so can not comment on any dvd's.",1466467200,,597,4.701923076923077

7562666,3,B01948X3CK,"I enjoyed this film primarily as a chance to see Dutch history presented by Dutch film makers to a Dutch audience.  Poor Admiral Michiel de Ruyter comes out as a brave sailor, dedicated to his nation who is shamelessly used by politicians for their own ends.  Ruyter is still ranked among history's great admirals and great Dutch heroes.  His story moves us even after half a millennium.
  Even with sub-titles the acting comes across as competent.  The sets and costumes are super.  The sea battles are about what we might expect on a made for TV movie.  It was fun seeing Charles Dance (Game of Thrones) in a different role.",1465084800,,626,4.627272727272727
7562667,5,B01948X3CK,"Fantastic History film. Plenty of research of the era went into the making of this film--the sets the costumes, all the things going on in the background of shots. Really thought this was a great film and would compare it to Master and Commander. If you like the old sailing ships or costume Dramas this is for you. I normally never buy a DVD. Once I watch a movie, I rarely watch it again, but in this case I will make an exception if I can find a copy.",1464652800,,454,4.112359550561798
7562668,4,B01948X3CK,Historically depressing. I always thought William III of Orange as a good guy that went on to greater things.  He had inherited wealth and saved Amsterdam from the French by opening the dykes.  Here he is in indecisive wimp.  At least they mentioned he ended the Stuarts rule in England with the invasion of 1668 ending the last of the Anglo Dutch wars started in Cromwell's rule.,1464566400,,380,4.641791044776119
7562669,5,B01948X3CK,"This is not a movie for the weak.  It is brutal, barbaric at times and downright scary (in the view of mob mentality and violence).

The Admiral, de Ruyter, is the Admiral of the Fleet of the states of The Netherlands.  1700s military, naval specific, strategy is the word of the day.  Taking on the English and while his own country is in a state of turmoil, Mechiel de Ruyter leads his navy to victory.

In Dutch, French (with subtitles) and English, this movie to leave any historian satisfied.",1464480000,,497,4.53932584269663
7562670,5,B01948X3CK,A terrifically entertaining movie!  Full of drama and cold blooded politics!  And the battle scenes with the sailing ships are truly awesome (often seen from above for a great view) and the best I have ever seen!  If you are a naval history buff you must see this amazing story!,1464220800,,278,4.52
7562671,5,B01948X3CK,Wonderful!,1464134400,,10,10.0
7562672,1,B01948X3CK,"Note: This film's original title was ""Michiel de Ruyter,"" a reference to its hero, the great Dutch admiral of that name.

It *could* have been as good as many of the gushy reviews indicate, but at the core this is nothing more than sick poplib hate propaganda published 400 years after the fact.  The costumes and settings are great and the acting is solid, but that's not nearly enough to make up for the seedy undercurrent that permeates the work.

With an obvious attitude of Truth Be Damned, this hate piece relentlessly portrays the Republicans (17th century Dutch Republicans, not the American political party*) as the wide-eyed, innocent victims of conniving monarchists, and the Dutch fleet as the wide-eyed, innocent victims of the evil English and French and Everybody Else In The World, all of whom are beating up on the poor, innocent Dutch because they're all so jealous of the wealth of the Dutch merchants.  (The film studiously ignores the fact that the Dutch merchants who are getting rich in this era from the African slave trade which they introduced to the New World.)  It portrays William of Orange as an effeminate fop who desperately grabs for some bit of spine when he refuses to assist his cousin, the king of England, making The Netherlands an English province.

Historical fact in this film ends with the results of the first few naval battles that Michiel de Ruyter participated in.  All the rest, including the portrayal of all characters in the film, are bizarre fantasies.  The film also dwells relentlessly on bloody grue to the point that it ought to be classified as a splatter flick, along with little doses of unimaginative gratuitous nudity.

Footnote: The William, Prince of Orange, in this film is not the same fellow as the Prince of Orange mentioned in ""Het Wilhelmus,"" the national anthem of the Kingdom of The Netherlands.  Look up William the Silent for the man who freed The Netherlands from Spanish rule.

*We might have some fun with the concept of Republicans being viciously persecuted by aristocratic propaganda-wielding, rabble-rousing totalitarians attempting to establish their own monarchy in a republic in the early 21st century, but that's a whole different subject.  No one has made that movie yet.",1463875200,,2255,4.968085106382978
7562673,5,B01948X3CK,"An exceptional historical film that is much more than a war movie.  I really enjoyed the exposure that this film gave me to the De Witt brothers, Prince William of Orange and De Ruyter.  I was intrigued by the story so much that I went on-line and learned that Williams went on to invade England and with his wife, Mary Stuart, ruled England and Scotland.  Horrendously tragic fate for the De Witt brothers who had done so much for the Dutch Republic.  Amazing period of European history with men and women who rose to the occasion and became genuine heroes worthy to be honored for all time.

If I have any complaint it is only that the modern viewer seems to expect explosions, whereas the cannons were shooting solid shot and chain shot at each other.  Now they did of course cause vicious injury due to splintered wood fragments as they crashed into the hulls of the ships, but there was too much ""sawdust"" and explosion in the film.  Otherwise an awesome movie well worth owning.",1463875200,,984,4.556818181818182
7562674,5,B01948X3CK,"Oh this was so f'ing good, watched it three times in the row, the scenes were so well done, best movies I've seen in a long time. It is on Netflix now, so you can save some money if you are member.",1463616000,,197,3.7142857142857144
7562675,5,B01948X3CK,"Awesome Naval movie! Great naval battles the movie transports you to the past and makes you feel like your really there, (No need for a time machine). The movie is about the Dutch Admiral Michiel de Ruyter who is the Dutch national hero. It revolves about how he became the Admiral and the politics of the time. The recreation is flawless and the costumes are perfect. If you love wooden ship naval battles you will not be disappointed in this movie it is one of the best naval battles you will ever see.",1462838400,3,504,4.43010752688172
7562676,5,B01948X3CK,My wife and I watched this just last night.  Wow.  This seemed to me to be remarkably accurate historically.  The acting was superb.  This covered (SO well!) a time period sadly neglected in histories - most likely because of English defeats.  The portrayals of historical characters was excellent.  The presentation of naval operational strategy and tactical manoeuvre was clear and really quite brilliant.  I came away from this w/ a far greater understanding of this (Dutch) viewpoint and of this period in NW European history.,1462665600,3,530,5.1647058823529415
7562677,5,B01948X3CK,Incredible movie. I wasn't expecting it to be this good. I love the photography and the story. Very entertaining. Great action scenes.,1461715200,,134,5.136363636363637
7562678,5,B01948X3CK,"A first-rate history lesson. I'm a sailing ship nut, and I think this the best sailing ship movie I've seen. The photography and special effects are spectacular. It's as though you were looking at a gallery full of Rembrandt and Van de Velde paintings. Ok, ship buffs will spot some goofs and anachronisms. But this surely is the most successful attempt ever to depict naval battles on the big screen.

One small quibble: there's no English-dubbed soundtrack. The movie itself has decent English subtitles, but the extra features don't.

Anybody who's interested in ships, or Dutch history, will love this movie. And even the people who couldn't care less about the subject matter will get caught up in the spectacle.",1461542400,6,717,4.966666666666667

7562681,3,B01948X3CK,"Well acted and photographed, I think that the movie still fails to engage the American viewer on several levels. You need to have a good knowledge of Dutch history and even better knowledge of the Dutch naval battles of the seventeenth century. The action pieces on board the sailing vessels are well done but the CGI effects really fail to convince the viewer and explain the naval tactics involved. The subtitles were not an issue for me and the English actors do speak English. Worth viewing if only because it will make you want to learn more about the Dutch and their trading and political history.",1461283200,,603,4.69811320754717

7562684,5,B01948X3CK,"Epic based a little known part of European history - from the American perspective at least. I would give the movie a heavy 4.5 stars, so going with 5. Well cast and the respectful approach to a critical period in European history was welcomed. Lammers is not the typical protagonist for American viewers, but I think you will find he more than fits the role. Highly recommend this movie.",1460073600,2,388,4.63768115942029

7562686,4,B01948X3CK,"Well worth your time to watch. Simply the movie portrays one with duty to his country first and foremost but in the final act the Country betrays that individual. The visual aspects of the movie are great. The acting is great  but the story-line is even greater. It is God, Country, and Family.  You see how  fear can make people brutal and that mob mentality is the worst action of humanity.  It shows you that what people believe is much stronger than the truth.  In the end you will feel as though you have been betrayed both as an individual and community.",1459296000,7,560,4.450980392156863

7562703,5,B01948X3CK,"They have chucked tons of cash at this interesting film. It is actually a biography - some would say a hagiography - of Michiel de Ruyter and that is the original title of the film. He is very famous in the Netherlands and was voted the seventh best Dutch person ever. In England we don't really know about him because he had the temerity to beat us at fighting.

Yes this is all about his sea faring antics and the political turmoil of the Dutch Republic under De Witt and the internal strife caused by the Orangists. Throw in the Battle of the Medway and a few other clashes and you have a rather interesting film. Oh and Rutger Hauer and Charles Dance are in this but for mere minutes of screen time. That said all the actors do great jobs especially so Frank Lammers (`Black Book' and `Bullhead') in the title role.

The ships are stunning and even though a lot of CGI is used we do have real sailing ships which are beautiful. The attention to detail is fantastic and the battles have a high degree of authenticity. The direction is superb and some of the camera work is artistic and captivating. Critics have railed that this is essentially a glorification of the Netherlands' colonial past - but it is only ever alluded to in the film and not glorified - passed off as `commerce'. And it is pretty light on some of the historical facts; however it does show a fair few warts from the past just not all of them.

As a film it is riveting and has politics, love interest, mob rule, battles and tons of action - so it managed to pass muster for me; in Dutch with some English and good sub titles and as such I can easily recommend this film.",1458259200,6,1645,4.31715210355987

7562718,5,B01948X3CK,I didn't finish it because I don't like subtitled movies but I won't rate it badly because of that. I thought it was very well done and triggered an interest for me in the history and life of the real admiral.,1458000000,,209,4.121951219512195
7562719,5,B01948X3CK,"Very well done historical movie.  Battle scenes were incredible.  The Dutch did a great job!  My only complaint is with Amazon Video, in that they did not indicate anywhere that the movie was subtitled.  I watched this movie with a person who does not read English well enough to keep up, so I had to read the subtitles out loud throughout the movie.",1457827200,16,350,4.507936507936508

7562722,5,B01948X3CK,"I loved this movie.  Being of Dutch origin myself, I was extremely interested as my knowledge of Dutch history
has large holes especially regarding the English wars with the Netherlands.
This admiral was an admirable person who always answered his country's call even when he
knew he would not return.  His wife was no less of a strong character.
 I had no idea that the Dutch Republic was so short-lived or that it ended with such barbarity.
William of Orange, who would soon become King of England, is not portrayed unsympathetically
but he was obviously responsible for conspiring against and destroying his political rivals, the leaders of the Dutch Republic.
Well-made movie.",1457481600,3,680,5.053571428571429

7562725,5,B01948X3CK,"We often see so how complicated English and French relations were in the 17th century. I was grateful to see how an even more complicated relationship with these powers were developed with the Dutch at that time. Political, social and religious thought was fueled by rumor and fear.
It was devastating to watch the outcome of the sea battles that were waged in these conflicts. What desperate struggles these nations endured as they sought governments that would represent them. In the interim there were brave and noble deeds committed on their behalf. This was so beautifully conveyed in this movie. There were heroes, betrayers, stalwarts, lovers and demons. I loved the cinematography. The soundtrack and music was so moving. I wish all history could be so well captured. Wrongly or rightly, depending on your perspective, this was a tale well told.",1457308800,14,853,5.056737588652482
7562726,5,B01948X3CK,"Was a little scared of the Dutch made film that this was going to be a cheap B movie.  Instead it turned out to have some really great actors and was very captivating.  Some of the CGI was a little under done and the super slow mo was a little annoying at times, but overall it was a very interesting and maddening film.  Glad I bought a copy instead of rented.",1457308800,6,361,4.056338028169014
7562727,5,B01948X3CK,Great foreign movie of the Dutch Admiral Michiel de Ruyter and his non partisan battle to save his country from the English and then from the French along with his struggles internally between the old organist movement and the new republic movement that divided the country and created riots and revolution.

8743865,5,B01948X3CK,"My husband and I saw this after we got home from visiting the Netherlands and it provides a lot of insight into the war between the Dutch and the French during Holland's Golden Age. The film centers around one of the greatest heroes of the Netherlands, Michiel de Ruyter, who was made Admiral of the Dutch fleet at the time the young new republic was on the brink of civil war and was being attacked by the English and French.

Except for a cameo appearance by Rutger Hauer, most Americans will not recognize the names of the cast members as this film is in Dutch, with English subtitles. Even so, it is a well made and there is a English language made for the UK but it is a full 28 minutes shorter. Stick with the Dutch version, even though you'll have to deal with the subtitles. You will be glad  you did.",1526601600,,809,4.281045751633987

8743868,5,B01948X3CK,"Very well made movie that is highly entertaining. It brings to life what I learned as a kid growing up in the Netherlands in history class. Being very young the significance of events is lost however as one does not comprehend what they mean for the struggle of a country. This movie is the history lesson that puts that knowledge in perspective in a great way. The cinematography is excellent. The battle scenes are second to none, showing the brutality of naval warfare in the 17th century. I enjoyed the city scenes showing off places in the Netherlands that have virtually not changed in centuries. I loved that the movie included nuances like showing Vermeer's ""milk maid"" alive in the kitchen, or a Dutch master walking across the square with a freshly painted masterpiece. I recommended this movie to anybody as it is captivating and very well done.",1485648000,,856,4.79054054054054
