7281227,5,B00ZGIOKBQ,"The five stars is for season 2.  Season 1 is mildly entertaining.  Season 2 takes off.  This is really like two different shows, because season 2 changes actors for the wife, adds a second kid, and changes location.  Season 2 if funnier because the new wife has a lot more attitude.  They are poorer and much more like Rednecks.  The wife struggles with all their strange traditions.  Season 2 got rid of the wife's irritating sister and his irritating brother.  Jeff''s father and co-workers are much funnier.  I believe Jeff has his own company is season 1; in season 2 he suffers under the tyranny of his funny female boss.  This show switched networks between seasons 1 and 2.  If season 2 had been first, I think this show would have lasted a long time.  Season 2 is much better than Home Improvement.",1434672000,9,806,4.559440559440559

7281255,5,B00ZGIOKBQ,Cute series. Love Jeff Foxworthy and you can beat the price for all the episodes.,1480636800,,81,4.466666666666667
7281256,5,B00ZGIOKBQ,"I recently saw the latest Foxworthy comedy tour: he didn't have any Red-Neck jokes or talk about Southern people, I was very disappointed. This video is funny! If you like Jeff Foxworthy Red-Neck this is a must see video, It is his old stuff and if is good! I know it was on 2 networks twenty years ago and syndicated on several since and was on Crackle until they took it off this season; but never in a time slot convenient for me to watch or Simple for me to stream on Crackle. I managed to see a few episodes of season 2 before Crackle took it off'. Now I am dyeing to see the rest!

I prefer season 2 over the first. There are a lot of Red-Neck jokes and Jeff imposes his Southern views on Indiana folk in season I; In second season surrounded by Southern people in Georgia, and fully surrounded by Southern minded people. One thing that cracks me up is the Southern names: His boss on the loading dock is Lilly-Ann, my mother's name is Lillian (one syllable) I find that funny.",1475539200,2,983,4.25668449197861
7281257,4,B00ZGIOKBQ,"I think both seasons had something to like - however they are not REALLY the same show in my opinion (not enough to be really season 1 and season 2) - the characters that followed to the second series (mom and son - the father cant be replaced duh!) were not even the same personality, even though one was played by the same actor!! - and the actress that played the first mom was A LOT different then the one who played second mom. I do think it's funny they made fun of themselves for doing this. Anyhoozle the show is still funny enough to rate decently and Jeff Foxworthy is always funny.",1474243200,2,592,4.247787610619469

I wouldn't recommend this for younger kids, because it has quite a bit of adult humor in it. However a humorous redneck option for adults:)",1451865600,,156,4.607142857142857

7281285,4,B00ZGIOKBQ,"I have always been a Jeff Foxworthy fan.  And I love this show.  I think the show was not given the time to grab its own following.  The first season was the best.  It was intelligent, well written humor, and every episode was good for at least 2 good famous ""Redneck"" jokes.  Sometimes more.

After season 1 was cancelled, season 2 had made way too many changes that did not continue the history of season 1 that we all became used to.  Season 1 ended with Jeff's wife giving birth to a baby girl.  Episode 1 of season 2 shows the child as being a boy.  The also changed the location of the family from Indiana in season 1 to Jeff's childhood home in Georgia.  Nothing wrong with that, but they made every character on the show a real stereotype stupid southern idiot.  I am sure this new change had some bad feelings among those fans watching in the deep south.  If I had lived in the south, I would have been offended at how stupid they made them look and act.  I get the redneck humor, but that was just way beyond being a redneck.

Still, season 2 had it's very funny moments.  But not very many.  I wish the first season had been given a chaance to gain an audience and continue with that timeline and characters.  I gave the series 4 stars just because Jeff is a riot, and he got a bad break from the network and producers.",1442361600,,1330,4.214285714285714
