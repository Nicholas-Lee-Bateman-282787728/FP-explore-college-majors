7607990,4,B01ASMCMVE,"It was a little  let down over all. But it was still good. The story was far but it could do so much more. They seem to break up the story by chapters. As for the artwork. You can barely seen the main people. In other word, they look bite different. The whole artwork was not the best. I think they try something new but it did not work out!",1461024000,,341,3.8714285714285714
7607991,3,B01ASMCMVE,"no real plot/stroy like season 1

pretty much etchi  t/a plot ...... was actually hoping they would continue with solving some of the plot of season 1....but no...

fan service everywhere......

art/animation is very detailed and its more comedy scenario episodes the entire season.",1460937600,,282,5.340909090909091
7607992,4,B01ASMCMVE,"This show runs in the exact same vein as Ikkitousen and Sekirei; high school girls with powers getting into fights where their clothes get torn off, and then relaxing in the bath together afterwards. Lots of fan service. Art and music quality are decent.
The actual story is a bit weak, as is to be expected, and particularly this first season seems to mostly be used to establish characters and their backstories. None of it is all that engaging, but it gives us a lot to look forward to in season two.",1460592000,,503,4.478260869565218

7607994,5,B01ASMCMVE,"Great fanservice show.

Considering it's genre this show is undoubtedly only going to be seen by a niche amount of people, but for those who do indeed seek it out, I highly recommend they buy it. In my opinion it is right up there quality-wise with other fanservice shows like Freezing and Highschool DxD. I will keep my review as simple as possible... Maken-ki 2 has great art, even better than the first season. The studio that created it, Xebec, has already proven itself as a great fanservice studio. Hiraku Kaneko also worked on this project. For those who don't know, Kaneko is pretty much an legend in the oppai ecchi comnunity. Known for directing Seikon no Qwaser and Manyuu Hikenchou (other shows I definitely recommend), Kaneko brings his signature ""boob""-design to the Maken-ki girls and it is great. You can recognize Kaneko's influence on a project typically by the way nipples are drawn, or audibly by the way the girl's breasts flop and smack realistically when they move as opposed to the comical ""boing!"" sound effects in most big boob shows. The final piece that makes Makin-ki 2 great is the Funimation dub. The voice acting is great for all the characters, but the true genius of the dub comes from the script changes. Funimation ecchi dubs are usually funny in their own special ways, but the dub for Maken-ki 2 is genuinely hilarious... and perhaps most importantly, it is VERY self-aware of the kind of show it is. I definitely recommend this show for any fans of the genre.",1460505600,11,1498,4.739463601532567
7607995,5,B01ASMCMVE,"Finally got my copy of the second season and have watched two episodes so far. The story line so far is pretty much the same as the first season, except for the fact that you see a little more character development. But since I have only watched the first two episodes I really can't offer much more. If you are a fan of ""fan service"" you will appreciate it also, if not then you may want to pass this up. It was a little expensive, but what the heck if you like the series then go for it.  Totally recommend this for any anime fan.",1460419200,2,532,4.066666666666666

7607997,5,B01ASMCMVE,"- Synopsis: The girls and their sexy bodies are back in this sequel. The silliness and perversion continues as new threats disrupt their routine school activities. The characters are once again tasked with solving these issues which leads to even more ecchi situations; not that our protagonist Takeru is complaining. How will this anime's conclusion be decided as Takeru and friends face new and powerful enemies that once again, threaten their way of life?
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: Like the first one, the amount of fan-service is extremely high. There will be plenty of boobs throughout. Keep this in mind if fan-service isn't for you. Plot-wise, it is simplistic and doesn't have much. Since this is an Ecchi, it typically lacks substance as it emphasizes a light-hearted tone that isn't meant to be deeply analyzed. It's meant to serve as a guilty-pleasure, as well as an anime that generates plenty of eye-candy.

- Analysis: Some of the concepts I drew from this is that many guys are simplistic: perverted, easily manipulated, and may maintain the chivalrous mentality of protecting women. Of course, men and women can be perverted. Both genders are also easily manipulated depending on the situation. And certain animes, especially with a strong female lead, are the ones that protect the men. Which is pretty interesting with the swapping of roles.

Since interactions are emphasized, this may give implications that life heavily entails relationships and communication. That is, nobody is truly alone; regardless of religious views, even in death, people aren't perceived as being alone. As for communication, there is almost never a time when another person doesn't interacts someone. In the physical world, the virtual world, and in a person's dreams, this holds much weight and relevance.

- Features: English and Japanese audio, as well as English subtitles. Includes 10 episodes on 2 Blu-rays and 10 on 2 DVDs with a run-time of about 4.5 hours. A little on the short-side. This anime is designated with the TV-MA rating for some violence, and extremely high amounts of sexual content. Mainly nudity.

7608000,5,B01ASMCMVE,"More fun anime hijinks with triple the fanservice of the first season. The only reason I'd drop a star would be for the fact that there is no plot through the season, and thus no character development. Each episode is a stand alone. Normally this would be a bad thing, but its kind of like Full Metal Panic Fumofu, its all about the fanservice and comedy this season. Fun to watch.",1472947200,,381,4.380281690140845
7608001,5,B01ASMCMVE,"It arrived on time and in perfect condition. Now, this second season isn't a continuation to season 1, not really. It's basically pure fan service lol. Not complaining really, since it's still funny and great quality, I'm just saying. If you're looking for closure with the story, read the manga. However if you're looking for fan service filled fun, you won't be disappointed at all. It was a really fun watch",1472428800,,410,4.788732394366197
7608002,2,B01ASMCMVE,"I wish I could say that this season was a great follow-up to a mostly stellar first season. I wish I could say the season plot was cohesive or the characters were still charming or even that the animation at least tried to equal the quality of that aforementioned first season. I can't. This is nothing more than bad fan service for the sake of bad fan service. No season plot. Each episode is its own bottle plot, none of the characters grow into anything, the women just become sex objects, and every episode has to have a stupid nudity flash at least once for every female character. Plot-wise? Each problem the characters run into usually derives from either panty thieves (I cringe at writing that) or some weird supernatural event that seems to exist solely to separate on of the dozen or so main female characters from their clothing for the totally telegraphed boob shot. What's the answer to this problem? Why, just have the male characters act twice as perverse as they did in the first season and make all the women dumb bimbos (brilliant!).
Look, I wish Maken_Ki could have maintained the level of quality from the first season. I wish the female characters could have remained as endearing and well-written as their first season counterparts. I wish the main male character could have remained the bumbling perv with the heroic streak that went out of his way to protect his friends and (usually) got himself into trouble due to bad timing or just general bad luck. None of this will happen. Good luck suffering through episodes that feel like nothing but skin-heavy mini-episodes with mindless plots just to get to the next gratuitous panty shot.",1472428800,,1660,4.747404844290657
7608003,3,B01ASMCMVE,"Maken-Ki Two is an independent story (or lack thereof). It was disappointing that some of the original voice cast was not present, and all of the episodes were completely independent (read as incongruent). The second season does not have anything to do with the main story from the first season, and it feels as if it was created just for the sake of being created. I was not impressed by the artwork or the lack of story, but from what I have seen, there is not enough story in the books to create a continuation of the original story at this point.

There are a few moments in this season that I found entertaining, but not enough for me to justify buying it outside of my desire to own the sequels to the stories that I did enjoy in the past. I was not impressed with the show by any means, but it is certainly not the worst show I have ever seen. If you are looking for pointless fan service and odd humor, this one is pretty solid in both departments, but if you are looking for a decent story, dialogue, and a continuation of the original plot, don't waste your time or money on this season.",1470528000,,1097,4.274038461538462

7608010,3,B01ASMCMVE,The first season was good. This second season was lacks in both art work and story plot. It was more like a series of accidents and incident with no plot at all.

7608013,5,B01ASMCMVE,"Maken-ki 2 is an OVA styled anime pseudo sequel of Maken-ki Battling Venus with a more heavy focus of unsaid messages or feelings from the story getting across each episode is dedicated to a character.

Originally AIC Studios did collaboration with XEBEC for the 1st season but stuff happened  and AIC was left out the picture. This season is mostly getting messages across and unwinding misunderstanding between characters but since is an Ecchi done on the greatest form of fan service ever.

It's juicy and most of all its a consolidation prize since things broke down but XEBEC delivered nevertheless.  If you want a direct continuation it's not here. This is sheer character development on juicy ways by one of the masters of Ecchi.",1461283200,2,736,4.911290322580645
