After seeing season one, I truly thought they had pushed every limit and took all the possible risks...but nope, they brought this season to the next level! Never a dull moment with these episodes. With this show- you don't want to even think about leaving your couch for a bag of chips; you might miss something.

4332659,5,B004DL0L8I,"The Buried Life continue the documentation of their journey in Season Two. Four guys, one question: ""What do you want to do before you die?"".

They've already snuck into the Playboy Mansion, helped deliver a baby, and played basketball with Obama. In this season, the guys cross off:

Get In A Fight
Capture A Fugitive
Accept A Dare
Escape from a Deserted Island

...and many others!

I think that Ben, Dave, Jonnie and Duncan are truly insprirational- grabbing life by the horns, doing things they've always dreamed of and making an amazing effort to help strangers along the way. I also own Season One of TBL, and it does not disappoint! Seriously, check these guys out. You won't regret it!",1301788800,,693,4.75
4332660,5,B004DL0L8I,"As a ""Buried Life"" fan I couln not expect less.  It includes all the second season episodes.  It also brings some extra special features.  Not as I would expect, since you can find those at MTV.com.  They make a statement that you may have some technicals difficulties when playing it sonce the produce the DVD's themselves.  But I have watch them on my PC and DVD player and have no problems at all.  Great gift to a friends who need a life bost!",1299456000,,447,4.325301204819277

8425532,5,B004DL0L8I,"This is a very uplifting and inspiring television series. Four men journey through North America to complete their bucket list and help strangers with their own list items. They are funny, smart and creative as they craft plans to get through any obstacles that may come in their way. Their program gives the classic message that anything is possible. if this doesn't make you look at life in a new perspective and want to create a bucket list, i don't know what will.",1367280000,,468,4.650602409638554

8425535,4,B004DL0L8I,"This was fun to watch, although a bit predictable and in the case of attaining a lock of Robert Pattinson's hair, almost cliche and definitely disappointing. It's worth the price of the episode though.",1355097600,,201,4.9411764705882355

8425537,4,B004DL0L8I,"If you liked the Buried Lfe season one, then you'll enjoy season 2 just as much. I would definetly recommend getting it now that the show is cancelled.",1325203200,,151,4.428571428571429
8425538,5,B004DL0L8I,"I was at first skeptical about season 2 when I ended season 1 of the buried life.  I was hoping their fame wouldn't get in the way (and mtv wouldn't help them out too much) and wondered how they could one up themselves.  They definitely met my expectations and went even bigger.  Just like season 1, I watched all of these in succession within a few weeks.  Inspiring show.. the type that makes you change your perspective on daily life, and inspires you to go out and live it!  Must buy!",1308787200,,488,4.318681318681318
