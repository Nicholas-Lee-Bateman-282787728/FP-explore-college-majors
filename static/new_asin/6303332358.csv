7843721,3,6303332358,"I picked up a copy of this for 3 reasons: [1] Kari Wuhrer, [2] Eric Roberts, and [3] Ron Perlman.

Eric Roberts. With a filmography as long as Brigitte Bardot's hair, Eric Roberts shows up in the darnedest places; from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Heroes/dp/B000QDLSR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Heroes</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inherent-Vice/dp/B00QXIIZ3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inherent Vice</a>&nbsp;to season 3 of L'Onore e il Rispetto, he tends to steal the show whenever he appears on screen, and Sensation is no exception. If you don't recognize his name, you will surely recognize his face.

Ron Perlman. Many will immediately associate him with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sons-of-Anarchy/dp/B00S9S12ES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sons of Anarchy</a>, but I will always remember Ron for his stunning role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-cit-eacute-des-enfants-perdus/dp/B000MQ787U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La cit&eacute; des enfants perdus</a>. If you want to see Ron get knocked out by a woman (oops, sorry for the spoiler), Sensation would be the movie. He has a minor role here, but I'm glad he showed up for the paycheck.

Kari Wuhrer. While not a household name, some know Kari Wuhrer as Capt. Maggie Beckett from nearly 50 episodes of the classic sci-fi adventure show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sliders/dp/B00NTWTWDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sliders</a>. A fairly talented actress, she does a terrific job in Sensation as the protagonist, and if you had always wished for a Maggie Beckett wardrobe malfunction in Sliders: well, there is nothing left to the imagination in Sensation. All too obvious in this B film and others, Kari's implants are now thankfully a thing of the past. You can read about it in her blog:

As for the movie itself: I don't know that I would have 3-star liked Sensation if Kari Wuhrer and Eric Roberts had not portrayed the two main characters. While not legitimately scary, I'd be lying if I said Sensation didn't create tension that kept me engaged and had me guessing at the murderer right up to the last minute (due to the addition of troubled males to the storyline). Having researched who had roles in Sensation and paying no attention to the plot description, I had no idea that Sensation was going to be so racy (it's practically soft-core), yet upon seeing this it didn't seem out of place for a creepy-freaky thriller.",1428192000,,2680,6.49859943977591
7843722,4,6303332358,"Sex, lies, sex, mystical powers, sex dreams and a murder mystery to boot!
 This erotic thriller stars Kari Wuhrer, who is a young student with the ability to pick up 'sensations' of objects about they're owners. Eric Roberts is a college professor who wants to study her gift.
 What he's failed to mention is that these objects belong to a dead student, and he is suspect number one... By the time Kari finds this out she's sucked in too deep to walk away, haunted by erotic dreams, and a need to help the dead girl who is taking over her life. But does Eric want to help her, or silence her?
 OK, the sting in the tale isn't to hard to guess, but Sensation is still an enjoyable movie.",1036713600,2,686,4.3023255813953485
