8333837,1,B001PMVH3Q,"This animated version of Petfi's poem (that is, not Kacsoh's musical), while considered somewhat of a classic in Hungary, is an abysmal piece of work. Jankovics's 1973 reinterpretation is exactly that: distinctly psychedelic, and bizarrely sexualized. Often creepy, and occasionally graphically and gorily violent, this film is not suitable for children, for whom it was intended, and one hopes that adults would be more discriminating as well.",1308873600,,444,5.641791044776119
