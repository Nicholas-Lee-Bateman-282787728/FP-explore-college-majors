7800611,1,1629971278,"The Title of the product is listed as, ""The Great Courses: Robotics,"" yet no where in the description of the product are robots mentioned.

Instead, a long description about learning all about the Higgs Boson particle is given as a 720 minute, multi-part lecture series by theoretical physicist Professor Carroll, as he explains in painful detail the events leading up to the discovery while he was actually present at CERN.

The REAL robot course is offered by Professor John Long, Ph. D., and is a complete 24 lecture series (31 minutes each) all about Robots, from the beginnings, through the development of greater capabilities, and out to the future of robotics.

The course, perhaps not available on Amazon (and I'm not plopping down two and a half bills to find out which is right - the title or the description) is available from the creators of the product, ""The Great Courses"" (on their web site).",1466121600,22,907,4.838709677419355
