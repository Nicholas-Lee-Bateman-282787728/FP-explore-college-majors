3988334,5,B002U6DVPI,"I had been aware of this film for a number of years, but had always failed to watch it. I recently checked it out of my local library and the DVD sat on top of my TV for days until I finally took the time to watch it. To be honest, I couldn't understand what all the fuss was about until toward the end of the movie; it really carries an emotional punch with it. This is not a snapshot of the beautiful America that most foreigners have of our country. There are few manicured lawns and towering mansions in this film. The characters do not lead glamourous lives; you will never see them on the covers of magazines in the check-out lines in the supermarket. But it took a German filmmaker to create a visually stunning portrait of a side of America that few people ever really see, especially in the usual films that you rent at your local video store. There is so much sadness, regret, pain and utter desolation in this film and it's oftentimes reflected in the vast landscape of the American Southwest. Do yourself a favor today and watch this film. Its characters and story and music will stay with you long after you watch the ending credits!",1279324800,11,1146,4.384976525821596
3988335,5,B002U6DVPI,"Occasionally, a film comes along that, in its simplicity, captures the character of a landscape as well as the people in it.  Such a movie is ""Paris, Texas,"" German director Wim Wenders' second American film.  His first, ""Hammett"" (1982), was re-edited by its producer to make it more commercial.  Two years later, Wenders returned to America with European financing and full artistic freedom, and created ""Paris, Texas,"" a road movie of great visual beauty that works on several levels.

The story focuses on Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton).  Our first image of the character is a distant shot of him emerging from the Southwestern desert, a scene reminiscent of Omar Sharif on camel in ""Lawrence of Arabia"" slowly approaching the camera as heat rising from the desert sands gives the scene a mirage-like effect.  Travis wanders into a small Texas town and collapses from exhaustion.  The local doctor contacts Travis' brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) who, with his wife, has been raising Travis' son, Hunter.  Travis goes back to Walt's home in Los Angeles, but remains distant.  Uncomfortable with life in the suburbs, he decides to take his son and go back to Texas to find his former wife and Hunter's mother, Jane (Nastassja Kinski).

The movie is technically a road picture, but also explores themes of redemption and restlessness while couching itself in mystery.  We're told that Travis has been lost for five years, but are never clued in as to where he's been.  This gives a mythic aura to the character.  Man on a quest -- a modern day Don Quixote not jousting at windmills but lost in the metaphoric desert.

This is the only movie in which Stanton was the star.  He's made quite a career as character actor, but this is his best role.  His rugged face suggests a man who's experienced a hard, unhappy life, and his reticence suggests a Gary Cooper-like Everyman.

Wenders lets his images resonate with the viewer rather than editing quickly.  He establishes a slow pace that allows us to see what Travis and the other characters are thinking.  This is not a movie overstuffed with dialogue.  The locations -- flat sun-drenched, wide-open -- capture the beauty of the Southwest.

With evocative cinematography by Robby Muller and music by Ry Cooder, ""Paris, Texas"" is a beautiful looking film with a distinctly American feel.
The Criterion Blu-ray edition contains audio commentary by Wim Wenders; ""The Road to Paris, Texas,"" a 43-minute making-of documentary; deleted scenes; and a featurette containing reminiscences by Claire Denis and Allison Anders, the film's first assistant director and production assistant, respectively.",1271980800,4,2646,5.078703703703703
3988336,5,B002U6DVPI,"""Paris, Texas""(1984) is directed by Wim Wenders (Wings of Desire). Even though Wim Wenders directed 12 feature films before this one he said that this was his second film since it took all of his previous films for him to be able to make this one. Sam Shepard and Kit Carson wrote the screenplay, and Ry Cooder supplied the wonderfully melancholic slide guitar music. The film begins with Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) wandering apparently aimlessly in the Southwestern desert of the U.S. Initially he seems to have amnesia, and we discover later that he has been in incognito for four years. Gradually he emerges from his psychological retreat from the world with the help of his brother who has been taking care of his son. This is a film that slowly unfolds its secrets as Travis continues a healing process which began when he first ran out into the desert, running away from civilization and his old life. The story comes full circle when Travis finds his missing wife, Jane (Nastassja Kinski), and we learn the full story about what led to Travis' escape from the world. This film won't be to everyone's taste who is used to the fast pace of the city, as this movie at times is as slowly relentless, and harsh as the parched desert itself, its landscape the bare bones of a man who has come face to face with his dark side and hasn't liked what he saw.

This blu-ray is remastered with DTS-HD Master Audio, and has a large number of special features, including interviews with Wim Wenders, Ry Cooder, Dean Stanton, Peter Falk, Dennis Hopper, Hanns Zishler, Patricia Highsmith, Claire Dennis, Allison Anders, and Samuel Fuller. There is also ""Wim Wenders Hollywood April '84"", which is a French television segment featuring Wenders and Cooder at work on the score. There are also deleted scenes and a booklet featuring interviews with Stanton, Sam Shepard, Nastassja Kinski, Dean Stockwell, as well as an essay by film critic Nick Roddick.",1271030400,4,1952,4.809523809523809
3988337,5,B002U6DVPI,"Criterion's Blu-ray transfer is magnificent.  The image is very natural, with great depth - I viewed this via a 1080p projector, and the transfer was as film-like as could be hoped for.  The soundtrack is as impressive - with Ry Cooder's music being so integral to the heart of the film, this improvement over DVD is very welcome.

I remember first viewing this at the cinema in the 80s.  To be honest, I found it a bit gruelling.  At that time I hadn't seen much in the way of European cinema, and the American setting and actors had me expecting a film with not just a different pace but a different emotional world.

Now I find 'Paris, Texas' makes me think of a strange mix of other films.

Firstly, classic Westerns; most notably, 'The Searchers' - primarily for the mood evoked by the vast expanse of landscape, but also for the ultimately unfathomable motivations of the characters - however much you learn about Travis (or Ethan Edwards) the story behind their actions remains incomplete.

Terrence Malick's 'Days of Heaven' also comes to mind - again there is ravishing cinematography, and the overwhelming sense of immense space; there is also the direct connection with Sam Shepherd writing for Wenders and acting for Malick; the characters too share a terrifying vision of love, a vision that seems embodied in their physical surroundings - the superficial beauty is tied to an emotional emptiness, a kind of directionlessness, where ordinary morality is limited in its powers.  It's as if both films speak of a freedom, intoxicating and full of promise, but which is also frightening, in that anything is possible and everything feels insecure.

More distant allusions reach to the 'existentialist' American road movies of the late 60s and early 70s, such as 'Vanishing Point' and 'Two-Lane Blacktop'.  Where are all these men going?  The image of the driver staring out at the world, on an inescapable journey, towards something unknowable (at the most obvious level, towards death), and away from his past - all these films share this perspective.

Ry Cooder's music envelopes the film, augmenting mood, and somehow heightening the importance of any particular image - as an aside, Ry Cooder recorded the entire score in little over a day!  The music's role reminds me of Jim Jarmusch's 'Dead Man' - Neil Young's guitar likewise permeates the bones of that film.

Wenders' own European background also suggests links to German cinema of the 70s, notably his own works, but also those of Herzog and Fassbinder.  The emotional pathology of the protagonists is starkly reminiscent of the narcissism, dissociation, and quasi-psychotic states of various characters inhabiting Fassbinder's prolific career, and there is a gentler association with Bruno S., especially in 'Stroszek' (once again set in America) - Travis reveals a dislocated child-like aspect to his character, touchingly played out through his contact with his son, Hunter.  The pieces of his character are not coherent, however - his chaotic inner life is glimpsed literally through windows or through telephone wires, and along with child-like sympathy, there is rage, envy, jealousy, and despair. These emotions are impossible to bear, and so they are beaten down, his face scored but impassive.  His efforts at denial detach him from reality, and Wenders' film charts his brief, and inwardly conflicted and complicated, return to the world shared by others.

The other characters in 'Paris,Texas' also live at one remove from reality.  The depressing darkened world of Jane, Nastassja Kinski, is a literal as well as a metaphoric house of fantasies - one wonders if David Lynch was watching. Travis's brother Walt, Dean Stockwell, and his wife Anne, Aurore Clement, also maintain a problematic relationship with the world, despite a superficial normalcy - their stories are only hinted at, yet there is an element of fantasy in their adoption of Hunter as ""their own"" child, and Anne in particular is worried that losing Hunter will see their relationship, or in her words their ""world"", collapse.

Unsurprisingly, what I've mentioned goes nowhere near exhausting ideas inspired by the film.  It is long, and the narrative is simple - but this is not what makes watching the film a demanding and taxing experience.  The emotional foundation of the film is very disturbing - there is pain, and fear, and a real sense of people being broken. This is not meant to be merely a pleasant entertainment.  It is harrowing, and it is a meditation not a diversion. The fragility of the human experience is here - in the faces, the images, the words, and most poignantly in Ry Cooder's haunted music.",1266364800,16,4668,5.032467532467533
3988338,5,B002U6DVPI,"Films made about the United States by foreign filmmakers are interesting because quite often they provide a unique perspective - someone from the outside looking in. German filmmaker Wim Wenders did just this with his film Paris, Texas. It was a collaboration with acclaimed playwright and actor Sam Shepard and can be seen as a kind of lament for an era of the American west that no longer exists. It's an American road movie about characters living on the fringes of society and was made during the peak of the materialistic Reagan era. Paris, Texas went on to win the coveted Palme d'Or at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival and firmly established Wenders as an art house darling.

The first disc features an audio commentary by filmmaker Wim Wenders. The director talks about how he and Ry Cooder decided to use the music that is in the Paris, Texas. Wenders also talks about the origins of the film and working with Sam Shepard on the screenplay. The director talks about the genesis of the film's title and how it relates to Travis. Wenders tells many filming anecdotes on this informative track.

Also included is a theatrical trailer.

The second disc starts off with an interview with Wenders from 2001. He had wanted to make a film about America but hadn't done it to his satisfaction with his previous films. It wasn't until Paris, Texas that he felt like he had achieved this goal. It was also the first time he worked in a spontaneous fashion without a pre-planned shot list.

""The Road to Paris, Texas"" is a collection of interviews with key collaborators of Wenders over the years. They all speak admiringly of the man. Wenders talks about the influence of rock `n' roll and road movies on his work.

Also included are interviews with both Claire Denis and Allison Anders, who worked on the film as first assistant director and production assistant respectively. They went on to become directors in their own right. They give their impressions of Wenders, how they met him and what it was like to work with the filmmaker. In addition, Anders reads from the diary that she kept while working on the film.

""Cinema Cinemas"" is a segment from an April 2, 1984 episode of this French television programming featuring Wenders and composer Cooder working on the score for Paris, Texas. Wenders talks about his love of rock `n' roll music. It was a dream of his to have Cooder work on his film.

There is a collection of deleted scenes with optional commentary by Wenders. We see more of the German doctor taking care of Travis at the beginning of the film. Most of this footage is bits and pieces that just didn't fit and were ultimately cut. Also included is fantastic Super 8 mm footage, some of which was used in the flashback sequences so as to resemble old home movies.

Finally, there are ""Galleries,"" one a collection of photographs that Wenders took while location scouting in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California. The other gallery is a nice collection of on behind-the-scenes stills taken on location.",1264982400,18,3020,4.739047619047619

3988375,3,B002U6DVPI,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 Wim Wenders's love for Americana propelled him to collaborate with famed playwright Sam Shepard and the result was the visually satisfying but inert drama, ""Paris, Texas."" The film's style (as noted in Wikipedia) include shots of ""old advertisement billboards, placards, graffiti, rusty iron carcasses, old railway lines, neon signs, and motels,"" to name a few. Many of Wenders's scenes here remind me of Edward Hopper paintings and despite the limitations of the film's narrative, it's well worth watching simply for the visual feast.

The film's plot proceeds quite slowly. Walt Henderson is alerted that his brother, Travis, has been found dehydrated after walking in the South Texas desert. Walt drives from Los Angeles and picks Travis up, intending to return home to L.A., with his brother in tow. It's been four years since Travis disappeared and left his son Hunter to be raised by Walt and his wife, Anne. For quite a while, Travis is mute much to his brother's chagrin, who is desperate to find out where's he's been while missing. When Travis finally talks, all he can virtually talk about is a parcel of land he bought in Paris, Texas, where their parents allegedly met and conceived him.

The second act--perhaps the most interesting part of the film--chronicles Travis's awkward attempts to bond with his son, Hunter, once he and Walt arrive back in L.A. Anne is upset that Walt is encouraging Travis to get close to Hunter, since she fears that he'll take the boy away. Actually, that's exactly what happens--Travis asks Hunter if he would like to come with him to find his ex-wife, Jane, who had left the family since she could not cope raising Hunter. Travis and Hunter head to Houston where they bond on the way there. It should be noted that Hunter Carson did a fantastic job of playing his fictional counterpart, a role that required a great deal of nuance and sensitivity.

If the two ""bonding"" stories (one between the two brothers and the other between father and son) prove to be fairly interesting, the film's resolution, unfortunately does not. A.A. Dowd writing in the ""A.V. Club,"" cogently notes what's wrong with the narrative: ""There's just something weirdly banal and unsatisfying about the explanation Wenders and Shepard belatedly supply. What drove Travis to abandon his family and flee for the freedom of Mexico? I'm afraid it's nothing more complicated than a case of run-of-the-mill relationship troubles, revealed during a very long monologue that places Travis on one side of a two-way mirror and his ex, Jane (Nastassja Kinski)--now dancing at a seedy Houston strip club to make ends meet--on the other.""

""Run-of-the-mill"" explanations also apply to the film's title--none of the characters actually end up going to Paris, Texas and the Travis's story of his origins in that particular town, is hardly the stuff of high drama.

Travis finally figures out that he's not cut out to be a father and abandons Hunter and Jane to fend for themselves. Presumably, Jane, will do the right thing and return Hunter to Walt and Anne, where he'll end up having a normal childhood.

As ""Paris, Texas"" is considered one of Wenders's best films, one might conclude that he is a master of style but has difficulty in the ""substance"" department. ""Paris, Texas"" is well worth watching for the visuals but prepare yourself for a promising story that ultimately runs out of gas.",1427673600,,3442,4.963541666666667
3988376,5,B002U6DVPI,"Great film, even better on Criterion's Blu-Ray.  Robby Mller's cinematography and Wim Wenders direction are impeccable.",1421884800,,119,6.4375
3988377,4,B002U6DVPI,"Of course. you're already aware that the German director, Wim Wenders was part of the German ""new cinema"" movement back in the 80's and that this film is a prime example.  Exactly what the German ""new cinema"" was, and how it was any different from the older cinema, I won't even pretend to bore you, by pretending to understand the nuances.

Here's the skinny.  The plot for this could be summed up in about two sentences.  This sounds like a remarkably thin plot for a movie which runs approximately 2.5 hours.  Why would anyone watch it, let alone award it the Palme d'Or at Cannes?  Second, what exactly does ""Palme d Or"" mean, anyhow?

I won't look up the translation but will observe, quoting the intelligent provided essay, that in 1984 Ronald Reagan was President of the US and Europe, particularly European film makers, were hardly in love with the US--at least the way our government ran foreign affairs.  Yet here was a
German filmmaker, making a 2.5 hour long movie in the American Southwest, with American actors, and the dialog in English.  Some called it Europe's love-note to the US--not necessarily the US in practice, but the IDEA of the US, which was in part a country so large, and particularly the Western half so sparsely populated, that the very land breathed a sense of freedom that often seemed lacking in Europe.

Then I shall point out the ""art director"" for the production is listed as ""Kate Altman"".  Was this the wife of the famous American director, Robert Altman?  I DON'T KNOW, but it could be, since his wife's name was Katherine, she survived his death in 2006, and lastly when George W. Bush
ran for President, Altman stated that if Bush were elected he'd move to Paris.  When Bush WAS elected, he said of course, what he meant was he'd move to Paris, Texas--so he was certainly quite cognizant of the film many years later--which he surely would have been if his wife had collaborated
on it.

The two sentence plot is: In the first half of the film, a man is reunited with his brother and son.  In the second half, he sees his wife for the first time in 4 years.  Doesn't sound riveting?  The draw of this film is its cinematographic beauty.  The story unfolds between Big Bend, Texas and Southern
California, and the Texas vistas are so large that they drive home just why Texans love to call it ""the Big state.""  However, even the city scenes and the interiors are generally beautifully filmed.

The dialog is as uncluttered as the vast Texan landscapes (hence the simplicity of the plot).  One might consider this a ""modern Western"", if by that
one means a film centered in the American West--but it's misleading I suppose to use that term, as it associates the film with a genre it doesn't really fit.  Last I should mention the score--mostly slide guitar by Ry Cooder, the greatest slide guitarist you never heard of.  His acoustics lend a mournful note to those vast, unpopulated vistas, and the tale is a rather mournful tale, about the distances between even people who genuinely love each other, and the distances between what we know to be true and what we wish were true.  Yes, in a way its like a visual Remembrance of Things Past [another very long but classic work].  The film ends with a departure but not exactly a resolution.  I have a resolution in my mind as I saw the closing images, and like to imagine that it was in the director's and the writer's minds as well but who knows, sometimes there is a beauty in letting the viewer fill in the blanks with your own meanings.

If you want to see filmmaking as a visual art, without the use of the modern digital special effects that have become staples, but with complete use of color as a part of that beauty, then you may find this 2.5 hours time well spent.  I give it an A-.",1419897600,6,3781,4.536873156342183
3988398,5,B002U6DVPI,"I was scanning through the TV guide when I was bored one night, and saw that TCM was running a marathon of Nastassja Kinski (whose work I really like) films.  Having never heard of this movie before, the description of the plot sounded interesting and I gave it a go.  What a pleasant surprise to find that movie making like this hadn't completely vanished in the 80s, as this story could have easily been at home in the 60s or 70s.

I do not want to go into too much detail, but it is a story of a man who just left everything behind and wandered for four years until his brother took him back home to get reacquainted with his son.  Not previously familiar with Harry Dean Stanton, his performance is passionate and touching as the man who left everything behind when his marriage fell apart, only to slowly reconnect with it again.  His silence and emptiness are often reflected in the scenic shots around him.

With the aid of his brother and sister-in-law (who I wanted to slap sometimes), he tracks down his wife with his son along for the ride, and we find out just what made them fall apart.  His son was played by the director's little boy, and he was surprisingly cute, charming, and talented (not just lucky), which made the journey of this movie an extra pleasure.

If you want a faster moving story with more action and straight to the point, Paris Texas is not for you.  If you like beautiful, well thought out films with poetic symbolism that doesn't hit you over the head, where sometimes actions say more than the dialogue, then this one is a keeper.",1419724800,2,1567,4.451048951048951
3988399,5,B002U6DVPI,"Any viewer must mindfully discern the emerging central conflict....because it's in the title.  A road film where space is almost a tacit character, and the people or characters flail about in space searching for their own meaning.  Also, driving theme of idealism vs. realism, and projecting one's ideals onto a person who might be quite different. Think: Cervantes' ""Don Quixote.""  where less is more, and the driving theme emerges gradually, just as Travis seems to emerge from the south Texas landscape while a disinterested eagle perches, scans him, then flies away.  A viewer might lose interest anywhere in the first 40 minutes waiting for the tedious yet common media-created  violence to crunch Travis, his brother and sister-in-law, and his young son, Hunter, an improbable but plausible leader as he begins to know and love and trust his errant father. Okay, it's about love, and the Socratic maxim: ""Know thyself.""  Ho-hum...so much trouble nowadays, but oh so badly needed.  But wait! You will forget that  Harry Dean Stanton is the actor as his character, Travis,  tracks down Jane, finally with his son Hunter, to a Houston girlie salon with oneway glass.  Then, hold the remote, be ready to stop, reverse, repeat dialogue because Sam Shepherd's is so natural, so plausible, as Jane finally comes to grips in sober honesty with why she left, why she became a failed mother.

3988421,5,B002U6DVPI,"Paris, Texas (1984)
Drama, 147 minutes
Directed by Wim Wenders
Starring Harry Dean Stanton, Nastassja Kinski and Dean Stockwell

The first thing to mention about Paris, Texas is how quickly the opening scene establishes a mood. We are shown sweeping shots of a desert to the sound of Ry Cooder's haunting guitar. A man who we will later know as Travis (Stanton) comes into view. He looks like he's been wandering for days. He's wearing a red cap and jeans and his beard looks several weeks old. He wanders into an isolated bar and collapses.

A local clinic tends to his injuries and contacts his brother, Walt (Stockwell), who flies from Los Angeles to collect him. It's been four years since the two last met and Walt had wondered whether Travis was still alive. Travis doesn't speak during this meeting and Walt has to show extreme patience while he waits for Travis to begin explaining what happened. In a sense, the audience is in the same situation. For almost 30 minutes, the film plays out like a total mystery.

Walt wants to fly Travis home because he took in his child as his own when Travis disappeared. Travis insists that they drive, and on using the same rental car Walt drove when he picked him up. We learn that Travis has bought some land in Paris, Texas, but he can't remember why. It's clear that Travis has been through a traumatic experience and has attempted to block out those memories.

Travis makes two important decisions during the story:

The first could spawn all manner of debate about whether it is right or wrong. His mental health is in question, and yet he makes a decision that could drastically alter someone's life; or perhaps the lives of several people. You'll have to decide for yourself whether his actions were justified.

The second decision comes as a result of a meeting with a person who used to be important in his life. In the final 25 minutes of the film, we are shown a very unusual conversation. It's tense, emotional, brave, heartbreaking and elegant all at once. It's this conversation which elevates the film to the level of greatness. The ending is almost impossible to predict early in the film, and that's something I find refreshing. Here's a film with an idea and it's perfectly executed.

Harry Dean Stanton has played so many colorful characters over the years, but Paris, Texas gives him his most significant role. He gives Travis depth and the film wouldn't work without him. His appearance and haunted expression fit the character and his performance is quiet, but powerful.

Nastassja Kinski's performance as Jane is a revelation. Watch the subtle emotions on her face and hear how expressive her voice can be as she responds to Stanton's monologue. I'm also impressed by Hunter Carson's realistic portrayal of a young boy.

It's always interesting to see things from a different viewpoint and Wim Wenders shows us how he views America. The screenplay and Ry Cooder's score work together well. This is the kind of film that seems timeless. It's a human story set in a world so large that its characters are in danger of becoming lost, but they somehow find their way.

I had to make a choice of my own in this review. Should I give away the whole story so that I could discuss some of the best scenes, or should I say just enough to set the mood? I hope that I have said enough to make you interested in seeing the film. If you do, maybe you'll understand why I withheld so much information.",1331078400,6,3457,4.6524590163934425

Not much there on the surface....but the way it is told brings out those needful things that make a story so worthwhile- and the scenery is fantasticly rendered on Criterion blu-ray which increases one's viewing pleasure.

3988425,5,B002U6DVPI,"Wim Wenders' `Paris, Texas' is a film that completely took me by surprise.  I'm still not exactly sure what I was expecting, but it certainly wasn't this.

I think it's important to know the type of director Wenders is before taking a bite out of `Paris, Texas'.  I haven't seen a lot of his films, but one of my favorite films of all time was directed by the man (`Wings of Desire') so, I can't say I wasn't acquainted with his work before indulging in this cult classic.  Wenders likes to allow the majesty of his surroundings to create an intimate space between the audience and the film itself.  You could liken his style to that of Terrence Malick or even Ingmar Bergman; a man who likes to let silence rest long enough to make a loud impact.  So, when watching a film like `Paris, Texas', be prepared to be completely absorbed in the epic majesty of the screen itself; with long sequences of little apparent progression but ultimately giant leaps of character development.

The silence says so much.

`Paris, Texas' tells the story of a man who's been missing for four years.  He suddenly rears his head again, causing his brother to come rushing to his aid.  This man, Travis, left behind a young bride and a young son when he disappeared, and in his absence his wife went missing as well and his young son, Hunter, came to live with Travis's brother and his wife.  At first silent and awkward, Travis soon begins adjust to the life he left behind, and he begins to attempt atonement, which leads him (and his son) on an interesting journey into the heart of Texas to find Jane, his wayward wife.

At the heart of this film is a beautiful story of a man's love, a deep love that he cannot control or even begin to fully understand.  As he connects (or reconnects) with his son, Travis begins to pick up the pieces of his own broken heart.  His recollection of his own childhood seem to be jumbled with his understanding of his son's own upbringing; possibly a recoil into childish reasoning in order to sustain peace of mind in the midst of his own mistakes.  As he comes face to face with his biggest regret, his story unfolds in excruciatingly heartbreaking fashion.

That final conversation, between Travis and Jane, is remarkable.

`Paris, Texas' has a lot more going for it than a phenomenal story.  The cinematography is outstanding; grand in scope and yet gritty and harsh in tone.  The direction is crisp and understated, allowing the subtle hints of development in story to absorb the audience.  The score, so sullen and eerie, plays on the eardrums with expert understanding of the emotional complexities held in the film.  And then you have the fantastic performances by the entire cast; most notably Harry Dean Stanton (such an emotionally rounded portrayal), Dean Stockwell (caring and confused and authentically so) and Nastassja Kinski (the way she shuffles emotions in a few mere moments is remarkable).  When you layer all of these elements atop one another you have one of the most gratifying films I've ever had the pleasure of seeing.

Just spellbinding.",1326067200,2,3081,4.696461824953445
3988426,1,B002U6DVPI,This would have been a good movie if it had about an hour cut. It drags and I thought it would never end. Lots of lose holes with no explanation.,1304985600,10,145,3.8666666666666667
3988427,5,B002U6DVPI,"I wouldn't recommend ""Paris, Texas"" as a blind buy but if you are a fan of the film this is the ultimate edition compared to the arid DVDs that have appeared before. If you've never seen the movie you may want to rent it first to see if it's to your taste; Wim Wenders' film blends European style filmmaking with an almost literary approach to a story about a man who mysteriously disappears and then, suddenly, pops up gradually resuming his old identity and life. It's a mystery without a conclusion that doesn't focus on the why or how but on the journey back to self discovery. As such, the deliberate pacing may not be to everyone's taste but if you can appreciate the film the performances are brilliant particularly Harry Dean Stanton who must play a man that contains all of his guilt, doubts and emotions. If you can appreciate the films of Terence Malick (""Badlands"", ""Days of Heaven"", ""The New World"" and ""The Thin Red Line"") you'll enjoy Wenders work which, at least superifically, has much in common with Malick's work.

""Paris, Texas"" comes across as the visual equivalent of a tone poem; Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) mysteriously shows up after 4 years in the desert. Travis would claim to remember nothing about his past if he would speak--everyone assumes he's mute until they are able to contact his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) who with his wife has been raising Travis' son Hunter (Hunter Carson) as his own. Travis has returned to rediscover his life and undo the past as best he can including locating his estranged wife Jane (Natassja Kinski)who disappeared sending Travis on his own lost journey into Hades.

Based on stories written by actor/playwright Sam Shepard, adapted by L. M. ""Kit"" Carson and directed by German director Wim Wenders (""Wings of Desire"", ""The American Friend"", ""Buena Vista Social Club"")""Paris, Texas"" makes the landscape as much a character as those we are following in the film. Having said that, this film is acquired taste with a pace more in keeping with later indie films (and, in fact, the feel of ""Paris, Texas"" has much in common with the films that Terence Malick made at the time and continues to make)--it's much more a mediative piece on the loss of self, memory and Travis' attempt to reclaim what is lost after trauma.

The Criterion edition features a stunning looking HD transfer (at one point you can see vultures circling over prey in the distance). There is a depth only hinted at on previous transfers, colors pop and the film has been scrubbed of flaws. Ry Cooder's marvelous score has never sounded so good with a rich sounding lossless presentation.
The special features (which are always a highlight of Criterion editions)are exceptional: we get excerpts from a 1990 documentary on Wenders featuring interviews with a wide variety of admirers and collaborators from Peter Falk to novelist Patricia Highsmith (who wrote ""The American Friend""); an interview with Wenders, new video interviews; a 1984 French TV special about Wenders' work; deleted scenes and super 8 home movies from the film are also included and we get a gallery of Wenders' scouting location photos. The original theatrical trailer is included plus we get an excellent audio commentary from Wenders, behind the scene photos and a booklet with critic Nick Roddick's essay on the film as well as vintage interviews with Shepard, Kinski, Stockwell.

For fans of ""Paris, Texas"" the Criterion edition is the standard on Blu-ray (and DVD). The film has never looked better nor has it ever received such a lovingly detailed history on its production. Highly recommended.",1292025600,14,3603,4.921052631578948

Wonderful photography of barren landscapes, and engaging characters who you want to win but the plot is idyllic: When Travis's loving relationship shatters Travis ""zones out"" mentally, spending the next four years mutely wandering and somehow surviving. Travis's wandering ends when he finally physically collapses and is reunited with his brother.

In 1984 I spent two months in Sudan teaching an engineering battalion how to operate rock crushing and asphalt mixing equipment that I had never paved with before, that I had design responsibilities in manufacturing crushing plants and vibratory compactors since 1979, but nothing I did became administrative routine in Africa.

A homeless and amnesiac Travis Henderson (Harry Dean Stanton) stumbles out of the desert and collapses. A local doctor examines Travis, calls a number he finds in the drifter's wallet. The number belongs to Travis' brother, Walt (Dean Stockwell). We learn from Walt that Travis has been missing for four years, during which time Walt and his wife Anne have been raising Travis' son, Hunter (Hunter Carson). Reunited with Hunter, Travis slowly emerges from his mental fog and attempts to connect with Hunter, who barely remembers him. Hunter better remembers his absent mother Jane (Nasstassja Kinski). The film then turns toward the mystery of what happened to Jane and what it has to do with Travis' strange disappearance, four years' earlier. Wenders' spins this story to Ry Cooder's scratching, haunting acoustic guitar riffs, against shimmering desert scenes.

8381098,5,B002U6DVPI,"There aren't many films that I'd consider to be idling near perfection, but I would say that about Paris, Texas. In fact, I would call this the best film of the 80s. And yes, I know that's saying a lot considering the movies that were released during that decade. A fantastic score by Ry Cooder, the unparalleled cinematography of Robby Muller, a heart wrenching script by the late-great Sam Shephard, and a beautifully understated performance by the late, legendary Harry Dean Stanton - all pulled together seamlessly by director Wim Wenders- makes this a movie to remember. Even the landscape of the the American southwest and southern California seem to come to life on screen.

The story follows Travis, a man who once had a family but then disappeared into the desert, as he reemerges years later and decides to right some of the wrongs he's responsible for. To say any more than that would spoil what are some of the most emotionally resonating moments ever put to film. Especially the dialogues between Harry Dean Stanton and Nastassja Kinski.
