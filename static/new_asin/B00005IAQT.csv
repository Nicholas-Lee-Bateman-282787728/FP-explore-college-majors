7938158,5,B00005IAQT,"Rather sweet somewhat unconventional romantic comedy set on one of the whitest beaches of the world on the Redang island of Malaysia. The first reviewer (see above) has a good summary of the story. Although the movie is entirely in Cantonese with English subtitles, it would loose much of its character if it were dubbed. Most songs are also nice.

My favorite part, however, is the photography which is unusually artistic with beautifully composed images, carefully selected colors and lighting putting the naturally beautiful island and the actors perfectly into scene.

If you have ever watched the old Marilyn Monroe/ Tony Curtis classic ""Some like it hot"" 24/7 in the original filming location at the Coronado Hotel in Coronado, California, then I suggest not buying this video, but going to spnd some time at the Laguna Resort on Redang Island. They show this movie 24/7 on the hotel room TVs as well - and you can check out the beach and water activities 1sthand, too...",1186704000,,977,4.915151515151515

richie ren and sammi cheng have great on-screen chemistry in this movie. Their characters clashed in just the right ways for the movie to work. A blockbuster hit in Hongkong when it came out, and definitely deserves a peek by audiences world-wide.",1130457600,,414,4.75
7938160,5,B00005IAQT,"I love this film and this is one of my favorite Sammi Cheng films! Sammi plays Summer, who is fired from her investment job and loses her boyfriend George on the same day, not to mention becoming broke due to a bad stock tip from her best friend, Daisy. Summer remembers helping a cousin of hers to buy some beachfront property in Malaysia the year before and realizes she can get herself back on track with the $3 million offered by a private developer to build a resort on the property. The catch is she only owns 1/2 the beach and has to convince her cousin to sell her his half. When she arrives in Malaysia she finds out that her cousin had sold his half of the beach to a charming local, who calls himself More More Tea (or Momocha), in order to settle his gambling debts. Summer then begins working on Momocha to convince him to sell him her half of the beach while he has no intention of selling. Sammi Cheng and Richie Ren have good on-screen chemistry and the beautiful scenery of Malaysia makes a lovely back-drop to the story. Overall this is one of the best romantic comedies I have seen in a long time and features a good soundtrack.  A real highlight is the song Sammi Cheng sings in the karaoke bar - don't miss it!!",1086048000,3,1232,4.310344827586207
7938161,5,B00005IAQT,"""Summer Holiday"" is a wonderful feel-good film.  It is a tale of the hate-love relationship between two people from different worlds - one a recently fired office worker from the city, and the other a hick who lives on a beach in Malaysia.  Summer wants only to sell the beach of which she owns half, but More More Tea owns the other half and has different plans for it.
The plot is decent, though the sub-plot with the sunken treasure pushes it a bit.  It seems the filmmakers only wanted to show off their underwater camera equipment, and the beauty of the Malaysian islands.  The acting is decent, and the dialogue is often hilarious, though typically mistranslated.  On top of everything, the scenery is magnificent, and the musical soundtrack is superb.  Even if you don't see this movie (though I highly recommend it), do NOT miss out on the soundtrack.  Sammi Cheng, who plays Summer, is a Hong Kong superstar with somewhere around 30 albums out.  Her karaoke performance of ""Kuai le bu kuai le"" is featured about halfway through, and is quite nice.
Thumbs up all around on this one.  ^_^",1011657600,4,1095,4.661458333333333
