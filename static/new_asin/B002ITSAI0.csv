3937073,5,B002ITSAI0,"Kevin Kline speaking French? Who knew! He gives a wonderful performance in ""Queen to Play"" and even made me appreciate the game of chess (which I am sad to say I don't play - but maybe will, now.)

Award-winning French actress Sandrine Bonnaire is someone I've watched in a couple of films in the past, but is remarkable in her role here. Jennifer Beals isn't a major player, but it's nice to see her included.

The scenery will make you long to visit the French countryside; brilliant cinematography! I highly recommend Queen to Play for anyone; it's a great date movie, too.",1310428800,19,576,4.637254901960785
3937074,5,B002ITSAI0,This is simply the best chess related film I have seen to date.  Its better than Searching for Bobby Fisher in my opinion.  Very well acted with a good story that can be appreciated by those who don't know a thing about chess.,1302048000,13,226,4.232558139534884
3937075,4,B002ITSAI0,"Viewed inflight on Turkish Airlines. Our heroine is an unfulfilled housewife/cleaner who becomes empowered through her discovery of chess. Intrigued by the game but without knowing how to play, she soon learns that the Queen is the most powerful piece. This discovery becomes a metaphor for her own self realisation as she perseveres to learn and takes on what is unfortunately still a male province ( most chess clubs such as mine in Guildford UK have few if any women members). Although chess is featured throughout the movie, knowledge of the game itself is not required of the viewer - although chess enthusiasts will immediately identify with magical as well as the cerebral and competetive nature of the game. This is a really nice film - and if it inspires anyone to take up the game itself, that would be great.",1274227200,49,819,4.815602836879433
3937076,5,B002ITSAI0,"I saw this film at the Palm Springs Film Festival and it is a wonderful interplay of human romantic emotions and inner ambition to escape the mundane, all evolving around the game of chess. The acting was superb and the scenery unique of the Mediterranean.",1263686400,20,256,4.711111111111111
3937077,4,B002ITSAI0,"This was a delightful movie that was engaging from beginning to end. I was amazed at how delightful Kevin Kline was and how well he speaks French. And speaking of French, at some point I realized that I barely needed the subtitles to follow what was going, this movie flowed so well and the emotions were right on point; you just get sucked in and then it is over and you have to shake yourself a little to bring yourself back into the ""real"" world.

I highly recommend this movie to anyone, even if you know nothing about Chess.",1427932800,,529,4.343434343434343
3937078,3,B002ITSAI0,Enjoyed the developing character of female lead as well as introduction of male lead.  Both story line and character development proceeded at nice pace.  Nothing spectacular about the movie but quite enjoyable perspective of how one newly acquired interest/skill can revolutionize one's life.,1426636800,,292,5.767441860465116
3937079,5,B002ITSAI0,"A delightful movie about self-discovery overcoming self-absorption, and the pain and joy of growing into your potential.  Kevin Kline plays a eccentric widower who hires a cleaning lady; the lady turns out to be obsessed with learning how to play the game of chess.  She had seen a romantic couple playing chess as she cleaned their room, and sought chess as an means to add a spark to her own emotionally dead marriage.  She asks Kline to teach her the game, which he does with increasing enthusiasm.  Her new obsession over chess threatens to disrupt her job and her marriage, but her perseverance pays off.",1426464000,,609,4.771428571428571

3937081,4,B002ITSAI0,"This is a good relationship movie about a woman discovering that she can do and be more than just a cleaning woman if she just lets herself dream  and then pursue her happiness.

On a side note, I was very impressed with Kevin Kline's performance, conducted entirely in French. His accent was very understandable. I definitely liked this movie.",1425945600,,344,4.813559322033898
3937082,5,B002ITSAI0,In this day and age of violence and gratuitous sex there are still movies like this one that manage to elevate themselves to excellence. Who would have thought that a film about chess can tell much about the human spirit!,1425945600,,221,4.55
3937083,5,B002ITSAI0,"If you like chess and enjoy French movies this is wonderful.  Kevin Kline (speaking French) acts as an American living in a small village on Corsica, when his maid asks him to teach her chess.  Great story!",1425686400,,206,4.54054054054054

3937091,4,B002ITSAI0,"I enjoyed this movie.  Quirky and heartfelt.  You're left sympathizing with the lead character, who needs an identity and empowerment of her own.",1424476800,,145,5.260869565217392

3937098,5,B002ITSAI0,"Superb acting, and not at all the predictable romantic comedy you might expect. Much more subtle than that. Kline is good but Bonnaire overshadows him--a stunning performance about a woman finding herself, under very unusual circumstances. Visually very beautiful too. Unlike most Hollywood films, a story about people you recognize, real people.",1421020800,,346,5.673076923076923
3937099,5,B002ITSAI0,"I really liked this movie.  Did not go the usual expectant route.  The script, directing and acting were excellent.  Will definitely recommend this one.",1420502400,,152,5.25
3937100,4,B002ITSAI0,"A beautiful redemption story, or maybe a flowering story, or maybe both {a rebirth for each of the leads}.  Powerfully yet subtly acted.",1420329600,,136,4.913043478260869

Set in the island of Corsica, this film is beautifully filmed in sun splashed days of shining seas, rich interiors and simple living.  I liked how the story unfolded and its resolution.  I have seen this film several times.",1418515200,,465,4.703703703703703

3937118,5,B002ITSAI0,"The movie Queen to Play does fool you at first into thinking it is all about sex but keep watching you will be pleasantly surprised. This movie is a wonderful portrayal of an older woman who can learn new things, and does!
Not only a woman but her whole family learns from her that we can all change for the better.

3937124,3,B002ITSAI0,French movies are notorious for giving you what you want at the beginning and then leaving you flat at the end. All that talk of the really big chess tournament she is working towards and they never show it. Kevin Kline's french is so good now that had I not seen him in anything else I would have thought he was born there.,1414195200,,324,4.158730158730159
3937125,2,B002ITSAI0,It was just okay.  Maybe because the video kept streaming I lost my interest in it.  It's difficult when the film keeps pausing.,1413849600,,128,4.521739130434782
3937126,5,B002ITSAI0,I loved this movie. acting was good and the story was interesting . even if you have no interest in chess or how it is played the storyline is still good.,1413590400,,154,4.0

unaccountable need to see beyond and above their current life and she uses Chess as the means to achieve that ambition...overcoming the few speed bumps on her road to success....her platonic relationship with her mentor is a pleasure to watch develop into mutual understanding and respect...this is a family and a date movie which anyone who views it will want to own....22 years ago Julie Walters & Michael Kane made a very similar movie...""Educating Rita""  with a hair dresser in England wanting to accomplish something for a better outlook on the things around her  her mentor is a burned-out college prof and alcoholic is assigned to teach her classic literature....both grow and benefit from their experience together [again no sex or violence] unusual for Hollywood but it may have made in England.  same story arc of a successful journey to a better life/style.....in both DVDs neither of the women lose their original identity, they simply become ""Better""",1413072000,,1644,5.059040590405904

3937131,5,B002ITSAI0,Eloquent character study and thematic exploration of the power of choice in relationships and the changing nature of love as affected by age and the vissicitudes of fate. The character interplay is fueled by the gravitas of the leading actor and actress without losing the subtle but potent emotional touchstones explored by the supporting cast. The beauty and expositive power of the French language is made clear as I suspect the film if performed in English would lose the emotional intensity that makes this film a stand out.,1412985600,,529,5.0227272727272725

3937153,4,B002ITSAI0,"There are cookie cutter beauties that Hollywood produces and then there are true beauties like Sandrine Bonnaire.  The most incredulous scene in the entire movie was the one in which her husband rejected her in bed.  Oh sure, like that would ever happen in real life?  The man would have to be stupid and I doubt she would have married someone stupid?  Hmmmwell, thats a little extreme, because many women have married a handsome, idiot biker boy who treats them like dirt.  Nevertheless, interesting plot and very good acting, even by Kevin Kline.",1402444800,,548,4.849462365591398
3937154,4,B002ITSAI0,"The other reviews did a good job covering the story. A couple, with a snotty teen, working all the time, husband has his friends, but the wife mainly just works for living and family...and no one seems to KNOW her, even herself. They all seem to sell themselves short, but especially her. She is attractive, but can't even get attention from her husband. It is as if she has no worth, even to herself.

Then she sees someone that is happy, and an ache is born in her to be happy also. Not the kind of ache where you try to find yourself with another lover, just a desire for something more. She tries to interest her husband. He does not see her. She had seen the couple enjoying themselves playing chess, and the game had seemed intriguing. She desires to know more about it.

She buys a chess set. She tries to get her husband to play with her. He scorns her desire, and puts her down for trying. The set has a computer to play against...she probably guessed from experience her husband would not play with her...and she learns chess. Pretty soon she is doing better than the computer. A man she cleans for has a chess set out all the time. She asks him to play with her.

He scorns her. She is JUST the maid. To show her that she is JUST the maid and not good enough...and He IS... he agrees to just ONE game.  She challenges him as he as not been challenged in a long while...and the story is off and running. As she discovers she IS intelligent, and others think so...she also discovers what makes life worth living, what makes life fun...",1402444800,,1544,4.313793103448276

The acting is outstanding... Helene and Dr. Kroger... a well deserved change for both of them.

No soundtrack is available... I wonder why because the music is fantastic... Anybody now where I can look for it?  Especially the dance of Helene and her daughter.

3937157,5,B002ITSAI0,"Not a comedy, rather a deeply moving story about a chamber maid with a gift for chess. You don't need to know chess to enjoy this film, but if you have played in chess tournaments you will enjoy an extra dimension of recollection. Recommended for everyone.",1401148800,,256,4.586956521739131

I particularly enjoyed Kevin Kline (speaking French) as a gruff enigmatic American widower curmudgeon who begins to feel again as the main character blossoms under his tutelage.  Feel good ending is a bit too pat and I would've liked to see just one shot of Helene returning from work on her bicycle as the oft depicted scenic ride to work is a MAJOR downhill on a moutainous road..",1400284800,,589,4.4953271028037385

3937162,4,B002ITSAI0,"Although the lessons of this film go beyond a woman's empowerment, the basic story is just that.  If you have absolutely no familiarity with chess, parts of this story may not make sense and the difficulties of the woman's struggles won't have much context.  If you have tried your hand at chess, you will have a greater appreciation.  Those very familiar with the game will have a difficult time believing the woman's rapid skill development.

He performed well and worked very well with French actress Sandrine Bonnaire.

It was a simple story but because the good script and two good performers the movie showed so many exquisite details that reminded us things happened in real life.

French actress Sandrine Bonnaire played leading role Helene who was a hotel chambermaid but by the end of movie she became a confident chess player. Bonnaire performed very naturally, she was so good that I believed she wass Helene.

3937217,5,B002ITSAI0,"Caroline Bottaro's ""Queen to Play"" is a charming, inspiring film about confounding the world's expectations and getting a second chance in life. Helene (Sandrine Bonnaire) is a cleaning woman on the island of Corsica, living a quiet, contented life with her boat-painter husband and teenage daughter. Then, one day, she sees an elegant couple playing chess at the hotel where she works, and something deep inside her clicks. Although she has never played chess before, she suddenly becomes obsessed with the game, playing an electronic chessboard far into the night. She even asks Professor Kroger (Kevin Kline), the curmudgeonly academic whose house she cleans for extra money, to pay her with chess lessons instead.

""Queen to Play"" reminded me of the original Japanese version of ""Shall We Dance?,"" about a Japanese salary man whose life is transformed by ballroom dancing. In both movies, just one glance is enough to change a life completely, and for the better. In the making-of featurette on this DVD, Bottaro describes Helene's story as one of class conflict; that is certainly plain when the president of the chess club whose tournament Helene tries to enter suggests that she clean his house instead. But it could just as easily be seen as a woman's struggle in a male-dominated world. When Helene starts spending more time with Professor Kroger and her demeanor changes at work, everyone--including Helene's husband--comes to the usual, and dreary, conclusion.

""Queen to Play"" is a touching story about the flowering of an intellect and the empowerment of a working-class woman who leaps over society's expectations to fulfill her dreams. Kevin Kline is persuasively ursine as the professor, and the rest of the cast is fine, but it is Bonnaire who dominates the movie with a moving performance as a woman discovering resources within herself that she didn't even know she had.

Graced with jaw-droppingly gorgeous photography of the Corsican coastline, ""Queen to Play"" is a must-see.",1368489600,2,1996,5.173374613003096

3937235,4,B002ITSAI0,"""Queen to Play"" is a sweet, small, powerful film about a cleaning woman's discovery of passion and dignity through chess. Sandrine Bonnaire plays Helene, a 40 something cleaning woman on the tourist island of Corsica. She's got a nice, handsome, construction worker husband, a snotty teenage daughter struggling through growing pains, an imperious boss at a resort hotel, and a quiet, reasonable, low-rent life.

One day Helene picks up the game of chess, and everything changes. Chess engages her mind and passion. For the sake of learning more about the game, she does things she never would have done, otherwise. She asks a man she cleans for, Dr. Kroger (Kevin Kline) to play with her. The grouchy older man rebuffs her at first, but she offers to clean for free, and he accepts. ""Do you always look at people as if your life depended on their answer to your question?"" Dr. Kroger asks her.

In fact Helene's life does depend on her newfound passion for chess. Helene demands time to learn about the game. She is distracted in conversations were before she might have listened more sympathetically or joined in petty, local gossip. She schedules hours alone with a man. She answers back to demanding customers at the resort. She snaps at her family, ""Would it kill you to cook your own dinner for one night?"" Just who does Helene think she is? She is, after all, only a cleaning woman, the chess club president reminds her. His arrogance will not serve him well when he butts up against Helene.

""Queen to Play"" is a small film. The script is spare. The film is lovely but not spectacular. Sandrine Bonnaire's great beauty and her performance are its best special effect. I wish there had been a bit more depth and development. But what is here is really powerful. We've gotten so used, in the US, to thinking of injustice and prejudice as being, primarily, about black versus white. ""Queen to Play"" shows how being a cleaning woman is itself a handicap in society, how expectations can squash a human being, and the price people pay for even the most simple gesture of coloring outside the lines of others' expectations. I admire and like Helene as I do few other film heroines. And I'd love to see Bonnaire play a saint someday. Her face is made for it.",1359331200,2,2259,4.685138539042821
3937236,5,B002ITSAI0,"Excellent motion picture with great acting. Superbly produced with a great cast. The plot/storyline is easy to follow such that even the English subtitles were not a problem (the movie has a French audio track). The film is more about relationships and the role chess might be perceived to play in that than it is about the game itself.

It is a refreshing and imaginative film with no profanity, violence or sexually suggestive scenes. What a novel concept. The film was produced on the untainted island of Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea and provides a perfect setting for this charming film. If you don't play chess you might be drawn to try it just as our heroine did in the film.
Queen To Play was an unexpected treat. Enjoy.",1359244800,3,731,4.666666666666667

3937243,5,B002ITSAI0,"We watched this movie last night but didn't initially realize it was going to be mostly in French. When we discovered it would we debated briefly if we should continue to watch it and decided to give it a chance. Almost immediately my wife got interested and soon after I did too and we both found ourselves thoroughly entranced by this gem.

The story unfolds gradually and one finds a developing interest and concern for the main character, a maid, named Helene who discovers the game of chess and begins to develop an interest in learning the game. The role of Helene is played by Sandrine Bonnaire, a name with which neither of us was familiar; we discovered later that she is a celebrated actress in France and now we can see why.

She portrays a middle age woman who is strong, yet vulnerable, smart, yet humble and a completely compelling character for whom the viewer quickly develops a sympathy and concern. As her interest in chess grows she realizes that one of the individuals for whom she cleans seems to have an interest in the game. This man, a widower named Dr. Kroger, agrees to help her learn the game and learn it she does.

The supporting roles are all well done. It was interesting to see so many new faces; the only one we recognized was Kevin Kline. The others, including Sandrine Bonnaire's were all new to us. We watch a lot of English mystery and drama and eventually one grows ""accustomed to their faces."" These were all new to us and highly competent in their roles. We appreciated the subtle touches of facial expressions which, in some scenes, told so much about the character's thoughts.

The story pacing is never rushed but always captivating to watch. The language barrier is overcome by subtitles in English which is easy to follow. Watching subtitles is sometimes even required while we are watching some English language movies where the particular English accent is virtually unintelligible to American ears.

On a final note, the scenery is lovely and makes a significant contribution to the film.

This is an excellent family movie and I recommend it highly for older teens and adults.",1341273600,3,2125,4.72972972972973
3937244,4,B002ITSAI0,"This movie, shot in Corsica, tells the story of a hotel chambermaid and house cleaner who falls in love with the game of chess and uses that passion to lift her life out of the ordinary. The acting is good, the scenery brilliant and the story, though not very deep, delivers in the great tradition of ""Rocky"" and ""Chariots of Fire.""

I was also impressed by Kevin Kline's command of French and the restrained performance he gives as the heroine's chess tutor and mentor.

Sandrine Bonnaire is a very expressive actress. She plays Helene, a working class woman, wife of Ange and mother of a moody teenage daughter. Helene catches sight of a couple playing chess on the hotel veranda. They are locked in a sexy battle (won by the woman) which intrigues Helene and she soon becomes obsessed by the game -- and discovers she has a rare gift for it.

The movie avoids several traps. Helene and the Kevin Kline character do not have an affair; the Kline characters, it is hinted, is suffering from some illness but the movie does not inflict a ""Camille-style"" death scene on us; and Helene's husband, although puzzled and threatened by her newfound passion for chess, does not blow up the marriage.

In the end, this is a movie about a woman living a boring, unfulfilled existence, who discovers something she loves and is good at and seizes the opportunity to give meaning to her life. The queen, she discovers, is the most powerful piece on the chessboard.

This is a feelgood movie. You don't need to know anything about chess to enjoy it. You just have to suspend your disbelief and get into a ""once upon a time"" mood.",1336608000,4,1616,4.597222222222222
3937245,4,B002ITSAI0,"This is a pleasurable film to watch.  I don't play chess, and my husband does, and this movie made me want to make the effort to learn.  I always enjoy movies where an individual finds out something unexpected about themselves that adds another dimension to their personality and life, along the lines of The Visitor and I am sure countless other films.  Many times they have given themselves over to a somewhat monotonous, and dutiful existence, and did not realize the level of dissatisfaction they actually had with their lives.  Now this is my personal opinion, but the way the main character handled her new interest in chess with regard to her husband and child was not particularly proper, but I know things are done for the sake of film drama and humans don't necessarily make the best decisions when they are trying to figure themselves out.  Either way though, anyone who takes the time to watch this film will be pleased, I think.",1335830400,,941,4.713414634146342

3937251,5,B002ITSAI0,"SPOILER ALERT:
Great film... Who knew Kevin Kline could speak French? This film
reminded me a little of another one of my favorite films- namely ""A
Brief Vacation"" because both films capture the loneliness of menial
work and of not being understood by one's husband. In all fairness, in
this movie, the husband tries, however.

The scenes of Corsica are intoxicating. The story unfolds beautifully -
even though some degree of willing suspension of disbelief is required.
The film captures the chess world (male dominated, intimidating, turned
inward) well although it is not credible that the protagonist could
become so good playing against only one opponent and a mechanical chess
set...

The film is ultimately quietly empowering. Bonnaire is a terrific
actress. Watching her assimilate what she sees and make the chess moves
of her life in an effort to achieve her dream is wonderful.

Thankfully, the film leaves many key questions for the viewer to
contemplate after the final credits have rolled by. This film resonates
and lingers.",1318204800,5,1040,5.1420118343195265
3937252,5,B002ITSAI0,"An inspiring chess movie because the democratic essence of the game prevails even when overcoming such obstacles as gender and class bias. But too, the story is as much about battles of all kinds as it is about chess.

We find in this film that a cleaning women's life changes because she says, ""I exist, too. I have an interest. I will work at it because it matters to me."" She learns, as we all do, that if you take a risk you may lose, but if you do not take risks you will lose.

Beautiful and subtle, yet appropriate, soundtrack and cinematography. Dialogue simple yet profound. Acting - spot on.

Again, foreign studios seem to be outclassing LA and NY - not even close. Well, OK, we have bigger CGI effects' computers and budgets.",1316131200,13,737,4.444444444444445
3937253,5,B002ITSAI0,"Chess is one of the stars of this lovely little movie, but Sandrine Bonnaire's Helene steals the spotlight from Mme. Chess. You simply can't take your eyes off her.  Kevin Kline is a possibly dying chess expert who reluctantly tutors his femme du menage (maid) Helene in the intricacies of the game.  The subtleties and development of their relationship are exquisitely portrayed, as is the arc of resentment, acceptance and eventual pride of Helene's husband Ange and daughter Lisa.

This is simply a wonderful movie. This is not only a chess story, it's a Pygmalion as well.  It's typically French in that all the loose ends aren't tied up.  We don't know, for example, what's wrong with Dr. Kroger's health, nor if Helene's colleague at the hotel marries her fiance and has four children.  That's OK.  The story that's there is perfection and it's not necessary to know chess to love it.  Just watch Helene's face as she puzzles out a move.  ""That's the work,"" says Dr. Kroger when she complains it's too hard.  Yes it is, and such a perfect little parable of life.",1315872000,12,1068,4.724324324324324

3937256,4,B002ITSAI0,"I like films where the main character experiences a self awakening. My guess is a lot of Americans (particularly now) feel like they're just plugged into the wall. They grind it out day to day and look for whatever little time they can to find some peaceful corner to do something that means something to them. This is one of those films.

Sandrine Bonnaire and her husband live, with their teenage daughter, on an Island off of the French mainland. They are both laborers. They eke out a living but not much more. While working as a maid in a hotel, she sees a young, in love, couple absorbed in a game of chess. It somehow captures her imagination and she convinces a local doctor (Kevin Klein) to teach her to play. This leads to her personal adventure.

This is a heck of a movie. Kevin Klein does his usual good job but this movie belongs to Sandrine. She is great. Her face runs through so many subtle expressions throughout the film that I was simply riveted. During much of what happens she wears a weary, worried look. It's as though she's always waiting for the other shoe to drop. As she becomes more absorbed in chess, and you see her crack a smile now and again, the sun comes out. The way her relationships change wither her daughter, husband and the doctor is also something to behold. Hollywood would have done this but it probably would not have been as subtle. Then there's the tournament. I found it to be handled in a mature fashion. This could have been too overwrought in the hands of a lesser director. Much of this movie thrives on that same understatement.

I do wonder how much this movie was trimmed. I have a feeling there were many more scenes with her and her girlfriends. And one scene with Klein looked to have been edited with a machete. The jump in the action was so jarring it freaked me. But these are minor quibbles compared to how good it is overall. If you're into this sort of thing you couldn't do much better.",1313625600,43,1951,4.428969359331476

It's been more than 6 years since I started admiring Sandrine Bonnaire. Then it grew stronger when I saw this and her movie about her sister Sabine. When I saw the first trailer, I didn't understand it at that time. Now I'm able to translate and understand some more. Sometimes whenever I look at this, I kept on thinking about the time when I met Kevin as an early birthday present. During a Q & A session, he mentioned about how bad he was at chess and predicting moves. I thought about an interview and this movie came out of my head. I raised my hand high and I shouted out, ""I know Queen to Play."" Then my mum and I briefly explained how well we knew about Queen to Play. Kevin had his hand against his left ear and asked ""Comment?"" Then we went on telling him that I loved the movie and everything. Most people would often ask ""He spoke French in a foreign language movie?"" Heck, he's even old enough to be my grandpa. This movie, Osama and Her Name is Sabine are the only foreign language movies I would prefer to watch.  All the others in my opinion are basically adult and they often show me stuff that don't seem to appeal to me much. When it comes to learning a language by watching a movie or TV show, I always go and buy region 2 DVD's of my favorite movies for both kids and adults. I would go off to find such movies like Little Mermaid, Lion King, Big Chill, Wreck it Ralph, Night at the Museum, etc. Instead of wasting time reading subtitles, I would select the language and have the dialogue speak to me.
