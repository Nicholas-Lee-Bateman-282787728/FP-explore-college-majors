2558661,5,B000FBDX62,"The first movie was very poor.  I feel that no good comes from caracter assanation by people who were not present and get all their information second hand.
The second movie was a real winner.  While it lacked realism in many places it was clean, interesting, well acted, and the actors fit their parts very well.  Its a shame to pair it up with the first mvie.",1370995200,5,361,4.358208955223881

2558664,5,B000FBDX62,"I've been wanting these classics for some time now, but they have been too expensive singlely. This is a great deal. Stagecoach is a classic with multiple star personalities----a  ""must have"" for any quality collection.",1361491200,3,219,5.257142857142857
2558665,1,B000FBDX62,"Stacy Keach as Doc Holliday?  Come in.  The prologue to this movie states "" this is the way it happened.""  In an Alternate Universe, perhaps.  This movie is tripe, even by Hollywood standards.  Not even amusing or interesting tripe.  Just tripe.",1478131200,2,245,4.853658536585366

2558686,1,B000FBDX62,"Stagecoach isn't the classic as  JOHN WAYNE'S Original,STAGCOACH. The remake is more of a custume movie. I just like Johnny Cash. He's great. The rest of this movie is so-so.  Doc...really isn't to bad. Stacy Keach is very good.",1420588800,2,228,4.82051282051282

2558694,3,B000FBDX62,The movie Stagecoach was great. Too bad it had to be on same disk as Doc which was awful. Doc was not very historical and the acting was terrible.,1399420800,6,146,4.068965517241379
2558695,2,B000FBDX62,"Second movie will not play! I only wanted ""Stagecoach"" which sold alone is very costly. ""Doc"" plays fine...it's a mediocre offering but...I'm sending it back.",1397952000,,158,5.36

2558701,5,B000FBDX62,"i have really enjoyed watching this remake of the john wayne classic stagecoach. yes it is different in some ways then the orginal but to me it is better. i love seeing all the greats together, johnny, willie, kris, and waylen. willie is is awesome self as he always is in playing the westerns. he was born to play in them. getting the movie doc was only an extra perk. i had bought just the movie stagecoach about 3 years ago and paid three times more then i did for this two movie set. sadly we have lost some of the greats of country music and in these movies they still live on for us to enjoy. if your looking for it to be a copy of the john wayne orginal, you will be disappointed. if you want to see the greats live again, and can live with some changes to the orginal you won't be disappointed in this one.",1388793600,5,814,4.09375
