8758437,3,B01EG1R9W0,"I liked it. Good production value, unique story, great orchestral score by the late great Terry Plumeri. Hit in miss in places but quite a bit better than some of the other reviews led me to believe.",1477699200,,199,4.405405405405405
8758438,1,B01EG1R9W0,"9/10 times, I love silly cheesy horror comedies, but this was just awful. It was extremely low budget, and the acting was terrible. I don't even know what the storyline was. 10 minutes in, and I was already fast-forwarding. I've always been intrigued by seeing a zombie western, but please do yourself a favor and skip it. I hope 'Dead 7' is better. I would NOT recommend WALKING DEAD IN THE WEST!!!",1475971200,,399,4.555555555555555

8758440,1,B01EG1R9W0,"A man who claims he didn't commit all the crimes he is accused of, is hung. But before that happens he asks God for a sign of his innocence which causes a lightning bolt...but he is hung anyway. The next thing you know there is a zombie apocalypse. The cause and effect needed some work.

A group of people of the town of Crumpit, Arizona (April 1876) hold up in the Double Peach Saloon (one without swinging doors and modern hinges) and that is it for much of the film which includes a boring Marshal monologue from director Paul Walker. Apparently no one had else could read lines better. The acting was horrible. The zombies made noise from a barking to a pirate aargh. The dialogue was boring and they insisted on having quiet sit down scenes. Sam Keller who played Deputy Clem bordered on camp in his performance and made me wonder if this was supposed to be a comedy. The opening gun fight needed choreography. I don't know why the bad guy stands there holding a gun, watching the sheriff kill the whole gang before he starts to fire, and then miss on multiple occasions from 10 feet away.
