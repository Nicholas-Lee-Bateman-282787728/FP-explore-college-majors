8355657,4,B00284BVG8,"The Rocheleau/Dameron/Dodd team is back with a sophomore attempt that is both tighter and more amorphous than its predecessor,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undefined/dp/B0028RXZWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undefined</a>.  Here, the camerawork is truly breath-taking, sweeping across islands and ideas in brilliant 35mm that puts High Definition video to shame.  Both the story and audio track are similarly tight, so restrained and calculated as to weigh each second of this film with heavy purposefulness.

And yet, the meaning of this film is perhaps even more elusive and provocative than in Undefined.  What is the tide really carrying along in that little boat?  Who is the castaway, and what are his intentions toward the young girl?  I'd always seen this film as a commentary on an isolating and empty society that finds temporary escape in perverting innocence, but the editorial review included above would seem to contradict much of this, envisioning ""Hal"" as an everyman.  Make what you will of this film.  The gorgeous visuals, the provocative audio, the sparse action, and the horrifying conclusion will transform and bewilder, regardless of whatever meaning you apply to the experience.

Though this is not normally my style, I do feel it necessary to comment on the price of this DVD.  $12.95 for a 10 minute independent film may strike you as absurd at first.  However, when one considers the fact that you can't pick up this film through Netflix or Blockbuster (in fact the only other way to see it is by catching it on the film festival circuit), as well as the extreme weight and artfulness pumped into every second of this film, the price becomes less relevant.  This is a film that deserves to be seen, and this is the only way for most of us to see it. Once one realizes this, then deciding to make the purchase is easier and more inevitable than a tide carrying a toy boat to a distant shore.",1243209600,,1962,5.1545741324921135
