8422345,1,B000H2NH38,"I have finished reviewing and learning(?) from this tutorial. I did not learn much and it is my humble opinion that this product is overpriced. There is one procedure she mentioned that troubled me very much. That is that a technician can go over a line as much as 12 times. Ouch! WRONG. Don't go over two times. Three max. This particular procedure is not recommended as you can and will butcher the client.
Before and after pictures were not available for comparison. Finished job details were not taken closeup so the student or learner can take note of. Some cautionary and informative notes were completely erronious and misleading (She said no more than one eyeliner line. I say two colors and two lines are very popular in my area of residence). Improper stretching of skin was demonstrated. Notice how ink dripped inside her eyeball.
I do not recommend this video because it is not much informative for the hefty price tag.",1248393600,3,931,4.753086419753086
8422346,5,B000H2NH38,"I have read all of Debbie's books and seen all of her DVD's and I currently use her products. This DVD answered many questions that I had on my permanent make up procedures. How to measure, sizes of the needles she uses and the steps for start to finish on eyebrows, eyeliner and lips!!! Plus it seems really professionally done. I would recomend this DVD to anyone!!",1246579200,,367,4.492537313432836
8422347,2,B000H2NH38,I think this was over priced for the video this woman put together. It didn't talk about a lot of important things like the sizes and types of needles that were used. It was not very well done at all.,1219449600,3,200,4.025
