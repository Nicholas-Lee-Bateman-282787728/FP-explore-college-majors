1938422,5,B0000JCFO0,"Warning, this is a frank and honest review of this movie; and even though I am slightly biased, as a Shannen Doherty fan, I intend to be as honest as possible for the benefit of other customers.

This is one of a string of B-movies Shannen Doherty has recently filmed in Canada, the others being 'Striking Poses' and 'Another Day'.  In 'The Rendering', Shannen Doherty plays a young artist named Sarah, who gets stabbed by a lunatic named Theodore, played by Peter Outerbridge.  10 years later, Theodore's ready to get out of the slammer, and blackmails Sarah into speaking well of him at his parole hearing.  He's framed her husband, Michael, to get him into jail, where Theodore supposedly runs the show, and can have Michael killed at his will.  As soon as he gets out, the story begins...

Admittedly, the storyline does sound unlikely.  However, it works, it makes you think, and provides for a decent two hours of entertainment.  Shannen Doherty does an excellent job with her character (although it seems that she tends to play the same character in all her B-movies) and develops her well.  I've always enjoyed her acting; those unbelievers who claim she's a horrible actress need only watch this movie, and watch any episode of 'Charmed' or 'North Shore' to see her talent.  She might not be Meryl Streep, but if you put her up against Hilary Duff or Paris Hilton (ugghh), she's the greatest actress to have ever lived.  Peter Outerbridge does a terrific job as well; he plays a believable psychopath and contributes well to the suspense of the film.  I wasn't all that pleased with John Brennan as Michael, but I do admit that he is a very good actor.

What would I have changed about the movie?  Perhaps, perhaps, Shannen's job as an interior designer 10 years later.  It's okay, she acts the job out well, and it seems like something Shannen could be doing, but somehow that job doesn't fit into the movie properly -- it seems like it exists just to give Shannen a job.  It doesn't tie into the storyline of the movie at all.

However, this was a very minor glitch.  All in all 'The Rendering' is a great movie, with a terrific cast that seems almost wasted as a B-TV-movie.  Is it worth the approximately $20?  If you're a Shannen fan, yes.  If you're bored with nothing to do, and feel like watching a suspense film, it's probably a rental.",1105056000,27,2354,4.610576923076923

8002299,3,B0000JCFO0,"The Rendering is a low budget Canadian made for TV movie with all of the usual problems that go with such a production. Slow pacing, improbable situations and an almost phoned-in performance from Shannen Doherty and a weak soundtrack plague what could have been a much more interesting film with someone with more acting chops like Sarah Michelle Gellar.

Still, there are moments in the film that make you keep watching. Peter Outerbridge, playing Shannen's attacker has the bad guy persona down to a science here and you just can't help loving to hate him. You just can't wait till the predictable finale when Shannen's character Sara nails him (quite literally, and I'm not talking about sex)

One thing I can't forget to mention are the fight scenes. There is a moment of desperation where in prison, Sara's husband uses something to spray into an attacker's eyes, effectively labeling him the most lame and worst prison fighter ever put on film. The finale fight with Sara, hubby and baddie has so many inexplicably stupid moments, that if it weren't for Sara's last action, it would have been a comedic finale instead of a serious one. Really, except for the final action, I've seen better fighting choreography and timing from the three stooges.

If you're looking for a thriller you haven't seen before and nothing else suits you, give The Rendering a watch. In spite of it's pitfalls, it does deliver some engaging content.",1407542400,,1432,4.88477366255144
8002300,5,B0000JCFO0,This movie will keep your attention. The movie goes through many different situations but as you watch it looks the same but it isn't.  As always Shannen Doherty is a good actress.,1400544000,,180,4.625
8002301,2,B0000JCFO0,"Sarah (Shannen Doherty) an artist is attacked in the first scene. The attacker (Peter Outerbridge) is put away. 10 years later her husband Michael (John H. Brennan) is accused of murder. As Michael rots in the same prison as her attacker awaiting trial, Sarah works to find the real killer and must help get her attacker out of jail to keep her husband from getting killed in prison.

I was bored with the film as moving the husband to a separate cell in a different facility would have solved the whole problem. The film has a made for TV sound track and credits. There was also a certain lameness to the overall production. Fans of Lifetime films might enjoy this one.

Parental guide: No F-bombs, couple in bed with a minor grope. Near stripper nudity. Attempted rape.",1386979200,,771,4.62043795620438
8002302,5,B0000JCFO0,"One of a classic worth owning and having in your collection. Fabulous acting from cast with a great storyline. Thrills by the minute and suspense through the roof, unpredictable not knowing what's next making it sit on the edge entertainment.  Why tell you everything about it and spoil the unexpected in a fantastic movie. Shannon Doherty plays her part to a tee and if you have seen her in other shows than know you won't be disappointed. So what are you waiting for, collect your popcorn and chips relax put your feet up to a grand night of marvelous entertainment. Enjoy!",1385078400,,575,4.693069306930693
