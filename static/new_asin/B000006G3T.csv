1193347,5,B000006G3T,"I have to start out by saying, when I first saw the nesting it was transfer from a VHS and I really did not like the  movie. Fast forward to present time I saw blue underground was going to releasing it, surprised blue underground put time and effort into a new release and not wasting their time releasing everything they have already released on blue ray, with that said I like blue undergrounds work and I decided to give the movie a second try and I really enjoyed the movie, it's not a bloody or gory movie per say, but it does have its moments and it will not dissapoint (go into the movie with an open mind  Another thing I really appreciated about this movie is that the story is really good, and it does not drag along like the majority of horror movies.  Blue Underground did a hell of a job with this release and it would be nice to start seeing them put more effort into aquiring new titles, hopefully a offical announcement comes soon that they are releasing Joe Zito's Bloodrage.",1317513600,3,993,4.356756756756757

1193349,3,B000006G3T,"For a person suffering from agoraphobia, the lead character, Lauren Cochran (played by Robin Groves) sure got around!  Since the plot never really took full advantage of that, realistically speaking, I can't figure out why it was mentioned so often and used so little.  She was literally running all over the place!  And, it wasn't the least bit interesting.  As horror movies go (and this one really didn't), you need to stay focused, on target.  Pick a plot point and run with it, not just run!
The premise was almost too basic: a writer rents a house to write in and soon discovers it's haunted and that she might have some kind of connection to it.  The owner of the house is an old geezer with a secret (the always dependable John Carradine).  To round out the cast there are scads of local creepy people (all connected to THE secret), a nondescript boyfriend, and a rather snotty therapist.  This isn't counting all the ghosts.  The deaths are few and far between but rather well done (I especially love the sickle scene).  I also liked some of the weird dream sequences.  My only major complaint has to do with the casting of Robin Groves as the writer who never gets around to writing.  She is thoroughly unsympathetic, I found her more annoying than likable.  When you can't care about what the main character is suffering through, that doesn't leave much to hold your interest.  It also didn't help that the pacing is a bit slow and the movie is too long.",1309564800,12,1465,4.584615384615384
1193350,4,B000006G3T,"THE NESTING Concerns an agoraphobic novelist (Robin Groves) who moves into a house that just might be haunted. Along the way, we are introduced to the impatient therapist, the ultra-goofy boyfriend, the cranky handyman, and an extremely nasty man named Abner (!). Thankfully, most of these jerks are subjected to horrible deaths at the hands of supernatural forces! This is a horror / thriller along the lines of THE SHINING, THE SENTINEL, BURNT OFFERINGS, etc., and has a solid story w/ a nice, twisty ending. Enjoy...",1282348800,8,519,5.046511627906977

1193352,2,B000006G3T,"And not a very good at that. At least not in the traditional sense. The acting is all right, and the story is okay, but I figured out the ending rather quickly, and I just didn't find it very scary, to tell you the truth. But it's supposed to be a cult favorite, so I suppose all horror film enthusiasts should watch it. Horror, like the man said, is in the eye of the beholder.",1095984000,2,378,4.053333333333334
1193353,4,B000006G3T,"Another horror-movie? Why, we've seen a million of these and they're basicly all the same, concentrating on confusing and grotesque death-scenes  and a plot that reeks to hell with none of the important questions  answered.
Not this one, I assure you.
 The Nesting has some  death-scenes (ofcourse, it's still a horror-flick) but they're gripping and  intense. The plot is confusing from time to time, leaving the viewer  wondering and aching to discover the truth. In the end you get it all, the  whole thing, and everything falls into place.
 Although some of the  actors don't really seem to do their best with their characters, leaving  them flat and hollow, the star of this movie (Robin Groves) really goes for  the kill (figure of speech). She's great!
 For me, this one goes to the  shelf of classic golden-oldies. See it, and you've seen one of the best  ghost-stories since the coming of film.",967420800,9,903,4.855263157894737
1193364,2,B000006G3T,I would barely classify this as horror. It's a thriller at best but there's very little tension throughout the film. There are much better blu ray releases of 70's films that are worth your time and money.,1438560000,,205,4.5675675675675675

1193366,2,B000006G3T,"A tightly wound fiction writer with more issues than Vogue figures that moving into an abandoned mansion in the middle of the woods will help her write. Little does she know that a horrible crime took place in the old mansion many years ago, one that left several ""women of the night"" dead. Our anxiety-ridden hero faces one problem after another, from rotting wood floors, to secretive locals, to a particularly nasty redneck, all the while dealing with the various ghosts of prostitutes that haunt the old house. Turns out, the vengeful ghosts want something, and our main character figures greatly in their plans. Overall this is not a good movie. The idea of hooker ghosts haunting an old brothel is a cool one, especially for the early 80s. But it's just bungled with a bad, cliched script, miscasting, lousy pacing, amateurish acting, etc.",1412294400,,845,4.875

1193368,5,B000006G3T,"This is a really good film, despite the reviewer that made weak points out of mole hills.  If you're the type of viewer who needs the film to actually scrawl the date and time at the beginning of each scene, this film is not for you.  Time passes, which is why one reviewer complained about the lead's agoraphobia--we see her struggling with it, then ""suddenly"" cured, then suffering with it again, and all for very good plot-driven reasons and spread over a period of time.

I saw this film clandestinely as a kid.  The film has several gotcha moments where even though I knew what was coming, it still startled me into  jumping--sign of a grade A thriller.  The film has atmosphere--one moment ordinary life is going on, the next the world has become eerie and threatening.

All in all, this film is certainly worth inclusion in your horror/suspense collection.",1409616000,,863,4.713333333333333
1193369,2,B000006G3T,"Preamble . I've upped my walking schedule to 6 days a week (an hour per walk) in addition to work , choirs , shopping , house cleaning and animal tending (two beautiful cats) , etc . I was a bit tired today , however....
That did not made a damn bit of difference in my review of this , inexplicably , customer well regarded turkey . This is a REALLY ridiculous horror film . This coming , as it is , from a REAL horror enthusiast .
There comes a point in some horror pictures , wherein often much forgiving on the viewer's part is required , when one fails to give even the slightest bit of a hoot about the central character . Let alone the remainder of the cast  . Said point comes well before the mid mark in this stinker . After a Psych Doctor friend of many years has died abruptly after arriving to aid our damsel in distress and another fellow has attempted rape , we determine that , evidently , tomorrow's another day for said lass . Both incidents occur a couple/several days apart and are rejoined by many other peculiar and disturbing events . Does our lady in peril have an urge to flee ? Better ask a difficult and surly local if ""The house is haunted"" first .
Not so bad it's good . Almost but no cigar . Blessed with a wonderful and semi protracted display of our protagonist's breasts and upper torso and many unintentional laughs , it's a close call . Not too close though . Worth an Amazon $1.99 rental for the 80's horror hound completist if bound and determined .
Regardless of how tired I may have been , a ""good"" (satisfactory) scary picture , would have awaken me like a bold cup of coffee or two . Hate copious live action ghosts as well . Dumbed down to it's core . Insulting and not frightening .",1407024000,,1724,4.224242424242425
1193370,4,B000006G3T,"They don't make them like this anymore.  Excellent supernatural horror flick that somehow got by me in the 70s.  It was creepy, eerie and unpredictable...all of the ingredients for a good thriller.",1391817600,,197,5.125
1193371,4,B000006G3T,"I first watched this movie because of my interest in octagon houses back in the 80s.  It was actually filmed at the famous Armour Stiner octagon  house in  Irvington New York.  The owner allowed it to be used to mark the home before he began the extensive retoration.

The movie was creepy then and it is creepy now.  But this DVD marks a vast improvement in quality over the taped version I first had.

I thought it was a good flick and earlier this year began a search for the title. It took more than 4 months to find, but it was worth it! And to be able to get it on Blue-ray was icing on the cake.

1193373,5,B000006G3T,"Put this one in the same class as other really good haunted house thrillers. It is as good as the likes of The Hearse (sort of a haunted house movie), The Amityville Horror, and Burnt Offerings. This house is even cooler looking than all the other houses (although the Amityville house would give it a run for the money). A writer moves to the country on an R and R trip to get over her agoraphobia in the big city. Little does she know, there are terrible revelations that she begins to discover after she moves in. I've got the Blu-Ray version of this movie and the picture looks very good (about as good as it is going to look). The picture won't stand out but for a film that is over 30 years old it has no flaws in the picture but it still looks like it is from the early 80's. This is a really rare film that not many horror fans know about. It is worth seeing and owning. Glad this arrived on Blu-Ray. Check it out. Remember: the house is really awesome!!!",1336176000,2,963,4.182795698924731

7904203,4,B000006G3T,"I love to watch these old haunted house movies. The story lines are most often interesting with relatable characters who find a resolution to their challenges. In these classic films, one is made to rely on one's imagination, and belief that there is a parallel dimension in which ghosts look for closure to the lives they once lived.  Such is the case n ""The Nesting"".",1503360000,,369,4.676923076923077

7904205,2,B000006G3T,"There are many much better ghost movies out there. The key problem that this movie has is it is supposed to be a mystery, but everything is simply explained to the main character. The motivations for the other characters make little sense, and there are at least two characters who could simply not be in the movie and it would change nothing. Check out George C. Scott in ""The Changeling"" instead.",1499644800,,398,4.619718309859155
7904206,4,B000006G3T,"If we ignore the *extremely* confusing 20-minutes ending, the Nesting is a really good horror film.  Great atmosphere, acting, and everything else.  Those final 20 minutes though.  What in the world was going on there!

Actress Robin Graves suffers from a condition called agoraphobia.  It's an anxiety disorder where a person perceives their surroundings to be harmful, so they often panic and feel they  have no control over the matter.  Hey to an extent, I have the same symptoms.  Well just a few anyway and nowhere near this extreme.  Anxiety and faster heart beats leading to a fear something bad might happen.  I don't want to make this review about me, but Robin's condition isn't totally out of the ordinary from the way I perceived it.  At least, it's nothing out of the ordinary in the beginning.

Okay this movie made a lot of sense for a while.  I was loving it!  Robin's character is a book writer and she often visits a psychiatrist for her agoraphobia.  She questions if the visits are really helping considering all the money she's paying the psychiatrist and yet, she continues to have anxiety disorders and delusional outbursts.  Turns out she wrote a novel and the visions she has of a mansion (that we see on the cover of the book in one scene) perfectly matches a REAL mansion she happens to stumble upon after leaving the city and walking through the woods.  Along for the walk is her boyfriend played by Christopher Loomis, and I must say he's *really* annoying.  For example while roaming the house, every sarcastic/happy response he makes feels like it's intended just to grate on the ears.

There's a ton of atmosphere in the way Robin and Christopher roam the house.  Almost an Amityville Horror level of atmosphere!  Soon a repairman/handyman comes over to fix the toilet and other repairs around the house.  He makes a predictable comment to Robin that goes something like ""Why would anyone want to live here?""

It's mildly confusing when Robin has daydreams she's surrounded by other women smoking cigarettes in a living room with a piano, but this particular dream only gets more confusing when it happens over and over again near the end of the movie.  For now however, near the beginning, these are nice dreams she's having.  Well except for the part when Robin has trouble seeing a woman's face.  Otherwise she's just enthusiastic she's dreaming again.  She considers this progress with her agoraphobia condition.

The movie continues in a slightly confusing way when the repairman/handyman tries to come onto Robin after she makes a mistake inviting him inside to see if he can provide more information about this potentially haunted house, and suddenly he's attacked by... ghosts?  I guess so.  The women from Robin's dreams are now in the real world!  They attack the man by throwing him around the room, throwing chairs at him and eventually drowning him in the lake out back after he sees visions of dead women in his truck.  It's all so weird!  And before this, when Robin climbs out the top window of the house and scared for her life she's going to fall, the psychiatrist just happens to show up in time.  He runs inside to the top floor and tries to help by attempting to grab Robin's hand from the top window, but unfortunately these female ghosts don't like men so out the window and through a pointy ornament goes his eyeball in a nasty death!

So far I'm only mildly confused but totally enjoying the movie.  I'm thinking ""Okay, female ghosts from Robin's dream have come to life to kill anyone who tries to harm her"".  I never would've guessed there's actually a really sophisticated story going on here.

Robin tries to visit a neighbor and talk about the history of the house as she continues to suspect it's haunted, but this guy is absolutely insane and tries to attack Robin.  He takes a certain set of initials personally when she mentions them to the guy and asks what they mean.  A car chase ensues (but not before Robin lets out a hair-raising realistic scream running to her car).  While the car chase is going on he's running over the ghostly women who appear in front of his car as a distraction.

Soon the guy wrecks his car into a ditch.  Robin makes a mistake in pulling over and checking on the man only for him to be fine and try to grab Robin, so she takes off running to a nearby barn.  And yes, as you guessed, the ghostly women help her once again (by lifting up a pitchfork from the man's hands and throwing it at the wall). So far the story seems like ghostly female revenge on men.  And well, without spoiling too much and to put it simply, revenge on men is actually what it is.  It's hard to say why however at this point into the story.  Everything up to this point is about one hour and 15 minutes worth of material, and it's all really good.  A 5-star movie for sure.

But then...  The final 20 minutes happen.  Oh boy!

It's tempting to take off 2 stars from the amazon rating for the way the movie just dumps all this important storyline on the viewer at once near the end and expects the viewer to understand/absorb it all.  I certainly couldn't sort it all out.  Reading what really happens online (thanks wiki!) there's no way I stood a chance figuring out what was going on.  SPOILERS- those dreams Robin had about the women are actually prostitutes.  The living room is where they hang out.  When Robin rented the mansion from the colonel (John Carradine's character) we see him in a scene trying to explain what happened to his scientist grandson while lying in bed recovering from a stroke, but there's *so* much information being presented that it's incredibly hard to absorb it all, not to mention he mumbles through a great deal of it.

Anyway, to add more to the confusion, now Robin's visions grow more intense.  The movie goes back and forth from the colonel sharing his story concerning the events at the mansion to Robin's visions at the prostitute room.  She's now communicating with the prostitutes face to face.  She's actually there with them now.  Thank goodness for wiki.  More SPOILERS.  This mansion used to be a brothel during World War II, and a bunch of crazy men killed the prostitutes and dumped their bodies in the nearby lake.  Why I don't know.

Robin has a conversation with one of the women, and she explains she's actually Robin's granddaughter.  What the!  We now see the men shooting the prostitutes in a flashback scene.  There's no way those poor girls could get away from these horrible men who ganged up on the women by following them around the house just waiting to shoot every one of them.  One tries crawling up the stairs but was shot.  The flashback ends with a man lighting a match and holding it over a crib.  The baby's Robin's granddaughter.  It sure looked like the men were thinking about lighting the crib on fire, but if that was the case we'd see burn marks on the granddaughter's face while having the chat with Robin.  We don't.  So I'm not sure what the match meant.  She talks about how she was the only survivor in the shooting being the baby.  The story makes it seem like Robin's the granddaughter and she's talking to her mother or grandmother.  So confusing.  Then we see Robin's manuscripts burning (the men set the room on fire but the baby's okay?) and a truck being driven through her windows.  For what reason I haven't a clue.

I think more backstory would've made the Nesting easier to understand.  I mean more story throughout the movie instead of having it all dumped on the viewer at once.  It's just *way* too much all at once.  It strikes me as clumsy writing.  Even my suspicions trying to figure out what was going on during the final 20 minutes was nowhere close.  I was just really lost.  But despite that the movie has tremendous atmosphere.  You can watch this movie if you like.  Most reviewers enjoy it, and I do too, but it's one of those cases where I probably needed to know the ending before watching it.  For me knowing the ending and spoiling myself is necessary when it comes to a sophisticated storyline.  I'd rather have felt content by the end of the movie instead of confused by an overwhelming amount of storyline hitting me like mad.  But perhaps those with a better grasp on storylines would have no trouble understanding the ending.",1496275200,,8311,4.607094133697135
