4525926,5,B0051SFTNE,"Outcasts was an interesting show that was getting better and better as the season progressed. With so much unimaginative and mediocre programming on TV it's hard to believe a show like this was cancelled so prematurely. I'd love to see it brought back or re-imagined somehow. The premise is too good to waste, and what's not to like about a post-apocalyptic sci-fi show?",1312848000,3,370,4.888888888888889
4525927,5,B0051SFTNE,"Still optimistic about this show, but some plot elements are ambiguos; are they 'holes' in the plot, or foreshadowing?

 I'm giveing this episode a 5 star rather than a 4 star because of this shows explicit recognition of a very real existential issue that human colonists on a new plante will face; reproduction, and all that entails.",1309046400,,335,4.859649122807017
4525928,5,B0051SFTNE,"This austrailian import could be great, but it's to soon to tell. Some of ideas here are similar to Earth 2 in the sence that there is 'something out there'; I just hope it's not dirt surfing mole people. Time will tell, but for now I'm giving it 5 stars for a strong pilot based on high drama and believable post apocliptic science fiction elements.",1309046400,2,350,4.4
4525929,4,B0051SFTNE,"Not your everyday science fiction TV show, Outcasts is well written and unpredictable.  The show headed in too many directions all at once and that is ultimately what alienated its viewers.",1412553600,,189,5.096774193548387

4525931,5,B0051SFTNE,"An excellent show - really a shame it was canceled. I wish we had more shows like this, especially in the US. Good writing and good acting.
The story-telling is complex and interesting. It has all the standard elements you would expect with sci-fi, but this goes further by really exploring the characters. Highly recommended.",1402099200,,326,4.945454545454545
4525932,3,B0051SFTNE,"The acting has been adequate and the story interesting. The concept seems almost believable, but at times there is little hope shown by most of the characters. The circumstances are very difficult and a bit of humor does help the situation, but a few characters seem somewhat ""stilted."" Maybe the series should have been given at least a full season to be fully developed.",1401494400,,372,4.828125
4525933,4,B0051SFTNE,I haven't seen all of this but it is very entertaining.  I don't think I'd want to go through the entire thing though.,1399593600,,118,4.130434782608695
4525934,4,B0051SFTNE,"Making only one season of this entertaining show just goes to prove that BBC can be just as idiotic as American networks!  This program inproved as it went along and started to really realize its potential.  What a shame!  And, the way episode 8 ended, it showed that the decision to cancel was made with full knowledge of the show's progress.  The fate of the ""Outcasts"" is BBC's mistake, much comparable  to America's ""Firefly""!!!",1398470400,3,432,4.783783783783784

4525937,5,B0051SFTNE,"I really loved this series.  Beautiful cinematography, complex characters, great acting, and a touching love story (my next pair of cats will be named Cas and Fleur).  Too bad it was cancelled--even so, I highly recommend this series.",1394496000,2,234,5.131578947368421
4525938,5,B0051SFTNE,"This show has the best qualities of science fiction; it explores human nature in a setting which opens up new possibilities and new realities. It has a realistic feel to it.  There is very little trace of the interference of some studio executive trying to fit characters into our popular molds and concepts of the day in an effort to manipulate the audience into high ratings through cheap action, mindless dialogue, or steamy sex scenes. No attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator. No wonder it failed.  The situations seem fairly real. Many people probably did not even catch the discussion about the difficulties of finding crops that will thrive on a new planet. As with any low budget science fiction there are a few loose holes, but I have never seen a better good but flawed vs. Machiavellian evil comparison. I am very picky about what science fiction I like, but this is a winner.",1387756800,6,901,4.732484076433121
4525939,4,B0051SFTNE,"Outcasts was produced by Kudos in the U.K. Kudos has produced some great shows and Outcasts was one of their short lived series. Only eight shows, but in my opinion, eight great shows.

Basic premise: Humans have traveled to a distant planet they call Carpathia in an attempt to prolong the human race. They struggle with life on a new planet, including those them condemned to death and unseen forces they do not understand.

Acting: Mostly British actors with top notch performances by all.

Background: Carpathia at first appears desert and mountainous. As the series progresses, the landscape gets more intriguing. The settlement appears military like with both high tech areas and areas that seem very basic.

Storyline: There is a basic underlying story that is ongoing while they present new conflicts with each shows. All seem to jive well and are quite interesting.

The only real negative about this show is that it only lasted eight episodes. I found it very interesting and it left me wanting more. If you like SciFi type stuff, this series is well done and worth the watch, even if you do get left hanging.",1385164800,4,1119,4.837696335078534
4525940,4,B0051SFTNE,"I cannot get over the fact that they simply cancelled it without giving us a conclusion. If, after watching 8 reasonably OK episodes, you will get infuriated at being left hanging, slowly turning in the wind, do not start watching this at all. It is not terrific, but as I've said, it is a reasonably OK show with a good premise. The world is finally gone kaput through human greed (wars and famine etc.) and a leftover group of approx. 70,000 have made a planet named Carpathia their new home and done a good job of settling it.
I liked the characters,felt absorbed by their ups and downs.
However, as the story develops, so do loose ends and inconsistencies, for example, as another reviewer already mentioned, in the first episode they introduce a terrific mind-reading machine which is used to ascertain if someone is lying or not, and then in the following episodes the machine is never mentioned even though there are occasions when key characters' credibility is called into question. Also, while the set for the command center and presidential office, looks befitting a futuristic show, the rest of the settlement is poorly designed. Further, from the looks of it, you can hardly believe this is a city of 70,000, for at best you can see a few dozen people milling around. What, would it be so costly to use cgi generated humans to make us believe there are 70,000?
The abrupt and of OUTCASTS reminds me FIREFLY, cancelled after only 1 season. But at least fans of FIREFLY kept up the protest and a conclusion of sorts called SERENITY was produced as a movie.
I wonder if OUTCASTS producers could be induced into giving us the same?",1367366400,7,1640,4.678200692041522
4525941,5,B0051SFTNE,"I really loved this show, BUT WHAT HAPPENED!!!. My goodness, talk about leaving a person hanging in deep space. Please, spaceship, pick me up, land me on Carpathia so I can see WHAT HAPPENED!!!",1367280000,3,193,4.705882352941177
4525942,5,B0051SFTNE,"This is a different type of SciFi show, not unique, but different. It has a good cast and is well filmed in South Africa not Australia as some reviewers have said. Makes me wonder if they ever even watched the show.
Those are good points the down side is that the back stories are over cooked and laborsome at times. To much crammed into a one hour show each episode. But despite that it is well written for the most part.
Now who are the good guys and who are the bad guys well that is mostly a bit of confusion episode to episode except for one new comer character who is well pretty shallow in his intent. He could have been better covered as to was he really bad or really good sort of not really known. That would have been better for the show.
Also to many of the base characters in the show change sides on a regular basis and this gets boring real fast and you disconnect with them quickly.
But dispite all this the show had some very good points and was not too bad at all, rather good really compared to some other things touted by BBC and many other stations. It is really too bad that BBC canceled the show after 8 episodes. It seems the people who rule there are a bunch of fly by night knowitalls who really would not know something good if it walked up a smashed them in the mouth. Buy the show it is good reguardless of the faults listed here.",1358985600,2,1359,4.151515151515151
4525943,5,B0051SFTNE,"There's more to this series than meets the eye.  The acting alone is sublime.  There is a lot going on with a number of complex characters, each with their own back story.  I think the problem is that there are so many back stories that there isn't adequate time to truly plumb each for dramatic effect.  There is so much implied but never revealed that I can see why the masses were dissatisfied.  Even the antagonists (the natives to the planet) are a mostly invisible foe and are subsumed beneath human nature as the ultimate antagonist.  Maybe the show would have been more successful with a ""Lost"" flashback effect to give a subjective reveal of the context behind each character's (and antagonist's) motives.

For me, I don't need these back stories, the implication is enough.  I think the complexity of the characterisations is magnificent.  There is something truly huge about the storyline in this show.  I felt ripped off when I finished watching the first season on DVD, desperate and excited for more, only to find the show had been cancelled. I would have loved to have the chance to journey on with this show.",1351382400,3,1124,4.717948717948718
4525944,5,B0051SFTNE,"The first couple episodes start off slow, which is understandable, given all the world building and characterization needed, but by the final episode, the action is full-on. Its mood is reminiscent of Battlestar Galactica (the remake version), with a dark mood and philosophical questions about humanity. I felt like this series had all the makings of the next BSG - I'm disappointed to see it cancelled after only one season.",1350345600,3,426,5.1
4525945,3,B0051SFTNE,"Hey, let's take a thousand people (Two thousand? Three thousand? I don't know, you only always see the same dozen people), launch them to another star system, make them live in a hell hole made out of cargo ship containers and handball courts and place them under the leadership of compulsively secretive nut jobs, each with a sordid past of their own. Where were the psych screenings when they put this crew together?

I wish I had a nickel every time somebody says, ""Don't tell anyone about this"" and ""I can't tell you that.""

Let's throw in a gang of exiled genetically modified personae non gratae, the Outcasts outcasts, who are not only the most miserable lot of sad sacks, but also somehow created a baby, even though you never see any genetically modified women.

Oh, there's a baffling atmospheric problem that only blows up approaching ships that are carrying nice guy colonists, but bad guys who have come to take over have no problem getting through. Plus, there's ridiculous power struggles between the two law enforcement groups within the colony (the 'cop' guys and the 'army' guys). They keep arresting each other, backstabbing each other and/or beating each other up.

After the first two or three episodes, it becomes 'lie, do something sneaky, beat each other up, rinse, repeat'. The only thing that ever changes is the fact that they seem to make a conscious effort to show the Security Head Lady prance down a corridor in a new and sassy military tailored jacket (but not quite a uniform) in the beginning of each show.

Yep, no visible means of sustaining life, but the bar is always stocked and Ms. Top Cop apparently packed a jacket for every day of the year.",1347408000,4,1683,4.73037542662116
4525946,3,B0051SFTNE,"Have only seen the first episode so far.  Seems ok.  Basically, Earth is in the dumpster, and a struggling colony is trying to make a go of it.  I was a little worried it was going to be like Moonbase 3 - one of the absolute worst British Sci-Fi shows I ever saw.  Basically, labor unions complaining in space -uhg.  Much better than that - at least there is some action.  Sorry to hear it only lasts 8 shows.",1346716800,,409,4.113924050632911
4525947,2,B0051SFTNE,"This show had every ingredient for success. An excellent cast of veteran actors - neat sci-fi starter story idea - excellent cinematography - and it all comes together to fall completely flat.

So what went wrong here? I'm a sci-fi junkie and I know full well that a cancellation never reflects on a sci-fi show's quality. In fact most of the best sci-fi shows have been cancelled early. From the original Star Trek, to Farscape, to mayfly lifespan of Firefly - quality science fiction resists appreciation in its time.

Yet that is just not the case for Outcasts. This show deserves its cancellation. Nothing groundbreaking or even particularly interesting happens in its 8 episode run. Each episode, including the pilot watch like a mid-season filler episode that you wade through waiting for the exciting arc episode, except there is no story arc.

The show makes a lot of assumptions. It assumes that the audience will bond with the main characters - but they do nothing in the way of writing scenes that make these characters intriguing, likable, or even detestable. The characters are like paper dolls - one wears the reluctant hero outfit, another the scheming, yet complicated villain. The show is so plot driven they've forgotten to spice up the characters with personality and life. Refusing to take any risks, the audience is served up a cast of McCharacter's that taste the same, no matter what show or genre they're in.

The show doesn't insult, offend, or alienate the viewer - it's just too cautious to be interesting. Too timid to be intriguing. And too confident to work hard for its supper.",1345248000,10,1608,4.8791208791208796
4525948,3,B0051SFTNE,"In Outcasts, thousands of people have escaped a ravaged Earth and journeyed to the planet Carpathia to rebuild the human race. Eventually, the ships with new colonists stop arriving.  This series begins 15 years after the establishment of the colony, with 70,000 inhabitants.  Unfortunately, a ""plague"" killed many of the original children, and the reproduction rate of the colonists is approaching nil.  Many of the colonists seem to have a history; in a way, they are 'outcasts"" from Earth.  In addition, there are outcasts from the colony, who want their revenge on Carpathia.

There are 8 episodes of this series, and it ends abruptly and without any closure to the many story lines.  The characters demonstrate little growth and sophistication throughout the show, and a ""mind-reading"" device introduced in the first episode is then never used to uncover the truth to real mysteries.  Go figure.

I had to see this, since I'm a sci-fi junkie.  Rather forgettable, but I think it would have improved over time.  Alas, there is no time now for redemption.",1339459200,10,1058,5.028735632183908

Me and my hubbie enjoyed it immensely, and I have been searching around to buy series two, only to discover here that it was cancelled!

I am so disappointed, and cannot believe, given the amount of stupid, mind-numbingly boring TV shows that are allowed to run for years, that this series was cancelled. What is wrong with the world??!

Now, I am left in limbo, wondering what the second series would have been like and what would have happened. I had just started warming to the characters and the plot, and was so looking forward to settling in to watch season two.

4525951,5,B0051SFTNE,"This is March 28, 2012 and just bought ""Outcasts"". I streamed from Netflix and thoroughly enjoyed, loved it and was anxiously awaiting the 2nd season until I, quite by accident, discovered it was canceled. What a stupid/gutless decision.

TV shows, movies, theatre, etc. one can always find flaws in any of them and the one just canceled had them; what does it matter?  This program was building into something great!! The one season was a good one, liked the plot and saw where it was going.  One can only imagine what could have been done with a series such as this.

Enjoyed the acting the scenery, etc. What a pity to cancel and a grave mistake!! Like another commenter stated somewhere, ""This makes me wish to not ever get involved in another bbc production"". They didn't have the decency or guts to give the proper burial it deserved (end it!!!!!!).",1333065600,,855,4.68
4525952,3,B0051SFTNE,"Well I both loved and hated this show. I absolutely love stories of starting, or still frontier colony worlds having to build up and get on their feet. Very fascinating! However, while this is worth a rental or stream - its not complete enough to be worth a purchase. Earth 2 was, this is not.

Great:
======
1) Spectacular South Africa scenary for the planet.
2) Reasonable near future equipment and clothing
3) Nice enough CGI on the starships, though a wasteful design (You could harvest the rear section for materials)

Bad:
====
1) Earth 2 was never concluded, but you knew they were getting to the site, and would survive. This series ends with 3 seperate conflicts heating up: A) The AC;s, B) The Aliens, C) The 10th Transport
2) Body armor anyone? Not a single piece of protective gear is in use by the XP's forces when Ballistic weapons are still in use. Neither vests nor helmets.
3) Killing off the most interesting character in the first episode, and never really resolving if he killed his wife or not.
4) Scientific inability to safely enter an atmosphere after 11 years on planet. Yet they can NOE the passenger pod of Transport #10, and come in with a stealth mode.
5) Poor starship design - Their oneway starships they are unable to use the rear half of as orbitals, or additional building materials once on the surface.
6) I understand the electromagnetics messing up flight, so they discontinued the use of flyers. However, what about Cars, Trucks, or even Horses. Something. Anything. Land Rover should have done a deal like Hummer did for Earth 2.
7) Undetectable Colonial Transport #10 that their sensors cannot see, nor their communications network pick up.

It had a lot of promise. It was pretty and worth a single view.",1333065600,3,1745,4.696078431372549
4525953,1,B0051SFTNE,"Why do the 100+ apocalyptic movies made in just the past dozen year all seem to have the same story lines; same sets (abandoned warehouse look); same model spacecraft. No point in waiting around and seeing how it all ends, I can just pick any of that vast genre (won't make any difference which) and watch it. Just to randomly pick a year (and we can go back thousands if we include literature) - 2010, I think there 10 made. I wonder if there is some insight into the human brain for such an obsession. Oh, how I long for Escape NY & LA, The Last Man nominees Logan & Max & Legend & Eli, anything ... Dead, Beaches on Waterworlds, Postmen on Roads, anything ... Later, Resident ... anything, Terminator ... anything, Apes with Zombie ... anything, Soylent with Time Machine, many with Dead in their title.

Made for TV style acting with a fragmented disjointed formula storyline. Just plain boring.",1332374400,3,899,4.549382716049383
4525954,3,B0051SFTNE,"I saw just one episode when this first aired. The quality of the cast and impressive HD surroundings of the South African mountains made this something I wanted to watch more of, but the poor ratings meant that it was quickly rescheduled and then cancelled. So when it came out on Blu-Ray I bought it to catch up on the story, curious to see why it had been considered so bad.

The best thing about Outcasts is the casting. Liam Cunningham's portrayal of the reluctant President is perfectly understated and taut. Hermione Morris is quality as ever. Daniel Mays gives good depth to what would otherwise be a secondary character in the show. His range of performance in the role is surprising good too. The effort and dedication of the whole crew to the production is evident, but the well-documented filming constraints of the budget and preparation time let them down and it shows on-screen.

The South African setting is visually impressive though. The beach scenes in episode 4 are amazing in HD, but it just looks like another country, not another planet. The only times Carpathia looks alien is for a few brief shots when two moons are seen in the sky. A few extra visual effects would have been more convincing, and probably better than the expense of filming it overseas. After a few episodes it feels like they are shooting everything around the same patch of land. Could they perhaps have gotten more variety of location but on a lower budget filming in the UK?

The storyline is dramatic and works well as a drama. There are lots of little rushed flaws in the writing. Sometimes it feels like out-of-character decisions are made just to create some quick dramatic tension. Berger's character isn't quite menacing enough as the bad guy. He is a religious zealot which means - a bit of a cliche now - that we are to meant to suspect his motives, but as soon as it is made clear from his actions that he is the bad guy (even though it is clear from the start he is), his religious motivations are dropped like a stone and never mentioned again. The major character we identify with in the first episode is never seen again after it! The science-fiction parts of the writing in particular don't seem very well thought out (how do you 'broadcast' DNA with sound waves?!).

The series borrows story ideas from recent shows like Lost and Battlestar Galactica (the new series), but doesn't match those shows - it tried to do it on a much smaller budget and with less preparation time. Unfortunately it shows, which is probably why it was never received well. I really wanted to like Outcasts, but it didn't give itself a chance. It will sit proudly though in my BD collection as a reminder of what happens when you try to produce science fiction overseas on a domestic drama budget.",1328227200,3,2784,4.629554655870446
4525955,4,B0051SFTNE,"The premise is one we've heard before--Earth failing, found a compatible planet and migrate as many as possible. Corrupt government with hidden agenda. New planet is already occupied by unseen race. Moral dilemma. Good vs. evil. Given that, I did enjoy the story and am sad there will only be the one season. It just gets to the interesting part and it's over.",1326153600,,360,4.73015873015873
4525956,5,B0051SFTNE,"A brilliant premise, which was well-crafted, but cut short before its time. Some reviews have called the show boring or plodding -- and I contest that. ""Outcasts"" is a mystery in addition to SF and its slow-boil works to that end.  So many people expect thrill-a-minute excitement -- with explosions! and dinosaurs! and ridiculous jump-cut action sequences every two seconds...""Outcasts"" is decidedly not that.  And ""thank goodness"", I say.
If you enjoy a 70's style pacing and filmic style, with nuanced performances, by three-dimensional & oft-flawed characters, and carefully-crafted/plausible art direction...this show is for you. If you want a blockbuster show to gorge on popcorn to, well then, look elsewhere.",1319587200,15,716,5.5
4525957,3,B0051SFTNE,"Judge Roman Martel, DVD Verdict--  There is a lot to like about the series, and yet it ends up shooting itself in the foot. But lets start with the good stuff. The basic premise about a group of humans struggling to survive on an alien world has a lot of promise. When the series deals with some of these challenges directly, it's gripping stuff. There are strange atmospheric storms, areas of the planet that release high levels of radiation and the native life forms that may be able to clone humans. When the world of Carpathia is explored, Outcasts is at its most interesting. But the series holds back, never really delving into these idea.

For all the good points, the end result is a disappointment. The big culprit here is the execution of the story. Outcasts can't seem to figure out what it wants to be: a gripping character drama, a police procedural, or a sci-fi survival story. It tries to juggle all the elements and ends up missing the boat on all of them. Outcasts has the feel of a series that somewhere along the line, someone got cold feet. They didn't want this to get too sci-fi and too otherworldly. Instead they opted to increase the drama. Every character has a past, every past manages to rear its head and everyone ends up on the verge of tears at some point in the series. With all the angst, bitterness and anguish going around; the surrounding issues of survival and exploration get pushed to the background. This focus on dramatics and grittiness keeps the whole tone very dower. There is a little humor here and there, but as a whole the dialogue is dry.

The sci-fi elements are present, with the ACs and the intelligent life forms on the planet, but too often they are pushed aside for a mother and daughter conflict or a manhunt for a murderer. This causes the series to feel like it's meandering around, dropping tiny bits of plot and character elements but not doing much more.

The end result is a show that has some great elements that weave all the way through, but manages to be boring at the same time. I was interested enough to see where it was going, but not super excited to see the next episode. It takes until episode six to actually kick up the interest level, and the last couple of episodes have some good stuff in them.

Lastly the look of the show is very realistic, almost to the point of ridiculousness. This is supposed to be the future and yet everyone is dressed like its 2011. There are some high tech gadgets around, but most of it is underplayed. I'm fine with that, but in the end there is very little visual interest in the series. Everything is drab, neutral colored and lacking in spark. There are a few action scenes in the series and they kick things up a bit, but there is no wonder here, no joy or thrills. I would hope that exploring and living on an unknown world would be more interesting than what we see here.

BBC provides a three disc set for fans looking to revisit the show. The picture looks great, showing off the amazing location shooting. The sound is well balanced. You get a couple of featurettes that delve into behind the scenes of the filming the series.

In the end, the show was a great idea that lost its footing along the way. There was potential there, and I'm sad it was canceled before it could really get cooking. Those last couple of episodes showed some promise.

4525958,3,B0051SFTNE,"This series was shot in south africa and the backdrop is stunning because of that. But unfortunately because the bbc only make short series and this one is cancelled you don't have a ending. Instead you get a series that starts off slow and gets better. The sets of the colony are strange ,some are futuristic and some are sheet metal, as to say this is a poor affair of a colony.  The story starts with the last of humankind on the new planet, earth is dead because of the pollution on it, it's 2300 a.d. or so, and the last humans are in this grungy colony. I can say that this was not my fave sci fi show at all but it did get better. I had a hard time with the sheet metal sets etc.  They could utilize the stone around?  Or well, it's a low budget affair , still as the story went on and you got a feel for where they were going it got alot better. ALiens were on the planent and wanted them dead, artifical creations or made humans also were on the loose. If the bbc would make 20 eps they could have ended this series completely but that's the way it goes I guess. The other effects of spaceships though look great and realistic and
this one like 'survivors' just never had a chance. The dvd set is typically expensive and it's got a great picture because this is a new series.  The acting here is done by longtime bbc folks and that helps too.",1313107200,3,1351,4.1254752851711025

8453197,5,B0051SFTNE,"Super great Sci-Fi TV Series. It needs a Season 2. I hope this series can be revived as it was cancelled just when things were getting interesting. This is a unique Suspenseful Dramatic  Sci-Fi TV Series. A realistic and good story that must be continued. It is like ""The Expanse"". Tell the Network you want more. Tell Amazon you want it picked up and revived.",1498348800,,360,4.538461538461538
8453198,5,B0051SFTNE,It was such a shame when this series ended. It had good characters and a good plot. Outcasts fits very well into the post-apocalyptic theme as it is explored in science fiction.,1494979200,,177,4.5625

8453202,5,B0051SFTNE,I really liked the show. I watched it all in less than 2 days on net flicks and was totally disappointed that there was only one season and then cancelled leaving me hanging wanting more of an interesting show which was not given a chance.,1437696000,,239,4.333333333333333
8453203,3,B0051SFTNE,"I watched the series on Hulu, and was impressed.  Overall, it is an enjoyable series in the genre' of post-apocalyptic survivors though in this series the survivors relocated to another planet, and there planet earth is uninhabitable.  (I don't remember if the series dealt with why earth became unihabitable?)  From my view, the biggest issue with the show was the lack of character development.  From the beginning you haven't a clue who these folks are, and the confustion between roles made this show hard to follow.  All in all it was a good show, and I had hoped that there was a season two but upon finding out it was cancelled I wasn't overly disappointed.  In summary, this is a good series to watch on an indoor weekend.",1423699200,,730,4.6640625
