2238291,5,B0007RT9MG,"If there was one thing Marvel did right with the Spider-Man The Animated TV Series it was produsing this great 3 chapter episode titled, THE VENOM SAGA.  Although the storyline is off from the comic book version the story is nice, the idea behind it was invigorating, and most of all the depiction of VENOM was right on the mark for me.  The greatest nightmare and allie roled into two. Expect this to sell out fast and become hard to find.  This 3 part set is the most saught after of all the Animated Spider-Man episodes!",1109894400,2,523,4.427083333333333

I was disapointed in this purchase. Low marks for Marvel even if you are an old Spider-Man fan like me. The other Spidey dvds are much better with more bonuses & more extras!

And the 2-part sequel with Carnage is even better, since Iron Man comes into the mix.

2238340,5,B0007RT9MG,"There is now no doubt in my mind that this is the best of all of the Spiderman incarnations. I know that I had stated in a previous review for The Spectacular Spiderman that it was in fact better, but I must now change my mind. Although i will say that Spectacular Spiderman was still a great show in its own right. Indeed, I'd put it at #1A right behind the 1990s series. Part of my strong ratings for the series is its longevity. When it was cancelled, it was still highly rated. That cannot be said of the 2003 MTV Spiderman, which turned many off with its adult-themed topics.

This DVD introduces us to ""The Alien Costume, Parts I-III"" and The Sins of the Fathers Chapters X-XI ""Venom Returns"" & ""Carnage."" With cameo appearances by Iron Man and Venom becoming a temporary allie of Spiderman. The complexities of the characters are what drew me to this DVD. The actor that played Carnage's voice and alter-ego was nothing but phenomenal! He gave his all and the viewer and listener believed in his psychosis as well as meglomania.

I liked the evolution and deepening of Eddie Brock/Venom's character. Like in the episode ""The Spot,"" so much can change in a man when he falls in love with a beautiful woman. The love of a beautiful woman can turn a man away from a life of crime. This is wonderfully displayed towards the end as we see Brock willing to sacrifice himself for the psychiatrist/therapist he loves.

I'm so glad that I did not see this before the 2007 movie. I also never read the 1984 comic book story arc, so I had true wonder and enjoyment when I saw the final Raimi film---which I enjoyed tremendously (See My Amazon Review). This DVD has the ususal extras, paired down somewhat from the previous Spiderman DVDs, but still an interesting view.

Get this DVD and you will not be disappointed.

2238357,5,B0007RT9MG,I am a HUGE fan of Venom. He is my favorite villian in spider-man. The story of the venom saga is great. I starts off with how the symbiote got to earth and how it bonded with Peter Parker. Then explains how the suit was eventually taken off by spider-man and then bonded with Eddie Brock. This happens in episode 3 so it's not long until venom appears. The last 2 episodes bring in the offspring of venom CARNAGE!! I loved the fact they added carnage to this saga because he does have a big part eventually becoming an enemy of venom.

2238359,4,B0007RT9MG,I use to watch this animated series as a kid but I didn't appreciate the writing or plot development as much as just watching Spidey fight the bad guys.

The DVD is well-made and the bonus material with Stan Lee is entertaining to watch.

2238360,5,B0007RT9MG,"Astronaut John Jameson whom is the son of Jonah Jameson was doing an exploration on the moon as he bring backs a space rock with a black alien slime inside of it. When it attacks John as they approach Earth the ship crash lands by the river of New York, a large muscular man in a Rhino outfit named The Rhino steals the space rock from the ship with Peter Parker's rival Eddie Brock taking pictures of the robbery and telling Jonah Jameson that Spider-Man was the one that robbed the shuttle. Spidy has been framed and a mysterious alien goo consumes his costume making it into a special black Spider-Man costume with super jumping speed, can change his clothes for him and can make unlimited webbing thus making him a super Spider-Man as he thinks it's swell. Unfortunately it's a deadly living organism that is trying to take over his personality and his body as he soon discovers and must try to get rid of it, once he does it consumes Eddie Brock turning him into the sharp-toothed big eyed black Spider-Man doppleganger named Venom so he can reek his revenge on Spider-Man.

Another great DVD set of the great 1994 Spider-Man animated series but this time with every fanboy's favorite Spider-Man villain, these episodes also guest star Kingpin, Shocker, Rhino, Iron-Man, War Machine and Carnage. Featuring the voices of Hank Azaria and Ed Asner and good animation with some CGI, this is the perfect appetizer for fans before they see ""Spider-Man 3"" to see Venom on the big screen.

The DVD has only a few extras like introductions by Stan Lee, a multi-featurette on Venom's origins by the creators and Stan Lee's Soapbox.",1178064000,,1626,4.701754385964913

2238375,4,B0007RT9MG,"After buying the Doc Ock installment of Fox's Spider-Man cartoon on DVD, I noticed it contained a promo for ""The Venom Saga"" coming in Winter 2004.  I had been looking forward to it as the three-part ""Alien Costume"" story arc was what got me interested in the show (and Spider-Man in general) back when I was a lad in 1994.  But, Winter 2004 came and went leaving no Venom in its wake.  I had completely forgotten about it until just yesterday when I saw it on the impulse-buy shelf at the checkout counter at my local supermarket.  I have no idea what caused the delay; at first I wondered if the distributor wanted to hold the release until the next movie (see my review of the Essential Spectacular Spider-Man for a similar gripe).  Regardless, the Venom Saga is here now and it includes probably the best episodes of the series currently on DVD.

The ""Alien Costume"" series features some of the finest supervillains and super-anxieties that you're likely to see Spider-Man face, in this cartoon or any other media.  In it, Spidey rescues J.J. Jameson's astronaut son from a downed space shuttle, hoping to receive some real accolades from his alter ego's boss for a change.  However, due to some serious yellow journalism from Parker's rival photog, Eddie Brock, Spidey is framed for stealing the highly fissionable alien material Prometheum X from the shuttle and ol' sourpuss puts out a million dollar pricetag on him instead.  The Prometheum is actually in the big, meaty hands of the Kingpin who, along with his science advisor Alistair Smythe and his two costumed gunnies, Rhino and the Shocker, is hoping to sell the extraterrestrial WMD to some ski-mask wearing terrorists (seriously).  Meanwhile, Peter has unknowingly gained something else than grief from his latest mission: an amorphous alien symbiont that chooses Peter as its new host.  Assuming the shape of a svelte black and white ""costume"", the creature greatly augments Spider-Man's powers, giving him increased strength and speed, natural organic webbing, and the ability to look like Aerosmith lead guitarist Joe Perry whenever he wants.  Before too long, Spidey is swatting bounty hunters aside left and right and bearing down on the Kingpin's little racket with the greatest of ease, although a gradual shift in his personality towards ruthlessness, nay, murderousness starts to occur.  Realizing that the symbiont will eventually turn him into a bloodthirsty monster, Peter manages to shake it off for good, although it goes on to find Eddie Brock and that's were this disc's title character enters the picture.  Venom is like Spider-Man's spurned friend turned mortal enemy.  He has all of Spidey's powers and knows his true identity, and he can even slide under his previously infallable spider sense.  How will Spider-Man be able to halt this new deadly (and evenly-matched) menace before Venom spills the beans to Mary Jane and Aunt May?  You know he will, of course, but how?

It would be two more seasons before Venom showed his Gene Simmons-esque tongue again in the ""Venom and Carnage"" two-parter, and ""The Venom Saga"" has that covered as well.  In this one, Spidey recruits Iron Man and War Machine to combat the two symbionts on the loose.  That's right.  During its time apart from Eddie, the Venom symbiont asexually spawned a ""son"" which later bonded with grade-A looney tune Cletus Kasady to create the razor-handed blood-red terror known as Carnage.  Venom and Carnage's jailbreaks are spearheaded by Dr. Strange's nemesis Baron Mordo who needs the symbionts' help in bringing his hot-headed master Dormammu into our dimension.  However, when Mordo prepares to sacrifice the soul of Brock's psychiatrist/girlfriend Dr. Ashley Kafka in the process, Venom becomes convinced to try playing the hero for a change.  It's all quite a lot of conflict and characters to fit into two Saturday morning cartoons, and I'd say it works very well.

It's a good buy overall, however I have to say that all of these selected-episode discs are really starting to make me wish for the release of complete seasons on DVD.  The stories on this disc would have been more fleshed out if I could have seen the episodes about Baron Mordo's original scheme and the pre-Venom Eddie Brock sooner than nine years ago.  Marvel's ""Distinguished Competition"" is already doing that with Batman, Superman, and the Super Friends.  Fortunately, I understand that the complete series of the Fantastic Four cartoon from the 90's is coming soon.  Maybe we'll see a season set for Spider-Man once the next movie comes out (Am I starting to sound bitter from saying that so often?).",1118188800,38,4634,4.989596879063719
2238376,5,B0007RT9MG,"Plot Review:

In the animated movie, ""Spiderman- The Venom Saga"", Spiderman (aka. Peter Parker) faces his most formidable foe in Venom. The plot starts out with Spiderman going to the rescue of a shuttle that crash lands in New York. During the rescue, he has blue glob stuck to his suit. Little does he know that the blue glob is living and evil! It gives Spiderman his toughest battle he has faced!

Content Review:

This is an excellent animated movie that addresses issues such as good v.s evil, power, responsibility, love, and sacrifice. It is rated PG-13 for extensive animated violence.

Spiritual Implications:

In the movie, we see venom taking over Spiderman as it comes from beyond the earth. What happens is that Spiderman enjoys his new found power and pleasure that he was not willing to let it go at first so it slowly feeds of him.

This reminds me of what sin is. Sin is like venom that can poison anyone it touches. It comes from beyond the earth in the form of principalities and darkness.

""If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door; it desires to have you, but you must master it."" (Genesis 4:7, NIV)

Once a person allows sin to reign in their life then the good they used to do slowly will stop! To evade it they must fight it and resist it. This is not easy as Spiderman came to realize it but it is possible.

""Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes. For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms."" (Ephesians 6:10-12, NIV)

""Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded."" (James 4:7-8, NIV)

In the movie, Spiderman dressed in RED figured out the weakness of Venom and used it against Venom. In the same way we need RED to come to our rescue because of the Venom we all face. RED becomes our antidote to help us overcome the venom that eats us alive and makes us do things we would not do!

Just as Spiderman came to the rescue of Eddie Brock covered in Venom and being destroyed, Jesus Christ has come to our rescue. Jesus shed His cleansing blood on the cross to give us an antidote that is so RED to come to our rescue. Now because of the Blood of Jesus, it becomes out antidote against this venom known as sin. We need to accept the Blood of Jesus to wash away the venom from our lives. We cannot do it on our own but need the help of Jesus. When Jesus covers us we have a transfusion of change that wipes away the venom making us free!

""For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God. Keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be shepherds of the church of God, which he bought with his own blood."" (Acts 20:27-28, NIV)

""This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood."" (Romans 3:22-25, NIV)

""Since we have now been justified by his blood, how much more shall we be saved from God's wrath through him!"" (Romans 5:9, NIV)

""In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, in accordance with the riches of God's grace."" (Ephesians 1:7, NIV)

""But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ."" (Ephesians 2:13, NIV)

In the movie, the evil character is so evil that he asks bad people hungry for power to give their souls to him to help them defeat Spiderman. The result is more venom and carnage.

""What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?"" (Matthew 16:26, NIV)

Evil takes the form of Carnage destroying everything in its path. Carnage even takes the life force out of many human beings. Sin is also like carnage that destroys those sucked into it without outside help. Just as Spiderman received help to defeat Carnage, we need to receive help from our brothers and sisters in Christ to help defeat Satan through fellowship, reading of God's Word, and prayer!

""For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in [ Or through] Christ Jesus our Lord."" (Romans 6:23, NIV)

""But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, purifies us from all [ Or every] sin."" (1 John 1:7, NIV)

A touching moment in the movie is when Venom is overpowered by love. This love helps Eddie Brock fight Venom that has overtaken him. This reminds me of how the love of Jesus Christ can turn the hardest hearts and make them into loving and sacrificial beings.

""My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends."" (John 15:13, NIV)

""Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails."" (1 Corinthians 13:4-8, NIV)

Questions to Ponder:

What are you willing to give up, to receive power you never had?

Have you ever had an experience where someone told you that you had changed and what was your reaction?

Why does sin look enticing but becomes deadly?",1118102400,11,5922,4.367941712204007

2238378,5,B0007RT9MG,"I was hoping to be the first reviewer of this DVD, but because Amazon.com didn't list it with the other 'Spidey' DVD's, I had to wait forever to see it, and that just makes me annoyed.  This DVD was even released into the stores before Amazon.com showed it (and I bought this DVD before I even got 'Doc Ock').  But here I go anyway . . .
Venom is my favourite enemy of Spider-Man, and I love watching this DVD.  The first 3 episodes (""the Alien Costume Pt. 1-3)"" show how Spider-Man finds the 'Alien Symbiote' and uses it for his own costume, how he tries to get rid of it and finally how Eddie Brock becomes Venom and Spider-Man's worst nightmare (Season 1).  The next episode is ""Venom Returns"", with War-Machine (Ironman's friend and partner) helping Spider-man fight the returned Venom , as well as the new arrival of Carnage, with Ironman appearing in the next episode ""Carnage"" (both Season 3).  ""Venom Returns"" and ""Carnage"" are back-to-back/to-be-continued episodes, so, unlike the previous DVDs which had 4 episodes, this release has 5 episodes.  The only other special features are the usual ""Episode Introductions with Stan Lee"" and ""Stan Lee's Soapbox"", and he says a lot of interesting things.  But just like the ""Doc Ock"" DVD, the Main Menu starts out differently from the first 3 DVDs (now possibly being made by Marvel Entertainment and not Disney, which you can see on the side-spine), and the first episode also has a new opening (same tune, though).  The animation is great, but when it comes to epsiodes 4 & 5 it doesn't look the same, sometimes a bit slaggy or not much effort, but still okay.  We not only see how Eddie Brock and Cletus Kassidy become Venom & Carnage, but this is also the first time we see Shocker (voiced by the talented and many charactered Jim Cunning) and the Rhino (although we don't see their origins).  Also, inside the DVD cover, instead of having the 20 chapters, it lists the original EPSODE titles.  What I really liked about this DVD, is that Ironman (and War-Machine) make their return to DVD, having first appeared on the ""Incredible Hulk (Animated Series)"" DVD.  But, he/his suit doesn't look as good here as he does in his own animated series, the ""Hulk"" DVD or (as I vaguely remember) the 5th Spider-Man season, during the Secret Wars saga.  His armour looks less steel-like and more like the often-used skin-tight outfit, but seeing him is good enough.  The only thing I don't like about this saga, is how the 2 symbiotes are defeated at the end of the 5 episodes, bearing too much of a resemblance to some episodes on the earlier DVDs.  Also annoying is when Eddie (now with the power of Venom) decides to constantly follow/stalk Peter Parker around and make Aunt May think that he is ""such a nice man"" - sorry to say this, but it makes her seem dumb, and even though that's how it happened in the comics, I don't like how Aunt May agrees in having Spider-man caught (and in front of Peter, too!)  But at least Mary-Jane knows better than to trust him after his return.  I have also noticed that the 4 previous DVDs have Spider-Man being either squeezed and/or being ""crushed"" while restrained by Kingpin, 'Ultimate Slayer' Smythe, Doc Ock and Scorpion.  I'm disappointed how Venom doesn't do the exact same thing to Spidey, (although there is a head-lock and being wrapped-up in webbing) and Venom does restrain Ironman, but only for a second.  Spider-Man (in his Alien Costume) does put the squeeze on Shocker, however.
I hope it's not too long until I see a ""Spider-Man vs. Venom"" Movie, the release of ""Ironman: The Movie"" and Ironman's own Animated Series on DVD.  It would have been nice if this DVD also had a clip from Season 4's ""the Haunting of Mary Jane"", where Venom and Carnage do make a small return, which would've made a nice little special extra.  I also wonder if there will be a 6th Spider-Man Animated series DVD.
Personally, I think that DVDs 2 & 3 (Dare-Devil and Doc Ock) should've INSTEAD been ""the Spider-Slayers"" (with the Scorpion, Alister's machine and him becoming 'the Ultimate Slayer' (favourite scene on that DVD is 10) or have each Season be released onto 2 DVDs, each having 6-7 episodes (5 Seasons with 11-14 Episodes = 10 DVD's).  If these 2 DVDs were to commemerate the movie releases of Dare-Devil & Spiderman 2, then how come there was no 'Spiderman: Enter the Punisher' DVD?  The remaining episodes that need to be put onto DVD are 10 episodes from season 1, all of seasons 2 and 5, 'Doctor Strange' from season 3 and finally 6 (or 7) episodes from Season 4.  The DVD that I believe they should make in the near future is ""Secret Wars"" from Season 5.
However, I have recently discovered (from UltimateDisneyDVD) that the DVD ALSO has a ""Villianous Web"" and ""Sneal Peaks"" special features, which is not on the Australian DVD which I reviewed.  Despite this 'country-transfer-rip-off', this is still a good DVD, but when you look for this DVD, make sure that it has the 'Villanous Web' and 'Sneak Peaks' specials, or you'll miss out like me.",1115856000,15,5038,4.6527621195039455
2238379,5,B0007RT9MG,I actually liked this spider-man series. This one with Venom was really exciting. On the show they also feature Carnage. Venom was one of the biggest challenges for spidey because he had the same powers. I recommend this to anyone who is a big fan of spider-man.,1113350400,2,262,4.595744680851064
