627539,5,6303320562,"This is a very well done staged production.  Always in search of John Karlen films, once again, I had to be content with few scenes.  Few but good.  He's worth it.  Though not a Hollywood treatment, this film is professional and arty.  The settings and lighting are particularly good.  Robert Foxworth is quite interesting and appealing as the doctor.  Karlen has too small a part, as usual, but nonetheless, he, as always, handles himself well.  Bo Svenson makes the monster more sympathetic than frightening.  All in all worth the purchase.",1297900800,,542,4.933333333333334
627540,1,6303320562,"With imagination, a viewer might be able to see some connection to Shelley's novel; however, the production was extremely poor. (Example that brought a chuckle: brown hair sticking out from under a black wig!)  I haven't really seen a Frankenstein movie that I thought was good, but this rendition falls to the bottom of my list!  A waste of money!",1273363200,,348,4.783333333333333
627541,4,6303320562,"To sum up, I recommend this Dan Curtis's version of the classical monster tale. Aside from a few flaws (the monster could have even learnt to write poetry!!), an entertaining story. For obvious reasons, it is imposible not to appreciate similarities with Dan Curtis's Dark Shadows, including the TV filming format, some artefacts and special effects during the lab experiments, the music score, and some of the characters such as the blind girl (you even have John Carlen on the cast).",1232323200,4,485,5.0

627543,2,6303320562,"I was very excited to see this Frankenstein advertised, being a fan of other Curtis productions like Dark Shadows, The Night Stalker, and the Jack Palance version of Dracula. However, this movie occupies a curious limbo. In style, production values, and acting, it is very much like the original Dark Shadows TV series. It even has almost identical music by the same composer, and the presence of John Karlen (Willie from Dark Shadows) as the doctor's sidekick. But what worked well in the context of an ongoing Gothic soap is rather disappointing when transplanted to a feature. The whole look of the production is particularly stagebound, which is probably the fault of poor lighting. It's a bit like watching an amateur theatrical. Nothing becomes believable, or atmospheric, enough to be moving. A much better TV adaptation from around the same time is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-The-True-Story/dp/B000H30AQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein - The True Story</a>&nbsp;with James Mason and Jane Seymour.",1212364800,6,1074,5.98051948051948
627544,4,6303320562,"It doesn't take Victor & the Creature to the Arctic, but it's still so close to the spirit of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. This was first on TV when I was 11 & I felt so sad for the Creature. There a few changes- the blind friend is a pretty young woman, but it makes matters even more poignant. The film starts with the Paradise Lost quote of the title page of the book, and the theme continues throughout. If you love the tale of Frankenstein, you need this version!",1203638400,,467,4.258426966292135
627545,5,6303320562,"The 1973 Dan Curtis ""Frankenstein"" is an eloquent, 2-part video-taped production. A contemporary of the equally stylish ""Frankenstein: the True Story"", the Curtis version was originally relegated as episodes of the late-night, television series, ""Wide World of Mystery"".

Bo Svenson (coined as the ""giant"", as opposed to the ""monster"" or ""creature"") gives a powerhouse performance as Shelley's misunderstood specimen. Indeed, Svenson conveys the anticpated danger that one naturally associates with this character, but his focus is ultimately on confusion and sensitivity. In essence, such traits have always been the  essence of Shelley's iconic figure; Svenson expertly understands and embodies such.

Robert Foxworth is an excellent, credible Victor; Susan Strasberg is an on-target Elizabeth. The auspicious John Karlen, of Curtis' ""Dark Shadows"", is also featured. (Incidentally, he and Foxworth offer commentary on the DVD release.) In a twist of casting, a lovely blonde replaces the blind man/hermit, and the result is uniquely engaging, touching.

In addition to Karlen's presence, those who fancy ""Dark Shadows"" will appreciate the production's overall, unpretentious feel. (For those in the know, ""Dark Shadows"" actually tackled Shelley's themes with its ""Adam/Eve"" storyline.)  This version also sports Robert Cobert's distinctive music, which further invokes a ""Dark Shadows"" aura. (In the same vein, fans of Curtis' ""Jekyll/Hyde"" and ""Dorian Gray"" will feel at home with this ""Frankenstein"". Fans of the BBC, Louis Jourdan ""Count Dracula"" will also find it worth while.)

If one has a hankering for classic monsters and good, old-fashioned horror retellings, Dan Curtis ""Frankenstein"" is a must to view and own. Simply put, they just don't make them like this anymore. A pity, indeed, but at least through this DVD release, one will have a chance to re-experience an example of a gothic story done right.",1196985600,20,1918,5.596551724137931
627546,5,6303320562,"In 1973 Dan(Dark Shadows)Curtis produced this made-for tv 2-part adaptation of FRANKENSTEIN for ABC's late night programming. Unfortunately,because the similar FRANKENSTEIN:THE TRUE STORY appeared on TV the same year in prime time with a stronger cast,the Dan Curtis version retreated to the shadows. So FRANKENSTEIN:TTS is the one everybody remembers. Thanks to video,we can see what we missed and it's very good! Robert Foxworth is a good Victor Frankenstein and Bo Svenson is a credible creature. This is not Mary Shelley's story,nor is it a mere copy of previous adaptations. Obviously low budget,but highly enjoyable.",1029283200,,622,5.557894736842106

7843968,4,6303320562,"An interesting adaptation that may not have the reputation or cast of the same year's other mini-series attempt titled ""Frankenstein: The True Story"" (sic), but it does have a sterling creature in Bo Svenson. Whatever technical shortcomings this may have relative to that one are wiped clean by Svenson and the fact that this is far closer to the book despite the title the other film carries.",1488499200,,393,4.880597014925373

7843972,4,6303320562,"I don't like this movie as much as I wanted or hope. It appears to be on videotape instead of film, and the sets or scenery aren't that elaborate. And it just gives a feeling or aura or staleness. Although I do approve of it making the monster able to talk. The Universal Studio's monster didn't talk much. I enjoyed Dan Curtis's Dracula more than this Frankenstein. The True Story Of Frankenstein is a lot better, which is also from '70s.",1396569600,,439,4.432098765432099
7843973,5,6303320562,"The most sensitive Frankenstein I have ever viewed.  The cast is good, but Bo Svenson as The Giant, is really good.  You root for him.  You feel for him and you share his pain.",1392595200,,176,4.117647058823529
7843974,2,6303320562,"I had heard of this Dan Curtis production for many years, but had been unable to get my hands on it until recently. Being a huge fan of Dan Curtis' other productions (most notably the Kolchak films and Trilogy of Terror), I assumed I'd be in for the usual bag of old school chills. However, FRANKENSTEIN falls very short of what I'd come to expect from Curtis. I have come to the conclusion that Curtis is great with original, traditional gothic horror, but he is crappy at classic adaptations. I was underwhelmed by this version of Frankenstein as much as I was underwhelmed by Curtis' version of DRACULA with Jack Palance. (However, his version of DORIAN GRAY was decent.)

I won't waste time recapping the storyline. Rather, I'll get right to my issues with the film. As the first scene begins, an on-screen note tells us we are in the year 1856--and we assume we're supposed to be in Europe somewhere... And yet, everyone talks like they're from the U.S. in 1973, for the most part. The sets all look like stage plays. I realize that this look is something of a Trademark for the man responsible for years of DARK SHADOWS, but I expected production values at least on par with THE NIGHT STALKER, THE NIGHT STRANGLER or THE NORLESS TAPES.

I realize that much of the novel, particularly the brilliantly dismal conclusion, could not be adequately rendered in this production probably due to budgetary (and technological) limitations. But even so, a stage-set for an underground cavern or some such is a very poor substitute for the icy and glacial waters on which the Monster (referred to as ""the Giant"" in this film) meets his end in Shelly's novel.

I have lots of mad love and respect for Dan Curtis in his reverence for traditional gothic horror. His sets are always spooky looking, and no one plays spookier music than his guy Robert Cobert. But I think taking on Frankenstein was a bit more than he could adequately chew. This effort shows some heart but little else.",1374883200,2,1975,4.669540229885057
