4709600,5,B002PSLXPG,"""Ballast"", writer/director Lance Hammer's low-budget Indie darling, is a slice of life, profound in it's realistic approach to simple, good people facing adversity. Without blabbing away the plot, our 3 central characters have their own individual issues, all of which collide and provide a new understanding among them. Marlee (the excellent Tarra Reed) shows great range of emotion; loving mother, scorned wife, a woman of integrity. Her young son, James, (JimMyron Ross), still craving the attention of an absent father, finds himself caught up in the nave world of peer pressure and drugs. Lawrence (Michael J. Smith) is reeling over the suicide of his twin brother, James' father. Suspicion, confusion and mild deceit color the interaction of the three, leading to a sensible resolve. I'm glad I had the opportunity to rent the DVD, after all the awards it's received. The widescreen transfer is quite fine, showing a desolate landscape, which is a character in itself. The cinematography is quite fine. The fact that the story revolves around African-Americans is incidental; these characters could be of any color, since their issues are universal. Highly recommended!",1258848000,8,1175,5.356756756756757
4709601,5,B002PSLXPG,"Like the debris of Hurricane Katrina scattered in the fields of this rural Mississippi setting, the lives of the three central characters of this wonderful film have been shattered by forces beyond their control. A mother tries to rescue her boy from the dangerous influence of some nasty drug dealers, while a man reels from the suicide of his twin brother, who is also her ex-husband. Under grim winter skies, the emotional distances between them - anger, fear, distrust, lost hopes - verge on despair and then careen away from disaster, as the three tentatively reach out to a resolution that involves each other.

It's an alarming and saddening portrayal of lives slipping through safety nets and, by a kind of miracle of circumstances and determination, saving themselves, one day at a time. Filmmaker Lance Hammer uses hand-held cameras and an elliptical style of editing to heighten the urgency in the characters' situations. Performances are restrained and remarkable, especially JimMyron Ross, who plays the boy with a sullen silence that betrays the terror and confusion that his character is trying to hide. The DVD includes three improvisational scenes in which the actors explore their characters' relationships. Deserves every award it has won.",1258675200,11,1258,5.227722772277228
4709602,5,B002PSLXPG,"""Ballast,""  a double prize winner at the Sundance Film Festival, takes place in the Mississippi delta and focuses on three people affected by a tragedy.  Lawrence (Michael J. Smith, Jr.) is grief-stricken after the loss of his twin brother.  Twelve-year-old James (JimMyron Ross) is starting to encounter the drug culture of local teenagers, and his single mother, Marlee (Tarra Riggs), is too exhausted from her low-paying job to see the clues.  Writer/director/editor Lance Hammer tells his story episodically, providing glimpses into these lives and tracing how they intertwine with one another.
 Hammer worked for months in rehearsal with his mostly untrained actors and the performances are extremely natural.  The film is sparse on dialogue, strong on visuals.  Hammer knows how to present a narrative with his camera and let incidents build an overall portrait of his characters.  As editor, he lingers on a scene so the viewer can take in facial expressions, reactions, and thought processes.  ""Ballast"" is available in both DVD and Blu-ray.  Special features include a making-of featurette, theatrical trailer, and a critical essay.",1258416000,5,1141,5.431818181818182
4709603,4,B002PSLXPG,"""Ballast"" is a small independent movie that was shot with primarily nonprofessional actors.  Set in a rural area of the Mississippi Delta, the film focuses on Lawrence (Michael K. Smith, Sr.), a 30-something African-American man who lives on the same property as his twin brother.  In the opening scene, a neighbor visits Lawrence, who is in a near catatonic state and won't respond; he's clearly experienced some kind of trauma.  Slowly, we learn the back story and the relationships between the other characters who drift into the movie.  This is a slice of life not often examined in movies - the realistic lives of poor African Americans in one of the most down-trodden areas of the country.

The movie is extremely low-key and slow paced.  Likewise, the acting is often flat and doesn't always feel genuine (the extras show how the scenes were rehearsed and sometimes improved with the cast).  However, ""Ballast"" overall does feel shockingly genuine, and even though it focuses on depressing issues the movie manages to be fairly uplifting without feeling manipulative.  First-time director Lance Hammer has managed to tell an original American story that despite its pace is quite captivating.  The film was nominated for and won various indie film awards, including a win at the Sundance Film Festival for Best Directing (Dramatic).  ""Ballast"" reminded me a bit in tone and content of another recent indie hit, ""Frozen River,"" and I think it will appeal to a similar audience.",1258070400,12,1483,5.065843621399177

8474794,5,B002PSLXPG,"Ballast is a masterpiece, not only in its cinematography and acting, but of a masterpiece in a genre of film that lets the viewer in to the world of the main characters without being forced by conventional means.  You do actually feel all the emotions of the acting ensemble because Lance Hammer deliberately gives you their grief in subtle ways that you never feel outside of the story looking in.  You're always right there with the actors.  This film is a somber, melancholic attempt at patching things up between black working poor families in rural Mississippi in winter, each having  to struggle on their own until forced together by tragic circumstances.  It is a film of hope: That things can get better for people who reach out to pull one another from the bad choices we make in life.  The twelve year old boy James, played so well by JImMyron Ross causes us to understand what he must be going through in his world of isolation, loneliness, drugs and peer groups.  His mother works all day, everyday, never around to see what's going on in her son's life, but always extending deep love to him, which in itself reassures us that maybe James will make one day.  Lawrence, James' neighbor and relative (his father's brother) endures the harshest life of them all, and still, hope and love counteract his self destructive ideals.  The ending of the film is so moving and emotionally intelligent as we see the car drive off, first without Lawrence, then with all three as the camera remains on James' face as he stares at the bleak but beautiful landscape of barren crop fields and marshy swamp.  A tear rolled down my face.",1486425600,,1631,4.671328671328672

8474797,1,B002PSLXPG,"Wasted my 4 dollars seeing this. If I did not have a film class requiring me to view this bore of a film, I wouldn't have even bothered! Extreme use of the handheld camera and over the shoulder distant view. The lighting was always soft light as with realism movies. I could not comprehend how this is a good story. It is essentially racist at best. If they were so broke, then how the Nike shoes and sherpa jacket? Are we supposed to believe they got it in a thrift store? On the other hand, the film is VERY slow paced with a boring introduction. I do not think that the movie is great at all.",1455321600,,595,4.137931034482759
8474798,2,B002PSLXPG,"I was shocked at how much positive feedback this movie received.  The acting was okay, the character development missing and what was there was bleak boring and un realistic.  The blue and grey filter over everything is overdone, I see it all the time.  The fact this movie was directed by a white person is almost borderline racist, and I feel that the entire character relationships reflect how a white middle class, privileged person would view this subject matter.  I look to a movie like Mississipi Burning which really dives into the subject matter and take a stance as well as tells a story. Or the the movie Fresh, which deals with a similar premise however the plot of both of those movies is thoughtful, and worthy of a movie.  This movie's plot really disappointed me.  It may be realism or minimalism or whatever it is supposed to defend itself by grabbing on to but the story was very shallow.  I felt the romance between the brother and his own twin brothers babes mother was predictable.  Again a disappointing movie all around, sorry.",1389657600,3,1050,4.699453551912568

8474800,2,B002PSLXPG,"I rented Ballast due to all of the awards and glowing reviews. But I found it so ridden with clichs, stereotypes and implausibilities that I couldn't even suspend disbelief, much less bring myself to rave about it.

The minimalist plot centers around three characters: Marlee (Tarra Riggs), the single mother with a history of drug addiction; her troubled son James (JimMyron Ross), who dabbles with drugs and guns; and the boy's catatonically depressed uncle Lawrence (Micheal J. Smith). Although the setting of a poverty-stricken African-American family in the Mississippi Delta is unusual in film, the central plot is entirely conventional: Lonely souls brought together by tragedy. But mostly, we get long, sad and bitter silences. Even an excellent performance by Riggs cannot overcome the lack of character development; none of these three are multi-dimensional enough to elicit audience connection.

What little action does occur is implausible. One moment, a gang of dangerous drug dealers is set to kill James over a $100 debt; the next, these rogues have mysteriously disappeared and are never seen again. Equally inexplicable is the ending. The film suddenly just ends, in mid-stride.

After finding myself so uncharacteristically at odds with the mainstream accolades, I scoured the reviews to find anyone whose take was remotely similar to mine. I finally found film critic Armond White's review in the New York Press, which hit the nail on the head by calling Ballast ""an African-American indie film fantasy made for white liberals"":

""You have to see through these ludicrous black phantoms to the actual white middle-class fantasies at the film's core.... Ballast demonstrates exactly how movies condition knee-jerk responses to black pathology.... It's simply another calling-card movie establishing the director's credentials.... African-American life is imprisoned by the art fallacies of Indie filmmaking, controlled by white liberal condescension.""

Much as I wanted to like this movie, I couldn't. The two stars is for Riggs's acting. I hope the film gives the actors - especially Riggs -- much-deserved visibility for future success.",1319932800,5,2155,5.478915662650603

8474802,4,B002PSLXPG,"The acting, character development in this movie is excellent. I left one star off because the ending didn't seem to bring closure in my opinion, a little too abrupt;although, the atmosphere of the movie seems to allow for that.",1272153600,,227,4.846153846153846
