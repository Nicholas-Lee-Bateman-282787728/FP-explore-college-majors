This Doctor Who episode Carnival of Monsters is a `busy' production with a lot going on, as well as being rather ambitious on the SFX front. The Doctor and Jo are supposedly on fun jaunt to Metebelis Three, when they find themselves on a cargo boat heading to Bombay India in the mid-1920s (or should we now say Mumbai) We later find out they are inside a machine called `Miniscope'.

The Miniscope holds various living organisms (in miniaturized form) in set environmental enclosures that replicate their original environments or home worlds. It seems that the `inhabitants' are not aware of their situation, as time for them is in a perpetual loop. While the Doctor and his assistant are immune to the time loop; they have their adventures inside machine. However, the events inside the Miniscope are interwoven, cleverly, with events outside the Miniscope involving its current owners. Both are, rather colourful, travelling carnival people Vorg and his subordinate Shirna, who have just arrived on the planet of Inter Minor but are distrusted and refused entrance by a three-member tribunal. The tribunal picks up on the fact that entities removed from the Miniscope soon return to their regular size - in some cases with terrifying results. When Vorg extracts an artefact stuck in the electrical structure it turns out to be the TARDIS - from the Miniscope. Add to this layer of narrative, a further sub plot involving two of the tribunal members, who are disgruntled with the leadership of their planet, and who conspire to let the Drashigs (in my humble opinion a rather nasty alien tapeworm) abscond from the Miniscope and allow them to inflict chaos, the hopeful resultant being ensuing calamity and the president's resignation.

What's good about this production is the sheer ambitious nature of the whole project. I would have loved to be a fly on the wall when they storyboarded the project. Yes I would agree that some of SFX seems dated - but the Miniscope is very well imagined and the filming depicting the internal electrical circuitry is rather well done. We see the appearance of Fourth Doctor companion, Harry Sullivan as cargo ships officer. There is interesting exchange when Vorg attempts to speak to the Doctor in Polari, vernacular common in carnival people. Even the Inter Minor officials are interesting, as there is clearly shown a subservient peoples catering to their more mundane and labour intensive work. The officials are clearly seen as being rather xenophobic and not liking the idea of their planet receiving outsiders, a subject that was very topical in the Britain of the 1970s and in a way reflective of certain attitudes today.

All in all this is a rather enjoyable four part episode, from the tenth series.",1421539200,,2768,4.997830802603037

735217,4,6303943322,"Here's yet another classic Doctor Who story that was re-released before all the other classic stories have been made available.  2|entertain wants your money, but this is one of the few re-releases that I feel may be worth it.

As always, I'm not going to give a synopsis of the story itself. If you don't know the story by now, there are plenty of other reviewers who will tell you all about it ad nauseam. Rather, I'm going to focus on what I believe will help you decide if this product is worthy of your hard earned wages by reviewing the extras which, in my opinion, can make or break a purchase.

DVD Audio Commentary - There are two of these, and I Love it!  The first one features actress Katy Manning, and producer Barry Letts.  Miss you Barry.  And then there's a second one.  The following people come and go from episode to episode, but the whole list consists of Cheryl Hall / (Shirma), Jenny McCracken / (Claire Daly), Peter Haliday / (Pletrac), Terrance Dicks / (Script Editor), and Brian Hodgson / credited as (Special Sound).  Unfortunately, this second commentary is moderated by Toby Hadoke, who of course had nothing to do with the making of this story in any way whatsoever, so his intrusion into this commentary is personally unwanted by me.  I wish the moths that ate his Doctor Who scarf would have then flown down his throat and eaten his larynx.

Text Commentary - This is different from the previous version.  As I mentioned in a prior review, it irritates me that on occasion when a story is re-released with a new audio commentary, the old one is usually included. So why didn't they do that with the old text version as well?  Call me greedy, but I want it all.

""Episode 2 - Early Edit"" - This is self explanatory.  Unless you ran two of these DVD's on two different monitors at the same time, you may not get a lot out of this.  Some scenes are edited out, and some scenes are moved to episode 3.  This is mildly interesting, but not something to make you ""stop everything.""

""Behind the Scenes"" is a short series of clips of what happens off camera.  It's too bad that this is so short because I personally could have appreciated more clips.

""Visual Effects Models"" is just under nine minutes of... you guessed it.  It`s fun, sometimes silly, and also educational to those interested in this type of material.

""Five Faces of Doctor Who"" - I'm not sure why this is included.  This is a promo for said same show.  Completely unnecessary.

""Director's Amended Ending"" is also self explanatory.

""CSO Demo"" is a short demo featuring producer Barry Letts as he puts forth the benefits of CSO in Doctor Who.  From a production point of view, it is interesting to see these early tests which were regularly used in the series, as well as countless others.

TARDIS cam no. 2 is a computer generated scene which offers nothing of consequence.

BUT WAIT!  THE SECOND DISC HAS EVEN MORE!

""Destroy All Monsters"" is a somewhat humorous ""making of"" this story.  Barry Letts, Terrance Dicks, and Katy Manning are some of the contributors to this piece which I highly recommend you watch.

""On Target with Ian Marter"" - Many people associate Ian Marter as Harry Sullivan, one of the 4th Doctor's companions.  Yet many people forget that he has a role in this story as well as Lt. John Andrews, or the fact that he novelized 9 of the classic stories.  This wonderful piece tributes Ian, and some of the contributors include Tom Baker, Elisabeth Sladen, miss you Lis, Terrance Dicks and Nicholas Courtney, miss you Nick.  I humbly suggest that if you don't watch this, then you are missing out on a vital part of Doctor Who history.

""The A-Z of Gadgets and Gizmos"" - This has nothing to do with the story, but it's a fun piece of Doctor Who Gadgetry.  Watch it, enjoy it, and if you have to complain, you can leave a comment below this interview.

""Mary Celeste"" is a piece on maritime history regarding missing ships.  I personally found this to be historically interesting.  Please check it out.

Do I need to hit the nail with a hammer by saying this has more extras than most people know what to do with.  Quantity is not necessarily quality, and I dare say that it seems that they tried to pack the first disc full of extras just for the sake of packing it full of extras.  But, the second disc makes up for the Adipose FAT, which is why I'm giving this a rating of 4  Screeching Drashigs.  If you have to decide on the 2003 release and this one, I say spend the few extra buck and get this one.  MY BOTTOM LINE is that this is A MUST HAVE to anyone of the classic Doctor Who series, Barry Letts, John Pertwee, and Katy Manning.  And who doesn't love Katy?

I hope that this review was helpful to you, and please feel free to express your opinion(s) on my review so that I can hopefully improve upon my future ones.  Thank you for taking the time to read this, and hopefully, consider my humble opinion(s).",1338508800,15,4930,4.479236812570146
735218,5,6303943322,"I'll admit I can a bit late to the whole Doctor Who craze.  Like most folks in America (my side of the pond, as it were), Tom Baker was the first real Doctor.  This isn't to say that I was unaware of the three who came before; rather, it's only to say, at that point, the whole franchise came together for me in a persona I could more fully appreciate, who didn't seem to English-stuffy, and who brought the kind of warmth and whimsy so often displayed in Doctors who've played the role since.  Do I have a favorite Doctor Who?  Why, of course, I do!  But that isn't the purpose of this review.

CARNIVAL OF MONSTERS comes from the Jon Pertwee years, and the story - much like so many tales from early Who - actually respectfully delves into a whole host of matters so common attributed to quality science fiction.  It explores class structure - government - social disorder - multiple worlds - the technology of shrunken worlds - and almost Matrix-like existence as the Doctor and his companion Jo (played with suitable aplomb by Katy Manning) find themselves trapped inside a Miniscope, a device that shrinks whole environments and the peoples and creatures who populate them, all for the purpose of providing viewing entertainment for others.  It becomes a race-against-time as the peepshow device begins to fail, leaving the Doctor's companion stuck inside and facing death unless he can find a way to rescue her from it before the circuits fail.

I could go on and on discussing the plot and the various delightful shenanigans pulled by the traveling showman, Vorg, and his assistant Shirna (Cheryl Hall) - notice the similarities?  An older gentleman with a youngish attractive girl at his side? - as well as dissecting the endless parallels between the story on the outside of the peepshow box and the story on the inside, but what really matters here is that it's quintessential Doctor Who.  It's a terrific yarn built on an interesting premise, and it's all detailed with entertaining characters.  It's certainly one of the better pre-Tom-Baker episodes I've ever seen, and I'll definitely watch it again in the future.

However, what I really wanted to rave about here were the special features, which are downright amazing given the fact that what we're dealing with here is a television production nearly forty years old as of the writing of this review.  Despite the age of the piece, the BBC has provided two separate audio commentary tracks - each hosting both onscreen and behind-the-screen talents - and they stories they detail are as vivid as if it all happened yesterday.  There's an honest, appreciable love of the Who franchise by those given the opportunity to play in that universe, and I listened to both with great delight.  Granted, there was an awful lot of crossover material - I can't tell you the number of times it was discussed that Mr. Pertwee loved to `lift' personal souvenirs from the soundstage and location shoots - but it was still all told with great respect and genuine warmth.

But ... the extras don't stop there!

There's also a wonderful notation track that runs the length of the four episodes.  This is a function track - much like a subtitling feature - that is turned on and off by the viewer, and the notes detail interesting trivia and tidbits not only associated to the filming process, but it also goes into incredible behind-the-scenes facts including direct quotations of scenes edited from the shooting script and never filmed!  Some of what's learned is minor, but there's a great amount of detail here - it's all told very much in the fashion of MTV's `Pop Up Video' from several years back - and it's equally as charming as the audio commentaries.

But ... it doesn't stop there!

There's a restored edit of the second episode.  It's longer than the one that aired originally on the BBC, and it inserts several short bits that expand slightly the socio-political themes still present but given short exposure in the entirety of the CARNIVAL.  Furthermore, the discs come with a `making of' featurette that cobbles together the best moments discussed in greater detail on the commentaries; there's a feature detailing many of the Doctor's favorite weapons and gadgets throughout the entire run of the television show; there's a host of photo galleries and model shots; and there's even a short video exploring the more famous maritime ship disappearances, a theme central to the main story for these installments.  All-in-all, it's an incredible collection of material involving actors, craftsmen, and other creative personnel like rarely seen before and certainly hard-to-come-by for a television production almost forty years ago!

I'll give a special shout out to the short feature on actor Ian Marter.  He appears in a supporting role in CARNIVAL, but he returns as a completely different companion during Tom Baker's run.  Mr. Marter was so enmeshed in the Doctor Who universe that he even authored several novel adaptations of episodes that aired, and this 20-minute documentary looks back at one of Who's early key players who left us long before he should have.

It's an amazing experience that comes from BBC and BBC Warner.  The disc is professionally produced, with both visuals and audios solid.

HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  If you're a Who fan, then you owe it to yourself and fandom to experience this Special Edition collection from start-to-finish.  If you're not a Who fan but you've thought about jumping aboard to see what all the fuss is about, then this could as well be the disc you've been waiting for.  It's easily enough to jump aboard this delightful journey in mid-stream, and Pertwee - while a bit stiff for my tastes - does a great turn as the Doctor.  If you've absolutely no interest in Doctor Who ... then what are you doing still reading my review at this point?  Get off your tuckuss, and get out there to buy a copy, watch this, and I guarantee you'll join the club!

In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at BBC Warner provided me with a DVD screener copy of DOCTOR WHO: CARNIVAL OF MONSTERS (Special Edition) for the expressed purposes of completing this review.",1336521600,5,6200,4.837121212121212
735219,5,6303943322,"I would really like to hear the explanation from BBC video (or 2|Entertain) as to why there are so many Double-dips lately! (My theory: now that we are nearing the end of what there is left to release, they are trying to fill in the gaps, so that there are at least two per release date--this is presumably for two reasons; one, to keep their revenue stream up and two, to keep Doctor Who ""active"" on the release schedule until the 50th anniversary next year. But this is just IMHO.)

Although, as I write this, the current asking price for a new copy is over $60.00 for a 1 disc edition and almost $30.00 for a used copy.

Presumably, the new disc one will be identical to the old edition and disc two will be additional special/supplemental material--but time will tell. You should do your research before biting. As news of this release becomes more widely known, the price of the previous version should drop and you should not have to pay a premium for either one.

Who knows, for those prices, I may just sell my old copy but, I want to be sure that there isn't something that will fail to make it from the last release to this one.

If you haven't purchased this story yet, but want to, this is a very good time for you and you can bide your time for a more opportune moment (price-wise). If you're a completist and already have the almost-nine-year-old edition, it is not.

735255,5,6303943322,"""The Carnival of Monsters"" is most definitely not a ""Doctor Who"" classic. It's average and run-of-the-mill. Nothing about it really stands out and grabs your attention. And that's exactly what I loved about it. Classics are all very fine and well, but this storyline demonstrates the show's ability to reliably and consistently tell a good story and entertain in a more low key, week-to-week register--probably more of a factor in the show's longevity than a handful of interspersed peaks anyway, and in any case peaks aren't peaks without the context of level ground.

One great thing about this storyline is that it works very well on several different levels. The most basic is plain adventure: the Doctor and Jo being mistaken for stowaways on a British steamship or being chased by viciously carnivorous monsters and such. Stuff even the kiddies can get into. Then there is the fine and inventive sci-fi storytelling that keeps us guessing: why are the Doctor and Jo on a steamship in 1926 when sensors show they are on another planet in another time entirely? The longer they're there, the more things don't add up. And how does all this relate to the itinerant entertainers' problems on Inter Minor with officious bureaucrats and restrictive immigration procedures? To see these various mysteries gradually resolved as all the unraveled strands come together makes for a somewhat more sophisticated enjoyment. And then the amusing social satire definitely appeals to the adults, for who among us hasn't had their time wasted and been exasperated to distraction by mediocre, paper-pushing tyrants? ""Office"" and ""officious"" are cognates for a reason.

Yet the story functions on a deeper level still as an extended exploration of the various means by which we objectify, dehumanize, and exploit others. The Inter Minor bureaucrats are of course key here, both for their use, or abuse rather, of the Functionaries as slave labor and the manner in which they justify this to themselves in terms of the old superiority/inferiority dichotomy, and for their blatant xenophobia and condescending attitudes towards ""outsiders""--as less civilized, as dirty and diseased, as aggressive and hostile, the standard stereotypes. But the two Lurman entertainers (with wonderfully gaudy outfits, by the way) bearing the brunt of Inter Minorian xenophobia are just as guilty in their own way, chiefly through their habit of capturing other intelligent lifeforms and imprisoning them in the Miniscope for display, all to make a quick buck. Also, it's not emphasized much, but they did come to Inter Minor in the first place counting on an unsophisticated and easily bilked audience, after all. Appropriately, the Doctor tells both of them off when he finally gets out of the miniscope (the 1926 steamship was, it turns out, one of the exhibits therein). Speaking of the latter, it can surely be no coincidence that of all the historical settings conceivable to the writer, he chose a British ship on its way to India; if xenophobia has an inward twist of isolationism, it also has an outward twist of imperialism.

So, in the very best traditions of science fiction, ""Carnival of Monsters"" operates across a broad spectrum of sophistication levels all at once, proving that entertaining and thought-provoking need not be mutually exclusive antonyms. Imaginative costumes and sets, fine acting, and little touches of humor help things along, too. This indeed is the kind of stuff that keeps people watching ""Doctor Who"" week after week, year after year, generation after generation--or should I say, regeneration after regeneration?",1173052800,2,3619,5.214776632302406

There are commentary tracks, but for some reason, my player wouldn't work in that mode.  The DVD transfer is of above average quality, but somehow the deleted scenes looked better.  Go figure.  The audio quality is also above average.  I had no trouble understanding any of the spoken dialogue.  The photo gallery is nice; I was really surprised to see the way Katy Manning hadn't aged one iota--she truly is a beautiful woman.  There is also a small behind the scenes clip that shows just how much work went into the production of just one scene from the series, another reason we fans should be grateful to the creative architects who helmed the series over the years.  There are even a couple of hidden features that showcase an extneded opening sequence and some guy counting backwards from 30.  As for the story itself, Carnival was never one of my favorites from the Pertwee era, which is why the four stars instead of five.

Meanwhile, the Doctor and Jo take their first independent flight of the TARDIS, and instead of landing on Metebelis 3, end up on 4 June 1926, aboard the SS Bernice, en route from England to Bombay.  The Doctor senses something is wrong and he is right, as a plesiosaurus appears from the ocean.  They are captured as stowaways, but once locked in, Jo and the Doctor notices that it was 7:35 PM when they were shut in.  A few minutes later, it is 6:40 PM!  Also, it's broad daylight outside instead of dark.  The best cliffhanger is the end of Episode 1, when a giant hand plucks the TARDIS away from the SS Bernice.
By Episode 2, it's clear that the miniscope and the SS Bernice are connected, and regarding that, the Doctor marvels at the output and input lines, circuits, saying ""It's like walking around inside a wristwatch,"" and the colourful set, with its pilars, red bulbs, shiny chrome-like walkways is a design triumph.
Another design triumph are the screaming caterpillar-like Drashigs.  As Vorg says of these ferocious monsters, ""the most evil, the most vicious, and undoubtedly the most frightening form of life in the whole universe!""  They are the beasties on the cover, BTW.
Race relations is a big theme here.  On Inter Minor, there are two races, the more humanoid elite and the crude-looking and less intelligent Functionaries, who are getting more rebellious.  KKalik is worried that the Functionaries will eventually take over due to Zarb's liberal policies.  Orum says of the Functionaries, ""No sense of responsibility.  Give them a hygiene chamber and they store fossil fuel in it.""  And the elite refer themselves in the neutral person:  ""One must do this"" or ""One believes that..."" etc. is interesting.  Their first contact with Vorg and Shirna leads to Pletrac talking down to them:  ""We give magic talk disks back.  All very good.""  Shirna sarcastically tells Vorg, ""You tellem tall fella we talk like him pretty good by and by.""  And Vorg says of the Tellurians (Earth people) that they all look so much alike.  But Vorg's purpose to amuse ties back to the Functionaries, whose lack of entertainment is causing their rebelliousness, according to Pletrac.
A few continuity goofs:  the calendar structure aboard the SS Bernice is that of the 1925 calendar.  And the micrograph Vorg gives Pletrac is nothing more than an ordinary music cassette!  And Fred Astaire is mentioned seven years before he became famous.  Bad editing in Episode 2 leads to a previously unseen segment shown before a scene shown in Episode 1.
The supporting players are all first rate, especially Tenniel Evans as Major Daly, a typical friendly pukka sahib-type.  Ironically, Evans worked with Jon Pertwee in the British radio comedy The Navy Lark back in the 50's.  Veteran actor Leslie Dwyer (Vorg) steals the show, with firm support from Cheryl Hall (Shirna).  Ian Marter (Andrews) later became a regular in the Tom Baker Who years as Harry Sullivan.
""Our purpose is to amuse, simply amuse.  Nothing political,"" says Vorg.  What I hope Predator did for hunting, showing what it feels like  man to be the hunted animal, I hope Carnival Of Monsters will do for zoos.  But the concept of overcoming isolation-induced xenophobia and prejudice is key here, and despite not appearing, President Zarb is a well-felt presence due to his liberalism.  Rating:  4.5, rounded to 5.",1068076800,2,4222,5.011494252873563
735261,3,6303943322,"""Carnival of Monsters"" is an odd little story, and probably not the best candidate to be the second Third Doctor (Jon Pertwee) story released on DVD.  But the ""Restoration Team"" has done a rather good job on the disc, as with all ""Doctor Who"" discs, so that even the less-than-outstanding stories are still worth the purchase price.
I've watched this story at least half-a-dozen times since I was twelve years old, but it was only this time out that I noticed the political subtext.  Story writer Robert Holmes always crammed politics into his busy scripts, and maybe the fact that I never ""got"" this story explained why I had such a dim opinion of it.  I knew, for example, that the squabbling political functionaries of Inter Minor -- bald, grey-skinned creatures, in that great ""Doctor Who"" tradition of having three character actors portray an entire alien species -- were supposed to be funny.  What I didn't ""get"" was that they were supposed to mirror not only the declining British Empire of the day, but also the colonial British sailors stuck in a perpetual 1926 evening inside the device that gives the story its name.
At least, I learned that from the production notes feature.  I also learned the string of acting credits for every guest actor in the story, and also the dates of filming for every outdoor location scene.  As always, I'd prefer production notes that gave a little more substantial information about the episode on disc and its context within the larger ""Doctor Who"" picture -- not just lists of TV shows that I, in the US, have never heard of.  But at least I did come away with something.
The commentary track this time out, by story producer/director Barry Letts, and actress Katy Manning (companion Jo) is a little bit better than some of the recent disasters we've had (""Tomb of the Cybermen"" springs to mind).  Both commentators spent a lot of time with the show and this is the first DVD for each.  Unfortunately, it took a lot of time for them to get to the meat and potatoes.
Also thrown in the special features is model test footage that's just downright funny -- you can see the smirking face of the Drashig puppeteer, for example.  I'm less certain about the recurring ""Tardis-CAM"" featurettes, but maybe one day I'll figure out what they're here for.  The lone easter egg allows you to see the Pertwee-era opening credits, without the actual credits.
The best part of this story, unwittingly, is long-time DW  character actor Michael Wisher, here playing the most evil of the Inter Minor politicos.  He suspects the Carnival of Monsters as being the invasion spearhead of alien spies (the harmless two carnies who arrive on Inter Minor by cargo class).  He lets off several great over-the-top political rants... and sounds just like George W. Bush.",1064016000,5,2789,4.783333333333333
735262,4,6303943322,"After getting several classic Doctor Who episodes on DVD, the time has come to revisit the Pertwee era, and for this outing, we're treated to 'Carnival of Monsters.'
Often regarded as a curiosity between the fan-favorite stories 'The Three Doctors' and 'Frontier In Space,' this story actually has a lot going for it, and is given the full treatment on this new DVD release.
The story has been carefully restored and remastered, and, as a first, is finally presented in the way it was originally broadcast. The previous videotape version had some curiosities about it, namely the early edit of episode two, which featured some additional, non-broadcast material and a different arrangement of the traditional theme music. Additionally, when the story was repeated in 1981, the director, Barry Letts, requested a reedit of part 4 and got it - so the original hasn't been seen for ages! Don't let that put you off though; it's been polished and shined and I can only guess that it's never looked as good!
All the material from that early edit of episode 2 has been preserved here in the form of extras: you get a title sequence using the aborted 'Delaware' theme, deleted scenes, and also a presentation of the edited ending. That's not all though, as there's a great commentary from actress Katy Manning (Jo) and Director/Producer Barry Letts. Katy is obviously having a great time watching it and provides lots of humor, while Barry reveals quite a lot of behind-the-scenes info. There's also the now-standard pop-up production notes (one of my favorite parts of the whole line), a Who's Who section for information on the actors, a fascinating actual look at the shooting of the story from 1972, test footage of the visual effects, a photo gallery...plus even more. This disc is packed to the gills, and contains everything you'd like to have, and some things you probably didn't even know about.
All in all, it will make a great addition to your growing Doctor Who DVD library. If you hadn't thought about this one before, the fantastic extras more than make the difference, as they reveal some rare behind-the-scenes info, and a chance to see the story as it was originally intended.",1060560000,5,2186,4.879032258064516
735263,2,6303943322,"This was the second story in the 1972-73 season 10 and was first transmitted on  the 27th January 1973.  In this tale, The 3rd Doctor (Jon Pertwee) and Jo Grant (Katie Manning) materialize in the TARDIS on what appears to be a cargo ship in the Indian Ocean in the 1920's.  Unfortunately for them they are actually inside a ""miniscope"" which is a banned piece of equipment that ""snatches"" whole areas and people out of time and stores them in a perpetual time-loop for the amusement of paying visitors.  This particular miniscope along with its collection of exhibits is the property of a pair of entertainers named Vorg and Shirna who have brought the device to the planet Inter Minor in order to make money displaying their captives.
The Doctor realizes something is wrong and manages to escape from his particular exhibit and enter another ""world"" populated by the flesh eating Drashigs.  Fleeing from the carnivorous creatures, the doctor manages to get into the inner workings of the machine and reach the outside, but is unfortunately pursued by the hungry monsters.  Just to complicate matters, two Minorians attempt to use the escaping Drashigs in an attempt to overthrow the planet's president and seize power for themselves.  Emerging from the machine causes the Doctor and the giant Drashigs to grown to normal size and it is left to the Doctor and Vorg to destroy them and prevent the overthrow of the planet's rightful leader...
Out of all of the Jon Pertwee episodes that could have been released on DVD, I would have placed this one near the bottom of the list.  The story is boring, the acting is terrible, the costumes are laughable and the effects are dreadful.  Jon Perwee, of course, gives his usual sterling performance and Katie Manning is as cute as ever, however it's not enough to turn this into an entertaining story.  One interesting point to note is the appearance of Ian Marter who would later go on to star as Harry Sullivan in the early Tom Baker stories and even write a few of the target Dr Who novels based on the transmitted stories.
Technical notes:  The Doctor Who Restoration Team has again done an excellent job cleaning up the existing prints and removing as many glitches and scratchs as was possible.  The disc is full of extra features including a commentary track by Katie Manning (Jo Grant) and Barry Letts (Director and Producer), deleted scenes, behind the scenes footage, test effects for the Drashig puppets and the spacecraft, alternative theme music which was dropped, TARDIS Cam, a training guide to CSO (Green Screen) by Barry Letts, production sub-titles, a photo gallery and more.",1059177600,7,2635,4.857142857142857
735298,4,6303943322,"This episode brings back memories of staying up late on a Sunday night when I had to be up for school the next day. Our local non-profit TV station used to run all the seasons of Dr. Who. I would stay up and record the episodes.
In this particular episode, the Doctor and Jo, while en route to Metabelis 3, are caught in a gravitational field of a peculiar machine. This machine holds a number of creatures sustained in their own habitats, so you can imagine their bewilderment trying to figure out where in the world they are.
Like all Dr. Who episodes the effects are somewhat cheesy but that is what we have come to enjoy from Dr. Who. The plot line is pretty good but the makeup on a few of the characters is awful. All in all I enjoyed this episode as I knew I would. One drawback is that for ...they should have remastered the audio. It's still in 2.0 prologic which is the same as a video tape.

735300,5,6303943322,"It must be tough being a Star Trek fan. While they are given boxed set releases with meager extras, fans of the ever popular Doctor are treated to these marvelous single episode releases that feature intricate remastering and loads of bonus material. Carnival of Monsters, a popular story from the Third Doctor's era, lives up to the high standards set by previous releases both in terms of quality and value for money. The story itself is vastly entertaining, with an even paced plot that hinges on unfolding drama and great performances from all of the principal cast. It may be a little boring for the action minded types, but there's enough sharp dialogue and sci-fi mystery to keep the discriminating viewers thoroughly entertained. Surprisingly, the special effects also hold up well - though they're no comparison to the eye candy of modern CGI images of course. The mono sound is crisp and the remastered image is so rich and sharp you'd never know this was broadcast 30 years ago. If you need more than that, there's a wealth of DVD extras including an excellent commentary, a behind the scenes film, deleted and extended scenes, an alternate ending, promo materials, and more.
A highly recommended release.",1057276800,4,1216,4.9365853658536585
735301,5,6303943322,"This is my second favourite Dr Who adventure behind the Android Invasion with Tom Baker and Elizabeth Sladen but I like the double team of Jon Pertwee and Katy Manning a lot more.
The story is that the Doctor and Jo materialize inside a ship, the SS Bernice on the Indian Ocean in 1926. Jo thinks that they are still on Earth but the Doctor thinks even though they haven't reached their destination, Metebelis 3 that they are on one of the neighbouring planets. Jo gets upset when he won't admit that they are on Earth and he tells her it is impossible. In fact,the doctor later figures out that they are in a Miniscope. This scope is in fact on a planet called Inter Minor and the owner won it gambling and doesn't quite know much about it himself.
The Doctor and Jo keep going back to the ship and keep running into the crew and passengers, Major and his daughter. Jo notices that the crew and passengers keep repeating their words and behaviour which is risible and reminds me of Groundhog Day. Eventually the Doctor and Jo escape into the subterranean workings of the minsicope and end up outdoors. They then run into the ferocious Drashigs which are kind of like dinosaurs. After this, the doctor figures out that they can't go forward because they will go back to the ship and they can't go back they will re-encounter the Drashigs so they have to act laterally. Eventually the Doctor escapes from the Miniscope and plans a way to set free JO and all the other sentient lifeforms in the scope. He goes back inside the compression field of the scope and using the TARDIS he is successful in his plan.
The funny thing is when all the lifeforms are returned to their own times is that the Major who was reading a book said it was the longest book he ever read and his daughter suspected somewhere in her mind that something peculiar had happened but couldn't put her finger on it.
I bought the DVD and it has a commentary by the actress Katy Manning who played the Doctor's companion Josephine Grant. Great stuff. I recommend this to all Jon Pertwee and DR Who fans.",1032048000,,2069,4.461741424802111

Robert Holmes crafts another great story dealing with an alien machine that can hold a variety of alien settings in a zoolike format. The Doctor and Jo manage to become trapped inside the works and must make their way out. The best thing about Holmes' stories is that even if he has a thin plot, such as his Space Pirates from the Troughton era, he manages to fill the story with deep, rich characters that make it all interesting. But with Carnival of Monsters you get a great story and great characterization. A definite addition to the Who collector.",1024617600,,664,4.450819672131147
735303,3,6303943322,"Not the best third Doctor adventure by a long chalk but some interesting moments nevertheless.
The plot cleverly connects vignettes of different worlds with an ongoing story about the stupidity of bureaucracy with an addded barb or two against immigration policies generally.
The Timelord and his companion Jo find themselves on a ship which turns out to be one of a number of different environments replete with the indigenous inhabitants. As they attempt to escape from what is essentially an interstellar sideshow in which they are miniturized they come up against the various monsters while the bureaucratic wrangling goes on outside.
Not the best Doctor Who story but an interesting idea which could of and perhaps ought to have been a two part show.",1017878400,,755,5.096774193548387
735304,5,6303943322,"It's a pity that Doctor Who is underappreciated as a show with poignant messages. It's not like that all the time, and while it was always primarily intended to be entertainment, sometimes it leapt out with something to say. ""Carnival of Monsters"" preceeds ""The Truman Show"" by 25 years, yet has roughly the same message. Although Peter Weir's film is very good, all the ironies and ""social context"" messages seemed obvious - the reaches of television, the media and the basic voyeurism that lies in our dark personas. This Jon Pertwee tale is exactly the same, although in its day was not discussed as a treatise on television culture, even though it asks exactly the same questions - are we being watched, who is watching us and where do you draw the line between reality and entertainment. The Doctor and Jo wind up within a travelling peepshow - a boat in the Indian Ocean in 1926 in which the passengers, totally unaware of their predicament, play out the same acts, like a stuck gramophone record (or, according to today's terms, in constant action replay). The genius of Robert Holmes shines again, delivering not just a message (and avoiding the didactic way ""Star Trek"" always spells its concerns out to its audience) but a gripping story. The Doctor's gradual realisation of the situation, followed by his and Jo's attempts to escape from the Miniscope make for an adventure full of nail biting suspense. It is also fortunate that the Drashigs are excellently realised monsters. Except for a few scenes where the effects let them down (mainly when they attack the ship), the Drashigs are impressive, especially when one bursts out of the marsh at the end of episode two. ""Carnival of Monsters"" has everything. Suspense and terror (the Doctor and Jo wandering on the marsh plain before the monster appears is extremely tense, with a foreboding atmosphere that makes the viewer realise something WILL happen soon); clautrophobic scenes as the time travellers make their way through the machine's workings. There is also humour, in the form of Vorg and Shirna and, to a lesser extent, a subtle jab at bureaucracy in the form of the Inter Minor officials. (The subject of xenophobia is also presented, making this story a multi-message one indeed!) Michael Wisher is brilliant as the scheming Kalik (possibly his second best role after Davros). Terence Lodge as Orum is wonderfully sycophantic and viewers see Ian Marter for the first time, as Andrews (Marter would go on to become companion Harry Sullivan and then write very good novelisations of stories). So, whether you want a clever and subtle story on television, the watchers and the watched; or whether you want a well paced and exciting adventure, ""Carnival of Monsters"" should be your cup of tea.",973123200,3,2763,4.931330472103005
