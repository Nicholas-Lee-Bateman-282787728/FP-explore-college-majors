7861402,5,6304004745,"I love this hentai, it's one of the first I watched when I was in high school (Yeah I'm bad huh?) ..

It has a good, intriguing (but sort of sad!!) story! It also has good sex scenes, and has more than one female involved, although the main love interest is definitely Milfa the elf, which I like!

It's a bit short, but there is a sequel!! ^_^",1379462400,,344,4.044117647058823
7861403,5,6304004745,"My roommate owned the second episode on a blank disk so needless to say I didn't get to see the first half.  I saw it all when it arrived three days ago and I can honestly say this is an outstanding hentai.  The sex scenes are not too hardcore which I like, and the intamacy is nothing short of ""poetic.""  I really liked the character referred to as ""Grandma.""  There aren't a lot of tender hentai's out there besides End of Summer and The Story of Little Monica.  I paid a little over a hundred dollars for it, but I would've paid TWICE that for this little gem!  If you've got the money and you're over eighteen, why not treat yourself?",1250121600,,638,4.231404958677686
7861404,4,6304004745,"Mixed marriages are a tricky thing, so when the human Kenji and Milfa, an elf, get married, the course of true love does not run smoothly... especially when it turns out that there's a certain difference in plumbing that makes it almost impossible for them to consummate their marriages!",1128038400,,287,4.877551020408164
7861405,4,6304004745,"This one is odd.  This one human guy and elf get married.  During the wedding night, the guy discovers that his new wife has a ""very small opening"" and it won't fit.  So he goes out to try and get a harpy's lubricant. Except all of the harpy's  are sex crazed for humans.  As my friends and I put it, will he be able to  survive sex crazed harpy's and return to his wife faithfully.  I think not.  Don't worry that isn't the ending.",947721600,10,432,4.059523809523809
