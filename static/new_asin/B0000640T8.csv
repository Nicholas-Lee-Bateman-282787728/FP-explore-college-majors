1704084,3,B0000640T8,"I enjoyed this somewhat wooden performance and I think it can be recommended with the qualifications that other reviewers have already stated. But of course if one wants to hear a truly sublime performance of the title role, one has to settle for audio only and  hear Montserrat Caball. Nobody should miss her breakthrough Carnegie Hall performance in 1965 (pirate recording with wonderful sound on several labels). That's a really magical and  truly legendary performance. Her studio recording on RCA (with Kraus) is very complete and great as well. Unlike Sutherland, Caball in this role exhibits a real legato, an incredible control of all dynamics, pianissimi that were a wonder, a commitment with the words (with her they do mean something), a splendid coloratura (Sutherland's could be more spectacular, but not more meaningful), and a beauty of tone that is the stuff legends are made. I'm sure, in one hundred years, when very few people will remember Sutherland, many people will still play Caballe's recordings. Her contribution to the grand tradition of opera is truly unique. Along with Callas and Ponselle, the three supreme sopranos of the past century",1203292800,,1166,5.164021164021164
1704085,5,B0000640T8,"This is a spectacular 1980 performance from Covent Garden starring Sutherland and Kraus.  This is the glamorous way opera performances are supposed to be... with lavish costumes.  The purple number that Sutherland wears in the Prologue gets us off to a great start.  One hopes that the animal pelts in Act One are faux, but they certainly look sumptuous.  Her red gown and train for the final scene looks exactly like she's wearing the entire Covent Garden curtain!  The outfit Orsini (Anne Howells) sports in this final scene makes him look like he's trying to be Popeye's nemesis Bluto at a costume ball.  The wigs are also fabulous.  Kraus looks like he has a big ginger tabby curled up on his head.  He looks old and ridiculous, but the moment he opens his mouth and starts pouring out that gorgeous aristocratic sound, you realize he is demonstrating one of opera's most bizarre truisms:  the older the tenor, the more convincing he is as these Renaissance Italian teenboys in tights (Gennaro here, Romeo elsewhere).  This is one of the great Kraus performances, luckily captured on tape.  He gets to start the final act with an extra insert aria, and his acknowledgement of the audience ovation is so Old School that it should be shown in music academies as a lesson in subtlety and good taste when milking the audience for more applause.  Sutherland is in superb form: the trills, the high notes, the brilliant coloratura.  She was often criticized for not enunciating the text, but there are enough consonants for us to tell that she singing in Italian here.  And she doesn't just stand there and make pretty bel canto sounds; she is fiery and emotional and involved with the text and her co-stars.  The duet with Alfonso (Stafford Dean) is very dramatic, while the ensuing Poison Duet with Kraus is thrillingly fast and propulsive.  Donizetti certainly knew how to structure his numbers and manipulate his audience.  The cabaletta finale has the proper pathos, and the coda whips the audience up to a frenzy.  The audience is quite demonstrative (there's a flower shower at the final curtain), yet we are denied the view of any solo bows.  There are a few group bows and that's it.  One longs to know what the audience hysteria was like when Kraus and then Sutherland bowed solo.  The English subtitles are good, although one does wonder who allowed the possessive form ""her's"" to sneak through.",1195776000,,2404,4.814634146341463
1704086,2,B0000640T8,"I recently purchased this DVD, with high hopes.  A few years ago, I saw Sutherland's Lucrezia Borgia from Opera Australia, on VHS.  I assumed that the currently available DVD from the Covent Garden production would be an even better treat.  Boy, was I wrong- and disappointed!

It is painfully evident that there was scant rehearsal time for this particular staging of Lucrezia Borgia.  The chorus is wooden, stiff, and expressionless.  Even worse is the heavy reliance on the prompter for just about all of the singers.  Even the great Alfredo Kraus makes no attempt to disguise it.  At one point, he is singing onstage with the Maffio Orsini of this production, Anne Howells.  Both just stand there, staring intently, singing by rote.  It is an embarrassing, amateur moment made only worse by the close-up view that filmed productions afford.

In just about all respects, the Opera Australia version I remember outclasses Covent Garden's.  The one advantage the Royal Opera House has is a bigger budget.  Joan Sutherland is given better costumes (though I admit that her costume-and-mask ensemble is weird to look at).  Also, she is given an A-list tenor to sing with, Alfredo Kraus.  Unfortunately, by this point in Kraus' career, his voice had a somewhat dry quality to it.  There are moments of glory, but too often his waning vocal estate betrays him.  Still, he is an bel canto legend, and it's nice to see him paired with Sutherland.

Every other singer in the production deserves to be thrown to the lions.  Stafford Denan, as Alfonso d'Este, is howlingly awful.  His muffled, patchy, woolly singing isn't even worthy of a minor opera house, much less Covent Garden.  His extended duet with Joan makes you feel bad for the diva, who had to share the stage with such a dullard.

Anne Howells, as Maffio Orsini, is only a shade better.  Her voice has a covered quality, and her pitch is wayward.  I couldn't help but think of Margreta Elkins, who sang Maffio Orsini in the Opera Austalia prodction.  Elkins is in another class altogether.  She sang a wonderful drinking aria (Il Segreto Per Esser Felici).  In fact, she even interpolated a particularly florid cadenza, which brought the house down.  Howells, on the other hand, sings ""come scritto"", and barely eeks it out at that.

The complamari roles are badly sung, too.

So, is this DVD worth it?  Yes, if only for La Stupenda.  Thankfully, videotaped opera performances became standard by the time Joanie hit her late prime.  If you want to enjoy Sutherland on purely vocal terms, there are her studio recordings from the sixites and seventies.  However, though her voice (somewhat) changed by the early eighties, her acting became much improved.  My favorite moment in the whole DVD is when Joan sneers at Alfonso d'Este.  Acting ability aside, it is Joan's consummate professionalism and rock-solid bel canto technique that matter the most.  It's too bad that the polite British audience doesn't give the diva any extended applause.  Then again, had this been an Italian audience, the hissing and booing for the other singers, Kraus aside, would have been unbearable.

As a final point, I think that what weighs the production down even further is Richard Bonynge's conducting.  Perhaps due to lack of rehearsal time, the orchestra sounds downright pedestrian, with no vigor or excitement.",1175472000,,3354,4.962230215827338
1704087,4,B0000640T8,"Of course we listen to opera for the great singing, and Joan Sutherland has that, but the ""masked ball"" glasses she wore for most of the first act were really distracting.  She looked like a cartoon character.

Plus she's an incredibly huge person, and that thing she had on her head, something between a headress and a hat, I'm not even sure what to call it, made me go stand in the kitchen and just listen instead of watch.

Give me Anna Netrebko or Renee Fleming, who at least look like an ingenue, if you're going to produce made-for-the-screen operas.  When you get that fat, you need to stay in the studio.

I was disappointed I could't add this CD to my itunes library.  It only plays on the DVD player.",1174521600,,710,4.3816793893129775
1704088,5,B0000640T8,"This is the only record on dvd of this opera that i have found...and for me is enought...

Joan Shutherland is the best Diva in this roll and is memorable her performance.

The same for Alfredo Kraus.

BRAVO!",1170979200,,208,4.421052631578948
1704089,5,B0000640T8,"As Donizetti's admirer, I always thought that Lucia de Lammermoor and L'elisir d'Amore are the masterpieces of Donizetti' operas. But after watching Lucrezia Borgia, especially performed by Joan Sutherland and conducted by Richard Bonynge, I come to a different opinion. This opera is as beautiful and splendid as the other two above, only maybe not so frequently performed and wellknown. Especially as this opera is performed by such magnificent singers, Joan Sutherland in her prime years,and tenor Alfredo Krauss also in his prime years, who are singing and acting so beautifully to be a joy to listen as well as watched.

Joan Sutherland supported by Alfredo Krauss as her lost son, Gennaro, sung in such a way that they matched each others beautifully and harmoniously. It is especially seen in the scene of the meeting between Lucrezia as the unknown mother and Gennaro as the lost son, so sad and touching that tears come to your eyes. There is also, the rich voice of mezzo-soprano Anne Howells who sung as splendidly as Gennaro's friend, Maffio Orsini and the deep clear voice of bass barione Stafford Dean as the jealous husband Duke of Ferrara singing in his best. The choir sung to a full harmonious sound also add to the contribution of the magnificent performance. All in all, everything in this opera, from the beautiful and melodiously music, arias and choruses up to the peformance and background scenery itself gave such delightful and enjoyable satisfaction in watching this performance.

I recommend this opera for Donizetti lovers as one of my favourite performances.",1124668800,,1588,5.080459770114943
1704090,5,B0000640T8,"This was a wonderful movie, not enough Sutherland but they had a story to tell, it was not a ""star vehicle,"" the ending had me applauding in my living room, Sutherland was magnificent.  Everyone was good, Kraus and the men too but I'm partial to sopranos so they impressed me less, but were wonderful too.  The plot (except that Sutherland was Kraus' mother which you could have guessed the first moment ""mother unknown"" popped up!) made no sense to me at all.  The subtitles stunk and I doubt I'll EVER buy another Kulture (or is it Covent Garden's doing?) DVD for that reason alone.  I was bleeding to know what the hell they were saying to each other, but there just were no subtitles for 9/10ths of the opera.  The same was true of Kulture's ""Ballo"" with Domingo.  The music was spectacular.  Donizetti can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned, and he outdid himself this time.  He always does.  I noticed something about Donizetti watching this show, it's not his music that's slight or negligible (as some dunderheads have said), it's his plots.  Though this opera seemed to reek with subplots and skulduggery, it was basically a simplistic little story.  It's all in the music.  I recommend it 100% without reservations to anyone who likes coloratura singing.  Bel canto.  (Beautiful singing.)",1089072000,,1299,4.766816143497758
1704091,4,B0000640T8,"Of course both Kraus and Sutherland aren't in their youthful prime here but mature Sutherland delivers a Lucrezia that will haunt you with her magic and lovely mature sound. Lucrezia is a mature, colourful woman and Sutherland gives one of the best performances of her career on this DVD. Her darkened sound fits this role like a glove, of course Caballe sounds a little more involved and has a bigger middle but Joan created magic here. Her ""Come e bello"" is like cream and dark, delicious wine. Her high notes glitter like stars. Kraus might not look the young man but he sings Gennaro, one of his best roles, incredibly. The performance of a lifetime. For a young Lucrezia of our days listen to Renee Fleming who sang Lucrezia at La Scala.",1077926400,,742,4.628787878787879
1704092,5,B0000640T8,"It's and E Flat, not an E natural.  Sutherland was long past her high E's at this point.  This is a great performance and it was the favorite of Sutherland fans at Covent Garden.",1063843200,,178,4.205882352941177
1704103,5,B0000640T8,"Sutherland is generally consider the greatest Lucretia Borgia of our time. That is on the review on the DVD box set. She is stupendous, a wonder here. She is 53, but she sounds like she's 33 here. She was on that evening, it was a command performance. And the opera stage was covered with a carpet of flowers at the curtain calls that covers the floor completely. This live recording is a total triumph. And the digital recording is as clear as my Titanic DVD that's how good the video and audio is.
Caballe doesn't have a dvd of Borgia. And her coloratura in the final cabaletta is a mess. Caballe also never hit a note above the high C. There are E flats that Sutherland easily hits.
Also Caballe does not have the trill that this role has. Therefore she can't be compare to Sutherland in this fiendishly difficult role.",1059004800,,822,4.450331125827814
1704104,5,B0000640T8,"I agree with all the positive reviews of this rarely performed opera.

1704107,5,B0000640T8,"This is review of the Kultur Film DVD copy, catalogue #D2070 of 1980 Covent Garden Opera performance. What we can say about old generation operatic stars, like Dame Joan Sutherland (born in 1926) and Alfredo Kraus (born in 1927). Both are in excellent shape. Kraus is so fine that in Gennaro's aria in the beginning of II act usually omitted from performance of the opera (even do not presented in his RCA 1965 studio recording with Montserrat Caballe!) he received loud applause from usually reserved British audience. His sound is still very clear and intensive in higher register and fantastic in top Cs. The other principal singers are well too. Please, listen how effective is Anne Howells in Orsini's II act aria 'Il segreto per esser felici"". The profound deep bass of Stafford Dean (Alfonso) is very attractive. Beautiful design and costumes, excellent orchestra playing under the conduction of maestro Richard Bonynge. Fine staged and recorded, sound is clear with enough higher frequency. Only one complaint: there is unexpected persistent noise in the sound. Otherwise irremovable English subtitles do not bother you. By the way it is full version of the opera, as it is in 1974 DECCA studio recording. I suggest that this DVD-performance should be presented in all opera lovers library.",1028332800,,1298,5.098591549295775
7960377,3,B0000640T8,"Long patches of no subtitles.  This was enraging.  I had no idea what they were saying to each other half the time.  It was impossible to enjoy Sutherland or the music.  At one point I looked a scene up in a book of opera plots, and was surprised to learn what had just happened.

Gave up at last and quit watching.  Beautiful, but why put myself through that.  Kraus tells the Duke, ""I saved your father's life.""  Then lots and lots of singing but no subtitles.  Then the Duke says, ""You must follow my standard.""  They've got to be joking!",1508630400,,541,4.32
7960378,1,B0000640T8,What was she thinking? Sutherland is large but with these acres of fabric and enough hair for three or four show horses it's hard to imagine what was on her or all the cast's minds. The voices are well preserved past their primes or overparted I think. But the gigantic costumes really steal this morbid show. It is hard enough to take it seriously when you listen to a gorgeous recording like Caballe's but Dame Joan certainly does answer every opera queen's dream about just how wonderfully absurd and campy opera can be. If you don't laugh you are not awake.,1471824000,,561,4.564356435643564
7960379,5,B0000640T8,"I am biased as I adore Sutherland and Kraus ,almost whatever they do but in this lavish production at the Royal Opera House there were so many extra bonuses , the Royal Opera Choir and Orchestra at their best and Stafford Dean as Alfonso , the third husband  of Lucrezia that I think I could see this opera every week  Alfredo Kraus has the ability to pronounce every word so clearly , whether it is in spanish , italian or english that it is easy to see what influence he had on Juan Diego Florez.  And Dame Joan just needs an aria which is a little difficult for most singers to show how how great she is . Can not find a bad word to say about this production",1419465600,,661,4.108527131782946
7960380,5,B0000640T8,"This DVD met all of my expectations and then some more.  The sets and costumes were simply spectacular.

7960384,1,B0000640T8,"I do not know how anyone can rave about this DVD. The people who rated it low are correct. Sutherland is impressive given her age but does not really appeal to me. Everyone was reading the prompter and it looked like they had just met for the first time. The biggest sin about this DVD is only half is subtitled. If it is good enough to sing then subtitle it. Some arias did not have a single subtitle. At the end when Sutherland sings her last aria and drops before her dead son we don't know what happened. Did she have a nervous breakdown, did she faint, did she die of a broken heart, or did she take poison and die? I will have to read the libretto to find out.",1301788800,,666,4.091603053435114
7960385,3,B0000640T8,Video quality was poor. The DVD could not process the last part of the opera. The picture remained frozen. But singing was excellent. Joan Sutherland is exceptional.,1286668800,,165,5.148148148148148
7960386,2,B0000640T8,"Lucrezia Borgia, while not one of Donizetti's best operas with a rather dopey libretto, is well worth hearing but not in this poor production. The camera work is at best routine, and tends to reveal the weaknesses of the staging, the stolid nature of the acting, and the rather inappropriate casting from a visual point of view of the two female leads. The subtitles are farcically incomplete and there is no libretto or any other useful information. Yes, the singing is distinguished, and Anne Howells is a delight, but as a whole this is highly disappointing. Since this DVD is not worth watching, and Lucrezia Borgia is given a much better performance in the 1977 recording (still available on CD transfer) with Sutherland and Bonynge in better form than here and with Aragall, Horne and Wixell vocally at least as satisfying as Krause, Howells and Dean, only a very devoted Donizetti fan will want this DVD. I shall not be watching it again.",1218067200,,945,4.803680981595092
