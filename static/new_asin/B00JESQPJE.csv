8650367,2,B00JESQPJE,"Not the greatest collection of old TV pilots. Martin Milner in Starr of the Yankees is the best of the lot, even if it is very dated. Very good acting. The Nut House is enjoyable as well, with some very Laugh-in-esque turns. However it is hard to watch Arthur Lake in Meet the Family - he's a one character actor (Dagwood Bumstead) and is way too whiny to see on a regular basis. And Lines and Fines...ack. Not much of a game show but a half-hour commercial for Admiral Refrigerators. The only redeeming quality is the panel (with Mike Mazurki, Sid Melton, George Tobias and Gretchen Wyler), who look halfway embarrassed to be there.

Not really worth your money unless you are an ardent old TV fan or a researcher.",1472947200,,715,4.5
