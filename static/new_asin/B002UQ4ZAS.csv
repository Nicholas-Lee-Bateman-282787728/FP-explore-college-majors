8381448,5,B002UQ4ZAS,"I purchased this DVD to begin learning how to play jazz piano.  The chapters are sequenced to build up jazz theory and performance.  Each lesson is so easy to follow and the practice exercises and prints out from the DVD so complete, I'm able to understand how to learn jazz piano, which is different from traditional piano lessons which requires reading each note to be able to play.",1349395200,2,384,4.632352941176471
