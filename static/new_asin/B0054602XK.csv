4561057,5,B0054602XK,"This wonderful collection includes an almost pristine print of Mantrap starring the magnificent Clara Bow.  What a great movie!!  I can't overstate how much better this print of the 1926 Victor Fleming classic is than the other versions that were available before this release.  With this and the recent Blue Ray edition of Wings, one can begin to appreciate the subtle, timeless art of an American treasure, Clara Bow.",1330732800,12,419,5.043478260869565
4561058,5,B0054602XK,"The Treasures from American Film Archives series has been a real gift to anyone interested in the history of movies. Treasures, More Treasures, Avant-Garde and Social Issues volumes are now joined by a fascinating collection of early films of the West. They include the Clara Bow feature ""Mantrap,"" which shows why she was the sex symbol of her era; several films featuring the people involved reconstructing their roles (Oklahoma outlaw Al Jennings, Texas sheriff Buck, and the legendary Bill Tilghman with Chris Madsen and E.D. Nix, among others); comedies, travel shorts, and many other rare delights, some in color, are included.",1328140800,7,633,5.2772277227722775
4561059,5,B0054602XK,"What a wonderful set this is. These are films that are pure gems showing the early history of the American Western film. They have been restored so you end up with great quality films. I've read all the descriptions of the films and they help to understand the attitudes of that time in US history. Seeing as the films are short, you can watch just a few each day or have a Western movie marathon. I'm glad to see a few of the films came from my hometown Eastman House Archives.",1327708800,6,478,4.263736263736264
4561060,5,B0054602XK,"A compendium of historic films and footage all centered around the theme of the West of yore. Great images, super commentary; if you are a film buff you will love it. Like a coffee table book with moving images- Nice!",1322784000,10,217,4.45
4561061,5,B0054602XK,"Treasures 5:  The West 1898-1938 us a great set filled with many rarities and little seen films.  There are newsreels, travelogues, features, and shorts, all of which deal in some way with some of the American West.  With films made by Mack Sennett and D.W. Griffith and stars such as Mabel Normand and Clara Bow, there's a lot of solid entertainment here in addition to the historical and educational value of these films.  The National Film Preservation Foundation has created another must-buy collection.",1320969600,19,507,5.072289156626506
4561062,5,B0054602XK,"This is the fifth collection of rare, vintage movies from the National Film Preservation Foundation in their ongoing TREASURES series and it is one of their very best. If you are at all interested in not only the Western genre but the in the Old West itself, then you owe it to yourself to purchase this set. Not only does it aid in funding future film preservation but it gives you the opportunity to see some old friends and some genuine rarities. In the old friends category, if you're familiar with silent films, we have Clara Bow, Tom Mix, Richard Dix and Broncho Billy Anderson. A pristine print of Victor Fleming's MANTRAP (1926), the film Clara Bow made just before IT made her a superstar, shows the 21 year old off to good advantage as a Minneapolis manicurist who goes out West with one man and becomes involved with another. Then there's WOMANHANDLED (1925) with silent leading man Richard Dix where the title says it all. Other features with forgotten pre-Hollywood performers include THE LADY OF THE DUGOUT (1918), AMMUNITION SMUGGLING ON THE MEXICAN BORDER (1914), and SALOMY JANE also from 1914.

As good as the features are, the real treasures here are the short features that include BRONCHO BILLY AND THE SCHOOLMISTRESS (1912),  Biograph's THE TOURISTS (1912) with an 18 year old Mabel Normand, and Thomas Ince's astonishing 1914 pro-Native American drama LAST OF THE LINE (PRIDE OF RACE) with Sessue Hayakawa. In addition to these are recent discoveries from the New Zealand Film Archives, newsreels involving the changing face of the Old West, and the remarkable early color advertisement film SUNSHINE GATHERERS (1921) which showcases sunny California and Del Monte brand canned fruits. It's a history lesson (revisionist in some cases), a cinematic trip back in time to a vanished landscape, and an opportunity to see some well known silent performers early in their careers. As is always the case with the NFPF TREASURES series, the prints are top quality (though not always perfect) with excellent commentary available separately and suitable newly recorded background scores. To top it off there's a 110 page booklet chock full of fascinating details. A must for any film buff especially those of you interested in the history of cinema.",1317427200,51,2263,5.0

8456327,5,B0054602XK,"All the films restored here are of interest , but the prize of the whole dvd set was the great print of Clara Bow's ""Mantrap"". This print, found outside the U.S. is, as I know it, the best print found of this title. Let's hope more of Miss Bow's movies can be found and restored to Blu Ray. I'm still hoping they find her 1930 talkie ""Her Wedding Night"" and release it on Blu Ray. I think that would create great excitement among movie collectors.",1506211200,,447,4.270588235294118

8456330,5,B0054602XK,"These old, historical films, are very enlightening & can stand on their own as entertainment & as a silent film history of the growth of the American West, at a time when the Native Americans, our indigenous population was still regarded as just amusing ""savages"" whose lost & destroyed culture was obliverated by the invading European settlers. These old films are a real eye-opener for today's average schmuck, like me.  I wish I had had these to show some of my students, after teacing for the last 30 years!  What an awakening that would have been!!!  Saludos",1411257600,,563,4.783505154639175

8456334,5,B0054602XK,"Fantastic look at the early 1900's western United States and how it was depicted on film. Man Trapped with Clara Bow is a pristine print that shows the first real glimpse of how high this actress would rise in silent films. Womanhandled with Richard Dix is a great film, though not complete, you get the feel for what a gem this film was. Interesting look, in early color, of how the canned fruit industry was established in the west. Every entry in this offering is outstanding.",1371945600,2,479,4.5813953488372094
