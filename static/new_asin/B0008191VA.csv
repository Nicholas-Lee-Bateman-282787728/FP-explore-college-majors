Good storyline, character development, and action throughout the whole series. the story is about Brandon Heat, who plays a resurrected Bounty Hunter, who finds himself at odds with his former partner/ best friend whole becomes the new boss of Millenion, a mafia type syndicate. Each episode contributes to the whole. The music, the animation, and the story all work well. Both English and Japanese dubs are good.",1391990400,,534,4.8791208791208796
8055241,4,B0008191VA,"Gungrave is a good story about a couple of friends that move up from being street punks to the leaders of a powerful mafia organization. Brandon, the main character is murdered by his partner, Harry, and returns from the grave to take revenge and set things right again. That's pretty much the plot in a nutshell. There a lot of really awesome characters and fight scenes in this anime. There is also enough drama and character development to keep you wanting more.

The animation and voice acting are pretty good. You should recognize many of these voice actors. Overall this is a really good anime. Especially for one based on a video game. I recommend it to any anime fan.",1354147200,2,675,4.625
8055242,5,B0008191VA,"I won't try to explain how good this anime is. The sound is great, the voice acting in Japanese and English is first class, the story is well thought out and excellently executed, the animations are just the best to be had, and the characters are well developed over the course of the story.

You would never know that this got started from a little known game for the Playstation 2. It was so popular that an anime was made which expanded the story and it has become one of the top contenders in the genre.

If you like action anime, please, please, please take a look at this series.",1197590400,2,585,4.3090909090909095
