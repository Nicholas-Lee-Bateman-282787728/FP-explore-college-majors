There are short musical transitions between the seasons. There isn't a single person or spoken word in the whole movie. I loved that.

Really nice to play in the background as a sort of natural, live art. I have watched parts of it when falling asleep--very hypnotic.

The movie is vivid and clear, and gives the feeling of a whole year in nature. Someone did a VERY nice job making this movie!",1253577600,14,553,4.861702127659575
3921944,5,B002FKZ54O,"My family and I absolutely loved this movie! I'm sure that we will be watching it over and over again. This film does a great job of capturing the most beautiful places in the area. The music is very soothing and is nice to relax to after a long day at work. I would recommend it to anyone looking to relax, explore the beauty of the region, appreciate the beauty of nature in general, or even for meditation purposes. There are different options to chose from like playing the full feature, start to finish, playing only the relaxation scenes, etc. I really liked this because it gives me an option. This was a great family movie that really makes you appreciate the great outdoors!",1253577600,5,683,4.516129032258065

8369100,4,B002FKZ54O,"Would have given it five stars but scenes do change just a little too fast.  Otherwise, we all love it, we're kind of addicted to it.  Beats having the tv in the background with commercials blaring and people yelling at each other.",1396915200,,231,4.476190476190476
8369101,3,B002FKZ54O,"The pictures are pretty and the accompanying music is good.  However, the programing of the pictures did not suit me.  The video stays much too long on each picture.  It makes me feel like something is wrong because I am staring at the same picture for, what seems like, a very long time.  I noticed myself getting very sleepy, and I stopped watching the dvd.  It also made me feel tired.  It might be a good video if you wanted to have something playing on your tv for a long time while you went in and out of the room.",1378166400,,520,4.15
8369102,2,B002FKZ54O,"Extremely disappointed.  I was under the impression that this was 1080p natures scenes to the music of Vivaldi's Four Seasons.  Instead, it's just natures sounds and occasional new age music.

I doubt I will ever watch this...",1378166400,,226,5.054054054054054
8369103,3,B002FKZ54O,I was dissapointed with the way it stayed on one picture for a very long time. would have preferred more scenery changes,1372464000,,120,4.5
8369104,5,B002FKZ54O,"My wife and I lived in the Asheville area for about 3 years. We had to move back to Missouri to take care of elderly family. We loved the Blue Ridge Mountains and go back as often as we can. We have been to many of the areas filmed in this beautifully made video. We have been talking about selling photos and videos of North Carolina-we have had so much fun there. This awesome therapeutic ""Four Seasons-Peak Escape"" brings back so many memories. Great Job!!!!!  Get this DVD",1359590400,,476,4.409090909090909
8369105,5,B002FKZ54O,"This is a beautiful movie!!  Watching it causes me to feel relaxed and serene.  There are so many different amazing scenes, whoever shot them all did a fantastic job!  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the mountains.",1262995200,5,220,4.7368421052631575
8369106,5,B002FKZ54O,This is the most beautiful nature to make me relax ... watching the four seasons just makes me relax so well. You can watch something wile dreaming away. Love doing that. Totally recommend the Four Seasons title.,1254096000,5,212,4.756756756756757
