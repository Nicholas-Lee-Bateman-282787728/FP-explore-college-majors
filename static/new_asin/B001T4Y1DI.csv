The video is a little on the short side, but that's fine because you can explore all the paths and keep on going back for more! Also I want to see more of Jared Hoffa, he's like a young Marlin Brando. I expect him to do big things in the future.",1348704000,2,395,3.95
8340521,4,B001T4Y1DI,"Being a big fan of the mulipath, choose-your-own-adventure type of books and videos, I was excited to see that a new multipath movie was out.  The movie is only roughly 11 minutes long and has several life-or-death choices to make, but it is well-put-together.  My only problem with the movie is that it IS so short and has the feel of a class project, but I did enjoy it nonetheless.  I am glad that more people are making better use of dvd technology and making movies of this sort.",1273190400,2,484,4.415730337078652
