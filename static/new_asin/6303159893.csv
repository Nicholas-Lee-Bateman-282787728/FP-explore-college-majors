7840659,4,6303159893,"An extremely artsy, intriguing picture which was complicated enough to stimulate your intellect yet not so elaborate as to leave you out in the cold if you were a little tired. Action, romance, plot and good acting (Grounds enough to have it banned from MTV), I thought it was a great movie; I love independent films that are actually well make like this one, and that keep a smaller, more human feel to them. You are missing a lot if you miss this one.",987465600,7,453,4.404761904761905
7840660,4,6303159893,Very good sci-fi storyline and a believable romance.  I saw the orginal version on televsion and will add the video version to my collection.  I enjoyed the characters (some predictable) but otherwise a video worth  watching and buying.,953942400,4,236,5.157894736842105
