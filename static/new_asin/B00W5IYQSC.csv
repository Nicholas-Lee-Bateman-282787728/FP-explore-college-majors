7120250,4,B00W5IYQSC,"The biography on the Kliq is rather short but I thought it surprising since they mentioned about how difficult it was to work with them back in the day & Undertaker's group as well. That's why I call it WWE version because while it was nice to show honesty about people hating the group, I'm sure other wrestlers (the late, great Bam Bam Bigelow) have a few choice words about the group. I was surprised to see Douglas on the set-probably needed a paycheck because in the past he's had a few more colorful words about the group & especially his short run in 95. Another reason why I saw WWE version is if you're a wrestling fan & watch shoot interviews then you know most of these guys are annoying & more arrogant plus they swear left & right. Despite being a WWE release, it's still a good look at the group. The matches are half & half, most of them can be seen on other sets but some good unreleased gems. I grew up liking Diesel, Razor, & HBK so I enjoyed this set & recommend it to fans.",1438128000,3,993,4.204188481675392
7120251,4,B00W5IYQSC,"The documentary part was only about an hour long with a good amount of new footage but still some canned interviews that have appeared on other DVDs. It's a good pickup for any collector or anyone like myself wanting to see more about the Kliq but if you're looking for a very in-depth, expansive look at them, this is not the DVD.",1438041600,,331,4.354838709677419
7120252,4,B00W5IYQSC,"This is a truly fantastic and it would be worth grabbing just for the Action Zone match alone (I was PRAYING this would be on here!).  However there are two matches that I wish would have been replaced.

HBK vs Razor Ladder Match WM 10  - Now don't get me wrong this is a 5 star classic, however it has appeared MANY times before on other sets including a few HBK ones.  I would have preferred if they put the Ladder Match from Summer Slam 95 on, since no HBK DVD actually has that match on it yet and it is an underrated classic

HBK vs Diesel  Good Friends Better Enemies  - again we have seen this on DVD sets before.  I would have replaced this with the match HBK and Diesel had against Yoko and Bulldog, when Two Dudes won the titles.

Other matches that could have been on here

HBK vs Razor  Aug 1 1994  really solid match

Triple H vs HBK from Taboo Tuesday 2004  HBK just gives an unreal performance here

Triple H vs HBK from Royal Rumble  2004  just an underrated match all around and I believe these two are the only two Triple H vs HBK matches no on either of their DVD's  (save the two Beniot triple threats)

DX vs Orton and Edge from News Years Res 07

But really I a just nit picking cause this is a great set, worthy to add to you collection if you like any or all of these guys.",1437955200,,1297,4.051383399209486
7120253,5,B00W5IYQSC,"I have not seen the documentary portion of this set, but the match listing is worth the price alone.  I've waited for this Action Zone match to be released for quite some time.  If you're a fan of the Kliq, I'd say this is a must have.

7120254,2,B00W5IYQSC,"I saw this movie at the premiere last night at the orlando center for civilian artists, and i was amazed at the lack of story. they talked for like 5000 hours about how hard it is to stop drinking. then there was this section of time where they all did yoga or something. then they played this movie for a packed house. there was about 45 people in there, which is amazing given the venues bench policy. they only allow you to bring benches. it has something to do with wanted to preserve the founders original idea which was to always be in the woods, and only use what you have from mother nature to survive. so any way, they play the move, and at the end, they don't even acknowledge jake roberts for starting the whole, drugs are cool thing and how he liked to drink apple cider vinegar. so all in all, this was a great show. when it comes out you'll see a lot of new ideas put forth from the genius minds at WCW.

7120269,5,B00W5IYQSC,"Of all the well-known wrestling factions that have ever graced the squared circle, there is perhaps no one entity of this kind that has been so remembered than that of a group of guys called the KLIQ. Now, here on this 3-disc DVD set, the five original members reunite and share their memories about what it was like to be at the center of the wrestling universe. The Bad Guy, Razor Ramon. The Game, Triple H. Big Daddy Cool, Diesel. The 1-2-3 Kid, X-Pac. The Heartbreak Kid, Shawn Michaels. Get an inside look at what it was like to be part of this most elite and eclectic entourage. There is a fascinating documentary that chronicles their legacy from the early 90s, right through to 2015. There is also a stellar selection of in-ring action that spans between the years of 1993 to 2009. Also included is the infamous Madison Square Garden ""Curtain Call"" from 1996. Even after the members seperated, they still dominated the wrestling world. Shawn Michaels and Triple H went on to form Degeration-X in the WWE, while Scott Hall and Kevin Nash became the nWo in WCW. Sean Waltman was fortunate enough to become a part of both group's at various times throughout his career. Even more remarkable is that Shawn Michaels, Scott Hall and Kevin Nash have all been inducted into  the prestigious WWE Hall Of Fame. Now, the band is back together And they look better than ever.",1439769600,2,1371,4.6419753086419755
7120270,5,B00W5IYQSC,"matches on the dvd were great, interviews were ones I haven't seen before. Very good buy for any fan of the 90s era!",1438992000,3,116,4.086956521739131
7120271,4,B00W5IYQSC,"Shawn Michaels, Triple H, Sean Waltman, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall were at one time a very controversial group behind the scenes who were all about one things which was dominating the wrestling business like never before to the point where they didn't just dominate WWE but also WCW at the same time as they weren't just a faction created on television but a group of friends known as ""The Kliq."" You hear the story of their positive & negative influence in the wrestling business throughout the presentation hearing from the members themselves along with other personalities such as Lex Luger, Vince McMahon, Sunny, Vince Russo, Billy Gunn, Bret Hart, Sgt. Slaughter, Shane Douglas, Justin Credible, Godfather, Jim Ross, J.B.L., Rikishi, Undertaker, Eric Bischoff, Ted Dibiase, Diamond Dallas Page, Hulk Hogan, Dean Malenko, Sting, Chris Jericho, Rick Steiner, and Jason Comidies & Mani Mohtrio who taped the infamous ""Curtain Call"" while also looking at the entire group's reunion in WWE after almost 20 years backstage at the Hall Of Fame ceremonies & WrestleMania weekends.

Normally I save my summary towards the end but I'll give it now in that this was a different type of presentation than we usually get from WWE in that this wasn't a ""career retrospective"" more than a detailed look at the group itself with the fact that you didn't see a heavily amount of bias towards the group as they kept it honest with members openly admitting they did things on purpose to stur up trouble along & had attitude problems amongst other issues making them difficult to work with while others were brutally honest with their negative opinions towards them. The match selection is a mixed bag as we got rarer matches from television such as RAW during the ""New Generation"" era (which we don't get a lot of) involving the group instead of the usual PPV matches that was been more available on other DVD sets over the years & currently on their network but the negative is that some of those matches are easily forgettable or been reused on DVD sets so many times instead of giving a better alternative that still got the point across (the WrestleMania X ladder match on another DVD set when the SummerSlam rematch is still unused for almost a decade). In the end, the positives outweigh the negatives so this is a set I would recommend for anyone who's a fan of any of these superstars or this era of wrestling.

The documentary begins with the story of how the group came together throughout the years along with explanations of where elements such as their name & infamous hand symbol came from before going into how they were behind the scenes as far as the antics they did that rubbed the talent the wrong way along with talk about another backstage clique that was around at the time followed by discussion of their relationship with Vince McMahon & if that was truly ""best for business"" for the company or themselves. One of the biggest discussions took place next in the infamous ""Curtain Call"" at Madison Square Garden as far as how it all came together but didn't go originally as planned along with how it was a huge issue with the ""traditionalist"" in the company before going into members of the Kliq heading to WCW as far as how that effected both products on screen & behind the scenes with such phrases around the WCW talent as ""Well in New York..."" and how they still showcased their friendship to each other across television along with going into the personal issues members of the Kliq were going through at that time causing one member to comment on how he thought at times someone was going to die. The return to WWE of Hall & Nash and eventually Shawn Michaels was discussed next as far as why these reunions didn't last long and how each member evolved over the years to where they became members of the Hall Of Fame & finally had a reunion together after all these years.

Matches Include:
The Kid vs. Razor Ramon - All I can say is don't take a bathroom break here as you'll miss what is still considered to be one of the biggest upsets in not just RAW but probably WRESTLING history here.
""RAW"" May '93
[Best Of RAW: 15th Anniversary; RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

1-2-3 Kid vs. Razor Ramon - Razor had a sack of $10,000 he put up in order to get this rematch as the Kid used his superior speed to his advantage with various kids while Razor used his power & size tossing Kid around along with trying to embarrass him when possible while Kid continued to take high risk that didn't always pay off as this ultimately came down to not who was the better wrestler but who was able to outsmart his opponent.
""RAW"" June '93

Razor Ramon vs. Diesel - Diesel was easily overpowering Razor shoving him around & down to the mat while heavily focusing on a specific part of his body causing Razor to resort to taking Diesel off his feet including coming off the ropes to knock him down in what was a short but solid encounter.
""RAW"" Nov. '93
[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

1-2-3 Kid vs. Shawn Michaels - 1-2-3 Kid vs. Shawn Michaels - As a result of the interference the previous week, these two faced off against each the week after. The Kid showed superior quickness against Shawn early before Shawn finally caught the Kid with a back suplex from an attempted headlock & even took a page out of Kid's playbook with a flying head scissors on Kid to the outside & later catching the Kid in mid-air with a dropkick. Shawn slowed the pace down & worked over Kid's back with various backbreakers & hard irish whips in the turnbuckles. Both men were so evenly matched that both men were exhausted after a while. Shawn was able to gain the advantage & delivered a Razor's Edge to Kid before making it clear he wanted to punish Kid instead of beating him by doing another Razor's Edge causing Razor Ramon to come out & save the Kid from it being done a third time. This caused the brawl to the back between Shawn & Razor that saw Diesel get involved leading to Shawn giving Razor his own Razor's Edge two times on the floor.
""RAW"" Dec. '93
[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

Razor Ramon & 1-2-3 Kid vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Quebecers - Kid walked into this match with a previously hurt leg that the Quebecers tried to go for early to no avail before Johnny Polo got involved & took a Razor's Edge on the outside for his troubles. Razor & Kid were in control for most of this match before Diesel made an appearance that had the advantage switch back to the Quebecers who were able to focus on Kid's leg building to the hot tag to Razor before Shawn Michaels once again let his presence felt.
""RAW"" Feb. '94
[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

Ladder Match: Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Shawn Michaels - This was the first ladder match to be seen on WWE television. Both men started off wrestling early before Diesel got involved & ended up paying for it before Razor removed the outside mat & exposed the concrete that didn't end up working in his favor. The ladder came into play from here as Shawn started to use it as a weapon to attack Razor's ribs starting with a baseball slide into the ladder right into Razor's ribs & later doing a big splash off the top of it while later Razor used it to his advantage by whipping Shawn into it & using it squish Shawn into the ring post. There were times when both men launched an attack while one was on the ladder much as Razor slamming Shawn off of it & him ""making an ass"" of Shawn to prevent him from winning the match. This ladder match was the one that set the standard for what WWE would do this match for years to come as it was definitely a match where both men came out stronger than they went in with Jerry Lawler to the point said about one competitor, ""He Is Superman!""
WrestleMania X
[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; History Of Intercontinental Championship; Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn; Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden; True Story Of WrestleMania; Shawn Michaels: Mr. WrestleMania]

Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Diesel - This match happened a little while after the classic ladder match between Shawn Michaels & Razor Ramon at WrestleMania as it was time for Shawn's bodyguard, Diesel, to attempt to gain the Intercontinental Championship. Razor came out very aggressive while Diesel used his power & size to his advantage. There were times where Razor was able to counteract Diesel's size like a top rope bulldog but in the end, numbers amongst other things caught up to Razor as Diesel would go on to win his first championship. This was more of a teaser for their upcoming SummerSlam match than anything else but a very good match for the ""Superstars"" show at that time.
""Superstars"" Apr. '94
[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's; True Giants]

WWE Tag Team Champions Shawn Michaels & Diesel vs. Razor Ramon & 1-2-3 Kid - Diesel & Shawn attacked from behind only for Razor & Kid to use their momentum against them to get the advantage including a Razor's Edge in the opening minute before Shawn & Diesel recovered utilizing the strategy of singling out one opponent for an extended period grounding him & using illegal tactics such as double teaming only for it to heavily backfire causing their opponents to use their same strategy against them in what was a highly competitive match.
""Action Zone"" Oct. '94

Elimination Match - The Bad Guys vs. The Teamsters: Razor Ramon, 1-2-3 Kid, British Bulldog, Headshrinkers vs. Diesel, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart - This was a good opener as it was well paced with various storylines being put over such as Headshrinker Fatu having trouble adjusting to being ""americanized"" by wearing wrestling boots. The major storyline here was Diesel dominating & eliminating every member until Shawn Michaels (who was never tagged in the match) accidentally kicked him in the face (for the third time since SummerSlam) and Diesel going after Shawn with his whole team being counted out in the process. The ending was weak with Razor Ramon winning his match the same way Flair won his 3 years earlier but the bigger story was this was the HBK/Diesel story that would lead to the WM11 main event.
Survivor Series '94

Razor Ramon vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - Razor was able to get the early advantage only for Hunter to get the advantage using Razor's momentum against him followed by heavily focusing on a specific part of the body with Razor not only having to deal with Hunter staying a step ahead but also another distraction in a solid but short encounter.
""RAW"" Jan. '96

Cry Baby Match: Razor Ramon vs. 1-2-3 Kid - This was a first (and only) in WWE history where the loser of the match would actually be forced to be put in a diaper with both men trying to intimidate each other only for Razor to take the fight right to Kid using his size advantage to toss him around & knock him down only for Kid to retaliate using some aerial offense & various kicks along with resorting to dirty tactics that didn't always work in his favor.
""In Your House"" Feb. '96

No Holds Barred Match: WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel - The buildup to this match was very unusual & different than what we've seen in WWE pre-Attitude Era as far as Diesel having a ""shoot"" persona where he openly acknowledged Vince McMahon as the owner instead of just the color commentator while threatening to come for him after the match based off his frustration of changing him into a ""corporate puppet"" while champion while Shawn was out for revenge for Diesel turning his back on him & attacking him with a chair. HBK took the fight to Diesel right away showing his athleticism with a top rope moonsault to the outside while also showing he can get dirty too using a boot from the spanish announcer before Diesel took advantage of the match stipulation taking out anyone he felt got in his way & using weapons like a belt & chair while delivering to low blow before sending Shawn through the announce table that even Vince at ringside felt was going too far but both men continued to just use whatever they could get their hands on from a fire extinguisher, a chair, and something from wrestling legend Mad Dog Vachon at ringside that you have to see to believe. I said this earlier in that this match was pre-Attitude Era & ECW was still not known to a national audience so it was rare to see this type of match using the weapons & punishment they gave each other during this time so this match was definitely a classic for it's time & still stands the test of time to this day.
""In Your House: Good Friends, Better Enemies"" Apr. '96
[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; OMG: Top 50 Incidents In WWE History]

Shawn Michaels vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - This was a non-title match as Hunter was able to keep staying one step ahead early taking Shawn down to the mat repeatedly only for Shawn to gain some offense along showing off & having fun at Hunter's expense as they traded momentum with both men having counters & reversal to each other's offense along with Hunter using Shawn's momentum against him & keeping him grounded constantly cutting off any attempt at momentum in what was their first televised encounter.
""RAW"" May '96

Outsiders vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers - It should be noted that Hall & Nash came to ringside with not only their own set of tag team titles but Hollywood Hogan in their corner as both teams were evenly matched trading momentum throughout the match relying double team offense & showcasing power with Outsiders resorting to taking shortcuts while the Steiners took advantage of Hall & Nash showcasing not always being on the same only for issues between other members of the nWo effecting the match but in a way that left more questions than answers as this was a solid encounter but more about the issues going on in the nWo around this time.
""WCW Nitro"" Jan. '98

Kevin Nash vs. Scott Hall - This was nicknamed ""The Battle Of The Outsiders"" as at this time, the nWo was split into two different factions with Kevin Nash being the leader of the red & black ""Wolfpac"" while Scott Hall was a member of the black & white ""Hollywood"" version after turning on Nash back in May. Also during this time, WCW decided to make a storyline out of Hall's personal demons by having him come to the ring highly drunk & being in no condition to wrestle. This wasn't close to their memorable wrestling match back at SummerSlam '94 as this was more of a personal fight with Hall cheating early by blinding Nash & even having him bleed from his lip before Nash recovered and just tried to ""beat some sense into Hall"" until he had nothing else left to prove.
WCW Halloween Havoc '98
[Legends Of Wrestling: Heatseekers]

X-Pac vs. Triple H - X-Pac was looking for revenge for Triple H & Chyna turning on him at WrestleMania as both men came out fighting trading fist & bouncing each other's heads off objects on the outside of the ring as X-Pac used his speed & various kicks to his advantage while Triple H attempted to ground X-Pac heavily working over the neck using not just wrestling but whatever shortcuts he could as this was an aggressive match that couldn't be contained between just the two participants.
Backlash '99

Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, X-Pac vs. Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Kane - This was the final attempt by Hogan & Rock to get revenge on the nWo before the brand extension would place them on different shows as Hogan & Rock & Kane were dominating each individual causing the nWo to resort to a numbers games & other tactics to move the momentum in their favor in what was a fun back & forth match.
""SmackDown"" Mar. '02

World Champion Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Shawn Michaels & Ric Flair were the managers for each individual only for a four way brawl to start in the isleway before the match got started causing them to be sent to the back as Nash was dominate causing Triple H to resort to desperate tactics to just get away from Nash as both men weren't focused on just winning the match causing the referee to be physically involved on more than one occasion until one man just went too far causing his opponent to retaliate with anyone getting in his way, including his own manager, paying the price.
Judgment Day '03

T.L.C. Match: D-Generation X vs. Unified Tag Team Champions JeriShow - DX was out to gain their first set of tag team championship (although technically the New Age Outlaws were tag team champions as members of DX a decade ago). This started out as you would expect with an all-out brawl on the from the ring to the floor all the way to the arm with dueling chair being used. This match had it's various moments with Big Show actually being the M.V.P. of the match like how Triple H was sprawled across a ladder in the corner only for HBK to the thrown against him & be squished by Show, Big Show punched through a chair into Triple H's face, the power of Show destroying more than one ladder with his bare hands, and the comedic ending with Jericho & Show working together to grab the belts only for that to backfire in a nasty way for Jericho as he took the worst fall than anyone else the entire night. If your expecting the heavy ""spotfest"" that you've gotten from TLC/Ladder matches in the past that you won't get it here but this was still a good contest with plenty of moments to not leave you disappointed.
T.L.C.: Tables. Ladders & Chairs '09
[Blu-Ray Edition Of Greatest PPV Matches 2009-2010; DX: One Last Stand]

(Blu-Ray) Scott Hall & Syxx vs. Harlem Heat - Harlem Heat was looking for revenge for the nWo's (specifically Vincent) interference in their recent matches while this was their first match without Sister Sherri in their corner & Nash was in a wheelchair at ringside due to his recent ""injury"" as the Heat came out very aggressive being dominate with their offense of power & athleticism stopping any momentum attempted by Hall & Syxx to the point where Nash came out his chair only to sit back down because of the pain as it came down to which team that was able to take advantage of an opening to be the victors.
""WCW Nitro"" July '97

(Blu-Ray) Kevin Nash vs. The Rock - Nash took the advantage early by overpowering Rock & using his momentum against him while Scott Hall was on the outside making his presence known whenever possible only for Rock to eventually made his comeback before it was revealed the true intentions of Hall & Nash that caused Hulk Hogan to appear to even the odds in what was a short match with the purpose being the reveal of the newest (or returning) member of the New World Order.
""SmackDown"" Mar. '02

(Blu-Ray) Sledgehammer Ladder Match: Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Both men started trading fist & brawling from the start before the ladders came into play with Nash taking the first shot ramming the ladder into HHH's neck on the outside before he retaliated with a clothesline off the announce table & knocked Nash over the barricade. Back in the ring, Triple H worked over Nash's knees by using the ladder on his knees constantly including applying a figure four with Nash's knees trapped in a ladder. Nash was able to come back & use the ladder as a weapon including irish whipping Triple H hard into the ladder in the corner & also executing his ""vintage"" sideslam into the ladder before the fight went to the floor with Nash attempting to powerbomb Triple H through the announce table only for Triple H to counter with a backdrop onto the table. With additional weapons being brought into the match such as the sledgehammer & a table, this wasn't your typical ladder match as it was more like a ""No Disqualification"" fight with them using ladders instead of chairs & other weapons but this was the best route to go since we know both Triple H & Kevin Nash can't give us the type of match that measures up to the standards set for a ladder match at this point in their careers.
T.L.C.: Tables, Ladders & Chairs '11

(Blu-Ray) Triple H vs. Sting - Both men had unique entrances (which I marked out for being a huge fan of the ""Terminator"" series) while it should be noted that this match could only be won by pinfall or submission. Both men started out having the same idea as far as attempts to take down their opponent before one man was able to get the advantage constantly stopping opponent dead from getting offense before finally being able to take advantage of a mistiming working him over in & outside of the ring before the match evolved into what Michael Cole described as ""The 'Monday Night Wars' have come to WrestleMania"" as you saw guest appearances from the two biggest factions in wrestling during that era along with a battle of ""sledgehammer vs. baseball bat"" in what told a good story as far as being the final battle of WWE vs. WCW and was entertaining for what it was.

Other extras include the amateur video footage of the ""curtain call"" in May of 1996 shown unedited for the first time ever.

In the end, the positives outweigh the negatives so this is a set I would recommend for anyone who's a fan of any of these superstars or this era of wrestling.

The documentary begins with the story of how the group came together throughout the years along with explanations of where elements such as their name & infamous hand symbol came from before going into how they were behind the scenes as far as the antics they did that rubbed the talent the wrong way along with talk about another backstage clique that was around at the time followed by discussion of their relationship with Vince McMahon & if that was truly ""best for business"" for the company or themselves. One of the biggest discussions took place next in the infamous ""Curtain Call"" at Madison Square Garden as far as how it all came together but didn't go originally as planned along with how it was a huge issue with the ""traditionalist"" in the company before going into members of the Kliq heading to WCW as far as how that effected both products on screen & behind the scenes with such phrases around the WCW talent as ""Well in New York..."" and how they still showcased their friendship to each other across television along with going into the personal issues members of the Kliq were going through at that time causing one member to comment on how he thought at times someone was going to die. The return to WWE of Hall & Nash and eventually Shawn Michaels was discussed next as far as why these reunions didn't last long and how each member evolved over the years to where they became members of the Hall Of Fame & finally had a reunion together after all these years.

Matches Include:
The Kid vs. Razor Ramon - All I can say is don't take a bathroom break here as you'll miss what is still considered to be one of the biggest upsets in not just RAW but probably WRESTLING history here.
""RAW"" May '93
[Best Of RAW: 15th Anniversary; RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

1-2-3 Kid vs. Razor Ramon - Razor had a sack of $10,000 he put up in order to get this rematch as the Kid used his superior speed to his advantage with various kids while Razor used his power & size tossing Kid around along with trying to embarrass him when possible while Kid continued to take high risk that didn't always pay off as this ultimately came down to not who was the better wrestler but who was able to outsmart his opponent.
""RAW"" June '93

Razor Ramon vs. Diesel - Diesel was easily overpowering Razor shoving him around & down to the mat while heavily focusing on a specific part of his body causing Razor to resort to taking Diesel off his feet including coming off the ropes to knock him down in what was a short but solid encounter.
""RAW"" Nov. '93
[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

1-2-3 Kid vs. Shawn Michaels - 1-2-3 Kid vs. Shawn Michaels - As a result of the interference the previous week, these two faced off against each the week after. The Kid showed superior quickness against Shawn early before Shawn finally caught the Kid with a back suplex from an attempted headlock & even took a page out of Kid's playbook with a flying head scissors on Kid to the outside & later catching the Kid in mid-air with a dropkick. Shawn slowed the pace down & worked over Kid's back with various backbreakers & hard irish whips in the turnbuckles. Both men were so evenly matched that both men were exhausted after a while. Shawn was able to gain the advantage & delivered a Razor's Edge to Kid before making it clear he wanted to punish Kid instead of beating him by doing another Razor's Edge causing Razor Ramon to come out & save the Kid from it being done a third time. This caused the brawl to the back between Shawn & Razor that saw Diesel get involved leading to Shawn giving Razor his own Razor's Edge two times on the floor.
""RAW"" Dec. '93
[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

Razor Ramon & 1-2-3 Kid vs. WWE Tag Team Champions Quebecers - Kid walked into this match with a previously hurt leg that the Quebecers tried to go for early to no avail before Johnny Polo got involved & took a Razor's Edge on the outside for his troubles. Razor & Kid were in control for most of this match before Diesel made an appearance that had the advantage switch back to the Quebecers who were able to focus on Kid's leg building to the hot tag to Razor before Shawn Michaels once again let his presence felt.
""RAW"" Feb. '94
[RAW ""The Beginning"": Best Of Seasons 1 & 2]

Ladder Match: Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Shawn Michaels - This was the first ladder match to be seen on WWE television. Both men started off wrestling early before Diesel got involved & ended up paying for it before Razor removed the outside mat & exposed the concrete that didn't end up working in his favor. The ladder came into play from here as Shawn started to use it as a weapon to attack Razor's ribs starting with a baseball slide into the ladder right into Razor's ribs & later doing a big splash off the top of it while later Razor used it to his advantage by whipping Shawn into it & using it squish Shawn into the ring post. There were times when both men launched an attack while one was on the ladder much as Razor slamming Shawn off of it & him ""making an ass"" of Shawn to prevent him from winning the match. This ladder match was the one that set the standard for what WWE would do this match for years to come as it was definitely a match where both men came out stronger than they went in with Jerry Lawler to the point said about one competitor, ""He Is Superman!""
WrestleMania X
[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; History Of Intercontinental Championship; Ladder Match 2: Crash & Burn; Best Of WWE At Madison Square Garden; True Story Of WrestleMania; Shawn Michaels: Mr. WrestleMania]

Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon vs. Diesel - This match happened a little while after the classic ladder match between Shawn Michaels & Razor Ramon at WrestleMania as it was time for Shawn's bodyguard, Diesel, to attempt to gain the Intercontinental Championship. Razor came out very aggressive while Diesel used his power & size to his advantage. There were times where Razor was able to counteract Diesel's size like a top rope bulldog but in the end, numbers amongst other things caught up to Razor as Diesel would go on to win his first championship. This was more of a teaser for their upcoming SummerSlam match than anything else but a very good match for the ""Superstars"" show at that time.
""Superstars"" Apr. '94
[Greatest Wrestling Stars Of The 90's; True Giants]

WWE Tag Team Champions Shawn Michaels & Diesel vs. Razor Ramon & 1-2-3 Kid - Diesel & Shawn attacked from behind only for Razor & Kid to use their momentum against them to get the advantage including a Razor's Edge in the opening minute before Shawn & Diesel recovered utilizing the strategy of singling out one opponent for an extended period grounding him & using illegal tactics such as double teaming only for it to heavily backfire causing their opponents to use their same strategy against them in what was a highly competitive match.
""Action Zone"" Oct. '94

Elimination Match - The Bad Guys vs. The Teamsters: Razor Ramon, 1-2-3 Kid, British Bulldog, Headshrinkers vs. Diesel, Shawn Michaels, Jeff Jarrett, Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart - This was a good opener as it was well paced with various storylines being put over such as Headshrinker Fatu having trouble adjusting to being ""americanized"" by wearing wrestling boots. The major storyline here was Diesel dominating & eliminating every member until Shawn Michaels (who was never tagged in the match) accidentally kicked him in the face (for the third time since SummerSlam) and Diesel going after Shawn with his whole team being counted out in the process. The ending was weak with Razor Ramon winning his match the same way Flair won his 3 years earlier but the bigger story was this was the HBK/Diesel story that would lead to the WM11 main event.
Survivor Series '94

Razor Ramon vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - Razor was able to get the early advantage only for Hunter to get the advantage using Razor's momentum against him followed by heavily focusing on a specific part of the body with Razor not only having to deal with Hunter staying a step ahead but also another distraction in a solid but short encounter.
""RAW"" Jan. '96

Cry Baby Match: Razor Ramon vs. 1-2-3 Kid - This was a first (and only) in WWE history where the loser of the match would actually be forced to be put in a diaper with both men trying to intimidate each other only for Razor to take the fight right to Kid using his size advantage to toss him around & knock him down only for Kid to retaliate using some aerial offense & various kicks along with resorting to dirty tactics that didn't always work in his favor.
""In Your House"" Feb. '96

No Holds Barred Match: WWE Champion Shawn Michaels vs. Diesel - The buildup to this match was very unusual & different than what we've seen in WWE pre-Attitude Era as far as Diesel having a ""shoot"" persona where he openly acknowledged Vince McMahon as the owner instead of just the color commentator while threatening to come for him after the match based off his frustration of changing him into a ""corporate puppet"" while champion while Shawn was out for revenge for Diesel turning his back on him & attacking him with a chair. HBK took the fight to Diesel right away showing his athleticism with a top rope moonsault to the outside while also showing he can get dirty too using a boot from the spanish announcer before Diesel took advantage of the match stipulation taking out anyone he felt got in his way & using weapons like a belt & chair while delivering to low blow before sending Shawn through the announce table that even Vince at ringside felt was going too far but both men continued to just use whatever they could get their hands on from a fire extinguisher, a chair, and something from wrestling legend Mad Dog Vachon at ringside that you have to see to believe. I said this earlier in that this match was pre-Attitude Era & ECW was still not known to a national audience so it was rare to see this type of match using the weapons & punishment they gave each other during this time so this match was definitely a classic for it's time & still stands the test of time to this day.
""In Your House: Good Friends, Better Enemies"" Apr. '96
[From The Vault: Shawn Michaels; OMG: Top 50 Incidents In WWE History]

Shawn Michaels vs. Hunter Hearst-Helmsley - This was a non-title match as Hunter was able to keep staying one step ahead early taking Shawn down to the mat repeatedly only for Shawn to gain some offense along showing off & having fun at Hunter's expense as they traded momentum with both men having counters & reversal to each other's offense along with Hunter using Shawn's momentum against him & keeping him grounded constantly cutting off any attempt at momentum in what was their first televised encounter.
""RAW"" May '96

Outsiders vs. WCW Tag Team Champions Steiner Brothers - It should be noted that Hall & Nash came to ringside with not only their own set of tag team titles but Hollywood Hogan in their corner as both teams were evenly matched trading momentum throughout the match relying double team offense & showcasing power with Outsiders resorting to taking shortcuts while the Steiners took advantage of Hall & Nash showcasing not always being on the same only for issues between other members of the nWo effecting the match but in a way that left more questions than answers as this was a solid encounter but more about the issues going on in the nWo around this time.
""WCW Nitro"" Jan. '98

Kevin Nash vs. Scott Hall - This was nicknamed ""The Battle Of The Outsiders"" as at this time, the nWo was split into two different factions with Kevin Nash being the leader of the red & black ""Wolfpac"" while Scott Hall was a member of the black & white ""Hollywood"" version after turning on Nash back in May. Also during this time, WCW decided to make a storyline out of Hall's personal demons by having him come to the ring highly drunk & being in no condition to wrestle. This wasn't close to their memorable wrestling match back at SummerSlam '94 as this was more of a personal fight with Hall cheating early by blinding Nash & even having him bleed from his lip before Nash recovered and just tried to ""beat some sense into Hall"" until he had nothing else left to prove.
WCW Halloween Havoc '98
[Legends Of Wrestling: Heatseekers]

X-Pac vs. Triple H - X-Pac was looking for revenge for Triple H & Chyna turning on him at WrestleMania as both men came out fighting trading fist & bouncing each other's heads off objects on the outside of the ring as X-Pac used his speed & various kicks to his advantage while Triple H attempted to ground X-Pac heavily working over the neck using not just wrestling but whatever shortcuts he could as this was an aggressive match that couldn't be contained between just the two participants.
Backlash '99

Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, X-Pac vs. Hulk Hogan, The Rock, Kane - This was the final attempt by Hogan & Rock to get revenge on the nWo before the brand extension would place them on different shows as Hogan & Rock & Kane were dominating each individual causing the nWo to resort to a numbers games & other tactics to move the momentum in their favor in what was a fun back & forth match.
""SmackDown"" Mar. '02

World Champion Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Shawn Michaels & Ric Flair were the managers for each individual only for a four way brawl to start in the isleway before the match got started causing them to be sent to the back as Nash was dominate causing Triple H to resort to desperate tactics to just get away from Nash as both men weren't focused on just winning the match causing the referee to be physically involved on more than one occasion until one man just went too far causing his opponent to retaliate with anyone getting in his way, including his own manager, paying the price.
Judgment Day '03

T.L.C. Match: D-Generation X vs. Unified Tag Team Champions JeriShow - DX was out to gain their first set of tag team championship (although technically the New Age Outlaws were tag team champions as members of DX a decade ago). This started out as you would expect with an all-out brawl on the from the ring to the floor all the way to the arm with dueling chair being used. This match had it's various moments with Big Show actually being the M.V.P. of the match like how Triple H was sprawled across a ladder in the corner only for HBK to the thrown against him & be squished by Show, Big Show punched through a chair into Triple H's face, the power of Show destroying more than one ladder with his bare hands, and the comedic ending with Jericho & Show working together to grab the belts only for that to backfire in a nasty way for Jericho as he took the worst fall than anyone else the entire night. If your expecting the heavy ""spotfest"" that you've gotten from TLC/Ladder matches in the past that you won't get it here but this was still a good contest with plenty of moments to not leave you disappointed.
T.L.C.: Tables. Ladders & Chairs '09
[Blu-Ray Edition Of Greatest PPV Matches 2009-2010; DX: One Last Stand]

(Blu-Ray) Scott Hall & Syxx vs. Harlem Heat - Harlem Heat was looking for revenge for the nWo's (specifically Vincent) interference in their recent matches while this was their first match without Sister Sherri in their corner & Nash was in a wheelchair at ringside due to his recent ""injury"" as the Heat came out very aggressive being dominate with their offense of power & athleticism stopping any momentum attempted by Hall & Syxx to the point where Nash came out his chair only to sit back down because of the pain as it came down to which team that was able to take advantage of an opening to be the victors.
""WCW Nitro"" July '97

(Blu-Ray) Kevin Nash vs. The Rock - Nash took the advantage early by overpowering Rock & using his momentum against him while Scott Hall was on the outside making his presence known whenever possible only for Rock to eventually made his comeback before it was revealed the true intentions of Hall & Nash that caused Hulk Hogan to appear to even the odds in what was a short match with the purpose being the reveal of the newest (or returning) member of the New World Order.
""SmackDown"" Mar. '02

(Blu-Ray) Sledgehammer Ladder Match: Triple H vs. Kevin Nash - Both men started trading fist & brawling from the start before the ladders came into play with Nash taking the first shot ramming the ladder into HHH's neck on the outside before he retaliated with a clothesline off the announce table & knocked Nash over the barricade. Back in the ring, Triple H worked over Nash's knees by using the ladder on his knees constantly including applying a figure four with Nash's knees trapped in a ladder. Nash was able to come back & use the ladder as a weapon including irish whipping Triple H hard into the ladder in the corner & also executing his ""vintage"" sideslam into the ladder before the fight went to the floor with Nash attempting to powerbomb Triple H through the announce table only for Triple H to counter with a backdrop onto the table. With additional weapons being brought into the match such as the sledgehammer & a table, this wasn't your typical ladder match as it was more like a ""No Disqualification"" fight with them using ladders instead of chairs & other weapons but this was the best route to go since we know both Triple H & Kevin Nash can't give us the type of match that measures up to the standards set for a ladder match at this point in their careers.
T.L.C.: Tables, Ladders & Chairs '11

(Blu-Ray) Triple H vs. Sting - Both men had unique entrances (which I marked out for being a huge fan of the ""Terminator"" series) while it should be noted that this match could only be won by pinfall or submission. Both men started out having the same idea as far as attempts to take down their opponent before one man was able to get the advantage constantly stopping opponent dead from getting offense before finally being able to take advantage of a mistiming working him over in & outside of the ring before the match evolved into what Michael Cole described as ""The 'Monday Night Wars' have come to WrestleMania"" as you saw guest appearances from the two biggest factions in wrestling during that era along with a battle of ""sledgehammer vs. baseball bat"" in what told a good story as far as being the final battle of WWE vs. WCW and was entertaining for what it was.

The bonus matches on the DVD/bluray are top notch..but I wanted to hear more from the kliq themselves and from those who worked with them during that time period.
