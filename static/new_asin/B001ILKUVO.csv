Hughie was a prolific guitar player and complemented Medlocke's playing beside him both true showmen on the stage, except Thomasson was more laid back!!",1357948800,,247,4.767441860465116
8311162,4,B001ILKUVO,"Lynyrd Skynyrd were always a great band. Hughie Thomasson was a great person that I had the pleasure to meet prior to his untimely death during a reunion tour of the Outlaws. Having been a fan for most of my adult life, He just made you feel special and he always had a kind eye for you.",1350345600,,287,4.052631578947368
8311163,4,B001ILKUVO,"This concert dvd is a shorter version of the ""Live From Steel Town"" DVD by Lynyrd Skynyrd, but it contains the best songs from that concert. The ""Live From Steel Town"" DVD has been discontinued, so this is the next best thing. Plus, you get better cover art, including a close-up picture of the late/great Hughie Thomasson playing guitar, on the cover. The ""Live From Steel Town"" DVD, consisted of 15 songs, with an approximate running time of 97 minutes. This ""Another One From the Road"" DVD contains 9 of these songs, and has an approximate running time of 56 minutes.

The main thing about this dvd, is that it features a great close-up picture of the late/great Hughie Thomasson playing guitar on the cover and in the dvd. Hughie died during 2006, and this dvd was released after his death. This is the only dvd of Lynyrd Skynyrd that has a close-up shot of Hughie on the cover. Hughie was a great Southern Rocker. He founded the band the ""Outlaws"" from Tampa, Florida in the 1970's. He joined Skynyrd in the 1990's. He was a truly great guitar player. This dvd is for the hard-core fan. There's also a companion cd of this.

The Line up:
Rickey Medlocke - vocals, electric, slide, & acoustic guitars, dobro
Johnny Van Zant - lead vocals
Hughie Thomasson - electric, slide & acoustic guitars, background vocals
Gary Rossington - electric, slide & acoustic guitars
Billy Powell - piano, organ
Owen Hale - drums, percussion
Leon Wilkeson - bass
Dale Kranz-Rossington - backing vocals
Carol Chase - backing vocals

The song set:
1. We Ain't Much Different
2. What's Your Name
3. Voodoo Lake
4. That Smell
5. Bring it On
6. Simple Man
7. Sweet Home Alabama
8. Travel'n Man (You get the late Ronnie Van Zant, sing along with Johnny. Ronnie is shown on the big screen.) Plus, you get great slide guitar play from Gary.
9. Freebird - While the current line-up is performing this song, on the big screen, you get scenes from the original version of Skynyrd performing, Ronnie, Steve, Gary, Allen, Billy, Leon, Artimus, and the original honettes Jo Jo Billingsly, Cassie Gaines, & Leslie Hawkins.

Overall, if you have the ""Live From Steel Town"" DVD, then you have everything in this dvd & more. However, if you want better cover art on the front of the dvd package, then you might like this one. On the cover, you get a great picture of Skynyrd's Guitar Army: Hughie Thomasson, Rickey Medlocke, Gary Rossington, & Leon Wilkeson. Thanks!!!",1254182400,3,2434,4.666666666666667
