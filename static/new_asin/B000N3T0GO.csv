2755155,3,B000N3T0GO,"Universal may never have had the prestige of an MGM, but it knew how to make a rousing genre picture (NOBODY did classic horror, better!), and these swashbucklers are great fun...with Errol Flynn providing a first-rate entry in the collection!

""Against All Flags"" (1952): Nearing the end of his WB career, Flynn was allowed an occasional freelance assignment...and Universal welcomed him with a first-rate comedy/adventure, 'A-List' co-stars (Maureen O'Hara and Anthony Quinn), and a veteran director (George Sherman). While lacking the grace of his youth, Flynn has abundant panache and charm as an undercover officer posing as a pirate, and obviously enjoyed making this movie. A bit of trivia: Flynn broke his ankle filming a battle scene, and during his recovery, Universal (never a studio to waste money), utilized the sets to film ""Yankee Buccaneer""! GREAT fun! (4 1/2 stars out of 5)

""Yankee Buccaneer"" (1952): One of the two pictures in the collection directed by comedy and action veteran Fred De Cordova (later famous as ""The Tonight Show"" producer), this brawny B-adventure showcases two rising stars (Jeff Chandler and Scott Brady), and provides an early view of David Janssen, in a small role. While the plot (a U.S. Naval vessel poses as a renegade, to track pirate activities) is no great shakes, the story never drags, and the cast is enjoyable. (2 1/2 stars out of 5).

""Buccaneer's Girl"" (1950): The second De Cordova-directed feature; while the title sounds like a typical RKO/Maureen O'Hara adventure from the '40s, this is, in fact, a light-hearted pirate yarn featuring Yvonne De Carlo as a misplaced Boston entertainer involved with dashing buccaneer captain Philip Friend (an attractive actor who never quite achieved major stardom). There's a lot of Lucille Ball in De Carlo's comic performance, and you may notice TWO of Errol Flynn's classic villains (Robert Douglas and Henry Daniell), on hand to provide mischief! Lovable pirates with hearts of gold, and good, clean family fun. (2 stars out of 5).

""Double Crossbones"" (1951): Donald O'Connor, prior to ""Singing in the Rain"", shows his remarkable dancing skills in this often silly, but likable little family-friendly yarn. As a meek apprentice who accidentally becomes a pirate, the film's success relies on his charm, and for the most part, he delivers. You'll never see Blackbeard, Henry Morgan, or Captain Kidd more sweet-natured than they are portrayed here! Watch for Will Geer, James Arness, Charles McGraw, and Glenn Strange, in supporting roles...(2 stars out of 5).

These titles may not have you dreaming of running off to sea, but at this price, they certainly are worth a few evenings' worth of swashbuckling!",1181433600,112,2704,5.178489702517163

I watched it for years on TV and waited anxiously for it to come out on DVD. When it did not come out in the two Errol Flynn sets I was very disappointed. This is by far a favorite of most Flynn fans. Those of us that especially like ""The Seahawk"", ""Captain Blood"", and ""The Master of Ballantrae"" love it. A must have. The others in this Pirates set are mindless fun too, just not inspirational enough to have me want to see the movie ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or go to Disneyworld to go on the ride as much as ""Against All Flags"". One other thing, the DVD is clear and sharp and the color in ""Against All Flags"" is so clean it looks like a new print.",1178496000,79,756,4.080536912751678

2755160,5,B000N3T0GO,"This collection would be worth the price for the movie Against All Flags.  The others are icing on the cake.  Buccaneer's Girl features Yvonne DeCarlo as a singer in New Orleans who has to free her pirate friend from prison.  See why she was called queen of the B-movies.  Yankee Buccaneer has a really good cast featuring Jeff Chandler, David Janssen and Scott Brady.  The real jewel here though is Against All Flags.  Imagine the pairing of Errol Flynn and Maureen O'Hara, as a pirate herself, in a film that has action, humor and romance.  Anthony Quinn plays a villanous pirate himself in this fun and entertaining film that has been hidden far too long.",1172880000,25,658,4.6695652173913045

2755162,4,B000N3T0GO,"This set looks like it's worthwhile for classic adventure movie lovers. A brief description of each title:

Against All Flags -

In 1700, the pirates of Madagascar menace the India trade; British officer Brian Hawke has himself cashiered, flogged, and set adrift to infiltrate the pirate ""republic."" There, Hawke meets lovely Spitfire Stevens, a pirate captain in her own right, and the sparks begin to fly; but wooing a pirate poses unique problems. Especially after he rescues adoring young Princess Patma from a captured ship. Meanwhile, Hawke's secret mission proceeds to an action-packed climax.

Bucaneer's Girl -

Robin Hood-like pirate Baptiste takes only the ships of rich but wicked trader Narbonne. Fun loving Debbie, a passenger from his latest prize, stows away on the pirate ship and falls for the pirate; later, having become a New Orleans entertainer, she meets his alter ego, who's engaged to the governor's daughter. Sea battles and land rescues follow in lighthearted style.

Yankee Bucaneer -

A United States Navy ship in the first half of the 19th century, under the command of Captain David Porter, is expecting to put ashore after a year on the seas; but the arrival of one of Porter's ex-students, the willful and independent Lieutenant David Farragut, brings a new mission: to disguise the ship and crew as a pirate ship and help the Navy locate the criminals who have been robbing America's merchant fleet. But as Farragut's disobedience threatens the safety of the crew, they stumble upon an international conspiracy.

Double Crossbones -

All I could find was - After being falsely accused of dishonesty, a young man decides to become a pirate.

Piratey goodness for all.",1171756800,29,1700,5.086330935251799

The other two movies are the 'serious' pirate movies; well done, but not as surprisingly enjoyable as the others.  Of the four, the Yvonne d'Carlo movie was best balance of humor and traditional pirate humor.  Yankee buccaneer deviated a little from traditional pirate stories as it is a naval officer undercover--it also focused more on the navel shipmates than on pirate activities.",1438300800,2,636,4.962264150943396

This woman held her own against all comers, and the movie is just a great romp because of it. Errol Flynn is gorgeous as always, and Donald O'Connor does a nice job in ""Double Crossbones,"" a goofy comedy that skewers a lot of genre staples. In one scene he looks remarkably like Johnny Depp! The least successful is ""Yankee Buccaneer,"" but it's still worth having.

2755349,4,B000N3T0GO,"The first film:
Against All Flags is a rip-roaring, swashbuckler tale from 1952.  It stars Errol Flynn, Maureen O'Hara and Anthony Quinn.

Flynn plays a Royal Navy Officer who infiltrates a pirate stronghold at Madagascar.  There he encounters a ruthless pirate (Quinn) and a lovely pirate (O'Hara).  Of course there is romance with complications.

Edward Stevenson's costumes, especially O'Hara's pirate outfits and dresses, are pristine.  The sets are realistic, and the action is top-notch with blazing cannons, sword fights and humor.  Picture and sound quality are excellent.  4 stars

The second film:
Buccaneer's Girl is a 1950 rip-roaring tale in old New Orleans when the French controlled the region. Frederic Baptiste, the notorious cut throat pirate, is raiding the ships of Narbonne who has a stranglehold on the all merchant shipping in the region.

Entering into this fray is a lovely girl from Boston named Debbie McCoy who is captured or should I say captures the pirates with her fiery spirit and beauty.  This sets the stage for an interesting love triangle.

The beautiful Yvonne De Carlo plays Debbie.  Philip Friend is Baptiste who has a dual identify.

When you add in Elsa Lanchester as Madame Brizar and Jay C. Flippen as Jared Hawkins you have a delightful light-hearted romp with marvelous costumes by Yvonne Wood and stirring music by Walter Scharf.

Picture and sound quality are excellent. 4 stars

The third film:
Yankee Buccaneer is a 1952 (filmed as Errol Flynn convalesced and Against All Flags was on hiatus).  It borrows a storyline from the early 1800s with American Naval Officers David Porter and David Farragut who go on a secret mission to discover the pirate base of operations and find themselves enthralled with a beautiful Countess Margarita La Raguna, who holds the key to an international conspiracy.

Jeff Chandler, Scott Brady and Suzan Ball, cousin of Lucille Ball, are well cast for their parts.  Chandler's Captain Porter is an officer by the book; Brady's Farragut is a thorn in Porter's side, and Ball's Countess is an object of admiration by both men.

The fighting takes place on land.  There is one scene where Farragut and a shark tangle which was well done for 1952.

This is a historical fiction using actual people who lived and breathed the salt air and fought pirates.  It is a serious movie, except for the cosmic relief provided by Chief Petty Officer Link and his rum casket.  George Matthews does a great job as Link.

Bill Thomas' costumes were spectacular.  The Countess' gowns were exquisite.

One sad note is that the lovely Suzan Ball would be claimed by cancer in 1955.  She was 21 at the time of her death.

Film four:
Double Crossbones is a whimsical comedy with an infamous list of cutthroats tossed into this song and dance 1951 offering.  This is lighter fare than the other three films in this set.

Donald O'Connor and Will Geer carry this delight to its fruitful end.  Helena Carter played the love interest for O'Connor and the Governor of the Carolinas who was in league with the pirates to enrich his own coffers.

Of course you have sword play and intrigue.  It is a fun-filled romp. Yvonne Wood's costumes are rich and colorful. Picture and sound quality are excellent.  4 stars.",1342915200,,3264,4.904936014625228

Ammy has reduced the UNIVERSAL Pictures set, PIRATES OF THE GOLDEN AGE MOVIE COLLECTION to an unbelievably LOW, LOW price! (NOTE: as of 6/11.)

The first film alone is worth the price of admission.

AGAINST ALL FLAGS (1952) is a classic that stars Errol Flynn, Maureen O'Hara and Anthony Quinn, plus Mildred Natwick and Robert Warwick (as Capt. Kidd).

Directed by Freddie De Kordova, BUCCANEER'S GIRL (1951) is Yvonne De Carlo. The supporting cast includes Elsa Lanchester, Norman Lloyd, Douglass Dumbrille, Connie Gilchrist (of the LONG JOHN SILVER TV show) Dewey Robinson and Jay C. Flippen.

YANKEE BUCCANEER (1952), another De Kordova adventure, is a hybrid of the pirate and western genres. Jeff Chandler and Scott Brady star. Supporting cast includes David Janssen, Jay Silverheels, Michael Ansara and Joseph Calleia.

Finally, there's DOUBLE CROSSBONES (1951), a pirate comedy directed by Charles Barton featuring Donald O'Connor as a most unlikely swashbuckler. Also in the cast: Helena Carter, Will Geer (old man Walton on the TV show), Hayden Rorke (Dr. Bellows on I DREAM OF JEANNIE), Glenn Strange (the monster in ABBOTT & COSTELLO MEET FRANKENSTEIN), Hope Emerson (a classic villainess), Alan Napier and Robert Barrat.",1307750400,3,1321,5.326923076923077

Even the pirate comedies, ""The Princess and the Pirate"" with Bob Hope, and ""Muppet Treasure Island"" are better than these.

All the movies on this DVD were shot on sets with unimaginative scripts, and are unbelievable.

""Buccaneer's Girl"" with Yvonne De Carlo was the best of the lot, but still not worth the effort. Yvonne De Carlo is better in ""Song of Scheherazade"".

2755366,4,B000N3T0GO,"Pirates of the golden age is a collection of four movies from Hollywoods' ""Golden Era"". The four stars represents overall entertainment and value for money given the inherent limitations of these period movies.
First what they have in common, they all originate from the same era, and none are particularly accurate in the way they portray life and conditions of the period they are set in - all carry that 1930's to 1960's Hollywood rose tinted glasses and everything squeaky clean and pretty aura.
A major plus side though is that the gruesom aspects of more modern films are not here, so an afternoon in with younger kids can be very entertaining while missing the blood and guts - it gets a big plus for that.

Against All Flags is the classic Errol Flynn movie - swashbuckling, cheezy outfits typical of the time, boy meets girl, etc etc. Very watchable for all it's limitations.

Buccaneers Girl is set against the backdrop of period New Orleans and again works the boy meets girl theme, however the plot is better than Against All Flags though it has the acting quality typical of the period.

Yankee Bucaneer is perhaps the best of the group, within it's own limitations, it told a notable story in the histories of the United States, Spain, Portugal and Brazil interwoven against a very loosely based pirate background - however it was perhaps the best for showing the life and times aboard ships (again through Hollywood period glasses).

Double Crossbones is interesting in that it attemped to create a pirate musical set in Charleston, SC, but apart from a few instances of quality dance routines, the movie lacked cohesion, the plot was loose, and the characters lacking any significant depth.

If you're into pirates, sailing ships, the sea, or have younger children who are, I'd say you'd not be disappointed - if none of these apply you might wish to invest in entertainment more in line with your preferences.",1286841600,,1926,4.824242424242424

The films, except perhaps Against all flags, were not expensive films, but they do succeed in giving the right atmosphere. This collection shows how much charisma Flynn had though not so young and brisk as in those great early films. Jeff Chandler is O.K., but here he must be so stiff that one does not like him very much. Of course, he will loosen in the end! - I am not sorry that I bought this collection.",1278979200,,634,4.474137931034483
2755369,4,B000N3T0GO,"This is a nice little budget set of pirate movies from Universal/International. Now, don't get me wrong, none of them are really award winners, but they are all passable entertainment on a Saturday afternoon, and the kiddies can watch all four with no worry.

As previously mentioned, ""Against All Flags"" is the real draw here. Flynn, O'Harra, and Quinn are really good. This is a bit late in Flynn's career, but he still has it, and there's a good swordfight at the end.

The other three pictures are notable more for their casts and supporting casts than anything else. ""Buccaneer's Girl"" is pretty good, again, for a Saturday afternoon time-passer. ""Yankee Buccaneer,"" the weakest of the lot, has Jeff Chandler in it, and I've never liked him all that much. This movie didn't change my opinion, but if you look fast you'll see Michael Ansara (the Klingon Commander Kang on Star Trek) as a guard.

The last picture, ""Double Crossbones,"" was kind of a surprise. The other films at least made a ""stab"" at being serious pirate movies, whilst this one was a musical comedy. It was an interesting, even bold choice to add to the set. O'Conner was in good form, and while the few songs aren't memorable, they are entertaining. It was also interesting to see Will ""Grandpa Walton"" Geer as an old salt sailor/pirate.

All four films lack the Robert Newton brogue we've all come to expect from pirates, but these films were made before Newton's version popularized the pirate accent we're so used to today.

The result is kind of so-so.

All four transfers are decent but still sport some minor scratches in the filmed material in itself, while the colors a vivid and sharp. Sound is all over in Mono. No further effort has been made to amplify a bit the width of sound (a pity in this kind of spectacles).

Anyway, for its price it is really a bargain and in our day and age, in which everything costs an eye and a leg, like in those long bygone pirate days, this collection is still worth your attention.
