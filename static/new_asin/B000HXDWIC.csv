2648620,5,B000HXDWIC,"Before he was Wolverine, Hugh Jackman appeared in a gritty prison drama on Australian TV called ""Correlli"".  The Rat Tamer is the first episode of the series to released on DVD.

The Rat Tamer refers to Dr. Louisa Correlli, the new psychologist who has recently begun working at Blackstream Prison.  Correlli is played by Deborra-Lee Furness, who must have made quite an impression on Hugh because they were married a year later and are still married to this day!

The story follows Dr. Correlli as she tries to help a troubled prison guard named Costa who's stressed almost to his limit, as well as a new inmate by the name of Kevin Jones (played by Hugh Jackman).  Jones arrives at Blackstream beaten so badly that is has caused some brain trauma and affected his motor skills.  It's clear that he was somehow assaulted during his transfer, but because of the extent of his injuries, it's not clear why or how they occured.

At the heart of the story is the personal conflict between Jones and Costa.  When their paths cross, the guard becomes obsessed with the memory of a terrible tragedy that happened to his best mate and is fixated on the notion that Jones was somehow involved.

I believe ""Correlli"" is only the second screen appearance of Hugh Jackman's career, but his trademark charisma and intensity are already there...and I just love that Aussie accent!  The Rat Tamer is intriguing and compelling enough to want to see the rest of the series...it leaves you wanting more and wondering...what happens next?",1176681600,20,1520,4.789272030651341
2648621,5,B000HXDWIC,"I saw this as the pilot episode of a prison drama series from Australia TV called CORRELLI.  It focused on life in prison, mainly viewed from the eyes of a prison psychologist named Louisa Correlli.  The whole series was  a gripping and realistic dramatization of various lives of prisoners and the people who administered their penal sentences.  Hopefully, the rest of the episodes will also be released on DVD as the entire series is quite excellent.

This first episode marked Hugh Jackman's first professional appearance, direct from acting school. Even at that time, Hugh had already shown a  range of dramatic talent that will mark some of his future work, such as his early award-winning role in Erskineville Kings and some of his 2006 film releases  ( The Fountain and The Prestige). To fans of Hugh Jackman, this film is also interesting because the actress who played the role of Louisa Correlli very effectively is Deborra Lee Furness, now Mrs. Hugh Jackman.

The episode released on this DVD is a compelling drama of prison life and what it does to those affected by such personal tragedies.",1158969600,50,1103,4.89247311827957

2648643,3,B000HXDWIC,"Two ratings: 2~3 for the movie and 5 stars for Hugh Jackman's performance. For those arm chair directors and critics out there, have you ever seen or been around a freshly brain damaged person? I didn't think so. Jackman nails it and nails it properly. As far as acting goes, this is his benchmark--not the Sci-Fi Wolverine character. That said, I really enjoy watching all of his films.",1417219200,,387,4.705882352941177
2648644,1,B000HXDWIC,"Everyone started somewhere. And they weren't all blessed with the choice of working with a good script, or other good actors, or decent editing, or even adequate lighting and cameramen. Although he does play a prominent role, Hugh Jackman isn't even the central character in this film. The story May have been good. Unfortunately, almost everything else about the movie made it all but unwatchable. I jumped ahead during the worst parts that I could tell weren't necessary to move the story ahead. I believe the whole experience took me about 30 minutes.
Basically, a female prison psychologist realized that one of the inmates (Hugh Jackman) had received significant brain damage while at another facility. One of the guards that she was also trying to help, had been a guard at the other facility when a close friend and colleague was found hanged. The guard blamed Jackman's character, and had a mental breakdown because of the stress.
The psychologist had to find a way to help them both before something very bad happened.
But she still had to have the cliche ""I hate you for making my dad cheat on you and abandon us all!"" fights with her teenage daughter.
To recap: bad script, bad direction, bad lighting, bad editing, bad acting (could have been good acting making the best of bad writing, I don't know), horrible awful cheesy soundtrack,
I can't think of anything positive to say about the film.",1416441600,2,1405,4.83402489626556
2648645,2,B000HXDWIC,Like Hugh jackman but shut this off 10 minutes into it,1415059200,,54,4.0
2648646,4,B000HXDWIC,Kind of slow at first but did get better as it went on. Love Aussie films,1414972800,,73,3.625
2648647,4,B000HXDWIC,Love Hugh Jackman.  i can see why he likes to play Wolverine though.,1412380800,,68,4.230769230769231

2648649,3,B000HXDWIC,This was a really difficult movie to follow and definitely one of Jackman's first movies. He was not bigger than life as he has been in his latest movies. I never did see art! LOL!,1403395200,,180,4.171428571428572
2648650,3,B000HXDWIC,I really didn't enjoy this movie.  I am glad I have the opportunity to try it.  Thank you for making it available.,1397520000,,114,4.136363636363637
2648651,4,B000HXDWIC,"If you are a fan of Hugh Jackman, you will enjoy seeing him in one of his first roles.  In ""Rat Tamer,"" he gives a sensitive portrayal of a prisoner who has suffered brain damage during his incarceration.  The main star of ""Rat Tamer,"" however, is the title character, portrayed by Deborah Furness, who later became better known as Mrs. Hugh Jackman.  At the time this pilot for a later Australian television series was made, she was well-known throughout Australia and certainly deserves critical acclaim in her own right.  I hope that in the not-too-distant future that the entire series will be available to American audiences.",1378080000,,630,4.915094339622642
2648672,2,B000HXDWIC,"This is episode 1 of the series 'Correlli' and the remaining 9 episodes are not available at this time.  Unfortunately, this could make viewing quite unsatisfying.  I also looked to see if the remaining episodes are for sale and they are not. Just so you know...",1373673600,2,262,4.673913043478261
2648673,5,B000HXDWIC,"Hugh looks so young in this dvd, which he is so I guess he should look young. I like Deborah-Lee also and because I knew he married her it was so much more interesting to see the interaction between the two. I tried to get the Corelli series but it's not available. Wish it was!!!!",1367539200,,281,4.127272727272727
2648674,1,B000HXDWIC,"I only saw more snow and grain in corn field.
Transfer is atrocious, and I never made it past the opening 30 seconds.
Come on...if you are going to release DVDs, please make them viewable. We have he technology.
And I am a Jackman fan.",1327536000,,235,4.2444444444444445
2648675,4,B000HXDWIC,"""The Rat Tamer"" is the pilot of the ten episodes which comprise the Australian series ""Corelli"". Why the powers-that-be decided to release only this one episode in Region 1, is beyond me...The episode does NOT stand alone well, as it leaves too many unanswered questions, greatly frustrating the viewer (think sex without the orgasm...). The four star rating is for the series, rather then this DVD alone. You can purchase, like I did, the Region 4 series from an Australian vendor, and watch it on your computer if you do not own a region free DVD player (or use cables to connect your computer to your TV).

Regarding ""Corelli"": Despite Jackman's top billing, the series actually stars Deborra-Lee Furness (Jackson's future wife) as Louisa Corelli, a divorced mother of two and a newly minted prison psychologist. Her struggle to balance her professional and personal life becomes compounded by her growing relationship with Kevin Jones, a young man serving time for armed robbery (Hugh Jackman). Each episode is a somewhat self enclosed story, with the exception of the most intriguing Corelli/Jones theme. Though rather naive and cliched in its treatment of complex psychological issues, this fourteen year old series remains relevant to the contemporary viewer. However, if you are expecting a lot of screen time for Jackman and plenty of sexual fireworks between Corelli and Jones...well, skip it, or you'll be dissapointed. The series offers a safe and savory ending for the character of Corelli, though perhaps not equally satisfactory to a Jackman fan...

My one and only gripe regarding this series is the odd portrayal of the Australian prison system...I do not know much about the topic, but felt amuzed when female guards were shown taking male prisoners to the showers (isn't it some sort of a human rights violation for both parties?), and that the unarmed staff seemed to freely mingle with the prison population (hostage, anyone?), not to mention the uber tight micro shorts worn as a uniform by many prisoners (an anti-smuggling measure?...).

Anyway, I enjoyed the stories as well as watching the undeniable chemistry between Furness and Jackman. I recommend the series to any Jackman and/or prison drama fan.",1244678400,,2228,5.132231404958677
2648676,4,B000HXDWIC,"Good early work by Hugh Jackman that just left me wanting to know the rest of the story.  This is a pilot for an Australian TV show that can't be bought in the US.  Lots of subplots and side stories going on here too, so if you're only interested in Jackman you're going to be skipping forward a lot, like I did.",1229299200,,312,4.016129032258065
2648677,1,B000HXDWIC,I am a HUGE Jackman fan and had high expectations of his first on-screen appearance. Jackman did have pretty good acting but he was not the main character and thus was only in limited scenes. I was not impressed by the performances of the rest of the cast nor did I find the plot particularly engrossing. You will be better off watching an episode of Law & Order.,1224633600,3,363,4.352941176470588
2648678,3,B000HXDWIC,"I bought this because I'm a Hugh Jackman fan (who isn't?), and it's marketed as a Hugh Jackman film, but that's just marketing.  See it, but see it because of the ensemble, not just Jackman.  It was the pilot for an Australian series starring Jackman's future real-life wife, Deborra-Lee Furness.  It's clearly ""TV,"" not big screen.  But Furness is positively luminescent; her acting is straight and true, she's gorgeous but still ""real.""  One can see why Jackman totally fell for her.  I recently saw her in Jindabyne (2006) and she's simply an excellent actress, well worth watching.  Jackman is there, but doesn't get to flex his acting muscles the way he does in later stuff.  William Zappa, as an emotionally tortured prison guard, is so believable you both ache for him and want to punch him out.  Unfortunately their technical advisors didn't bother to research the real way pros hold handguns, but oh well.  I suggest renting it.",1214697600,7,937,4.8734177215189876
2648679,5,B000HXDWIC,"I ordered ""The Rat Tamer"" because I was interested in Hugh Jackman's early works.  It was so good that I ordered the whole series from Australia.  Unfortuneately, it is a Region 4 DVD, but I have a player that is all Region, well worth the purchase.  It is a haunting story,
very well done.  Although it is a prison drama and very rough at times, I can't help thinking how much worse it would be if done by Hollywood.  Nothing is beyond the need to tell a story; the violence, cursing, drugs
are there but not shoved down your throat.  Each episode has its own story but through it all there is the interaction between Kevin(Hugh Jackman) and Dr Corelli(Deborrah-Lee Furness).  You keep waiting for their next appointment to see what happens.  It was worth the effort to find it, I just wish that ""Corelli"" and ""Paperback Hero"" were issued in Region 1 format, they would both make great Christmas gifts.",1193097600,6,903,4.565217391304348

2648681,4,B000HXDWIC,"In the second place, Hugh Jackman is beautiful.  In the first place he is a fine actor.  And Deborra-Lee Furness does her usual masterful job of developing character.  The film introduces us to prison life in Australia showing anguish, and working at the job of living.  I'm hoping the rest of the series continues this, and is soon available for viewing.  I'm told this is based on true events, and that the psychologist was disbarred because of the relationship.  Also nice to see fine drama beyond what the U. S. offers.",1179964800,12,523,4.6923076923076925

What the description does not say,  is that this is only the first episode of the Australian TV series, ""Corelli"", which is made of 10 episodes.
I'm not complaining about the dvd,  it was in perfect condition. However,  now I have to find the other nine episodes to complete the show.",1485734400,2,399,4.424657534246576

8142426,2,B000HXDWIC,"I purchased this item thinking that it was the show Corelli. Sadly it is only the first episode of the series which - in my opinion - is pointless to buy. Rat Tamer is the title of the pilot episode to this series. Don't get me wrong; Deborra-lee Furness and Hugh Jackman's performances are great but after spending almost nineteen dollars on this to only see one episode, I am very disappointed.

The worst part is that I still have yet to find any place that I can purchase the rest of the series. So if you watch this and become interested in seeing the rest of the show... good luck with that.",1426118400,,597,4.283185840707965
