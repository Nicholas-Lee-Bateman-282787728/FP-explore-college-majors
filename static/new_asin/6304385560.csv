853427,5,6304385560,"A charming and light hearted Christmas story. Well acted and directed. I believe the entire production was the best low budget film I ever watched.
Don't look for special effects that substitute for lack of plot and writing. These lesser known actors got the most out of the storyline and delivered. Obviously I enjoyed it and think most will also.",1427846400,2,348,4.816666666666666
853428,5,6304385560,This is a film I've used many times.  I find that it works well as a teaching aid with middle school youth.  It is very helpful for illustrating the use of prayer with young people.,1423612800,,181,4.142857142857143

853524,4,6304385560,"Good-looking Actor - Greg Kinnear, stars in this delightful, heart-warming, United States Postal and Community Miracle..., which results in letters addressed to God, as only a believing heart of all ages, can write them. One with true, heartfelt faith. But how, can a Postal Worker deliver mail to God and make requested miracles, come true? Especially since, he thinks that it's all a joke and seemingly can't deliver the DEAR GOD letters, anyway? When one is trying to get the Lords' attention by way of prayers, that's one thing. But actually delivering thousands of written DEAR GOD letters?? That's a whole different matter, altogether! And by a con-man, no less? Peace on earth and good will towards all men by way of a Postal Con-man. That's a very unique and strange twist in matters of delivery, both spiritually and tangibly. But, that's what the movie's and comedy's are all about. Within this color, single-disc, DVD comedy a con-man (Greg Kinnear) turns over a new leaf, well... with a little mandated help, from a no nonsense Judge. In that, he'd better find work quick, do right, obey the laws and keep his job for at least a year or off to jail, he goes. But, for a habitual con-man that's easier said than done. But, how can he comply by sorting and delivering seemingly 'undeliverable' mail which ranges from letters addressed to: The Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus, Elvis and now..., DEAR GOD letters? Was it mere coincidence that he was placed, there? Or is he a con-artist that actually has a good heart and who just needs an outlet opportunity, to show forth all the goodness that's buried deep within him? With his preconditioned environment set, was this master of deceit out smarted by God? Laughs all the way around and funny man - Actor/Comedian Tim Conway, has a part to play within this United States Post Office one of a kind, miracle. You'll like this movie! It's an easy film to watch and a comedy, too! So, go ahead and pop the popcorn, relax, enjoy and have a laugh! A comedy keeper. Nina Kish",1408320000,,2021,4.711864406779661

853526,5,6304385560,"This is a comedy about one who chose crime as a way of making a living.  Until one day life caught up with him.  And, he was given the choice to turn his life around.  He was ordered by the Courts to get a job at the Post Office.  And, there him and some co-workers came up with the idea to answer mail that don't get delivered.  They seek out to help the down and trodden.  It started out innocent until people started sending in money.  Plus it is illegal to tamper with the USPS mail.  But, in the end.  He make the right choice to stop living a life of crime.  And, to become a law abiding citizen.",1401840000,,602,3.9831932773109244
853527,5,6304385560,This is one of the those movies where there is a real plot and not just a bunch of action or computer images. No oscars here but deffinately a good movie,1391126400,,153,3.967741935483871
853528,5,6304385560,This is the 2nd time I saw this movie......i always remembered the title due to its clever setting in the post office.,1390435200,,118,4.409090909090909
853529,5,6304385560,I REMEMBERED THIS MOVIE FROM SEEING IT SOME YEARS BACK.  I ENJOY GOOD MOVIES.  THIS IS A DELIGHTFUL STORY.  I HAVE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH VIEWING IT.  IT CAME IN PERFECT CONDITION AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING IT MUCH MORE.,1384387200,,224,4.390243902439025
853530,5,6304385560,"Many lessons - lying, thinking you deserve less, etc.  I liked the movie - Laurie Metcalf was great as usual.",1376697600,,109,4.45
853531,4,6304385560,"Greg Kinnear plays a compulsive gambler who is in debt to a loan shark. He must get a job after appearing in court and getting offered a choice between going to jail and getting that job. He winds up at the Post Office for the Christmas period and when he inadvertently opens up a letter to God. For some reason he decides to answer it with some jewelry he steals from the Post Office dead letter files. When he sends his cashed paycheck along it is an accident and he chases it but can't get it. The rest of the dead letter staff gets the spirit and things keep giving. There are several well known actors in this movie and they do an excellent job. Tim Conway, Laurie Metcalf, Hector Elizondo (although it is a reach to see a Hispanic having to portray what I guess is suppose to be a Russian accent), and Roscoe Lee Brown. When Brown gets pinched for giving a horn to a bum musician he gets grabbed by the Feds. Greg comes forward and says he did it all. At trial the whole gang comes forth and states they are the leader. Of course all ends well for the good guys.",1376697600,4,1068,4.189320388349515
853692,5,6304385560,Great movie.  Maybe more for women than men but it is a very cute movie.  Gives hope to the world that there are still good guys,1375401600,3,128,3.8846153846153846
853693,5,6304385560,"I truly enjoy Christian movies for the great stories they tell and because they lack the filth most Hollywood movies seem intent on putting into every movie.  At the end of the day, movies are just story telling, whether it be around the camp fire, or in motion picture format.  I do understand that a high percentage of the Christian movies I like lack a big budget, use lower quality film, cameras, sound, even the acting isn't always on as high a level as the top well known actors.

So when a movie is able to combine the big budget perks with a great story line, I really love it.  Not just for my own personal viewing enjoyment, but because it is nice to know a good message can get a wide distribution and hopefully have a positive impact on a wider than Christian audience. Soul Surfer, Chronicles of Narnia, Lord Of The Rings (not for young kids due to violence), Roman Holiday.

This movie does just that, a great story line, high budget, well known actors and actresses, it is a genuinely funny movie.  For those concerned about an overly Christian message, no need to worry, this humor and message is more along the lines of Evan Almighty.",1373500800,4,1151,4.483253588516747

853697,5,6304385560,Greg seems to always do good dramas or is out for everyone's heart. This film does the most with it's ability to really influence your compassionate side.,1356739200,,154,4.7407407407407405
853698,5,6304385560,"more like a ""pay it dforward""  movie.  wish more people would live like this.  never heard of a ""dear God"" basket in the dead letter office, but why not. each letter a prayer waiting to be filled.  takes people along with God to do that.",1354924800,,237,4.2
853699,5,6304385560,Oddball comedy but very fun. Although not a tradional Christmas movie it does take place a Christmas time so I consider it one of my holiday favorites. Highly recommended.,1353715200,,171,4.931034482758621

I watch this movie to get in the proper Christmas mood but it is fun to watch at any time of year.  Tim Conway is great in this film and I smile just thinking about his role as a burnt out mail carrier.  If you need a little levity in you life this is a great film to lift your spirits.,1233273600,,418,3.5604395604395602

Greg Kinnear is fun, the rest of the characters are great to watch, and even though the story is a little weak at times, it still makes you laugh.

7869029,4,6304385560,"Greg Kinnear acted in this Christmas movie about unlikely postal workers answering God's mail at the Los Angeles Post Office. Greg played Tom Turner, a con-artist in debt, who must work to stay out of prison. He gets a job at the post office in the dead letter office with two burnouts; a former lawyer Rebecca (Laurie Metcalf from Roseanne) and Dooley (Tim Conway). There are other notable cast members like Anna Marie Horsford (Amen), Roscoe Lee Browne and Hector Elizondo as their co-workers.

Tom mistakenly answers a letter which leads to miracles or good deeds by an unlikely group of people. I have to say that this film is my favorite Garry Marshall movie of all time. He appears in the finale as the postmaster general. Other cast members include Rue McClahanan as Tom's blind mother and Jack Klugman as a suicidal senior citizen at the beach.

Greg Kinnear does an admirable and heartwarming job as Tom Turner. There are no extra special features on this DVD. With an exemplary cast and a first rate director like Gary Marshall, I wished there were more special features.",1484784000,,1081,4.775401069518717

I'm not a big fan of comedy movies but wanted to own a copy of this one because of some shoot locations and some people that made cameos who worked at City of Industry post office. They also did shoots at the old Terminal Annex building where I also had worked. I loved that building with all hardwood floors and lots of polished brass everywhere.,1469404800,,404,4.328947368421052
