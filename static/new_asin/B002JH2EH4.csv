3938425,1,B002JH2EH4,"Why are they releasing this?  It is just a repeat release of a few season 3 episodes.  Any real BARNEY MILLER fan really wants season 4.. and 5 and 6 and 7  and 8!  I am delighted they have released the seasons they have done so far.  But this DVD makes no sense.  Except for someone who only wants a sampling of a few shows.  They should just get on with releasing season 4. For the most part BARNEY MILLER just kept getting better as the seasons progressed.

I gave this 1 star because of the fact that the release is unnecessary.  For content I would have given it 4 stars.",1251763200,68,576,4.117117117117117
3938426,2,B002JH2EH4,I agree with the other reviewers. Why re-hash old dvd releases where there are almost 100 episodes of Barney Miller that have never been released on DVD? Bring on season 4 and stop double dipping.,1297296000,,196,4.628571428571429
3938427,5,B002JH2EH4,"I did not purchase this DVD,no reason,I just entend to purchase season by season. I gave it 5 Stars because it contains selected episodes which are from the various seasons of Barney Miller which makes them just as Funny, so enjoy them all ...",1285632000,,243,4.545454545454546
3938428,1,B002JH2EH4,"It took almost 4 years to release 3 seasons of this great comedy.
How ridiculous that it took that amount of time!  I wish Sony would quit wasting time on stuff like this ""greatest hits"" dvd and move on with releasing the remaining seasons, which is what people that are fans of this show really want to purchase!",1266710400,4,313,4.396551724137931
3938429,5,B002JH2EH4,"To me, Barney Miller was good TV.  All the characters were believable and so were the storylines. I rarely missed an episode and now find that reruns are broadcast on Sunday nights.  That is what prompted me to buy my own copies. Now I can look at them when I want, not wait for reruns.",1265155200,2,286,4.181818181818182
3938430,2,B002JH2EH4,"As others have pointed out, true fans of the show have no use for this release.  But the casual fans might.  I give the studio credit for not releasing this DVD before the complete season.  That would be ""double-dipping""; this isn't.",1264118400,3,233,4.634146341463414
3938431,3,B002JH2EH4,"Thanks for the wonderful service!  I am very happy to have so many beloved old tv shows available to me.  This dvd, however, calls itself fan favorites, which made me think it might have some of my favorite episodes.  In fact it is only a few episodes from season 3, which I already have.  Not the seller's fault, but for future customers, that's all it is.",1262131200,33,357,4.363636363636363
3938432,5,B002JH2EH4,"I agree that Sony should get off the dime and get the other seasons out but Season three is where the series begins to hit its stride--Werewolf, Quarantine, Recluse, Christmas Story--these are some of the great hallmarks of Barney Miller.  We need more but this is a five in my book",1256774400,3,282,4.529411764705882
3938433,1,B002JH2EH4,"As others have said, Sony should get on with season 4 already and quit wasting time on junk like this.",1255824000,28,102,4.15
3938434,1,B002JH2EH4,Get on with releasing the final season sets and stop double dipping.  Better yet... figure out a way to sell DVD on demand... or just release episodes digitally.,1251936000,4,161,4.75
3938435,1,B002JH2EH4,"C'mon....what goes on here. Barney Miller was popular enough to have lasted EIGHT seasons. There's got to be enough fans that want to see the remaining 5 seasons. This is a waste. Any fan of the series has these episodes.

No wonder people bootleg movies & TV shows, it's not right but Quit the marketing gimmicks & get those other seasons released.",1251849600,11,349,4.629032258064516

8371437,1,B002JH2EH4,"This was one of my favorite shows. But it's quite the coincidence-- for a show that lasted 8 seasons, the all-time fan favorite episodes happen to be the first 8 episodes of season 3, in order. That must be one of the greatest runs of any tv show in history. Which is strange because I didn't find any of them to stand out.

If you want to release a budget disc, fine-- call it ""half of season 3"". Dont LIE to your customers by declaring ""The most popular episodes ever!"" and ""all-time fan favorites"".  Because that makes me angry and I will never purchase another set from you again.",1396396800,8,584,4.348623853211009
8371438,5,B002JH2EH4,This is a must for Barney Miller fans. Just what you need to go back in time for a couple of hours. Timely shipping.,1384646400,,116,3.875

episodes from this DVD.",1384560000,,146,4.653846153846154
