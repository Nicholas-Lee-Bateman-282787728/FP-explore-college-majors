3976080,5,B002RUNMMO,"This entire series is masterfully done!  Instead of a bunch of facts and figures delivered by the usual talking heads often seen in documentaries, this series focuses on 12 individuals that were on the front lines during the war.  The battles of WWII are told in their own words, through their letters, reports, and interviews, making the entire documentary intensely personal.  The narration provided by Gary Sinise seamlessly intertwines the personal accounts with the facts of the battles and strategies used, giving the viewer all of the background information they need to understand what's going on without being the least bit intrusive.  The added backdrop of the never-before-seen color WWII footage of the events really makes it seem as if the viewer is right in the middle of the action; watching and experiencing everything for themselves.  History teachers and textbook authors take note: this is how history should be taught!",1258675200,71,938,5.226666666666667
3976081,5,B002RUNMMO,"This is the greatest documentary about the greatest story ever told. We think we are scared of terrorists....give me a break....terrorists are pimples on our posteriors compared to the fear the Nazis and Japs put the world through. Not only is this documentary visually breathtaking, but the meticulous research of each of the stories, the strategies of the war, and the perspective it gives the viewer is like nothing I've ever seen before. It truly proves that they were the greatest generation, the generation we should all strive to be. This documentary should be in every school...let the teacher close the book and pop this in as a history lesson because it can not be told better than this. I can't say enough about it. Jack Yusen was the best! ""He went to go see his muddah on the back porch!""",1258675200,23,801,4.6879432624113475

3976083,5,B002RUNMMO,"I have watched this series on the History channel and it is unbelievable. Although very graphic at times, the color footage is extrordinary and the comments by the veterans add a new dimension and at times will break your heart. Of all the WWII series I have seen this probably the best overall. The History channel has done a great job. I just wish the DVD was available right now. If you are at all interested in this part of US history or had a relative or friend who served in this war, you will want to get this series.",1258675200,141,524,4.25
3976084,5,B002RUNMMO,"This came in a very close second in my favorite mini-series ever. Right behind Band of Brothers. Even though this series was different from B.o. B (being that the whole series was actual footage from WWII and not acting), it was still an amazing show to watch. Real footage from the war and interviews from actual soldiers that were in the war was perfect. Some of the video was graphic, but that made it real and worth watching. I rarely get teary eyed, but some of those interviews and some of the concentration camp footage, got to me. After seeing the first part, it makes you want to see more. And the other 9 parts of the series certainly delivered. I would highly recommend this to any World War buffs or to anyone who wants to see how much our veterans went through.",1258675200,127,774,4.419580419580419

If you come into this thinking every bit of footage comes from exactly what is being talked about, you'll be disappointed.  The color footage is used to give a sense of the events, not an exact record.  This well assembled documentary is a great intro to the war but not for hardcore history buffs.

There is absolutely ZERO coverage of the war in Europe. There's nothing about hitler, Mussolini, Poland, Russia, nothing! It's ridiculous! The narrator mentions the European theater vaguely (example: ""Hitler's armies invade Poland France and Russia"" and then it cuts and turns into a 45 minute showing of the invasions in the pacific with awesome footage, details, and even eye witness accounts.

What the heck? Lol did the History channel forget to do their homework on European side of WW2? Lol

Overall its great footage, details, and accounts but this 3 DVD collection is mainly focused on the war in the Pacific literally... 99% WW2 in the Pacific - 1% WW2 in Europe.",1492560000,,808,4.926470588235294

I am NOT a military or war buff, but I am a big fan of documentaries.  I really appreciate the way they searched the world over for private and old archival footage from these wars and used real veterans to tell their stories in this series. My one grandfather, a step grandfather, and four of my great uncles served in WWII, so it gave me an idea of what it was like for them and what they went through.  {They all survived.}  Unfortunately, so many people the world over did not.  What a brutal war.

I just really like this series and am glad I bought it.  I think they did a fine job putting it together.  Like that Gary Sinise narrated too.",1446854400,2,821,4.178343949044586

3976155,5,B002RUNMMO,"When I originally decided to purchase World War II in HD,  I chose the Collectors Edition on DVD because it appeared to have a major advantage over the Blu-ray edition: it added two bonus programs (The Battle for Iwo Jima, The Air War) to the set. Besides, I figured, it would probably provide video quality nearly as good as BD

As it turns out, I ended up purchasing World War II in HD on Blu-ray as well. And Im glad I did.

 World War II in HD is, of course, the outstanding 10-part miniseries produced in 2009 by The History Channel. Using breathtaking color original newsreel footage from many of the major battlefields of the Second World War, this series traces the progress of the war through the experiences of twelve veterans  ten who were members of the Armed Services, and two who were journalists embedded with fighting units.

Each of the 45-minute episodes is simply riveting to watch. Many of the scenes shown are pretty graphic many scenes of dead, dying, and wounded from all sides of the conflict. Those veterans still living tell their stories in interviews. Voice-over artists read from letters and journals written by the veterans. Gary Sinise (Forrest Gump, CSI: New York) provides a deep, rich-toned narration for all of the episodes.

Although I really like the Collectors Edition of World War II in HD on DVD, I like the Blu-ray edition even better. In the Blu-ray set, video fills the entire screen of my HDTV, instead of being windowboxed as it is in the DVD set.  Colors are just as bright, and images are even sharper and clearer that is, as clear and sharp, as 70-year old 8- and 16mm film will allow. Audio quality (DTS-Master) remains, of course, top-notch.

 World War II in HD is documentary filmmaking at its best. Highly recommended.",1445904000,17,1771,4.702265372168285

I learned quite a lot from the veterans who spoke during the series.  I liked the opinion of the filmmaker who said that every individual who has any authority to send troops to war should view the Marine's documentary, "" With the Marines at Tarawa"" before blindly hyping the so-called ""glories"" of war.  War is a terrible thing and though it may be sometimes necessary, it should be undertaken only with the gravest of intent and with the fortitude to win and end it as soon as  possible.

Repeatedly throughout the ten episodes, narrator Gary Sinise uses ""our"" and ""we"" when discussing American troops, battles and materiel. If this is indeed a serious photojournalistic document, it needs to avoid that collective perspective in its narration. Yes, the papers of the day during WWII routinely talked about ""our"" successes and challenges, but that was 70 years ago and journalistic style and tone has changed, and this is a modern-day narration. No current-day reputable news source would use this perspective in reporting the facts on an American war.",1437868800,,628,5.29

3976170,4,B002RUNMMO,"Being called ""WWII in HD"" and me being someone who is not too familiar with the subject of WWII (outside of what I learned in school), I thought this would be a good documentary to start... not really.

It is US-centric and shows the war from a very personal perspective. This is fantastic if you are familiar with the war already, but if you are a beginner like me, do yourself a favor and watch a documentary or read a book that covers the war from a broad and neutral perspective. Have an understanding of the events and politics involved, THEN go back and watch this documentary.

That all being said, don't pass on this one. It had the highest production values of any of the WWII documentaries I have watched so far. The footage is beautiful and often quite brutal (although the colorization look a bit over-saturated at times). The sound quality with the footage also shines here and the music and narration is great... But really all that HD quality production is only there to enhance the stories of real people involved in the war, which are really what make WWII in HD great.",1436227200,,1086,4.535714285714286

3976173,5,B002RUNMMO,"It's true what they say that, ""unless you fought the war, you don't know what it's really like"". This amazing mini-series takes you there in high definition, and it is all in color! I can't imagine how painstaking the process took, to make this all possible. I saw this on the History channel of course (they have great educational documentaries) and I was hooked!!! I like war stuff, always have, can't say why cause I don't know myself. And of course this doesn't cover all of those who fought in the war, but only a select few who are still alive today, to tell their stories. This covers 12 veteran's tales of how their life was like on the front lines. No b.s. no beating around the bush..these films tell and show everything about the war, things people back in those times, were never shown, not suitable for children. If you like watching war movies and documentaries, you must add this to your collection! You won't be disappointed I promise! ",1434067200,2,952,4.6

3976180,5,B002RUNMMO,"America had just started it's  coming out of the world war & my uncles were starting new families.  Most were all WW ll vets never talking about it for 50 yrs. History of it wasn't taught in any kind of detailed facts, just general dates of it starting & ending.  I grew up asking about what America went through just before I was born in a new generation they called "" The Baby Boon "" .. It took many years of facts from government records, eye witness accounts & private letters & pictures of the  Dads , Uncles & Brothers who fought this war hidden away in attics.  I  had known so many families including my own that  had not known how or why a family member that  passed away had these war medals upon them in the casket They simply didn't know what they did in the war.  I can't blame the vet when all they wanted was to forget the horrors of war  & start out a family in the late 1940s & early 50s.  This WWII disc will fill in all the gaps & more.  One may even see pictures of your Dad or Uncle's units they fought with. It is note worthy to say that through all these years passed by, the VFW & American Legion were always there for families of our war vets.  History should be told & shown in detail with & without the propaganda that often gets used by the evil ones.  To know history is to learn from it. This war was shared by all & in the home front of America & England.  Everyone had to live without some of the niceties of home, rationing of gas, foods, wares  & air raid alerts at night. Women had to work mothers & grand parents. The back yard vegetable gardens of today came from Victory gardens family had, to add more food for households. News accounts of the war would be shown at movie theaters & broadcast over the air on radio which many families gathered around to hear of their loved ones fighting the wars in Europe & the Pacific theaters. It was scary for many to hear of the events going on half way around the world. If there were Televisions & DVD players in the day 70 yrs ago, family members would of been so distraught seeing the war that some would of fainted seeing this collection of WWII.  You watch this collection & you will know what your Grandfathers, Uncles, Cousins had to go through. Hitler had a list of American cities he wanted to bomb & the Japs actually sending balloon bombs over the US mainland. It was truly amazing how we won this war fought on so many fronts with our guard down & a military build up of forces 100 fold in such a short period.

All of my Grandfathers fought in WWII, and as a person very interested in history I used to attend WWII round tables where a bunch of vets would grab a dinner and swap stories. Seeing these films in color helps bring such an unbelievable story about world wide conflict even more into reality.

It's well organized. The stories are a mix of actual interviews with the vets and historical videos of their story.

3976515,1,B002RUNMMO,"I prefer Frank Capra's Why We Fight over this tripe...Although the clips have been seen in previous documentaries, this tripe shows it's political left wing slant. ""Right Wing and Left Wing"" are post World War II terms created by the liberal left during the 60's and 70's to push their socialist agenda and demonize the right, and yet the narrator uses them whenever he is referring to the fascist uprisings in Germany, Italy and Japan. The most blatant of these uses was calling the Japanese culture as ""Right Wing feudal monarchy who looks to their emperor as a god.""

I was really looking forward to seeing this documentary in color. Technically the colorizing of the footage leaves a lot to be desired, but with old film...was to be expected. Shame on the Discovery Channel and History Channel for letting their COMMUNIST bias taint a historical event.",1415577600,3,856,4.863013698630137

3976654,5,B002RUNMMO,"This series is more than just a historical time line of events of World War II. Even the fact that it uses archival footage that was filmed in color pales in comparison to the personal accounts of some of the participants, from a wide range of backgrounds, that it traces through their experiences in totally different areas of the globe. It contains very human stories of trials and tribulations that many of us couldn't imagine, from personal letters, interviews, and journals.

3976776,4,B002RUNMMO,"This is an amazing show with tons of original content from people in the war (letters, journals, etc.) as well as incredible color video footage.  I was very impressed by the fact that the video included in this series is all recently-discovered footage that has not been publicly shown before.  They also have great maps and zooms from location to location that really help to understand the scale and geographies involved.  I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more or experiencing some of what the people in the war experienced.

My only complaint is that there is not enough video of the machinery and weapons used in the war, and this is why it gets four stars instead of five.  I find these topics especially fascinating and every episode I find myself annoyed by how short the clips are of battleships firing their guns, soldiers working an artillery piece, etc.  I haven't finished the whole series yet, but if they don't put more of this type of footage in toward the later episodes I will be disappointed.  I will also keep my fingers crossed that someone will put together a documentary or series using this same source material but focusing more on the weapons and machinery.

UPDATE - After finishing the series, I can admit that I may be unique in my desire for more of the footage I mentioned above.  I still feel that there were not enough long scenes of the tools and machinery of war in use, but perhaps others would not feel the same way.

Another point to add was that there were many long scenes of corpses and dead people.  While this is definitely a major part of the war and something never to be forgotten, parents should be aware of this and should potentially watch some of the episodes before deciding whether to allow their younger children to watch it.",1409270400,,1806,4.630094043887147

We really enjoyed the stories of the real lives that played in the two sides of the war - in Europe and in the Pacific. Amazing detail and the footage was humbling and surreal. When our daughters are old enough, maybe in the later teens, we will have them watch this series along with The Pacific so they to can take in, and hopefully and take hold, and appreciate the freedoms, not only us Americans have, but all of the world since World War 1 and 2.

3976792,4,B002RUNMMO,"I am not a history enthusiast so I found this series more informative than entertaining. All video is real footage as a background to true stories told through 12 different war participants (nurses, soldiers, etc.). For some there is back and forth between the voice of the current/live voice of the participant and a voice over actor portraying their younger war-time years. I was engaged enough to watch the whole series, but it was more because I enjoyed seeing a deeper story to the war; various, less publicly portrayed battles; and the effect on lives at the personal level.

I watched one of the episodes with my child, telling him there was some graphic scenes and it was okay not to look. I watched to make sure he was okay with it.

The various stories of the eleven men and one woman were very compelling.  On several occasions watching these episodes I was moved to tears.  The stories of these people told how the war went from the patriotic duty to the personal experience of just getting out alive and hoping your buddies do too. Some of the lives examined were taken from the books and memoirs of those who went through hell.  Some of these are no longer living, but the interviews of those still alive revealed how their experiences shaped their lives.  The one gent who talked about cutting the throat of a German soldier trembled as he talked showed how that carried with him even today.  Even though this war was several generations ago, it has a message for us today.  Definitely worth watching.  It gives a greater appreciation for what our fathers/mother and grandfathers/grandmothers went through to do their part in fighting the tyrannies of German Nazism and Japanese Imperialism.",1406937600,,1114,4.795811518324608

3976909,5,B002RUNMMO,"Anyone who is at all interested in seeing specific details from WWII should watch this one.  It is an invaluable tool in really understanding what happened from 1940 to 1945.  There are grisly details which make some of it difficult, but it only helps to understand what it was like.  Having several veterans narrate what happened to them gives us an even better understanding.  Rate it a ""must see"" by any history buff.",1405987200,,420,4.712328767123288

3976915,3,B002RUNMMO,"These are truly intense tales from people who have experienced the horrors of war and its aftermath.
One thing I did not like is that the producers chose to replay the same images time and time again. When they do things like this it throws their credibility into question.",1405555200,,273,4.591836734693878

3976917,4,B002RUNMMO,"Wonderful documentary with never before seen footage of World War II. It's VERY graphic in nature, showing the true nature of war-blood, injuries, death, bombings, etc. I wouldn't recommend it for the little ones and/or adults who wouldn't be able to stomach the scenery because this documentary is no holds barred. The first person letters, testimony, and interviews paints a very gripping retelling of WWII; no fantasy narratives painted by Hollywood. This is brutal war-uncut and unfiltered. At times, it may appear to be moving slow but that is because the quality and the craftsmanship of how the narratives are weaved together.",1405382400,,633,5.215686274509804

3976958,4,B002RUNMMO,"Pretty good WWII footage and narration. As much as I've read, watched, and listened to about WWII there always seems to be something new to discover. This series was a wealth of facts.

My only complaint was how the episodes kept switching between the war in the Pacific and the war in Europe. I would have preferred they stuck to one for half the episode and the other for the remainder rather than every few minutes making a switch.",1404432000,,434,4.493670886075949

3976993,4,B002RUNMMO,GOOD WAR MOVIE OR DOCUMENTARY.  I AM NOT SURE WHAT HD MEANT-I DID NOT NOTICE MUCH IN HD.  WHAT I DID LIKE ABOUT THE DOCUMENTARY WAS THE ORDER AND MAP LOCATIONS IN THE MOVIE.  IT WAS EASY TO FOLLOW THE PACIFIC AND THE EUROPEAN FRONTS.,1403568000,,233,4.133333333333334
3976994,5,B002RUNMMO,"I have read many books and watched countless documentaries on WW2 and this is definitely one of the best.  I was particularly impressed with the detail regarding the Pacific theatre, which I feel is not very well done by others.

3977003,5,B002RUNMMO,"There is much that could be written about this series. I particularly appreciated that it put a face on the suffering and courage and loss and hope of one of the world's most devastating and tragic wars. Though graphic at times, the brutality of war was not hidden. War and death are not entertaining, but we and the generations who come after us cannot afford to forget. Documentaries like this help us remember and remind us that it was people just like us that lived through or died in that conflict.",1402617600,,503,4.538461538461538

3977023,4,B002RUNMMO,"I tried this when I was just surfing Prime for something to watch. I tried episode 6, I believe, about Iwo Jima. It was very, very interesting, and gave insight into what war was like. I hesitate to use the word 'enjoy' to describe watching this, for entertainment value, as the experiences shared by the narrators and in one case, the person who experienced it, clearly left mental scars. It made me very grateful for those who serve our country and made me really think about the price of freedom. I've never seen it first hand, but this gives a mind-opening account of war...it's not hollywood, and it's really ugly.

Overall, this was put together very well, and was very eye-opening. I feel like the experiences and footage shown was, although graphic in some parts, was appropriate to the experience as it did not attempt to glorify the violence. It was more from an attempt to say ""this is war..."".",1401667200,,905,4.65625
3977024,5,B002RUNMMO,"The WWII in HD series was incredible. First of all, the color images were amazing, giving you a perspective that is tough to capture with black and white. They followed the stories of ~10 different soldiers throughout the course of the war, which helps to see the war on a more personal level. Some of the personal stories were more dry and drawn out than others, but I really enjoyed most of them. I didn't think the images were overly graphic, but may be unsettling for some. The series really helped me to understand (as a 23 year-old) just how dire of a situation the U.S. and the rest of the world was in, and helped me to appreciate the sacrifices so many made for our country.",1401667200,,683,4.3858267716535435
3977025,5,B002RUNMMO,Awesome show. Great clear footage that is really powerful. Plus some great personal stories that pull at your heart strings.,1401494400,,124,5.25
3977026,5,B002RUNMMO,This series is very well done.  Narration is very good.  You get a true sense of what our servicemen and women had to endure during WWII and the sacrifices they made to ensure our freedom.  Very thought provoking!,1401235200,,213,4.552631578947368
3977027,4,B002RUNMMO,Great series for people who like following ww2 history. Some photography never seen before. Should highly recommend it to ww2 buffs!,1401235200,,132,5.333333333333333
3977028,5,B002RUNMMO,Definitely a guy movie series. I can't wait to see the next installment. The first episode reminded me of the high quality cinematography I've come to expect in a Spielberg film.,1401148800,,178,4.774193548387097
3977029,5,B002RUNMMO,"This series is an eye opener to those of us who have not been in harm's way in military service.  Truly an appropriate and needed viewing on Memorial Day, when we remember those gave their lives so that we could enjoy our lives and freedoms.",1400976000,,241,4.355555555555555
3977030,5,B002RUNMMO,The story follows the lives of a dozen people and the impact that the war had on their lives. It really personalizes the war. It contains footage that I have never seen before. The photography portrays the brutality of the war in vivid color. It is a totally amazing series and the best portrayal of the war that I have ever seen.,1400889600,,330,4.338709677419355
3977031,5,B002RUNMMO,One of my favorites on the topic. On a side note: it was interesting to see the list of celebrities that participated in this.,1400803200,,126,4.291666666666667
3977032,4,B002RUNMMO,"If you like these, this one is high quality and moves along at a decent pace.  Mostly all in color which also ads something in this day and age where many people instantly tune out when they see a black and white show.",1400716800,,218,4.069767441860465
3977033,5,B002RUNMMO,Learned a lot about WWII that they don't teach in school. Plus the footage from the time of the war is really awesome.,1400630400,,118,4.173913043478261

3977035,5,B002RUNMMO,"This is a must for WE II buffs. Frank Capra captures the spirit and feelings of soldiers, many very young and away from home for the first time. Much of the film is from archives of both allied and axis country's.",1399852800,,213,4.219512195121951

3977040,5,B002RUNMMO,"I have been a permanent substitute for two U.S. History classes and this series has been amazing in teaching them and myself about the realities of WW II.

I got to watch each movie three times, once for each class and another time with my husband.  All of us found it to be very well put together.  The addition of the twelve first-person stories made it incredibly personal.  We felt as if we knew them and were there with them in the present tense.

I highly recommend this History Channel series.",1399248000,,500,4.450549450549451

3977062,5,B002RUNMMO,"If you wish to get an experience of the hell that is war, this account through the eyes and lives of those who were in that hell will, in a way put you there.  It should probably be required viewing for all of us, lest we forget the sacrifices made for each of us.  It is also quite fitting that Gary Sinise narrates this presentation.  This is a documentary to see, both for its historical value and its emotional value.",1399161600,,421,4.2375
3977063,5,B002RUNMMO,This is the best war documentary that I have ever seen. Makes me feel like I have a better deeper understanding of what this war truly was for the people who fought it. I would definitely recommend this to people who are interested in military history or people trying to figure what world war 2 was about.,1398729600,,306,4.385964912280702
3977064,5,B002RUNMMO,One of the best!!! Everyone should see this and remember the sacrifice that was given of those who allowed us to live freely today.,1398729600,,131,4.5
3977065,5,B002RUNMMO,An excellent and poignant tale of several people's experiences before and after the war. The restored footage is incredible to witness  and also hard to stomach. Heroism and brutal realism in equal measure. Have your kids watch this (but be ready to discuss the nature of war and violence to make it a teaching moment if they are mature enough to handle it) and also appreciate our past and current vets.

3977067,4,B002RUNMMO,I liked the new information and the down on the ground footage.  More Americans should watch this to see how close we came to being under axis control.,1398297600,,151,4.392857142857143
3977068,5,B002RUNMMO,Great historical documentary on the WWII and the big influence had on the world and our country.  Great video and story telling.,1398211200,,128,4.818181818181818
3977069,4,B002RUNMMO,I found this documentary very interesting in the manner in which it followed the lives of multiple real-life characters who served in different theatres of WWII.  Excellent account of the war and the price paid by our military and the civilians unfortunate enough to find themselves in harm's way.,1398038400,,297,5.061224489795919
3977070,5,B002RUNMMO,"Amazing, graphic footage. Recommended for anyone who wants to know how the war was  will bring tears to your eyes",1397952000,,113,4.65

But had a tendency to repeat itself
Sometimes a little confusing switching back

3977072,5,B002RUNMMO,"I chose this because I needed to shock some of my students by what war really looks like (not what the video games make it look like!) and they loved it. I was only able to show 4 out of the 10 episodes, but even with the gaps in the story line my students really enjoyed it.",1397433600,,275,3.8421052631578947
3977073,5,B002RUNMMO,Excellent.  The only problem is the graphic pictures.  I have a strong stomach but I turned my head on some of the death shots.,1397347200,,127,4.25
3977074,5,B002RUNMMO,WWII is my favorite time in history. After a two year world wide search enough color film was located to make this program. What is amazing is color film was extremely rare and was just starting to come into the market. Finding most film in private procession and the time to build this into a first rate program is well worth the time to watch,1397260800,,344,4.3076923076923075
3977075,5,B002RUNMMO,This was the best series I have seen on WWII. The History Channel did a great job putting this together and getting the right people to produce it. It is very graphic but historically accurate.,1397088000,,193,4.542857142857143
3977076,3,B002RUNMMO,As I write this 319 reviews are logged so unlikely you'll see my review anyway. To me we have all heard the stories before and comprehensive history is readily available. This is a worth while show case of the color footage along with personal experiences and I'm glad I watched it....,1396915200,,285,4.607843137254902
3977077,5,B002RUNMMO,"I've seen scores of biographies and read a number of books about the great war, and still there is much more to learn.  This excellent documentary not only shows real scenes that i have never watched before, its also well researched.  And  bringing in the actual lives of the people involved in the conflict brings it home in a very moving and emotional way.",1396828800,,358,4.5625
3977078,5,B002RUNMMO,"This is spellbinding.  My dad installed the telephones on some of those Pacific raids, and he rarely spoke about what he did or what he saw.  I did not find out till shortly before he died in 2000 that he'd survived a Kamikaze raid.

The stories and footage show ghastly carnage, and the numbers are staggering... more soldiers and sailors and marines landed at Normandy that are in the entire US military today - and that was ONE LANDING.  The series begs for comparison with The War by Ken Burns.  It is vital to watch both.  The Burns series gives a bit better sequential ordering, while this series shows the film they found, which was concentrated in certain areas and probably lacking in others.  The more I learn about this period, the more I want to know, including the lead-up, the views of the other players [the British, the French, the Russians, the Italians, the Germans, the Japanese, and the minor players, ranging from the Pacific Islanders to the smaller nations of Eastern Europe.  I guess as a child, history was less compelling than it is now, as I inch closer to my seventies.

3977091,4,B002RUNMMO,"Very good series, a little heavy on characters made it kinda hard to keep up with what each person's experience had been with continuity.  Would have been better if they had laid each person's story out in individual episodes.  The stories were absolutely great it's so sad this generation is almost gone.

3977093,4,B002RUNMMO,"While World War II was arguably the most significant event of the 20th Century, most photographic documentation is in low quality black and white.  This stands out by its color cinematography.  It's story is told by living witnesses, who recollect their experiences many years later, depicted as old men.  Their might be more effective ways to present the story, but all in all, I found this satisfactory.

This should be of interest to all World War II buffs.",1395878400,,460,4.858974358974359

It is interesting to gain underdstanding of these wars from the eyes of those who fought them. You can feel the emotion of these men and women describing real events in their young lives, and know that their experience will never be far from memory.

3977143,5,B002RUNMMO,"I don't know how many films were done by other nations as they were at war with the U.S. but it would have been interesting to see more film footage from the axis powers, British, and maybe even the Australian POV.

One thing the film does show is often operations were botched by weather, logistics, poor planning, and dumb luck by the American armed forces.  It is a tue testament to the American G.I.s that overcame these adversities in spite of it all. After all, the real plan of the upper command in the U.S. Forces was to put men on the ground and have them do the work.  It amazed me to see an operation get put into motion, have that plan go sideways, and still the G.I.s sacrificed everything to accomplish the task. It brought home the idea that it was privates, corporals and sargents that truely won this war.

There was a sacrifice made by those that died... And maybe even a tougher one made by those that lived.  Watch carefully and listen NOT to the voice overs, but the actual men and you can hear it and see it in the wight they carry to this day.  A salute is not enough.

Watch this film yearly. Pay your respects to those that made you what you are today.",1392422400,,1177,4.274774774774775

Narration was provided by actor Gary Sinise, and each of the veterans extent at the time of filming, had onscreen time to tell their stories.  They were all voiced at times by different actors who read for them as well.  I really enjoyed watching and, of course, learned something new In the process.  ""WWII In HD""  is very much like Ken Burns' film ""The War"", which I also enjoyed watching.

They explain the history using personal stories from actual soldiers.  You connect more with history this way I think. Anyway I can't say enough. Amazing.,1389398400,,289,4.627450980392157
3977198,5,B002RUNMMO,This was a great history of world war two.  Lots of scenes I have never seen.  Any history or war buff will truly enjoy and appreciate this series.,1389398400,,147,4.214285714285714
3977199,5,B002RUNMMO,Portraying the event of the Great War was excellent.  The editing of complex scenes was near perfect.  Gary Senise narration was exacting and not over done.,1389398400,,156,4.961538461538462

3977205,4,B002RUNMMO,"The coverage was quite choppy, going from one character to another. Because the source film was mostly low quality (by today's standards) calling it ""in HD"" is a little misleading. The high rating is due to the importance of the material and that it gave us some idea of what they went though to win total victory. Victory is the only worth reason for war.",1388880000,,356,4.492307692307692

3977208,5,B002RUNMMO,One of the best documentaries on WWII I've ever seen.  They did a great job weaving in original footage and interviews with veterans with actors and reenacted battles.  Great job!  Interesting...and informative!,1388707200,,211,5.53125
3977209,5,B002RUNMMO,Really liked this. Well done production. Never saw it when it was on national TV. Love ROKU for providing the means to catch up to the good shows without commercials.,1388707200,,166,4.566666666666666

3977212,4,B002RUNMMO,"You will see footage in this documentary that you are not likely see anywhere else.  Parts of it are quite graphic and could be somewhat disturbing, if you are not already familiar with WW 2 events.  The interviews with the surviving participants is excellent.  The producers have done a great job of archiving rare footage and tying it in with the lives of those who made it through the battles. Not all of them have recovered, even 60 years later.  While the makers of the film tried to show how what happened in different parts of the world concurrently, it may be somewhat confusing to those who are not already well-schooled in the timeline history of WW 2.  While the narrative is OK, some points seemed to have been left hanging.  If you are a well informed WW2 history buff, you may be frustrated that some ""dots weren't connected"".  For the casual viewer, I think this series provides a unique picture of the conflict you won't likely see elsewhere.",1388102400,,958,4.633136094674557

3977217,3,B002RUNMMO,Informative but not enthralling. Jumping around to different points of view is an interesting narrative device. There is less overarching information and more personal narrative than I'd expected. I don't think this series is a good introduction to WWII for students; I think it's better for someone who already understands the framework of the war. Still looking for an interesting & informative student's series.,1386201600,,414,5.484375
3977218,5,B002RUNMMO,Absolutely the very best documentary covering the entire scope of World War II. Dramatic real filming of the major battles in Europe and the Pacific. Many film clips that I had never seen before and I am a WWII historian. Interspersed with actual accounts from veterans that were actually there. Gives accounts from the war correspondents that shot the film. This is the best I have seen. I highly recommend this documentary for those who want to see what war is really like!,1386201600,,475,4.734939759036145
3977219,5,B002RUNMMO,"This may well be the single best documentary I have ever seen, with the possible exception of one in IMAX I saw once. The writing, flow of information and the way the stories are personalized by following 12 people through the course of the war all make this a compelling and engaging series. Add in the color, never before seen in public footage and it is breathtaking. I mean that literally. I found myself more than one having to remind myself to blink and to breathe. World War II came alive for me in a way that made me appreciate the sacrifices and courage of my grandfather and great uncles with pride and awe.
If you were part of that ""Greatest Generation"" you can watch this with pride. If you are, like me, a boomer, then watch it with reverence and gratitude. Either way, watch it.",1386201600,,792,4.431506849315069
3977220,4,B002RUNMMO,This series has a lot of history that had been neglected or at least underrepresented in earlier documentaries concerning World War 2.  As a tradeoff you sometimes loose focus on the bigger picture.,1385078400,,198,5.0
3977231,5,B002RUNMMO,Amazingly well done!  I've learned a lot about the war that I didn't know about and I am a history buff especially regarding WW2.,1384646400,,129,4.375

3977233,3,B002RUNMMO,"This series of films doesn't really work on two levels.  First, this is High Definition reconstruction of grainy WWII footage.  That means that the poor quality of the original film is even more apparent on your screen.  Truly the title of the project is  a ""gimmick"" to get you to purchase the product.  They probably would have put 4G on the box too if they thought to broadcast to your phone.

Secondly, the producers got name recognizable ""talent"" to do the voice overs of the soldiers whose stories are being told.  This was distracting and diminished the story.  One minute we are watching and listening to one veteran telling his story and then an actors voice overdubs what he is saying and continues the story.  This method of editing made me suspicious that the story changed once the actor took over the narration.

Overall, there was no new information given during the shows, nor was the program dramatic.  Missed the boat on both counts.  You will more likely enjoy WWII in Color, World at War, or if you like to know what was going on in the home front, Ken Burns; version of The War.",1383091200,,1099,4.579487179487179

3977237,5,B002RUNMMO,"This is one of the most accurate portrays of WW2 that I personally have seen.  The films are all real, no acting, and narrated by Gary Siniise.  I sometimes wondered about the accuracy and reality of films like ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers"" to name my favorites as comparison.  WWII in HD makes these other films more appreciated for their pain- staking accuracy.  I would recommend this mini series to anyone who wants to understand the importance and horror of the Great War!",1381449600,,492,4.752941176470588
3977238,5,B002RUNMMO,Great price and fast delivery.  This documentary is very well done and draws you into the stories in a balanced way.  They spend just enough time on the individuals who you are seeing the war through without taking away from the battle footage.,1381276800,,244,4.651162790697675

3977251,3,B002RUNMMO,"Vivid footage and exceptional narration. The interviews offer personal stories that add true dimension. Technically?
1)  Color has been added to what was originally black and white footage.
2) The shift of focus from the European to Pacific Theaters does not allow for smooth transition.

As key points and battles are described a better understanding of the why various topics became large issues to that generation that were not well described in general media or discussed by that generation if ever.  Perhaps they don't teach history in middle school, high school, or college anymore.  But watching this series really helps puts things into some perspective.  It is a shame that they waited so long to do this series as most of the key WWII leaders military and civilian had passed on as well as those who may have had an unusually greater perspective of what was happening as it was happening due to their roles such as the famous news reporters of that era.  After watching it and going to the memorials in Washington and Pearl Harbor it is brought home of who these people were and unlike successive wars the scale of this war really engulfed the world of everyone in those days.",1379116800,,1014,4.636871508379889

This is NOT one of those crappy History Channel documentaries; it is one of the better WWII documentaries...and it just happens to be produced by the History Channel...it's one of the documentaries they got right.

It does have 2.5 minutes of introduction/repeated footage at the start of each episode, but that is a byproduct of being a made-for-TV series.  Each episode is about 45 minutes long...the time goes by surprisingly fast.

3977261,5,B002RUNMMO,"I am a big WW2 history buff. I love the whole scenario, strategy, etc. This documentary really moved me! Gary Senise as the narrator did a great job. The shows are a series of the whole war. The story unfolds through the eyes of 12 people. It contains photo footage that has rarely or never been seen on a normal tv documentary. However, I must say that this series does not cover a lot specific details of battles or other scenarios that happened during WW2. It is mainly a very general documentary through the eyes of 12 people. So if you are looking for something more specific you will need to look at other documentaries, and some of those will probably be in black and white. This series is in color and is in HD. Plainly and simply said, if you are a patriot for the allies, or more specifically for U.S.A, then you must buy this. I was thoroughly ""moved"" by it.",1378512000,,869,4.337423312883436

3977268,4,B002RUNMMO,"Since my Father talked very little about the war I`ve always tried to figure out what made Germany such a terror of Europe.  Especially since I`m one fourth German. These programs help but somehow leave many things out showing only bombs exploding and dead bodies lying about.  Enough of that.  My Father, a wounded decorated vet of the Normandy invasion always spoke of how different the people of Europe were, he loved the English and their politeness.  He loved the German people, even the average German soldier who he felt did not want war any more than he did.  But it was the pictures of French ladies throwing flowers to American troops and Frenchmen smiling that caused his anger to come out.  His dislike for anything French bordered on pure hate.  Cowards and whores was his description of the French and it is this that I wish I could understand, because every European Vet I know or knew feels this way and I wish this type of program would help me understand.  Show what the American Soldier faced in Europe besides the German Military.

I found my kids were able to engage better with the color footage...as it made the material more ""real"" than the B&W footage I've tried to show them before.  The story-based approach is engaging and futher makes it real. Production and pacing are well executed.  My only criticism was the choice to avoid covering the eastern front.  While the coverage of Western Europe, North Africa and the Pacific was good, there was hardly any reference let alone footage or story telling about the eastern front.

Between black and white and all the cheesy movies made one starts to lose the fact that it was real men and women who went out and got the job done.
This work has for the first time in my life made this war real to me. For the first time I was able to see what it was and not just cause it was in color, colorized WWII films have been around for a long time, not this was the painstaking effort to bring the most detail and accuracy of the war to life.

For the first time it no longer feels like a myth. For the first time one can see and appreciate the hell that this war was.

However this series is entertaining to watch.  It reminded me of a video game called Call of Duty World at War actually stringing together a narrative, fast paced, and oozes testosterone with music and grade A movie like editing that captures a little slice of the intensity and ferocity of the war.

3977331,5,B002RUNMMO,"There are many DVDs and blu-rays of WW2 available. The World at War by the BBC is excellent, but it presents a British perspective, concentrating on the European war, and costs about $75. I rate The War by Ken Burns highly. It costs about $35 in blu-ray. WWII in HD has 7 1/2 hours of simultaneous coverage of both theaters with excellent commentary by 12 participants in the war. It sells for about $20.
I recommend the Third Reich (The Rise and The Fall) on DVD by the History channel to supplement this blu-ray. It runs three hours on two DVDs for about $10.
I have just one final comment on the war in Europe: if Hitler had carefully studied Napoleon Bonaparte's Russian campaign he would have had a chance to beat Stalin. His army was beaten by the harsh Russian winter as was Hitler's.",1358726400,,791,4.462068965517242

It's only drawback is that all the veterans are from the United States.  Amazing in thier own right, as an avid fan of WWII history, I would love to see one day a similar series with UK, USSR, German, Italian, French, Japanese, etc... accounts too.  Back to this series though... it is GREAT!  These accounts are personal, dotted with pictures, letters, correspondance and many movies.  Actors voice over for the veterans and all do an admirable job, while the actual veterans are interviewed quite a bit as well.  Fascinating sweeping stories cover all of the war, all theatres.  Not good for the massive big picture view of the war, but EXCELLENT for the nitty-gritty up close and personal experiences.  Anyone interested in history, espcially WWII era, should not miss this.  Where as many documentaries that cover the bigger picture, will over time, end up giving you the same information... these up close stories give you a fresh perspective on an era long passed.

3977352,4,B002RUNMMO,"First thing: don't watch this if you have a weak stomach. Some of it is very graphic.

A bit of the footage is stuff I'd never seen, and I've probably seen nearly every documentary made about WWII in my 64 years. But a lot of it is stuff that any WWII buff has seen before just in the original color.

The History Channel did a pretty good job of putting this together as a story, although I'm not quite sure why they decided to pick two war correspondents as characters, instead of researching another pair of real GI's. I think the whole thing might have been better served by finding a young Naval petty officer. They also sort of spoiled the last two episodes by leaking their ABC/leftie/apologist leanings in when they talked about the end of the war. We don't owe anyone an apology for dropping the A-bomb on Japan in August 1945. And that's from someone who has toured the Peace Park and Museum in Hiroshima, Japan. The simple fact remains that if we hadn't used the Bomb, it would have cost a million American lives, and countless Japanese lives--and the outcome would have been the same--Japan would lose in the end.

So was it the definitive WWII? Nope. Was it worth the money? Yep.",1352851200,,1192,4.483870967741935

The original ""World War II - The Lost Color Archives"" (circa. 2000), which covered a bigger scope of this tragic war by witnesses chronicles from various walk of life around the globe, not just by the old glorious veterans, gave me a far more lasting impression of the recorded events.

I think It's time for A&E to come up with a new way of programming for such genre, rather than using a recycled, decade old schema.",1337472000,,669,4.850877192982456

But I feel that this is such an important part of our history and world history that we should all remember it.  I think it would be good for anyone to see once, especially someone who might not believe just how horrible that war was.

I believe that we honor our veteran's the best when we refuse to forget the sacrifices they made.

3977360,5,B002RUNMMO,"I saw some previews of this series on Youtube and decided to buy it.  I'm very glad I did.  While perhaps not as comprehensive as I might have liked, it provided a somewhat more intimate overview using the now familiar tactic of following the lives of several participants.  Without wanting to spoil anything, I will say you occasionally felt a small sense of shock when a person you were following and getting to know via their letters and diaries suddenly and without warning, died.

Having the old veterans talk about their experiences is invaluable too.  There was no question that they still felt what occurred 60+ years later.  I do wish the images and film clips were a better quality, but after a short time I forgot that this was supposed to be HD, at least HD as I've become accustomed.

When I see old WWII newsreels, the black and white pictures make it seem so distant, something in the past, almost unreal.  This documentary using all color film, makes all the difference in the world.  The color makes the events seem more real, more eerie when you see such monsters as Hitler or Tojo.  For that reason alone, the documentary hit home with a very resonating thud for me, and made this excellent documentetary that much more meaningful to me.

3977374,5,B002RUNMMO,"Plenty of other reviews have covered the details of production and narration - the linking of the full arc of the war's history with these individual soldier, sailor, and nurse perspectives is tremendous. I'll just add the following reactions:

- It's a very American-centric POV. Nothing wrong with that, as that perspective is fully intentional and powerfully edited, but you're not going to get a sense of the scale of the Eastern Front, the intricacies of the broader South Pacific campaigns, and certain dramatic German naval campaigns (the Graff Spee and the Bismarck come to mind).

- The HD transfer of old footage is excellent. They did the absolute best work they could with this 65+ year-old material, and it's unlike any other presentation I've seen.

- If you've watched a ton of WWII documentaries, you won't see much overlap here in the archival stuff. It feels like a completely new treatment.

- Voiceover actors like Gary Sinise and Rob Lowe bring appropriate tension, drama (and a little bit of humor) to the reading of letters home, recollections of the fight, and even the everyday tedium and trivia of military life.",1325462400,,1138,4.942408376963351

The visuals are impressive.  The scenes are breathtaking and emotional.  But why did they decide to not include closed captioning?  This just seems wrong that they would leave out those of us who cannot hear.  The series is 5 stars hands down but the blu-ray release is lacking almost any special features or bonus content.

It is totally ""chopping up"" of real footage from the war and using ""hollywood movie"" style music and sound effects  in background. Much of the time you will be watching one of 3 or 4 different people sitting in their living room or standing with sunglasses on while ""remembering"" their own PERSONAL stories.

3977382,5,B002RUNMMO,"This is a fabulous series! The videos are wonderful, I don't think I had ever seen WWII in color before, much less HD! The producers chose to tell the story of the war through the eyes of four soldiers/sailors/pilots, and found footage to match their stories.

This is a wonderful story, but also tells the absurdity of the way the military does things. For example, they tell the story of an Austrian Jew who fled his country in the late 1930s and came to the US. When the war began he realized he needed to serve his new country and enlisted. The Army now had a man who could speak fluent German with a local accent, was familiar with the area, could blend in with the local populace, etc. So what did they do with him? They put him in the infantry and sent him to the Aleutians to fight the Japanese.

Absurd stories like that make the videos seem more real, they focus on more than just killing the enemy.

Right at the very beginning you start to hear a Jewish German survivor explain his past and his view of war but then the producers start to dub over him with an annoying actors voice! Why? The guy who actually lived through it was fascinating - do the producers think the celebrities give more credence to the stories or did they just want to mix with LL Cool J?

Unless I missed something D Day was barley mentioned, and covered for less than 2 mins out of a whole 10 hour series??  And that was just to show bombers comming in ahead of the troops.  That was it then they covered the hedge rows for a bit?!?!?!!!

Battle of the bulge was given a little more coverage but not nearly enough.

Where they did spend the most time was in the Japanese campaings, which they followed in depth island by island.

The battle at the Philippines was much harder and not to mention as nearly bloody as the battles of Iwo-Jima and Okinawa. The battles at North Africa at first caused the U.S. soldiers to feel inferior at first next to the British forces, that were battling the Germans since the beginning of the war, the British Islands were the last free democracy in Europe (Someone had to stood up to the Nazis - The U.S. were financially helping out the British nation prior to Pearl Harbor but only after the incident on 12/7/1941 the U.S. actively entered the war)...

Graphic, yes, real, yes! IT WAS WAR!
Given the broad war that was waged against both of the enemies, Japan and Germany, we really were guided by the hand of God and some pretty great leaders.
Amazing process of telling the entire war story, but it gets a little difficult to keep up with the story of individuals by jumping back and forth.  But once you get used to it, its not bad.  My wife and I grew up hearing about WWII (we were born in 1944), our parents were involved in various parts and then it was Korea.
All of the color footage was amazing.  We both were ready for the next part as soon as possible.  Took us 5 days to watch the whole thing.
When you serve as a Marine, you learn a lot of Military History of when and where the Marines served...this really was a review of all I learned.

3977434,4,B002RUNMMO,"As a student of history and especially World War II history: this set of programs will educate those knowing the least to those knowing the most.

The cost is such that it is a good value. It would also make a great gift for most.

The stories told by the actors adds a nice element to the overall presentation as well.

What detracts from this program is the editing of the program. It is simply too fast-paced for people of ""all"" ages.

I can see the younger generations more accepting of the production values and fancy graphics and all that jazz, so-to-speak. However, for say, the older person including those still left who actually fought in that conflict; it would be extremely difficult to remain focused all the time on the real story presented on these DVDs. This, despite the fact that some veterans of World War II are actually featured in this set of programs: I find it hard to imagine that they would be completely impressed with this program's production values.

The History Channel is leaning more towards this style of editing. Perhaps because the younger generation of film students that have now entered the workforce. I do not believe that gives license to exploit these techniques on the rest of the population in general.

A constant barrage of mostly 3 second film clips is simply too fast paced for too long a time for many to try to ""learn"" from these programs as well as being entertained by them.

This sadly, is where many in TV production are now falling short: by blurring the standards between education and entertainment; rather than enhancing them.

As others have stated, what remains as the definitive program is the 1974 epic, ""The World At War"". Buy ""WWII in HD"" for youngsters, borrow it from the library for the more mature.",1297296000,25,1766,4.692556634304207

3977437,3,B002RUNMMO,"If you are new to WWII studies or have limited knowledge, this series will keep and hold your attention featuring mostly original color footage, which thanks to the reprocessing looks often times amazing.  However, if like me, you expected the actual footage to be the star - as reflected in the title - then you will be disappointed.  Instead of stories behind the combat footage or even longer shots of the footage, this attempts to tell a real ""dramatic"" story. Thus, you have quick cuts, a story line that jumps around, and extensive (but well done) overdubbing of the (originally nonexistent) audio.  The footage is only related to the real events in certain locations, so that I was wondering if what I was viewing was really footage from the alleged location.  (This sense is increased by obvious errors and repitions of the same footage.)

Though I appreciated the Hollywood talent on the voiceovers, I would have rather had Gary Sinese tell me the real story behind the video rather than try to recreate Saving Private Ryan as a documentary.  I was expecting something more like the 1999 or 2000 Tom Hanks narrated ""Photographers of WWII"" (title?), but that would probably bore most viewers.  So I appreciated the high production values that went into this and I'm sure it will hold many viewers' attention, but I found myself again and again simply hitting the pause button to study and watch (because many cuts don't last longer than 3 seconds - MTV style).  As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words, but here they had pictures running in color but instead chose to mash them into something they weren't.",1297123200,16,1623,4.792114695340501

3977439,3,B002RUNMMO,"First of all, the narration is great and the footage is also very good. I'm not sure how authentic the sound is and some of the footage is repeated several times. There is no getting around the sound issues, some seems real and sync'd but lots (most?) is in crisp stereo sound and can't possibly be authentic. There are many scenes of far-away destruction with sound straight out of a theater. I don't believe it's possible that what is heard in the series is authentic most of the time which is brings me to my main complaint. Many clips are used over and over in different episodes. There are several scenes with the same wounded solders and one with a nurse mixing a brown fluid that are show many times. The series goes in chronological order so it's non-nonsensical to show the same scene more than once.

I would probably have a different rating if I watched each episode with some time in between because I may not have picked up on the re-use but the sound would bother be regardless of when I watched. The footage is spectacular but I think they really took something away by the way it was presented. Worth a watch / purchase but not totally authentic in my opinion.",1293926400,4,1176,4.469767441860465

I thought the idea of following the service people through the various campaigns was well done.

Downsides:

1. This is very America centric, with few mentions of Brits or French. Russia only in context of America providing supplies, or meeting at end of war.
2. Large aspects of the war were missing: Burma/S.E. Asia, much of Sahara/African war before 1942, entire Russian conflict.

I recommend its purchase for the new materials - just don't expect ""The World at War"". It is more like a Ken Burns type treatment, following some folks through their experiences.",1293667200,3,711,4.611111111111111

But the footage did not match up with the stories! A character may be talking about seeing dead soldiers and they show pictures of dead soldiers but, really, they are just generic dead soldier pictures. They aren't what the story-teller actually saw. WTF kind of history is this? Well, it is The History Channel, isn't it? Where ""close is good enough."" Aircraft markings are wrong, division patches are wrong. Better to have skipped the stories orr done them with whatever real photos were available, and simply did another series to show the new footage with narration and no stories. Worse, there is no ""Big Picture"" to tell us how these stories fit into the whole war (many important events are not even mentioned because the personal stories did not intersect them). Folks who compare this favorable with ""The World at War"" really are deluded. Ken Burns' ""The War"" took the same approach and made it work beautifully. This is, well, the History Channel, which revels in ""recreations"" of events ands junks up everything it touches.

3977456,5,B002RUNMMO,"I'm not normally an avid watcher of WW II documentaries, and thought as many others did that the final and definitive word has been spoken on the subject, in the BBC World at War series&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-World-at-War-Blu-ray/dp/B003X3BYEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The World at War [Blu-ray</a>].  However, this series adds a new scope and dimension to remembering the Second World War.  The combination of the approach to the material, and the material itself, has produced something incredibly memorable, sobering, informative, and essential viewing.  The material is colour footage, mostly unseen until now, found, as the series prologue says, over a two year search.  This has been photographed with High definition, to preserve the material.  So what you are saying is high definition  version of material of various quality - 8mm, 16mm, often blemished with the ravages of time.  Seeing this material, which mostly reflects the Pacific campaign, though North Africa and Europe are well represented, is extraordinary.  The distance emotionally and time-wise from the events that you have when seeing them in black and white, is not so easy when presented with the stark reality in colour.  It makes the moments more vivid, and more human.. which brings us to how they have handled this material.  Rather than try and tell the story of the war from a broad overview of tactics etc - we see the events through 12 different peoples first hand perspective.  This is war, as seen through the eyes of individuals, not the historians's traditional dispassionate approach.  If there is a down side, it is that this is a very America-centric view of the war, starting from Pearl Harbour and concluding with VJ Day.  But that is a reflection of the materials available, and is not an indictment of the filmmakers.
Combined with a sober and well scripted commentary read by Gary Sinise, and voiced by contemporary actors, interspersed with interviews with those still alive, makes this something quite unique, a moving and educational experience.  Recommended.",1289606400,4,2116,5.450920245398773

3977460,1,B002RUNMMO,"In the motion picture and television industry, ""HD"" refers to when a digital ""high definition"" transfer is made off of the original film.  So I bought this expecting for once to see clear sharp images of WWII.  However, most of the digital transfers in this program were made off of second and third generation footage, so the ""HD"" is meaningless hype.  Further, absolutely no attempt was made to diminish scratches and dirt on the film. That technology is readily available, and expected from a genuine HD production. Sure, the film is old, but when an HD transfer is made off of the old original film, as was done in their promo, it looks clear and sharp. If you are strictly interested in the historical aspect of WWII this series is okay...no Ken Burns, but okay.  But my motivation was to see clear images in real HD, as advertised, and from that point of view this is bait and switch.",1286841600,12,890,4.578616352201258
3977471,4,B002RUNMMO,"This is without a doubt a great series. But given it deals with historical color film is it really High Definition and worth having on BluRay?

Well, the titles, photographs and the modern day interviews and some scene locations are definitely HD. But, the historical film certainly isn't HD or even SD and unfortunately these soft looking and often amateur clips have not been digitally restored to what they could be. This is somewhat disappointing as most are in their raw 8mm and 16mm state with scratches, dirt, hair, blotches etc etc. There was probably a look-see whether digital restoration was possible by the History Channel but was possibly thought to be too time-consuming and expensive.

Nevertheless, the answer is not to show this series on a home theatre HD projection screen but on a much smaller HDTV flat screen.

3977473,5,B002RUNMMO,"My team showed about 45 minutes of this video to about 150 students in a kick-off event to study World war II.  The kids never lost attention because this video has so much information, in a color film format, paced so well.  They picked up so much in just one showing, and it really gave them wonderful background to peak their interest and to which they have connected  information.  This was a really great purchase for teaching.
There was one section with a veteran who used a swear word or two, but we just lowered the volume momentarily.  There was a execution in Austria, I believe, of about 30 innocent townsmen by the Nazis when we opted to cover the lens.
A feature for our purposes was that real veterans were recounting their experiences in WWII.  Actor voices often took over for the vets, I believe to improve the quality and strength of the voices against war footage.  It was transitioned quite seemlessly.",1282953600,,922,4.619631901840491
3977474,5,B002RUNMMO,"There's not much I can add to the numerous comments, both positive and negative about the series.  The important thing is the producers realized that what color footage existed of World War II needed to be located soon and archived in high definition media for future generations to see what one of history's tragedies looked like as close to true life as possible, before it too, became lost to eternity, along with the experiences (and lives) of some of the veterans who fought in this war.  The wonderful thing about this series is we now have the recollections of an additional dozen veterans (about half of them still alive) along with those who contributed to earlier WWII television series, such as the British ""The World at War"" and the PBS Network/Ken Burns' ""The War"".

I think that this series could probably have benefited from a better name than the one given it.  Simply calling it ""WWII in HD"" doesn't give the series the full scope of the justice it received.  Probably something like ""WWII as Experienced by Those Who Fought in It"" would be better, but that still doesn't quite hit the nail on the head.  This series probably goes the furthest of any to document poignantly and as realistically as possible, the experiences of those who were in combat first hand.  It dwells on the horrors of war, and doesn't have a political or sociological axe to grind as Ken Burns did in his series.  The concluding few minutes of the last episode of the series makes this clear; that WWII was a tragedy for the entire human race, regardless of one's ethnicity or nationality.  The concluding comments about WWII in general as made by Tuskegee airman Shelby Westbrook could not have been better put.

This series presupposes some prior knowledge of WWII, and for those who know little about WWII, ""WWII in HD"" is not the best place to start.  The best place to start is probably the British series, ""The World at War"", providing a good video overview, and is universally recognized as the reference in the visual medium.  Other than that, there are innumerable books and multi-volume encyclopedic series on WWII, too numerous to mention here.

These verterans and their stories, the voice-over actors, Gary Sinise, and the folks at the History Channel have presented a great gift to us that should be seen by people of all ages.

3977487,2,B002RUNMMO,"I got this on sale, and I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it. The quality is sometimes good, but more often it's no better, and sometimes worse than a regular, standard definition DVD about WW II. When I dipped into the 2, very brief extras, it quickly became evident why the quality was so low. While the producers scoured the planet for footage, what they did was simply project the prints through a regular projector and then film that image with a RED digital camera. Now, while the RED camera has extraordinary capabilities, it can only shoot what's put in front of it. In this case, what that means is that the quality of the image is dependent on the quality of the mechanical projectors through which the image came. If we're talking about old, old 8mm film blown through a Bell & Howell projector, you are not going to get quality. It's a great pity that, having come up with all this unique footage, the producers couldn't find the money to do the job properly, and SCAN the image into a computer, frame by frame, at 4K resolution. They even manage to show us some footage (the civilian suicides on Okinawa) which I have seen in PBS documentaries looking much sharper, and properly coloured. In this set of shows, that footage is not only scratchy and blurred, it's also totally purple, because no colour correction was applied to the image.

Bottom line: it's not HD. It's an HD picture of a very low tech image, with very little done in the way of cleanup or rebalancing of the colours. Some of the footage is also colourized black and white, and not original colour, so that's another claim (it's on the box) that isn't quite true. Some of the footage is unique, and worth seeing. But the Pacific war in particular was shot in colour from the word go, and in 35mm, if we judge by the images they show us of combat cameramen. Those films are still, so far as I know, in the national archives, and if they are archivally scanned they will yield significant detail, and much much more than we see in this set of shows.

If you can get it at less than $20, the intrinsic interest of some of the footage is worth it. Otherwise, give it a miss.",1276905600,8,2154,4.423173803526448

3977489,4,B002RUNMMO,"I have just starting watching the BluRay version of this, as watching something titled HD and not seeing it IN HD seems pointless.  While there are many amazing shots, the HD title should be taken with a pinch of salt.  While I wasn't expecting perfect HD colour footage from WWII, most of the footage on these discs looks no better than anything else I've seen in colour on a regular DVD.  I would have preferred one or two episodes of just the best footage, re-digitized and cleaned up for HD, than plenty of filler.  That said the production is generally first rate.

Now for my biggest problem!  The opening screen starts with the words ""4 Years"", Now if the disc was titled ""The USA in WWII in HD"" then that would be right, but to start a show with such a misguided statement is just wrong.  And while is wasn't 'officially' involved, plenty of US citizens fought and died in the 'other' 2 years that WWII lasted.  So in case anyone forgets, World War 2 lasted SIX years.",1276473600,3,976,4.443820224719101
3977490,3,B002RUNMMO,"Up until recently, I was amazingly ignorant of the actual sequence of events--and names of those events--pertaining to WW2.  That began to change while I was at Borders and noticed the book called ""The War,"" based on the Ken Burns PBS series of the same name, sitting on the clearance rack for $10.  I read through that 400+ page book voraciously and absorbed myself into it to such an extent that I had nightmares about the things I read.  Anyway, I figured that there must be some wonderful WW2 documentaries available, so I ordered WW2 in HD, in part because of how well it's been received here on Amazon.

To this point I have not watched the complete series, but I've seen enough to make some general observations that I believe detract from the production.

1) Although the product is sold as WWII in HD, I see nothing HD about it.  I have a 42"" Panasonic plasma and both an HD-DVD and Blu-Ray player.  The opening menu looks fantastic, so you can imagine my disappointment that, when the actual program itself starts, it fills only about two-thirds of my television screen.  There are black bars on the top and bottom and both sides of the picture.  Fortunately my equipment does a good job of zooming in, but I was shocked that the picture doesn't fill the screen.  Even most of my old (late 90s) DVDs fill the screen completely, so I don't see how this DVD, which is new and advertised as HD, doesn't.  Maybe I should have bought the blu-ray version...

2)  The footage is of a good quality, and it is fascinating.  However, there's a lot of filler--just random shots to pass the time while the narration carries on.  It all feels very disjointed.  Rarely do I feel like I get a sense of what any given moment must have been like because there are so many cuts and filler shots.  And sometimes it feels like those filler shots aren't of what's actually being described but instead of something that might look or seem like it.  Perhaps that's due to the limitation of the footage that we have, perhaps not.  Either way, the narrative suffers from a lack of cohesion.

3) For me, the best part about ""The War"" was the extensive quotations from actual veterans.  Those peoples' words are priceless, and I was hoping to see more interviews with veterans in this series.  Instead, we get actors who do the voice overs.  We'll get a 10 second shot of the actual vet talking, which to me is the best part, but then the vet's image and voice fades away into the battle footage and the actor's voice.

I had high expectations for this series, and ""disappointed"" is the best word I can use to describe my reaction to it.  That said, the stories are excellent, some of the footage is amazing, and I believe that it's important for people to be exposed to the reality, however gruesome it might be, of what happened.  I wish we could just see and hear the actual people a bit more.",1275091200,6,2879,4.4884615384615385
3977501,5,B002RUNMMO,"Anything that depicts events pertaining to War History gets my attention in a hurry. This collection of DVD's fulfills that easily. At first I figured or expected it to be a collection of short videos I had seen many times over on the Discovery, History or some other television station, but it was not. There seemed to be an endless array of documentary I had never seen before. This ensured my complete interests to the end. The Color was unique, as it was actual color footage and not some B&W that had been enhanced with color.
I fully recommend this Color series to anyone that is a WWII buff like I am. You will not be disappointed at all. Money well spent. I rate it 5-Stars!!",1274918400,,683,4.428571428571429

3977503,2,B002RUNMMO,"This is not a series about WW2 - it is misnamed. It is a very interesting account of 7 Americans but does not cover the war in its entirety. There is virtually no coverage of the war before Pearl Harbor and the Eastern Front (the largest war in history) is ignored. Practically no coverage of the air or Atlantic campaigns. If you want to see the whole war you have to go with ""The World at War."" Very disappointing as a history of WW2.",1274745600,15,436,4.2023809523809526
3977504,5,B002RUNMMO,"I bought this production because I wanted to have some authentic, color footage of WWII to add to my WWII video library.  I had seen some of the History Channel's series The Color of War so I knew that there was at least one production out there that contained original color footage of WWII.  However, I couldn't find The Color of War and didn't know anything about some of the other productions like WWII: The Lost Color Archives or WWII in Color.  I read some reviews about WWII in HD, weighed the cost versus the running time as compared to some of the others, and decided to give it a shot on Blu-Ray.  I am 2/3 of the way through it but feel confident that I can give a helpful review at this point.

I have been very surprised and greatly satisfied with the quality of this production.  While I like my Century of Warfare collection it can be terribly dull and does little to shed light on the experience of war at a personal, individual level.  This production does a very nice job of making the war personal by following the stories of twelve individuals with very different perspectives, from reporters to nurses to infantry men to sailors to airmen.  It's nice to see interviews with the real individuals whose personal stories provide the context for the larger actions depicted in the color footage.  The trade off to this, of course, is that you are inevitably forced to leave out some events--even some significant ones--that were not directly experienced by any of your chosen subjects.  Further shrinking the potential scope in a production like this is the limitation of available footage.  There are some events, most notably the D-Day landings in Normandy, for which very little footage exists.  Consequently, this is just something that you are going to have to anticipate and accept with a production like this.

That being said, I have been thoroughly impressed and surprised by the scope that was achieved by this production, and by the amount of new, never-before seen footage.  Some events are covered that I have never before seen covered in any other production.  Examples of this include in-depth segments covering the fighting on the Aleutian Islands, Saipan, and New Britain.  You will note that all of those examples come from the war in the Pacific, and that is a shortcoming of this production that will undoubtedly frustrate some people.  The producers mention in the special features that the majority of American color film was shot in the Pacific.  Consequently, this production spends more of its time covering the Pacific war than the European.  While there is still a lot of great color footage from the fighting in Europe, it just seems to be spread much more thin than the footage from the Pacific (I'd say it's about a 60/40 split, Pacific to Europe).

I think that the hybridization of the documentary film with an arcing narrative following single individuals works splendidly and makes the footage more engaging than it otherwise would have been.  I think the name WWII in HD is a bit of a misnomer as none of the actual footage is in HD, but I guess WWII in Color--a more appropriate name--was already taken.  The music and narration are great.  They do a great job of showing where things are going on, especially in the Pacific, using their world map/globe.  I agree with another commenter that there is a little too much abrupt back and forth between storylines--Philippines, France, Philippines, France, Philippines--but this really is a minor quibble given the overall quality of the production.  It is also quite graphic in several places, so be forewarned of that.

I am so happy with this product and recommend it enthusiastically.",1274572800,3,3687,4.8126984126984125

3977508,2,B002RUNMMO,"This is the sloppiest presentation of WW2 I have ever seen. It is all over the place with no cohesive timeline. It's like an ADHD version of a WW2 history. There is a lot of great footage presented here, but it feels like the production team wanted to use everything they had so they threw it all together without much thought. The voice over actors are unnecessary especially when the real persons are alive and speaking for themselves. It becomes incredibly annoying when they go back and forth mixing the actor's voice with the real person's. And then there is the music score which is overdramatic and unnecessarily used. It sounds like a stock score for a Hollywood disaster B movie. I wasn't expecting much from this series for two reasons, it's from the History Channel, whose productions are usually very pedestrian and cater to people who need theatrics to get them interested in historical events, and secondly the title is nothing more than an obvious PR grab at the current hysteria over high definition audio/video.

This series wishes it could be Ken Burns' The War or even The World at War, which are the two definitive presentations of WW2. If only the production team behind WW2 in HD would have stuck with just telling the individual's stories in an intimate fashion rather than using their stories as merely an excuse to edit together the myriad amount of footage that they received.",1273104000,7,1402,4.793388429752066

3977570,3,B002RUNMMO,"As a World War II buff I immediately latched onto this new series. The stories are engrossing and audio is awesome however its far from perfect.

One gripe I have is that the flow of the series is somewhat flawed. There are multiple stories being told and I can understand it switching back and forth between them but it happens to quickly and too often for my taste making it hard to follow at times. Just when your starting to get settled into one story it suddenly switches over to another totally ruining your mood. It got pretty annoying.

I'd also have to question of this series needed to be on Blu-Ray since most of the old footage isn't optimized for HD.

If you love World War II in HD then you'll definitely love The Color of War even better. The series flowed in a way where you totally felt moved by the stories and heroic efforts unlike World War 2 in HD.",1268438400,,869,4.319018404907975

3977583,4,B002RUNMMO,"""Until now, the only way to see war like this was to live it,"" is one of the promotional tags.  And it's true.

Seventy-years in the making, culled from over 3,000 hours of footage - some of it newly discovered with narration from secret diaries.  This view of WWII from both sides is personal and detailed in a way I have never seen.

Originally broadcast on the History channel, this extraordinary ten-episode documentary (almost eight hours!) is nothing less than astonishing.  The majority of the footage is in color, high quality and not widely, if ever, broadcast.

This compelling, sprawling, film is the best account of WWII I have seen.  It does not flinch from the carnage of battle or the aftermath of combat.  I was shocked at the sight of Japanese civilians, after the battle of Saipan, throwing themselves off cliffs to avoid capture by American soldiers.

The time covered here begins with the period when Hitler was conquering his neighbors relatively unopposed and America seemed oblivious.  Then Pearl Harbor explodes and we're at war with the ""Japs"" in the Pacific.  We vividly experience the fighting at Guadalcanal, Tarawa, the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and bloody Iwo Jima.  We ride with the Germans in Europe and North Africa -- the invasion of Tunisia, D-day, the Battle of the Bulge.  The victory in Europe is brought to life as is the emotional release of the Japanese surrender after devastating bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

What I liked most about WWII in HD is that these events are viewed through personal experiences.  There's war correspondents; an Austrian immigrant who escaped the Nazis and enlisted in the U.S. Army; a nurse with General George Patton's Third Army; an African-American pilot; a Japanese-American medic who served heroically while his family was in an internment camp; and others, all voiced by actors like Rob Lowe, Amy Smart, LL Cool J and Steve Zahn.  Gary Sinise provides the effective narration with a detached even tone.

When experienced as a whole, this beautifully edited, powerful, dramatic epic works on the same level as a great novel.  Great care has been given to the most potent juxtaposition of words, images and music.  There are on-camera interviews with survivors who recall the horrific sacrifices that liberty apparently requires.

That said I can appreciate anything new or that adds knowledge or depth to a persons understanding and this mini series does both. The fact it is all real life footage is amazing considering the flow and pacing they achieved in editing. Another reviewing compared it to the fantastic mini series Band of Brother and I have to agree. What makes this so good is that it is real and the footage captured is heart wrenching and heart warming at times. It hard to believe at time that the footage you are seeing is sixty years old.

To those of you who insist in strict preservation this may be a downside but it was not to me, as I found the documentary to be a nice overview of American participation in the war. The film focuses solely on Americans, so if you want a view from all sides then this is not for you.
The narration is well done, with actors being chosen who sound similar to the actual veterans.

If this film has one flaw, it is that there is little discussion of the strategy and playing out of the war in comparison to other documentaries. That being said, I didn't buy an HD format to see generals sitting around a table in 1080p. For someone who desires stunning WWII visual footage, this is a good buy.",1266710400,,813,4.3841059602649
3977592,3,B002RUNMMO,"'Word War II in HD' is a noteworthy attempt to chronicle the Second World War. With excellent narration by Gary Sinese, and additional narrative by some of the 12 surviving veterans and their voice actor substitutes, 'WWII in HD' is probably the best series ever produced by the History Channel. Unfortunately, that isn't saying very much. Although I appreciate the effort made by the producers and the work made to find this footage, this is still a typical History Channel production orientated more towards entertaining than documenting.  Ken Burns 'War' or the BBC's  'World at War' it is not. Nor is it better than several docudramas made over the past years such as 'Band of Brothers' and 'The Pacific'. 'World War II in HD' stands in the middle of the pack of available WW II documentaries. The series at the least deserves kudos for the attempt of producing something new, and if any fault is to made, the discredit must squarely be given to the History Channel for so obviously restricting this production to its own set of documentary rules. I rated this series 3 stars for the valiant attempt at chronicling WW II, but DVD packaging faults necessarily reducing my real score to 2 1/2 stars.

Much is made about this series made in HD. Not true. All it really means is that the found footage had been transferred and cleaned up by computer for digital restoration and editing. Do not be disappointed that the footage is not really HD however. HD did not exist in the 1940's and the editors did a good job making the existing footage presentable for modern television screens.

Much is also made that the producers spend 2 years searching for color footage never before seen on TV. No big deal here either. Most of what was not generally seen before is archived footage and home movies. The series makes great use of color footage, colorized footage (despite the Amazon note in the description, colorized film is used a lot), tinted black&white, and standard black&white. Most of the color footage is from the American war in the Pacific. This should be no surprise to anybody because it was primarily Navy and Marine combat photographers in the Pacific who used color during WW II. Color footage in Europe was rare and mostly taken during the last weeks of the war in Germany and Eastern Europe.

The History Channel is well know for producing lightweight history filled with over-dramatization, simplification of events, and repetition of material. Luckily, except for over-dramatization, 'World War II in HD' is an exception. The series is a decent production that truly shines in several of the 10 episodes. One wonders what could have been achieved if the producers had been given an adequate budget and plenty of time to pull it all together. But that is not how the History Channel operates. The History Channel is an entertainment channel. It is not a video documentary producer as is PBS or the BBC. 'World War II in HD' reflect this by being overly dramatic. Video clips used for the narration are obviously selected and edited for dramatic effect. Some clips do not fit at all. Added sound effects are plentiful (sound was rarely recorded in combat footage) and the music sound track often overwhelms the source material. Still, the compelling nature of the script often shines through the hype.

The series follows the course of the war from an American perspective, a fact not indicated anywhere in the production copy. No mention is made of the Eastern European theatre nor that of Southeast Asia. In fact any theatre of war that seems to have had limited American filming is given short rift. There is little on North Africa for example. It would have been nice to indicate somewhere in this series how 'worldwide' this world war really was. There is plenty of German, Russian, and British footage available, especially in color, that could have been used.

The series is basically bookmarked by the stories of 12 veterans of WW II. Some of the vets are given more exposure than others. The story of the war is told through the eyes of the vets via narration by some of the still living vets or by an actor's spoken words that I presume to be the written words of some of them (some of the vets were journalists). It is here that the series truly shines. Not up to Ken Burn standards, but a good attempt anyway, marred by spending not enough time with these still living survivors.

And lastly, The series set is cheaply produced which is why I downgrade this series to 2 1/2 stars. The set does not contain a printed information sheet. There is no list of episodes anywhere in the package. The bonus extras add nothing to understanding the production. Bonuses include 2 three minute videos that basically states that the footage was transferred to computer for digital cleanup and outtakes of 6 of the living veterans. There is no 'Making of ...' video. The DVD set  does not have captions for the hearing impaired, alternate language selections, or episode scene indexing. This set is very bare bones.

In summary, this is a minor league edutainment set that is somewhat interesting and worth the asking price because it so low. If, however, you are interested in great video WW II history, buyers would be better served by DVD sets from the BBC, PBS, and other producers.

This review is for the standard DVD set. I have not seen the Blu-Ray version.",1266710400,3,5377,4.758583690987124

The actual video quality of this title is superb, and the production is top notch real-life storytelling. But this title is now of little value to my near-deaf Grandfather who actually fought in the Battle of the Bulge.

And for those who don't really believe the lack of subtitles merit this 1 star rating, I point out that The History Channel put this together as a NARRATIVE of 12 individual lives featured in the footage. Without the subtitles, the narrative becomes worthless and this is just another stock footage dime-a-dozen WWII documentary.

3977613,1,B002RUNMMO,"I was intrigued by the idea of rare, recovered color film footage from the World War II era, something that can give a glimpse into a foggy past.  I had hoped to be shown recovered film from the area, perhaps accompanied by an explanation of where and how the film was shot, what the context of the film is, other significant details, and how it was found and recovered.

That's not remotely what this is.

Instead, this is a poorly done ""recollections of World War II"" documentary that follows a dozen people through the war, and uses quick snatches of color footage to accompany it.  In other words, the color footage is distinctly secondary at best.

The show does not explain where these recollections come from.  Actors are paid to voice them.  The show constantly switches from geographic place to place, and also inexplicably switches back and forth in time.

The footage is ostensibly related to the battles, places, etc., where these people were, but the producers essentially ignore the footage itself.  None of it is ever explained.  Moreover, it is chopped so much in editing that the average time any given roll of film appears on screen is one or two seconds.  Then, bam, cut to another shot for a second or two, bam, cut, bam, cut, bam, cut.  The viewer has absolutely NO OPPORTUNITY to spend time actually taking in any of the film footage, because it has been diced to bits and spliced together.

Moreover, there's no sense that much of the footage is even related to the events talked about in the show.  I saw many things that looked like they were filmed elsewhere, but were just stuck in here because there was something about them that provided a visual for what the voice actor was saying.  This includes stock footage of the ""enemy,"" such as Germans firing machineguns.  Are we given to think that somehow color footage of German machineguns being fired at Lammersdorf was recovered to be shown along with the American footage of Lammersdorf?  Obviously, it was from something completely different, just stuck in because it looked good.  How much of this is actually the case?  We are never told.  Indeed, the end credits flash by so quick, and are so information-free, that it is impossible really to know what footage came from where.  There was one shot of a country-side that accompanied a voice actor talking about being sent back to San Antonio to recover from wounds--well, I have lived in San Antonio and I know that shot was taken nowhere near south-central Texas.

This show will be totally disappointing to anybody who wanted to experience color WWII film footage.

Moreover, not all the film is even in color.  There is still considerable black and white film.  Some of the film, too, bears some of the hallmarks of colorization, though I can't be sure.

Also, I am sure none of the film footage shot had accompanying sound.  This means that all the sound in the show is completely fabricated--though it is inserted in such a way that the viewer is clearly meant to think that this is sound that actually was recorded at the time the footage was recorded.

This was tremendously disappointing.  I am amazed that the producers of this show deliberately butchered so much color footage and rendered it completely useless.  Shame on them.

I could only recommend this to someone who knows very little about World War II.",1264550400,99,3353,4.739205526770293

3977616,3,B002RUNMMO,"WWII in HD does a good job of using personal stories to tell a larger tale.  Gary Sinise is a great narrator.  The real-life soldiers/sailors/marines are terrific and their story is worthy of being told.

The production suffers from two main problems, that pull it down from being the best of class in the area of color WWII documentaries.

1) There is heavy use of colorized film.  For example, you can now watch General MacArthur wade ashore in a film you've seen before, but now it's in color.  I found that to be too distracting to abide.  There are many, many other cases of film colorization, this is just the most shocking.

2) There is a lot of unnecessary back and forth... from Leyte to Europe, then back to Leyte, then back to Europe, then back to Leyte, then to somewhere else in Europe, then back to Leyte...  At each transition, there is a high-tech, google-earth-like movement across the globe that I found out of place and amateurish given the seriousness of the subject.

I found ""World War II - The Lost Color Archives"", sold right here at Amazon.com (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-War-II-The-Lost-Color-Archives/dp/0767026977/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World War II - The Lost Color Archives</a>), to be a much more satisfying experience.  That documentary does a better job of using its 100% authentic color film to tell the story of WWII.

While ""WWII in HD"" is not the best documentary, either about WWII, or in the sub-genre of color presentation of the war, it should be considered a quality addition to the canon.  In other words, if you own several other documentaries, you should consider getting this one too, for what it adds.

3977618,5,B002RUNMMO,"I ordered this DVD set after watching the first episode on The History Channel. I think that we need to protect every bit of film, every photograph that preserves the memory of not only the great heroes of the greatest war ever, but the horror of what war is, so that we never, ever embark upon such a path again without first trying our damndest to find another way. This series shows color footage culled from hidden archives and personal  collections, linked by the stories of various individuals who participated in some way or another - an infantryman, a pilot and author, a nurse, a Tuskegee airman, a Nisei, and more. Actors provide a surprisingly competent performance - giving voice to the thoughts and words  of  people who are long gone.  Survivors are also interviewed, and it is clear that the memories of those events remain as clear now as they were sixty years ago. Some of the images are disturbingly graphic, so I do advise caution with watching with smaller children. The quality of some of the footage is rather poor, so don't be disappointed if the images are not crystal clear like the promised HD. Some of the sections were not particularly strong - the part profiling the Tuskegee Airman seemed rather thin - but I assume that there was a paucity of good footage, so I didn't really consider this to be that great a weakness.  Very significant battles were entirely skipped over, but I think that it was beyond the scope of this project to completely summarize the entire war, nor do I think it necessary. I think that the series did what it set out to do - show us small glimpses into the world at war, give both evil and heroism a face, and make us remember even as the last survivors and their accounts fade away.",1261958400,22,1740,4.546325878594249

Again, a very very few scenes, certainly less than 1% of all the footage shown so this is a very minor criticism and I readily give the overall series 5 stars of 5 and 10 out of 10 on the IMDB scale.
