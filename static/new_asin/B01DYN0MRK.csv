Found that a few of the discs got damaged over time sliding them in and out of the sleeves that they were held in the blu-ray books that contained them for the 50 year collection. With this ultimate collection I now the two latest Bond films with Daniel Craig and some extra Bonus Features that wasn't in the 50 year collection. I've always been a huge Bond fan since I was a teenager. My top three Bond actors would be: 1: Sean Connery 2: Daniel Craig 3: Roger Moore.

There are four ""Unofficial"" James Bond films, not produced by Cubby Broccoli or the Broccoli family (Eon Productions).
None are in this box.
Two of them involve the Connery family.
Three of the four unofficial films are on Blu-Ray (although one is hard to find on Amazon)
They are the result of business deals negotiated by Ian Fleming early in his career, before he met Cubby Broccoli.

[for ease of navigation, read this review through to the end, then come back and click on the links.]

----- 1954: ""CASINO ROYALE"" - starring Barry Nelson
This is a one-hour black and white American TV production - one year after the book's publication.
Aside from the fact that Barry Nelson plays American agent ""Jimmy Bond"", this is reasonably faithful to the book,
though the torture scene is played down:
James Bond is placed into a bathtub fully clothed and Le Chiffre (Peter Lorre) does something to him, but we're not sure what.
Cool that Peter Lorre was the first Bond Villain.
- The Blu-Ray is expensive and hard-to-find.
Cheaper if you don't mind getting it on DVD.
Sometimes available as an Amazon download.
-- For directions on how to locate the 1954 Casino Royale on Blu-Ray, see the first Comment (dated July 26, 2016) following this review.

----- 1967: ""CASINO ROYALE"" - starring David Niven
David Niven plays Sir James Bond, who retired from British Intelligence after World War II - but M still seeks his help when needed.
After retirement, Bond's 007 number was kept active to confuse England's enemies.
All subsequent 007s were also required to adopt the name ""James Bond"" - this actually makes sense, considering the different actors involved.
- it's a Comedy. Sort of.

----- 1983: ""NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN"" - starring Sean Connery
52 Year old Sean Connery came out of retirement for an enormous salary.
Its a remake of ""Thunderball"".
Not as good as the original, but Sean Connery is always worth watching.
- Plus, if you count this as Sean Connery's 7th Bond film, he ties the record previously held by Roger Moore.

----- 1967: ""OPERATION DOUBLE 007"" - starring Neil Connery.
The fourth unofficial film has no connection to either Ian Fleming or Cubby Broccoli, though it does have a connection to Sean Connery.

- James Bond is in hospital recovering from injuries.
- M needs a replacement for an important mission.
- None of the other 00s are up to the task, so M seeks out James Bond's brother.
If nothing else, the producers deserve credit for Audacity:
They hired Neil Connery - Sean Connery's brother - to play James Bond's brother.
Makes sense, I guess.
For legal reasons, he cannot be addressed as ""Mr. Bond"", so in the movie he is called ""Mr. Connery"" (actually ""Dr. Connery"").

For the first twenty years of the Bond franchise, the leadership of British Intelligence was unquestioned:
- Bernard Lee was M - James Bond's boss.
- Lois Maxwell was Moneypenny - M's secretary.
- Desmond Llewelyn was Q - Quartermaster and weapons expert.
For this film:
- Bernard Lee was hired to play the ""Director of Allied Counter-Intelligence"".
- Lois Maxwell was hired to play his secretary ""Miss Maxwell"".
- Only Desmond Llewelyn resisted the temptation. Or he was busy doing something else.

More connections to the world of Bond:
- The villain is Adolfo Celi. He was the villain in ""Thunderball"" (1965).
- The villain's henchman is Anthony Dawson. He was the villain's henchman in ""Dr. No"" (1962).
- The Bond Babe is Daniella Bianchi. She was the Bond Babe in ""From Russia with Love"" (1963).

Also known as ""Operation Kid Brother"" or ""O.K. Connery"".
Unlike the 1967 Casino Royale, this is not a comedy - these people are serious.
For more information, go to Wikipedia and look up the article on ""O.K. Connery"".

-- It is not available on DVD or Blu-Ray.
-- It is available as an Amazon Download under the title:
""Operation Kid Brother""

BUT - Most of this film is available as part of a 4 DVD boxed set: ""Mystery Science Theater 3000, Volume XXV""
Unfortunately not available separately.
The movie download is 1 hour, 46 minutes.
This Mystery Science Theater version is 1 hour, 16 minutes (+ 16 minutes of sketch comedy).
I love MST3K. You may not.

- The Mystery Science Theater version is also available as an Amazon Download under the title:
""Mystery Science Theater 3000: Operation Kid Brother""

P.S. When this episode of MST3K was originally shown on Comedy Central back in 1993,
the title was still ""Operation Double 007"".
By the time of the 2012 DVD release, the title had been changed to ""Operation Kid Brother"",
But the title on the film print still reads ""Operation Double 007"".
---------------

Roger Moore holds the record with seven Official Appearances as James Bond.
Sean Connery is second with six Official Appearances as James Bond.
BUT
If you count Sean Connery in ""Never Say Never Again"", they are tied at seven.
AND
If you count ""Operation Double-007"" as a Bond film, the Connery Family beats Roger Moore's record.

7726307,5,B01DYN0MRK,"Got these separately for my Dad for Christmas and he's loved going through these (well got the big set for Christmas with a kid made ""coupon"" good for Spectre when it came out). You may think that you're not getting much of a savings because there's a Blu-ray set that's currently $80 and Spectre goes for $15--BUT that's the set without the digital HD copy. The version without Spectre and with digital HD is $140 and Spectre is $15 so you're saving $65 buying this deal of the day today. There also is a Bond 50 Blu-ray set that came out before Skyfall but that's gotten expensive because it's out of print. There are no DVDs in any of the Bond Blu-ray sets--Blu-ray + Digital only!

This ultimate collection has a lot better packaging than the Bond 50 collection. The Bond 50 had all the Blu-rays in a book. This Ultimate Bond Collection has all the discs in plastic cases that are like normal DVD cases just bigger. I think it's much less likely that you'll scratch the discs. The 1962-1972 case holds 10 discs. The 1979-2002 case also has 10 disks. The 2006-20015 case has 4 discs and a space for Spectre. The last set has 4 discs because there's a bonus feature disc--""Over 120 hours of Special Features including 2 all-new featurettes and a 90 minute documentary EVERYTHING OR NOTHING: THE UNTOLD STORY OF 007"". We're not extra people so I don't think we've watched the special features. I don't remember if you get the bonus feature disc in digital too. The Bond 50 set had a spot for Skyfall, but it said ""Skyfall coming soon"" on the spot. I like how this set just says Spectre in the list with no ""coming soon"".

So you could toss the Spectre box and put the disc in the box set. Again there is a spot for the Spectre disc. The Spectre disc face doesn't match the rest of the collection discs, but it's nice to have it all together in one place. Until you add Spectre, there's a paper or cardboard placeholder (don't remember which). Don't forget to add the Spectre digital copy code separately!

The only Digital HD is ultraviolet. There is no Itunes digital. My parents started watching the Blu-ray, but I added the digital so they could watch them in the VUDU channel on their Roku 3 and they've watched a couple there now too. It's their first time watching the digital version and they think it's cool that they don't have to change disks. I know the quality isn't quite as good, but they've not made any complaints.

There's also a little book with movie posters. I glanced at it Christmas day, and I don't think the book is anything amazing. The print quality is very nice, but it's small enough to fit in the Blu-ray set and it is paperback. It's fun to glance through--once.

Overall, this is the best set yet for Bond. I know some people think Bond 50 looks fancier, but I would much rather have Blu-ray style cases than a book. I'm really happy with this set and the deal of the day is a nice price.",1467676800,64,2920,4.430167597765363

7726350,5,B01DYN0MRK,"I am incredibly happy with this collection for several reasons:

First of all, I have seen some of the old movies in the past, and seeing the movies again in blu-ray is amazing. The video quality of the early movies in this collection is incredible.

Secondly, If you bought the collection during the Prime day promotion, you received a lot of movies for $90.

Thirdly, unlike the Bond 50 collection, this collection is very compact, containing three bulk Blu ray boxes with all the movies inside them, organized in their release date order. The first box containing the movies from 1962 to 1977, the second box containing the movies from 1979 to 2002 and the third box containing the movies from 2006 to 2012 with the bonus content disc and an empty spot dedicated to Spectre. There is also a small book with all the movies posters.

Additionally, you are also get a voucher code to download all the movies digitally, but you cannot download them from iTunes or Google Play except Spectre.

With that being said however, I think the collection is lacking extra physical content besides the posters book. If the collection would come with a hardcover book of artworks, I could tell this collection is far better than the Bond 50 collection, but since it is lacking these extra physical content, it is hard to determine which collection is better. I bet it all goes down to the price of the collections and the space you are willing to allocate for your preferred collection.

Never the less, for $90 this was an excellent deal!",1469836800,3,1527,4.700374531835206

7726356,4,B01DYN0MRK,"While the movies are great and the content was as expected, I want to clarify something for other buyers. While spectre is digital HD in that you can chose (either iTunes or Ultraviolet not both) all the other Bond50 movies are only ultraviolet. Why can't these movie studios take Disney's lead (or Even universal) and allow one movie purchase to unlock digital content on both iTunes and Ultraviolet. It prevents customer locking and allows customers to use the device most convenient to them at that moment in time. If I want to use my apple tv I need iTunes, if I use my Smart TV I need Ultraviolet (or Amazon Instance Video), if I use my iPad I want to use iTunes, if I playon on my PC I may want Ultraviolet. You get the idea.

Very bad on Fox to still be behind the times in how it allows customers to register content. Hats off to Disney for spending the money to design a system to allow customers to watch content wherever (including sync with Amazon); but not good on Fox for taking the easy way out and just do one option.

8757326,5,B01DYN0MRK,"Now this is how a boxed set is done (DO YOU HEAR ME WARNER BROTHERS!!).  You get every EON Production Bond Movie in Blu-Ray.  This is the High-Def version of the Lowry Digital remaster DVDs that I did have.  Also contained on each disc is all the bonus content on those original DVDs.  You get the entire collection up to and including Spectre.  And as an added bonus, you get a digital copy (Ultraviolet) of all 23 movies.  I was able to get this on a deal of the day for $90.  SCORE!!
