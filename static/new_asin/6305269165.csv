1003328,1,6305269165,"Starts off like might be pretty sexy.  Yet, only about 15% of the movie involves anything remotely sexy.  In fact, the first real scene doesn't happen until about thirty minutes in.
The sexiest scene in the movie involves the two main characters entering a hotel room where the woman (Jennifer Burton) has tied up a beautiful blonde (Jennifer Behr).  Without introductions, talks the man into pleasuring her.  Well... it could've been sexy, had the director not cut back and forth like a jack-rabbit sitting on a shot for no longer than three or four seconds.
Well... if there isn't a lot of sex and the scenes aren't all that sexy, then you better have a well written story.  Uh... It isn't.  Picture quality is terrible and the writing is deplorable.",998179200,18,752,4.746153846153846

7886598,1,6305269165,"First off, I want to say that Jennifer Burton's performance in this movie was really good. She was clearly someone that took acting classes and hoped to land better roles than what she ultimately ended up getting relegated to.

That said, it's a bad movie but I didn't have a visceral hatred for it like some of the reviewers on IMDB. This is the kind of movie you should watch if you want to kick back with some friends and have some unintentional laughs. The scene where Jeff and Mitch are arguing in the police department and the scene where Jeff takes a phone sex call right in the middle of an important business meeting are definite howlers. The latter scene will make you quite glad that the internet permanently killed 1-900 numbers. And the music score by Todd Schroder is easily the worst besides the music in ""Howling: New Moon Rising"" but it will keep you laughing as much as the torturously bad country music in that movie, especially the first song which is played during what looked like the lamest high school reunion ever filmed.

So overall, check out this movie only if you can find it on a premium channel or if you happen to catch it on Amazon's great Prime Instant Video service but I definitely would not recommend spending $15 or more on the tape.",1402790400,3,1271,4.521739130434782
7886599,5,6305269165,"It was a used VHS tape.  The cover was a little worn, but to me that only indicated that a lot of people must have rented the movie.  I purchased it because my son had a small part in it and I wanted to surprise him with the movie for Christmas.",1260662400,,245,3.784313725490196
7886600,4,6305269165,"It's the first time I watch a softcore movie with acceptable plot of story. Jennifer Burton might be at her best performance while filming this movie; very fascinating and attractive. In overall, this movie is worth your money and your Friday night. Rating four star just because the picture of VHS Tape is much better than the DVD. No wonder the price of VHS Tape is much higher than of DVD.",1169337600,3,392,4.535211267605634
