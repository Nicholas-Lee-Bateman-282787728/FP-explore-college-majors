4834146,5,B005M5OS6K,"If you miss Charlie Sheen ref. 2 1/2 Men, you might want to buy Spin City , that same persona that made Men good comes through in SC",1348185600,5,132,3.75
4834147,5,B005M5OS6K,It was funny for the time it was made. It's too bad they didn't have a better ending for the last season.,1341360000,3,105,3.8181818181818183
4834148,3,B005M5OS6K,"It's the sixth and final season of the show and it's finally out to complete our collection. It's the same usual bare-bones release like the others. Just the episodes, no bonuses or anything like that.
The sixth season was aired in 720p. And it would have been so good if these dvds were in widescreen but they aren't. Instead, it's in full frame. If they released a blu-ray or even a widescreen version of the sixth season, I would be all over that. I would buy those in a heart beat.",1332720000,4,485,4.34065934065934

8479153,3,B005M5OS6K,"Spin City has been one of my favorite TV shows for years. I was disappointed that Charlie Sheen and Heather Locklear took over the show, but compared to their predecessor, they did a formidable job. Overall this season was alright. The series finale was one of the poorest finales I have ever seen. It gave no real ending to the show.",1430611200,,334,4.491803278688525
