5358175,5,B009NUAY86,You best believe it's got that Wolfmans brother. Julius is on point. First ever cover of trench town? I'm talking Down with disease!! And you know it's got that hot fire Runaway Jim > Meat!!! Funky mcfunksters,1358899200,,209,4.675675675675675
5358176,5,B009NUAY86,"Classic, clear, smooth, brilliant, Phish! This DVD set is a must for all Phish fans...magnificent show! Great venue! If you want to see Phish doing what they do best, then this is for you.",1357603200,2,188,4.5588235294117645
5358177,5,B009NUAY86,"Pretty much exactly what I was going to say. I was there. This was always one of my favorite shows and it's not a hometown show or my first show or anything like that, just a rippin (and overlooked) Summer '98 throwdown. Start to finish it smokes. The Wolfman's > Time Loves a Hero... The DWD... But really, it's worth owning just for the 30-minute Runaway Jim and the impeccable sbd audio. If you're hesitating just because the video is from 1998 and therefore not HD, I have one word for you: don't. Also, go buy it through Phish Dry Goods not Amazon.",1357603200,,553,4.378640776699029
5358178,4,B009NUAY86,"This DVD, as the text says, was taken from the Pavilion's closed circuit camera system...and it shows compared to just about any other Phish DVD.  It has that low def, grainy, VHS look to it. That being said...the band SMOKES.  Personally, I think 1998 was the high water mark of 1.0 (and 2.0), and this set shows it.  They're all still having great fun, they have the funk-infused groove, they're not too stoned or dysfunctional, and they open up with Bob Marley!  Would have been a great show to see live.  Audio quality and the 5.1 surround are superb.  Excellent sound board recordings and mastering.",1355443200,10,604,4.704761904761905

8543255,5,B009NUAY86,Brand new and perfect. Love the star lake 98 show especially the 34 min Jim and Time Loves a Hero bustout,1517356800,,105,4.0476190476190474
8543256,5,B009NUAY86,Trenchtown rock opener. One of the best Runaway Jim's ever played. Just wonderful,1516924800,,81,5.3076923076923075
8543257,3,B009NUAY86,"Great show, horrible resolution.  Looked like it was filmed on reel to reel.  I was at the show, so it was great to experience it again!",1425859200,,136,4.1923076923076925
8543258,5,B009NUAY86,"Nice to have camera angle choice, seems to be a rare option these days.
I was to be at this show but missed it, for something better, the birth of a child.
 ""Grateful"" for the DVD!",1416614400,,180,4.0
8543259,4,B009NUAY86,Thanks,1407456000,,6,6.0
8543260,4,B009NUAY86,Runaway Jim in the 2nd set makes this Dvd a worthwhile purchase period and the Wolfmans - Time loves a Hero isn't bad either children so get this for sure add it to your collection. Aloha...,1397952000,,190,4.305555555555555
8543261,5,B009NUAY86,Great. As always the boys rock this DVD as they do all they're others. A must have in your collection.,1383436800,,102,4.15
8543262,4,B009NUAY86,Some great music throughout but the second set really takes off. The video quality is sub-par though so I can't rate 5 stars,1367107200,2,124,4.434782608695652
8543263,3,B009NUAY86,"When i put the dvds on which came in very nice packaging i expected video quality to be on par, but the video quality looks as if the video was shot in the 70's or 80's. Very Poor. Sound quality is good and nice to hear in 5.1 surround. Cheap price makes up for s*** video i guess. STILL WAITING FOR BLU RAY PHISH CONCERTS!!!",1359417600,,325,4.015384615384615
