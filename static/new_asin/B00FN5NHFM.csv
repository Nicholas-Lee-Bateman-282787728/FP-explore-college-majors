8617106,5,B00FN5NHFM,"I don't usually like samurai dramas because I find them boring. Most of the time it's just a bunch of bald men shouting. Happily, this drama is not like that at all. It is based on the true story of Yamamoto Yae who lived in Aizu in the late 1800's. During this time Japan had been forced to open its ports to western ships by Commodore Perry and a power struggle was going on between the Emperor and the Shogun. This would culminate in the Boshin War, a civil war between the forces of the Emperor and those of the Tokugawa Shogun. Yae's father and brother are samurai from a family that is known for its expertise in firearms and artillery. Yae also wants to learn to shoot, even though this is outside the norm for women.

During season 1, we follow the story of Yae from the age of 6 to her early twenties before the start of the war. Yae is a free-spirited tomboy with a good heart and you can't help but like her. Woven in to her story are the stories of her brother and the clan lord. Yae's brother falls in with free-thinkers who believe the best way to protect Japan from the west is to study western science and medicine. This is in opposition to the majority of Japanese, who want to remain in isolation and throw the foreigners out (despite the futility of this idea). He realizes that Japanese muskets are no match for western rifles and tries to modernize the stodgy military, which still wants to fight using swords and bows. Meanwhile, the clan lord tries to keep Aizu safe despite his conflicting loyalties to the Emperor and Shogun.

The drama is eminently watchable. The child actress who plays young Yae is surprisingly good and the actors playing adult Yae, her family and the clan lord are all very relatable, which makes you want to know what happens to them next. The series is serious but has lighter moments, many of them provided by Yae herself. The political machinations, which I usually find impenetrable and boring in other samurai dramas, are fairly straightforward and don't drag on the story too much. This is a drama, not an action movie, so there isn't much fighting though there is some bloodshed. The tension ratchets up over the course of the season as civil war threatens and the lord of Aizu is put in an impossible situation that could lead to the destruction of the clan (including our heroine and her family).

Be aware that the entire show is 50 episodes long, so there is no resolution at the end of this season and you are facing buying 4 more box sets. Season 1 consists of ten 40 minute episodes on 3 discs in a fold-out cardboard case. Production values are very good and the English subtitles are fairly professional. (While there are a few wonky translations it's not bad.) At the end of each episode is a short travelogue-type thingy showing the real places and people in the drama. Unfortunately, this part isn't subtitled, but it will still make you want to travel to Japan. All in all, this is an interesting drama about a part of Japanese history that isn't well known to westerners and I'm really looking forward to watching season 2.",1449014400,3,3092,4.517857142857143
8617107,5,B00FN5NHFM,"This strong drama has the assurance you'd expect with top-notch actors and production, with the eminently watchable Haruka Ayase in the main role. The photography is often striking, relying on the type of lighting you'd expect to find in a period drama.",1410220800,,253,5.0476190476190474
8617108,2,B00FN5NHFM,"The Yae's story is very interesting, and worthwhile. I enjoyed watching this series while in the US very much.  I'd give the story 5 stars.
However, I was hoping to use this series to build my Japanese, but they didn't include Japanese Subtitles when they created these DVDs.  That was a VERY POOR CHOICE since the Japanese version of this series includes Japanese subtitles.  I'm very disappointed & give the configuration of the DVDs 1 star.",1402185600,,443,4.802631578947368
