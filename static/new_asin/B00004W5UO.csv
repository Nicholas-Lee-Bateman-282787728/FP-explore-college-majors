Those who appreciate the strange absurdities of the modern world will love this movie! The music is great, the skits are funny, and yet Ray Mahoney also manages to keep a great artistic perspective- with beautiful shots. Bacon Head holds up a mirror to the modern world and asks, ""really?!!""",1230076800,,409,4.694444444444445

8324657,1,B00004W5UO,"Do not waste your time or your money on this movie.  It's only quality that could possibly get it some recognition is that Preston Lacy from Jackass has a role in it.  I watched its release in Denver at The Bluebird, and the actors, producers, director, etc. touted it as the best indie film since whatever indie film was popular at the time.  The only people laughing were people directly involved with it.  It was insultingly unfunny and robbed 2 hours of my life.",1066780800,,466,4.511904761904762
8324658,5,B00004W5UO,"If you haven't heard of Ray Mahoney, the director of Bacon Head, you aren't alone. But in all honesty, this unknown independent has displayed comic genius far exceeding anything that Hollywood has ever put in a movie.  Bacon Head is a collection of several different sketches and a few commercials that seem unrelated but are tied together in the finale. The entire film was shot in black and white but it really was barely noticeable because of the excellent writing. In fact, there were hardly any moments which didn't have me and all of my friends rolling on the floor in laughter. The very first sketch is a very clever play on words which seemed to have a foundation in Abbott and Costello routines, but all in all the whole project has an individual feel to it that draws the viewer into Mahoney's surreal world. Another huge plus is all of the original music that ties in with most of the sketches is as superbly written as the jokes. The high point of the entire work is ""Quinlan the Detailing Tubbist"", a half ad-half music video that made me laugh longer than anything in the past two years.  In conclusion, fans of anything from Monty Python to South Park will love Bacon Head. These 90 minutes of VHS seemed to singlehandedly capture anything and everything that I find funny. If I was making a movie, I could only hope that it will be a tenth the cinematic masterpiece that Bacon Head is.",980121600,4,1401,4.555555555555555
