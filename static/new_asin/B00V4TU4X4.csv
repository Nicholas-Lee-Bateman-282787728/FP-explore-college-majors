7076710,4,B00V4TU4X4,I rented this movie from red box and I really enjoyed this movie has a good twisted plot. I think over all this movie is great will add it to my collection.......,1428364800,,162,4.09375
7076711,1,B00V4TU4X4,"It appears there is a snitch in the group of thugs that get robbed of their drop money. They still have to pay it back in a confused plot  of Jamaicans,  gang members, whose-your-daddy, and an abundance of black on black crime...because black lives matter, except for maybe to  Alyze Elyse who wrote this mess and displayed her inability to act too by providing herself a role.

The film appears to have been shot somewhere in Greensboro, NC because they pulled out what appears to be an actual car registration (not good) from the county...they also has Progressive Insurance.  The Jamaican accents made me cringe as did all that macho- n-word testosterone filled dialogue.

I didn't consider it worth watching.",1427932800,,712,4.891666666666667

8709237,5,B00V4TU4X4,"Watch it.  I gave five stars because it totally delivers despite the temporary bad acting from the mayor and his wife.  Their bits are brief.  Don't let the low budget appearance fool you.  I almost passed it myself, but I'm so glad I watched. Stupendous....and the ending is unforgettable.",1531612800,,290,4.857142857142857
8709238,1,B00V4TU4X4,"Awful, cringe-worthy and stereotypical. The story line was not cohesive and over all just stupid. Two thumbs way down.",1531008000,,118,5.2631578947368425
8709239,5,B00V4TU4X4,"This movie was not what I expected. I didn't expect the plot to deliver much and brushed it off as another low budget black film, but I was wrong.  This movie is worth seeing. The twist at the end blew me out of my seat. Great movie from Alyze.",1528588800,,244,3.979591836734694
