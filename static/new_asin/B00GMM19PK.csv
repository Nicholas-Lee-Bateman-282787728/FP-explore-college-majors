8624686,4,B00GMM19PK,"I really enjoyed this but there was something missing. This show was good but there was so much missing. I am sure that there was not enough time to delve into all of the history of the copper country's history but there was very important details left out that I felt like a person totally unfamiliar with the area may have just watched and been clueless as to what was going on. I watched and thought, ""how could they have left that out?"" Movies are that way a lot of times though. Never enough time to tell the whole story.",1393804800,,526,4.27
8624687,5,B00GMM19PK,"An example of the struggles of the working people in the U.S. to achieve work equity - to provide safety for the workers, and work standards of pay equity.  It was a tragic period and the strikers didn't win, but it is an example of how the governmental laws were stacked against them.  Something to think about as the middle class jobs are shrinking and wages diminishing, Unions without influence, and jobs being set overseas.  A early history of the labor movement and comparative with today's employment options.  There is little access to this information, and it is an important part of U.S. history.",1392163200,,606,4.798076923076923

8624689,5,B00GMM19PK,"Most of the miners  were immigrants from Finland, Italy, Croatia and other countries. There were no labor standards from the US government and the state of Michigan and many of the workers died in the mines. The workers formed a union to fight the mine owners who put in labor standards to increase efficiency, which put miners' lives at risk.
Today the state of Michigan and many midwestern and southern states have passed so-called right to work legislation to ban unions. More progressive states still allow unions. In California unions are allowed. Where do you shop for groceries? Safeway, for example, is a union store and WalMart has lower prices but ignores labor laws such as overtime pay. I am willing to pay a little more to shop at a union store. How about you?",1390521600,,773,4.725925925925926
8624690,5,B00GMM19PK,"I watched this PBS video and I want to own it because it meant so much to me.  My ancestors came to Northern Michigan for a better life. This video taught me so much more about the history of mining and the big strike of 1913.  I always knew about the horrible event at the Italian Hall, but didn't know what really happened until I saw this video on PBS!  This is very well put together with photos, old movies, and local people who shared what they knew and learned from their parents who lived through all of this.  What a tragedy at the Italian Hall!  That was such a sad story and hard to watch in a few places, but it happened, so it should be a part of this story.  This video should be of interest to anyone who is interested in the history of mining.  They even touched on the gold mining going on at the same time in Cripple Creek, CO.  I live near there now and left the Copper Country in the early 70's.  I do feel at home when I see the old mine shafts in Cripple Creek, that are like the ones still in Michigan!  I especially liked the song written by Woody Guthrie about the old Italian Hall event.  The gentleman who sang the song in the video did a great job!  I can't wait to see this again!",1388448000,3,1209,4.0548523206751055
