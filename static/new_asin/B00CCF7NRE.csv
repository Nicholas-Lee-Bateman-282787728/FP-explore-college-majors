8580273,5,B00CCF7NRE,"""I Want to Run"" is a different kind of documentary, true to the bones to its indie status. Its message may come from a modern set Cervantes story - reinstating meaning at the core of a relative world. Or from the minimalist approach of the film makers themselves - closer to the blog genre, on the fly, minimally processed and retouched behind the scenes. In that sense, the story is as much about the protagonists as it is about the story-tellers themselves. The story permeates from both sides of the lens, reframing the mindset of the viewer. The storytelling returns to a purity unencumbered by futile special effects, post processing and other distractors.

A foot race crossing Europe from Southern Italy to the Artic Circle, bringing together people with a common ""affliction"" - their unconditional love of running. Director Hasenberg does a great job gluing together the individual stories into a coherent whole.
