8022618,4,B0002659AS,"This story is done round robin style ,9 stories with 2 main characters and one of this characters is in the next story. One girl (Corrine Alphen) is included in the first and last story. In the first story it looks as if in the R rated video a bit was cut out from the original release that was on The Playboy Channel. There is a bootleg DVD and many people complain about this cut but it is the same scene on a offical VHS release. The movie is the Lightning Video release and most copies sold are former rentals. The movie is an anthology and not much of a story ,the time early eighties ,was post disco but pre AIDS.And that is problably the most interesting part of the movie along with scenes filmed in and around New York. Plato's retreat is used as a filming location and a nice shot of Central Park. But since most of the shots are at night ,it limits the interest in history. Corrine Alphen is the main reason people are interested in the movie,she actually has longer speaking parts in this movie compared to Spring Break ,Brainwaves and her TV appearances .Equalizer 2000 is the best movie she made for amount of scene time. Her nudity in this movie is problably her best,worth getting the movie for a reasonable price. I doubt this will ever make it to Blu Ray ,it would sell enough but either the original 35 mm print is missing or most likely too much Passion.""Passion"" as in the Rod Stewart song that is in the money ,the song is used and the melody also,it would have to be cut out because it would cost more for the royalties now that the movie caused to make 3O plus years ago.",1449100800,,1595,4.3023255813953485
