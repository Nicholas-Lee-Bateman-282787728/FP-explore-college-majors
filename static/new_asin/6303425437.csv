A couple of odd song choices, but it's like a sing along from beginning to end. The music is really almost too perfect for a live performance, but still, there it is. If you're going to own one Glen Campbell audio/visual item, this is definitely the one.",1504828800,13,413,4.447368421052632
639996,5,6303425437,"Not what I was expecting, but well worth the purchase. If your a (even) a casual fan, there's a good likely hood you will be come a true fan. This cat can sing! ... way beyond country.  Thank you Glen for being a man way beyond your time.",1504828800,11,238,3.9583333333333335
639997,5,6303425437,"Glen is in great voice here, has a great 70's hairdoo, very good back-up singers, and an excellent full orchestra behind him here. Why the box cover has him with black hair instead his normal blonde hair I don't know. This is/was a great show and is a joy to watch.",1332806400,7,265,4.215686274509804

7845941,5,6303425437,"Glen Campbell was a fantastic live performer and this DVD/CD combo is excellent.  The DVD contains 23 concert performances plus a ton of bonus features:  19 videos of duets from the Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour with people such as Jimmy Webb, Helen Reddy, Seals and Crofts, David Gates, 8 videos of instrumentals featuring Glen's fantastic guitar playing, and 3 bonus performances.  Plus a 22 song CD of Glen in concert in 1990  Quality of the DVD is great considering that some of these are from the mid 1970s.  The concert CD is excellent. If you're a Glen Campbell fan you need this!",1518912000,2,585,4.696078431372549
