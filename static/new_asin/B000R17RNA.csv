8198304,3,B000R17RNA,"BCI's LEGENDS OF HOLLYWOOD - JOHN WAYNE consists of a half-dozen flip discs of unrestored public domain material. A collection of 32 Duke Wayne film trailers is scattered among the first five discs. The 75-year old programmers that comprise the bulk of this pack aren't studio-quality dubs but they're certainly worth the private seller asking price.

THE HURRICANE EXPRESS that's presented here is the 77 minute movie that decades ago was carved out of what originally was a 4 hour, 12 chapter serial. Granted, a lot of that was redundant recap openers, yet it's undeniable that nearly two hours of story was excised. Transfer is probably from a 16mm boadcast film.

As for the two in-color bonus movies, ""Sundowners"" is a bit boring, despite a decent cast. ""One-Eyed Jacks"" was the only picture that Brando directed. It's quite decent.
