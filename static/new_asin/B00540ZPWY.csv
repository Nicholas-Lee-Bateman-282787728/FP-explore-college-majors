8456065,4,B00540ZPWY,"A fun concept piece that asks seventy unrelated Irish women to describe the most important man at that particular moment of their lives. With subjects that reach across every lifestyle, age and demeanor, the tone and context of every two-minute conversation varies wildly. Bubbly younger girls describe their fathers as everything from herculean supermen to strict, chore-demanding slave drivers. Teens vary their focus from their dads to the flirts and love interests of adolescence. Young adults begin to yearn for longer-term relationships, thirty-somethings discuss their kids and older women touch on the rigors of rut-riding and, eventually, crippling loss. I found the ambitious, carefully-arranged cinematography to be every bit as interesting as the variety of faces and their tales. In a way, it's a talking picture book; a photo essay on the slow, inevitable evolution of a thorough life. Though we don't spend long with any subject, that doesn't stop their stories from connecting in a very real, emotional way.",1335744000,,1023,5.4
