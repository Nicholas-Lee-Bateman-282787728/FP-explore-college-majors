2542445,1,B000EWC566,About 5 minutes on the actual Dead Sea Scrolls and the rest a bunch of babble...............TERRIBLE!!  Don't waste your time or money.,1360454400,5,135,5.136363636363637
2542446,1,B000EWC566,"I thought the first part was a preview of what was on the disk.
It was not. It was not the whole story or part of the story,
It was about putting the pices back together. What a ripoff.
I'm glad I bought this used and only spent a little money, otherwise
I would be very upset.",1340409600,8,277,3.8771929824561404
2542447,3,B000EWC566,"The video consists of three segements; one of the dead sea scrolls, another about hebrew language pictograms which was interesting, and another about the history and development of the bible.  It was interesting and informative.  There was some speculative content, but not to mind bending. It was worth the time. [...]",1321747200,3,319,5.235294117647059
2542448,1,B000EWC566,"First, about 10 percent of this video actually discusses the Dead Sea Scrolls (the first part done by Joel Lampe).  And that part only discusses the historical / archeological context they were found in, and the difficulty of putting the pieces of the manuscript back together.  It DOES NOT discuss the content of the Scrolls at all.  The rest of the video has absolutely nothing  to do with the Dead Seas Scrolls at all.

Second, if you think this is an educational / academic presentation, you will be sadly disappointed, as I was.  The right wing Christian bias / proselytizing comes out very loud and clear.  My jaw dropped when he described the Muslims as ""that phony godless monster religion"". Objectivity does not exist in this presentation.  He describes himself as a Doctor of Genetics, and then goes on to share his kooky theory that a comet passing by the earth created the Black Plague. I googled the guy, and apparently he is the owner of  The Bible Museum, Inc., in Arizona, and is the ""International Director of the World Bible Society"".  He does not appear to have any ties with any academic institutions. In the video, amateurishly shot in a classroom of sorts, he keeps referring to the `museum"", in which I guess the video was shot.  The audience appears to be primarily retired elderly folks, who must have gotten off some tour bus.  The overall tone of the speakers is angry, self righteous and condescending.

The video is released by New Liberty Videos, which I also googled.  They have released several other videos with Dr. Lampe's opinions and proselytizing, along with some other kooky titles like The UFO Conspiracy, which ""reveals how Christians should view the growing evidence of UFO sightings, face-to-face encounters, and alleged abductions."" I am a fan of educational videos, from such companies as PBS, BBC, National Geographic, the History Channel, A&E, and was expecting something of that nature from this video.  Sadly, all I got was poor pseudo-scholarship, anti-Catholic, anti-Muslim bigotry, and very little information about the Dead Sea Scrolls.  Save your precious money, and even more importantly, your precious time, by not wasting it on this.",1231804800,28,2189,4.988980716253444
2542449,4,B000EWC566,This was a short but interesting video. Could have been longer as it covered 3 different subjects.,1227571200,4,98,4.823529411764706
8115086,1,B000EWC566,"I found the short portion on reading Hebrew interesting. Then suddenly there is a half-wit spewing his anti-Islam nastiness. In Genesis we are told that God created man ""in our image"". That implies that God is Sumerian. Doesn't it? Regardless, if you believe in the Judgement are you going to stand before God and admit that you hated his creation because his skin wasn't the same color, or he didn't follow YOUR bible? What if all the angels are Sumerian? Is God going to replace them with you because your skin is the correct color?
Consider this: what if this life is a test to see how we coexist with God's other creations in the cosmos? If you cannot tolerate your brother because his education was different, or his skin is not the same color, how will you deal with it if he has scales or fur, or perhaps eyes on protruding stalks?",1524268800,,838,4.483660130718954
8115087,1,B000EWC566,"The title of this ""documentary"" is Mysteries of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The first, oh, ten minutes or so are actually about the Dead Sea Scrolls. This short piece provides some decent general background into the subject.

The second section veers off into the Hebrew language. It was interesting, though not terribly well connected to the subject matter. I didn't mind it too much as I figured it would eventually get back on subject.

Nope.

This is not a documentary. It's a rubbish sermon series written by people who have little if any interest in the subject of the scrolls themselves and just want to convince you to convert. The geneticist at the end actually comes across as an extremely hateful and prejudiced person. Makes me wonder how much he knows about the Jesus he claims to worship.",1517616000,2,796,4.753623188405797
8115088,2,B000EWC566,"Sucks you in with the title. and gives some back ground, and makes a reasonable guess about why the scrolls where forgoten  Then the topic changes to how ancient Hebrew is an easy read.
Then the crack pot shows up with conspiracy theories. A geneticist that thinks bubonic plague came from asteroid dust.  I just laughed and stopped",1514246400,,332,4.706896551724138
8115089,1,B000EWC566,"I would avoid this work if you are anything but a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.  The presentation on the Dead Sea Scrolls is actually pretty good.  However, things get weird when those on the program start bashing Islam and Catholicism.  So other than the introductory lecture this is either boring and not informative or old-time bigotry.  If boring and bigotry interest you, have at it.  I'm frankly offended that Amazon promotes hate-speech.",1513900800,,444,5.197183098591549
8115090,4,B000EWC566,"Especially enjoyed the first segment. The second was great as well. The third... not as much. But, it's all good.",1487635200,,113,4.7
