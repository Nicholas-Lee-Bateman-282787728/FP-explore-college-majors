Chuck Connors is Lucas McCain, nicknamed The Rifleman, for his lighting quick shooting skills with a Winchester.  A widower, he lives on a small ranch outside of the town of North Fork, New Mexico, with his son Mark (Johnny Crawford).  His good friend is town Marshal, Micah Torrance (Paul Fix).  This is the sixth collection of their adventures.  Here are summaries and/or comments for the episodes in this set.  Episode ratings are on a scale from one to five (best).
The Indian: (3)
Viewing vintage TV programs can provide insight and perspective into attitudes and prevalent in the past.  Particularly when dealing with controversial issues.  This is the case with this episode, which features Michael Ansara, as an Indian who is also a federal marshal.  The townsfolk get in an uproar, and refuse to recognize the authority of an Indian lawman, especially one determined to arrest a white man.  We have made some progress in the area of race relations, but can still learn something from the prejudice and racism exhibited.  McCains wild antics at the end, do seem a bit over dramatic.
Lariat: (3)
Richard Anderson guests as Lariat Jones, an old friend of Lucas McCain.  Lariat goes into business with an unscrupulous partner, opening a saloon and gambling house in North Fork.  McCain is concerned about his old friend, and the unsavory characters he has chosen to associate with.  Will the house run a clean game?
Mail Order Groom (3):
John Jupiter (Peter Whitney) has come to town, all the way from Ohio, to meet and hopefully marry, Isabel, an old maid, who advertised for a husband.  Unfortunately, Jupiter is immediately harassed, by two local scum, with a bone to pick with Isabel.  The good-natured Jupiter, is a hulk of a man, pushed beyond his limits.  Lucas steps in, to keep things from going too far, and see that love has a fair chance to grow.
The Martinet (2):
With the Rifleman, you expect morality to be black and white, but sometimes things gets a bit too melodramatic.  That seems to be the case here, where John Hoyt plays an angry army officer, looking to avenge the death of his son.  The boy, was a victim of Lucas McCains Winchester, killed when he challenged him to a fight.  Bent on revenge, the father won't quit until he makes McCain pay.  This one manipulates, and ends very conveniently.
Miss Bertie (2):
Agnes Moorehead, guests as Miss Bertie, a woman who specializes in collecting the reward on outlaws.  Richard Anderson, plays Duke Jennings, a killer with a price on his head, and he is Miss Berties prey.  This episode plays things very cute, as we are asked to accept the premise of a spunky old lady, taking on an armed killer.  Apparently Richard Anderson has trouble believing it too.  Check his expression when he is arrested.  Wounded, yet hes almost grinning when Miss Bertie comes with handcuffs.  Yes, this episode is mostly for laughs.  Also selecting a second episode with Anderson as the guest star, is a questionable editorial choice.
Volume 6 features episodes where the focus of the stories shifts a bit from the isolated life on the farm, and we find Lucas and Mark, interacting more with the townsfolk of North Fork.  Many of the conflicts and confrontations are not directly with McCain, but with others he knows.  This helps to keep the body count down, and we see a cooler, more in control Rifleman.  The episodes are just average, and without Lucass fiery emotion, they lack an edge.  Probably only for the serious fans of the series, and it doesnt look like there are too many of them out there.  This DVD is also part of the four DVD Rifleman Boxed Collection 2, which contains Volumes 5 through 8.
