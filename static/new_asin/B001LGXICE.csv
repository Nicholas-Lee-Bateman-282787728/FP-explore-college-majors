8318062,4,B001LGXICE,"Very interesting review.  It includes a brief explanation on the traditional celebration, history and many images of altars (a bit of them from Michoacan, as could be expected); very inspiring!  It is also included step-by-step instructions to make an altar and how to prepare mole and pan de muerto.  Video quality is not bad, but it could be better.  Good work indexing and having both Spanish and English versions.",1287878400,5,417,5.0
