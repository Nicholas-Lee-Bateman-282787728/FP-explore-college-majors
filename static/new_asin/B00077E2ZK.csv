8045534,5,B00077E2ZK,"About 6 months ago, I accidentally stumbled across this film (already in progress) on some ""learning"" channel.  Fortunately, I caught most of the story and commited what I could to memory.  The following week, I searched to no avail, for the DVD of this amazing film.  I've just now found it on amazon after many earlier, failed attempts.

Oh my gosh, a new and completely plausible theory which makes total sense.  I can't wait to see the sequel.",1169337600,3,447,4.67948717948718
8045535,5,B00077E2ZK,"On the base of the last theories and scientific deductions, of which those of Yves Coppens (anthropologist, he is one of the co-discoverers of Lucy), film's co-author, and the use of the best technologies as regards 3D animations, 'A Species Odyssey' recalls, with care, the formidable evolution of the human race, from its animal origins to the man such as we know it today. This documentary of quality transports us million years ago, thanks to meticulous work of hundreds of people, one is touched by the images and the adventures of our ancestors. Simply amazing!!",1166400000,2,568,4.989473684210527
8045536,1,B00077E2ZK,"This series purports to portray the saga of human evolution from a science based perspective. Unfortunately the science behind it is all wrong. As a professional in this field I was astonished by the license the producers took with the known fossil record. One glearing mistake is to unequivocably state that two species of australopithecine, Austarlopithecus afarensis and Australopithecus anamensis co-existed and were competitors. This is not true, ""anamensis"" preceded ""afarensis"" in the fossil record and most anthropologists see it as the direct ancestor of ""afarensis."" The behavioral differences said to distinguish between the two are without any foundation and totally made up. The way bipedalism is depicted evolving is another myth and totally discredited by research over the last twenty years. I could go on and on about all the mistakes in these videos. These mistakes actually play into the hands of creationists and other critics of human evolutionary research. Also the reverential  and naive narrative come across as almost religious in tone, as if the producers were consciously trying to create a new secular  version of Genesis. The depiction of human ancestors also leaves  me cold. Some of the graphics are well done, but the way early humans are show moving around is very stilted and unrealistic. Again much of this series is totally fabricated and only vaguely reflective of what we really know about human evolution. A dramatic series of this sort could be done in a manner more consistent with what we really know.",1154908800,2,1543,5.213709677419355
8045537,5,B00077E2ZK,"I haven't seen this movie so I'm only giving it 5 stars because the other reviewer did.

However, this is a request to have her relay some more detailed information about the DVD if she can -- i.e., what language is it in? is it subtitled?  How long is it?  Can it be watched and understood and enjoyed if english language subtitles or dubbiing is not offered?  What are the bonus special features if there are any?  What about the sequal you mention?

Thanks.",1131148800,,460,4.416666666666667
