8503619,5,B006RMR41S,"If you are using Mr. Seeklander's system the video really does help you visualize exactly how to execute the drills properly.  If you are serious about, buy the DVD...the occasional user might not need this...good product none the less.",1468454400,,236,5.051282051282051
8503620,5,B006RMR41S,Mike is straight to the point and hides nothing. There are no short cuts to this video. If Mike comes up with more training videos I want them. The dry fire clip is particularly well illustrated. I have experienced a huge improvement by just doing what he does. Thank you !!!!,1400544000,,276,4.431372549019608
8503621,5,B006RMR41S,Seeklander is a great teacher and explains things in a way it makes sense to all. his progmatic approach delivers results. Primarely for serious shooters.,1393459200,,154,5.2
8503622,5,B006RMR41S,"If you shoot IPSC or IDPA and want to move up in class, this is the set of instructional manuals you need. I bought both books and both DVD's. In about six months I moved up from having been an IDPA sharpshooter and USPSA/IPSC C class shooter for years to Expert in three IDPA divisions and B class in USPSA Limited division. The DVD's are less of a necessity than the books if your budget is tight. But they do illustrate things well and might clear some points that less experienced shooters wouldn't get just from reading the book.",1385596800,,534,4.404040404040404
8503623,5,B006RMR41S,"Good book,  great for shooters that want to learn more.  One thing better and I do suggest it take a class",1355011200,,106,4.0
8503624,5,B006RMR41S,"The book and DVD are very well done, the training steps are simple and clear. I needed to have something to refer to when I go to the range. I usually end up simply shooting bulls eye, and that is good, but soon becomes old news. I shoot IDPA and found this program very intuitive and helpful. This is very reasonably priced and worth every penny!!

Happy shooting!",1350259200,,365,4.367647058823529
