2811845,5,B000P6R5L6,"This AMG Season 2 Vol. 2 is a boxset. That means your Amazon package contains a DVD (as usual) and a hardboard AMG box as a plus item. You may noticed that this DVD costs more about $9 than other AMG DVDs. Yes, that $9 is the price for the box, I guess.

There is also a plus feature of this disc. Two English voice actresses (Belldandy and peorth) recorded a commentary. You can listen it by selecting audio 3. By the way, the English voice actress of peorth was acting Belldandy's in Oh! My Goddess (OVA) series.

Yet, as everybody agrees, the best way to enjoy the show is its Japanese original recording. As for the original voice actresses, Hasegawa's voice actres has change since Season 2 Vol. 1. Anybody noticed that? All other versions (OMG-OVA, AMG-Movie, AMG-Season1) are recorded by the same voice actress for Hasegawa.

This is not about this volume, but Belldandy's voice has once been recorded by other person than Inoue Kikuko. AMG-Adventures of Mini Goddess Vol. 1 Gan-Chan File is that one. Inoue Kikuko was in the maternity leave at that time, so she skipped for that volume and came back from Mini Goddess Vol. 2 and ever since.

To be honest, the story telling of this volume is a bit behind, comparing with other volumes of AMG Season 1 and 2. Hope that things are going to be better for volume 3.",1184284800,3,1319,4.506276150627615
2811846,5,B000P6R5L6,"Now that Keichii and Belldandy have pretty much staked their respective claims on each other hearts, you would think things would start settling down.....NOT!!!  Love is in the air and more heavenly bodies are in the future.  First up is Guy Otaki(the thin, blond counterpart to the auto club president), who falls for a beautiful first year by the name of Satoko.  When he saves her from playboy Aoshima, he asks Kei and Bell for more help for a date.  Then Kei gets his first love letter from a young spiritualist by the name of Shiho who thinks that he is surrounded by evil spirits.  Bell starts to show a more human side in this one because she has never felt things like loss or jealousy, much to the dismay of a hellhound that Shiho accidentally summoned. Then the body count goes up a notch when, while making a call to Megumi, Keichii once again connects to Heaven to the Earth Support Line and summons Peorth (Pee-orth), the Fourth Goddess.  Now Peorth (who dresses like an Al-Bhed from Final Fantasy X) is a direct rival to Belldandy and is going to try to do anything in her power to get Kei's wish, including seducing him.  Then a real free for all starts up when all four goddess decide to do nice things for Keichii,which somehow drags in the rest of the group and of course creates even more of a mess (big surprise there :-P)

Once again the goddess squad has not disappointed, with entertaining dialouge, a bit of fan service, and a good supply of explosions.  And we have not EVEN gotten to the fact the Hild is right around the corner (for those who do not know.....you have to wait until next time).  Until next disc.......",1184198400,2,1644,4.4865771812080535
2811847,5,B000P6R5L6,"That is the central theme of this disc and (gasp! shock!) this includes Belldandy. Before I start my review, my recommendation would be to watch the first disc. That way you can have a better understanding of the relationships between the characters. I will break down my review by episodes that are on the disc. Also, I will try not to give away too much of the story (AKA Spoilers) Now onto the review:

Episode 5:
Otaki (second in command of autoclub) fixes Satoko Yamano scooter much to the dismay of Aoshima (rich-boy). Sparks fly between the two (Otaki and Satoko) and after some convincing from Keiichi and Belldandy, they go to the amusement park on a date. Unfortunately for the two lovebirds, Aoshima owns this place and (you guessed it) when he sees his potential girlfriend (oxymoron if he is a playa) having a good time, he decides to try and ruin the date

Episode 6:
Keiichi for the first time receives a love letter, or so he thinks, from the young exorcist apprentice Shiho Sakakibara from his school. Shiho senses non-human psychic waves coming from Keiichi which she mistakes to evil spirits. Yet she gets too close to Keiichi at times and Belldandy begins to experience the darker side of her emotions. Now up to this point, Belldandy has been suppressing her jealous side/emotion. And if you know the power of being a Goddess (considering Belldandy is very high ranking), lets just say that Shiho is end for a rude awakening and Keiichi realizes that despite Belldandy's Goddess Status, she is still a woman and needs one thing from the man she loves: appreciation.

Episode 7:
Enter a new character, Peorth, who happens to work for the Earth Support Office. This is a direct rival of Goddess Relief Office, who Belldandy works for. Somehow, once again, Keiichi dials up to heaven and gets in contact with Earth Support Office and enter Peorth (I think I speak for all the guys when I say this: I want Keiichi's luck). Peorth basically tells Keiichi the same thing that Belldandy told him, the only trouble is, Keiichi already as what he wants in Belldandy.  Trouble being, Peorth isn't hearing that and decides to ""force"" Keiichi to make a wish...it doesn't happen

Episode 8:
Peorth is overstaying her welcome as she meddles more in Keiichi's life. After Urd talks to Peorth about the relationship between Keiichi and Belldandy, Peorth does a little investigating of her own and decides to see if she can appeal to Keiichi carnal instincts (look up sex) and like any guy, he has them. Thus, Peorth issues a challenge to the other Goddesses to see if they can make Keiichi ""desires"" come true. Peorth and Belldandy have history (it's hinted at) and from I can tell, it isn't good.

Overall, I would say that this disc shows Belldandy acting more like a human then a goddess in that she does have a darker side to her. Word of advice: even though a woman may be your best friend, she can also be your worst enemy.",1184198400,,2934,4.665377176015474

Thank You",1418169600,,123,5.526315789473684
8189188,5,B000P6R5L6,"I love Ah My Goddess!!! although I though the second season wasn't quite as good but , I think that's mostly due to my preference of the storyline of the first season over the second ,although they seem to make up for that with the addition of peorth....and episodes like the one finally showing skulds angel.

If you haven't watched the series yet you should...I personally do not like romance but this way its done in ah my goddess its not shoved down your through and the jokes had me laughing...although the story is different the anime Midori Days reminds me of ah my goddess ,[although Ah My Goddess is better] ,in the way they approach romance.. its very sweet and refreshing ,balanced out  by the many comedic acts of the characters.

As for the box I really love it , that clear feather covered slip is amazing and really makes this box in my eyes... totally fits the series.",1413417600,,884,4.5125

8189190,4,B000P6R5L6,"I've collected the manga series and have the first season of Ah(or Oh) My Goddess.  The second season seems to start off a bit slower or a little awkward I find.  It improved further into the season.

I enjoy this series because it's never really too serious and it's entertaining.  I like the characters as well as how they are drawn.",1201910400,,335,4.442622950819672
8189191,5,B000P6R5L6,"There is no peace in the Morisato household this time, but there's also a whole lot of fun. First, a mysterious stranger sends Keiichi a love note, but is she sincere, or after something else. Then one of the seniors in the auto club does a good deed, and gets a chance at the perfect girlfriend, if he can keep Toshiyuki away from her. And, just when you think Keeichi has earned a break, he gets a phone number wrong, and ends up with another goddess!
Needless to say, there's never a dull moment in this story. Personally though, I wouldn't have it any other way. If you're new to this story, you might be able to start with season 2 #1. If you've followed this story all along, don't you dare miss this one.",1196467200,,711,4.274074074074074
8189192,5,B000P6R5L6,"First off I love this series it makes a bad day better instantly. some people really don't like the lovey dovey anime that comes out but this one is special If you haven't watched the OVA or the first season of this version go back now and watch it I garentee you'll fall in love with Belldandy. its tough to wait for the next version to come out on this series so I see each episode and even read the manga numorus times before I get to the next ;-)
anyway this is one of the better volumes it shows More character depth. You get to see a side to our beloved bell that we haven't scene before I was a little shocked in the first Volume of the second season when bell yelled and used her magic LOL I don't want to give anything away cause the other reviewers on here have given very good detail of the show already. check it out I garentee you'll enjoy it.",1195084800,,856,4.071005917159764

8189194,5,B000P6R5L6,"There's already a decent review for the episodes, so I'll share my thoughts with some other things regarding this release.

The artbox is similar to the season 1 box in how it opens up (you may have to be careful in holding it because of this design). It has a red color theme, as one can see, and looks nice next to the first boxset. Adorning the box is very high-quality  art of all the major characters and the new characters present in this volume. This level of art is worth the extra $ the box costs, if you ask me. Also, I don't know if it's just my box, but there's a very small amount of adhesive that holds the top and bottom part of the box together. The season 1 box didn't have this.

The DVD case inside has a picture of Urd looking seductive (her usual look), as well as her angel summon-thing behind her in a pose that's showing off her chest. This art is also high quality and very...attractive. The back of the case has a layout similar to previous volumes, with some nice looking pictures of Peorth, the character introduced in this volume.
My gripe with this DVD (as well as the previous, volume 1) is that there is simply nothing inside the DVD case other than the disc and no reversible cover. Many other collections I have include DVD cases with reversible cover art, little booklets or foldouts. Since this volume included the artbox, I wanted more, like the phonestrap you get with the season 1 artbox.
It seems like this season of Ah! My Goddess has some barebones packaging. If it wasn't for the gorgeous cover art, I'd be really disappointed. I hope the future releases come with more inside than just the DVD.

P.S. It's the same size as the first season boxset and the same design, too (the way it opens and the plastic slipcover).",1188259200,,1761,4.409230769230769
8189195,5,B000P6R5L6,"The DVD arrived in excellent condition. It was well pack, and arrived in pristine condition. It played perfectly. i am 100% satisfied with the seller, and would happily buy from him again.",1186531200,,188,4.90625
8189196,5,B000P6R5L6,"Another great series from the Ah! My Goddess group, And the box is just as impresive as the Media Blasters version. Well worth the time and money!",1186272000,,146,4.444444444444445
