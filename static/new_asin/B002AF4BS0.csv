3883983,4,B002AF4BS0,"ICHI THE BLIND SWORDSWOMAN (2009)  is a redux of Zatoichi, the Blind Swordsman; the classic Jidai Geki TV series. Directed by Fumihiko Sori, (Vexille, ""Ping Pong""), with screenplay by Shimosawa Kan; this film switches the gender of the lead character, has significant improvements but it also lacks some of the original's strengths. ""Ichi"" stars beautiful Japanese bikini model/actress Ayase Haruka, and this is her follow up role to ""Cyborg She"" (which I will review later). The film is a departure from the stylistic style of Kitamura's ""AZUMI"" and is a welcome return for director Sori to his action roots after the fun-filled ""Ping Pong"".

Ichi (Haruka Ayase) is a beautiful, blind musician who travels this Edo period Japan with her traditional Japanese guitar and a walking stick--well, a walking stick at first impression, but inside, she hides a razor sharp katana. Ichi may be blind, but she is also a skilled swordswoman. In her quest to find the man who helped bring her up, she comes across swindlers, rapists, gangsters who want to take advantage of her disability. Ichi fights back with her remarkable sword fighting skills. Sometime during her travels, she meets up with a cowardly, dishonored samurai named Touma (Takao Osawa, Aragami) who she ends up saving from angry gamblers affiliated with the Banki Gang. The pair unwittingly become entangled in a turf war between the Shirakawa and Banki clans battling for supremacy in a small inn town of Bitou. Ichi may find the answers she is looking for in the person of the leader (played by Shido Nakamura) of the Banki group of cutthroats--and the resolution of the conflict may reveal the fate of the man she is looking for.

""Ichi"" is a film that is very commercial in its appeal. It has the charm to attract the younger generation as well as samurai aficionados, as well as electrify the male testosterone because of Haruka Ayase. This actress is beautiful, and although she barely wears any make up, and this role has wearing rags, her close ups are enough to add excitement and you can tell that she has a  model-like statuesque figure. Ayase became well acclimated to the action genre after ""Cyborg She"" and she does have the presence that can grab attention.

The film may have the somewhat stereotypical themes of redemption, revenge and compassion as is quite familiar with jidai geki films, and I don't deny that the film has certain weaknesses in its premise. I don't mind stereotypical storylines, but film feels a little routine. Ichi was brought up by a Goze group of blind performers and she was exiled when she was sexually abused. The Goze faction of musicians are an odd lot, their rules are certainly fleshed out but I was left asking for the reasons as to why such rules would apply. Yes, ""Ichi"" does have a lot of emotions going for it, and her links to a certain blind swordsman does manage to entice our attention. The problem is, the film is filled with over-the-top characters that threatens to overshadow its tone. Director Sori is responsible for such anime hits such as ""Vexille"" and ""Appleseed"", and you can see the costume designs by our villains look very anime-inspired. Also, the bumbling samurai played by Takao Osawa has his interesting qualities, I can buy his reasons for not wanting to use his sword but this fact overstays its welcome as there were times in the last act that I almost screamed ""Draw your sword, dammit!"" Of course there is a developing romance between Touma and Ichi, but the film doesn't develop this too much.

Well, does ""Ichi"" deliver in its action sequences? Yes and no. Yes, the fights are very cool to watch and they are quite kinetic in its execution. There are also a very good number of them, Ichi is on display as she quickly dispatches her assailants with quick thrusts and stabs, complete with very nice posturing, ""Ichi"" provides great eye candy. There are also a significant use of slow motion to display Ayase's moves--this would normally bother me, but I am willing to forgive its use this time around. Director Sori also doesn't make Ayase's character seem too invincible, Ichi does have her female vulnerabilities, as skilled as she is, she is a woman and has her limits. Ichi has a strong advantage when she fights in the dark, but may have more of a handicap when there are some loud noises. As for why I also said no, well, the fights may look cool, but they were lacking some credible impact in its narrative. The script hampers the action sequences, because while it does attempt to carry emotion, it doesn't feel climactic. I guess the set ups were also too simple and they can be very routine.

The cinematography is quite gorgeous, and accompanied by a somber, moody score, the film does manage to impress me in the way it plays each scene. The film's color palette leans towards the tone of Earth colors as with most jidai geki films and the atmosphere does resemble a Kurosawan samurai film, with the wind blowing dirt meant to signify a finale. The set designs are also good, they are very similar to Kitamura's ""Azumi"". Director Sori brought along his buddies responsible for ""Ping Pong"", Shido Nakamura and Yosuke Kunozuka performed well, but it just felt like a step backward when compared to their previous film together.

Ultimately, ""ICHI"" won't be one unforgettable jidai geki film, but the film does have its charm and the action scenes are good enough for ""hack and slash"" feature. Plus, there is the absolutely stunning Haruka Ayase who is just so damn attractive who roams around feudal Japan, slicing and dicing her way to her quest. The film closes in a manner that leaves it open for a sequel. Despite the film's flaws, I found it quite entertaining. Don't expect a film very faithful to its roots but just be along for the ride. This ""Zatoichi"" re-imagining will not make a dent on the classic status of Shintaro Katsu's original but thankfully it is a good enough diversion.

Video/Audio: 1.78 ratio anamorphic widescreen. Nice clean transfer. The film is sharp with restrained colors, favorable to earth colors. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is strong and powerful. The English Subtitles are good but sometimes they scroll too fast.",1260489600,15,6222,4.8164794007490634

It is NOT a low grade pinkie film like Ninja Chicks, (just to show of some cutie doing sword fights), but a more serious film.",1257379200,4,218,4.341463414634147
3883985,2,B002AF4BS0,"I thought I was going to be all for an attractive girl to step up to refresh the Zatoichi franchise and then I saw this.  The lead actress was a super weak representation of the series super bad sword slinger.  The action is weak, the direction is weak and the story is boring with a slow pace that did not hold my interest no matter how cute I thought the lead actress was, while watching this I found myself continuing to get up and do other things and I am a huge fan of this genre and have been for years.  I was extremely disappointed.",1256947200,6,540,4.123809523809523
3883986,4,B002AF4BS0,"Historical samurai dramas are the Japanese equivalent of the Western except that they still maintain their credibility. This is a reworking of the popular Zatoichi the blinds swordsman series, with a blind female musician trying to track down the person who may or may not be Zatoichi and who may or may not be her father.

I like the structure as more and more is revealed about the two main characters over the course of the film through the use of flashbacks which can, early on, sometimes be misleading. Toma, the samurai whom Ichi protects, at first appears to be nothing more than a coward but he is more than that and there are resonances which I don't want to spoil. The two leads are absolutely fine in their roles, the cute kid who helps Ichi is bearable, but the villains tend to be over the top. In particular the chief bad guy comes over like a psycho samurai Quentin Tarantino, whom he rather resembles.

It's attractively photographed with several striking snow scenes. There is a strong emotional content and lots of brooding silences, profundities, and deep thoughts -this is a samurai movie after all. There's even more blood, lashings and lashings of it as our heroine wades through the bad guys using her special backhanded slicing technique. The climax features even more blood and carnage with bad guys against good guys, hero against villain, heroine ag... ah, that would be telling.

I had a good time watching this. Sequel, please.
I have the UK edition. It's in Japanese with English subtitles. No extras apart from a trailer.",1256083200,49,1552,4.7835820895522385

Good spin off of a Woman that Zatoichi trained as a child, could be another series if they don't copy his other movies, but gave her her own life.  Still, I would be hesitant about buying again ... my opinion ... where do all the Manufacturers defective DVD's go, they know what batch is proscessed bad and must make some money, So.......",1251244800,,464,4.395348837209302
3883988,5,B002AF4BS0,"i'm a big fan of zatoichi. i love that goofy blind guy with a sword made of lightning. it was, then, with a mix of pleasure and concern that i greeted my brand spanking new dvd copy of the movie ichi, a film by fumihiko sori and starring haruka ayase as ichi - seemingly zatoichi's daughter (though this is an inferred mystery).

of course, not just a fan of sword-driven dramas in general, i'm a huge fan of those with female protagonists. i don't really know why, as i'm not very fond of ""obligatory"" female protagonists. the movie version of azumi is an example of a movie i was torn between liking and not. on one hand it had a decent idea, and on the other hand the portrayal wasn't as hardcore as she could have been, and i think too much attention was paid to her outfit than getting her moves right. that said, the final scenes were much better than the opening, and after watching the doco of the film, i was left feeling more respect for what they attempted to create more than what was seen.

ichi, however, not only nails it on the head, but punches the nail right the way through the torso and impales the feet. there's not a single moment in this film you feel you're watching a female actress gratuitously swinging her sword around while flashing as much skin as possible. in actuality, there's not much flashing at all. delightfully, sori took the movie very seriously - possibly due to the vast history left by shintaro katsu - and presented ayase in a more appropriate manner. fumiko sori indeed seems to understand the concept of character.

the action sequences are tight. really tight. they capture her movement and reveal no weakness or hesitation on the actress or actor's parts. there's a mature use of special effects and editing to give a heightened sense of power and confidence to ichi's movements that really did justice to the zatoichi legacy - considering actors and actresses these days are hardly trained swordsmen. the blood effects, treated to a documentary on my copy of the dvd, were very nice and when you see some of the cgi they use, you blink twice because i know two of the scenes i never even noticed were entirely cgi. brilliant work.

i was also pleased with ayase's portrayal of ichi. she managed to capture many of zatoichi's mannerisms and the end of the film where she begins walking off, her smile hints at the clown beneath and made me think very fondly of katsu's inimitable performance. i truly hope there's a sequel which lets her let that smile out and playfully toy with the whole character as katsu had done. that said, this is an introduction film, it feels, and you do understand ichi's character by the end as you unwrap her cold silence and reveal the pain she has suffered and soon overcomes.

the scene by the lake where everything just explodes from her is an awesome one, as all the pent-up rage and frustration just bursts out. it was a truly outstanding performance from ayase and due entirely to her performance i was absolutely more impressed and amazed than i thought i would be.

yet, it wasn't just asaye who performed well. the rest of the cast was simply stellar. ysuke kubozuka, for example, was chillingly good. he has an expression on his young face which belies his age. i really felt he was world-weary and tired as the local yakuza boss' son tired of being pushed around and fatalistic by the end. he was strong, commanding, and genuine. takao osawa, playing a psychologically damaged samurai and romantic interest, was equally as good, tugging at his sword and you could feel his frustration at himself, particularly in the final battle scene. he played his part well, and what could have been a cheesy interlude became more palatable. shido nakamura has a strong presence as the badguy, banki, but i wasn't overly convinced by him as evil incarnate or worth the effort thrown at him. however, he did his job well and despite looking like he'd found his gang on a mad max set, it was worth the price of admission.

when all is said and done, ichi is a beautiful film, and one which strongly holds true to the legacy of the zatoichi films, more so than ""beat"" takeshi's film - which i liked but thought needed less art and more zatoichi if you know what i mean. colour me a purist, or anal, or something.

i recommend this film thoroughly and without hesitation. if for nothing else than for the way she sheaths her sword - uber-slow, just like shintaro katsu. very very nice. i had a warm fuzzy feeling each time she fought as if i was seeing shintaro katsu's ghost.

long live ichi. may (s)he blindly dish that sword-driven justice out to the badguys who need it most.",1246665600,,4650,4.565947242206235

Haruka Ayase is awesome as the blind swordswoman.

The movie is a sort of amalgam of the many stories in the TV series, all of the events and characters were in at least one of the Zatoichi episodes. The only thing that is different is that Ichi is a young woman and has a different motivation and personality than Shintaro's character.  The actor who plays the villain really chews the scenery, but doesn't distract you too much. Miss Haruka plays Ichi quite well and is a very good actress.",1457222400,2,600,4.495412844036697

The acting was great, fight scenes were okay,  but what I really enjoyed was the depth of emotion and honesty of the whole story. Even with sword action, it wasn't just continuous fighting but moments where you could sit and sink into the film.

The only down side was that fighting was somewhat not believable and the story was good based on a good concept with the exception that perhaps all the problems could have been solved in ways other than cutting someone.

It was the only part of the film that wasn't very realistic, in reality it could have been... no wait, we do kind of solve things that way in real life too, nevermind, it was realistic. :)",1425081600,,804,4.412162162162162

It lacks the humour and the irony and the sub- messages of the original series and the film.  Ichi is a blind lone swordsman who gets in trouble because of a certain innate sense of justice,  or balance , that guides his action even though he is a yakuza,  an outlaw . That sense of justice made him heroic albeit a trgic figure.  In the film the heroine is just tragic and pathetic.  Her sole aim is to meet whoever killed her father so that she can avenge his murder.  When it is revealed that the father died,  just died and there was no killing the film tries to change thema  and become a tale of redemption and love ......it fails to inspire,  it fails to make sense.

3884042,4,B002AF4BS0,"I am thrilled to say that over all I loved this film. Its one of the best samurai movies I have seen. Members here should honestly try to avoid searching for one singular weakness in a film and then judging it thereby only on the merits of that weakness. In the case of this film its clear that the dubbed english voices make it difficult to take this film seriously. The dubbing leaves a great deal to be desired. But one must look beyond this and consider every aspect of the film. I did just that and understand that the dubbing is really its only weakness. Of course the impact of the film is greatly effected by it. But I honestly feel there are some operatic and beautiful moments in this film none the less. I was very pleased to discover that Lisa Gerrard created the music for this film. Her work seems a bit lackluster in portions of the movie, but some of her work here is simply beautiful and touching, especially as the film progresses. Lisa began her career as the front member of the 4AD band Dead Can Dance, She has provided music and voices for many films since, including doing compositions for Ridley Scotts Gladiator for which I believe she won an oscar, or was at least nominated. If you can look beyond the poor dubbing you might agree that this movie has some wonderfully glorious epic moments that take it nearly into oscar territory. I think the film is nearly a masterpiece that is unfortunately shrouded in the dust of poor voice dubbing. But everything beyond that is fantastic at times. Even the sound effects and so fourth are done fairly good. I really would love to see this in its original japanese language print, because I think it deserves to be seen as the director intended rather than with silly sounding actors trying to add voice tracks to an otherwise way above average Japanese movie and nearly ruining the lush beauty of it.",1367712000,,1868,4.513274336283186

The story is very progressive as you gather bits an peices an you learn of her tragic story as it unfolds, she comes across characters like Toma who at first impression comes on as aloof but has similiar connections with ichi that makes you root for him later on in the story an a cute kid that has a sensible heart for Ichi makes it gratifying.

The movie goes through several agonizing sequences in which the audience is forced to share the frustration of the expert swordsman who cannot draw his sword, therefore, has everyone around him killed by the enemies.

I only wished they killed that loser expert swordsman first. But to no avail. He is the last one alive and he still cannot draw his sword for the life of him until the very end.

Goodness, I was tortured.

I hated the expert swordsman, and I think he is the most retarded character in the history of samurai movies. I hated this movie.

The one actor who should have made the the film go forward smoothly and with interest, was the young instructor swordman. But that was not to be, the director did not control his over acting, when he needed to draw his sword, this was a very sour note. The reviewers ""S. Sun"" and ""Donald A.

3884056,4,B002AF4BS0,"I saw this movie on a flight to Asia. Hollywood's stuff didn't appealed to me, and I was looking for a foreign film for a change in style and presentation. I did not immediately recognize that the opening scene of the blind heroine stumbling in a fierce snow storm was going to carry on the role of Zatoichi.

There are certain elements to the film that are recognizably legacy of the old Zatoichi films. Such as: the unwitting coming to the rescue of a village being bullied by a group of ronins and bandits; super keen hearing that compensated for lack of vision; the lightening fast back hand slash of her sword and of course the deadly blade sheathed in a walking stick.

But this film carried certain twists of complexity because of a cast characters bearing assorted psychological scars. Ichi was frail, timid and had distinctly suffered from low esteem because of abuses heaped on her due to her blindness. Toma who came to her aid also suffered from questionable manhood--he couldn't draw on his sword if his life depended on it, all because of his relationship with his mother. The bad guy, the gansgster leader had suffered from a horribly disfigured face which got him nothing but scorn from the society. The rejection in turn caused him to seek revenge on the society through extreme cruelty.

Ichi's only friend was young boy. Though Ichi was herself quite young, she had already learned some bitter lessons of life and come to trust only children because their hearts have not yet been corrupted.

Zatoichi played a unheroic buffoon and was more proactive in coming the rescue of the underdog. Ichi was more guarded and reactive. The cinematography beautifully rendered the medival Japanese countryside, and the ending was typically Japanese and non-Western.

This is a highly entertaining film and deserves a bigger audience in the West.",1310515200,,1852,4.866666666666666
3884057,4,B002AF4BS0,"I saw this at my local video store and, being a totally huge fan of the original Zatoichi movies, decided to pick this up and give it a whirl. Now, I've picked up any number of modern Japanese/Asian action/sword movies over the years and would venture to say that really only a handful are actually watchable... unless you are REALLY, REALLY motivated to appreciate modern Japanese/Asian cinema for some reason.

That being said I wasn't expecting much, and frankly, I was going to be impressed with this movie if it actually made sense, and only slightly butchered the whole ""Zatoichi"" thing.

So needless to say I was super surprised to discover that not only was this a coherent flick - but it was actually, well....good.

Unlike the recent Beat Takeshi redux of the Zatoichi franchise this film doesn't make the mistake of messing with the original character by reinventing the way it's portrayed. Instead it tells a new story with a wholly new character, while utilizing the things that made the original movies so great. While the sometimes goofy, friendly, good natured, blind Gambler/Masseuse Who-Happens-To-Also-Be-An-Unstoppable-Badass, has been replaced by an introverted, female Who-Is-Only-Slightly-Badass-And-Has-An-Actual-Backstory...the connection to the original films is actually very strong. From the way the fight scenes are choreographed, to the way the story unfolds with a trademark gang of bad guys harassing some poor small village/inn. The best part about this movie is that it a lot of ways it ""feels"" like a Zatoichi movie, even though it's a very different take on the mythos.

The dialogue for this was probably poorly translated but ended up being not too bad for a Japanese action flick. The story made sense, and I found myself actually sort of caring what happened to these folks. Aside from a couple of the villains (one of whom, in addition to clearly being a white guy, is the spitting image of Conway Twitty) most of the cast is fairly believable. One of my favorite things is that the action sequences in this movie are paced in a way that's similar to the original films, but with that modern slow-mo flare that's just super-duper. I am going to go so far as to say that this film is a much better modern take on Zatoichi then it's more famous predecessor.

So if you're looking for a halfway decent samurai flick - this delivers. However, if you are a fan of the original series, then you're going to be presently surprised to find a very unconventional homage to the Zatoichi films that's a pleasure to watch.",1310342400,,2551,4.923255813953489

There are beautiful set pieces, locations and costumes and these are the real highlights of the film. It has to be said that this film doesn't have the best acting skills in it, but the direction more than makes up for this with some excellently framed shots. The close ups of various natural scenes (Japanese maple leaves and pond fish for example) are stunning in their simplicity. The fight scenes are well choreographed and whilst graphic in places they aren't as excessive as some other films I've seen or compared to the regular gore fest films that come out of Hollywood these days. The storyline is fairy engaging and kept me watching until the end, although I'm not sure how soon I'll be re-watching this film, it may be a one watch wonder.

3884063,5,B002AF4BS0,"I just saw this movie last night on European television (ARTE), with French sub-titles. My knowledge of Japanese cinema is sadly limited to Akira Kurosawa, and I had never heard the story of the blind swordsman everyone else is referring to. So perhaps my few modest words are for those who, like me, discovered this ""legendary tale"" with the film Ichi.

The story is beautifully told, and beautifully filmed as well. You really feel, during the whole (almost) two hours, you are in a different world, and this sharpens the senses into catching every glance, movement, stare and of course every element of body language... Haruka Ayase is breathtakingly beautiful -- delicate and yet showing remarkable inner strength from the very beginning. Not to mention her fascinating ability with her blade. The ""blackhearted"" Banki leader is almost a caricature of villainy and his Phantom-of-the-Opera style adds to his dark nature, making the ending all the more gripping.

I heartily recommend this film, and can tell you I enjoyed every minute of it. The flashbacks are cunningly done and do not confuse the viewer as they sometimes tend to do. Ichi's resilience, so well portrayed by Haruka Ayase, shines throughout the film and her image will stay with all of you lucky enough to see this extraordinary film!

(All 28 are offered at Amazon; this link hits only four).

The trick of feminizing the concept is a good idea. The swordplay action and art direction are superb. This adaptation of the Zatoichi concept just isn't as well-written as the original. I'm guessing that the stressing of humor in ZATOICHI gives viewers 'permission' to believe the over-the-edge swordplay; this version has no humor as far as I remember.

I'm keeping ICHI in my collection though. The nuances are interesting, the gender-flip too. But lacking the willingness to believe the amazing swordplay are possible detract from the acceptance of the premise. No, it's not gender-bias; I 'believe' Laura Croft's fabulous skills. Zena's too. This lady is demure, almost frail and, well, sweet. Blind, too. Then too, the plot/scripting is to a degree loose and sentimental. But that's really a subjective call.

I like to watch it in the original, and read the subtitles, which are clear and perfect, - 5 stars! They also don't take over the screen's view only if the dialogue is 2 lines. (Note, if you use ""Cinema"" mode on your tv, it will crop out the subtitles).

3884068,3,B002AF4BS0,"Ichi is one of those films that I've been meaning to tackle for some time. The look, the feel, the mood, and the mythological elements are all of undeniable Asian influence.  Yes there are undefeatable principles at play within that span beyond the swordplay and action elements in the foreground.  Before we look at the excellent philosophical tones of the picture, let's get the hard facts out of the way.

Coming in at a 120-minute runtime, Ichi consists of the full-length feature film on a single disc housed within a standard clamshell DVD case. The show wears an appropriate if not slightly conservative Restricted  rating due to violent imagery, swordplay, digital gore and a healthy dose of character-driven drama.

Language options are typical sub & dub meaning both the original Japanese vocal track is present as well the choice of an English dub (either presented in 5.1 Dolby Surround Sound) with the option of running English subtitles available with either vocal track.

The story, which has to be watched to be fully understood (or appreciated for that matter), goes something like this: Ichi, the female incarnation of the legendary blind swordsman Zatoichi, is herself a blind master of the blade and roams about town with her shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese guitar) in a mission to locate the man who helped raise her. Alone the way she happens upon no shortage of unsavory characters (rapists, thieves, and hustlers) looking to take advantage of her.
Ichi is no pushover, as the baddies soon discover in dramatic visual style, and defends herself with spectacular swordplay time and time again.  Shot in a blend of slow and regular motion segments, and with digital blood spurting wildly, the film is a testament to the charms of Asian cinema (and calls to mind some of Quentin Tarantino's frequent homage in films such as ""Kill Bill"").

As the prose develops, so too does the cast increase with Ichi herself gaining the companionship of a young male traveling partner despite the fact that she is by far the better sword wielder.  Haruka Ayase's performance as Ichi seems to depend heavily upon the viewer's expectations going into the film.  I found her to be convincing enough and somehow proud despite her attire of rags but it appears as though fans of Shintaro Katsu's original Japanese television incarnation of the mythos are quite divided on this casting choice.

Villains, as is par for the course in these situations, are a bit over the top in my opinion (Nakamura Shidou in particular).  However, while this may be a large detractor in an American big budget film, the Japanese have a habit of making the unbelievable believable through gritty ambiance and dialog that doesn't oversimplify character motivations.

Shooting locations and cinematography are particularly noteworthy for their massive scope and stunning vistas (particularly some of the snow segments, which can send a chill through even the most well-wrapped blanketed viewer).

The downside is that this simply isn't a piece of Asian cinema that will capture and hold the attention of the casual viewer.  The pacing and plotting often become a bit bogged down upon themselves with an excessive of moments of silent reflection, brooding sighs, and artistic framing.  For the most part this all works, but there will invariably be those a bit put-off by the pace fluctuations throughout (especially those viewers accustomed to the fast-cut American method of contemporary filmmaking).

The sound score is perhaps the biggest surprise with some really nice keys that go a long way in complementing the whimsical backgrounds.

In all, the picture works best when approached as a visually striking romp through a fairly historically accurate setting.  Digging too deeply into the mythos seems to reveal complaints in many forms and the cast is a bit too inconsistent to win over the masses.  Perhaps such complaints sound harsh, but the truth of the matter is that there is a lot of entertainment to be found here so long as you don't let expectations of grandeur bury it.",1261440000,38,4069,5.044776119402985
3884069,5,B002AF4BS0,"Blind babe swords and showgirl on the run is an odd thought and a great film. Production is aware of eastern and western elements. Like a Asian Spaghetti Eastern Western crossed with more 60s imagery. Sophisticated sense of humor with the proper gloss, grit and gore. Fantastic soundtrack includes Dead Can Dance's Lisa Gerrard. Good looking and sounding. Great Blu-ray",1261440000,4,369,5.166666666666667

8359363,4,B002AF4BS0,"This is a fun film, about a blind girl, who is an expert with the sword in combat, albeit there's a bit of overacting and cheesiness to it.  It also obviously doesn't have a high budget, with the main villain, supposedly so disfigured that if prostitutes or whoever see his face, they must die.  Then when we see him with a Phantom of the Opera mask he looks quite stupid, then at one stage without it, it looks like a pretty minor facial injury. Basically the plot revolves around a traveler (walking) who likes to play her guitar and rest up against the outside of dwellings. She doesn't need any of that pointless stuff like a room.  She of course is seen as an easy victim by rapists and criminals, but is anything but.  She saves the lives of idiotic locals and other travelers who get themselves into trouble with thugs who carry swords and are happy to murder. One of which is a so called samurai who is too cowardly to draw his sword, that trails her like a bad smell and takes praise and money from those who stumble upon the aftermath and assume he wielded the sword.

It's a fun movie, not something I'd probably ever watch twice.  The DVD is in Japanese obviously, with English subtitles. Set in an era where Japanese guys in their twenties shave part of their head to look like they have a severe receding hairline.",1498521600,,1328,4.422131147540983

8359366,4,B002AF4BS0,"It was very well acted, but very gory. Of course, that is the style of film, so I expected that going into it. It is nice to see a 3-dimensional blind character, who kicks butts and takes names, even if the premise is largely implausible. If you like the ""Zatoichi"" films, you'll probably like this. On a final note, I love the cheesy aspects of the film. They're delightful.",1493942400,5,375,4.449275362318841
