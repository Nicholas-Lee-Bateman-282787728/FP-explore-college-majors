7822507,5,6302172918,"this film was exciting showing how hardy's wife not only disliked Laurel but even envied him because she believed hardy gave laurel more attention than him.  I was funny how in this short""their first mistake"" stan called ollie and ollie called him mr.jones because his wife was there and stan thought ollie made a mistake and rang his bell telling him it was him and ollie's wife snapped and beat him up.  My favorite of these shorts was where the boys were dressed in drag playing their sisters and the wives were fighting at their first anniversary.  Hardy was married to stan's sister and stan was married to ollie's sis.",1378080000,,624,4.654545454545454

Brats. The boys play the parts of both the kids and the parents.
Twice Two. The boys play theirselves and their own sisters.
Their First Mistake. Ollie decides to adopt a baby to keep his wife happy, but she leaves him anyway, and he ropes Stan into helping
take care of the kid.
All 4 of these are good solid Laurel & Hardy short talking films, They will have you rolling on the floor with laughter.",1261872000,3,461,4.25
