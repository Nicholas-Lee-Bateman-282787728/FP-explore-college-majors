6530522,5,B00M0JU2C0,"Fantastic Family Movie!  I was just checking out different Christmas movies on amazon and found this.  I am so glad that I did.  I absolutely loved it.  I think everyone can relate to leaving home and off to the big city and realizing that it is not exactly where you need to be. Instead realizing that coming home to  the people that you love and whom care, support and love you no matter what. Thanks amazon for making these wonder movies available.",1415491200,22,451,4.451219512195122
6530523,5,B00M0JU2C0,Such a well written beautiful story. It is just the movie you want to watch during the holiday season.,1415145600,19,102,4.421052631578948
6530564,4,B00M0JU2C0,"This is a nice story, appropriate for all ages about a girl and her family struggling with family and fantail problems over Christmas. It has some lovely music in it, due to some of the characters being musicians. While I can say I probably won't be watching it again, it was pretty good in a field crowded with mediocre family-friendly Christmas films.",1481155200,,353,4.709677419354839
6530565,2,B00M0JU2C0,"Surprisingly decent cinematography and somewhat OK but also expectedly mediocre casting make me hate this film less than I expected. At about thirty minutes in, I hit ""pause"" so that I could go buy an egg sandwich. I was later disappointed to find that not only was my order made incorrectly, but there was also a large piece of eggshell left in the sandwich. For a good portion of this film, I was trying to pry eggshell out of my back molar(s). SPOILERS: if you decide to watch Evergreen, you'll have the following things to look forward to: 1) a cameo by tween heartthrob BooBoo Stewart of The Twilight Series fame, 2) multiple uncomfortable musical solos AND duets and, 3)  the opportunity to learn about a type of pestilence that affects the harvesting of christmas trees. Note: If I had watched the trailer beforehand, I probably wouldnt have chosen to watch this movie.",1479772800,2,876,4.7254901960784315

It is a sad movie, but really hits home and makes you think about values and priorities.

6530615,2,B00M0JU2C0,"With all the musical talent in this movie, why wasn't there any use of it. Like letting Naomi Judd and Charleene Closshey perform together and sing a nice Christmas song after all this was supposed to be a Christmas movie. Instead of having the ditsy boy friend from La sing karaoke. The story line focused a lot on the hair brained wantabe boy friend actor I guess trying to promote humor in a boring story line. One word for this movie is SAD.",1450051200,2,445,4.373493975903615
6530616,2,B00M0JU2C0,"A man drops dead in the middle of a Christmas tree farm.  Nothing says Merry Christmas like someone keeling over before the holidays!  His daughter (Charleene Closshey as Evie) rushes home with her dopey boyfriend in tow.  Her sad history is related in passing.  Shes now an orphan of sorts, her mother having deserted them in childhood.  She has a snotty little brother who pouts and writes lyrics.  In short order, several disjointed plot ploys are tumbled in and around the dilemma of how to keep the tree farm without sufficient funds.  Out of nowhere, they introduce an abused girl then jump to comic relief with the dopey boyfriend who is incredibly inappropriate about everything.  While they were at it, they barely introduced a crybaby rockstar and a creepy ex-schoolmate out to steal the farm!  This movie never stayed put long enough to deal with anything............and then along came the gypsy moths and an agriculture inspector!!!  I won't even mention the donkey named Jesus.

They couldn't decide if this should be a maudlin melodrama or a slapstick comedy so they went for a tepid romance instead.  Eh.

I didn't hate it............but.............I cant see putting myself through this mess a second time.",1449100800,6,1224,5.029850746268656

6530758,3,B00M0JU2C0,"Somewhat enjoyable Christmas movie.  Parody of characters, but still good to watch together with family.  Lead actress seemed a little old to play a 20 something.  Liked her over the top LA actor boyfriend-did anyone else get the impression he was actually gay?

Loaded with crap cliche's:

- Leaving your small town makes you arrogant and is a mistake

- People from California are clueless jerks, sad wannabe actors, and lame vegetarians
- The government steals from little people by way of evil taxes

6530909,1,B00M0JU2C0,"This movie was too boring to continue watching, and I love corny, Hallmark-style Christmas movies. The main actress seemed old for her role and too frustrated to be sympathetic. There was never a time that I was really rooting for her. Her boyfriend was also too strange to be funny. I didn't quite get him, but I wanted to because humor seemed to be all the movie would have going for it. The younger, minor characters were endearing, but their storylines were overly stereotyped, and they had a tendency to react and respond unrealistically. The grandfather was basically a political statement in a heavy-handed, angering way. I think whoever wrote and/or directed the movie must really hate LA. I don't think any of the characters from there were anything cartoons. Not worth the dollar to rent it.",1418688000,15,801,4.854014598540146

6531026,5,B00M0JU2C0,"This movie touches the heart because it is about values--what we think is important in life. When a young woman's father dies suddenly, she is faced with some big decisions on what direction to go with her life. Will she return to Hollywood after the funeral to continue pursuing her career in music, or will she stay in Tennessee with the people who love and need her and try to save her father's evergreen tree farm? Evie, the main character, is played by Charleene Closshey, whose outstanding talent comes not only in her acting, but also in her gorgeous music. At the beginning of the movie, when she plays her violin, it seems like an angel is playing. Charleene composed most of the music in the movie, which is why it integrates so well with the story line. Her vocal and keyboard performance of ""Evergreen"" at the end moved me to tears with its beauty. The take-away from the movie is knowing how important love is!  We bought eight copies to give for Christmas presents.

6531028,5,B00M0JU2C0,"This is a heart warming Christmas Story with a fantastic new singing star coming to life.  While Robert Loggia and Naomi Judd give the name brand drawing power, the real talent - both acting and singing is Charlene Crosshey.  I got copies for both my kids and grandkids.  If you want Christmas Spirit to come forth, do yourself a favor and watch this movie",1416441600,7,356,4.53125

8669443,1,B00M0JU2C0,"Unbearable, laughably awful. The goofy policial commentary shoved in about estate taxes and liberal, clueless coastal elites is glaringly obvious and almost painful at times. Painfully stupid.
There are cheesy, fun movies and then there are just absurd, downright awful movies. An Evergreen Christmas falls into the second category.",1512432000,,332,5.795918367346939

8669448,3,B00M0JU2C0,Has some great moments.  From the comedy to drama.  It is a little over the top at times and I don't like how they make everyone from Los Angeles seem like a flake.  The film on the whole has a plausible story line.  The cast  does its best with the material.  This is however family safe.  Kids might get bored and the adults will see nothing new here.  This film is worth watching but not worth buying,1481760000,2,403,4.142857142857143
