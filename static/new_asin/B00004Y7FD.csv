1372101,5,B00004Y7FD,"I Like This Movie Alot Because It Stars Kirsten Storms As Zenon. She Also Plays Belle Black On The TV Soap Oprea ""Days Of Our Lives"". In This Movie Zenon Learns How To Fly, Meet Boys, And Alot More About Space. This Is A Great Movie To Watch With Your Family.",975628800,,259,4.098039215686274
1372102,5,B00004Y7FD,OMG-this movie is so stellar! Rock on Zenon & Nebula!!,975628800,,54,4.5
1372103,5,B00004Y7FD,"A kids' movie adults will actually enjoy!  It explores newworlds (literally) and gives the audience lots of visual treats:special effects, wild outfits, and lots of action.  Zenon is a smart,capable teenage girl who's a bit out of the ordinary--she lives on aspace station in the mid-21st century.  Other than that, she'sperfectly normal--in fact, she's recently gone head over heels for apopular music group.  Zenon has a knack for getting into trouble,though, and when she pushes the limits just a little too far, herparents decide it best to send their daughter back to Earth (theultimate punishment) to stay with Zenon's aunt.  Once there, Zenondiscovers just HOW different she is from the other kids--living up inspace is nothing like living in your typical American city--and shehas a few embarrassing moments, which are not unlike moments Earthkids experience when they transfer to a new country or culture.  Thegreat thing about this movie is that it's never boring.  Sometimespredictable, yes.  Boring, no.  Zenon is always involved in some kindof action-packed escapade. She's part detective, part crime fighter,part Superhero (almost). To put it simply, this movie is""stellar""!",970099200,15,1188,5.483516483516484

1372152,4,B00004Y7FD,I was too old for this movie the first time around but my 'younger' friends insisted I watch this as it was 'very influential' in their adolescence. This movie is super bizarre and awesome. Set in the future but more accurately capturing the awkward fashions of 1999? Raven was exceptionally chic.,1516492800,,297,4.8431372549019605

1372265,3,B00004Y7FD,"3 stars because I'm taking my love for this movie as a child into account.  I should have known better than to watch it as an adult as it ruined what I remembered to be fun, interesting, surprising and fantastic story filled with beautiful cinematography (not that I know what that was back then) and special effects.  this was not the case. It was, first and foremost, a made for tv movie, with the budget and effects to go with it.  but it was also premillenium, meaning that even if they had more money the graphics would still be subpar. It was not how I remembered it.  And watching it I was more annoyed with the kids in the movie than anything because, as an adult, I see what they're doing as the stupid and juvenile antics that they are.
I will let my nieces and nephews watch this though, as I think they will find it fun.  The effects will still be cheesy and they might notice a lot of the things that I did since they are more used to a sophisticated cinematic landscape, even in the realm of made for tv movies, but they will think it's fun",1467763200,,1054,4.223880597014926

1372303,5,B00004Y7FD,"Zetus Lapetus!  If you know that expression like most of us that grew up in the 90's you will definitely enjoy coming back to this film.  As a Disney Channel movie made for TV it still holds up pretty well almost 17 years later!  (Made in 1999).  This is a great nostalgic movie that is enjoyable to sit back on a nice night when you've run out of anything else on streaming to watch.

No spoilers here.  And for those of you who haven't seen it yet?  It's still pretty good all things considered.  The acting is pretty darn good for being some TV movie for kids and teens.  A cute story about how a young girl saves her family, friends, and an entire community living up in a Space Station that is doomed to self-destruct by sabotage by the owner.  She was banned from the Space Station for what they thought was bad behavior, but she is determined to get back and save them all!  Not everything in the movie is entirely realistic, but it's still pretty fun to follow her story and has it's tense moments.

On a side trivial note, it's actually not too far off in its imagination on what life will be like in 2050.  We won't have everyday spaceflight and a giant colony of people living in space, but other things in the film were good predictions from the 90's.  While other films thought we would have flying cars and brain chips, this movie takes a more subtle approach.  Like the people carry around what looks VERY much like the modern day iPad.  A simple touch screen that does everything you want and more.  I've yet to see any movie from before 2000 guess we would ever have such things.  Also, they show *some* cars will be self-driving (not all), which is probably going to happen by 2050.  Zenon's time on Earth is fun to watch, if you like those kind of nerdy things.",1460592000,6,1780,4.33939393939394

1372332,4,B00004Y7FD,"One of the cheesiest scifi movies of all time, but still a kickass movie. Even though all the dialog is silly, it was a serious film in some ways. To an outsider, that station is simply a giant degrading waste of money, but to Zenon, it's home. The movie goes all out to explore how life is different for someone who grew up there. She has no idea how to ride a non-stationary bike, but knows how to set up a space suit. She rarely eats meat up there because they have to grow their own food, but her reaction to a rat in zero gravity is basically ""Hello. How are you?"".

Disturbingly, it was a pretty good prediction of our society. Our music is mindlessly repetitive. Our fashion is terrible. But we love them anyway. Zenon nailed this. And the idea of a computer virus destroying the station isn't too far off when we now have malware that can crash cars.

The effects are okay by modern standards. However, this came out in 1999, when sci-fi was going downhill. But here, we got a pretty good movie. So even with the horrendous dialog, it's still lovable.",1442102400,,1059,4.370558375634518

1372339,4,B00004Y7FD,"I ended up re-watching this tonight by accident (I was at work and it was on the lobby's TV), and I have to say that it's still a pretty enjoyable movie. (I was exposed to it by a friend's young daughter who watched this non-stop as a kid.)

If you're a kid, you're going to love this. It's cute, it's fun, and best of all the main character is someone that many girls will be able to relate to. You probably won't be able to keep the attention of the very young kids (under 5), but any kid over that age will undoubtedly love this.

If you're an adult, you'll probably feel like you'd rather watch paint dry. Give the movie a chance since it's pretty cute for a children's movie and best of all, it's squeaky clean as far as content goes. No real violence, no innuendo- there's nothing here that you'd be likely to find objectionable.

The only downfall is that this is only available on VHS unless you can find a bootleg DVD or YouTube copy. You'll probably have to dig out the old VCR if you want to watch this, but it's worth it if you want to take a trip down memory lane or watch a futuristic kid's flick.",1330732800,,1111,4.182242990654205
1372340,5,B00004Y7FD,bring all Zenon movies out on DVD region 1. I love these movies. why do some Disney movies come out right away and it's been 12 years since this came out on the Disney channel?,1329523200,,176,4.057142857142857
1372341,5,B00004Y7FD,"Zenon is still relevant.  Wish it was on DVD but the tape quality is excellent.  Zenon is still a favorite of mine.  My eight year old granddaughter also loves the movie.  I hope my VCR holds up so I can watch this movie over and over for a long time.

The story line:  Zenon was born on a space station.  She is sent to Earth for misbehaving and has a difficult time fitting into her new environment.  The issues presented have a futuristic setting but are common issues that kids everywhere can understand.",1314921600,,508,4.387096774193548
1372362,5,B00004Y7FD,"I am absolutely in love with this movie.

This movie is so good it makes me wanna cry.

I can't say enough about it- One of my favorite Disney Channel movies BY FAR.

And, I just love the Volkswagen New Beetle, so that ties in with this movie pretty well.  If you haven't seen the movie, u won't under stand the Beetle part, so buy it already!!",1046908800,3,327,4.158730158730159
1372364,5,B00004Y7FD,"When my girls wanted to watch this, I thought for sure I'd sleep through it... I'm not one for out-of-this-world or alien-style movies.  However, it was wonderful and I may have enjoyed it more, or at least as much as, my daughters.  I have to admit that I have yet to find a Disney movie that I don't like, so I should have known they could create a great movie, even with a topic I didn't care for.
When Zenon gets sent to Earth to stay with her aunt, and stay out of trouble... well, as her first trip since she was a very young girl, it was very very funny to watch her fascination with the ""manual"" style of life.  Watching Zenon adjust to Earth life is quite funny.  Just her reaction to rain is an excellent scene.
In addition to adjusting to this life, she is determined to solve another mystery... the cause of her animosity toward the owner of the space ship her friends and family are living on... the space ship that suddenly begins to lose power and suffer serious and possibly fatal consequences.  Can Zenon save the little space city, or will she end up an orphan?  How can a young girl who routinely gets in trouble, and is known for her wild imagination, convince her parents of the root of this problem?  You'll have to watch to find out... but I wouldn't miss this one!  In addition to all of these problems, Zenon is developing some wonderful friendships, and testing their loyalty and human nature in order to save the space city.  One other memorable character is Margie, the young girl who hates Zenon and wants nothing more than for her to return to the space city.  If nothing else, she will keep you in stitches... and you just know from the first sight of her, and her reaction to Zenon, that this girl will keep you entertained.",1026345600,5,1756,4.3919753086419755
1372365,5,B00004Y7FD,"""Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century"" is better than a lot of kids movies that go to the theater. Zenon is a 13 year old girl who lives on a space space station in the future. When she discovers that the owner of the space station has planted a virus to destroy it, she tries to expose him for the slime that he is. But when her plan backfires, her parents ground her to earth where she has to adapt to a whole new lifestyle and find a way to get back to space to save her family and friends. This movie has really good music, too. I was surprised that Disney never released a soundtrack, although a few songs were featured on the disney cd, ""Hears Premiers"". Anyway, I guarantee that you will love ""Zenon""!",1014336000,3,703,4.176470588235294
1372366,5,B00004Y7FD,"As a parent with 2 pre-teen girls, I found the movie to be ""Campy fun.""  While professional reviewers hate the campy nature of the movie (everyone seems to want all science fiction to be ""2001""), the crazy slang, the sci-fi bargain basement clothes, even the Nancy Drew storyline made this a fun flick.  It has just about everything my daughters want... Zenon is popular, stylish, and outspoken; her friend, Nebula, is loyal and the perfect ""Watson"" for her mystery; she falls for a guy and gets to kiss him; and she saves the day in spite of her parents and all the adults.  Own this one, it is a campy good time.",1011830400,2,614,4.464285714285714
1372367,5,B00004Y7FD,"Hi. I am a big fan of Lauren Maltby. I really like her as Margie Hammond, not only in the first Zenon movie, but also in Zenon: The Zequel. My favorite part in Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century was when Lauren, as Margie, after making what I think to be a wicked and evil grin, pushed Zenon, played by Kirsten Storms, in the pool. In Zenon: The Zequel, I am really glad that near the end of the movie, Margie stayed with Zenon, and became friends, after being enemies in the first movie. I really am looking forward to having the Disney Channel turn the movies into a television series.",1011398400,2,584,4.27027027027027
1372368,5,B00004Y7FD,"This movie rocks! Everybody loves it! Because of ""Zenon"", the Disney Channel started making a made for t.v. movie every month! It's a story that everyone will be able to relate to no matter how old or young you are. Kirsten Storms is perfect for the part of Zenon, and Raven Samone did a good job as Z's best friend, Nebula. Zenon is a 13 year old girl who lives on a space station in the year 2049. Everything was going perfect for her. Her favorite band is comeing to space and she gets to meet them. But when Zenon catches the founder of the ""Spay-Stay"" planting a virus to shut it down, nobody believes her and her parents ground her. Literally ground her. To Earth! With her new found friends, Zenon must find a way to get back to space and stop the virus from destroying her home and loved ones before it's too late!

She dosen't fit in, but falls in love and makes an enimy. When on earth, she discovers how to stop the virus from destroying her family, friends, and home!

1372382,5,B00004Y7FD,"I'm not a big fan of made for t.v. movies. I don't mind watching them once in a while, but they're not the best thing to waste your time doing. Anyway, I had read the little childrens book to my sister a couple years ago, so I decided I'd watch it when I heard Disney was going to make it. The book was about trouble maker Zenon who lives on a space station in the future being sent to earth to stay with her grand parents. She found it booring until her dog had puppies. I thought the book was so stupid. But Disney wrote a completely different story for the movie. In the movie, Zenon is in 7th grade, not 5th grade like in the book. When she is accidentially in the wrong place at the right time, she witnesses someone loading a virus into her space station that she lives on. When no one believes her, her parents ground her to earth, which is considered a very dangerous place to live because of pollution and earthquakes and such. She has a little trouble fitting in, but she ends up falling in love and discovers everyone in the space station is about to die because of the virus. Now she dosen't have much time to get back into space and save the day. I reccomend if you haven't seen it, that you go to your local video store and rent it, or maybe wait and see if the price drops. I guarantee you'll like it. Disney recently made a sequal called ""Zenon: The Zequel."" The first one was better though!",981072000,14,1407,4.195571955719557

1372386,5,B00004Y7FD,"Zenon is one of the cheesiest films I've seen. In a good way though! The movie is set in the distant future where everyone drives VW Bugs, Chelsea Clinton is president, kids like to hack into computers and play bizarre games with spinning milk cartons. Not only is the movie's layout a quirky, creative factory of fun, but it's characters are very appealing...and I'm not talking about Zenon in particular! There is Margie, the notorious anti-hero who is overly protective of her beloved Greg. Greg is a subdued sexual maniac who's always making subtle advances on Zenon whether they're miscalculated pick-up lines or head bobs. The villanous couple Mr. Windom and Lutz are almost live action versions of Mr. Burns and Smithers on the Simpsons. The music in the movie is great and you'll be humming Supernova Girl for weeks!
