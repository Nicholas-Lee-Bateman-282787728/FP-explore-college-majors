8333838,3,B001PMSWIE,"One thing becomes very evident when you watch this documentary: Marita Lorenz had a very rough life and this is obvious when you watch this fascinating DVD. She even discloses who really killed Kennedy in 1963, but I won't give it away. Lorenz was born in Hamburg, Germany. She survived a concentration camp. Her father was a boat captain on merchant marine ships. He took Marita on one of his long trips and that's how she met and fell in love with Fidel Castro. I don't know if all the ""facts"" are true, so I rated it 3 stars only, but it's indeed very interesting to watch.",1433808000,,576,4.392523364485982
