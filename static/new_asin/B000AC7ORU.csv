8077713,5,B000AC7ORU,Bought this series original release after buying a bootleg version. Keeping all eight volumes in original manufacturing wrap and even have the awesome limited edition art box with vol. one.,1388707200,,189,5.333333333333333
8077714,5,B000AC7ORU,"The fourth volume in the DVD version of the Manga.  It continues the store that leaves off in the last volume with the conflicting background between the Juken Club and the Student Council.  As with the other volumes, it has a great story line, good animation, and some interesting background music.  I can't wait to see the next volume.",1140739200,,337,4.677966101694915
8077715,5,B000AC7ORU,"I took a big risk with the first vol and have not regreted it!!! Everytime I think I've seen all that someone can do, I get hit in the face. All I got to say is watch out for Shin and ""Bunshichi"" in this volume. Worth keeping up with if you like fighting anime:)",1138060800,,262,3.8703703703703702
8077716,4,B000AC7ORU,This volume is unlike the first three. There is less action and more dialouge. The story is developed more. This volume is all about the past relationships. The next volume will definitely pick up on the action.,1135814400,,211,4.72972972972973
