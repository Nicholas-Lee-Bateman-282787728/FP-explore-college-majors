7456338,5,B01648PBV4,"This is basically based on geological and climatic changes of North America since the Earth was formed. The geology and climate has always been in flux, changing constantly, but on a geological time scale. Climate change is not new and something to panic about and form emergency political goverments. It will constantly change as it always has, sometimes getting hotter and more tropical or colder moving into ice ages, such as the little ice age in Europe.",1476835200,2,458,4.961038961038961

8735602,5,B01648PBV4,"This series from the PBS science program NOVA examines geologic forces shaping North America.  The first episode looks primarily at plate tectonics.  Starting with the ancient terrain of Laurentia, dating back several billion years, the central land mass was gradually assembled by collisions with island chains.  The east coast was grafted on by the merger of continental plates to form the supercontinent Pangea.  The eventual breakup left the modern continent of North America in its wake.  The second episode examines how geology affected evolution.  Shallow inland seas led to rich marine life, but the formation of the Rockies due to a collision with the Pacific plate led to a general up-thrusting which drained the seas, leaving the Great Plains.  The third looks at the arrival of humans 13,000 years ago, and how natural resources eventually fueled industrialization.  This series fully sustains interest over the three hour running time.",1524873600,3,948,5.358108108108108
