Anthony Woods and his brother-in-law seem like two regular blokes, but  with the exception of a couple of interesting images  their videos consist of shaky camcorder images of very distant dots in the sky.  There is not even close to enough detail to even think about identifying the objects they filmed.  The two most interesting images weren't very impressive to me, either  one looks to me like a piece of black trash floating in the wind, while the morphing object could well be balloons.  The vast majority of the documentary, though, shows you clip after clip of blurry white dots in the sky while annoying, elevator-like soft guitar plays in the background.  Its a total snore fest.

And what of Mr. Anthony Woods?  From 1999-2002, he filmed UFOs flying over his backyard virtually every day, while no one else in the area ever reported seeing anything.  Thats fishy.  The story gets even fishier when you learn that Woods disassociated himself from the makers of this documentary and from the whole subject of UFOs in 2004.  His attempt to retract the right to use of his images gives the impression that he was after money all along.  Thus, were left with very questionable footage that failed to impress me in the first place.

The other thing I would have liked to see is the investigators going into the heart of this admittedly small village where Woods lives, and asking who else is seeing these craft.  SURELY lots of other people are gazing up at the beautiful blue sky and happen to see these things, given the unparalleled number of sightings for one area.

The editing of this documentary was embarrassingly and comically amateurish.  There are a ridiculous amount of screen wipes - and for no reason/no scene change - the footage segment scenes are FAR too long and set to lame music.  It lends nothing to the credibility of the filmed objects to show me 12 minutes of uninterrupted footage as opposed to three.
