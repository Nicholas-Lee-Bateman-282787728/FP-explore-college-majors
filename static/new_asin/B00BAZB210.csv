8565106,5,B00BAZB210,"Wonderful to know that these 3 Terayama features are now available, legitimately, and on Blu-ray.  Unlike the short films DVD set that came out in 2006, these unfortunately don't have subtitles.  Somewhat short-sighted on behalf of the company releasing this, as Terayama films are hard to find.  Hopefully a US or UK company will have enough interest in a future release.",1367625600,9,372,5.065573770491803
