8692909,3,B00QTKCPMG,"the problem with an adaptation of a novel such as this one is that the film director concentrates on those parts of the novel which make good
viewing to an audience which wants to see the story presented in such a way that it is all over in under two hours. Ms. Clarke',s novel does have sections which  which work well on celluloid but unfortunately the later sections of the film in which the Devil gets a big share of the action  really  turns the story into a third -rate horror movie.
The early parts of the movie in which Mr. Strange finds himself having powers he never realised he possessed are brilliant and sadly its the latter part is junk.  .",1465084800,,654,4.336065573770492
