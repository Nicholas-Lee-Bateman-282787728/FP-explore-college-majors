8005734,5,B00012QLV4,I Think FUNimation Entertainment/Productions's Dub Is Better Then Viz Or Cloverway,1489536000,,82,6.545454545454546
8005735,5,B00012QLV4,"The Disc plays without any problems like pixelation and artifacts. The audio isn't consistent but the picture quality is decent.
This Disc has the Cloverway Dub and original Japanese audio track and subtitles.
The show is good. If you hate the Cloverway dub you can buy the Viz release instead. I don't know if they improved the image and Audio quality from the previous releases or not.",1487980800,,387,4.791044776119403
8005736,5,B00012QLV4,this season show all the sailor scouts. i love this.,1459209600,,52,4.3
8005737,5,B00012QLV4,"I remember watching Sailor Moon on Toonami, and absolutely loving it. This is volume one of season 3 to the series. There are repetitive scenes used throughout this season, but if you love the concept/story of Sailor Moon, that shouldn't bother you. I do recommend this volume and the series, however if you are a hardcore anime fan (that is into unedited, uncut, original japanese version material) you may find this disappointing if you watch the Japanese versions as ""key plots"" have been altered in the english version to make it more friendly to younger audiences.",1229731200,,569,4.9375
