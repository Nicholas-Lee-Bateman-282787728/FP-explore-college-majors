8022954,3,B00026L8Y4,"Tropix is better than most straight-to-video movies in some respects, but completely average in others.  The directing is pretty decent, and the cinematography is surprisingly good.  What really separates Tropix from other low-budget movies is that the scenery is beautiful.  Tropix was filmed entirely on location in Costa Rica, with gorgeous shots of lush jungle, and interesting shots of real locals.  Even a montage involving a banana plant takes something completely ordinary, and makes it a real treat for the eye.  The film's score is upbeat, ranging from Mambo to Merengue.

Where Tropix falls short is average writing, and average acting.  There are a few moments of black humor that work out well, but for the most part the film isn't funny when it tries to be.  The ""bad guy with a heart of gold"" story line used in the film has also been done way too many times before.  Costa Rican actress Michelle Jones is very hot as Solange, the lustful kidnapper.  Danielle Bisutti is also incredibly gorgeous as Corrine, kidnapped wife of a man who gets in over his head with his partners.  While both of these lovely actresses more than kept my attention, none of the acting performances in this film were anything special.  As a side note, the DVD cover doesn't reflect any actual scenes in the movie.

Tropix has a halfway decent and fairly unpredictable twist ending.  But overall, weak writing and average acting keep this movie from realizing it's potential.  The footage of Costa Rica is terrific, though, and that alone is worth checking this film out.  Give this one a rent before you decide to buy the DVD.",1274313600,4,1618,4.829090909090909
