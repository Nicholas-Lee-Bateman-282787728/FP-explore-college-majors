1696927,5,B0000640UB,"THIS MOVIE WILL REALLY IMPRESS FANS OF ROACH MOVIES. IT TAKES THE AUDIENCE ON A RIDE THAT ALL ARE NEVER TO FORGET. IT'S PLOT IS MUCH BETTER THAN THAT OF ""THE NEST.""
I BELIEVE THAT THIS WAS A DIRECT-TO-VIDEO RELEASE, BUT IT WAS STILL VERY GOOD EVEN THOUGH!!!
SOME OF IT IS VERY HARD TO STOMACH, BUT IT HAS A LIMITED USE OF PROFANITY IN THE FILM.
THIS IS A VERY GOOD THRILLER THAT WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN CRAWL!!!!",1022112000,,408,4.177215189873418

That being said, ""They Nest"" isn't a blockbuster by any means but was entertaining enough to keep my attention through until the end.  There are enough decent actors in it to carry a pretty predictable little horror story about bugs that ""nest"" inside human bodies.  The primary ""bad guy""(although he's not all that bad) is a very familiar face although I can't recall his name.  He did a good job of adding some realism and humor to the film.  Actually, he carried the film for the most part lol!  But anyway, not a bad little movie for the price (free!).",1485475200,2,729,4.3161764705882355

Oh, so boring with the usual predictable ending. Oh, and there was also lousy acting.",1444867200,,395,4.577464788732394

1697049,5,B0000640UB,"Forced to take a leave of absence, Dr. Ben Cahill (Thomas Calabro) takes his shaky hands to the inhospitable Orr's Island.  He immediately runs afoul of a decidedly creepy grudge driven yahoo named Jack (John Savage).  Jack and his evil brother run roughshod over the small island community.  There's a great deal of bitterness over the loss of their family home to the dubious doctor.  Payback is a long time coming.  Woe to anyone who gets in their way, this includes the fair-minded sheriff (Dean Stockwell).

This movie is torn between the eminently more interesting aspect of the killer bugs (mostly played for laughs), and the increasingly hostile activities of the two crazed brothers.  I would have rather seen more bugs, less of the in-your-face yahoos bellyaching over a stupid house.  When things escalate with the death of Jack, all hell breaks loose, leaving the bugs a mere afterthought in the scheme of things.

The original title for this movie was They Nest.  I loved the humorous parts (the classroom scene with the tarantula is priceless), and tolerated the less savory part with the town bullies (it started feeling like an old western at that point, being called out in the middle of the street).

This movie even manages to toss in a brief rant about global warming (don't know why that was necessary).  The real stars are the playful bugs, though some of the actors manage to make you aware that they too are present and accounted for.  The director, Ellory Elkayem is also responsible for another of my favorite bug movies: Eight Legged Freaks.",1410652800,3,1568,4.849624060150376
1697070,4,B0000640UB,"I have a fair number of horror DVDs in my library that fill the same niche as 'Creepy Crawlers.' Movies such as 'The Blob,' 'Slither,' 'Splinter,"" et al are all nifty horror outings that have a good mix of story, character and horror to fill their 90 minute or so running time. They won't change your life but they're high on the entertainment scale.

'Creepy Crawlers' involves a doctor who hasn't quite adjusted to being on the wagon. His boss gives him time off so he goes to his recently purchased, dilapidated house on an Island off the coast of Maine, to get it up to speed. The house was a bank repo and the two brothers from whom it was repoed have real bad feelings toward him. Meanwhile, a sailor from an African ship gets tossed overboard by his mates for being a human bug hotel. His body washes ashore on the Island and the bugs do their thing.

This is pretty high on the creep and goo scale. These bugs use animals as hosts so when the eggs hatch things get really nasty. As in other movies of this type things start a bit slow. Clues start to build and those who know what's going on have to convince those who don't. Meanwhile the animosities get in the way and make things even more difficult.

The acting is generally good. John Savage, as the one brother, is way better than he even has to be in the role. Dean Stockwell is good as the sheriff but could have used a bit more time. Kristen Dalton, likewise, is good but needed more time. The effects are on par with the budget. The lighting, cinematography, editing, etc. are all good enough for the project. This is just a very watchable movie. Things get a bit rushed near the end and the climax could have been a bit more spectacular but all in all this is a fun time.",1310342400,3,1740,4.298780487804878
1697071,4,B0000640UB,"This is a really good little horror movie!  Actually, I just found out about it, being available on DVD...however, I know this movie under a different title, ""They Nest"". Saw it on TV as a made for cable movie, I believe it was originally on TNT.
 I had taped it on VHS, and have looked for it a long time on DVD, and then just recently found out it was on DVD under this different title of, Creepy Crawlers"".

1697072,4,B0000640UB,"Dr. Cahill (Thomas Calabro) is a recovering alcoholic. After being unable to perform a surgery, he is told to take a ""vacation"" by his superior. This leads him to a small island, where he hopes to settle in and relax. Instead, the locals, led by two brothers (one played by John Savage), cause nothing but problems for Cahill. Meanwhile, a growing legion of biting, killer cockroaches have arrived on the island, ready to destroy all in their path! Dr. Cahill, with the help of the sheriff (Dean Stockwell!) and the gal from the general store (Kristen Dalton), must find out what's been killing the townsfolk before it's too late. CC is a solid little grabber w/ enough twists and jolts to keep things running on all six legs. There's even some gory goo that's surprising for a PG-13 movie!

1697073,4,B0000640UB,"A small island in Maine experiences terror once an infested body washes up on shore.  The Island's newest resident is a doctor in need of getting away.  Unfortunately the Doc has made enemies just by buying the wrong house.  As tempers flare among the residents the doctor stumbles upon the hidden problem growing on the island.

The Island is now home to a horrible bug that lays its eggs in small mammals.  Now they have turned toward man as a host.  Unfortunately once the residents are finally confronted with the reality it is too late to do more than run.  But it is hard to run far when you are surrounded by water and the next ferry isn't due for a week.

Very realistic looking bugs really add to the creep factor in this film.  Some pretty decent acting is also present and you will probably recognize a few faces (and not just Dean Stockwell as the Sheriff).  Parts of the movie look like it could lead to an interesting sequel (if handled right) while the existing ending adds just the right touch.  If you like swarms of bugs in your movies then this one is right up your alley.",1134604800,,1091,4.405
1697074,4,B0000640UB,This movie is extremely creepy. Definitely worth watching. It WILL make your skin crawl! Well worth what it is selling for on Amazon.,1119830400,2,133,4.826086956521739
1697075,4,B0000640UB,"THE NEST is one of those horror movies that are light years ahead of their better publicized yet less competently crafted brethren.  What makes a horror film memorable is not just well-designed gory effects (although that helps).  What does make the difference is the same quality that attracts or disinterests moviegoers with all films: does the audience connect to the characters in a way as to make us care about their fates? In THEY NEST, director Ellery Elkayem presents the hero Dr. Ben Cahill (Thomas Calabro) as a drunken sot of a surgeon who loses his job as an attending physician at a prestigious hospital and heads to a small island off the coast of Maine to sober up. Cahill is a good but flawed man who clearly wants to reset his moral compass.  On the island he meets the lovely Nell (Kristin Hocking Dalton), with whom he is allowed to gradually form a romantic tie.  The Big Bug Menace of this movie is not big at all.  They are ordinary looking Africanized pincer wielding cockroaches that show their menace only when covering the ground in a rapidly moving insect blanket of pincer snapping lethality.  These bugs breed, attack en masse, and lay their eggs within a human host so that their emergence smacks of the stomach bursting scene from ALIEN. The bugs seem to operate in a hive mentality; thus, they function as a collective threat to humanity.

Dean Stockwell as the local sheriff and John Savage as the hick lobsterman are surprisingly effective in backup roles.  Calabro and Hocking-Dalton gradually show a growing love interest, with Hocking-Dalton taking the lead in romance.  The ending is a let-down.  How many times have we seen the last of the Bug Eyed Monsters get killed only to see a lone survivor fly or crawl off to repeat the process?  Still, the scenes in which Stockwell and Savage try to swat away a rolling carpet of predator bugs must surely cause the audience to peek into that shoe before they put it on. Recommended.",1099699200,2,1965,4.716374269005848
1697076,5,B0000640UB,"CREEPY CRAWLERS is the first movie in some time that made my squirm and my skin crawl; with an effective use of silence and eerily atmospheric music and some nifty camerawork, this movie really gets under your skin.
It opens with some shipmates duct taping a fellow matey, and then dumping him overboard; the body comes to rest on a sleepy little island in Maine.  A surgeon (Thomas Calabro, in a marvelously controlled and humorus performance) has recently purchased a house on this island.  It needs fixing up, and the only one who can help out electically is a nasty feller named Jack Wald (played with venomous relish by John Savage).  Seems like Wald and his brother should have inherited the house, but since their pappy didn't pay his taxes, the house went up for sale and Calabro bought it.  Meanwhile, the cockroaches are swarming and just dying to breed in their human hosts.
There are some incredibly creepy scenes, and when the bugs sprout wings, look out.
This is a great ""little"" movie, full of dark humor and nasty, nasty bugs!

1697077,4,B0000640UB,This movie is a great movie to watch if you are in the mood to see thousands of cockroaches crawl through peoples' bodies and nest in them.

IT WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN CRAWL!,1068508800,8,309,4.220338983050848
1697078,4,B0000640UB,"I never knew what to expect when I bought the movie ""Creepy Crawlers"" starring Thomas Calabro, Dean Stockwell, Kristen Dalton, and John Savage.  I figured it was just another campy B-movie or something.  The cover itself looks gross-out nasty.  Most people who have fears of insects or bugs probably won't even think to look at the cover twice.  But I'm a horror buff, so I can handle most films with the creepy crawly things anyhow.  So, I took a deep breathe and started watching Creepy Crawlers.  And to my surprise, that this picture is actually a good time fun.  I was also surprise, the acting was much better than I anticipated that it would be.
The Story: (***1/2 stars) ""When Dr. Ben Cahill takes a leave of absence from his medical practice and moves to Orrs Island off the coast of Maine, all he expects is some quiet time away.  But the solace of the tiny isle is hattered when bizarre and frightening deaths begin to occur.  The victims appear to have died by natural causes, yet each body has red insect bits on its flesh.  When an autopsy reveals one dead man's chest cavity filled with insect cocoons, Cahill is horrified to discover that a rare breed of African cockroaches has invaded the island and they are using the inside of human beings as breeding grounds! Now, it's a race against time as the islanders try everything they can to escape the deadly insects before they are eaten alive!""
  ~VHS box set
The FX: (**** stars) Good enough to be totally grossed out!
The Score: (**** stars) Keeps you on the edge of your seat, pumping more anticipation than you would rarely expect in a horror picture.
The Picture Itself: (**** stars) The actors did a great job in protraying these characters to be enough believable to make you feel for them, (and yes, even the damned creepy crawlers that make your skin crawl, literally).  It's good enough to watch it again.
So the next time yo uare looking for a really good horror flick, you might wanna check out ""Creepy Crawlers,"" a well done movie that should get more than it deserves.  Don't judge the cover by its looks: you might be surprised to have yourself a really good time.
Also, to Amazon.com: You rated this film [R] on the flm ratings when it is actually a [PG-13] rating according to the VHS box set.  [PG-13] for creature violence and peril.  Now, when I watched the film myself, I didn't really see any sexual nudity or a sex scene, which I was greatful.  There was very little mild language in it as well.  So it would be appreciated if you could change the rating back to [PG-13].  I would be apprecitaed.
All in all, Creepy Crawlers is a creepin' good time! ""Veiwers beware, you're in for a scare!""  ~R.L. Stine's Goosebumps",1057795200,3,2705,4.561076604554866
