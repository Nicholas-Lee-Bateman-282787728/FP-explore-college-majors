1107303,5,6305968896,"There's no mistaking this for a big budget Hollywood movie -- quite frankly, it says too much about people. It's an honest commentary about who  people are and how they interact, a subtle yet revealing look at the  underside of people and their relationships to others. In essence, this is  a film about three people -- and nothing more. It comes highly recommended.",965520000,,366,4.777777777777778
1107304,4,6305968896,"In this dramatic comedy film by John Swanbeck we meet three salesman looking to score the big sale while in Witcheta, KS.  This film is the adaptation of the stage play ""The Hospitality Suite"".
Phil  (DeVito) is a guy who has been in the business for a while and in the  middle of a divorce.  He daydreams of cigars, brandy, and jumping off a  high rise.  Phil has known Larry (Spacey) for a while and it appears this  isthe first time they have been paired up together in a while.  Larry is a  fast talking, honest (not blunt), and hypertensive salesman.  From the  moment his mouth opens he is complaining and joking around.  Newcomer Peter  Facinelli (Can't Hardly Wait, Supernova) plays Bob, the info guy.  Bob is  NOT a salesman, he just does the R & D for their lubricant company.  Bob seems a lot more interested in selling God though.
The entire film  takes place in the hospitality suite where they have their company - client  mixer.  All the while Larry goes on the hunt for the ""Big  Kahuna"", the big sale that brought them to town.  Bob is the only one  that makes contact with him and it is purely by accident.  Now they have to  send in the non-salesman to land the deal of their lives.
All 3 actors  give outstanding performances in this dramatic satire about God,  lubricants, and the proper hors d'vours to serve your clients.",962582400,8,1344,4.473029045643154
1107365,4,6305968896,"Genius.  Sometimes I think I am smart because I get something.  Then I realize someone was worlds above my insight to put it into words and create an atmosphere to express what this world may be about.  This movie is not that entertaining and the dialogue does not always hit home, but in the end it gives a life-changing message about who we each are in this world and to think our way is right is narrow and vain.  The end dialogue in the background is a masterpiece about life.  Full of wisdom from someone who  has lived.  This movie in its honesty could change your life if you let it.",1491350400,,590,4.261261261261262
1107366,5,6305968896,"I loved this movie. The writer knows how to write dialog, which is nice because that's all there is to this movie. The actors give powerful performances that they'll credit to their years of experience, but you've got to thank the director as well. None of the scenes in the movie were obtained in one take. I'm sure the days were long, that people lost their tempers, and that everyone involved was happy it was over; but how proud they must be of the result of those days.

BUT stick around - the movie is fully of clever dialog, the acting is great, and the second part is especially thoughtful.  The movie is based on a play, so it has a ""play"" feel to it.

It may be hard for some to understand, such as those just looking for easy entertainment. However, if you do chose to watch this and look beyond the topics and into the root of why they act and speak as they do, you will find a very beautiful window into how our minds work. A window that goes deep into the heart of each and every person. It does not matter what you do or what you believe in. It's not trying to sell you anything. It is trying to get us to pay attention to who we are as people, how we handle ourselves and our relations with others.

Definitely a study on human dialogue - there is no drama or action in this movie.  But a lot to think about here in this movie, and the longer you stick with it, the more you 'get' it, until it is over, and then you are left with lots of conversation with the people you watch it with.

As someone who was in my young years zealous for God, but without maturity or understanding (and pride), I painfully saw myself in this movie.  Human love has an agenda... it is not totally honest.  It mixes in selfish desires in it.  But God's love has no expectations.  It loves us right where we are, wanting only the best for us.  Or as a spiritual father says from lovinglikegod .com, ""Love listens"".

Here are some thing about Twilight and The Twilight Saga New Moon
The big-screen adaptation of Twilight, Stephenie Meyer's bestselling vampire romance, is aimed squarely at its key demographic: teen girls whose idea of Prince Charming is a brooding, pale, undead teen who could kill you instantly at any moment. Such a prince is more fascinating than frightening to new girl Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), who moves to the rainy-gray town of Forks, Wash., to live with her dad (Billy Burke), the local sheriff who's puzzled by a series of ""animal attacks."" On her first day at school, Bella appears to (visibly) nauseate her lab partner, Edward (Robert Pattinson). Turns out the scent of her blood is this vampire's ""brand of heroin,"" and his struggle not to kill her causes an irresistible pull toward her. Whether he's attracted for the normal reasons or because she smells especially sweet to him is vague in the book and even less clear on-screen; nonetheless, Bella falls hopelessly in love with Edward, which sets her on a dangerous path when a few nomad vampires show up in town, one particularly keen on tracking the human. Directed by Catherine Hardwicke (Thirteen), Twilight is full of funny moments--not all of which are intentional--and the casting, from Stewart to Bella's self-absorbed friend Jessica (Anna Kendrick) is spot-on. The weakest link, unfortunately, is Pattinson. While he certainly looks the part, his Edward could have used an extra injection of testosterone (Pattinson, who is British, used James Dean as a model for his American accent). In scenes where he growls about the temptation to kill those who would harm Bella, or flitting around a forest warning her how dangerous he is, he comes off more like a whimpering puppy than a debonair monster. The good news is, his chemistry with Stewart (particularly in their big kissing scene) is palpable, which, let's face it, is really what matters to Twilight fans most. --Ellen A. Kim
On the DVD
The special features for Twilight kick off with an audio commentary with director Catherine Hardwicke and stars Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. There's some mumbling and groaning from Stewart (one gets the impression that Stewart is quite similar to her reserved character in the film), some standard behind-the-scenes observations from Hardwicke, and a lot of awkward self-deprecating remarks from Pattinson (of their big kiss, he opines: ""This is quite difficult 'cause I have a really flat head, and so it's quite difficult to get a correct angle.""). What's funny is Pattinson stumping Hardwicke with some basic plot questions, like ""Why doesn't James just kill [Bella when she's packing at her house]?"" While Hardwicke and Stewart attempt to answer, Pattinson doesn't appear satisfied. The deleted and extended scenes include an additional dream-sequence kiss (rightly cut because it took away from the buildup to their first kiss) and more footage of Victoria (Rachelle Lefevre). The seven-part documentary is a pretty thorough look at the development of the film, including stunts, special effects, and the involvement of author Stephenie Meyer. Another featurette looks at the Comic-Con frenzy; however, it spends no time on how the actors were cast, which would have been fun for fans who did all their own mental casting while reading the books. Also included: three music videos and trailers. --Ellen A. Kim Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) doesn't expect much when she moves to the small town of Forks, Washington, until she meets the mysterious and handsome Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson)--a boy who's hiding a dark secret: he's a vampire. As their worlds and hearts collide, Edward must battle the bloodlust raging inside him as well as a coterie of undead that would make Bella their prey. Based on the #1 New York Times best-selling sensation by Stephenie Meyer, Twilight adds a dangerous twist to the classic story of star-crossed lovers.
New Moon, the second in Stephenie Meyer's blockbuster teen-fiction saga adapted for film, is stronger than its predecessor, Twilight. Director Chris Weitz (The Golden Compass), taking the helm from Catherine Hardwicke, brings a lighter, more assured touch to the sequel, which continues the star-crossed love story of mortal Bella (Kristen Stewart) and vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson). Incidentally, Edward is absent for most of the film; after an accident on Bella's birthday reminds Edward that her life is always at risk when he's around, he chooses to abandon her, sending her into a deep depression. The only person who helps her heal her broken heart is her friend Jacob (Taylor Lautner), a member of the Quileute tribe who, as he grows taller, beefier, and more aggressive (with less clothing), comes to realize he's not entirely human either. But even his love for Bella doesn't prevent her from throwing herself in the path of danger, because that's the only time she can see visions of Edward. One such fateful misunderstanding sends Edward into the coven of the Volturi (a sort of vampire Mafia, if you will), where the most dangerous vampires hold both Edward and Bella's fate in their cold, dark hands. Much of New Moon rests on the shoulders of Lautner, so scrawny in Twilight, who famously packed on the muscle to avoid getting recast. He's very nearly successful in carrying the load, but the cheese-tastic beefcake scenes disservice him, and Jacob and Bella's complicated friendship stumbles on its way to any kind of love triangle. Some of that blame lies with Stewart, who understandably holds her emotions close to her chest but reveals much too little (c'mon, even an angsty girl has to be a little joyful in the arms of two different hunks). As is with the book, the film is just a bridge between sagas, so the plot drags and not a lot happens. Fortunately, while Twilight was trapped in its own self-consciousness, the wobbly-legged cast seems to have found stronger footing in New Moon; the jokes come faster, the writing (by Melissa Rosenberg, who also scribed Twilight) is a hair wittier. (Even Pattinson seems more comfortable in Edward's skin.) The Volturi, highlighted by Michael Sheen's Aro and Dakota Fanning's Jane, also make an all-too-brief impression, but at least there's more to look forward to when Eclipse, the third installment, is released. --Ellen A. Kim In the second chapter of Stephenie Meyer's best-selling Twilight series, the romance between mortal Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) grows more intense as ancient secrets threaten to destroy them. When Edward leaves in an effort to keep Bella safe, she tests fate in increasingly reckless ways in order to glimpse her love once more. But when she's saved from the brink by her friend, Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner), Bella will uncover mysteries of the supernatural world that will put her in more peril than ever before.",1266710400,,10693,5.100399315459213

1107827,5,6305968896,"Some art is made truly great by its ability to take something ordinary and show its hidden more-than-ordinary side. To this reviewers mind, that is one of the things - outside of excellent acting and good dialogue - that makes The Big Kahuna a spectacular work of art.

Translated from Roger Rueff's play, ""Hospitality Suite,"" TBK lets us into the world of three salesmen of industrial lubricants before, during, and after, hosting a business party that could make or break their careers. One character is a veteran who is growing weary of the business world. Another is a middle aged 'natural born salesman.' The third is a rookie who is new to the whole thing and is (some would say) naive about the whole business process. Between these three divurgent personalities, sparks fly, waters are tested, and no one is left unscathed.

As said, sometimes art is made great by its abilty to show the 'beneath the surface' side of seemingly ordinary things. In TBK, a business party becomes the vehicle for exploring everything from how much 'humanness' is permitted into the impersonal world of business, what happens when religious ethics show up in the business world, and (?!) even matters of life, death, and whether either has any grande meaning.

Especially, religion is a large element of the film. The youngest character - the newbie - is a religiously committed baptist. The oldest character, by contrast, seems to be going through a crisis of faith and is ""wondering about god"" in increasing amounts. When an important big-whig doesn't show up to the party, one character urges another to ""have faith... for once in your life."" And the words ""Jesus Christ"" are bandied about as everything from a proper name to a nasty exclamation. If nothing else, the invocation of religion into a film about ""making the sale"" makes for a thrilling tension underlying the entire film.

Others have commented on the acting. All three characters - Peter Facinelli (the newbie), Kevin Spacey (natural-born-salesman) and Danny DeVito (the tired veteran) - all give outstanding performances. All three know their characters very well, making for very reallistic interplay. Despite my efforts, I cannot imagine these roles being played better by any other actors.

If you like films that make you think a bit, taking ordinary things and showing them from angles that make them appear new, then this film is one you should check out. Three characters, one hospitality suite in Wichita, KS, a business party that could make or break careers. Anything can - and does - happen.",1148083200,13,2558,4.9672897196261685

They're hoping that a major retailer will show up at the party at their suite.  Their careers rest on getting his business.

There's a new salesman in the company though, played by Peter Facinelli.  He's young and idealistic and very religious.  He doesn't drink or swear and he talks about Jesus.  Immediately there is conflict, as the veteran salesmen do their best to influence this new recruit.  Problems ensue when the religious guy does get the ear of the retailer.  But he only talks to him about religion.

If you are not willing (or capable) to delve, then you may likely be ... well, bored (though it should still be entertaining). Even the humor is intellectually subtle, lying slightly below the surface of the obvious.

Danny De Vito's soliloquy, though technically not, because it is spoken to the rookie salesman who is not in view, is delivered as the camera zooms ever closer into the face of the actor, and is the crux of the message, the highlight of the movie, and a wonderful screen moment. Go watch it again...ALONE.

I will concede that I was somewhat irritated by the hokey ""Chicken-Soup-for-the-Soul"" admonitions that segue from the movie to the credits at the end. Though some of these are interesting, and clever, this touch was bit pretentious. I'd rather have remained in the partial reverie where the movie had left me.

1107835,1,6305968896,"A small, hemmed in, cramped film in almost all respects 'The Big Kahuna' is based on the play 'Hospitality Suite' and its small town theater feel shows through. Set almost entirely in a hospitality suite at an industrial lubricants convention, 'Kahuna' feels unintentionally claustrophobic and the stilted dialogue that comes out of every character's mouth doesn't help things either. The film wavers between dull and cliche and no amount of overacting from a tedious Spacey is going to save us.
When the examination of the human condition through the lens of ""sales"" has already been done before (and better) in works like 'Death of a Salesman' and 'Glengarry, Glen Ross', what does 'Kahuna' offer us? Lots of talking and talking. Two or three people in a room, one having a deeply personal crisis, another a deeply religious one and all three of them revealing themselves in a stream-of-consciousness yielding such lines as, ""Don't you quote scripture to me, Bob!"" and ""Larry, do you love me?"" Spacey spends the first hour of the film overacting with the same kind of callousness he brings to Larry's character that he brought to 'Swimming with Sharks'. Then, suddenly, as the long night drags on, Larry softens up a bit extending himself emotionally to a recently divorced Phil (DeVito). DeVito spends a lot of time saying, ""We'll be all right,"" and staring pensively off into space or letting his eyes get all dewy with emotion (about what? His divorce? His desire to get out of the sales business? Who cares?)
Then we have Bob, the clean-cut devout Christian who cannot seem to talk to anyone without bringing God into the conversation. All fine and good, but it becomes clear very quickly that Bob has chosen the wrong profession when he speaks to the elusive Kahuna of the title on two separate occaisions and bends the guy's ear about Jesus both times when he's really there to land a lubricant contract. ""But I think that's important!"" Bob shouts at Larry. I kept thinking, 'Um, yeah sure it is. Follow your heart. Go be an evangelist. Knock yourself out kid. Just get out of this movie because I don't see the point of your being here.' Plus, I know enough devout Christians who are capable of separating their work and their God.

At one point in the movie, Danny DeVito's character says something like, ""When I was a kid, I had a dream about God. I dreamed I found Him hiding in a closet in a burned out city. The closet was just standing there by itself in the ruins. I walked to the closet door and inside was God, he had a lions head but I knew it was God. I could tell that he was scared. I reached in and held His hand. I led him out of the closet, still holding His hand. We stood there a while, just the two of us, holding hands, God and I. Then I said: Don't be afraid. Don't you worry God I'm on your side.""",1023408000,,741,3.9466666666666668

However, I only caught the tail end of it. After that night I never saw the film again. Luckily enough I was browsing through the previously viewed DVD section at my local video store and found a copy of The Big Kahuna. I picked it up for a steal.
The dialogue in this film is some of my favorite, it rivals that of Tarantino's films with the massive conveyence of information but making it all seem rather nonchalant. Kevin Spacey is hilarious in this movie. It's stunning what a serious movie this is but still manages to be so funny at the same time. Danny Devito gives one of the greatest acting performances I have ever seen. I still don't think I have seen better, and I doubt I probably ever will.
This film is a very interesting one, there's basicly only three people in the entire film. And somehow the film keeps you very interested in the happening of all the characters and their problems, things like that, it was gripping some how.
As for the DVD it's self, there's not to much to it. 5.1 audio, 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen, not really much else to be said about it. But it's well worth the money. I would highly recommend this film.",1017360000,,1384,4.474308300395257

DeVito and Spacey turn out great performances, as can be expected.  Spacey dons his usual sharp tongue to play Larry, while DeVito steps out of his typical obnoxious wiseguy skin to play Phil, a quiet man unsure about his life and spirituality.  The surprise here is Peter Facinelli, a young Tom Cruise look-alike (humorously alluded to in a scene where his character imagines himself tending bar, a la ""Cocktail"") who holds his own against the two venerable veterans.  He plays a young, idealistic and deeply pious newcomer to the business scene, Bob.  Other critics have described him as arrogant, but he's not--his religious convictions simply run so deeply he honestly can't understand those who disagree with him.  The abrasive and vulgar Larry provides Bob with a sort of guilty fascination; Larry is clearly brilliant, but is just as clearly not a church-goer.  The film finds a believable and gripping tone with which to question faith and spirituality, and concludes that all three men are spiritual in their own way: Larry finds meaning through his job, Bob through Christ, and Phil lies somewhere inbetween, tired of the charade of his career but unsure how to continue.  DeVito has the two most powerful scenes.  In the first, he bares his heart to Larry, reminiscing about a poignant, haunting childhood dream.  In the second, he lectures Bob, reminding him that he hasn't lived enough to be so sure of himself.  You don't have to be religious or deeply spiritual to enjoy this film, only thoughtful.

No explosions, no special effects, no huge Hollywood budget - but lots of wonderful dialogue and though provoking character studies. So much dialogue, in fact, that you'll have to see it a few times just to ""catch"" it all.

But then it takes off unexpectedly on a spiritual tangent (that seemed more like an agenda at first) before finishing up like ""The Rapture"" as a cautionary tale about the dangers of over-zealousness and the intransigence of one's belief system.  The similarities between the religion of Christ and the reverence for Mammon was already fascinating (and apparent) without Devito's superfluous summarizing monologue.  The claustrophobic setting reveals the film's origin as a stageplay but that didn't bother me because these three guys don't seem like the types who would want to grab a breath of fresh air in Wichita, KS anyway.

The storyline is simple and concise.  Based on a play by Roger Rueff, The Big Kahuna presents the audience with various moral, ethical, and religious contradictions.  The youthful and somewhat naive character played by Peter Facinelli has strong religious convictions, thus making himself an easy target for the older, satirical character played by Kevin Spacey.  The verbal sparring Spacey and Facinelli engage in concerning the ethics of religion and salemanship is thought-provoking.  The debate deals with ""selling religion"" and the importance of distinguishing between making a sales pitch for a religion, in this case Christianity, and simply sharing thoughts and personal philosophies.

1107994,4,6305968896,"""The Big Kahuna"" has not generated anywhere near the  audience it deserves.  Originally a play by Roger Rueff who also wrote the screenplay, the movie regrettably has a rushed quality about it that is most likely due to the fact that Kevin Spacey could only devote a relatively short period of time to the project. Nevertheless, the talents of both Spacey and Danny DeVito more than make up for this defect. Also, the acting ability of the virtually unknown, Peter Fucinello, should be held in high regard.  Fucinello aptly performed the role of the awkward, immature, and existentially challenged young sales representative, Bob.  I might also add that Fucinello's portrayal of an ill at ease young man may not have been much of a stretch.  Fucinello in real life probably felt intimidated performing along aside two of the greatest actors of our era.  The story line has these three gentlemen attending a business conference in Wichita, Kansas, for the sole purpose of obtaining a meeting with the sales prospect, Mr. Fuller, ""The Big Kahuna,"" to propose the qualities of their firm's manufacturing lubricant.
I sensed a pervasively anti-Capitalist theme throughout the pursuit of ""The Big Kahuna.""  Was it merely my imagination, or did Roger  Rueff desire to portray the younger Bob as more virtuous and idealistic than either Larry (Spacey) or Phil (DeVito)?  The latter are supposedly hard bitten, somewhat cynical, and overly devoted to closing the big sales to the point of ignoring the larger concerns of life.  Yet, I perceived both Larry and Phil as essentially decent men who took good care of their customers. I also know from first hand experience that neither a sales person or their company survives in the long run if the customer's requirements are not met. The younger Bob was actually the unethical one who had no problem cashing his employer's paycheck while focussing primarily upon the mysteries of the universe.  Bob should be doing such navel gazing on his own time. Was the audience suppose to conclude that manufacturing lubricants are not of real value to the world?  How would one feel, for  instance, if a surgeon opted to discussing religion or philosophy instead of operating on his seriously injured patient?  ""The Big Kahuna's"" company may have  desperately needed this lubricant.  Both Mr. Fuller and Bob were outrageously selfish in placing a higher priority on discussing the ultimate mysteries of life over their immediate  responsibilities to their respective business organizations.  I would be furious, if I worked for Mr. Fuller, at the flagrant disregard of his obligations  towards the company.
The reader should not mistake my reservations concerning the message Roger Rueff perhaps wanted to convey as a belittlement of the movie. I truly admire Rueff's work.  Furthermore, It is not at all unusual for members of the audience to interpret the story differently than  the author may have intended.  ""The Big Kahuna"" is a must see movie for all those earning a living.  The vast majority of us are confronted everyday with the dilemma of where to draw the line between the professional and personal aspects of our existence.  This near masterpiece assist us in  addressing these unavoidable issues.",974073600,,3242,5.083175803402646
1107995,4,6305968896,"If there is one realization you take from this acute gem, then it would be this: In this world, there are those who preach, and those who listen. What The Big Kahuna amusingly, movingly and effectively argues is that a ""preacher"" need not be selling a religion. An ideology will do. Industrial lubricants will do. So how much buying and selling do you really do? Have you ever tried to convince someone of your worldview? Have you ever accepted and then adopted a point of view that was not your own? So how much buying and selling do you really do?
  As a veteran film fan, I can assert that Wichita, Kansas is an acronym for ""nowhere"". In this nondescript environment enter three archetypes, the cynical Larry (Kevin Spacey), the religious and bible quoting rookie Bob (Peter Facinelli) and most importantly the reflective Phil (Danny De Vito). He is depressed, confused, less hungry for the deal and unlike Larry and Bob, he has nothing to sell. The Spacey character's most primal objective is to find the ""Grand Kahuna"", the big wallet who's going to make this trip worthwhile. For Spacey, who could not be uninteresting if you had a gun to his head, this performance is a particular standout. Not only is Larry more relaxed and human then most of the diabolical intellectuals he usually plays, but this time he laces his sardonic comments with a superficial ease that could only be attained when someone is making a pitch. As for Bob, his quotation of scripture,  and bland reflective demeanor are also a pitch. He wants to sell them on his idea of ""goodness"". For the time being Larry seems to be winning the battle of words with his slick one liners. But give the kid time, he will learn and he will sell.
  Crucial to the film's power is Phil. Lacking the pedagoguery that justifies the other two's existence, he is depressed. Even suicidal. An intelligent being can not live without a philosophy, religious or otherwise. He has lived long enough, or just lived enough to know that the philosophy he used to ascribe to, the philosophy Larry still ascribes to is flawed. He is intelligent enough to know that if he chooses Bob's way of life, then it too will reveal flaws. We all need something to believe in and keep in mind that atheism, rejection and pacifism are also beliefs. De Vito has this wonderful scene, the best acted scenes so far this year, where he recalls a dream he once had about God. I will not describe the scene here, but you will know it when you see it.
  Some will find the prospect of a film set mostly in one room unappealing. But if anything, The Big Kahuna proves that with superior writing, great performances you don't need the scenery. Indeed, in comparison most films seem hide behind their scenery, their special effects and their nudity to obscure their emptiness. To put it bluntly, the film not only has an unexpected emotional punch but is also entertaining as ""hell"".
  The film's most revealing scene contrasts religion and common sense. What is to ""love"" and what it is to just ""like"". Phil asks Larry ""Do you love me?"". Larry responds ""If you mean `would I die for you, would I jump out the window if you asked' then no. I don't."" Had Larry made their affection and friendship a religion, he probably would have jumped. It's up to you to decide whether that is a good thing.",972518400,5,3322,4.607445008460237
1107996,5,6305968896,"This refreshingly intelligent film delivers raw intellectual power by retaining the look and feel of the play from which it was adapted.  The use of a single set and just three actors throws the emphasis entirely upon the in-depth character studies, the incisive dialogue and the actors' outstanding performances.  It draws us into the lives of three seemingly ordinary guys at a convention whose interaction broaches questions that are nothing short of an examination of the meaning of life.  The dialogue unabashedly strips the characters naked to show the ironies and hypocrisies inherent in their strategies for establishing meaning in the machinations of mundane lives.  The laser sharp exchanges slash relentlessly at the souls of each, leaving none of the characters intact by the end of the film.  And with each thrust, they drive another introspective probe deep into the psyche of the viewer.
The presentation reminded me a little of ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" with its theatrical feel and deep reflective tone, although this film was more confronting and less darkly despondent.  Roger Roeff's penetrating script approaches the meaninglessness of life from three unique perspectives.  We have Larry (Kevin Spacey) the seemingly superficial cynic who has far greater depth than he lets on and who uses his sardonic persona as a defense mechanism to hide his own fears.  Phil (Danny DeVito) is the pragmatic but jaded salesman who is great at putting things in perspective for everyone but himself.  Bob is the nave young Christian zealot whose antidote for the futility of life is a strong dose of Jesus.
The juxtaposition of Larry the cynic and Bob the idealist makes for numerous thought provoking exchanges, especially when we learn that Phil (our mediator and voice of reason) is drowning in his own soul-searching quest for meaning.  The story poses more questions than it does answers, and sputters a bit at the end, but overall it accomplishes its purpose of making the viewer ponder profundities easily ignored while in the pursuit of everyday priorities.
The acting was brilliant.  Kevin Spacey gave what I thought was the best performance of his career.  This was so much more interesting and meaty a character than he played in ""American Beauty"" that Spacey easily eclipsed even that outstanding performance.  Larry was such a dynamic and complex character, that Spacey was able to open up the throttle and show us the full measure of his considerable talents.  Likewise, Danny DeVito delivered a personal best in a serious dramatic role.  His portrayal of the mediator who was trying to keep the peace while he was disintegrating inside was subtle and powerful.  Peter Facinelli was also near perfect with an utterly believable and sincere performance as the pure hearted whelp whose heart was suffused with the Lord.
I rated this film a 9/10, but it requires a certain type of viewer to enjoy it.  It is a very intellectual film, which precludes it from having much mass appeal.  Action junkies will be bored to tears.  However, for those who have a philosophical bent, this film will be highly satisfying.",971827200,,3124,5.078277886497065

Whether there is one message or many messages to derive from on the meaning of life the great thing about the Big Kahuna is that there is never a dull moment of dialogue or conversation. Kevin Spacey delivers a great and genuine performance as well as DeVito. The fantasy/imagination scenes are some of the most comical seen in any movie for quite some time. My favorite quote or dialogue from any scene is between Spacey and Facinelli about seeing what the young business man can bring to the table, ""You'll never know unless you throw me in the water and see if I can swim."" Spacey's character replies,""You're missing the point. We're going to throw you off the cliff and see if you can fly!...""Also, Devito's monologue speech about his dream or nightmare he had as  a child of God hiding in the closet is classic.

All the other people we see serve as a kind of silent backdrop before which the three principal players enact their complex personal drama.
Kevin Spacey, in a truly brilliant performance, plays Larry, a middle-aged, sardonic salesman who sees life strictly from the perspective of a hardcore cynic and who, consequently, runs roughshod over his two business associates with his acerbic wit and hardnosed bluntness.  In total contrast is Bob (Peter Facinelli), a 20-something neophyte to the selling business, a sincere, well-intentioned, but hopelessly nave born-again Christian, who has trouble separating his career as a salesman from his felt need to fulfill the Biblical edict to go out among men and spread the Good News.  Caught between the two is Phil (Danny DeVito), a 52-year old man who, after years of devoting his life to the cause of selling, has begun to seriously question the validity of his life's work and has, therefore, recently found himself contemplating such weighty matters as suicide, the existence of God and the meaning of love and friendship.  Obviously, such cleanly delineated characters could well have slid over into two-dimensional stereotypes, yet the author, Roger Rueff, in adapting his play to the screen, has built into each of the three principal figures a dimension of multifaceted human complexity.  Larry, for instance, despite all of his facile cynicism, shows a far deeper side to his character when, in a quiet moment in which Phil pours his heart out to him, he offers his buddy the hand of genuine compassion and friendship.  We discover that the often-bitter tone Larry displays to the world is just a faade, a cover-up for the void that lies deep within his own troubled psyche.  Similarly, Rueff avoids the common trap of reducing the devout Christian character to the customary level of a mindless buffoon.  Although we sense that Bob too uses his Christianity as a way of ordering his life - thereby avoiding the messy ugliness that a more freethinking life often requires - yet, Rueff merely implies that Bob has some growing up to do, not that his belief system must itself be jettisoned.  And Phil, caught between these two worldviews, provides, out of his own confused weakness, the voice of reasoned sanity that helps Larry and Bob come to a final understanding and mutual appreciation of each other.  He sees Larry plainly for who he is, yet Phil knows that this is the person who means more to him than anyone else in the world.  Similarly, though he somewhat admires and respects Bob's sincere devotion to his Christian principles, Phil knows that Bob has a long way to go before he becomes a true ""man of character.""
""The Big Kahuna"" does not provide big laughs, though the sardonic wit often strikes a deep chord in the audience.  The film may also seem claustrophobic to those who demand more movement from their movies.  The dialogue, however, is consistently sharp and incisive, even though Phil's final speech borders a bit on the pedantic.  (At this point, Phil's function as the author's mouthpiece becomes a bit heavy-handed to say the least).  Nevertheless, for those in search of a fine character study, driven by strong performances and insightful observations about human nature, ""The Big Kahuna"" is definitely worth checking out.",969494400,,3872,4.989130434782608
1108031,5,6305968896,"The basic motif was about how fundementalism breeds irony.  And while  Devito's character chose to ""think about God"", his approach came  off more as more enlightened soul looking at his own personal relationship  versus how most so called ""religious"" folks look at the own role  in spiritual growth to market their particular belief system.
Spacey's  character seemed to be enlightened already.  ""So far ahead that he  seemed behind"" so to speak.  His child like initiative spontaneous and  gut driven drove his character to a larger than life portrayal of the human  spirit.
All and all, if you don't like this movie, you most likely just  don't get it.  Go back to watching ""Who's the Boss"" and worrying  about your hair.",968630400,,723,4.916666666666667
1108032,5,6305968896,"I saw The Big Kahuna for the first time today on DVD and it's gonna stand  by me forever, ALL THREE the actors, just perfect! It's very difficult to  tell in a few lines were the film is about, Spacey is a very arrogant  person ( he play's him nice!) and Danny DeVito is playing the stars of the  roof. At the last I pinked a little tear away when DeVito looked a while  (almost)in the camera and was caming to a very impacting conclusion. Very  wise!

1108033,5,6305968896,"Kevin Spacey, Danny DeVito, and newcomer Peter Facinelli light up the  screen in a film where the action revolves around dialogue and not special  effects.  This is one of those films where it isn't even begining and you  know there is going to be some tension between the characters.  Spacey and  Facinelli are both in two different ball parks when it comes to selling  their lubricants.  DeVito is a referee of sorts and he gives probably one  of his best performances.

1108034,2,6305968896,"I was excited about the prospect of watching a film with Kevin Spacey and Danny Devito. My excitement was never fulfilled. The movie centers around  three individuals. Two veteran salesmen who despite being complete  opposites are the best of friends are in Wichita to smooze up to some  prospective clients. They are joined by a new face with the company who is  a young deeply religious baptist. The film starts with them waiting in a  reception suite and the whole film takes place their save two scenes with  no dialogue. I will concede that the acting is good all the way around.  Peter Facinelli holds his own with these two acting heavyweights. The  problem is that Devitos character is lonely and depressed, Spacey's  character is a pessimist without much faith in anything, Facinelli is a  wide eyed youngster with faith in everything. This collage of humanity goes  nowhere. No humor, no action, no storyline worth mentioning..... just human  interaction.
Overall, I was dissapointed and often bored, despite good  acting.  Rent it, don't buy it.",967680000,7,1056,4.994252873563219

1108036,4,6305968896,"In the spirit of ""Glen Garry Glenross"" we get this great dialogue-driven movie about desparate salesmen who are at difficult turning  points in thier lives.  A great cast and a great script make this a joy to  watch.  This movie was a wonderful next step for Kevin Spacey, with his  door now being wide open to do whatever he likes.  Danny Devito brilliantly  plays off of spacey's energy, creating a wonderful dynamic between the two.  There is very little that I didn't like about the film.  The only thing  that really bothered me about the movie was the song they played at the end  of the movie.  They really couldn't have picked a worse song to play, but  this terrible choice by the director was forgivable because the prior 99%  was so great to watch.  I am also very annoyed by the package design on the  DVD.  The picture on the front came from a rather weak point in the movie  that really doesn't portray the movie appropriately.  And the quote on the  front ""kevin spacey's performance is an american beauty"" is very  inappropriate.  Spacey's performance is fantastic, but it shouldn't be  compared to American Beauty.  The two movies are simply too different.  Otherwise, this one is a gem, and I will welcome it into my DVD collection  with open arms.",966729600,,1266,4.615384615384615

First he went gloriously ballistic with a plate of asparagus during his Oscar-winning performance in American  Beauty, and now, in The Big Kahuna, he launches into a raging fit over  canaps. Holding up a carrot stick, Spacey snarls, ""You call this hors  d'oeuvres?""
Spacey plays a salesman who, along with two colleagues  (DeVito and Facinelli), is holed up in a hospitality suite in a hotel in  Wichita, Kans., while waiting to sweet-talk prospective customers (big  kahunas) into buying his firm's industrial lubricants. Despite showy  performances by all three actors, this talky drama about the lives and lies  of businessmen never transcends its static, stage-bound roots.",966556800,2,716,5.274336283185841

They're supposed to be intellectually interesting & reflective of a portion of society (in this case salesman). So, as usual, Kevin Spacey & Danny DeVito don't miss a beat.

Of course, being supplied with some of the best dialogue this side of David Mamet doesn't hurt and they both make the best of it - not squandering a line.  What starts off as what seems like it's going to be Tin Men II, turns into ""Nausea"" as if written by Mamet himself. After a somewhat disorganized for half-hour or so, the dialogue takes off and doesn't let up. Soliloquies to die for delivered fabulously by BOTH Spacey and DeVito.
