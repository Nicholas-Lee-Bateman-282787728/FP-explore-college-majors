5103446,4,B007PNLIME,"I go to Zumba classes and have like 20 exercise DVDs at the house.  I would say I am burnt out on exercise, but I like Tracey so I thought I would give her latest DVD a try.  I have done it 3 times and can't get through the whole DVD; my thighs start aching.  This is a really good workout; you wouldn't think so by looking at the moves while sitting down but these moves really work you out.

The only issue I have is this lady named CHRISTINE; she dances funny and she is distracting.  I don't understand why she was chosen for this video.  Her Salsa is particularly horrible.

The BEST move is RIDE THE HORSE; my thi0hs are killing me.  Another great move is the one where you twist your arms and legs (hip hop move).  This DVD is great because the moves are not complicated at all, not strenous at all, or anything like that but if you don't ordinarily work the parts of the body this DVD works you will be tired.  I do about 20 minutes and call it a day.

Also great is that she does the moves barefeet which means NOT HIGH IMPACT.

I recommend this DVD for people that like to do moves that work the body but you are not huffing and puffing while doing them.

My LIVE Zumba class has me huffing and puffing and jumping around and that is definitely too much for the house and my carpet; this is perfect for me and the carpet.",1337904000,27,1331,4.0926640926640925
5103447,5,B007PNLIME,"My favorite things about this workout are Tracey and her background dancers - they are genuinely having fun and are working hard.  Its nice to see especially since two of the ladies are trained dancers and two of them are not.  I personally love Tracey's Booty Barre DVDs as I have a ballet background.  This is a totally different type of ""dance DVD"".
The first workout consist of different types of dance circuits ending with cardio intervals.  She chooses dance moves that tend to come naturally to the body.  She takes the time to explain the steps and then puts them all together.  The moves range from funk to ballet.  For the cardio intervals, think football drills and side to side leaps with ballet arms.  It is all low impact.
For the second workout, she keeps the dance theme (obviously) and uses light weights to sculpt the arms.  Think ballet and yoga arms - graceful type moves.  Between weight circuits she will throw in some cardio intervals.  These are dance type intervals with lots of hip swings.  Its actually a fun workout.  Something you would want to do with your girlfriends in the living room!  Enjoy!!",1337558400,18,1127,4.683673469387755
5103448,5,B007PNLIME,"You can exercise and get fun at the same time :) Great exercises, a little ruff at some points, but u have a time to catch your bread and continue :)",1367798400,,149,3.838709677419355
5103449,5,B007PNLIME,This is a lovely balanced workout for intermediate exercisers. Advanced exercisers might want to do this on rest days or when your looking for a break from heavy weights and cardio.,1366243200,2,181,4.870967741935484
5103450,5,B007PNLIME,"Tracey Mallett and her Booty Barre series are my go-to's for my workouts. I love every Tracey Mallett video I own, including this one.

This particular DVD is not the most frequent in my weekly routines, as it is less challenging than the BB series, but I still find it enjoyable. The production quality is top-notch, the cuing is spot-on, and the choreography is easy to follow.

I incorporate the Total Toned Body workout on this DVD (the workout with strength training incorporated, primarily upper body) about once a week. I also do the Interval Fat Burn occasionally when I'm looking for a less grueling workout on my cardio days. I have found it difficult to find the perfect ""dance"" DVD. I have a dance background so I enjoy the more challenging routines in other dance workout videos, but by the time I have learned the routines, I have lost interest and have barely worked up a sweat. This may be a beginner routine, but you never stop moving. I also have a few places in the slower sections of the routines that I ad-lib a little bit to burn extra calories.

One suggestion: wear light shoes (I wear jazz shoes). I would describe this workout as ""moderate impact"" rather than ""low impact"", and shoes will help for safety purposes.",1361836800,6,1240,4.627272727272727
5103451,3,B007PNLIME,"I thought this dvd was just okay. I personally didn't like the moves (too basic/boring for my taste) and it didn't make me sweat compared to other exercise routines. I think it is okay for beginners. However, I didn't think it was this much low-impact because there are some jumps and you have to twist your feet quite a bit too (be careful with the knees). Using dance shoes may help instead of barefoot.",1360368000,6,405,4.486486486486487
5103452,5,B007PNLIME,"My workout DVD collection is huge!  I'm always looking for something new....this is my new favorite!  I never comment on these but I JUST finished the entire DVD, 60 minutes, and burned 624 calories!  I am working through neck and knee injuries and I am thrilled to have found a workout that doesn't require pounding on my bones!  Thank you Tracey!",1359158400,16,348,4.655737704918033
5103453,5,B007PNLIME,"I am a Tracey Mallett fan, and this is another of her great work-out routines.  Tracey produces some of the toughest routines for women, but she keeps them interesting and fun.  You can be in terrific shape by sticking with Tracey.",1356652800,,231,4.609756097560975
5103454,5,B007PNLIME,"I have done this workout now about 6 times and I am really liking it. I alternate it with the Booty Barre.

I was looking for low-impact but effective with muscle toning and fat burning and I think this was a great choice for me. Especially alternating with the Booty Barre I've had great results!

Although the description says 2 workouts, I just consider this to be a single hour workout. It seems to me that it was intended to be done as one workout and that the whole ""2 workouts"" thing is just marketing.

Part 1 is the cardio dance section and is a fun mix of different kinds of moves. It gets your heart-rate up and gets you warm for part 2.

Part 2 is my favorite, I love her toning moves and I always feel I've had a great workout afterwards! Also I definitely see positive results from doing this and the Booty Barre.

I definitely would recommend this dvd, especially to Tracey Mallet fans - she is a fun personality and I love her attitude, it makes it very enjoyable to do her workouts.",1349827200,8,999,4.292553191489362
5103455,4,B007PNLIME,"I have done workout DVDs at home for about the last 4 to 5 years and consider myself moderately fit. I really liked the uniqueness of this dance workout by Tracey Mallett.

The moves in the first half, which was a dance inspired cardio routine, were different enough that they weren't boring but familiar enough that I was able to execute them on the first try. The only warning I would give is to keep in mind that without warning that it is coming, the last interval is a retread of everything that came before so try to keep that in mind as you go through the moves.

The second half of the workout uses weights, but keeps with the dance theme. Additionally, there are some floor moves.

The menu allows for the two halves of the workout to be done independently, but keep in mind that there is no separate stretch or cooldown for the first half and they are clearly intended to be done together.

This is not necessarily a must have if you already own lots of other cardio dance workouts, but I definitely think it is a fun addition to my collection that I will use often.",1343520000,10,1076,4.338308457711443
5103456,4,B007PNLIME,"I've been a fan of Tracey's since trying her Booty Barre workouts so I was happy to see new workouts released.  The DVD is labeled as 2 workouts but they are set up to be done together.  The 1st workout has a warm-up but no cool down/stretch.  The 2nd workout starts without a warm-up but has the stretch.  No big deal, just pointing it out.

Workout 1 - All cardio with no weights.  At first I didn't think it would be much of a workout, but I was sweating mid-way through.  Tracey's cueing is a little off in this one, the background people seemed to have a hard time following her too.  Some of the moves felt a little awkward -- I'm tall with long arms and legs so maybe it's just me!  Still a fun dance workout.

Workout 2 - Mix of weights and cardio.  I think this workout is the better of the two.  I enjoyed the moves in this one and felt like I was getting more of a workout. My arms were burning by the end using 3lb weights. I will probably end up doing this workout more than the 1st one.

Overall, I thought it was a good, fun workout. If you enjoy dancing this is a good workout choice.  Tracey is encouraging and fun without being annoying.",1339027200,2,1155,4.121076233183857
5103457,4,B007PNLIME,"I just got done doing this for the first time, and it's another lovely offering from Tracey!  She is her usual darling, encouraging self in this workout, and she makes the workout fun.

Part 1 is 30 minutes long and it's a dance cardio section.  The description of this workout states that this section is done in an interval format, but there really weren't intervals in it.  This portion and the second are both done barefoot, so it stays pretty low impact.  I was just a bit disappointed since I was hoping that this would be tougher -- more on the level of the Booty Barre Total New Body workout -- than it was.  It didn't get my heartrate up very high, but it was fun to do.

Part 2 is also 30 minutes long, and it's a toning section that alternates weights with cardio bursts.  There was a definite upper-body emphasis to this workout, so I think it would pair nicely with Tracey's other new workout,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracey-Mallett-s-FuseDance-Cardio-Lean/dp/B007PMTDU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracey Mallett's FuseDance Cardio Lean</a>.  The moves were also different from either of her more advanced Booty Barre workouts and from Cardio Lean.  The last circuit segment concluded with a side plank move that caught me a bit off guard since that more advanced move didn't seem to fit in with the overall intermediate-level feel of the entire hour.  I used three-pound weights for this part (as do Tracey and the background exercisers), and felt nicely challenged.

The music is fine; it's mostly electronic instrumental, with a few vocal tracks mixed in.  It's not music I've heard in any other workouts, which is nice.  There is also one background exerciser who shows modifications for most of the moves, although in a few shots it was hard to see what she was doing.

Since I wasn't sure how to combine these two new workouts, I asked Tracey on her Facebook page, and she said that it would be good to alternate them every other day with her other Booty Barre workouts.

Overall, this is a fun workout that's nice for days when you don't want to do killer cardio.  I'm glad I got both this and her Cardio Lean workouts, and see myself using them a lot.",1338595200,5,2223,4.8853333333333335

8520558,5,B007PNLIME,What a fun work out! I was looking for a change from my fitness routine and wanted something with less jumping and pounding. This one fits the  bill and Tracie did a great job to incorporate a total body workout. The moves were not difficult but effective- the cardio segment made me sweat and was not hard to follow. The cardio sculpting segment for part two kicked it up a notch and ended with a quick ab workout. I am so glad I bought it and didn't listen to the negative reviews. You feel so good after doing this video! Was so much fun! Thank you Tracie! Wish she would come out with more workouts as this one.,1464998400,,615,4.211864406779661

8520560,5,B007PNLIME,"I have done Zumba in the past but I am pretty uncoordinated and cannot dance, I am also very out of shape. This dvd is 60 minutes, I have done it twice so far and I can only make it through to 50 minutes.  It includes the cardio portion ""interval fat burn"" and a second section that uses 2-5 pound weights called ""total toned body"".This dvd is fun, and it is a total body workout. There are a few moments that go very fast that I need more practice to do perfectly but even if you don't do the exact move and just March out the parts you can't physically do you get a great workout.  There were several exercises that I just couldn't do another set of lunges and instead I just marched it out for a minute. This is a great dvd and I look forward to doing it, despite how sore it makes me! It works!",1452124800,,798,4.012578616352202

8520564,5,B007PNLIME,"I am a major Tracey Mallett FanGirl.  I have all her Booty Barre DVD's.  I am not super coordinated when it comes to exercising along to complicated aerobic dance or aerobic step routines.  First and foremost, I am a klutz so any routine that requires me to learn complicated choreography is a No-Go for me.  However, I know that cardio exercise is a key to heart health and burning fat.  I bought this after reading other reviews on Amazon and another website.  Most everyone had positive reviews for this DVD.  I have done it twice and I really enjoy working out along with the DVD.  I can't do all the moves at the present time but I am working on doing so.  The routine isn't complicated but I have a lot of weight to lose due to having a baby.  Sometimes, I can't keep up with everything she demonstrates but from what I can tell, the routine is not that hard once all the steps are memorized.  Of course, I have to be able to keep up and that is my goal.  I recommend this DVD if you have two left feet and hate dance videos.",1392422400,3,1031,4.204081632653061

8520566,2,B007PNLIME,"My mom and I have always done Jillian Michaels workouts and loved them, but I decided to try a new instructor. I read reviews and watched clips of this video and thought it looked like a good change. Well, I was wrong! Routine is difficult to follow and I did not feel I got a good workout. Instructor is nice and motivating but the workout does not live up to its name and certainly not worth the $20 I paid for it. If you like more of a laid back cardio dance routine this will do I suppose but if you like to feel like you've done something after a workout then pass this by.",1385337600,,578,4.034782608695652
