8467187,5,B005DLGVNQ,"The portrayal of the tsar is memorable, drawing to mind the Russian cinematic classic of Ivan.  Baluev totally captures the manic-depressive drive of a power-obsessed egotist -- a character so common to Russian history. The supporting portrayal of his duplicitous tsarina is equally magnificent. It is an action drama worthy of repeated replays.",1396396800,5,345,5.509433962264151
