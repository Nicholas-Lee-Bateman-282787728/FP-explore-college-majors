1698019,5,B0000640WU,"I am new to this whole workout thing. I tried this video after a co-worker suggested it to me. Denise is a little perky, but that's ok. The first time that I did it was without the resistance band. I got a great workout, but got an even better one after ordering the resistance band. The video is a mix of pilates, yoga, and Tai chi. The workout is 45 minutes long, fun, and easy to follow. At the end of the workout you'll feel energized and strong at the same time. The results are fabulous. Now I do this routine everyday and plan to buy more of Denise's videos.",1041897600,16,565,4.1454545454545455
1698020,4,B0000640WU,"After doing yoga for a year and pilates for the last 5 months I have tried many new programs to compliment my routine and Denise's Pilates For Everybody was a good next step for me!!  My core workout for 5 months has been Susan Deason's Pilates For Weightloss - A program I highly recommend for beginners! I lost 2 sizes using this program with a lo-carb diet, and the occasional addition of upperbody and cardio work.
Pilates For Everybody has an energizing warmup, and brings new challenge to familiar pilates movements using the resistence band.  I was not aware when ordering I needed the band !! I'm not used to seeing Denise on a studio set, I wished this was filmed in a beautiful location.  This program will have some very difficult movements for a beginner and not a lot of instruction for doing a less advanced version.  The leg-work movements I've been doing on a mat, Denise does standing with a chair, which causes me a little more back strain. The final cool-down is more energizing than relaxing so overall this program is in my rotation for those high-energy days when I need more challenge.",1041724800,40,1108,4.637755102040816
1698021,4,B0000640WU,"It would have been nice to know the majority of this tape requires a resistance band. I was lucky to find [an inexpensive one].
My intro to Pilates was Susan Deason's - Pilates for Weightloss and have been using it for 5 months.  I've gone from a 20 to a size 16 with lo-carbing and pilates.  I've tried several tapes seeking an intermediate workout to increase my results.  I don't recommend this program for beginners, but its the best intermediate program I found to add to my current routine. Unlike most Denise Austin workouts, it does not have a scenic backdrop, I wish it did.  It does have a very energetic warm-up that is great when you don't have time for the full workout. I'm sure this program will stay in my rotation for a long time as I continue to master the resistance bands and I hope it will increase my weightloss results.",1041552000,8,842,4.4480519480519485
1698022,5,B0000640WU,"This is an excellent workout, although I could do without the 10 minute warm-up. Denise moves from one exercise to another and manages to work every area - great leg exercises. She targets each area until it hurts and then moves onto to another. By the end of the workout, you have a nice sweat going. I like this video because I can get a great workout in under 30 minutes.",1037145600,6,374,4.28169014084507
1698023,5,B0000640WU,"I love Denise Austin's Pilates For Every Body.  I used to take Ballet classes when I was younger, and stopped for almost ten years.  I am now 23 years old and have started Ballet again.  I had heard that Pilates exercises can really improve dance technique. This workout has really improved my balance, my posture, my flexibility, and has toned and strengthened my abs and thighs.  My ballet has really improved and I have recommended this video to my other classmates.  This is a great video with realistic moves and Denise Austin is very enthusiastic and motivating.",1031443200,34,568,4.814432989690721
1698024,5,B0000640WU,"I am not a beginner, and I really like to get to it when it comes to a exercise video.  This is just a great total body workout.  The exercises flow very well, and move very quickly.  It's very easy to follow, but if you don't get things the first time, you'll catch on.  You will definitely need a long resistance band for this tape; one you can put both feet on and comfortably stand up straight with your hands over your heads.  She does not offer alternate exercises, and if you try to mimic what she does w/o the bands, you won't get the full workout.  I even broke out a little sweat!
Time-wise, this video is great.  It is about 45-minutes long, and perfect to squeeze in at lunchtime.
I also think that Denise Austin is very personable and enjoy her workout!  This was my first Denise Austin experience, and I want to try others.",1030665600,66,837,4.286624203821656
1698025,4,B0000640WU,"I bought this tape after using Ana Caban's beginner mat workout tape... It's much faster than Ana's workout and there is also the implicit assumption that you are familiar with Pilates moves. However, Denise gives great tips as you're doing the exercises and moves quickly from one exercise to another which I like since I've already spent some time mastering the beginner workout. I'd recommend Ana Caban's tape to anybody starting Pilates - she spends a considerable amount of time explaining basic concepts and teaching techniques before starting the workout and even during the workout. This is necessary for beginners and is missing in Austin's video.",1029456000,38,656,5.19811320754717
1698026,5,B0000640WU,"This is my third Pilates tape, and second from Denise Austin.  This is a great tape if you are already doing Pilates.  Denise introduces some great variations on familar exercises, and creates a very time-efficent and fun tape.  Get the exercise band, it adds a lot to the routine.",1023667200,24,281,4.6938775510204085
1698027,3,B0000640WU,"If you haven't done pilates before you will be lost.  Denise gives very little instruction for the moves.  Also if you don't like Denise's chattiness you won't like this video.  She talks incessantly and yet gives very little instruction.  You need a resistance band for some of the moves, but I did do them without one and still felt like I got a good workout.  Overall this is a very good workout for those who are experienced.  For beginner's, I'd recommend Kathy Smith's Pilates for Abs.  Although you won't get a full body workout, like you would with this video, Kathy gives very thorough instructions on working your core.",1022457600,46,629,4.715596330275229

This really works your core more than anything. I was definitely sore after the first time. The only thing is that you need a resistance band and the DVD does not come with one. Luckily I already had one at the house so I put it to use!
Denise is very motivating!! If you are looking to tone up this is a great workout!",1329091200,3,362,4.112676056338028
1698202,5,B0000640WU,"I took this DVD out at my local library and loved it so much, I went online to order it!  I have other Pilates DVD's which address specific body areas in 15 minute segments.  This DVD is more integrated.  Denise Austin's introduction to what Pilates is and what it does for the body was a great overview, as I had never really known this information.  Starting with her fun warm-up moves, this DVD keeps you moving along, all the while she is talking energetically and positively about the wonderful changes in your body, as well as how you are gaining strength, energy and other overall benefits.  This may be over-enthusiasm to some people, but I need this ""excitement"" and constant movement so as to stay motivated!",1326499200,7,718,4.666666666666667
1698203,4,B0000640WU,"Not for everyone, but still a fun workout, especially if you consider youself to be at the ""intermediate"" level in your pilates skill and fitness.

I have done pilates and similar workouts before, so I already felt familiar with most of the moves in this video.  If you have never done pilates before, however, I can understand how the video would be confusing.

On the otherhand, the video didn't give me as intense a work out as I get from the pilates class at my gym, but I did feel some burn. If you are a person who is very ""in-shape"", this video may not be physically intense enough for you.

Overall, I recommend this to anyone who is looking for an intermediate level pilates workout video.",1312588800,,698,4.47244094488189

1698205,5,B0000640WU,"I love Denise Austin and have a lot of her workouts. She has toned it down a notch in this one and is not over the top cheerful. I see a difference after doing this dvd for a few weeks as well as doing her other dvd's and will continue to do this workout. This is not for beginners and best for the intermediate.
It is broken down into 5 segments:
1st 7 minute dynamic warm up
2nd 18 minute pilates floor series
3rd 7 minute standing leg series
4th 7 minute upper and lower body exercises
5th 6 minute stretch

Don't give up after a week and say things are not working....it reshapes the body.

It is a strenuous work, but I feel so rejuvenated  and energized after each session.  I look forward to the way I feel AFTER the workout.  Perhaps beginners of Pilates should look at DVDs that give more instruction and then once proficient switch, but at some point this DVD is a ""must have"".

I do this DVD 3 times a week (sunday, Tuesday and Thursday). The floor set might be tough for some people, but I PROMISE you that if you just stick with it you'll be very very satisfied with the results. When I first started this DVD a few years ago, I saw results within a month. I naturally have muscular legs and if you do too than this is the perfect workout that will not add bulk. I'm extremely excited to have found this DVD again now that I've just had a baby. It really is Pilates for everybody no matter what level you are.

1698251,2,B0000640WU,"I have had this DVD on the shelf for a while. I bought it a while back when some friends and I started doing various yoga/pilates videos together regularly. We could hardly get through this workout without pulling our hair out and choking the television set, not to mention rolling around on the floor laughing. Denise Austin does not shut up for one single second. And the stuff she says is completely ridiculous -- very little instructional help but lots of cheesy encouragement and nonsense chatter. Eventually we started muting the TV and playing our own music, but pretty soon it found a nice place on the shelf to gather dust. I can't even remember the workout aspect, except that it was hard for some of us but not for others, but I'll never buy another video from Denise Austin.",1220832000,2,786,4.621428571428571

I feel lengthened, stronger and toned when I do it on a regular basis. I had so many people comment on my body once I had been doing this workout for a couple of months. For the first time in my life I actually felt 100% confident in a bathing suit PLUS it totally diminished my hard to get rid of love handles. This is a MUST have as far as I am concerned!!!",1211932800,,473,3.836734693877551
1698253,4,B0000640WU,"I agree with many other reviewers that this is not a beginner-level workout, but I also agree with the reviewer who points out that becoming more advanced is one of the goals of working out in the first place.  I am a very active person with moderate Pilates experience and I have no problem following this workout.  However, it is very fast-paced and contains little instruction on form, which may be frustrating for someone just starting out in Pilates/fusion workouts.

If you have some experience and are looking for new challenges, though, this is a good addition to your library.  The moves include classic Pilates (Teaser, Roll-up, Criss-Cross), classic ballet (Releve, Demi-Plie), and some Denise-created variations ... it's a nice blend and does a good job of hitting multiple body parts.  The use of the resistance band is optional; I use it most of the time and enjoy the extra challenge.  I like that this workout includes a lengthier warm-up and cool-down, both of which incorporate some Tai Chi.  Many Pilates DVDs are short on these elements, so it's great to have them (I even use them as single chapters before or after other workouts).

Now, a few negatives: first, again, the workout is very fast and while every ""body"" can technically do the moves, not ""everybody"" will enjoy the pace.  Also, Denise's enthusiasm is appreciated, but she really goes overboard here.  It wouldn't be a big deal if it were just an annoying trait, but the problem here is that it actually disrupts the workout.  She gets so busy saying, ""You look great,"" or ""Doesn't this feel wonderful?"" that she seems to forget to count reps (resulting in at least two sets in which one side gets worked longer than the other) and/or completely fails to cue new moves.  And, speaking of cueing, be forewarned that Denise assumes you are watching the TV - don't wait for descriptive cues or, sometimes, even a heads-up that she's about to change exercises.  It wasn't a big problem once I'd done the workout a few times, but it was frustrating the first time through.

The bottom line is that Denise is quirky and sometimes over-enthusiastic, but she puts together a great routine and reminds you to have fun while working out.  Despite its drawbacks, I think this workout is a good optionn for those who have some Pilates experience and are looking for a challenging fusion routine.",1200182400,8,2367,4.809876543209876

Beginners will not be able to do many of the moves on this tape. Even though I was in good shape from practicing yoga, I found some moves on this tape near impossible (t stand).

1698310,5,B0000640WU,This tape does some basic Pilates moves and incorporates the use of resistance bands and a chair or wall to support you.

1698311,1,B0000640WU,"I do yoga and have done some Pilates.  I've actually got a pretty decent core, but the advanced moves on this DVD are most assuredly NOT appropriate for EVERYBODY.  It's not even an issue of doing less repetitions, because Denise Austin isn't doing that many repetitions of each position.  She doesn't give alternate moves or direction for beginners at any point during advanced moves, and she acts as each move is so basic that nobody could have any trouble with it.  This is terrible for beginners, who aren't even going to know how to modify the moves on their own to make them appropriate.

""Every body"" would also make it sound as though the range of exercise was appropriate for somebody with physical limitations.  I have a mother who is short one abdominal muscle due to having tram reconstruction, and she has even had to undergo hernia surgery as a result of only moderate activity.  I could never recommend a DVD like this for her, despite the fact that Pilates in the hands of a good trainer is wonderful for rehabilitation or for those with limitations.  The reputation of Pilates for those purposes only serves to add to the danger of this poor presentation, and I sincerely hope nobody really injures themselves as a result.

The bottom line is: Don't just listen to condescending remarks from someone who thinks they know what everyone's body is capable of or that everyone has innate knowledge of how to adapt Pilates even without any form of instruction.  If you are a beginner, out of shape, or have any physical limitations... please don't judge this DVD by its title.  Find instruction from a good trainer or DVD that and will teach you correctly for your body.  Denise Austin's instruction is completely irresponsible, and the title for this DVD should be changed.",1170201600,6,1786,4.7817589576547235

Many other aches/pains have vanished, I often bore people with my long list of problems that have gone away since starting yoga/pilates. I am 35, not overweight, and feel better than I did at 20! I just started using her Personal Trainer DVD because I've been feeling the need for more cardio, I love that one too and will review it once I have used it for awhile.

But, the neat thing about a challenging workout is you can start slowly.  Denise always emphasizes form over speed and repetitions.  We all know that doing 2 repetitions WELL and in good form is much better than 10 sloppy, poor ones.  You can build up your strength and stamina over time.  Once you feel you have mastered and can keep up with her, get a thicker band and you will again be challenged.  At first, I got tired of hearing her talking throughout, but I learned I need her to remind me to hold those dang abs in constantly as I'll get caught up with trying to get my other body parts in the correct position.  It's like having a personal trainer with me.  I just play music from another machine and get busy.  The stretching ending is fantastic, too. I had 2 back surgeries this year and  was sooo limited in what I could do for 6 months.  I'm back to doing this workout and have my hamstrings almost stretched out to where they were before.

This is a reasonable pilates work out for those who have done pilates in the past and want to try something new. However I found the conduct of each exercise too fast for me. I like to do my pilates slowly, and each exercise seems to be dynamic rather than some done quite slowly.

There is little variation for beginnners who want to do simpler easier exercises. There was some brief discussion from austin about alternatives, but it is all done during the exercises, so it is of little use. It is definitely not for beginners either as it has no real discussion of how to hold yourself in the core, and anchor yourself to the floor. It is definitely a quick once over.

I enjoyed some variation on the routine which she offers in this, but it is not recommended for the beginner as a starter to pilates. There are some very good books which can get your started, I loved Brooke Siler's book which gave an excellent discussion of how to achieve the core exercises and alternatives.",1159488000,8,1115,4.434146341463415

I was not out of shape to begin with.  I walk regularly but wanted something to tone.  This really helped.

In response to the negative reviews: The resistence band works really great.  If the one your using is to tight, then find one that works for you.

I can't believe the fast results I have seen in the tone of my arms and legs after just two weeks!  The ab workout is excellent as well, I feel less flabby.  I have been doing this about 3 times a week altering with other pilates dvds.  I don't find Denise annoying, but encouraging.  The workout does use a band, and at first my band wasn't long enough, so I tied two together in a square knot, and that works great.

The exercises change often enough to keep me from getting bored.  I really love this video.  I can feel myself getting stronger, I work up a sweat, and get my heart pumping.

1698352,3,B0000640WU,"This DVD is far too challenging for anyone wanting to get started in Pilates.  Denise herself says that its not the number of repitions that you do, but the quality of the repititions that make the workout effective.  Now, I am a Denise Austin fan, so her chirpiness does not bother me.  In fact, Mari Winsor seems boring and uncharismatic next to her, but I would sooner have Mari Winsor instructing me on how to execute Pilates moves rather than Denise - simply because Denise jumps right into the exercises.

For cardio routines like the ones in Power Zone and Personal Training System, I am not so bothered, but Pilates is a form-based practice, and Denise just assumes that everyone will be able to mirror her movements perfectly and without causing injury.

However, there are segments to this DVD that have merit.  The dynamic warmup is a great way to wake your body up - even if you're not going to do Pilates.  I do it quickly as a warmup before I go to cricket practice, and in the morning before I have my breakfast.  The stretching segment at the end of the DVD I do in the evenings before I go to sleep.

All that being said, the workout itself is very challenging and I look forward to being able to complete it.  Though like I said, there is very little instruction, and I would consider it to be very unsafe to try and teach yourself Pilates from this DVD alone.  I recommend that you either go to a Pilates studio and learn the poses with an instructor since this is the best way, or do some of the Winsor Pilates DVDs before you do this one, or buy ""Pilates - Bodies in Motion"" by Alycea Ungaro.

This workout is good. They should rename it to 'The Pilates Challenge' or something more relevant. Its just not for everybody.",1131408000,13,1741,4.423197492163009

1698355,5,B0000640WU,"This is my favorite Denise Austin tape - just LOVE it!  Today, I'm a very fit  64-year old, thanks in part to ""Pilates for Every Body.""  For years, I'd concentrated only on fitness walking, gardening, and moderate-level exercises; without strength training, my body was aging way too fast:  Before hiking up my fitness levels with Pilates, weight lifting and Kundalini Yoga tapes, my abs and arms were weak, and my back and sciatic nerves, often injured.  So care was required, too.

Even so, I found ""Pilates for Every Body"" just right for me.  At first, I went easy at things that were hard.  What's important is to keep at it:  Modify where needed, but just keep going!  After several months of alternating ""Pilates for Every Body"" with Kundalini Yoga tapes (Favorites: Kundalini Yoga with Gurmukh, and Kundalini Yoga with Grace & Strength with Carol Carlson), I've literally transformed my whole body!

As Denise would say, ""You're STRONG!  You're LEAN!,"" people that hadn't seen me in awhile couldn't believe it was the same person.  My abs and arms today are stronger and my body's leaner than before childbirth (!), there are no more ""back attacks"" or sciatic nerve problems, my upper back no longer curves, + I have incredible balance and feel graceful and powerful with every move that I've mastered.

Unlike any of my other DVD's I would do this even if it did nothing for my body because it is really enjoyable.

1698358,5,B0000640WU,"I recommend this DVD to anyone and everyone, no matter what your age or fitness level is. I used to be a workout maniac for a few years, but my busy college lifestyle kept me from working out and eating healthy, causing me to pack on a few pounds. A few weeks ago, I decided I wanted to do something about it, and I started off with this DVD--and I am SO glad I did. I haven't shed much weight, but I definitely feel so much better about my body. I have more energy the days that I do pilates (3-4 times a week), and what I'm most proud of is that my abs have gone in considerably since starting this workout. Granted, bringing in those abs also requires that you eat less and healthier, but pilates has definitely helped tone them up.

What I really love about this DVD (and Denise Austin in general) is that she's so perky and encouraging. Some people don't like this and find her rather annoying, but I think you should just take her super-positive attitude as a caring one. Whether or not she really does, I don't know...but I like to think that she does, and it helps me get through the entire workout when I don't really want to. :) While I said earlier that I didn't lose much weight from it, it's still a fantastic workout that DOES get you to sweat quite a bit, and by the end of it all, you're quite glad that it's time to stretch.

If you're a beginner who wants to lose weight, do some over all toning, or just be more fit overall, this DVD is perfect. I'll say this though: We all have different bodies and levels of fitness, and some beginners will find this perfect for themselves, and others might find it a bit difficult. If you do find it a bit hard in the first workout, don't be fazed. You need to do the workout a few more times to get the hang of it (at regular intervals, of course. It won't help to use this DVD once a month) and I am positive that you'll find it easier the 2nd or 3rd time around. Lastly, while I swear by this pilates DVD, I'll be the first to admit that this workout alone will not give you a healthier heart and turn you into a size 0. To get a full, thorough workout to improve your health, you really need to combine this with cardio workouts (like kickboxing, jogging, etc..) and weight lifting. If you're at a level where you can pace yourself and mix around all these workouts, go for it. If not, start off with pilates and slowly work in these other workouts later.",1118448000,15,2416,4.193548387096774
1698399,3,B0000640WU,"This video is approx 40 minutes of pilates work. Denise uses a resistance band and it makes your muscles tone faster. If you are more advanced it is not a terribly hard workout, but it does give you good toning results.
It focuses mainly on the upper body and abs and less on the legs.
7 minute warm up/stretch
18 minutes of floor work on arms and abs (some using resistance band)
7 minutes ballet with a chair for balance
7 minutes arms with some leg work thrown in and use of resistance band
6 minute stretch which is more for mind relaxation and to get tension out than to stretch out the muscles that may be sore the next day. You will probably want to do more stretching.

I have found that Denise motivates me and calms me. I don't mind her chatter throughout the workout, it gives me something to focus on instead of how many minutes are left.

You do not need a resistance band for this video, you can do all the required moves with light hand weights or soup cans if you are just starting out.",1109289600,10,1002,4.2408376963350785

If you haven't done Pilates before, it will take a couple of workout sessions for you to figure out the moves, but give it a chance and keep trying. This tape isn't for those who are already intermediate or advanced with Pilates. It's more for beginners who already have somewhat of a fitness level. But don't let being out of shape stop you from trying. If you can't do the moves at first, there are modifications that you can do instead until you can do the full move. Some moves like a full T-stand are difficult, but easily modified.

Some of the Pilates moves are done standing up, which is a change from most Pilates workouts. And for beginners, the moves will seem awkward. But you will see results.

As usual, if you don't enjoy Denise Austin's chatter, then turn the sound down and just follow the movements. She doesn't chat up too much in this workout though. It's a great introduction to a Pilates-type workout for those just starting.",1107216000,4,1069,4.621052631578947
1698401,2,B0000640WU,"The title of this DVD is misleading.  It implies that anyone can do this workout, which is most certainly not the case.  Perhaps Denise Austin is so out of touch with reality she doesn't realize that most people are not as strong or flexible as she is.

I have been doing Pilates at a studio for 5 months.  The classes were getting to expensive for me so I decided to start practicing at home with rented DVDs.  I would consider myself a low intermediate at pilates.  I found that this DVD used too many difficult moves that even I can't do, and Denise acted like they were nothing and provided few to no pointers on proper form (T stand, teaser).  If you are new to pilates and don't already have strong abdominal muscles you will probably injure yourself trying to do these moves.

Overall I did not feel like I got as good of a workout from this DVD as I get from my normal routine, because I could not get in all the positions properly.  The workout also uses a resistance band, which I tried to use, but apparently my band is not as flexible or long as hers, because I could not get the same range of motion as she did and therefore the exercise did not have as much effect.  If you are relatively new to Pilates then I would not recommend this DVD.  Perhaps a more advanced practitioner would get more out it.

Unless you like some shrill, harsh little voice telling you ""That's it"" and ""Let's see that beautiful smile"" over and over, you will too.  A resistance band is highly recommended, and is some nice soothing music to listen to over her.  I would not recommend this to anyone who is just started with pilates.  Unless you are a dancer or have been doing yoga or pilates for while, most of the moves will be too difficult to do and understand for someone who hasn't had any exposure to this kind of movement.  Although they're on TV all the time and a little more expensive than most other DVDS, I think Winsor Pilates are the best.

For the floor workout you need to already have a strong upper body; I've done a basic pilates routine 4 times a week for 10 months now, but I cannot do some of her floor exercises - they hurt my arms & shoulders.  She gives no alternate poses for those with not-so-strong backs and shoulders (definitely not for 'every body').  I can get used to the voice (yes it can be annoying), but I'll have to look up some of the pilates and yoga poses in my referance books to find out the proper form, so not a good instructional video!!  Personally, I prefer the Windsor Pilates.  I love the basic 20 minute workout tape, and just ordered a set of 4 videos that focus on specific areas of the body.

1698443,2,B0000640WU,"I was very disappointed in this video.  According to the box the exercises use ""...correct form, proper breathing, and mental focus..."".  I did not feel properly instructed in any of these aspects.  Other pilates tapes have been signifcantly more instructive.  In particular, I found her form bad if not harmful to the back.  I would not recommend this.",1066176000,7,353,5.017241379310345
1698444,5,B0000640WU,"I've been doing Denise's Pilates for Everybody once a week for six months.  I ALWAYS feel taller and graceful when I am finished with this tape.  This is my first experience with Pilates and so far I like it.  As usual, I find her explanations helpful and I find that I continue to ""refine"" my technique by continuing to listen to her instruction.  There are two exercises that I still don't ""get.""  Both are done on the floor, the first is the one where you are sitting on the floor and you move the arms out to the side and ""dive forward"", the second is done lying on the back and making leg circles with the leg extended straight up. Everything else I understand what I am supposed to be doing and what areas are being worked.  The standing legs exercises are a challenge, but well worth the effort!
I've been exercising with Denise for a year now and I've gone from being a 49 year old couch potato to a 50 year toned and fit exercise nut.",1061683200,2,943,4.269662921348314

As a fitness trainer, I know about safety and positioning, and this Denise Austin video, as so mnay of her other videos, is totally unsafe. She continually puts the body in unsafe positions and brings danger to the joints.

1698446,4,B0000640WU,"After high school, I really didn't pay much attention to keeping in shape. I got a bit soggy in the mid-section and thighs. When a friend told me to try Pilates, I went straight for Denise Austin, knowing that her enthusiastic ""You can do it!"" attitude would help me. After one month of alternating this video with the mat workout video (seven days a week), I've had great results. Many of my coworkers and family ask me if I've lost weight. I lost maybe 8 lbs., but this video totally reshapes your body! My fiance and some friends have noticed a definite change in the size and shape of my thighs, my clothes fit better, and I feel great after this workout. Keep in mind, if you really want great results, you also need to do a bit of aerobics, like the Sizzler.",1057795200,3,764,4.34965034965035
1698487,5,B0000640WU,"As a person who hated to excersise, and I am saying that very strongly, I was very surprised to find myself addicted to Pilates. Denise's routine is complete from warm-ups in the beginning, floor work for the legs, to cool downs at the end. . Unlike Winsor Pilates, which is a mat based program, you are off the floor and moving. The result is toned abs along with all the muscles of the body.  I like it so much I wish she would make another since I have memorized this one.",1053561600,7,475,4.21978021978022
1698488,5,B0000640WU,"It IS a difficult workout but well worth it.  Denise's approach to Pilates is different.  In this video, Denise combines Pilates exercises with yoga, stretching and ballet.  She starts with a ""dynamic warm-up"" followed by ""Pilates floor work"" and ending with Pilates-based exercises standing up!  She does a terrific job of guiding you through the workout and helping you remember the importance of the ""natural corset.""  A must-have for those wanting a sweat-inducing toning workout that actually makes you feel like you've worked out!!",1049328000,14,537,5.345238095238095

Despite the fact that her voice is annoying, she never shuts up, and her instructions and postures postitions are vague, I did get a small workout.  However, this is truely for Beginners Only and isn't a true pilates workout.  Also it is decieving because it says you work the whole body but she focuses on the abs the most and doesn't do nearly as much with the thighs.  I am not a fan of physical activity and don't do it often, so I expected to be a little challenged, but not with this video.",1049241600,3,542,4.133333333333334

She always uses poor form, just like she does on her tv show. How does this lady sell vides?

1698491,1,B0000640WU,"This is the worst pilates video ever made.  Miss Austin is very good in her other videos but it is obvious to someone who is experience in pilates that she does not know nearly enough about this wonderful form of controlled movement excercise to teach it correctly.  Classical pilates  , Stotts , Winsor and Ana Caban's just to name a few, are very good . You can tell these people have studied Pilates for many, many years.

1698492,3,B0000640WU,"This was my first introduction to Pilates and this is probably a good place to start.  You can learn the basic moves that are required by more intermediate/advanced instructions.  Denise's instruction was a bit disappointing in that her directions weren't very clear.  Often these weren't given until you switched to perform the moves on the other side (leg, arm, etc.)and they weren't very clear.  At one point she instructs you to switch ars and legs when all you switch is what arm you're using.  I was suprised given what I've seen on her show.  However, after practicing 5-6 times, I was able to follow along and begin to incorporate new moves from other sources.",1045526400,6,668,4.815789473684211
1698493,4,B0000640WU,"I started pilates this year and I love it. I bought Denise Austin's mat based pilates and loved it. When I saw her new video Pilates for every body, I immedietly bought it.  It is a great 45 min routine.  The only downside is she goes rather fast and does not give much instruction.  Luckly, I had started with her mat routine video and I knew how to do the stretches.  I love the new video, but would suggest starting out with the 20 min. Denise Austin mat based pilates first.",1045526400,37,478,4.21978021978022
1698494,4,B0000640WU,"Boy, people either love Denise or loathe her. I'm in the former group. I NEED somebody who's positive and energetic. She gets my keister off the couch and that's what counts. I really like her new pilates tape. I have her other one as well. This video works your whole body. I love the way it seems to elongate me. ( I'm 4'9"", I need all the elongation I can get.) Some of the stomach (core) workout is quite a challenge (I've gotten a bit lazy), but I'll get there. I don't want an exercise tape that isn't gonna challenge me. What I like best about this tape is that it's just Denise. Other people, in some of Denise's other videos, I find distracting. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is due to the studio setting. I prefer the sand and the surf. Call me silly, but I enjoy Denise's Lifetime workouts better when she's outdoors. I can 'pretend' I'm there in Jamaica...as I sweat.",1043452800,25,894,4.3273809523809526
1698495,5,B0000640WU,"This would be my first video workout by Denise Austin, as well as being my first Pilates workout.  I've been exercising for years and this workout has proven to be, by far, the most challenging and effective I've tried in a LONG time.  Results are almost instantaneous, I noticed new definition, toning and slimming within the first two weeks.  The best aspect of the workout is that it uses a ""power band"" (which you can order through her website for [$$]--I wasn't able to find it anywhere else), so that it provides toning benefits without the added bulk.  The abdominals are great (you really feel the burn) and all of the exercises are foucused around the core abdominal muscles.  All in all, I highly recommend this video.  You will see results!!  I must admit, however, that the only downside is Denise Austin herself, and the almost creepy over-enthusiastic attitude she displays throughout the workout (you'll see what I mean).",1042761600,7,936,4.849056603773585
