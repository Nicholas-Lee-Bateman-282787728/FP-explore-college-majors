546059,5,6303039553,"The Emigrants
This film is a realistic portrayal of rural life in Sweden in 1844 and dreams of the peasants to emigrate to America. This movie portrays a hardscrabble life with hardship and tragedy in Sweden and the arduous journey to a new life in America. The viewer hears, feels, and sees close up what it is to work a farm by hand during this period and the details of the emigration to America. I am fascinated with this film. Its a true work of art.  Incredible cinematography with imaginative use of close upsiconic faces and images. Its poetry on celluloid and must see viewing.",1482624000,,586,4.580952380952381

546117,3,6303039553,I love this movie but the quality is not great as it was advertised.  I muddle through pieces of darkness.  Sound is good so it is a matter of the imagination for the picture.,1385856000,,175,4.117647058823529
546118,5,6303039553,"Beautiful filming, while telling a story it is poetry on film. The hardships they had to endure in the old country and the not  easy journey to America is what it is all about.  The whining cry babies of our time should see this and discover what their ancestors had to go through to get here.

The"" New Land "" is a sequel and just as good.  Look for it",1380153600,,353,4.0
546119,5,6303039553,"I first caught Jan Troell's masterpieces The Emigrants & The New Land through the poorly-dubbed versions Warners put out in the 90s on VHS, which were based not on the Swedish originals but on the heavily cut US theatrical versions originally released in the 70s. THe Emigrants was cut some 30 minutes from its Swedish counterpart, and The New Land was completely disemboweled with roughly 100 minutes cut. Despite the occasional abrupt or nonsensical transitions between scenes, even in those redacted versions the brilliance of the achievement of these films was quite apparent.

Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are hugely sympathetic in their roles. The dubbed versions are not recommended, but Sydow & Ullmann's wonderful performances shine through even with the unnecessary dubbing.  The grueling hardships experienced by this family, both in Sweden and in their new life in America,  are so extreme at times that the films often border on a comedy of horrors, but Sydow and Ullmann make these bleak episodes believable without resorting to histrionics. The film presents an almost documentary-like account of the hardships of these characters before they ultimately begin to prosper in Minnesota.

The films made me reflect on the American experience of a nation of immigrants etching a new life for themselves in North America. I came away from it with a greater love for America, and not in some jingoistic ultra-patriotic manner. I keep hoping the Criterion Collection will recognize the greatness of these films by adding the uncut, subtitled versions to their library. Supposedly, Liv Ullmann once said her favorite role was not in one of her classics with Ingmar Bergman, but as Kristina in these films. It is high time Americans, who should have a vested historical interest in these films, be allowed to see this epic in its original form.",1373673600,,1851,5.119205298013245

Not only Italians (well documented in many movies) have emigrated to the US: Scandinavian countries also produced a surplus population they could not really feed. Karl Artur Vilhelm Moberg (1898-1973) was a Swedish author, playwright and historian, most commonly associated with his The Emigrants series of novels, about Swedish emigrants moving to the USA in the 19th century; Jan Troell (born 1931) has turned a movie and a sequel, both in fine spirit, silent rather than loud or noisy, and with very good acting. The films are based on the first two novels of The Emigrants suite by Moberg: The Emigrants and Unto a Good Land. The two films have a real epic dimension which immerses the spectators.

At the 30th Golden Globe Awards it won the awards for Best Foreign Language Film and Best Actress (Liv Ullmann). In Sweden it won the Guldbagge Awards for Best Film and Best Actor (Eddie Axberg).

546123,5,6303039553,"I just wanted everyone to know that me and my family were in this movie. They were shooting a scene in North Freedom, WI and my Mom & Dad owned a bar there called The Melody House and the producers drove through the town and saw that we had this large bar with an upstairs and then they saw all of us kids (6) and they asked Dad if they could rent the top area for their dressing room and make up for the movie and Dad said sure. Then they asked if we all wanted to be in the movie as extras, and of course Dad said we'd love to. So my younger sister and I had to have our long blonde hair cut into pixie cuts to become little boys and we had to wear boys clothes and they had rubbed black charcoal on our faces and arms to make us look dirty, we also had to go barefoot and I remember the stones hurt our feet but we got used to it eventually. Everyone looked grubby and we were the family that was by the train getting on and off. We have newspaper articles of the train scene. The food that was served everyday was so delicious and you could eat as much as you wanted! We met Max Von Sydow and Liv Ullmann, very nice people by the way. We met so many nice people. We had to take a week or two off from school. Anyways, I just thought I'd share that with everyone posting comments about this movie. Growing up I loved sharing this story with family and friends!! When we finally watched the movie I couldn't believe what little part we were in the movie, you didn't dare blink because you might miss it!! We had to rewind it quite a few times to see ourselves. Now that was awesome. We watched it up in Green Bay at a theater a few years later. So let me know if you'd like my ""Autograph""!! Just kidding ;-)",1302480000,,1709,3.9854227405247813
546124,5,6303039553,"I saw this film in 1981 on my nations TV channel in Ireland, it was broadcast in three sections over a three week period.  This made viewing all the more interesting awaiting the next installment. I gives a great insight into Swedish life at this period in history and the hardships that forced these brave people to abandon their homeland seeking a better and fairer lifestyle. I saw it dubbed but I totally understand that by doing such you loose the authenticity and mood of a film by such actions, I would love to get the original version with subtitles.
It is such a relief to watch such drama as opposed to the garbage mind numming rubbish churned out by Hollywood, it is calm and leads you on gently scene by scene to the whole reason or story behind the film that been ;(their experiences when they arrive in America), I found no flaws or problems with this film as the makers of same know what message they intended to convey, despite seeing it almost 30 years ago it always stayed in my memory and the special feeling I got at this time. Hopefully I will be able to get it on DVD in in its original Swedish. it has a timeless character and a great educational tool for people of Swedish American origin.",1288396800,,1213,4.415178571428571

546170,5,6303039553,"I only saw the Swedish version (the whole series) and I am aware that some of the movie was cut. However, I believe I still have something to say.

This movie is based on a novel by the Swedish author and historian Vilhelm Moberg. The novel is based on his research and is therefore very realistic and historically accurate. It is depicting the experience of Swedish emigrants in the 1840's or 1850's. The main characters are Karl Oskar and his wife Kristina but there are also many other interesting characters in movie, for example, Karl Oskars adventurous brother Robert who goes to California in the search of Gold.

I am a modern Swedish immigrant to the United States. However, emigrating today is much easier than emigrating in 1850. I am not just talking about the amazing hard ships and dangers that Karl Oskar and Kristina had to face, but the fact that they left everything behind. Their young daughter died in Sweden, but they had to visit her grave one last time to never see it again. Emigrating in 1850 meant that everything you ever known would become just a memory. Think about that a minute.

The homesickness of Kristina was a major theme of the movie. Kristina was desperately homesick despite the fact that Karl Oskar and her succeeded in building a better life for their children and grand children. Kristina probably would not have been as homesick if she had emigrated today.

I think this movie is interesting for Swedes and many others, but the movie really speaks to all those Americans whose forefathers came to America long ago, at a time when emigrating was an awesome choice and often a heroic act. I believe this movie will make it possible for many Americans to connect with their long dead immigrant forefathers.",1176768000,,1746,4.733552631578948

546172,5,6303039553,"This timeless film shows how far the power of will of some human beings can reach under determined conditions and not precisely the most favorable ones .

Max von Sydow that splendid actor and the radiant and talented Liv Ullman , Ingmar Bergman' s  beloved couple actors make with Jan Troell a sublime masterpiece  and obviously and unforgettable and spellbinding film a previous or next year both movies would have reminded for many people .

546173,5,6303039553,This movie was great.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in American or Swedish history!,1056931200,,96,5.0
546174,5,6303039553,"Sweden is seen as the very model of a welfare state: modern, progressive, prosperous, manufacturer of sturdy and safe cars, inventor of the three-point seatbelt (with great public spirit and foresight ... not patented!), major exporter of advanced weapons systems, very attractive blondes, and a keen line in flat-packed home-assembly furniture. But Sweden was not always like that. The welfare state did not begin to develop into what it is today until the early 1930s, when the world-wide Depression following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 made its mark. Before then Sweden was primarily a pastoral country, slow to industrialize (even though the copper mines of Dalarna were then among the most valuable in the world), and as much the victim of famine and intolerance as anywhere else in Europe during the 19th Century.
Adapted from Vilhelm Moberg's novels, Utvandrarna is the story of Karl-Oskar Nilsson (Max von Sydow) and his family who, with others disillusioned with their infertile plot of land or seeking to escape religious intolerance and persecution, ""emigrated to North America from the Swedish province of Smland in 1844. At that time the parish of Ljuder had 1,925 inhabitants. There were 254 farmers who owned their land, 92 tenant farmers, and 11 tenement soldiers. 39 persons were artisans. There were also 274 servants, 127 paupers, 60 cripples, 5 halfwits, 3 idiots, 3 whores, and 2 thieves. Four men governed the parish by virtue of their spiritual and temporal offices - the deacon of the church, the sheriff, the biggest landowner, and the churchwarden. It was the same in all the other parishes.""
Beautifully filmed like a Timote shampoo advert (much like Bo Widerberg & Jrgen Persson's 1967 Elvira Madigan which entranced the eyes and ears), at times the film is both strangely hypnotic and a tedious grind. But Life was like that back then - no radio, television, Monopoly or Playstations, just too many mouths to feed (one of their children starves), bible-thumping pastors, dour expressions, bad soil, bad food, and morale-sapping, back-breaking labour for little or no gain. The enormity of the challenge awaiting Karl-Oskar Nilsson and his family on the plains of Minnesota becomes slowly apparent during the seemingly endless 10 weeks of the Atlantic crossing on an over-crowded sailing ship where seasickness, lice and melancholy took a further toll on those brave souls. After New York there were several more days of train travel, followed by more days on a river-steamer - along with more death. Until Karl-Oskar finds his 'promised land' ... and marks the tree to stake his claim.
Nybyggarna: ""But that was just the beginning. The pursuit of the dream had led them to the strange yet fertile and abundant land. It remained for them to try to tame it, to learn to live in it, and - hopefully - to prosper with it. The story of those years, those years that were to change them from hopeful wanderers to dedicated settlers determined to play a vital rle in the growth of a nation, is a story that describes America itself.""
Although life is better in Minnesota than it ever was in Sweden, it is still not without searing heartache and agonizing sacrifice. Through trial (extreme summers and winters, the Santee Sioux defending their homeland against the encroaching white man during the Civil War, and ever-present melancholia) and tribulation (Karl-Oskar loses another infant child, his younger brother Robert to gold fever and disease, and his desperately homesick wife Kristina [Liv Ullmann] to one pregnancy too many), the tedious grind finally sees Karl-Oskar's surviving children reach adulthood, take over the finally-prosperous farmstead, but an aged Karl-Oskar himself alone, lonely, melancholic and thinking of the ole country he left behind 20 years earlier ...
If one can put aside the often too noticable dubbing, perhaps you, too, can feel this as solemn, forceful, nation-building ... and moving.",1043971200,,3946,5.12888198757764
546175,3,6303039553,"Oh wow.....to be honest, I disregarded the other reviews here because I wanted to see this movie again so badly.  So, I convinced myself that it couldn't make THAT much difference dubbed instead of subtitles.  Boy, was I wrong!  It makes a very, very big difference in the authenticity of such wonderful movies.
Being of Swedish extraction from both my parents, I love to hear the beautiful lilt of the Swedish language in movies reproducing the lives of my ancestors.  Though I cannot enjoy this version as I could a subtitled one, I will watch it until I can find the subtitled version for myself.
""The New Land""..... the same review applies....except that many years ago I bought the subtitled version for my father.....and I will borrow his rather than watch it dubbed!
Two beautiful movies; and they lose so much with English instead of Swedish words.  As another reviewer said, it is just not believable to have a character speak fluent English through out a movie yet not be understood by other English speaking people!",1008201600,,1026,4.806818181818182
546176,2,6303039553,"I ordered the Emigrants (and The Land) after seeing The Ox (which is excellent).  I expected the Sweedish film with English sub-titles.  Instead it used English dubbed voices.  If the film were in the original format with the English sub-titles it would have been more interesting.  The dubbing was poor and it was difficult to hear what was being said.  When they finally did reach the shores of America it made no sense to have people asking questions in English to English speaking people and have them not understand.  While it was probably a realistic representation of the Sweedish immigration to America, it was also very slow moving and often seemed disjointed -- especially in the first half of the film.  Some of the dub-over dialogue was crude and sexually graphic and not appropriate for young children.  If you really like this type of film you may enjoy this release.  Still, I would recommend waiting for a release using English sub-titles -- I think it will greatly enhance your enjoyment of the film.",982627200,,1017,4.832369942196531

To make matters  worse, the only version available is an execrable dubbed version.
