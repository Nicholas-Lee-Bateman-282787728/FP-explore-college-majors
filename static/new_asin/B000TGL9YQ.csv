2899215,5,B000TGL9YQ,"Great box set!!!  We have a region-free player, so Region 2 is not an issue.  My family adores this series, and this was a good and reasonably priced way to get it.  Shipping was fast; product arrived on time and in excellent condition.  There are 2 discs per box; the little plastic bits holding them in were all in excellent condition.  If you've ever been interested in living a self-sufficient lifestyle on acreage, this is a treat to watch.  Highly recommended.",1358640000,,466,4.691358024691358
2899216,5,B000TGL9YQ,"I am so happy with this item.  I lived in the UK for a few short months, and fell in love with there TV.  I found this and paied well for it, but it was well worth the price.  I have just finished playing the 1st set of DVD's.  I have been able to hack my DVD player and reccomend that you go do a search on line to see if there is a hack for your DVD player b4 you purchase any item that is not in the US region.  But Hugh is a great down sizer and wonderful cook.  I think I'm gonna try his flap jack recipie.",1318032000,,511,3.6
2899217,3,B000TGL9YQ,"This item claims to be a 4-DVD set of all four of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall's River Cottage programmes. Unfortunately it contains only the first two series, Escape to River Cottage (6 episodes, no ""Christmas Special"") and Return to River Cottage (6 episodes). It does NOT contain any material from River Cottage Forever or from Beyond River Cottage, despite what the item title claims.

That said, this is still a pretty good price for two series, as the two titles presented here are both out of print and very expensive to obtain. The packaging and menus are in Hungarian, but the original English soundtrack is available. There are no special features included. Still, this seller should not be giving the impression that the latter two programmes are contained with this product, as they are not.",1236816000,4,802,5.030075187969925

8209232,3,B000TGL9YQ,"This is a good TV show that is well worth watching, but the audio quality is poor. It sounds like the audio was recorded in an echo'y room.

Also, BE AWARE that this DVD set is region encoded for the UK and is encoded PAL, not NTSC. If you do not have a region unlocked DVD player, you will not be able to watch this in North America.",1485907200,,334,3.911764705882353
