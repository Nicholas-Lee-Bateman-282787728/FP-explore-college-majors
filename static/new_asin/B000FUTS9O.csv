8348097,3,B000FUTS9O,"I was disapointed that they did not show the acctual factory in the making of PEZ section and also in the fact that it took FOREVER to scroll through the encyclopedia section.  I did enjoy the interviews of the Pez collectors at the convention.  This is a fun dvd, but not as fun as it could of been.",1232323200,,300,4.155172413793103
8348098,5,B000FUTS9O,"I am blown away by how detailed this disc is. It has loads of information about Pez dispensers and the history of Pez. My favorite parts were the documentary on Pez collectors, the behind the scenes of the animation, and the Trivia Game. I have never played a trivia game like this one on a DVD before. It definately offers a lot of replay value.

I would have liked to see more behind the scenes video of how Pez dispensers are made, but considering they have a interview with the President of Pez, the ""Pezident"", I can't really complain. Maybe they will do a new version of this disc in the future with even more awesome video.

Overall I highly reccomend people checking this disc out, you will really be blown away by what a DVD can offer.",1149120000,11,744,4.384057971014493
