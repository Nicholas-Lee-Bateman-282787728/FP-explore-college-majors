7958332,2,B0000633V1,i bought this dvd because it had NOFX on the cover. the movie is a cheasy story line with hardly any nofx influence. i never got into the movie because i was just looking for nofx entertainment. it seems to be a really low budget mtv teenage movie.,1231459200,,248,4.1875
7958333,5,B0000633V1,"Fear of a Punk planet is awsome. The Vandals really pick it up where they left off with ""That Darn Punk"" and keep the ball rolling strong. Joe plays a great lead role and is acompaned by Waren as always. This show breaks down into the lives of a few punks in the sad sack town of Mullet, CA and there fight to keep there local hang out. The show is funny, has great music, and even better preformances. I own it, love it and am waiting for season 2.",1063929600,4,449,4.0
7958334,5,B0000633V1,"When I saw that am@zon not only had no reviews for this video but no description as well, I knew I had to write this review. This Kung Fu records released movie is SLC Punk done right. Unlike SLC Punk this movie has a REAL Plot. It's also hilarious! Something that SLC Punk rarely was. Plus, after the movie it has exclusive live footage from NOFX, Sick of it All, Good Riddance, Ataris, and The Bounding Souls. This movie begins with NOFX playing live at a punk club called ""The Baby Seal"". This is a movie to say ""... authority"" to. Because you watch as the evil fire marshal abuses his power to close down the ""menacing"" punk club for so called ""sanitary"" reasons. Due to the claims the fire marshal put on, the club the club owner admits defeat. However, 4 punks: an Epitaph punk, crusty punk, Pop/Punker, and hardcore kid band together to save their scene. They re-open the Baby Seal as a non-profit organization so the city ordinances won't apply to it. You get to watch as the 4 punks conquer various obstacles on their way, argue about the meaning of punk rock, and create hilarious dialogue while doing it. Whether you like crusty, pop/punk or hardcore, this is a must have for any die hard punk rocker. You WILL be satisfied.",1024185600,6,1235,4.493333333333333
