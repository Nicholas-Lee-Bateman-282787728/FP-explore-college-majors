4649209,4,B005BXY1OW,"It seems to me the folks who dislike this new series most intensely are the most die-hard fans of the classic Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies films.  One reason why the character designs were changed for this show was to clue in viewers that this wasn't meant to be a direct recreation of the classics.  If you want the classics, they're also available on DVD -- and soon on Blu-Ray, in the form of the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection, which should be a real treat.

As for The Looney Tunes Show. . .  It's an animated sitcom with occasional diversions into the surreal and the absurd, in a similar mold as Family Guy or Rocko's Modern Life, one might say.  The pace is relaxed, and there's a lot of humor based on witty dialog and character interactions, not much based on explosions or pratfalls.  This show is aimed at an older audience, while still being viewable by kids.  Incidentally, kids would probably find Tiny Toons Adventures a lot more engaging -- and that series too is gradually being released on DVD sets.

Of the four episodes on this disc, I think the first is the weakest -- although it does the job of introducing the series, and the Goofy Gophers are used to good effect.  Episode two is one of my favorites, as it introduces the adorable-but-nutty Lola Bunny, an antagonist who Bugs's usual tricks just don't work against.  Episodes three and four are good, with Bugs and Daffy going to prison together (for contempt of court!) and then trying to keep Yosemite Sam from moving in with them.  The Merrie Melodies and the roadrunner shorts in each episode are fillers, but they provide a refreshing counterpoint to the dialog-oriented main stories.",1315785600,4,1671,4.688356164383562
4649210,4,B005BXY1OW,"You know their names, now see 'em in a brand-new series on Cartoon Network !  ""The Looney Tunes Show"" focuses on Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck living under the same roof making the duo look like ""The Odd Couple"" in some way.  Whatever the reason, this series is rather good, especially for Looney nostalgics and next-gen fans.  This DVD has the first four episodes with the first appearances of the following characters:

""Best Friends"" - Bugs and Daffy compete in a game show to see how much they know about each other.  Unfortunately, Daffy doesn't know anything about Bugs !
First appearance: Speedy Gonzales and the Goofy Gophers, Mac and Tosh (a lot of people don't know their names)

""Members Only"" - Daffy invites Bugs to a fancy country club.  There, Bugs meets the lovely, yet scatterbrained Lola Bunny who may or may not hit it off on their first date.
First appearance: Lola Bunny, Pepe Le Pew

""Jailbird and Jailbunny"" - After a case of petty littering in the Grand Canyon, Bugs and Daffy get thrown in the big house.  Daffy tries to escape, but Bugs seems to ENJOY his incarceration !
First appearance: Porky Pig (although he previously appeared at the end of the credits saying his famous ""That's all folks"" line.)

""Fish and Visitors"" - When the power goes out in his house, Yosemite Sam moves in with his neighbors, Bugs and Daffy.  Now the duo must get Sammy Boy out of the house before things get worse.
First appearance: Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam (this marks their first episodic appearance as those guys were previously seen in the ""Merrie Melodies"" music videos)

And if that wasn't enough, each episode has a ""Merrie Melodies"" music video and/or a ""Road Runner & Wile E. Coyote"" short !  The music videos include ""Grilled Cheese"" where the Fudd sings about his favorite comfort food and ""Blow My Stack"" where Yosemite Sam shows you how easily agitated he can get accompanied by some rather leggy backup singers.  The ""Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote"" shorts are new CGI-style escapades of the ""beep-beep"" bird and the so-called ""Super genius"".  The only one available is ""Bubble Trouble"" where the Coyote tries out a giant ball to catch Road Runner.  (Those bits sure make up for the lack of any additional bonus material.)

In conclusion, this series is very good for WB cartoon fans old and new alike.  Just don't forget to ""Tune"" into Cartoon Network for new episodes and more fun !",1314921600,2,2397,4.721153846153846
4649211,2,B005BXY1OW,"As a lifelong fan of Looney Tunes, I was intitially excited when I heard they were making a comeback.  Sure, most of the ""old guard"" from the classic years are no longer with us, but I though maybe the characters themselves were timeless enough to sustain a reinvention for the 21st century.

Then I watched the show.

I can deal with the different looks of the characters. . .every ""classic"" character is going to be subject to some re-interpretation.  I can even understand the premise: Bugs and Daffy are now roommates living in suburbia, and their neighbors are many of the old-time LT characters.  But where the show falls FAR from its roots is in the writing.  The thing is just NOT funny.  I'm not kidding, I will literally sit for hours and watch old Looney Tunes and laugh until I'm in tears.  But over the first few episodes of The Looney Tunes Show, I don't think I managed even a chuckle.

In theory, the ""Merrie Melodies"" sections (approx. 90 second musical numbers peformed by individual characters) is fairly original.  But again, there's little enjoyment to be had.  Others have been critical of the CGI Road Runner shorts (which last about 3 min.), but I actually found these to be much truer to the spirit of Looney Tunes that the hand-drawn main cartoons in each episode.  By the way, that hand-drawn animation is typical of today's made-for-t.v. cartoon offerings--adequate but uninspired.

For purists, the Bugs and Daffy voices are pretty good.  In fact, Daffy's whole personality has been kept intact, making it easily the best thing about these cartoons.  By contrast, be prepared to have your open mouth hit the floor when Witch Hazel opens her mouth and instead of the beloved voice of June Foray, we are treated to the voice of a sassy black woman (??).  Gossamer (Hazel's son, and again I say ""??"") doesn't fare much better, as he sounds like a wimpy 8 year old.

As you can see, The Looney Tunes Show just never had much of a chance of pleasing an old-time fan like myself.  But even if I could somehow erase the memory of those fantastic animated treats of yesteryear, I seriously doubt I'd find much to love about this show.",1314835200,5,2155,4.656084656084656
4649212,2,B005BXY1OW,"The first 2-4 episodes were ok. and a little funny. but after that they became just horrible. the only jokes i see are looney tunes crew in front of humans do some stupid things and humans indifferent faces. as been said, no looney left out. that only had some sitcom left at their studios, so they put it here. bugs lost his famous catchphrase ""whats up, doc?"" only mentioned in first episode. but he got a new one - ""i invented carrot peeler"". he is not smart any more - just boring. daffy is still selfish and point-less, but he became a way too stupid. doesnt understand the easiest things. i watched all the episodes and i see that theres no hope. the designs are great! indeed! but its no good plot. its not even watchable. don't waste your life for that. and just look at the price! 15$ for 4 episodes.
the only thing why i gave 2 stars is merry melodies. the songs are great. just perfect. oh, forgot to mention, these series have Wille E. Coyote segment done in cgi. boredom itself. very unproffesional.",1312761600,,1012,4.4171122994652405
4649213,3,B005BXY1OW,"I have seen most of the cartoons of this show and it leaves me with mixed feelings. On one hand, it's nice that these animation studios revive their classic characters, but on the other hand, I feel that there is no more looney in these looney tunes. It feels more like a sitcom and there is not much in terms of slapstick, but I don't think the show is all that bad. On another note, With animation, you can revive cartoon characters, but you can't revive the old voice actors. Thus, we no longer have Mel Blanc or Pinto Colving (who in addition to Disney did work on some WB shorts) but we have Jess Harnell and Rob Paulsen (best known today as the voices of Yako & Wako Warner) and they provide the voices for the goofy gophers. They sound great, but nobody will ever sound like Mel Blanc, Bill Thompson and the other pioneering actors. Overall, this show is not so bad, but I feel that there isn't a lot of looney in these Looney Tunes!!",1312675200,,941,4.292134831460674
4649214,5,B005BXY1OW,"My wife and I (ages 30 and 37 respectively) really enjoy this updated take on the Looney Tunes characters. If you haven't watched this, here's a short description for you. Daffy moves in with Bugs and it's a very much like the Kramer/Seinfeld relationship in my opinion. Daffy causes various outrageous situations and Bugs has to clean them up or suffer through them. Other LT favorites are here as well, Yosemite Sam is their neighbor, as is Granny, who owns Sylvester and Tweety. There are Roadrunner Coyote shorts which are very much like the old ones, just with newer 3D-ish looking animation. To be honest I like the old ones better, but the new ones are good too. Speedy Gonzales owns a pizza restaurant for some reason. Porky is a loveable loser. Lola Bunny is a great new character as a crazy stalker obsessed with Bugs. Elmer Fudd is a newscaster.

The humor is really more for adults than kids, as it is sometimes quite subtle, for example Daffy Duck gets some ""business"" cards printed that simply say ""Daffy Duck - Wizard"" This new version of the show is more plot based than just the random silliness of the older cartoons and centers on situations like Daffy Duck's high school reunion or Bugs making a TV commercial for Speedy's pizza place. So I think this show is for sure made for grown-ups who enjoyed the old version growing up.

Each show also has a short musical part in the middle called ""merrie melodies"" which are always good and sometimes very hilarious and creative, like Foghorn Leghorn singing a ""Cock of the Walk."" Also, as with Seinfeld, there's a final short scene that acts as a coda for the entire episode.

As someone who grew up loving the original Looney Tunes, and as someone who enjoys other more edgy animation (Simpsons, Futurama, some older Adult Swim stuff, etc.) I would recommend this show.",1311984000,28,1834,4.6894409937888195
4649215,1,B005BXY1OW,"This is the worst program I've ever seen.  It should be a series of cartoon shorts, but instead, is structured like a poorly-written sitcom.  The storyline is lame, the characterizations aren't even close to the originals, and if you're waiting for a laugh, don't hold your breath.  It's a huge disgrace to what Warner Bros. originally produced... a waste of time and money.",1395187200,,374,4.904761904761905
4649216,5,B005BXY1OW,"GREAT NEW SERIES. THE CONTENT IS GOOD FOR KIDS, AND HAS UNDERLYING ADULT HUMOR. GREAT FOR THE FAMILY. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED",1387756800,,124,5.25
4649217,4,B005BXY1OW,Not as many episodes as expected or wished for- only about 4 episodes- but all in all the quality and originality of the program is there.  Love the Lola Bunny episodes!,1373414400,,169,4.451612903225806
4649218,2,B005BXY1OW,"The original cartoons featured strongly in my childhood, and I was hoping for a modern update.  Instead the show has too much dialogue and not enough physical comedy.  It's an animated take on the Seinfeld sitcom formula, predictable and slow.  This Bug's Bunny is passive-aggressive and won't be running rings around everyone else; instead he'll go with the flow.  Awkward pauses in the dialogue (like the Critic) started to bore me.  I skipped several scenes in each episode because nothing was happening.  Not interested in watching more after seeing these.

I thought the best part of this series was the remastered introductory orchestral piece.  Voice acting and animation were fine, but I couldn't get into it.  Wanted more 'wacky' shown antics and less daily life with everything-told-in-narration.  Did like the mid-episode minute of Roadrunner vs. Wile E. Coyote (not in every episode).",1366502400,,896,5.246478873239437
4649219,2,B005BXY1OW,It's alright. I guess I should have read it more. I love the updated Looney Tunes and I assumed I was getting a complete season. Nope.,1365379200,,134,4.1923076923076925

4649222,5,B005BXY1OW,"I couldn't believe how hard I was laughing the first time I watched this disc. What, the Looney Tunes are funny again?! In a 21st century setting? How'd that happen?

Some viewers are awfully disappointed that THE LOONEY TUNES SHOW isn't an attempt to revive the characters in the style of the classic theatrical shorts we all know and love. First of all,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looney-Tunes-Back-In-Action/dp/B004G75EYU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looney Tunes Back In Action</a>&nbsp;tried to do that very thing, and failed miserably. Second, this show is a TV sitcom, but a sitcom so aware of six decades of television history that it comes to us with a sly, subversive panache worthy of Bugs himself. There are knowing winks at SEINFELD's great ensemble pieces and its comedy of escalating nuisances; THE ODD COUPLE's successful formula of oil-and-water roommates; THE REN & STIMPY SHOW's unholy marriage of kidvid and August Strindberg; and THE JACK BENNY SHOW's metafictional premise of comic actors playing warped versions of themselves (in this case, it's Bugs and Daffy playing new, downscaled characters called ""Bugs Bunny"" and ""Daffy Duck"" -- and it works brilliantly).

Let's remember that the theatrical Looney Tunes shorts were made for adults as well as kids, and the new show takes that outlook and runs with it. It's disconcerting but somehow logical to see Bugs and Daffy cohabitating, though Daffy is a bum who crashed on Bugs's sofa five years ago and hasn't left since; they remind me of a divorced showbiz couple living only to torment each other, but who stay together because the act is too good to break up. Lola Bunny returns as a beautiful but completely crazy stalker obsessed with Bugs. Yosemite Sam is scarier as a well meaning but paranoid next door neighbor than he ever was as a career criminal. And no one's pretending that Mac and Tosh, the gophers, are anything other than a deliriously happy gay couple now living in a permanent honeymoon.

Forget the rounded look of the old cartoons, though. Now the characters are drawn in an angular, extremely stylized manner owing a lot to John Kricfalusi and his crew. Daffy's wild takes in the second kitchen sequence in ""Best Friends"" (with Daffy on the receiving end of a ""motivational"" speech by a no-nonsense Speedy Gonzalez) could've been lifted wholesale from episodes of the twenty-year-old REN & STIMPY SHOW, but I'm damned if they don't look good in this setting. The voice work is uniformly excellent, and the backgrounds are drawn with real character and presence -- more than once I was reminded of Maurice Noble's gorgeously rendered environments from forty or fifty years ago.

In short: these characters may be cash cows, but they ain't museum pieces. These are Tunes for our times, and they're as funny as they ever were.",1326931200,4,2866,5.170258620689655
4649223,4,B005BXY1OW,"We were able to review this DVD and true enough, it has been updated...
They still have the original characters, but the stories are in today's settings.
The Bugs and Daffy on a game show about best friends, where Bugs totally points out that Daffy is to centered on himself to know anything about anyone else....
Although I do think it is cute and a great gift if you want to attempt memories of the Looney Tunes with your younger ones...
I believe that they are trying to gear it to the younger generations and be ""cool"" versus being the timeless classic that it once was...",1317600000,3,576,4.443396226415095
