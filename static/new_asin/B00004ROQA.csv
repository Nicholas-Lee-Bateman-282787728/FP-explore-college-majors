7921411,4,B00004ROQA,"Decent sequel with David Hewlitt. Hewlitt was a decent actor already. He appeared on TV shows like Forever Knight. Of course he is probably most recognized from Stargate Atlantis. Here is the main star. Scanners II The New Order is a rehash of the original with slight differences in characters and story. It is, however, regardless of similarities and differences an enjoyable Sci-Fi movie.

David plays David Kellum a nurse who doesn't know he is a scanner. He is a bit similar to Cameron's Vale character. Both of them realize they are special but have trouble dealing with their scanning abilities. Just like Vale, Kellum gets recruited by a corporation and a doctor who wants to take advantage of his scanning technique.

Whereas in the original, you had this powerful scanner Darryl Revok played excellently by Michael Ironside, here you have Raoul Trujillo. You have a dirty corporate named Commander Forrester doing the same thing Keller did in the same movie: using the Scanners for his own purposes all the while putting on a completely different image for the public..there's also a twist about what happened to the characters of the first movie but it isn't very convincing.

That's about where the comparisons with the original end. The movie ends very differently than the first movie. There are couple of added scanning techniques that we didn't see in the movie like the ability of scanners to see  somebody through their own eyes.

Scanners II has decent if not great acting, another follow able story, decent special effects and all around it is a decent sequel to the original.",1250640000,5,1596,4.940298507462686
