7584811,5,B019WN9WNQ,"You can't beat Cathe Friedrich's workouts. This is an excellent and fun routine. Great instruction, toning and building strength. For me, it's the right length of time; I can always add the bonus workouts for added challenge. I enjoy the combo of cardio blasts and serious muscle building. Although there are some segments that may be considered higher impact, it is always modified by me without a problem (since I have knee issues). The production and care that go into the formula of Cathe's workouts are outstanding.",1465171200,5,520,4.988505747126437
7584812,5,B019WN9WNQ,"I've never (ever) agreed with reviewers who describe a workout as 'flying by'. I generally suffer through every excruciating minute but I was surprised to be surprised when Cathe said it was time for a stretch. Most of the moves will be familiar to anyone who has lifted a dumbbell or stretched a band before but nearly all of the combination moves are unique (to me). The pace is perfect and I would have more than enough time to change weights if I didn't use adjustable dumbbells. Even with the added step of changing plates I occasionally miss only one rep if I don't pause.  This workout is all strength, with no cardio component and the floor work incorporates the core, which I love.  Cathe's cuing is spot on and she constantly reminds about using a challenging weight. I did this the first time with light weights but such caution wasn't necessary since her directions are so clear and the workout doesn't feel rushed. Thankfully, she isn't overly chipper and she doesn't make any comments which will grate my 10th time hearing them. She has one person who does the occasional modification but this isn't the sort of DVD where someone is modifying every single move. Cathe  understands that we watch these videos many, many times so she omits anything we'll quickly outgrow and all extraneous chit chat.  The format of the DVD also shows how much she understands the video exerciser. There are two pre-mixes which include the additional Blast components and a number of 'time saver' mixes which cut the workout by about 10 minutes. The DVD is further broken down into chapters so one can DJ their own workout. I don't do fancy footwork and will never be an advanced stepper - two things I previously thought I needed to be a Cathlete - but I will be buying more Cathe DVDs.",1458604800,10,1782,4.647619047619048
7584813,5,B019WN9WNQ,"I love this workout!  I recently discovered Cathe after looking for more targeted muscle training DVDs and she doesn't disappoint.  She does a brief warm-up to get the blood flowing using 3 pound weights then continues on to focus on everything above the belt.  Weights are alternated between 5, 8 and 10 pounds but you can opt for whatever weight works for you.  For example, I used 12 pounds for upright and rear rows instead of the 10 pounders Cathe chose, 10 pounds for the triceps (versus 5 - I think), and 8 pounds for chest flies (versus 5).  It all depends on your particular level.  Moves include shoulder presses, tricep presses (not kickbacks), bicep curls, upright/rear rows, pullovers, discus twists, standing side flies, kneeling deltoid/leg lifts, and chest flies while lying on your back.  All the exercises done while on your back really hit the core as well so that's an added bang for your buck.

Cathe finishes with a series of planks and push-ups after putting the weights away.  The ""bear crawl"" consists of walking out into a plank pose, lowering both elbows to the mat, that returning to a regular plank before walking back.  If you're new to planks this could be challenging but I loved that particular move as it you're strengthening your arms along with your core.  The push-ups are tricep dips with alternating leg lifts and regular push-ups that focus more on the lowering phase; I had to modify those but was able to follow along pretty well.  Cathe throws in a couple child's poses in between sets to give you a good stretch, which was appreciated.

A cool down completes the main workout.

The DVD also includes two ""icy core"" routines that I haven't tried yet but are great if you want additional abdominal work; one requires a resistance band and the other a light weight.

This is part of Cathe's ICE series, which is designed for high intermediate to low advanced exercisers.  I'm not quite at the ""high intermediate"" point but completeld everything without much of a problem.  It's definitely effective as I'm already seeing results and it's fun - even more important!  The time flies and there is no dread factor.  Highly recommend!",1457049600,10,2170,4.78494623655914
7584814,5,B019WN9WNQ,"Workout time: 48:01
Equipment: 5, 8, 10, 12 & 15 lb. dumbbells, mat, stretch band
Muscle meltdown: Shoulders
Blizzard:  More of weighted exercises with cardio blasts.  In a word, ouch!  Doing a 1 legged burpee says it all.
Outfits:  blue tops with black or black/blue bottoms

This workout consists of bodyweight or weighted exercises, followed by a cardio blast.  This one felt to be more intermediate level than the other ICE workouts.  Perhaps thats because my legs are so strong.  Amanda did several modifications in this workout.

In spite of feeling intermediate, my heart rate got up there.  At the end of the workout I felt worked out, yet energized.

Some of the fun, new moves in this workout include:  lunge front and back with no weights, high rep lunge leg taps, sumo lunge jumps, lift squat abduction and lunge with figure 8 arms.  I really felt my leg muscles burn with all of the moves.",1452988800,7,902,4.705128205128205

7584836,4,B019WN9WNQ,"""We are going to work hard: We are going to do body weight training exercises for legs into leg blasts"". That' s exactly what this routine is all about, Heart rate pumping, sweating and enjoying it! This is (in my opinion) the one workout of the ICE series which comes closest to whatever is not ICE that C. Friedrich has released.  From Cathe.com:
This lower body and cardio workout will utilize strength exercises and blasts to chisel the entire lower body! This DVD includes
MAIN PROGRAM:
Warm Up - 7:48

BLIZZARD BLAST:  Total Workout - 17:29
ICY CORE 2:Total Workout - 13:43
I found the entire program challenging, heavy on the cardio (good!), solidly working muscles, and fun because I was obviously working hard with the crew. I truly like when Cathe turns to said crew to check on them and see if everybody's okay. Also, when she genuinely congratulates them for working out hard, it just feels good to know I was tagging along too!",1487721600,2,1034,4.644808743169399

7584844,2,B019WN9WNQ,"I've got about 20 Cathe DVDS and this is only 1 of 2 that I've ever really been disappointed with. I didn't feel like I got a really good arm workout from this which is why I bought it to specifically concentrate on my arms. To me, this was like a brief arm section followed up by a glorified abs workout because as soon as you hit the mat it's more arms and abs, then just the focus which wasn't really what I was looking for. To me Metabolic Total Body, which I also ordered at the same time, gave me more of a good arm workout than this.",1468540800,9,540,3.963302752293578

On the bad, it's a medium on the intensity level (which it's supposed to be).  I just didn't find that it gave my upper body a good workout at all - even if i were to use heavier weights.  This is the first I've done from this bundle.  If I could've returned it by itself, I probably would've.  I'll probably try it with heavier weights to see if  Ican improve it.  The music is decent.  Has some good tunes.",1490140800,2,581,4.116071428571429
