8696152,1,B00RWKN89Q,"Typical cinema eurotrash, one of Vadim's worst movies. I felt sorry for the gorgeous actresses. Girardot had the better part and handled it fairly well. Deneuve, alas, did poorly with a two-dimensional role. Hossein was absurd as the amoral SS officer. The settings were appropriately decadent. The Wagnerian score was pretentious.",1502150400,,331,5.509803921568627
8696153,4,B00RWKN89Q,Not really enjoyable and often confusing. But it was well worth watching just to see how Vadim threw himself into creating such an over the top melodrama. The anatomical murals in the final scenes were bizarre and added to the sense of evil and doom.,1499558400,,250,4.5777777777777775
8696154,4,B00RWKN89Q,"This 1h45 min Roger Vadim movie is inspired by Justine ou Les Malheurs de la Vertu, one of the Marquis de Sade cult books. Vice and Virtue was projected on the French cinema screens in 1963. The dialogs have been writen by Roger Vaillant, a big fan of Sade and Laclos (among others). Paris, Spring 44; the French capital is occupied by Germans. Two sisters, Annie Girardot and Catherine Deneuve  are very different and both have two radical points of view about the occupants.
the beginning of the film:
 Juliette the brunette is the mistress of a German officer and consequently the blond Justine comes to begs her to save her lover just arrested by the gestapo in front of the church where they were to get married...Juliette refuses...
The film is in black and white for an evident reason. I must say the actresses are beautiful: Girardot (RIP), Deneuve who played her first real role (for the anecdote Vadim transformed her immediately in a blond icone asking her to tint her hair!!! Thanks to this movie she will be choosen to play in The Parapluies Of cherbourg and will become a French star!) However, I do not think these actresses play very well contrarily to Robert Hossein who is remarquable in his role of Schondorf, especially when in the film the Liberation is to come in Spring 45.
I think it is a movie to watch even if it is not transcendent.",1484438400,2,1359,4.588477366255144

8696156,1,B00RWKN89Q,"Script very poorly written. Actors spoke their lines as if they were in a straight jacket. Men who had German speaking parts betrayed strong French accents. While I understand this prestigious  director's need to show hatred for the Nazis, his method was artless, mechanical, and ultimately, boring. This film is a turkey. One learns nothing.
Young Catherine Deneuve very beautiful, of course.",1452124800,3,393,5.338709677419355

8696159,4,B00RWKN89Q,"Although in french, I was able to follow well enough with the English subtitles. I'm a Catherine Deneuve fan so it was enjoyed by me.",1427241600,,133,4.36
8696160,4,B00RWKN89Q,"If you're familiar with Roger Vadim, then you should have an idea of what to expect. Fine direction, good acting, artistic cinematography. Catherine Deneuve is in fine shape here, at her most beautiful, giving a fine performance. Music is sparingly used, yet when it is used, it is usually lush in the Vadim style. He romanticizes the tragedy between 2 sisters: one represents vice and the other virtue. This film follows a fictionalized account of women who were kidnapped by the Nazis to serve as their whores, with the focus mainly on these 2 sisters, one who sides with the Nazis and one who endures the torture from the Nazis. One of Vadim's more artistic films . Well done!",1426982400,13,679,4.714285714285714
