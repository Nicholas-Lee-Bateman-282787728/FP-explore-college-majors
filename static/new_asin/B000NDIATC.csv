8177131,1,B000NDIATC,"I'm not interested in a documentary that explores ridiculous and disproven theories about Billy the Kid's death. I don't want to hear about the 26 fraudulent old men that claimed to be Billy. The real Billy the Kid was killed by Pat Garrett in 1881 and is buried in Ft. Sumner, New Mexico. Instead of this video, I would recommend two titles: 'American Experience: Billy the Kid' and 'Billy the Kid: The True Story'. They are both excellent. They are factual and entertaining, and don't deal in ridiculous theories about Billy's death.",1476316800,,535,4.826086956521739
8177132,1,B000NDIATC,"This is a well produced show of the same old version of Billy the Kid.  I suggest that the History Channel get the real story and put together an interesting and educational documentary on Billy the Kid.  Two of the twenty-six known claimants were Brushy Bill Roberts and John Miller.  I wrote the book, ""Billy the Kid, His Real Name Was..."", and Brushy Bill was NOT Billy the Kid!  When the request came through to dig up Brushy Bill's body, I fought it tooth and nail.  I told the Hamilton, TX City Council to reject the idea, but if they dug his body up, to compare his DNA with his real mother in Hopkins County, TX.  I am waiting on the History Channel to contact me to set the record straight.",1304812800,,699,4.297709923664122
8177133,2,B000NDIATC,"A dated, typical, History Channel Production.  The quality of the dvd is poor, and offers no special features.  I have tried to watch this on more than one occasion, and couldn' finish it. Besides that, the subtext of the program is not to illustrate the life of William Bonney, but to make a ""what if"" and call it a documentary.  It is rife with conspiracies, did Bonney escape?  Who was Brushy Bill?  Not only that, but it's interpretation of events following the Lincoln county war, including the terrible and not only boring, but confusingly shot reenactments, leave something to be desired. The History channel productions should have a large warning label stating that they are for ""entertainment purpose"", as they certainly lack in ""historical value"".  Besides the shoddy reenactments done with dramtic effect of slow motion shots that could have been done with home video camcorder they feature the typical close up ofstock pictures on Billy th Kid, while they speculate on whether they should dig p whatever remainsmay still be in his grave,to compare DNA with that of the grave of his mother.  All the while entirely missing the point as to why Billy the Kid became a legend in the first place.  Many History channel programs appear to have been made with as small a budget as possible, just to have something to sell for more money than it's worth.  Finally, there is nothing new in this ""documentary"", to add is saying about Billy the Kid, that hasn't been said somewhere else.  The only high points, are seeing the expert witnesses on Billy the Kid, who appear in other programs about him as well, and even they seem to be irritated with the course of direction the shows' producers wanted to take with their film.",1296259200,,1727,4.784511784511785
8177134,3,B000NDIATC,"INVESTIGATING HISTORY: Billy the Kid (2003?) - Bill Kurtis (host)

Uses the typical reenactors mixed with vintage photos and other articles to tell the historical story, but the aim of this 50 minute documentary is to solve a long-standing mystery.

Forensics experts seek to exhume the remains of William Bonney and his mother to determine whether Pat Garrett really killed the Kid or let him escape. In the late 1940s, an elderly Texan named Brushy Bill Roberts claimed he was Billy. Although New Mexican officials refused to have the Kid's grave dug up, why couldn't Brushy Bill and Billy's mom be DNA matched or eliminated?

Too many unanswered questions here.",1273276800,5,664,5.0181818181818185
8177135,4,B000NDIATC,"Good representation of the mystery surrounding Billy the Kid.  Was he really killed by Sheriff Pat Garrett?  Only Billy knows.  Seriously, how can you go wrong with the History Channel?",1200268800,6,185,5.1
