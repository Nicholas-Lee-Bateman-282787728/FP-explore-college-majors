8326255,3,B001AD8FQ2,"This pivotal ""B"" Western marked the film debut of Gene Autry, whose rapid success as a singing cowboy was partially due to the self-destructive decline of Ken Maynard (now working at Mascot Pictures after being fired from Universal). ""In Old Santa Fe"" (1934) remains a good showcase for Ken, Tarzan the Wonder Horse and Gabby Hayes with its entertaining mix of hard riding,  romance, fisticuffs, comedy and music. Gene and Smiley Burnette perform the title song during their brief screen time. Mascot boss Nat Levine  replaced the difficult (though popular) Maynard with an unproven Autry in the genre-bending 1935 serial ""The Phantom Empire."" And the rest is Saturday Matinee history.",1468368000,,685,5.218181818181818
8326256,1,B001AD8FQ2,"Because I'm a lifelong Gene Autry fan, I purchased this DVD to see ""The Singing Cowboy's"" first screen appearance. He appears for about seven minutes along with sidekick Smiley Burnette as members of a band entertaining at a dance.

The appearance was so short and Autry and Burnette were so unknown that they're not credited as cast members. Ken Maynard and George ""Gabby"" Hayes were listed as stars of ""In Old Santa Fe"" -- a 1934 B-Western.

The trouble with this Sinister Cinema DVD is its very poor quality. If you enjoy seeing projection lines in your movies and poor sound is OK with you, then go ahead and buy this DVD.

But if you're interested in quality, wait for Gene Autry's people to put out a remastered -- and authorized -- version of this historic flick.",1235433600,3,770,4.605839416058394
8326257,5,B001AD8FQ2,"Poverty Row Pictures presents ""IN OLD SANTA FE"" (15 November 1934) (64 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- . Ken Maynard was an American motion picture stuntman and actor --- Born Kenneth Olin Maynard in Vevay, Indiana, he was an accomplished horseman --- As a young man, he performed in rodeos and was a trick rider with Buffalo Bill 's Wild West Show and a circus rider with Ringling Brothers --- During World War I, he served in the United States Army.

He first appeared in silent motion pictures in 1923 and in addition to acting also did stunt work --- Maynard became one of the first singing cowboys with Columbia Records --- Also one of the first to make a star out of his white stallion named ""Tarzan"", a half-Arabian, half-American Saddle horse. Maynard bought him in the mid-1920's --- With his white cowboy hat, fancy shirt, and pair of six-shooters, from the 1920s to the mid-1940s --- Maynard appeared in more than 90 films --- However, his alcoholism severely impacted his life and his career ended in 1944. He owned a small circus operation featuring rodeo riders but eventually lost it to creditors.

The significant amount of money he had earned vanished and he lived a desolate life in a rundown mobile home --- During these years, Maynard was supported by an unknown admirer - long thought to be Gene Autry --- More than 25 years after his last starring role, Maynard returned to two small parts in films in 1970 and 1972 --- Ken Maynard died penniless in 1973 at the Motion Picture Home in Woodland Hills, California. He was interred at Forest Lawn Cypress Cemetery in Cypress, California. Maynard's funeral is described in detail in James Horwitz's book They Went Thataway --- His brother, Kermit Maynard, was also an actor and stuntman

For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Ken Maynard has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6751 Hollywood Blvd -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
