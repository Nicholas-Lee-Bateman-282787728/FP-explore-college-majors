8665784,2,B00LGZIQ9U,"Inspired by the Beauty and the Beast myth, Ferzan zpetek's latest film
has bourgeois would-be cafe owner Elena (Kasia Smutniak) falling in
love with mechanic Antonio (Francesco Arca). Initially it seems that
they are totally incompatible, but animal attraction draws them
together. After a whirlwind courtship, they marry and have two
children. Later on in life Elena contracts breast cancer; Antonio finds
it hard to deal with the news, leaving Elena's best friend Fabio
(Filippo Schiccitano) to step into the breach. In hospital Elena
strikes up a relationship with fellow-victim Egle (Paola Minaccioni),
but this is brought to a cruel end with Egle's death. Meanwhile Antonio
learns how to cope with his wife's illness, and the two look forward to
a certain amount of happiness. zpetek builds the narrative around a
circular structure, beginning and ending with Elena and Antonio's
courtship, with the cancer plot in the center. This enables viewers to
focus on the ways in which pre-marital dreams are realized or not, as
the case may be. Through the use of slow tracking shots and zooms into
close-ups of the main protagonists, he invites us to reflect on the
characters' emotions, expressed nonverbally as well as verbally.
Although this is a clever technique, it seems rather out of place in a
slight narrative which basically reinforces the message that love
conquers all. There are also some unfortunate implausibilities of plot
that jar somewhat: it is highly unlikely that Elena would resume work
so soon after having had chemotherapy; and she would certainly not
entertain the idea of making love to her husband immediately after
having been given another dose of the same therapy. While the film
contains at least one stand-out performance by Minaccioni as Egle, as
she tries the best to put a brave face on life, despite her illness, it
is ultimately very disappointing.",1406851200,4,1884,5.12012987012987
