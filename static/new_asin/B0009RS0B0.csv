8065639,5,B0009RS0B0,Good American DOCUMENTARY. What went wrong is the only question?,1482624000,,64,5.5
8065640,5,B0009RS0B0,"If World War II taught American anythin it was that the country needed to work together if it wanted to grow together and take its natural place on the world stage.

The country was so large however that there was not much to hold the people together. So, the government decided to put together promotional films documenting how by working together we could all become stronger as a nation.

The idea seems silly today, but these well made and well preserved films give you a good sense of an era that we haven't seen in a long time.",1164672000,,533,4.428571428571429
8065641,5,B0009RS0B0,"After world war II the goverenment was very, very afraid that people would start thinking for themselves and question authority. They were so terrified, in fact, that they made a bunch of movies about how much fun it is to conform and do what you are told to do.

The result is this collection of films aimed at teaching you to work hard, spend money and have the nicest lawn the block.

No wonder the hippies eventually started doing acid and said ""to heck"" with everything that was going on.

These movies, at some level, tell people that they should be happy slave people, as long as they are slaves to capitalism and not communism.

In this orwellian world, the grass is always greener if you fly the red, white and blue.

Ths historical importance of these films can not be overstated, because they show you just how dangerous our leaders can be.",1146873600,,851,4.5359477124183005
