8311395,5,B001IV619E,"This is probably my favorite part of the workbook and DVDs (DVD 5 and 6). Although I am a novelist, and although I have what I believed to be a sound knowledge base and skills in world-creation and scene-setting, DVD 5 first explains the difference between a symbol  and a metaphor. Perhaps you believe you know: I did. Watching these DVD's and actually doing the exercises which weren't hard--but opened my mind to see images, settings like I never had before. My teenage grandson restarted his novel after reluctantly agreeing to watch the video class over about a month. The reluctance changed to frustration, fruition and celebration--just like me. I wish these DVD's and workbook were in every school; and not just film schools. But creative writing for adults and children. Five stars on these two DVDs and the corresponding workbooks",1412899200,,840,4.957446808510638
8311396,5,B001IV619E,"These metaphor videos are some of the best visually to understand visual plot, since you get to see the symbol as Sherridan talks about it and how it makes you think or feel different reactions. After the basics, you get into how to put a bunch of symbols together that change over time to show a story visually. Stories become visual puzzles that communicate across languages when symbols are used together.  (Think of the Film Baraka).
Video collage techniques are used to show some of the symbols and let you see how to put layers of images together for animations and films. Excellent training piece-- I used it in a film class.",1277769600,2,632,4.642857142857143
