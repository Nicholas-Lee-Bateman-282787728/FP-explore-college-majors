8449031,5,B004YY8RZS,This bundle actually exceeded my expectations. The sinawali drills were presented well and demonstrated very well. I would very much recommend this bundle to anyone.,1355529600,,165,5.64
8449032,3,B004YY8RZS,"I agree with other reviewers that the variety in this collection is great. However, I was very disappointed that there were no sinawali drills included that could be performed solo/with a dummy. Since a significant amount of my training has to go this route, the encyclopedia was of limited value to me.",1315785600,,303,4.846153846153846
8449033,5,B004YY8RZS,"This is a serious, step-by-step, no-frills depiction of this martial art form. It is so clearly and logically presented that every movement is completely clear and easy to follow. A nice mix visually too, since not only the teacher demonstrates the form . . . you get to see each movement being used in two person exercises. Well worth the bucks!",1305417600,,346,4.688524590163935
8449034,5,B004YY8RZS,"I'm still digesting this DVD.  Honestly to get good at any strike pattern and be able to utilize it requires hundreds of repetitions. That's hours of work. If you look at it that way the load of options shown are a years worth of training material.  This works best if you have a buddy you can train with and some protective gear so you can work on trying to apply and counter each of the patterns.  The menu didn't work of my TV for some reason but works fine on my laptop.  Not a big deal.  My laptop is what I use bring training material with me anyway.  I think my wife would be upset if I smashed all of the potted plants doing stick practice in my living room :)

In short.  Awesome (and a little overwhelming) amount of information that will keep you swinging for hours and hours.",1304467200,,787,4.2
