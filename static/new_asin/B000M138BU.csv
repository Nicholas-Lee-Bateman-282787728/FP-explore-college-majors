8165575,5,B000M138BU,"There are many Doo Wop reunion DVD's to choose from, but the best production and presentation is here.  Doo Wop 50 and 51 are both excellent products.  Done for PBS, sponsered by Rhino, produced by T.J. Lubinsky and hosted by Jerry Buttler, the sound quality is excellent, the production is smooth and well thought out, and the preformances are all first rate.  If you enjoyed doo wop as a teen, you will enjoy watching and listening to these old performers as they come back one more time to entertain and amuse.",1364169600,5,513,4.615384615384615
