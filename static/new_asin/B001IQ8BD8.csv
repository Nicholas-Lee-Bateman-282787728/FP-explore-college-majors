8311321,4,B001IQ8BD8,"I was looking for more from Meghan White-Tieff.  This DVD is the exact same work out found on ""Ultimate Body - Beginning Workouts for Weight Loss"" (DVD).  It's one of my favorite workout DVD's, with good variety and do-able workouts.  I'm writing this review to let buyers know it's exactly the same as another DVD.",1381536000,4,315,4.6909090909090905
8311322,3,B001IQ8BD8,"The good - I like the weight training portion. Lots of workouts to choose from.
The not so good - this is a high impact workout. I am an intermediate exerciser and this was too high impact for me.
Passing this one along to a 19 yr old friend & finding something else.",1375747200,2,267,4.056603773584905
8311323,5,B001IQ8BD8,"This is a good workout program.  Nothing fancy.  No crazy dance combinations, no steps or stability balls and no trendy fusion concepts.  This is back to basics bootcamps and cardio kicboxing that anybody can do.

If you are in great shape then these workouts will probably be to easy for you.  If you're like me, a recovering computer potato, then they're great.  The routines are easy to follow and I work up a good sweat.  There's a warm up, the cardio and a cool down.  You can also choose to do routines that have double the cardio.

To round out the cardio there's a strength section.  It is excellent.  Upper body with weights, lower body that's lots of squats and lunges, and there are ab workouts.

I've been doing these workouts four times a week.  I do the cardio two of the days and then do upper and lower body and abs the other days.  So far this one DVD has everything I need.  And it's fun too.",1233878400,14,910,4.333333333333333
