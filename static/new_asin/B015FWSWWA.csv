7435853,4,B015FWSWWA,"This is the third Bluray of a concert from the country/pop trio Lady Antebellum, following one in 2012 and 2013. If you liked the others, youll probably love this one. The film (it was show on digital cameras) runs 100 minutes  but its not 100% concert footage. Instead of adding the behind the scenes sections  like the set design meeting and a throwaway piece of the band choosing a young girl at a meet & greet and letting her sing a guitar solo to be included on the BD/DVD (no, the girl cannot sing well but you have to sit through it  they have included four such sections. There are no bonus features this time.

The venue was the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre in Los Angeles

The band runs through 20 songs (actually 22, since there is one medley) including their old hits plus songs from the new album 747. They are joined on three songs by Hunter Hayes (who does show of a mean guitar solo or two) and Sam Hunt joins in (along with Hayes) on one of the cover songs  Arrowsmiths Walk This Way. Another cover is of Shania Twins Any Man of Mine. (Songs penned by Ed Sheeran and Stevie Nicks are here too.)

The audience is mostly young women and the camera cuts to the audience (on their feet  with beers upraised in their hands  a bit too much for me. And, since this is a huge stadium show, we get lots of smoke and flashing light  and way to many quick camera cuts (at least for me). The concept is to have the viewer feel like they are right there.

Yes, I really enjoy LAs writing and performing talent but I don't fall into the demographic for their concert audience so I can say I liked watching this once. But, honestly, if you liked the last two video releases of the LA concerts from Eagle Rock, youll certainly like this one. Its got some of the old, and some of the new and Hunter Hayes fans will want it for his performance.

The BD comes with a 12 page full color booklet with color photos and song publishing and production credits.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7435854,3,B015FWSWWA,Three Stars for the audio production of the Blu-Ray not the Band.  I had to adjust each speaker so that it was listenable. Took both rear surrounds to -10 and the front L&R to -5 just so to cut down on the echoing.  Center channel was boosted to +5.  On one song a shaker was used and the volume was as loud as the vocals.  So sad because this is basically unwatchable.  If you don't have a 7.1 setup and are just using the TV speakers it should be okay.,1472428800,,454,4.0

7435862,5,B015FWSWWA,"Filmed in Irvine, CA on their 2015 tour, this concert captures the country trio at their best. Featuring songs from all 5 of their studio albums, plus some inspired cover songs too. They bring out their openers Sam Hunt and Hunter Hayes for some help also. Almost as good as being there.
