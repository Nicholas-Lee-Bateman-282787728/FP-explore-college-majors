This movie is totally awesome!!!  I found it awesome how they were able to put this movie together in only a short amount of time but looking so professional with such awesome actors! I couldn't stop laughing through the whole movie.

I found this movie totally original and very well put together.  I recommend this to anyone who loves a good comedy/mocumentary.

I also recommend listening to the whole beginning of the DVD Menu after you watched the movie....totally awesome!

when I purchased this, I thought I was buying The Gamers DVD (by Dead Gentleman Productions),  but got this instead. I was dissapointed, and this tempers my review.

This Mockumentary shows a group of guys playing a fictional role playing game (resembling D&D), that are about to break the record as the longest playing group ever.

While the idea is nice, and some of the jokes are funny, I found this to very low brow humor (guy gets caught masturbating, the GM's costume accidentally looking like a KKK outfit), stereotypical characters and a boring plot.

While it can generate some identification nods from RP-ers, and a few laughs (especially if you're drunk) this movie just isn't worth it.",1177891200,10,716,4.884297520661157

This movie is hysterical and anyone who's given it a bad review I don't think has a true appreciation for D&D.  It's as amusing as it is nerdy.  The worst thing about this is the production quality that went into the CGI bird ""The Chipper"" in the 2 scenes that he's in.  Otherwise the move goes off without a hitch and anyone who's done an RPG will be a fan of it, and anyone who hasn't played, might find themselves more curious about starting.

This, the first Gamers Movie, is low on budget and high on enthusiasm
to tell us a funny tale of, well, Gamers.
It's a favorite.

I just happen to be partial to movies and series that
try to do more with less, rather than those that
can do whatever they want because they have a huge budget to work with.

This is one of several movies that attempt to take a humorous look at role-playing gamer stereotypes, but completely falls flat in execution. There are a number of shows that try the same topic much more successfully. This movie continues to advance false negative stereotypes about role-playing gamers, and fails to do so with any modicum of humor. It is boring, dull, crass, and poorly produced.

Do not confuse this ""Gamers"" show with Matt Vancil's (Dead Gentlemen Production, and Zombie Orpheus Enterprises) ""The Gamers"", ""The Gamers 2:Dorkness Rising"", ""The Gamers 3: Hands of Fate"", and Journey Quest 1 & 2 which are great humorous movies about role-playing gamers, and present far more compelling storylines, characters, acting and production quality.",1352592000,,840,5.222222222222222

My husband and I are big fans of tabletop RPG movies, and we absolutely loved Dead Gentlemen Production's ""The Gamers: Dorkness Rising"". We'd heard that ""Dorkness Rising"" was a quasi-sequel to another movie by the same company called ""Gamers"", and we picked this up, expecting that this was the same movie.

Well, firstly, it's not. ""The Gamers"" by Dead Gentlemen Productions is here:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gamers/dp/B001875ZVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gamers</a>. So if you've been redirected here looking for the prequel to ""Dorkness Rising"", run away as fast as you can.

This movie is utterly horrible and without any amusing lines whatsoever. The ""plot"" is that the same group has been playing the tabletop RPG ""DND"" (Dungeons, Nymphs, and Dragons) for a record-breaking number of hours, and a TV crew has been dispatched to interview the players before their big record breaking night. The entire movie consists of watching the ""interviewees"" talk about their lives (which are played up to be as pathetic as possible) - there is almost ZERO gaming shown on camera. Literally, I think maybe, MAYBE, there's a combined 2 minutes of gaming in this movie, and that's largely flashbacks.

Here are the things that are ""funny"" about this movie:

- One of the players has a day job extracting semen from horses. Cue visual gag.

- One of the players has a day job recording custom songs for kids, including a song for a kid named ""Dick"".

- One of the players took his lactating cousin to the prom. Cue visual gag.

- One of the players hires a black woman to make him a ""Gandalf the White"" costume and she somehow fails to realize that her ""original design"" looks EXACTLY like a Klan robe. A black dwarf (the real kind of dwarf, not the fantasy kind) then proceeds to beat up the FRIEND of the guy-wearing-the-Klan-robe, so that the ""role playing"" Klan guy can call him a ""dirty dark dwarf"".

- One of the players has swinger parents. Cue visual gag.

- Clown porn. I wish I was making this up.

There is nothing - absolutely nothing - funny about this movie. It's not original; it's just a bunch of silly gross-out gags thrown at the screen over and over in the hopes that something will stick. The ""tabletop RPG"" theme is completely shoe-horned in - the exact same movie could have been made about, say, people who obsess about Star Trek conventions or something equally ""nerdy"" (in the public eye), and only a couple of lines would have had to change to accommodate the new theme. I'm terribly sorry that I rented this thinking that it was the DGP movie by the same name, and I would like someone to pass the brain bleach, thank you.

2683067,4,B000K680K6,"Let's be clear: this is a movie by gamers, FOR gamers.  If you play D&D, you will ""get"" this movie; if not, you won't -- it's pretty much that simple.  Having said that, any gamer that can laugh at himself, and recognize what a nerdy hobby they indulge in (and I am one!), will get a hoot out of this flick!",1284681600,,307,4.016393442622951
2683068,5,B000K680K6,"This is not the Dead Gentlemen's ""The Gamers"", ""The Gamers 2: Dorkness Rising"" or the soon to be released ""Gamers 3: Hands of Fate"". They are all awesome, this is not they.

However,

For me, Gamers was another rare find at the local video store (back when such things still existed) where a hasty search for a bad movie struck cinematic gold.

As an avid and long running rpg enthusiast, I'm always on the lookout for any new (or new to me) movie in the fantasy genre that properly inspires the 1980s heyday of low budget fantasy film a la the Gor or Deathstalker series.
For some time now, movies that actually delve into the tabletop rpg subject have taken to doing so in a postmodern ""breaking down the 4th wall"" manner where you have the players and their characters represented in a dual scene and story format (see DG's The Gamers).

This film deals almost exclusively with the players themselves and their exaggerated antics. Much of the humor is crude, absurd, over the top and (in my opinion) not entirely off the mark. Are the characters stereo types and largely offensive? Yes, and that's where most of the comedy comes from. On a related note, there are also quite a few moments of more subtle humor that become increasingly funnier by being juxtaposed with bodily function jokes.

Watching the extras on the DVD and following the film makers post production interviews has led me to believe they are not gamer haters as is often an accusation I see leveled at this movie in criticism, but that the film does take a satirical and hilarious look at the people who interact in the hobby of table top gaming.

Also, if you happen to enjoy the soundtrack, as I did, there is a separate album available with Kevin Sherwood performing the background bits and montage pieces which I highly recommend as well.",1284076800,3,1814,4.635514018691588
2683069,4,B000K680K6,"As an ex-RPG'r this movie took me back to the days I would spent 'wasting' my time away rolling various types of many-sided dice.

It does a good job with making light of the situations RPG'rs find themselves in, like winding back time, because a player was behaving out of character. Loved the way the NPC gets used for all the crappy jobs, but is ignored otherwise.

If you've spent a significant part of your life playing RPGs, you should appreciate the humour. If you've never experienced RPGs, you might find this extremely boring.",1283558400,2,536,4.691489361702128
2683070,4,B000K680K6,After reading the other user reviews I can see that this movie is horribly misunderstood. Gamers is a mockumentary about a group of RPGers who are about to set a record for most hours played (the game is a obvious DnD knock off). I found the movie quite enjoyable as a DnD player myself. However I think this movie can only be truly enjoyed by those who play table top RPG's such as DnD. The movie makes fun of situations that all DnD players would regonize or  or makes fun of problems DnD players have experienced when playing with friends. Another note is not to take the film to seriously I think if you go into this thinking you are watching a RPG documentary you will indeed be disappointed. However if you are looking for a humorous movie and play any kind of Table top RPG you will be delighted such as me and my friends where when we say this movie.,1281657600,2,858,4.296296296296297

As another review mentioned; this is not a film made by a gamer, it is a film that mocks gamers. If that is what you're into? Go for it. Otherwise, don't bother. Thankfully there are other films about RPGers that are much better at both mocking (to a limited and non-stereotypical extent) and capturing the essence of RPGs like ""Fellowship of the Dice"" and ""The Gamers"" and its semi-sequel ""The Gamers: Dorkness Rising"" as a few vastly superior examples.

2683072,1,B000K680K6,"0 of 5 stars.  -1 star, if possible.

This is an RPG ""comedy"" written by someone who never played an RPG, and who simply is not funny.  The movie has NO understanding of RPGs, gamer culture, nor humor.  It is perhaps the worst film I have ever watched, and certainly the dumbest, stupidest, most idiotic film I've ever watched.  This film seriously gave me an upset stomach.

The premise of this film is a mocumentary of Gamer culture, but the film displays no knowledge of RPGs or Gamers.  The only reference that the clueless writer is aware of is that sometimes RPG characters die, and all the RPG jokes in the film are based on this concept.  The rest of the film is based on the gamers who are all shallow, undeveloped pseudo-cliches who yell at each other, and are cruel to each other in between meaningless, poorly developed scenes which often don't support any plot.

Besides the complete lack of any understanding of RPGs or Gamers, the humor in this film is horrible.  It is the most obnoxious, super-low-brow, immature, juvenile, insultingly dumb humor I've ever seen in a film.  This film displays the worst comedic timing I have ever seen, and the director stretches out bad jokes over minutes.  I do recall three jokes which made me smile, and one of the gamers Swinger parents made me laugh, but the bulk of this film is VERY bad jokes (dull, immature, and unsophisticated), which are forced on the observer for near unbearable amounts of time.

To summarize the humor, it seems like the inane prattle between two 12 year olds with obvious problems with their attention spans, intelligence, and basic awareness.  Besides the complete lack of anything clever about RPGs or Gamer culture, this film fails to deliver in any way imaginable.  It is poorly written, poorly directed, poorly edited, poorly acted, and is simply NOT funny.

On a positive note, there is a good part to this DVD.  The DVD has extra features which include the trailer to the film.  The trailer is well done, as whoever edited it has an understanding of comedic timing and humor.  Stick with only the trailer and you may laugh and have good feelings about the film.  If you want that laughter removed, and those good feelings to go away, just watch the entire movie.

This movie is unforgivably horrible.  It's just terrible.

If you want a good RPG movie, check out ""THE Gamers"" or even ""Fear of Girls"".  They both have clever and very funny RPG references, as well as the ability to make you laugh out loud.",1261785600,9,2495,4.65675057208238
