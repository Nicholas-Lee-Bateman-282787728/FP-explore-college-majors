This is not TYA, but you can still see ""Captain Speed Fingers"" dealin' on ""Big Red"".",1404604800,,210,3.9069767441860463
8616782,1,B00FLZGC56,"Same as Rockpalast Live (1990) Amazon has made a mistake with the dates, and the DVD cover is masked with an Alvin Lee photo of a different show. The quality also poor. Amazon has to fix the information in the Rockpalast DVD it is not 1990, it is 1978. This is misleading.",1392681600,4,272,4.25
