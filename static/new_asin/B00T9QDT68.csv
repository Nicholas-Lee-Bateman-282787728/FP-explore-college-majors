7003589,5,B00T9QDT68,"This will not win an Oscar,  BUT it is a very good and silly movie that our family really enjoyed. Typical plot about a kid and family that has to raise money to save the park/ranch/etc. However, the silliness and humor are constant through the movie. It does bad guys but they are silly and are never scary bad. There is very little product placement and no bad language. A few adult-ish themes/situations you might be aware of, the bad guys steal a car, use sleeping gas to knock someone out and talk about prison. Overall both my children giggled all through the movie and would watch it right now for the third time if I offered them.",1453507200,11,638,4.406779661016949

7003617,3,B00T9QDT68,"Im no fan of talking dog movies, but then Im not the target audience. This family film is aimed at children ages 10 and under. By the time kids get to 6th grade, theyll feel the 10 to 11-year-old boy and girl leads are too young for them to tag along with on their little adventureespecially since Bark Ranger is a mash-up of so many familiar plot devices. Its a treasure hunt, a bumbling crooks caper, a were-gonna-lose-our-home-unless-someone-can-raise-big-money story, a divorced parent relocating the kid venture, a dealing with bullies tale, and a boy-meets-girl over summer vacation saga. Oh, and a dog saves the day story.

Jon Lovitz provides the sarcastic voice for Ranger, the canine narrator whose commentary is actually funny at times. Hes not just a talking dog, either. Hes semi-omniscient as well, narrating the story of what happened in the recent past with precise knowledge, even when it involves two bumbling brothers who steal a safe full of gold bullion from a small town sheriffs office when the dog is nowhere to be seen.

Theres no massive manhunt for these guys, even though they have a safe full of gold bars, and its not clear why those gold bars were just sitting around in a tiny resort-town safe or how these guys knew the gold was there. Then again, Marty Adams and Jason Blicker aren't there for logic. As the Festrunk brothers they're the main source of comedy, and director exaggerates it for all its worthas if they were auditioning for an over-the-top Disney Channel series. Some of the gags go on too long, but this mixture of potty jokes, physical comedy, and I know you are but what am I verbal jousting will amuse a target age group thats gotten used to seeing bumbling crooks. There really aren't any intense moments in this film, because the mash-up of plot devices IS so recognizable and everything is played with a light touch.

Lucius Hoyos and Zoe Fraser are cute and compatible as the park rangers son, Jack, and the dippy Tai Chi/Chi Tea divorced moms daughter, Chloe. You don't mind spending time with them because, frankly, their acting is more natural than the adults who play their parents (Ari Cohen, Alexandra Castillo, Trenna Keating). Then again, thats clearly  the way director Duncan Christie wanted it.",1439942400,,2261,4.819587628865979
8701037,5,B00T9QDT68,"Really didn't want to rent a movie. However, my 6.5 daughter thought it was funny. She laughed often throughout the entire movie. She wanted to rewatch it as soon as it ended....but Mom didn't ;)",1520294400,,195,4.6
8701038,2,B00T9QDT68,"Jon Lovitz, voice of  Ranger, the dog, is well worth the price of renting this video. My advice - fast forward through any scenes without Lovitz/Ranger. I will forever regret spending any time watching the so-called comic relief two bad guys. Those sequences rate lower than zero - disgusting, stupid, witless, tiresome, idiotic. Lovitz manages to rise above the squalid misery of the rest of the story, maybe he had his own director and script writer. The tiresome, over-long and in no way endearing sequences with the kids were bad enough and the two villains set a new low for inept movie making - a record that will be hard to beat. Whoever directed the kids and the villains should go to movie jail.",1513296000,,704,4.67741935483871

9 year old:  Why the girl?  Girls ruin everything.
6 year old:  Not another animal talking!
3 year old:  Football.
The 3 year old kept asking about the football, I didn't see one.  The 6 year old left the room the minute the dog started talking and went back to his project of making a life size It Clown for Halloween.  The 9 year old did watch it, but admitted that he was only doing so to avoid cleaning his room.  All I got out of this was a headache.",1507161600,,517,4.0594059405940595
