8387354,5,B00328HS70,"I must say the ""White Ape Steals Peach"" - DVD is VERY GOOD, with clear and precice instruction, that is easy to follow. I like the fact that they have included applications, different options to view the form, and detailed instructions on how to execute to moves.

Mantis is quite a tricky style to learn, and through DVD it is even more difficult, but having a background already in Mantis, I found this instruction DVD to be very easy to learn from.

This is excellent work!! Keep it up, and give us many  more DVD`s in the future.

I hope to see more weapons-DVD`s also (saber, stick, sword or other ""exotic"" weapons) from MartialSkill.

I will definitely check out the other videos from MartialSkill as well, looking forward to see the ""Chain Styles DVD"" soon. :)",1266796800,2,767,4.610294117647059

The seven-star kung fu form ""White Ape Steals the Peach"" taught thorugh this DVD is well explained, well detailed, easy to understand, and focused in every important detail.
Particular important is the fact that this DVD presents an in-depth analysis on real fight form applications.
In my opinion, this is one of the best DVDs I have ever seen.",1266710400,2,368,4.857142857142857
