8244827,2,B00129HZCO,"For many years people were waiting for a decent DVD release of Four Flies..
And there it was,out of the blue,from Germany. A very decent bootleg with the best picture quality to date. Widescreen and almost uncut.
Everybody was thinking it would be the best edition for years...

WRONG!

The first legit version of this film will be released February 2009.
By new company MYA Communication.
THAT,my friends,will be the best version ever,from the original negative,uncut in English and Italian.

The movie is great. The acting and music all work very well. Mimsy Farmer gives one of her better performances.
I gave this two stars though since it's a bootleg. The new release next year hopefully will get a five ***** rating.

So,don't buy this bootleg. It's too expensive anyway.
Just wait for the official DVD in stead!",1226880000,2,818,4.905797101449275
8244828,4,B00129HZCO,I have a grainy widescreen copy of this film on a burned DVD and I like the movie. I don't understand why Paramount(the American rights holder) won't release this film on a Region 1 disc. They could even license it out to Anchor Bay or another quality company. Disappointing.,1215216000,2,275,4.63265306122449
8244829,5,B00129HZCO,"Considered Argento's ""lost film"", Four Flies on Grey Velvet (Vier Fliegen Auf Grauem Samt) was never officially released...and there is talk that there will never be a legit, official release...but, this version is the closest us fans can get.  Until now, I was stuck watching fussy, bland, poor quality bootlegs of the film...searching for the right one...but never satisfied...
But, now there is a limited release of only 1000 copies of the ""Deluxe Edition"" of the film. I think one of the best things about it is the box it comes in. It comes in a very nice mock-VHS case, just like it would have come in when it was on VHS. The quality is...well...good for a ""lost film""...but some of the footage was obviously ripped from a VHS cut...but i would imagine that is because the original film was so damaged...
It is way better than the bootleg cuts and probably as good as it gets when it comes to this film...I honestly wouldn't have bought the film any other way, now that i got a taste of the gritty feel of this version...it  gives off such a cool vibe...and the film itself is one of Argento's most unique and entertaining...

The story...the over abundance of abstract and creative angles from start to finish...the acting...the whole thing...its all worth owning...ESPECIALLY for the Argento fans.",1203033600,3,1305,4.791111111111111
8244830,3,B00129HZCO,"You can't truely appreciate this DVD without comparing it to the Luminous Film Works bootleg.

I used to have the bootleg which was faded badly and dark and fuzzy and looked like a 20 year old EP tape sourced from a bad 16MM print. It used a hybrid of a French and English language track, which when it went between the two sounded like they were switching tapes cause you could hear two different tape hisses. Luckily it was wide-screen, but it was a cropped 1:85:1. It was obvious from the side-clipped credits. But at least it was in english and not in 1:33:1 (except for a particular murder scene where it was sourced from another print). So this DVD while not perfect is lightyears ahead of the bootleg we've had to endure, which was teh only way to see this film after it went out of the theaters in the 70's.

On to the DVD itself:

Pros: Full 2:35:1 and anamorphic to boot! The reds and colors are much stronger than it has ever been outside the theater. Theres an English audio track for us Americans! The print is much brighter revealing previously obscured details, especially with the killer's mask.

Cons: This appears to be a well-worn theatrical print. Remember Grindhouse? this is the real deal, theres plenty of scratches. Some scenes appear to be video sourced, while Roberto is trailing his stalker, some parts seemed to be video source due to the quality difference. As is in a murder scene, probably the same parts that went to 1:33:1 in my bootleg. But I don't remember him spitting blood on the camera in the bootleg.

Notes: I have no idea if this is uncut or not. I bought this DVD immediately cause I didn't know where it came from,it came out of left field. I kept hearing there would be no legit release, though i had heard rumors of a German Release from Dragon....some super one on DVD Aff. but didn't believe it. So i got it early incase it suddenly had to be pulled since i couldn't believe they were able to obtain teh rights to it. Worth it for now unti BU releases it. But it's worth getting for at least competion sake.

**** for the movie
*** for the presentation",1200182400,7,2100,4.455729166666667
