WISH YOU WOULDN'T TELL ME HOW MANY WORDS I MUST USE TO DESCRIBE THIS PRODUCT.",1387497600,,126,4.08
5169067,3,B008L0YMYG,"As stated in previous reviews, this DVD collection is a great compilation of classic 90s DiC cartoons and contains various Halloween or spooky-inspired episodes. All for a great price! The Christmas collection is equally enjoyable. However, the Bump in the Night segments have the audio tracks swapped. It's sad because that's the one show I looked forward to watching the most. Disappointing! Luckily enough Bump in the Night can be found released on DVDs separately from this collection. If that's a deal breaker than skip this one, but if not, enjoy!",1382486400,3,553,5.087912087912088

5169071,4,B008L0YMYG,this is for kids less than 5 years old. Cartoons are not scary  and just give a nice Halloween feel,1355184000,,99,3.95
5169072,1,B008L0YMYG,"Every year i try to buy my kids new Halloween and Christmas cartoons.. so i was excited when i saw this release by Cookie Jar.. 11 Halloween cartoons? wow..  First off these cartoons are SOOOO boring!! Really i can't pick a stand out.. maybe Archie's Halloween of Horror??  Really the bonus episode, Hey Vern, Its Ernest: It's Holidays!, is the best thing on here..except it really isn't a lot about Halloween more holidays in general.. If you are like me and like to add new Halloween or Christmas DVD's every year to your collection.. skip this one.. you will thank me!!",1351468800,5,572,4.653465346534653
5169073,2,B008L0YMYG,"I was very excited when this showed up on Amazon, and counted down its release date.  When I received my copy I put it in the DVD player immediately.  I managed to sit through every cartoon on the disc, and how I was able to do that, I have no idea.  The cartoons are horrible, and very few actually have to do with Halloween.  Most are just spooky-themed episodes, and even then they aren't entertaining.  The Richard Scary toon has a stupid story about a neighbor who looks like a witch, and is followed by another short about learning how to count.  Yes, on a Halloween DVD.  I was hoping Bump in the Night would save this, but even it was horrible and the audio messed up during most of the viewing.  Ultimately, this DVD was a great idea that was poorly executed.  With all of the Halloween cartoons over the years that have not been released on DVD, THESE are the ones they selected??  Even at the low price of $6, it isn't worth it.",1348358400,22,939,4.284090909090909

8528811,5,B008L0YMYG,This is such a great collection. I personally didn't watch these cartoons in the 90's but can remember my brother watching some of them in the early 2000's. My child loves these cartoons. We got a copy from the library and I was expecting the price to be much higher on amazon.,1444780800,,277,4.346153846153846

8528813,1,B008L0YMYG,None of the cartoon have matching audio. waste of money when you cant even watch the DVD because they don't make sense. the only reason I didn't return it is because after my time and shipping cost it isn't even worth it. don't waste your money. this is garbage.,1414195200,,262,4.36734693877551
