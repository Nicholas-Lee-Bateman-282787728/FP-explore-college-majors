4602074,5,B0058YPGVQ,"cant belive im watching a soap, but, i now own all seasons plus i buy each episode as they come out,this one turned everything upside down, but i think to early to turn clay on gemma and everybody, but will see, cant wait for next!!!!!",1317859200,,235,4.2444444444444445
4602075,5,B0058YPGVQ,"Another great episode continuing the storyline primarily involving John Teller's incriminating documents. The tension building up in Clay regarding the potential destruction those documents could mean to the club is palpable. I am also enjoying the story arc with Juice trying to keep the closet door from opening exposing his own skeletons.

Great, great episode. No violence - this one is all dialog and character development, but it's a stomach churning ride.",1317772800,3,462,5.416666666666667
4602076,3,B0058YPGVQ,"I have now seen the tackiest wedding in the history of tacky weddings.  The boys are full of pointless perfidy, silly games and noisy, obnoxious behavior that makes me wish I drove an 18-wheeler with a huge snow-blower on the front.

I really hope the plot gets more interesting, because right now it makes about as much sense as a Daffy Duck cartoon.  At least I don't want to gag when I look at Taz or even Yosemite Sam.",1316822400,,422,4.3164556962025316
4602077,5,B0058YPGVQ,I love this show. Shows how much family can matter and how much u would do for the people u love. all around great show.,1315785600,3,120,3.84
4602078,5,B0058YPGVQ,"Sure was a long wait (again!) but well worth it! The jet-fueled premier of the 4th run was incredibly satisfying in itself, and promises much more over the next several weeks -- like tying up at least some of the purposely left loose ends from the preceding seasons as well adding new twists.
Katey Sagal is as fierce & fabulous as ever; didn't think it was possible, but the ensemble cast seems even more relaxed & enmeshed than before, very believable that they have known each other for ages, thru all kinds of stormy weather. A consistent show strength has been to demonstrate the cohesiveness of the club while illustrating the concerns, doubts, resentments that flicker thru & between individual members or associates -- these actors all seem to have a gift for nuance, and the camera work complements it well.
My experience has been that at least 2 viewings are required to even begin to pick up all the glances and grimaces that further the story, not to mention verbal & visual allusions. For instance, I noticed that the Asst. U.S. Attorney has pictures of Otto & Juice under the heading ""Plan B"" on his office wall of shame (mug shots & photos of Samcro and everyone living or dead ever associated w/ the club). So the 2nd time I watched Juice more closely (and what I saw makes me kinda nervous...and very anxious for the next episode!)",1315440000,43,1348,4.644351464435147
4602079,5,B0058YPGVQ,SOA comes back with a vengance this season.  One episode in and it's already full of everything I love about this show.  I cannot wait to see the next episode and where this season takes the MC and its members.,1315440000,16,210,4.225

4602120,5,B0058YPGVQ,This show is always amazing. Every season was so good. This prob isn't the best season but i love it because to me it was the last season where things were still kind of happy. The shows great but the seasons after this one do get a little sad. It can be hard to watch cuz u love the characters so much. But anyway this season is still kind of happy.

4603334,3,B0058YPGVQ,"In season 4, the producers decided to add a ""previously on SOA"" reel as a lead in to each episode.  This is a really bad addition that ruins the flow if you're watching a whole season in a few sittings.  With a series made for TV being released on disc, all of that kind of thing should be deleted, the opening credits, the theme song, and this review of earlier scene snips.

  It's easy to see how HBO just shouldered network TV aside when they started producing serial sagas with each episode running an hour or more and the format improvement of no commercial breaks.  SOA, Justified and TWD would all have been much better if they had been made by HBO.  The old, hidebound TV networks can't die off soon enough.  That they have produced a few series offerings that rose a little above their usual old boring stuff won't save them.",1472169600,,835,4.411764705882353

The Cartel Storyline played out almost to neat and clean in my book but the real story behind them was a nice little out of left field move. Clay's Story is where this season is at. They setup things for the next three seasons to come with the Irish.

The final song of the season... Epic choice.

Rat is my new favorite character on the supporting side. The DA Guy had SOOO much potential that they squandered but he honestly left in EPIC style. Just a lot of good happening overall.",1458000000,,611,4.2956521739130435

Somehow I immediately felt connected to so many people in the show. I was amazed by some of the actresses (especially Katey Sagal!) everyone did a fabraric job! Great story...pretty realistic (minus a few smaller details.)
I loved it. I am actually starting to watch the entire series again... To catch things I may have missed.
Most of all it was awesome due to being on Amazon Prime. It was great to watch it show after show!

4607597,3,B0058YPGVQ,"Three and a half stars might be a better rating.  This show falls into a weird category for my wife and me as we can't stop watching it yet we can't help but find several faults with it as well.  I don't want to give any spoilers or anything, so I'll generalize and say that there's no way so many murders can happen in a small town and barely anyone every gets caught.  Even if the police are somewhat under your power.  There have been quite a few episodes where I found myself saying, ""oh, come on!"" or ""yeah, right!""  Also, the show borders on being a soap opera at times, but then again, so did other better series, like the Sopranos or Mad Men.  But we still binge watch it at times and it's definitely a lot of fun, especially once you get to know some of the characters well.  If you can suspend your disbelief for a while you will thoroughly enjoy S.O.A.",1438992000,5,863,4.193939393939394

4607757,5,B0058YPGVQ,"All seasons of ""Sons of Anarchy"" deserve five stars, they are definitely Emmy and Golden Globe qualified and we don't know why they haven't won any.  Charlie Hunnan is exceptional as Jax.  All of the cast became family as we streamed them to watch and catch up.  Very extremely violent, be warned.

4608841,3,B0058YPGVQ,"The thing about SoA is that while it is entertaining and ovrall, the acting is good, there is always this underlying feel that it is just another soap opera.  Nothing about the way these people react to situations in their lives mirrors real life.  Are there biker gangs up to no good in the world?  Probably.  There are certainly biker gangs who do a lot of good things too.  But I started watching this show and it was a brotherhood of men who often came back from theaters of war and needed to belong to something.  Now, they are international gun runners, drug dealers for the CIA, family killing family, and somewhere on the horizon, I can see Fonzi on his motorcycle getting ready to jump the shark tank.  I feel like whenever they think the show is losing steam, they take it to such an extreme that it loses any sense of authenticity it may have had.  More brutality and death doesn't a good show make.  I have actually stopped watching SoA because of the brutality and I find it incredibly depressing.",1431907200,,1010,4.475409836065574

4609979,4,B0058YPGVQ,"I was a fan of SOA from the get go. Loved to see this genre I knew nothing about play out. I have to say that I think it lost itself in later seasons, I never knew what was going on, what biker group they were beating up,  but this year, season 4, was great. I watched every episode until the bitter end. If you decide to commit yourself to the whole series or stop after this season, if you like macho bikers, tough cops, and the rest who hang around them I think you will like SOA.",1425168000,,483,3.9285714285714284

COMPLETELY Unbelievable.  Completely Frustrating since they do the same pathetic things OVER and OVER to get themselves in trouble.  And first off, who the heck would dress up like bikers to escort drugs guns and RPGs.  Yeah, that make allot of sense, way to keep a low profile.  Don't waste your time on this one.

4610534,2,B0058YPGVQ,"Oddly, I wanted Gemma dead even more than Clay by the end of this season - the quivvering lip, I can't take it any more.  That angry, shaking lip as she rages on about ""doing whatever it takes to protect her family"".  Spare me already.  Despite trying to kill everyone around him, Clay remains marginally more palatable.  Now that Jax is at the head of the table, I fully expect Clay and Gemma to team up to kill Jax (or at least Tara) and kidnap the kids, maybe steal way to a cabin in the woods?  I still like Opie, Chibs and Tig, but even Jax's scowl is grating on my nerves here.  What it boils down to is that I don't really like any of them any more.

 Its like so many other shows in that they go from one major crisis to another. Simplistic fixes to every crisis. Fistfights and gunfights every episode to keep the younger crowd interested. The characters seem to forgive and forget pretty easily, everyone of them has done something to each other thats pretty heinous.

4611281,5,B0058YPGVQ,Great show with many surprise twists in the plot. It is probably a realistic portrayal of the motorcycle gang culture.

4611284,5,B0058YPGVQ,"Just an amazing show!  Writing, amazing!  The almost ironic characteristics of the individual characters is very evocative...  Absolute ruthlessness, self-absorption, and the ease of betrayal, combined with absolute love, and loyalty, and 'truth'?  Very believable as I believe we are all born good, innocent and loving, but are ultimately products of our environment to a great degree.  The struggle of trying to grasp the truth of our feelings and the products of our actions under such duress is very believable and bolsters the 'good and evil' exist in us all argument which I make.  Usually with those whom I consider to rely too greatly on external value/moral systems for their own responsibilities.

4611947,4,B0058YPGVQ,"I think it's a 5 star show with a 3 star soundtrack. I don't know if they're trying to be new, hip, fresh or what but the covers of Classic Rock staples are abysmal. Even the 14 notes of whistling they used from Billy Joel's The Stranger... The timing was off just enough I first thought to be an Ennio Morricone sample! If you want to promote a rollicking good rush of entertainment tis best to use CCR's version of Travelin' Band not a cover. No one can race to the finish with that song like Creedence. Many great moments are dampened by poor covers. Good moments can be great if properly punched, driven home, punctuated. No one should ever, ever be allowed to sing Sympathy For The Devil except Mick Jagger. It oughta be law. M. Scorsese understands this even if his choices are a bit obvious.... But you gotta love Otto and ultimately Otto calls the shots. Maybe ""real"" rock is too costly.",1406505600,,895,4.430303030303031

4611949,5,B0058YPGVQ,"This series just continues to surprise me.  It has the best ensemble cast going.  And I've noticed a real connection with the series ""The Shield"".  I saw Dutch (Jay Karnes) in the first season and love that as I always enjoy his work, no matter what kind of character he plays.  I think Lem (Kenny Johnson) showed up in Season 3 and Ronnie (David Rees Snell) as well as Aceveda (Benito Martinez) showed up in this one.  I think Claudette (CCH Pounder) is scheduled to appear in this or the next.  Dare I hope to see Michael Chiklis (Vic Mackey) or Shane (Walton Goggins)?  Was also pleased to see Danny Trejo (Machete, Spy Kids, Con Air).  He plays such a great bad guy!  The rest of the cast continues to turn in stellar performances which make you continue to watch a show about bad people doing bad things!  It has yet to disappoint.",1406505600,,836,4.405228758169935
4611950,4,B0058YPGVQ,Much more interesting and compelling than Season 3. Some pretty powerful drama in this season. Still requires a bit of suspension of belief relative to scope of the business operation and what these guys get away with but very intertwining and fast moving.,1406246400,,256,4.976744186046512

4612000,5,B0058YPGVQ,"Not for the squeamish....Entire series is very violent, strong language and sex scenes (showing all skin except the obvious). About as graphic as Walking Dead but they're fighting people, not zombies. The creator, Kurt Sutter, does such a great job with character development and storyline, you can't help but become immersed in the story. The acting is consistent and excellent. Lots of unexpected twists, symbolic references and every episode leaves you hanging. It's rare you find a show that draws you into the characters emotionally.",1405123200,,538,5.341176470588235

4612076,4,B0058YPGVQ,"I thought I loved the series at first, but I've reduced that opinion overall to ""Like"". The main reason is that in this fourth season I stopped believing it could really happen. Too many wierd things going on. I did really like the way Tara blossomed into a fit queen for Jax. He did everything he could to help her get out, planning to join her when he could, but then she chose to stay, showing a love and dedication I could only wish for in a woman.

SOA is by far the best show, and I will be in a major depression if it ends after season 7. Not sure what I will do without Jax, Gemma and the crew on Tuesday nights! If you are buying this, be sure to buy all the other seasons too, and start with #1 and work your way through. Be prepared to need a few breaks, it can get pretty intense, but I am sure you will quickly find yourself addicted.",1396915200,,480,3.9081632653061225

4612153,1,B0058YPGVQ,"Started out interesting enough but then plots dragged on from episode to episode from season to season moving as slowly as a daytime soap opera.  Also annoying was how one episode would leave you hanging with something dramatic only to reverse what one presumed to have happened.  For example, Juice hangs himself with a chain at the end of one show and you assume that's it for Juice then the next episode we find that the chain breaks or comes loose and Juice is okay again.  Seriously?  Then Clay takes three or four slugs to the chest and we assume that's it for Clay then in the next episode he's sitting up in the hospital on the road to recovery and eventually back in the club.
  After lasting 4 seasons waiting for Clay to get what he deserved, I feel like the writers ""jumped the shark"" in bringing him back.  But they didn't bring me back.  If I want a farce, I'll watch the Marx Brothers.  Oh yeah, and Jax - please stop telling your girlfriend to ""Trust me, I'm not going to let anything happen to you.""  Then she gets kidnapped, a career ending injury, her son stolen, etc etc.  Trust me, Jax isn't to be trusted.",1395705600,3,1127,4.3701923076923075

I am happy to say that this is some of the most entertaining TV in years. It is original but, also sort of like the soaps that my grandmother used to watch. I only say that because of the effect of keeping you hanging so that you absolutely have to see the next program to see what happens next. Think days of our lives only in biker outlaw life.  If you watch this show you will see how easy it is to fall in love with the characters, the actors do an excellent job.",1392508800,,639,3.945736434108527

4612314,3,B0058YPGVQ,"Season Three this season was starting to show some age, now season four seems more of a rec than ever. There is some flashes of brilliance, especially the big reveal at the end of the season (no spoilers). But it doesn't achieve the heights that the best of the lot, season 2 achieved. Overall still a decent show and after already beginning season five, seems like it has some good yet to come. Overall recommended to only people watching the entire series.",1392336000,,458,4.597560975609756

4612342,2,B0058YPGVQ,"Nowhere near as watchable as the first two seasons (Season 3 wasn't very good, either). The writers are struggling to come up with content.

4612410,5,B0058YPGVQ,By Season 4 you should be fully entrenched in the ins and outs of the Sons of Anarchy and all the characters related to them. It's a bit frustrating as you see characters making HUGE decisions with HUGE consequences. But that's part of growing a character right? So definitely a dark time for the Sons. But you'll love it and found yourself rooting for the bad guys as always!,1390867200,,376,4.463768115942029

4612414,5,B0058YPGVQ,While very violent (shockingly so at times) SOA is an extremely well crafted drama. The parallels between the structure of Hamlet and the structure of SOA are clear (especially in the earlier seasons). Every show is well written and expertly shot. A gripping drama that makes you want to keep watching.,1390867200,,302,4.9411764705882355
4612415,5,B0058YPGVQ,This is a great TV show. It is edgy and very tightly written. Kurt Surtee gives us a window into American biker culture that we could only get if we patched up.,1390867200,,160,4.03125

4612475,5,B0058YPGVQ,"Another quality drama that is not produced by the Big 3 networks.  There is some decent stuff on the Big 3 but the real quality dramas are coming from networks like FX & AMC.

This series is one of my favorites and ranks up there with Walking Dead, Justified and Mad Men.

This series is not for the faint of heart, there are graphic scenes from time to time and the very nature of the sub-culture depicted lends itself to a certain level of violence.

The writing is excellent and even the Creator/Exec. Prod. (Kurt Sutter) masterfully portraits a character on the show, Otto Delaney, don't miss his portrayal.",1389398400,,611,4.577981651376147

4612957,5,B0058YPGVQ,"""Sons of Anarchy"" is one of the best series ever, whether on regular broadcast TV, cable or the premium channels.  We've loved every season and this season was one of the best.  The acting is incredibly good (especially Charlie Hunnaman, the awesome Katy Sagal, and a terrific Ron Perlman), the writing is superb, and the production is top notch!  Really, a ""must see""!  And anyone criticizing the choice of Charlie Hunnaman for ""Fity Shades of Grey"" just has not seen this guy act---not only as handsome as Brad Pitt ever was, but he's one of the best actors on any TV series.  Really, just give it a shot----one episode will have you hooked!",1379548800,,643,4.654867256637168

4613009,5,B0058YPGVQ,"This is the season that really gets interesting! It seems like most series start to run out of story lines by Season 4 or 5, but this one hits even harder. Jax still has hope (which is refreshing) but he's also a realist. If I hadn't already devoured the first 3 seasons, I would say, ""now it's starting to get good...."" but it started out great and is getting better.",1378425600,,368,4.271428571428571

The three main characters Jax, Gemma, and Clay are multidimensional and engaging. It is a very interesting twist of a contemporary version of Hamlet. Katey Sagal is really the star. She gets to showcase her true acting talents in this series. Also of note she sings many of the songs on the show's outstanding soundtrack. Check out both the show and the different season soundtracks. Both will have you riveted!",1376611200,,554,4.721649484536083

4613291,5,B0058YPGVQ,"I got into this show late, so I was able to watch Seasons 1, 2, 3 in a marathon style viewing. On one hand I'm glad that I got to overdose on so many episodes at once. On the other hand, I can't believe I missed out on this amazing show for as long as I did.

Since anyone can find many critics reviews, fan sites, and twitter accounts related to this show, I will try to keep my review short and sweet: I made my cousin, my housemate, and my bestie watch this entire series - all at separate times. Thus I have watched the entire series approximately 4 times (as I watched with each of them and once on my own). I have found new layers to the story with every viewing. Each one of them thanked me for introducing them to this show & each one sends me ridiculous amounts of text messages on Tuesday nights when the show is playing live - of course we only reply during commercials because it is impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen when the show is airing.

Overall - this is the first TV show that I actually bought all of the DVD set for each season. This would be the first entertainment item that would accompany me to a deserted island. Although I buy the Amazon Season Pass now with my Roku box, I will still buy the DVDs upon their release just for the extras on the discs. Yes, this show is worth paying for it twice!",1370995200,,1338,4.103053435114504

4613295,5,B0058YPGVQ,"Twist and turn.  Fast pace, who is going to get found out.......though I love this show I hope they can push these characters forward with some needed growth.

4613377,5,B0058YPGVQ,"I have to admit I have been hooked by SOA from the very first episode.  As the first several seasons developed, I began feeling like the show was turning into a soap opera dressed in leathers.  The plot lines revolved around who's screwing who, who's back-stabbing who, who's lying to who... but ultimately, that didn't matter, I eagerly awaited each show.

I love the fact that the backstory is based on Hamlet.  That Jax is playing the part of Hamlet, Clay is Uncle Claudius, Jenna is Hamlet's mother Gertrude and JT is the ghost of Hamlet's murdered father.  You could even find parallels between Jax's best friend Opie and Hamlet's good friend Horatio.  About the only one that doesn't fit the scheme is Jax's girl Tara.  She's certainly no Ophelia, that is unless the writers intend on having her go mad and commit suicide.  Still, I like the way the writers have based the story on one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies. It lends a story a level of class and sophistication that I wouldn't expect in a show about bikers.

Another thing I like about the show is its sense of balance.  It's got everything; action, adventure, romance, intrigue, humor, it really has it all.  One week you're watching the Sons shoot it out with the Mayans, and the next week the show has me in practically in tears as Tig mistakenly kills Opie's wife Donna.

Can't say enough about the acting.  There are no slouches in this cast.  Jax, Jenna and Clay are all superb.  I've even learned to appreciate the minor characters like the sheriff Wayne Unser.  He does an excellent job, as do the other supporting players like Bobby Elvis, Juice, Chibs and Opie.  Too, villans like Agent Stahl and U.S. Attorney Lincoln Potter are extremely well played and multi-dimensional.

Like everyone else, I'm eagerly awaiting season 6.  Can't wait!",1368662400,,1820,4.757188498402556

4613464,1,B0058YPGVQ,"""Sons Of Anarchy: Season Four""
NOTE: Mild spoilers below. Don't freak out.

On its own, this season of SOA would probably get a 4-star rating: the first few episodes were hard to get into and the entire subplot about Juice being afraid of being ""outed"" as an African-American simply didn't ring true: the Sons spent their first two seasons combating the local white supremacist gang, and had expressed a dislike of their ideology. Now, suddenly, they're all racist themselves and Juice is so flipped out about it that he's willing to rat them out to the Feds? Sorry -- I don't buy it. It was way too forced and didn't serve that great a dramatic purpose. Meanwhile, Jax is still wringing his hands about what to do with his life and is still spinning around in the same should-I-stay-or-should-I-go? circles he's been running in for the entire show.  I know this is meant to be a Hamlet parallel, but it's starting to wear thin.  Also, the new Top Cop character was a little too ""quirky"" for my tastes. Still, by the time the second half of the season rolled around, we were transfixed, and wanted to see what was going to happen next. The last couple of episodes were sharp enough to make us eager to see what happens next.

The reason I'm giving the show a 1-star rating, though, is as a protest vote against Amazon's new monopolistic sales policies, in which they are colluding with HBO, Fox and other companies to forbid Amazon customers from reselling their DVDs on Amazon: you can buy ""Sons Of Anarchy"" on Amazon, but if you try to sell it used, suddenly it's a ""restricted item"" and they won't let you. What's worse is they will allow *some* Amazon-affiliated sellers to provide it used, but not regular folks like you and me. The idea is, apparently, to crack down on bootlegs as well as artificially boost the used prices and, I would imagine, to push more customers towards Amazon's vastly inferior download and streaming video services, so that the video companies don't ""lose"" more money through re-sales. Well, since I bought this show brand new, directly from Amazon, I don't think it's a bootleg, and I think that I should be able to resell it there as well, as I've always been able to before. Now, if Amazon wanted to stop ALL used sales on their site altogether, that would be one thing, but playing favorites with ""pre-approved"" sellers seems pretty unfair and smells a bit like monopoly practices to me. Just one more reason to migrate away from Amazon's sphere of influence, I guess. I really don't like the high-handed way Amazon is treating its customers these days.

4613661,5,B0058YPGVQ,"After watching 4 seasons of SOA I have been thoroughly pulled into it. The stories are tight and thought provoking. This is clearly R rated entertainment and not family friendly fare - but it is not just sex, blood and violence. While there is plenty of all of those elements, the characters are strong and well developed and the stories interesting and entertaining. Katey Sagal is outstanding and along with Ron Perlman and Charlie Hunnam, who I was not familiar with before SOA, lead a strong cast. This series is not for everyone and definitely not one for the kids, but if you like your entertainment with an edge for both your id and your ego you have found it. The seasons can stand alone but there is an arc that is best appreciated by watching in sequence. Enjoy.",1362614400,,772,4.561151079136691

After going back and watching a few first season shows it really is clear just how well this show has matured. It does have some very violent scenes, and folks who have trouble with that might consider skipping past. The show creator has said he wanted to make a west coast Sopranos with bikers and he has.

I never watched the show on television because I thought it a bit ""rough"" looking but happened to catch an episode one night and was intrigued.  It just so happened that I had passed over the free streaming of SOA on my Kindle through Prime so I decided to give it a try.  Hey, it was free! What did I have to lose? Started at Season 1, was immediately hooked and am now halfway through season 5 which I purchased because I couldn't help myself! My husband I watch almost every night and love, love, love the show.  It's not just an adrenaline rush, there are human and very emotional elements as well. The lives (and deaths) of the characters and how they evolve keep me interested.  It is easy to become involved in the lives of these fictional characters.  There are the ones I love and those I hate.  I laugh because the dark humor is subtle but superb.  I cry because I can't help it.  Yes, it is possible that I am obsessed....just ask my husband! Can't wait for Season 6...this time I'll be watching!",1361404800,,1068,4.326633165829146

The only ""problem"" is that you really need to watch this show from season 1 onward as there is so much character development throughout that picking it up in the middle would leave the viewer without a ton of necessary backstory.",1361145600,,391,4.507042253521127

4613759,5,B0058YPGVQ,"Some episodes of this season as well as past seasons upload very slowly, cut off unexpectedly and skip but that could be high internet traffic in our area. Otherwise, the audio and video in HD is terrific.

""Sons of Anarchy"" is absolutely fantastic - great writing, plot lines and characters each season!  We have been really enjoying this particular series and highly recommend it.

We do wish that Amazon Prime would update their video library to offer more FREE streaming of additional seasons of their offered series.  The final season (Season 4 of Sons of Anarchy) is dated 11/2011 and Season 5 has to be purchased - expensive at almost $32 per season (HD).  Also, Amazon Prime does not offer that many ""free"" videos/movies or series as part of it's yearly subscription fee so we have been majorly disappointed in the Membership and not sure if we will re-subscribe.  We are looking into if we may be better off subscribing to Hulu Plus, Netflix or Blockbluster to have more choices than what Amazon offers.",1360886400,,1012,4.787356321839081

The few commercials I had seen for it didn't appeal to me at all and my friends boasting fell on deaf ears. After getting Amazon Prime as a gift, we tried it out on the t.v. Sons of Anarchy was one of the freebies and we figured eh why not. We were hooked from that first episode and not only did we stay up until 4am watching but we went through all 5 seasons in 2 weeks (not having commercials is awesome). Of course in 5 seasons not every single episode can be amazing (there are a couple that drag a bit) and some story lines go on too long. Overall the casting is excellent, the writing great, acting is superb and the music/soundtrack is out of this world incredible (Katy Segal has a fantastic singing voice).",1360713600,,793,4.1558441558441555

The music had my 2 year old dancing. Needless to say, it is not the best show for kids. Therefore, I turned it off and picked up where I left off later that night. I was instantly hooked.

This series is easily the best series on Amazon Prime. Perfect for those late nights when the kids are sleeping. Looking for a romantic evening.

This season dials back some of the aspects of season 3 that started to get into the realm of silliness.  The show goes back to being a gritty, raw drama with action scenes: Good stuff, since we love the shoot-em-up action but you can't do that every week without things losing the emotional hit.

And it may come across as strange, but you don't wait for the next episode because you wanna know what happens next (as in Prison break etc) you wait because you absolutely love the show.

The actors are outstanding which makes for a phenomenal show.  If you loved shows like, Deadwood, Oz, The Wire, The Sopranos. Then this show will appeal to you. It's about young man who is the son of the founder of a biker club. While attempting to find himself and figure out who he is and his role in the club he learns some secrets about his father, mother and the man he has loved as a father. It's a very interesting take on what occurs in the lives of bikers.
