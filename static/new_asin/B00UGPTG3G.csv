7037907,5,B00UGPTG3G,"Kids, parents and grandparents love this touching story of a young race car, full of himself, who learns about life and how to respect and relate to those around him.  The story is set on Route 66 through Arizona, and the scenery and locale are exciting as they trace the demise and restoration of the ""Mother Road"" through some of the most spectacular scenery in the West.",1292025600,,373,4.567164179104478
