8128487,2,B000G1R3Z8,"I ordered this DVD thinking it had the Snowflake Bentley story on it.  IT DOES NOT!!! It has ""Crow Boy"" instead.  I guess there's 2 versions of this DVD.  This is not the one advertised.  Very disappointed.",1486425600,,206,4.486486486486487
8128488,5,B000G1R3Z8,"My boys and I own over 40 of the Scholastic Dvd's and I have to rate this as one of the best. All t the stories are based on real people, and the stories are so richly colorful and well done.  This collection is for the older crowd, not the usual 2-8 but 5-10 year olds.  The collection consists of books commonly used in 2 and 3 grade, Mrs. Rumphius, and her lovely lupines.  My favorite is the Pot that Juan Built, which is in the style of The House that Jack built so the format, if not the content, will be familiar to children.  The artwork is truly capitivating as is the narration.  Snowflake Bentley and The Man Who Walked Between the Towers are also remarkable stories that will even teach adults something new.  An excellent selection from scholastic which does not have a repeat on any other of their dvd's!
Just a note - I have commented on one version not knowing there is another version with the Dinosaurs of Waterhouse Hawkins and Jonathan Pryce!  Great voice and great book.. am ordering the other version now!",1352246400,,1027,4.430851063829787
8128489,4,B000G1R3Z8,"I read this book to my 1st Graders so when they hear about the sad story of 9/11, they will have another story they can tell about the twin towers (plus it's a Caldecott Medal book).  The Scholastic video of this book gives added perspective and helps my students realize HOW high up on the tight rope this really was.  They loved the video!",1318550400,,341,4.3125
8128490,3,B000G1R3Z8,"I bought this DVD because one of the same title was on Netflix.  It also had 3 other stories that I really,  really liked.
So I bought this,  thinking it was the same.  It wasn't.  It has 4 stories,  but only 2 are the same as the Netflix one.  I did
find the DVD which was on Netflix on another website and bought 2 copies.  All is well that ends well.",1316390400,,353,3.8732394366197185
8128491,5,B000G1R3Z8,"My kids, 8 and 3, loved to watch these stories and often argued as to which to watch first - great job Scholastic!",1252800000,,114,4.0
8128492,5,B000G1R3Z8,"As a teacher and parent, I'm always on the look-out for quality media. Scholastic videos have been a mainstay for years, and nearly all are wonderful. However, because of the quality and subject matter of the books this collection of shorts is based upon, this dvd is simply a must-have. I can read the books, watch the video, and discuss these stories with my young son, and then read, watch, and discuss these same stories with my 3rd and 4th grade students. A wide breadth and depth of subjects, emotions, concepts -- all of which lend themselves beautifully to use at home or at school.",1184889600,4,590,4.628571428571429
8128493,5,B000G1R3Z8,"My children watch this DVD in my van and I didn't pick up on what the first story was about until the third time around.  It's sad yet inspiring and the kids really like watching it.  Two of the other stories are also taking from real life, and all focus on the human capacity to excel in his or her own way.",1179014400,2,308,3.9516129032258065
8128494,5,B000G1R3Z8,The kids love the books and now enjoy watching their favorite books on DVD.,1168387200,2,75,4.428571428571429
