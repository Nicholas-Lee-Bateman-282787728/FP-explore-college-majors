8106798,3,B000E6TWFY,"This DVD was filmed in 2003, so it makes sense that the production value on this is zero. You can hear cars driving by in the background, the music does not go with what she is doing, and it is very simply made. That being said, she does go through what I consider to be a pretty comprehensive basic moves list for a beginner class, but the teaching is very general.

I would say that if you catch on well, this is a good DVD for you. But if you are not into dance normally, go to a real class because this DVD leaves the door wide open for mistakes and technical flaws. She does teach what I consider to be a very standard technique, so in that respect, this DVD is good. I believe in learning the standard way before you start getting weird with it.

Another questionable portion is the performance; I'm not sure the music she is dancing to is the music you hear on the DVD. Also, in the beginning montage of her performance clips, there is a shot where she is lifting her leg to the audience while on her knees, giving a view which I am sure would not be kosher in most venues. I am sure her later videos are better, but this video struck me as a beginner teaching beginners.",1333584000,,1178,4.162280701754386
