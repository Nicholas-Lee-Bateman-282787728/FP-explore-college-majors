8148258,5,B000F5O1AA,"At this time this is my favorite bellydance video.  The dance that is featured on the cover is awesome!  The best thing about this DVD is the variety.  Many different types of dances (Egyption, folk, modern, cabaret, Lebanese...) and dancers of different sizes.  Not all of these people are skinny minnies or have the look of being fit yet are absolutely great dancers.  There are two routines with men in them.  I would love to see more men in the videos.

I advise any fan of bellydance to get this.",1172102400,6,501,4.5
