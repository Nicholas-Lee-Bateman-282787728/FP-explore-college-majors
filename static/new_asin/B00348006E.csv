8388275,3,B00348006E,"The Eighties and Nineties saw the decline of the Italian Giallo film and this film came on the tail end of the genre.  If you've seen many, you will find the story slightly derivative but it's a pure joy to see such great stalwarts as Fabio Testi, Florinda Bolkan and the smokin' Serena Grandi along for the ride. There is an annoying sub storyline between a retired investigator and his protege that are trying to solve the murders but its worth it for the nifty ending.  Quality is full screen with optional English or Italian Stereo.  Mya Communication continue to amaze me with their surprising number of new titles.  Keep em' coming.",1274054400,10,638,4.669642857142857
