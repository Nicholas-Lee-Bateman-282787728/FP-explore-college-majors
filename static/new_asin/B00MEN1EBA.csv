8671803,5,B00MEN1EBA,"I must first say that I am by no stretch of the imagination an expert martial artist., or even a serious student of it... however, I worked as a Correctional Officer for 28 + years, and had quite a bit of defensive tactics training, and have some SCARS (Special Combat Aggressive Reactionary System) although limited.  I heard of Krav Maga long ago, and decided to see what it was all about, and after reading lots of reviews, decided to go with Total Krav Maga, and I although I am not too far along, I am thus far very impressed with the thoroughness of the training.  In many aspects it reminds me of DT training from my Corrections Officer days, but is far better, in that the DT we were instructed in was more or less defensive in nature.  Being older now, and realizing it takes a lot longer to heal up, and also feeling my age (52), I was wanting something to enable a ""quick ending"" to any possible altercation that may arise, while minimizing bodily injury to myself.  I have not begun the advanced course yet, but after watching through the lessons, it is definitely what I was looking for.
I like the way that the combatives & techniques are taught.  With the multiple views and explanations these are a very good way to get a understanding of the methodology of Krav Maga, and with time & proper training should fill the bill quite nicely.
I also appreciate that the instruction isn't arrogant, but genuine. Glad I purchased this, and am looking forward to learning from it.",1519689600,,1486,4.529850746268656
8671804,5,B00MEN1EBA,"Total Krav Maga is great. The instruction is clear and to the point. Each technique is shown from various angles and explained well. The set even has classes to follow. This is a good way to learn Krav Maga at home and earn credit for it. I recommend getting this set if you want to learn a valuable, life saving skill.",1518739200,,319,4.245901639344262
8671805,5,B00MEN1EBA,"These DVD's are awesome!  The DVD's illustrate the techniques at full speed, then break them down slowly and at different angles...making it easy to really grasp the concepts.",1461110400,,175,5.25

8671807,5,B00MEN1EBA,"Very detailed instruction. I also bought the the beginner to inermediate set, well worth the money. Everything you need to know!",1448841600,,128,5.142857142857143
8671808,5,B00MEN1EBA,"These DVDs are just as awesome as the Beginner to Advanced DVDS. I would suggest that you order both sets if you don't have the first, yet. All techniques are clearly explained and demonstrated several times so that anyone can grasp them. Whether your goals are self defense, weight loss, or both, These DVDs can take you there.",1437782400,2,328,4.672413793103448
8671809,4,B00MEN1EBA,"These are good DVDs.  They show you the move from multiple angles, then break it down, then invite you to go step by step.  I haven't broken into the Ground portion yet.  I have a background in JJ, BUT the Krav Maga will show you the reality of the ground fight.  Do you know if the guy has a knife?  Do you know if he has a gun?  Good things to know if you are going to the ground with some punk.  As far as Krav goes, these are worth the money.  I would encourage you to also study Systema, Kali, and or Escrima.  They can all be easily linked together.  Worth the money indeed.  I used to train in KM but its been a few years.  These DVDs are bringing me back.  Get em",1427328000,7,671,3.8814814814814813
8671810,5,B00MEN1EBA,"Very impressed with the DVDs and the instructor.  Video angles are done well.  As a kravist and instructor watching different instructors styles is very helpful.  The warmups, drills, and demos are nicely done.",1422662400,5,210,5.303030303030303
8671811,5,B00MEN1EBA,"Although this product was damaged in shipping.. I got a next response from stating how bad they felt, even though this was not their issue. They then told me they would replace this product free of charge to me, even though I had all intentions to re-purchase this.  This is a great product, and as you can see even a greater company to work with..  Thank you so much!!!",1422576000,4,370,4.3478260869565215
8671812,5,B00MEN1EBA,"Ordered the DVDs  and am very happy with my purchase.  Ive tried other follow along courses on DVD before and some are not very user friendly and are hard to grasp all the presented info.  Not the case with this DVD set, the instructor does an awesome job breaking down each technique into very easily managed and understandable slices or sections.  The material covered is great and you get quite a bit of info over the five dvds not just the same concepts rehashed over and over.  Material is well organized also which greatly helps.  I would order it again in a heart beat.  Keep up the good work.  Train Hard.",1411430400,7,613,4.45945945945946
