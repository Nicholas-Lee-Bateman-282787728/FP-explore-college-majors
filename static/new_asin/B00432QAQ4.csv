8748156,5,B00432QAQ4,Don starts off this video with a tribute to the Philadelphia Spectrum where the Flyers won 2 Stanley Cups.  Don takes us through the Flyers game with the Soviet Red Army team in 1976.  Some folks claim to not like the tougher aspect of Hockey that the Flyers played but remember that it was this group of boys from Canada playing in Philadelphia that sent the all-powerful Red Army retreating off of the ice- literally.  That piece combined with the traditional goal and hit highlight segments matched to fast paced music make for a great Hockey video.  Only one problem- where are the new Don Cherry DVDs?,1348531200,,606,4.635514018691588
8748157,5,B00432QAQ4,"We have every one of Don Cherry's annual hockey videos, right back to when they were on tapes.  The format hasn't changed much, although his dress has become even more outrageous.  Personally, I have never been a big fan of glorifying the big hits, especially those to the head, and in this version, he goes on and on about the Broad Street Bullies, which is exactly what they were.  They played goon hockey, which regrettably was the fashion of the day; thank heavens more skilled teams came along and put that type of hockey to bed.  Don't mistake, I love good, hard-nosed hockey and a good clean hit is as great to see as a nice goal, but when you are intent on injuring someone, I lose interest.  That said, the rest of the video is vintage Don, with great hits, great goals and great plays.  His section on weird plays was funny.  All in all, a great buy and an essential in the library of any hockey fan.",1293840000,2,910,4.349112426035503
