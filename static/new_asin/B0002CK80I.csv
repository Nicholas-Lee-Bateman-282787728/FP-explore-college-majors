2076299,4,B0002CK80I,"Kim Basinger has the role of a very attractive spoilt brat (with a Ferrari) in this entertaining made for TV movie. It offers many twists up to the surprise ending and a couple of very good performances. Robert Culp seems to enjoy his role very much, he ominously stares into binoculars and crawls out of bushes with an insane grin at odd moments. All very hush hush. Equally good is Nancy Marchand a the possessive mother of one of the main characters and the attractive and little seen Ann Dusenberry (Cutter's Way) as one of the many ""diversions"". The title of this review contains a spoiler - sorry - but should not detain anyone from watching and enjoying this little entertainment of a movie.",1179619200,,698,4.637096774193548

8026108,2,B0002CK80I,"Who Murdered Joy Morgan [aka Killjoy] is a decent suspense movie.  This print by CineVu is not the greatest.  The color values have gone awry, which could be expected in a film this old.  There is some very annoying audio interference, and my guess is that this print was taped off of television.  The box also states that this is a widescreen edition, which it is not.  TV movies from 1981 weren't filmed in widescreen; the only way it could be in wide screen were if the top and bottom of the picture were cut.  Try to find a better print of this movie than CineVu's.  4 stars for the movie and performances; 2 stars for the DVD.",1273708800,4,631,4.296610169491525
8026109,4,B0002CK80I,"I originally saw this made for tv movie in the early 80s when it was titled ""KillJoy"".  It contains an early performance by Kim Basinger.  Lots of twists and turns with a surprise ending.  Worth the money.",1222905600,3,205,4.486486486486487
8026110,3,B0002CK80I,"I remember seeing this movie on tv years ago and really liked it. It is a good mystery with every character looking and acting guilty at some point in the story. Everyone does a good job acting and most are familiar faces: Kim basinger, Robert Culp, Stephen Macht, John Rubenstein and late great Nancy Marchand. The overall quality of the transfer is fair and that is why only 3 star rating.",1214352000,7,391,4.52112676056338
