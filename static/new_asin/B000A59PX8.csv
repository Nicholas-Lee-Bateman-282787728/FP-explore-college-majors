2359959,4,B000A59PX8,"""For the Love of Aaron"" is a very touching film.  It deals with the challenges a mother with mental illness faces while raising her son as a single parent.  Raising kids is tough under the best of circumstances but this mom dealt with difficulties most of us thankfully will never know.  Her mental illness caused financial problems and also a co-dependant relationship with her son that might be viewed in a negative light by ""authorities"" but in reality showed that once again, love triumphs.  Meredith Baxter did a great job and the young man who played her son will capture your heart.  The chemistry between them was delightful and there were moments of humor and tears but lots and lots of ""special"" moments just because a mom and son were spending time together doing ordinary things.  Expect to shed some tears at the threat of this precious child being removed from the custody of the person who loves him more than anyone else in this world.  Due to the serious topic this movie covers, it would be more appropriate for teens and up.  This movie clearly made the point that financial excess does not guarantee that a child's true needs are being met.  The sacrificial love of a parent does more for a child than all the ""things"" this world has to offer.",1196553600,13,1263,4.62780269058296
2359960,5,B000A59PX8,"For the Love of Aaron is a wonderful family movie about a talented, erratic mother trying to retain custody of her very poised, loving son against all odds. The mother has great supporting friends, and Aaron's love for her is inspiring. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes heartwarming, family movies without gore or nastiness.",1178409600,22,347,5.0

8074520,5,B000A59PX8,"I have rarely come across a piece of drama that examines the life of a family coping with mental illness in such a fair and even-handed way, and without an overdose of histrionics or melodrama. I speak with considerable knowledge when I say that this film accurately and sensitively portrays the sometimes co-dependent relationship between a mother and her caring young son. This is a film to watch if you really want to understand what a young carer is, or if you really want to understand all sides of the debate around such families. Meredith Baxter captures the physical and emotional nuances of a sufferer of mental illness who still has her faculties at the same time, and Keegan Macintosh nails the part of the kid who has to be flexible enough to cope with any situation that arises, whilst retaining some childhood. You'll want to comfort Baxter's Margaret Gibson, and you'll want to hug Macintosh's Aaron. This film will leave you re-examining things you thought you understood.",1396569600,,988,4.886904761904762

8074524,4,B000A59PX8,"The heartwarming story of a schizophrenic mother trying to take care of her son, who really seems to be the one taking care of her. Meredith Baxter does an excellent job, totally natural. This movie is somewhat boring, but I keep boring movies if they have top-notch acting.",1316131200,,274,4.729166666666667
8074525,4,B000A59PX8,"This movie was very disturbing in its treatment of neglected children.  It involves an 8 year old boy (extremely well acted by Keegan MacIntosh) living with his mother, who is mentally ill and abuses substances.  She leaves him alone overnight, provides no meals for him, is regularly passed out in bed when he returns from school, and treats him like dirt the whole movie.  When social services tries to remove him, her only defense is that she really loves him.  The ending is that she is allowed to keep him, and that is presented as a good thing.  Hopefully, no severely neglected children saw this, as they will think that they are supposed to be treated this badly -- and that they are responsible for taking care of their scumbag parents.

The redeeming factor was the appeal of Keegan MacIntosh.  He had the right blend of disgust and resignation.  However, for some reason the director had him be happy when his idiot parent got custody back -- he should have been screaming ""NO""!  I think TV movies need to quit making heroes and heroines out of monstrous parents.",1305244800,2,1074,4.670212765957447

8074527,3,B000A59PX8,"As a guy who had a troubled mother, I found this movie interesting. The part of the troubled mom was played well.  However, the part of the son, although well played in terms of acting, was far too idealistic. It was too nice. Too clean.  A son who has such a troubled mother would be quite troubled himself. This was not shown correctly in this film.  Also I thought the family origins of the mother's troubles were hit upon far too lightly.  The film could have been greatly strengthened as a healing medium by a better analysis of the origins of her problem and how they worked themselves out through her life and into her own family structure.",1236384000,2,647,4.4576271186440675
8074528,1,B000A59PX8,"I did not like Meredith Baxter's acting in this movie.  She did not seem to fit the part.  Also, there was a monotone feeling throughout the movie.  No rises and falls.  It did not stir any feelings in me.  I feel it should have been a more moving drama.",1231286400,,254,4.1020408163265305
8074529,1,B000A59PX8,"I bought this sight unseen because I like Meredith Baxter, but
unlike ""The Kissing Place"" which was excellent, this TV movie was bad.
It was corny, over-sentimental, and totally unconvincing in plot and
execution.  I may have seen it when it first played, and turned it off
before the end, which I also did this time.  It has all the character-
istic features that give some TV movies a bad name.  Mom loves her son,
but is mentally off, and is in danger of losing him.  The problem is
her part is played quirky, almost comedically, undercutting the reality
of her predicament.  Not a believable moment in this mess.",1199318400,4,616,4.614678899082569
