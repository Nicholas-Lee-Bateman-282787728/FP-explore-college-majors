A fantastic dream through knowledge and poetry. Some insignifants things becomes arts and essentials.",1351900800,,156,5.541666666666667
3762590,5,B001PYD0LG,"If you're a nature or wildlife enthusiast this collection is a must-have for you. With so many of Painleve's short films, this DVD collection provides endless hours of pleasure. I especially enjoyed the Sounds of Science section, which is eight of Painleve's short films with an ambient rock soundtrack by band Yo La Tengo. The music seems to enhance the hypnotic quality of the images presented in the documentaries. Although some of the narration and title cards border on the ludicrous, Painleve nontheless offers unforgettable and mesmerizing images and you're left wondering about the amazing techniques used to capture them.",1246924800,10,630,5.31

JEAN PAINLEVE THROUGH HIS FILMS

3762592,5,B001PYD0LG,"For those of us generally fatigued by the apparent cultural and commercial compulsion to identify genre; to separate the ideas of ""art"" and ""science"" and ""life"" into discrete, highly defined clots, there is the work of Jean Painleve. In addition to pioneering entirely new techniques in revealing many things previously unseen, Painleve's images are startling in their content and composition, transcending the purely documentary by the application of an aesthetic sense as refined as the nature it observes. Droll, playful and informative on multiple levels, these films are so immersive as to be literally saturated. With color. With image. With detail. With ideas. With associations. With knowledge. Criterion has done us all a service by placing this work within easy reach, ready to continually remind us of how compelling just being can be.",1240358400,39,846,5.368421052631579
