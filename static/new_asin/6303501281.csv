665584,5,6303501281,"One of my top-ten favorite movies and my favorite romantic comedy. In order for a romantic comedy to work for me, I have to be able to fall in love with the girl. When I first saw Minnie Driver on the screen, I  thought: ""No way!"" But Benny won me over and is my favorite  romantic comedy character. How can such a plain, frumpy looking girl  radiate such incredible beauty with her smile and character? I am happy to  see Minnie Driver has gone on to a modest degree of success and an Academy  Award nomination. She has certainly earned it but Benny is still her best  character. I highly recommend this movie to romantic comedy fans. There are  some serious issues involved in this movie and they are handled very well.  The ending is perfect and took me by pleasant suprise.",932083200,,777,4.422535211267606
665585,5,6303501281,"in high school, college or life- take heart!!  Benny is not the most beautiful girl from Knockglen but she is the one that ends up with handsome Jack Foley.  Chris O'Donnell plays Jack the big man on campus that every  girl wants.  Minnie Driver plays a genuinely sweet girl who never really  wanted anything out of life except for Jack.  Despite the selfish  machinations of Nan, Benny strikes a blow for all the sweet girls who  wanted the handsome seemingly unattainable guy.",914198400,,478,4.7439024390243905

665788,4,6303501281,"I really love the book - one of my favorites - and I really enjoyed this film, though it was a water-down version of the book.

I appreciated that this film stayed true to the physical description of Benny, who was described as a big girl.  One of my favorite scenes was that Jack's father admired her, frustrating and embarrassing Jack further.

There are some differences from the book, but I want to focus on the film, which was quite lovely.  Benny might not be gorgeous, but she is delicate, intelligent, witty, attractive, and full of dreams, and you understand Jack's attraction.  Jack is the handsome med student she meets at university, whom she falls very much in love.

The scenes between Benny and Jack are warm-hearted, and you understand why Jack falls in love in return.

Minnie Driver brings a perfect light to Benny, making her charismatic and endearing, and Chris O'Donnell is wonderfully sincere and charismatic as Jack.

Saffron Burrows becomes a pivotal character because of her beauty, and I appreciate her depth here.

This is a lovely light romantic film, though not a comedy.  Really soft and entertaining.",1441497600,,1131,4.87434554973822

665876,5,6303501281,"While it is now a week after St. Patrick's Day--and the 20th anniversary of this film's premiere-- March is the perfect month in which to pay homage to this cinematographic gem, based on the late Maeve Binchy's story of life, love, and betrayal  among a group of college students in 1957 Ireland.
  We get a brief glimpse of the early lives of the three main characters on the day of their First Communion in Knockglen in 1949. They include Eve Malone( Louisa Maher), an orphan raised by nuns, Nan Mahon( Pamela Cordello) the  beautiful daughter of an alcoholic father(John Kavanaugh),and the plump heroine, Bernadette ""Benny"" Hogan(Dearbhla O'Farrell), an only child whose parents dote on her.
  After church, they visit the cottage that Eve inherited from her parents, which is being kept for her by the nuns, and encounter the wealthy Simon Westward(Eve's cousin, according to the novel, played by a cold Colin Firth, who often sees through and past people rather then sees them individually) on his mount, little realizing how much impact he and the cottage will have on their lives.
 Eight years later, Nan and her family have long since moved to Dublin( although the novel states they were not childhood friends, but met later), and Eve and Benny( the naturally beautiful, sleek-haired Geraldine O' Rawe, and the superb Minnie Driver in her first film, whose plump face and curled tendrils are reminiscent of Da Vinci's portrait of Ginevra Di Benci) are convent school graduates. As Benny waits outside, Eve enters the Westward's mansion where she petitions for them to pay for her education( as her father was the family's gardener).
 Her visit is a successful one, and with University sashes flying, the two head to the University of  Dublin where Eve boards in a convent, and Benny attends daytime classes only to have to take the 6:10 bus  back to Knockglen at day's end.
 They reunite with Nan( Saffron Burroughs) and meet campus rugby star and pre-med student, Jack Foley( a ruggedly handsome Chris O'Donnell, well in tune with his Irish roots).
 At home, we see Benny's routine with her parents( Mick Lally, Britta Smith), and her ambivalent encounters with her father's men's clothing store clerk, Sean Walsh( Alan Cumming) whom she describes as ""creepy"", and whom, as we will see in due time, she can't pay enough to have removed from her life, although her parents want her to marry him for the sake of the business..She complains about her predicament to her priest( Seamus Forde) in the confessional, and her life at home versus her life as a student in Dublin--a conflict that will be  one of the prime issues in this story. Throughout her life, Benny expressed her desires, but ended up having to pretend to be happy with what her parents gave her when she wasn't. While her parents were nice, well-meaning people, we shall see how her father is doomed by his own inflexibility.
 Amid a priestly sermon, and the re-enforcement, of contemporary Irish Catholic mores versus those of the Trobrian Islanders in a lecture by Professor, Flynn(Ciaran Hinds), Benny begins a relationship with Jack, Eve with his friend, Aidan Lynch( Aidan Gillen), and especially after a dance, Nan raised to believe her beauty could get her anything, sets her sights on Simon Westward, whom she fails to realize is only a poser at this point, struggling to maintain his family's social standing. Once they begin a relationship, they go very far very fast, using Eve's abandoned cottage for their trysts, arousing the curiosity of the nuns who tend to it in the daytime.
 A few tragedies and misguided actions will alter the course of events for all involved, and while the film is not completely in sync with its namesake novel, the romantic ending is highly suitable for the screen, although it leaves behind the novel's more justifiable finis.
 All in all, viewers are treated to a winning cast, a great storyline, and the lolling, natural beauty of the Emerald Isle in all its splendor.",1427155200,,3985,4.890207715133531
665877,5,6303501281,"**""Just when you think love is out of your reach""........As being one hundred percent Irish myself, this movie is one of my personal favorites starring Chris O'Donnell and the introduction of Miss Minnie Driver..........Coming from a small village in Ireland were  three small children who are not only close but are like sisters and being inseperable as well.  There is Eve Malone, Nan MaHon and Bernadette ""Benny"" Hogan. After their Holy Communion, it was't long after,  that Nan and her family moved to Dublin, but Eve and Benny never left each other's side.  In 1957, it was time for the girls to leave the roost to attend college.  Of course there were  rules that applied to the girls.  Eve (portrayed by Miss Geraldine O'Rawe) who was an orphan and raised by the nuns, had to once again reside in a convent in Dublin and Benny (portrayed by Minnie Driver)  was told by her parents that she had to come home every night on the bus instead of doing what she really wanted, to live on campus.  Being nervous the very first day was totally surreal to them except when a pretty redhead walked right by their side and it was Nan!  The three girls were reunited once again.  Benny always believed that no boy would ever look at her twice.  She always had a low self-esteem about herself.  To her way of thinking, she was too plain, not pretty at all, had a weight problem while persistently putting herself down in front of others. But as she slowly walked up the stairs and saw a dashing athelete and the most handsomest boy she ever laid eyes on who actually looked at her with a genuine smile, her heart skipped a thousand beats.  His name was Jack Foley (portrayed by Mr. Chris O'Donnell) and Benny fell instantly in love.  Jack was the brightest med student at the university and when he looked down the stairs and saw Benny, he also saw such beauty within.  He made  up his mind right then and there, that Benny was different in spite of all the girls he's ever been out with and he planned to learn more about her.  So, Jack invited Benny to the college ball.  For Jack holding Benny in his arms while they danced, did the unthinkable.  He could have sworn it was fireworks.  For Benny, dancing with Jack was a dream come true and she felt the oddest thing, fireworks!....Soon after all three girls would experience first love, heartache, betrayal,  and a very great loss among each other but Benny always made a promise to herself.  You always stick to the people you love no matter what!..............thank you",1425600000,,2519,4.573660714285714

665884,3,6303501281,"I remember when this came out and I couldn't see it, so I read the book instead. I still have it to this day and often go back and re-read my favorite parts. While the movie is beautiful to look at and the settings lush and vibrant, the overall translation of Maeve Binchy's novel leaves something to be desired. For fans of the book, there is a HUGE chunk of the plot missing, most of it relevant to Eve and Benny's life in Knockglen. For one thing, there is no Mother Francis, the nun who raised Eve and is a delightful character, full of warmth and grace. Also, the girls did not meet Nan until they got to university and only after Eve is involved in a traffic accident that introduces Jack and his friend Aiden. Though I did find that Aiden Gillen (Littlefinger from GOT) was a cutie back in the day. Still I sorely missed the novel's version and his witty repartee with Eve was a loss I mourned greatly.

As for the other characters, Chris O'Donnell is fine but slightly flat as Jack, while Minnie Driver isn't quite the awkward but lovable girl I grew fond of in the novel. Alan Cumming as Sean Walsh was excellent casting, he practically oozes smarmy down to his greasy hair. As for the plot, the book is far better at laying it out with its simple but intricate story of Benny, who is never comfortable in her own skin and desperately in love with Jack. It's rather sad that the movie didn't explore her journey from awkward teenager to confident young woman.

The movie plods along with supporting characters introduced but never fully fleshed out. We see Nan's father but not his abusive nature, nor her work-weary mother who works at the hotel and pins her dashed dreams for a better life on her beautiful daughter, filling Nan's head with ideas of the life she wants but will never have. Colin Firth as Simon Westward was adequate as the spineless jellyfish who will ruin Nan's life and destroy her friendships with both Eve and Benny. I didn't like how they left out his kid sister, Heather, who becomes friends with Eve, but I suppose there was no room for that.

There are a lot of things missing from this movie that is better handled in the book, such as village life, scheming neighbors, prejudices and how appearances aren't always what they seem. For Benny, the book takes her from lovelorn only child of older parents, desperate to exert her independence, to a young woman who has to step up and find her place in the world when her father dies.

I wish the ending had stayed true to the novel. Here, Jack's dalliances and betrayals are sugar-coated with a happily ever after. In the book, he strayed more than once and still had the gall to look Benny in the eye. At the end of the novel, the many friends are gathered on the beach for an impromptu celebration, and Benny is enjoying the attentions of a young man who she knows won't break her heart. So comes Jack, fresh from escaping Nan's clutches, and his friends can hardly look at him. Poor Benny forgives him but when he thinks she will take him back, she turns away, knowing he isn't the moon and stars and she can go on.

I like that ending. It was what Benny was supposed to be. Confident in herself, accepting she will never be a size 2, and knowing that there are other fish in the sea.

Read the book and watch the movie only if you have to.

I think Benny would agree.",1415059200,,3355,4.401612903225806

It reflects social class, the differences in family, education, sex, and even embezzlement. It is the story of a college aged young woman, unknowing of the life in the big city and the true attraction of ""boys and girls."" The main character, Minnie Driver's character, is challenged by friends, so-called friends and her first real love. On top of it all, she is a good Catholic girl and is dominated by a loving set of parents who are dictatorial nonetheless. It is a story of true strength of character, and a young woman coming of age.",1386720000,,706,4.566929133858268
666029,4,6303501281,"This charming little film deals with the relationships of three young girls in 1950s Ireland.  As they grow up and begin to attend college, their relationships shift as boys enter the picture and religious and social stigmas begin to pry into their budding sexuality.  Benny, the frumpy introverted one, finds the eyes of Jack, a social and popular athlete.  Nan, the beautiful and confident one, falls for a wealthy, older man and soon her decisions start to fray the fibers of her relationships with Benny and even threaten Bennys relationship with Jack.

This was the rise of Drivers star (where is she?) and happened right in the crux of ODonnells rise to fame.  It has a lot of charm and Driver is wonderful here.  Sadly, the film suffers in its development of two key characters and winds up being somewhat irritating because of it.  Alan Cumming and Colin Firth are saddled with truly terrible characters who are developed in the most clich&eacute;d of ways, especially Cumming, who portrays a complete and total creep.  The idea that no one but Benny notices how creepy he is is a problem, since hes so obvious about it all.

After it being so long since I had last seen it I was a little nervous on how it would hold up against the test of time.  Of course the fact that it was essentially a period piece helped.  I find that period pieces have the best chances of not being ruined when watched years later.  Circle of Friends stands up to that test of time and comes out fairly well.  Of course it's decades later and I know what Chris O'Donnell looks like all grown up (same with the ever gorgeous Minnie Driver).  I also understand the content a little better now that I'm not a little girl watching a movie solely because 'the cute boy from The Three Musketeers' was in it.

Based on Maeve Binchy's best selling novel, the film ensemble cast is led by Chris O'Donnell, Minnie Driver, Alan Cumming, and Colin Firth. Driver, Cumming, and Firth were all still relatively unknown when this film was made; Chris O'Donnell was the biggest star at the time.

 Minnie Driver and Chris O'Donnell play a young couple falling in love, but their path to happiness isn't always sure or easy. Driver plays one of three young Irish women who are encouraged to go to college, but ultimately to marry and have a family. Set in Ireland after WWII, social mores are starting to change- but in many ways, the fate of the young women remain tied to the precepts of the Catholic Church of the time.

Don't read if you don't want to know, but they altered the end of the movie to give it a Hollywood, fairy tale, boy-gets-the-girl ending. The most wonderful point to the book was that Benny does NOT take Jack back at the end - she realizes that she deserves better for herself. A valuable lesson obliterated in the film version.

It is one of my all-time favorite books.  I guess that does a disservice to the movie because if I had seen it first, I am sure I would have appreciated it much more.

The best thing about the movie was the casting of the main characters.  Minnie Driver is beyond excellent as Benny.  She is gorgeous, poignant in the role.  Eve, who is such an important part of the book, is almost totally overlooked in the movie, along with her life growing up as an orphan in the convent.

There were just so many important pieces left out of the film, such as life in the village, Benny's parents, Nan's parents.  And why change the whole ending of the book?  To me that just made less of Benny and didn't show her true integrity.

My suggestion:  read the book.  It is written so descriptively and with such character development, you will be able to visualize it as you read anyway.  If they were going to make this movie based on such a masterpiece, they should have lengthened it and really did a more true adaptation of Binchy's finest work.

This is not a terrible film.  There are many good things about it - casting, scenery, fair story.  But if given the choice and you want to do both, watch the movie and THEN read the book.",1300752000,3,1468,4.90650406504065

In the movie, none of Eve's spirit and hurt comes through at all, nor did Nan's desperate desire for a better life, or the fact that she was actually a very good friend to Bennie (Bernadette)in the beginning.  However, Minnie Driver did an excellent job in the lead role, and she alone earned the two stars I gave this movie.

I did enjoy seeing Ireland.  I think the Irish music was a bit much, actually taking away from the mood of the movie (if there was a mood to begin with).  It felt like a Lucky Charms commercial.  I would have liked less music, more story detail.

Bennie, the girl who lives in relative comfort, falls in love first with a boy named Jack.  Her parents, however, want to set her up with a sleazy man who works for them in her father's shop. Eve is being brought up by nuns in a very strict environment.  The third friend lives in dire poverty with an alcoholic father.  It is she that wants to marry for money.

The movie is sweet and poignant, with the inevitable ups and downs of girls in love, betrayals by each other and by men. The photography is beautiful and made me want to return to Ireland again.

Driver is wonderful as an exceptional girl whose boyfriend has the brains to see beyond her plain appearance.  Few films transmit the joy of discovery of youth:  sex, of course, but also ideas that go beyond the confines of family and village.  It is a time of opening out, when you can choose who you want to be while you know you are losing something from childhood as well.  The film is pitch perfect for this.

At the heart of the film are also terrible betrayals.  These things can cause such terrible pain when one is so young and open, so ready to embrace the new without seeing the dangers.  It is where the true person begins to emerge, in spite of mistakes but also deeper motives and capabilities.  We can grow beyond this early, and most of us must.  As I watched this sensitive portrayal,  I remembered my own first loves with pain and joy - all the potential, all the disappointment, all the growth.  At this, the film succeeded for me at the deepest level.

I hadn't watched this and years and popped the DVD in to see if I wanted to keep it or resell it.  I think I'll keep it.  I'd forgotten how good a movie it is.  It's such a relief these days to see a film with so many reasonable, believable characters when so many movies now seem to sell themselves on outlandishness.

It was HUGELY refreshing to see a girl who really is big--tall and solid--playing a character that's supposed to be big.  She is not at all unattractive and is not portrayed as plain, awkward, or ""nerdy"" (as un-beauties usually are).  She's just not a silver-screen sylph, and thankfully the movie doesn't punish her for it or make a lot of ugly-duckling jokes at her expense.  Hooray, Minnie Driver!

Geraldine O'Rawe is also great, feisty but not heartless, sensible, and intelligent.  Saffron Burrows has less of a part but it's clear that she's naive and got in over her head, and not just a heartless vamp.  It's clear why the three girls are friends but the characters are not played so much alike that they seem flat.  Colin Firth is utterly colorless, but he has a minor part, and his flatness is appropriate for the role (Mr. Darcy fans will probably be disappointed, though).",1218412800,2,1421,4.591269841269841

Yes, the book is completely different from the Pat O'Connor film (esp the ending and the Coldagh/Fonsie storyline...which were two of the best things about the book for me) -- but it can still be enjoyed on its own. What made me want to own the movie was the scene between Eve and Nan in Eve's cottage kitchen. I loved Eve's monologue, and it still gives me chills. The casting for Eve, Nan, Sean and Benny was perfect.

The DVD itself does not offer much by way of extras.

666395,2,6303501281,"Maeve Binchy's ""Circle of Friends"" was the first -- and only -- novel I've read cover-to-cover in one day, and then immediately read it again the next day. All 600 pages of it. I fell in love with the characters and the secrets surrounding them, the intricate goings-on of life in a small Irish village. I was so sad when the book ended because it meant I'd never find out what would become of Benny, Eve, Nan and Jack in the future. It is one of my favorite all-time novels, and I recommend it to everyone. So you can imagine my excitement when, about a year after reading the novel, ""Circle of Friends"" was made into a movie. I couldn't wait to see it.

To my horror, the very first scene ruined the entire film for me. Why? Because it showed three little girls -- who we soon learn are Benny, Eve and Nan -- skipping through the woods in their childhood home of Knockglen, Ireland.

To those of you who have never read the novel, this will mean nothing to you. You're thinking, ""So what? What's the big deal about that scene?""

But those of you who have read the novel, and probably loved it as much as I did, will understand my disappointment. That's because, in the novel, Benny and Eve grew up in Knockglen together but didn't meet Nan until they went to college in Dublin. Nan never lived in Knockglen, ever. She had no history there, no one in Knockglen knew anything about Nan until Benny and Eve brought her there for a visit.

So this seemingly innocent first scene of the film absolutely changes the entire story. While the film parallels the novel in many ways, there is no way it could do the novel justice by so blatantly changing the course of history in these characters' lives. I remember spending the rest of the time watching the film  with the knowledge that it would never live up to my expectations, having had the benefit of reading the beautifully-written novel beforehand.

There are very few films which are successfully adapted from novels. This adaptation DEFINITELY did not succeed, at least from the viewpoint of someone who has read the novel. If you've never read the novel, you will probably enjoy the film. But if you HAVE read the novel, don't waste your time -- you'll be sadly disappointed.",1108512000,7,2228,4.516129032258065

Benny falls in love with Jack, who is also at the Uni and plays on the Rugby team. Eve falls for Aiden, one of Jack's friends and Nan is after the rich Simon.

666508,5,6303501281,"Set in post-World War II Ireland, namely the late 1940's and late 50's, Circle Of Friends tells of three girls, Eve, who was raised in a convent because her parents died, the stunning Nan Mahon, and the plain but pleasant and charming Benny Hogan, who's father is the local tailor.  She narrates the film from time to time, and Minnie Driver's charming voice aids in what's quite a charming little movie about being sure of and true to oneself despite changes.

The three go to the college in Dublin, attend classes, and go back on the 10 past 6 bus to the village.  In an anthropology class, she learns of an obscure tribe and their culture, one of which is that men and women mingle freely without shame or guilt, a contrast to the repressive Catholic upbringing the girls have.  But this learning also parallels her meeting Jack Foley, a handsome blonde with blue eyes and a nice smile.  She's quite taken when he asks her out to a dance, only to be gradually disillusioned when he doesn't as time goes on.  When he finally does ask her, she tells him that she doesn't like being messed about, but further that despite being a rhinoceros, a reference to her perceived bigness, she has a thin skin.  She is heartened that he feels comfortable talking to her honestly.  He sees that she's all there, more grounded, sure of herself.  In contrast, Jack wants to play rugby but is going for the medical program because of his father's wishes and despite the fact that he faints at the sight of blood.  Through her interactions, she learns that she is capable of being loved and to love, but she never goes all the way.  Jack indeed is a preferable pick from the oily Sean Walsh, an employee of Mr. Hogan's shop who aspires to be a partner, but also wants to marry Benny.  It's further his dream to run the shop when Mr. Hogan retires.  However, Benny is quite turned off by Sean, much to her parents' disappointment.  This learning at school is making her self-aware, and she's made up her mind who she wants to marry, should she do so.  What's the point of learning all that knowledge, only to go back to her little village and be a good little wife, something also explored in the later Mona Lisa Smile.

The divide between Protestants and Catholics is seen here in the form of Simon Westward, a member of the landowning family who wants to marry the right girl.  That is what Nan is looking for, a real man, seeing her peers as just boys, as tryouts.  Things don't go the way she plans, leading her to disrupt Benny and Jack.

It's easy to see why Minnie Driver became a star.  As the shy, hopeful, intelligent, and sensitive Benny, she's a fresh face.  And she's unique with that slightly wide face of hers, She is mostly seen without much makeup, and she still looks wonderful, and with that accent and beaming countenance, totally believable as a daughter of the Emerald Isle.  I'd definitely go for someone like her.  Geraldine O'Rawe lends strong support as Eve, who turns out to be more loyal and true to Benny.  Chris O'Donnell also gets a thumbs up as Jack, a likeable enough person, less sure of himself, well-meaning, but with a few failings.

As in all the other films I've seen him in, Alan Cumming (Sean) is another slimy, lizard-like, fawning toadie (Titus, Spiceworld, Eyes Wide Shut).  He is a bit pathetic with his greasy black hair and sickly smile, but he's a character to be reviled as time goes on.

With a nice closing song, ""You're The One,"" sung by Maire Brennan and Shane McGowan, Circle Of Friends is a film that doesn't go for the predictable drama of most romance movies.  No, this is a movie that's all there.",1090886400,50,3639,4.514503816793893
666509,2,6303501281,"Maeve Binchy's novel is not a classic, but has some charm and a definite sense of a particular time and place (small Irish village in the 50s) and a nicely drawn protagonist. It's a shame that this film completely butchers the theme of the book in order to pander to what the filmmakers must assume are American simpletons who have to have a happy romantic ending.

 SPOILER ALERT

 Well, just barely but you should know before seeing this that in the novel, Benny Hogan and Jack Foley BREAK UP at the end and do not get back together nor do they ever have sex. This is a far more realistic and satisfying ending, as Benny realizes that Jack is shallow and unworthy of her love and that she is now a mature, self-actualized adult who can move on. The movie wallows in a very unbelievable scenario where ""all is forgiven"", because of course the sweet heroine MUST get the handsome hunk. Thus the entire point of the book is utterly lost.

 Along with that, so is virtually half the contents of the novel, including the story of Eve and the various colorful residents of Knockglen. This is a rather huge problem, since the book is about a ""Circle of Friends"" and if you make the story entirely about ONE of the friends, then that concept is rendered meaningless. Basically, what remains is the story of one nice girl (Benny) and one bitchy girl (Nan, played by the lovely Saffron Burrows).

 That being said, Minnie Driver is adorable and brimming with charm as Benny, although Benny is supposed to be overweight and plain and Ms. Driver is merely ""very attractive in a down-to-earth way"". She commands the screen entirely with her appealing and realistic performance. Too bad the costume designers and hair stylists couldn't have found some 50s clothing and hairstyles for her -- no girl in the 50s would have been caught dead with ""big hair"".

 On the other hand, Chris O'Donnell feels awkward as miscast as Jack. He looks too young for Benny (of course, all the cast is pretty much too old to be playing 18 yr old college freshman), and he doesn't convey the shallow side of Jack's character...of course, that could be the director or screenwriter forcing it to the back, since in the film Jack is Benny's true love and they end up together!

 Look for Alan Cummings, Colin Firth (as well as the aforementioned Saffron Burrows) in supporting roles...all these fine actors have gone on to do much substantial work in the last decade. But this is really Minnie Driver's show -- she made her Hollywood career with this delightful portrayal and it's worth sitting through the muddled script to enjoy two hours with her. I think this remains her finest film role. The two stars are entirely for her; otherwise this film would rate a big zero.",1090886400,9,2738,4.634297520661157

this is a pretty straightforward and simplistic film.  and my only complaint is that the film doesn't flesh out some things that i really would have liked fleshed out, and it had some loose strings left hanging in the end.  for example, i loved eve and aidan as a couple, yet the film gave them pretty flat portrayals.  on the one hand, you're left wanting to see more, but on the other hand, there is the possibility that the film could spread itself too thin in terms of plot.
the movie was well cast.  minnie driver is phenomenal.  chris o'donnell doesn't get much credit.  and my other favorite was the one who played eve.  she really had spark!  and alan cummings as the irrepressible sean walsh just makes me want to barf!

Minni Driver plays Benny, an innocent Catholic school girl in this romantic film. She has been persued by her father's slimy partner at the shop. Her character embodies the typical insecurities that most girls have about themselves - not being the most beautiful, not being most popular, not having freedom from their parents and the church. She is a person who pretty much everyone can relate to. As with Christopher O'Donnell's character, Jack, who is a well-off son of a doctor who is unsure of his future. Benny grew up with her best friends Eve and Nan. Nan moved away to Dublin while the girls were young. All three ended up attending the same college, where Nan introduced Jack to Benny. Jack and Benny began spending time together and instantly bonded. This relationship turned into love and the two were inseperable. The story is amazing and the movie envelops you. I was crying hysterically and smiling hysterically. It has a great balance of happiness and sadness and the viewer becomes a part of it all. Watch/buy it today!!",1058486400,,1185,4.6746411483253585

They took some of the best pieces of the novel and made it into an enchanting film that made me want to read the novel all over again. I would have loved to see more included in the film, but in order to do that it would have been a five hour movie.
Minnie Driver portrays Benny in such a wonderful way that I fell in love with the character all over again. And Chris O'Donnell is excellent. There were so many wonderful actors in this film, along with the wonderful irish background music & scenery.

The cast are brilliant. Chris O'Donnell shines as the golden child and romantic lead, but I must say the movie belongs to Minnie Driver. What a discovery ! She handles the role perfectly with just the right amounts of innocence, humour, compassion and bravado to deliver an astounding performance.
The DVD has quite a few extra's which is nice. Plenty of trailers and teasers, I would however, have liked to have seen a little more behind the scenes....this gang surely got on as well off screen as on, I mean, could they really act that well ?

Driver's character, Benny, sees herself as unattractive and dumpy. She plays the role to perfection, with a touching sensitivity. O'Donnell plays Jack, a star rugby player with a big heart and a conscience, but a young man who is somewhat indecisive and not as confident as he appears to be.
The characters are all portrayed with great honesty, humor, and grace while they learn lessons about friendship, loyalty, love, and life.
Although sweet and endearing, this movie is never sappy and the characters never ask us to feel sorry for them.

666550,3,6303501281,"...I wish I had, when I read through the other reviews and saw how many readers had been disappointed that a favorite book had been altered beyond their recognition. This may explain why parts of ""Circle of Friends"" didn't work for me.
Bennie (Minnie Driver) is a somewhat overweight, self-concious girl who goes off to University of Dublin in the company of two of her best friends. There, she encounters what we in the States would call a dreamboat, Jack (Chris O'Donnell). No way they could ever be anything but ""just friends"", right? Well, maybe not. Time to feel a little like two Joan Fontaine heroines, Jane Eyre and the Second Mrs. de Winter, when that good-looking guy may well be yours after all. While all this is taking place rather slowly, another of the friends, Nan, is in the fast lane with her rich Protestant boyfriend, played by Colin Firth. She's decided to act what she believes is sophisticated, with drastic results, ultimately tragically involving the other couple, Bennie and Jack.
Evidently, one of the major characters from the book, Eve, got short shrift here in the movie. I for one couldn't understand why this apparently minor character popped up like a deus ex machina at the end, and was able to clear up the difficulty at hand. I guess that's because she's really supposed to have been on hand all through the story.
I did manage to enjoy ""Circle of Friends"", as a non-reader of the original book, though I would have to agree with some others that it was entirely because Minnie Driver was so engaging in the lead female role. It was the first time I ever saw her, and she made quite an impression on me. Were she not the star, this would have been somewhat forgettable.",1023235200,4,1705,4.6490066225165565
666640,3,6303501281,"Maeve Binchy may not be a modern day Shakespeare, but her books are engaging for their depiction of relationships of all sorts. Where the novel ""Circle of Friends"" was a charming, if somewhat slow, exploration of friendship and love, this film is a one-joke, tiresome bore, with theme and plot reduced to whether the main characters will lose their religious convictions enough to have sex.
Some of the glaring changes from novel to film are completely puzzling. Where, in the book, Eve's bitterness towards the Westward family (her own grandparents and uncle) is highly understandable, the film leaves one wondering why she would so resent people generous enough to pay her way through school entirely because her father was once their employee. Sean Walsh, who originally was shady and avaricious, is now a highly strange man who attempts to rape Benny - and, where Benny's innocent parents could easily be deceived by a swindler, their encouraging a daughter to become involved with one so obviously a problem seems sinister. Those who, in reading the book, enjoyed the thought of Benny's being elegantly clad in a brocade original will find her breasts popping out of an ill-fitting black dress to be far more pathetic than humorous.
This film is suitable for an afternoon of no-thought relaxation, but, if the scenery is a feast, it is a famine in the literary department.",997833600,4,1377,4.991304347826087

Chris O'Donnell.  Two hidden treats in the movie are Alan Cumming as the creepy Sean Walsh and Colin Firth as Simon Westward.

The film can be a bit predictable,with familiar conflicts between Benny and her parents arising,and there's also an incongruously harsh sub-plot centered on a friend of Benny's played by Saffron Burrows,who gets pregnant,causing rather dire complications to ensue. It's better to focus on Minnie Driver,who simply sparkles in the lead role,although it always confuses me when a role calls for someone to be thought of as not particularly attractive,and then they hire an actress as drop-dead as Driver.

Driver stars as Bernadette ""Benny""  Hogan, a sensitive, somewhat self-conscious young lady (she sees herself as  plain and over-weight), about to enter the University of Dublin, along with  her two, life-long friends, Eve (Geraldine O'Rawe), and Nan (Saffron  Burrows).  At school she meets rugby star and med student Jack Foley (Chris  O'Donnell), and falls in love with him; and, once he gets to know her, (and  after a somewhat tenuous beginning), Jack realizes that he loves Benny, as  well.  Conflict intervenes upon their romance, however, and complications  ensue when circumstances force them into a prolonged separation.  Benny's  home is a bus ride away from Dublin, and it becomes necessary for her to  stay for awhile and help with the family store.  Ultimately, it leads to an  incident involving Jack and Nan, when Jack becomes unwittingly drawn into a  particularly sensitive and unpleasant situation which has recently arisen  between Nan and her wealthy suitor, Simon Westward (Colin Firth).  Driver is the real story here, though, as she gives an incredibly touching  performance that so adeptly conveys Benny's sensitivities; she is Benny  from the inside out, wearing her heart on her sleeve and so vulnerable to  the pain that life can seemingly inflict at will.  She is so winsome, and  accessible, that it enables you to share her joy and feel her pain; all due  to Driver's incredible ability to make such an absolute emotional  connection between her Benny and the audience.  And having the capacity to  evoke such empathy underscores what a truly gifted actress Driver is.  As  Jack, Chris O'Donnell gives one of his finest performances to date, as  well.  He manages to delve beneath the surface to tap Jack's  indecisiveness, his self-confidence tinged with doubt, while fleshing out  the moral aptitude which defines him,  and it's reassuring to know that  there's so much more to him than being the star jock of the rugby team,  because Benny deserves more than that.  The audience's identification with  Benny is so strong that her endeavors must be rewarded with a man worthy of  her affection; for Jack to be any less than he is would be unacceptable and  unsatisfying.
