8082738,5,B000B6TUN6,"The 7 Tom and Jerry episodes on this DVD have nothing to do with the Tom and Jerry cartoons produced later by MGM (1940-1958), as the characters are human, and have a slight resemblance to Mutt and Jeff, as one is short and rotund, and the other tall and skinny. The cartoons are very simply drawn, highly imaginative, and are absolutely charming. They are in b&w and ""silent,"" with the songs and voices synchronized by Gene Rodemich, using the RCA Photophone System, for Van Beuren Productions. The final 2 episodes are of Gabby, the cartoon character we love to hate. Gabby is a nosey busy-body, who in his desire to ""help,"" creates chaos. Gabby was produced by the Fleischer Studios, directed by Dave Fleischer, with music by Sammy Timberg, and are in color. Total running time is 65 minutes, and all the episodes have been restored quite well, considering their age. Episode list:

1: ""Swiss Trick,"" 1931, directed by John Foster and George Stallings. Tom and Jerry, on a train trip in the Alps, get stuck on a mountain peak, and that's just the start of their adventures. Lots of yodeling in this one. 5*

2: ""The Rocketeers,"" 1932, directed by Foster and George Rufle. Tom and Jerry invent a moon rocket, and are given a big send-off by the Royal Experimental Society. Unfortunately, the rocket takes a nosedive, and they have a marvelous undersea journey, which includes some terrific looking fish, as well as pretty mermaids. 5*

3: ""In the Bag,"" 1932, directed by Foster and Rufle. The pair go West, and this episode includes a nifty, jazzy cowboy song, some dancing gals that turn out to be guys, and a mean outlaw. 5*

4: ""Pots and Pans,"" 1932, directed by Foster and Rufle. Tom and Jerry own a diner, where all the kitchenware provides entertainment. There's a great soup eating song in this one. 5*

5: ""Tuba Tooter,"" 1932, directed by Foster and Stallings. In a German town setting, there's lots of om pah pah music in this episode, a singing dachshund, and more. A little less imaginative then some of the other episodes. 4*

6: ""The Piano Tuner,"" 1932, directed by Foster and Rufle. This episode has the pair ingeniously dealing with sour notes, an opera diva named Mlle. Pflop, and a young lass that sings Cab Calloway's ""Doin' the New Low Down."" My favorite part is when the mice are in the piano store. 5*

7: ""Pencil Mania,"" 1932, directed by Foster and Stallings. Lots of marvelous music in this one, with ""I'm Looking Over a Four Leaf Clover"" and ""Yes We Have No Bananas"" among the songs. 5*

8: ""All's Well,"" 1941, animated by Dave Tendlar and William Nolan. I'm not a Gabby fan, and find a little of him goes a long way, but this episode is quite good. Gabby tries to put a diaper on a baby, and the baby gets the best of him. 4*

9: ""Fire Cheese,"" 1941, animated by Steve Muffati and Joe Oriolo. Gabby interferes with the Lilliput Fire Dept. and in trying to ""help,"" manages to burn down a house. 3*",1140220800,7,2924,4.575525812619503
