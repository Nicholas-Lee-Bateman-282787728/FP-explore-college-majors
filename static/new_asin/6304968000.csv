7879917,5,6304968000,"Datu Kelly Worden presents in this tape perhaps the most comprehensive knife fighting course ever assembled, and he does it in just about an hour and a half.  Instruction is clear and principles are clearly explained and technically accurate.  Interspersed are dramatizations of exactly the type of situations where ""practical knife fighting for self defense"" would be most applicable.  This is a quality Paladin video, and yes, there is some profanity used (not gratuitously, however - he is being attacked afterall), and probably not something you want the kids in the room for, but let's think about this folks, do you really want your kids watching a knife fighting video?  Profanity should be the least of your worries if they're watching this stuff.  Back to the review though, as a martial artist of over 20 years I can honestly say that Datu Worden's system works and while anyone can learn these techniques through practice, no martial artist should be without this one in their video library.",1102032000,2,1002,5.0120481927710845
