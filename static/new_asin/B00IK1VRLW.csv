8642804,5,B00IK1VRLW,"Wild On The Beach was released in 1965 ans starred Sherry Jackson. It is the first film appearance of Sonny & Cher, who sing It's Gonna Rain, which is the flip of their first big hit I Got You Babe. Baby boomers will like this the most.",1436140800,2,236,4.042553191489362

8642807,5,B00IK1VRLW,"Here's a black and white relic from the Sixties.  Sonny and Cher perform in their first film appearance.  A must-own for all youth exploitation collectors and Sixties music buffs.  Sandy Nelson, teen drumming hitmaker, also appears.  Might have benefited being released in color but the producers were out to make a quick buck to cash in on the beach party film craze that was big at the time.  Enjoy!",1403395200,3,401,4.753623188405797
8642808,5,B00IK1VRLW,"WILD ON THE BEACH was released in 1965, and the fact that it was in black-and-white made it seem old-fashioned when compared to the candied colors of the earlier BEACH PARTY films.  The story is a standard battle-of-the-sexes comedy, with some fairly good songs thrown in whenever the pace starts to lag.  Of special note is Cindy Malone (the real-life sister of actress Judy Strangis), who gets to sing her one song (""Run Away From Him"") nearly twice!  The record didn't become a hit, even with that big build-up, but it's a nice slice of girl group angst.

The MOD DVD-R is full frame, but the image quality and visual compositions look good.  This release marks the home video debut of the film, and it will be welcomed by collectors of 1960's youth films, as well as Cindy Malone completists.",1395100800,5,796,4.6571428571428575
