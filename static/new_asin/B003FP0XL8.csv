4118567,3,B003FP0XL8,"There's a few good topless scenes and even a full frontal scene or two...  No actual sexual scenes in this movie.  The plot is simple and there is very little dialouge.  There's a few graphic bloody scenes.  If you're into vampires then you'd probably really like this movie.  I bought it for the skin flicks.  There's a few, but it wouldn't be my first choice...",1294099200,3,363,4.507692307692308

8396038,3,B003FP0XL8,There is way too much nudity for a PG13 rating but nice for an art flick at least if you can get past the crazy babel of a strange seer guy it was far too much emo ramblings. Also a supernatural vampire can't be killed by a knife...,1482969600,,232,3.8541666666666665

8396041,3,B003FP0XL8,"I'm surprised this was rated PG.  There's T&A right from the start and throughout the movie.  I also didn't realize I was going to be lectured to by one of the characters as the movie went on.

I was also surprised by the lack of accents from the actors.  And speaking acting, if I were to grade the movie solely on that, it really would get high marks.  This isn't the typical low grade movie often found in Amazon's Prime movies.  These people truly have gone beyond the basics of acting and do it very well indeed.",1470096000,2,517,4.278350515463917

8396043,3,B003FP0XL8,"This could pass for an art film in Australia. The feature opens with three subplots. We see a vampire couple awakening in a sparsely furnished room. There is a family at the dinner table concerned about their aunt and a man who speaks poetically as if he is reading 19th century literature. We later discover he is a cannibal who eats the corpses after the vampires suck their blood. A girl from the family is also a vampire. We also get to see another vampire outside of this group.

The film opens with Chopin, then goes into a sound track provided by ""Spider Goat Canyon"" a light death metal sound with no lyrics. It was good for the slow motion swagger. The theme of this feature should be somewhere in the two soliloquies  that bored me during the film and I suppose they tied into the Nietzsche quotes at the beginning and end. The only thing I could get out of it was life is an abomination, or maybe just vampires, or we are all vampires one way or another, or Chopin music is the meaning of life. Life is not a bowl of Cheerios, but then again neither is Cheerios, Life.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. Full frontal nudity (Alex Spears, Vanessa de Largie) Best film at the Melbourne Underground Film Festival 2007.",1407456000,3,1216,4.468468468468468
8396044,1,B003FP0XL8,"This was a disappointment.  The idea was good but the presentation was horrible.
It was an effort to get through the first 20 minutes.  I had to get up every 10 minutes so I wouldn't fall asleep.  I wouldn't waste my money on this one.",1294272000,2,235,4.177777777777778
