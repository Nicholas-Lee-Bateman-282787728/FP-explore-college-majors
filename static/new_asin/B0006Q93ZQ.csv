2192897,1,B0006Q93ZQ,My son loved pooh's ABC & 123 I thought this would be a nice continuation for him but it was an older disney movie with a couple of breakes in it with a few problems for him.  This was a complete waste of my money.,1112918400,22,214,3.7555555555555555
2192898,5,B0006Q93ZQ,I hope this is the version with Sterling Holloway (Winnie the Pooh voice) narrating.  This is by far the best version.  The one with Professor whatever is a joke.,1106870400,,162,4.551724137931035

2192930,5,B0006Q93ZQ,Excellent cartoon. Very educative and fun. Quality is very good. I like it very much! Very fast shipment and excellent packaging! Many thanks!,1320105600,,142,5.217391304347826
2192931,5,B0006Q93ZQ,My son loves Mickey.  He watches the Clubhouse cartoons everyday.  Now I can slowly introduce some math & reading concepts while on the road.  He stays captive in his carseat and watches this DVD. This is great for a beginer learner.  You are tricking them into learning concepts while having fun.  It's true it's not as good as other learning videos if your child is older and use to those types of videos.  My little one loves it.,1266278400,,432,4.4743589743589745
2192932,5,B0006Q93ZQ,"This cartoon was a classic favorite of mine as a child!  I was so excited to see it was available on DVD.  I want to share it with my kids, and love that it adds a new element of counting etc., rather than being simply entertainment.",1163721600,2,233,4.043478260869565
2192933,5,B0006Q93ZQ,"I just popped the dvd into our player and expected my nephews to stare blankly into the screen and go along their merry way roaming around our house, but to my amazement the singing and the interesting eye catching way of the disney characters teaching how to count sheep and stuff, was like flame to their moth..analogically speaking :)",1142035200,2,337,4.728813559322034
2192934,1,B0006Q93ZQ,"SHUT-UP in an ""Educational"" DVD! -- I want my money back. Really a ""zero"" star rating.  Ditto on the other neg reviews. My son did learn to flip his spoon by pounding it at the dinner table.  I'm sending the DVD back to Disney demanding a refund and suggest other buyers do the same.  And exactly what ""educators"" did Disney work with on this???  Shame on them!!!!  Mr. Walt Disney would be ashamed.",1131321600,13,399,4.410958904109589
2192935,1,B0006Q93ZQ,"Disappointed, I should have read these reviews first! Although this is listed for ages 2+, I was not happy with my toddler watching a bad-tempered crazed duck have tantrums and try to kill a cow with an axe. A little less violence in a learning video please Disney! Best advice stick with companies focused on producing learning-based products, not just trying to make a quick-buck. My son loves the Leap-Frog Letters DVD. It is fun, very educational and non-violent. I should have bought the next movie in that series instead.",1115596800,25,527,4.866666666666666
2192936,1,B0006Q93ZQ,"This is just a dark, cloudy 70's (or earlier) era cartoon.  (I remember seeing it when I was a kid.  I don't believe it had the benefit of being ""screen by screen hand digitally remastered"" either.  It doesn't look very bright.

We bought it we thought it would help our 5 year old with certain math concepts (because she can count but doesn't necessarily know what the numbers represent).  Boy were we wrong.  This is not a ""learning adventure"" or a virtual pre-K as it has been called.  It's just a long cartoon and only three times do you see an educational pop-up.  The first one is counting two cows, three calves and 5 sheep.  The second is asking how many slices of bread (cutting one loaf into how many parts) will you need in order to give Mickey, Donald and Goofy each a piece.  The last is I think how many Mickey's equal the giant.  Not volume, but how many Mickeys stacked on top of each other equal the height of the giant.  The educational content is just too far and few between to justify calling it a learning video.  I was very, very disappointed.",1113436800,39,1066,4.377551020408164
2192937,1,B0006Q93ZQ,"This video is very disappointing.  It's just an old Disney cartoon - Mickey and the Beanstalk, with some ""learning breaks"" inserted.  I bought this because of the Disney brand name, I will be much more careful in the future.",1113436800,16,224,4.717948717948718

8042567,2,B0006Q93ZQ,"Very disappointed in this Mickey Mouse DVD. This is supposed to be a fun learning adventure of ages 2-6 and it scared both my 3 year old and 4.5 year old. Starts out telling a story about a sweet princess in a happy land with a super fun song my kids loved but immediately turns dark and states the happy land can't last.  Black shadows cover what was a happy and colorful village then thunder and lightning flash a scary gargoyle and a big, black creepy shadow-monster breaks the glass window and grabs the sweet princess.  My 4-1/2 year old boy was almost crying.  Same thing happened with the Mickey's Seeing the World Video.  I would steer clear of these and go with a happy learning series like Leap Frog or Umi Zoomi - super fun and no dark creepiness.",1510012800,2,758,4.392857142857143
