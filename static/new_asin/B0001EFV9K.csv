1993302,4,B0001EFV9K,"This set is called seasons 3 and 4 but most of you will not think of it that way. This set does not include the season with Leanna Creel as Tori. That is considered season 5. This set is still going to be good though, as it has the best episodes in it. I expect they will release ""Hawaiian Style"" along with season 5 as a set. Let's keep our fingers crossed!",1078617600,6,358,3.986111111111111
1993303,4,B0001EFV9K,"This shows good an all but there is no special featurres. The other dvd doesnt have any either. But there probably is going to be a special edition dvd for the later seasons. You know the college years. There should be like a behind the scenes or commentary or something,tv spots at least. Or the E true hollywood story of save by the bell.(they really had it)I guess Ill get this when it comes out, but I expect special edition dvd real soon. Cause if they dont(me shaking my fist)This show was always great watching the tv show as a kid. Save by the bell shows how the high school years were in the early 90's. And I know every one loved the theme song. ITs catchy cmon, and so is this show. Once you watch it, you cant stop even though you hate it so much.",1077062400,5,759,4.170068027210885
1993304,5,B0001EFV9K,I purchased the first two seasons of the show and discovered that three shows were omited from the second season. But I still enjoy watching this show on dvd.,1076716800,,158,4.482758620689655
1993305,5,B0001EFV9K,"Firstly, It was great to see a show from this time period released on dvd as complete seasons (I'm still impatiently awaiting ""the cosby show"" and ""roseanne""), but I hope when they release the 3rd and 4th seasons, they include the 2 hour TV Movie ""Saved By The Bell : Hawaiian Style"" which aired in between seasons 3 and 4. I'm worried that they won't because the first DVD set included 5 discs, and the next will only include 4. This doesn't make any sense because seasons 1 & 2 had 34 episodes in total, and seasons 3 & 4 had 52 episodes in total, and that's NOT including the TV movie. So are we to expect no TV Movie and crappier video/audio compression to squeeze it on to 4 discs? I hope they at least include a booklet this time. With the first set, I thought I had bought a set that someone had returned without the booklet and was repackaged and restocked.",1076716800,,865,4.280487804878049

1993307,5,B0001EFV9K,"I'm so excited that Seasons 3 and 4 of Saved By The Bell are soon coming out on DVD!  I grew up watching these guys!
The greatest episode in the series' history is from Season 4 - ""The Fight.""  In ""The Fight,"" Zack and Slater compete for the heart of a new girl in school.  Things get pretty competitive and Zack and Slater come to blows during a school dance at The Max.  When Mr. Belding tried to break up the fight, they accidently knocked off a toupee he was wearing and it landed in a punch bowl!  I never get sick of watching that episode- it is by far my favorite one.
Another famous episode on this DVD set is ""Pipe Dreams,"" where oil was discovered under the school and everyone dreams of riches.  However, after an oil spill in which Screech gets doused with crude oil, Zack and the gang have a change of heart and convince the school board not to drill the oil out.  It's a cheesy, but memorable episode.
This DVD set is a steal at just $30!",1076025600,2,952,4.169398907103825

1993349,5,B0001EFV9K,"...is contained on these DVD's, which is the only reason I bought them.

Appropriately released in Season 3 as Episodes 24 and 25 (suggestive of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day), ""Home For Christmas, Parts 1 and 2"" originally aired December 7 and 14, 1991, and put a twist on the Home for Christmas theme:  Frank Benton and his daughter, Laura, have recently become homeless, through no fault of their own, so they are in need of a ""Home for Christmas.""

Laura lands a job at a Mr. Moody's retail store, in the mall where regular Saved by the Bell characters are working, including A.C. (played by Mario Lopez), who struggles to please in the gift wrapping department.  Jessie (played by Elizabeth Berkley) struggles with onery brats as Santa's Helper.  (Santa Claus plays ""himself.""  Zack (played by Mark-Paul Gosselaar) plays Santa, too.)  Kelly (played by Tiffani-Amber Thiessen) also works at Mr. Moody's retail store, and befriends Laura.

Zack bumps into Laura (played by Jennifer McComb) at the mall, and starts flirting with her immediately.  They start dating, and he eventually wins her heart.

Coincidentally, Zack and his friends are putting on a theatrical version of Charles Dickens' classic, A Christmas Carol, in the mall, so he, of course, wants Laura to participate.  Unfortunately, Mr. Moody, a modern Scrooge, refuses to give Laura the time off, and he also refuses to give her an advance on her wages so she can purchase a much-needed coat.

To make matters worse, Laura's father (played by Stephen Mendel) passes out at the mall due to starvation.  Luckily, Zack and A.C. rescue him, and he is hospitalized.  (ObamaCare wasn't in effect yet, and the benefits of Reaganomics were still ""kicking"" during George H.W. Bush's Presidency, before the dope-smoking, draft-dodging sex offender, Bill Clinton, had a chance to destroy the U.S. housing market and economy, so even homeless people could get medical care.)

Will Laura get to see, let alone perform in her new boy friend's Christmas Carol?  Or will she be forced to work for mean, old Mr. Moody during the play?

Will Laura get her coat?  Or will mean, old Mr. Moody have her put in jail for stealing it?

Will Laura become an orphan?  Or will she and her father find a ""Home for Christmas""?

Stay tuned!  Rather, buy the DVD's and see for yourself, in one of the most hilarious versions of A Christmas Carol I've ever seen!

It was also amusing to see the size of Zack's cell phone, hehehe...",1391904000,,2468,4.851674641148326

1993380,4,B0001EFV9K,"After reviewing Saved by the Bell back in August, I couldn't get the silly theme song out of my head. I used a $15.00 coupon code given to me by Mommy Bear Media (where you can find family-friendly movies and television series) along with my own money to buy Saved by the Bell Seasons Three & Four. I also bought the Saved by the Bell: Double Feature Two Movies set that features the two made-for-television movies, Hawaiian Style and Wedding in Las Vegas.

I was hooked on Saved by the Bell when I was a kid, but I think every kid in the early 90s watching it. The first & second DVD set went by the syndication order and not the original airdate. The episode order in the season 3 & 4 is worse than the previous. Yes, Lionsgate once again went by the syndication order, but there are a few two part episodes that have another episode in between them. The episodes at the summer resort are randomly mixed in with the Bayside High episodes for discs 1-3. The continuity error doesn't bother me too much, but it could become a problem for any new fan of the series.

The series actually aired for four seasons, but the production filmed five different batches, aka five seasons.

The episodes are:

Disc One - The Famous Belding Boys; Breaking Up is Hard to Do; The Glee Club; The Last Dance; Zack's Birthday Party; The Aftermath

Disc Two - The Game; Operation Zack; Fourth of July; Wicked Stepbrother part 1; Wicked Stepbrother part 2; Check Your Mate

Disc Three - My Boyfriend's Back; Fake IDs; Boss Lady; Pipe Dreams; The Last Weekend; Date Auction; All in the Mall

Disc Four - S.A.T.'s; Palm Springs Weekend Part 1; Hold Me Tight; Palm Springs Weekend Part 2; No Hope With Dope; Rockumentary; Cut Day; Home for Christmas Part 1; Home for Christmas Part 2; Mystery Weekend

Major highlights during the season are the breakup of Zack and Kelly, the breakup of Slater and Jesse, the six summer episodes at the resort, and the two-part Palm Springs episodes. The plots are better in seasons 3 & 4, though Screech becomes less of a nerd and more of a goofball sidekick. My favorite is the two-part Christmas episode that use to air on TBS every holiday season up until a few years ago. Despite the order errors, I enjoyed watching the DVD set.",1347840000,3,2244,4.496314496314496

i have a few complaints about this dvd set though, although it comes it alot of episodes (30 to be exact) there appears to be many episodes missing and they are very much out of airdate order!
the summer episodes dominate this boxset! and they aren't in order so it hard to keep up with the storylines

apart from that its a great dvd to own if your a fan and fun to watch as a reminder of years past!

the dvd also comes with selected episodes featuring commentary by the ""cast and crew"", the cast members who appear on the commentary are mr belding, lisa turtle and screech! it would have been nice to hear the opinions of all cast members but you do get alot of insight in to backstage of the show as well as very awkward moments usually from ""screech"" aka dustin diamond! on the commentary for ""no hope for dope"" dustin makes alligations that the cast did drugs at the time and its very awkard! dustin seems to resent his character screech throughout the commentaries and basically just makes fun of the show the entire way through!

They are all totally great but this second volume in the series is my favourite. It's where the characters are starting to become more developed and more ambitious issues start to be tackled, albeit in a rather comedic way! There are lots of incosistencies from episode to episode but this show doesn't take itself too seriously so it hardly matters. The characters are all really likeable even though the late 80s/early 90s fashions and hilariously bad acting are sometimes cringeworthy!

1993402,4,B0001EFV9K,"Having seen the first two seasons, i was desperate to see what followed. This is an adictive show at the very least. Everynight i was ""Just one episode, then sleep. Tomorrow i have to work!""... and then i watched 6 episodes in a row. You just kept wanting more.

I'm happy to say the show didn't go down after two seasons. Tt was the same amazingly funny show that you fell in love with (so many years ago). The order of the episodes was still a problem, specially with the story arc on the beach... but it was not going to prevent me from watching, neither i was going to spend my time trying to find what the correct order was! I just watched and watched!

The Third and fourth seasons keep the same structure of the last two, the same quality and fun you found before. The same errors and even a similar package, so if you liked the first set, you will love this.

One Thing we didn't have before where extras! We have some comentaries from some of the cast. We don't have Mark-Paul, Tiffany or Elizabeth so don't be too happy, but we do have some insight about what happened then, and that's always a good thing.

Anyway. I love this show, and will continue to watch it until i remember every single line. It was a pretty big part of my life 15 years ago, and i'm truly happy it's somethig right now.",1173312000,,1304,4.245967741935484

1993405,5,B0001EFV9K,"I, like a lot of others, grew up on Saved by the Bell. It defined my Saturday mornings: this, along with The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

I bought this season first because it had more of my favorite episodes on it.

This show isn't just a sitcom. It is a cult classic. They were able to make the show appealing for both young kids and adults.

As I watch Saved by the Bell as an adult, I pick up on some disturbing things that eluded me before: one, the gang is really mean to the nerds (""school intellectuals""), or anyone who doesn't fit their ""cool"" status. It reminds me of real-life school cliques and elitists who ostracize the unpopular kids. These kids grow up to become mass murderers much of the time. Better watch out! You might be on somebody's ""list."" The Saved by the Bell clique were basically good people, but boy did they have their moments of cruelty and deviousness.

One other complaint I have is with the breakdown of the episodes. This is more of NBC's fault than it is Lions Gate. Even though the gang was in high school for four years, which is the normal number, NBC didn't have the seasons break down into a clear cut four seasons. This is why there is a confusing FIVE seasons.

My Top Five Favorite Episodes From The Collection

1. Last Dance (where Zack and Kelly breakup)

2. All in the Mall (U2 tickets)

3. Date Auction (Zack tries to avoid overweight date)

4. Cut Day (Zack outwitting Mr. Belding by leaving school)

5. Wicked Stepbrother 1&2 (Jessie's stepbrother wreaks havoc)",1159401600,4,1514,4.512820512820513

The DVD was full of fun jokes and nerds, jocks, sports, education, and overall great comedy. Zack Morris was the star of the bunch, giving his perspective on everything that adolescents deal with. Teenagers and pre-teenagers should watch these DVDs in the year 2050 to see how things have changed sixty years later. I won't spoil the plots for you--just watch the episodes and enjoy.

The show ran from 89-93 ( 89-90 season 1 90-91 season 2 91-92 season 3 and 92-93 season 4) it further doesn't make sense for them to call the missing episodes season five because frankly there wasn't a season 5 93-94 started saved by the bell the college years and saved by the bell the new class. They should call ""season 5"" what it is ""lost episodes that we lied on the other box sets and told you they were complete"" Lions Gate has done that on other shows too",1114473600,,747,4.158620689655172

1993421,5,B0001EFV9K,"In regards to the person who was really dissapointed... here is the actual scoop:

  According to what NBC provided Lions Gate Entertainment, Seasons 3 and 4 are complete.  What you might be wanting is Season 5. SBTB had 5 seasons.  The order in which they are putting them on the DVD's is by air date.  SBTB has been in syndication since it first began, so there are many different online episode guides to confuse you.  The best episode guide to follow, that can give you an idea of how Lions Gate is putting them in order can be seen at this website, [...]  (But ignore the way they have divided the seasons)  I am sure they will be releasing the final season 5 on DVD next. (Which is senior year with ""Tori"" episodes and the final ""Jessie/Kelly"" episodes with the graduation, etc.)

Season 5 is expected for a June 2005 release.

Well how come ""Video Yearbook"" and ""Snow White and the Seven Dorks"" are missing, as well?  Aren't they considered Season 3 and 4? Again, this goes back to the fact that Lions Gate is putting them in air date order.  These 2 episodes didn't air until Season 5, along with the ""Tori"" episodes, according to the air date episode guide I provided you above.",1103932800,23,1187,4.465116279069767

 My life was just pathetic enough when i was younger where I paid way too much attention to this show. I feel cheated, because I wouldn't have wanted it if they had listed the episodes on the back. I clearly would have noticed that seasons 3 and 4 were about 20 episodes too short. Nice work NBC entertainment and Lions Gate Home video...I get to shell out another $40 when you decide to release the remaining eps.

And in response to the one who wants to know who Tori is: When Tiffani Theissen and Elizabeth Berkley left in the middle of the fourth or fifth season (unexplained reasons), Leanna Creel was asked to play Tori, Zack's new wild interest. In my mind, she was one of the 'last chance people' for the show.
NBC now owes us fans: The 5th Season, Zack and Kelly's wedding movie, Showgirls (just kidding!) and Saved by the Bell: the College Years
Disney owes us: Good Morning, Miss Bliss",1084060800,,796,4.348993288590604
1993433,4,B0001EFV9K,"After being very disappointed with the 1st and 2nd season's DVD boxed sets, I purchased season 3 and 4 for mostly archival purposes.  I am in a constant state of paranoid fear that someday TBS will stop showing Saved By the Bell in syndication, so the fact that these boxed sets are available at all is reason enough for me to buy them.
The absence of special features, coupled with the shoddy packaging of the first boxed set made me very angry, despite the relatively low price of the set for two seasons.  I, as had many other fans, vented my rage on Amazon.com...and Lion's Gate or NBC Entertainment (or what have you) listened!!  And good for them.
However, there is still quite a bit of room for improvement.  The packaging still leaves much to be desired.  Although the cardboard is more substantial, it is still a funky fold-out without an outer box.  I commend them on their decision to put any stickers on the outside of the shrink wrap so that upon removal, the cardboard does not rip.  Cool beans.
The back cover boasts commentary from cast members and this is somewhat misleading.  Commentary is found on only a few episodes by some combination of the following: Peter Engel (producer), Dennis Haskins (Mr. Belding), Lark Voorhies (Lisa Turtle), and Dustin Diamond (if you don't know, I'm not going to tell you).  The commentaries that exclusively feature by Peter Engel are unlistenable.  He sounds like a retarded old man reading a prepared statement.  Those commentaries that feature the actors, however, are well worth the price of admission.  On one episode, Dustin Diamond does the commentary solo and the result is pure brilliance.  His attitude toward being a formerchildstar is as healthy as I've ever seen-such an attitude translates well to episode commentary.  He's loose, he's witty, he's Sceech.
Always frustrating, of course, is the order of the episodes.  I'm still very confused about what happened when and who the hell Tori is.  The ""Malibu Sands"" episodes are all out of order, spliced by other episodes that take place at the school-so confusing.
And let me let you in on a funny little secret (I have to give my husband full credit for spotting this).  In one of the pictures of the cast on the box, there is a picture with all the kids and Mr. Belding.  That picture is actually from the ""No Hope With Dope"" episode, which featured then-NBC president Brandon Tartikoff.  Mr. Belding's head was photo-shopped on to Brandon Tartikoff's body.  It's really corny.
Overall, it was a good second try.  Hopefully, the third time will be the charm.  I really look forward to getting explanations for certain issues that have plagued me and so many others of my generation since seventh grade.  In the first Tori episode, why does Slater dance with a tree?  Is there any transition whatsoever between the Jessie/Kelly and the Tori episodes that I somehow missed?  WHO IS TORI???",1083801600,3,2905,4.808467741935484
1993434,4,B0001EFV9K,This doesn't have all the episodes in Season 4.  In fact there are 7 episodes or more that are not on this set.  I think they should've put in all the episodes.  They should rerelease this with all the episodes.,1083801600,,211,4.225
1993435,5,B0001EFV9K,"*  The Saved by the Bell DVD sets are not 'missing episodes' as previous reviewers have claimed.  The episodes sited are not in this set, but there is a reason for this.
*  The sets are being released in full seasons BASED ON NBC's PRODUCTION NUMBERING SYSTEM.  The episodes are presented not in chronological order, but in the order NBC had numbered them.
I hope this clears up any confusion.  There have always been questions about how the Saved by the Bell seasons actually are broken down, because of the show's airing Saturday mornings instead of in a normal prime time schedule, and because of the ""Malibu Sands"" and ""Tori Episodes"" season divisions.
*  There are, in fact, FIVE seasons of Saved by the Bell according to NBC records, and the seasons do not break down evenly with the years the gang is in high school.  For example, there are episodes that take place in the 10th grade, or second year of high school, that were not actually aired until the THIRD season of the show.  Because of this, NBC has numbered these episodes as being part of the third season.  They were not 'missing' from the first DVD set, but rather considered under this system to be included in the DVD set for Seasons Three and Four.  The decision to release the episodes according to this system also accounts for the 'jumping around' in continuity.
*  Just know that Lion's Gate has been good enough to bring us Saved by the Bell on DVD.  And the improved packaging and commentary overshadow the inconveinience of having the episodes presented 'out of order' in terms of chronology.  And wait for a Season Five release before you get upset over 'missing episodes'",1083628800,43,1651,4.651724137931034

Why are they showing two different series at the one time and mixing the episodes up? That is very annoying. I really do hope they bring out the remander of the episodes that are missing.

The belding boys, Breaking up is hard to undo and the glee club. the video, and snow white episodes still don't appear even though they are from season 2 which is 10th grade.  Basically the dvd is Season 3 which can be considered 11th grade in its entirety.  And the extra season in there is the malibu sand episodes..

1993444,5,B0001EFV9K,it's about time. i was wondering just the other day as i was looking at my season 1&2 DVD's if they were even going to release any more seasons on DVD or if someone had forgotten about the market behind sbtb. now after they produce season 5 (&6 if there was one) someone needs to get crackin' on some DVD's for California Dreams... the only show in the world that made a fitting replacement upon sbtb being snatched off the air in 93 and being replaced with a pale facsimile (the college years) and other poor attempts to keep it going using other actors... unwise! but i'm happy to have the good ol' memories back so clear and not have to tape the show off cable anymore and run it into premiere and possibly even after effects and then have to burn them to DVD-R... sure you get your own effects but it's too expensive.,1082160000,,821,4.303225806451613
1993445,4,B0001EFV9K,"Keep in mind I liked this DVD and the show when you read this... I am just telling it like it is!
One of most cheaply produced shows of all time.  Whenever there was a crowd scene there would be a grand total of about 20 students.  Clothes are horrific.  Most of the teachers and administrators in this school seem slightly retarded as they are easily fooled week after week by the popular ""Saved by the Bell"" crowd.
Jessie's addition (to caffeine pills) speech the absolutely unintentionally funniest thing I have ever seen.
Serious problems are wrapped up in 20 minutes
The studio audience yells and howls as if they were at the ""Rocky Horror Picture Show""
I honestly think Elizabeth Berkley poor acting has to been seen to be enjoyed.
This is worth buying!",1080345600,4,759,4.607407407407408
1993446,5,B0001EFV9K,"Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!. I am such a big fan of this show. I grew up watching ''Saved by the Bell'' when I was in primary school in the early 90's, and I must admit once the show finished and I started high school there had been a long absence before I got reunited with this amazing series again. Thankfully through having cable I got reunited with it and taped every episode to make sure I'd never have to part from it again. And then the most wonderful thing happen about 6 or lest months later...series 1 and 2 came on DVD. Once watching this series and owing the first two series on DVD brought a flood of memories back of saturday morning eagerly awaiting for ''Saved by the Bell'' to start and watching it. I'm sooooooo happy and proud to own this delightful, intelligent, fun show. And I desperatly can't wait for season 3 and 4, and if it's true that it will have commentaries by the cast I'm going to be doing hand stands! I love the whole cast. Elizabeth Berkley as Jesse has always been my favourite. And I especially can't wait for the episodes of when Jesse and Slater finally get together. I will forever adore this series and actor/characters in it.

8011090,5,B0001EFV9K,The episodes are NOT in order you could order the sets one by one but they are region 2 dvds which means the discs won't play on standard US dvd players you will need a multi region dvd player in order to play them. I had to order both the sets again this time individually plus a multi region dvd player. I really want this set so bad.,1490486400,,336,3.9558823529411766

I was sorely disappointed that it is missing the graduation episode...you know the one where the guys dance in the ballet?  Also, each episode is greatly out of order and it came with no episode guide insert.  You have to put in each disc and see the menu to know what episodes are on the disc.  No rhyme or reason to it.",1423353600,,499,4.15625
