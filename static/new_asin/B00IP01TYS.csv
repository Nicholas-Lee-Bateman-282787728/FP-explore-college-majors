6284637,5,B00IP01TYS,"Bob Sinclare (videographer) was a friend
I've been waiting for this series for years
too bad it was not released until he passed away.",1455321600,2,134,4.625
6284638,4,B00IP01TYS,"This series is about two parachutists who accept jobs that lead to action and adventure. Think ""Whirlybirds"" but without the helicopters and you get the idea. It stars Larry Pennell and Ken Curtis who would go on to play Festus in the long running western series ""Gunsmoke"". Larry Pennell would go on to have a semi regular role in ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" as Ellie May's boyfriend Dash Riprock.
There are no major guest stars on the series apart from Burt Reynolds. The rest are all character actors who have guested on other TV series.
The first season is in black and white and to my surprise the second season is in color.
Be warned that on the second season episode called ""The Hunter"" there is no sound. The picture is great but no sound. I believe that this will not be rectified. So unless you can read lips you've had it. Apart from that I enjoyed the whole series and was glad I purchased the DVDs.",1453939200,5,909,4.481927710843373
6284639,5,B00IP01TYS,"I didn't want to ruin it's straight 5 star rating so I'm also giving five despite the fact that Season 2, Disc 2 Episode ""The Hunter"" has no audio.  Amazon replaced the complete set and the replacement has the same problem.  The ""missing episode"" issue reported in other reviews however seems to have been corrected.  Hopefully the audio issue on ""The Hunter"" will also soon be corrected preferably before they send my new replacement otherwise they will just have to keep sending replacements until it is fixed.

Overall both the audio and video quality of the complete series is very good for such an old show.  I think it's about as good as could ever be expected and it was better than I expected when I ordered it.  Season 2 is now in color which is nice, seeing bright red and white parachutes instead of black and white.

This is the show that got me into the skydiving so I am very happy that it is finally on DVD.  I think I'm not alone in this, probably lots of fellow skydivers out there that was inspired by Ripcord.  It's a definite must have for your collection!

Update 1/4/16:  They are not sending a replacement, they are sending a refund.  They don't know when or if the problem will be fixed.  Don't let this discourage you from getting it however, it's just the one episode that has no audio.

Update:  If you buy season 2 here  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CMQIE26/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  it has audio on ""The Hunter"".",1451865600,4,1468,4.761904761904762
