8395267,5,B000T9D63A,"I was pleasantly surprised this morning with the little over 1/2 hour Power Paced Fitness Circle workout because I could actually DO it all and that it worked my body just enough with stretches that were fairly innovative (for a fitness circle) while challenging my core, arms, obliques, glutes, hamstrings, etc.  I felt Moira really USED the fitness circle for what it offers (lots of compression squeezes, arms and legs) instead of using it as just a prop to exercises I already know.  You know what I mean?  It is an intermediate workout that won't stress you with a lot stuff you can't do, it flows well, and I like that it gives your arms (particularly triceps) a good run for the $$.  This DVD is good for a day you don't want to knock yourself out, but still get a good workout.",1356048000,3,785,4.468531468531468
