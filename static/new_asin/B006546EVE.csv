8493274,5,B006546EVE,I was so in a love with the show as I remember it aired same night in 95 as I was in Malibu at the time and E.R and Chicago hope was being discussed everywhere in town. I watch e.r for 15 minutes and thought I would switch to Chicago hope. I never went back. And then I find it and it's not for America? What! But I can still get book's. I still have not been dissatisfied yet. I am going to be brave and order a pyrex baking dish for my granny smith apple pie,1499299200,,460,3.752577319587629
8493275,5,B006546EVE,"I loved every season of this show and more than once have seen every episode. I have 5 seasons of ER on dvd, Why is it so difficult to produce this entire series for region 1? Let's get with the program and get it done.",1493856000,2,219,3.888888888888889

why are we being ignored",1456012800,9,64,4.0
8493277,5,B006546EVE,"Love this show! And I can't figure out why this hasn't been made available on DVD for the US market... a must for Mandy Patinkin fans such as myself, but all around a very entertaining, good show -- as expected, even by a very early David Kelly!",1453680000,7,245,4.23404255319149
8493278,3,B006546EVE,"Specifically purchased a region free DVD player to watch this. While the show is wonderful, the picture is very poor. Supposedly purchased new DVD set. Maybe I just received a bad package. I hope this will be released in the USA soon. It's a wonderful series!",1451520000,5,259,4.6521739130434785
8493279,1,B006546EVE,Why sell to a country you know cannot play it?,1449792000,10,46,3.7
8493280,5,B006546EVE,"Enough already. Chicago Hope was superior to ER in every way.  ER has been available on DVD Region 1 format for years. I can even buy every season of ER at Hastings for $12, which is a great deal and better than on Amazon. But I want Chicago Hope, and want it released on DVD Region 1. It is available for Region 2. Why not Region 1? Come on America, and whichever company is willing to release this awesome series for US DVD players.  Loyal fans of the show are tired of waiting.",1443830400,29,480,4.150537634408602
