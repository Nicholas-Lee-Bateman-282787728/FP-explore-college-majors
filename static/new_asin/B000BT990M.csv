2440065,5,B000BT990M,"I love it when reviewers automatically trash a work based upon bias towards an idea,author or belief system.

The shroud presents the mystery surrounding this enigmatic cloth. It does not proclaim without any shadow of doubt that this cloth did indeed cover Christ's body during his resurrection. It does however present evidence that it could very well have been. It presents the mystery surrounding the death and resurrection of Christ.

One need not be a Catholic or even a believing Christian to appreciate this film. Much like a CSI tries to unearth what truths may be present in observable evidence  to paint a picture of what may have happened, this piece goes through historical data and modern forensic research to try to unlock the origin of the cloth and the images on it. It invites the viewer to question ""what if?"" Never asserting ultimate truth,leaving more questions about the resurrection and the shroud than answers.

I hope many more people, regardless of faith, give this film an honest, unbiased viewing, if not for any other reason than to try to understand the mystery surrounding the death and resurrection of a man who so many people have died for and continue to dedicate their lives for today.",1363478400,21,1220,4.907766990291262
2440066,1,B000BT990M,Waste of film. When are we going to accept the hoax? Pseudo science does not prove pseudo knowledge. Avoid for sanity.,1361577600,,118,4.666666666666667
2440067,3,B000BT990M,This DVD was a disappointment to me. I had heard a CD talk on the Shroud that answered many of my questions with what are claimed to be facts. Few of the topics covered on the CD were even mentioned on the DVD.,1241740800,,210,3.9069767441860463
8092010,1,B000BT990M,"Not much about the actual shroud here.  More like a poor travelog than a documentary.  Can't help wondering why the constant footage showing muslims was deemed necessary in a documentary about the Shroud.  There was nothing new introduced by this film, no new knowledge, evidence, or even opinion.  A dull, soporific, un entertaining, bore.  This presentation is a complete waste of time which I'll never get back.",1477612800,,414,5.119402985074627

8092013,3,B000BT990M,"This documentary was a little too theatrical for me.  I also found the music repetitive and the music transitions to be grating.  The majority of the documentary discusses the history and general information about the Shroud of Turin, and it only lightly goes into technical details for a short portion of the documentary.",1442880000,,322,5.056603773584905
