8153024,5,B000JU8HCE,"I'm a Crash Corrigan fan.  I like his persona, and love his fancy two-gun rigs.  But, I bought this DVD specifically because Tonto Basin Outlaws was written by John Vlahos, a native of my hometown of Springfield, Ohio.  This was one of six he wrote for the Range Busters, and that made it doubly enjoyable for me.

8153025,4,B000JU8HCE,"TRAIL OF THE SILVER SPURS is a pretty good B-Western involving some ghost town doings and an on-going gun fight between baddies George Chesebro and I. Stanford Jolley. The boys save the day (and the town) of course. Varying print quality seems to change from reel to reel.
I liked Tonto Basin Outlaws better as the boys are after horse rustlers back on Crash Corrigan's old home town turf. Here we find that as a kid Crash belonged to a secret club and was once known as Chipmunk Corrigan. His giving of the club's high-sign is a hoot! Tris Coffin plays his childhood pal who is really the top bad-guy behind everything. Ed Cobb is also on hand as a henchman. The print quality is better than ... SILVER SPURS making this one really enjoyable. So saddle up and ride with Crash, Dusty and Alibi, I'm glad I did!",1210982400,4,810,4.442953020134228
8153026,4,B000JU8HCE,"Monogram Pictures presents ""TRAIL OF SILVER SPURS/TONTO BASIN OUTLAWS"" (1941) (90 mins/B&W) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- With the success of Republic's Three Mesquiteers, several forces came together around 1940 to develop a new 'trigger trio' for the screen --- The star was Ray 'Crash' Corrigan, a producer named George W. Weeks and Monogram Pictures --- With a character of his own name. Ray starred in 20 of the 24 films in this series between 1940 and 1943 --- The Range Busters was clearly a lower budget copy of the Mesquiteers --- Big, muscular Ray 'Crash' Corrigan was the lead, the second lead was John 'Dusty' King, a big band singer (Ben Bernie Orchestra) with a reasonably good baritone, who would vocalize a tune or two in each film --- And comic relief was in the hands of ventriloquist Max 'Alibi' Terhune (and his wise-cracking dummy Elmer --- Monogram would distribute the Range Busters but not be directly involved in the productions --- The deal gave Corrigan a substantial share of the film profits (in an interview years later, Ray said he received 50%).

Stanford Jolley) and the gold taken from the Denver mint --- Dorothy Short, wife of actor-stuntman Dave O'Brien, is the heroine, while future singing cowboy star Eddie Dean shows up in a bit --- Both Corrigan and Terhune had been members of The Three Mesquiteers at Republic in the 30s --- Corrigan was a likable sort but was never a great actor.
