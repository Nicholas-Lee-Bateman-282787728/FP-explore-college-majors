8669654,5,B00M1CFYFQ,"This is basically the South African version of reservoir dogs, like a reverse remake if you ask me since it's foreign. avenged is better than reservoir dogs since it's faster paced, more violent, has more action, and you actually get to see the botched heist, but they rob an armored truck instead of a jewelry store this time, avenged has plenty of action and suspense, I promise you that. I definitely recommend avenged, but between this and firestorm, it depends on what kind of mood you're in, if you like having fun, go with firestorm, if you like something with more grit, go with avenged, either way, they both compliment each other and you won't be dissapointed with either of them.",1473897600,,690,4.710743801652892

8669660,4,B00M1CFYFQ,"Chili (S'Dumo Mtshali) and Shoes (Presley Chweneyagae) are South African policemen. They are poor but honest cops who are denied their reward by their dirty captain because they are not ""team players."" Chili opts to do just one dishonest thing for the big bucks, then stop and be honest afterwards. Shoes opposes, but agrees to stay on the fringe. As usual, things don't go as planned.

This was an excellent crime/police drama. I was surprised at the quality of the script which opens with an action/comedy scene. The cell phone scene created some good tension. I liked the characters which seemed realistic, i.e. not stock characters and a plot that was not formulaic. You will notice that the lips don't match what is being spoken, and I suspect Zulu was the original language of the film.

No sex or nudity. Rated ""R"" for violence and strong language. I don't recall any F-bombs. Implied incest.",1414195200,,899,4.8311688311688314
