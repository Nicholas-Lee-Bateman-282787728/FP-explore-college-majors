7155492,5,B00WZQOPLW,Better than any James Bond film.  The casting was perfect since it's animated and you can't see the faces of the voice-over actors.  Made me want to start drinking again and move back to Europe.,1441152000,,194,4.514285714285714

7155494,5,B00WZQOPLW,"Archer is a modern day take on all of the spy shows from the 1960's/1970's. The animation is great however; the characters and story lines can be a bit much. Oftentimes, I'll watch a number of a series episodes. With Archer, one episode at a time is about all I can handle. Archer a good looking bumbling agent who works for a private organization operated by his mother. His former love interest and an assortment of oddball characters work for the same agency. Each episode runs about 22 minutes. Not for everyone, the artwork superb.",1439942400,2,536,4.652631578947369
