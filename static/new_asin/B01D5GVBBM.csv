7697418,5,B01D5GVBBM,"This is IMO the best of the 30 for 30 ESPN features. While some of the major players are not interviewed, it almost makes it better to tell this story from the point of view of those who were affected from the outside.

You will experience a range of emotions from sadness to anger to frustration to joy to finally relief. It is a compelling story that unfortunately actually happened. There are real villains and real heroes.

I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested not only in sports but in the way our society makes villains of people in the press without waiting or even having all the facts. My heart goes out to these young men.",1485907200,5,647,4.428571428571429
7697419,5,B01D5GVBBM,"FANTASTIC example of how easily the media can be misled and then rampages over cold, sober, patient, objective review of evidence.",1472601600,5,130,5.238095238095238
7697420,5,B01D5GVBBM,"Amazing !written very well and directed, brought a lot of emotion to the viewer, a must see especially for those that remember this moment in sports history",1470873600,3,156,4.814814814814815
7697421,5,B01D5GVBBM,"Tale of Duke athletes accused of assault, their games are forfeited as an initial form of discipline. Then they are tried and convicted in the court of public opinion.

As the story moves along deceit is revealed which is stunning to behold. Sickening to see a complete breakdown in the legal system and jump to (wrong) conclusions by the media. Some of the media say they are sorry.",1462060800,,383,4.632352941176471
7697422,5,B01D5GVBBM,"This documentary is absolutely vital that it be viewed by as many individuals as possible. It is a thoroughly investigated documentary over the infamous Duke La Crosse case where the players were accused by a stripper of gang rape. SPOILER: It would ultimately turn out that the skank was a liar and was mentally ill, but before this happened, the media engaged in  intense lynch journalism. Parallel with this were the rabid feminists in Duke University, the blacks in Durham and in the university who decided that Da Sistah had to be avenged in a court of law, the politically correct faculty signing the usual petition, the physical harassment of the players, the forced resignation of the coach, the canceling of the season, the weak-ass college president and the evil, evil prosecutor. That prosecutors routinely destroy exculpatory evidence, make up evidence, and knowingly prosecute innocent individuals is a topic that has not been dealt with and is long overdue.

There was plenty of evil to go around, from the Duke Faculty to the police department to the New York Times (of course).",1461542400,7,1093,5.0
7697423,5,B01D5GVBBM,"Excellent documentary that highlights the corruption within our judicial system, reverse prejudice that has grown to epidemic proportions within our nation, and how the liberal media acts as judge and jury without any regard for truth.",1460764800,3,235,5.555555555555555
7697424,5,B01D5GVBBM,"This is a documentary that everyone should see.  It tells the tragic yet compelling tale of how anxious the media was to believe every accusation before there was a shred of evidence and before the investigation had even really begun.  This was a fairy-tale perfect example of what most in the media wanted to believe:  rich, privileged white kids raping a poor black girl.  Her false accusations, combined with a politically motivated prosecutor who was immune to facts, ruined the lives of three innocent players and their families, and did incalculable damage to every other member of the team that year, not to mention costing the coach his career.  All because of fantastic lies that people were eager to believe.",1460592000,7,718,4.95
7697425,5,B01D5GVBBM,"I was crying I was laughing so hard.  Completely documents the decline of humanity how the media and every moron jumped on the bandwagon (""they are _____, they must be guilty"")...Lives were permanently ruined (to this day, folks still think they are guilty, despite Crystal's and the DA's admissions and evidence) because they took the story of a stripper diagnosed with a mental disease hook, line, and sinker, and not a single person bothered to check it out.... except the defense attorneys.  Oh, and notice there were no riots when it was found out she lied.  Hmmm...wonder why.  Oh, wait, I know...

They do a great job giving ALL the information,, I learned so much.  Without giving MAJOR spoilers, there was more of a cover up than was reported by the media.  You MUST watch this documentary.  Its WAY more than just the alleged victim lying - this conspiracy went all the way to the top.  With a happy ending, including the death of someone...

Seriously, this gives a whole new meaning to ""Go with what you KNOW, not with what you THINK you know""  Trust, but verify.  Terrible tragedy, with a good ending, but with MANY lessons to be learned by all.",1459900800,5,1158,4.650246305418719
8754928,5,B01D5GVBBM,"I recently bought this and watched this.  The director did a tremendous job of laying out the facts and the suspense.  It was like a great mystery movie but a true story of a rape that didn't happen, lies, and corruption.  I am very pleased that the ending did provide an epilogue of how the Lacrosse Players went on with their futures, Nifong getting disbarred, and the real fact that the accuser turned out to be a second degree murderer.  That is why corruption doesn't belong in government or media.  People need to get the facts before jumping to conclusions.  A must see!!!!!",1528761600,,581,4.592233009708738
8754929,5,B01D5GVBBM,By far one of the best 30 for 30 documentaries ever made. Its sad how guilty until proven innocent is the current norm of society.,1527552000,,130,4.24

8754934,5,B01D5GVBBM,"possibly the best 30 for 30. I story everyone should see. So many people just assumed ""guilty"" - a great lesson in there's always 2 sides to a story and what you hear doesn't necessarily mean its the truth. Glad to see these young men vindicated in the end.",1501804800,,257,4.26530612244898

8754937,5,B01D5GVBBM,"This was awesome.  When you are watching, your mind is already made up and waiting for justice to be served when the story takes a dramatic turn.

I know feel bad for the guys.  They lost their season, a chance for a championship and almost their lives when the most startling turn of events occur.  A must see.",1489968000,,311,4.310344827586207
