8046788,4,B0007CG1RW,"Show #1 has guest Hal Linden (""Barney Miller""). A musical segment reminds everyone of what a versatile performer Linden is, from his long record of stage work to T.V. The show begins with a hysterical bit featuring Carol & Harvey as a distinguished theatrical couple touring with a huge hit play...whose success is brought tumbling down in one night at an outdoor astro-bowl with a ridiculously spread-out set, noises echoing off the structure, moths, and a wind storm. Tim Conway reprises his ""oldest man"" character as a sea captain & Harvey as the navigator (with Conway doing his best to make Harvey break up at his antics). The show climaxes with a ""Riverboat"" musical-comedy salute, with Vicki Lawrence hitting some incredibly high notes, and even Tim tries to sing..""tries"" is the word!
Show #2: Steve Lawrence's wife Eydie Gorme finally gets her shot as a guest. Two treasured comedy sketches return for this show. The first up is Mrs. Wiggins & Mr. Tudball. Wiggins is getting ready for her vacation to Las Vegas, and Tudball offers to show her how to play ""21""...another exercise in hilarious frustration, with Wiggins (surprisingly) getting the upper hand on her boss at the end. Next is the ""Family"" sketch, with wanna-be star Eunice (Carol) getting her big opportunity on ""The Gong Show"". A funny premise which ends on a note of pathos when Eunice gets gonged (as awful as her act was, I genuinely felt sorry for her when it happened). Another sketch has Carol as a distraught housewife being interviewed by a newsman (Harvey) when her husband is kidnapped...and each take becomes less genuine & more theatrical! Carol & Eydie wrap up the show with a medley of Hollywood tunes.
NOTE: Curiously, neither show begins with Carol's traditional Q&A with the audience.",1246320000,4,1774,4.936454849498328
