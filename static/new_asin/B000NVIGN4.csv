8181769,4,B000NVIGN4,"This is a funny movie.  If you like House Party III and Friday, you will love this movie.  I think this movie is probably one on the most underrated comedies I've seen in a long while.  I think once more people see this movie, it will go viral...trust.  Tony Roberts and Michael Colyar are hilarious in this movie.  I've been waiting for a house party movie like this for a long while now.  This movie is low-budget, but the actors did a great job!  There are a lot of jokes similar to House Party, instead of bad breath, one dude was musty as hell.  I will recommend this to friends and is definitely worth the viewing.",1330041600,,620,4.2844827586206895

8181771,2,B000NVIGN4,"The DVD cover is so deceptive.  In the same way that ""Apocalypto"" doesn't have its main character on the cover, this disc shows a DJ and not the host of the party.  Based on his size and complexion, I wonder if the DJ is based upon NWA's DJ Yella, who now does a different type of producing, if you know what I mean.  The women on the cover are just eye candy; this film had mostly men and mostly men had the speaking parts.

This was meant for a teenaged male audience.  It's full of alcohol, flirting with females, MJ humor, and the like.  This film is full of amateur actors, bad jokes, poor timing, and a lack of a plot.  This film is for you if you want to see 100 minutes of guffaw-guffaw, corny jokes.  In so many ways, this is a Black version of the Latino film ""Party Animalz.""  The only time I laughed if when a guy used a woman's chest as an armrest.

In a way, it has a very conservative message about race.  Like ""Biker Boyz,"" ""Drumline,"" and early episodes of ""A Different World,"" it has a token white character in it.  In the same way that the lone white male and lone white female in ""Dances with Wolves"" get together, the same happens in this film.  However, the white male character stops associating with his Black friends and their activities.  You could interpret this movie as condemning interracial friendships and interracial romances.

This film also inaccurately reflects ""the Chi,"" AKA Chicago.  There is a junior college here called Olive-Harvey, but the subtitles spell it ""Olive Hardy.""  This film is supposed to take place deep on the South Side, yet the main character appears instantly at an address that says 2267.  It would take a long time to travel that far north or that far west from where the main character was supposed to live.

If you liked ""Dumb and Dumber"" or the ""Friday"" series, then there's a small chance that you will like this.",1182988800,,1878,4.454545454545454
