While there are not many bust-a-gut laughs, the film sports a tounge-in-cheek, quiet humor built from the absurdity of people who, decades after the King died in 1977, are today still just as fanatical (or even more fanatical), about their idol.
The story is what I call a ""mockumentary"". That is, a film shot as if it were a documentary, but designed to lampoon it's own subject. These films are best when they take themselves seriously to the nth degree, like this one does. Basically, this is a mockumentary about making a documentary.
A down on his luck film maker is offered a gig making a documentary about people who have sighted Elvis, and possibly uncovering the King's hiding place. The film follows the story of the director's attempt to make his film while running a gauntlet of obstacles, including a greedy, know-nothing producer, her annoying assistant, a psychotic writer, an insane precognative bride of Elvis, crooked lawyers, and even someone who carries a framed Ding Dong that Elvis supposedly took a bite of!
Along the way, we get glimpses of a few famous faces, like Rip Taylor, Vicki Lawrence, and Mr. Blackwell. Fred Willard and his real-life spouse have a great scene, where Fred is cleaning his pool while wearing an Elvis jumpsuit he bought at a Hollywood boutique. He didn't want to get his ""regular pool-cleaning clothes"" dirty!
Like Star Trek fans and UFO believers, there is a large group of normal people interested in the topic of Elvis. Also like Star Trek fans and UFO believers, there are among them a fringe element of overzealous crazies that give the rest of the group a bad name.
Sadly, the truth is that everyone ""interviewed"" in this send-up is frighteningly true to life. While showing us a parody, the creators of ""Elvis is Alive"" cleverly show us characters who *could* be real people, lost in a sea of Elvis worship. And that's what the film is really about; people who are so wrapped up in their hobby, that they have lost all touch with common sense, reality, and in some cases, even sanity.
While the film is a bit offbeat, indie film fans will love it. Elvis fans may or may not, depending on whether they can take a little fun poked at them.",998179200,5,2282,4.693266832917706
