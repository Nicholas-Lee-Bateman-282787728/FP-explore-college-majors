8386694,5,B00316QY8M,"If you like John Denver, you will LOVE this !!  You also get a chance to see some of the ""corny"" ways of the 70's---but it is refreshing to see such a time of innocence when we loved our favorite singers because they were talented, and they loved to share those talents with us through music.  The songs had meaning and we could relate to them with thoughts of our own lives.  So unlike today's crass and tawdry people, most of whom can't even ""sing"".",1431993600,3,451,4.2823529411764705
8386695,5,B00316QY8M,"I have this concert as part of the 5 CD world tour package which is absolutely awesome. The wildlife concert will always be my very favorite JD concert..His voice had matured so much by then....The England 1986 concert makes me very sad. It's obvious that John is tortured by something during this concert. His voice breaks repeatedly, he misses beats...I wanted to cry for him - up there on stage doing his best knowing his heart wasn't in it. Read his autobiography to learn why he was hurting so much while performing that evening...... Oh - the makeup artist should have been fired for the job he did on John.",1321315200,11,613,4.581818181818182
