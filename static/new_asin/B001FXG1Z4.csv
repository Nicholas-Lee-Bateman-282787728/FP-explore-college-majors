3589508,4,B001FXG1Z4,"I am sure if you are watching Lucky Star up to this volume then you probably a fan of this show already, at the very least you enjoy this show enough to keep wanting more. It has similar slice-of-life/comedy like previous volume but with a few new characters introduce to the story. Only thing that bother me a bit was the annoying outro starting from this volume, it used real life people to do a little bit of singing close to sea probably somewhere in Japan for the outro for every single episode. It would have been 5 stars for this volume except for annoying outro that made me hit the skip button on my remote as soon as it starts playing the outro.",1227571200,,655,4.290322580645161
8302978,2,B001FXG1Z4,"I would have obviously given 10/5 stars because Lucky Star is amazing and this product is also amazing, butthis problem has now occurred twice. Whenever I order something like this it originally doesn't ship, and it is for weeks until I find out. I then click resend, but it ships me the original package as well, doubling my costs!! I have something to nitpick about the quality of the first package I received. Looking at it for the first time there us an obvious tear going down the side. Then upon opening I held the Miyuki character CD and it FELL APART in my hands. I looked at the shirt and it looked worn and it had tiny stains on the shoulders.
It has been too long, I'm afraid, to return it and get reimbursed... Which is unfortunate because I had paid for Amazon Prime and I would have expected fast and CAREFUL delivery...
The second one came in just perfect. Great product, wonderful song, awesome T-Shirt and always amazing episode CD.
2 stars until Amazon can fix my issue and reimburse me for the faulty product.",1396828800,,1028,4.502673796791444
8302979,5,B001FXG1Z4,Lucky Star's humor seems to continue in this volume their is an option for English or Japanese but i recommended the Japanese version the English dub is god awful,1370390400,,162,4.620689655172414
8302980,5,B001FXG1Z4,This is a wonderful installment of the series and anybody who has bought the other volumes is 100% likely to buy this one for their collection.,1360022400,,143,4.538461538461538

8302982,5,B001FXG1Z4,"I love it, the CD to the volumes to the shirt!!! I don't know why everyone is haten the shirts, I think there awesome, there so warm and big so I wear them as PJ. I also love the series because it just low key and cute. Its also a good break from other anime thats full of drama and action (not that I don't like those but if you watch them too much, you get kind of stressed but thats just my opinion) But this anime is really good, and the CD are so cool I love them.  I imported them into my iPod so I listen to the all the time. So I would defiantly recommend this to people.",1358899200,,579,3.7851239669421486
8302983,5,B001FXG1Z4,this is so cute and funny i love this you will be happy that you spent your money on this :3,1358035200,,92,3.4285714285714284
8302984,4,B001FXG1Z4,"The appeal of this anime lies in the cute character designs and the dialogue. Not very much actually happens here. It's mainly just the characters sitting around and talking to each other. But their conversations and personalities make the show pretty funny. There is a character in this series that is obsessed with the Haruhi Suzumiya anime. I think that's kinda funny since the voice actor was the same as in that series too. There's not really much to tell about Lucky Star, but even if that's true it's still pretty cute and funny. You may like if you give it a shot.",1351728000,,572,4.563106796116505
8302985,5,B001FXG1Z4,"it took a while for the dvd to arrive but when it did it was in awesome condition :) I love Lucky Star I love the animation and the characters. Konata is so funny and adorable and overall its just a really cute, funny anime.",1351468800,,224,4.0
8302986,4,B001FXG1Z4,"All the limited editions share a common weakness: The printed shirt. Only having it printed on a shirt isn't satisfying enough, although as for the box art and character CDs it's top notch! The songs are great (although of the bunch this is my least favorite CD).

I still think it's easily worth the purchase.",1247011200,,310,4.636363636363637
8302987,5,B001FXG1Z4,"Dear reviewer,

If you're buying this DVD, than you've probably watched the other 3 volumes.  Don't be cautious with the next 3!!  Kyoto Animation delievers on the spot everytime.  Of course, being extremely biased on English Dubbing, I didn't even get through a full episode of it till I switched to Japanese seiyuu's.  They need to start being serious with casting... and in till they do, I will keep listening/reading subtitle versions.

Don't forget other Kyoto Animation titles, K-On! is airing now, very Moe and cool.  Kanon (2006), Air (TV), Full Metal Panic (awesome anime), Clannad, and the ever so popular The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.  Buy all of them...  you won't regret it.

Lucky Star 5/5",1240531200,,708,4.9743589743589745
