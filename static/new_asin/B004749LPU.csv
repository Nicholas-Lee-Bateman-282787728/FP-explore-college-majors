Second: it should have been filmed in England as there are the locations described in the books. England has plenty of castles and cliffs, caves and even a few underground passages. It has the ambiente that this TV series lacks.

But apart from the wrong filming locations it's not bad to watch, nice entertainment for children. And it might get the kids interested in reading Enid Blyton's other suspenseful series of books like the Famous Five, the Five Find Outers & Dog, The Secret Seven, the R series with Barney & Miranda and the Adventurous Four.

If you or your kids want to watch a TV series that's based on Enid Blyton and that has been done in a perfect way, I can highly recommend the remake of the Famous Five TV series from the mid 90's. Everything looks typical forties, the cars, the fashion, the old trains. Even the actress who plays George looks like she does on Eileen Soper's book illustrations.
