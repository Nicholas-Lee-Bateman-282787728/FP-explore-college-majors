Seeing AMH was in this film it automatically is somewhat enjoyable. AMH plays Eddie Rodgers, a forensic expert, and he is the ONLY good thing about this film. His little speech on plutonium is exciting and his little exchange with Michael Ironside as they try to diffuse the bomb was well played. EVERYTHING else about this film was horrible!.. For example!:
The sound effects and overall sound quality of this film is bad. Explosions, gunshots, even the sounds of shoes hitting the concrete during the chase scenes are just pathetic.
 The voices of the actors are at times muffled, and the many many voice-overs used in this film on occasion do not match up with the actors lip movements making the verbal exchanges between characters very annoying.
The editing of this film is very very bad. Very choppy. The cameraman must have been dead drunk during filming, because the film itself looks like it was shot by a camcorder.
 Michael Ironside, who normally has such great presence on screen, is very weak. I was not impressed with his performance at all.
 I was however, impressed with Anthony Michael Hall's performance. He gave a fine effort, considering the average script and lousy cast he had to work with. He maintained that level of intensity that always makes him a joy to watch.
 The only thing that irritated me about AMH's role was it differed from what was illustrated on the film box. On the film box it shows AMH holding a gun looking like he is about ready to unleash a major ass-wooping! But in fact in this film he is clad in a white labcoat sitting in an office/board room for the entire duration of the film!
 He did have some great dialogue, and his delivery was amazing as always. Eddie Rodgers was the only convincing character in the entire film. The powers-that-be really did this film wrong by having Michael Ironside play the lead. Actually, and not just because I am biased, but I think AMH would have played the lead role much better than Ironside.
  This film rapidly loses life soon after it begins. Average script, bad actors, bad effects, bad angles, bad editing, the only good thing about this movie is Anthony Michael Hall.
  This movie is just a waste of time. Only see it if you are a fan of Ironside or Hall. Well maybe not an Ironide fan, because this was NOT his best work.
 As for me, I love Anthony Michael Hall, but not even AMH could save this P.O.S. (piece of shi*) movie!",1029801600,,2530,4.552863436123348
7897489,1,630584531X,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen!  It has nothing to do with bomb disposal. How they got the title is beyound me.  It's simply another emotionally devoid cop who at the last minute grabs a bunch of wires and saves the universe.  It's not worth the money and I am embarassed that a quality company like Amazon even offers it.  If your the least bit interested in how bomb squads work, or care about factual representation, steer clear of this flick.",1020211200,,454,4.433734939759036
