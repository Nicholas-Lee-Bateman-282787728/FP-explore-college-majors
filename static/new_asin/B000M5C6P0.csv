8166628,5,B000M5C6P0,"I am fairly new to Oxycise -- I had been working with only the book for about two weeks.  I decided to get a couple of DVDs so that I could pop them in first thing in the morning and let them guide me through a quick workout.  When I got this one, the introductory one, I was astonished to realize I had been doing the breathing/pulling in technique incorrectly.  I was doing pretty good with the book and getting some interesting results, but doing it the correct way after viewing the DVD is an eye-opener.  When you do the technique correctly, it's tougher and more effective.  It's also a lot to think about.  I've semi-started over and am relearning the positions with the correct technique, but quickly getting up to speed.  I recommend to everyone that if you have been working only with the book, get this DVD!  You may find as I did that you need some fine-tuning.",1432944000,3,873,4.4125
8166629,4,B000M5C6P0,"I haven't really gotten into the video which is why I gave it 4 stars, so when I do, will maybe change what I put here as a review",1428019200,,130,3.5172413793103448
8166630,4,B000M5C6P0,"I like that Jill Johnson clearly demonstrates proper breathing techniques, something that we all could practice.  It's like a tutorial on breathing that should be mastered before going on to the other Oxycise workouts.  This is also a good stand alone video for breathing fully and improving your overall health.",1405641600,3,312,5.22
8166631,5,B000M5C6P0,I love this exercise program.  I've been doing it for several years. I decided to buy this package to use as a loaner to friends who would like to try it out before purchasing.,1396310400,,176,4.176470588235294
8166632,5,B000M5C6P0,I had loaned my tapes to someone & never got them back so I. Was glad to find them at such a great price. I love this exercise!!,1371168000,,128,3.607142857142857
8166633,3,B000M5C6P0,"I really love the stretches in the Oxycise videos they are wonderful.
I've done Pilates before and am very experienced in working out.
People who see me comment they can tell I work out.

I don't know if I have a thyroid problem because they do say if you do,
you won't loose weight with these exercises. I have checked my thyroid
and blood results proved normal. Sometimes when there are thyroid problems
you do show up as normal even though later on you will have a thyroid
problem, and my mom has hypothyroid.

If you want the dvd for the stretches it is wonderful, I highly recommend
it for the stretches alone.

In the 2 weeks I did the breathing exercises with stretches my waist
increased 1.5 inches and in everything else went up 1 inch.
I wasn't feasting on food.

I was shocked, I think it's just the breathing technique does not work
for me. I'm doing the breathing properly. I was hoping to have a different
outcome.

15 years ago I ordered Body Flex with Greer Childers and
the same thing happened to me, I gained inches.

I only lose with traditional exercises.
But for the stretches alone it is wonderful.",1350086400,,1120,4.465686274509804
