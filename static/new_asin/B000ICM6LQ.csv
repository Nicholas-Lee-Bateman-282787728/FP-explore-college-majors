2655191,3,B000ICM6LQ,"The HD quality was relatively good given the challenges of underwater photography. Lighting was surprisingly well done. The image clarity was slightly less than the best I've seen for HD
The music was decidedly not my style. It seemed very new age.
I would highly recommend this for anyone interested in diving related content. I wouldn't hold this out as the pinnacle of HDTV quality, but it's relatively good. The subject is relaxing.",1184457600,,436,4.986301369863014
2655192,3,B000ICM6LQ,"After buying the HDscape Sampler disk, I decided to take the plunge and purchase a few of their full length products in HD-DVD.  One of those purchases was Visions of the Sea: Explorations.  To sum it up quickly, the ambience is nice and comforting, but the picture quality is blurry and sometimes just dull.

Its a great video to have running in the background during a family/friend get together or as something soothing to watch to unwind from a hard day at work.  As stated earlier, this video from HDscape isn't the sharpest overall picture I've seen from their other products, but their is a difference between the HD version and the standard version.  Biggest complaints to the picture was that it was too blurry during scenes with brighter colors and that it just wasn't sharp enough during scenes with numerous fish and underwater plants.  Again, I have to compare these underwater scenes with those of Planet Earth, which is vastly superior on every level in picture quality to this.

Visions of the Sea isn't a documentary either, merely ambience.  Another HDscape product, Antarctica Dreaming, was both a documentary & ambient video.  With all the different types of plantlike, creatures, and fish shown in this video, I would have loved to learn more about them.

So overall, Visions of the Sea: Explorations isn't a great video, but it's not bad either.  Video quality stands out as the main problem, but the ambience strengthens the overall presentation.  There are a couple of extras on the disk too, like previews from other HDscape products, but nothing exciting.  Buy if you must, but there are other, much better, HD-DVD nature documentaries/ambience like Planet Earth and Antarctica Dreaming that I would recommend first.",1183939200,3,1742,4.986159169550173
2655193,5,B000ICM6LQ,"If you are a scuba diver and have an HD DVD player you will absolutely love this disc.  I have many HD movies and Blu-ray movies but the picture quality in this video in HD is outstanding, the best of anything I've seen. I have the Toshiba HD-AX2. I ordered this disc back in Jan. and it was well worth the wait.  There is gentle music in the background, no commentary or info. as to what you are seeing so it isn't educational for those not already knowledgeable. I can't imagine anyone who loves marine life not enjoying this disc in HD. I hope they make more like this in the future.",1181520000,11,586,4.223214285714286
2655219,5,B000ICM6LQ,One of our favorites! They captured many exotic sea creatures up close and the picture is fantastic with vivid colors!,1388534400,,118,4.95
2655220,3,B000ICM6LQ,"Both Marine Aquarium and Visions of the sea are Great underwater shots but they are both exactly the same---Not any difference at all. While I love the underwater camera shots, I am more than a little disappointed by the sad reality that I have been duped again. I am an easy mark being that it is reasonable to assume that the one called Visions of The Sea would be different than the one called Marine Aquarium. The reason that they look so much alike is because they are identical in every way even down to the Plant life and Coral ---Oh! and one ""Nemo"" type Clown fish that appears right on schedule in exactly the same place at exactly the same time in either disc. I will give it to my daughter. Very disappointed.",1387756800,,720,4.380597014925373

2655223,4,B000ICM6LQ,The under water photography is beautiful as well as the great variety of fish and sea creatures. It is accompanied  by relaxing music. It makes for a nice background video. I first saw it at an artist's home which was part of a studio tour. It encouraged people to linger. We did end up buying a pottery vase. I decided I had to get the blue-ray video too from amazon.,1364688000,,368,4.257142857142857

My wife and I are both scuba divers, and this DVD makes you feel visually like you are scuba diving.  If you are considering an aquarium DVD for your HD TV, get this one, not one of the stationary aquarium ones.  You will not be disappointed. The camera work is phenomenal and you will actually thoroughly enjoy watching it!!",1325808000,,418,4.4605263157894735

Only one of these played on my DVD.  The other one had scratches on it and would not play.
Was very disappointed because I gave it as a gift.

2655228,5,B000ICM6LQ,"This is one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen. Coral reefs are perhaps the most beautiful and complex environments there are. I enjoy watching this over and over. Highly recommended.

I encourage the producers of this video to offer more coral reef documentaries.

2655250,4,B000ICM6LQ,"I have the entire set of HD Blu-Ray DVDs by Air Sea Land Productions. I prefer this one to the Aquarium which I got bored of quickly. In fact I've played it on a Panasonic Plasma TV (about 42"") for several days as an aquarium.

Video is from Fiji, Bonaire, Roatan and the Bahamas.

The video is razor sharp and there are many different kinds of fish, including plenty with bright colors (e.g. cobalt blue, bright yellow). I saw many amazing fish I'd never seen before.

There's a fair balance between macro shots and wider angles. Sometimes the camera will zoom in to the creature's eyeball.

The music I don't particularly like, so I turn the volume down to very low or off. Sometimes it is more eerie, sharp, and dramatic than relaxing.

Most often the camera focuses on one fish or a few fishes; occasionally you'll see large schools of fish.

Besides the fish you'll see some of the underwater plant life and various intriguing and unusually shaped creatures.

Most of the video was done on a tripod; for some the cameraman was moving forward, exploring.

Chapter 4 follows a large turtle swimming just above the ocean floor.

There are 12 chapters and it runs a generous hour total.

The DVD ends with a gorgeous slow sunset.",1275436800,,1230,4.60091743119266
2655251,3,B000ICM6LQ,"This video is okay, but beware that the camera rarely lingers on a scene for more than 15 seconds.  Some of the most beautiful shots last for only 5 seconds before a new shot is edited in.  Great looking stuff & a good picture as far as I can tell with my 720 p, but IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR RELAXATION, THERE ARE BETTER TITLES OUT THERE.  The Hawaii Beaches one is much better for relaxation.",1265414400,2,391,4.118421052631579

2655253,3,B000ICM6LQ,"The photography is beautiful and the variety of sea life impressive.  However, I was hoping for a nice aquarium DVD to play as a calming background in the room.  This is NOT it.  It's more like a nature film with lots of camera movement constantly changing view.  If you are looking for a relaxing aquarium DVD, you'll be disappointed.  It's more like a nature documentary....without narrative.",1254009600,7,394,4.909090909090909
2655254,3,B000ICM6LQ,"Picture quality is superb. The problem with this disc is that it contains no narration whatsoever, and so its educational value is nil (zero, zip, nada!). Should have listened to one of the other reviewers and spent my money on something else. Also, that background music is really soporific (yawn :-O)!",1242518400,,303,4.96078431372549
2655255,3,B000ICM6LQ,"Purchased this DVD to see the capabilities of my new Blu-Ray player.  It's enjoyable, but not the greatest thing I've ever seen.  The colors in most of the scenes are a little washed out - probably do to the filming.  A diver myself, I understand the affects of bright overhead sunlight and the colors of coral.  This was apparently shot on a marginal day (or several scenes were shot on cloudy days).  That said, the reproduction of the cloudy days underwater scenes is very realistic.  Washed out purples, washed out charcoals, washed out yellows are all symptomatic of a cloudy day diving.  There are some great scenes for color - don't get me wrong.  The scenes with lots of little fish definitely show off the blu-ray capability better than scenes with 1 or 2 large items in the view.  I give it a 3...",1234310400,7,807,4.548611111111111

2655281,5,B000ICM6LQ,We really enjoyed this DVD.  The images are so clear you can see tiny fish and other creatures swirling in the sea water.  The video moves at a good pace for relaxed viewing.

2655287,1,B000ICM6LQ,"this DVD is fairly good quality and looks good on the screen, but they have edited it too quickly.  It would have been nice if they lingered for awhile on each scene, but instead just when you are looking at the fish or undersea item, they change scenes.

The H.D quality is amazing, it's like looking into a really big saltwater aquarium, but you don't have to clean this one or feed the fish.  If you want to show off your new high def television, pop this in and they will stop in their tracks. And the cost is really cheap, especially considering where they went to film, the airfare alone would break you. Highly recommend this one......",1204934400,18,489,4.411111111111111

I do have issues with the sound. I found the 5.1 soundtrack to be rather bright sounding, to the point that it hurt my ears. The 2 channel ""mellow"" soundtrack was better.
Overall, this is a nice disc, but not as good as my standard for this subject, ""Coral Sea Dreaming"", which is still better overall and highly recomended, but not available in HD",1191715200,7,597,4.339285714285714

Classical, reggae, calypso, or light jazz would be a great option.  I really get tired of the new age-like instrumental music after awhile.  If you are viewing it at home turn down the audio and play your choice of music on your stereo.  This is why I gave it 4 stars.  The high definition quality is good.
