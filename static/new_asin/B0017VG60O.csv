8267482,4,B0017VG60O,"I saw this movie a couple of years ago and was surprised to find it available on Amazon. I ordered the movie as a gift for my brother and he was able to revive it in a timely fashion. i was hesitant to watch the movie at first because I thought it would be a low quality film, but it exceeded my expectations. It gave detailed information about rap and culture in the Bay Area and I was able to really see its influence on the genre as a whole.",1469491200,,444,3.9444444444444446

8267488,5,B0017VG60O,"WOW... I've been into this whole hyphy thing for awhile now but i never knew the whole history... this film is great! dating back to when the black panthers ran the bay area... so much to learn when watching this it made me love what i do even more :) and to the guy who said they don't do a background on any of the current rappers... homeboy ur trippin! Mista Fab, Jay Diggs, Keak da Sneak these are all bay area legends and to remeber Mac Dre (T.I.P) in this movie is just .... WOW ive learned so much more and respect these artists and what they stand for so much more",1234310400,,572,4.070796460176991
8267489,5,B0017VG60O,"Ghostride the Whip was a very well made DVD. The choice of SWAY from MTV being the Narrarator was great as he has a nice voice to listen to. Lots of subjects are covered. Dances,History,Artists, and other things that some people are not aware about. The Documentary was great from start to finish and should be a must buy if you are a fan of Hyphy music. If you are a music person and have no clue what Hyphy music is, Ghostride the Whip will introduce you the main aspect.",1220054400,,473,4.266666666666667
8267490,5,B0017VG60O,"This is an amazing doc that chronicles the bay area Hyphy scene.  Much better the the cover would suggest, I highly recommend it for those who love Hip Hop and outrageous bay behavior.  It features the most important Hyphy artists and tell a great story.  It's a lot deeper then you would expect. If you know the bay then you know that Mac Dre had a huge influence.  He was the jumping point for the whole culture.  This film tells his story in a way that organically works with the Hyphy movement.  The film does deal with the current state of Hyphy, they have Traxamillion, Keak Da Sneak, Mistah F.A.B. so I don't know what Duke's talking about. My suggestion to  Duke is, go back to watching John Wayne movies.",1217894400,,713,4.438461538461539
