8645370,4,B00ITAQ49O,"I chose this collection because it had the Himalayan on it, which was chosen by Angela Mao Ying herself in an interview on a previous dvd. Will be nice to see more selections, but do find some of these old martial arts films fairly poor production and very formulatic.",1435449600,,268,4.489795918367347
