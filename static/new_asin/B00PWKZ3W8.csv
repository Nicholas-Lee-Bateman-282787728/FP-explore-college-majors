6824793,5,B00PWKZ3W8,"I love this DVD. Moving around a lot I have had several quality levels of instructors and had learned many techniques incorrectly. These Ryan Hall DVD series have given me back the joy in Jits. I can now go to my provincial gym and study world class technique, despite our instructor not always being the best possible. I practice the moves at home with my girlfriend and then ask my instructor to help me refine them in class.

I have started to go to BJJ more regularly because I have a clear goal again and am not dependent on other students for my progress. I have gained clear insight into the mechanics and theory of these moves and, having watched all Ryan Hall DVDs, am starting to see and feel the bigger picture when rolling live. So thank you Ryan Hall for making these excellent series and allowing me to train well without moving to Hio and therefore being able to push forward in other areas of my life.

The first DVD analyzes the Open Ellbow concept and makes understanding the Omaplata and the Kimura (but also all other armlocks and even arm triangles) much easier. The concepts alone are pure gold, they are something I have otherwise only learned when hanging around the gym on an afternoon and going through a technique in detail for hours.

The second DVD goes into the Kimura and its applications. Note that the beauty of this DVD is that it showed me how I can ""roll"" with the Kimura. As long as I maintain it, I do not need to finish in a particular manner and can roll along with my opponent until he is tired out. (Even good old Seph shows you a finish on this disc! He is actually quite eloquent and seems to be a great teacher.)

The third disc deals with the Omaplata and its related positions, again how one rolls with it and deals with resistance. Great concepts. The absolute highlight happens on this disc when Ryan describes a trapping situation and compares it to the movie ""Predator"", even impersonating Dutch, speaking like him and letting himself be caught by the Predator then turning things around with mud, and a bow and arrow before finishing him off with a ""big ole log"". I will never forget this position and will from now on always smile when applying this move during class.

To me, buying these DVDs is like having an awesome seminar at my house, except that I can re-watch it endlessly and start to understand it better and better. My technique has gotten a lot better, I take more pleasure in going to class again and feel like I have saved a ton of money on seminars. I will still go to most seminars, but with those solid basics, can judge and understand what is taught on a much more sophisticated level. Thank you Ryan Hall for this great production.",1421107200,4,2704,4.476673427991886
6824794,5,B00PWKZ3W8,Excellent video series!  I've been training 14 years and the concepts in here are giving me new eyes to see where my opponents are vulnerable.,1420934400,2,142,4.68
6824795,4,B00PWKZ3W8,"Like the majority of his DVD sets, there is a lot of talking; however that does NOT take away from the quality of instruction. I'm an advance purple under a reputable camp and I have to say that the  details on the kimura are invaluable. He goes into kimura grip breaks, hand positions, tranaitions from kimura to other attacks and of course the theory.  He doesn't just teach the technique, he also teaches the theory and principles on why it works. I haven't watched the Omaplata DVD set yet but when I do I will post a review. Look, get the set. Ryan Hall and Saulo have the BEST DVD sets out there. 4 stars because there is some profanity and my 6 year old does BJJ but unable to watch these vids with me.",1419033600,15,709,4.2444444444444445

8689558,4,B00PWKZ3W8,"Great series with great info. If you're a BJJ or Submission Grappling practitioner you should get this series. Took a star off, though, because Ryan Hall tends to rant a little bit too much, wasting valuable teaching time.",1444867200,,222,4.868421052631579

8689560,5,B00PWKZ3W8,"Again, another home run for Ryan. I download all his instructional series from dvd to my computer so I can put them on my tablet and use these for the base of my training. The open elbow is one of my new favorite. The details have helped me go from never really using the kimura to regularly hitting it in training.",1424217600,2,315,4.180327868852459
8689561,4,B00PWKZ3W8,"I own all other of Ryan's DVDs and I like them because he explains things in depth. If you do jiu jitsu I would say buy his entire series.

Here he explains the open elbow, its importance, then the kimura & omaplata position. He goes in depth on how to get your opponent to open the elbow,  maintain the position via true positional control (not brute force), and a little only on the final finish. What really stands out from the multiple other jiu jitsu dvds I own is his explanation on controlling the position. He is better at this than any of the other experts I've seen.

But I will still point out just a couple of negatives because I feel I must: 1. Faulty explanation of the open elbow explanation. 2. Cursing. Stop reading the review here if you don't need in detail explanation of these 2.

Ryan's explanations on the mechanics of a strong arm in versus weak arm out is a little off. I say this as a physician (and proud to be one of the best, I worked hard for it)... expert in the human body, not in jiu jitsu. Though honestly most people won't notice the explanation is off. I believe Ryan did not study how the human body works before coming up with his explanation. He is a very smart guy & used his logic. Unfortunately one cannot arrive at all conclusions correctly with just logic.

For example, Seth tries to pull open Ryan's closed elbow and Ryan shows Seth can't do it. Then with his arms out stretched he shows they are easy to push into his body. Then his conclusion, ""So see....bringing my elbow in makes me stronger and bring them out make me weaker."" But he used the uncorrelating examples: comparing muscles that move in opposite directions.

To fight the opening of your elbow you are using very strong muscles for adduction (back & chest muscles).  The muscle for holding up you stretched out arms are the relatively weak deltoids. Bringing in your arm will always be stronger than bringing out your arm whether your elbow is in or out.

A better example follows. Try to bring your arm in and then try bringing your arm out from this starting position: 10 degrees & 110 degrees away from your body. This would show that in both directions it is harder to move the arm at 110 degrees as compared to 10 degrees. Instead he compared strength of moving in (stronger muscles) versus moving out (weaker muscles).

The next negative is the cursing. It takes away from the professional atmosphere and cheapens jiu jitsu. For example: ""if you push me to the left you can predict my arm will extend out, but don't strike me to the left because if you strike me to the left them I am going to F*&K you up!!!"" It is bully, unprofessional behavior. I know Ryan Hall practices boxing. If Mike Tyson threatened you in a similar fashion, my conclusion would be the same.

I take away 1 stars for the unprofessional and for the open elbow explanation being off a bit. The explanation quality on controlling your opponent is excellent though. Buy the dvd. You won't regret it.",1422057600,8,2988,4.476102941176471
