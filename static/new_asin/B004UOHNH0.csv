4469643,4,B004UOHNH0,Looks good and got here in good time. Can't wait to watch all of it. Should be a good choice. Thanks!,1345248000,,101,3.857142857142857
4469644,4,B004UOHNH0,"I own several of these TCM Collections, and I must say this is the most oddly assembled collection I've seen. Rather than remanufacturing these four movies and replicating them on 2 discs like the other collections I own, all four movies are stacked on top of each other in an extra deep spindled case. I suppose this is good for quality reasons. My main reason for buying this was for the Long Long Trailer which froze on two previous copies of the Lusy/Desi Collection. All movies play fine and it is a shelf space saver.",1344384000,2,523,4.515789473684211
4469645,4,B004UOHNH0,"All of these are available on other collections. Two of them show the Lucy you probably remember best in ""The Long Long Trailer"" with then husband Desi Arnaz as a couple on a honeymoon from hell that almost ends their marriage before it really gets started, and ""Forever Darling"" in which an angel - in the form of James Mason - helps Lucy save her marriage, again to then husband Desi Arnaz. Du Barry was a Lady is a musical that doesn't quite work, but there are some good bits by stars Ball, Skelton and Kelly. The oddball in the bunch is Room Service. This is more of the Marx Brothers' movie than it is Lucy's although she is definitely playing a leading role here. I thought it did a good job of taking the Marx Brothers back to their roots, but it just isn't a Lucille Ball showcase film. A better choice would have been ""The Big Street"" which was one of Lucy's better dramatic performances and just an overall great movie.",1310774400,2,930,4.381502890173411
4469646,4,B004UOHNH0,"This will no doubt be one of the big sellers in TCM's ""Greatest Classic Films Collection"", a series designed to bring classic movies to the masses in budget-friendly double disc sets.  However it's a bit of a shame that this Lucille Ball-themed collection doubles up on films already covered in the series.

THE LONG, LONG TRAILER is in the TCM Comedy set, and ROOM SERVICE can also be found in the Marx Brothers set.  LONG, LONG TRAILER is undoubtedly Lucy's best film comedy, and operates almost like a feature-length ""I Love Lucy"" episode (it was filmed at the height of ""Lucy"" mania).  ROOM SERVICE is a Marx Brothers film first and foremost, with young Lucy in one of her first major supporting roles.

Of the two remaining films, FOREVER DARLING is one of Lucy's most disappointing, downright dreary comedies (and her co-star James Mason always regarded it as one of his worst films).  The story sees Lucy and Desi Arnaz playing a married couple on the verge of a messy divorce, until a Guardian Angel - played by James Mason - intervenes.  DU BARRY WAS A LADY is a big splashy Technicolor musical, based on the hit Broadway show, in which Ball shares the screen with an up-and-coming Gene Kelly, and Red Skelton.

Why TCM has decided to recycle ROOM SERVICE is anybody's guess (though I can rationalise why LONG, LONG TRAILER is here once more).  Instead of ROOM SERVICE, I would have preferred perhaps ""The Big Street"" (one of Lucy's best dramatic performances); or maybe even the delicious ""Dance, Girl, Dance"".",1302480000,29,1520,4.770992366412214

As a gift for my girlfriend, she was ecstatic! She had never seen the films of Lucy before, because they are rarely sold in stores. So first I'd like to thank the seller and amazon for having this! It was bought new, and came very fast thanks to prime. These movies pack a punch of laughter and makes you envision where true talent comes from. I will definitely be buying more older movies off of Amazon, keep em' coming!!",1437523200,,571,4.2

Forever Darling is okay for a watch but not so much for a rewatch. Dru Barry I forwarded thru a great deal of it's, Red Skelton had some laughs, and room service you need to be a Marx brothers fan, not a Lucy fan to enjoy.  Would not buy again!",1411689600,,401,4.063291139240507

Both movies are definitely 5 star, and if you're a Lucy fan and have not seen either of them, then DO!  The other two movies, ""Du Barry Was A Lady"" and ""Room Service"" are fun, as well.  Each movie comes on its own disc, which is nice.  They're all crammed together into the same case, which is understandable given the price. I'll transfer each disc to its own case for protection.  Shipping and delivery were also 5 star, as I received the set in less than 10 days, which, considering that I live overseas, is fast.  It's win-win all-round!",1410220800,9,651,4.47457627118644

8441906,3,B004UOHNH0,"I Love Lucy, but this was a stinker.  The Long, Long Trailer is the best of the lot, especially for anyone who has lugged a trailer around the USA.  However, the other three were boring, I mean just plain boring.  Quality of the DVDs is good, video and audio are good.  But the film subjects were awful, I turned off the other three movies halfway through.",1502582400,,356,4.348484848484849
