7316547,1,B010TIZC2S,"It has been a while since I have seen a film this boring.  Seems to emphasize the different perceptions of men and women.  The former sees it as a trivial mole hill, but the latter as Mont Blanc!  The acting is ok.  As a long tine fan of Rampling, I actually felt this was not up to her usual beautiful performances.  Certainly not Oscar worthy!  Take a two hour nap instead of wading through this over-rated, over-interpreted, overblown piece.",1455408000,4,444,4.556962025316456
7316548,1,B010TIZC2S,45 years ago my future bride dragged me to a movie called Claire's Knee. We have been married 44 years and that movie has been my benchmark for the worst movie we have seen together. Now in our 45th year together we have a new benchmark for worst film. Oddly enough it's called 45 years. It was torture to sit through this film. Watching paint dry is much more exciting because you know the outcome and can cheer for progress along the way. This movie just rambles on.,1454976000,7,468,4.329545454545454
7316549,4,B010TIZC2S,"""45 Years"" brings the story of Kate and Geoff, an elder English couple. As the movie opens, we see Kate doing her morning walk with the dog in the countryside of England. When she returns, she brings in the mail, which includes a letter for Geoff. It turns out to be a letter from the Swiss authorities, informing him that they have found the body if his ex-girlfriend Katya after more than 50 years, perfectly preserved in the ice and snow of the Swiss Alps since 1962. This is devastating news for Geoff, and it causes him to reflect and speak out to Kate about Katya. How will this affect the couple's upcoming 45th wedding anniversary party? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this movie is the latest from writer-director Andrew Haigh, who previously brought us the gay drama ""Weekend"". Here he goes a very different way, dissecting the impact of a long lost love on a couple's 45 years of marriage. This is a ""talk"" movie where we simply observe the characters. The conversations between Kate and Geoff feel authentic. After yet another tense discussion about Katya, Geoff sighs ""I suppose a cuddle is out of the question?"", wow. Later on, Kate exclaims ""I don't think I can talk about her anymore!"". Speaking of Kate and Geoff, as I'm pretty sure you've heard by now, Charlotte Rampling is simply fantastic as Kate, battling against the ghost of an ex-girlfriend of over 50 years ago (and deservedly rewarded with an Oscar nomination for Best Actress), but equally towering is Tom Courtenay's performance as her husband (sadly and incomprehensively, he has been completely ignored during the current awards season--he did win the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 2015 Berlin International Film Festival, where this movie premiered). To see these performers at work is nothing but pure delight for us the movie-goers, in particular since Haigh brings the movie in a completely believable and authentic way.

""45 Years"" finally opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati, and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely (with a heavy emphasis on seniors, perhaps not surprisingly). I don't think Charlotte Rampling will win the Best Actress Oscar (that seems to be destined for Brie Larson), but regardless, with great word of mouth this movie surely will generate, ""45 Years"" has all the making of becoming a solid hit on the art-house theater circuit. If you love an adult drama with superb acting performances, you cannot go wrong with this, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""45 Years"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1454716800,6,2743,4.858974358974359
7316550,4,B010TIZC2S,"Theatrical review.  I thought the premise behind this movie was terribly interesting.  In addition, Charlotte Rampling is up for an Oscar.  So I made the long drive to one of the few art houses in the area that show these smaller films.  Set in rural England, Rampling plays Kate Mercer who is planning a 45 year wedding anniversary with her husband Geoff (Tom Courtenay).  With only a few days until the big event, Geoff receives a letter (in German) notifying him that a girlfriend from 1962 has been found buried and preserved in ice in Switzerland.  She had evidently fallen years earlier as they were climbing a mountain and was never found.  Hes stunned by the fact and begins to obsess over 50 year old memories.  He tries to explain the relationship to Kate, but seems to dig himself deeper into a hole, especially when she asks him if he would have married her if she hadnt died.  When he answers honestly, Kate begins to question their entire marriage.

The film essentially deals with the few days leading up to the anniversary party.  Geoff goes so far as to inquire about a trip to Switzerland, but demurs because of his age and physical frailties.  Kate, not surprisingly begins to question her place in life, possibly with a husband who still pines for a lost love from decades earlier.  For me, I was hoping the two of them would go to Switzerland and check out the old gal.  Geoff was actually listed as next-of-kin to the deceased lover, primarily due to the fake marriage ruse they used to get boarding during their travels.

A bit more intrigue would elevated the story from what is essentially a 2-person stage play.  Both Rampling and Courtenay are terrific, but director Andrew Haigh and his adapted screenplay are more concerned with the byplay between the seasoned actors.  He focuses on longing glances, brief conversations and extreme close-ups.  I believe this is a good movie featuring terrific acting, but it is far from the glorious film many think it is or could have been.",1454371200,6,2005,4.712643678160919
7316551,1,B010TIZC2S,Dreadful sums it up.,1454112000,3,20,4.25
7316552,4,B010TIZC2S,"This film starts off with a random morning routine in the lives of Kate Mercer and her husband, Geoff, both retired and childless. After Kate walks in from walking their dog, they get ready to eat breakfast when Geoff opens a letter that Kate just brought in from the mailbox outside. They live in the English countryside but this letter comes from Switzerland. He stops and stares at it, and Kate asks him what it is. He says, in a very low voice : ""They found her."" Kate immediately knows who he's referring to. It's Katya, Geoff's girlfriend from before he met Kate. This letter sets off a firestorm of emotions in both Kate and Geoff that threatens to change their lives forever.

Kate is in the last stages of planning her and Geoff's 45th wedding anniversary party. We learn soon enough that they had planned to throw a party when their 40th anniversary rolled along, but Geoff got sick and those plans were shelved. The events that transpire after this letter is received might change all that.

At first Kate wants to know the details of what happened to Katya (who had disappeared many years before when she and Geoff went out hiking in some glaciers in Switzerland. She was found (exactly how, we never know) deep in the ice, apparently preserved enough to positively identify her. Geoff seems to feel jealous of her, because she still looks young, while he looks ""like this"". It doesn't seem to occur to him that she has been dead for over 50 years while has lived a full life since then.

When Kate presses Geoff for answers, he confesses that he is still listed as Katya's next of kin, because he never changed the records. This really hits Kate hard, and she begins, to her own amazement, to feel jealous of this woman whom she never knew but who seems to have a solid grip on her husband after all these years. A few times in the film, Geoff slips and refers to her as ""my Katya"", which seems like a slap in the face to Kate. Both Kate and Geoff fall into a kind of funk, and they slowly stop communicating with each other. Geoff starts smoking again, while Kate becomes more and more sullen. During a particularly stressful bedtime conversation, she tells Geoff that she no longer wants to talk about Katya at all. This is when she starts to shut off.

The film transpires during the course of one week, during which both Kate and Geoff become somewhat obsessed with the past, what their lives were like before they met each other. Geoff starts spending more and more time on the attic, rummaging through old mementos of a life he had seemed content to forget but was now rushing back at him in a pretty violent way. Kate ventured into the attic one day while Geoff is away and discovers some things (and information she was not aware of) that shatters her completely. She does not share her discovery with Geoff, but continues to wallow in her sadness. Although it is never mentioned in the dialog, the fact that her name is Kate and the deceased girlfriend is named Katya does not escape us, and we can feel Kate slowly realizing that maybe her and Geoff never really connected as a couple, and that maybe Geoff was just looking for a replacement for Katya all along.

By the end of the film, we feel we have known Geoff and Kate for years, and in between lunches with friends and Kate's daily walks around her rural home and in town, we see different facets of their lives, which used to be idyllic. We are left with the sad realization that their lives have changed forever, and probably not in a good way. The final scene is heartbreaking, and leaves us wondering what will happen now, but no hints are given.

This is a powerful film about the depths of love and grief, and what happens when the two collide in a marriage that has withstood so many prior storms. Both characters struggle with regret, and in the case of Geoff, shame. It's obvious they have loved each other until now. Will that change?",1453939200,49,3924,4.496493688639551

They will be about to celebrate 45 years of marriage. He has a secret from his youth years that remain behind stage. And she is well aware of it.

Somehow this slow paced film will capture you. It's such the emotional burden that surround them as welll as the semiotic of the film that you must watch it very carefully.

I must be honest with you my dear reader. My bet runs for Rampling as Best Actress in the next Academy Awards. It would be a huge accolade for her previous and memorable films of the past in Europe, a sincere tribute for her artistic legacy. Jeniffer Lawrence can wait. She is very young and will have countless oportunities.

Courtenay is irresistible too. I still remeber him in Dr. Zhivago and The dresser, and thanks this film the people will remind him as a venerable actor with panache and verve.

Both of them won in the past Berlinade prizes as Best Actor and Best Actress. As long I can remember we should bring back to 1971 when Simone Signoret and Jean Gabin made it in the unforgettable film Le Chat (Pierre Granier Deferre) .",1453680000,9,1207,4.595348837209302
7316554,5,B010TIZC2S,"Tom Courtney portrays a 45 year long married man about to celebrate their anniversary. Charlotte Rampling brilliantly potrays his multi-faceted life partner who's learned a long kept secret of her husband's. The plot becomes most pointedly about her responses to what could be a relationship shattering new revelation.

It's long over due that Rampling's acting abilities to convey a variety of character conflicted emotions is recognized offifiously by the US AFI!  Well deserved tgat she is a Best Actress Oscar nominee. Of course, a host of international accolades have been bestowed upon Rampling for this performance. I expect that pattern to continue because this is Rampling playing a wife whose emotions must be conveyed, through her acting skills, as conflicted, yet, somehow, remarkable, under the circumstances. Courtney's perfornance as Rampling's leading man is quite well done. But, it that order: Courtney is Rampling's leading man.

Still not released for the public on DVD in the US, that is also the typical mistreatment of truly great British films. Mine comes from the UK and requires an international DVD player to view.",1453161600,37,1141,5.3277777777777775

7316558,2,B010TIZC2S,"When I first saw the trailer to this movie and saw the implication of the plot line I felt sure that the 'secret' was either going to be that the husband a) had an affair many years ago b) he had been responsible for the accidental death of a girlfriend many years ago or c) that he had been a nazi collaborator during the war...something close to those three possibilities. I mean that's the way the trailer seemed to imply the level of secrecy of things. And then you find out that it was simply that the girlfriend he had before he was married who died (which the wife was aware of) was more along the lines of his soulmate who he had kept a diary of their love and many photo slides of all these years hidden away. She may also have been pregnant with his child when she died though the husband never tells his wife this. The movie has great acting and the scenes all keep you interested in their lives but the almost complete absence of drama throughout the movie tends to trick you into thinking there's going to be a sudden burst of drama near the ending or even the last third of the movie. No such thing happens. Instead the movie ends in a scene at their 45th anniversary party where the wife separates from a dance with her husband (after he gives a very completely uninspiring dedication speech to his wife) and she is just standing there with a despondent and contemplative look on her face. And then the movie ends right there. And unless you are completely empathetic to what really boils down to nothing more than her 'disappointment' in that moment then it's going to feel like the most pointless and 'mailed in' ending ever which in reality it is. I really had high hopes for this movie but in the end the director somehow thought that the idea of simple personal 'disappointment' was enough to create a really emotionally compelling outcome for a movie. It was not. If you had experienced exactly what the actress had experienced in real life then I think this movie would really hit the spot. But otherwise I don't see how you can empathize with such a minimal level of emotional distraughtness and outcome. To make this movie more compelling I would have suggested to the director to include nostalgic dream scenes between the husband and his former love. I think that could have made it tremendously more compelling and rich. I think any movie that really doesn't contain severe levels of drama must compensate by something else, whether that be a bit of dark comedy, showcasing character flaws or by producing emotional contrasts such as really binding nostalgic scenes. Or even an ironic twist at the end. This movie did none of those things.",1518825600,,2666,4.55625

The movie trains an eye on what happens when the wife's self-important bubble is burst, and how, thereby, she learns more about her husband in a week than she did over 45 years of marriage.",1517788800,,535,4.515463917525773
7316564,5,B010TIZC2S,"A friend, young-at-heart, who has yet to wed and remains undecided, recommended the watching of this small forgotten movie, starring Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay.  A portrait of perhaps a mundane marriage where a childless British couple, enjoying the serenity of the rural countryside with their dog for company, surrounded by family and friends in the neighboring town, presents the viewer with an invitation to watch the preparations for the celebration of their 45 years together.

The onset of this story is a day in the week in the lives of Kate and Geoff Mercer, leading up to this festive event, where all is moving on clock-work schedule.  Kate takes Max, their German retriever, for a daily brisk walk in the early morning under overcast skies for a breath of fresh air, meets the mail carrier on her return, where simple pleasantries are exchanged, and finds her husband at their breakfast table, reading a letter.  Geoff is frail, having suffered a heart attack five years before, and he looks slightly stunned.  Compassionate and caring as always, she listens to what he has to say, not quite understanding this new revelation of his, but she remains concerned.

Soon afterwards, Geoff has returned to the Past in search of a lost love in his youth, and Kate carries on with the Now, and a growing sense of foreboding.  She tries to bring him back to the time they are living, but timing is not on their side, and she decides to follow his footsteps on this lost icy expedition, to better see through his haunted eyes, the lingering of an old ghost, now discovered in the Swiss mountains at peace, in human form, and forever young.

What Kate finds in the attic of their house, in the midst of dusty documents and photos, is far more hurtful and serious than expected, and the cause of her making an unconscious decision: a choice of her own, one that becomes stronger by the week and is exposed at the end of this story.

Brilliant and powerful is '45 Years' with Charlotte Rampling, as Kate in the lead, leaving one hoping that this turn of events is a rare experience in long unions between a couple.  If one has been a witness to a similar marriage, engendering memories of a long matrimonial journey with hidden secrets and revelations, it might be of solace to carry on, remembering the quote of a young artist, 'Alas, is not a Place where I Live' and yet, when tears of shame and remorse are shed at the end of this celebration, sometimes one has run out of time, while dancing to this old song...

'They ask me how I knew
My true love was true
I of course replied
Something here inside
Cannot be denied
They said someday you'll find
All who love are blind
When your heart's on fire
You must realize
Smoke gets in your eyes
So I chaffed them and I gaily laughed
To think they could doubt my love
Yet today my love has flown away
I am without my love
Now laughing friends deride
Tears I cannot hide
So I smile and say
When a lovely flame dies
Smoke gets in your eyes'.",1517788800,2,2995,4.538033395176252

7316566,3,B010TIZC2S,"Climate Change

45 Years takes place in the week leading up to the anniversary party of Geoff and Kate, who have been married, wait for it, for forty-five years!

We see their routine. Kate gets up early and takes their enormous dog for a walk. A few moments of suspense emerge as she walks along calling the dog and all you hear is his bark.

Did something happen to him? No? They return, no worse for wear.

Kate's husband, Geoff, is retired and a heart patient. He putters around the house, attempting to fix things. He cuts himself. Kate puts a band aid on his finger.

Their fortieth wedding anniversary party had to be canceled due to his having heart surgery. The movie shows the effects of another trauma to his heart.

Kate toys with buying Geoff a watch as a gift. She does not buy him a gift. He buys her an inexpensive looking pendant. She seems pleased with it.

How he and Kate ever got together is hard to understand. Although Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay both do a credible job with minimal action and dialogue, they seem to be in two different movies.

After dinner, they read. Kate, a retired school teacher, reads a lot. Geoff, who speaks simple English with a regional accent, is struggling to get through an edition of Kierkegaard. Seriously? One of three editions he has bought. We are told this by Kate, who treats her husband like a dim child.
For those of you who haven't read any Kierkegaard, you should. He can be very funny.

Oh, yes. Climate change. Geoff gets interested in climate change because a former love, Katya, who fell into a crevice in a glacier (I love the way Tom Courtenay pronounces ""glacier"")  has been found. Due to climate change, the snow covering her frozen body has melted, revealing her perfectly preserved, but alas, dead youth and beauty. It is implied but not stated that Katya was pregnant. Geoff's friends comment that his mood is different. As though his climate has changed too.

I don't think Kate really cares about Katya. I think she sees the anniversary party as an achievement but one that points out the fact that her life with Geoff will end soon. He may be a trophy of her endurance, but he is wearing out.",1517616000,,2180,4.549872122762149

7316582,4,B010TIZC2S,"45 Years is about the Mercers, an English couple about to celebrate their wedding anniversary. Kate (Charlotte Rampling) and Geoff (Tom Courtenay) have been living a childless, peaceful life in the country when Geoff receives news involving a former lover named Katya, who died in a mountain accident years before Geoff met Kate. Her body has been recovered.

Once, long ago, he was in love with Katya. Geoff insists he regards his former lover as little more than a memory, but Kate looks upon the memory of Katya as a threat to the couples life of contentment, calling into question everything she thought she knew about him. As the week goes on, something is off and Kate starts searching through boxes in the attic, trying to comprehend what this woman meant to her husband for so many years. Shes consumed with the feeling that their life together possibly came about by a twist of fate.

45 Years is an unsentimental look at an apparently happy marriage that  turns into a series of doubts. Writer-director Andrew Haigh approaches his subject with realism that ranges from the mundane day-to-day life of an aging Norfolk couple to the melodrama caused by an unexpected contact from the distant past. He shows how the unremarkable, though comfortable status quo is upset, initiating concerns and raising questions.

Ms. Rampling, who was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award for 45 Years, is the anchor of the film and turns in a completely convincing portrait of a woman struggling with a new, disturbing reality. Its rare these days to find such a substantial role for actresses of a certain age. Usually they are relegated to roles as grandmothers or reduced to supporting characters, but Ramplings Kate is one of most interesting movie characters of the last few years. She conveys a great deal through facial expression and body language, which stand in for dialogue. When she does speak, its in measured manner, as if choosing her words carefully so as not to give the wrong impression, alienate Geoff, or reveal her true concern.

7316585,1,B010TIZC2S,"45 Years is one of those movies that's great in concept, that has a whole lot of potential to be very interesting and engaging, but unfortunately, the concept alone isn't enough. For a movie that runs only an hour and a half, it felt like one of the longest movies you'd ever see. There was no plot to this movie. There's a twist, but then that twist goes nowhere. I also couldn't find it realistic and believable that an older woman would feel so threatened by her husband's past relationship, a relationship that was BEFORE they even got together, by a woman who is dead, for crying out loud. There didn't seem to be much of a problem in their relationship to begin with, so...why so much drama over this incident? The woman is gone, the past is the past, why it should so affect this couple's present was never made clear. If it was exciting and kept the plot moving, that would be one thing, but what a drag this movie was. When I watched this movie the first time, I slept through it. For that to happen with me, that means that the movie is really, truly boring. But I gave it another shot the next day. I forced myself to stay awake that time, and was left just...as bored as the first time, if not even more bored, because I watched it from start to finish. The acting is alright, that's all positive that can be said about this movie. But otherwise, this was just a bore, there is no plot here, nothing ever happens, and the premise of it all is just pretty silly honestly.

My wife and I watched this movie on cable and came to the same conclusion, the ending killed this movie.
Like a roach in your dessert after a decent meal, you are not going to be thinking about the meal, just the roach.

The story line is about a week in the life of a retired British couple approaching their 45th wedding anniversary, when the husband receives a letter from Switzerland telling him that a woman who was listed as his wife has been found perfectly preserved in ice after more than 45 years. The wife inquires about the girl and he confesses they travelled to Switzerland and pretended to be married to be able to rent rooms together. During a hike to a glacier the girl fell into a cravass in the ice and died. Now due to warming of the glacier, her body has been discovered perfectly preserved in a block of ice in the mountain.

The wife pushes on with her questioning and the husband admits this woman was the great love of his life and he would have married her had she not died. He says, though, he won't go to Switzerland to identify the body as he is not fit enough to climb the mountain.  Later in the week she finds out he inquired at a travel agency regarding a trip to Switzerland. When confronted, he says again he is not fit enough to make the trip.

As their week continues you start to see the husband as an eccentric and closed off sort of person. The wife mentions it would have been nice to have kids and grandkids. It's not mentioned if this was his choice or hers, or a matter of infertility. Also she says they don't have any pictures of themselves for their anniversary party. Once again it's not clear whose choice this was.

As the husband seems more and more disturbed by the news the wife goes into the attic and retrieves slides taken on the husband's trip to Switzerland before they met, and realizes the girl was pregnant when she died.  She doesn't discuss the girl's pregnancy with him, instead she stays focused on their anniversary party and putting on a good face for all their friends.

At the party, the husband makes a tearful toast in which he declares his love and devotion to his wife. Then the band plays their wedding song, ""Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"" by the Platters, and they get up to dance. The husband seems happy, singing along as they dance, but the wife looks like she has been struck with an axe handle. She seems to realize this song about the flame of love dying, which he selected for their wedding song was really about his lost love. She seems to realize her whole 45 year marriage was a sham, she was just a rebound choice after the great love of his life and their unborn child died. She seems to realize why there are no pictures of them, why there were no children or grandchildren, and how this man deceived her for 45 years. That's how the movie ends.",1476316800,6,2934,4.36080586080586

Then- the dog was rescued from the Wehrmacht? Yeh- throw a little symbolism in.  Sex scene particularly sad. Ugh.
In my version- in the middle scenes of him going to the iceberg- he had pushed his young bride in horror of child birth- there are overtownes of Nazi Germany- glacier on the Eiger, etc.- woman encased in ice reminds of scene in ""The Thing"" when monster is discovered- then finish the movie out w menacing undetones as Charlotte discovers the horror of it all- like Capt. Kurtz in Conrad- ""the horror, the horror"".

He becomes obsessed with seeing the body and this quickly destabilizes his marriage. Kate does some digging and unearths an old terrible secret he's kept from her, one which could upend her entire life. She sticks with it, not wanting to disappoint all the party goers, but this is now a ship taking on water. Rampling is magnificent; Courtenay's character though is a bit wimpy and whiny and you wonder why they would be attracted to each other.

7316625,4,B010TIZC2S,"Details have been given by others , so I won't repeat them. I will say, however, that the acting by Charlotte Rampling is excellent. She portrays a thoughtful older woman (Kate) who is brought down by a secret her husband had hidden for decades. Kate is up against a wall as she competes for what she believes to be her longtime husband's affection for a ghost. By the end of the movie there is still so much running through Kate's mind, as expressed on her face, that the viewer knows the struggle will not be neatly tied up in a pretty package and laid on the gift table at the anniversary party.

The story is slow but representative of the quiet lives the couple has led to this point--and, sorry to say, I had guessed at what the biggest part of the secret was. But this is not a mystery. Rather it's a portrait of a marriage that may not have even existed had Katya, Kate's husband Geoff's girlfriend of 50 years ago, survived.

Tom Courtenay's character, Geoff, did not appeal to me, but it's not Courtenay who carries this movie. The movie is all about the emotions running across Rampling's face. They range from subtle to strong, and there is not a single one wasted.",1473379200,7,1177,4.444444444444445

7316648,3,B010TIZC2S,"I was looking forward to watching this film and was left somewhat disappointed. I like the English films that move slowly and reveal themselves in layered nuances with subtle hints. This film had a slow buildup and the viewer was offered a small peak here and there yet was given an ending that wasn't definitive. Was she upset? Being sarcastic? Headed for divorce court? The plot was confusing and relied entirely too much on Rampling's expressions and perceived moods that at times were repetitive and not entirely clear. However she was wonderful to watch and is a great reminder -as is her costar- that talent, regardless of age is a joy to watch esp when the script is well written.

Spoiler: By the end of the film I'd lost sympathy for Kate Mercer and guessed that she was more upset or discontented with herself than her husband's renewed interest in a former deceased gf. The gf suffered an untimely death and his interest was reignited by the recent discovery of her body many years later, have a heart Mrs Mercer! Perhaps she was not happy with her decision to marry and forgo kids with Mr Mercer, the sacrifice at the end of the day wasn't worth it and her anger had finally found its release.

Thoroughly enjoyed Courtenay's performance as Geoff Mercer, he was fun to watch and rather funny when cantankerous esp good was the scene after his company reunion where he let it rip about his former work mates.

Perhaps it's a film that needs to viewed several times in order to absorb more fully. Perplexing was Kate's level of fury that didn't seem to match Geoff's crime of reflection on a former gf who had died a tragic death.",1471651200,,1640,4.609589041095891

7316655,5,B010TIZC2S,"I just finished watching this film, and also, read some reviews. To the people who felt bored by this story, I will just say that maybe you were not in the mood for such a raw experience, or you need different stimulation.  For me, it was so obvious what destructed Kate, and her look-back on marriage to Geoff.  It's one thing to know your spouse had other relationships before you, but there were several things she could not ignore, and one I'm especially sad about.  The fact that Katya's death, and pregnancy, may have been the reason Geoff did not want children (with anyone else), although the couple never speaks about why they didn't, hits you right between the eyes!  Also, their discussion of photo's, and why they never took many of each other, comes around in the story both when Kate is clicking through numerous photo's Geoff took of Katya, and when they step into the ballroom, and Kate sees the photo montage her friend has put together.  Wow.  Just wow.  Maybe to some viewers, Kate overreacted to the girlfriend.  But I think she simply felt second-best, and within a few short days, she was reeling with questions, hurt, regret, and a terrifying feeling that she made the wrong choice.  Only she had so many years invested--almost, how could that be?  The final scene really does say it all.  The look on her face on that dance floor...",1471046400,16,1356,4.631799163179917

I would have given it 3.5 stars if allowed 1/2 points but it is what it is.  I found it a bit hard to believe that the the husband could have kept so many secrets in the ""attic"" for so may years without his wife finding them.  It certainly is not a reality that I could expect in my 35 years of marriage.  I did think that the acting was quite good with Charlotte Rampling really carrying the script.

However low key this film might be, the thrill is in Charlotte Rampling's incredible performance. And the performance is not incredible because of extreme emotional outbursts but because of extreme emotions writhing within - realizations and reactions that build toward a cathartic moment that is shortly to be undone by a final, painful epiphany.

7316688,5,B010TIZC2S,"Geoff and Kate Mercer are about to have a gala party in honor of their forty-fifth wedding anniversary. ""45 Years,"" directed and adapted by Andrew Haigh from David Constantine's short story, ""In Another Country,"" is a subtle character study that relies on facial expressions and body language as much as it does on dialogue.  Kate and Geoff live in a comfortable home in the English countryside.  They shop, take walks, dine out, read, and have intimate chats before going to bed at night.

Everything changes when Geoff receives a letter concerning Katya, his German girlfriend who died in a tragic accident in 1962. Although he claims otherwise, it is not clear that Geoff has been entirely truthful about his long-ago affair with Katya.  After receiving the letter, Geoff grows moody, talks incessantly about his lost love, rummages through his memorabilia in the attic, and is so unsettled that he decides to take up smoking again.  Although Kate has no reason to be jealous of a woman who died before she met Geoff, she is not pleased that her husband is obsessed with a ghost.

Haigh elicits magnificent performances from Tom Courtenay and Charlotte Rampling.  Geoff is out of shape, a bit doddering and forgetful, and prone to temperamental outbursts.  Kate, who is attractive, dignified, and levelheaded, continues to behave normally in public, but she is seething inside.  With the upcoming celebration just days away, she is determined to conceal the fissures in her marriage. This is a thought-provoking, nuanced, and beautifully shot motion picture about secrets, hidden emotions, painful memories, and regrets.",1468972800,,1623,5.16412213740458

You literally follow this retired couple through a few days in their lives as they do their ordinary chores, etc. At 45 years, the woman, beautifully portrayed by Charlotte Rampling, finds out that she's been settling for a life that ultimately hasn't really made her happy. She seems to be saying ""Is that all there is?"" after 45 years of marriage? Tom Courtenay, as the husband, has worked all his life at a job and finds that it really wasn't very satisfying afterall. You know they are wondering if they should have taken different paths. They look at other seemingly happier couples and make comparisons. This is all done through looks and actions and bits of conversation. There's a back story to their life, but I don't want to spoil it for other viewers.

After being married 45 years, it shows how one lie, one omission, can effect a lifetime of decisions.
Some viewers think Kate overreacted and so what if she didn't know about Katya and an earlier relationship. They seemed to miss (or maybe didn't care) that many of the decisions in their marriage, some small, some large (like children) came from that relationship, but Kate wasn't privy to it.
If she knew how her husband's thought process was developed in those decisions maybe it would have been different. I personally think not having children was what upset her the most. The scene in the attic when she is watching the slides, said volumes.
I thought, how did she not see all this before, but I suppose I am more curious than she was .

8723172,2,B010TIZC2S,I can't believe this movie was rated so high,1524268800,,44,4.0
8723173,3,B010TIZC2S,"I'm the same age as these two characters, and expected to relate to them. Unfortunately, I
wanted to slap Charlotte Rampling's character in the face and shout ""Get over it! This all
happened five years before you were even married!"" Very well acted and directed, but I just
didn't buy the plot.",1523145600,,294,4.673076923076923
8723174,1,B010TIZC2S,"Prepare to age 45 years as you wait for this story to take flight. Though there are two reasons to watch: Max the German Shepherd achieves a totally convincing portrayal as a, well, German Shepherd. The other reason is to marvel that Charlotte Rampling's perfectly proportioned figure still remains, despite the years.",1521763200,,318,5.134615384615385
8723175,4,B010TIZC2S,"This is a very touching portrait of a long marriage. The dailiness of it felt very intimate, and the characters of Kate and Geoff were beautifully drawn. The only thing that bothered me about the movie was a purely personal reaction: that Kate doubted for a moment that she wasn't loved.",1521676800,,287,4.647058823529412
8723176,2,B010TIZC2S,"I get what they were trying to do in this movie, but they were attempting to accomplish this through simply through watching the actors' strained and desperate faces. I feel the story should have been fleshed out a bit more to show us what exactly the wife was thinking during some moments. Was she looking back on their own marriage thinking special occasions and intimate moments are now different in this new context? Some flashbacks of their own marriage where something that was only a slight aberration is now something always present in every moment they shared together. Just a thought. Without that you just have a boring movie where the audience doesn't understand how the wife could be jealous of a dead woman.",1521590400,,721,4.82258064516129
8723177,3,B010TIZC2S,If it wasn't for Charlotte's beauty.....,1520899200,,40,5.833333333333333
8723178,4,B010TIZC2S,Thought-provoking and somewhat heartbreaking. But I think you have to be married a certain number of years to understand and relate to what this couple is experiencing during the week before their 45th anniversary party. The ending is a bit abrupt and leaves you wondering about this couple's relationship going forward. Terrific acting -- especially by Charlotte Rampling.,1520640000,,373,5.448275862068965
