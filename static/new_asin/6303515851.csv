7849808,4,6303515851,"Railroadin' was the second talking film for the Little Rascals. Due to this, it tends to drag along. Some of the dialogue is hard to distinguish because of the primitive technology. Thankfully, the short is based on a successful silent film, so the story isn't awful. The kids are playing in a railroad yard when the train their own starts moving and they do not know how to stop it. The jokes have been done before, but many of them are still funny.

Roamin' Holiday is really a great short starring the later gang. Spanky, Alfalfa, Porky, and Buckwheat decide to run away from home when their mothers plan to make them take dancing lessons. They begin begging for food from an elderly couple who hears why the boys are alone and plan to teach them a lesson. Buckwheat is the best part of this short with his baby-talk and exaggerated expressions.

Three Men in a Tub is a cute short with a standard story: Alfalfa is vying for Darla's love. However, she is enamored with Waldo who has a yaght. The gang decides to make one to compete with Waldo in a race for Darla's affections. She does a good job at playing a fickle woman and the short is snappy.

Cat, Dog and Co. is one of the later silent films. It stars Wheezer and the rest of the gang who have learned not to be mean to animals because they have souls too. This short utilizes several high tech devices for Wheezer's dream sequence where he imagines he is on trial for all the cruel things he has done to animals. It is a cute film, proof of the reason that the silents could be just as good as the talkies.",1148428800,2,1568,4.326530612244898
