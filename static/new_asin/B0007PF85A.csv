8050254,3,B0007PF85A,"In 1964-65, the Three Stooges of the COLUMBIA feature film era, Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Joe De Rita, shot dozens of live wraparounds and voiced dozens of CAMBRIA co. cartoons.

This low budget GENIUS ENTERTAINMENT collection offers nine of these shorts that have long been in the public domain. On every set I've ever seen, the live-actor segments are badly degraded with washed-out colors.

Even though the manufacturer claims these are ""full-length episodes,"" there's no guarantee you'll get anything more than the animations, so caveat emptor.

8050255,4,B0007PF85A,"This DVD contains three episodes:

1. Disorder in the Court -- the stooges are called as witnesses in the court, to testify regarding the murder of a man in a club in which they were performing as musicians. Not one of their best.

2. Brideless Groom -- Shemp appears in this one. He has to marry a girl within 4 hours in order to inherit half a million dollars. Tries madly to find one, and then a big goofy fight ensues. A little better than the first episode.

3. Malice in the Palace -- The best of the bunch. A classic episode, featuring diamond thieves, cooking mishaps, and such. As goofy as the rest, but a little more clever--classic Stooges.

The recording quality is good. Digiview seems to make decent DVDs for cheap. Sometimes they take out the original music, however. Watch out for that with them.",1108771200,,812,4.503401360544218
