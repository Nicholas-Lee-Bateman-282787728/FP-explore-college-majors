8135262,3,B000GYI3G8,"I guess I missed the point.  I agree the cinematography was well shot in all its diversity.  The acting is solid and believable.  And the film is realistic.

But in the end it seemed to me to be filled with colorfully filmed random acts of violence interpersed with a rant-filled commentary by a radio DJ about the insanity of it all.  Nothing profound or earth shattering, just pointing out the obvious.

Life is violent.  Death comes to all.  Don't know where, when or how.  There ya' go.  Just imagine this message played out for about two hours in the sunshine of L.A.

Guess I missed the hope and inspiration part because after watching this for two hours what lingered was not a greater appreciation for life, as some reviewers seem to have found, but two hours I could have spent actually doing or reading or viewing something inspiring or hopeful.

If I wanted a film about ultra-violence I'd watch A Clockwork Orange again.",1234569600,,932,4.6503067484662575
8135263,5,B000GYI3G8,"Shortly after a fire in his home, radio host David Allen (played remarkably well by Kent Harper) goes on the air. He is clearly emotionally distraught and engages in a monologue lamenting the state of the world. The title refers, in part, to some of his subject: the number of murders every day, the number of rapes, burglaries, and so forth. Meanwhile, we have glimpses into the lives of others, including a woman whose husband is dying from smoke inhalation, a pair of young men intent on making a zombie film, a young man who thinks he and his ex-girlfriend might be reuniting, a pair of police officers, and a few others. At times, their lives intersect or overlap, sometimes tragically.

""Statistics"" is, in some ways, reminiscent of Robert Altman's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Short-Cuts/dp/B001CW7ZT4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Short Cuts</a>. For my money, this is the better film.

There is, I suppose, the claim that ""Statistics"" is in many ways a naive film. Of course people die, and of course bad things happen. But I don't think the point of the film is to lament violence, murder, et al. The point, I think, is to show the effects they can have and to suggest that we really are connected--not, perhaps, the most original of theses, but the manner in which the characters pull it off, the taut direction and editing, and the solid script make this film a small masterpiece.",1231977600,,1435,5.128205128205129
8135264,4,B000GYI3G8,"Over the past 3 years I have attended Sundance 3 times, Silverlake Film Festival once and Downtown LA Film festival.  Of all the movies that I have seen, this is my favorite.  I'm so glad that it is being released on DVD so that my friends and family can finally see the film that I have been raving about for the past year.

This movie is brilliantly written, acted and directed.  Kent Harper is mesmerizing.  His portrayal of talk show host David Allen is reminiscent of a Denver talk show host from the 80's, Allen Berg, who interestingly enough became a statistic when he was killed by a hate group.

This movie is powerful and thought provoking.  Please don't miss the chance to see this movie.",1219881600,3,699,4.5
8135265,4,B000GYI3G8,"Frank and Scott put together a truly wonderful debut film.  I saw a preview and loved it.  Very true to life.  Passionate performances by all of the actors.  Definitely worth checking out.  Watch out for Frank and Scott; they're going places!

8135266,5,B000GYI3G8,"If you are having problems learning Statistics, buy this DVD! The instructor is awesome (despite the New York accent). He starts with the basics and teaches you what you need to know on a chalkboard. Each of the lessons have several practice questions that you can work on. The instructor will go over all of the answers to the practice questions (step by step) and he provides good explanations. This is way better than reading a dry textbook. The best part of this DVD is the section on hypothesis testing. Goodluck.",1203811200,4,518,4.7032967032967035
