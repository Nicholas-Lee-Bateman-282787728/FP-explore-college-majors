8440058,4,B004SOMI90,"A semi experimental film that recalls Chantal Akermans portraits of places, but here a narrative has been added on top.  An unseen geologist is telling the story (writing in a diary?) of his trip to look for a place to build a canal in northern Brazil.  But as he goes along he is haunted by thoughts  his love waiting back home  his desire to get back to her, and his desire to flee.

We see the only super 8 films and videos he takes as he goes along, revealing landscapes, rocks, human faces and bodies.  Theres a gentle poetic sadness to it all that keeps a consistent, quiet, but never dull mood.  Very approachable as experimental films go, it captures feelings many of us have had while traveling for work  the wonderful freedom, the terrible loneliness.

Sadly, the DVD has no English subtitles, and I've never been able to find one that does.  But there is a subscription website called fandoe.com that has the film for streaming in decent quality with English subs",1390521600,3,974,4.578034682080925
