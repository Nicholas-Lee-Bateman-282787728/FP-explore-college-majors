257867,5,6300216586,"For the first time ever in his career making movies, Hall Bartlett knew exactly what he was doing. He was adapting a best-selling novella by Richard Bach about a prophetic seagull, and he was going to turn it into a major motion picture. It was going to be an independently-financed film with as little studio interference as possible. And by the end of the ten-month shooting schedule, Bartlett had mortgaged his home and invested every last one of his savings into the films $1.5 million budget; he was willing to do anything to make his dream project a reality. I was born to make this movie, he declared. He was absolutely right.

Hall Bartlett (1923-1993) was one of Hollywoods most underrated writer/directors. He wrote and directed ten feature films: Unchained (1955), Drango (1957), Zero Hour! (1957), All the Young Men (1960), The Caretakers (1963), Changes (1969), The Sandpit Generals (1971), The Children of Sanchez (1978) and Love is Forever (1983). Some of his films were bland studio projects, while the others had intriguing concepts but were often unsatisfyingly executed. In his entire 30-year filmmaking career, Bartlett helmed a series of flops, misfires, close calls, small gems, and at least one masterpiece: Jonathan Livingston Seagull (1973).

Richard Bachs enormously popular 1970 book had first come to Bartletts attention after his wife had presented it to him as a gift. The timing couldn't have been better; after the critical and commercial failure of his hospital drama The Caretakers in 1963, Bartlett had watched his career devolve. Ive been through about ten years of hell, he told an interviewer on the set, up until very, very recently, where everything went wrong. I couldn't make a right move. The fear was on me that I would never make a picture again then came a woman with such love to share, and then Jonathan, and suddenly everything was right.

Bartlett had hoped that, with Jonathan Livingston Seagull, he would finally get the attention he deserved. Nobody ever once realized that the film he was making was very, very ahead of its time.

The film was absolutely reviled when it came out. Reviews were terrible. The sort of garbage only a seagull could love, wrote Judith Crist. Interminable, said Art Murphy in Variety. Bird droppings! snorted Jay Cocks in Time magazine. Strictly for the birds, quipped Frank Rich in the New Times. And in a particularly negative 1-star review, Roger Ebert was perhaps the most scathing of all: This has got to be the biggest pseudocultural, would-be metaphysical ripoff of the year.

The reviews hurt the movies commercial chances significantly; at the box office, it grossed only $1.6 million, just short of the $2.1 million Paramount had spent to purchase the film from Bartletts studio. And five years later, Harry Medved and Randy Dreyfuss excessively panned it in their 1978 book The Fifty Worst Movies of All Time (a book which also trashed such titles as Sam Peckinpahs ""Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"" and Richard Donner's ""The Omen""). So drenched in vile cynicism was their review that Medved and Dreyfuss even mocked Bartlett for making his picture in the true auteur fashion, as if they considered themselves superior to a filmmaker who had spent all his savings on a personal project they had not even bothered to try to comprehend.

Jonathan Livingston Seagull is one of my all-time favorite American movies, and I hasten to say that because the horrid reception that this film received during its releaseand ever since thenhas angered me to no end over the years. There is no reason why this film should have flopped as it did. There is no reason why this film should have been dismissed as quickly as it was. As far as I can tell, nobody gave this movie a chance. Nobody was willing to appreciate Hall Bartletts directorial vision or take him seriously as a filmmaker. Not one review mentioned anything nice about the films story or technique. Everybody walked in with a closed mind, completely unwilling to embrace the movies unique perspective. Ebert proudly began his review by announcing that he walked out of the film some 45 minutes into it, but then ended his review by revealing that he had left during the sequence in which Jonathan had dragged himself, groggy and bleeding, onto some flotsam. Judging from the actual running time, it appears as though Ebert must have, in fact, walked out of the screening approximately 21 minutes into the film.

Then there were the lawsuits. Richard Bach sued Bartlett when Bartlett refused to honor Bach's right to final cut. Neil Diamond threatened to sue Bartlett if he didn't incorporate more of the music from the soundtrack into the film; Diamond was also upset when composer Lee Holdridge requested to share credit with Diamond over the music. Ovady Julber, the director of 1936s La Mer, sued over suspicions that Bartletts film might have plagiarized his work.

And toes were stepped on. Associate Producer Leslie Parrish had worked hard to hire the crew members and help take care of the real seagulls being used for the production (these seagulls were trained by Ray Berwick and Gary Gero, and stored in a room in a Holiday Inn), but in the end, Bartlett demoted Parrish's credit from Associate Producer to ""Researcher"".

In spite of the tension which occurred behind the scenes, Jonathan Livingston Seagull belongs right up there with Stanley Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) as one of the great surrealist films released in the later half of the 20th century. It is a rich, liberated celebration of a writer/directors artistic sensibilities, free of any constricting narrative rules. Like those aforementioned films, it expands even more in dimension with repeated viewings. What Hall Bartlett did with Jonathan Livingston Seagull is special: he recognized the visual opportunities in Bachs storya story that was always heavily cinematic to begin withthus allowing him to adapt it into a visually powerful cinematic experience that offers images quite like nothing ever produced before or since.

The film even has the audacity to open with the dedication that appeared on the first page of Bachs novella: To the real Jonathan Livingston Seagull, who lives within us all. These words appear as onscreen text that burst in bright blue hues alongside an opening shot of white clouds, enhanced with the help of the cinematography by helicopter photographer Jim Freeman and veteran cinematographer Jack Couffer (the latter of whom was hired after his impressive work on Walt Disneys True Life Adventure series). One is simply amazed by the sensational aesthetic effect of Bartletts film, from his explosive footage of crashing tidal waves to his unbelievable tracking shots of the films title characterwhether he be flying above the clouds, near the rocky shores or into the cores of deserts and snowy mountains. That Couffers cinematography netted the film one of two Academy Award nominations is not surprising in the least: it remains one of the finest examples of natural footage ever captured on celluloid.

Getting that footage was sometimes dangerous. Couffer was allegedly attacked by one of the seagulls during filming, prompting Bartlett to have his crew members wear baseball catchers masks in order to prevent further accidents. We get a good glimpse at just how vicious the seagulls were during filming in one of the movies first sequences, which provides us with a glimpse of seagull life. As a tugboat sits out in the middle of the ocean, dumping piles of fish into the water, hordes of seagulls begin fighting all at once for the rotten, filthy chum. In a sequence marvelously edited by Frank P. Keller and James Galloway (thus netting the film its second Oscar nomination), the seagulls bite, claw, gnash and bloody each others throats; if this continues, we fear, they may start decapitating each other. Its an ugly, hostile, disgusting existence, and thats why we sigh a breath of relief when we are suddenly whisked away into the skywhere we take the point of view of a figure bursting its way through the clouds. Then we see what it is: a lone seagull. An independent. Thats him. Thats Jonathan.

Jonathan is voiced by James Franciscus, that suave, handsome actor who starred in Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970) and in Dario Argentos The Cat o Nine Tails (1971). In his day, Franciscus was an irresistible ladies man, a Rod Serling look-a-like and a fitting Apes replacement for Charlton Heston. But Hall Bartlett must have recognized that there was something oddly appealing about Franciscus voice, a voice which sometimes tended to sound hoarse and monotone. That proved to be the perfect fit for the voice of Jonathan, who is quieter and more observant in the later scenes of Jonathan Livingston Seagull but who has a boyish squeal in his voice in the earlier scenesas he struggles to determine the secret to perfect speed. Jonathan's problem is that he too often lets his doubts control his destiny and, whats more, lets fear get in the way of his ambition. Maybe seagulls cant fly faster than 62 miles per hour, he considers. But wouldnt it be great if we could?

His parents are not pleased. Mother (Dorothy McGuire) fears for his safety: Im afraid for you. Im afraid of what you're doing. Father (Richard Crenna) is even less helpful: We were meant to live the way we liveaccept it! Take your place. Will you try, son? Yet Jonathan continues to be interrupted with inspired revelations. What if he were to dive, for example, on the wingtips only? This results in one of the films genuinely funniest moments, when Jonathan hits 170 at the short dive but then disastrously attempts to dive at 10,000 ft, loses control, spirals into oblivion and screams, OH GOD, THE FLOCK LOOK OUT!!!!! But then Bartlett segues into a scene that is not so funny, as Jonathan is forced to stand trial before the head Elder (Hal Halbrook), who is cruelly unforgiving to the young independent. Jonathan Livingston Seagull, the brotherhood is broken! the Elder roars. Never again will you see any of your Flock! Never again will you have the protection of your Flock! You are henceforth and forever outcast! Thrown out by the Flock, the Elders and even his own parents, Jonathan has gone from a social deviant to something that is even worse: a bastard.

This is where one of the directors key themes as a filmmaker comes into place. Bartlett loved to make films about illegitimate children disowned by their parents. Think of Janis Paiges speech in The Caretakers, in which she sobs about being taunted as a little bastard all her life. Or Anthony Quinns final monologue in The Children of Sanchez, in which he condemns all of his children as bastards during a spoiled picnic dinner. In contrast, Jonathan Livingston Seagull deals with the theme of illegitimacy more subtlety. Outcast is substituted for bastard,"" and yet the term is no less painful. The sequence in which Jonathan departs for his life of solitude, set to the tune of Diamonds Lonely Looking Sky,"" is quite simply one of the saddest sequences of the 1970s, and it is all the more tragic if we realize, in hindsight, that Jonathan will never see his parents again. He will die without them at his side.

Neil Diamond and Lee Holdridges score for the film has often been dismissed as overbearing, but Ive always begged to differ. Among the other songs used on the soundtrack, Be represents Jonathans independence, while Dear Father epitomizes his self-doubt and Skybird, his liberation. To me, the film's soundtrack remains exhilarating, and it is also a reminder of Hall Bartletts often-overlooked talent for juxtaposing the right kind of music with his cinematic stories.

Bartletts masterful filmmaking is demonstrated even further in the 13-minute sequence that follows, in which Jonathan attempts to know all there is to know of this life and embarks on a long stretch, midway through the film, that takes him all the way to the ends of the Earth and, finally, to his death. All Bartlett does here is follow Jonathan while he flies from one habitat to another, as he observes fellow animals and keeps to himself; in fact, in the last 13 minutes of his life, Jonathan never says a word. There is no doubt in my mind that Bartlett must have been influenced by Kubrick in crafting this sequence, for it invites startling comparison to the famous Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite sequence from 2001. Like Dave Bowman, Jonathan passes through scene after scene of enchanting realms before settling into his own demise and, then, being reborn as a kind of supernatural being. From that point on, the film folds onto itself like a Chinese box, and suddenly its a new kind of film altogether.

At the time, the film was suspected by some critics to be an allegory for Christs suffering and resurrection; Time magazine claimed that Bartlett had tarnished Bachs story with Billygrahmese dialogue. Were these critics not paying much attention during the film? Listen carefully to the conversations between Jonathan and his mentor, Chiang (Philip Ahn), particularly their discussions about the afterlife. When Jonathan asks Chiang if they are in Heaven, Chiang simply replies, Who said it was? Heaven isn't a place. Heavens perfection, wouldnt you think? And we don't go there, as much as we express it. Or consider Jonathans conversations with Maureen (Juliet Mills), who asks him, Didnt you say you know me from somewhere? I believe there were many somewheres! Her comment, of course, implies reincarnation. In retrospect, the film is about as Christian as the Star Wars films; interestingly enough, Richard Bachs mythology of perfect speed predates George Lucas Force mythology by about seven years. But a story like Jonathan Livingston Seagull has more in common with something like, say, Buddhism, than it does with Christianity.

Furthermore, Jonathan, unlike Christ, does not fully understand the meaning of love. Chiangs parting words to Jonathan are literally, keep working on love. A truly allegorical Christian figure would have no need for this kind of advice. Jonathans romance with Maureen is also one of the more significant changes which Bartlett makes from Bachs novella. In the book, Jonathan is accompanied by a best friend, Sullivan, wholike one of Christs disciplesdoubts his masters success in the face of danger. By inventing the character of Maureen, however, Bartlett makes Jonathan more ""human,"" shall we say, not to mention more likely to give into temptations of the flesh. A case might be made that Maureen is supposed to represent Mary Magdalene, but surely the relationship between Jonathan and Maureen is far warmer than the relationship which Christ and Magdalene ever might have had together. And as Jonathan embarks on a journey to free his old flock, Maureens last words to him (Jonathan, go with my love) resonate beautifully without carrying a religious context of any kind. My guess is that Bartlett sensed audiences would warm up to the story somewhat more if he were to give the hero a love interest.

The films most obvious rejection of blind Christian ideals, however, occurs after Jonathan and his new apprentice, Fletcher Lynd Seagull (David Ladd), try to win over the cynicism of the Flock and are, instead, nearly swallowed alive by their outrage. To be sure, it is not an unexpected reaction: practically everybody in the movie assumes Jonathan is either a heavenly or a hellish force of nature. Fletcher believes he might be a Christ figure. The Flock's Elders believe hes the Devil. Jonathan dismisses all of these theories. In one scene, he chuckles over the rumor that hes oh, yes, yes, I know: the only Son of the Great Gull, I suppose. And the final request he makes of his apprentice is modest, indeed: Dont let them spread silly rumors about me or try to make me some sort of a god, will you, Fletcher? Clearly, Jonathan considers himself to be just like every other seagull, just as Richard Bach believes there is a Jonathan who lives within us all.

And so, for that matter, did Hall Bartlett. He believed enough in this story to pour his heart and soul into it, confidant every step of the way that he was on the verge of completing an important film. Jonathan Livingston Seagull was not embraced by critics or audiences, but I have a feeling that Bartlett himself always knew, deep down, that he had left the public with a masterpiece. Maybe he knew that he wouldnt live to see the film get the attention it deserved. Maybe he was aware that the films mediocre reception would outlive him. After this film, he would only go on to make two films, The Children of Sanchez and Love is Forever. Neither was particularly impressive.

But I wish he were alive to know how much I love this film. I wish he knew how much it has changed the way I look at movies. And I wish he knew how much I cherish the way he ends the picture with Jonathans immortal closing monologue: Look with your understanding. Find out what you already know. Use it, Fletcher. Teach it show it forth. And youll know the way to fly.",1485561600,15,17085,4.917128987517337

In today's landscape this film could easily get made as a Discovery Channel special, but in 1973 it took some real courage to produce a film with little dialogue, about a rebel seagull outcast from his flock because of his non-conformist desire to be more. It's a 95 minute music video, which is about 75 minutes more than it takes to read the book. And what a video it is.

Neil Diamond's beautiful and haunting score dominates the film, setting the mysterious and relaxing mood while it poignantly reveals Jonathan's thoughts, moods, and life. Sewn to the fabric of the stunning visuals, you could cry just watching a bird fly. Literally.

If you've been a fan of Diamond's soundtrack but never see the film, it will captivate you and make you wonder why you never bothered to see it before.

Right after the opening credits, it begins with the dedication ""To the real Jonathan Livingston Seagull who lives within us all"".  Yes, Richard Bach says it best.  The cinematography and scenery are superb, from the beginning with the crashing waves, and so it keeps going.  Then of course we learn how uplifting and inspirational the story is.  Also very touching.  Because of the inspirational and spiritual qualities, it really is wonderful not only for kids, but everyone--- ""the real Jonathan Livingston Seagull who lives within us all"".

I believe that the story applies to everyone about everything in each one's life.  Jonathan wants to fly the fastest, with no limits.  In reality, each person wants to be the BEST at whatever is most important.  Whether it's flying, golfing, swimming, tennis, painting, surfing, baseball-- you want to EXCELL in your own.  It's a different thing for each one of us.  And for your own, BE the BEST you can!  --George Skoblin",1344902400,,1034,5.011764705882353

258139,1,6300216586,"I, limited being that I am, cannot fathom what possessed anyone to actually make this film. The book is barely over 100 pages, and there is hardly a plot. Most of the book is given to saccharine preaching, and was more of a religious tract than a book.

I supposed, then, that the movie might be better. After all, for a movie to be watchable, there must be some semblance of a plot. Alas, I find this film even worse than the book, for no other reason that the film wasted an hour and a half of my life, while the book wasted about twenty minutes.

 Like the book, it tells the story of Jonathan Seagull, who wants to fly better than anyone else. The movie has many, many problems. First and foremost: the plot. Or rather, the lack of plot. The first twenty minutes or so actually have a loose plot, but as soon as Jonathan is kicked out of his flock, it disappears in favour of preaching, pretty birds flying, and, perhaps worst of all, Neil Diamond.

 I will admit that the scenery was gorgeous, but it's hard to enjoy that as the worst music Neil Diamond has ever written blares obnoxiously in the background.  Worse than, it includes some of the worst voice-over work ever seen in a movie. They don't attempt to make the birds look as if they are speaking, instead, they play a voice in the background and hope the audience will buy it. This audience isn't buying it.

 This might work, if the birds had anything interesting or insightful to say, but ninety percent of the dialogue is preaching. Not only does it make for a boring movie, it's also rather insulting. No matter how free and perfect you believe yourself to be, everyone has limitations. It's part of being human.  Moreover, the preaching is about as subtle as a walrus that has painted itself bright green and is dancing on a harpsichord, singing ""The Subtle Song"".

 Perhaps even worse, it was painful to watch the birds be thrown around. In some cases, in the scene in which they were fighting over a garbage heap, I could swear I saw real blood. Even if this were a good film, it'd be disturbing to see these birds get hurt.

 This is a mind-blowingly bad movie, which has thankfully faded into obscurity.",1326153600,,2177,4.4534005037783375

I made the mistake of assuming that a video version of the book would be just as good. Far from it. In the book there's narration that makes the story much richer and this is all together missing from the DVDs. I'll share a line from the book

""Jonathan had discovered the joy of flying; the joy of learning and flourishing in new ideas and new information. The joy of seeking the truth fully and unabashedly. And when he tried to share this joy with the flock they banished him.""

Even set apart from the book this line carries emotion and  is a metaphorical microcosm of a risk that comes from branching out from the norms. In the video doesn't have have narration and is missing lines like this that made reading the book the experience that it was. The primary voice you hear throughout the movie is that of Johnathan thinking to himself in what sounds like comments one makes under their breath. Almost all of his dialogue could be condensed to ""it would be nice if I could"" and ""I think I can.""

The movie appears to have been made in the 70s, and I just don't like the style in which it was done and the acoustics of the recording. So I would advise others away from this watered down rendition of the story but highly encourage the reading of the book.",1306972800,,1508,4.948616600790514

The music is another great problem... it's so corny I had to turn the volume down several times.

It wasn't very faithful to the book, and several scenes were just made up, while beautiful lines from the book were left out.

But my great problem with this film is how they made it... there was no CGI at the time, so they really hurt and killed seagulls to get the scenes done. I really couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it. How can they take a book with a deeply spiritual message and harm so many animals to make a movie?

Even as a young child I could relate to the plot & theme of ""JLS"" better than any adult I knew at the time.  As an adult who just turned 48 years old yesterday, I find Bach's story of flight more metaphorical & rewarding than ever.  Something about nearing the 1/2-century mark on my personal calendar that just makes me crave insight, wisdom...Meaning.  What better metaphor than flight to conjure notions of ascension, self-actualization, grace, transcendence & fulfillment?  The stale arguments over whether Jonathan is symbolically 'Jesus', or 'Socrates', or 'Buddha'; whether the story's philosophy is 'Eastern' or 'Western'...All just seem irrelevant to me.  Who cares?  Truth is where you find it.  Jonathan himself said, ""I'm a Seagull.  I like to fly.""  The story is unfortunately relegated to the margins of 2011 society, where it seems that all anyone cares about these days is sports, politics, celebrity dirty laundry, gossip, 'Health-Care', 'The Economy', computer games & just about anything else non-spiritual they can think of.  No one looks outward or upward anymore.  Speaking of computer games, did you knowtice that ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" was released in the early 1970s, & is therefore all analog?  There was no Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI) back then.  All of ""JLS""'s SFX were real, old-fashioned physical magic, not developed on a laptop.  To me, that fact alone makes this film refreshing to watch.  How did the film-makers get all of those Seagulls to act?  I just love that.  Of course today's movie-going audience would NEVER sit through a film this slow, peaceful & contemplative.  If a movie doesn't constantly change scenes every few seconds & bombard the viewers with ever-escalating fake explosions, blood, & unrealistic motion, people will walk out.  So much more the treasure in ""JLS"".  Beautiful scenery & music, real animals, authentic motion, & FLIGHT!  In spite of the body of negative opinion I witness in other people's reviews of this film (that it's unrealistic, syrupy, uninspiring, dated, blasphemous, etc), it will remain one of my all-time favorites for all of the reasons I list here, & more.

It sounds worse than AM radio and is not in stereo. While the film may not have been issued in stereo at the time, Paramount has gone back to many of its films and used the original master tapes and remastered films in beautiful stereo sound. To skip doing that for Jonathan Livingston Seagull is just an abomination. The score is what makes the movie come alive, Neil Diamond at his prime, and to release the dvd with such poor quality mono sound is shameful.

The photography is beautiful and the scenes as mellow as you can find: a seagull gracefully gliding through the air surrounded by beautiful seascapes, sunsets, billowy clouds.....just magnificent scenery.  I'll never forget seeing this in the theater around 1973. It was impressive.

On the negative side is the usual New Age ""look within yourself"" theology. This is pure Secular Humanism. I say this because some people thought this was a Christian film and it is not. Author Richard Bach, from whose book this movie is based on, leaves no doubt near the end of the movie - or the screenwriters did, if they changed his book.

Well, the reviews are right.  The movie is stunning, the story is beautiful, the photography is spectacular, the Soundtrack great, and the sound... Well, the sound is what took two stars away from my review.

Paramount should be ashamed of letting such a wonderful movie, where the soundtrack is basically half of everything, being release with no work at all at the sound quality.  Zero, zero.  The sound is MONO, and looks like somebody took an old voice recorder into the movie theater hidden in his pocket and recorded the whole thing.

This is also a 1973 film.  No CGI seagulls here.  That does not hurt the film too much, but some of the complex flying scenes such as aerial acrobatics would look so much better if they had been redone with 2007 technology.

For fans of Neil Diamond, he makes many appearances in songs that are integral to the film.  The symphonic work he did is excellent.

That being said, this is one of the poorer conversions to DVD that I have seen (the worst being my ""Red Dawn"" DVD, but don't get me started). Colors are not vibrant, blacks are not that deep, and about the only positive thing I have to say about the video quality is that it has been cleaned up to remove artificts (unlike ""Red Dawn,"" grr). So, while the video is clean, it is nothing spectacular.

Audio has got to be the biggest disappointment; it has been remastered in Dolby Digital mono. That's right, mono. Not DTS, not 5.1, not even stereo, but mono. Adding insult to injury is the quality of the audio. Sure, there is no hiss or sound of scratches, but the audio is flat. Specifially, the music. Dialogue in the movie does not really need much, and it would have been better in stereo, and better yet in 5.1. But the music, one of the best components of the movie, is disappointing.

Thus music has no range, no depth, no life. My sub rarely kicked in. Neil Diamond's voice sounded muffled, as did the music itself. What should have been a great musical experience turned into a pale shadow of what might have been.

On top of all this, there are no extra features or frills. This is pretty much a straight burn of the video to DVD. The menu screen is a still pic with just three choices (play, audio setup, and scene selection). That's it.

Don't get me wrong, I still love the movie. I was disappointed years ago when I heard there were no plans to release JLS to DVD. This DVD is definitely better than a VHS alternative, so I am very glad Paramount released it to DVD. It is just disappointing that they did not spend some extra money to improve the video quality, and nearly a crime they did not remaster the audio better (and in 5.1).",1191888000,5,1973,4.321621621621621

I have since earned a degree in music and am familiar with music from all genres, but this remains a favorite, a constant. It's nice again to see how the music relates to the visual aspects of the film. This film isn't for everyone. People who like fast action, gunfights, car chases, and such will find this film boring. However, if you can accept it for what it is, it's a beautiful experience all around. I don't mind the talking birds--remember ""Babe,"" the talking pig? I like watching Jonathan working out his struggles in learning how to fly better, faster, higher and seeing him succeed. For me, it's a very uplifting movie. I only received it the other night, and I have already watched it five times. You might think of it too has an extended music video with all those gorgeous scenes--think wildlife, nature photography--together with the lush, mostly orchestral music. It's a different kind of movie. I know it has been ridiculed by many people for many reasons, but to some of us, it remains special.

I mean, yes, I knew there was this seagull and that there was some sort of simplistic life lesson to be learned here, but it was not until the seagull started talking about flying really fast that I remembered that was the catalyst for the title character's quest, exile, and ultimate redemption.  I also remembered that the message was not why I went to go see this movie when it came out in 1973.

I still think this is a beautiful film, which deservedly received an Oscar nomination for Jack Couffer's cinematography because basically this film was IMAX before IMAX was around.  The beginning is gorgeous and it takes you a moment to remember that you want to pay attention to the seagull and not the scenery.  This proves to be the fatal flaw in this film.  Because once we start focusing on the seagulls we focus on one in particular, and he has a story that has to be communicated through voiceovers.  I recognize the voice of Philip Ahn as Chang, because I watched ""Kung Fu"" when it was on, but I never would have guessed that was James Franciscus doing the voice of Jonathan.  The problem is that every time we get to the voice-overs in this movie, I start to get bored, even though I know the dialogue is necessary to advance the plot of the film (this sentiment is extend to Dimaond's work, where I like the music way more than the lyrics).  It is just that suddenly I seem to remember a joke about the book, namely that it was a best seller because there were more people than you would have thought who had never read ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Engine-That-Could/dp/0448405202/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Engine That Could</a>,"" and I have to wonder about people with so little in their lives that the book could have meant so much.

To be fair, the movie should not be confused with the book, if for no other reason that Bach sued Columbia over the changes they made to his story when they filmed it.  Then again, I have no idea what those changes might be or how the vision of the author has been corrupted by this adaptation.  There are no DVD extras and there are six--count them, six--scenes to select.  They are numbered (you guessed it) 1 through 6, and if you can look at the pictures above the numbers and figure out what part of the film it is, then you must really love this movie.  I was going to round up on this one, just because the cinematography is as gorgeous as I remember, but when I saw the film was divided into six numbered scenes, I had to head in the other direction.  This is one of those films that I have to think will interest only those people who saw it before and want to see it again, whether such an interest is restricted only to the beautiful photograph or to the whole ""message"" it has to offer.",1191542400,4,3353,5.005395683453237

  I also identified with his moods of discouragment ... due to all the voices of negativity from those who do not understand.  Finally, I identified with his ultimate victory  ... knowing that something is true (human potential beyond our ""normal"" everyday understanding) and maintaining that belief no matter what... until it is finally manifested and PROVEN to ourselves.

Now, my twelve-yr-old cat, Star, likes to look at the birds on the t.v. screen but is perplexed by their human voices.

The music was just great!  Neil Diamond was simply marvelous back then providing the music for this and the remake of THE JAZZ SINGER.  Both make me cry sometimes as they tug at the heart strings.  Killing me softly with his song!

Hal Holbrook was good as the voice of the mean one, the elder who banned Jon from the flock for daring to be different, and later did the same to poor Fletcher, because of his crippled wing.  When you get past the noise of the birds feeding on garbage, the story soars just as Jonathan Livingston Seagull at a fairly fast clip, on the wings of a prayer.  The narration is perfectly done: both Jon L. and the angel Seagull who comes to take him to a better place.

He returns the favor to Fletcher and teaches him that he can fly with the best of them.  The worst part was near the end of the movie when the baby bird is knocked into the rock cliff and dies.  That made me sad initially, but I can understand the significance now that I am older.  It's not easy being old, but it's much worse to die young.

Jonny will always be a bird after my heart.  As a result of this movie, I feed the pigeons here in town and the few birds who returned after last year's bad treatment.

Message - Brilliant.

This is a film about an anthropomorphic bird, a seagull who wants to break from the flock's set ways, tiring of the endless meaningless pursuit of mere survival. He wants to learn rather than blindly conform, would risk death in order to truly be alive.

This is an eternal story - the one who wants to understand becomes an outcast, and ultimately comes in contact with the real world. Is there an ethereal inner circle of humanity, guiding us all and helping the few that really need release from this circle of life and death? This story does not deny such a reality.

I was surprised at the depth of this movie, despite its cloying attempts to make us sympathize with the poor bird washed up on the raft of driftwood, freezing in the snow etc. The faux-innocence of Johnathan's dopey voice over makes me want to laugh, but I appreciate the idea and the difficult technical/creative work that went into making this unlikely feature film.

Interestingly 30 years ago SEAGULL ruffled some defensive feathers, challenging common notions of 'heaven' and 'faith' and our innate purpose. The 'mystical' is always a threat, reviled or ridiculed. Here in know-it-all 2005 people seem to think nothing of either faith or mysticism, content to blindly accept the illusions of their life in the Flock of humanity (note in the film the garbage dump the gulls cling to for their swill.) Yet some itch to look beyond, to know what really IS. ""The Matrix has you, Neo...""

A good film for the restless seagull.

I saw it as a young teenager, in Puerto Rico and I am even more in love with the movie and soundtrack now!  With love for all, Jorge's mom.",1064880000,13,548,4.160377358490566

This extremely well done movie reminds me of the deepest parts of myself, still yearning for fulfillment. It also warns strongly against the fear and peer-pressure that so often distract seekers from their highest goals. It is a reminder to each eternal soul that it is still possible to live your vision and find God in yourself.
After finishing this movie I went outside and wept. Am I fulfilling my purpose in life? That dream that I once had of something greater? This movie sings: wake up and live again!
Great music!",1046649600,31,607,4.682242990654205
258372,4,6300216586,"It is of course important to mention first off that this is not your standard movie. For a movie going audience conditioned by such spectaculars as Harry Potter, Titanic, Star Wars, and Spider-Man, it would be hard to imagine exactly how this would play out in the theaters today (as I recall, it didn't fair to well back in 1973 either).
All of this doesn't mean this isn't a -good- movie. It contains a lot of sweeping ocean scenery, with of course lots of wonderful footage of seagulls. It also has the great score by Neil Diamond, and then woven throughout this is the original story by Richard Bach. And it is perhaps in that order that this movie exists. It is a relaxing, calming, as well as uplifting (on a very subtle scale) experience. To watch it with the same rapt attention that you might a modern ""spectacular"", you would no doubt be quickly disappointed and bored. Instead, it should be watched at a time when you just want to relax, no pressing chores calling your name, and no interruptions that you might need to deal with. You might think of this as the closest thing to a full-body massage for the mind, encapsulated in a hour and a half movie.
One caveat however, is that I would recommend that you read the book first, because there are times when exactly what is going on with the seagulls is a little confusing, and difficult to figure out from what happens on-screen.
While I doubt it will ever happen, I would love for this to be released on DVD, it would greatly improve the quality of the video and soundtrack (both copies I've seen of this movie have had an mildly distracting ""tracking"" problem which results in pops and crackles in the audio), and it would perhaps also allow supplimentary audio tracks with discussions from Richard Bach, Neil Diamond, and perhaps others associated with this film (Hall Barlett, the director died in 1993).",1023062400,190,1871,4.621621621621622

7806333,2,6300216586,"I'm an English teacher and I very much enjoyed the novel. I wanted to provide my students with some visual reference to as we read the novel, but I could not, by the life of me, finish this movie. For a movie that spends most of its time on the thoughts and words of its main character you would think the movie would employ a voice actor without such a grating and downright annoying  voice. The titular character often whispers, haltingly and hoarsely; making for a unsavory experience. If Jonathan isn't speaking the movie gets a musical interruption for a good two to three minutes of ABSOLUTELY nothing. I'm not kidding. In the forty minutes I could muster of this movie there was at least 3 to five separate long and unsubtle attempts of padding out the movies run time with scenic shots and little else. No dialogue, no attempts to further the story, no point whatsoever. I found it hard to choose which parts I looked forward to less. The badly delivered sections of dialogue or the wholly unoriginal scoring set to shots of the sky. Wouldn't recommend this if you're looking to use it in an educational sense. You're better off with the audio book read by Richard Harris which you can find on Youtube. Although it skips sizable parts of the novel, it's nothing that destroys the narrative or its message plus it's far more engaging and the music and voice works is miles above this product.",1521244800,,1399,4.596
