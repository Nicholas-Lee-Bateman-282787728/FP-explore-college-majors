Then come and watch this and pick it apart. Well, I'm here to tell you this was a good film with a different story, plot and had a wonderful cameraman. Now yeah it was too dark to tell what was what in some parts, but the acting was great, writing was fresh and witty. All the cast even the villains were likable, well maybe not the farmer at the beginning or the cop at the end. It seemed fast paced and made sense even the few backstories were interesting. I hope they can make a sequel with the same standards.",1515024000,,675,4.2

8686755,3,B00P80Y29M,Movie was okay. Didn't show much of the monster.,1448064000,,48,4.444444444444445
8686756,1,B00P80Y29M,"Two brothers, joined by one of the brothers' girlfriend, journey to a small town in search of their birth parents. The town is scarcely populated and is known for Bigfoot sightings. The trio eventually learns that the town sacrifices people to ""the Gods"" in order to secure their own release from the town limits. Guess who's now on the menu? Terrible script plods along slowly, and bad acting makes it seem to plod even slower. Throw in night scenes so dark you cannot tell what's happening, which is probably good since what IS happening would look plain silly if you could see it clearly. If you want to waste your money, you're better off feeding it to a paper shredder than you would be buying this idiotic film.",1426464000,,717,4.609375
8686757,5,B00P80Y29M,"Messed with my mind in a good way. Kind of reminded me a little of one of the classic a low-budget horror film from the '70s or '80s for some reason. The acting was very good. Interesting subtext behind the actions of the locals if you're paying enough attention. There are things about it that just come off as campy, but when I say that, I mean generally in a good way. I did feel that some of the scenes were shot way too dark, as someone else pointed out in their review. I can forgive that, though, because after all, no film is perfect. And you don't really want one like this to be anyway.",1425168000,,596,4.146551724137931
8686758,2,B00P80Y29M,"This is really a one star B movie, but I gave it two because of the decent acting of those in the story.  It is way too dark, in places you have to strain to see something.  The storyline isn't really very good.  Two brothers were taken from a small rural town when they were children.  Now when their new parents have passed they find a VHS tape that shows their real parents and a town.  The two brothers really don't get along well, the older one is a loser, but they set off, along with the younger brother's girlfriend, to find the town and see if they can find the parents.  It is in Bigfoot country and when they get there they find that something is amiss.  This is a dark and confusing storyline at the end.  Fans that enjoy anything Bigfoot might be interested, but you don't see much and never get a good look at the creature.",1422662400,,837,4.1875
8686759,1,B00P80Y29M,Don't waste your money or time. I rented this and regretted it halfway through the movie.  It was dark throughout the film I thought I was watching a poorly made bootleg copy. Horrible flick!,1420156800,,191,4.617647058823529
8686760,1,B00P80Y29M,"Found this one quite boring and without scares. Very cool DVD artwork, along with the plot summary, sold me on taking a shot on a rental, but it was definitely a bad move on my part. But, of course, you take your chances... Hopefully, I can save you from making the same mistake I did. Wait until it comes up on Amazon Prime for free. The acting was average (not terrible), but the film itself was just a tedious grind, lacking any suspense or even a slow-build. There was only one scene in which I found myself engaged at all in this video, and it lasted perhaps a minute. Not worth the price of admission. The plot summary sounded like fun, but as with so many homemade films these days, this one's another waste of time and money.",1418256000,2,733,4.318840579710145
8686761,1,B00P80Y29M,"Huge waste of time and money. If you want a good big foot movie see ""Exists"".",1417910400,5,77,3.875
8686762,2,B00P80Y29M,This film is VERY poorly lit.  This is a major distraction...,1417824000,2,61,4.545454545454546
