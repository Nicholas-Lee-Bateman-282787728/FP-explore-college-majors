7934663,5,B00005A067,"As I reviewed the TaeBo Impact intro earlier as it taught me more impact. This workout helped me get active and had lost a few pounds or so  When it came time to move on to the real workout, I was able to use my new boxing gloves with my makeshift punching bag and followed Billy Blanks' instructions. I did lose some weight and I was able to fully sweat.",1520640000,,355,4.071428571428571
7934664,5,B00005A067,"I had this video when I was younger, loved it and its hard to find it in vhs.  So glad amazon had it.  One of my favorite work outs its easy to use and easy to get into if its been a while since you've excesized.  I've done some of billy's other excersize cd's and some are a lot harder than this.  This is great to start out with.  Its low key but it makes you move the muscles you haven't for a while so you're still sore but in a good way.  My fav...",1463961600,,453,3.7157894736842105

7934667,5,B00005A067,"This is Tae Bo Inspirational workout that gives you a great sweat and gives you inspiration at the same time. Of course it is recorded live at Billy Blank`s world training center and has Billy with his wonderful instruction that makes you want to get up and go and just do it. Its running time is about 30 minutes but it is not easy all the same great power of Tae Bo blended with the inspiration of the Lord. With the field I am in which is a very tough one indeed,getting punched in the face is not always that easy and some days when I feel down and I think I just can`t make it like some force holding me down and telling me to give up which is completely the wrong thing to do,this tape gives me the stength and motivation not to give up. After losing my father I was to the point were I just wanted to give up on everything including my boxing and other thing I wanted and want to do in my life. After doing this video a few times it actually brought my mind back on the up side instead of the down side of things. It is the hard core punching,sweating and kicking power of Tae Bo with Billy spreading the word of Jesus Christ and giving you the motivation that you can do this and there are no exscuses for it. If you are somebody that is thinking you can not get in shape,if you are thinking you can not lose weight,or if you are just so down on your luck with no workout program,I would say to buy this video and get up and get started. I will tell you this this video is not easy,it is a workout,if you are just starting out with Tae Bo or any workout program this will be a struggle,trust me it will be a struggle,and for you people who are in a workout program,an athltete like I am you will love this workout as well because during the video Billy gives you great words of motivation along with the workout,he talks about the struggles in his life and how he found Jesus Christ. Me I am a person who has done some wrong things in my life,everybody does,nobody is perfect and this workout will lift your spirits,if it lifted my spirits it will certain lift you spirits. And you will have to work hard at it. You have to work hard to accomplish things in life,it doesn`t matter who you are,you got to work,you have to climb to the top of the mountain to get what you want,As Billy you have to give some to get some,those are some great words of motivation to get you up and going. Anyway I highly suggest this tape for purchase,you will be very glad that you did. But yet again it is not going to be easy,but let me tell you it is a whole lot of fun and addicting when you get in to it trust me.",1283904000,,2606,4.081871345029239
7934668,4,B00005A067,"My mother, who is fairly religious, bought this for me years ago. I guess she wanted to add a little Christianity in my workout!

The video is really good. You get an affective workout, without it being too strenuous. You'll definitely work up a sweat. There is gospel music, which is good and upbeat. Billy Blanks is a great instructor, offering words of inspiration and encouragement without being preachy.

I just wish they would make a DVD version of this video.",1283040000,,466,4.7407407407407405
7934669,5,B00005A067,I love Tae Bo & have almost all the videos & DVD's!  This is one of the best!,1248998400,,77,3.2777777777777777
7934670,4,B00005A067,"I picked this tape up at my local Best Buy and wanted to try it out because I wasn't sure what Billy Blank was driving at with the title Tae Bo Inspirational.  Billy gives a few minutes at the beginning and end of the tape as to his spiritual feelings about life in general, not just exercise.  It's not long and it's not preachy and I have had the video long enough that I usually fast forward to the actual warmup.
If you have any of his other tapes and I have them all then you know what to expect.  The difference between this video and his usual Tae Bo Basic series are two fold: 1) He does his exercise routine to very uplifting gospel music.  So if you don't like gospel or feel it would be too distracting then stick with his other videos.  I found it to be just fine.  2) More emphasis is placed on the lower body.  You get the punches, etc. but I found he has more routines that involve the legs.
Much as I like Billy Blank he still has the same problem that is present in every single one of his tapes.  He is still forgetting to do the same number of repetitions of each exercise on each side.  For us veterans we are all too familiar with Billy's habit of starting to talk to the viewers or to the class participants and forget to tell his daughter to change to the other side.  He does this in at least 3 sets of exercises on this tape.  If I remember I usually change the side myself so I don't feel so lopsided.  If you don't care about that but just that your heart rate will stay in it's target zone then no problem.  You won't have any problems there.",1024099200,18,1570,4.091503267973856
7934671,5,B00005A067,"After doing the Taebo Advanced tapes I bought Taebo Impact and love it. Two things make this tape great.  One is it teaches you focus and concentration and makes doing Taebo Basic or Advanced much more enjoyable and you have better form.  Secondly it provides an awesome workout which last 41 minutes of great sweating and fun!  Really, if your a taebo lover or just enjoy punching a bag you will love this tape!",982540800,,412,4.54054054054054
