2885091,5,B000SINSX0,"This was a wonderful collection of ""vicar"" DVD's. We enjoyed all the shows! If you are a ""vicar"" fan, or a BBC fan, I recommend that you purchase this DVD collection. We loved the extra information that the DVD's have about the cast and the show in general.",1197849600,18,257,4.375
2885092,5,B000SINSX0,Fell in love with this series on TV and was delighted to find the collection.  Top drawer humor by a very talented cast. Reminiscent of great quality of Absolutely Fabulous.  Not surprising considering Dawn French is involved in both.  Thoroughly enjoyable.,1194134400,16,257,5.219512195121951
2885093,4,B000SINSX0,"Enough has been said about the actual series itself and I couldn't agree more that it's one of the most clever and funny shows to have been produced in TV history. Thank goodness for Richard Curtis.

While it is great to have a DVD set which gathers all the episodes together, I have to say that the sleeve which holds the 5 DVD cases is woefully cheap and does not befit such a wonderful compilation. For all those ""completists"" like me out there who like their boxsets to be both attractive and sturdy, this is disappointing. I would expect the UK BBC version to be better executed.",1194048000,56,584,4.457943925233645
2885094,5,B000SINSX0,"I purchased this thinking it was a new set, as the description did not specify.  I returned this because it was just a new packaging with the series 1-3, specials, and A Holy Wholly Happy Ending.  Odd too was that the offer to buy this collection AND a second copy of A Holy Wholly Happy Ending!  Love the series, actors and everything, but the advertising and description are very misleading.",1193788800,315,393,4.585714285714285
2885105,5,B000SINSX0,"Watching an episode of The Vicar of Dibley makes our day.  If it's dreary out, it's like a ray of sunshine.  Would that life would be as simple as in the village of Dibley!",1519862400,,172,4.029411764705882
2885106,3,B000SINSX0,if it had subtitles it might be okay but as it is without them............well it is gathering dust on the cabinet.  We could not understand anything she says.,1519689600,,159,4.678571428571429
2885107,5,B000SINSX0,"This is probably my favorite Brit com of all time. Dawn French creates the perfect, witty, loving, outrageous Anglican priest who never fails to surprise and entertain. As a pastor of 30 years, I can honestly say that the characters may be outrageous and somewhat exaggerated, but anyone who's sat through a church council meeting will recognize the truthfulness of church life under the comedy. Where else could parishioners have this argument:
Owen Newitt: Filthy weather.
Jim Trott: No no no no no no no no I've known worse.
Owen Newitt: Oh yes? When was that, then?
Jim Trott: The Great Storm, when the windmill got blown over.
Owen Newitt: That wasn't the Great Storm; that was a moderately windy night. No, the really great storm was the Great Storm.
Jim Trott: When was that, then?
Owen Newitt: When Dave Batt got decapitated.
Jim Trott: That wasn't the Great Storm.
Owen Newitt: Well, it was pretty damn great.
Jim Trott: No, the greatest storm was the one when Old Harold got blown into the quarry.
Owen Newitt: Ooh, that! The Great Winds.
Jim Trott: The what?
Owen Newitt: The Great Storm there's got to be rain, and in the Great Winds there was just wind.
Letitia Cropley: Nasty night. It reminds me of the Great Storm.
Owen Newitt, Jim Trott: Shut up!

2885120,5,B000SINSX0,"Though I don't agree with some of the theology and it can be crude at times, I found it quite humorous in how the vicar dealt with the parishoners, especially during the council meetings. The Christmas play at Owen's farm is my favorite.",1496880000,,237,4.534883720930233

2885123,3,B000SINSX0,"I thoroughly enjoy this show.  However, I feel lied to.  It's advertised as being every episode ever written.  There are only 20 episodes.  Over 12 years???  I would not have purchased it if I had known it was only a few shows plus some specials.  False advertising.  I've seen more episodes on PBS than in this collection.",1495670400,3,323,4.56140350877193

2885135,5,B000SINSX0,"I think this is probably one of the funniest comedies out there. There is so much stuffiness around anything church related that has yet to be explored, but the Vicar takes it on. Geraldine is wonderful and slapstick and spontaneous.  She heads up a mixed bag of characters with pure delight. Dawn French is looking for love on a personal level, while still being loved and adored by all she comes in contact with.

2885157,5,B000SINSX0,"How can one not love this serie. It came at a time when there was a real discussion in the British Clergy about allowing women to become Vicar.
As usual, the writers base themselves on typical English sitcoms: A smart and funny main character, surrounding by crazy, lunatics that are still quite endearing.
Dawn French plays the role to the perfection. One gets used to live with her and her funny fellows and it can even gets touchy at a time, yet never lose its sense of humor and sometimes slapstick comedy.",1457913600,16,510,4.554347826086956

2885205,5,B000SINSX0,"The British have an odd idea of what constitutes a `series' (only twenty episodes and six specials strung out over the course of many years).  I was left wanting more.  But what little they produced was brilliant, apart from one egregious episode where they felt the need to shove their political views in everyone's face.  Trying to promote a serious issue in a comedy is redundant.  There are far better platforms for that sort of thing.  Other than that, the characters were all wonderfully wacky, the situations inspired lunacy (odd though that Dibley was primarily unpopulated but for those few people).  My favorite character was Mrs. Cropley (Liz Smith) who didn't survive the entire series, unfortunately.  This is something I can easily watch a million times and still find it funny.",1433203200,,792,5.0

2885220,4,B000SINSX0,"I am not by any stretch of the imagination of a Christian persuasion; whether or not that has any bearing on how much I enjoy this British comedy series is left up to the reader, but I thought I'd get that out there. In spite of the Christian trappings of the nearly 20 year spanning tale of Geraldine Granger's time as the vicar of the small, ludicrously goofy British village of Dibley, I can't just watch one episode of this show. Owning this collection of nearly every Vicar of Dibley related show and special almost requires one to sit down and marathon the entire series end to end. Although I could have done with a few more special features (I've recently developed an appreciation for commentaries thanks to Spaced, Black Books and Red Dwarf and am always a bit disappointed when a series like this lacks an outake reel), this collection pretty much covers everything you might wan from a box set that spans the entire evolution of a single series like this one.

Definitely recommend the series and this box set alike.",1424390400,,1028,4.617486338797814

Such idiosyncrasies & craziness. Such a quaint English village. David reminds me of myself & Squidward from SpongeBob Squarepants. There isn't anyone I dislike, which is extremely rare for me.

2885325,2,B000SINSX0,"When PBS first aired it in the USA, it hyped up the program and we were led to believe this would be something great.  We watched one episode and we weren't impressed.

The scenario is about a Rosie O'Donnell lookalike who become the vicar of a Church of England church in a small conservative British town, and her liberal views inevitably come into conflict with those of her parishioners.  The episode we saw had her attempt to have stuffed animals made to sell at a fundraiser, but they turned out to be terrible.  Then she hears about a parishioner who has a relative named ""Reginald Dwight""...and the vicar and everyone else assumes that it is Elton John, so the town makes an arrangement for an Elton John concert.

One problem...the Reginald Dwight in question is NOT Elton John after all, but some little wizened old man.  Fortunately, the vicar happens to find a different celebrity to give the concert, and she bribes her by promising that she can worship the Devil without fear of going to Hell, and everything ends happily.

This sort of thing might have been hilarious in Britain, but it just didn't succeed here.  Some things just don't work in translation.",1406937600,2,1172,4.71078431372549

2885373,5,B000SINSX0,"Another item that was on my wish list for years.  The few episodes I had taped back in the 90s on public TV were just not enough.  Had to have the whole set: all the episodes, including the specials.
Geraldine (Dawn French of ""French and Saunders"" fame) is very witty and is more in sync with the outside world than her small out-of the-way village of parishioners.  She is so funny and so amused by life.  She is a real person, too, who drinks on occasion, puts away quantities of sweets, gets crushes on, dates, and sleeps with one or two men.  Not controversial to me, but I can see it might not be everyone's cup of tea.  Great supporting cast, including that tall vague chap from ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". A one-of-a-kind British comedy series with some nice moments when she touches the ""better angels of our nature"" in a very light-handed way.  Not unlike Dr. Who circa 2005-2009. Hey, call me eclectic...
This portrait of a real woman as a minister made me take a look at the career field for myself.  That's one way hospital chaplains can be made.  And I wasn't the only chaplain who had seen and loved the show.  Nice work, Ms. French & company.",1391472000,,1160,4.429245283018868

A WOMAN vicar...you must be kidding!  However, as the series goes on you not only get to know this marvelous wild around the edges kind-hearted and just a bit crazy--otherwise, she wouldn't fit in to Dibley--character played by Dawn French, but also the other bizarre characters.  One of my favorites is the little old lady with a penchant for creating odd food combos.  Plus the local farmer with other even stranger interests.  Eeep.

Tremendous series.  Always ends with a joke being told between Geraldine and her verger, the goofy Alice.  Charming at times, heart-warming at times, laugh out loud funny at times.

I visit this silly little English village whenever I can and watch the dear Christmas episode each year.  Coming in a close second is the Easter episode. Just how many Easter Bunnies can one village have?

If you like British comedy, you will enjoy this show.",1374796800,,1038,4.868571428571428

2885414,5,B000SINSX0,"Utterly fantastic comedy by Dawn French go French and Saunders. The characters are all quirky,me specially the loveable yet amazingly dim Alice, as well as the rest of the town oddballs who have to make the adjustment to a -gasp!- female Vicar. Dawn French plays the vicar as a strong but sweet woman determined to keep her job, increase her flock and find a way to get Alice and her equally dim love of her life together,mdespite his father's insistence that it will never happen. The characters are so quirky but so sweet and adorable you can't help but fall in love with them all. Each episode ends with the vicar telling Alice a joke that Alice only very rarely understands, but is completely hysterical to he viewer.
If you like British comedy, the Vicar of Dibley is the cream of the crop. Wildly successful in the UK because of its funny yet always sweet humor, you're sure to fall in love with each and every silly character, including the village sheep farmer who rarely bathes.
Buy this one, even before you pick up ""Are You Being Served"" or ""Faulty Towers"" as ""Vicar""is one collection the hole family will enjoy, although maybe not suitable for the very young s adult themes (ack! Sex!) sometimes comes up.
Truly, one of the great, sweet and endearing comedies ever produced by the. BBC.",1370476800,3,1298,4.647826086956521

Completists elsewhere in this review section have bemoaned the absence of a particular Comic Relief special. If that matters to you, you'll be just as disappointed as they were. Myself, I find the Comic Relief specials a bit tiresome at best, so I'm actually happier without them. To each their own.",1369267200,,540,4.56701030927835

2885419,3,B000SINSX0,"The Vicar of Dibley does include good comedy and if this is what you are looking for, you will enjoy it (we do).  However, if you are looking for a more realistic situational comedy, this series seems to be beyond that.

Starting at the beginning, we have now watched about half of the episodes.  There can be tender moments at times, but typically it is one comedic scene after another, sometimes with a chuckle but usually with big belly laughs!

2885470,4,B000SINSX0,"This series is restful, especially for those are ill, recovering from surgery, or otherwise in need of a humorous reprieve, with its goofy depiction of English pastoral life in Dibley, a fictional Oxfordshire village. Those exiled in cities enjoy its charm, and the vital force of energy that is Dawn French as Reverend Geraldine Boadicea Granger. Dawn French is a delight, warm, earthy, passionate, and real, facing resistance as a female Vicar. But not all is spiritual or political, the fun comes with Geraldine's personal quest for great ice-cream, luscious chocolate, and the partner of her dreams. And we want her house.

The Vicar spars with her greatest foe, Councillor David Horton MBE (Gary Waldhorn). He is chairman of the Parish Council, and District Councilor for Dibley and Whitworth. A wealthy gentleman farmer, he is initially appalled at the advent of Geraldine, but eventually discovers that he's drawn to the Vicar's abundant charms and intelligence. James Fleet (great in an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monarch-of-the-Glen-Complete-Collection/dp/B004EYT8BA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monarch of the Glen: Complete Collection</a>) deftly plays David's dolt son Hugo, goofy, gentle, and none-too-bright. He yearns for daft Alice Tinker, Church Verger; Emma Chambers is perfection as the innocently dopey misfit. Alice can't help that her mother is quite mad and her father the cousin of David Horton's father (thus she & Hugo are distant cousins).  I'm particularly fond of Jim Trott (the marvelous Trevor Peacock), another Parish Council member, and the way he can't say ""yes"" or ""no,"" but, ""no-no-no-no-no... yes."" Or the other way around.

Be forewarned, ""Vicar"" goes downhill mid-stride, except for the last two episodes. As the show progresses, the writers can't resist making Jim Trott a caricature of a dirty-old-man. And they lost their minds with the extreme crudeness Owen Newitt (the great Roger Lloyd-Pack, also seen in an episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doc-Martin-Series-1-4/dp/B004KVXCB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doc Martin: Series 1-4</a>), another Parish Council member and farmer with an odious affection for his animals. Roger Lloyd-Pack deserves better than this, and a little of that stuff goes a very long way. Frank Pickle (John Bluthal) is secretary to the Parish Council, so boring that no one cares even when he reveals his gayness. The entirety of the series adds up to a complex, fun show, but a massive misstep is made in a later self-righteous special that exploits real footage of suffering, besieged children, followed by grim-faced countenances of the cast. They get defensive about this episode in interviews. The charity-cause could have been handled deftly, instead of clobbering the audience over the head. Earlier seasons are the best, except for the final romance and wedding; the humor is fresher and less crude. But overall, this is a collection worth having. We even enjoy the music.

Be sure to have your Region-Free DVD player handy! This ""Ultimate Collection"" features the entire collection, ""from conception through to happy ending. Includes bonus features."" There are English subtitles, and all of the Vicar, including shows I never saw on PBS. Box One: The Complete First Series, and the Specials (The Christmas Lunch Incident, and The Easter Bunny); Box 2: The Complete Second Series, and the Seasonal Specials (Autumn, Winter, Spring Summer); Box 3: A Very Dibley Christmas, and a Wholly Happy Ending (The Handsome Stranger, The Vicar in White).

2885477,5,B000SINSX0,"There are very few comedies which are written and acted with such warmth that they repay watching over and over again, but this is one of them. Starting with the idea of a woman coming to a small village parish as the new vicar, the series creates a host of unforgettable characters revolving around the charismatic Dawn French as Geraldine Granger, the eponymous vicar. Her kindness and vulnerability give the show the anchor it needs to explore the vagaries of (wholly imaginary) British village life. David Horton, the stuffy and uptight chairman of the parish council, his cheerful, well-meaning but incredibly vague son Hugo, Frank Pickle (the 'most boring man in England'), stuttering Jim Trott, earthy farmer Owen Newitt, Letty Cropley aka the world's worst cook and the barely sentient verger Alice Tinker.... all wonderfully well-written and acted characters that play off each other like a chamber orchestra, piling absurdity on absurdity as they move further and further from the real world.

Over 13 years, several series and numerous specials the series deservedly became one of Britain's best-loved and watched comedies. The show is at its best when the humor is at its most surreal, and it's here that French's ability to remain credible is so vital. Unlike some other shows, Vicar Of Dibley never loses its humanity and there's a touching moment in almost every program, amid the madness.

Perhaps the funniest character, although the competition is very stiff, is Alice, played by Emma Chambers. It's hard to play a character who is extremely simple (an example: when the parish newspaper runs the story that her fiance is going to marry the verger, Alice is almost in tears until it is pointed out to her that she IS the verger) without descending into mawkishness, but Chambers does it brilliantly. We laugh at her character's eccentricities without ever feeling that she should be pitied. Don't worry, everything turns out splendidly for Alice in the end!

Most people with a sense of the ridiculous will get a real kick out of this show and a feeling of well-being from watching genuinely funny and original work. Watch it several times to get all the nuances- and don't skip the credits and Geraldine's joke which closes every episode. This collection, as well as including every episode and special, has various bonus features, interviews and behind the scenes footage which are entertaining in themselves.

Thoroughly recommended.",1338422400,10,2454,5.097014925373134

Its the classic woman stepping into forbidden men-only turf in the beginning. Everyone dislikes The new vicar from the get-go until they get to know her. And I will admit I kind of saw Gerry getting together with David because it seemed thats where they were building it up in across some episodes and it would have made sense but I guess they changed thier minds when by the last set, Wholly Happy Ending, when they introduced someone new for her to tangle with at first before she realized he wasn't such a bad guy even for a 'Townie'. Kind of like how the villagers found out Gerry wasn't so bad after they got to know her. But it does make one wonder why take it, the story, one way then toss it aside and go another way instead... unless they were running out of time towards the end. But anyway I laughed through the whole thing and im very glad I gave this a shot.

I'm an Episcopal priest and I use a season or four to six random episodes as a late summer program and a means to get folks back to church for Wednesday Eve. Bible Study which follows the four to six episodes of the ""Vicar"".  It is a wonderful and non-confrontational program to introduce non-Anglicans to the Church of England and the Episcopal Church USA.  I utilize a little church history and polity in the form of trivia that each episode points to.  The out-takes and character sketches help with this, but may not mean much to the individual viewer.

I ordered this compilation set with the idea of using it for instructional purposes as well as for the humour and the fellowship opportunities a group viewiing provides.  It works well for my purposes and that is the reason for my 5 Star rating.

2885509,5,B000SINSX0,"THE VICAR OF DIBLEY is a good British television experience.  Dawn French and the other eccentric cast members make for a memorable, funny, and touching experience.  Despite its irreverence it can be preachy at times and the writers never developed nor grew the townsfolk as they should.  It would have made a good show great and a bit less cartoonish.  However you still laugh and cry with the vicar and her parish.  It is very, very funny.  The whole collection is here so don't duplicate.

Its something that we watch as a family and if you do not watch alot of british comedies you may not get the humor. I had a friend come and visit and we watched the whole box set that weekend and she loved it after knowing nothing about it! The extra's disc tells alot of the background and why they wanted to do this tv series.

Take some time out and read the comments from the 1-star group. That's always fun to do, especially the ones about this series. They completely missed the whole point of this humor.

I watched this series when it first came out on TV in this country. Later on I watched it again courtesy of Netflix. I finally decided to buy it from Amazon so I could watch it anytime I wanted. It is a brilliant series.

The actors and characters are superb, along with the script and epidode plots. The Brits are just so good at this type of thing. If you're a prude you're going to be offended by some of the comments and scenes.

So, if you're sick of political shows, down-and-out newspaper articles and want to completely remove yourself from today's stupidity, get this series and watch it...but not all at once. Savor it and make it last.",1296086400,2,957,4.488505747126437

2885521,5,B000SINSX0,"My husband and I first met Vicar Granger when she appeared on PBS over 10 years ago.  She was an immediate hit in our household, and we really understood the humor so well, as we both had served on small Episcopal Church boards. Anyone who has ever served on a small church board of any type will appreciate the dynamics of what goes on in the meetings, and will be matching characters from Dibley to members of their boards I am sure!

This is a not a comedy series about church, or is it trying to preach anything.  It is a comedy about human kind in general, and what makes us all human, and the grace it takes to get through each day.  For some, like Gerry, it is her Chocolate, her poster of Sean Bean, and Jesus, for Alice it is being gently led about by the hand through life, David, being led to believe that he is all powerful and that money is everything...just like a lot of other people we know in our own worlds.  Good Humor always wins the day, never the less, and at the end of each episode, you can't help but have learned a little more about life, and a little more about yourself.

Treat yourself to some time with Vicar Gerry Granger, her Vestry, and the Village of Dibley.  Its worth the trip.",1292889600,3,1213,4.225108225108225
2885522,5,B000SINSX0,"Since I first stumbled on to ""The Vicar of Dibley"" on public channels,I have watched every episode dozens of times. It never fails to make me laugh,even though I know most of the dialoge by heart. It is so well written,the characters are hilarious,and sometimes the program takes an emotional twist off the anticipated tracks and has left me in tears of compassion. It is a wonderful thing when a program can be so ridiculously silly, and at the same time,take a stand against some injustices in this world with such grace and intelligence. It's enormously clever and engaging. I will be watching this series and enjoying every minute of it for the rest of my natural life. It's a gem. I purchased the Immaculate Collection as a Christmas gift to my daughter,and I'm betting that she will be a huge fan of this Brit Com. It's been very difficult not to rip the outer wrapping off the dvd so that I can sample it before I give it away. I will be buying another one very soon.

2885524,5,B000SINSX0,"What amazes me is that everyone in this series NAILED it right from the beginning! The writing was spot on, the actors had their characters, and the WHOLE cast stayed consistent thru the whole series & all the specials.
I love this series because of the intelligent, character based comedy. It's full of warmth and emphasizes that trying to be a good, generous person often lends itself to more complications than being a selfish prick. It frequently confronts the characters with ethical or political issues and circumstances without ever getting preachy (other than one child poverty Comic Relief skit, which is understandable), and I always believe that ""this is how this character would react to this situation"".
Some seasons have very few episodes, but it makes up for the episode ""shortage"" by having no filler: every episode has a point and develops something!
Last note: Don't let the religious setting of this show throw you. Vicar of Dibley is a character-based, intelligently written, warm, funny show that respects everybody and is very accessible no matter what your background. It's endearing, adorable, randy and FUN.

My only wish is that there was more. There are only 19 segments and the pricetag of $80 could put some off. Personally, I find it worth it's weight in pounds.",1288051200,2,442,4.151162790697675

this entire series is par excellence --- dawn french is formidable and has a supporting cast that can stand up on its own --- but with dawn french in the lead, there is simply no stopping them.  the comedy is wonderful --- you laugh constantly and not just from dawn french but from every cast member --- the writing is tremendous and even the opening music by the Kings College Choir, I think, is astounding.

if you like british comedy then you should not hesitate at all to purchase whatever you can of the Vicar of Dibley series.

the french and saunders dvds are a bit different and don't appeal to everyone --- but the vicar series should appeal to even the most jaded of viewers...",1275782400,10,820,4.339869281045751

It was a great chance to re-experience this original, funny series, and see all the shows in succession and watch how the characters were fleshed out and became even funnier as the years passed.  Every actor in this series is an accomplished and apparently highly respected actor.  I guess that's why it was such a successful series.  And Dawn French is one of a kind.  There were tidbits of comments by the director and creator and others, but I would've liked more of that.  The bios of the actors were very interesting...I had no idea of the histories of some of the actors (since they're British).  I thoroughly enjoyed every DVD in this set.  But I think this series was on for more years than are in this set?  If so, I wonder if they are going to sell the remaining shows in a DVD set?  Or is this complete?  Reason I ask is that there is a 10th Year Anniversary DVD, but there aren't 10 series in this set.  Only three.  ???

None of the episodes are edited for length, so you get all 40 minutes of each episode.  The specials that were done for various anniversaries of the show and for Comic Relief are presented in their entirety.

2885536,5,B000SINSX0,"I absolutely love ""The Vicar of Dibley: The Immaculate Collection"".  It is one of Britan's greatest comedy shows.  Watching the lovely Vicar and all the different characters interact within the quaint little English countryside town of Dibley always brings smiles to my face.  I enjoy the series so much that I also bought a copy for my parents for a Christmas gift. They also enjoy it very much, but never thought to buy it.

The wonderfully written scripts combine characters such as; a very charming and upbeat female Vicar (with an addiction to chocolate); a very ""randy"" country farmer; a wealthy, proper Englishman and his bashfully timid, loveable son; an older, talkative gentleman with a passion for keeping the town minutes logs accurate; and a delightfully silly, witty, and dirty old man with a knack for saying the wrong thing at the right time. Along with a very flaky-but-loveable attendant to the Vicar and other excellent supporting cast characters, there is never a dull moment for the Vicar or her Vicarage in the wonderfully charming town of Dibley.

I would give it TEN STARS if I could.  Definitely a must-have series for any serious fan of British comedy.",1262995200,5,1178,4.924242424242424
2885537,5,B000SINSX0,"One of the funniest sitcoms ever-for the BBC or the US. The Vicar of Dibley takes on the issue of the latest edict from the Church stipulating the allowable use of women Vicars or, in America, priests.  This series manages to elicit a definite opinion on that subject through the deft use of wit/humor/situational comedy as well as physical humor-it has it all.  The Village is full of dysfunctionals which all bring something funny to the table while also being very profound in its statements of life, loving, giving, what makes a family, and a host of other notable messages.  It's a feel-good fun time which will leave you feeling good that humanity is on the right path.  All excellent acting.  I have followed this series for over 10 years, yet I'm not entirely sure this series incorporates all of the episodes-I'm sure a lot has been left out over the years, but it is enough to give you a good beginning, middle and end-quite enjoyable and HIGHLY recommended.",1261267200,2,968,4.704142011834319

This set is great to own because quite often there's nothing on and this always appeals. The characters are all colorful and funny as can be, well, except for maybe Frank Pickle, but he's supposed to be very drab. But he is funny at it!!!  I love Emma Chamber's character, Alice Horton (nee Tinker). She's so stupid and sweet- ya gotta love her!!! The more you learn of U.K. culture, the funnier it gets.

For those who have never seen the Vicar,played by Dawn French,  she is a Vicar in a small community in England.

If you all ready have the Divine Collection all you really need to get is Holy Wholly Happy Ending DVD, it has ""The Handsome Stranger"" (2006) and ""Vicar In White"" (2006). If you haven't gotten the Vicar Of Dibley collection yet, this is the one to get ""The Immaculate Collection"" has the entire series, all the specials and features including the above mentioned 2006 episodes. It's a nice way to end the series if there are to be no more Vicar Of Dibley specials or episodes. I hope there may be. The only thing I am curious about with regards to the series is that it is mentioned that Geraldine Grainger's (the vicar) real first name is Bodicia (I may not have spelled it correctly). In the Vicar In White finale, it's said her name is Geraldine Julie Andrews Dick Van Dyke Supercalifragalisticexpalidocious Chim Chim Chury Grainger (again, my spelling may not be right here), just wanted to know why the change?

Particularly the actress who plays the verger, the Vicar's asst. and general dog's body in the church. There is nothing weak about the series, except, perhaps, the contrived ending when the Vicar gets married.

From UTube, I gather this series has come back again, since I saw material not on the original DVDs of the show. It would be interesting to see how they've worked in the husband. Is the series as much fun?

My son was ordained a reverend in the Canadian Baptist Church (Ont.-PQ convention) on June 1. What to get him? Natch, we thought of the Vicar of Dibley but I thought this might be too racy for a 'Baptist' type. I mentioned it to him, he caught some of it on UTube, and laughed until the tears came, at the tension between the holy and the profane. He pronounced it 'perfect.' So that's what he received as a gift from his parents for his ordination. Keep him laughing! Might lessen the burden of all the unholy politics in the modern church!!",1213315200,7,1077,4.461928934010152

The second and subsequent seasons showed that the writers had given it their best and all in the first season.  The funniest segment in each episode really was the delivery of a joke at the end of the episode by the vicar to her airhead/incest-bred assistant to see how she would react to the joke.  But the jokes got even worse than the writing of the episodes, and that's when I decided to shelf the set until I get really bored enough to watch the rest.",1210982400,18,617,4.3304347826086955
