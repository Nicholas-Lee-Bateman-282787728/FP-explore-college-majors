8364859,4,B002D755DK,"I purchased Gossip Girl seasons 1 & 2 as a gift for my daughter.  She was hooked on the books & now she's hooked on this series which is kind of like a soap opera for teens.  She has our DVD recorder set to record it every week & says it's best if you watch this series from the beginning. She doesn't recommend it for young viewers...she thinks there's too much sex in it. She tells me that Gossip Girl airs on the CW network. ""CW"" represents CBS and Warner Brothers; these corporations came together and created ""The CW"". Most of the shows on The CW appeal to 18-34 yr. old women.

From the creator of ""The OC,"" Gossip Girl is an American teen drama series based on the book series of the same name written by Cecily von Ziegesar. The show always begins with a narrator,  Gossip Girl, voiced by Kristen Bell. She begins the recap with the sentence: ""Gossip Girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite"", and usually ends the episode with ""You know you love me. X.O.X.O. Gossip Girl"".  It kind of reminds me of the narration I hear on Desperate Housewives.

The back of season one DVD case says...""Look no further than the latest message from Manhattan's notorious blogger Gossip Girl.  She keeps tabs on the city's most elite teens as they make the rounds from the preppiest school events to the most lavish, decadent parties.""  From New York Magazine, ""The most awesomely awesome show ever.""  From Jason Gay, Rolling Stone...""TV's sexiest drama.""
