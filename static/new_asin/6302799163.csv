516175,3,6302799163,"The Stone Killer, directed by Michael Winner, starring Charles Bronson as Lt. Torrey, a tough cop who takes no s--- or bullets, in this case Torrey is quicker on the draw or you might say a little trigger happy, never hesitating to eliminate anyone who stands in the way, as it may be the mafia. Martin Balsam is the head honcho inviting all the local mafia dons to a birthday party while Bronson follows the tracks and leads while bullets are flying and bodys are falling. The Stone Killer, isn't lacking in action, just a very confusing plot of who's who and Martin Balsam is not very convincing as a mob boss, probably miscast, Norman Fell, as the police captain does an exceptional acting job, and Charles Bronson is his usual self, this is a Columbia Tri-star VHS, with your normal VHS quality, not remastered, so you get the original old transfer of the film.",1225670400,4,865,4.587096774193548

516178,3,6302799163,"Michael Winner and Charles Bronson collaborated on a few films in the early 70s (The Mechanic, The Stone Killer & Death Wish), with this one being a fairly good example of what that partnership could produce. Flashy camerawork, a fair bit of violence and some pretty funny lines contributed by Bronson are mixed with the story of some Italian godfather rubbing out witnesses with a Vietnam Vet hit squad.
As with all the films (at least the ones I've seen) of Bronson, the story takes what was currently hip or newsworthy at the time and twists it to fit Bronson's 'stoic' charasima. In this case the original godfather movie (only here the Don's are totally unbelievable), Dirty Harry (with less anguish/realism)and public fear of Vietnam Vets. The bottom line is that it's totally hollow, but still good rainy day viewing. Bronson has some lines that intentionally or not are totally p**s funny,there's some cool photography and some decent action scenes. However, the main reason to see this film is for the Roy Budd soundtrack, which despite not being quite in the league of ""Get Carter"" is still damn funky.",991008000,6,1112,4.888888888888889

516202,3,6302799163,"this is a very strange Bronson film, in that over the years that I have watched it, I have never really been able to say that it is good, or just okey. I have often felt that it wanted to be too many films, French Connection, Dirty Harry, Godfather. Often I have found the plot hard to follow, in that, one asks the question, why is this happening, why is that happening. Also I think a mistake the filmmakers made was to show a scene earlier in the film, where I guess Bronson as Tory might be with his X wife, and we learn that he has a daughter, it is a cop out of sorts to show that he really is a caring guy. Had they cut it out, may have had a more interesting character. Also recently noticed a Point Blank moment (the Lee Marvin film) in the film, where there are flashbacks for the Torry character, more of these kind of scenes might have made the film better. Also not exploring the problems of returning Viet Nam vets, only hinted in a conversation Torry has with a psychiatrist, and may be something of a hint of the character of Torry having something in common with these vets, as the title might also imply.

Sadly the Aazon video is not in wide screen, but pan and scan. Still I recommend the film for viewing, as one where you look at it, and say to yourself, wow, this could have really a great movie, and what could they have done to make it better. Perhaps a film that really needs to be remade. My favorite Bronson Winner collaboration is the MECHANIC.",1454457600,2,1473,4.223404255319149
516203,3,6302799163,"The Stone Killer, 1973 film

This movie has a high amount of violence and shooting to move its story along. A New York detective relocates to Los Angeles then catches a man wanted for murder in New York. He escorts him back to New York, but the man is shot while at the airport! Next the investigation leads to a murder plot where members of Organized Crime plot a change in management; they will be given an early retirement as happened on April 10, 1931. The police follow a lead to a killer, who is eliminated before he can be arrested. There are plenty of car chases and shootings to shock and entertain the audience. There is also the plot. Vietnam veterans will be used as killers instead of members of organized crime. [Nobody asks what will happen after their mission is accomplished and there is no longer a need for their services.] There are the usual personality conflicts among the police to create drama.

There are better crime stories. This isn't a low budget movie but it wasn't a big budget production either. I think the gangster films from the 1930's and 1940's are better than most modern gangster movies. You may disagree, of course. The story or plot is what makes a great or good movie over an average one. Few of todays movies deal with organized crime and its effects on society. Do state lotteries make a better society?",1453161600,,1347,4.56198347107438

516208,4,6302799163,"One of Bronson's all time best movies is finally given the home video treatment that it deserves--by Twilight Time on Blu-ray.  The colors are nice and the picture is crisp but The Stone Killer still retains the look of a movie shot in the early 1970's--in other words pretty much the perfect transfer and a must-own film for Bronson fans with a Blu-ray player while it's still in print.  Keep in mind that another great Bronson movie released on Blu-ray by Twilight Time, Hard Times, is currently out of print and goes for 50.00 or more (at the time of this review) so don't wait too long on this one.

Bronson plays a hard New York cop who is forced to relocate to Los Angeles after a self-defense shooting of a teenage Hispanic leads to bad headlines for the city.  A couple of years later Bronson stumbles on an aging junkie gangster and is tasked with bringing the prisoner back to New York, where he is wanted on a murder rap.  The old gangster is written off as a washed up loser by Bronson but the man claims he has valuable information about an upcoming hit--and when the prisoner is gunned down at a New York airport almost immediately after he lands Bronson starts to think the old gangster wasn't bluffing after all.

I won't give away any more of the plot but this has one of the best stories of any Bronson shoot-em-up, with actual twists and a story involving a pretty complicated plot by the bad guys that it takes a good portion of the film to unravel.  The Stone Killer would have been even better if it had been directed by a genuine talent like Walter Hill (who was still just a screenwriter when this one was made) or Don Siegel.  Michael Winner was never a great director even when he had great material (The Mechanic) but he was a good enough director at least to not screw up his Bronson flicks.  Unfortunately, he wasn't a talented enough director to ever make a masterpiece like Dirty Harry or The Warriors.

The Stone Killer never quite rises above the level of being an extremely good B-movie, but it's involving, fast-paced, gritty and extremely entertaining.  Charles Bronson is easily as good of an actor as Clint Eastwood or Burt Reynolds from the same period and in the early 1970's was probably as big a star as either of them.  Unfortunately, his career petered out by the end of the 1970's because of bad film choices, not working with the best directors (way too much J. Lee Thompson and Michael Winner and not nearly enough Walter Hill or Don Siegel) and his insistence on making his wife (Jill Ireland) the lead in so many of his films despite her obvious lack of talent.  Charles Bronson isn't looked at with the respect he really deserves today, but he made so many lousy films that it's not really hard to see why.

The Stone Killer (along with The Mechanic; Death Wish and Hard Times) represent Bronson in his prime as a leading man when he was still one of the go-to action stars for the major Hollywood studios.  If you like Bronson this movie is a must see and if you aren't already a fan The Stone Killer might help to change your mind.",1425513600,8,3083,4.460854092526691

516228,1,6302799163,"This is one of the bad movies of Charles Bronson because of the followings:

1. There is NO SUSPENSE.

2. There is NO Memorable TWIST.

3. There's NO Character Development. It's just a plain shoot-them-up movie.

4. It contains the same old stuff as other forgettable gangster movies.

5. The acting of Charles Bronson's assistant is laughable. The acting of the first assassin and his driver are ridiculous.
One of the police officers spoke the word N***** once. In the context of the year 1973, when this movie was released, it's okay. However, in today's context, many people will be offended.

Save your time and money on this one.

516257,3,6302799163,"From that curious period when 70s films still looked a bit like they were shot in the 60s and when some cops still wore hats, The Stone Killer is a pretty decent pre-Death Wish Michael Winner-Charles Bronson film that doesn't do anything new but does it well enough for an hour-and-a-half to make for an efficient enough Saturday Night Special. Bronson's the New York cop whose trigger-happy reputation gets him transferred to LA, where he stumbles across a big case when a prisoner he was escorting to his old stamping ground gets hit before spilling the beans about a hit he was going to be involved in himself. And not just any old hit - Martin Balsam's mobster is taking a leaf out of Lucky Luciano's book and recruiting `an army without faces,' Vietnam veterans with no connection to organised crime, to take his long-brewing revenge for the 1931 `Night of the Sicilian Vespers' murders that ended the Castellammarese gang war 42 years earlier (the film gets the date wrong, citing 10th April 1931 rather than 10th September 1931, but hey, it's a Michael Winner film, you expect fact-checking?).

It's a decent enough hook for a cop movie, and it moves fast enough to keep you from thinking too much about the odd plothole. Bronson's on good form while Winner's direction hadn't yet got as lazy as it would by the end of the decade, though the shadow of the boom mike does have a recurring cameo even in the widescreen version. (Winner also includes a nod to film critic Gordon Gow, who worked on Films and Filming when Winner was a fledgling film critic there, in a PA announcement in a hospital scene.) The odd interesting face pops up in the supporting cast - Stuart Margolin and Paul Koslo as mercenaries, The Waltons' Ralph Waite as a racist cop who's waiting for hats to come back in fashion, Norman Fell and a young John Ritter as cops a few years before they co-starred in Three's Company and regular character actors like Walter Burke and Charles Tyner - while Gerald Wilson's script gives most of them enough to do to make an impression even if no-one's on award-winning form here. Throw in a great car/motorbike chase, some decent action scenes, a funky Roy Budd score and the odd bit of obligatory post-Dirty Harry society's going to the dogs and the criminals are winning speachifying and the result is one of the better disposable cop movies of the 70s.

Sony's PAL DVD is completely extras-free, but does at least boast a good widescreen transfer.",1287532800,8,2467,4.695150115473441

7831783,4,6302799163,"Charles Bronson was one of the hottest movie stars in the seventies only behind Clint Eastwood when it came to the box office. But before he had his breakout role in THE MECHANIC, he played mostly second tier parts doing so with ease. All of that changed in 1972 as that film became a hit and was quickly followed up to cash in on its release with THE STONE KILLER.

Made between THE MECHANIC and DEATH WISH (all three of which teamed Bronson with director Michael Winner), Bronson stars as New York police detective Lou Torrey. As the film opens hes in trouble with the higher ups for shooting a suspect who had drawn and fired on him. This isn't the first time its happened and with the public making a scene he decides to turn in his badge and move west. Hes given a detectives badge again and makes as little problem as possible.

Time passes but Torrey ends up getting clues that something big is in the planning stages. It begins with the arrest of an old hit man he recognizes who is then gunned down. Each clue leads him closer and closer to the truth, a situation that will merge his past and present. It seems that old mob boss Al Vescari (Martin Balsam) planning to finally unleash the revenge hes waited years for.

His plan is to exact vengeance on the mob families that were behind the night of the vespers, an evening decades earlier when a number of mob bosses were all killed on the same night, changing the makeup of the mob from then forward. How he plans to accomplish this is where the clues come into play and while a number of posts online will tell you what that is Ill allow you to find out for yourself.

This is not Bronson at his best but it is better than a few others hed done by that time. The character is in the mold of Dirty Harry which had come out two years earlier. The tough cop who plays by his own rules and employs a sort of vigilante justice in the eyes of the press and police watchdogs who aren't there to walk the same areas he covers or be shot at. The good part about it is that in watching his films you can see the progress of Bronson from supporting to leading roles. Some would like to discredit his skills as an actor but come on, this isn't Shakespeare here. He does a great job at what hes doing in these films.

Twilight Time is releasing this film in the usual beautiful clearest presentation possible in 1080p hi-def on blu-ray. They include several extras this time around including an isolated music track, audio commentary track by Bronson biographer Paul Talbot and the original theatrical trailer. Copies are, as always, limited to just 3,000 so if you're interested pick one up soon. Bronson fans who failed to do so on previous titles found themselves left empty handed by not picking up titles right away.",1503878400,2,2770,4.391812865497076
