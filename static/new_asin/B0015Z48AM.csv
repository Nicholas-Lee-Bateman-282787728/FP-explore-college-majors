IT STARTS FROM EARLY 1900'S AND HE HAD THEM (3)HOMES/CASTLES BUILT ON TOP OF A MOUNTAIN. HE HAD TO DYNAMITE THE ROCKS, BRING UP 130 TREE BREEDS, THE POOL WAS BUILT 3 TIMES AND IS INLAID W/WHITE MARBLE BUT THE POOL LOOKS BLUE B/C IT IS AN ILLUSION FROM THE SKY. 100 ROOMS FILLED W/GOLD SILVER, CARVED WOODS. OH WELL YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE IT.  EVEN IF YOU ARE OPRAH YOU WILL FEEL POOR NEXT TO THIS PLACE. YOU WILL SEE MOVIE STARS ALSO AS THEY PARTIED THERE.  CHAPLIN, BOGART, ETC.  I LOVE OPULENCE AND THIS IS INDESCRIBABLE!  A MUST SEE.",1226361600,4,646,4.254098360655738
