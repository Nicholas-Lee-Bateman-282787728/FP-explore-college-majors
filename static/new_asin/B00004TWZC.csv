1352910,4,B00004TWZC,"What if Adolf Hitler kept a diary? What would it say? Would it give an excuse - a hint of reason - for why he did what he did? And if there was a diary, how much would the world media pay for an artifact all the world wants to see?
""Selling Hitler"" is a very stylish 4-hour British miniseries of just such a story. As insane as it seems now, the story is true. It happened in 1985, and if you're too young to remember, I will not give away the ending. The fun is in the telling, with corporate greed battling the ethics of good journalism, with common sense flying out the window.
Jonathan Pryce is wonderful as unstable journalist Gerd Heidemann, obsessed with both the good life and Nazi memorobilia. Heidemann acquires Hermann Goering's old yacht, but his Stern Magazine editors demand a productive story. That story leaps when he meets shady Conrad Fischer - a smart man with access to Hitler diaries. Heidemann has the bait, his editors take the hook. Then it gets rather complicated.
No action scenes, but the film digs up plenty of tension. The action is in the passion. Everyone in this story wants the Diaries on their terms at their price. Boardroom negotiations turn into smiley warfare, promotions and threats. The atmosphere is so crazed that even discredited English historian David Irving makes a memorable appearance.
At 3 1/2 hours, the delight in detail can swamp you - Rupert Murdoch vs. Newsweek, Newsweek vs. Stern Magazine, editors against each other, journalists against sources, forgers against sources, David Irving against everybody - ""Selling Hitler"" is a cutting character study of paranoia, hucksters and good old scheming. Perhaps it's better to watch this over 2 days. Or not - I watch it straight through every time, exhausted but grinning. The pace is excellent.
Still, I hope this film will find a DVD release, as that could eliminate my only complaint. The video print for this film is so-so, with slightly muffled sound, and visuals that seem underlit. This is a non-issue in the second half - much of which takes place in static media corporation light - but more so in the shadowy creepy early half. The film clearly wasn't released this way - DVD would be a good excuse to set this right. Still, ""Selling Hitler"" is perfect ammunition against those who say ""Masterpiece Theater"" is the best British TV has to offer. Highly recommended.",1025481600,6,2374,4.750605326876514
7923169,4,B00004TWZC,"Who would have thought that such a hoax could go on for so long and involve so many people? This almost four and a half farce is well done in how they portray the fanatical and delusional Gerd, hunting for Hitler and allowing greed get the best of him. This program shows a journalist what not to be, ever. While the subject matter was not funny a all, the silly way this film was done did offer some laugh out loud moments as well as shaking one's head in pure disbelief. Who knew such a culture of Nazi memorabilia fans even existed!",1484697600,,535,4.254901960784314
7923170,4,B00004TWZC,"Enjoyed this quite a bit. Solid work from all the actors (particularly liked seeing Alexei Sayle of The Young Ones since he doesn't seem to do much TV work anymore). A great send up of true story (I expect the Brits don't have any trouble making the Germans look like fools, although they didn't need all that much help in this instance.) A lesson in self-delusion, corporate culture, and just plain greed. Not played for laughs but there is plenty all the same, more the head-shake tsk-ing kind than belly laughs but still enjoyable nonetheless.",1466899200,,546,4.757894736842105
7923171,5,B00004TWZC,"If you were unaware of the Hitler diaries hoax of 1981-83, the scenario and personalities of the British TV mini-series docudrama, 'Selling Hitler', might seem so improbable as to be a Mel Brooks-devised slapstick farce.

The most imaginative writers of comic fiction could hardly invent characters like Konrad Kujau (""call me Connie"", alias Fischer), a professional dealer in his own prolific forgeries of Nazi memorabilia; the senior German magazine journalist Gerd Heidemann, obsessed with Nazi memorabilia, who ""collected"" Hermann G&ouml;ring's yacht Carin II and his daughter Edda; the German, British and American media moguls fooled into paying millions of dollars for some 60 forged ""diaries"" obtained by Heidemann from Kujau; the ex-wartime intelligence boffin and interrogator turned eminent historian, Hugh Trevor-Roper (Lord Dacre), who initially was fooled by and authenticated the forgeries; or the Texan multi-millionaire collector of Nazi art, Billy F. Price. But these are merely some of the very real cast of colorful characters of 'Selling Hitler', who are played by mostly British actors, headed by Jonathan Pryce as Heidemann and comedian Alexei Sayle as Kujau. The strangest casting, on paper, seems Australian comic performer Barry Humphries as media mogul Rupert Murdoch, but even this works, because Humphries, like the others, is a skilled actor. Other notable performers in 'Selling Hitler' include Tom Baker and Peter Capaldi, both well-known to viewers of British television drama in the lead role of the long-running sci-fi fantasy series 'Dr Who'; and the glamorous Irish actress Alison Doody, who played Dr. Elsa Schneider in 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' and Jenny Flex in the Bond movie, 'A View to a Kill'.

Many hilarious situations of 'Selling Hitler' are basically true, including:

 Stern magazine journalist Gerd Heidemann having a long affair with Hermann G&ouml;ring's daughter, and buying and renovating G&ouml;ring's yacht, Carin II, on which he hosted cocktail parties with maudlin ex-SS generals, senior ex-Nazis and fellow collectors;

 Scenes of Kujau forging pages of pseudo-Hitler banalities in notebooks bought from supermarkets, and ""ageing"" them with tea or coffee stains and banging them on tables;

 Authentication of handwriting in the diaries on at least one occasion using a supposed letter from Hitler which itself had been forged by Kujau;

 The farce of powerful, intelligent and successful peopleand major publications, from Stern (Germany) to the Sunday Times (UK) and Newsweek (US) accepting the absurdities and banalities of the forged Hitler diaries, apparently without the usual duty of care, cross-checks or skepticism; and

 The press conference in Hamburg on 25 April 1983 at which the eminent academic historian Hugh Trevor-Roper was confronted by the controversial non-academic historian David Irving (widely condemned as a Holocaust denier, but an acknowledged expert on Nazi Germany)who detected the Hitler diary forgery before Trevor-Roper (who, to his credit, publicly withdrew his authentication when he realized his mistake).

The Hitler diaries hoax of 1981-83 was an extraordinary instance of life imitating art. Amazingly, it occurred not only after exposure of earlier hoaxes, such as the Mussolini diaries, but more than a decade after Mel Brooks's comedy, 'The Producers' (1967), satirized neo-Nazism and Nazi memorabilia. The Hitler diaries hoax even had a counterpart of Brooks's satirical neo-Nazi musical, 'Springtime for Hitler': an opera Kujau convinced Heidemann that Hitler had written, called Wieland der Schmied ('Wieland the Blacksmith'presumably inspired by the Richard Wagner draft libretto for this Germanic legend). Although Kujau evidently convinced Heidemann of the existence of this opera written by Hitler, he could not produce a forgery to profit by this part of his hoax because he could not read or write music!

About the only downsides of this DVD release of 'Selling Hitler"" are 1. its old-fashioned 4:3 aspect ratio, 2. lack of high resolution digital restoration to current Blu-ray standards, and 3. lack of ""extras"" about the production and historical background. Nevertheless, the DVD resolution is acceptable, and the content of the five episodes of the mini-series is very watchable and entertaining.

7923172,5,B00004TWZC,"A great TV production, if a little too long when all put together. First-class casting and tight scripting, follows Harris' book faithfully.",1403049600,,140,5.409090909090909
7923173,4,B00004TWZC,"This story was so weird and unreal that I couldn't believe it, so after watching part of it I stopped and looked it up on the Internet. (The library even filed it under 'Fiction.') Yet, it is true! Why would someone want to go to the tremendous expense and trouble of renovating the yacht of a former high-ranking Nazi, inside and out? Why would smart businessmen be so accepting of a supposedly journalistic scoop of the century, so exited over such mundane details recorded therein? And even a WWII expert thought they were real! Eventually they're turned over for scientific analysis, almost immediately exposed, and careers go down the toilet.

My one criticism - too long!",1377475200,,677,4.836206896551724
7923174,5,B00004TWZC,"This is British TV at its best. Hysterically funny almost from the start, this is a thinking man's comedy. Little visual jokes are everywhere, like the blink and you'll miss it Hitler jigsaw puzzle. The casting's near perfect and the acting uniformly terrific. Alison Doody is note perfect as the protagonist's girlfriend. The scene in which we first meet her is as nicely judged a piece of comedic acting as I've ever seen. I haven't read Robert Harris' book but this adaptation is a masterpiece in its own right. And it's all true!
There are two versions available, the latest, unedited 5 episode Acorn release and an earlier version, edited into 4 episodes and running at around 50 minutes less. Normally, going with an original, uncut vesion would be a no-brainer but in this case it's a tough call. The edited version is tighter and in many ways better. It's biggest advantage is to have lost the awful ""On last week's show..."" narration by Alexei Sayle that opens each episode. This may have been part of the original TV series but it's a tonal disaster that dumbs the whole thing down. For the rest, it's nice to see all the minutiae, the little moments that were edited out of the first version but they don't really add to the story. If I were recommending one vesion, it would be the 4 episode, with the uncut version in reserve for a second viewing. My 5 stars were for the 4 episode cut. I'd give the longer one 4 stars. PQ is similar in both.",1330819200,3,1455,4.5361216730038025
7923175,5,B00004TWZC,"Dramatized renditions of true past events are often very intriguing, and this was no exception.  Jonathan Pryce was excellent as a hero-worshiping dupe who fell for a well-conceived scam about the existence of Hitler's alleged diaries, which were nothing but forgeries.  He actually led a major German magazine into dumping a bundle of cash to obtain the rights, only to realize in the end that they had bought and published a set of utter lies.  The fact that it really happened makes the story even more interesting.",1326758400,,518,4.931034482758621
7923176,4,B00004TWZC,"Konrad ""Connie"" Fischer (Alexei Sayle), a.k.a. Konrad Kujau, was a con man who knew his mark. A ""con man"" or ""confidence man"" is a sophisticated cheat who uses fraud to deceive a mark out of his or her money. In this case, the mark was the international press. Gerd Heidemann (Jonathan Pryce), a journalist for the German magazine Stern, was facing a stalled career. He became the perfect target for a series of hoaxes known as the Hitler Diaries. This film portrays one of the greatest literary cons of the 20th century.

Heidemann needed something to jump-start his writing career to get back on track. In the series, he is portrayed as something of an amateur war scholar who enjoys collecting artifacts once owned by tyrants of infamous regimes. First, he buys Hermann Gring's yacht which looks like it might have come out of the Battle of the Bulge. Gring, the most eccentric and grandiose of Hitler's inner circle, was head of the Luftwaffe, the German Air Force during World War II. The journalist invests thousands of German marks to restore the vessel in hopes to invite former Nazis to board and tell stories about their experiences as budding Hitler youths. The boat does draw the former Nazis like a magnet, but the magazine Stern is unimpressed with Heidemann's results. They want something with more meat.

Heidemann then has a chance meeting with a Nazi memorabilia collector and sees an example of a supposed diary written by Hitler. After much persistence, the collector finally reveals his source, Konrad Fischer, a militaria dealer in Stuttgart. However, the collector balks at introducing them, but now the journalist has a name. Another of Heidemann's colleagues meets Fischer at a drinking party full of former Nazi sympathizers. They take old American songs and ""arianize"" them.

Heidemann finally meets Fischer and wants to see if there are more diaries with the possibility of acquiring them. Fischer shows him a few volumes. Convinced of their authenticity, Heidemann gets financing from his publication. Asked how he acquired them, Fischer tells him a story, which is a vital part of any con game. Fischer claims they are from his brother who is a high-ranking officer in East Germany which was then under the Soviet Iron Curtain. The diaries and other material were supposedly retrieved from a plane which crashed in 1945 containing much Nazi material, including paintings and supposedly an opera by Hitler. The diaries are smuggled out of East Germany to West Germany aboard a truck hauling pianos between the countries. Fischer finally agrees to give Heidemann several diaries for the princely sum of 200,000 marks per volume, about US $250,000 in 2010. Essentially, Fischer sells them to Heidemann who in turn sells them to Stern for a profit. Once the first sale is made, the hoax has been engaged, and Heidemann returns frequently with more money for more diaries. By the end, there will be 58 diaries in all.

Heidemann makes money as the go-between and becomes a major player in the publication. Stern is convinced they will make a fortune in their own publication plus they will sell the rights to international press markets, such as those owned by Rupert Murdoch and Newsweek in the US. Everyone is happy. Except there is only one problem. The diaries are complete fakes, forged by Fischer in a back room with a calligraphic pen and a host of literature regarding the Nazis which could be found at any library. There is no ""brother"" in East Germany and no evidence that the crashed plane contained the material supposedly found there by peasants.

However, handwriting experts and other scholars are convinced of their authenticity. Will this be the greatest literary find of the century, or the worst literary con played on the press who wanted to feed the public's continued appetite for all things regarding Hitler and the Nazis in Germany? A compelling chronicle of events of the Hitler Diaries, with strange Monty Python-esque interludes with Pryce looking like a character out of a Wagnerian opera. Not to be missed for those who like hoaxes and Hitler.",1312588800,,4097,4.957787481804949
7923177,5,B00004TWZC,"Don't be fooled in to buying the Dutch DVD release or the Canadian VHS release they both have 50 minutes cut out of the first three episodes, but the great news is it has finally been released uncut on DVD by Acorn Media.  The Acorn Media 2 DVD set is the original broadcast version that was 5 episodes that each ran 50 minutes each (250 minutes total).  I don't think it has been remastered, but it looks pretty good and is a big improvement on the old releases.  This is my favorite mini-series of the 90's and it's hard to believe it never aired in the U.S.  It's got a great cast and award winning production design and is probably the best mini-series you never got to see.",1279843200,2,678,4.2734375
7923178,5,B00004TWZC,"A tawdry and twisted boardroom farce and journalistic spoof. Top notch performances throughout. Equal in caliber in every way to Robert Harris' book, which is a tremendous beach read with serious message. It's chilling to think that the history of Nazi Germany was almost re-written by a drunken gun-nut forger and his emotionally-unhinged dupe. Although very talky, it never drags. Pacing is carefully managed and a four-hour movie goes by quickly. Owing to the length, there is more than enough technical detail about business negotiations, document forensics, historical research, and tabloid journalism to satisfy any geek, but it's never overdone.

It also has willfully goofy moments that leaven a ghastly subject with highly-appropriate satirical humor.",1175299200,7,760,5.608695652173913
