7999576,5,B0000D0YT9,"This series reminds me of a wonderful art appreciation class where the student is taken on an eye-opening and inspiring journey.

It is filled with stunning visuals and helpful narration that guides us through the purpose and creativity of some examples from the best architects. The series highlights the designs rather than biographies of the architects.

In this volume especially is a section on Wright's Johnson Wax Building in Racine.  I have seen this building in the dvd documentary on Frank Lloyd Wright and photographs but this dvd from the Architectures series spends more time on it, highlighting the use of the glass tubes, the tall building, parking garage entrance and the whole complex from the outside.

I highly recommend this series for lovers of architecture and for those who hadn't particularly thought about architecture as an art. I have seen this twice already and will again.",1301270400,,901,5.108843537414966
7999577,5,B0000D0YT9,"I first checked out this DVD and the first DVD in the ""Architectures"" series from a library and was decided to buy the whole series after seeing them.  The library edition also had the Koolhaas house listed on the cover but not inside, although the one I bought (in December 2005) did not list Koolhaas on the cover.

An excellent assortment of buildings is highlighted on this disk, and though the architecture is beautiful what truly makes these disks worthwhile is how the filmakers place the architecture in its society and elaborate on the building's role in it.  Architecture's social, political, and aesthetic aspects are all touched upon in these vignettes, providing one with a unique view of the structures.  These videos are better than some books, even, not only in their depth but also because through film one gets a unique view of the building and how it ""lives"" in its environment.  Very informative, always beautifully shot, the ""Architectures"" series is a thought-provoking addition to any architectural library.",1140480000,7,1030,5.071005917159764
7999578,4,B0000D0YT9,"For some reasons the Rem Koolhaas' section has been taken out from this volume. So we get to view five buildings instead of the six as advertised on the box. Otherwise it would have been perfect,especially for those of you out there who are interested in architecture and design.",1080432000,8,279,4.714285714285714
