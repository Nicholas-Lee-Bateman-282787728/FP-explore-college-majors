8707837,3,B00UPHQ3R2,"The first reviewer on this page has called this film an ""epic.""  I would be in strong disagreement with that label.  This is not a film to be classed with ""Lord of the Rings,""  ""Gone with the Wind."" or even a must see classic like ""Citizen Kane.""  ""Voyage"" is an often self-consciously artsy effort consisting of loosely strung vignettes with little focus or  cohesive dynamic other than a broad theme of ""life and death.""  The first two installments actually carry closing logos from the production company, giving the impression of  multiple short films.  The remaining vignettes are offered as a single piece, relying on  a psychiatrist's holiday ruminations to structure the disparate dramas of unrelated participants.  Disjointed and incongruous would seem to be the best description of this film.

However, I am reluctant to completely trash this movie.  The unconnected vignettes do serve Scud's theme of life and death:  A universal experience is enveloped with particular lived narratives, and a sense of oneness is formed out of the plurality.  Humanity in its great variety shares a common bond in the beginning and end of life, and the individual vignettes support the commonly held experience of living and dying. So  despite the motley stories, the film never seems to unravel into bathos.  And if you are familiar with the director's work, you also know that he loves subtexts and hidden meanings, and there is plenty of that in here, too.  Most of these vignettes are supported by a theme of sacrificial love, which is a powerful theme, but Scud fuses sacrifice to suicide, recasting a social taboo into a different light. It is clear that self-sacrifice is ennobled by self-destruction, and the specter of suicide haunts the entire movie as a moral admonishment:  A successful business man feels his life completed and chooses to die before infirmity overtakes him, a deranged young man eases his mother's concerns about his future, gay lovers court persecution and submit to an assassin's bullet. One could say, ""there is a method to the madness.""

But the film is still a little lackluster.  There is little dialogue, and to borrow a line from the movie, Scud can ""only make pictures but not write.""  Though in an odd way, the lack of talk also seems to enhance the disparity in the vignettes as well as support the quiet desperation of the characters.  Narrative would have been a connecting device and negatively impacted Scud's intentional  polarity of a universal (living and dying) and a particular (lived experience).  Silence is alienating and alienation is often associated with of suicide, so this device works well with his theme. But I am still inclined to think that a little more dialogue would have made for a better viewing experience. Weak scripts require Scud to rely on surrealism to encourage and develop his plots, and the surrealist moments in this film are artistically satisfying, but in  scenes void of words, the images can seem forced and overworked.  His open embrace of Salvador Dali, while not unconnected to his themes (the word ""plot"" never quite works with this film), becomes a ham-handed abstraction that is an incongruous distraction.

Most people, I think, would find ""Voyage"" to be a two star film. I must admit that was my first inclination when I sat down to write this review.  But there is one nice surprise in this movie. Scud excels at filming beautiful young men, and he doesn't disappoint in this film.  Somehow he managed to wrangle Mr. Asia for 2012, Ryan Zhu (aka Zhu Xiaohui), an exceptionally good looking young man, into acting in one of his vignettes.  He is largely known in this country as a model, and it was nice to see him branch out into a new field.  I will not comment on his acting talents--only to say he needs more work.  So, I bumped this rating up one star.",1520467200,6,3841,4.870570107858243
