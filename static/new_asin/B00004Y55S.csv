7926696,5,B00004Y55S,"Well, I wasn't too sure what to expect from this film but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was very touching to hear how an individual is prepared to risk life and health simply to stand on the top of the world. The music I enjoyed but then being composed by a person who loved mountains it made good sense. It isn't really a film score as such - more snippets from here and there from the massive amount of works from a prodigious composer. Hovhaness is a composer who managed to blend East and West in a creative way and his score perfectly compliments Westerners in the East attempting a very demanding and testing struggle to the top. I enjoyed the balance between musical accompaniment and silence (well the sounds of the mountain and the men). Somewhere between a documentary and a film.",1301270400,,788,4.5174825174825175
7926697,4,B00004Y55S,"I was very pleased with Winds of Everest.  I wanted to see John Roskelley, Jim Wickwire, and Phil Ershler in action after reading so much about them.  This DVD certainly allows you to see the real people. The only slight negative is that you are paying top price for this DVD, and it is a bit technogically dated.  No ability to reverse the movie.....it goes all the way back to the beginning if you try to review something a few frames earlier.  Also no ability to put sub titles on the movie.  Otherwise, I recommend the DVD for those who want to get beyond the 1996 tradedy on Everest.",1194825600,,588,4.3577981651376145
7926698,5,B00004Y55S,"Total coincidence, and honest...i'm watching my old copy as i type this (wife preparing for a lesser climb; watching it..)

Very good; combo of the dynamics, the trip there, and the climbing... amazing shots near the end..",1179187200,,222,5.0
7926699,5,B00004Y55S,I ORIGINALY TAPED THIS ONE OFF OF PBS BACK IN THE MID 80'S ALWAYS A FAVORITE OF MINE. I WOULD LOVE TO WATCH IT ESPICIALLY AFTER A WINTER MOUNTAIN CLIMB OF MY OWN. THE DEDICATION TO MARTY HOEY AND CHRIS KERROBROCK WAS TOUCHING. A REALIZATION OF MOUNTAIN TRAGEDY. SOUNDTRACK IS EXCELLANT AND THE NARRATION BY JOHN DENVER SUPERB. THIS VIDEO IS REALLY PART 2 OF THE WHOLE STORY. EVEREST NORTH WALL IS A MUST SEE TO GET THE IDEA OF THE ENTIRE EXPEDITION'S ACHEIVMENT. ALTHOUGH GOOD THE WINDS OF EVEREST IS A MUCH BETTER VIDEO. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.,1080086400,,541,4.587628865979381
7926700,4,B00004Y55S,"In 1982 Lou Whittaker led the first American attempt on Everest's Tibetan  (north) side. But tragedy and harsh conditions turned the team back (see  Everest: North Wall). Lou returned with an even stronger team in 1984,  filmed here, and this time faced even more horrendous conditions, but the  team's willpower would not be driven back without a fight. The strengths of  this film are that it shows somewhat of a who's who from a golden age of  American Himalayan mountaineering (compared to the commercialism of today),  with John Roskelley, Jim Wickwire, Phil Ershler, Geo Dunn, John Smolich,  Peter Whittaker and many more, and it is very well filmed by Steve Marts.  But all the same it failed to utilize two enormously dramatic potential  storylines: One, regarding the death of teammate Chris Kerrebrock in 1981  on Denali, who asked upon dying that a team member take his trumpet valve  to the summit of Everest (barely touched upon here). The will to accomplish  that feat, is a tremendous story in itself (see Jim Wickwire's book,  Addicted to Danger). The 2nd element missed upon, which I will not reveal  (again, see Everest: North Wall), is talked more about, but again, I felt  not capitalized on for emotional storytelling. None the less, this film is  an important historical event and extremely well filmed. Narrated by John  Denver.",969062400,14,1351,4.982062780269058
