2480632,5,B000E1MXSM,Each of these movies are wonderful in their own right--and it's wonderful to see them released as a box set!,1164412800,6,108,4.45
2480633,4,B000E1MXSM,"Seen again for the first time in a couple of decades, Warner's beautifully restored DVD of The Nun's Story is a real surprise, avoiding the mawkish sentimentality that usually accompanied old Hollywood's approach to Catholicism with a sober, quiet unostentatious majesty and a mostly successful attempt to avoid clich (there's no romance with Peter Finch's surgeon as you might expect). Fred Zinnemann, who now seems on the verge of being completely forgotten, constantly does things slightly differently - not just jump cutting from continent to continent, but avoiding convention in subtle ways. When Sister Luke departs for the Congo, not only is her departure handled in the bare minimum of shots but they're also not the ones you usually expect: no head on shots of the ship leaving for the open sea, but instead zooming out from a sideways view before cutting to the ship's wake. The visual economy never feels Spartan, but at the same time it fits the subject matter perfectly.

Audrey Hepburn too is something of a revelation. Too often an irritatingly kooky pixie clotheshorse, here she abandons many of her usual affectations that you either find charming or maddening to give the kind of sincere and grounded performance that was too rarely asked of her. It's a quietly powerful and surprisingly honest film that stands up to the test of time. Shame that for some reason Zinnemann gets Dean Jagger to voice one of the bit players as well, which briefly takes you out of the movie before a sudden act of unexpected violence shocks you back in, but there's little else to fault in it.

The only extra on the DVD is the original trailer.

As Pope operas go, The Shoes of the Fisherman is pretty enjoyable. Dated but shot on a lavish scale in the days when doorstop novels were turned into star-studded epics rather than TV miniseries, it skirts close to guilty pleasure territory without ever providing any unintentional laughs as Anthony Quinn's political prisoner is freed to act as a mediator between the Church and Russia only to find himself elected Pope. Laurence Olivier delivers the bacon as the Russian premier in one of the first of his hammy blockbuster supporting turns he took to supplement his meagre 150 a week salary at the National Theatre, with John Gielgud turning up for one scene as an ailing pontiff while Oskar Werner, Leo McKern and Vittorio De Sica get the more substantial roles. Too much screen time is wasted on David Jansenn and Barbara Jefford's marital problems, an irrelevant subplot that simply gets discarded entirely in the last third, and the political crisis in the background with a starving China threatening world war isn't entirely convincing. Yet there is some substance there even if the politics, both theological and secular, are somewhat confused - how many roadshow pictures feature a philosopher-priest (Werner) under investigation for developing the theories of Teillhard de Chardin? There's even one surprisingly touching scene between Leo McKern and Quinn near the end of the film about loneliness, and Alex North's grandiose score, incorporating as its main theme part of his rejected score for 2001, is quite magnificent. And if you've ever wanted to see Zorba the Pope reciting the Shema Yisrael, this is the movie for you.

It's just a shame that the recent DVD runs into synch problems in the last third and that the making-of featurette has been cropped from 1.33:1 to 1.85:1, meaning that the extracts from the film in it are cropped both horizontally and vertically!

Shot in the spectacularly crappy WarnerColor system, the unconvincing color is the least of the credibility problems with The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima, in which any relationship to the real events at Fatima in 1917 is purely accidental (no mention of any secrets here). The kind of film that gives atheism a good name, it could probably convert the Pope to the ranks of the unbelievers so outrageously heavy-handed is its Hollywood piety. But more bizarre than the clichd sentimentality is the fact that this isn't a film about faith at all but an astonishingly crude and cynical McCarthy era bit of anti-Communist propaganda - hey folks, even God hates Commies! The one surprise is the outright hostility with which the local Catholic priesthood is depicted: disbelieving, antagonistic and clearly doing everything possible to hush things up to protect their jobs and to avoid giving the cartoon commies an excuse to persecute them again, it does hint that someone somewhere along the production line wanted to do something a bit more daring before the saccharine won out. The fact that the film's real-life leading character saw the film and didn't like it says it all.

The DVD transfer copes as well as can be expected with the vagaries of the color system, though some interior shots are particularly grainy and unnaturalistic. The only extra is the original theatrical trailer.",1154822400,14,4923,4.982968369829684
2480634,1,B000E1MXSM,I was very happy to here that Warner Home Video are releasing these films of faith. But I have to query the transfer quality. I don't know is it me we are talking DVD quality right but it look Like The transfer is from a video (The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima VHS Video Transfer on To DVD for sure  also The Films Nior Has any one seen The Longest Day? For Sure VHS to DVD all I am saying is if that's the case why not go out and get your self a video to DVD recorder and do The same right,1153353600,6,491,3.7211538461538463
2480635,5,B000E1MXSM,I HAVE BEEN WAITING A LONG TIME FOR THESE THREE TITLES. EACH IS A MAGNIFICENT PORTRAYAL OF FAITH AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT DESPITE WHAT SOME REVIEWERS HAVE SAID. ALL ARE A JOY TO WATCH AGAIN AND AGAIN.,1146355200,7,196,4.324324324324325
2480636,5,B000E1MXSM,"The only reason to have this three pack is for the Nun's Story which is so far above the nonesense on the other two as to leave one breathless. The thing to do is to buy the Nun's Story seperately..forget this package, and forge ahead with Audrey Hepburn in the greatest film she ever made.

The Shoes of The Fisherman is absurd, even with Anthony Quinn and Oskar Werner. TYhe Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima is a camp classic.

See the Nun's Story, but not with these two other unworthy Dvds.",1144108800,7,491,4.326086956521739
2480637,5,B000E1MXSM,"I was very happy to read that these movies were going to be released on DVD. As the saying goes, ""they don't make movies like this anymore"". These are some of the best religious movies ever made. They capture the struggles and pains of the human person in a challenging world. At the same time, they also express a great sense of hope to a fragile world. Since these movies were made so long ago, I hope our younger viewers will take the opportunity to see these great movies. They will always be truly inspiring.",1143763200,32,513,4.410526315789474
2480638,5,B000E1MXSM,"This is a GREAT collection for those of us who are into religious films!  Warner Brothers has announced the individual release, or a ""Films of Faith"" Collection in time for Easter 2006!  This will include Audrey Hepburn's ""The Nun's Story"" and the inspiring ""The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima"".....but most exciting is the inclusion of the Anthony Quinn film of Morris West's book, ""The Shoes of the Fisherman"" (about the election of a Russian Pope nearly a decade before John Paul II was elected from Poland!).  In particular, ""Shoes of the Fisherman"" is known for its great attention and accuracy of detail in showing the conclave pagentry and process (although in reality this election process has since been updated due to the larger number of Cardinals now eligible to vote in a conclave).  For those of us into ""churchy"" movies, this film has long been considered the Holy Grail of church-themed movies and it is very exciting that it is coming to DVD!",1135900800,69,958,4.823170731707317

2480750,5,B000E1MXSM,"These three films bring back wonderful memories of my childhood! I can remember when I first saw them all and was so moved then could not wait for them to be played again which was usually every year. Then we got to the 70's and they stopped and I was devastated. I remember when video stores first started to become popular in the 80's I started to ask about these films and it seemed no one had ever heard of them. Fast forward, I don't want to be melodramatic but for some it might just change you in some way or another especially - 'In the Shoes Of The Fisherman', with what has happened with the new pope and the new direction of Catholicism (I'm not) I personally can't believe how Anthony Quinn was so spot on, and the writers and the directors were so forward looking. Audrey's Hepburn's performance in 'The Nun's Story', well what can I not say in was fabulous. I could go on and on but I believe you have gotten the point. These are what we call today five star performances by five star actors and actresses. They are a virtual who's who of 'A' listers' of the era's.",1369958400,3,1079,4.294117647058823

2480786,4,B000E1MXSM,"I ordered this product for the express purpose of viewing The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima.

This historical  event was very well portrayed.  In viewing  this movie, I wondered why the last six or seven popes haven't consecrated Russia to the Immaculate Heart of Mary,  The movie was well documented.  I believe this film should be on the big screen alongside The Passion of Christ",1341792000,,382,4.712121212121212
2480787,5,B000E1MXSM,The films were lively and inspiring. Considering how old they are the colour is great. Wonderful stories that are true to the Catholic faith and historicity. I would recommend these films to anyone who is Christian.,1338768000,,215,5.0

2480789,5,B000E1MXSM,"I watched ""The Nun's Story"" on TV several weeks ago. I decided to search Amazon to see if they had the DVD and I was pleased to see they had these three movies as a set.

I had "" The Shoes of the Fisherman"" on VHS many years ago and the quality was so poor (voice, video, skips, and stutters) it was difficult to watch it. The DVD has overcome those flaws. The coloring has also been improved on the DVD.

I'm impressed with the good quality of these DVDs since the VHS versions were so poor. These are stories that will stand the test of time.

There's a very good chance this collection will wind up in several Christmas stockings this year.",1297987200,2,643,4.211382113821138

2480793,5,B000E1MXSM,"This collection includes titles such as The Nuns Story, The Shoes of the Fisherman and The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima.  If religious themed movies are your thing, these are the perfect ones.  The Nun's Story is exactly that showing the ordeals and trials that a nun played by Audrey Hepburn endures while trying to handle nursing at a clinic in the Congo and pre world war II Europe.  Anthony Quinn plays a Russian Cardinal that was imprisoned in the gulags of Siberia by the Soviets during their crackdowns on religious institutions.  He is released and returns to Rome, is elected as Pope after the previous Pope dies.  Good plot and has a very imaginative ending.  The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima recounts the amazing events concerning 3 children that witnessed the apparition of the Virgin Mary and the terrible things that the atheistic authorities went through to make it seem like a fable or lie.",1247788800,,908,4.715189873417722

2480832,4,B000E1MXSM,"This is a warm remembrance of Christian witness that will speak to a universal audience. The Nun's Story is a fairly accurate and touching tale of one woman's quest to follow her heart just as the world falls into war. This is a great example of the Catholic Church in the early 20th century.  With Shoes of the Fisherman, you have a great story of a Pope from the Slavic World, more than a decade before Pope John Paul II. The turmoil of an ancient church trying to deal with a modern world is very well told and is still quite relevant.",1168300800,15,538,4.2745098039215685
