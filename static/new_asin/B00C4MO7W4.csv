8577284,5,B00C4MO7W4,"I've used soy wax resist for years (have even taught it), but there are many techniques and ideas in this two-and-a half hour video that were innovative combinations or just good hints and new (to me) ways of working.  It took me several sessions to get through it because the slow, hypnotic delivery style put me to sleep (suggestion: don't watch this in bed!)  The depth and volume of material outweigh that, and I highly recommend the video.  The production values were good, and it is packed with useful information which make it worth your money and time.",1400976000,2,560,4.6938775510204085

8577286,5,B00C4MO7W4,"Susan Mark's DVD on using soy wax to create fabric is absolutely awesome!

I am a batik artist who previously thought that using resists to create fabric always entailed a mixture of parrafin and beeswax, which was ironed out & then boiled out or drycleaned.  To me, this is worth the trouble because of the wonderful crackle you get which I dearly love.

But this DVD gave clear instructions on layering dyes and soy wax which builds a gorgeous softly blended richness on the fabric that you can't easily get with regular wax!  Then you just wash the resist out with hot water with no drain worries.  Galli's beautiful photography captured the exquisite resulting fabrics.  I am inspired and will definitely be trying this method!

8577287,5,B00C4MO7W4,Susan covered the subject completely.  She talked about the basics in the beginning (which I didn't need but great for someone who didn't already know this information).  Then she went into the details of the different ways of using soy wax as a resist.,1369267200,,253,4.7272727272727275
8577288,5,B00C4MO7W4,"I am a reader of Susan Purney Mark's blog (at [...] so I was eagerly awaiting this DVD. I wish I could give it 6 stars. Yes, it is THAT good! This is not the usual, simple stamping of fabric with soy covered objects. Many ideas presented were a first for me. Especially helpful is the link to 8 online pages of summarized points, recipes and safety. No need to take notes. Everything you need is here at this online document.  I especially love the use of soy wax with textile paints, discharge paste, freezer paper and shibori. Chapters are easily broken out by each individual project in a list on the DVD Chapter List. Makes it easy if you need to return to find an experiment. Well explained and demonstrated. Samples and in-process work are more than ample. Layers of color and design and Yummy and inviting. All information is straightforward, and there is no sales pitch for some ""proprietary mix"" of soy wax that I need to purchase to ensure the same lovely results.

The complete chapter list:
GETTING STARTED: -Preparing the Dye Solutions/Tools for Applying the Wax/ Soy Wax and Melting Appliances/Choosing fabric/Batching & wax removal/Color charts, journals and print tables.
