5410426,5,B00AEFXL5W,"You will fall in love with Audrey Hepburn.  I think that this is the best of her three big films (Roman Holiday, Sabrina).  She deserved best actress for this one and not Roman Holiday in my opinion.  Don't let the name  George Pepard throw you, this ain't no ""A-Team"".  This is a  classic romantic comedy, that portrays the life of two young New York bon  vivants, that survive on other peoples money, and find love with each  other.",915408000,,434,4.4743589743589745
5410427,5,B00AEFXL5W,"What a wonderful film.  Breakfast at Tiffany's is definitely a movie of mixed emotions,  but it is completely uplifting.  Audrey Hepburn is  always enchanting as the free spirited and endlessly loveable Holly Golightly,  and George Peppard is top notch as the writer who is meant to be with her.  The movie is full of memorable lines and scenes,  but the party scene is the one that is often deservedly remembered.  It is one of the best (if not THE best) party sequences in movie history!

5410719,5,B00AEFXL5W,"""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" has quite an intriguing premise.  Paul Varjak (George Peppard) is the quintessential starving writer who has prostituted himself by allowing himself to be kept by a rich benefactor (Patricia Neal).  Holly Golightly  (Audrey Hepburn) is the ultimate free spirit whose attentions can be bought for $50.00 to go to the powder room.  The key difference between the two is that Paul knows he has sold out whereas Holly doesn't.  Love blossoms between the two but can only come to fruition until both come to the realization that they are kindred souls.  It's interesting to watch both Peppard and Hepburn work here.  If there is no chemistry between the two the film fizzles.  Much has been made about Hepburn's flamboyant turn and Holly is probably the role she is most identified with.  That does not to diminish Peppard's performance whose stoicism anchors the film and keeps it grounded in reality.  This film was released in 1961 and I found it interesting how provocative material was tastefully handled.  George Axelrod cleverly adapts Truman Capote's source novel in order to comply with the standards of its day.  I can only imagine that if ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" were made today it would contain the requisite profanity, sex, and nudity but have only a fraction of the resonance this film does.  Also noteworthy is a heartbreaking turn by Buddy Ebsen as the country veterinarian whom Holly ditches for the bright lights of the big city.  Unfortunately Mickey Rooney's patently racist turn as Holly's Japanese landlord cannot be glossed over.  Inarguably the most offensive stereotype ever portrayed in a major motion picture, however, it's not a deal breaker.",1515888000,,1691,5.098181818181819
5410720,5,B00AEFXL5W,Great edition! Loved it!,1515715200,,24,5.25
5410721,5,B00AEFXL5W,"I love this movie, but I will state at the onset that to do so requires me to overlook the horrendously offensive racist portrayal of Mr. Yunioshi Mr. by Mickey Rooney.  Granted the character in on screen for maybe 8 minutes in total, but what at the hell was director Blake Edwards thinking? - even taking into context that this film made just over 15 years after the end of WWII.  There is no reason for this character to exit and I cant pretend its OK.

But the rest of the story is so well done it makes me willing not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  Audrey Hepburn as Holly and George Peppard, as Paul, have great chemistry in this story of two damaged and lost people who are willing to do what it takes to get on, each on the edge of their own personal disaster, and yet slowly find their way toward each other.

Hollys running from a past of terrible poverty, and essentially indentured servitude in a childhood marriage that she took on to give her younger brother a home.  Paul, once a promising writer, has lost his way and his confidence, existing essentially as the unhappy kept man boy toy of a wealthy matron.  Paul is amazed that not only does Holly not judge him, she understands why he does what he does.

Holly, because of her early experience now equates love with control, with a loss of independence, with a cage.  Frankly, based on her  experience and her past she's not wrong in her perspective.  For Holly, relationships now are about gaining financial benefit and she pursues rich men in a calculated manner (and making do with lesser men in-between to pay the rent).  But her search for the security that she seeks is always just outside her grasp because while she is now Holly, she can't let go of LulaMae - and the past she thought she left behind comes back to haunt her.

But through this unlikely friendship of these two misfits, each begins to change.  Paul is the first believe they can each have more, and are worth more, than what theyve settled for.  But Holly needs far more convincing, so deep are her wounds.  In the last minutes of the film, Holly commits an impulsive, self-loathing act that she immediately regrets and knows she must rectify immediately or never forgive herself.  In doing so, she finally realizes that in trying to escape the cage of her past, she simply built another one of different sort, this time of fear.  She finally figures out that while the wrong relationship can indeed be suffocating, the right love can be liberating.",1515542400,,2503,4.524444444444445
5410722,1,B00AEFXL5W,"I think this film has become a classic simply because of Audrey Hepburn's immaculate style: people have confused her flawless beauty and timeless fashion with what makes a good movie. Like, plot, acting, pacing, taste, et al, of which this film has none. The pace is coma inducing, Mickey Rooney's portrayal of the Japanese neighbor is jaw-droppingly racist, and if you can buy Audrey Hepburn as a former Arkansan I've got a bridge in Manhattan to sell you. Skip it or fast forward through every part where they talk and just pause it long enough to see what she's wearing.",1514592000,2,573,4.74
5410723,2,B00AEFXL5W,"Somehow I made it nearly through two thirds of a century without seeing this film.  I'll likely finish the century remaining without changing that.  It was bad enough when I read in the opening credits that Mickey Rooney was going to play a Japanese character.  It didn't improve when, after an admittedly impressive opening scene, Rooney shows up as said character, which he played like a racist stereotype, and badly at that, wobbling as he did between a Germanic accent (like some Austrian eccentric) and the New York street urchin he'd played decades before.  I got the feeling it was a routine of his at Hollywood parties and probably got a lot of laughs among like minded friends.

And then comes Audrey Hepburn, the elegant, divine, Audrey Hepburn (I can't remember what else I've seen her in, perhaps nothing? Perhaps it's all a construct?) and she babbles on like an Auntie Mame. It was the thing once---like the burbling actresses of the 'thirties, Margaret Dumont et al.  Of course we were coming out of the Eisenhower era with all its frumpy women with their frumpy clothes and sausage curls, and frowns.  How could you sail across the Atlantic on the Queen Mary and look so unpleasant?

Sadly, I just couldn't stand it.  It was a hit in its day, it's called a classic, but to me it has aged as badly as I have, although--to be fair--I don't come with a Mancini score.",1514505600,,1380,4.6460905349794235

5410735,1,B00AEFXL5W,"It was free and a so-called ""classic"" so we gave it a try.  I thought it was interesting just to see the period cars and styles of mid-20th NYC.  Didn't think it was poorly acted except the obvious goofy scenes and attempted humor.  My wife hated all of it even though we watched it through to the end.  Hollywood and their glamor worshipers have always been morally bankrupt and this movie fits right in for them.  Nothing redeeming or deep about any of the characters or the plot and even poor Cat is pretty miserable in a lot of it though he was our favorite character!  If you have anything at all better to do, don't waste your time with this one.  If you like to watch Hollywood awards, you will probably like it and think you are sophisticated.

5410748,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Holly Golightly has become a kind of achetype for any free-spirited, impulsive girl that you can name. The character was created by Truman Capote as the heroine of his short stories depicting life in New York City during the 1950s, and was played by Audrey Hepburn in this 1961 film adaptation. The role cemented Hepburn's star in Hollywood, and gave a much-needed boost to the acting career of George Peppard (many years before his A-Team days), who played the struggling-writer-turned-gigolo that is Holly's neighbor and eventual lover. Hepburn is definitely the star of the show however, with her portrayal of the eccentric, flighty Holly, who makes her living playing escort to rich businessmen. As the story progresses, however, it becomes apparent that this unusual girl is actually masking a background of poverty and fear, and is using her strange view of life to build a wall around her emotions so she won't be hurt again. Set against the backdrop of skyscrapers and high-priced department stores, this is a movie that tells an ageless tale of love and self-discovery.",1507766400,5,1078,5.061797752808989

5410750,5,B00AEFXL5W,"I first saw this movie when in college. I viewed it first on laserdisc. Before watching I didn't think much of the movie but it changed me a lot over time and for the better.

At the time I was single and very munch identified with the two characters. No I wasn't a kept man or woman but I did have things holding me back and was single and lonely. It was a philosophical time and while in college I questioned many times what really is true love.
This movie gave me a glimpse of that. The male lead was George Peppard who started out a kept man and Audrey Hepburn was in many ways the same. I won't give the ending out but it is a real tearjerker. Plenty of tissues are recommended.

This was in many ways a somewhat controversial film at the time it was made. It dealt with issues like selling oneself for money and has in more contemporary culture been criticized as being a bit culturally insensitive at times as Micky Rooney plays an Asian man. Buddy Ebson  also has a cameo where he plays a character that is a bit controversial in a way as well.

The primary issue in my opinion addressed here is would you pick money over love. Are you willing to change for love. In case you don't know the actors and actresses. Buddy Ebson was Jed on the Beverly hillbillies and George Peppard was Hannibal on the show the A-team. I assume most know Audrey and Mickey.  The viewer is treated to Audrey singing beautifully the theme song Moon River during the movie.

I would recommend this movie for people who enjoy costumes from the 60's. The soundtrack is beautiful and rendered by good old Henry Mancini. He won a Grammy for the music.

I highly recommend and my very favorite Hepburn movie.",1506124800,4,1688,4.356687898089172
5410751,4,B00AEFXL5W,"I loved this movie, from the wardrobe and costumes, the acting, and the beautiful movie theme song, ""Moon River""! The first time I watched this movie was in college. So tonight was my second time watching this Audrey Hepburn classic! I think it is pretty cool that Amazon puts little trivia facts throughout the movie so that you can get some background info about the making of the movie itself, and also how some of the actors and actresses felt during the filmmaking process! I actually did not know until I watched this movie tonight through Amazon that Audrey Hepburn herself was not necessarily the first choice on everyone's mind to play Holly Golightly, and that other actresses, such as Marilyn Monroe, were considered for the role at that time. I am REALLY glad that, in the end, the producers decided to cast Audrey Hepburn because I feel that she was a much better actress and had more talent compared to Marilyn Monroe!

What I did not like about this movie was the very racist depiction of Mr. Yunioshi (Holly Golightly's New York City apartment landlord). This movie was made during the 1960s when the United States was not completely accepting of all cultures, and its portrayal of Asians was really not too nice. But other than that, I really loved Audrey Hepburn's and George Peppard's classic performances, as well as the rest of the ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" cast! Furthermore, I love one of the very important lessons in life that Paul Varjak teaches Holly Golightly - money can not buy happiness. People do fall in love and want to belong to each other in hopes of achieving true happiness in life.",1506038400,4,1619,4.74113475177305

Hepburn and the other actors were perfect, especially the cat, and Moon River is a wonderfully sad song. The only complaint I have is the massive amount of cigarette smoking and boozing. However, that was the way it was in NYC among the people Capote depicted.
Some people are too shallow to understand movies like this, and you can see that in the one-star comments.

It was probably meant to be comic relief, but I found it very offensive.  The main characters were not at all appealing to me.  I actively disliked the promiscuous guy/boyfriend/male lead and didn't find him at all sympathetic.  Audrey Hepburn was a good enough actress and pretty enough that she had some appeal.  It's because of her performance that I gave it two stars instead of one.  Also well-done visually.

I found the ending quite stupid, as well.  She's cruel enough to throw a cat out in the rain to prove how self-sufficient she is, then once she suddenly finally admits she cares about someone, they go searching for the cat.  Predictable, obvious, and the usualy last-second 180 that is supposed to be dramatic and just comes off as ""typical Hollywood"" nonsense.  A movie has to have something else appealing in it for me to forgive a trite, predictable ending like that.  This one didn't.

I usually really enjoy old movies.  I loved Bringing Up Baby and It Happened One Night.  Those are cute.  This one I dislike and would never recommend to anyone, no matter how pretty Audrey Hepburn is.",1501545600,5,1221,4.747619047619048

What disturbs me is that these are not good characters, and considering the horrible way they treat their ""Johns"" (or ""Janes""), it's hard to care whether they find love or not.  Hepburn's character preys on older gentlemen with implied promises of companionship, presumably sex, and takes the money with no intention of fulfilling her end of the bargain, which really makes her worse than a prostitute.  The subtext of the story is that these men somehow deserve it, but that doesn't make it right to so shamelessly hustle them.  In the end, she's a quirky party girl who finds love, but I've always wished she'd had a redeeming moment when she sees the error of her ways and maybe just gets a job like normal people.

5410791,5,B00AEFXL5W,"This is one memorable classic movie. Holly (Audrey Hepburns character) is a woman who lives in a bubble, and she is a complete mess. She is basically a woman who is clueless and naive, and lives in a bubble to run-away from her painful past. She is, as another character put it, a real phony, because she actually believes the pretense and thinks that she is free (she doesnt even dare to name her cat for fear of getting attached to it).

Paul is a man who seems to be living an aimless life. He lives off his sponsor/lover, as he struggles to become a successful writer. He also lives in the apartment above Hollys. When he and Holly get acquainted, he gets intrigued by her messed up life, interesting quirks and nonstop chattiness. The more he gets to know her, the most inspired he is to write. Soon a desire in him to protect and take care of her, is awakened.

Both Holly and Paul fall in love, this leads Holly to run-away (being so afraid of love/attachment), while Paul instead straightens his life out so he can take care of Holly. Paul doesnt give up easily on Holly, until he finally breaks through her walls and facade. This movie is a very good romance/drama with quirky/goofy humor and character nuance that shows, instead of tells, the character growth a lovely movie.",1499472000,5,1285,4.510729613733906

I have not done an in-depth study, but coercing someone to have connection in order to have happiness isn't the best way. If she had learned about herself and become a strong person on her own without men defining her, I would have been more pleased. Instead, this is a journey about casual relationships leading to yet another man falling for her (albeit for different reasons), and and convincing her that her happiness is defined by having a longer connection with a person instead of finding herself first.

I know this opinion will be unpopular, and it doesn't reflect the time that it was made, but I believe that it would have been a stronger choice to not have someone repeating that they ""own"" her until they convinced her that ""ownership"" is a healthy concept.

Bad girl goes good - never happens in real life, nor did Capote write the story that way.  Still, much of the novella's dialog is kept and the acting is done well by both Hepburn and Peppard.  The time of the book is also the early '40's during the war, when 'party girls' were called 'glamour girls'.  By the early '60's they were called 'that kind of girl', I had it on good authority from my mother, may she rest in peace. Now they're called something else - rich guy's wives?

Many go to New York to seek their fortune - ""if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere"". The film is dated in that Holly wants to make her fortune not on Wall Street, or in real estate, fashion, or on the stage - but by marrying a rich husband.
But the story of moving to the big city and trying to find fortune and happiness is a timeless one.  Truman Capote suffuses Holly with his own troubled existence as master party host  - but finding little joy the in the party music, pointless conversations, and endless gossip.
Will love triumph and lead to a happy-ever-after ending? Or will the film end in new world, new age angst?

5410849,4,B00AEFXL5W,"Okay, okay in the interest of full disclosure I will admit that I was smitten as a teenager by Audrey Hepburn in the role of Holly Golightly in the film under review, Breakfast at Tiffanys. Okay, okay as well that some fifty plus years later I am still smitten by Ms. Hepburn in re-watching this film. There is something beyond the storyline here which after all is pretty much a variation of the small town girl trying to avoid being swallowed up by the big city, but also casting her fate with surviving by one means or another in that same big city. Something about a certain dewy freshness that transcends the ambiguous way that she was trying to make her way in the big city. (Under a less restrictive interpretation Hollys profession today would be called outright a call girl or at least a mistress-in-waiting but back then that dewy freshness created by a coded Hollywood would not tolerate such designations). So the thing plays out as a traditional boy meets girl love story of which about a billion filsm have now been made in all forms and in all languages.

Here is how a small girl in the big city and a down at the heels young writer with promise played out in 1961. Holly, Hepburns role, had been dazzled by the bright light of New York (unlike most small town girls with the itch to get famous who headed west to the Pacific Ocean to be washed clean by Hollywood). As the film begins it is obvious that the stylishly dressed and sophisticated Holly has worked out some compromise with the big city (and on those days when she was losing in the compromise department there was always Tiffanys to shelter her from lifes storms), has more suitors and admirers than she can shake a stick at. A party girl no question. Enter Paul Varjak, played by George Peppard, a budding writer who is the protg of a wealthy socialite who is footing his bills until he strikes gold in the literary world who moves into Hollys apartment building. (On this reading those who claim Holly is a call girl would be forced to concede that Paul is a gigolo making for an interesting pairing-but in the double standard of the time he is merely a protg and leave it at that). From about minute one they are attracted to each other.

No question if the film were produced today they would have already been under the satin sheets but then it had to play out as a game of cat and mouse (complete with Cat as the cat) because he had no dough and Holly was looking for the bright lights. So the film goes round and round with them in and out of romance. Mostly longingly out. But then fate comes into play. Holly who in the meantime during one of those out periods had taken up with a rich Brazilian to get married and have everything her small town dreams wanted, craved. Problem was that somebody fingered her place, her as a conduit for drugs (she had a weird companionship relationship with a godfather who doing time up in Sing Sing whom she visited every week for pay.). The proper Brazilian dropped her like a hot potato. Re-enter Paul and in the rain they have all their sins washed away by true love (but still no satin sheets). Yeah, I had a crush on dear Audrey and I got that hard facts re-confirmed in this one. Classic early 1960s film if not exactly what Capote was getting at.",1481673600,,3276,4.422185430463577

5410907,3,B00AEFXL5W,"This is one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen Audrey Hepburn in, and I own a collection of them, from Laughter in Paradise, starring Alastair Sim, who played Ebenezer Scrooge in the 1951 version of A Christmas Carol, to Always, starring Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter.

In this film, Audrey plays a tramp - poor, white trash from the country, who, dissatisfied with life with her bumpkin husband, played by Beverly Hillbilly, Buddy Ebsen, leaves him to live an extravagant lifestyle at the expense of foolish men she meets at parties and cons into supporting her extravagance because they find her so attractive and think they can buy their way to into this heartless woman's panties.

It's very heart-breaking when Buddy's character finally tracks her down, and explains to one of her would-be lovers who this shameless tramp really is.

Orientals should presumably find the portrayal of her always angry, Asian neighbor with buck teeth, coke-bottle glasses, and a thick, humorous accent offensive.

I would only recommend this film to collectors of Audrey Hepburn memorabilia, and fools who need to learn you can't necessarily buy your way into a woman's panties, much less her heart!",1468454400,,1200,5.0761421319796955

As if the mind-numbingly boring plot-line, weren't bad enough, the hammy overacting and sappy dialogue made me want to gag throughout the movie that I watched to the end, for perhaps the same reason one pauses to watch a fender-bender on the freeway. The person responsible for the appallingly racist casting of Mickey Rooney as ""Mr Yunioshi"" should quite simply have been shot!

5410936,4,B00AEFXL5W,"Starring: Audrey Hepburn & George Peppard. Produced by Martin Jurow and Richard Shepherd. Music by Henry Mancini, Screenplay George Axelrod. Directed by Blake Edwards

Genre : Romantic Comedy

Storyline: Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) was a aspiring and hyperactive social escort girl who left her husband ending her child marriage in search of wealth and fame to support herself and her brother Fred, working in Army. Her long cherished wish was to buy something at Tiffanys, an up-market jewellery store in New York. She tries to get into relationship with rich men of USA always and in the meanwhile be-friends her neighbor, Paul Vajrack (George Peppard) a small time writer. Paul falls in love with Holly but Holly never accepts the same due to her long cherished wish of becoming rich. She fails in all her attempts to hotfoot rich men and finally gets into a drug racket unknowingly due to which her sure shot marriage with a rich Brazilian falls apart. Just then even her brother Fred dies in an accident. The movie ends with a happy note when Paul explains her that the path she chose to become rich was wrong and would finally end up nowhere. She then realizes her mistake and accepts Pauls love after she was left with no-one in the world.

Pros:  One of the best Classics of the 1960s which brought name and fame to this Hollywood actress from Belgium. The shy and introvert actress in real life shows her real talent with her eccentric performance that can be remembered for a long time. The Director was quite successful in portraying the truth of anyone not being successful through short cut methods, through this beautiful story. I liked the way the actresss emotions were shown in the climax rain scene in the car when Paul reads out the letter from her Brazilian fiance and he makes her understand everyone belong to each other and no matter wherever she runs, she would finally end up in her own cage and thats nowhere. Thats how she rediscovers herself and runs back to Paul. Loved the way Holys life was compared to that of her cat in the end, both having no meaning to their lives, without belonging to someone who love them. Music and Screenplay were one of the best anyone could experience, in this movie.

Cons: There were many speculations about Hollys role as a Call Girl or Social Woman. Her choice of path after breaking her marriage in this film was not accepted by many of her fans worldwide. Though there were many instances where her role was portrayed as a call girl, it was always shown as narrow escapes from such highly objectionable sexual encounters, in those days.  But I would like to ask the author as to whats the real character of Holly? Was it a sense of insecurity or inferiority complex that drove her behavior?

George Peppard held his own and was able to pull off the character with no problem. the movie was done very well and i thought had great actors, director, and great character actors. the story was well written so what else can i say. i guess by now you have figured out i love this movie so i can only say i hope those that do watch it that haven't yet enjoy , or at least give it a chance as it was done in the days when acting was more important than computer Graphics.  i do enjoy those as well but i do love great acting-take this for what it is worth-not much just a personnel observation, but i loved it",1461024000,,1014,3.9950738916256157

5411239,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Timely classic...from an era when movies were written for the intelligent viewer. Scandalous plot (poor southern girl, turned American geisha, unknowingly working for the Mob meets handsome, struggling writer/gigolo) is presented in a modest and witty way. The scenes in which the interest and romance build between Holly and Paul are tastefully titillating. Hepburn is beautiful, charming, playful and unthreatening (I read that Marilyn Monroe and Steve McQueen were intended to play the leading roles. Monroe declined the role per the suggestion of her acting coach for fear of the image it would reflect on her as an actress. Good choice. Monroe would have been too sexy for the role. ). The burlesque scene in the middle of the movie was a bit too much for me. It didn't lend anything to the plot of the movie....like all blockbuster cinema it was probably added for the benefit of the male viewership...much to the delight of male teenage movie goers of the time, I'm sure!",1453334400,,978,4.969512195121951

5411276,2,B00AEFXL5W,"Last year, I read Truman Capote's novella in my ongoing effort to fill in the cracks of my liberal arts education.  Loved it.  Capote is a master of the written word, and he understands the nuances of personality and moral ambiguity in a way that the reader can empathize with a character's (bad) choices despite shaking one's head.  Even sticks in the mud (like Yunioshi) have a certain charm when put to Capote's pen.

The film, alas, lacks Capote's shine, wit, and wry affection, instead going for a more straightforward (if not ham-handed) romance.  It turns Capote's writer/narrator -- who admired Holly and felt close to her but never became romantically involved -- into her mirror-image (complete with ""decorator"" sugar mama -- a role played fantastically by Patricia Neal).  Neal practically steals the show with her final appearance, whereas I was more put off by Hepburn's Holly (or worse -- felt sorry for her).  George Peppard as Varjak conveys a certain Hemingway-esque emotional flatness, which gives the viewer little to root for.  When he accuses Holly of living in a cage of her own making, I had two conflicting thoughts:  ""it's about time!"" and ""why the heck would he fall for her anyway?""  The ensuing smooch (with cat squished between them) is more of a puzzler or yawn-inducer than cathartic romantic relief.

But what really sinks ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" for the modern viewer is the utterly abhorrent and embarrassing depiction of Mr. Yunioshi, the cranky upstairs neighbor, by a stilted Mickey Rooney (complete with abnormally large false teeth).  The opening scene manages to encapsulate most of Hollywood's atrocious Asian stereotypes, and the rest pop up at various intervals throughout the film.  To say that they are cringe-inducing does not adequately convey how truly awful these scenes are.  They would be unforgivable even if the rest of the film was a success; but since it is not, I feel a two-star rating is actually rather generous.",1447372800,4,1972,5.027692307692308

But I watched on, as every detail from Capote's brilliant and delicately-balanced novella was butchered - almost every detail altered, key characters, settings and scenes completely omitted, and even the period, 1943, changed to 1961 - with all its nauseating chic fashions. The result is that none of the characters are the least bit likeable, but completely repulsive, ugly human beings, for whom no one could have any sympathy, a story that goes nowhere, and nearly two hours of my time wasted.",1437868800,7,839,5.086956521739131

5411309,5,B00AEFXL5W,"*** This review is for the blu-ray. Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961) is a classic film that's very much the style of a Blake Edwards film from that era: plush, sophisticated, and bits of humor sprinkled in, very much in the manner of a film he directed a few years later, The Pink Panther. However, this is a tad different in genre (romantic comedy), and Audrey Hepburn stars in probably her most memorable role. I'm not going to delve into the plot here, but will say that the story is paced very well, and has a special message that resonates at the very end. Audrey is very chirpy in her role, and radiates charm and beauty all at once. This blu-ray is one of the better restorations of movies from the early 60's, in that it has sharp picture quality and sound, so you will get your money's worth. The special features are good, too.",1437264000,2,834,4.422077922077922

5411332,4,B00AEFXL5W,"Paramount's 1961 movie version of Truman Capote's ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" may have changed the character of Holly Golightly from the one the author had in mind in his short novel, but the movie provided Audrey Hepburn with a trademark role.  Her blend of big-city polish and back-home navet have delighted audiences for over five decades, and the movie remains one of Hollywood's most-engaging and popular romances.  So, it's only fitting that Paramount afford the movie a 50th Anniversary, high-definition Blu-ray edition.

Holly is the spunky, free-spirited ""party girl"" who revels in her worldly lifestyle.  It is a telling comment on the early 1960's that no one in the film ever refers to her as a call girl, nor did audiences then or now seem to notice or care.  In any case, she's a phony, in a reality not the classy, glamorous, sophisticate she pretends to be but a small-town girl from Tulip, Texas, who has gone to the big city of New York to find herself.  She winds up accepting money from gentlemen for ""going to the powder room.""  When she gets a bad case of the ""mean reds""--that is, when she feels downhearted--she heads off to do some browsing at Tiffany's jewelry store, where she feels comfortable and safe; it's the symbol of everything she wants in life, like elegance, class, style, and wealth.

Then she meets a new neighbor in her apartment building, Paul Varjak (George Peppard), a would-be writer being ""kept"" by a wealthy older woman (Patricia Neal).  Holly and Paul immediately become soul mates, and the story chronicles their on-again, off-again relationship.  So, basically, we've got the curious situation of a prostitute and a gigolo falling in love.

Buddy Ebsen plays a patient but not-too-understanding veterinarian from back home in Tulip.  Martin Balsam is a fast-talking Hollywood agent who's trying to get Holly into movies.  Jose-Luis de Villalonga is a Brazilian millionaire Holly tries to marry.  And Alan Reed is a mob boss, Sally Tomato--a combination Joe Bonanno and Lucky Luciano--that Holly visits on a weekly basis in Sing Sing Prison.

The only jarring note in the cast is Mickey Rooney's portrayal of a racially stereotyped Japanese-American.  It was an accepted stereotype of the day, and one I'm sure a lot of people thought was daringly funny, but I guarantee it is offensive enough to make anyone today cringe in embarrassment.  Times change, in this case for the better.

While the first half of the film does a good job sticking to Capote's vision, in traditional movieland style Holly is far more vulnerable here than she is in the book, and the filmmakers provide a much happier, fairy-tale ending.  We'll never know what the movie might have been like without them, but we do know that these elements play a big part in what audiences have always loved about the film.

By and large, the story remains appealing, even if a few short stretches can be tedious, and the urbane, worldly-wise humor can seem more than a bit pretentious.  It's also more than a little depressing from today's standpoint to watch an entire cast smoking and drinking itself into oblivion.  As always, Ms. Hepburn is lovely to look at, even if her dreadful hats are not.

Blake Edwards directed the film (""Days of Wine and Roses,"" ""The Pink Panther,"" ""10"") and Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini collaborated on the words and music for the Academy Award-winning theme song, ""Moon River,"" with Mancini winning a further Oscar for his background score.  Additionally, the Academy nominated Ms. Hepburn for Best Actress, George Axelrod for Best Writing, and a slew of people for Best Art Direction and Set Decoration.

Video:
Paramount video engineers restored and remastered the picture, which shows up well enough in the Blu-ray high definition, BD50, MPEG-4/AVC transfer.  The original aspect ratio, 1.85:1 (1.78:1), seems almost quaint by today's standards, but it does its job in displaying most of the necessary sights of New York City.  The Technicolor is vivid without being too bright or forward.  It does have a kind of muted smoothness to it, however, instead of a flashy gloss, as though the engineers applied some filtering to remove excessive noise and grain.  Fortunately, definition and black levels are more than adequate, even if skin tones don't seem exactly right.

Audio:
The audio choices are lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and restored Dolby Digital monaural.  The DTS-HD Master Audio projects a reasonably wide, effortless front-channel stereo spread, but only on some musical tracks does it utilize the rear speakers for ambient reflections.  Otherwise, it's fairly clear, still limited in dynamics and frequency range compared to newer releases, but offering a warm, pleasant bloom on the music.

Extras:
The 50th Anniversary Blu-ray Edition contains all of the extras previously found on Paramount's two-disc Centennial Collection Edition.  They begin with an audio commentary by one of the original producers of the film, Richard Shepherd, whose laconic remarks are informative and authoritative without being exactly sparkling.

Next up, we find a range of items pertaining to the film, the star, and the studio, most of them featurettes, some of them made for the Centennial Collection in 2008, others made for the 2005 DVD.  First up is ""A Golightly Gathering,"" a 2008, twenty-minute segment in high definition in which several of the actors from the movie's cocktail scene reunite to reminisce.  It's kind of fun, even though it's also sad to think that most of the film's major stars are dead.  Then, there's ""Henry Mancini:  More Than Music,"" a 2008, twenty-one-minute high-def piece on the composer.  After that is ""Mr. Yunioshi:  An Asian Perspective,"" seventeen minutes, 2008, also in high def, in which various Asian filmmakers comment on Mickey Rooney's atrocious Japanese stereotype and the role of Asian actors and filmmakers in Hollywood through the years.

After those items are yet more featurettes:  a four-minute tour of the Paramount studios, ""Behind the Gates:  The Tour""; ""The Making of a Classic,"" sixteen minutes on the adaptation of the Capote story for the screen; ""It's So Audrey:  A Style Icon,"" eight minutes on Ms. Hepburn's delicately simple style; ""Brilliance in a Blue Box,"" six minutes on the history of the famous jewelry story; and ""Audrey's Letter to Tiffany,"" two minutes on a letter Hepburn wrote to preface a book about the Tiffany store.

The extras conclude with an original theatrical trailer in high def but not restored; galleries of production, movie, and publicity stills; fourteen scene selections; bookmarks; English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese spoken languages and subtitles; English captions for the hearing impaired; and a slipcover for the flimsy Blu-ray Eco-case.

Parting Thoughts:
There's no question ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is an exceptionally perverse picture for a romantic comedy:  a gold-digging call girl, a gigolo, a marriage at fourteen, a racial stereotype, and a whole cast smoking and drinking themselves into an early grave.  Nevertheless, the movie maintains a spirited bounce in its step that is still infectious today.  The ending aside, it also maintains a good distance from any obvious sentimentality.  Viewers who like the movie remain diehard loyalists for life.  Although it is not among my own favorite films, it surely has its charms.",1432944000,2,7378,5.1313807531380755

5411349,2,B00AEFXL5W,"I need to learn not to watch movies from the '60's and '70's, because I just don't get them. Despite the all hype surrounding it, this movie fell into this category.

The good: the song Moon River, which might've been my favorite song as a kid. And unlike a number of other reviewers, I liked George Peppard's character of the writer Paul Varjack the best. All the others were so over-the-top, including Holly, that watching him play a normal guy who'd just lost his way was a relief.

The bad: Oh, my. Where do I start? Yes, Andy Rooney's caricature of the Japanese landlord was painful. They couldn't find a real Japanese to play the part? Really? And Holly's treatment of her pet cat toward the end of the movie was totally despicable. Most of the movie was annoying, but that made me really angry.

If this was supposed to be a comedy, I have to admit that I don't find a lot of humor in watching a seriously emotionally disturbed woman use and abuse the people around her. Okay, she's got problems and probably can't help it. But funny, it's not. ***SPOILER ALERT*** Honestly, I just didn't buy the happily-ever-after at the end. I suspect it wouldn't be long before Paul got treated the way poor Doc did.

Overall, I was only occasionally engaged by this movie, and I think I only laughed once. I don't know how it came across to audiences in 1961, but for a viewer in 2015, many of the scenes went on far too long. The party scene in particular made me come dangerously close to turning off the movie. The only reason I didn't was because I was determined to see why this movie is still remembered and talked about today. Unfortunately, I still don't have the answer to that question.",1428796800,4,1691,4.48051948051948
5411350,2,B00AEFXL5W,"Audrey Hepburn's signature role. This may be chick heresy but -- I don't worship at the throne of the emaciated Ms. Hepburn.  She was a fine actress and a beautiful woman but the stuff of rabid admiration?  I don't see it.  Sorry. The movie is only mildly entertaining, probably because Hepburn's character, Holly Golightly, is so annoying.  She drinks too much and shoplifts for kicks.  She makes a living going to parties(She's never called a prostitute but it's pretty obvious she is.) and delivering messages for a crime boss in prison.  Why this rather unsavory woman is the idol of so many females is rather hard to fathom.  And the cuteness is just too, too much:  a cat she calls ""Cat"".  Using her earrings as earplugs.  A sofa made from a bathtub.  A library consisting of one book. Keeping her shoes in a bowl of fruit.  And
so on.  This may have been delightfully daffy in 1961 when the movie was made but it's pretty tiresome stuff today in 2015.  And Mickey Rooney's impersonation of a Japanese is cringe-worthy. Based on Truman Capote's novella, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", Holly was inspired  in part on Broadway dancer Joan McCracken. McCracken's life story would have made a more interesting movie.  BTW, Capote wanted Marilyn Monroe to play Holly.  How interesting would that have been?!

.
BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S won Hank Mancini a pair of music Oscars. Audrey Hepburn also was nominated for Best Actress.

There's many legends (some verifiable) surrounding this classic drama:
1.) Truman Capote wanted Marilyn Monroe to play call girl Holly, but she thought the role would be bad for her image.
2.) Jean Seberg and Kim Novak were considered for Holly before the film's producers decided on Miss Hepburn.
3.) Steve McQueen was offered George Peppard's part but was unavailable.
4.) The film doesn't follow Truman Copote's story.
5.) It DOES follow his story.
6.) 19-year-old Holly likes herb, has a dirty mouth, once terminated a pregnancy and dates both men and women.
7.) Her brother Fred also isn't ""straight.""

And so on.

Sight aione verifies the obvious:
Hepburn's rare beauty is ideally enhanced by an exquisitely accessorized black sheath dress. Mr. Peppard is equally as pulchritudinous and they make a gorgeous couple. Their bittersweet rainy alleyway scene at story's end is one of the most emotional moments in cinematic history.

Mickey Rooney is highly annoying (and incredibly un-P.C.) in his comic relief role as a mule-toothed, Coke bottle eyeglass-wearing Oriental. Buddy Ebsen defines acting perfection as Holly's abandoned husband, come from the country to NYC to bring his ""Lullamae"" home.

Blake Edwards' early masterpiece is a complex tale of a mercurial young lady who freely accepts cash gifts from men, is most at ease in overcrowded, swinging cocktail parties, and at her neurotic worst when alone with the one man she's attracted to, a handsome young author of a single book who struggles to write anything new. Theirs is a beautiful love story with tragic overtones that's one of this reviewer's all-time favorite movies. Highest recommendation!

With its award winning theme music by Henri Mancini, and song (""Moon River"" which was almost cut from the film) ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is that rare film that shines with deep and quirky characters sans big screen special effects and gratuitous action.  Hepburn's performance as a plain woman who doesn't really know what she wants from life, but aspires to live the life of a rich socialite, combined with George Peppard's more down-to-earth charm as a non-motivated writer, bring them together as the objects that make sense of the odd and quirky scenes they find themselves in.  ""Cat"" is the added spice they both need to discover they are actually in love with each other, and Mickey Rooney as Mr. Yunioshi, a cantankerous ""Mr. Miyoshi"" type upstairs neighbor, balance out the story.

Audrey Hepburn's character is a nutcase And her sob back story does little to justify the way she is. My fiance picked this hoping for a romantic date night.

5411410,5,B00AEFXL5W,"For most viewers, this beautiful movie with beautiful Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard... colorful Mickey Rooney, lovable Cat, gorgeous wardrobe and showing only the best New York neighborhoods is just glamourous, fun, nothing depressing about it. But having watched it several times as well as read Truman Capote's novella on which this movie was based, there's a much deeper story and character study.

What do you think the Martin Balsam character meant by Holly Golightly ""is a phoney but a real phoney""? She is shallow, only caring about her brother Fred, not someone who rescued them (Doc). Were you so distracted by the eye candy to overlook the facts that she's a prostitute whose goal is to marry a rich man and he's a gigolo? Her clients use her, she even uses her Japanese neighbor as a door man. She is afraid to commit to an meaningful relationship, even to a cat. The George Peppard character's patron demeans him. Eventually, Holly insults him. He got himself out of it with a 'real' job and tells his patron 'it feels good to help someone' meaning Holly who is worse off than he. So this movie is a moral tale.",1426550400,,1124,4.7055837563451774

5411415,1,B00AEFXL5W,"Honestly I never got this movie and don't understand the high regard in which it's held. It just strikes me as a bunch of spoiled, well-to-do people hanging out together, smoking and drinking, and this is supposed to be 'sophisticated.' Oh, well, this was the early Sixties and that decade just doesn't wear well over time.

The good news is that it's in COLOR!  You get to see George Peppard shirtless a little (and for the early 50's / 60's, that's quite an accomplishment!)  The truth is, this movie is boring, predictable and not worth your 2 hours.",1426118400,,442,4.141176470588236

5411465,1,B00AEFXL5W,"This movie has always been up on a pedestal for me, and boy, did it get knocked off once I actually viewed it in its entirety. The lead male and female are despicable characters who never evolve, both of them willing to sell themselves to rich patrons so they can live a lavish lifestyle in New York City. The plot, based very loosely on a novella by Truman Capote, is wafer thin. It's more like a Neil Simon wannabe. Mickey Rooney, cast as a bronze-faced, sputtering caricature of a Japanese landlord, is an insult both to his career and Asian Americans. George Peppard's performance is wooden and unbelievable. Audrey Hepburn, Hollywood icon that she is, lacks humanity and class.  Afraid to love, afraid to think, she's seemingly rescued from herself in the final rain-soaked minutes of the film, but the audience has no assurance that once she dries off, she'll don another stunning Edith Head outfit, light another cigarette, throw down a double of Bourbon, and look for the next sugar daddy to charm out of a 50 dollar bill.",1425081600,22,1030,4.722222222222222

5411515,5,B00AEFXL5W,"It seems to me that Breakfast at Tiffanys is one of those films that everyone has seen.  The iconic Audrey Hepburn look, the Johnny Mercer song, Moon River, and the class of old New York.
I had read the Truman Capote novel but have only seen pieces and never the whole movie.
On a cold winner day, I decided to take the plunge. The movie is about Holly Goligtly (Audrey Hepburn) whose safe place is Tiffanys department store. With all the glamour and glitz, nothing bad can ever happen there.  This movie takes you to the early sixties where there was still a sense of style and glamour.  The party scenes are fun and the story cute.  This girl is trying to make it and break free from a forgotten past.  Doesnt hurt that her love interest is a neighbor writer who is played by a very young George Peppard.
Breakfast in Tiffanys is one movie everyone should experience.  Wilson Trivino",1422662400,,885,4.46583850931677
5411516,3,B00AEFXL5W,"So, the famous ""Breakfast at Tiffany's. I can see how this was popular in it's time. But, this is 2015. Mickey Rooney's portrayal of a Japanese character is offensive. Also, it appears to me the cat may have been mistreated.",1422144000,,224,4.625
5411517,2,B00AEFXL5W,"I finally, finally saw this movie.  After hearing the accolades around ""Breakfast"" for nearly 40 years, I finally sat down and watched it.  I wish I hadn't.  Honestly the movie is dated, it drags, is only passingly true to the novella, and overall is just uninteresting.  Actually the acting is quite good -- even Roony in yellowface, once you get over how offensive his character is to a 2015 audience.  But the writing is subpar and the movie just drags and drags.  I wish I'd just left this as once of those ""classics"" I never got around to watching.",1421971200,2,553,4.5353535353535355
5411518,5,B00AEFXL5W,I have heard about this movie as long as I can remember. I finally watched it. I can see now why people say they can watch it over and over. Simply lovely:-),1421971200,,157,3.9375
5411519,3,B00AEFXL5W,"I didn't see this movie when it came out in 1961, and now, over fifty years later, I've seen it for the first time.  I would say that it hasn't aged well.  When it came out, it probably seemed bold and saucy, but in fact it lacks the courage of its convictions.  You have to believe that Holly (Audrey Hepburn) and Paul (George Peppard) are credible objects of desire, but in fact neither generates any sexual heat at all, and when one remembers that they make their livings by sexual arrangements with people not their spouses, the whole set-up seems a bit implausible.  The movie works by playing down the sex and trying to make us believe that these two are rather innocent, like children who have not yet fully grown up and are perhaps afraid of growing up.  Holly would like to be able to afford what Tiffany's presents to her gaze, but she has no plan to find a way of earning consistently what she would need to acquire what Tiffany's has to offer.  Marriage for money is the best she can think of -- and the men in the movie who seem able to offer that possibility are presented as, in various ways, untrustworthy and unlikeable.  So in the course of the film, she and Paul have to get (or be got) to a place where they are willing to take a chance on one another despite their lack of funds.  Paul gets there first, and he gets Holly there by facing her with a charge of cowardice, in a scene that follows a horrific scene of cruelty involving a cat . . .

Paul's charge of cowardice stings, because up to that point Holly has been presented (and has presented herself) as a free, and even ""wild,"" spirit.  We learn in the course of the movie that she had an earlier life in Texas as the child-bride of Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebsen) and that her real name is Lula Mae Barnes.  It's never clear what has driven her wild, but her marriage to Doc seems to have been her first effort to reinvent herself and her life in New York -- the motive for which is murky -- is another.  When she meets Paul, who lives on the floor above in an apartment rented for him by the married woman who ""keeps"" him (an unpleasantly icy Patricia Neal), she fastens on or imagines a likeness to her brother Fred, and she calls him Fred for much of the movie.  What exactly is she afraid of?  Doc Golightly doesn't seem rich, but he clearly has enough money to keep her, and he doesn't seem to treat her badly.  She has a line of patter that passes as worldly wisdom and yet has never been in a library?  I think we (the audience) are meant to be so charmed by her quirkiness that we don't want to raise the questions about coherence and plausibility that (50+ years on, at least) cry out to be asked.  Audrey Hepburn's performance is hard to assess -- her character's life is a performance in itself -- but it seems mannered, and in seeming mannered, her  (Hepburn's and/or Holly's) credibility as a focus of sexual power is compromised.

Finally, a word about Mickey Rooney and his Japanese character Mr Yunioshi.  The running gag is that Holly's goings-on are always disturbing him, and he's always threatening to call the police.  Rooney's make-up as a comic Japanese man is grotesque, and I've read that many Japanese viewers of the movie find it offensive.  Well, I'm with them -- and I'm not even Japanese.  It's not only insulting to Japanese; it's insulting to the idea of good comedy.  Nonetheless, the movie perhaps deserves its place in National Film Registry having been deemed  ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""  This is what passed for comedy in 1961 -- it's good to know that and to hope that it represents one mistake that we won't repeat.",1421884800,5,3661,4.451274362818591

Hepburn manages an American /  Southern accent in the beginning but just totally reverts to her British accent later.  The portrayal of Asians I found distasteful, but interesting to see how far we've come.

5411580,5,B00AEFXL5W,"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S is such a rare film. Audrey Hepburn is Holly Golightly. There is and was only one. It is hard to describe the attraction of this film, yet it still captivates me every time I view it. I think it has something to do with the time and place when it was made, a carefree time that exists no longer and a time when new mores were coming into vogue. It has an IN quality about it, yet underneath it all, there remains a search for what life is really all about and what really makes us happy, in a fulfilling way, after all those cocktails have been downed and the cigarette smoke has cleared. I suppose there is some comment being made about the morality of the lifestyles of both Holly and Paul (George Peppard) Varjak. Both seem to subsist on the money of others (Holly from her numerous men friends and Paul from his older female sexual benefactor Patricia Neal). Hepburn gives her character a glossy veneer of sophistication and a detached indifference for meaningful love and relationships from the opposite sex. Peppard in a very good and underplayed performance seems to be her conscience even though he has a difficult time putting his own life in order. Through all the partying and merriment I found Buddy Ebsen's performance as Doc to be the most touching and moving. He seemed to represent a yearning for a much more simpler and tranquil lifestyle, truly loving his Holly to make it all complete. Ebsen's performance is heartbreaking, as he must leave his Holly in a world very foreign to him, leaving the void in his heart still empty on his journey back home. I think Peppard sees this and knows he must change his ways and also those of Holly for whom he is so attracted. This is a truly wonderful entertaining and rewarding film working on so many levels. Adding to the overall effect is Henry Mancini's timely score that is so vibrant, elegant and sentimentally moving and captures the essence of the story so satisfyingly.",1414368000,,1959,4.616045845272207

Andrews Blu-ray Review  'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is an endearing romantic comedy, now celebrating its fiftieth year in existence, though it hardly feels half that old, save for the obvious extreme baby face of its star. Its saccharine sweet, yet often reminds us of the sour moments that come along from time to time, an interesting character-driven feature based on the novella by Truman Capote. Every genre staple is present, save for the predictability that ruins the potential enjoyment of many a film of this ilk. A true classic in every sense of the word, 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is hilarious in a tongue-in-cheek fashion, while at the same time a quirky look at attachment, love, romance, and all things sassy.

The lead character, Audrey Hepburn's Holly Golightly, is a sort of enigma. She has the tendencies of a call girl, only without the sleaze. She's a gold digger looking to marry into wealth rather than work for it, who can't save a dime due to her inherent need to buy expensive jewellery, to present herself like a million bucks, hopefully to someone whose bank account is north of that amount. A social butterfly who borders on co-dependency, she's afraid of being tied down, and may not exactly be the world's best neighbour. A tease, a flirt, a possible phony, she's a woman with skeletons aplenty in her closet (or powder room), representing the refined single woman years ahead of her time, the unattainable goal.

'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is a film without a real structure, free from some nagging plot necessity or contrivance. It's storytelling simplicity, covering the dealings between Holly and her new upstairs neighbour [George Peppard], a writer who is instantly smitten with the free spirit, who is very much like her, an ambiguous prostitute of sorts, only his work gets published. From the opening scenes, where the strangers meet in the most peculiar (and endearing) of fashions, 'Tiffany's' moves forward at an ever-increasing pace, acting as the perfect anti-romance romance. It's a tale of opposites attracting, with the structured, polished life of the writer upstairs being somewhat thrown to the winds of change that represent Holly, whose home is very fitting as a temporary domicile, no matter how long she's been there, replete with an unnamed animal for those lonely, lonely nights.

What makes this magic film so memorable goes beyond the amazing performance from the ageless beauty. Sure, that's the hook for the film nowadays, but this is a great look at life and love, about fear and hope, ideals versus realities. The constant conflict and personality clash between the two leads is the perfect catalyst for the ""plot."" We see a man who thinks he knows best for a young woman who would instantly disregard any advice given to her, no matter how precise in analysis it may be. We find out she's made her mistakes in the past that have crafted who and what she is, and we get to peek under her carefully constructed mask, to see her inner beauty and ugliness, as her layered character and the exploration thereof is obviously the focal point of this tale.

'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is a rare cinematic feast. It's a romantic comedy that doesn't age, and may even get better with time. It contains genuine drama and believable characters, the by-product of their respective environments, a mix of two different worlds melting together into one, whether both like it or not. It's a film where the male romantic lead doesn't inspire the urge to want to punch him in the throat. A film where the romantic gestures are the ones that cost the least, where the interactions are genuine and natural, the lived-in characters coming alive in that all-too familiar way. It's genius both in performance and in writing, as well as iconic, memorable and wonderful memorable ambience.

Blu-ray Video Quality  It's one of Paramount's most prestigious, well known, beloved titles, and it won two Academy Awards (even if they weren't for Best Picture or Director). Also, this Blu-ray release got the treatment synonymous with that failed label, so it would have been fitting. Basically, I'm not all that impressed with this Blu-ray release. Paramount's 1080p encode for the film is littered with issues that didn't have to be.
'Breakfast at Tiffany's' has a lot going for it here. There's not any real dirt or scratching to be seen, no print damage, no wobbling. Colours are bold (though there's a slight neon/bleed to a few short moments of extremely strong, bright colour, like the red rose in the jacket lapel in the early goings), warm and inviting, while flesh tones aren't all that bad, sometimes a little flush but mostly believable. Black levels are utterly perfect, while picture depth is regularly impressive. A real short, few frame blip can be seen at the 46:27 mark, as a face makes an odd shift, but I'd say that issue is at fault with the materials used for this release, not the encode image itself.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  There are two audio options for 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' in the native English language (dubs are available, as well): a restored mono track, or the disc's default, a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio mix. Mind you, this isn't some bizarrely matrixes film, as the rear channels only come into play for the Mancini score elements, and bass is unheard of. It's just a slightly more modernized feel to a classic film, spreading the amazing music in the room the way it should be heard. Can't say enough good words about the way the score makes the film feel like a classic Disney animation at times. It's...wonderful.

Fans will be happy to hear this disc does a very solid job with presenting a natural listening experience, free from any sore thumb moments. There's fantastic clarity in the score, with amazing distinction between instruments, and a great mix ensures that we always are capable of hearing this intricacy and beauty. Naturally the film itself is front heavy, but dialogue only has one or two odd lines that don't fit in with their respective scenes (due to odd volume jumps and brief drops in sharpness), with solid dynamics, and some nice separation here and there. I noticed a few minor bits of static, but they were very few and far between. What concerned me more was the fact that the music doesn't always creep to each channel like I would have expected. Still not much to complain about here, a real solid good track.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Commentary by Producer Richard Shepherd: With Richard Shepherd. This is not a fun listen. Shepherd blurbs up in the credits saying he'll discuss people later, and frequently just describes what is on screen, not behind it. At times, he seems afraid to talk over the film, as the gaps usually time out that way. He gives witty observations, like how typewriters are outdated (oh that zany Shepherd!), talks up some powder room action, and generally makes less-than-wry comments at random, with no rhyme or reason. One won't miss a thing if they skip this track. I'd actually recommend it.

A Golightly Gathering [HD] [20:00] A reminiscence of the cocktail party in the film, with a few actors who were in the scene. It's funny how minor parts get their chance to talk about the experience so long ago. A fun retrospective, which is very unique.

Henry Mancini: More Than Music [HD] [21:00] A look at the man behind the music of the film, a legendary man in the business, told through those who knew him. Fantastic. That's a good word for this one. The title of this feature tells the tale, as it starts on music, but then goes on as those close to him talk about his quirks and eccentricities. Fantastic.

Mr. Yunioshi: An Asian Perspective [HD] [17:00] Controversy! This character remains an arguing point even to this day due to the modern political correctness movement, to the point that some activists protest the film's showing in public areas. Is it racist? A number of Asian activists discuss the entire issue rationally, with logic rather than emotion. Also, yellowface. Never heard that one before. It's an odd piece, as it doesn't touch too long on 'Breakfast at Tiffany's,' but damn is it a good one.

The Making of a Classic [16:00] A more classic look at the film, as a whole, compared to all of the other extras, which are so insignificant in scope, no matter how interesting they may be.

Its So Audrey! A Style icon [8:00] We really needed a feature about Audrey, considering her fame and prominence, and remembrance primarily in this role, so here it is! Yep, this woman sure was gorgeous, and a style icon, indeed. She made anything look good.

Behind the Gates: The Tour [4:00] A tour of Paramount Pictures, mostly through pictures. An interesting piece, though it's mostly fluff.

Brilliance in a Blue Box [6:00] - A feature about the jewellery of Tiffany & Co., including a famous, one-time world's largest canary diamond, as well as the evolution of the accessories.

Audreys Letter to Tiffanys [2:00] Audrey Hepburn's words to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Tiffany & Co back in 1987.

Galleries: Three galleries, covering the film, production, and publicity assets. I really liked the publicity section, as the modelling shots are fantastic, evoking that different age in cinema, so long forgotten. Sadly, there are no random posters or half sheets or other adverts.

Original Theatrical Trailer [HD] [2:00] A very old timey trailer for the film. It definitely looks beat up.

Finally, you know what Blu-ray needs, more Audrey Hepburn. There just aren't enough films starring the ageless beauty and amazing acting talent on this format, with this release marking just the second title in her filmography to make the leap. Thankfully, we're two for two in terms of titles that are among her best, the unforgettable or iconic films or roles. This adaptation of a Truman Capote story is a superb crafting of character development and analysis, a believable, enrapturing story of love and its many complications. It stirs controversy these days due to Mickey Rooney's Asian performance, but I wouldn't change a damn thing with this film. The universality of its basic message, that love conquers all, even money, prestige, past mistakes and the embracing of simplistically good virtues such as caring and understanding, combined with a wonderful sense of humour and one of the best performances ever committed to film, make Breakfast at Tiffany's an endearing classic that's easily one of Hollywood's finest Romances. Paramount's Blu-ray release of Breakfast at Tiffany's features stellar video, great audio, and a good assortment of extras and that is why it is a great honour to add this to my ever increasing Audrey Hepburn Blu-ray Collection. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

I don't feel the content is morally fit for a 14 year old premarital sex, adultery, alcohol abuse, smoking, child abuse in that Doc married a 14 yr old child.

Honestly, we thought it was awful.  In the 1960's, I suppose this film was breaking the rules in regards to sexuality, which is probably what made it popular, along with the fashion statement.  The story line is rather simple, acting isn't remarkable, and Audrey Hepburn's character is a complete ding bat, and nearly crazy.  We felt like ""you've got to be kidding me"" as we watched it, thinking ""this is the iconic film that people have been adoring for 50 years?""

5411663,2,B00AEFXL5W,"Truman Capote hated the casting and I'd have to agree that it's wrong right from the start.
Audrey Hepburn plays, ....well more Audrey Hepburn really.
We are supposed to believe men are beating a path to her door as some sort of successful call-girl, but she comes across as an unstable anorexic beatnik. I wasn't sure if she was trying to put angst into her shallow performance, ...or was it just that she hadn't eaten for a week? There's no characterisation here, ...just Hepburn as you've seen her in every other movie she's been in.

George Peppard is hardly ""leading man"" material. He just looks quite uncomfortable with the lines he's forced to say.
He tries restraint but it comes across as constipation.

But the killer for me was the inclusion of Mickey Rooney as the irate ""Japanese""(?) upstairs neighbour!

Rooney gives one, if not THE most racially offensive performances since Al Jolson black-faced up to sing ""Mammy""!
Complete with stereotypical glasses like the bottoms of coke bottles, buck teeth and the corniest of accents, I simply cannot believe how his gross and insulting turn ever made it to the screen!
Surely an Asian actor could have been employed to give just a little dignity to the role?

I never found Rooney to be anything great as an actor but this time it's just NOT funny in the extreme!!!
I kid you not! It had me squirming at first, then angry!
I'm surprised his repeated turn didn't set off another bombing of Pearl Harbour!

The marmalade cat puts in probably the best performance, but THAT inane song gets way too much play, ....just what the hell is a ""huckleberry friend""?

Yes, I know this a was something of a ""hit"" back when, but now it's dated in the extreme.
I just wanted to slap Holly Golightly or whatever her idiotic monicker was, ...and HARD!
(Particularly when she tries to chuck drama and carry on like some spoiled two year old brat.)

You just cannot understand why the Peppard character even wants to know her, much less ""rescue"" her.

Enjoy the iconic opening shot of Hepburn in the black dress getting out of the New York cab in the early morn and having her ""breakfast at Tiffanys"" out of a paper bag, but for me that's about it.

I just didn't care for any of the characters at all, and Rooney just leaves a VERY bad taste in your mouth.
Two stars for me, .....neither of which are for Rooney, ....and I never want to hear that imbecilic Mancini saccharine song again!!!",1396828800,2,2430,4.619489559164733
5411664,5,B00AEFXL5W,This was a very good movie.  It would probably help to read the book first or a summary.  The movie under plays what Holly and Paul really are.  When you see Buddy Ebsen you will realize why he ended up as Jed Clampett.,1396828800,,219,4.046511627906977
5411665,2,B00AEFXL5W,"Been digging into the really old films lately. Watched Roman Holiday and I loved it. Decided to watch Breakfast at Tiffany's because it is the film that made Audrey iconic.

After the glorious intro, it was awful until the last 20 minutes when the plot tightens up. The characters, I did not care for anyone of them. Everyone (including the bit players) were either uppity snobs, jerks or selfish people. If I told you I'm a grown man who stole stuff for fun to bond with a girl I like, you all would have the worst impressions of me. Breakfast at Tiffany's was a character study but does a poor job at it. You can have dis-likable characters in a movie and still be interested and engaged by what they do, but I didn't care for these people at all...big difference.

I love Audrey's performance. Audrey carried this movie with her charm, her lithe figure, and her voice. But I didn't like the character she was playing (if that makes any sense) and found it really hard to care what happens to Holly. Replace Audrey with someone else and the movie might very well been trash with nothing to fall back on. The movie felt pretentious and there was no flow to it. The dialogue for the characters was long and bookish. Throwing dialogue continuously at the screen does not amount to a smart film, it's like throwing a bunch of brush strokes at a canvas and calling it mind-provoking art. That opening scene conveyed more to the viewer than anything that was said.

I wanted to like this movie because I love Audrey in Roman Holiday but Breakfast at Tiffany's is for hipsters. It gets by on style and glamour, not by the plot nor its characters.",1396742400,6,1641,4.5
5411666,5,B00AEFXL5W,Breakfast At Tiffanys involves a woman who has impeccable social skills and manages to become known in high society circles. She meets a writer who becomes a major part of her life and contributes to her personal evolution.

5411668,5,B00AEFXL5W,I haven't seen this movie since it came out in the late 1950's but it was such a good movie at that time that the story stayed with me all these years.  It was nice to see it again and to note that I remembered it as well as if I had seen it just a few years ago.  It's a testament to the great acting and story that it has stood the test of time unlike so many movies made today that are forgotten almost as soon as you leave the movie theater.  Henry Mancini's score is of course classic  -- who doesn't know Moon River-- and it's a delight to hear Hepburn sing it along with playing her guitar.  If wish though that I had seen this DVD on a large screen TV that would have more of the Cinnemascope feeling that we got in the movie theater.  It was one of the early ones done in that way.,1396483200,,790,3.875776397515528

If you are a book purist, however, it is not the same. Since it was made in the 60's for a mainstream audience, homosexuality references from the book have been removed & the prostitution angle downplayed. Still, it's a great story, suburb acting, and fashionable set design. Newbies welcome.",1396396800,,455,4.62962962962963

5411677,1,B00AEFXL5W,I had heard of this movie most of my life. When I finally viewed it I thought it would be very classy given the way Audrey Hepburn is shown on the cover. I didn't care for the plot. I didn't like nor was I sympathetic to the characters. I just found them to be shallow and uninteresting. Perhaps I'm missing something here but I really didn't enjoy it and felt the time viewing it was a waste of time.,1395705600,3,401,4.0886075949367084

5411696,2,B00AEFXL5W,"I was expecting a fantastic show but was really disappointed.  Hepburn bothered me up until the end, not owning up to anything.  I was upset that the main male character loved her/still wanted her with how she was acting/treating him--especially at the end.  I will not watch again",1393632000,,281,4.8125
5411697,3,B00AEFXL5W,"I guess in its day this was a groundbreaking movie. The Story is about a Writer that moves into an apartment building and is supported by an older woman that is having an affair with him. He meets a younger woman that dresses really well but it is all a show to get men to take her out and pay her to have sex. It is a messed up New York 1960's drama. Sex, booze, parties etc, pervade the movie as the man falls in love with the younger woman and convinces her to fall in love with him. It is at the beginning of the free love and rock and roll generation of debauchery. Viewed now, this movie is contrite and at times ridiculous. It is a period piece and it must be noted at the scenery that sets the movie in stone. The cars, the phones, furniture, etc. There is no Breakfast at Tiffany's except a bagel early in the morning before Audrey Hepburn goes home at the beginning. It makes me think that she is finishing her production breakfast before the movie is shot.
That is why I am going to buck the trend and only give this movie 3 stars. To me, it is a low budget movie that had well known stars set in a contemporary setting at a time that this nation was breaking out from traditional norms.
It has officially become quaint, as an avant garde piece in the study of our American culture.",1393545600,,1293,4.155378486055777

5411767,4,B00AEFXL5W,I saw this movie many years ago as a young teen and liked it a lot. At that time I didn't notice the raw racism in the role of Mickey Rooney as an Asian man. It has all of the stereotypes for the Japanese. The movie itself is very good and rather liberal for the time period and worth viewing. You just have to get past the one character.,1389657600,,338,3.9130434782608696

She didn't get all the nuance but I enjoyed watching with her knowing that we were sharing a film that has now spanned many generations. Love this flick!,1389139200,,428,4.3625
5411784,4,B00AEFXL5W,I was always a fan of old movies but had never taken the time to watch this movie all the way through.

A bit of this would have been OK to establish the story line, but there was little content.

It was a beautiful movie, and a classic, Audrey Hepburn plays Holly Golightly a flighty socialite in New York who lives the life you hear about in New York: parties, schmoozing with wealthy people, and the women are all looking for those wealthy benefactors to ensure a steady lifestyle with them. But then Paul a writer who moves into Holly's building falls in love with her and shakes up the life that Holly had been working to achieve.

5411799,4,B00AEFXL5W,"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY's might be a tad long, and Mickey Rooney's performance as a Japanese neighbor is simply an embarrassment, but Blake Edwards' narrative never fails to maintain the attention.  Chiefly this is due to the two central performances: Audrey Hepburn's Holly Golightly is at once maddening, engaging, winsome and vulnerable - we can empathize with her desire to discover herself, while trying to retain a basic freedom of spirit.  This is no easy task in New York bourgeois society where everyone is out for what they can get, both materially and physically speaking.  Throughout the movie she believes she has found what she is looking for, only to be frustrated at every tick and turn: no one is quite what they seem.  As the writer - and kept man - Paul, George Peppard tends to be reactive rather than proactive; the kind of person who would prefer to remain in the background, especially when confronted with Holly's so-called 'friends.'  However the film suggests that Paul possesses a kind of basic integrity that everyone else lacks; he might not be able to earn any money, but he can offer Holly emotional stability.  The ending is predictable yet haunting; neither Paul nor Holly know what will happen to them in the future, but at least they can live for the moment.",1388534400,,1290,4.840909090909091

George Peppard and Audrey Hepburn are terrific as is the rest of the cast, especially Buddy Epson playing Audrey's ex-husband, Doc Golightly.  But, the Asian neighbor, Mr. Yunioshi, portrayed by Mickey Rooney was awful - and took a lot from the movie. Here you have a very classy movie with excellent actors and then they cast Mickey Rooney as an indeterminate (was he supposed to be Japanese, Chinese, Korean, or what?) acting as a stereotype Asian.  Insulting to Asians everywhere I would think, and says something about that time in our history.  I understand times have changed since this was produced in 1961, but still, couldn't they have found a real Asian actor to play the role.  Mickey Rooney?  Terrible choice!  Otherwise great movie and everyone falls in love with Audrey.",1388188800,,820,4.898550724637682

Blake Edwards is one of my favorite movie makers, he get's humor the way I do. Audrey Hepburn is a dish! She is pretty, athletic, smart and capable of physical and verbal humor. The sets are nice, the dialog is solid and the music isn't overbearing. It's also interesting to see what New York looked like and felt in the 70's. The film has good continuity and is easy to watch.

First time seeing this movie and was shocked at the blantant sexism and the emptiness of all the characters....Regardless of the book vs the movie argument and the obvious Japanese stereotype---this was a deeply sick female who was abused  at a young age and from a poor background and had to marry some old grandpa when she was 14! She runs off to the city and becomes a self destructive hooker----I mean a 'Pretty Woman'....waiting for another old guy or a 'daddy' with money to take care of her....the part in the movie when she is crying over the death of her brother---a little too weird of a relationship, she is in her 'baby-girl' room and all you see is the shadow of the older south american 'daddy' figure....obvious symbolism of her past abuse....it's so Project Monarch...sad part is, this crap happens everyday in Hollywood and countries all throughout the MiddleEast, Africa, India, Mongolia, China  etc...Children that are forced into 'trama' become 'fractured' individuals---multi-personalities and have id confusion---they are stuck in the 'child-like' stage and can't and won't grow up----Project Monarch, look it up...
Funny how everyone is so defended on the Japanese stereotype---which of course would never be protrayed today, but no one is offended of the hateful stereotyping of women....which continues to be seen all over media today...you males have grown up in being educated on not offending men of different races, but with women in many countries who can't vote, human trafficking, honor killings, poverty---where is your anger and disgust?.....oh well, it's all so newworldorder--signing off.",1383696000,,1736,5.170818505338079

Audrey Hepburn was impossibly beautiful and never more beautiful than she was in Breakfast at Tiffany's.

Some have commented on Mickey Rooney's Asian character. Yes, it's pretty bad.  But the year was 1961 and there were still millions of men not quite forty years old who fought in World War II.  I'd save the self-righteous anger for the war and not the stupid character.",1383091200,,586,4.696078431372549

For feline/animal lovers, the cat, who plays Cat, is also especially winsome and sympathetic in this very stylized romantic tale.  Even if Audrey's wardrobe is very suspect assuming her role's financial status, suspending disbelief is all worth it for those very few minutes when Audrey herself croons the classic, poignant ""Moon River"" theme song.",1382745600,,604,5.02
5411886,4,B00AEFXL5W,"This is an older movie that somehow I had not seen.  I was surprised and, in some ways, disappointed.  Not your usual romantic comedy.  And, Audrey Hepburn's role was not stereotypical.

The scene is New York featuring a walk-up apartment building and residents. The leading man (George Peppard) was a youngish man trying to find his way.  Hepburn's role was an attractive and interesting person who, it was revealed, had an unusual history.  But, she was more sophisticated than one would expect knowing her background.

It ends with a ""Happy Ever After"" ending, but one doubts that it will be lasting.  The Hepburn character seems too unstable to stay in the relationship.  The Peppard character seems destined for disappointment.

Interesting, but unlikely and not very believable. I enjoyed it but I'd doubt I'll watch it again.",1382745600,,832,5.051470588235294

It's also got some anachronisms courtesy of Mickey Rooney that show us how far we've come.

You can't help but think that this was New York when it was at its zenith after WWII...a city on top, embued with the optimism that sad people needed to remake themselves in a new world. Is the film as gritty as the book? No.  But it doesn't really matter.

5411901,4,B00AEFXL5W,"The GENERAL lesson of the fictional story (that a young woman who is a ""butterfly,"" needs to stop being a ""butterfly"" and instead settle down into a true constructive loving relationship with a proper man) is extremely excellent.  The scene near the end of the play, where [after the man (who was fed up with the destructive attitude of his ""butterfly"" girlfriend) angrily leaves] the woman puts on the little ring and bursts into tears -- BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT HE WAS 1000% RIGHT -- IS CERTAINLY TOTALLY AWESOME!!

(And that so very emotional scene was superbly played by the AAA1 main actress of the play, Audrey Hepburn.)

There are a number of problems though, with the movie:

1.) There is an explicit scene of the woman and the man in the man's bed, in which the man is shown with his naked chest.  This is all totally unnecessary and drags the picture down into the realm of smut; that it touches onto the line of  ""male pornography"" is, of course, severely, severely sick!!!!

2.) In the fictional story, soon after the young man and the young woman begin their relationship, the man is confronted by the woman's husband!  In turn, the man confronts the woman; she assures him though, that the marriage with that husband had been annulled.

The man also had some kind of a relationship with another woman, which he eventually breaks off.  The play is not clear at all exactly what kind of relationship it was; the man simply called her his ""interior decorator,"" but it is obvious that it was more than just a business venture.

This is a major problem with countless soap opera stories: That in the story of a man and a woman who are developing a relationship, the man, or the woman, or both of them, are also in some kind of a relationship with someone else or in a question of a relationship with someone else, which thus puts the ""main"" relationship of the story into the realm of either being illicit or a question of being illicit.

Story writers cannot seem to make a ""straight"" story of a single man (with no attachments!) and a single woman (with no attachments!) who are developing a proper legitimate relationship!

3.) In the fictional story, when the man and the woman are out having an enjoyable day together, the woman tells the man how she used to have ""fun"" by stealing from dime stores and not getting caught.  She thus ""dares"" the man to do that with her now; they thus both go into a nearby store, and manage to slip out unnoticed with two stolen masks.

Now, in the context of the story, the woman's perverse enjoyment of this stealing is clearly part of her ""butterfly"" nature.  At the same time though, stealing, even just a ""tiny bit"" from a dime store, is, of course, a very terrible crime.  So it was wrong for the play to present this incident -- of them BOTH doing it -- as if it was just some ""harmless"" ""fun.""

Instead, the made up story should have ideally been that the man refuses to do the shop-lifting (and he dissuades the woman by suggesting to do a different -- legitimate -- fun activity).  If that scenario would not fit in with the character of the woman, then the story should have been that, after the incident, when he is not with her, the man brings the two masks back to the store.  He apologizes to the store owner and either returns the masks or pays for them.",1381795200,,3316,4.4858569051580695

5411913,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Audrey Hepburn is Holly Golightly. There is and was only one. It is hard to describe the attraction of this film, yet it still captivates me every time I view it. I think it has something to do with the time and place when it was made, a carefree time that exists no longer and a time when new mores were coming into vogue. It has an IN quality about it, yet underneath it all, there remains a search for what life is really all about and what really makes us happy, in a fulfilling way, after all those cocktails have been downed and the cigarette smoke has cleared. I suppose there is some comment being made about the morality of the lifestyles of both Holly and Paul (George Peppard) Varjak. Both seem to subsist on the money of others (Holly from her numerous men friends and Paul from his older female sexual benefactor Patricia Neal). Hepburn gives her character a glossy veneer of sophistication and a detached indifference for meaningful love and relationships from the opposite sex. Peppard in a very good and underplayed performance seems to be her conscience even though he has a difficult time putting his own life in order. Through all the partying and merriment I found Buddy Ebsen's performance as Doc to be the most touching and moving. He seemed to represent a yearning for a much more simpler and tranquil lifestyle, truly loving his Holly to make it all complete. Ebsen's performance is heartbreaking, as he must leave his Holly in a world very foreign to him, leaving the void in his heart still empty on his journey back home. I think Peppard sees this and knows he must change his ways and also those of Holly for whom he is so attracted. This is a truly wonderful entertaining and rewarding film working on so many levels. Adding to the overall effect is Henry Mancini's timely score that is so vibrant, elegant and sentimentally moving and captures the essence of the story so satisfyingly.",1379376000,,1915,4.618768328445748

Moving into her apartment building, the down-on-his-luck writer Paul immediately grows fond of Holly's quirky personality. Considering each other simply friends, Paul comes to one of Holly's wild parties and they journey through New York together. However, although Paul is falling for Holly, his circumstances seem to prevent it and besides she is oblivious to his affection. Slowly they fall farther apart with Holly's upcoming marriage to a wealthy man. In the end they do reconcile, embracing in the rain (of course). Holly has finally found a man who truly loves her and does not use her. The love story is an interesting one and Hepburn gives a lively performance.

5411955,5,B00AEFXL5W,"It's the kind of story that is as much for the men as it is for the ladies. Probably every guy out there has met a girl something like Holly before. She's beautiful, free spirited, unique, and also mysteriously quirky. She's the kind of girl that seems impossible to understand. In fact I have met girls just like her. The character George Peppard plays has more patience with a girl like Holly than most men today seem to have. I admired this character a great deal. Every young girl wants a sensitive, caring, handsome, gentle, and accepting male friend they can play cuddles with without any serious commitments. Someone to be there and to listen. And best of all there are no strings attached and he's always there when you need him. Holly is the kind of girl that can drive a man crazy with confusion and bewilderment. But she is representative of many young females. Men like our leading man here are few and far between. Most would have given up long before he does. he is genuinely more concerned about the well being of others than for him self. In today's world men like him are thought of by some as pushovers. But he in fact is a rare breed of a man that seriously earns the respect of his peers. Now Holly Golightly does seem a little crazy, but She's a hell of a lot of fun to hang around even if her life is a bit of a mess.

Surely they could have found a male Asian actor (ironically there was an Asian woman in a background scene) to play the role and eliminated the bafoonery.

5411961,2,B00AEFXL5W,"I had heard that this was a ""classic"" movie, a ""must-see"", and perhaps Audrey Hepburn's best performance.  Quite frankly, it was none of these for me.  I will posit a contrary view and flatly state that I did not enjoy this movie.  The best part of the movie by far was Henry Mancini's classic song, ""Moon River"" (it won an Oscar for best song).  Watching Audrey sing this song (while pretending to play a guitar) was the high moment of the film.  Now that I have seen the movie, I don't consider it a classic, nor do I recommend it as a ""must-see"".  As far as Hepburn's best performance, I thought her work in ""Wait Until Dark"", and ""My Fair Lady"" was much better.  The film is about a quirky, disorganized, insecure woman, Holly Golightly (Hepburn,) who does not know who she is, so she looks for security by attempting to marry and have someone take care of her.  Peppard's character, who also finds himself in a situation where he is dependent on a woman who pays him for sexual favors, realises he loves Holly GoLightly (Hepburn), and is willing to risk everything to share a lifetime love with her.

My chief complaint about the film is not with Hepburn (she is wonderful as Holly Golightly), or George Peppard as her leading man; no, the film falls short for me in the script.  For me, the script was not compelling, romantic, or even that funny (the film is billed as a romantic comedy).  One severely dated character in the film is the role of Mr. Yonoshi, played by Mickey Rooney.  He (unfortunately) uses every Japanese stereotype in the book in a comedic way, as Hepburn's apartment manager.  By today's standards, Rooney's characterizations are offensive and completely tasteless.  (Yet, this is 1961, and before the era of political correctness).

I realize others rate this a 5-star movie.  When I compare it to other 5-star movies, in my opinion, it falls far short of the mark.

5411983,5,B00AEFXL5W,"This is my third favorite among Audrey Hepburn films.  First is Roman Holiday and the second is My Fair Lady.  But playing the part of Holly Golightly (Truman Capote's unique creation) in Breakfast at Tiffany's is I think Audrey Hepburn's most challenging role.  Her character is subtle and complex while George Axerod's excellent script and Blake Edwards's fine direction require a wide range of expression.  Her performance is for the most part outstanding and certainly captivating as is usual with Miss Hepburn.  There are moments of pure delight as when she sings ""Moon River"" sitting on her window sill on the fire escape and then looks up and sees ""Fred"" AKA Paul (George Peppard) and smiles that very winning smile at him.  Ah, to have Audrey Hepburn smile at you!

I also loved the scene when she enters Fred's apartment and lets him know she has figured everything out and then asks to snuggle with him and puts her head on his chest so sweetly, like the innocent little girl she once was.

But of course Holly Golightly is not innocent.  She is a poseur, a fake, or as Berman puts it, ""a real phony.""  She is the kind of poseur you meet in any big city, a quasi-sophisticate who, like the real life Paris Hilton, is more or less famous or well known for being famous or well known.  She is also...well, perish the thought, but she makes a living by taking advantage of men, or like a geisha by entertaining them.  I read somewhere that Marilyn Monroe turned down the part of Holly Golightly because she or her agent felt that playing a prostitute would not be good for her career!  The way Audrey Hepburn plays the part, and indeed the very character of the real-life Audrey Hepburn herself, precludes any thought that Capote's upscale big city waif could be anything so crass as a prostitute!

This is of course a love story, a romantic comedy and a splendid one.  Paul ""Fred"" Varjak is a writer being kept by 2-E (Patricia Neal in an unattractive role that she should have turned down).  Paul is at the stage of his career when he begins to falter and lose confidence in his ability, and--as Holly notices--fails to even have a ribbon in his typewriter.  He has become a poseur himself, a man posing as a writer who is really just a gigolo.  It is part of the magic of the script that one can hope that somehow his love for Holly will inspire him to regain confidence in his ability as a writer and allow him to throw off the shackles of being kept by an older woman.

Miss Golightly herself has other plans.  She wants to marry a millionaire and live happily ever after.  She has a beloved brother (the real Fred) who will be getting out of the army soon.  He is a little bit slow and probably will not be able to take care of himself.  She believes that if she marries well she will be able to take care of him.  But in truth Holly Golightly is in escape from her past, from being the country girl Lula Mae who married an older man when she was 14-years-old.  She ran away from the country and hid in the city.  She wouldn't be the first.  She never wants to test herself; she will not fall in love.  She subsists on a diet of ""rats and super rats"" and finally on a ""scared little mouse"" and none of them make for a good subsistence.  Can't she see that she needs to love and to allow herself to be loved?

Mickey Rooney as Mr. Yunioshi, a buck-toothed Japanese man, is a hoot and holler and amazingly transformed.  Also  stealing a few scenes from Audrey Hepburn (if that's possible) is ""cat,"" or as I understand, several orange tabby cats who play the part of Golightly's cat who has no name and is only called ""cat.""  (Obviously she hadn't read T.S. Eliot's poem on ""The Naming of Cats"" otherwise she would know, as all cat lovers know, that every cat must have at least two different names.)

Okay, for the fun of it, here's a speculation on a theme that may someday become a PhD dissertation at some place like UCLA or USC:

Was Holly Golightly a kind of Truman Capote alter ego, a kind of person he would have liked to have been, perhaps the object of the desire of the man that Truman Capote wanted to attract?  Perhaps Holly Golightly is the soul mate of George Peppard's character.  It is interesting to analyze or attempt to analyze Breakfast at Tiffany's in terms of Truman Capote's psyche.  It's almost impossible to think about her character without thinking about him.  Perhaps it is better to just experience the character of Holly Golightly without the realization that she is the creation of Truman Capote.  Knowing who Truman Capote was forces us to think about Holly Golightly in a way we would not if she had been the creation of someone what was not gay.  One thinks of Elton John's tribute to Marilyn Monroe in his song ""Candle in the Wind"" and wonders if being a gay man somehow gives one a unique sense about women.  Instead of seeing women as objects of desire as heterosexual men do, perhaps Truman Capote and Elton John are able to see woman in a more objective sense.  Not entirely objective of course, but in a way that allows them to appreciate the woman in a way not colored by sexual desire.  One might say that other women should be able to also achieve such a perspective, but their view may be clouded by competitive feelings or by a jealous distinctly different than something Truman Capote or Elton John might feel.

Or perhaps the story is just an elaborate joke that Truman Capote played on the world.

At any rate the bottom line is that Breakfast at Tiffany's is a totally original, sweet and delightful romantic comedy with all the fluff we expect in a romantic comedy with only a hint of the stark realism of the world.

5411985,5,B00AEFXL5W,"BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S won Hank Mancini a pair of music Oscars. Audrey Hepburn also was nominated for Best Actress.

There's many legends (some verifiable) surrounding this classic drama:
1.) Truman Capote wanted Marilyn Monroe to play call girl Holly, but she thought the role would be bad for her image.
2.) Jean Seberg and Kim Novak were considered for Holly before the film's producers decided on Miss Hepburn.
3.) Steve McQueen was offered George Peppard's part but was unavailable.
4.) The film doesn't follow Truman Copote's story.
5.) It DOES follow his story.
6.) 19-year-old Holly likes herb, has a dirty mouth, once terminated a pregnancy and dates both men and women.
7.) Her brother Fred also isn't ""straight.""

And so on.

Sight aione verifies the obvious:
Hepburn's rare beauty is ideally enhanced by an exquisitely accessorized black sheath dress. Mr. Peppard is equally as pulchritudinous and they make a gorgeous couple. Their bittersweet rainy alleyway scene at story's end is one of the most emotional moments in cinematic history.

Mickey Rooney is highly annoying (and incredibly un-P.C.) in his comic relief role as a mule-toothed, Coke bottle eyeglass-wearing Oriental. Buddy Ebsen defines acting perfection as Holly's abandoned husband, come from the country to NYC to bring his ""Lullamae"" home.

Blake Edwards' early masterpiece is a complex tale of a mercurial young lady who freely accepts cash gifts from men, is most at ease in overcrowded, swinging cocktail parties, and at her neurotic worst when alone with the one man she's attracted to, a handsome young author of a single book who struggles to write anything new. Theirs is a beautiful love story with tragic overtones that's one of this reviewer's all-time favorite movies. Highest recommendation!

(7.8) Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961) - Audrey Hepburn/George Peppard/Patricia Neal/Buddy Ebsen/Martin Balsam/John McGiver/Alan Reed/Stanley Adams/Mickey Rooney (uncredited: Nino Tempo/Mel Blanc)",1358035200,,2055,5.423197492163009
5411986,5,B00AEFXL5W,"A strength of a movie is measured by how much I remember 15, 20, 25 years later.

This movie I saw only once in the mid 1990s, and I remember so much of it: the Moon River song, the Kansan ex husband, the gigolo, the mole...

It is really haunting.

Too bad the movie in typical Hollywood style changes the ending from tragic to happy all ok, in denigration of the original Truman Capote book on which it is based.

Also very typical Hollywood: racist, unfunny Japanese man portrayed in yellowface by Mickey Rooney.  That part was disgusting.  It was, ""let's depict the humanity of the beautiful white female low social class prostitute, but let's stereotype the Asian man.""

Despite this huge flaw and handicap, it is still a great movie, that's just how good it is.",1357948800,,767,4.554744525547445
5411987,5,B00AEFXL5W,"I went through nearly 40 years of life before seeing this film for the first time - what a mistake!  I'd been brainwashed into thinking it was a lightweight romantic comedy about a flighty yet fashionable girl who likes fancy clothes and jewelry - not really my cup of tea.  But that does not describe this film at all - in fact it has a dark and gritty subtext to it even if you haven't read the book (and I haven't). Holly Golightly is a naive small-town southern girl who's abandoned her family and is pretending to be a New York socialite - and while she's not specifically called a prostitute in the film, it's definitely implied (what else could ""I get paid $50 to go to the powder room"" mean?). She initially identifies with her upstairs neighbor because he's a gigolo (also implied but never outright spoken) - a profession she makes clear she ""understands"". This actually forms the basis of their relationship, because both clearly know they share a common secret. I don't know if audiences in 1961 picked up on these cues but I'll bet they did - to me, it's pretty obvious.

Audrey Hepburn's charm brings a depth to a character that would seem crass and manipulative in the hands of a lesser actress, and when her naivete eventually gets her in legal trouble and her various plans for tricking wealthy johns into marrying her fall apart, we still root for her to finally find happiness.  That's the magic of Audrey in this film and many others.

What struck me about this film when I first saw it was how much it reminded me of people I knew in New York in the 1990's (true, I did hang around with a certain crowd).  It's a timeless film - there are people and stories like this out there, even now.  I actually found it very realistic.

Lots of people have talked about the casting of Mickey Rooney as the Japanese landlord and I don't disagree that this was a mistake (Blake Edwards doesn't either, which he explains in the special features), but it's the one blemish on a film that otherwise holds up just as well today as 50 years ago.  You do have to look at certain things in a historical context.  There is one documentary segment in the special features devoted to this, so nobody involved with this disc has tried to ignore this aspect of the film.

The Blu-Ray transfer is the best I've personally seen this film look - which admittedly isn't too many times, but I can't imagine it looked much better in 1961.  It really looks like it might have been filmed last year, almost like a period piece set in 1960 rather than a film actually shot in 1960.  It doesn't have that ""old film"" look that so obviously dates other classics from that era as the source material has aged before it could be restored or preserved.  It's beautiful on this disc, perfectly color balanced and clean and sharp enough to easily see the soft focus filters used on Hepburn's closeups, the imperfections in the optical film effects (fades, composites), or changes in the film grain depending on the scene (as you'd expect with different film stocks).  There doesn't seem to be a lot of noise reduction in this transfer - just an attempt to get the film to look like it would have when it was first released.

There are quite a few special features as well, although unfortunately none with Audrey Hepburn or George Peppard, not even an old interview they might have done about the film, or any promotional appearances from 1960 (or maybe they never did any?  Seems unlikely).  The closest we get is a featurette on Hepburn as a style icon that includes some nice photos.

Still, that's like complaining about getting an ice cream sundae complete with five scoops of ice cream (all different flavors), hot fudge sauce *and* caramel, whipped cream and nuts on top... but there's no cherry!  What's here is more than enough to justify a purchase.",1357430400,2,3839,4.560407569141193

5411991,5,B00AEFXL5W,"This unforgettable 1961 romantic comedy,""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" was taken and translated to the big screen from Truman Capote's classic novella. Directing this timeless classic is Blake Edwards, who is also the director of some other memorable pieces such as, The Great Race, in 1965 along with The Pink Panther, in 1963.
  With  ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", being a much more heartfelt story, Edwards impressively still managed to keep it upbeat while still making sure to balance it out with the proper sentiment. Taking the lead role of Holly Golightly, is the beautiful Audrey Hepburn, while her new neighbor and future love interest, Paul Varjak, is played by the handsome George Peppard. Holly's light hearted and entertaining character brings her and Paul, or ""Fred"" as she likes to call him, closer together rather rapidly, while keeping  the audience engaged. Holly lives all alone in a rather empty apartment with a ""poor nameless slob"" cat, surviving off of the fifty dollars her alternating wealthy dates give her for the powder room. Unlike Capote's novella, Edwards makes sure to keep Holly's lifestyle and choice of career much more vague and casual in the film. Rather than making it flamboyant that she's a prostitute, rather he has the film more centered on Holly's desire to be wealthy and marry a man solely based on his financial status.
Fred, along with the audience, falls head over heels for Holly knowing that she's a ""wild thing"" and doesn't want to be loved or ""owned"" by anyone. ""To know her is to love her"" is the proper phrase to use when it comes to describe Holly, one can't help but to love her great charisma and innocence. Although she feels money will buy her her happiness, she doesn't know how to act once reality hits her and she finds her true happiness in being with Fred.
  Holly Golightly's character is simply delightful and it's quite hard to resist her innocent charm. As Fred starts to fall for the ""untamable"" Holly, so does the viewer. In my opinion this movie is truly a five star classic, the acting is phenomenal and the characters are relatable and engaging, while Edwards remains to keep Capote's storyline classy.",1355788800,,2166,4.904371584699454

5412001,2,B00AEFXL5W,"Breakfast at Tiffany's (Blake Edwards, 1961)

A week after The Dark Knight was released, the film had a Rotten Tomatoes rating of 94%. Some wag, I don't remember who, opined that ""the other six critics are all from New York City."" Breakfast at Tiffany's, Blake Edwards' love song to that same city, has an 88% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and I think it's the opposite--the other twelve are from outside the five boroughs. Don't get me wrong, it's a very pretty thing, and the combination of Truman Capote's wit coming through Blake Edwards' lens, back in the days when Blake Edwards was still doing material that could be considered edgy (i.e., before his directorial career became an endless sequence of family-oriented Pink Panther sequels) produces some nasty laughs indeed. But is that enough to not only carry the movie, but the incredible amount of baggage that's attached itself to the movie during the past half-century?

Plot: Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn in the role that defined her career) is a socialite who, as the film opens, gets a new downstairs neighbor, Paul Varjak (How the West Was Won`s George Peppard), a writer-cum-gigolo installed in the place by his sugar mama (The Day the Earth Stood Still`s Patricia Neal), who lives down the hall. The two strike up a friendship that might turn into a romance were it not for Holly's desperate desire to marry up; she's got her sights set on Rusty Trawler (Lilies of the Field`s Stanley Adams), ""the ninth-richest man in America under the age of fifty"".

...and that's it, really, with an extra subplot or two added in (Paul is a writer with one critically-acclaimed but commercially-unviable book under his belt, Holly has a past she doesn't like to think about, etc.). To modern eyes, the most terrifying piece of the film is Mickey Rooney's cartoonish, stereotypical portrayal of Holly's Japanese upstairs neighbor, Mr. Yunioshi, which is offensive at every turn. Audiences in 1961 probably found it hysterical while shielding the kiddies' eyes from the idea of a young woman living on her own and doing relatively well at it (while Varjak is explicitly a gigolo, Holly's status as a high-class prostitute remains intentionally ambiguous, but in terms of 1961 dollars, did anyone really believe her ""dates"" were giving her fifty bucks to go to the powder room? Not unless she was going to the one with the wrong plumbing).

It's true that the final scene is a masterpiece of emotional manipulation (but let's be honest here: we're far more concerned about the fate of Cat than we are whether Holly is finally going to let her feelings for Paul break through), but it's far from enough to get through the ponderous, badly-aged first hour and three-quarters of the movie to get to unless you have the same love affair with New York City as did Truman Capote and Blake Edwards. **",1353024000,,2845,4.871900826446281

5412013,4,B00AEFXL5W,"It's great fun. Perhaps not great art, even though it was written by Truman Capote, but it certainly is great fun. This is the one where Henry Mancini got an Oscar for ""Moon River."" Miss Hepburn sings it.

The focus of the story is an apartment house in New York City, where Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) lives and parties and drives the photographer two floors up (Mickey Rooney playing a Japanese) quite crazy by buzzing his door to be let in no matter how late it is. She says ""but I lost my key,"" and he replies ""But that was two weeks ago, you must have another one made."" Her answer is ""Why? I'd just loose it. I lose them all the time."" But she quiets him by saying that if he's nice to her, she will let him take ""those pictures we talked about.""

In the apartment directly over her head there moves in an aspiring young writer (George Peppard) who is ""sponsored"" by a rich older woman (Patricia Neal) who calls him darling all the time and decorated his apartment for him before he even saw it. She's obviously using him as a toy or a pet, and he accepts it so that he can write.

Holly's income is a little hard to figure. She gets $100 a week (in 1961 that was quite a lot) for going to visit a gangster at Sing Sing once a week, and taking his lawyer a message in the form of a weather report. She says that men give her $50 ""for the powder room,"" and if she asks for cab fare, they usually give her $100. As Truman Capote wrote it, she was more obviously a prostitute, but this sounds more like she's a fake. Twice she appeals to Paul, the writer, for protection from men who ""followed her home."" In fact, her agent says she's a fake, but she's a genuine fake. That is, she believes the stuff she says.

One of the funniest parts is a huge party she has in her little apartment, where all sorts of crazy things happen. Her agent (Martin Balsam) goes up to this tall, beautiful woman and asks her name. ""She"" answers ""Irving."" He doesn't seem to mind; later Paul finds them necking in the bathtub.

Let's face it, this was shot 50 years ago.  While the colors are bright and image quality is very sharp, it doesn't have that level of reality you might expect from a modern film.  Something tells me this was not tranferred from the original negatives, but rather a technicolor print.  The original negatives probably have not survived as well as the ultra-stable technicolor dyes.  But this is okay because this type of print is exactly what the audiences saw in the theater.  Don't get me wrong.  The picture is as stunning as it gets.  Just don't expect the imagery to jump out at you like something shot in digital.

5412017,3,B00AEFXL5W,"If you're a fan of ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" then this 2011 BLU RAY reissue will knock your socks off. For the most part, the fully restored print is glorious to look at - even in the scenes where too much sepia shading is placed on the leads for effect. The outdoor sequences with Peppard and Buddy Epstein are faultless, full of colour and incredible detail (clothing, scenery) - and look like they were filmed yesterday. There's decent extras too (interviews with Director Edward Blake, members of the cast) and the dreadfully washed out old stock print used in the ""Making Of"" segment gives you a very good comparison as to just how improved the restored version really is.

But for me - that's where the good news ends. I watched this with my wife - and even with Audrey Hepburn exquisite throughout (especially on the balcony-outside-her-window scene where she is strumming her guitar and singing Mancini's famous theme song ""Moon River"") - the film is staggeringly dated - and at times terribly leaden. The party sequence in her New York apartment is awful - with square types trying to be cool. And the amount of times the word ""darling"" and ""baby"" is said will make you cringe and not giggle with affection. I can't help but think that Capote's novella about a socialite/hooker got seriously watered down into forced farce because that was an easier sell. And while George Peppard looks the handsome leading-man part - there's little real bite in him. The Chinaman impression by Mickey Rooney (even by Edwards own admission) is a derogatory mistake that rankers even to this day. But it's the vapid pointlessness of it all that leaves you cold. OK - Hepburn could light up any shot - even when she was overdoing the ""darling"" dialogue. But quite why this Sixties tosh is considered a classic is beyond me - because re-watching ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" in 2011 is a painfully strained experience - and not nearly as loveable or as romantic as you remember it to be.

The bottom-line is this - if you're a fan - or have any love for this 1961 kooky movie - then you NEED to own it on BLU RAY.

But if you're undecided - then I'd say rent it first - before a nostalgia urge costs you a purchase you'll look at once and never watch again...

A pitch perfect romantic comedy sans the mania that developed in later Blake Edwards and later romantic comedies. The charm and grace that seemed to come so naturally to Ms. Hepburn and dominates so many of her roles can make us forget that she was a fine actress. The moments when the fear slips through the desperate-for-security Holly Golightly's facade of good spirits are all the more powerful because we forget that the actress is capable of such fine craft.

5412022,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Ever since I've first seen ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (1961), it's been my favorite movie. Every time I see that taxi pull up at Tiffany's on Fifth Avenue in the early morning, with Audrey Hepburn coming out and window shopping while eating a pastry and drinking coffee, it makes me happy for some reason. I can just watch this film over and over and over again, because I think it's a perfect movie with great acting, characters, and, of course, I love Audrey Hepburn, and that iconic photo of her standing in that black dress with a cigarette holder. Marilyn Monroe was originally supposed to be Holly Golightly, but declined, and as much as I love Marilyn, I'm glad that Audrey Hepburn took the role, because she's my favorite actress and I can't imagine anybody else being Holly Golightly. This is definitely my favorite film of hers, and my favorite of all time.
  Audrey Hepburn plays Holly Golightly, her most iconic role. She's a 19-year old socialite (Audrey was really 31 at that time), who is also a call-girl that takes ""50 dollars for the powder room"". George Peppard plays Paul Varjak, a writer who moves into her apartment, and later on they fall in love, but it's complicated since she has a troubled past and is irresponsible. The other names in the cast include Patricia Neal, Buddy Ebsen, Martin Balsam, and Mickey Rooney as Mr. Yunioshi, a very controversial role.
  The special features to the Paramount Centennial Collection of this film are definitely worth watching. The Disc 1 comes with the film and a commentary by producer Richard Shephard. The Disc 2 comes with ""A Golightly Gathering"", a 20 minute featurette that reunites all of the cast members from the famous cocktail party scene (it took a whopping 8 days to film!). It's one of the best featurettes on the DVD. The second feature is ""Henry Mancini: More than Music"", a 21 minute featurette about the life and music of famous composer, Henry Mancini, who did ""Moon River"", the theme song to ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"". ""Mr. Yunioshi: An Asian Perspective is a 17 minute featurette you probably should skip. I can see how the whole was controversial and upsetting, but there's a lot of not needed things in this film, like talk about World War II and different Asian actors in films. I know it kind of relates to the featurette, but it doesn't even relate to the film itself. ""The Making of a Classic"" is a 16 minute featurette that talks about how the film was made. It comes with a lot of good information and it was really enjoyable. ""It's So Audrey: A Style Icon"" has to be my favorite featurette on this whole DVD. It's 8 minutes long and has different interviews with designers and even her ex-husband, Mel Ferrer, along with her son, Sean Ferrer. It also shows clips from different films of hers, which is my favorite part of the feature. It shows movies like ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", ""Roman Holiday"", ""Sabrina"", ""Funny Face"", and ""Paris When it Sizzles"", along with some cute photos of Audrey. ""Beyond the Gates: The Tour"", is a 4-5 minute featurette that tours beyond the gates of Paramount, and talks about the history of my favorite movie company of all time. ""Brilliance in a Blue Box"" is about 6 minutes, and it talks about the history of Tiffany & Co. It's very interesting. ""Audrey's Letter to Tiffany"" is only 2 minutes long, and it shows the letter she wrote to Tiffany's for it's 150th anniversary book in 1987. It also comes with the original theatrical trailer and production photographs, which are enjoyable, too. It also comes with an 8-page booklet, like all Centennial Collections have, full of great information and photos.
  Altogether, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a classic that has so many things that make the movie great, like Audrey Hepburn, a great supporting cast, great New York setting, some nice drama and romance, an iconic ending, and, of course, Cat, which is Audrey's cat in the film that she doesn't give a name to. ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is without a doubt a great romance, and one of the most iconic movies of all time. Happy 50th anniversary!",1318118400,4,4069,4.748231966053749

In my opinion, you will not be disappointed. Its beautiful, but a little soft and grainy. Audio is superb, end of story. Special features are very nice and entertaining.

5412026,4,B00AEFXL5W,"It used to be that iconic actors and actresses were thought to have no need to resemble the characters that they were meant to portray.  If Renee Zellweger had assumed the role of Bridget Jones 50 years ago, you would have have been presented with the contradiction of a pole-thin British woman who spoke like she grew up in Texas--though, nevertheless, generally considered to be a bit overweight.  I wonder what southerner Truman Capote made of his hillbilly girl gone Yankee gold digger, but speaking as if she had taken elocution lessons from Henry Higgens (evidently a foreshadowing of things to come)?  Perhaps if Rex Harrison had shown up as Audrey Hepburn's erstwhile husband instead of Buddy Ebsen (whose role in The Beverly Hillbillies was probably launched by this movie), I might have been able to accept the central premise of this film.  But upon first seeing this movie on TV as a young teen, I was completely confused by Ebsen's appearance (""What is Jed Clampett doing here?"").  As it turned out, however, Ebsen might have been the only actor able to play his role credibly in this movie, with the others seeming to have beamed down from an orbiting spacecraft populated by beings whose only knowledge of Earth came from movies made before 1968.  As for Peppard's character, although I could easily imagine him as a sort of boy-toy, he did not strike me as an inspiring young writer.  Still, I have chosen to give this film four stars in light of the limitations imposed by the gendre that it represents--that of the American equivalent to Kabuki theater.  Also, the casting of this film might be credited with elucidating the enigma of Jed Clampett's seeming lack of interest in finding a wife in Beverly Hills. After all, once a character is identified as the ex-husband of the heavenly Ms. Hepburn, to what other woman's company would he care to aspire?",1305936000,3,1872,4.809968847352025
5412027,5,B00AEFXL5W,"So much has already been said about this classic, what's one more description of the plot, etc. going to do?  I just want to give my take on this classic...

I'm a fan of classic movies.  I also like movies that are a little ""offbeat"".  Breakfast At Tiffany's (1961) is one of those movies and is one of the best romantic comedies ever made.  Audrey Hepburn's character Holly Golightly is one of the most memorable and recognizable characters in movie history.  When most people think of Audrey Hepburn, they think of the cheerful, stylish, and eccentric Holly Golightly.  This movie also stars George Peppard, Martin Balsam, Buddy Ebsen, Patricia Neal, and Mickey Rooney.  Hepburn's performance was outstanding.

Much has been said over the years about Mickey Rooney's character, Mr. Yunioshi.  Is it offensive?  Sure, but the most important thing is to just realize that this movie came out only a decade and a half after World War II.  Society thought a certain way back then.

Henry Mancini's score won him both an Academy Award and a Grammy, and the song ""Moon River"" won him and Johnny Mercer an Academy Award for Best Song.  The song was actually sung by Audrey Hepburn for the movie (dubbed in).  She actually played guitar, also.

The picture clarity of this 2-DVD set is superb.  For a 50-year-old movie, it looks like it came out yesterday.  This DVD set is loaded with extras, including commentary, features on Henry Mancini, the character of Mr. Yunioshi, the making of the movie, the style of Audrey Hepburn, the original theatrical trailer, and more.

I highly recommend this movie if you're into classic movies.",1303948800,2,1627,4.850909090909091

5412029,4,B00AEFXL5W,"I somehow missed ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" the first time around, and upon seeing it decades after the fact, I am trying to weigh up the balance between the good parts of the movie and the bad. Upon a twenty-four hour reflection, I have to come down on the side of a qualified ""worth seeing.""  I'll call it as I see it.

Terrific: Watching Audrey Hepburn in all her elegant Givenchy style; experiencing the chemistry between her, George Peppard, and Cat; Henry Mancini's ""Moon River""; The rain scene. The extra by Mancini's widow and children was well worth watching.

Less terrific: Don't even think about the miscasting of both Hepburn and Peppard in Blake Edwards' interpretation of Capote's novella. In the DVD extras, I discovered that Marilyn Monroe's name was mentioned for the role of Holly (She would have been wholly believable in the role).

Fun: A typical goofy Blake Edwards' party scene (played with endless variations in his other films: e.g., ""Victor, Victoria.""). (The Extra of the actors who played in the scene, which was choreographed and took eight days to film, is interesting from a filmmaking point of view).

Mediocre: The equivocal comedy of the shoplifting scene.

Cringeworthy: Edwards' widely acknowledged ""direction"" and resultant ""performance"" of Mickey Rooney (One must ask, however, if the character of Mr. Y. was not merely a prelude to Cato in the Pink Panther films, and whether the character of Cato was rendered slightly less offensive because it was played by an Asian and was possibly balanced by the goofy context of Sellers' idiotic ""Frenchman,"" Inspector Clouseau?). I am certain that I would have cringed had I seen ""Tiffany's"" at the time it was made!""

Upshot: Because of the luminescence that Audrey Hepburn brought to any part she played, the splendid color and costumes, I would recommend  ""Breakfast at Tiffany's with qualifications as an example of film history. Three-and-a-half stars.",1301184000,4,1937,5.1075949367088604

It is Audrey Hepburn at her most beautiful best and George Peppard at his most handsome. I even named my cat after her cat in the movie. I simply call him ""Cat"".

As a first step, I read Truman Capote's original novella, originally published in 1958.  [About Capote's work: it surprises with its freshness at its 50+ year mark...and makes the reader realize what a sad waste of talent Capote became in the second-half of his life.]

Second step: watch the movie directed by the great Blake Edwards.  Hopefully the Centennial Collection edition of the DVD has solved the sound problem.  The 'regular' release suffers from a muddled sound quality, especially the (literally) breathless stream-of-consciousness coming from Audrey Hepburn's lips. The otherwise enjoyable adaptation comes to a screeching, nails-on-a-blackboard halt whenever Mickey Rooney appears as Mr. Yunioshi.  It's a deplorable characterization, surely as offensive then as it is today.

George Axelrod's screenplay makes major changes from Capote's work: the setting is then modern-day NYC (1961) rather than Capote's WWII time period; the narrator has a name (Paul Varjak vs. simply the 'Fred' Holly bestows upon him in Capote's work); Fred seems to have, ahem, switched teams; and the ending is dramatically altered (let's just say that Capote's version doesn't tie-up nicely into a happily-ever-after Hollywood bow).

Furthermore, Edwards' version of the tale is even more oblique than Capote regarding Holly Golightly's, shall we say, 'source of income.'  There are indelicate men ('rats') hanging around, wild parties in her apartment, visits to Tiffany's at 5 AM in an evening dress, and references to $50 payments from men in the powder room.  Spying the money left on Fred's table by Patricia O'Neal, Holly slyly notes that there's not too much difference between the two of them.  The obliqueness is part of the movie's - and Holly's - intrigue.  Today, all that would be communicated in a far more direct - and probably less interesting - manner.",1295308800,,2268,5.902140672782875

She is loved by struggling writer Paul Varjak; he not only falls in love with her, but he loves her and becomes strongly concerned about her, so much so that he breaks off his indiscreet affair with a married lady, an interior decorator who, in one sense, uses him. (The versatile Patricia Neal plays the part of the interior designer perfectly.)
This is quite a successful directing feat for Blake Edwards, and Henry Mancini provides a beautiful music score for this classic movie.
Audrey Hepburn portrays so well the beautiful, mixed-up Holly Golightly, originally a girl who has run away from a marriage with a doctor from Tulip, Texas;Buddy Ebsen does a good turn in this minor role as the doctor. She encounters Paul Varjak (played so well by George Peppard) and their romance shortly begins. Without ever asking questions about her, he sees perfectly that she is in actuality not happy and, again, mixed-up.

2.) Jean Seberg and Kim Novak were considered for Holly before the film's producers decided on Miss Hepburn.
3.) Steve McQueen was offered George Peppard's part but was unavailable.

6.) 19-year-old Holly likes herb, has a dirty mouth, once terminated a pregnancy and dates both men and women.
7.) Her brother Fred also isn't ""straight.""

Sight aione verifies the obvious:
Hepburn's rare beauty is ideally enhanced by an exquisitely accessorized black sheath dress. Mr. Peppard is equally as pulchritudinous and they make a gorgeous couple. Their bittersweet rainy alleyway scene at story's end is one of the most emotional moments in cinematic history.

Mickey Rooney is highly annoying (and incredibly un-P.C.) in his comic relief role as a mule-toothed, Coke bottle eyeglass-wearing Oriental. Buddy Ebsen defines acting perfection as Holly's abandoned husband, come from the country to NYC to bring his ""Lullamae"" home.

Blake Edwards' early masterpiece is a complex tale of a mercurial young lady who freely accepts cash gifts from men, is most at ease in overcrowded, swinging cocktail parties, and at her neurotic worst when alone with the one man she's attracted to, a handsome young author of a single book who struggles to write anything new.

Taking place in chic early 1960's NYC, Holly Golightly, played by the magnificent and lovely Audrey Hepburn, is a beautiful yet confusing young sophisticate looking for her way through life via chic parties and dating rich men. When she meets her new neighbor, Paul Varjak, a writer and kept man, played wonderfully by George Peppard, her world takes an unexpected turn but ever so slowly and with plenty of resistence by her own drive to marry any one of the world's richest men, whoever that will be.

Patricia Neal, a stylish gal herself, is writer Paul Varjak's lady friend and
'financiere' and Buddy Ebsen plays a long past husband of Holly who tries to take her back home. The cast is further blessed with terrific and amusing performances by Martin Balsam (as Holly's agent), John McGiver (as the staid Tiffany salesman) and Mickey Rooney, in a tongue-in-cheek impersonation of a Japanese photographer who is constantly pestered by neighbor Holly's life style and antics. Even 'Cat' has a key role in this classic.

The movie shows us NYC life in the early 60's and that alone is a treasure. Add to this the superb acting and terrific story line provided to us through Truman Capote's novella and you have a can't miss classic. The song classic 'Moon River' is born here as well, in a sweet scene between Holly and Paul.

Audrey is superbly gorgeous and stylish and Mr Peppard fits her perfectly.

5412053,2,B00AEFXL5W,"Bad movies start with bad casting. Audrey Hepburn simply isn't credible as a hooker, high-class or not. This role should have gone to someone like Marilyn Monroe, Rita Hayworth (the love goddess), or Kim Novak. Hepburn may have charm, but she isn't sexy. Her figure isn't credible (she had height but no curves) and her face isn't DDG. Even her hair isn't particularly hot. But so many men want to be with her? Yeah, right. Whatever.

Audrey does have an effortless way about her in this film but gradually it wears on you because she goes on and on and on, rambling ad nauseam. You want to say to her, STFU already!

This film has been called a romantic comedy but it really isn't very romantic, and the comedy is weak sauce. Holly Golightly (sounds like a James Bond girl, right?) isn't very attractive (physically, emotionally, and lacks character); so the ""attraction"" in this pseudo romance is because Peppard feels sorry for her and sees her as a lost puppy he could rescue.

It's not really a drama, either, because there's almost no tension. That leaves the dialogue which is mostly a monologue--Golightly speaking lightly about anything and everything that pops into her ditzy head as soon as she thinks of it--just rambling.

You feel like you're tagging along to watch a boring person's life and listen to her describe it in boring fashion.

The film fails because it isn't romantic enough; it's not sexy enough; and it's not funny enough.

Pretty Woman with Julia Roberts had the high-class hooker who meets the perfect gentleman who can turn her life around. This one has two degenerates, which is one too many.

5412056,1,B00AEFXL5W,"Firstly, I must say I am a fan of Audrey Hepburn but I did not buy her turn as Holly Golightly, for even one second of screen time. Audrey Hepburn, was a waifish beauty and all I could think was would men really be going this crazy for her, as they did in the movie.
Elegant and pretty? Yes, but this is NOT what the character needed to be. The character was supposed to be kittenish sexy, a true idea of a man's view of a goddess even. Audrey, although beautiful does not fit this bill at all. Her character comes off less as vulnerable and more as just bratty, self involved, emotionally stunted individual. It is no wonder Truman Capote HATED the casting of this movie.
I found the whole New York scene, the conversations, and morality to be beyond shallow.
I live in New York in 2010 and have been involved in theatrical circles, and have never once encountered people like this. If I had I would have left the party 2 minutes into it. I don't believe the 1960's could have been THAT superficial.
My suggestion is to read Truman Capote's words and do not waste your time on the movie. This would be one movie worth remaking.",1264377600,23,1128,4.350710900473934
5412057,5,B00AEFXL5W,"There are a lot of things to just love about this movie.  It's one of the best romantic comedies ever made, IMO.  So what makes this movie so appealing?  First and foremost is Audrey.  The camera just loves her.  Look for the shot of Audrey playing Moon River on a balcony slightly out of focus.  I don't think I've ever seen a more stunningly beautiful shot of a woman's face in any movie ever.  Then you have the opening and closing of the movie, incredibly romantic images w/ Moon River in the background.  There are the scenes w/ NYC in the background that are also most appealing.  The romance between Hepburn and Peppard is believable and touching.  There are a few things to pick apart about the movie.  Mickey Rooney portrays a Japanese photographer in an incredibly stereotyped and somewhat racist light.  The movie might be 20 minutes or so too long, which is ok, as Hollywood used to take its time in giving the audience the feel of a scene.  Take Audrey and the Mancini music, especially Moon River, out of the movie and it's probably just another forgettable romantic comedy.  Its really those 2 elements that make this movie a must-see classic.  Highly recommended...",1264204800,,1181,4.665048543689321
5412058,5,B00AEFXL5W,"""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" is one of those Hollywood films that never ages. A beautifully acted and well-crafted film, ""Breakfast"" is one of my all-time favorite movies from the 1960's. Starring Audrey Hepburn in a role she was born to play, Audrey plays a young woman living in New York City trying to find Mr. Right while working in the oldest profession in the book. The undertone and subtext of the film is evident to modern audiences in that Hepburn is playing a high-class prostitute. Is is this particular role that shows the world that call-girls are not just the ones walking in dark alleys while being drug-addicted. Hepburns's portrayal of her role is real and honest as there are many in this particular profession who are beautiful, articulate, witty, and exquisite. The viewer falls in love with Audrey's character Holly as well as Audrey herself as her role is one of the most likable in film history.
 ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" is also known for its mesmerizing score by Henri Mancini who won an Oscar as well as another for the theme song ""Moon River"" co-written by Johnny Mercer. The supporting cast is one of Hollywood's best with the marvelous George Peppard, Patricia Neal, Buddy Ebsen, Mickey Rooney, and Martin Balsam.
 This lovely DVD release is the Anniversary Edition featuring commentary by producer Richard Sheperd, the featurette ""The Making of a Classic"", theatrical trailer, and more.

Well, I had intended on logging in and writing this long review about Paramount's latest release of the Audrey Hepburn classic ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""; however, Dennis A. Amith (kndy) has written probably the best review I've read concerning this release, so I'll have to defer.

5412061,4,B00AEFXL5W,"After reviewing Truman Capote's beautifully-wrought novella ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" for Amazon, I watched the 1961 movie version with Audrey Hepburn playing Holly Golightly. I remembered the movie with great affection, but this time I found it to have too much of the old Hollywood touch to it. In the book the writer-neighbor, the narrator, is a rather androgynous character, more like Capote himself, who is merely Holly's friend. In the flick he's turned into a testosterone-packed heterosexual gigolo, played by George Peppard.
 Parts of the film have a phoniness that comes from an overreaching desire to capture Holly's eccentricity, the magnetic oddity she is in the book. Audrey Hepburn's conception of and portrayal of Holly I think is right on the mark, but it's some of the people around her who don't make it. The manic apartment party seems very phony, and full of slapstick that falls flat. Hepburn is beautiful enough and talented enough to strike the right note as a free spirit, a wild thing, just as in the book.
 But the film was not true to the book in tacking on a traditional Hollywood happy ending--an example of Hollywood not trusting the instincts of the public. By changing the ending, the moguls also altered the basic character of Holly. Since 1961 audiences have grown up a great deal, become more attuned to subtle nuances, and I think Capote's ending would be more appropriate for today's viewers.
Buddy Ebsen is fine as Holly's ex-husband who married her when she was fourteen.
Despite the fact that the character of Holly's supportive neighbor is distinctly different, Peppard does a great acting job in the movie. The character has published one book, ""Nine Lives."" Hepburn and Peppard seem to have good chemistry between them. If they ever remake this movie, how about Philip Seymour Hoffman as the writer-neighbor?
Mickey Rooney's caricature of Mr. Yunioshi, the neighbor who is always complaining is way over the top with his buck teeth and slapstick bits. The part is a much more inflated role than in the book, and Rooney's take is racist, making the character into a buffoon unnecessarily.
The movie has too much of that old Hollywood clichd flavor in this adaptation of a fine piece of fiction. It's a movie full of fascinating details and incidents and doesn't bore.
Peppard says, ""You belong to me,"" and Holly says, ""People don't belong to each other."" She says, ""I need money, and I'll do whatever I have to do to get it.""
Holly was a wild thing that Hollywood in its infinite ignorance had to tame.",1247788800,,2544,4.886574074074074

5412067,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Breakfast at Tiffany's is one of those movies which  - thanks to an infrequent movie-going habit,  parents who did not permit much television watching, and twenty years spent overseas watching AFRTS where the movies on offer were  not top tier -  I had never seen, or at least, never watched from beginning to end. So I could come to view it without much in the way of preconceptions, and to see it more or less fresh, save for seeing actors like George Peppard and Patricia Neal as almost impossibly young, younger than I had ever seen them before.
It all stands up very well - all but Mickey Rooney with grotesquely oversized buck-teeth, as the Japanese super of a pleasant New York apartment building. Fifty years later, that is a cringe-inducingly offensive bit of stereotyping and stunt casting, a small grubby fly-spot on an otherwise light and airy angel-cake slice of movie.

That it was based on a novel perhaps accounts for a certain kind of dense, and complex feel to it, a sense that all the various characters encountered - some of them just fleetingly in a single scene - have or had their own lives, interests and affections. There are a thousand more stories, behind every window on the quiet street of comfortable brownstone apartments, and a sense that every person at Holly's cocktail party, the salesman behind the counter at Tiffany's, and the fussy librarian has their very own enormously interesting life story. At the heart of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is an ill-assorted pair of neighbors. Perhaps they are not as ill assorted as all that, for they are both being kept, in the old-fashioned sense of the word. Semi-failed writer Jack is more or less the designated boy-toy of a wealthy married woman who has installed him in the apartment for her convenience. And Holly Golightly - elegant and dizzily charming - lives by her wits and charm, cadging fifty dollars at a time from a circle of escorts and visiting an imprisoned mobster once a week. She has a cat, an all-but unfurnished apartment, and a tendency to flee emotional involvement - with anyone.  Her ambitions, if any, are wistful ones about making a home for herself and her younger brother, or marrying a very rich man. Very gradually and naturally, Jack and Holly become acquainted, trust each other, become friends and then realize that they love each other. In real life, love grows in a manner much more like this, much more often than the instant, shake'n'bake romance, which may account for the appeal of this move over the decades since.

Extras are a rather mixed lot: there is strange little feature about cocktail parties, featuring a reunion of the various actors cast as the guests at Holly's lively cocktail party, reminiscing about their bits of business. It was a very complex bit of shooting, and took up more than a week; if you go back and watch that segment very carefully, you will appreciate all the minor stories happening there. Another feature is a sort of retrospective on portrayals of Asians in the movies, and the (to late 20th-century movie fans) the bizarre and unconvincing penchant for casting Caucasian actors in Asian roles. There is also a feature about Tiffany's, and a lovely memory by the writer of the company history of Audrey Hepburn writing a graceful dedication page for it. Ms Hepburn and her fashion sense are the focus of yet another. (She did indeed dress beautifully, in ageless and flattering clothes that still look up-to-this-minute current. Any of her gowns and outfits could be worn today without appearing the least bit dowdy or unfashionable.)",1237593600,3,3585,4.838499184339315
5412068,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Audrey Hepburn had a lot of memorable, glamorous roles as highly individual, sensitive young women.

But her most iconic turn was as Holly Golightly, a frivolous young woman with a highly sensitive core. Hepburn is a ball of shimmering charm here, whether she's setting hats on fire or chasing nameless cats through the rain, and she's able to shine brightly enough to obscure a few flaws (such as Mickey Rooney). The other actors do serviceable jobs, but she's undeniablythe star.

""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a daily ritual for Holly Golightly (Hepburn), a social butterfly who hosts parties, entertains drunken men for their fifty-dollartips, and dreams of owning a horse farm in Mexico with her brother. When kept-man Paul Varjak (George Peppard) moves into a neighboring apartment -- courtesy of his rich patroness -- he is instantly enchanted by the ditzy, sweet-natured Holly.

But for all Holly's fun, Paul starts to realize that all is not well with her. She's desperate to marry a spectacularly wealthy man, parties with wild crowds, visits a notorious gangster in jail, and hides that she was an illiterate teen bride to a hick doctor. As Holly's life starts to deteriorate, Paul sets out to show her what her life will be like without real love.

Reportedly Truman Capote wasn't happy with the movie version of ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" -- they changed the ending from his short story's, and he didn't like Hepburn as Holly Golightley. But this is one case where the movie's quality is not reflected by what the author thought of it -- taken on its own merits, it's a fine chocolate with a bittersweet center.

Much of the movie is devoted to the friendship (and unspoken attraction) between Holly and Paul, and how it disrupts their comfortable shallow lives. Paul spends the whole movie unravelling the unhappy tale of Holly's life as she starts spinning out of control. Things climax nastily with Holly's already-questionable reputation being sullied, but the finale is an exquisite mix of brutal honesty, true love and a very unglamorous rainstorm.

That said, it's a pretty hilarious movie -- witty dialogue (""... if you like dark, handsome, rich-looking men with passionate natures and too many teeth"") and plenty of kooky humour (""TIMBER!"" Holly yells as a drunken model keels over, followed by the crowd parting like the Red Sea). And there are plenty of charming, warm'n'fuzzy moments, like the cute day trip through New York.

One thing that will make viewers cringe: Mickey Rooney's caricatured Japanese landlord who objects to Holly's parties. Not. Funny.

Though she was no party girl, Audrey Hepburn is pitch-perfect as Holly -- she can be flaky and adorable (""I'm CRAAAZY about Tiffany's?""), chattery and glamorous, with a cat she refuses to name because they're just a pair of ""poor slobs who don't belong to anybody."" But she can just as easily flip the switch to show the wounded, almost childlike side.

George Peppard is just as good -- albeit less winsome -- as a writer-turned-kept-man-turned-writer-again, whose protective affection for Holly grows as the movie goes on, but who has to get through her ironclad defenses. And Patricia Neal rounds out the cast nicely as the icy, cynical woman whom Paul gives his non-literary services to.

Hepburn is the flawed diamond at the heart of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" and her charm and acting ability elevate this beyond just another adorable romantic comedy.",1236902400,,3436,5.044091710758377
5412069,1,B00AEFXL5W,"In spite of her goal to marry a rich man, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), an immature young woman, finds herself falling in love with Paul Varjak (George Pappard), a poor writer who moves into her apartment building.

With the possible exception of ""My Fair Lady"", ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is probably the best remembered of all of Audrey Hepburn's films, and yet, of those that I have seen, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is the one that least impressed me. ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is just like ""Goodbye to Berlin"" (Christopher Isherwood's autobiographical novel, which formed the basis for ""Cabaret""), only set in 1960's New York and made as a romantic comedy. The two main character, Holly and Paul, seem to be lifted directly from ""Goodbye to Berlin"" (in particular the dynamics of their relationship) to the point where, about 10 minutes into the film, I found myself pointing at Holly and saying aloud ""that's Sally Bowles!"" Yet, whereas when I read Isherwood's book and saw ""Cabaret"", I found myself feeling sorry for Sally Bowles and saw her as a tragic figure to be pitied, I found Holly Golightly to be quite simply objectionable. This is possibly due to the differences in the way their behaviour is looked on in these two stories. While Bowles's behaviour was viewed as self-destructive, Holly is portrayed as a lovable woman-child whose flightiness is what causes Paul Varjak to fall hopelessly in love with her. The idea that Holly's behaviour is somehow a good thing turned me off her completely.

In addition, there is the matter of Mr Yunioshi, the Japanese character played by Mickey Rooney and commented on in so many other reviews. From the first moment he appears, this character is painful to watch. He is a caricature of a Japanese man, so is painful to watch because of the incredibly racism of this character's inclusion, but even if we ignore his race, the character is a mean spirited little man who is presumably meant to be funny because of his over-the-top meaness and general stupidity, but the humour just falls flat on its face. It is uncommon for me to give a movie 1 star, since I can usually find something I like about anything, no matter how bad it is, but in this case, Mickey Rooney's character is so cringeworthy bad that I am prepared to make an exception.",1236038400,15,2295,4.807594936708861

5412072,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Excellent!

A word that can describe the Centennial Collection release of the 1961 film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", the classic romantic comedy starring Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard.

Having reviewed previous versions of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" before on DVD,  I'm sure many Audrey Hepburn fans are probably wondering how else can Paramount improve from the 2006 45th Anniversary Edition on DVD?  Well, I can tell you right now... plenty!  Please read on.

A film that stars quite a bit of talent, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" remains not just one of the most memorable romantic films of all time but a film that exemplifies the beauty of Audrey Hepburn, the chic style of the times and more (which I will discuss more in the special features portion of my review).

VIDEO & AUDIO:

The film is presented in widescreen format, enhanced for 16:9 TV's.  A lot of the Centennial Collection releases have been remastered for high definition and having the previous DVD's, I can tell you that the DVD looks great.  But I can only imagine how this film would look in 1080P if released in Blu-ray.

Audio is featured in Dolby Digital English 5.1 Surround/English, Restored Mono, French Mono and Spanish Mono.  The film of course is dialogue-driven but sure enough, the music of Harry Mancini is alive and well when blaring through your speakers.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

As mentioned before, there have been several releases of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" prior to this Centennial Collection, the older DVD's really hardly came with anything but the trailer until the 2006 ""Special 45th Anniversary Collector's Edition"" which came with a good number of special features and a commentary by producer Richard Shepherd.

Well, what I can tell you is that the Centennial Collection contains all of the special features from the Anniversary DVD release but also adds quite a few new lengthy featurettes as well.  On the first disc, the first disc contains the movie and the same commentary from the Anniversary disc by Producer Richard Shepherd.  You can tell that Shepherd gets drawn in to the film and doesn't speak in the commentary until he feels necessary.

So, for those wanting a verbose commentary, Shepherd doesn't do that.  But it's actually quite fine because when he does speak, you learn a lot of things from him about the filming.  For example, the opening shot featuring Audrey Hepburn in front of Tiffany's in Fifth Avenue.  Where the place is typically packed with cars and people, for that time... there was hardly any traffic and no people.  So, a very lucky time in filmmaking for the crew.

Also, Shepherd is quite apologetic about casting Rooney as Mr. Funiyoshi and he does that quite a bit in the commentary.  You realized he didn't want the yellow face routine (Caucasian actor looking like an Asian stereotypical character) but it was kept in.  Also, commenting of how certain scenes worked then but would never fly now.  But most of all, his continued feeling of Audrey Hepburn as a class act.  Overall, a very good commentary that you learn a lot from.

The special features on disc 2 are as follows:

  * A Golightly Gathering - A 20-minute featurette that reunites the talents who were in the cocktail party scene from ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"".  One of the coolest parties ever on film, it's great to see the talent from the film reunite and discuss their experiences of filming that part scene 40-years later.  I had no idea the party-scene took 8-days to film but it was great to hear everyone talk about their scene, working with Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard and Blake Edwards.  But what a great featurette and so happy of it's inclusion.
  * Henry Mancini: More Than Music - This nearly 21-minute featurette is a wonderful featurette that features interviews with Henry Mancini's wife, daughter and son.  Seeing private photos and even videos of Henry and having their family talk about him and what they remember about him, winning the two Academy Awards for ""Moon River"" and working on other films is just wonderful.
  * Mr. Yunioshi: An Asian Perspective - A 17-minute featurette.  Despite the popularity of the film, the black cloud that has lingered on this film was the casting of Mickey Rooney as ""Mr. Yunioshi"".  A talented actor, the ""yellow face"" role was just wrong and acknowledge by the director, producer and a cast member was just terribly wrong in casting Rooney for that role.  This feature has interviews with representatives of the Media Action Network of Asian Americans.  I'm glad that Paramount did include this featurette on this collection.
  * The Making of a Classic - Originally from the Anniversary release, this segment features interviews with Producer Richard Shepherd and Director Blake Edwards.  A 16-minute featurette and you definitely learn a lot about the film, especially from Blake Edwards.  One could image how his director's commentary would have been if included, especially with what he had to say on this featurette.
  * It's So Audrey: A Style Icon - An eight minute featurette with interviews with designers, Hepburn's son and companion. How Audrey Hepburn made simple things quite sexy.  How Audrey never thought of her body proportions that sexy but she did have a good eye for style and how she became a fashion and style icon.
  * Behind the Gates: The Tour - This 4 minute featurette gives people a look behind the gates of the Paramount lot. A good promotional for those who would like to tour the Paramount lot.
  * Brilliance in a Blue Box - A six minute featurette about the history of Tiffany's.  Originally featured on the Anniversary DVD.
  * Audrey's Letter to Tiffany - A two minute featurette about the letter Audrey wrote for the preface of the 150th Anniversary book for Tiffany's.
  * Original Theatrical Trailer - The original two minute trailer with its dust, scratches and all.
  * Galleries - Featuring production stills, movie stills and publicity shots for the film.

The Centennial Collection also comes with a booklet that features information of facts of the film, from how Capote wanted Marilyn Monroe for this film, information on Orangey the cat and how the ""New York Site"" that was filmed at the Paramount lot is now forever lost due to the big Paramount fire back in 1983 that destroyed historical sets.

And the DVD is just classy with it's black and gold packaging (which most of the Centennial Collection are packaged) and ditching the pink and white packaging.

I absolutely love this film.  From the memorable dialogue, that first scene with Holly standing in front of Tiffany's, the cocktail party, Holly Golightly singing ""Moon River"" on her guitar, the cat and of course the final scene between Holly and Paul.

""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a classic Audrey Hepburn film that is a must-own.  I know that the film has been re-released many times on DVD and the 45th Anniversary was just a pleasure when it first came out and at the time, it was a definitive release.  But now, with this ""Centennial Collection"" featuring a remastered version of the film and the new (and quite lengthy) featurettes that is included on this collection, this is the definitive version on DVD.

Personally, I can only imagine how this would look once it becomes available on Blu-ray but for now, these Centennial Collections from Paramount are just wonderful.  Especially ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"", I'm really amazed how far Paramount went in order to make this release much more special.

The addition of ""A Golightly Gathering"" featuring the actors who took part in that cocktail party was awesome, the Henry Mancini featurette for those who just love his musical work will love this featurette and of course, for those who have felt the pain of the ""yellow face"" segment in the film, Paramount going the extra step by including a featurette dedicate to that on this DVD.

But in the end, this DVD is indeed a special tribute to Audrey Hepburn.  Hepburn is just an icon of style and elegance and this DVD does a great job of giving special attention to such an incredible film.  And after seeing this film so many time times, I still have not grown tired of it.  It's one special film that I highly recommend",1231113600,184,8189,4.876176683562636
5412073,5,B00AEFXL5W,"This is the wondrous film that created Audrey Hepburn's enduring and iconic image:  The sublime Givenchy gown, the oversized sunglasses, the glamorous streaked updo, her own yards and yards of sophistication and chic.  If you hit puberty in the 60's as I did, this film presented one classic character to ""wanna be"": Holly Golightly via Audrey Hepburn.

""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is not without its flaws but what isn't in this world? It's a glossy, frothy, romantic glimpse into a window of time 50 years ago.

It's about Holly, a sometimes well-paid ""party girl"" living by her wits and on her charms in Manhattan during the early 60's.  It took me years to truly absorb that Holly was ""paid for her favors"" - primarily because imagining Audrey Hepburn as such was inconceivable.  I actually believed Holly was given money from admiring men ""just"" to go to the powder room.  I probably thought: who wouldn't give Holly/Audrey money simply for the pleasure of her delightful presence?

As it turns out, Holly's some kind of beautiful hillbilly who's drifted her way to the fringe of celebrity, from yahooville to Hollywood to New York.  She's living ""La Dolce Vita"" with ""the jet set,"" but she's in survival mode, avidly looking for a rich husband and security.  Holly meets Varjak, Paul/aka ""Fred"" (George Peppard), a struggling writer, when he moves into her building.  Holly learns that he's kept by a wealthy, older married woman (Patricia Neal) and the two bond.  Things get complicated, as things always do, but things never get dull...

At one time the casting of George Peppard bothered me. Now, not so much -even after having read that Steve McQueen had been considered for the part.  McQueen might have been great, but I like Peppard just fine.  Paul Varjak is supposed to be a ""square,"" and Peppard does a good job portraying the bemused outside observer of Holly's ""swinging scene.""

Much has been said of Mickey Rooney as Holly's upstairs neighbor, Mr. Yunioshi. Today playing an ethnic character this broadly and with buffoonery is NOT DONE - totally politically incorrect, and rightly so.  However, when ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" was made in 1961 it was not yet the end of the era in which caricaturing non-WASPS was common.  I'm not saying it was a good thing and I'm not defending it, I'm just saying it's best to keep in mind that times hadn't changed yet when Rooney played Yunioshi.

""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" boasts a solid supporting cast: Patricia Neal (mentioned above), Martin Balsam as fast talking movie-man, O.J. Berman, Buddy Ebsen as Doc Golightly and - not to forget - ""Cat,"" a pivotal character.

5412075,4,B00AEFXL5W,"Updated on January 13, 2009 --

Why do people who love ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" -- also think it's a bit of a let down?

In my view, a lot of people reflexively label director Blake Edwards's picture a ""classic"" -- because of just two things -- Audrey Hepburn's appearance, which is indeed iconic -- and the sensational melodic power of ""Moon River.""  I think it's a classic too.

The film has a spectacular beginning and a spectacular ending.  But without ""Moon River"" -- and without the star power of adorable Audrey -- there isn't much else to propel today's audiences through a series of many dated, mediocre and ""comedic-but-intended-to-be-satirical"" scenes.

Combine this with the emotional setback that occurs everytime Mickey Rooney's character appears on screen -- one better understands why ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" never makes any film group's list of the ""top 100"" films ever made.  Henry Mancini's ""Moon River"" score bails out the script many times -- and I find myself more ""moved"" by scenes that would otherwise never work.

-----

However, the two-disc Centennial Collection of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is still spectacular -- a vast improvement that stands head-and-shoulders above all single-disc editions previously released on DVD.  While most of the special features have been taken from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/single-disc-Breakfast-at-Tiffany-s-Special-Aniversary-Collector-s-Edition-issued-in-2006/dp/B000BTGY1O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">single-disc Breakfast at Tiffany's (Special Aniversary Collector's Edition) issued in 2006</a>&nbsp;-- there are enough important differences with this new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/two-disc-2008-Centennial-Collection/dp/B001HPP2XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">two-disc 2008 Centennial Collection</a>&nbsp;-- that make it a ""must have upgrade"" for your permanent DVD library.

In particular, the audio and video have been remastered -- hence significantly improved to accommodate the aspect-ratio formatting and high-end audio features so prevalent in today's home entertainment systems.  The video isn't Blu-ray -- but it does have more sharpness and clarity than all previous editions.  A glossy souvenir booklet and handsome packaging befitting of this classic -- are included.

But best of all -- the special features in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2008-Centennial-Collection-edition/dp/B001HPP2XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2008 Centennial Collection edition</a>&nbsp;-- both new and old -- have been spread across two-discs in a way that place the significance of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" in their proper creative and historical context.

-----SPECIAL FEATURES-----

** ""Commentary by Producer Richard Shepard"" -- is the same as what's found on the 2006 DVD -- and is so superb that I'm glad Paramount didn't change it.  Shepard, who brought all of the elements together, including hiring all cast and crew principals -- hits everything out of the ball park with a great mix of enthusiasm and restraint.

** ""A Golightly Gathering"" -- is a new 20-minute documentary featuring interviews of the surviving ""little-known"" cast members in the picture's famous apartment party scene.  These cast interviews were obviously filmed during a ""anniversary reunion party"" hosted by Paramount -- and have been interspersed with clips of their scenes.  Everyone is rightly proud of their contributions -- even though in my view, that party scene -- with which Mr. Edwards remains proud because it contains the most creative material for which he can claim credit -- is overrated.  To be fair, the party scene in ""Tiffany's"" is reflective of ""early"" Blake Edwards.  His later work is better.

I don't think the party scene is funny or as pointedly satirical -- as the office party in Billy Wilder's ""The Apartment"" -- a comedy which won the 1960 Academy Award for Best Picture during the same year (1961) that ""Tiffany's"" was released.  In ""Tiffany's,"" the party is too broad and out-of-place from the A+ ""set-up"" -- that Mr. Edwards gives us during the film's beautiful first half-hour.  It's always here when I start saying to myself, ""OK, move it along, we get it.  Please take us back to Audrey's troubles.""  But don't let my views discourage you.  The documentary itself is still great.

** ""Henry Mancini: More Than Music"" - is a 20-minute documentary that firmly establishes Mancini as one of the greatest composers of the silver screen.  Yes, in my view, he absolutely BELONGS in the same pantheon of Hollywood immortals with Max Steiner, Bernard Herrmann, John Williams, Miklos Rozsa, and Franz Waxman.  I strongly feel Mancini has never been given the credit he deserves because his legacy has been disproportionately defined by his work in ""Tiffany's"" and in the ""Pink Panther"" series.

** ""Mr. Yunioshi: An Asian Perspective"" -- is a 17-minute documentary that is NOT a weak accommodation to political correctness.  As an Asian-American who has long been conflicted about ""Tiffany's,"" this featurette sling-shots this&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2008-Paramount-Centennial-Collection/dp/B001HPP2XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2008 Paramount Centennial Collection</a>&nbsp;over the moon.  It's very instructive about the acceptance of yellow-face casting, e.g., why it was ""OK"" then and why it's ""not OK"" now.  It is NOT sanctimonious -- and it does NOT carry a ""holier-than-thou"" tone that's so common and irritating from ""too-sensitive"" interest groups who want to revise everything they find objectionable in art today.  This documentary is loaded with interviews and film clips that compare yellow-face casting during the decades before the 1960s.  They all have the effect of placing Mickey Rooney's role in better context without excusing it.  It may still be uncomfortable, but Paramount is to be lauded for finally addressing the ""elephant in the room"" that ""Tiffany's"" critics have loudly complained about for almost 50 years.

** ""Behind the Gates: The Tour"" - is a four-minute commercial that says, yes, Paramount also has a studio tour.  No, it's not as gigantic as the Universal Studios theme park several miles north -- but the tour of Paramount's lots on Melrose Ave. is less expensive and just as historic.

** ""Galleries"" - is a mix of old and new -- it's broken up into three sections -- production, movie and publicity.  Hands down, the best stuff is in the ""production"" section, because it shows cast and crew members relaxing, working or goofing off on the set.  These are the type of ""candids"" that really complete the package.  The stills in the ""movie"" and ""publicity"" sections could've been combined -- as most of them have been seen elsewhere in press kit photos or on promotional lobby cards.

** Five other special features are ""carry-overs"" from the 2006 Anniversary Edition:  1) ""The Making of a Classic"" -- 2) ""It's So Audrey:  A Style Icon"" -- 3) ""Brilliance in a Blue Box"" -- 4) ""Audrey's Letter to Tiffany"" -- and 5) ""Original Theatrical Trailer.""

-----THE FILM-----

I think the film version of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is about ""posers"" of all stripes -- struggling to hide their flaws, their past and their embarrassments -- while searching for something that grounds them.  So we get all this stuff that threads throughout the picture, e.g., Holly ""doesn't belong to anyone,"" Holly calls ""her"" cat -- ""Cat"" -- because it sounds ""hip"" and independent.  Holly can be ""bought"" for extravagance -- and believes materialism is better than true love.  Leave love for sentimentalists, she seems to say.  She throws away her identity (i.e., the Lula Mae bit) -- for present day pleasures -- and for a future that will include security and prestige.

But Holly's behavior betrays her true feelings about the family she left behind -- and betrays the way most young single people feel about love.  (Enter George Peppard as a different type of ""poser,"" a kept man, a failed writer who's the voice of reason.  He's a straight-man who doesn't deliver punch-lines.  We instantly want him with Holly.)

Even if this is a ""romantic comedy"" that's not meant to be deep -- ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is too slap-sticky in spots when it shouldn't be, and I'm not just talking about Mickey Rooney.  We watch Audrey as a flighty clothes-horse who dismisses love -- going through a lot of silly stuff -- before she finally comes to her senses, recognizing at the end that she indeed has been a phony -- and is tired of being a ""poser.""  She wants love after all.  The rain (and tears) pour down, ""Moon River"" swells up, and the film ends happily.

But this story doesn't play consistently well on the screen.  Without ""Moon River,"" how much less is George Axelrod's script?  (Ironically, Axelrod collaborated with Billy Wilder on the superb adaptation of ""The Seven Year Itch."")  ""Tiffany's"" never tops its visually spectacular and moody opening, featuring Audrey amid Manhattan's deserted streets, eating a croissant at dawn, gazing into Tiffany's windows.  Only the scenes of Audrey singing ""Moon River"" on the guitar -- and the film's happy ending in the rain -- come close.

In sum, ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is not, in my view, great -- but it is ""essential.""  It is a classic on several levels.  No film better captures the legend of Audrey Hepburn -- and forever links that legend to a tune we can hear repeatedly without complaint.

P.S. -- In September 2008, an 87-year-old Mickey Rooney told the Sacramento Bee that in the nearly 50 years since ""Tiffany's"" was released -- he had received ""not one complaint"" about his performance.  It doesn't matter.  Audiences did laugh at Mr. Rooney in this picture, even though many don't laugh today.  Again, despite my discomfort with his scenes -- applying today's political correctness to the past -- would alter history ""as it was"" in 1961.",1227744000,9,9971,5.482645710543549
5412076,2,B00AEFXL5W,"The movie is a classic, just a bad one. It's been a while since I've seen it, but the other reviews really helped jog my memory. The movie was  shallow and contrived. The main character of a movie should be liked by the audience, but Holly failed to catch my attention or respect. Her unhappiness and lack of self confidence is no excuse for her selfishness. I might have given this move a 3 star if not for the hype. The over the top praise this movie has recieved is unbelievable! I can't help being disappointed in the people who gave it a 5 star. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but still. I agree with a reviewer who wrote that Breakfast at Tiffany's is so beloved because Audrey Hepburn is in it and because the movie is in color. It's pretty irritating that some people would judge a movie by it's actors and CGI, color, cinematography, etc. Shouldn't the story have some kind of plot or lesson? I guess that I'm just the type of person who likes a movie with a purpose. I don't need symbolism, just some kind of goal in mind. Maybe I need to learn how to enjoy a movie for what it is instead of analyzing everything. Actually, I'm not even sure why I watched it in the first place. Curiosity, I guess, and I felt that I should since I like watching classics. It really wasn't a terrible movie, just disappointing. And also, like another reviewer said, it felt like the beginning of Hollywood's apathetic or ""whatever-floats-your-boat"" phase.",1226275200,5,1456,4.494339622641509
5412077,5,B00AEFXL5W,"It's the classic opening scene of a timeless romantic comedy that many would recognize, Audrey Hepburn gets out of a big yellow taxi cab, while Henry Mancini's Moon River plays in the background, in a long elegant black evening gown with her diamond tiara, fabulously large pearl necklace and elbow length black gloves, she walks to the Tiffany's store window to look at the gorgeous jewelry and chandeliers all while enjoying a croissant and a cup of coffee then heading home after a night on the town.  In the film Breakfast at Tiffany's, Audrey Hepburn plays the strong-willed and glamorous female lead, Holly Golightly, who easily captivates viewers through her charming wittiness and saddening desperation.  For Holly Golightly Tiffany's represents the high expectations that she has set for her life, ""I don't want to own anything until I find a place where me and things go together. I'm not sure where that is but I know what it is like. It's like Tiffany's.'  `Tiffany's? You mean the jewelry store.'  `That's right. I'm just CRAZY about Tiffany's!' (Breakfast at Tiffany's).
 Next we meet the nonchalant and attractive Paul Varjac (who Holly calls Fred because of his resemblance to her brother), a struggling writer who is Holly's new neighbor.  From their conversation we quickly learn that they have something in common, they both take money from wealthy admirers.  Ms. Golightly is a very social woman who goes out with many rich men and uses her looks and charming personality to get money from them, whether it be through them giving her fifty dollars for the powder room, or going to visit an ex-mobster in Sing Sing prison and delivering the ""weather report"" to his lawyer.  She always knows when a rich man is present and is ready to seduce him, ""that's Robert Trawler, he just happens to be the ninth richest man under fifty in America...I keep track of these things"" (Breakfast at Tiffany's).  Paul, on the other hand, is having an affair with a very affluent married woman whom he met in Rome and she is paying for his apartment and its decorations and giving him an allowance to live off of.  The intriguing aspect of this shared lifestyle is that they actually acknowledge their need to use lovers ""Holly: Fred, darling...I'd marry you for your money in a minute, would you marry me for my money? Paul: In a minute.  Holly: I guess its lucky neither of us is rich, huh?"" (Breakfast at Tiffany's).  Ultimately Paul's feelings for Holly move from friendship to love causing him to end his affair, but Holly has her heart set on marrying Jose, a suave, wealthy South American. This leaves the viewers rooting for Paul and yearning for Holly to just give into the feelings for him that we all know she has.
 Perhaps one of the most original scenes in the movie is the party scene, in which Holly throws a party in her apartment that gets extremely out of control.  The people who attend this party are swanky and chic and come across as carefree and looking for a good time.  The party quickly becomes extremely crowded and turns into an amusing drunken circus, occurrences range from hats accidentally getting set on fire to women literally hanging on men.  The police are called to break up the party however both of our main characters escape any consequences.
At first Holly comes across as very simple but we later find that she has a great deal of depth.  She is not just a swanky socialite with an easy life, she has had a rough past, involving being orphaned at an early age leaving her to fend for herself and her younger which causes her to marry a rural doctor, who is much older than her, that she does not love romantically.  Another character that deserves some analysis is Mr. Yunioshi, the buck-toothed simple-minded Asian man who lives upstairs.  ""The inclusion of the stereotyped Asian character of Mr. Yunioshi (played by Mickey Rooney) borders on offensive. Mr. Yunioshi's sole purpose is to provide cheap comic relief, but, what might have been funny in 1961 has long since lost its humorous edge. The character's presence is a double blow to the Asian community - not only is he fatuous and uncomplimentary, but he is played by a Caucasian actor in heavy makeup"" (Berardinelli).
 This is one of my all time favorite movies because it is the sort of movie that you can watch when you are having a terrible day and are in need of an emotional boost or when you are in a great mood and simply want to laugh and continue your cheerful mood.  Perhaps this makes me a little bias but I believe there is no doubt that this is a captivating film, which successfully remains simple while still having strong underlying meanings and has very intriguing characters.",1225929600,3,4696,4.730392156862745
5412078,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Audrey Hepburn had a lot of memorable, glamorous roles as highly individual, sensitive young women.

But her most iconic turn was as Holly Golightly, a frivolous young woman with a highly sensitive core. Hepburn is a ball of shimmering charm here, whether she's setting hats on fire or chasing nameless cats through the rain, and she's able to shine brightly enough to obscure a few flaws (such as Mickey Rooney). The other actors do serviceable jobs, but she's undeniablythe star.

""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a daily ritual for Holly Golightly (Hepburn), a social butterfly who hosts parties, entertains drunken men for their fifty-dollartips, and dreams of owning a horse farm in Mexico with her brother. When kept-man Paul Varjak (George Peppard) moves into a neighboring apartment -- courtesy of his rich patroness -- he is instantly enchanted by the ditzy, sweet-natured Holly.

But for all Holly's fun, Paul starts to realize that all is not well with her. She's desperate to marry a spectacularly wealthy man, parties with wild crowds, visits a notorious gangster in jail, and hides that she was an illiterate teen bride to a hick doctor. As Holly's life starts to deteriorate, Paul sets out to show her what her life will be like without real love.

Reportedly Truman Capote wasn't happy with the movie version of ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" -- they changed the ending from his short story's, and he didn't like Hepburn as Holly Golightley. But this is one case where the movie's quality is not reflected by what the author thought of it -- taken on its own merits, it's a fine chocolate with a bittersweet center.

Much of the movie is devoted to the friendship (and unspoken attraction) between Holly and Paul, and how it disrupts their comfortable shallow lives. Paul spends the whole movie unravelling the unhappy tale of Holly's life as she starts spinning out of control. Things climax nastily with Holly's already-questionable reputation being sullied, but the finale is an exquisite mix of brutal honesty, true love and a very unglamorous rainstorm.

That said, it's a pretty hilarious movie -- witty dialogue (""... if you like dark, handsome, rich-looking men with passionate natures and too many teeth"") and plenty of kooky humour (""TIMBER!"" Holly yells as a drunken model keels over, followed by the crowd parting like the Red Sea). And there are plenty of charming, warm'n'fuzzy moments, like the cute day trip through New York.

One thing that will make viewers cringe: Mickey Rooney's caricatured Japanese landlord who objects to Holly's parties. Not. Funny.

Though she was no party girl, Audrey Hepburn is pitch-perfect as Holly -- she can be flaky and adorable (""I'm CRAAAZY about Tiffany's?""), chattery and glamorous, with a cat she refuses to name because they're just a pair of ""poor slobs who don't belong to anybody."" But she can just as easily flip the switch to show the wounded, almost childlike side.

George Peppard is just as good -- albeit less winsome -- as a writer-turned-kept-man-turned-writer-again, whose protective affection for Holly grows as the movie goes on, but who has to get through her ironclad defenses. And Patricia Neal rounds out the cast nicely as the icy, cynical woman whom Paul gives his non-literary services to.

The Centennial Edition of this movie is, like all the others, a two-disc affair. There's a boatload of extras here -- a producer commentary, the original trailer, featurettes about the ""making of"" and about Audrey herself, such as ""Brilliance in a Blue Box"" and ""Audrey's Letter to Tiffany."" And there's also insights into Henry Mancini's score, Asian perspectives on Mr. Yunioshi, and the ""Golightly Gathering."" And so on, and so forth.

Hepburn is the flawed diamond at the heart of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" and her charm and acting ability elevate this beyond just another adorable romantic comedy.",1225238400,,3875,5.0579937304075235
5412079,3,B00AEFXL5W,"Blow away the froth from the top of this movie, and what do you have?  Just more froth and more froth.  The one saving grace is Audrey Hepburn.  She simply looks great.

Hepburn's character in the movie is little more than a high class prostitute.  She is willing to sell herself to the highest bidder.  George Peppard's character is nothing more than a male prostitute who lives comfortably on the donations of a rich woman played by Patricia Neal.  Mickey Rooney is embarrassing as a Japanese neighbor, complete with thick glasses and buck teeth.

Well, it doesn't take a genius to predict that Hepburn and Peppard will give up their sinful ways, with an ending as sweetly sentimental as the tune that won the Academy Award, ""Moon River.""

Realistic, the movie isn't.  It's a sort of urban fairy tale, and in that it is somewhat successful--that and Audrey Hepburn's charm.",1224460800,,875,4.773333333333333
5412080,1,B00AEFXL5W,"I really found this movie quite the antithesis of ""charming."" Now, admittedly, Hepburn and Peppard were two very attractive, physically appealing people. However, I couldn't stand their characters. Let's see -- she makes her living by leading rich men on, taking their money and then dumping them at the last minute. He's a ""kept man"", sleeping with a married woman. Why should I like these people?

Furthermore, while people seem to find Holly's dialogue cute, I found Hepburn's performance flighty and really annoying.  Her attempt at a Southern accent during her big scene with Buddy Ebsen is quite laughable.

There's a high pitched, gossipy tone to a lot of the film's dialogue (particulaly, during the party scene) that drives me up the wall. I get the sense that Capote was indeed writing from his personal experience, but why should anyone care about these people's amoral, superficial lives? The development of the romance between the two leads is pretty unrealistic (the shoplifting scene is especially lovely! How romantic!), and Holly's big epiphany at the end of the film is not the least bit believable.

Much has been said about Mickey Rooney's potrayal of Mr. Yunioshi. Even given allowances that Americans were less sensitive about racial depictions 50 years ago, it's impossible to watch Rooney's antics here through 21st century eyes without feeling totally appalled and embarassed. (By the way, Mr. Rooney, I don't need to be ""forgiven"" for hating your performance). It's enough in  and of itself to toss the movie into the historical trash bin.  This just adds some extra sour frosting to this stale cake of a film.

Even if Rooney's scenes were edited out, you'd still end up with a ridiculous movie that would barely past muster as a TV movie on the Lifetime Channel. To any men out there: your significant other will owe you BIG TIME if she makes you sit through this.",1222300800,38,1892,4.9495268138801265

It combines everything a classic should have - great actors (Audrey is tops and Peppard was never better), a great screenplay, a perfect score and New York (as usual) doing its best. The screenplay departs from the Capote's original but it does so in a way which makes the story work and which could be presented on the screen in 1961 - actually, the story is quite daring for the early 60s but you have to read between the lines every now and then to get it. Anyway, why shouldn't you reach for the original book once you are done watching?
In short - How does it look? I must say I'm amazed.

5412084,4,B00AEFXL5W,"There is a lot of love for this movie; that is clear.  `Breakfast at Tiffany's' is usually heralded as a classic film, and has definitely proven to be Audrey Hepburn's most popular movie role.  Truth be told though, this is really nothing more than a romantic comedy; a very good one mind you, but nothing more.  In fact, don't hate me for saying this, but `Breakfast at Tiffany's' reminds me of the type of film I could see Kate Hudson or Jennifer Lopez doing in a year or two.  What makes this film stand out though as noteworthy and has helped garner it that `classic' status is the phenomenal performance given by Audrey Hepburn; a performance that utilizes her natural charm and charisma to create a character that is deeper than the film she inhabits.

Hepburn plays Holly Golightly, a charming and illusive young woman who lives off the affections of wealthy men and dreams of finding a home that makes her feel as warm and fuzzy as the jewelry store Tiffany's.  Holly is not all surface though, for there is a past there that haunts and in a way motivates her current struggles for prominence.  Her character could have seemed generic and clich ridden but Audrey's delivery allows the audience to relate to and understand Holly.

So the story follows Holly as she forms a bonding relationship with her upstairs neighbor Paul.  Paul is a writer and a `kept' man, living off the generosities of the beautiful Mrs. Failenson (2-E).  Paul is fascinated by Holly, completely lost in his infatuation with her, and as their relationship grows so does his love for her, but Holly is not the type of girl you can just fall in love with because Holly is the type of girl afraid of her own heart.

The script is expertly crafted, especially for a film in this genre so overburdened with clichs and unoriginality.  Sure, there are many `familiar' plot twists, but the dialog and character development is sharp enough to forgive the films few missteps.

The one thing that is hard to forgive though is the horrendous performance given by Mickey Rooney as the stereotypical apartment manager Mr. Yunioshi.  He's not even funny, and his over the top antics actually knock this rather enjoyable film down a notch.  `Breakfast at Tiffany's' could have easily garnered itself an `A' from me, for the makings of a cinematic classic are all here, but Rooney ruins the party and drops my overall rating down to a `B'.  What can I say; I just couldn't accept him here.

There is no denying though that Hepburn is pure love (one of the greatest screen actresses of all time, and in my humble opinion far better than her sister) and her performance as Holly Golightly is one of her finest (I would have given her the Oscar that year).  George Peppard matches her greatness frame for frame as Paul, never allowing himself to fall out of minds eye but remaining in step with Hepburn.  Patricia Neal is also memorable as 2-E, delivering a sly and seductive supporting turn (glorified cameo?).

In the end I can say that `Breakfast at Tiffany's' is truly a good movie, almost great even.  It has a lot of supporters and remains a cinematic favorite among many, and I can understand that.  In fact, had Rooney been written out of the script I may be obliged to place `Tiffany's' on my list of greatest romantic comedies of all time, for when you strip away that small sliver of mediocrity you have a glorious gem of a film.",1217980800,,3402,4.625623960066556
5412085,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Breakfast at Tiffany's was one of my mother's favorite movies.  Many times, late at night, you could find yourself outside her TV room listening to her croon the words to Moon River along with the TV.  Many times I'd catch the end of the movie, with Audrey Hepburn, George Peppard and that cat.  And the rain.  Can't forget the rain.  I thought it was all 60s and sentimentality.

Then I rented it for myself.  I had to see what this classic was all about.  I was surprised at how racy it was.  How wild the 60s gold diggers party was.  How crass Peppard's patron was.

And then there were long moments of atmosphere, where I almost fell asleep and missed the whole point.  Because when our heroine finds she must make a choice between remaining the way she is and taking a chance on love, it is anything but sentimentality.

5412088,5,B00AEFXL5W,"What started out as a seedy and truncated tale of a would-be New York socialite in print, turned out to be a much grander and unforgettably intoxicating film. Truman Capote seems to have been going for a Holden Caulfield with a crush, with the original short story. Anybody that's read the novella, definitely comes away feeling that Capote was reaching for the literary stars with it, but in an all too obvious way. Equally reaching though, was the screenplay adapted by George Axelrod, a Hollywood scribe who hadn't yet written his big hit, and surprisingly followed this film up with the much darker `Manchurian Candidate'. But strangely, and for the fortune of a fool, it works, and it works well ... and in both mediums. The story and the film are unconventional in its time, place and alongside its peers.

Audrey Hepburn was, in my mind, in an even greater classic film: `Charade', with a much more endearing performance as well, but most of us will always remember her as Holly Golightly with the orange cat. Holly seems like the girl that a lot of men would want to be with but won't admit. The proposition she puts to the book's Mr. Bell is to:

""Never love a wild thing, Mr. Bell ... That was Doc's mistake. He was always lugging home wild things. A hawk with a hurt wing. One time it was a full-grown bobcat with a broken leg. But you can't give your heart to a wild thing: the more you do, the stronger they get. Until they're strong enough to run into the woods. Or fly into a tree. Then a taller tree. Then the sky. That's how you'll end up, Mr. Bell. If you let yourself love a wild thing. You'll end up looking at the sky.""

Holly was a contrast of a character for a time now vanished, when women were supposed to be less than their parts and quiet, too. Holly was anything but the locked-in house-frau of old America. In both versions, her past, `Doc', comes to pull her away from her independent life and remove her to lesser experiences and lesser moments, lost and wasted on an older man's desire.

Maybe Capote was saying much more than what we've given him credit for with Breakfast at Tiffany's. Maybe he was really speaking about the longing of the soul, the desperation of will, set deep within a person almost unreachable, untreatable. Maybe he was speaking to all women; women feeling carefully stitched into unbelievably cruel and untenable situations like a fourteen year old wife to a much older man on some far away farm. Or maybe he was speaking to all men. Men, who are in grey moments fading fast and isolated, wanting to reach out for some young beauty, some young prize to remind them of someone else, also long faded; older men that would wreck a young girls life unknowingly, just to fill an unquenchable need.

It's difficult to say what Capote was thinking and what he was shooting for. But watching the film and reading the book, the underlying theme is hard to block out and ignore. Hopefully, I'll keep the youthful indifferent perspective of a Paul Varjak, and not the lustful and slobbery gaze of a Doc Golightly or a Rusty Trawler.",1207872000,3,3078,4.548736462093863

My problem is not in the adaptation of the Truman Capote novella--it IS a very different story than what's being told here.  Could you film a version that's closer to Capote's story?  Of course.  But this film works as a stand-alone piece.

My problem is:  how old exactly is Holly supposed to be?  Audrey Hepburn was 31 when she made this movie, and while she's absolutely enchanting in it, SHE LOOKS 31.  But when Buddy Ebsen shows up, he tells George Peppard that Holly was just shy of 14 when they married, and that his first wife died on the 4th of July, 1955.  Since the movie is set in 1961, that would make Holly (at most) all of 20 years old.",1204848000,,725,4.350746268656716
5412091,4,B00AEFXL5W,"It is a timeless story about a woman who was lost and then found (herself).  In fact, her apartment looked like a lost and found box, and her cat was lost then found!

This review is about the movie only.  I believe there is a new release, but I do not know what extras are added.

I read somewhere, when Capote wrote the novel, Holly/Lula Mae was modeled after Marilyn Monroe/Norma Gene.  That's a very important point to keep in mind in order to understand her character.

Holly didn't like herself, at least her old self, so she transformed herself into someone else.  Admirable effort, but she lost her identity along the way.  She really wasn't escaping to a better place, except externally/materially she felt different.

She was a mess, a real phony.  She cared no one, but herself.  She lacks of responsibility, but she was also everyone's inner desire....

People commented on the acting.  I bet that was fashionable at the time.  Nowadays it's the naturalness that's in vogue, so it may be a problem for some people.  It was the period.

I can't say I like the fake Japanese character though.  It's unrealistic.  Have you ever met a Japanese person like that?  I think the DVD should have an option to take that part out as deleted scenes.  They contribute nothing to the storyline, except as a comic relief (and it has plenty of wittier ones).  It was just very out of place.

The costume design is very nice.  It's 1950's at its most glamorous.  Glamorous but not out of place.

""Moon River"" is just brilliant.  A simple song that delivers so much emotion!  Many of us are still drifters waiting for the right one.  That's the ultimate love song for me.

I love the symbolism.  When she found her cat, she found herself.  Cat never had a real name, because she also had no identity.

I was very concerned for the cat in many scenes he appeared.  He was dripping wet in the last scene.  And earlier on, when Holly smashed stuff all over the place (she must be an Aries), Cat was walking through the shards!!!  I wonder how much he was paid for the part....

In any case, it's a fancy fun for guys and gals alike.  It's still relevant today (which is why I think it's good).  I bet we all know someone who is just like Holly.  Do they still give out prize in Cracker Jack?",1202169600,2,2282,4.433414043583535

Like they all did and still do! (Go hang out with Paris Hilton for a few seconds and you'll see how true to life the little gay man from Texas had written it!) But the ""point"" which I must ""point out"" to you is that in each of their efforts to try and become one of these socially, (if not financially), affluent pigs in ""The Big Apple"" of the early 1960's, two very ""real"" people who were ""running away"" from life and from themselves somehow manage to meet, fall in love, and discover that what really does matter is not all of those creature comforts and attitudes that come with being a rich, socially affluent pig, (who calls everyone ""Darling""), but that its their capacity to love someone else, and ""be able to help"" each of their true ""selves"" throughout all of the unknown ""adventures"" to come in this cold, hard, lonely ""fact"" we call a ""life"", for better or worse, that every single damned one of us ""drifters"" must take, first so we can lose, and finally find ""ourselves"", and start our ""life"" over again.

If the joke is not funny: I think to myself ""this guy should be pumping my gas""

  The easiest thing to do in our society today is throw out the race card. The ones keeping racism alive & well in this country are the people who call others racists unjustly.

  It is funny to me how people criticize this era (50's-60's) as being uptight, when very few people today can take a joke concerning this subject. People are different & when someone points this out in a humorous way it is simply......A JOKE. It is not racism or mean-spirited, that is simply the way it is construed 40-some years after the fact, when we all live in an ultra-sensitive world, where everyone is scared #&*@less of offending anyone else.

5412104,4,B00AEFXL5W,"BaT is one of those films that gives viewers an insight into the lives and mindset of an entire period. Audrey Hepburn plays impulsive-yet-fragile Holly Golightly, a young woman living the high life in New York City around 1960. There is much about the film that is bizarre and almost otherworldly. Holly is a woman of exquisite taste and fantastic connections, with a perhaps non-existent body of work and (beyond comic scamming of her rich dates) no evident means of support. She doesn't seem to be a movie star, and (regardless of how Truman Capote may have written her originally) shows little evidence of being a call girl. She throws lavish parties, loves to hang around Tiffany's and lives alone in a largish apartment in notoriously expensive NYC. She may or may not be nave about the ""weather reports"" she is asked to pass along, for a modest stipend, by a mobster she visits weekly in Sing-Sing prison. She quickly starts up a relation-by-fire-escape with Paul Varjak, a young writer who moved into the apartment upstairs. Varjak is a ""kept"" man, who is supported by a middle-aged society woman. Predictably, the two young people fall in love, though Holly is notoriously skittish about commitments of any kind.

The film is smart, based on a story by Capote, and exudes a tamed version of debauched high society hijinks that must have seemed shocking when the film was released. Alcohol flows copiously at Holly's parties, with people dancing with more or less wild abandon until the cops arrive to quiet things down. The idea of mixing Holly up with narcotics dealers is pretty edgy also, as is the clear indication of the sexual relationship between Varjak and his married benefactrice. Indeed, the sexual tension is kept rather high throughout the film. In one memorable scene, Holly escapes a drunken date by climbing a window into Varjak's apartment. Holly is clad only in a nightgown, and Varjak, in bed after an assignation with his lover, is seemingly naked under the covers. Their conversation, held on Varjak's bed, is at once titillating and awkward.
But all is not as it seems. In spite of her seeming sophistication, Holly has commitments ""back home"" in Arkansas. Her impulse is always to flee, which threatens her budding romance with Varjak. The rest of the film deals with whether she will run away once again or settle down with a man who loves her.

BaT fascinates by giving us a glimpse into Holly -- an intriguing and beguiling creature -- and the life she leads. Who is she? And how does she manage to both attract and keep so many men at bay? Hepburn gives us the 1950s-vintage portrait of the alluring female, ever in search of a sugar daddy. Yet this is also what modern eyes find repellent. Holly may be presented as the charming sum of her behaviors, but psychologically, she is a mess. She drinks too much, pretends not to understand she is being manipulated, cavorts in the scandalous limelight. She is almost a cartoon -- hardly someone who could be understood as real. Yet Hepburn brings a charm, cuteness and vulnerability to make the film very engaging. By the end of the film, you will have fallen for her like everyone else.

The rest of the cast stands out -- George Peppard as Varjak, Martin Balsam as Holly's agent, and Buddy Ebsen as her back-home interest. The only sour note is played by Mickey Rooney, who plays a stereotypical buck-toothed, myopic Japanese neighbor forever banging into things and threatening to summon the police to ends Holly's noisy parties.

BaT is still worth the watch after 40 years, if only to observe the world that many found fascinating in an age that considered itself more optimistic and innocent than our own.",1183593600,5,3693,4.80188679245283

But she is also a frail creature harboring secrets, and Hepburn plays both sides exquisitely. Peppard is solid and likable as writer Paul, Holly's admirer and confidante, while Patricia Neal chews on her steely role as Paul's wealthy older mistress.

It focuses on various occurrences in her life, primarily on her love interests (which are contingent entirely on money).

When Hepburn throws her cat out of a cab into the rain, it left me wondering why he didn't do the same to Hepburn. Her character is so unlikeable it's nearly impossible to describe.

I really could care less about Ms. Golightly because this character has no morally redeeming value. She is a user, an opportunist and abuser of other people's kindness. She is a party girl that has the complexity of a paper doll.

I can't believe viewers actually forgive Audrey's character at the end. She doesn't deserve the viewer's love and appreciation as she spends 95% of the movie caring for herself and using others which makes any intelligent viewer not care about her (even going to the point of praying for some bloody comeuppance).

5412121,4,B00AEFXL5W,"We had not planned to watch ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" (1961) on our movie night, but when the song ""Moon River"" started playing, it was hard not to get caught up in the film. The opening scene has got to be one of the most haunting in film history, with Audrey Hepburn strolling down a Manhattan street at five o'clock in the morning, glamorously attired, a paper cup of coffee in hand, nibbling a pastry, while pausing to gaze longingly into the window of Tiffany's jewery store. Never has anyone looked so lost.

Made at the dawn of the sexual revolution, the film captures the angst of modern life, with the all the loneliness, the frantic striving for wealth at any price, seeking in material pleasures a happiness which remains elusive. The ""Holly Golightly"" character, nimbly portrayed by Miss Hepburn, embodies the lifestyle of so many contemporary young women, sans the Givenchy gowns, in whose lives there have often been many lovers but very little true love. The George Peppard character, ""Paul"" the writer-gigolo, was shocking at the time the film debuted. He, too, like so many modern people, knows a lot about sex but nothing of love. He longs for love, nevertheless. Paul, like Holly, is trapped in a lifestyle from which there seems to be no escape. Hope is presented in the awakening of love, and the desire for commitment, from which Holly flees like a bird.

The film would be nothing without the Henry Mancini song ""Moon River,"" written for Audrey's limited vocal range. Although the words speak of a youthful desire to see the world, when Audrey sings it, she captures a deeper level of meaning, an intense yearning for home, for a family setting that is no more. It is essentially a mourning of lost innocence. Holly had lost her innocence by age fourteen, when she married a man old enough to be her father; instead of being a much-needed parent, he became a lover, and perhaps that is what set her on the path to promiscuity. Underneath her carefree exterior, she is tormented at the very core of her being, as is demonstrated when she smashes up her apartment upon hearing the that her only brother has died.

When hearing the song ""Moon River"" as a child, I always thought of the river not far from our house. It was a yellow muddy river due to the cow manure and silt from the fields, but on a summer night, beneath the glimmering of the moon, it became beautifully surreal, connoting the magic and mystery of places far away. How often the youthful longing to see the world is replaced with the nostalgia for home, after the world has been seen and tasted. There is no going back home, only going forward, while creating structures of stability for the new generation. Paul and Holly standing in the rain at the end of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" hugging a soggy cat, while a choir sings ""Moon River"" in the background, is almost like a gleam of promise. Amid the despair, depravity and chaos of modernity, a man and woman can still find each other, commit to each other, and build a life of meaning for themselves and for others.",1171497600,14,3055,4.643253234750462
5412122,5,B00AEFXL5W,"I've always wanted to watch this movie and I am so glad that I watched it finally. Truly it is very classic and very timeless.

I am not going to repeat the story and praise the cast for their brilliant acting since so many of the reviewers here have already done these. But one thing I really find interesting and want to talk about is the similarity and difference between this movie and Sex and the City.

I was a fan of Sex and the City for a long time, ..... until I watched this movie. I have to admit that if I had watched it earlier, I probably would never have spent so much time watching Sex and the City.  There are actually many scences in S&C resemble those in Breakfast at Tiffany's. Both story happened in NYC. East Manhattern, whistling for a cab, charming uptown streets and buildings, lonely and smoking girls, wild parties, chasing after rich men, dreaming for a final settlement. I have no doubt that the director or producers of S&C have gotten their inspirations from Breakfast at Tiffany's. And Carol( Sarah Parker) has indubitably tried to imitate the classic and iconic image Holly (Audrey Hepburn)has created. Despite that both heroines's similar life style, Holly is the one that wins my heart and makes everyone  to love her, both in the movie and among the audience. Do I like Carol? Not that much. There is somewhere deep in my heart that's been touched by the childish naivty of Holly and her blatant statement of her being the wild thing and the courage with which she faced her bumpy life. Compared to her, Carol looks superficial, not as brave or even as wild, and shows a pseudo-sophistication. Of course, there are other parts of Carol that show her charm. But in my opinion, Carol is not as iconic and as charming as Holly,  as the latter truly established her as the brave-dreaming,couragous-acting NYC girl who somewhat still kept her inside purity and childish artlessness. These are all shown without reservation when Holly and Paul stole the animal masks from the store, Holly's love for the cat, and Holly's song playing of the ""Moonriver"". I guess that's why even in S&C, when Big is leaving Carol, he played the exact same classic song, The Moonriver. But the sadness aroused by this song in S&C is nowhere compared to the delicate and beautiful melancholy created in Breakfast at Tiffany's.",1169683200,4,2336,4.673965936739659

Peppard ditches his humiliating life as a parasite, and gets a job. Hepburn, who is what used to be called a B-girl (I think), not a prostitute or a call-girl or an escort, finally sheds the sleaze and finds true love. In the 30s she might have been a Manhattan baby. Moon River is about as different from that dreadful whiney thing in Cowboy as it possibly could be, written by the unmatchable Johnny Mercer. The only rats are the punters and snobs, and the hornily heartless middle-aged lady.

You have heard the title somewhere, you read about it at someplace or maybe you have heard the famous musical theme by Henry Mancini? Yes, it's hard not to have heard of this classic masterpiece in some sort of way.

The film is mostly known because of the wonderfully charming performance by Audrey Hepburn. She is indeed the element that still keeps the film alive and away from ""being forgotten"" by younger generations 45 years after it's original release in the thearters. Now, that is the power Hepburn has, entertaining you endlessly even if you are watching this film for the 100th time.
Hepburn alone can be a reason to buy this film.
Next to Hepburn is the cool, also charming, George Peppard in a role that has also made this an absolute classic film. He and Hepburn are one of the best onscreen couples I have ever seen! The chemistry is maqnificent and gives a great feeling of enjoyment.
So the acting is of the best way possible and keeps you entertainted till the screen turns black at the very end of the film.

The rest of the film is absolutely fine and professionally done. Great directing from legend Blake Edwards (the man behind the Pink Panter series), absolutely wonderfull and enchanting music by Henri Mancini that lifts up every scene, great setdesign and good lighting. Another thing not to be forgotten is the costumdesign. Fantastic clothing makes Hepburn even more enchanting than she already is and George Peppard looks like a fine gentleman in his suits.

Being a funny comedy, Breakfast at Tiffany's also has some great dramatic moments. The best thing about these dramatic moments is that the actors are totally believable in how they react to each other and feel by one another. The expressions on George Peppard's face as he experiences something is absolutely fantastic. Then of course there is Audrey Hepburn, simply one of the best actresses ever, who gives an absolutely unforgettable performance that grabs you. One look in her eyes at those dramatic moments (or at any other moment) and you're sold.

From the story (written by Truman Capote) to the music, from the acting to the clothing, from Hepburn's hair to Hepburn's toes: everything in this film is absolutely classic and enjoyable. My guess is that this film will be everylasting. In another 45 years, people will still be talking about this film and will still be charmed by it's absolutely delicious character.
If you are a fan of romantic comedies or great classic movies and you haven't this one yet, all I can say is this: you are in for a maqnificently pleasing experience you will always remember.

5412141,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Blake Edward's masterpiece is  bright, funny, intelligent, and thoroughly winning, thanks to his deft direction and the singular presence of its stars.  Stunningly gowned by Givenchy, Audrey Hepburn makes the part of Holly Golightly completely her own, and is so captivating, one couldn't care less how greatly the film differs from Truman Capote's much darker novella.  George Peppard is her praiseworthy partner in his most memorable role.  To better complement his spirited co-star, he plays Paul Varjak quietly, radiating a natural humor, pride, warmth, and grace.  With astonishing blue eyes, perfect hair, cardigans, tweed jackets, and penny loafers, Paul is achingly handsome and infinitely desirable.

New York shines in a way that no place can anymore. The film is an unabashed love letter to the City where, in 1961, gorgeous young people could live quirky, bohemian lives in brownstones on the Upper East Side, expect to be treated with courtesy and humor in upscale enclaves like Tiffany's (but not, I'm afraid, in the Public Library), and throw parties that you'd love to attend, with delightfully zany guests.

A professional escort, Holly's dates give her $50 for the powder room and another $50 for cab fare.  A struggling writer, Paul is kept in style by a rich older woman.  But no matter: these pesky realities, played down to appease 60's sensibilities (and censors), become moot in the refracted light of their beauty, style, and poignant vulnerability.

Modern viewers are justly scandalized by Mickey Rooney's shamelessly stereotyped Japanese neighbor, but one must simply chalk it up to a silly theatrical convention of the time.  Countering this unfortunate image is the appearance of a rather chic Japanese woman,  presented with no special inflection whatsoever, at Holly's kooky cocktail party.

Elegant photography sets the stage, and Henry Mancini's Oscar-winning music frames it.  From the poignant opening musical sequence to the last full-orchestra arrangement of `Moon River', with soaring French Horn obligato, Mancini displays his complete mastery.

Quirky, witty, modern, fashionable, yet flowing over an undercurrent of unexplainable sadness.

Holly Golightly (I must say I have never seen an actress look more beautiful and apt in her role) plunges a viewer into a strange state of mind. She makes him happy and sad at the same time. Happy for obvious reasons but sad because behind her merry facade lies someone who is progressively falling into a chaos due to her own indiscretion and indecision. And you feel for that other person mainly because of the amazing talent of Hepburn at being able to convey small nuances of her character.

The movie made me sad. Extremely sad, as I fell in love with Hepburn. Her vulnurability has made me a fan of her for life and I am sad that her charisma, her charm is not present anymore. Personally, I feel that such works of art and perfection like Audrey should last for ever :-).",1159315200,12,1222,4.67906976744186

The film follows the pair as they get to know each other, accept their feelings, and deal with their lot in life.

Objectively, there's not much plot. We jump around Holly and Paul's life, and are treated to some startling revelations of Holly's past and her current dealings. It feels disjointed, and even somewhat hard to believe at times. But really, what you're here for is Audrey Hepburn. She captivates. She shines. She enchants. I instantly fell in love with her when I saw this film. Simply put, Audrey made me believe in happy endings again. There's a lot to be said in that.

The movie is based on a novel by Truman Capote (the subject of last year's ""Capote"" and this year's ""Injustice"") and stars Audrey Hepburn in one of her most famous roles. For anyone who didn't know this, Hepburn doesn't play a character named Tiffany...Tiffany's is the name of a jewelry store. Anyway,

Hepburn plays Holly Golightly, an eccentric playgirl who lives in a barren apartment with a nameless cat and uses men as a way to make money. She's not a golddigger, but whatever she is...It's pretty close. Holly needs money and she's in the middle of looking for a wealthy man to marry when the less-than-wealthy Paul Varjak (George Peppard), a writer, moves in next door. The two exchange romance candor and Holly begins calling him Fred (after her brother, who's in the army). The romance doesn't seem like it's going anywhere; After all, Holly is looking for Mr. ""Rich"" Right and Paul (Fred) is a poor writer who also seems to be a kind of male prostitute to one woman who lives in 2E. Of course, this is a romantic-comedy so you know that they're going to hook up...But what happens in between is actually pretty entertaining and funny. I suppose most of the humor comes from the fact that the film is directed by Blake Edwards (of The Pink Panther fame)...The majority of comedic relief comes from Mr. Yunioshi (Mickey Rooney), the ""Japanese"" manager of Holly's building who has to frequently remind her to keep the noise down. Mr. Yunioshi is, of course, a tanned Mickey Rooney with fake teeth yelling in a fake accent. He's hilarious though, truly a great character. Another character I liked was the cat, Cat. Sure it's a simple character, but I don't know man...The cat was cool. Hepburn and Peppard's chemistry is great, this movie was made in 1961 but the picture is perfect.

This is truly a gem from the 60s. If you liked movies like When Harry Met Sally, then you should definitely like this. A wonderful movie.

I didn't know where the urge came from, or how long it would last, so I figured that I should choose a very special movie just in case it vanished as quickly as it came.  Fortunately for me, I chose Breakfast at Tiffany's, and now I think I'll go hunting for more of the same.

In a nutshell, Holly Golightly (a radiant Audrey Hepburn) is an unconventional young woman who lives life on the edge on Manhattan's Upper East Side.  She's very impulsive and money-oriented, and spends her evenings flirting with older male acquaintances upon whose generosity she survives and thrives.  Her favorite place in the world is Tiffany's, the famous jewellery store that calms her down on ""mean red"" days. Her erratic behavior irritates her upstairs neighbor, an unfortunately cast Mickey Rooney, who's as Japanese as American Pie, and quite offensive as a stereotype.  She's also friendly with an imprisoned mob boss named Sally Tomato whom she visits weekly and talks about the weather.

When a struggling writer (George Peppard) moves into the building, she instantly recognizes him as a kindred spirit, especially when she learns that he also accepts money from the opposite sex for services rendered.  Finding in him a sympathetic ear, a sounding board and willing accomplice all in one, the two become friends through good times and bad, even when her husband Doc Golightly (Buddy Ebsen) shows up with an ultimatum of his own.  Male friends come and go, and bad luck seems to follow her around, but Holly bears it all in style with a gorgeous wardrobe, an unsinkable attitude, a long cigarette holder and plenty of booze for back-up.

A classic movie deserves an award winning soundtrack, and this movie has one mega-famous signature song.  Audrey Hepburn may not have the best singing voice on the world, but when she sings Henry Mancini's ""Moon River"" you'll find yourself singing along too.

Like Tiffany's, this movie is another sure-fire cure for the mean reds.

5412149,5,B00AEFXL5W,"A beautiful debonair named Holly Golightly leaves her husband and moves into Manhattan with an ambition to meet a wealthy man, marry him, and then name her pet cat, and enjoy the rest of her life. This sounds like an ambition of a typical young woman, but when Holly meets a young writer named Paul Varjak; there is no love at first; but that changes gradually and love blossoms. One would like to think this is a love story, but not quite, the author is not Erich Segal. Truman Capote wrote this short novel about a woman who is in pursuit of a high society life and never finds one; and she never grows up. The movie deviates from Capote's book in several areas. Capote wrote this book with Marilyn Monroe on his mind for the lead role, but the role went to Audrey Hepburn; director Blake Edwards couldn't have made a better choice. This is one of the classic movies of Hepburn in which every member of the audience becomes enchanted and captivated with the beauty and passion of Holly played by Hepburn. This wisp-thin actress, carrying a long cigarette holder is one of the iconic images of American Cinema.

In the final part of the movie when Holly was dumped by her rich Brazilian fiance, her friend Paul Varjak helps her recollect; and in a reconciliatory term she changes her heart only to fall in love with Varjak. This scene was shot in the middle of pouring rain in Manhattan that adds a touch of pure romance and a grand finale to the endless pursuit of Holly in search of a rich man. Everyone who loves happy ending would love this; but no one was unhappy than Capote who was upset for the change; he wanted Holly to remain as a mysterious woman who never learns and never gives up her dream. My favorite part of the movie is the film's on-location opening sequence, in which Holly gazes into a Tiffany's display window after getting out from a cab in mid-town Manhattan, while eating a pastry; and of course the scene kissing Varjak in the middle of pouring rain in Manhattan. This movie shows more scenes of streets of Manhattan than any other movie I have seen. I highly recommend listening to the hit song of the American rock group Deep Blue Something's ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" which adds to the enjoyment. Of course the music in the movie is strongly supported by Henry Mancini.

Many of us from the days of ""A Team"" know George Peppard as a tough talking Colonel Smith. It is a pleasant surprise for many of us to see this DVD and witness the tender side of young Peppard as Paul Varjak. Paul is strong, yet remains as an acquaintance of Holly but gradually he sees the feminine side of Holly, who is vulnerable, yet romantic in her heart. Blake Edwards indicated at one stage that he might not have cast Peppard if he were to do this all over again. We are unsure if there was a problem in their working relationship or Edwards was unhappy with his casting. I for one who was most disappointed to learn that Peppard was not nominated for academy award for his role in this movie. Buddy Ebsen and Mickey Rooney have limited role; yet they delight the audience with their talents and craftsmanship.",1149465600,5,3120,4.500881834215168

Rooney is a great actor so its not an issue with him, more of a comment on the times perhaps.  I agree with most of the review of the past reviewer who wrote a bit about Japanese people, except to say, ""Ainu-shmamu""!!

It's a classic movie for its time, in many ways much more interesting dialog than in movies these days, timeless subject matter.  What can you say about Audrey Hepburn...

5412151,5,B00AEFXL5W,"""Breakfast at Tiffany s"" (1961) is simply a classic, one of those films you just need to watch. I did that tonight. Why didn t I watch it before? I suppose I wasn t curious enough, and I didn t  think that this movie could live up to the buzz. Thankfully, I was wrong.

The story takes place in New York, and is based on a novella written by Truman Capote, adapted to the screen by George Axelrod and directed by Blake Edwards. The cast is simply wonderful, and the wardrobe, stunning.

One of the main characters is the exquisitely beautiful Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), an enchanting young woman with many secrets that lives off the gifts given to her by older men. Holly has a cat without a name, because ""The way I see it I haven't got the right to give him one. We don't belong to each other. We just took up one day by the river. I don't want to own anything until I find a place where me and things go together. I'm not sure where that is but I know what it is like. It's like Tiffany's"".

Holly s main purpose in life is to marry someone with lots of money, and finally be free. There is a small flaw in her plan, though: it doesn t take into account the fact that she might fall in love. However, that is just what might happen when she discovers a new neighbour, Paul Varjak (George Peppard), a struggling writer financed by an older woman, that happens to be very handsome and easy to talk to. When Holly and Paul meet, a friendship begins to develop between them. But can something else happen, when Paul has no money, and Holly is afraid of being in love and belonging to someone? Watch this film, and find out!

5412178,4,B00AEFXL5W,"I like this movie and I'd give it more stars except for just one thing. Ill-explained plot twists. Is Doc Golightly actually no longer married to Holly or did Holly lie to Paul/Fred about her marriage annulled? What is the Japanese man upstairs doing in Holly's apartment when the cops Holly for possible narcotics connections? I thought the neighbor was having her arrested for having too much noise but no the police are there on their own business. About Mickey Rooney playing a Japanese man. I don't mind critical comments about it but I hope you who are so critical all get just as angry at actors Marlon Brando and James Caan for playing Italians in the Godfather when in reallife neither is/was Italian. A few words on Japanese people anyway. Many of them are part Ainu and are actually somewhat caucasian looking anyway. They are often only semi-mongoloid looking anyway (unlike vietnamese). So Mickey Rooney being caucasian under the Japanese makeup doesn't hurt that much in credibility since his character could be part caucasian Ainu. Not a fan of his am I but I say Rooney (pro he is) turns in a very decent performance if you can get past his playing a nationality he really isn't (if that's wrong it's wrong for an actor to play any nationality he or she really isn't).

On aspects of the film which I am not critical Audrey Hepburn is perfect for Holly Golightly. She is a feast for the eyes as she is amazingly sexy and she had much talent but her character does give the impression she sleeps around (contrary to what another poster said). She turns out to be rather vulnerable in ways that are appealingly human. I would take it that the way she is vulnerable is probably closer to the real life Audrey Hepburn than her character's more selfish aspects.

Peppard and Ebsen are very talented too. Patricia Neal is quite a talented performer herself but having another lady character in an important role in the film wasn't vital since Hepburn is more than enough for two movies. Neal's character could have been just referred to by Peppard rather than actually seen.",1145750400,,2084,4.706849315068493
5412179,2,B00AEFXL5W,"Don't get me wrong, Breakfast at Tiffany's is definitely a classic, mainly because of Audrey Heburn's immortal portray of Holly Golightly. This was apparently HER movie, she was the epitome of beauty, class, and style in this role. I've tried to watch this movie twice without thinking about the hype...personally, this movie was boring to me. The love story is sweet, but nothing worth bragging home about. I loved Audrey Hepburn, but the character to me got kind of old. Yes, she's stunning, a tad bit eccentric, witty, and she wears designer clothes and loves money, but if you took away all that there would be no character at all! I found her to be a tad bit superficial, annoying and spoiled. There's nothing about this character to like other than what she wears and how she acts or talks. But this is just my opinion...this will always be a classic, but it doesn't necessarily mean that everyone has to like it or love it simply because it's Audrey Hepburn wearing a chic black dress and staring up at a Tiffany's window.",1144540800,16,1029,4.65934065934066
5412180,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Based on the novella by Truman Capote, Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961) is one of those classic, quintessential New York City movies, like Sweet Smell of Success, The World of Henry Orient and Manhattan. It is a snapshot of the city at a particular point in time. It is also one of Audrey Hepburn's signature roles that she will always be remembered for.

Audrey Hepburn is absolutely adorable as Holly, an irresistible, charming individual. Under Holly's bubbly exterior, Hepburn's performance hints at a loneliness, an inner sadness. She conveys a heartbreaking vulnerability underneath her cheery faade. One gets the feeling that she needs to be rescued, to be saved and this gives the film a melancholic tone.

She was wonderful chemistry with George Peppard who plays it cool, downplaying his role which acts as a nice contrast to Hepburn's flamboyance. He has a tough job of playing the straight man to Hepburn's colourful Holly. He is the audience surrogate. However, Peppard is excellent because he knows exactly how to react to all of Holly's outrageous behaviour. At first, his character seems a bit on the bland side but as the film progresses we get bits and pieces of his past which flesh out his character.

The extras are a mixed bag at best.

There is an audio commentary by the film's producer Richard Shepherd. He candidly speaks about his opposition to Rooney playing a Japanese man but Edwards wanted his scenes kept in. There are quite a few lulls of silence between comments which makes listening to this track something of a chore.

""The Making of a Classic"" is a retrospective featurette. Shepherd wanted Hepburn to play Holly but Paramount didn't think she was right for the part. Cast members, friends and family gush about Hepburn. Blake Edwards recounts some decent anecdotes about filming and admits that he didn't want Peppard to play Paul but grew to appreciate him.

""It's so Audrey! A Style Icon"" examines Hepburn's look in the movie. She was not considered a classic beauty but was very beautiful. She flew against the voluptuous Jayne Mansfield type popular in the 1950s.

""Brilliance in a Blue Box"" takes a look at the famous jewelry store Tiffany's. They talk about the famous Tiffany Canary diamond - the largest at the time - and how Hepburn was one of the select few that ever got the chance to wear it. Some of the store's history is covered but this feels suspiciously like a promo for the store.

""Audrey's Letter to Tiffany's."" Hepburn was a huge admirer of the store and wrote a preface for the 50th Anniversary book in 1987. This letter is read by one of the store's representatives.

Finally, there is the original theatrical trailer.",1142899200,4,2678,4.855263157894737

The ""So Audrey"" is so dreary. Instead of seeing costume tests for the movie or background for designs for Miss Hepburn we get a parade of movie clips from Tiffany's and other Audrey Hepburn movies from the studio. It would have been interesting to have some background on the design for the movie and the famous ""feud"" of Edith Head signing sketches of Givency's creations (i.e. the ""Little Black Dress"") Then there is the commentary by the producer who naters on and on about such things as the use of the typewriter in the movie is so dated and the fact that upon seeing a closeup of Buddy Epson ""How blue his eyes are"" and the tiresome ""in hindsight"" he wouldn't have cast Mickey Rooney in the comic role of the Japanese Photographer. Wouldn't it have been more interesting to hear Blake Edward's take on it?  And, in fact Blake Edwards Commentary itself? Why Hepburn took the role, how she prepared.  The viewer gets no inside knowledge as to why the movie became a classic in the first place. All we get is ""Now we are in New York; Now, this shoot is in Hollywood"".

This was my 3rd copy of this film (one was a present), but since there are not a lot of features on any of Audrey's DVD's, and this one had a feature just on her, I couldn't resist.

Of course Hepburn is too stuborn to risk it all with this poor writer (Peppard) so she tries to marry a rich man.

I think it has something to do with the time and place when it was made, a carefree time that exists no longer and a time when new mores were coming into vogue. It has an IN quality about it, yet underneath it all, there remains a search for what life is really all about and what really makes us happy, in a fulfilling way, after all those cocktails have been downed and the cigarette smoke has cleared.

5412190,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Where Roman Holiday was Audrey Hepburn as a girl on the verge womanhood, in Breakfast at Tiffany's Audrey is full grown.

Breakfast at Tiffany's has become what Truman Capote is most synonymous for.  The centers around Holly Golightly.  Holly lives off the goodness of older men.  Or as she puts it, off the money they give her for tips.  (I am sure in the book she did more than that but in the movie, she never sleeps with the men.)

Into her life comes Paul (George Peppard), a would be writer.  He has his first book published but not it was not a great success.  He is writing his follow-up with the support of his female benefactor (Patricia Neal) (who he does sleep with).

Paul becomes entranced with Holly and the become fast friends.  Holly's life becomes complicated, first by the arrival of her first husband (Buddy Ebsen) and then a scandal involving a prisoner she visits and brings back ""weather reports"" from, Sally Tomato.  Paul discovers that his feelings for her are more than friends.

The other two principal featured characters are her harried upstairs Japanese neighbor (Mickey Rooney - yes that's right) and Cat, a stray cat she takes care of.

The other star of the film is ""Moon River"" the Oscar winning song by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer.

This film was the first breakaway hit for Blake Edwards and became his signature film.

5412191,4,B00AEFXL5W,"The early 1960s were a sophisticated time (as opposed to our meaner and more jaded times of today), which was reflected in many of the movies that were made then. The center of life and thought seemed to be in the cities, and the city mouse was king. Many movies tried to capture this (THE APARTMENT, A MAN AND A WOMAN, come immediately to mind), as did this movie as well.

Audrey Hepburn is Holly Golightly, a Manhattan latcher-on-to-rich-men coquette (one hesitates to say call girl because sex seems absent), and George Peppard is her neighbor, a writer who's a ""kept"" man himself. The movie is about their gradually falling in love, though Hepburn continues to look for that rich man who will give her the life of luxury she craves. After trials and tribulations, they end up together.

Hepburn is too light and ""innocent"" in her role - one expects more of a wordly-wise, rougher-around-the-edges character to be Holly. And the picture as a whole is all too neat and worked out: it goes on too long getting to the resolution we knew was going to take place almost from the start. The final scene in the rain is a classic though, borrowed many times in other movies (for example, THE GOODBYE GIRL). Peppard is very good, too: he's very subdued with just the right feel. And that sophistication I talked about earlier is always present. Of course there's MOON RIVER, too. Not a bad movie - worth a watch.",1132876800,4,1407,4.601593625498008
5412192,5,B00AEFXL5W,So much has already been said and written about this movie that I don't feel I can add or detract from those previous reviews except to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and have qualms about recommending it to anyone.,1129420800,5,217,4.45
5412193,3,B00AEFXL5W,"I was very impressed by Audrey Hepburn's Oscar winning performance in Roman Holiday so I was really looking forward to this movie Breakfast at Tiffany's.

What do I have to report after seeing it? I have to say that it is a mixed bag. Let me explain.

First the positives: Firstly, I have not yet seen a movie in which Audrey was so stylish. If you are into fashion and style that alone is good enough for seeing this movie. Audrey loses some of the innocence and freshness from her Roman Holiday days but gains in sex appeal and glamour. Her wardrobe in this movie is quite stunning. Even the dcor of her apartment looks good.

Secondly, she has a fairly good chemistry with Peppard and the fact that the two are in the same age bracket helps in that regard.

Thirdly, Audrey Hepburn's acting in this movie is superb, she got an Oscar nomination for it.

Fourthly, Moon River the song that Holly (Audrey) sings is great and the tune itself is haunting.

The negatives: The story gets off to a fine start, Audrey plays the part of an escort (a call girl but it the early 60's so that is not what she is called in the movie), Peppard plays the role of a struggling writer who is kept by a rich older woman as her companion.

Now in this movie Holly (Audrey) is the kind of woman who is terrified of relationships, so much so that she does not even name her cat. Her only aim in life is to snare some rich man so when she starts falling in love with Peppard's character she does not know how to react.

What a great start, one would expect the story to race ahead but it exactly here that things come to a grinding stop. It is obvious in the first twenty minutes of the movie that they would fall in love but the next hour or so of the movie does nothing to build on that. It is only in the last ten minutes of the movie that things come to a head.

I think one of the reasons why her first movie Roman Holiday held the viewer's interest throughout it's length despite it's rather flimsy storyline was the character development that her and Gregory Peck's character go through.

In that movie Audrey character (Princess Ann) goes from an immature princess, to a drunk, to a wide-eyed ingnue to woman in love to regal stateswoman. In Breakfast at Tiffany's however Audrey's character is basically the same the entire length of the movie and there is nothing else happening with Peppard's character also to get the movie into fast track. The story chugs along slowly till the end comes. The ending I must say is pretty romantic, but the overall impression that the movie leaves is that Breakfast at Tiffany is average fare nowhere in the same class as Roman Holiday or My Fair Lady.

I would also like to say that Mickey Rooney's depiction of a Japanese man is extremely insensitive. It was the early 60's so maybe society was not so understanding then, but what leaves me sad is that even now there are some people who think that the depiction is funny. I am reminded of the Bruce Lee movie, Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story in which the martial arts legend spends a romantic night out with his American wife and they end up seeing Breakfast at Tiffany's. At the end of the movie Bruce Lee is hurt and angry that Hollywood still did not treat Asian people with respect. Poor Bruce Lee, he should have known that some things never change. In this world bigotry is never out of fashion.

It would be fair to point out that Mickey Rooney's role is pretty minor so if you can shut your eyes to it this movie still has a lot to offer.",1127606400,10,3521,4.342465753424658

A classic chic-flick about a mis-understood girl just bubbling over with emotion and unsure of what to do about it.  Although the plot is somewhat thin and confusing at times, and the ending leaves you wondering how they got there, the ending is one of those sweet true-love moments that can really bust you up.  I felt kind of sorry for the cat, and it seemed to have a rather central role in much of the action.  Still, it earns a 4 star rating as being a classic film with some really good acting at times and some truly beautiful music that leaves you rather moved.",1125964800,,729,4.338235294117647
5412196,4,B00AEFXL5W,"Years before The Coen Brothers unleashed their trademark eccentric characters and even before Woody Allen got on the scene with his endless talkies, Blake Edwards gave us this subtle but weird comedy that seems to be overlooked by most audiences desensitised by films like Mud in Manhattan, Hitch and the latest Bridget Jones crap.

What most of these films lack is a strong sense of character and involvement in their world. You really do feel drawn into the relationship between Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), a teenage runaway who ended up a high-class escort in New York and Paul 'Fred' Varjak (a youthful George Peppard) a writer/gigolo who has had nothing to inspire him of late until Holly came into his life. The only time caricature comes into the film is Mickey Rooney's Japanese landlord (and he's not Japanese), but he hardly features that much for it to be annoying.

The film has a lot in common with There's Something About Mary, which I am sure owes most of its ideas to. Almost every man who meets Holly falls head over heels in love with her but it takes someone just like her for Holly to love back. Both Holly and Paul are struggling to make their own way in the city. Both have to sell themselves to the opposite sex in order to make ends meet. While Paul just wants to be a successful writer, Holly is desperate to marry a rich millionaire to snag some of the fortune for herself and take care of her brother once he leaves the army. Her escort girl lifestyle is taking its toll on her so much that 6am is only the end of the night for her and not morning. As a result she eats a fast food breakfast on a deserted street while longingly window-shopping at Tiffany's, a shop she'll probably never afford to buy from. However you just know that, despite not having much money, Holly and Paul will take good care of each other by the end of the movie.

What gives this film a unique charm on top of the performances are the many oddball moments and quirky touches. Most of them supplied by Holly's cat, known simply as Cat. And Henry Mancini's score (before he and Blake Edwards teamed up for the famous Pink Panther) seems right out of a Broadway musical and plays a strong part in making the movie what it is. There's no generic piano cues or pop songs here.

I haven't read the book so I cannot compare like so many other people here have, but the film certainly does stand up on it's own. No film sticks entirely to the books they are based on anyway.

The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with re-mastered Dolby 5.1 sound. There are no extras at all. Which is puzzling considering the film's praise.",1125964800,2,2632,4.48643006263048

5412198,2,B00AEFXL5W,"Holly Golightly is no doubt adorable. What frustrates me is that the director and producers think that 2 hours of Holly acting cute counts as a movie.

She then takes her equally money-obsessed neighbor shoplifting and true love somehow instantly sprouts from there. This movie is not for me, but you might like it if you believe in ""love at first sight"" and have a thing for Holly's classic charm and silly but cute antics.

Another thing, the one and only Asian person in the movie was portrayed as a buck-teethed, rude, socially-retarded, and all-around pathetic loser.

5412200,4,B00AEFXL5W,"If Helen of Troy possessed the face that launched a thousand ships, the young Audrey Hepburn must have been good for, say, nine hundred?

From the moment she steps out of the yellow New York cab in front of Tiffany's, Hepburn dazzles, supported by the sturdy performance of George Peppard, who is the sensible foil to her zany role as Holly Golightly.  Peppard's Paul also makes his entrance by alighting from a yellow cab, but that is the last time he and Holly have anything in common in this film.  'Good thing opposites attract.

I bought this DVD because I was born too late to know Hepburn in her glory days, and I wanted to understand her mystique.  Glory endures, and Breakfast at Tiffany's showcases not only Hepburn's flair for romantic comedy and witty one-liners, but also her darker side.  In spite of the fact that the genre assures you that things will turn out well, Holly Golightly's self-destructive side is authentically troubling as you make your way to the predictable dnouement.

Holly can't think of anything she's never done.  Still, her light touch and random quirks - she leaves her apartment's mailbox slight ajar, for it warehouses the perfume and the mirror she needs as she leaves to fulfill her duties as what today we would describe as a call girl - make her more than a workaday social climber.  'I do not accept drinks from disapproving gentlemen' is one of her tenuous claims to dignity as she strives to figure out who she really is, now that she's 'not Lula Mae any more'.

Peppard's performance falls short of great acting, but if Hepburn needed a solid backdrop for her star turn, she found it in Peppard.  Half-way through the film, one finds oneself liking both of these characters: the safe, stolid one who is indeed a man that's 'kept by a woman' and the crazy 'real phony' - that's a good thing, in light of the alternatives - who is Hepburn's Holly.

Hepburn has a lighter touch elsewhere, but Breakfast is worth anybody's viewing as a standard piece in an immortal actress' repertoire and a period piece of 1960s Americana.  I recommend it heartily.",1123286400,4,2095,4.691256830601093

But of course I had no idea what this movie was about and had alot of very different expectations. After seeing other Audrey Hepburn movies (like ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Funny Face"") I expected a character that was sweet and naive. I was very surprised...but after I saw it again I really enjoyed the film. Holly Golightly is a girl who dates men for money. While Paul Varjak is a writer who is currently down on his luck and somewhat is in the same line of business that Holly is. Audrey Hepburn broke out of her usual character role and was faboulous in this movie. Even though this movie wasn't exactly like the novel (from what I heard) this movie was definitely probably shocking for the 1960's. And even though it has its faults (Mickey Rooney's role) it is a movie every girl should see!",1122163200,,870,4.3765432098765435
5412202,5,B00AEFXL5W,"So says Hollygolightly (Audrey Hepburn) as she gets to know her new upstairs neighbor, writer Paul Varjak (George Peppard) just a little better.  While this is not my favorite Audrey Hepburn movie, it's my favorite romantic comedy of them all about a wacky callgirl, a cat named Cat (""poor slob without a name"") and a handsome young writer who must acquire his own independence as a kept man before helping the stylish, seemingly carefree young woman he's falling in love with.

I hate to give so much of this wonderful story away as it's got to be seen to be loved, and the movie does itself more justice than I ever could.  Truman Capote was always upset that Audrey Hepburn was cast as Holly Golightly than his first pick, Marilyn Monroe, but when you watch this movie, you will see just how much classier and appealing Hepburn was in the role than Monroe would have been, althought I can see elements of Monroe in the character.  There is definite chemistry between Hepburn and Peppard, and Henry Mancini's musical score is absolutely beautiful throughout.  Great fashion and shots of New York abound throughout, and the stars are flanked by an excellent supporting cast in Patricia Neal, Villalonga, John MacGiver, and Mickey Rooney as a slightly offensive and stereotypical but still funny Mr. Yunioshi (Times were different back then.).  A magical,  humorous, and often touching love story, if you haven't seen it yet, please do.  This movie came out in 1961, and it is still the idyllic romantic comedy to end them all.  Few have measured up since, but I welcome them to try.",1120435200,2,1583,4.790441176470588

The only thing this one has to offer is a theatrical trailer! The acting is great, and i wish there were more movies like this out there today...

5412204,5,B00AEFXL5W,"For me this is the film that captures Audrey Hepburn's legendary career. Some people may push for My Fair Lady (but her singing voice wasn't used in the movie so it's hard to argue its definitiveness, besides it's more associated with Julie Andrews) or Roman Holiday (her only Academy Award win), but I am whole-heartedly for Breakfast at Tiffany's because everything about the movie captures the magic that is Audrey Hepburn.

When I first saw the first scene of the movie which was Hepburn having breakfast at a still closed Tiffany's with the score of Moon River in the backgroud, it already had me. There's something about the melancholic atmosphere of the beginning credits that captured the loneliness of Holly Golightly. This is one of the most memorable opening credits ever, and no single word was even uttered.

Audrey Hepburn may not be regarded in the same breath as Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn in terms of acting, but only Audrey Hepburn can combine charm, effervescence, vulnerability, and heartbreaking tenderness into her roles particularly in this one, she is an acting goddess in her own right.

5412205,4,B00AEFXL5W,"Breakfast At Tiffany's is more memorable than other Audrey Hepurn films including My Fair Lady and Roman Holiday. Even though her character is not likeable to a lot of people in the film as well as the audiences, I do find her eccentricity fascinnating and grew sympathetic towards her by the end. Especially being a cat lover myself, to see her abandoning Cat and then ranning in the rain to find it again was such a touching scene.

Holly Golightly(Hepburn) is a former farm girl living in New York city, and she's a callgirl/golddigger in search of a millionaire husband. She has breakfast(junkfood) outside of Tiffany's and she thinks she would one day have the money to buy those jeweleries. Enter a struggling writer named Paul Varjark(George Peppard), her neighbor who is a ""rentboy"" sponsored by a wealthy woman named Patricia Neal. At first, Holly has no desire to get involved with Paul knowing that he has no money, but gradually she realized that they were two of a kind. He relentlessly pursured her, but she rejected him for the possibility of becoming a wealthy wife of a Brazilian millionaire. Will Holly end up with wealth or love?

Audrey Hupburn is very beautiful and glamorous, and her black boat-neck dress with pearl necklaces and updo hairstyle is a total classic look. George Peppard is very charming and wonderful in this film. The upstairs' Japanese neighbor with a vulgar attitude portrayed by a White actor is really annoying. Did they not have any Japanese actors to work in a Hollywood movie in the '60s? I loved the score, especially Moon River heard at the end of the movie, it's the perfect ballad that captured the romantic and sad mood. Of Course, Cat also stole some scenes in this movie. It's funny that Holly just called him Cat.",1116201600,3,1767,4.771241830065359

5412217,4,B00AEFXL5W,"Breakfast at Tiffany's is the story of a wandering eccentric called Holly Golightly whose actions slowly lead her to the man she loves.

Holly is a strange one. She calms herself from the ""mean reds,"" different than the blues, by breakfasting at Tiffany's, the jewelry store. She is frequently given $50 by rich men to go to the powder room and although they're terrible bores, Holly consistently surrounds herself with them. She makes her living by visiting an ex-mobster in Sing Sing and giving him the weather report. She grew up as Loula Mae on a farm with her brother Fred who she loves dearly. When she escaped, she came to New York to lead her eccentric life with her feline alter ego she simply calls ""cat"" so that they do not belong to each other.

The character of Holly is a composite of many personalities of the era including the tempestuous Marilyn Monroe.

Paul Varjak is a writer/gigolo who slowly falls in love with Holly. He is straight forward, quite the opposite of Holly who randomly enters his room in the night for a short visit and calls him Fred after her brother.

The cat is used as a symbol of Holly's true self. She often accepts and rejects the cat in the film during appropriate times during her life.

The song Moon River is used throughout the film highly effectively. Audrey Hepburn sings the song beautifully and illustrates a melancholy mood that hovers over the film.

The one fault of the movie is the slow pace. Because of Holly's flightiness, the story progresses with jolts and sputters. It truly follows her life and not necessarily one looming important event as many movies do.

Overall, it is an excellent film with an exceptional cast.",1115164800,5,1681,4.677966101694915

It is so well done that it is impossible to say unequivocally whether it is a comedy or drama--- it is really a plausible mixture of the two, and isn't that how life is?  The score is beautiful, echoing the ambiguous funny-sad mood of the story.  ""Moon River"" is an immortal classic and fits in perfectly here.

There will never be another Audrey Hepburn. A flawless performance here!

Is she or isn't she?  That is the question that everyone seems to keep asking.  Is the kid (Holly Golightly) a fake or a real fake?  She's a real fake.  Holly Golightly is a very stylish girl, alligator shoes, long fancy dresses, and shades.  It can be determined that she's a call girl based on the amount of money she receives to go in the restroom, and the amount of male companions she has.  Not to mention her own reference to playing the field.  Holly is a very irrational young woman.  As Paul Varjack rings the bell in hopes of using her telephone and instant friendship is forged.  Paul a writer and a kept man himself with piercing blue eyes glimpse what the inside of Holly Golightly is all about.

""We are friends aren't we?""  Holly asks Paul who she associates with the looks of her young brother who is in the Army that she misses dearly.  As the two partake in a friendship that opens the eyes of the other one it is apparent that love is in the air.  But can Holly Golightly in her urgency to find a rich husband overcome her case of the ""reds?""

5412221,5,B00AEFXL5W,"""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is flawless blend of a crowd-pleasing star-vehicle for the effortlessly charming Audrey Hepburn and a bittersweet, painfully beautiful look at love, life, and happiness.  Director Blake Edwards, the man behind ""The Pink Panther"" series, ""The Party"", ""Operation Petticoat"", ""Victor/Victoria"", etc., has crafted a truly timeless film based on the novella by Truman Capote.  Though numerous elements of Capote's story were altered, the film still has a strong core and message that urges audiences to examine their own lives, loves, and happiness.

Everything about this film is classic.  You have the timeless Hepburn and her defining performance as Holly Golightly, a sophisticated, sassy call-girl with a secret past who is ultimately one of the most vulnerable characters Hepburn ever played.  Then there's George Peppard, a vastly under-appreciated actor who manages to hold his own next to Hepburn while playing a struggling writer living off an older married woman.  Peppard's boyish good looks and surprising depth make him the ideal match for Hepburn's Golightly.

Then of course there's Henry Mancini's wistfully romantic score and the tremendously popular theme-song, ""Moon River"", a true gem of a song that capture's the film's essence perfectly.  In addition, you have Hepburn's fabulous, style-setting wardrobe courtesy of her lifelong friend Hubert de Givenchy.  In this one film alone, Hepburn and Givenchy practically invented the ""little black dress"", popularized ballet flats, and introduced capris as a stylish alternative to regular pants.

My favorite quote:

Holly Golightly: You know those days when you get the mean reds?

Paul Varjak: The mean reds, you mean like the blues?

Holly Golightly: No. The blues are because you're getting fat and maybe it's been raining too long, you're just sad that's all. The mean reds are horrible. Suddenly you're afraid and you don't know what you're afraid of. Do you ever get that feeling?

Paul Varjak: Sure.

Holly Golightly: Well, when I get it the only thing that does any good is to jump in a cab and go to Tiffany's. Calms me down right away.",1108339200,110,2133,5.287833827893175

Yes, Mickey Rooney's portrayal is a discrace but the fact that Holly is a hooker only adds to the charm in my eyes.  Actually, this film was very risque for 1961.  A ""kept"" man, and hooker who was born a hillbilly named Lulu, and narcotics subplot, and just about every plot turn copied in every love story since.

I don't disagree, and as a Japanese-American myself, I have to admit I find Rooney's Asian make-up a bit much. But it's hard to take his sideshow character too seriously, as his casting is consistent with the loopiness of this film. This 1961 film classic must have been considered quite daring in its day, but as with most such attempts, it feels dated in certain ways, as director Blake Edwards tries awfully hard to capture the upscale bohemian atmosphere of early sixties New York. The party scene, for example, plays on a bit too long, I suppose to show how decadent those creative types truly can be.

At the time, Audrey Hepburn was at a crossroads in her career having spent most of the fifties playing innocent, dewy-eyed ingenues, so the role of self-proclaimed hedonist Holly Golightly (aptly named but hardly a ""no-name slob"" as she puts it) must have had great appeal. After all, Truman Capote, the author from whose novella this movie is based, wanted to cast Marilyn Monroe. But it is hard to imagine how Edwards could have pulled this off without the inimitable Hepburn, a sheer delight as she dances quite flagrantly around the fact that her character is a high-priced call girl by exhibiting her trademark sense of style, fun and vulnerability. Holly's fear of commitment is the crux of this story, even though she is hopelessly drawn to failed writer Paul Varjak, ""Fred"" to Holly, played by George Peppard. A kindred spirit whose feelings for her are more than mutual, his character is not above taking a few dollars himself, as well as a Baroque monstrosity of an apartment, from a wealthy, married interior decorator played with conniving sophistication by the always wonderful Patricia Neal. I still think Peppard is the weak link here as he doesn't have the requisite light touch to keep up with Holly's shenanigans, although he does well in capturing the pained look of a novelist with semi-permanent writer's block.

The rest of the cast can be best described as eccentric, in particular, Buddy Ebsen (pre-Jed Clampett) as Holly's backwoods first husband, Martin Balsam as her fast-talking agent (for her apocryphally explained acting career) and of course Rooney, whose accent is actually surprisingly accurate if you can get past the make-up. Designer Givenchy is also at work here, and here you'll see the debut of the classic black cocktail dress that launched a million copies to this day. Henry Mancini's romantic music provides the perfect accompaniment, and Hepburn's plaintive, ukelele-strummed version of ""Moon River"" is still the most definitive. The film does end on the most romantic of notes with a rain-soaked kiss in the alley, just about as lovely a scene as you are likely to see in movies.

 Blake Edwards the film director raved about this movie and loved how it turned out, ""It is a story of love that should be and no matter what the obstacles are it will overcome all odds.""  This movie took place during the 1960's.  The two main characters are Paul and Holly.  Both of them have late night jobs and they live at the same apartment building so they would see each other late at night.  Paul and Holly should get married and be with each for the rest of their lives.  Paul will go through anything to get Holly to fall in love with him.  He will go through any obstacle that he has too.

 This movie isn't the best movie whatsoever it lacks a lot of fundamentals that would make a good love story.  The setting of the movie was extremely vague and could have been in a nicer setting.  I know that the setting fits their life styles but it was to bittersweet for me.  Many different parts strike me as amusing or good.  I would recommend this movie to anyone over the age of sixteen.  This film is not recommended for any of the young kids.  It would be hard for the kids to sense the tension that continues frequently between Paul and Holly.

 Even though Paul has a job he has a mistress who gives him money every month.  Since Paul and Holly have late night habits they see each other quite often and Paul started to become interested in Holly.  This is a critical point in the movie because the tensionIf he only knew about her inability to keep keys, save money, and remember little things.  As far as one Hollywood Executive's advice to Paul she is a bad investment.  After knowing these things Paul is still crazy about getting to know Holly better.

 Holly does keep one commitment though.  She goes to visit the Sing Sing (a concert hall where people act) weekly to act out a play as being a courier between a convicted drug dealer and his attorney.  Sing Sing is like a movie studio place where different actors and actresses go to perform different plays.  It's a chance for them to show how good they are at acting and to make a little extra money on the side.

 Paul tries his very hardest to not let his mistress find out about Holly.  Holly's deserted husband makes a presence in the film after Paul noticed the same man coming around the apartment.  Holly convinces her husband that she will go back home with him in Oklahoma, but they had to take the bus back if she was going to go.  She made Paul go along to supposedly say good bye to him.  The next thing Paul knows is Holly stabs her husband with a knife right to the heart.  The whole time Paul was just a shield against her now ex-husband.

 Holly has a brother named Fred.  He is about to re-enlist into the army because this guy Jed wants him too and Jed his Holly's former husband.  After the stabbing she plops Fred onto the bus where she kicks him and tells him that she loves him.  This was a very weird part in the movie.  Jed didn't even have the chance to say he hates her.  It may confuse the viewer, but it's just another step for Paul and Holly to get together.

As Paul sees how Holly encounters relationships and how she deals with them he is unsure about her now.  We are led to still think Paul has undying love for Holly.  He finally confronts his mistress and tells her about his relationship with Holly.  He also tells her that he is leaving on a trip with Holly.  The mistress offers him one-thousand dollars for the trip but he refuses quickly and decides he can do it on his own.  This again shows how much Paul loves Holly.

  Holly now decides that she is going to leave her old days behind and settle down with the ninth richest man in the world.  Yet in some kind of way Paul thinks he is winning her heart.  The only ring that Paul can afford is a crack jack's box ring which he would get engraved.  He feels like he is winning her heart and this sets the film into a race to see who Holly will end up with.

 After Holly's last gold digging chance didn't pan out as planned she got in trouble with police.  She decided she needed to get out of the country.  When they arrived back into their town they still lived in the building.  Paul wanted one chance with her so she brought his fifty dollar check to go into the ""powder"" room.  He realizes it just isn't worth it anymore so he leaves her to her Latin lover.

 Holly gets word that her brother was killed in a jeep accident.  She throws a fit in her apartment and destroys everything.  She was unable to deal with the situation, and Paul, being the nice supportive man that he is, goes to confront her and help her through her grief.  The next morning she got right up acting like nothing even happened.

 The last scene in the movie was the last chance for Paul to woo Holly.  They road in a taxi together and the whole time Paul was hoping Holly would realize what a good guy she was.  They were riding to the airport where she would meet up with her new fianc.  Holly threw her cat out the window and asked the driver to stop so she could kick Paul out at that time.  Paul immediately let's his heart pour out to her.  He tells her that, ""she will never be able to trust or commit to anyone.""  After Paul got out she started crying and ran out and got her cat and immediately started following him.  It seems apparent that Paul and Holly will live happily ever after.  Paul should have just stayed with his mistress; at least she could pay the bills.  Now finally Paul and Holly may live happily ever after in love.

  I really didn't like this movie, but if a person has a night to waste they should watch it.  Paul and Holly give hope to anyone in love because they ended up together and both of them got through their obstacles.",1098316800,2,5726,4.24907063197026

by: Philip Novak

Modern audiences might be more familiar with the hit song of ten years ago than the plot of this movie.  It's a love story, which does not become obvious until halfway through the movie.  The story moves slowly and the acting displays little emotion.  It may have been a good ""chick flick"" in its day, but easily loses to modern competition.

Audrey Hepburn plays Holly Golightly, who is a cute, little toy for rich old men.  Holly makes a living doing this; however, doesn't prey on them as a gold digger.  Instead she is amused by the men and her relationship with them.  Paul Varjack is the male portion of this attempt at a love tale played by George Peppard.  He can be seen on re-runs of Banacek or The A-Team.  Younger viewers may not know him at all and especially not the striking boyish creature of his early days.  Paul is an author that has a wealthy decorator; however, he is really a sex-toy who is given a fancy apartment with all expenses paid.

The description of Paul's true employment is so subtle it could almost be missed and the portrayal of Holly as a party girl is quite benign, as well.  Modern movies are blatant with the description of sexual subjects leaving no doubts in the viewers mind about what situations they are witnessing.  Older films lack that feature.  In today's Hollywood sex is the big seller and the hush-hush whisperings of yesteryear are preserved in movies like this.  It makes this movie mostly ""G rated,"" except for a few cocktails and cigarettes which, with current translation means nothing.  The whole family could watch Breakfast at Tiffany's, but it's probably not a good idea.  Kids would be asleep in a half hour or bouncing off the walls from boredom.

 The colorful backdrop of Breakfast at Tiffany's is set in a surreal New York where the opening scene has Ms. Golightly on a sidewalk void of human life, staring into the window of Tiffany's jewelry store.  It shows pretty, clean streets and storefronts, but most of the story takes place in Paul and Holly's apartment building.  They have an odd Japanese neighbor that's lives above them and complains about their noisy parties.  It's clear that the film was made in a less politically correct day (1961) in which the Japanese were cast as bucktooth people with a perpetual squint behind dark circular glasses.  His small role of being awakened by the parties is a poor attempt at a comic relief and could make the modern politically correct viewer uncomfortable.

The main characters meet one night when Holly escapes a drunken man in her apartment by going out the fire escape and into Paul's bedroom window.  They exchange pleasantries and after a drink and a smoke Holly hops into bed with Paul.  ""Only as friends,"" she says, and has to ask if they are friends.  To which Paul replies, ""Yes, we are friends.""  That's an obvious reply since she's already in bed with him.  It's a strange set up for a love story to have two promiscuous people find each other in a promiscuous manner.  There's nothing in it to indicate that Holly and Paul are meant to be together.  The story suffers from a lack of crescendo from this point to the end scene. In other love stories there's usually a tragic twist during the climax of the story that precludes them from being together; a force that is out of their control.  The closest example of that is the rich South American that Holly is going to marry.  Crisis strikes and Holly is left in tears.  Her fianc can't cope and splits.  This leaves Paul with the pieces.

This nears the end of the film and the approach to any decent acting.  They are in pursuit of Holly's fleeing rich guy when Paul spouts a few lines that are motivational yet still lacking serious emotion.  Holly cries, but for what reason is unclear.  Her weeping may have been concern about her lost cat rather than her desire for Paul.  When the closing kiss comes around, it doesn't feel like she really cares that she arrived in his arms.  She's happier to have found the cat.

 This is a love story that lacks love.  I'm a new age guy and will let a tear be released from the clutches of machismo, but this film did nothing in that department.  Holly is a cute character that anyone would love, but is never taken seriously.  This is reinforced by Paul's indifference toward the woman and a lack of chemistry between the actors.  It was fun to see the dress, phrases, and customs of an older time which gives a nice break from today's movies.  This is a good movie to see once for the vintage effect but as for the story, maybe Capote's novel tells it better.",1098316800,3,4626,4.568126520681266

 Breakfast at Tiffany's is considered by many to be one of the best films of its class.  It is a timeless, romantic comedy starring Audrey Hepburn (as Holly Golightly) and George Peppard (as Paul Varjak).  The two meet at the beginning of the film and as the movie progresses, begin to understand and grow closer to each other.  The love story theme of Breakfast at Tiffany's is one that is used in other movies of this nature.  There are, however, a few unique traits that set this movie apart from others of its class;  Breakfast at Tiffany's takes the standard love story seen in many of these types of films  and elevates it to a higher level.

 The movie begins in the early morning with Holly Golightly window shopping at Tiffany's Jewelry Store.  Holly dreams of being able to afford jewelry from Tiffany's, but knows that she must marry someone wealthy in order to realize her dream.  Holly explains later in the movie to her friend, Paul, that being at Tiffany's is calming to her.  When she returns to her apartment, the audience is introduced to Holly's personality.  In order to enter her apartment complex, Holly must wake up a tenant in the building.  Holly has lost her key, and as the audience learns, this is not the first time and, she admits, that it will not be the last time.  As the film progresses, there are more and more clues of Holly's forgetful and unorganized life style as well as her total disregard for anyone's feelings but her own.

 When Paul and Holly meet for the first time, we are shown even more of Holly's different behavior.  Paul, a new tenant in her building, asked if he could use her telephone.  Upon entering her apartment, he noticed that it looked as if she had just moved in.  She hadn't, she had been there for nearly a year.  She wasn't exactly sure where her telephone was, and then she remembered that she put it in a suitcase.  According to Holly, the suitcase kept the noise of the phone down.  Along with the phone, there is a cat in Holly's apartment.  She explains to Paul that the cat and she found each other.  They do not belong to each other, and therefore, she did not name the cat.  These incidents begin to introduce the audience to Holly's personality.

  During this first conversation between Paul and Holly, Paul mentioned that it was Thursday morning.  Holly was admittedly surprised, she told Paul that she must get ready for an appointment that she has every Thursday.  She was in a frenzy, attempting to get ready in a short time in order to make her appointment.  This is the one and only commitment that Holly actually regularly keeps.  As she franticly tries to get ready, she asks Paul to find her shoes under the bed.  He found one, she found the other in a basket along with other things in it.

Holly's appointment is a visit with a convicted drug smuggler in the Sing Sing prison.  Later, it is revealed to the audience that during her visits at the prison, the inmate gives Holly a ""weather report.""  She then gives this bit of information to the drug smuggler's ""attorney"" and is paid for the information from the ""attorney.""  There are many clues that show that the information given to Holly is not a ""weather report,"" although Holly's inability to recognize the obvious, further portrays her personality.  Holly thinks that the drug smuggler and his attorney are two very nice men and she is performing a kind act by visiting the drug smuggler.

Holly's would like to meet and marry someone who has a lot of money.  She has been trying to save money, but is unable to do this on her own.  A positive attribute of Holly's is that she wants to support her younger brother who is currently in the army and will be out soon.  She knows that, because he is slow, he will not be able to support himself.  She realizes that she will not be able to become rich on her own and, in order to support her brother, along with her dream life style, needs to marry into money.

 Paul, on the other hand, is portrayed as a very intelligent and logical thinker.  His kind acts toward Holly show that he is truly interested in beginning a meaningful relationship with her.  He is an aspiring writer and has published a book.  Through the course of the movie, Paul is shown to better his life in many ways.  He breaks free from his mistress who has been financially supporting him and finds a job as a writer.  On many occasions, Paul, who from the beginning of the film has been falling in love with Holly, has ample opportunity to see Holly's true self.  Many people attempted to point out to Paul that Holly can not, and never will be able to, have a normal relationship.  Paul meets Holly's ex-husband who indirectly explains to Paul that Holly is not someone that he should get involved with.  In addition to the warning from the ex-husband, a man named O. J. Berman tells Paul exactly that ""Holly is a bad investment.""

 Avoiding the advice of these people, Paul continues to pursue Holly's affection.  There is something about her that he finds irresistible.  The film does not show exactly what it is, but it is apparent that there is some reason for Paul's persistence.  The way Paul acts when he is with Holly makes it seem as though the two of them are meant to be together.  And Paul will stop at nothing to make Holly realize this.

At the end of the movie, Holly announced to Paul that she was moving to Brazil to be with her wealthy boyfriend and eventually marry him.  Paul was devastated, but still spent the evening with Holly because she wanted him to be with her.  During the evening, Holly was arrested and spent time in jail due to her involvement with the drug dealer and his attorney.  Paul did all that he could to get Holly out of jail.  When she was freed on bond, Holly told him that she was flying to Brazil.  Paul told her that she could not legally leave the country.  She did not care, she was going.  Paul was in the taxi with her, trying to convince her to stay in the country not only because of the upcoming trial, but due to the fact that she had received a telegram from her boyfriend that their relationship was over.  Paul was also trying to convince Holly that they loved each other and that they should be together.  It was not until Holly, in another of her appalling behavioral acts, kicked the cat out of the taxi, that Paul began thinking with his brain, not his heart.  Paul yelled at Holly saying that she was doomed to be what she is, she will never be able to trust anyone and that her fantasies of Tiffany's and Brazil will not change any of it.  Paul exited the cab and threw a ring that he had had engraved at Tiffany's for her.  Holly realized that she had been deceiving herself regarding her feelings for Paul.

Even though Paul was not wealthy, she loved him and he loved her.  He was the one for her, and up to this point, she thought that love had to have money attached to it.  As we see by Holly leaving the cab to look for Paul and the cat that she had earlier said did not belong to her, her outlook on love has changed.  So, the story line completely turns around.  Not that any person paying the slightest attention to the film could not see it coming.  But in the end, the love story came together showing that the apparent vibe people received from Holly had no effect on how Paul felt about her and they both realized that they were meant to be together.  Having this sudden reverse of not only the female character, but also Paul giving up on Holly, makes Breakfast at Tiffany's a more notable movie.

5412242,3,B00AEFXL5W,"Breakfast At Tiffany's is a great lighthearted movie that any one could enjoy. It's full of romance, humor, and plot twists; all which are essential for any good movie. It begins with Holly Golightly, a beautiful young woman, getting out of a car and walking over to Tiffany's.  There she stares at all the beautiful diamonds  while she drinks her coffee. She feels that the store is safe, that ""nothing bad could ever happen here."" Holly lives in an apartment with a very strict landlord, but doesn't usually abide by his rules. When she gets back to her place, we meet Fred, who's real name is actually Paul. He is a very well kept man who is moving in upstairs. Holly and Fred become good friends, but nothing more, because Fred has a mistress over quite frequently.

  I enjoyed the movie, even though it was extremely predictable. Everyone knows that Ms. Golightly and Fred were going to fall in love, and that everything would be okay in the end. Despite this fact, it was entertaining and sentimental. It is very lively, and full of romance as well. There's something for everyone in this movie. Women love Fred's good looks, the beauty Audrey Hepburn radiates, and the love story between Holly and Fred. Men too love Audrey's beauty, and also the party scenes. There always seems to be some party where rich people are drunk. Kids too will love this movie because there are a lot of comedic scenes with Holly's landlord. He always knocks into something, or is always shouting ridiculous things down the balcony.

 I felt that the director really made his audience feel connected to the characters. He made them seem like we were there with them, and that we were their best friends as well. It was a very feel good movie that left the audience wanting to know more. I would give this movie a high rating, because it was an all around entertaining movie that anyone could enjoy!",1098316800,,1885,4.642642642642643
5412243,5,B00AEFXL5W,"I loved this film. Although the story was... well, thin, the charm and grace of Audrey made this a superb classic. If you like romances, and/or Hepburn films, you will definitely love it too!

Mickey Rooney... added for comic relief, but is hideously unfair to the portrayal of the Japanese. It shocked me that such an otherwise well thought out film could have such a flaw, its bewildering. Some may find him funny, but others, like myself, just find it borderline racist. He throws a pejorative light on Japanese men, but was it SO hard to get an actual Japanese actor?! I don't think there would be so much uproar had the landlord been cast as a disgruntled Russian, or other nationality, but still...

So, overall, a damn good film, but try not to pay much attention to Rooney.",1093824000,6,781,4.611510791366906
5412244,4,B00AEFXL5W,"Breakfast At Tiffany's is the story of how Hannibal Smith from the A-Team won the heart of a crazy woman. But not just any crazy woman--the single most messed-up, finicky, hopelessly unsatisfied ball of estrogen in the world. Take note that most of my points here go to the excellent George Peppard, who's as smooth as ever, even without his cigar, leather gloves, and machine gun full of magic bullets. All the other actors (with the exception of Mickey Rooney, racist jerk) were fine, but I always have a hard time watching older movies 'cause it seems like people talk in code. For example: when Audrey Hepburn says, ""Oh, I just saw a yellow-feathered pidgeon eating the berries from a juniper tree, it was delightful,"" it ends up meaning, ""Make love to me while I drink excessive amounts of scotch,"" and I'm none the wiser.

 This movie also features the best party ever thrown, the kind of wacky, kooky, smoke-filled party that makes you a swinging cat just for standing around in the middle of it. We should all aspire to throw such a mah-velous bash at some point in our lives. Really a great movie if you love it when a plan comes together.",1091750400,9,1148,4.595121951219512
5412255,1,B00AEFXL5W,"I never write review here but I had to point something out. I am a fan of Audrey Hepburn but there are many reasons why I think that ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" was a poor movie. Some of which is that a bad story line is made beautiful by use of the perfect music, perfect lighting, perfect camera filters, perfect actors, etc. Hollywood has perfected the art of emotion manipulation and this movie would be the pinnacle of the art.

 But the main reason that pushed me to write an review was that Mickey Rooney portrays an Asian landlord as buck-toothed, near-sighted minstrel. Do we still laugh at African Americans depicted in blackface minstrel in anyother classics? But yet most current audience / reviewers still think Mr. Rooney's depiction of Asian character was hilarious (please read other's reviews). How is this possible?

 I don't blame Audrey Hepburn, Mickey Rooney or even the director as racists. They would have to have been an very advanced social thinker to notice the offensiveness of their portrayal in their time. But I do blame the current audience for not finding it offensive now. Ask yourself if you are an intelligent thinking person but still find Mickey Rooney's character funny and why.

 I am force to post this review in the future to point this issue out. This isn't to hit you over the head with my point. But old reviews get buried over with newer reviews and this is an issue that should not be buried.

5412256,2,B00AEFXL5W,"Although I'm a big fan of Audrey Hepburn this movie wasn't very good. I had heard about it for the longest time and finally watched it with my mom. She left halfway through the movie, and I stayed (being a devout believer in finishing movies no matter how bad). Mickey Rooney's part, I must say, was excellent and so very funny. He had me laughing so hard. Audrey plays the misplaced Holly Golightly, not belonging anywhere it seems. However, unlike other movies, she had no real purpose in this movie, except to keep the action going. Her mood swings are what threw me off. Nevertheless, her wardrobe is simply ravishing. I like how she befriends her upstairs neighbor, whom she endearingly calls Fred after her brother. The movie gives her a ""bad girl"" image, which really isn't the Audrey Hepburn I know. One minute she likes you, adores you, even seems to love you, and the next she hates you for wanting to get close to her. The movie has no real depth, although it brushes issues such as prostitution, drugs, and other illegal activities. And the movie title really has nothing to do with the movie. A brief scene at the beginning with her eating in front of the store really doesn't cut it, despite her obsession with Tiffany's and her later entrance into the building. I will say that Audrey does has style, but no class in this movie portrayal. And what's style without class? The concept of the story was annoying, odd, and downright confusing. You never know what to expect from her character, and from Peppard's for that matter. The DVD features are okay ie. languages, special features, etc. This movie is not one I'd recommend, but it's definitely a unique plot.",1091318400,6,1676,4.66554054054054

My dad made me watch it this past weekend and I fell in love with it! Unlike most romantic comedies made today, both main characters are broke. It doesn't follow the mold of:  poor/average girl falls for rich guy blah blah blah or the other way around. It was funny (Mickey Rooney's character was HILARIOUS!) and sad (when Holly finds out about Fred) and sappy (the last 20 minutes) all at the same time.

The character Audrey portrays is a hooker, yet she acts like a virgin princess, and we are supposed to -- what? -- love her? sympathize with her?  Ditto Peppard.  In a way it's an earlier version of Pretty Woman -- romanticize a prostitute to the point where she is not remotely a believable prostitute, thus making prostitution kind of sort of OK and not the demeaning thing it is.  In both films, the women are seemingly motivated, not by a need to put food on the table, but by a desire for Real Money.  How is this charming?",1088380800,8,605,4.366071428571429

 This is a truly gorgeous romantic film, a real classic. A film really you can watch many many times without getting bored. Since 1961, I'm sure lots of people agree and have been watching this film again and again and again during this 40 years. Oscar winning music, beautiful theme song 'Moon River' meets with gorgeous romantic story.

 ""Moon river wider than a mile
 I'm crossing you in style someday
 You dream maker, you heartbreaker
 Wherever you're going I'm going your way
 Two drifters off to see the world
 There's such a lot of world to see
 We're after the same rainbows end
 Waiting round the band
 My huckleberry friend, moon river
 And me...""

5412263,4,B00AEFXL5W,"""Seinfield"" has ruined me. So many little things pop up in life that remind me of certain episodes and this movie is one of them. Goofball George joins a book club to read Capote's Breakfast at Tiffany's which is a slim volume easily read within a snap, but George, naturally, must cheat and watch the video instead. The movie is quite different from the book, as George discovers to his dismay. I adore both but as entities separate from one another.
The movie is a frothy little concoction of romance, kooky characters, and a sparkly clean New York City. A veil of misty eyed yearning and gentle sweetness belie the sordid underbelly of prostitution, organized crime, and other illegal activities but the movie does not dig that deep. It is a fashionable fairytale, after all, and to enjoy the film that is the best way to approach it.
Miss Holly Golightly is a charming flit-about who accepts $50 from her gentlemen ""friends"" for the powder room then ditches them. Her new neighbor, whom she calls Fred because he reminds her of her beloved brother, is a jaded dried-up writer kept by an older wealthy woman. Holly also earns money by delivering ""weather reports"" for a jailed mobster. She is amazingly oblivious to what is really going on but she looks so marvelously fab in sleek black dresses and UFO sized hats that one simply cannot hold it against her.
A tender poignancy is what saves this movie. I reached for the tissues over the character's frustrations and desperate longings to escape from lives in which they felt trapped. I also found the confusion of Holly's sweet and simple old hubby tapping on my little ole' heart when he shows up in New York to take his young bride back home where he feels she belongs.
I enjoy this movie for what it is and not what it could've been. Still, I gladly could do without the Mickey Rooney character - a slimy and oh so unfunny fake-Japanese photographer - but he is a minor character (why did they bother with him at all?) and thankfully is not seen much.
See the movie, read the book, but don't become flabbergasted like George Constanza to discover that one is a moon river serenade while the other is a smoky torch song.",1085011200,6,2177,4.598971722365039
5412264,5,B00AEFXL5W,"I have always loved Audrey Hepburn ever since I first learned about her when I was about 9 or 10 years old. I have seen all of her movies,and this by far is her greatest one. As a matter of fact,I think this movie is the greatest of all time! Ok,ok,a little exaggerated,but it is my personal favorite of all time. Audrey Hepburn is simply amazing in this movie as ditzy but loveable hooker(yes,hooker) Holly Golightly,whom is one of the greatest movie characters in movie history,in my book. Audrey conatins so much charm in this movie and really is the best known Audrey Hepburn. movie. And George Burns has amazing charisma and chemistry with Audrey as aspiring writer Paul Zarjak,who Holly nicknames as her borther Fred since she thinks they have a resemblance. And the supporting cast is great,too,especially Mickey Rooney's hilarious part as Mr?,Holly's Asian naighbor,which some people might find offensive,but is still very funny. In fact,the whole movie is hilarious,one example being the side-splitting scene where Holly drinks herself under the table(no,not literally!).But,this isn't all laughs,some of this movie is so heartbreaking and tearjerking that you can't help but take out the Kleenex box,especially when Holly gets the message after going out with the Brazilian millionaire that her brother,Fred...(when you see the movie,you'll know what I'm talking about.)But,above all of this,the movie is so romantic that you'll wanna get married faster than you can say ""Holly Golightly""!Sure,Holly&Paul's relationship gets a few speed bumps along the way(Audrey dating a Brazilian millionaire),but over all of it,they triumph,making this movie one of the greatest,if not,the greatest romantic comedy of all time,and then some. And,the fact that Audrey's character,Holly,plays hard-to-get for such a long time makes this a serious comedy,and not just a big piece of fun. Although I could never figure out why Holly would want to date anyone that looks like her btother,but then I realize that true love is true love and nothing can break it,and it's all thanks to this masterpiece. Oh,and the little black dress,simply amazing(sorry,I just had to add that!)!

This is one of my all time favorite books, and one of the great American masterworks of the 20th century.  Capote saw Holly as a young Marilyn Monroe type - sexy, manipulative, ignorant, bold and brash, but deeply vulnerable.  The script is one of the worst ""adaptations"" ever.  The only actor in this film who seems to bare any relation to a character from the book is Buddy Ebson as Doc.  He seems to have stepped out of a diffrent film.  A better film. I want to see THAT film!  Patricia Neal's character isn't in the book.  She's not bad (she was better as the negro maid in ""Hud"" - oops, I guess they changed that role from black to white for the film).  Mickey Rooney is an abomination as Holly's Japanese neighbor - I cringe just thinking about it.  Instead of Capote as narrator we have the VERY heterosexual George Pappard....if I go on I'm going to start drinking again.  PLEASE somebody make a good film of this beautiful story.  It's April of 2004 - Scarlett Johannson would make an ideal Holly (she's the perfect age - 19). Billy Bob Thornton would make a heartbreaking Doc.  Come on Hollywood, I dare ya!

5412267,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Many viewers and critics have said that this film doesn't have much of a plot, mainly because there isn't a lot of ""action."" However, most of the action occurs in the characters' souls, and that is where the plot of the story lies.
Audrey Hepburn, my favorite film actress, stars as Holly, a call girl searching for the ultimate sugar daddy. George Peppard is Paul, the kept man upstairs who becomes Audrey's brother-figure. When Paul begins to fall in love with Holly, he begins to see her superficiality. Is she really who she says she is? Or has she just tricked herself into believing it? Paul attempts to uncover the layers of Holly's soul, and in the process he discovers some secrets in her past. Simultaneously, Paul realizes the sickening situation in his own life, and ends the liasion with wealthy matron Patricia Neal, turning his energy to writing a book about Holly.
The main point of the film is this: genuine love is tangible, but many people desire the wrong kind, the easy kind, the physical kind, and forget about the love of the soul and heart. Paul is patient with Holly's flighty ways, something that many viewers should take notes on and apply to their own relationships. Paul gives love, not necessarily expecting it in return ... and I won't spoil the end (although it's in direct contrast to Capote's novel). Overall, this is a sweet, tender film about love, and the talented actors envelop us into their plight. Great classic romance, but not sappy.",1081382400,10,1476,4.747081712062257

There is something so unique about Holly Golightly thats not found in any other book/movie. The movie starts with Audrey Hepburn stepping out of a taxi early in the morning with pearls, dark glasses and a fancy black dress holding a bag of pastries and staring at the window of Tiffany's. That image is stunning, plain, naive and thoughtful all at the same time. And the movie is the same.
The only gripe I have about this movie is the ending. The book ends it so appropriately because shes a wild thing who can't be tamed and she ends up doing what shes...supposed to do (?). but here, the ending contradicts the MAIN theme of the movie by making it too happy go lucky...(don't want to spoil it) This movie is too ideal, too plastic and that detracts from its originality. Holly Golightly is NOT a socialite. Shes a call girl. Her apartment is not that luxurious. She shares it with Mad Madge. Rusty Trawler was not her suitor because Mad Madge stole him from her and he turned out to be gay.
  Also, most importantly, the book is written in terms of the narrator looking back. Paul received a postcard from Holly and thinks about her. Its a story of nostalgia and freedom and the movie fails to establish that.
  Still, a very good movie in itself.

This lovely and giddy romance adapted from Truman Capote's novella casts Hepburn as the urban sophisticate Holly Golightly, a lovely and wacko neurotic living her many gentleman friends. George Peppard, a writer who is supported (ahem) by a controlling older woman, is Golightly's upstairs neighbor. When their friendship turns to love, their tiptoe relationships with the moneyed people who support them is thrown off balance. Did you know Henry Mancini's haunting Moon River came from this movie? Perhaps I did, once upon a time, but I'd forgotten. At any rate, actors, score, screenplay, and especially Audrey Hepburn's charms combine to make Breakfast at Tiffany's a great movie romance and an insider's peek into the world Capote knew as few of his viewers do: the world of chic, high society bohemia.",1072569600,10,874,5.294964028776978

Hepburn's performance as the flighty and sometimes eccentric Manhattanite is delightful and engaging, which is why this film is one you can watch again and again all these years later.  The girls from Sex and the City could definitely get some pointers from the stylish and savvy Holly.
Seeing this film on DVD does not detract from the beauty of the New York scenery or the intricate expressions of Hepburn and George Peppard, who plays Holly's writer/kept man neighbor.  If anything, watching the two onscreen is a magical experience.  Hepburn's performance is larger than life.
Watching images of New York in the early 1960s always fascinates me and reminds me that times weren't as simple as we like to think they were.

5412271,4,B00AEFXL5W,"Based on Truman Capote's novel, this is the story of a young woman on her own making her way in the big city.  The movie starts by introducing us to Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) as she window shops her way through Manhattan. Paul (George Peppard), an author with a bad case of writer's block, is the new tenant in her building. The two meet on the morning Paul moves in, when he drops by to use Holly's phone. Soon after, they become friends.  One night, when a drunk man is banging on Holly's door, she climbs the fire escape and slips into Paul's apartment. As thanks for ""rescuing"" her, she invites him to a party, which turns into a loud, rowdy affair.  He again comes to her aid when a figure from her past shows up in New York.  And for one memorable day, they go out on the town together doing things that they have never before done, like shopping at Tiffany's and checking out a book from a library.  Ultimately, their feelings end up running more deeply than normal friendship but, when Paul confesses his love, Holly rebuffs him.  She has set her heart on marrying a rich South American so that she will have enough money to support herself and her brother, whose tour of duty in the army is nearly over.
While this is a great film, the inclusion of the stereotyped Asian character of Mr. Yunioshi (Mickey Rooney) is racist and offensive.  Mr. Yunioshi's sole purpose is to provide cheap comic relief.  What might have been funny in 1961 has long since lost its humorous edge.  Yunioshi's role is a double blow to the Asian community - not only is he dense and scornful, but he is played by a caucasian actor in heavy makeup.

5412272,4,B00AEFXL5W,"This is an Audrey movie, her charisma alone carries the movie-well with her style. She represents the ultimate urban chic that is being  told in almost all fashion books-the huge sun glasses, the trench, black little dress with pearls. Surely, the movie is more than that, a lonely lost woman who feels she does not belong to anywhere and anyone,but still partying and charming men fulltime-very elegantly. That is really outstanding-Holly's pursuing men seems so effortless and carefree, but still persistent. The opening scene is so striking-Audrey having breakfast at Tiffanny's with her party clothes looking at the windows displaying jewellery. However, I found the movie a bit slow paced. I also could not help but think that ""Sex and the City""and the character Carrie (mostly the book)adopted a lot from this movie.

5412273,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Audrey Hepburn was at her best when she played Holly Golightly, the darling young woman that lived a somewhat strange life in New York city. 'Breakfast At Tiffany's' is a light-hearted film in which writer Paul Varjak (George Peppard) moves into a New York apartment and becomes friends with Holly Golightly, a woman of such character that he has never seen in any woman before. Paul first meets Holly when he knocks on her door to ask to use the telephone, in which she says yes and points him towards a suitcase on the floor. He asks why she keeps it in there and he gets the answer 'It muffles the sound'! Throughout the film Paul finds out that Holly does some very peculiar things on a regular basis such as visit a man called Sally Tomato in Sing Sing Prison, throw wild parties which are more than often broken up by the police, get $50 every time she goes to the powder room on a date, and much more!
One of the best bits in the film is when Holly and Paul spend the whole day doing things they have never done before. As you can imagine it is hard for Holly to find things that she has never done, but they finally think of things like taking a walk first thing in the morning, going to the public library, and shoplifting from a toy store!
'Breakfast At Tiffany's' is an enjoyable film for all the family and will never be out of fashion, thanks to Audrey Hepburn's eternal wit and style, George Peppard's brilliant acting and character, and the fact that there is always some one in the world just like Holly Golightly! This film is and always will be, a classic.",1059350400,,1574,4.357142857142857
5412274,3,B00AEFXL5W,"Breakfast at Tiffany's is a classic although I'm not entirely sure why.  It has Audrey Hepburn in it which helps make it a classic, but the storyline isn't exactly 'out of this world'.  Having said that, I found it very easy to sit through the movie, and just enjoy it as a fun piece of film-making.  Add George Peppard as the suave neighbour who slowly, but surely falls in love with Audrey Hepburn.  The New York setting adds magic to the film, and helps soften the constant ""Moon River"" theme which seemingly plays throughout the movie (in different variations).
DVD SUMMARY:
This is the bad news. This movie has not been given the treatment afforded to other old classics, and as a result the transfer to DVD is VERY BAD.  There is grain all the way through it, which shouldn't surprise me because Paramount aren't known for cleaning up their old films before transferring to DVD.
Extras include the trailer.  A doco on Audrey Hepburn would have been nice, but once again, Paramount aren't well known for their extras.  So guys, if you really want this movie, maybe wait for the 40th Anniversary DVD edition (its sure to come out, and may be pristine, as it deserves to be).",1057968000,7,1178,4.607655502392345
5412285,5,B00AEFXL5W,"It's hard to summarize this movie.  Audrey Hepburn plays Holly, a character running as fast as she can from her humble roots.  She is totally enchanting and I can't imagine any one else being able to pull this off...  With other actresses I can see the portryal of Holly coming off harsh and trashy.  I understand that originally Marilyn Monroe was to play Holly.  I cant see this being the same movie if she had.
Miss Hepburn plays it with such innocent wit and vulnerability it is totally on the mark.  Initially, her life looks like a constant party...  No feelings go beyond the surface.  All people are just props...  But as the film progresses you see the the feelings beyond the surface.  They seem to emerge after she meets the george peppard character...  someone with dark issues of his own. A *kept* writer with a married woman paying the bills.
The relationship between peppard and hepburn reminds me a bit of two siblings clutching eachother for safety while an unsafe world spins around them.  For me, george peppard was a bit flat.  I am not sure if it is the character or the portrayal...or just comparing him to Ms hepburns preformance.
Buddy Ebsen's part in the film always confused me.  I suppose he is there to show where holly came from, why she is running, etc.  But I never found that part of the movie to fit in for me.  It seemed to come out of left field.
If you haven't ever seen this, you need to see it at least once.  If only for the *style* of the movie and the great characters in it...

5412289,3,B00AEFXL5W,"""Breakfast At Tiffanys"" is the vintage romance classic based on the novel by Truman Capote that pits the elegant Audrey Hepburn (Holly Golightly) against stoic George Peppard (Paul Varjack).  He's a would be writer, being kept by a rich, married lady.  She's the lost soul runaway who's abandoned her husband and family after her beloved brother dies while serving his country in the military.  This is vintage Capote.  Even with the glaring omissions to the text and Mickey Rooney's garish, over-the-top performance as a Japanese landlord, this is still one of the all time great date flicks.
Unfortunately, Paramount Home Video hasn't done a very vintage job on this DVD.  They've presented the film in its original VistaVision widescreen process (anamorphically enhanced) and remixed the sound to 5.1.  That's a start.  But the visual characteristic of the transfer on this DVD is digitally harsh, suffering from edge enhancement, aliasing, shimmering fine details, pixelization and digital grain.
Colors are generally well balanced but there are several instances where flesh tones appear a little bit on the yellowish side.  Contrast levels are weak with black levels usually registering a dark gray instead of black. There's an excessive amount of chips and scratches in the opening title sequence as well as some general color fading associated with film stock of this period. As for the 5.1 surround, it's strident and not very natural.  Dialogue is forward sounding.  The Henry Mancini score is nicely presented, particularly Moon River, but over all this is a mono soundtrack with very few scenes that engage any of your other speakers.
NO EXTRAS!  What a shame!
BOTTOM LINE: This is vintage Hollywood presented at bargain basement quality.  Decide for yourself. I'd wait in the hopes of a complete digital restoration.",1051488000,28,1829,5.226027397260274

5412292,5,B00AEFXL5W,"I love this film despite two major flaws. 1.) they toned down the fact that Holly Golightly is a call girl (probably to maintain Audrey Hepburn's sweet image) and 2.) the awful inclusion of Mickey Rooney as an Asian. Both blunders make me mad. However, they didn't hide the fact that George Peppard's character was a kept man by the icy Patricia Neal. Nonetheless, the film succeeds as one of the most romantic stories ever filmed. Hepburn is utterly charming and her performance would have had a more interesting shade had Holly's true means of support not been practically erased. But when we learn she's run away from a very sad family situation---we see a glimpse of the true Holly. It's also an interesting note that two people living off of others for different reasons should find each other and fall ROMANTICALLY in love. The theme ""Moon River"" pulls every drop of poignancy from the tear ducts as does the scene with the kitten in the rain. I'm as jaded as they come and that scene gets me every time. I always choke up. This is a great film but could have been greater if the more adult aspects of the story had just been played out. Still I recommend this for lovers of shamelessly romantic movies.

Though there will always be debates about which film was Hepburn's best, BREAKFAST AT TIFFANY'S is always mentioned and is probably the film that best captured both Hepburn's talent as an actor and her real life personality. The film also stars George Peppard and growing up in the 1980's it is nice to see what the A-Team's Hannibal looked like as a young man.

5412305,4,B00AEFXL5W,"Yes, Alan Reed, the voice behind Fred Flinstone plays the convict that Holly sees on a regular basis. This is the only movie I know of where Mr. Reed has a part, though probably there are others. I finally got to watch this movie a few months ago when my wife rented it from the library. Had always wondered what the big deal was about, especially since I grew up in NYC during the 1960's and never really saw an Audrey Hepburn flick before. Also have always like composer Henry Mancini's ""Moon River"". This movie was also mentioned on Seinfeld, the episode where George tried to cheat on his book club by watching the video instead at some strange family's house. The NYC locations, dress, look and feel of that era bought back memories of my own childhood. Being of Asian descent, I am deeply offended by the Mickey Rooney character, Holly's Japanese landlord , a negative totally not PC stereotype with his beady eyes, coke bottle glasses, bucked teeth and phony Asian accent who adds nothing to the story and film. If not for this demeaning, senseless, and insulting character I would have given this movie 5 stars and given it as a gift to my older sister. Hepburn does justice to all the acclaims and George Peppard looks really great in his pre ""The A Team"" days. Other than that I would also have to say that the wild party is the best part of the movie.

The book, the movie, the book, the movie  . . . I cannot decide which I prefer, it varies with my mood. But the movie, well, Audrey is delicious as Holly Golightly, an independent party girl, running, well, more like taking graceful steps in a fab Givenchy gown, away from herself and her past and into the arms of middle-aged business men to all the chic places in New York.
Then Paul baby, or Fred baby,(played by a way, way pre A-team George Pepard, who is as handsome a fellow as you may see on the screen) depending on who you are, moves into her building, himself a kept man by a cooing, oozy, middle-aged, bridge-playing Patricia Neal, who fancies herself as an interior decorator, although it is merely a hobby, and boy does she stink! You just hope that Paul/Fred doesn't wake up there with a bad hang-over!
There's a great party scence at Holly's apartment, where she meets Rusty Trawler (what a great name!) and Jose something too long to remember. You also get to see a hideous but weirdly comical performance by Mickey Rooney as a horribly stereo-typed Asian guy,Japanese, I think, complete with thick round glasses and buck teeth, I cringe every time he appears, which luckily is not often. There is also a small role for Buddy Ebsen, I think his performance as Doc Golightly won him the later role of Jed Clampett in the Beverly Hillbillies.
Anyway, Paul/Fred and Holly meet, become friends, bonded by their mutual states of being ""kept"" by others, hang-out in great New York, and then, after Holly sets her sights on Jose and starts to learn how to cook and Paul/Fred starts seriously renewing his attempts to write another book, they go there own ways. In the end, well, I don't want to give it away, but it's a sweet ending, one that made me cry a few tears.

5412308,4,B00AEFXL5W,"The celebrated author on whose novel it was based despised the film version, describing it as ""mawkish.""  The star wasn't much more enthusiastic; she never considered it among her best work.  And the reviews were mixed.  But regardless of what Truman Capote, Audrey Hepburn, or the critics thought about it, the public adored it--and the image of Audrey Hepburn wearing a black evening dress, nibbling pastry, and window shopping has passed into our cultural iconography.
The film is indeed lightweight stuff.  Audrey Hepburn is a New York good-time girl who makes a living by clipping her wealthy escorts for fifty here and fifty there.  When she meets handsome George Peppard--a writer who makes ends meet by trading favors with society matron Patricia Neal--can love be far behind?  But Audrey's mysterious past and her determination to marry rich, George's status as a kept boy-toy, and their occasionally questionable associates provide plenty of complications to fill out the story.
What makes the film work is the remarkable charm of its two stars.  Most of the attention goes to Audrey Hepburn and the film shows her to remarkable advantage: she is a remarkable actress, personality, and beauty, and she works wonders with the ultralight script.  But when it comes to charm, George Peppard is no slouch either: the film catches him at the height of his early golden-boy good looks, and he is the perfect foil for Hepburn in both their comic and dramatic scenes.  Mickey Rooney's excessive performance as Yunioshi aside, the supporting cast is also very entertaining, with Patricia Neal, Buddy Ebsen, Martin Balsam, and Dorothy Whitney all give enjoyable turns.  The film looks great (make sure you get the widescreen version), the score (which includes ""Moon River"") is excellent, and director Blake Edwards keeps everything moving at a pleasant pace.

1.  This memorable movie convincingly transports viewers into the jazzy, tacky, and hilarious beatnik era of the early 1960's.
2.  George Peppard and Audrey Hepburn have a tender, believable romantic chemistry, and they are both gorgeous to look at.
3.  Holly Golightly is one of Hepburn's finest roles.  In her performance, Audrey captures all of playgirl Holly Golightly's contradictions:  Holly is worldly, yet naive.  She projects the insouciance of a swinger, but underneath she longs for a home and family.  Holly appears indifferent to love, yet love is what redeems her.  Hepburn's performance is perceptive, sensitive, and captivating. She IS Holly Golightly.
4.  The achingly beautiful, melancholy Mancini/Mercer song ""Moon River"" and Mancini's lively score.
5.  Blake Edward's stylish direction.
6.  Audrey's elegant clothes.
7.  Last but not least, cat.

5412312,2,B00AEFXL5W,"Breakfast at Tiffany's is probably the most famous classic film amongst the younger crowds. Mainly because A) it has Audrey Hepburn in it and B) it's in colour.
Now an explaination for the two star rating. One star is for the music and ""Moon River"". I simply adore the music. It's the best thing about this film. A second star is for the cat. The cat seemed to be the only character in the film who knew what was going on.
Serious acting critics would hammer this film. The most important line in the film [which Audrey says] is rushed, overacted and looks rehersed. The character of Holly Golightly is a selfish, gold digger, yet she is sugar coated with Audrey's charm. She's a fake, a phony and she uses people constantly throughout the whole film. Audrey was not right for this role. She even said so herself. Audrey wasn't a fake. It's this film which makes her appear so.
As far as the screenplay goes, it's rather confusing. I couldn't make head or tails of Golightly's former husband's significance to the plot other than to make Holly look like an even worse person. And the whole mob involvment was even more confusing. The character of Holly is erractic. She makes desions without even thinking about how it might affect her later. She hurts Paul [""Fred""] because she uses him and he falls for her. It takes Fred to basically tell Holly that she is a big phony and a selfish, foolish girl to her face until she decides to change.
A lot of this film could have been edited. It wasn't very true to Truman Capote's novel either. But, on a surface basis, the film is a wonderful study in 1960s style, as a substance basis, the film is poorly written, acted and edited. Serious film buffs, you can put this on a 10 year waiting list. It's not that important to film history, as much as it is to fashion history.",1030752000,16,1817,4.45945945945946

George Peppard, for all his blue-eyed good looks, has the screen presence of a deep freezer and Mickery Rooney's cameo as the irate Japanese upstairs neighbour is terrible.

Of course, you know the screen is just going to light up with Audrey Hepburn, but it's made esspecially good with George Peppard, and all those wonderful people.  In fact, I can't think of a single criticism of this movie.  The music is splendid, the cinema-photgrahy is gorgeous, script is witty, and the plot exciting.  At the end, you want Paul and Holly to end up so badly, you're almost tempted to fast-forward the tape- just to make sure they really do.
Annother thing I enjoy about this movie is that no person is really squeeky clean.  Paul is having an affair, Holly is jumping from man to man, getting herself in bad situations.  In most romance movies, its one person that has the problem, most of of the time never both.  It's sort of refreshing to have a more realistic view of people.
Have I mentioned most of everything?  Oh yes, the partys.  This film shows the most terrific partys, everything in this one large rythym, working like a well oiled machine.  You have to see it for yourself.

Based on the novella by Truman Capote, Breakfast at Tiffany's is essentially about an eccentric, runaway girl living in New York City (Audrey Hepburn) who exists in a swirl of parties and lives off of the gifts of rich men. When a young author (George Peppard), who is actually supported by a wealthy woman, moves in an apartment nearby, a beautiful romance begins to blossom between the two. My summary doesn't really do justice to the beauty and charm of this film (and of its leading actress), but be sure that this is a story you won't forget.
So, all in all, this is a beautiful film. Almost like a fairy tale, but more realistic because of the flaws of the characters, its only mistake is Blake Edwards' racist portrayal of the Japanese landlord.

I'm fourteen and totally NOT interested in the shallow movies of today. (I've always been more interested in the past; I love biographies of actresses like Jean Harlow.)  So I took a trip to my local Blockbuster and rented this movie, along with Casablanca.  (I didn't like that movie, surprisingly.)
I popped B@T in my VCR first, and that image of Audrey as Holly eating that danish in the window of Tiffany's had me hooked.  Now, I didn't think any movie could be better than Moulin Rouge.  This one just might be.
I adore Holly and Cat, and I adore ""Varjak, Paul"" just the same.  The entire cast is just WONDERFUL (Buddy Ebsen, who was supposed to be in my 4th favorite movie of all time, The Wizard of Oz, plays Doc Golightly, Holly's ex-husband and makes a great appearance.)
The first meeting between Holly and Paul is my favorite, with her getting ready to visit Sally Tomato and him helping her find her black alligator shoes.  And the last scene, with the two searching for Cat and kissing in the rain (with Cat between them, looking none too happy), has got to be one of the most romantic scenes EVER.
I found myself hating Holly when she told Paul she was going to marry Jos&eacute; (thank GOD she didn't!), feeling so sad for him during the Doc fiasco, laughing as they stole those two masks from the 5 and 10 cent store, and finally, sighing at the close.
Breakfast at Tiffany's is a wonderful movie from beginning to end.

5412346,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Audrey Hepburn is a large influence on my life (those of you who read reviews under my old sn will know that), and this is possibly her very best film. Breakfast at Tiffany's is the story of a young woman who's lost herself over the years. She lives in an apartment with a cat who has no name and eccentric neighbors calling at all hours. Her name suits the personality: Holly Golightly. She falls in and out of romance, but is a romantic. She's somehow well known yet nobody really knows her.
The title of the film comes from Holly's habit of taking her breakfast on the streets of New York and looking in the windows of Tiffany's while she eats (immaculately dressed, of course).
When Holly's husband appears- seemingly from nowhere -and declares her a fraud, not the high society woman she masquerades as, you get a feeling for the character. I imagine everyone has a different opinion of Holly, but to me she's inspirational. She's willing to leave behind her old life and remake herself in New York City, to never abandon hope for love and to become someone better, someone with a named cat!
Joking aside, it's a beautiful film that I would recommend to anyone. I'll agree with one of the other reviewers that it is not for the younger crowd simply because they wouldn't really understand or appreciate it. This is a film for the more mature who would like something a little different from the ""new"" romantic comedies.
Everyone does well with their parts, Audrey is perfect in her role and George Peppard carries it very well where Audrey leaves off. It's the essential love story for your DVD collection.",1020729600,,1611,4.636363636363637

Don't kill me for saying this but I didn't find this a comedy.

From the opening shot of Audrey Hepburn as the enchanting pixilated Holly Golightly, elegantly dressed in simple black gown and pearls with hair swept wispily off her neck, delicately devouring a danish while gazing longingly into the glittering windows of Tiffany's, I wanted to be her.  However, as the film unfolds, a much different Holly Golightly is revealed, one who appears playful and resilient on the outside but who suffers from crushing bouts of the ""mean reds"", a fear of lonliness and disconnection which only a ""breakfast at Tiffany's"" can cure.  Holly has landed by way of Hollywood in New York City to reinvent herself and survives on the $50 per powder room donations of the shallow sex crazed men that desire her and whom she often ends up ditching.  She throws wild parties, wears lots of perfect little black dresses and unbelievable hats, looks stunning with mere hours of sleep, visits an incarcerated mafioso named Sally  Tomato to exchange weather reports, earning a neat hundred for her efforts, and crawls through windows and into bed with her new neighbor who tenderly reminds her of her brother Fred and whom she calls Fred.  She is, at once, a bon vivant, charming and flighty, resourceful and manipulative, vulnerable and lonely, captivating and clever, wise and naive, anxious and frightened.  We are simultaneously attracted to and rooting for her, beside her during her mischievous Halloween mask shoplifting spree in the five and ten with ""Fred""  in love with her guilefulness; heartbroken and sympathetic when she receives word that her  brother Fred has been killed in action; and yet disappointed with her callousness when she sends Doc back home, alone, and her insensitivity when she thoughtlessly abandons ""cat"" in the rain, never believing that they belonged together, not realizing that she had actually found a place to call home, the place she has always been searching for.  The original 1958 story was rewritten to make the screenplay more palatable for 1960's audiences.  Lost are the homosexual undertones (it is suspected that Paul Varjak is gay in the novella and there are hints of Holly`s bisexuality in it as well) of Capote's work as well as the ""true to the spirit and occasional vulgar mouth of `Miss Holly Golightly, Traveling`,"" ending in which she disappears without a trace.  In the Hollywood happy ending version, the wild thing Holly is finally captured by Paul's charms. The final shot of the lovebirds kissing passionately in the pouring rain with ""cat"" returned safely to Miss Golightly's arms remains the essence of the true and reliable Hollywood romance.",1006128000,7,2645,5.085450346420323

Sleek and sophisticated, clever and innocent, beguiling yet without guile: Hepburn demonstrates her natural ability to dance without moving and love without ever having met the audience. She was of an era and grace when poise mattered.
And best of all, the writer gets the girl. The good guy finishes first.
Swoon with me, and watch this perfect movie once again. Buy it, own it, never let it go. It is all we've got, really, of Holly Golightly, of the Audrey Hepburn we love.

The acting falls short occasionally from script flaws and the blackouts are silly, but the performances are quality, first rate and most heart rendering. How eloquent Patricia Neal as the doting ""patron of the arts""; how tour de force Mickey Rooney's performance of almost completely unintelligible dialog; how different the Buddy Ebsen character that we view on this screen; how sexy, attractive and infinitely warming is George Peppard's portrayal of a writer who has a patron of distinguished means; and how unbelievably delightful the Audrey Hepburn who fills this screen with a bubbling vitality of deceptive charm, kookiness, and vulnerability.  Revisiting this movie as an adult, there appears to be a great deal of Neil Simonesque dialogue interwoven throughout the movie.  And the Mancini music has elements of a Blake Edwards product, rendering the movie more endearing with each scene. My favorite line is from Martin Balsam who is quite taken with Holly: ""She's a phoney, but a real phoney."" If you work in New York, you can identify the woman.  I found myself weeping in the last ten minutes of this movie -  as a cat lover and a fan who succumbs to the passions of two lost-in-the-woods, lonely lambs who need someone to watch over them.

5412357,4,B00AEFXL5W,"If you have read Capote's novella, it is impossible to take this film seriously, especially its second half.  Not because of some bogus complaint about 'respecting the book'.  The first half works so hard to 'code' the unsayable (e.g. watch Paul rescuing the South American from the police raid), that when a conventional love story develops, the whole narrtive becomes lopsided.
It's a shame, because there are so many cherishable things in 'Breakfast at Tiffany's', most of them emanating from cinema's most extraordinary actress, Audrey Hepburn, giving an emotional powerhouse of a performance that breaks through the phoney conception of a 'real phoney', and becomes a moving commentary on her career, her image, her past.  'Moon River' sends shivers and wells tears like no other moment in film, and Jack Warner must have had cloth ears if he thought that voice wouldn't do for Eliza Doolittle.
Edwards brings a rare visual intelligence to his treatment, using the devices of 1950s melodrama to provide an ironic commentary on characters with no self-awareness.  The sunny melancholy and love of New York (especially the 'breakfast' odyssey, complete with shoplifting sequence borrowed from Melville (Jean-Pierre, that is)), the use of caricature to define difference from a makeshift community, all point to another great New York masterpiece, 'Seinfeld'.",992995200,,1361,5.375586854460094

Though Truman Capote desperately wanted Marilyn Monroe for the part of Holly Golightly, it went to Audrey Hepburn, who defines perfection. Ms. Hepburn brought such class and sophistication to the part, but was still able to convey the second layer of insecurity. Early on in production, she was afraid she couldn't do it, but no one will ever say she failed with this film. The supporting cast is tragically out-shined, as they are all exceptional in their roles, but it's hard to live up to Audrey's accidental wonder. The film takes many liberties from the novella, including a different ending - which changes the meaning of the story completely - but the film doesn't suffer. Holly, in the book, is caught forever in the dance she does, going around looking to belong but never finding her rainbow's end. In the film, she finally completes her cycle when she realizes that she belongs with Paul, her huckleberry friend.

5412374,4,B00AEFXL5W,"Anyone wondering why Hollywood stars, and even the lesser players, earn so much for a few weeks of standing in front of cameras would be well advised to watch 'Breakfast at Tiffany's'.  As everyone knows, this is one of the most wonderful, charming, romantic movies EVER- and it could so easily could have been a disaster.
The first problem was the script; Truman Capote's novella was nearly eviscerated in an effort to get the more censorable aspects of Holly Golightly's life into a form acceptable to mass audiences.  Holly's unconventional attitudes towards sex, race, love, and earning money were jettisoned; the only 'kookiness' allowed to remain was her habit of garaging her wardrobe under her bed.  Characters were eliminated, a subplot with characters not in the novella introduced, and a 'boy-gets-the girl' ending substituted for Capote's. ....
Amazingly, it worked- and the reason is the actors, beginning with Audrey Hepburn.  Her Holly is one of the marvels of film history; you can't imagine anyone else in the part.  George Peppard- usually a stalwart, uninspired actor- rose to her level,and the result was magic.  Patricia Neal, so often wasted in films of the 1950's, saves a badly written part through her unbelievable ability to communicate subtext.  Even the most minor actors, such as the extra whose hat is set aflame at one of Holly's parties, simply glow with their belief in what they're doing.
The result?  Instead of an albatross of a movie, Paramount got a gold mine, a film that has earned non-stop for forty years.
If you haven't seen this, be sure you do- and soon.  It's the quintessential romantic comedy, a yardstick by which all others are measured. ....
 Anytime you want to be put in the most romantic mood possible, you need to get out your cassette or DVD of this one, and watch these wonderful people work their magic all over again.  And hey, where else you gonna see Audrey Hepburn and Buddy Ebsen play a love scene- and make you believe it?",976406400,5,1986,4.863501483679525
5412375,5,B00AEFXL5W,"This wonderful romantic comedy featuring Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard and adapted from a novella by Truman Capote is as complex as it is touching.  As we meet Holly Golightly (Hepburn), she appears to be a quirky girl of modest means who yearns to lives the jet set lifestyle.  She window shops at Tiffany's and throws wild parties in her apartment.  Her chief source of income comes from weekly visits to a Mafia don in prison, relaying ""weather reports"" to his lawyer on the outside.  She seems to be the picture of superficiality, described by O.J. Berman (Martin Balsam) as a ""real phony"", a person who is not what she appears to be, but is convinced she is.
Paul Varjak is an apathetic writer with one book and no ideas.  He moves in upstairs from Holly and they immediately strike up a fire escape friendship.  His only source of income comes from being a gigolo to his wealthy interior decorator (Patricia Neal) who pays him handsomely for his services every chance she gets.  Paul and Holly seem to be two of a kind, abject losers pretending to be what they are not.
However, as the story unfolds, the layers are peeled away and the motivation for Holly's go-lightly personality is revealed in her difficult past.  She is far more complex and deep than we first believe, using her lifestyle as a defense mechanism, a way of running from herself.  The friendship and love that grow between Paul and Holly make better people of each and ultimately help them to transcend their personal flaws, but not without great difficulties.
For director Blake Edwards, who became most renowned for a spate of Pink Panther movies, this film was probably among his finest moments.  These were complicated characters and he revealed them slowly with nuance.  They were also developing as people and his treatment of this effect was both subtle and powerful.
The film was not without controversy.  Truman Capote was adamant about having Marilyn Monroe in the lead, but the studio went with Audrey Hepburn, who was far less popular but who was probably better for the complexities of the character.  They had selected a very young John Frankenheimer as director, who at that point had only TV credits on his resume.  Hepburn refused to work with him and he was dumped in favor of Edwards.  Capote wanted the film to remain true to the book's dark and depressing ending, but the studio chose to play to the masses and end it on an upbeat.  Personally, I'm glad they did.
The film has been roundly criticized in the present day for the character portrayed by Mickey Rooney.  Rooney played a caricature of a bumbling Japanese neighbor that was extremely unflattering to Asians although admittedly it was hilarious.  This is considered a shocking portrayal in today's politically correct society, but it stirred little furor at the time, when everyone was far more insensitive and far less oversensitive.  When the film was released, the biggest criticism was that Edwards overused the character to the point of making him nauseating, which was an obvious error in judgment.  If Rooney only had one or two scenes rather than roughly a dozen, it probably wouldn't have become such a lightening rod.
Hepburn and Peppard were both terrific in the leads.  Hepburn, who was nominated for best actress for the role, gave Holly a lovable quirkiness that belied her deeper troubles.  When it was time to broaden the character, Hepburn gave her intricacy and depth that I feel Marilyn Monroe never could have accomplished.  Peppard was more than just a dashing and handsome foil for Hepburn.  He played Paul with sensitivity and refinement and had incredible chemistry with Hepburn, making the romance very natural and believable.
One of the best things about the film was the soundtrack, which brought the film its only two Oscars from five nominations.  Henry Mancini's musical score was marvelous and film's theme song, ""Moon River"" written by Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer is an enduring classic.
The DVD version brings new life to the original Technicolor photography and brings fullness to Mancini's fabulous soundtrack.
This richly textured film has both depth and range.  It has just the right balance of lightness and heaviness, with well-explored characters that change before our eyes.  I rated it a 10/10.  It is an intelligent and affecting film that is worth seeing.",976060800,27,4363,4.907356948228883

5412377,5,B00AEFXL5W,"I love this film. From the first scene when the yellow cab stopped with Holly alighting,having her breakfast in front of Tiffany's to the very last scene when Holly & Paul reconciled and kissed in the rain...
Simply marvellous piece of work.  With the flawless performance from Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard. The unique mood of the movie. And my fave song ""Moon River"". Who can forget the part when Holly sitting by her window plucking the guitar strings and singing....""Moooonnn River....""  Great adaption from Truman Cropte's book with many magical touches and refinements. It's about a free-spirit girl Holly's struggle in Life,her fear of Love and commitment, she didn't even think she own her nameless 'cat'. Paul is a struggling writer who actually a 'kept-man' by a rich lady. Fate brought them together,first as neighbours to friends and eventually lovers. They were soul mates who needed each other and are made of each other....they are after the same rainbow end.
The idea was refreshing....esp.doing things that each have never done:- Strolling down New York street in the morning, stealing, visiting the Library and of course Tiffany's. Simply amazing, fantastic and romantic .
The best part about it was both Holly and Paul were practical people with dark secrets and not really perfect human beings and it make the story more realistic but not losing the romantic fairy tale feel.
This film is one of the best in movie history. It touches my heart my soul with scenes with the perfect combo of laughter,sadness,ironic,truth,secrets,romance,life,etc....... Timeless and Unforgettable......",974246400,7,1607,5.249027237354086

Audrey Hepburn was one of the most beautiful actresses I ever seen. Her style, and the way she carried herself all together is probally what every girl want to be like. She was a very talanted actress, and a beautiful woman. When I saw this movie, I really enjoyed every moment. Not only does Audrey Hepburn give a great performance, but George Peppard gives a good performance also. I was very caught up in the movie! I personally enjoyed the beginning, because I think it's what many people do, especially women (including me ). When you see it you'll know what I am talking about, and if you saw it then you already know. I definately recomend this movie to everyone, especially those who love romantic movies.",970617600,2,830,4.503311258278146
5412379,5,B00AEFXL5W,"I feel it almost unnecessary to comment on the beauty of the movie, as I hope you have already seen this Clasic Hepburn film.  Beautiful romance, and acting.  But what is so exciting about this release for me is the widescreen format, and the quality.  I am far to young to have been able to see this in the theatre, so this was my first chance to see the movie in the aspect it was originally intended.  Through the widescreen format you can really see the films beauty and what your were missing.  The quality of this anamorphic DVD is also phenomenal for such an old film.  Color saturation and grain is very good.  If you liked Breakfast at Tiffany's, own it on VHS, or have never seen it, you must have the DVD>",970358400,3,716,4.298507462686567
5412380,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Audrey Hepburn had a lot of memorable, glamorous roles as highly individual, sensitive young women.

But her most iconic turn was as Holly Golightly, a frivolous young woman with a highly sensitive core. Hepburn is a ball of shimmering charm here, whether she's setting hats on fire or chasing nameless cats through the rain, and she's able to shine brightly enough to obscure a few flaws (such as Mickey Rooney). The other actors do serviceable jobs, but she's undeniablythe star.

""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is a daily ritual for Holly Golightly (Hepburn), a social butterfly who hosts parties, entertains drunken men for their fifty-dollartips, and dreams of owning a horse farm in Mexico with her brother. When kept-man Paul Varjak (George Peppard) moves into a neighboring apartment -- courtesy of his rich patroness -- he is instantly enchanted by the ditzy, sweet-natured Holly.

But for all Holly's fun, Paul starts to realize that all is not well with her. She's desperate to marry a spectacularly wealthy man, parties with wild crowds, visits a notorious gangster in jail, and hides that she was an illiterate teen bride to a hick doctor. As Holly's life starts to deteriorate, Paul sets out to show her what her life will be like without real love.

Reportedly Truman Capote wasn't happy with the movie version of ""Breakfast At Tiffany's"" -- they changed the ending from his short story's, and he didn't like Hepburn as Holly Golightley. But this is one case where the movie's quality is not reflected by what the author thought of it -- taken on its own merits, it's a fine chocolate with a bittersweet center.

Much of the movie is devoted to the friendship (and unspoken attraction) between Holly and Paul, and how it disrupts their comfortable shallow lives. Paul spends the whole movie unravelling the unhappy tale of Holly's life as she starts spinning out of control. Things climax nastily with Holly's already-questionable reputation being sullied, but the finale is an exquisite mix of brutal honesty, true love and a very unglamorous rainstorm.

That said, it's a pretty hilarious movie -- witty dialogue (""... if you like dark, handsome, rich-looking men with passionate natures and too many teeth"") and plenty of kooky humour (""TIMBER!"" Holly yells as a drunken model keels over, followed by the crowd parting like the Red Sea). And there are plenty of charming, warm'n'fuzzy moments, like the cute day trip through New York.

One thing that will make viewers cringe: Mickey Rooney's caricatured Japanese landlord who objects to Holly's parties. Not. Funny.

Though she was no party girl, Audrey Hepburn is pitch-perfect as Holly -- she can be flaky and adorable (""I'm CRAAAZY about Tiffany's?""), chattery and glamorous, with a cat she refuses to name because they're just a pair of ""poor slobs who don't belong to anybody."" But she can just as easily flip the switch to show the wounded, almost childlike side.

George Peppard is just as good -- albeit less winsome -- as a writer-turned-kept-man-turned-writer-again, whose protective affection for Holly grows as the movie goes on, but who has to get through her ironclad defenses. And Patricia Neal rounds out the cast nicely as the icy, cynical woman whom Paul gives his non-literary services to.

Hepburn is the flawed diamond at the heart of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" and her charm and acting ability elevate this beyond just another adorable romantic comedy.",966384000,9,3436,5.044091710758377

All of it is drawn together flawlessly into a timeless classic.  I loved this movie.  Audrey Hepburn was fantastic and should have gotten an Oscar.  All other  actors including the Japanese guy put out performances that were  outstanding.  I have never, ever, felt so good after watching a movie than  I did after watching this.

5412392,5,B00AEFXL5W,"I have seen many romantic comedies, but ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""  is -- by no stretch of doubt -- my all-time favorite. The chemistry between  Audrey Hepburn (one of my favorite actresses) and George Peppard is one of  the best I have ever seen.

5412393,4,B00AEFXL5W,"Breakfast at Tiffany's is the perfect example of what a romantic tale can result in when it concentrat on developing and shaping the main characters before having them persue and desire eachother.
The reason I can't give  this film five stars is becase the embarrasing appearance of Mickey Rooney  as a Japanese landlord.  I can not simply toss this asside as a result as  it being dated.  The period this film was made in was one where many great  japanese films were being made.  Point being, Rooney could have easily been  replaced with a real Japanese man.  Surely Rooney does not possess some  comedic skill that no other actor could muster.  It is made far worst by  the fact that he is one of the first images in the film.
Lucky for the  viewer, this character appears infrequently and the charm of the story and  Hepburn shine through.",956966400,3,843,4.608108108108108

5412395,5,B00AEFXL5W,I Absolutely LOVED this movie! The Main Charecter Holly Golightly is so sweet and caring and sooooo complex! I have seen the movie a over and over and I still can't figure her out. She is never one dimensional. She always  has depth and is never perdictable. She the moment you see her on the  screen you fall in love with her. She is warm and open and never fake! She  has sooo much Charisma! I just can't say enough about this movie and about  Holly. You will just have to see it your self!,956620800,2,492,4.147368421052631
5412396,3,B00AEFXL5W,"...and it reminded me of the first time I saw this movie. I was about 12 at the time. Hepburn plays the main character Holly Golightly who's supposedly a call girl (in those days that topic wasn't clearly mentioned on the Silver Screen--not until MacLaine did ""Irma La Douce"" a few years later), but the first time through I didn't know what that meant (maybe a telephone operator?). It's unclear throughout whether Holly had any ""visible neans of support"", though. It takes some doing to follow Holly's incessant chatter--sometimes inane, sometimes philosophical. A new neighbor who's a writer-cum-gigolo (George Peppard very pre-""A-Team"") moves in as her new upstairs neighbor. On the top floor lives an annoying Japanese neighbor played by Mickey Rooney in a very pre-PC role that has him with a Tojo-esque overbite as he threatens to ""coru da poreese"" at any noise, even too much talking in the stairwell, which as we know Holly can't help any more than she can help breathing.
But the scene that most stuck in my mind to this day is when Holly is hosting this typical drop-in cocktail party. Everyone is drinking martinis and gimlets and suchlike, there are enough people present to seriously violate maximum occupancy laws and it never occurred to me until years later that, despite the left-to-right bypass kisses of greeting (""mwah...mwah!"") and the ""dahlings"", it was just a bunch of people hanging out and getting smashed. In spirit no different from beer blasts I  went to years later as an undergrad, slopping up cheap draft. Anyway, Holly  spots the fact that one of her guests is so wasted that she's about to black  out on her feet. With just the right timing, Holly yells  ""Tim--berrrrr!"" like a lumberjack, and sure enough, the lady  topples over with a crash like a felled tree. Don't ask me why that sticks in my mind, it's not exactly a pivotal scene. It just did, that's all.",955497600,2,1896,4.821538461538461

5412399,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Audrey Hepburn has never been better than she is in this film. 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' is a classic charming tale of eccentric city girl Holly Golightly (Hepburn)who is so stubborn to remain independent that she  refuses to fall in love. But Paul, aka 'Fred' (George Peppard)moves in near  Holly and soon turns her life upside down. Along with memorable characters  such as Holly's cat named Cat, her 'agent', Sally Tomato in Sing Sing  Prison, and overly-characterized Japanese landlord (Mickey Rooney), this  film is uplifting and sweet. Even if you're not crazy about Hepburn, or the  story, watch it for Hepburn's gorgeous wardrobe, in which she defined 'the  little black dress'.",952300800,4,685,5.172727272727273
5412400,5,B00AEFXL5W,"Everybody should watch this great film, but from this DVD format. Even if you already have the widescreen VHS version of ""Breakfast,"" I definitely recommend to buy this DVD. Colors are richer and more sharply defined, and the sound is digitally remastered for surround. The whole experience is more satisfying than watching it on VHS. During the close-up shots of the actors and the ""deep focus"" shots one can perceive the real difference in video definition. Since the sound is re-channeled to a 5.1 surround, one can experience an enhanced dialogue and soundtrack. What else can it be said about this great movie? Please indulge me with the following: All the actors in this movie are exceptional in their roles. Patricia Neal and especially Martin Balsam are hilarious. Although Audrey Hepburn shaped the movie and made it into such a success, a lot of credit should also be given to George Peppard. His restrained and reflective portrayal was the perfect foil to Audrey's display of insecurities, joy, and hope. Yes, in the end, the strength of this unique romantic comedy comes from Audrey Hepburn's casting against type and her wide-range acting abilities. Her nuanced, bittersweet acting made the already good story even better. If a typical Hollywood ""bombshell"" had been casted as a call-girl, it would have turned out to be just another run of the mill movie.

8550444,4,B00AEFXL5W,"This is a SPOILER review of book and movie review from my Creative Writers-

Shannon- the movie fit that retro aesthetic and centered around some ""taboo"" things in the 30's. Audrey Hepburn is a great actor for this movie, but I didn't really think the guy that played Paul showed enough emotion for apparently being in love with Holly. I LOVED Cat though. GREAT ACTOR PORTRAYAL! That scene in the rain had me in TEARS. Because of Cat. Not the people.

Toe- I'm not usually a fan of movies from the 60's, but this has to be one of my favorites from that period. The acting is amazing and adorable, but Cat is definitely my favorite character. While it's not exactly like the book, this version is enjoyable on it's own.

Trash - Assumed by a high schooler to be a movie about two prostitutes, this movie details the rather weird and wild life of Holly Golightly through the being of Paul.

Abby- It was a quality movie, it was just not my kind of movie. To me, it was quite boring. The acting was good, and plot was okay. The book definitely has a more realistic ending.

Raja- I liked the movie and I liked Cat.",1526428800,,1111,4.3478260869565215
