7951843,1,B00005R5GY,"There should be laws that govern the image quality of dvd's, especially when the production comes from ""international"" companies.  As consumers, we automatically assume that commercial films with international distribution, will also have a professional image quality... not the case at all with this movie.",1375833600,,307,5.822222222222222
7951844,5,B00005R5GY,"Have you ever wished an action movie had a good plot? Zero Woman Returns has an excellent storyline and the action is realistic compared to recent Bond flicks. The main character is Rei (portrayed by Saori Ono) an agent for Section Zero, a covert ops division for Tokyo Metro Police. This time Rei seems to be more of a government assassin/ infiltrator rather than a detective in other films. She is bored by the downtime so takes various part time jobs. One of these jobs is working in a plant store where she makes deliveries to customers. She delivers an order to Kayama, an executive that Section Zero has under surveillance for possible dealing in stolen weapons. Rei is ordered to get close to him and since there seems to be chemistry between them, Kayama offers her a job. Kayama tells her his business has two sides, an official one and a real one. The real business is stealing weapons from police and government warehouses and selling them. An amusing Chinese villain is portrayed and dispatched. Rei and Kayama soon find they are very alike. Kayama at one time was an agent of Section Zero and left to pursue his own interests. An inner conflict for Rei as Kayama tempts her to leave Section and join him in in leaving Honshu for a better life. The two assassins are shown to be laughing and playing like an ordinary couple and Rei wishes for a normal life. Rei ultimately has to make a decision before Section Zero decides to sanction Kayama. Fans of the show Nikita will appreciate this film. Also- the cover is just a selling point, she never wears that.",1372291200,,1569,4.587188612099644
7951845,4,B00005R5GY,"Entertaining entry, some nifty twists in the plot. Fun to watch, good cinematography. Saori Ono shines, clothed or otherwise although her acting skills may need some work. I took one star off for ultra fast subtitles - sometimes impossible to spot much less reading. Not much of special features on this DVD either.  There is a dubbed version on the DVD tough. Altogether worthy piece of entertainment in this genre.",1091145600,2,416,4.942857142857143
7951846,3,B00005R5GY,"I'm not sure if this is the same Zero Woman as in the first movie, but judging from the opening scene of her dispatching some drug dealers, she's in full control, without saying any lame questions about believing in heaven.
After delivering a Silk Jasmine plant to a man named Kayama, she is ordered by her boss to keep an eye on him, as he is suspected of selling confiscated guns and drugs to corrupt police department officials.  Her job is to get close to him and find out who his connections are.  She discovers that like her, he doesn't officially exist, and this gives him the ability and desire to control his own destiny.  Kayama in turn is attracted to her, making his secretary, with whom he was dallying, jealous.
A funny scene involves her looking through the classifieds and speaking to herself aloud, hoping for something that would use her experience as a killer.  She gets a page from her boss.  ""Oh, a hit job!"" she exclaims, leaving the woman next to her aghast.  However, her taking on fake identities at part-time jobs results in her having to recall her assumed name.  Someone has to call her name more than once before she remembers, ""Oh, that's me.""
Well, at least it's better than the first movie.  Saori Ono is tougher than the first Zero Woman actress, although not as pretty.  She's able to defeat her opponents with more consistency than her predecessor.  The relationship between her and her boss is akin to La Femme Nikita or the tepid remake Point Of No Return.  Maybe that's her story-she was convicted of a crime, had her death faked, and became an assassin, but we never learn her background.  Lots of people get shot, and there is a memorable scene involving a power drill.
This was the second of two Zero Womans done by Tokyo Shock.  The series was continued by Asia Pulp Cinema, presumably because of its bigger budget.  I haven't seen those films, but if they're any better than the first two Zero Womans, I'll know why.",1027123200,4,1959,4.591954022988506
7951847,2,B00005R5GY,"This may confound some,but I thoroughly enjoyed the first Zero Woman dvd. Action,beautiful actress-and vile villains getting a good payback. Not so in this one. The plot had a good idea and let it fall short. This movie is SLOW,and uninteresting. Saori Oko is attractive-but went to the Spock school of acting,the other characters apparently went there as well.
 If you are looking for something along the lines of the first one,Beatiful Beast is Z.W.Returns antithesis. If you purchase this-I hope you are entertained more than I was.
 Decidedly more of a tragic-drama than 'hard boiled action'",1017360000,12,595,5.123711340206185
