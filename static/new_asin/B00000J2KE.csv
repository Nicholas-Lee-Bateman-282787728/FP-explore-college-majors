1231387,4,B00000J2KE,"I eagerly anticipated Ms. Ross' return to the screen.  Although the script was not the best, the performances by both the DIVA and Brandy were excellent.  The chemistry was outstanding.  These two had a ball and you  can easily tell that.  Makes you wonder why Diana isn't given more acting  roles.  The songs were superb as well.  Brandy's ""Never Say  Never"" CD and Diana's ""Every Day is a New Day"" are must  haves in any collection.",936316800,,434,4.592105263157895
1231388,4,B00000J2KE,Well as always BRANDY was fine as ever and very good at waht she did.  Overall i think the movie was excellent with a few exceptions.  That song that Brandy and Diana sing in the end is da Bomb.  They should make it a  single.  I LIKE! :),933120000,,238,3.875
1231389,5,B00000J2KE,Both Miss Ross and Brandy give strong performances and the musical productions are entertraining in themselves.  Harvey should have had a bigger part though.  A must-have for any Ross or Norwood fan!,928886400,3,199,5.1875
1231390,5,B00000J2KE,"I have been a Diana Ross fan since seeing her play Dorothy in ""The Wiz"".  She played the part so well.  She needs to be given parts like this more often.. Diana you go girl.
As far as Brandy, I have watched her  and liked her since her days on Thea.  Brandy is an overall talent.  Whether she is acting or singing she does it well.  Brandy you go girl.",928281600,,352,3.9571428571428573

1231437,2,B00000J2KE,Diana Ross cries better than anyone on screen but tears won't save this lightweight tearjerker where Diana more or less plays herself...The Boss Miss Ross...BUT still this is a must see/must have movie for Ross fans since the former Supreme has only made 3 films and 2 tv movies to date despite her superior acting talent. Colored girls have a hard way to go in Hollywood...and everywhere else it seems. Is this the last film of her career?  There aren't many starring roles for aging black actresses in Hollywood and we know Miss Ross has to be the star that glitters and outshines all the rest.  Speaking of aging black actresses..whatever happened to Oscar-winning Halle Berry?,1334275200,2,680,4.853448275862069

1231441,5,B00000J2KE,"This is a EXCELLENT movie, a MUST HAVE for Diana Ross &/or Brandy fans. This is how a mom sacrifices for success, & gave up her only baby in the process (while dealing with teenager vs: career) i HIGHLY RECOMMEND this DVD.",1281052800,,222,4.309523809523809
1231442,1,B00000J2KE,"I finally bought this film and sat down to watch it hoping, deep in my heart, that it'd be at least half as good as claimed in the above posted reviews. You see, I always admired Diana Ross and believe her to be a very talented actress when given the right vehicle to display her wares. However, I am sorry to report that ""Double Platinum"" is not what we fans have been waiting for since ""Lady Sings The Blues."" This is just a low-budget made-for-TV movie with a predictable script, over the top melodrama and uncomfortable performances by all involved, specially Miss Ross.

I guess the producers of ""Double Platinum"" just wanted to have an excuse to introduce the legendary Diana to the Brandy generation. Or maybe it was just a blind attempt to unite two top names of the music industry hoping for a quick blockbuster. Whatever the intentions it doesn't work. Physically it is impossible to believe that the younger singer could have been mothered by the Supreme lady. Meanwhile the script does not allow anybody to behave naturally or cohesively which only adds to the feeling you are watching a falsehood from beginning to end. The music? No big deal. Wardrobe? Low-budget. But what I found truly upsetting was Miss Ross mouth and teeth. Whatever happened to her luminous smile that brightened my youth?  Painful.",1263859200,,1318,4.776315789473684
1231443,5,B00000J2KE,"Diana Ross and Brandy Norwood did very well in this movie. Alot of insight as to what goes on in the music world, i enjoyed everything about this movie the singing especially. I highly recommend this movie.",1233532800,,206,4.594594594594595

1231446,5,B00000J2KE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Double Platinum was heartwarming as well as inspiring. Diana Ross is truly the consummate diva. She captures your attention whenever she walks out on a stage. The music made me cry, dance, think, and it made me want to sing. Yes, I ordered the CD, Every Day is a New Day! I have worn the grooves out of the CD and watched the movie three times. The duet with Diana Ross and Brandy was one of the highlights of the movie. I hope you will enjoy it as much as I have.",1154736000,2,497,4.134020618556701
1231447,1,B00000J2KE,Double Platinum was filmed in Widescreen even though it was a made for tv movie. the region 2 PAL dvd in the UK is Widescreen. Re-release this dvd in widescreen,1137196800,5,160,4.366666666666666
1231448,3,B00000J2KE,"For starters, The movie is in Full Screen. Although it was also in Full Screen on ABC, it was filmed in Widescreen, Region 2 in The UK has a full Screen DVD.

Back to the movie, Double Platinum is about singer Olvia King (Ross) Who chooses to leave her husband and newborn for a record deal. Years later when Kayla (Norwood) is a Teen, Kayla wins a Radio contest to meet Olivia, unknown they are mother and daughter where Olivia announces she's Kaylas mom and helps Kayla also become a star.

While The movie it's self is a great story, The music used is all from Brandy's 1998 Album ""Never say never"" and Ross' 1999 Album ""Every day is a new day"". the main problem with the movie is way too much lip syncing goes on
Given the fact that some scenes they're supposed to be performing live and recording the songs in the studio, an effort could have been made to make it seem more realistic.
Other than that, It's a must have for Brandy And Diana Ross Fans because it's a good movie. It just should have been in wide screen and feature more live singing",1115337600,10,1051,4.303030303030303
1231449,4,B00000J2KE,"Despite Soul music legend Diana Ross remaining the most successful female recording artist of all time (a total of eighteen U.S No. 1 hit titles to her credit) her movie career has not quite hit the heights of success it has often deserved though received an oscar nomination for her dynamic and powerful performance as Jazz/Blues legend Billie Holiday in Lady Sings The Blues (1972). Since then shes appeared in the moderatley successful Mahogany (1975), The Wiz (1978) which was a commercial failure and deservedly won wide praise for her harrowing performance as a paranoid schitznophrenic in the acclaimed T.V movie, Out Of Darkness (1993). In Double Palatinum she starred alongside Teen R&B sensation Brandy. The story goes that Olivia (Diana Ross - the character is a mere imitation of the Ross mystique and legendary status) is a struggling lounge singer at a downtown nightclub who abandons her daughter Kayla (Brandy) to pursue her showbiz dreams. Flash foward 18 years later and Olivia is now a massive star to whom Kayla - who is still ignorant of her orgins and is embarking on her own singing career - goes to for advice. When Kayla finds out that Olivia is infact her mother she agrees to let Olivia introduce her to some useful contacts in the business and makes it clear that its purley to further hrown career and not to form a mother-daughter bond as Olivia hopes. Whilst being a predicatable story and the scripts certainly run through a fair few cliches, the film is saved by the dramatic and convincing performance of Diana Ross. Her heart is clearly in the role and she carries the film convincingly proving that she hadn't lost any of that dramatic acting power and dazzling on-screen presence that made Lady Sings The Blues such a success. Brandy also puts in a likeable performance and the two stars enjoy a number of dramtically moving scenes. A tear-jerking movie that has a predictable but lovely ending. Diana Ross and Brandy perform many songs off their current studio albums of the time and Diana Ross' performs the exciting He Lives In You with style and verve, backed by an effective South African orchestra and gospel-influenced backing singers. She also proves shes still a dynamic diva as she performs the rip-roaring dance number, Carry On during the awards ceremony sequences. Both Diana and Brandy perform a touching, sparkling ballad at the climax of the movie, Love Is All That Matters which closes the movie beautifully. This T.V movie often careers along like a soap opera and whilst you could argue that this is purley an old-fashioned tale thats been done countless times before, its such a joy to see Diana Ross back on the screen who makes the most of her role, biting into it with a venegance and displaying a raw, instinctive performance, proving her undoubted wide range of abilities. Fans of these two singers will most certainly be enthralled by both the film and its accompanying soundtrack. Defintley worth a look.",1038096000,12,2968,4.879207920792079
1231450,3,B00000J2KE,"This was not the movie of the year, not bad but not good, it was okay.  The story is du ""Dejas-vu"", very clich.  The acting performance of Diana Ross was good, it seem real, more then the one of Brandy but Brandy was not so bad.  Their performance as a singner were both great, good music in this movie. If you are a fan of Diana Ross or Brandy you may love the movie, for others it's just a nice simple movie.",1029110400,7,410,3.975609756097561
1231451,4,B00000J2KE,"Being perhaps the ultimate Diana Ross fan I will admit i was strongly biased towards liking this movie.  And I did.  But on second and third viewings I found myself enjoying it just as much as I had the first time.  Diana Ross is well, Diana Ross here, but she's also an acting talent to be reckoned with.  She makes Olivia King an all-too-human, dimensional character pushing all the right emotional buttons.  Her scenes with Brandy have a real emotional tension to them.  Definitely makes one wonder why she hasn't had more of an acting career.  She really is good here, objectively speaking.
I will admit to not being much of a Brandy fan before the film, and while I'm still not president of her fan club she won a lot of points with me here.  She's a surprisingly good actress who holds her own with the formidable Diana.
And let's not forget the music.  First rate all the way.  Both dramatically and musically Diana and Brandy have done themselves proud in this outing.  I recommend this movie wholeheartedly.",1008201600,3,1016,4.620111731843576
1231452,5,B00000J2KE,"When I first heard about the movie, Double Platinum, I was a bit reluctant to watch it, as I knew it was a movie that was specially made for TV, and I have been disappointed by a lot of made-for-TV movies in the past, but I was pleasantly surprised with this one.
Diana Ross and Brandy are both wonderful in this movie and you couldn't picture anyone else playing their roles. As mentioned in the main review, the story revolves around Olivia King (played by Diana Ross)who chooses to leave St. Louis and go to New York in order to better pursue her career of becoming a singer. As a result, she leaves her baby daughter, Kayla (played by Brandy) behind.
18 years later, Kayla wins a competition to meet Olivia, whom she doesn't know is her mum(and is one of her biggest fans) and from there the story progresses. The movie revolves around Olivia and her amibition to get to know the daughter she never knew, by helping her start her own career as a singer. From there, the viewer goes through the highs and lows as seen through the eyes of the two characters and by the end of the movie you will believe that love is all that matters.
Fans of Brandy will recognise the songs, ""Almost Doesn't Count"" and ""Have You Ever"" during the course of the movie. For me, the main highlight was both Brandy and Diana Ross singing ""Love Is All That Matters"" at the end of the movie.
It's a very heart-warming, feel-good film that is worth buying. You won't regret it!",1006387200,3,1454,4.408921933085502
1231453,5,B00000J2KE,"This is a must for all Diana Ross fans.  It's a brilliant story and leaves you with a lump in your throat.  Even my husband enjoyed it and he is not usually into this type of film.  The only disappointment is that there doesn't seem to be a CD of the music.  If anyone knows different, please let me know.",1002931200,,305,4.033333333333333
1231454,4,B00000J2KE,"This movie was good, but at many times it got a bit too dramatic and left many details unaswered. I liked it, mainly because of the songs that stand out. I love Diana Ross who has one of the greatest voices of all time and Brandy is also a great singer and that is what rescued the movie from being an overly-sentimerntal and dull story. Brandy's songs are good but believe me, when you hear those of Diana you will want her CD Every Day Is A New Day which contains the song Love Is All That Matters (sang by Diana only) and some killer remixes of Until We Meet Again.
The only extras are the filmography and discography of each singer and the video for Almost Doesn't Count (Brandy) and Until We Meet Again (Diana Ross).",995328000,4,721,4.2700729927007295
1231455,5,B00000J2KE,"I'm a huge brandy fan, and anything she's a part of I'm there! cause Brandy spells Quality! I mean the acting on both of there parts deserved an oscar! The title of this dvd should have been called ""the divas tale"" because they both showed that there both very beautifull,classy ,multi talented african american women and deserve nothing less than the title of divas!",983145600,2,367,4.75
1231456,4,B00000J2KE,"The legendary soul diva, DIANA ROSS, stars alongside R and B teen sensation, BRANDY, in this compelling drama about a mother who is forced to  choose between bringing up her baby or pursuing her life-long ambition as a  singer and its the latter that she chooses. Years later she meets her  daughter, Kayla, who's goal is to also become a famous singer. Olivia  (Ross) reveals herself to her daughter and promises to help guide her  career and introduce her to some well known contacts of her own. Olivia  also desperatley tries to build a mother-daughter bond with Kayla but Kayla  more than once rejects her,feeling betrayed by her mother abandoning her  when she was young. Both DIANA ROSS and BRANDYS performances are excellent  and moving in some emotional and powerful scenes. This often tear jerking  tale is far better than the usual average standard T.V movie with a  wonderful supporting cast and complete with a stunning soundtrack to which  both Ross and Brandy are vocally excellent and all tracks can be found on  their own recent albums. The movie ends on a note of triumph and joy with  Ross and Brandy performing the beautiful Diane Warren penned duet, LOVE IS  ALL THAT MATTERS with that being the theme of the movie. Very good and also  a triumph in DIANA ROSS' and BRANDYS career.",966988800,4,1300,4.762331838565022
1231457,5,B00000J2KE,This movie was one of the best ones I've ever seen.  The movie was very sad but then it was exciting.  I think the movie should have had a better ending.  It should have ended with Adam and Olivia getting back together  and for Brandy and them to be a family again.  This movie really touched my  heart.  Ms Ross I love your music.,954806400,2,331,4.078125
1231458,4,B00000J2KE,"As a biggggggg fan of Brandy I loved this film. I do agree that the story could have been more detailed than it was, but the music compensated for the whole film. it was nice to hear Brandy sining live and finally getting  to see her singing her songs on her album, which is the bomb! I must admit  not really a big fan of Ms. Ross, but must admit her performance was good  and so was her song. All in all this movie shed a light on both actors in a  deaper way.",954115200,2,462,3.882978723404255
1231459,2,B00000J2KE,"I've always respected Diana as an actress and the same respect goes to Brandy as well. This movie was the pits and I was sorry that these two talented ladies were wasted in it! Not only does it have the most tired,  overdone plots in film history, but it had the most tired scripts I have  heard since Poetic Justice. The extra star is only because of their stage  performances. It should have been a VH1 ""Diva"" special instead.",949968000,,428,4.3924050632911396

7911835,3,B00000J2KE,"Diana has been a globally mega-success since the 1960s headlining the biggest selling female artists, The Supremes. (Billboard magazine, the music industry's trade magazine), has chosen Diana twice as the Most Successful Entertainer of the Century in 1976?and 1988! (It is an award only she has ever won.
Along with music, she has exclusively been given this honor.
1n 1972, she blazed across the silver screen, winning an Oscar nod in her film debut, ""Lady Sings the Blues"" as Best Actress. She also won the Golden Globe Award as Best Newcomer and a Best Actress nod.
She followed up ""Lady"" with the enduring pop film, ""Mahogany"" that would be a #1 hit in Vareity. The theme song also became a #1 Billboard smash and Oscar nominee. As importantly, Diana won the Best Actress Cesar for ""Mahogany"", France's equivalent to the Oscar! ""Mahogany"" still airs on cable quite often....most recently spring 2017! )It grossed over $50 million, converted for today's inflation).
Initially, her next film, the musical ""The Wiz"" was viewed as a career faux pas. Diana's ""E.S.T.""-like performance was seen as laborious and miscast. The critics attacked her with a vengeance. The box office initially $24 million. After numerous cult showings and constant cable airings,""The Wiz"" calculates over $600 million globally! Admittedly, Michael Jackson's sole film, the transitioning of the entire cast save for Diana certainly changed the film's financial perception.
Diana was nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Actress.
She worked passionately for years to make the bio-film of Josephine Baker's life. She portrayed La Baker in her Tony Award winning ""An Evening with Diana Ross"". She even lived in Paris for a year researching her life. Unfortunately, HBO scooped her in the excellent ""The Josephine Baker"". Lynn Whitfield, actress that won the role in a performance reeking of Diana. It has since become a lost dream for Diana.
The film before ""Double Platinum"", ""Out of Darkness"" earned Diana her 3rd Golden Globe.
Prior to completing ""Double Platinum"", she mentioned in several interviews a desire for her film be a light fluff, family pop film. ""Double Platinum"" fits the bill. The music is quality and youthful. Sans an official soundtrack, the songs ended up on Diana's and Brandy's current albums at the time.
Diana's performance is a little sad with a tad too much pathos. Brandy's performance reeks of a little too ""All About Eve"" lacking the high drama.
With a short film resume, Diana's clearly been denied a full and rich filmography.
The Award winning production team, Merron/Zadan delivers a Top 10 Neilsen's winner. The IMDB gives the movie 5.9/10. After ""Life with Judy Garland"", ""Double Platinum"" is Director Robert Allan Ackerman's best known film. Brian Stokes Mitchell gives an all too brief performance as the lead character's husband.
The movie has had a global release!",1503273600,,2879,5.140724946695096
