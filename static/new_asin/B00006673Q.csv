1711327,5,B00006673Q,"This movie is a must own! I've seen a few good surfing movies,but this one is by far the best. More of a documentary compared to ""In gods hands""which is not bad. Anyway the soundtrack sounds really good with a nice surround sound system combined with Laird  tearing up them big ... waves you can't go wrong. This dvd works well as backdrop at a kickback or gettin faded and chillin out. Even if you don't surf you will appriciate the shots.",1023667200,5,440,4.365853658536586
1711328,4,B00006673Q,Just saw this in the UK (yes they surf there too!!) and was hoping to buy the region 1 DVD - guess I'll have to wait. The footage on this DVD was AMAZING - high quality and impressive. I only wish it was longer and they included more profiling on Laird himself. He is a surfing God.,1020038400,3,282,3.9649122807017543
1711348,5,B00006673Q,"There are giant wave surfers and there is Laird. This guy sets the bar way too high, he is the master, he is mr ocean. In some sequences of this movie you literally feel this cannot be real. Laird must be some sort of alien dropped on earth from some liquid planet. It is mesmerizing. He is so natural, blends with the ocean, in absoulte control. Mind bogling...",1242604800,,362,4.338235294117647
1711349,5,B00006673Q,Product was sent in time for Christmas as promised and in tact.,1169078400,,63,4.333333333333333
1711350,5,B00006673Q,"Other reviewers have discussed the surfing in this movie -- it goes way beyond that, however. This movie is about transcendant involvement -- being a part of something larger, greater. Anyone who watches this can see and feel it -- and then, hopefully, look for it in their own life -- without having to ride huge waves. If it's all One, then it's available everywhere!",1150243200,,369,4.6923076923076925
1711351,3,B00006673Q,"First I will submit to the all the superlatives of Laird Hamilton and this footage. Now: What is wrong with this film.  37 minutes -- too short. Secondly, the foil fin sequences and the build up of this being the evolution of surfing, I don't think so. This should have all been eliminated. That leaves us with about 25 minutes. The DVD also needs to be re-edited as there are some waves that just don't belong there. Further, you don't really get the perspective of just how big, fast, and powerful Jaws is, because much of the footage is shot from above the waterline. The other omission is that yes, while Laird is likely the King of Jaws and tow-in -- uneasy lies the head that wears the crown. There are lots of other tow-in greats. I've known Laird since the 70's, when the flying saucer dropped him on the Earth to lead the charge into the beyond of surfing. I will be fascinted to watch his evolution in his 40's and 50's.",1106870400,7,930,4.375722543352601
1711352,5,B00006673Q,"Whether you surf or not, you cannot help but to be awed by the surfing skills of Laird Hamilton.  I recently popped this DVD into the player when a family cookout got rained out; initially there were cries of dissent, but after the first 20 minutes or so, the room was met with a hushed awe.  Everyone there (and of all ages) enjoyed the film immensely; it's a real keeper and guaranteed to please.",1091491200,12,398,4.364864864864865
1711353,5,B00006673Q,"Really enjoyed this vid. There is some really insane footage from Jaws. Definitely got to see some of what Laird is really capable of. Was also nice to get some more history and information about Jaws itself. They do kind of go a bit overboard in talking up Laird like he's superman. No question the guy is a killer surfer doing some amazing things, but he doesn't need to be worshiped. I'd grab this one up if for nothing other than the footage of Laird's wave in Tahiti.",1083196800,13,472,4.375
1711354,5,B00006673Q,"This is a great DVD!!!! It is a little short but well worth it!
Laird makes riding these monster waves look easy, but it ain't! Years of wave riding and physical fitness,not to mention HUGE HUEVOS, are needed to be riding waves this big. I surf, but these are waves from some outer realm of insanity. Crank up the surround sound and let it rip!!!!!",1077062400,7,348,4.369230769230769
1711355,4,B00006673Q,"I give the surfing video at least 4 if not 5 stars.  The waves are truly impressive.  But the movie is short . . . 37 minutes.  $17 for a very short film does not strike me as a good value.  Honestly, ""Ride the Wild Surf,"" free on Cable, has the same level of Laird adoration and great footage of Jaws and doesn't cost a dime.",1073433600,8,326,3.893939393939394
1711356,5,B00006673Q,"I've been surfing since 1961. I've seen the Best Out there. And Fortunately for me, some of these Surfers I have made special Fins for.
Mavs bunch, North Shore. But after a friend went to Hawaii and watched first hand Laird ripping upside down 360's in the Tube.
I was awestruck at his stories. The man is a surf muscle as we called Jeff Hakman in the 70's. The waves in this movie are the
star. And Laird the Director. Tea'hupoo blew my mind as did
Craig Camfield's at Inland Surf who lent me the movie. Can you
imagine getting a wave lip as thick as a Chevy Suburban Dump
on you? Laird deserves All the accolades. Figgy",1065744000,14,621,4.271186440677966
1711357,5,B00006673Q,"I gave this DVD to a friend who's 4 teenage Boston boys have just started surfing (world class downhill skiers, all).  Blew the 4 of them, their dad and MOM out to the edge of their seats.
I love watching this DVD on airplanes, its the best crowd pleaser you'll ever get, everyone wants to watch it.  Great photography, colors, waves and story.  Nice work Laird!",1064880000,9,362,4.454545454545454
1711367,5,B00006673Q,"To see Laird explode out of the biggest fattest barrell that likely anyone has ever ridden, will have you screaming in your living room.",1055980800,,136,4.708333333333333
1711368,5,B00006673Q,"I've seen this film three times and can't get it out of my mind. I do not surf. My Husband grew up surfing in Santa Cruz. He's the reason we watched this film. Boy, am I grateful. A film has never moved me this much before. The silken images as Laird Hamilton glides through the water, along with the soundtrack, bring this film to a level of awe, wonder, and beauty. Less we remember that a person could die while creating this splendor. His actions are terrifying, yet, appear serene and tranquil. I told my husband that I was in love with Laird Hamilton, not in love with the person, but in love with his essence and what he represents. He is a symbol of risk, challenge, and the chance of death all while displaying peace, grace and respect. It's mystical. Thanks for the trip!",1051920000,5,781,4.393103448275862
1711369,5,B00006673Q,"If Laird Hamilton was hip hop, he'd make Snoop Dogg his biznitch!  This guy is freakin' insane.  He's a big ol monster, with king kong huevos battling surf that looks like the last parts of A Perfect Storm.  Instead of all drowning and seeing Diane Lane in the water, Laird and his crew tow their culos into some fat beastly waves, and instead of just punching through and racing the wave just to stay alive, Laird pops, carves, and owns these mountains of water.  The footage at Teahupo'o is some of the craziest surfing I've ever seen.  The thickness of this wave is a marvel.  We're talking ENERGY and POWER breaking on near exposed reef!  And Laird rocks through this beast like it ain't no thang.  This wave is a serious Class Rosie Odonnel sitting on a bed of broken glass.  Now that's heinous!
Do yourself a favor and buy this flick.  This DVD will humble any ego.
You think you da man?  Then watch this little film.
Yeah, that's what I thought.",1048550400,12,952,4.445086705202312
1711370,5,B00006673Q,"I just watched ""White Knuckle Extreme"" for the third time in two days. Laird Hamilton has evidently crossed a spiritual line that most surfers (including myself) can't even begin to approach. While the awesome sight of Hamilton's physical strength and agility rocketing across and down the face of monstrous waves is great eye candy, the true essence of this DVD is the rhythmic poise that Hamilton sustains as he enters the focal point of every wave. So many surfers clumsily muscle their way through big waves in attempts to ""conquer"" them. In direct contrast, Hamilton's reverence for earth's purest energy is manifest by his unassuming style. The visual images as well as the short narratives demonstrate Hamilton's joyous acceptance of his ""secondary role"" in each fantastic ride. As I watched the incredible footage of Hamilton riding these dangerous waves I got the feeling that he consciously minimizes his presence as he, almost inconspicuously, becomes part of the raging forces around him. The soundtrack (Moby, Bender, Ben Harper, Robert Aviles)exceptionally enhances the visual. I highly recommend this DVD to surfer and non-surfer alike.",1047772800,7,1151,5.329670329670329
1711371,5,B00006673Q,"With a husband and two sons who are serious surfers, we have nearly every surfing video/dvd available.  Even with that history, Laird (White Knuckle Extreme) was stunning.  Some of the footage is literally unbelievable.  After having seen it several times, when my husband and sons watch it again and again I still hear the expressions of amazement from the other room.  This is a real masterpiece.",1038700800,3,398,4.984848484848484
1711372,5,B00006673Q,"This is great surfing! Too bad it is only 35 minutes long. The bonus material fills out the rest of the 60 minutes and should be viewed. On the feature, the photopraphy is some of the best. There is no plot and there is no lame attempt at making one -- just great waves. Jaws (Hawaii) and Tahiti are shown incredibly. Crystal clear shots and up close. Be warned that most of it is tow-in surfing (only way to get really big waves). The slow-motion of some shots may annoy some, but I think it really adds to it. The soundtrack is fantastic (possibly better than the movie!). The editing is very clean. It is no wonder this movie won awards. I definitely put it above ""In God's Hands"", ""Big Wednesday"", etc. I won't put it above ""Endless Summer"", because they come from different directions (ES is documentary with a story, but LWKE is pure surf), but this film is pretty darn good.",1036368000,2,881,4.411042944785276
1711373,5,B00006673Q,"Having been a surfer all my life and having surfed the North Shore of O'ahu, I've known about Laird Hamilton for the last 15 years. He's been doing ""Tow-in"" surfing for close to 10 years now. I come from a family of surfers and they freak out every time they see this DVD.

This is the ULTIMATE surfing video, as well as one of the top 20 Extreme Sports video. What Laird and his colleagues are doing are beyond INSANE! These are the biggest waves ever surfed in history. These waves are HUGE!! The waves that I surfed on the North Shore are Lake Tahoe shorebreak compared to what Laird is surfing in this video, and he totally tears these waves apart! He'll catch major air riding down the face of the wave, getting completely barreled and pull out of it, and exiting the wave, he'll fly out about 10-15 feet flipping in the air. It's totally insane. He and his colleagues are doing things and experiencing what NO ONE else in the world are doing, not Bill Gates, not the President, not Michael Jordan, not Shaq O'Neal, not Lennox Lewis, not ANYONE.

One of the surfers in the DVD hails Laird as the ""Best Surfer in the World"". That's all relative. Maybe he doesn't have the small wave and competitive skills of a Kelly Slater or a Tom Curren, but when it comes to tow-in surfing in Hawaii or Tahiti, then yes, he is the best surfer in the world. He is definitely the best at what he does and is the ultimate ocean athlete.

People have absolutely no idea how treacherous these waves are. They are HORRENDOUS! They can hold you under water for more than 1-2 minutes if you wipe out on one of them. People die on waves an eighth of this size. Laird is the ULTIMATE water athlete! He defines HUGE! He defines psychotic!",1026604800,33,1718,4.379310344827586
1711374,5,B00006673Q,"I had heard of this kid on the North Shore wreaking havoc but have never met him. He's doing ""other-wordly"" things on the most amazingly huge waves I have ever seen! He's definitely an innovator, with developing the Tow System to the Laird Board. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat...it's hard to believe that the waves he rides are actually real! They look like special effects waves they're so freakish, and my man Laird makes it look easy, but he's a top conditioned athlete who works very hard at his craft. This is a must see!!",1024012800,2,547,4.425742574257426
7961681,3,B00006673Q,"An excellent film about a living legend.  But it's WAY TOO SHORT!  The content is high-quality but a man who has lived and lives like Laird deserves so much more time in retrospect of his achievements and pure, honest humanity.",1486252800,,227,4.65

7961685,3,B00006673Q,"This DVD is only 37 minutes, no subtitles and the video looks more like watching a home video. Get the DVD called ""Step Into Liquid"" and see Laird riding the same Big Waves in stunning HD and is 2 hours long. Even ""Riding Giants"" is better than this.",1434672000,,250,4.229166666666667

7961688,5,B00006673Q,Not just another surfing dvd. It's Laird for goodness sake. He attacks waves he shouldn't but can. And he does it in ways others are trying too. You won't be disappointed.,1374278400,,171,4.548387096774194
