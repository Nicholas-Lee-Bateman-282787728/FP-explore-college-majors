8692296,5,B00QQRBKY6,"I have 3 of Cathe's spin dvds for my at-home spin bike and I love her style of training.  I figured I'd try this dvd and I am so glad I bought it.  I love it.  This is my favorite type of workout which is fairly traditional weight lifting.  The exercises are done through reps and repeated sets, with rests in between.  This type of workout has always been best for my body type in order to get/stay toned.  It's a really good workout if you are looking for a gym type workout at home.  On a side note, I have RA and psoriatic arthritis which has caused lots of issues in my shoulders, yet I can do all of these exercises without exacerbating those issues due to the controlled movements and muscle isolations.",1529280000,,710,4.253731343283582
8692297,4,B00QQRBKY6,"I'm always on the lookout for good strength training routines that challenge you and have found that Cathe is great when it comes to pushing your limits.  While I enjoyed XTrain's ""Bi's & Tri's"" and ""Shoulders, Back & Chest"" more I wanted some diversity and this DVD provides it.  The biceps section was pretty brutal - three sets each of concentration curls, varied hand grip curls and hammer curls (I used regular hand weights instead of a barbell).  She ends each set with a ""finisher,"" which is meant to completely burn out the muscle.  In the case of biceps the finishers were ""W"" curls and two rounds of ""Crazy eights.""  I was fried.  The shoulders portion was also challenging; I usually can't match Cathe as far as how heavy the weight was but this time around I was able to.  Overhead presses combined with upright rows and lateral raises were the exercises and the finishers were ""scarecrows"" and shoulder extensions (laterally lift then release as though you're pouring water).  The extensions were very challenging and effective.  The back segment was my least favorite but that's mainly due to the fact that I didn't have heavy enough weights to get the full benefits.  The exercises include regular rows, slightly tilted rows, pullovers and finishers using a medium resistance band.  While she provides adequate rest between sets when it's time to move on she moves at a pretty rapid pace.  The resistance band work could be confusing if you're not sure what you're doing.  That really was my only gripe, however.  I can see how this will build muscle fast if you pick weights that are challenging enough for you.  Cathe is her usual personable self and is struggling right along with you so you feel as though you've got a workout partner rather than a trainer barking orders; I'll probably use this DVD fairly regularly because it was tough but it isn't my favorite of hers and that's why I docked one star off.",1463702400,,1927,4.744744744744745
8692298,3,B00QQRBKY6,"I have followed Cathe, and purchased many of her dvds for several years. I have really liked her training methods, instructions and pace at which she trained. However, with Lift It Hit It, she moves through each segment like she is racing against time. The training is intense, you can see how much the participants struggle through the exercises, and keeping up with her pace in moving between sets and exercises. Regardless of the weight you choose, the pace of this dvd was much different to me than her others; it is not slow and heavy.",1461283200,3,540,4.635416666666667

8692301,5,B00QQRBKY6,"I have all the Ripped with Hiit workouts and I think this one is the hardest of them all! This workout, as the title suggests, works your back, biceps and shoulders.  Rear delts are the main shoulder focus.

You do 3 sets of heavy weights for each exercise; followed by a finisher exercise that will really fire up your muscles and make them burn!  You aim for 12 reps or less on the heavy weights and try to work towards muscle failure.

Cathe tells us what weights she is using and while I could not match Cathe on any of the weights she used but I got a great workout and really felt my muscles burn.

Equipment needed:
Barbell - Cathe uses a 35 pound one
Dumbbells - Cathe uses 35, 30, 20, 15, 10, 12 and 8 pound dumbbells
A step with 4 risers
Chair (optional)
Resistance band - Cathe uses a medium tension band.

Workout crew:  Al, Amanda, Brenda and Jai

Workout outfits:  green tops and grey bottoms.

Set 1: One arm rows, underhand barbell rows and power pulls with band as finisher.
Set 2: Overhead pulls, overhand barbell rows and supine power pull with band as finisher.

REAR DELTS

Set 1:  Delt fly with standing one arm delt pull with band as finisher.

STRETCH

The best part of the workout!  This is a well-deserved stretch for those hard working muscles.

If you like challenging yourself with heavy weights, you will enjoy this workout.",1427241600,8,1789,4.5886075949367084
