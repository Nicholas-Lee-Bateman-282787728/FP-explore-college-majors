8501821,2,B002JHDBZ8,"This a documentary about a dog rescue owner who clearly knows very, very little about dogs and the tragedy that ensues because of it. Her heart is in the right place but her life is dictated by fear. You'd think a person who owned a shelter would have some clue about canine behaviorism and how to change aggressive behavior. She clearly does not. She sees aggression everywhere and has only two solutions. Get an aggressive dog adopted asap or use the needle because her limited understanding about dogs suggests an aggressive dog cannot be fixed. This woman needs to either educate herself or get out of the business. She is doing no one any favors.

You will see three dogs killed without any effort to change their aggressive behavior in this documentary.  The first in the opening credits. It is a waste and reeks of ignorance.",1386633600,,832,4.691780821917808
