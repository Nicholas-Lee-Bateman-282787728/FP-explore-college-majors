I missed it when it was shown on TV but liked everything else that Working Dog Productions has done so bought the DVDs on spec.  I started the first episode then ended up watching the entire 2 seasons in one day...I couldn't stop watching.  It was great, very very very funny and, sadly I have a feeling it is a touch too realistic of how some political decisions are made. If you want a great laugh, do yourself a favour and buy this set, you won't be disappointed.",1248048000,,541,4.346534653465347
8540351,5,B001LX4LNM,"Who are the people behind the government's ideas? This Australian comedy hilariously reveals how simple things like whether a medication is good for you, or getting people to enroll in the armed forces can be twisted out of all recognition.
An ensemble cast shares the burden.
I wince at close to reality this series gets sometimes. All too easily true.",1232236800,,353,4.9
