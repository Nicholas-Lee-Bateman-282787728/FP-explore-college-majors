This movie had very funny moments that made me laugh out loud. Other moments were slow and lacked the regular Jerry Lewis feel.

2107580,5,B0002NY8VC,"I have been a longtime fan of classic comedy and slapstick. I went into this film in search of something to make me laugh or at least chuckle now and then because I've seen so many classical comedies I'm beginning to run out and pick rarities like this.

Slight spoiler to follow...

This one had me rolling with laughter on the airplane scene. Truly brilliant and absolutely astoundingly clever comedy there (what happens in the movie happens in the movie - you'll see what I mean when you watch it and it's genius). The movie is divided into little skits with the uncles of a rich orphan girl but it gets better than that. You can tell based on the ending that Jerry Lewis has copied the Charlie Chaplin style of laugh and cry in the same picture. That, by far, is what made me give this film five full stars and a must see for any fans of Jerry Lewis. Absolutely brilliant through and through. Not quite a Chaplin pic but a Chaplin Junior if you will. I'll watch it again and again to be sure. Though don't expect all out laughter throughout though you'll get at least some chuckles here and there. Comedy is difficult stuff to pull off so that is to be expected. At least when you watch it you'll see the cleverness in all the comedy routines which is brilliant. Few modern day movies have made me laugh so hard as in classical films like this. There's much to be said for the old school comedians and what they did to make us laugh. This here is a keeper.",1429660800,,1460,4.324817518248175

Jerry Lewis places a number of characters in this fun movie.
When a young girl, Donna Peyton (Donna Butterworth) is orphaned when her father dies and leaves her with $30 million. Her father's attorney, John Wyman, explains that she must visit each of her six uncles (all played by Jerry Lewis) and decide which of them will become her new father.  However she doesn't want to live with anyone accept her limo driver who she feels is her best friend and confidant.  The laughs begin almost immediately in this tender heartfelt family movie.

Recommended as a family film.

2107654,4,B0002NY8VC,"Ahh... what a film. Jerry Lewis blends tragedy and comedy so well. The recurring themes of the man/child, the bitter clown, the wellmeaning buffoon who can't help but wreck chaos. Jerry has a very complex and sad side to him, but he weaves them into such absurd, but completely human individuals. This is still a sweet-natured comedy for adults as well as children. No social satire or cynicism here. The physical humor on display is quite ingenius. Better than Buster Keaton or Chaplin easily.
This is only the 2nd Jerry Lewis film I've ever seen (Guess the first) and I'm excited to discover more of this underrated comic auteur's special brand of slapstick. The commentary is a huge letdown, not even worth a listen. He just remembers how cute Donna Butterworth is and how much laughter was had on set. Its cool to see the very brief bloopers and screen tests. But you'd think he had more worthwhile material to slap on this DVD. Oh well. Enjoy.",1230854400,,948,4.682634730538922
2107655,5,B0002NY8VC,"This one has to be second only to Jerry Lewis' comic masterpiece, ""The Nutty Professor"". I've watched ""The Family Jewels"" many times as a kid, and it still hasn't lost its appeal.
Who can resist the wacky premise of having Lewis play several nutty characters running amok on screen? The young Donna Butterworth lends plenty of charm to the tale of an orphaned girl who must choose which one of her uncles she'd like to live with. But it's clearly Lewis' movie all the way as the young girl meets each relative, to comic effect. There are many funny moments in the picture. My favorites? Uncle Eddie, the dashing wanna-be flight pilot of the Great Blue Yonder, who must take a plane load of fussy, jabbering old ladies to Chicago. His flea trap of an airplane is so beat up that it prompts one air traffic controller to say to the other: ""Well, you lost the bet...he made it this time!"" The other is the English uncle who fancies himself as a detective, complete with his ""Dr. Watson"" (the late Sebastian Cabot). And watching Lewis play a game of pool is one of the most hysterically funny things I've ever seen; it's proof of what a brilliant physical comedian Lewis is. Even Lewis manages to ""plug"" his son Gary's band, ""Gary Lewis & the Playboys"".
Clearly, one of Lewis' best, and loads of fun for the family.",1225238400,,1311,4.5358649789029535
2107666,5,B0002NY8VC,"THE FAMILY JEWELS is my favorite Jerry Lewis movie. I know that most Jerryphiles cite THE NUTTY PROFESSOR, THE BELLBOY or THE LADIES MAN as his best work, and well they should because those are great comedies. But THE FAMILY JEWELS makes me laugh louder and more often than those other sterling efforts. It's also a more successful blend of slapstick and sentiment. A picture the entire family can enjoy.

Playing multiple characters gives Jerry a perfect showcase for his talents. His hysterical portrayal of ""Captain Eddie,"" an incompetent airline pilot, is worth the price of the disc. Co-star Donna Butterworth is cute and charming without being cloying, unlike so many other child actors.

As Jerry himself might say, the movie is filled with lots of crazy, wonderful, nutty stuff. If you're a fan of this legendary funnyman, THE FAMILY JEWELS is a must-have addition to your collection.",1220227200,,892,5.02027027027027

2107669,5,B0002NY8VC,"After the Nutty Professor, Jerry Lewis topped himself by playing eight characters  in the film The Family Jewels

Donna Butterworth play the orphaned little  rich girl, who needs to pick a father from her father's seven brothers (all played by Lewis). Lewis also plays her driver and companion Willard. All this comedy may seem uneven in this farce. Lewis overworks himself trying to balance director, writer and star and it shows on film. However, as uneven as this film is, Lewis still plays this slapstick comedy to the hilt and it works.

The best extra  on this DVD is the full audio comentary of Lewis with his friend Steve Lawrence (of Steve & Edie fame). There are interesting tidbits of information on filmmaking and the film itself. They say that hindsight and age is revealing, this DVD proves this true. Also if you want get this and Lewis's Nutty Professor, The Bellboy or Cinderfella (all his best works)

This is a family comedy that the whole family can watch,  so get it!

2107670,5,B0002NY8VC,"Whenever I watch this film, I pick up on humorous bits that I missed previously. There's enough gags here for another movie. While Jerry has his detractors, I don't think anyone will deny that the films he wrote and directed - especially his color films- are terrific to look at. The cinematography here is gorgeous. Jerry has so much fun playing different characters that it's impossible to not get caught up in his enthusiasm. And while his commentary is disappointingly skimpy, when he does talk you can hear that this is a filmmaker who clearly knows what he is doing. As the young heiress, Donna Butterworth is adorable but never overly cute. This is just a terrific family film.",1150848000,,684,4.756302521008403

Between the many great moments of this excellent movie we find a funny homage to Terry-Thomas ( Lewis as the nonchalant and zanny aviator of a tumbledown airplane ) and Anne Baxter in a short but unforgettable comic scene. Another diamond of one of the most innovative comedy directors of all time.

2107672,5,B0002NY8VC,"The 1965 comedy ""The Family Jewels"" was the brainchild of Jerry Lewis, who not only starred in the film as seven different characters, he also directed and co-wrote the film.  The film's story is about an orphaned heiress named Donna Peyton (Donna Butterworth) who has been taken care of by the family's chauffeur Willard Woodward (Jerry Lewis).  Because Donna is a child, she must decide whom she would like to be her permanent guardian among her six uncles that are each portrayed by Jerry Lewis.  After visiting her deceased parent's attorney and executor (Neil Hamilton, 1899-1984, who played Commissioner Gordon in the 1960's TV series of ""Batman""), Willard takes Donna to spend time with the first of her six uncles, who are an odd bunch: an old & incomprehensible sea captain, a bumbling photographer, a would-be Sherlock Holmes complete with a would-be sidekick named Dr. Matson (Sebastian Cabot, 1918-1977), an airline pilot with no sense of direction, a gangster wanted by the law and an unpleasant circus clown that hates children.  Some of the funniest scenes involve the airline captain named Captain Eddie, who owns and operates his own airlines out of Chicago.  A group of women played by Jesslyn Fax (1893-1975), Renie Riano (1899-1971), Ellen Corby (1911-1999, best known for her portrayal of Gradma Walton in ""The Waltons"" TV series of 1972-1981), Frances Weintraub Lax (1985-1975), Marjorie Bennett (1896-1982) want to travel to California. Having missed an earlier flight, they instead obtain tickets to have Captain Eddie fly them there in his antiquated propeller-driven plane.  After finally getting off the ground, the women are treated to a hilarious in-flight film about a dinner-party; but Captain Eddie loses his map and inadvertently flies them in a circle back to Chicago.  Also very funny is the gangster uncle named 'Bugs' who often wears a mask to hide his face.  Once he removes the hideous mask, his face isn't much different.  When he successfully kidnaps Donna, it's up to her 5 other uncles to rescue her; but in the end, she must still decide whom she would like to live with, and it turns out to be rather interesting.

Overall, I rate Jerry Lewis' 1965 film ""The Family Jewels"" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it.  Of all of Jerry Lewis' films, ""The Family Jewels"" is definitely one of his best works.",1130630400,,2353,4.961832061068702
2107673,5,B0002NY8VC,This is one of Jerry's classics...I purchased several of his movies for the kids and this one is their favorite! Clean comedy is nil these days...and for lots of laughs this one is it. His Captain Eddie leaves you laughing outloud...as he slides out of the plane...lots of visual gags (Gary Lewis and the Playboys in the plane closet) that current movies lack...creativity...sure it is a light comedy and you will enjoy it with the family! No current comedian could pull off 6 characters (that they created themselves)as this!!,1130544000,,527,4.932584269662922
2107674,5,B0002NY8VC,my family and i simply loved this movie.  it was hilarious and all the parts Jerry played were simply wonderful to say the least!  I felt it was developed enough in a short amount of time so you could visit with each of the uncle's.  the one uncle that was a no show was for a good reason! it was meaningful why this uncle could not be shown longer; this fit.  all the others were just great.  we laughed a lot.,1123200000,,411,4.0246913580246915
2107675,5,B0002NY8VC,"This nutty movie features Jerry Lewis playing 7 different parts, including a cynical clown, clueless airline pilot, bumbling photographer, doddering boat captain, private detective (complete with English accent!), a goofy gangster, and more!

Lewis also plays the bodyguard/chaffeur of 9 year old Donna Payton. Her father dies, and the will stipulates that one of her 6 uncles must be named her next father--and receive her 30 million dollar inheritance.

My husband, son, and myself have watched this movie dozens of times, and it never gets old. All parts are funny, but we especially laugh at the antics of the 'photographer' and the 'pilot'. For example, the pilot is about to take a group of women to a conference in Chicago (they're flying out of L.A.) and he ends up losing the map out the window...taking them right back where they started. The funny part, though, is when the pilot (played by Jerry) is fumbling around the steering wheel (which looks like it came off a car) and it detaches...sending him backwards in a gleeful, bewildered giggle as he sails past the women seated in the cabin. He then has to chase the moving plane so he can hop back aboard.

This is great family entertainment that never gets old. I wish they made *more* movies like this!",1100304000,,1267,4.829493087557604
2107676,5,B0002NY8VC,"Jerry is an ""acquired taste,"" which I fortunately acquired at a young age!  Clean humor is so hard to find anymore, and Jerry's versatility continues to astonish me.  This movie showcases that perfectly.",1022371200,,203,5.121212121212121
2107677,5,B0002NY8VC,"I love this movie despite the reviews. I think Jerry did a fantastic job playing seven roles. People who criticize this movie should try to accomplish what Jerry did! They would never succeed! He was and still is a  genius! The Eddie's airways part of the movie is one of the funniest things  he's ever done and man,has he done a lot in his lifetime! Really really  worth watching!",935712000,,381,4.492753623188406

8029717,5,B0002NY8VC,What a hoot!  Jerry Lewis does not disappoint in this comedy.  He did a fabulous job portraying each character.  My family had a good laugh watching it together.  The quality of the film is good too.,1520467200,,199,4.444444444444445

8029719,3,B0002NY8VC,"I'm a big Jerry Lewis fan, and this really isn't one of his stronger films for laughs. Jerry looks genuinely bored and operating at half speed. Also his relationship to the little girl is a bit uncomfortable for a modern audience: their excessive cuddling and kissing and alone time gets awkward (i.e. one of the little girl's questions to Jerry: ""Why are we sleeping in a hotel tonight?""). Jerry comes to life in a few scenes to provide some good laughs: the airplane scene, his turn as a gas station attendant, and his Sherlock-character. Otherwise, to me, it's a painfully long watch.",1503273600,,587,4.764705882352941
8029720,5,B0002NY8VC,I absolutely love this movie.  And I thoroughly enjoy watching it again and again,1494806400,,81,4.785714285714286
8029721,5,B0002NY8VC,"Jerry at his best, originating, as he always did yet another fabulous film technique: playing multiple, really multiple (seven) parts that range from hilarious, kooky, dark, nerdy and that classic look that only he can achieve AFTER letting you see him in all of those other versions - LOL!  Jerry Lewis is a star who has done so much more with this life and for film and for the technology in film than most people know.  Comedy is the art of genius and he is one.  Extra mention for Donna Butterworth, the little girl in the movie.  Just fabulous!  Google her audition with Jerry for this movie. Great fun to watch them in the creative process.  In these days where everything is formulaic and computerized, children will love the sentiment of trying to help her character make a big decision: which one of the 7 characters will she choose to be her ""Dad?"" - the plot of the movie.",1492473600,,883,4.522012578616352
