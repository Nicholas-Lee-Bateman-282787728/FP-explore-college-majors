2699208,5,B000KYLDNE,"This DVD, Conversion - Following the call of Christ is especially good.
It begins powerfully with a talk on Bartimaeus' meeting with Jesus and
his subsequent healing and finishes majestically looking at the path to
illumination that is characteristic of the Journey of the Magi.
The three other New Testament figures and Jonah from the Old Testament
who are discussed are equally relevant models for understanding spiritual
development.

These six talks are probably the best I have heard.
Father Barron brings excellent examples to the discussion from Art to
Sport from personal experience to the lives of saints and crafts his
argument with refreshing clarity and confidence.
You feel that like Jesus he could outsmart Pilate and encourage the
boldness of Peter.
In short Father Barron teaches with authority and this DVD is very
special indeed.",1325376000,18,847,5.227941176470588
2699209,5,B000KYLDNE,"I purchased the CD version to listen to in my car. Fr Barron does an excellent job explaining every little detail in each of these stories of the Bible. Very insightful! Every detail does matter when one reads the Bible. If you are like me and would like to know the significance of the woman at the well, what's up with that blind man or what does that story of Jonah really mean? Then Fr Barron's explaination of every detail of these stories are for you. You don't have to be religious to enjoy this well explained easy to understand recording.",1320364800,24,547,4.425742574257426
2699210,5,B000KYLDNE,"Fr. Robert E. Barron is a Catholic evangelist and Professor of Systematic Theology at University of St. Mary of the Lake/Mundelein Seminary in Mundelein, Illinois. He is a sought-after speaker on the spiritual life-from prestigious universities to YouTube to national conferences and private retreats. He reaches millions of people through his global Ministry `Word on Fire' by utilizing advanced and emerging technologies. He also has published numerous books, essays and DVDs.

In this powerful presentation, Fr. Barron, in his characteristically energetic style, explains how conversion is not so much a one time event, but a life-long process. He says that Jesus Christ calls us in thousands of different ways to follow him, as we strive on the path for spiritual excellence.  He shows the dynamics of conversion as they are displayed in six different Biblical stories. The common theme in all six stories is turning all of one's attention and energy towards an ever deeper personal-relationship with, Jesus Christ. Throughout, he demonstrates how Christ invites us to an ever deeper participation in his life. He explores the various dimensions of this conversion, this turning toward Jesus Christ.

Though the DVD is intended as a faith formation tool for Catholics, I believe the Protestants may as well also benefit from the presentation. Don't miss hearing Fr. Barron proclaim the call to conversion that is the first word of the Gospel, a word of truth and hope that each of us needs to hear, a message that calls for surrender to Christ.",1214611200,36,1548,5.184

8159627,2,B000KYLDNE,"Unfortunately, this was delivered in early December but not used until January, when I planned to play the ""Magi"" episode for an RCIA session at my church.  Evidently the DVD was faulty since I could only get it to load, but nothing else.
