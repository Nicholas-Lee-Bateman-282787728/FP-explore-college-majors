8688906,5,B00PNQNJRW,"Finally, an anime with lots of poop jokes! I'm not the biggest fan of reading subtitles, but this is too great for it to matter. This has plenty of obscenities, unnecessary blood, and nearly non-stop ridiculousness. The animation style is perfect. This is in the same vein as Bo-Bo-Bo and Sgt. Frog, except this is more wonderfully foul. I highly recommend Azazel.",1501804800,,364,4.887096774193548
