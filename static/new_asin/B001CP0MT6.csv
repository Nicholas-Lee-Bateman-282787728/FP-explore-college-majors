8326329,2,B001CP0MT6,"About a year and a half ago, I purchased a Ten Minute Solution set with a very similar cover that included three full length DVDs - Pilates, Target Toning, and Carb & Calorie Burner. Each DVD is 50 minutes long, so there was a LOT of workout material included. I mistakenly thought that this was a similar product, with 3 different DVDs. It was around the same price as my original purchase. After this product arrived, I was immediately disappointed - there is only 1 DVD, with 1 workout from each of the three programs depicted on the cover. That means there is a total of only 30 minutes of exercise material on this DVD. FYI, if you do a search for the product I mentioned that contains 3 full length DVDs, it does not exist on Amazon at this time.

As far as the individual segments go, I was pleased with the Flat Belly Fast segment - I could tell my abs had been worked the following day. I also enjoyed the Rapid Results Pilates portion. The Fat Blasting Dance Mix segment was okay, but I didn't think it was much of a cardio workout - the pace was fairly slow.

Even if I put aside my disappointment in this product not being what I expected, I still would not recommend it. The segments aren't long enough to provide a good workout individually, and if you string the three of them together, the styles are so different that it feels disjointed. I think many people would be happier buying an individual 10 Minute Solution DVD that has received positive reviews on Amazon - I know I would be.",1378080000,3,1502,4.379928315412187
