8356384,5,B0028MFMNS,"The Korean version of Antique Bakery is by far my favorite of all the Asian and English live action dramas and comedies I've viewed in the last two decades. I want to buy copies in original Korean with English subs. WHY is it not available to buy? Why is it not reprinted? To the powers that be there IS a market for this brilliantly written, directed and performed title. Please reissue it. EDIT: Found copy in another country. :D Shopping now for all-region player.",1429747200,,467,4.571428571428571
8356385,4,B0028MFMNS,"Antique Bakery reminded me of the French movie ""Amelie"".  The plot is light-hearted with some drama and comedy.  Unfortunately, this DVD is not available so I am reduced to returning to Youtube to feed my addiction to this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1352419200,,262,4.931818181818182
8356386,5,B0028MFMNS,"This is probably one of my favorite films of all time, and it is so friggin' hard to get a hold of! I'll probably just have to break down and get the Region 2 or 3 release, one of these days...

Anyway, as for the actual movie: way the entire film is shot is gorgeous, the actors are amazing, and the adaptation of the original comic it's based on is spot on (superior to the Japanese Drama adaptation done in the 90s, though I enjoyed that one, too). The story revolves around a guy from a well-to-do family that decides to start up a bakery one day, only to run into an old high school classmate he treated horribly when the other confessed his love to him. What follows from there is a story that is actually quite a mixture of genres in the whimsical way it is shot -- at some points it's a comedy as well as a drama; a musical, as well as a very down-to-earth slice of life story. It even has a tinge of something you would find in a bona-fide horror film when recounting the dark background of one of the characters. The movie, for me, is like a love-letter to film in general as it indulges in fantastical visions of heavenly pastries. It's a story of things unexpectedly coming together in ways we probably never would have imagined, much like real life.

If you love cake, or simply love good filmmaking, do yourself a favor and watch this. I guarantee you won't be disappointed. Maybe if we yell loudly enough, there will be a much deserved Blu-Ray version! ::laughs::",1296432000,7,1478,4.351449275362318
8356387,5,B0028MFMNS,This movie is so funny I almost died watching it. Don't watch it while your hungry they show a lot of good looking cakes. I had to learn that the hard way.lol This movie is something to watch when you want to get a good laugh with a little drama in it.,1296086400,4,252,3.8653846153846154
8356388,5,B0028MFMNS,"This is such an adorable adaptation of a wonderful manga series. That said, you don't need to know the manga to enjoy it. It's a light film that maintains all the charm one would expect from an anime series while being well acted by a live action cast. The only complaint I have is that whenever I have the money available to purchase the film it's not in stock. I'm holding out hope that at some point Amazon will carry it, so customers don't have to worry so much about the vagaries of the distributor.",1271116800,3,504,4.315789473684211
8356389,5,B0028MFMNS,Antique the movie is one of the best korean films I have ever had the pleasure to watch. It follows it's japanese manga plotline to the letter. The acting is fun and playful. It is a very enjoyable movie to watch if you don't mind BL(boylove) and it's very light boylove. Nothing serious happens between the boys(to my enternal sadness) It is a very fun movie though. You can't help but laugh through most of the movie. It's that good. I recommend this movie and give it the full five stars. It deserves it! XD,1253232000,15,510,4.378947368421053
