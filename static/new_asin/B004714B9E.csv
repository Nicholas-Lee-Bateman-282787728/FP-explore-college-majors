4273028,5,B004714B9E,"If you look at most of Jason's DVDs you will see that I have reviewed almost all of them.  A few years ago I started going back to school part time to work on what is going to be an electrical engineering degree.  When looking for supplements to help me get ready for the math classes I found Jason's Algebra Tutor DVDs and continued to get them as I progressed through the classes.  I have found them all to be extremely useful.  I have worked my way through the entire calculus curriculum and am currently in the second semester of calculus based physics.  These have helped me maintain a 4.0 GPA since going back to school.

What I love about Jason's material is he starts from square 1, assuming you have no background in the material he is presenting and walks you through step by step.  As he has refined his DVDs he is now setting them up so you get a lecture in one section then multiple problems in the corresponding sections.  He only assumes that you know what you need to in order to be at that level (i.e. you need to know algebra to be taking calculus) but even then he walks you through every step and breaks things down so you can easily follow the process.  His examples go from very easy to more complex.  I have found that in many of his DVDs he does not do the hardest problems you may encounter in your homework, but he does give you examples that are more likely to show up as quiz or exam problems (due to time limitations in those environments).

I have not taken circuits class yet, but I got this because of the introduction to circuits that you get in the electricity chapters in the second semester of physics.  In Jason's physics 3 tutor DVD he does discuss capacitance and circuit problems involving capacitors, but he did not go into problems involving resistors and Kirchhoff's rules.  That is what this DVD covers, so I got this to supplement that set (and because I will have to take circuit analysis next year).  My physics instructor is not the greatest lecturer ever and while he does show a lot of problems, he does not always explain the concepts well.  I can always follow how Jason breaks down the problems and after watching this DVD set, I am confident in tackling any of those types of problems.  Depending on your physics class you may not need the material on this DVD, but chances are if you are taking calculus based physics you will.  When Jason was putting the physics DVDs together he had to omit some material for time and this happened to be one of those that he cut out.

I will have a better idea next year of just how much of the circuits curriculum this covers.  That I cannot tell you.  My guess from what he describes in the DVD is that it is about 1/4 to 1/3 of the first semester of circuits.  If it is like the math and physics DVDs he put out then the problems may not be the hardest, but will teach you the material you need to tackle the hardest problems you may need to do in your homework.  For what you will get in physics II however it is more than sufficient.  It is far better than trying to read it from the book, and may explain it better than your teacher.  At the very least it will give you a step-by-step approach to solving the problems.  If you use this as a supplement as is intended and you can learn from watching a DVD as opposed to direct interaction with a tutor or teacher this will help you.",1363046400,5,3378,4.298578199052133
4273029,5,B004714B9E,Jason is very thourough in his presentation of the material.  Very easy to understand.  I will be purchasing more of his chemistry tutors in the near future.  I had College chemistry in 1957.  Being in Retail consulting I never had the opportunity to follow up with my knowledge at the time.  I am surprised both on how much it has changed and how much I never really learned.  Thank you Jason for a well presented concept of chemistry.,1355443200,,436,4.5256410256410255
4273030,5,B004714B9E,"The Chemistry 1 Tutor is outstanding!

The teacher is so clear, so organized, and so smart, that this old dog learned some new chemistry tricks after just forty minutes or so.

The classes are divided up into logical sections, and each class is given a great deal of attention.
Watching them actually makes chemistry enjoyable.
No kidding.",1354752000,,339,4.9298245614035086
4273031,5,B004714B9E,"Wow this guy is incredible. After struggling with chemistry and math throughout my education I came across Mr Gibson's Dvds and they honestly changed my life. His way of explaining concepts is outstanding. I can honestly say that he's the best math/science teacher I've ever seen. I've lost count of the times that I have stood in amazement after one of his lectures. I sit there and think, ""I finally get it, after all these years.""

He not only gives the best foundational understanding of chemistry but also works problems that you'll see on your homework/tests. He works out the math step by step with great clarity. If you're planning on taking chemistry in High School or at College these will give you an advantage over the rest of the students. The most difficult thing about chemistry is understanding the concepts which he thoroughly covers and also working the problems. In here he will also give you advice on mastering other subjects in science such as physics.

I will be purchasing more of Jason's Dvds in the future.",1344297600,4,1032,4.792134831460674

I bought this Tutor CD package after hiring a new Engineer and finding that she was heavy on Digital Theory but very weak on basic electronics and she needs to pass her General Radio Telephone License (FCC)as part of her employment. This first Volume covers Basic electricity. The very basic,Sect 1: Voltage, Current, and Resistance and progress threw and ends with Sect 20: Current Divider Circuits. Progression threw appears logical of what I can remember of school(30+ years ago). The CD claims it takes 10 hours to go threw the whole 3 disks. I'm not sure how much time a day they want you to spend a day working on each section. However I'd work at my own pace. You can read in the Product Description the details what the CD's will try to teach you. I'll come back with an update after We've gone threw  all 3 CD's.",1341187200,2,1067,5.54601226993865
4273033,5,B004714B9E,"Excellent instructor, incredibly clear, to the point.  I took chemistry years ago in college.  I hated it for all the time I invested and the poor grades I got on a subject that made little sense to me.  Honestly in two hours listening to Mr Gibson I learned more than several semesters at school.  For the first time I saw it clearly through perfect and easy explanations.",1333843200,2,373,4.522388059701493
4273034,5,B004714B9E,"I bought this to accompany an online course with a community college after being out of school for a number of years.  I have to say I am rustier than I want to admit, and this DVD is saving my butt.  I am impressed, and thankful for the hard work and effort put into this series. I have already bought Mental Math, Fractions through Algebra, and will go on to get the College Algebra course before I begin it this summer.  Unlike some reviewers, I actually preferred that he use the whiteboard because I could take notes along with the video if I wanted to. It's better than the classroom, cutting to the chase without leaving out important details.  You won't be sorry if you need help and purchase this set.",1330473600,4,710,4.396946564885496
4273035,5,B004714B9E,"He's excellent. He's easy to understand if you have no clue about chemistry, and really starts at the start. I heard some people complaining because he has some spellings issues... I could care less about misspellings when I'm scrambling to get through a criminal justice/forensic science class with NO chemistry background. He's helping me succeed and I'll be back for other videos. This is great if you have NO background and quickly need to get up to speed, or use it along with a chemistry class you're struggling with, he can help. Thanks!

Edited to add: After using this dvd for a few weeks, I'm thrilled. I just got a perfect score on my chemistry test which is a miracle. I only got this score because of this dvd. And better yet, I really understand it so I can use the concepts and not just hope for the best. I just watched again the 45 min or so segment on significant figures. For example, my textbook has one page, and 45 min was a wonderful in- depth look at this topic that really helped me. It's a great dvd, thanks again!",1328140800,7,1040,4.445026178010472
4273036,5,B004714B9E,"After 25 years since my first undergraduate chemistry course, I felt due for a refresher on the basics.  I found The Chemistry 1 Tutor DVD course material and presentation to be of excellent quality, and fully meant and exceeded my expectation. This science course passes the litmus test, and is well worth the small investment.  I especially enjoyed the material on Atomic Theory of Matter, and on the detailed graphic description of the Periodic Table. Jason's excellent teaching manner brought the science of chemistry alive while presenting the material in a challenging and easy to grasp fashion.

All in all, I rate this introductory chemistry course highly, and recommend it as a supplement to any first high-school or college level general chemistry course.",1287964800,13,765,5.203252032520325
4273047,3,B004714B9E,I purchased this DVD for my Milady Esthetics class to help with the teaching of chemistry  as some stuff is helpful this is very deep teaching so it did help and a little more deep than so if thats what you are looking for yes its great!!!,1398470400,,239,4.085106382978723
4273048,3,B004714B9E,"I was really hoping for interesting graphics, even possibly some animation and illustration of the concepts. This DVD can be helpful, especially since my son's teacher is apparently not teaching the subject matter, but it is a lecture format, which is not very engaging for a 15 yr old boy. I'm rusty on my chemistry concepts so I found this helpful to at least explain the concepts coherently, but I would love to find a program that has more interest for adolescents, and keeps adults watching too. Can someone please create a great chemistry and biology teaching tool.....with graphics, cartoons, fun.......Come on, this stuff is great, but kind of dry.",1388188800,2,656,4.972727272727273
4273049,5,B004714B9E,I purchased these DVD's for a chemistry class my daughter is taking for nursing. She has learned more from these DVD's than she did in her class. It makes sense to her! I recommend getting all four DVD's to finish the course. Jason Gibson is a great instructor and makes it easy to comprehend material being learned. VERY PLEASED!,1387497600,,330,4.610169491525424

4273051,3,B004714B9E,"This first volume of the Chemistry Tutor is really extremely basic. It mostly goes over how matter is composed, the basics of the elements and the periodic table, what an atom is, what an ion is.. and in a very elementary fashion. An orbital model of the atom is assumed, and no reference to Quantum Mechanics is made, which puts this exposition at the level of a mediocre high school. Also, you can tell that chemistry is not Jason ""native language"". Don't get me wrong, he knows his stuff, but there's a difference between ""knowing the stuff"" and ""breathing it"", especially in terms of communicating enthusiasm for the subject and a true understanding of the ""nature, essence and purpose"" of the subject. Presentation style is ""through problems"" and ""practically oriented"" as in all of his other titles, but sometimes ""too practically oriented"". For the example the ""criss cross trick"" he presents to determine the relative quantity of atoms in a ionic compound  without thinking is cute, but as for any technique that discourages thinking, should be presented as a check ,not as your primary way of proceeding...
In the end, this title could be useful if you' re a struggling high-school student, or if for some reason you have decided to start your chemistry education from scratch again... but in any case do yourself a favour and accompany this course with a more ""theory oriented"" one like the many ones you can find on youtube offered by american universities, for example the chemistry 1A from Berkeley:

4273055,5,B004714B9E,"Very good teacher/professor. Knows a lot, and knows how to explain. That is a rarity in the teaching world to get both. Very good. This tutor DVD will go along great with your class lectures and readings. The dvd course leaves out a few topics like valence electrons and drawing covalent bonds. But it helped alot overall.",1366675200,2,322,4.666666666666667
4273056,5,B004714B9E,"I am a huge believer in Jason's DVD sets.  I stumbled across them a few years ago when looking for math supplements because I was returning to school after 12 years to get an engineering degree.  With the aid of his DVDs I have made it through all levels of calculus and a semester and a half of physics with a 4.0 GPA.  I will be taking general chemistry next year and have started using this to get a jump on the concepts.

While the production style of Jason's DVDs have increased greatly (the first couple he put out was just his hand in front of a white board, and now he has an entire studio he films in) his teaching style has remained the same.  He assumes you know little to nothing about the actual subject.  Just that you have enough math knowledge to be taking the class, and works through the concepts breaking things down step by step.

What I love about his style is that he gives a bare bones lecture.  He explains the subject without a lot of proofs or deriving of the formulas.  Then he goes through several example problems, and goes through them step by step, so that you can follow the thought process.  Which, as anyone who has taken a math or science class can tell you, knowing what to use and the process of how to use it are the most important things.  He does a lot more spoon feeding than your professor is likely to, and far more than the book ever will.

Some things to keep in mind.  This is a supplement to, not a replacement for, going to class and doing homework.  Even if you get all 4 volumes of his chemistry set, it is not likely going to cover all of what you are going to be exposed to in class.  Given that chemistry books can be the size of a small phone book it is impossible to cram everything in to one set.  That is why he has been putting out multiple volumes since he has started making DVDs full time, but he still has to leave some out.  The material in this volume will cover much of what you will get in regular high school chemistry (about 5 or 6 chapters) or the very basic chemistry class in college (the one that essentially crams a year of high school chemistry into one semester).  If you are taking the class that is usually called General Chemistry in college(AP Chemistry in High school) however, this material will be covered early on almost in a review like fashion in the first couple chapters of the book.

Jason picks the concepts that he feels are the most important ones to cover.  I have noticed that many times the problems he works are similar to what is asked on quizzes or tests, but not the only things that get asked.  Similarly, he tends to show a range of problems from very easy, to moderately difficult.  He usually does not show the hardest kinds of problems.  So be aware that you may get homework problems, and sometimes even test problems more complex than what he shows here.  But if you follow the strategies he gives for solving the problems you can usually figure out what to do one the harder ones.

The other thing I really like about these DVDs is that Jason follows the progression of the course.  Yes you can find lots of examples all over the internet of people doing problems, and I even look for those kinds of things when I am stuck on a problem if it is a type that Jason does not cover.  But what Jason gives you here is like the pared down lecture you would get in class in the order you will see the material presented.  You can think of it as almost like a review day kind of lecture that you can watch over and over again.  You do not have to go hunting for the material to learn it initially.  It is easy to hunt for sample problems when you know what you are looking for, but another thing to find good explanations of the concepts which I think is important to have before you do problems.

Ultimately whether you are going to find these useful will depend on your learning style.  No you cannot interact and ask questions as you can in class or with a tutor, but you can watch the material as many times as you want until you get it.  If you can learn from a video lecture, and use it wisely, it will absolutely help you understand the material and get better grades.",1365811200,,4173,4.25507614213198

I am blown away! A professor will usually lecture to a certain level of implied knowledge, I didn't have that knowledge. This series will teach you the ""stuff"" that leads up to college level chemistry, the material you need for the class, and beyond what you need for the chemistry class. The 3rd part of the material is actually the most important because with you have a question on an exam that you have to ""walk it through,"" you will have the confidence to solve it. SO you will score well on your exams. You can't memorize your way through chemistry, you have to grasp the material so you can problem solve. This is the best volume of DVD's I have ever purchased.

I got this as a brush-up course b/c I teach students who have learning disabilities in high school, and chemistry is not my strongest subject.  I wanted to be much better at it.  This course does it.  The only complaint that I have is that in the section on scientific notation, Gibson does not mention that the number that is to be converted into scientific notation must equal a number from or equal to 1 up to  or less than 10.  This is a very important point, an essential one when teaching scientific notation and explains where the decimal point is moved and why it isn't moved to a different spot in the number.  Aside from that, this is a very concise review on chemistry.  I would definitely recommend it to students who have the self-discipline to sit down and take the course.  The best part of the course is getting through unit conversions.
