1087960,5,6305871116,"What an exceptional opera recording... I will mention quickly the solid orchestra, a very capable director, magnificent costumes, the beautifully though classically designed set and the efficient stage direction that allows singers to focus on their performance without giving the impression that they are lost on the stage...to focus on the amazing cast of singers.
Pendatchanska is superb in the appropriation of the role. the voice is wonderfully trained over its entire range. What amazes me is the way she colors it to express such violent and diverse emotions all along her performance. She incarnates Elisabeth and her conflicting torments, rage and despair by giving her voice an almost aggressive and edgy color which can even sound even disturbing for some 'over-sensitive' ears while managing to abide by all rules and standards of Bel Canto, by keeping her singing line composed and secure and her vibrato even throughout her vocal range...with truly amazing high notes... This being said, she really uses her instrument at 200% of its capacity...I am therefore wondering if this is a wise approach on a longer term. Let's enjoy the moment...
Giuseppe Sabbatini...God, what an amazing tenor... a beautiful 'light' lyrico-spinto di agilita... I mean by that he has the spinto color and focus, extraordinary projection, stunning high notes, voice flexibility - including outstanding piani/ssimi - matching all demands of the role's high tessitura...who else currently has such an easy, free, ringing full 'chest'-voice high D natural???... His musicianship is simply phenomenal...no flaw in his technique...a very clever and sensitive interpreter... His aria+cabaletta scene in jail is a moment of pure vocal grace.
Hearing his 'Nottingham', I understand why the baryton, Roberto Servile was 'sponsored' by Pavarotti. He is a charming, 'techniquewise' flawless singer of the traditional Italian school of singing with a warm lyrical baryton voice... He does not have a very varied palet of vocal colors to express but he delivers a solid performance. His acting skills - like Pavarotti to some extents :)- are average but sufficient enough here in this context.
Ildiko Komlosi interprets a charming although sometimes unidimensional Sara with her delightful voice. She, like the other interpreters, also has the 'physique' of the role which contributes to the interest of her performance vocally very satisfactory.
One negative remark though... Who gave valium to the audience prior to this performance...the 'polite and conventional' reaction to such a stunning performance at the curtain's fall is to me ridiculous... I dream of watching such opera performances every night...
This DVD is a must-buy/watch/keep/rewatch and recommend...",1032307200,,2747,5.511848341232228
1087961,5,6305871116,"I have been a fan of Pendatchanska for a while ever since I heard her sing on a Sony recording of Prince Igor sometime ago. A few years after that recording was released, she did an aria collection on the Capricio (?) lable. I was very impressed with her and wondered what happened to her career.
Nothing and I mean nothing prepared me for her performance as Elizabeth. It truly knocked my socks and shoes off (not to mention other articles of clothing)!
Pendatchanska truly gives the most exciting performance I have ever seen in an opera. I own many DVDs, Laser Discs and videos of opera performances; they all pale to this.
I truly believe that Callas, in her short prime, could not have done this role any better. (By the way, I consider myself a ""Callas Orphan"".)
If you really want to hear and see an Opera performed in a most exciting manner, buy this disc!
The only fault I have is with the audiance that this performance was taped in front of.  Are they dead or on serious heavy drugs? If this had been done in front of a Met audiance the screaming, cheering and bravos would have never ceased--the audiance would have tore the roof off of the place!",1029888000,,1159,4.44131455399061
1087962,5,6305871116,"Excellent singing, staging, acting,sound and visual quality!---------what else do we need ? It's a real treat for this rarely performed, extremely taxing opera. Too bad Carrera and Caballe's performance is only available in the blurry VHS format. It's a shame Dame Joan Sutherland has never tackled this role. However Edita Gruberova has been performing in this opera a lot in Europe lately-------- I wonder if any of her performances was taped.",994896000,,445,5.28169014084507
1087963,5,6305871116,"The other reviewers of this DVD are very positive and I count myself among them. I was jumping out of my seat after a few minutes after starting to watch this. I am not going to go into a detailed description of it, because I feel that all the superlatives one can muster up in appreciation of this DVD cannot do it justice. I should mention that Pendatchanska does not have a 'beautiful' voice - what she does have is a thorough knowledge of characterisation and the proper attack and complete understanding of what Donizetti's Elisabetta is about - she does NOT disappoint. So if you expect the watered-down twitterings of a Gruberova or Sutherland, steer clear - this is a Sturm und Drang interpretation that few can equal: from the ringing acuti to the wispy filati to the chested declamations that can summon a  graveyard to life.
Although the supporting cast sing with conviction and truly beautifully well-supported voices, I feel that they do not quite reach Pendatchanska's dramatic commitment. Komlosi as the Sara is a sympathetic performer who should deserve more acclaim. Sabatini as Roberto looks and sounds the part, and then some more. Servile as the Duke also has a superb voice. Every aspect of this production has been lovingly thought about: costumes, staging and camera work are breathtaking - thumbs up to all those involved! The orchestra plays very thoughtfully and the conductor seems to be most interested and concerned with the singers needs. The indolence of the audience beats me. This production makes one want to see more opera - regardless of the composer or period. If you are interested in similar committed, thoughtful productions do give the ENO 'Xerxes', Pappano 'Don Carlos' and Covent Garden 'Mitridate' also available on DVD a go.",987465600,,1769,4.936241610738255
1087964,5,6305871116,"Roberto Devereux is considered by some authorities the finest of Donizetti's tragic operas (I think that's a bit of a stretch - there is  still Lucia, with more imaginative melodic invention). This is a very fine  performance from the Teatro di San Carlo , where it was first staged in  1837 and first revived (with the Turkish diva Leyla Gencer - available on  Opera Doro) in 1964.
This may be a dress rehearsal since the auditorium  is half empty (the premiere was on May 28 1998). Even though it means that  there is less give and take with a responsive audience, the singers seem to  benefit from the less oppressive presence of the Neapolitan operatic mob.  There are no signs of anxiety, everyone warms up to their roles from the  first note. Everyone, including the conductor and orchestra are in top  shape and give their very best.  (Old European opera houses are infested  with gangs of homicidal tradition keepers: if a singer as much as misses  one note, the conductor stops the performance, conducts a hasty requiem  mass and the wretched singer is dispatched to his creator with a short,  sharp shock, from a cheap and chippy chopper on a big black block. These  frequent executions are part of an East European conspiracy to take over  the opera houses of Europe, since they sustain the need for a constant  supply of fresh talent from the east bloc).
The camera crew takes  advantage of the higher freedom of movement with sweeping movements that  cover the orchestra pit (and occasionally the stage) almost side to side,  with a very dynamic effect. This is the best camera work I've seen in any  ""live"" opera production on a DVD so far (although it's not unusual on  rock/pop videos). The picture quality is excellent, with vivid colors and  well defined picture. The 5.1 Dolby surround sound is the best audio so far  on any opera DVD: very focused, with a pleasing feel of ""air"" around the  voices, that carries this hollowed auditorium's sonic signature.
Bulgarian soprano Alexandrina Pendatchanska won the 1990 UNISA  international singing competition in South Africa. She is Ghena Dimitrova's  student and protge, who is reported to have said on Bulgarian television  that her student has a truly remarkable talent. A talent indeed she is. In  the lyrical passages she has that young girl sound of the old Italian  school - light, agile and plaintive. When she digs the spurs in the voice  becomes strong and full, almost metallic and quite thrilling. Her superb  Elisabetta is musically and dramatically almost overwhelming. She tears  into the final scene with ferocity and real pathos. Her voice is expressing  both strength and vulnerability in every phrase and the queen's physical  decadence is laid devastatingly bare - an unforgettable  performance.
Giuseppe Sabbatini in the title role has a such a  charismatic stage presence that it is little wonder that the queen almost  loses her mind over him. His  Devereux is the impetuous heart breaker as  well as proudly aristocratic. He is a real artist and stylist and seems to  be very well versed in 19th century stylistic practice. His medium-weight  voice enables him to bring out the qualities of a bel canto tenor, as well  as to project a more dramatic presence.
(The historic Devereux, the 2nd  earl of Essex was executed after he tried to organize a revolt against  Elisabeth - nothing to do with a love triangle. He constantly provoked her  - she put up with his impudence for years because he was her cousin. But  she gradually grew alarmed of his behavior, finding him to be ""a  nature not to be ruled."" During one of their disputes, Essex turned  his back upon the queen, who promptly slapped his face. He organized the  revolt after she confined him to house arrest, following an unsuccessful  campaign in Ireland.)
Italian lyric baritone Roberto Servile has a real  personality and a wonderful voice. It is quite rare to hear such perfect  diction and precise phrasing even from an Italian singer. I found his  performance the most satisfying of this cast because of his unusual respect  for the text, combined with his lyrical timbre and big voice that fills the  auditorium with no hint of strain. His Duke is very convincing in his  transformation from the loyal friend to the wronged, raging and vindictive  husband. Hungarian soprano Ildik Komlsi as his consort is more restrained  than Pendatchanska in her singing and acting and thereby provides a  musical-dramatic counterpoint. She sings Octavian on the Palermo Der  Rosenkavalier DVD that is due to appear later this month.
The success of  the performance owes much to the sensitive conducting of Alain Guingal that  sustains and inspires the singers rather than drowning them.
The costumes  and sets are gorgeous - all the elements of this production fit in  perfectly and are very well thought out, from Komlsi's sad demeanor in the  opening scene to the blazing red of  Sabatini's costume.
Roberto  Devereux  is scheduled to open this season at the NYC Opera with Lauren  Flanigan as Elisabetta.",965174400,,5051,4.901658767772512
1087965,5,6305871116,"First the nit-picking: This is not the Sills performance that one reviewer properly raves about, and the performer is Robert Servile, baritone, not ""Roberto Donizetti"". This is is a performance by the San Carlo  Carlo Theatre in Naples of one of Donizetti""s most memorable works.  While the composer is best remembered for ""Lucia di Lammermoor""  and L'Elisir d'Amore"", he composed many, many operas, some of which  are wonderful, and some of which are less so. ""Roberto"" was  composed in 1837, at a time when the composer lost both his wife and third  child, but there is no sense of the morbid here. Rather, ther is a wealth  of memorable and exciting melodies, one following another, from beginning  to end. And it is a consistantly well-sung work as well. Wait until you  experience the colaratura singing of Alexandrina Pendatchanska as Elizabeth  I; she is simply stunning! And so is the rest of the cast, especially  Giuseppe Sabatini in the vocally demanding title role. Maestro Guingal  conducts this energetic score with appropriate verve, although with an open  mouth, from time to time. Of course the DVD format continues to portray all  of the visual aspects of musical theatre at their best, this time with  stunning Dolby 5.1 sound, which matches the great staging of this work. Go  for it, and be prepared for opera at its best! And discover just how great  a talent Donizetti possessed. PS: many of his other works are available on  CD from Opera Rara.",963705600,,1468,4.874493927125506
7897679,5,6305871116,"Warning this DVD according to Image is a widescreen picture, if so it is not enhanced for widescreen TV. I have four settings on my projector and the only position to get the right proportions was 4:3,as in old movies. I have a position on the projector labeled Native which is the mode in which the film is recorded, the result is a non-enhanced widescreen TV picture. In other words, the picture is distorted. The video is VHS quality. The sound is excellent. I have over 2,000 discs in my collection including 3D, Blue Ray and DVD so I have some experience in judging the picture. This one surely is a candidate for Blue Ray.
The five stars are for the performance and staging. The singing is fantastic. The singer portraying Elizabeth must have seen the old movie Elizabeth and Essex starring Bette Davis, she acts just like Bette. In fact all the singers are terrific.
The audience are the most luke-warm group and stingy with their applause I have ever encountered on DVD. They must be spoiled. If this fabulous performance had been put on at the Met the audience would have gone wild. A truly great DVD.",1413244800,,1110,4.582914572864322
7897680,5,6305871116,"This DVD is very rare. It is a - visually and vocally - stunning production from Napoli's ""Teatro San Carlo"" and it leaves, for the true Donizetti lover, very little to be desired.
As one reviewer mentions, the audience seems to be ""sitting on their hands"" but this might be explained by another reviewer's remark that it is probably the dress rehearsal. Actually, this should have been met with accolades of approval otherwise. The justly famous singers give great interpretations and the stage settings are magnificent. No need to praise each singer individually. If you love Donizetti, this is a must have. Get it as long as it is available at reasonable prices.",1282435200,,665,4.893805309734513
7897681,5,6305871116,"I now have two Roberto Devereux's on DVD, one with Beverley Sills & this one with Alexandrina Pendatchanska. I raved about the Sills recording; but having seen this one, I am gob-smacked. I thought Sills could act! You haven't seen anything till you see Pendatchanska's Elizabetta. It is so life-like, it's scary. To be perfectly honest, I had never heard of this woman until now. I did not know what I was getting, as I did not know any of the cast, so I was apprehensive when I first played this DVD.
All I can say, I was glad no one could see me when it finished as I was clapping and shouting like a fool. I was in tears & could hardly speak as I was so emotional. Never have I seen such a production like this. The staging, cast, costumes, lighting & Orchestra were much more than I expected. Giuseppe Sabatini's Roberto matched Pendatchanska's Elizabetta to a tee. Roberto Serville & Ildiko Komlosi's Nottingham (Duke) & Sara (Duchess) were a perfectly matched husband & wife team. This is just one of those gems you stumble upon once in a life time. I just love this opera and have many recordings of it on LP, CD & DVD and I just happen to see this one and bought it on speck, not knowing what it would be like & got more than I bargained for. So it is unashamedly that I can strongly recommend this version to you over all the others. I'm not usually pushy in my reviews, but this opera has changed that.
The quality of the picture is perfect and you are offered two sound systems; Dolby Stereo & Dolby 5.1 Surround; which brings me to mention a couple of times the singers go off mike, but on the whole the sound is very good.",1190419200,,1636,4.297734627831715
7897682,5,6305871116,"Amazing!
Couldn't imagine modern operatic production could reach such high level.
Elizabeth I and Robert Dudley are well-known historical characters, but Donizetti's opera is less well-known.
With the swerve of Elizabethan mania these days over Helen Mirren's performances for the two Queen Elizabeths, one cannot help but recall this almost 10-year old opera recording.
Too much praise is due to Sabbatini and Pendachanska's singing. I note that some viewers here call her an unknown Russian or European soprano.
Well, she is not famed for beauty (though she in fact has ample share of it), and in this opera she successfully portrays an aged (and ugly) ERI.
I wonder if she would have hitted the headlines then when she starred in a role that shows her beauty off - too much pity that her 2002 La Traviata wasn't recorded on DVD. Wonder if Netrebko would have any chance now had Pendachanska had more luck then.

(Post-script)In any event, time has proven that Pendatchanska's assumption of ERI in this opera has NOT yet been surpassed by modern sopranos.",1170201600,,1057,5.005681818181818
7897683,3,6305871116,"In terms of production splendor, this one is indeed,

spectacular. The most sumptuous sets and costumes are to be

found on this Image Entertainment release of Roberto

Devereux, which originates from the San Carlo Theater in

Naples (there's no performance date listed anywhere on the

box or even in the program; the packaging lists a 1998

copyright). Here, the stage and performers are decked out

in dazzling Elizabethan splendor, not a detail or expense

spared: they are truly of cinematic quality. Elizabeth

herself is outfitted straight out of one of her paintings,

and her throne likewise: we really do get the sense of the

time and place, and, most rewardingly, the richness of the

fabrics and colors complements Donizetti's similarly

textured score.

A particularly fine touch is having Elisabetta begin her

big last act scena in her chambers, decked out in plain

nightclothes, revealing the rather pathetic woman outside

of her royal guise; however, we see her partially

transformed again into the Queen, as her ladies-in-waiting

bewig and dress her expediently for Sara's sudden

appearance onto the scene. All of the care lavished here

makes this a superior production, and showcases Donizetti's

masterful work in the most tributary and deserving way.

  The star of this production is Giuseppe Sabatini in the

title role. The tenor displays an excitingly pingy tone,

 which he uses with real skill and unfailing taste. His

account of Devereux's last act aria, ""Come una spirito

angelico"" is phrased and sung with style and world-class

distinction; Sabatini, unlike Jos Carreras (who foolishly

moved on to heavier roles, with dire results) has not

disdained to make bel canto a specialty career, and having

a tenor of his means in a repertory, where in this

department is usually short-changed, is a revelation - a

welcome extravagance one might add. Furthermore, Sabatini,

tall and dignified of presence, is an accomplished actor;

he moves well, displays a myriad of emotions with

credibility and dignity.

  The Dysfunctional Ones, Nottingham and his wife Sara,

are well taken by Roberto Servile and Ildiko Komlosi. The

baritone, tall, dark and distinguished looking, is an

unsually good actor, as he does a fine job of displaying

his horror at discovering his wife's indiscretions, and the

resulting bitterness and vengeance. Though his big aria,

""Forse in quel cor sensibile"" lacks the last degree in

polish, Servile has at least a more-than-serviceable

instrument, and his combined qualities make for a better

than average Nottingham. Mezzo Ildiko Komlosi as the

troubled Duchess is an exceptionally comely woman, and she

presents an sympathetic, properly anguished portrayal.

  Though her warm, rich voice displays a shining middle

register, aptly ""tear-stained"" for the opening

""All'afflitto e dolce pianto ( whose melody is said to have

inspired Verdi's chorus ""Va, persiero"" from Nabucco), the

voice can spread out in its upper regions (indeed, one

finds it strange that in all three of these releases, the

""seconda donna"", all roles calling for a soprano, are

delegated to mezzo-sopranos).

  Alexandrina Pendatchanska's Elisabetta is the

performance's principal force and conversely the most

controversial element. Certainly the soprano gives an

intense, almost maniacally driven portrayal, and is never

at a loss to convey the Queen's inner torture, desperate

anger, and aching loneliness. This she does by a tireless

display of physical and facial expressions. In addition,

Pendatchanska authoritatively embodies the regal, imperious

side of the monarch, not to mention that of a conversely

jealous, insecure, fiercely impatient woman. The

""homework"" has been done, the motivations and psychology

""worked out,"" and nothing is left to chance...or, chanska

(sorry)?

  There is a grave downside, though. For all of

Pendatchanska's dedicated work, the fact remains, her vocal

technique, or lack thereof, is a serious liability,

especially in this fiendishly difficult music. The voice

itself seems to be produced by sheer determination and

force of will. The few natural notes in the middle of her

range notwithstanding, the soprano's instrument cannot

withstand any pressure at all above the staff, after which

the voice acquires an alarmingly hard, driven, and very

fast vibrato. If she indeed studied with Dimitrova, you can

hear it; they share that same, narrow, driven upper

register. The machine gun analogy or goat bleating,

unfortunately, is all too apt here. After a while, this

incessant countenance becomes very wearisome to the ear.

The placement of the voice is so far back and in the

throat, coloratura passages (which are decorated in their

second verses) have no dexterity, whizzing velocity or

lightness of execution, and the upper notes are painfully

negotiated. It's all forced: the voice never floats. She

cannot sing precise, filigree turns in the higher portions

of her range (as in ""Ah, ritorna qual ti spero""); she

hurries through them nervously. When she sings the second,

variant statement of ""il tradimento orribile la sua

perfidia e certa"" (pg 83 in the vocal score), the rapid,

jagged sequence of notes are blurred. Pendatchanska drops

vowels because the placement is so far back; in the

storming downward-scale expression of rage ""Un perfido,""

she omits the 'f' in the word, so that it becomes ""perido.""

""Vivi ingrato"" has some finely limned singing, but in the

""poco piu"" section of ""Vivi ingrato m'abbandona"" that

should have a great, sweeping downward arch, the top note B

on 'do' is squally, spread, and effortful. The amazing

*maestoso* closing finds Pendatchanska *in extremis*,

pushed to her very limits - giving her all, and sounding

it. The sopracuti that Pendatchanska amazingly

incorporates at the end of the first aria and after the mad

scene, are practically larrupped and flogged into place;

the big preparatory breath and the great physical effort

she exerts makes it appear as is she is readying to upchuck

the notes. The viewer cannot help but feel a strong tinge

of regret at Pedatchanska's deficiency of technique, for

her presence and constantly alert expressiveness are

exactly what this sort of role needs; however, half of the

needed requirements for the role cannot make for a complete

portrayal.

  Alain Guingal, the conductor, leads the orchestra

(occasionally scrappy) with more precision than is usual in

this repertory, imparting a nice Verdian thrust at

climaxes. Sometimes rhythms can be punchy and inelegant

(most notably for the royal, brass-laden flourishes that

signal the Queen's first entrance), but for the most part,

Donizetti's score (with some textual trims here and there)

is treated with care and deference. The wide-ranging sound

quality is superb - theatrical, spacious and brilliant.

 Camerawork is amateurish, despite the quality of picture.

Pivotal moments are missed, inappropriate moments are

zoomed in on, and has no conception of the crucial dramatic

points.",1157673600,,7078,5.324521422060164
7897684,5,6305871116,"My 5-star review is based on the two leads in this production.  While the rest of the cast was adequate, these two lifted it to a high plane of achievement.  Of course, the other star-performer, Donizetti, gets his accolades as ever for his rich and irresistable melodies.

The singing by Pendatchanska and Sabatini was beyond praise.  Both rose to an occasion that I am thrilled to have had captured (since I wasn't in Naples that night).  I cannot understand how one human can sing the queen without being scraped vocally raw by evening's end, but Pendatchanska finished this grueling role with panache and beauty of tone.  Sabatini while not having as much demanded, sang with lyricism and heart -- something I have not always found in abundance in the past with him in live performance.  Perhaps it was just me, because he certainly acquitted himself beautifully here.

This is a treasurable performance and will stay on my ""5-star"" shelf with the very few others that earn that rating from me.",1092441600,,998,4.829411764705882

However, you can add Pendatchanska to the list  of great QE I's - a bigger voice than Sills, not quite the coloratura, but fabulous nevertheless. Since this opera is sparsely represented in the discography, buy it for Pendatchanska - you won't be disappointed. I have to agree with the other reviews I've read - someone must have put narcotics into the air of the opera house - the audience responded to this fabulous singling as though half-dead.
