6256372,4,B00IBIIR4E,"Yes, a story of determination and adversity equals a great plot. I truly admire the little girl and the mother and siblings who supported her in her life long dream of competing at the Olympics. Great performances of all actresses/actors. Her story was told pretty nicely, however, I do believe it could have been better if more of the adversity she faced was shown at a greater extent than what it was. Sometimes, it's hard to tell the whole truth without some feelings being hurt, but it makes the story not altogether faithful in its efforts in showing all of America exactly what all it entailed in actually making it to the Olympics as the beautiful African American young lady that she is. Surely, I applaud the story nonetheless.",1461542400,,736,4.713178294573644

6256387,5,B00IBIIR4E,"Loved this movie and so did 7 yr old daughter. The only part I found unbelievable was the little girls playing Gabby. At one point in the movie you see a girl around 7-8 doing back handsprings in the yard with ZERO gymnastic training supposedly. Some quick googling told me that Gabby started gymnastics lessons at age 3!! That girl could not have been even near 3. Certainly they could have found a 4-5 yr old to play her at 3 with decent gymnastics skills.. heck I see 3 yr olds doing that stuff on instagram (usually have coaches for moms....)!

I wish they had shown more about her father and if he ever reentered her life.

Overall though a great movie and I'm very glad we bought it.",1451779200,,689,4.333333333333333

6256416,1,B00IBIIR4E,"Whoever wrote this should be fired for merely insulting people.  Instead of focusing on the reality of a brilliant gymnast they made this family walk on water, a repeat of Father Knows Best or a Beaver Cleaver household.  Nobody has a family dynamic as portrayed in this movie. I was waiting for the entire family to circle around a campfire holding hands singing kumbaya or burst into Everything Is Coming Up Roses!

I know kids who did not make it like Douglas and the nightmares they went through, the injuries, the failures, the taunting by other team mates, the fighting with the other siblings, etc.  When I watch a bio I want to see the real struggle, the real life of the person not some plastic and candy coated story.  This gymnast accomplished so much and I have no doubt without things that were never mentioned in this movie.

6256439,5,B00IBIIR4E,"For so many reasons I really loved this movie. As an adult, to see such tenacity and commitment from someone so young, really encouraged me. Also, to see the way that God worked through Gabby's life, using her faith, to bring her right to her destiny, was amazing. And when she had no faith, her family's faith stepped in so that they all took part in winning it all. It made me cry! lol And the fact that we, the public, get the opportunity to watch the movie of someone else's victory, if it succeeds and inspires us, then we too share in that victory. Like paying it forward! lol So good. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who has a dream, large or small.
