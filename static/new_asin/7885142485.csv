1143739,5,7885142485,"I purchased the movie to add to my IP Man collection.  The DVD quality is good.  The downside, the subtitles didn't work for any language.

Update 30 Mar 2011.  Changed rating to 5.  I contacted the seller after I wrote the review.  The seller was very responsive to my emails and sent a replacement.  When the replacement arrived, I had the same problem on my Blu Ray player.  I then tried the DVD on my PS3 Blu Ray and PC DVD drive and sub titles worked fine.  I am very satisfied with the movie and plan on purchasing movies from this seller in the future.",1299715200,,559,4.247619047619048
1143740,5,7885142485,This is a great movie!  It was fascinating to watch from beginning to end.  This is Bruce Lee's teacher and learning the background of Mr. Ip was a wonderful journey!!!,1294012800,,168,4.566666666666666
1143741,1,7885142485,I was looking for the English version and I had to read through most of the dialog.  If the English version is available I would interested in purchasing it.,1293580800,3,157,4.413793103448276
1143742,3,7885142485,I thought it would be more translation of what was being said in the movie than a history lesson throughout the entire movie which takes away from the viewing.,1293408000,,159,4.517241379310345
1143743,5,7885142485,"A word of warning should be mentioned that there isn't a good rep on this dvd's quality.  A number of people seem to be getting various versions.  I ordered mine from this posting from the positive ratings and it was also a different dvd.  It had a different cover and no special edition.  It was however good quality in catonese with english subtitles. I was surprised that they actually used production sound for the catonese dialoge.

I was pleasantly surprised with the production quality, acting, and story.  They did an excellent job casting the young Ip Man. I actually enjoyed this movie more than IP MAN (1). I found the story to be more accurate than the 2008 ip man.  Another very cool aspect of the film is that Ip Chun (Ip mans son) plays the role of Leung Bik (a later master of Ip Man). If your fan of the Ip man and wing chun definitely pick it up (but make sure it's a decent version).

*Another word of warning is that it did not play on my older dvd player, it did work on my ps3.",1292025600,10,999,4.276595744680851
1143744,5,7885142485,"I finally found this DVD, after first buying another version that was
horrible. I'm a huge IP MAN fan and really enjoyed it. If you haven't seen
any IP MAN movie, you should watch this one first, than IP MAN 1 and IP MAN
2 since this movie serves as a prequel.",1289952000,28,260,4.019230769230769
1143745,5,7885142485,"While Donnie Yen fans might be disappointed with this movie, IP MAN
and action fans in general will be satisfied. This movie is a prequel
to the other two and was made by a different company. It traces the
early part of Ip's life not covered in the other two films. This DVD
is terrific with a great picture and lots of extras.",1289952000,31,327,4.2063492063492065
1143746,5,7885142485,"For people who don't know, ""IP MAN 3"" really isn't ""IP MAN 3"". The real name is ""IP MAN: THE LEGEND IS BORN"". It does not star Donnie Yen, and was made by a different production company,but shares much of the same cast. It also is basically a PREQUEL to the other two movies. It is necessary to understand the origins and early life of IP MAN. If you are a casual viewer, you probably won't like it as much as the other two movies. However, if you really got into the story, you need to see this movie. This is a great DVD. Fantastic picture and some great special features.",1289952000,57,574,4.18018018018018
1143747,5,7885142485,"This movie answers a lot of unanswered questions if you've already seen IP MAN and IP MAN 2. Sure, the lead actor is not Donnie Yen, but he is the reigning HK martial arts champion in real life, so the fights are good. This is the best way to see this movie on DVD. This DVD has a bunch of special features including a ""Making Of"" documentary, Commentary, Trailer, and Photo Gallery.

Every part of the movie just jumps from one thing to another with no premise or transition that made sense. Mostly all the same actors from Ip Man were used, which I found very weird. But the only good thing was they definitely redeemed themselves with the Donnie Yen version. I want the 99 minutes I wasted watching this movie back...

see real fighters and not just actors who move. Those of us who have been trained in Martial Arts can see through the dancing and appreceiate the real practitioners of the Art. The story line is one that is believeable and not the fanciful mess that pulls down most Kung Fu Movies.

1144288,1,7885142485,Its awful when filmmakers try to cash in on good movies. The cast is different and they have invented a crappy story for Mr. Ip Man youth years. He must be turning inside his grave disgusted with this. If you want the real thing stick with Ip Man and Ip Man 2.,1327536000,2,260,4.019230769230769
1144289,3,7885142485,I hate it when movies plug in different actors in place of the originals and use some of the original actors in as different characters.  Movie was good but does not tie in with parts one and two.  As I have mentioned some of the original actors play different characters making it very confusing.  So I say if you've seen parts one and two watch IPMAN 3 as a stand alone movie and not a continuation.,1327104000,7,401,4.25
1144290,3,7885142485,"As other reviewers have mentioned this is more of a 'background' history lesson film.. there is action in this film, yet compared to the previous films.. not as much.  Still this movie holds a great deal of story and characters to keep you entertain.. is this a must?  I personally HAD to find out how they were going to introduce Bruce Lee.. however this story gets more into detail about ip mans future and still early days.  This is a must if you really want to find out more about the story and if it intrigues you.. is it a let down.. no.. could it have been better .. yes.  Is it worth buying .. for this film I will say yes.. but to give you an idea of how much I want to see this film again.. I've only watched it once.. and it is on the shelf.  Whereas Ip man 1&2 were viewed on several occasions.

And as my title suggests.. the copy I received had no English dub over.",1317081600,,879,4.0813953488372094
1144291,4,7885142485,"This is the prequel to Ip Man and Ip Man 2.  The movie has no english language (Cantonese or Mandarin language)and therefore requires reading subtitles in english which sometimes move a bit fast.  Although the action is very good and portrays a much younger Master Ip, the story is successful.  I really enjoyed this movie.",1314230400,6,323,4.836363636363636
1144292,4,7885142485,"Excellent DVD, after realizing. This DVD was all about the movie and
the personality of the Actors and how they added life to the making
of the movie. I purchased this DVD after seng IP man 1 & 2.  I preferred
seing it in this order. Also, was concerned about not getting a quality
DVD, was happy to get one of good quality.

exciting and loved the fight scenes.  I am a huge fan of

1144294,5,7885142485,"I've already bought this DVD, IP Man The Legend Is Born. (some call it IP Man Zero or even IP Man 3 - that's fine)

I also want to get this version that has English* Audio on it too.

I've looked everywhere but I can't find it, yet!

Did any company make this with English Audio?

*  ...yes yes I know the original language audio of these films with all its nuisances, inflections, meanings, etc, is definitely the best! ...I realize that and there is no debate about that okay :)
Besides that though, I just want to have an English audio version too!
I already have IP Man 1 & 2 in its original Hong Kong versions and languages, excellent, and the Blu Ray versions of 1 & 2 have them in English Audio too which I also have - but, I don't see anyway yet to get IP Man 3 in English yet?",1305590400,,785,4.038709677419355
