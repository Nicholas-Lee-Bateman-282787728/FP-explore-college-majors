3118038,5,B0013MOLQ8,"This video was excellent.  It broke my heart to witness the results of the bright-eyed little boy after being put on medication for the rest of his life.  He stands out because you can see the results of many years of experimentation.  We certainly like to play God, don't we.  The Nazis had nothing on us when it comes to damaging the minds of our young.  Who says that every child given us is supposed to fit into a certain mold.  What if they do daydream, forget instructions, have fits, wiggle...it's our job to train them, not medicate them.  I guess we don't have time.  This, of course, seems much quicker since we must rush off to our important business of the day.  What right have doctors, teachers, or parents for that matter have to alter the entire personality of a person.  I would like to see more of this type of documentation.",1238544000,19,843,4.450980392156863

8252166,4,B0013MOLQ8,"I watched this on PBS when it originally aired and again on Frontline's site.  This is such a sad state of affairs, when the medical profession, the educational system and big pharma steps in to further, or even create, the problems of young children.  Not all children are created equal.  When I was growing up, there were hyperactive and somewhat ""naughty"" kids in class, and they were not thrown on medications.  Most of them grew up and grew out of the behaviors that were considered to be somewhat irritating.  A big problem lies with modern parenting, and I've seen it first-hand through family.  We all want our children to be admirable, perfectly behaved miniature adults, and when we have children who do not meet that criteria, we become frustrated and disappointed.  Children with behavioral issues are a lot of work, and neither parents nor teachers want to do that work.  Society further stymies us from disciplining children.  I'm not talking about beating a child.  I'm talking about a reasonable smack on the buttocks when words don't work; and I'm talking about not going after your school legally when a child is reasonably disciplined (no, I'm not talking about physical punishment); but it does start at home.  One of the things I found really disturbing was watching a woman talk about her child's behaviors and all the medications he's on, one of which she says makes him want to eat continuously.  That's a good time to look at what the child is eating in this video -- GoldFish crackers and a corn dog -- and on the side is a bottle of junk drink.  So she's feeding him all highly processed foods and carbs, which also create brain signals/craving cycles to eat more of the same.  I strongly believe our truly horrific diets, with the addition of instant-gratification environments substituting for real parenting, are two of the biggest contributors to ""problem behaviors.""  I've seen firsthand via a nephew what removal of processed foods can do to change the health and behavior of such a child.  The other huge travesty here is a medical professional diagnosing a child as bipolar within 24 hours of removal from long-term psychotropic medications.  I'd have fired that doctor immediately, and I wish those parents had done so.  This documentary is excellent and portrays the perfect storm of misguided doctors, educators and parents.  Unfortunately, the children pay the highest price.",1488585600,,2414,4.945409429280397
8252167,5,B0013MOLQ8,I bought the dvd because the link to it was no longer available through a class that I was taking.  It  is very informative and I would recommend it for anyone studying psychology or has a child that the schools are pushing to have put on medication.  It is important to make an informed choice and this should help them make that decision.,1426291200,,340,4.365079365079365

8252170,5,B0013MOLQ8,Drugs are destroying kids lives and this video is a great exposure of the drug problem.  Doctors that drug little kids should have their licenses taken away,1371081600,,156,4.777777777777778
8252171,5,B0013MOLQ8,"As a specialist working with foster care children, I used this a training tool for foster parents.  The information is enlightening and makes you really consider medication when advocating for children.  Though I have seen cases were medication is a must due to various issues, this is an eye opening message for sure.  The class as a whole learned a lot from this DVD and it prompted great discussion.",1370908800,,402,4.797101449275362
8252172,3,B0013MOLQ8,"Without trying to be, this is one of the most stomach-churning programs I've watched. It leaves you feeling utterly helpless in the face of enormous scientific and ethical complications. I understand the issues a lot better after watching this 60-minute program, but at the same time ""understanding them better"" just means realizing that there is no simple answer.

P.S. - All Frontline programs are available for free online, including this one. There is a Wikipedia page (""List of Frontline (PBS) episodes"") with links to and brief descriptions of each.",1342310400,6,555,5.235955056179775
8252173,2,B0013MOLQ8,"I'm confused watching this. Is the message that children shouldn't be on medication? If so, then I don't understand why the parents allow children to be medicated! The message I'm getting is that these parents are complaining about how children shouldn't be on medication yet they continue to feed their children 8-9 prescription meds even in the documentary. These children don't have to stay on the meds if it's not working for them or have too many side effects.

Everyone knows medications come with side effects. You don't have to be a doctor to know that.",1308960000,,561,4.84375
8252174,5,B0013MOLQ8,"Frontline presents a thoughtful and serious look at American society and the challenges of being a child (and a parent). Some reviewers want to instantly demonize doctors and the pharmaceutical industry. Sure, they have a major role here, but that is certainly not the whole story. As this important PBS documentary illustrates, the issues are many and interwoven.

First, we have a society that has become commoditized... got an ill, take a pill. Whatever life's issues, there's something we've got to buy to fix it. Second, it is interesting that ""appropriate"" childhood behavior is now defined in such narrow terms. If Tommy or Suzy is fidgety, rambunctious, or not focused 100% on the programmed activities teacher is required to present, then a clinical issue is assumed to exist. Third, where are the traditional outlets for kid's energy? Today, kids rarely play outdoors and schools offer few playtime activities or sports. Finally, if more parents were home and available to interact with their children, then assessing and perhaps intervening in their children's lives would improve. Were these basic conditions of child rearing better met, the perceived need for such medication would diminish dramatically.

As was made clear in this thought-provoking documentary, often, it's the parents who need help -- either education on parenting or some serious psychotherapy. We find ourselves in an era where kids can't be kids, where they have few outlets to express themselves freely, and where society is a bit too quick to reach for a pharmaceutical solution that often becomes a greater problem. Perhaps if our own education placed greater emphasis on courses like biology, chemistry, anatomy, physiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy, art, music, history, and the humanities, we'd better understand childhood and we wouldn't be quite so ignorant and gullible about psychiatric medications. Instead, let's all become computer geeks or get our MBAs and then consume our way to high-technology, self-absorbed, medicated happiness.",1302912000,13,2041,5.455696202531645
8252175,5,B0013MOLQ8,"As a former psychiatric social worker, I can assure you that this episode of Frontline REALLY pushed my buttons! It made my heart ache for those children whose doctors are ""throwing pills at them"" (as one psychiatrist I knew, who shall go nameless, always used to put it) without knowing exactly what the efficacy of those pills are in the childhood population. These pills have been used to help adults with certain disorders including bipolar disorder; but it's not very responsible for doctors to simply prescribe powerful psychiatric medicines for children when there's such a paucity of research findings on their effectiveness in helping children. Yes, doctors want to help children in need; and I could see that most if not all of the children we meet in this film are indeed troubled in one way or another; but without enough research doctors are essentially merely groping in the dark for fast, easy answers as this program illustrates. On top of all this, there's the terrible roller-coaster parents must ride as they try to manage their children's unusual behavior and deal with the unpleasant side-effects of these powerful drugs; and that's very disturbing.

Frontline shows people on both sides of the fence; we meet one doctor who we see in session with the parents of a troubled boy who, at the age of six or seven at the most, has multiple psychiatric diagnoses and several prescription drugs to take each day--some of the drugs to help him but still more drugs to take away the unpleasant side-effects of the initially prescribed drugs! When the parent rather timidly asked the doctor if there was any other way to treat her son, the doctor confidently replied that the treatment would have to be ""99%"" prescription drugs. There's no way you can tell me that talking with the young boy about his problems would have done any harm whatsoever; it could very possibly have helped him and maybe even reduced his need for some of those drugs given enough time.

Worse yet, Frontline presents footage of parents testifying before Congress that some antidepressant drugs actually caused suicidal ideation and even actual suicides just a few weeks after those drugs were prescribed for their children. Frontline also explores the topic of the inherent conflict of interest when research funding about the efficacy of these drugs comes from the very same companies that manufacture the drugs! Wow.

Believe it or not, I still haven't given it all away. There's a real emotional charge here and the rest of the program is fascinating. We get terrific interview footage with young children, their parents, doctors, researchers and others including social workers that this adds color to this topic.

This episode of Frontline on DVD is practically mandatory viewing for any parent of a child who exhibits behavior that could be indicative of mental illness. People who are studying counseling or other psychiatric treatment techniques with children would also do well to add this film to their collections.",1258675200,5,3013,5.02
