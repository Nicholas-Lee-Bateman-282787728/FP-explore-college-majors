8296326,1,B001E50S8O,"This movie is super weird. I could not get into it. The film seems to be about this guy who is a con artist doing everything to get this girl, who is a dancer, to be the love of his life.  Though their paths cross over and over again, their love never works out.  He is just never going to be good enough for her and she is just too good for him.  They live separate worlds and it's never going to work out.  The movie just drags on and on with very little to tell.  There is nothing thought provoking about this movie.  Useless film.  Waste of time.",1446681600,,550,3.9908256880733943

8296328,4,B001E50S8O,"Though not as thought-provoking or edgy as Huang Jianxin's earlier and apparently out-of-stock movie Dislocation, this film complements Wang Shuo's novels of an anti-hero's sardonic humor and adamant cynicism about China's authoritarian one-party state and its often bombastic rhetoric. Samsara also reveals the underside of the outwardly glittering cities in the way of Deng's economic reforms, with its portrayal of underworld gang activity and violent enforcers as well as con-man rackets. There is also an interesting love interest in the work, though a troubled relationship of a mismatched couple. No saccharine Hollywood ending of happy ever after in this film, which is more honest than that.",1363219200,3,700,5.613207547169812
