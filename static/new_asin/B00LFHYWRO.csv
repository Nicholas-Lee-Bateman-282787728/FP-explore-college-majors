6481827,4,B00LFHYWRO,"Six years ago, the original Mostly Ghostly film was released and it was pretty good. Flash forward six years later and the Mostly Ghostly crew is back with the same characters, but almost an entirely different cast (sans Madison Pettis, who reprised her role as Tara) Unlike the original, the sequel takes on a lighter tone and is less of a spook and more of a laugh if you know what I mean. I don't recall anything scaring me or making me jump, all I remember from watching this is laughing a lot.

Casting is questionable on some levels. Recasting the part of Nicky is what bothered me the most. In the original, Nicky was portrayed by Luke Benward (a white Caucasian male) and in the sequel, he's portrayed by Roshon Fegan (an African-American male). Despite that I enjoyed Roshon's portrayal of Nicky a lot more than Luke's and not to sound racist or anything but I would've thought the filmmakers would make sure that whoever they recast as Nicky would also be a white Caucasian male like Luke Benward. Another thing about the casting is that I found is that almost every single actor in this film is or has starred in a Disney Channel show. Roshon and Bella Thorne were on Shake It Up, Ryan Ochoa was on Pair of Kings, Eric Allan Kramer was on Good Luck Charlie and Calum Worthy is on Austin & Ally. This is making me wonder if R.L. Stine is partnering with Disney to make adaptations of his books because we also can't forget that The Haunting Hour: Don't Think About It also had some Disney actors in it as well (i.e. Emily Osment and Cody Linely from Hannah Montana). Another thing that I had to say is that whoever they cast as Max's mom is freaking annoying. She did not do justice to that part. Bring back Kim Rhodes! Lol!

Aside from its casting and its overuse of slapstick comedy, Mostly Ghostly: Have You Met My Ghoul Friend is a pretty good movie and is great for kids.",1410652800,4,1886,4.432276657060519
6481828,4,B00LFHYWRO,"This is a non-scary Halloween story for the younger crowd...8-11? Max (Ryan Ochoa) is the main character who has come into possession of a magical ring, one that keeps the demon-ghost Phears (Charlie Hewson) in check. Phears plans on getting the ring off Max's finger and lead an army of the undead who will mostly likely want to visit old friends instead of conquering the world.

Max is aided by two teen ghosts and has a love interest in Cammy (Bella Thorne) who ignores him at the beginning of the film.

The film opens with a whimsical sound track and ends like a Bollywood production. Kids will enjoy this film while most adults will find it tolerable. The plot points were a bit confusing and took a lengthy explanation by Phears.  Humor includes slap stick, fart humor, and some puns.

Joan Rivers has an early brief appearance.

For a female lead try ""Girl vs Monster.""",1410652800,6,878,4.638709677419355

years ago when my 20-year-old niece was 9. She has outgrown them, but, at 65... I have only just begun en-

6481836,5,B00LFHYWRO,"Best Halloween movie ever! Cool writing, fantastic acting and great effects. I watched the first film and it's the best. I watched the second film, it has Joan Rivers (who died) on it. Take a little mix with Now You See Me and take a extreme mix with Girl vs. Monster (with a male lead) and put it into some kind of kids' movie. Phears makes its great acting IMO. I watched it on Netflix but the beginning is great and the ending is delightful! I hope you enjoy watching this Halloween film!",1421539200,,491,4.290322580645161
