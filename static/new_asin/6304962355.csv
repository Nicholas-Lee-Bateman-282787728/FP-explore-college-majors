7879665,5,6304962355,"The 50 Greatest Home Runs In Baseball History came out in 1992.  Just a year later Joe Carter hit his World Series-winning home run at Toronto's SkyDome.  That dinger should force a new 50 Greatest Home Runs DVD to be made.  Also, Aaron Boone's walkoff dinger in the 2003 ALCS that sent the Yankees to the World Series, and Magglio Ordonez's walkoff dinger in the 2006 ALCS that sent the Tigers to the World Series.

This VHS tape is entertaining and historic.  Narrated by Mel Allen, you'll see what are considered to be the 50 greatest home runs ever.  The vast majority I agree with.  There are a few that I disagree with, but I understand why they're on this video.  It's to make the video more entertaining and well-rounded.  I'll name three I disagree with:  Duane Kuiper's only career home run, Jimmy Piersall's obnoxious homer, and the Bo Jackson homer where he wanted to call time out.  There are several different categories the home runs fall under, such as tape measure homers, playoff homers, and World Series homers, to name a few.  You'll see Jose Canseco hit it into the third deck at the SkyDome, Reggie Jackson's light transformer shot at Tiger Stadium at the 1971 All-Star Game and his third homer in Game 6 of the 1977 World Series, Jimmy Wynn's out-of-the-stadium shot at Crosley Field in Cincinnati, Bill Mazeroski's World Series-winning homer at Forbes Field in 1960, Kirk Gibson's pinch-hit homer in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series, George Brett's pine tar home run, Henry Aaron's 715th, plus many more milestone home runs such as Mickey Mantle's 500th, Willie Mays' 600th, Ernie Banks' 500th, Mike Schmidt's 500th, plus many more.

All in all, an entertaining video.  I believe it's only available on VHS.  It needs to be re-done and released on DVD.",1287446400,2,1775,4.754901960784314
7879666,5,6304962355,"This VHS tape is a little gem. Like the other reviewer said, all the well-known HR's are on here (Aaron, Bobby Thompson, Maris). Mickey Mantle is also included.

This is a fun tape to just sit back and watch.

I especially enjoyed:

Jimmy Wynn's tape-measure shot in 1967 out of Cincinnati's Crosley Field. Jose Canseco's tape-measure blast into an upper-upper-upper deck of an indoor stadium (I forget which one; they show the fan who caught the ball, and it looks like he's sitting a mile away); Duane Kuiper's only career HR is neat.

Well worth the dollar if you still have a VHS player!",1235174400,,591,4.653846153846154
7879667,5,6304962355,"This one is a favorite of my four-year-old baseball-loving son and me. Although it's quite dated (it came out long before the great Sosa/McGwire homer chase of 1998), it has plenty of treats from the past, including George Brett's pine-tar home run; the surprising extra-inning game-tying homer by relief pitcher Rick Camp that tied a ""wacky, wild, improbable"" game between the Mets and Braves in 1985; the only home run ever hit by Duane Kuiper in his 3,379 major league at-bats; Mike Schmidt's dramatic homer vs. the Expos in the second to last game of the 1980 season that won the division for the Phillies (""What a wild scene here in Montreal!""), and many others.

All the most famous ones (through 1992) are here - Aaron's 715th, Bobby Thomson's 1951 playoff ""shot heard 'round the world"", Roger Maris's 61st, the 500th homers of Schmidt, Banks and Mantle, the 600th of Mays. All with the original announcers. I'll never tire of hearing Russ Hodges yell, ""The Giants win the pennant"" over and over; or of Milo Hamilton's classic call on Aaron's record-breaker. And the master of ceremonies is the legendary announcer Mel Allen, whose voice and humor lends lots of charm. A real winner, this video.",1106697600,2,1202,4.863414634146341
