2125948,4,B0002VEYV8,"It is a delightful package of Lassie tv from the past.  I was a bit disappointed that some of the quality was not up to what it could be---especially the clip with Dinah Shore--the numbers are unexcusable.  But, for Lassie fans, and there are a lot of us, it is an enjoyable time to be had and to be cherished.",1096156800,32,310,4.15
2125949,4,B0002VEYV8,"I was really sorry to see that one of the best Lassie episodes ever, the 5-parter known as ""The Journey,"" was not included here. This is not to be confused with an episode of the same title from the ""Jeff Miller"" (Tommy Rettig) years.

This was the one where ""Timmy Martin"" (Jon Provost) and Lassie end up stranded in the Canadian wilderness courtesy of a hot air balloon gone astray. Along the way Timmy becomes ill, as I recall, and was cared for by an Eskimo or Indian. The cinematography was beautiful, and as a kid I have wonderful memories of the balloon sequences. The series' associate producer, Bonita Granville Wrather, had done special voiceover intros, and special color title and credit sequences were also done for this special episode, I believe. This episode was re-cut for theatrical release as ""Lassie's Great Adventure,"" but was still missing some footage from the TV showing.

Another multi-part episode missing is the 3-part one in which The Martins (Ruth, Paul & Timmy) leave the farm for Australia, and Lassie in the care of their elderly farmer friend, ""Cully Wilson"" (portrayed by the terrific Andy Clyde, who was also ""Hopalong Cassidy""'s original sidekick, as well as ""George McMichael,"" the foil to Walter Brennan's ""Grandpa McCoy"" on TV's ""The Real McCoys""). Cully eventually becomes too ill to care for the collie and so Lassie winds up with her new master, forest ranger Corey Stuart. This transition episode would have been a nice addition to this golden anniversary edition as well.

Another missing element, of which I've never seen any episodes but which I've heard positive things is ""The New Lassie,"" which featured a young Will Estes aka ""Will Nipper"" (now on NBC's ""American Dreams"" as a Vietnam soldier) as Lassie's boy master, as well as the re-appearance of Jon Provost as his ""Uncle Steve"" (in the show it is revealed that was his birth name before The Martins adopted him as ""Timmy"") for a few episodes. This series also re-introduced Tommy Rettig as ""Jeff"" and June Lockhart, as a remarried ""Ruth"" after Paul Martin's death, in single episodes. It's never been re-aired in the U.S. since its syndicated run, to my knowledge, and no episodes on home video have ever been released.

There was also a Lassie tribute special shown back in the 1990s, which would make a nice bonus in a set of this type. That documentary included comments from the then-still-alive Clayton and Rettig, as well as Lockhart and Provost, among other players in the ""Lassie"" series.

I agree with some others' comments here that a release by a major home video company should have state-of-the-art technology in re-mastered prints of episodes, and in this digital age there is just no good excuse for not having the best audio/video possible.

Maybe what's really needed is a Lassie DVD box set, which would include the material on this 50th anniversary DVD set in enhanced format, and could also include the aforementioned omissions, and then some? Still, this golden anniversary DVD, along with the others already released on SonyWonder, is a good start for anyone looking to build a ""Lassie"" TV collection. In the absence of anything, something is always better than nothing.",1095379200,55,3197,4.933085501858736
2125950,2,B0002VEYV8,"Seeing that this was a Sony release, I had high expectations concerning quality. Sadly, I was greatly disappointed.

For starters, the opening credits before each episode do not necessarily reflect the credits ORIGINALLY shown with the episode. A 1968 episode, for example, has an opening scene with a 1974 copyright!!! Given that this is a mainstream release, and not a public domain release, this is pretty unforgiveable!

Secondly, the pictures have obviously not gone through any kind of restoration. The color episodes are particularly rough looking. The black and white are okay, though nothing great.

I might also add that I am disappointed in the small number of later episodes included in the set. (Not near as much as not having the episodes in their original form, however.)",1095120000,30,786,5.125
2125951,5,B0002VEYV8,"I've been looking forward to this box set since I heard about it. LASSIE is my all-time favorite television series. I could have hoped for some other episodes rather than some of the ones they picked out, or, even better, boxed season sets!, but hey, I'll take what I can get, especially since this set has one of my DVD dreams, all three parts of ""Lassie's Odyssey"" (this is the story M.J. Krankka mentions in his review)! This was the best LASSIE story ever done. Oh, a note to M.J.--you should still get the single DVDs you saw here at Amazon...THOSE episodes are not in the box set and they include all four Christmas stories with Timmy, which are wonderful.",1094428800,17,662,4.525
2125952,5,B0002VEYV8,"Finaly A Lassie Box set. I glad I held out from buying the single DVD's that Wal-Mart and Amazon has been selling. I hope my favorite Lassie episode will be in this set,dont remember the name of episode?It was the one where Lassie Got trapped in the back of a Truck,then when Lassie got free from truck,she had to Hike all the way back to the Martins and she had some amazing adventures on her way home and meeting Alan Hale who went on to play the Skiper in Gilligan's Island. That was a great episode well 3 part episode. Hope it's in the set?If not,thats ok. It's still will be a great set to have!",1094256000,12,601,4.189655172413793

2126051,5,B0002VEYV8,"I have the 50th Anniversary TV Collection and it's very nice, but the entire first 4 seasons (containing all 115 episodes with Jeff) would be a lot better for Lassie and Tommy Rettig fans.
Fortunately I recorded most of them on German TV some 20+ years ago and so I can enjoy them still. They are wonderful, even for children nowadays.
It's about time that the first 4 seasons get a release on DVD!!!

PS: I don't remember when I wrote this review. It's September 2012 now and I just checked amazon.com to see if the first season of Lassie is finally out, but of course nothing has been happening. It's so frustrating.
Wish that TVLand would air them. They were on the Canadian TVLand 2 or 3 years ago.",1306627200,6,702,4.4
2126052,4,B0002VEYV8,"Disc 1 contains four ""Jeff"" episodes and four ""Timmy"" episodes.  We see how Jeff became Lassie's owner and he has some gentle adventures with Mom and Gramps (the wonderful Jan Clayton and George Cleveland) and pal Porky.  A sudden death shakes older Jeff (now with a deep voice and no longer in need of the stepstool to reach the telephone) and brings about his departure from the farm - sans Lassie.  The Timmy shows have him coming to the farm, being adopted by one set of parents and then another, and in one bizarre episode, he is visited by none other than the Lone Ranger.  Discs 2 and 3 are all Timmy episodes, a bit too corny for my taste.

Jon Provost (Timmy) looked so much like a ""Precious Moments"" figurine I just couldn't take him seriously and besides, my heart belonged to Tommy Rettig.  I loved him as Jeff and thought the writing on his shows was far superior to the later ones with Timmy.  Jeff was a real farm boy with ordinary boy problems, hopes and dreams, while Timmy was always in danger.

Still, all of the shows reflect an innocent time and make for a sweet trip down memory lane for those who watched the show as a child.",1296172800,3,1148,4.382075471698113

As previous reviews stated, the color episodes' quality was not up to par, but it didn't matter much to me, since I rarely watched Lassie after the Timmy years anyway.

2126102,3,B0002VEYV8,"I had high hopes for this DVD collection and seeing it was created and released by two well known companies (Classic Media & Sony) it should have been better. This collection contains several ""Lassie shows"" starting with ""Jeff's Collie"" in 1954 all the way up to the ""Holden Ranch"" episodes in 1974.
Classic Media & Sony apparently had the blessing of the ""Lassie Organization"" so why couldn't they have acquired the original negatives and struck new prints ??  While the episodes included are watchable, many have visual artifacts (scratches) and a grainy quality. Fresh prints would have been more in order with a release such as a 50th Anniversary DVD collection. For example, every ""Timmy and Lassie"" episode in this collection opens with the 1959 opening, even if it was a 1960 or 1962 episode. Did they think diehard babyboomer fans of this show wouldn't notice ??  Also, the opening of one particular ""Jeff's Collie"" episode, looked very rough. The closing music on many episodes of Jeff's Collie"" had a wavy or unbalanced sound. The color episodes which were the newest and should have looked the best, were of poor quality. Again with mismatched opening titles and actual episode years. They looked to be second or third generation copies...even the older B/W episodes looked better.
It would have been nice if surviving cast members could have done some narration discussing behind the scenes shooting or favorite episodes.
There ARE some good things to say about this DVD collection. The episodes chosen were some of the best. The booklet by Ace Collins describing the Lassie story is very informative and this set is packaged very nicely. The extras such as the recent ""ninja"" Lassie G.E. commercial and other noteable Lassie appearances are fun to watch although again, the quality of some of these clips varies.
This DVD collection had such great potential and although I'm glad I bought it, I expected so much more...Lassie fans deserved it and so did Lassie.",1096761600,115,1974,4.9787878787878785
2126103,1,B0002VEYV8,"If you're a fan of ""Jeff's Collie"" and ""Timmy & Lassie,"" stay away from this DVD collection. Most of the Jeff/Timmy episodes included here were released in single disc sets earlier this year and you may have already purchased them (I did). This is a pretty skimpy collection (20 episodes) when you consider how long each of the Lassie series ran. They need to fast forward to ""Complete First Seasons"" of both Jeff and Timmy.",1096156800,77,424,4.666666666666667

8033029,5,B0002VEYV8,"So sad! I came home, and my dvr had a stroke and took all my wonderful Lassie episodes with it! My favorites were any where Greensleeves was the opening music, or where the only human was Ranger Cory, and Lassie would save baby kittens from the ocean, or baby skunks from a mountain lion, or baby bluebirds from a big ol hawk. You get it, lots of baby animals being save from some bad ass critters. I just saw one where Lassie attacked a feral hog! I actually yelled, Lassie, you're not wearing your Kevlar vest!!!

Anyway, why aren't they releasing all the seasons? Darn dvr  : |",1502668800,4,580,4.361111111111111

These were always one of my favorites as a kid, I was so glad to have my kids enjoy also.",1448409600,,321,4.0
