8571029,5,B00BMU8RTS,"This is a one stop shop for the history of the breed. No guessing, straight from the source. It puts a lot of rumors to rest and teaches the history and how to breed with purpose and direction.  The bully biz is full of secrets, so I thought, but I'm learning it's not secrets it's lack of knowledge dressed up like secrets to hide short comings.  This DVD is a must have. My favorite part is that the man behind the making of it is only a phone call away and ready to talk dogs.  Definite A++",1389052800,,493,4.061855670103093
