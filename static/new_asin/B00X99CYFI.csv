7166805,4,B00X99CYFI,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

When I hear the term Southern gothic, my interest is usually immediately piqued.  Im a Southerner, so that is obviously a big selling pointand gothic usually interprets into horror, so theres the other.  So when I read the press release for THE UNWANTED, I knew I had to give this film a look.  And while its not perfect, the film is a heck of a thriller, and I recommend giving it a chance.

THE UNWANTED is shot well and looks pretty good onscreen.  The video quality is lacking in some areas, although Im not sure if this stems from the camera used or the HD transfer to Blu-ray.  Either way, this is not enough to fully detract from the film, but I do feel it is worth mentioning.

The acting is really good, with Hannah Fierman and Christen Orr portraying the leads.  I am only familiar with Fierman from her chilling performance in V/H/S, however I will state she is a talent to watch for in the future.  Orr, on the other hand, is completely new to me.  I am impressed with her versatile range of emotion, however, and I would wager we will see more of her in the future as well.

The story is where I find a couple of issues.  First it is a slow-moving plot.  The film only clocks in at 96 minutes in length, but it feels like it takes a while for the true story to get moving.  This isn't a huge issue, but again, I feel it worth noting.  Secondly, the story never explains what the women truly are in real life.  Are they witches?  Vampires?  Something else?  Their need or desire for blood is a mystery, and it falls in the background for some reason.

Still, THE UNWANTED is entertaining, and I recommend it.  The film is an interesting look at how people are not necessarily who we think they are, and sometimes the events in our lives have more meaning than we initially perceive.  The film will be available next week, so make a note.",1436140800,4,1922,4.307262569832402
7166806,3,B00X99CYFI,"The Unwanted is a bit uneven, and slow at times, yet satisfactory with solid performances from the two leads (Hannah Fierman and Christen Orr) while the atmosphere provided by writer/director Bret Wood was in keeping with the story's Gothic origins. As another reviewer pointed out, has a bit of everything from sex, violence, romance and mystery.

Reviewing the Blu-ray, unfortunately the audio was pretty bad with low levels on the dialogue while the music was a bit too bombastic but the video transfer wasn't half bad and there's a fair selection of bonus features including a making-of featurette, some deleted scenes and a couple of trailers.",1435276800,5,648,5.113207547169812
7166807,2,B00X99CYFI,"I really wanted to like THE UNWANTED. The actors were all pretty talented and some of them are easily recognizable from other films. For me, the problem I had was the plot. It could've been so much better on so many levels. It was just too mixed-up for me. IF the screenplay had been better, the director and also, the editor, it might have been much better. The talent of the actors was wasted with bad material, in my opinion.",1434931200,3,428,4.3625
7166808,3,B00X99CYFI,Unwanted has a little something for everyone.  The mystery of the drifter's mother is slowly revealed in flashbacks as the father spoon feeds half truths to his daughter to both warn her and soothe her curiosity.  Some sex scenes and violence.  Moved slowly through some parts of the movie but it had good acting and a satisfying story line.,1434758400,6,341,4.745762711864407
8715471,2,B00X99CYFI,"I love Sheridan Le Fanu and the old film of his Uncle Silas with Jean Simmons has long been a favourite of mine.  There have been two subsequent TV versions which I don't think are any where near the same stature as this old 1948 film and there was a TV version of his fine mystery Wylder's Hand which I thought started well but lost footing.  The House by The Churchyard is a wonderful read and among its many attractions is a tale of a ghostly hand which appears as an excerpt in many anthologies of supernatural stories.  .Le Fanu's tales often have a powerful sense of dread which is something he experienced in life as a nightmare of a house crashing in on him.  A story goes that when he died he had such a look of horror on his face that a doctor friend announced that the house had finally fallen in.  But the one work that has attracted several film makers and at least one composer is his almost novella length story Carmilla which first appeared in the collection Through A Glass Darkly.  First filmed by the great Carl Dryer his film Vampyr is not really a transfer of story to screen but rather a distillation of some of Le Fanu's preoccupations; most notably that sense of dread.  For me Vampyr stands out as a masterpiece of film making.  There are several striking images with some startling camera work.  But many of the other films of this story are rather dreary.  Most are an excuse to exploit the vampire/lesbian angle of the story.  Two that I rather like are Roger Vadim's movie released in the US as Blood and Roses with a wonderful score by Jean Podromines and Crypt of the Vampire (also released with two other titles as I recall) with Christopher Lee.  If you can find a wide screen version it has some good camera work.  Unfortunately the only impression Unwanted made on me was that the film makers lost all connection to Carmilla or what they were trying to do with it.  I'd give it a pass but, unfortunately, that is too late for me.",1505606400,,1964,4.404432132963989
8715472,1,B00X99CYFI,This movie had great potential. But it tried way too hard to be a different kind of horror movie. The whole blood fetish thing would have been great in another movie that wasn't implying vampirism. The two main characters had great chemistry but it seemed like they were only together because circumstances pushed them together not because they wanted to be together.,1482019200,,367,4.935483870967742
8715473,4,B00X99CYFI,"Nice take on the Sheridan le Fanu vampyre tale of Carmilla, set as a Southern Gothic tale in modern times. The plot gets a bit muddled which could be from any number of factors, but solid performances from the main cast of characters carries the day here...asks at least as many questions as it answers, but it is good to see Carmilla, the original Western literature vampyre, get her due (Carmilla was published in serial some 26 years prior to Stoker's Dracula, 1872 compared to 1898)...",1470700800,,489,4.6976744186046515
8715474,3,B00X99CYFI,I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it to any horror movie fan. I've enjoyed all of Brett Wood's films so far.,1442102400,,115,4.2727272727272725

8715476,1,B00X99CYFI,"As usual for indie movies, there are positive reviews, most likely written by the film maker's mother, sister, high-school teachers, whomever.
I love a good B movie, in fact I usually prefer them to the 'blockbuster hit of the year' type movie. This, however, is not a B movie. Nor is it a C. It is terribly, terribly bad. It is VERY rare that I don't watch a movie until the end, even the bad ones, but I couldn't make it through this. Life is too short. I won't bother you with a synopsis, as one has been written by the reviewer who blatantly stated ""*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review"". That says it all. HORRIBLE acting, lame plot, and looks like it was filmed with a thrift shop video camera.
You can believe me, or you can believe the film maker's mom; but for the love of God, don't pay $$$ to watch this garbage. It's on Netflix",1438214400,,874,4.2395209580838324
8715477,1,B00X99CYFI,I wish we could vote with negative stars; this film has to be the worst I've ever seen.  Can hardly find words for how bad the acting and writing are.  Didn't finish.  Laughably bad.,1437609600,2,182,4.294117647058823
