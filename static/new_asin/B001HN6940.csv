3630544,4,B001HN6940,"For starters, it seems that everyone I know is shocked when I tell them that this Alice in Wonderland is a sequel of sorts. At the age of 19 and about to be forced into marriage, this is Alice's second trip to Wonderland. I'm glad Tim Burton and his team came up with a new story that still featured all the great characters from the original source material. That's also where the weakest part of the movie lies. The dialogue given to the characters is great, but the script is razor thin. I think if more effort went into this particular aspect, I would have given it five stars.

I saw it in IMAX 3-D and the visuals are as grand and beautiful as you would expect from Burton. It's not quite as eye-popping as Avatar, which was shot completely in IMAX 3-D, whereas, Alice in Wonderland was upconverted (Clash of the Titans is doing the same thing). The music by Danny Elfman is some of his best stuff in recent years and the costumes/makeup are top notch.

Aside from the look of film, the acting also makes it very memorable. There are so many well animated and voice acted characters running around I don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start with those made of flesh and blood. I didn't like Depp's take on Willy Wonka that much, and I'm a big fan of his, but his Mad Hatter is just the right amount of crazy. His voice goes back and forth from having a lisp to sounding like William Wallace from Braveheart. His look is so jarring, you probably wouldn't even know it was him if you somehow dodged all the advertisements before entering the theater. Helena Bonham Carter played the Red Queen brilliantly. I couldn't take my eyes off her giant head. Anne Hathaway really surprised me here (in a good way) with her take on the White Queen and it was nice to see Crispin Glover back on the big screen in a role that suited him. Last, but certainly not least, Mia Wasikowska was absolutely captivating as Alice. The way she talked and her reactions were just what the film needed in it's central role. All the digital animal characters were great, but my favorites were the Cheshire Cat, voice by Stephen Fry, and the March Hare voiced by Paul Whitehouse.

I'm somewhat surprised that the combination of violence and meanness, along with the smoking Blue Caterpillar didn't get this a PG-13 rating. It's not too harsh, but young kids might get a little freaked out.

Overall, Alice in Wonderland looks like a polished jewel, has great acting/voice acting, wonderful music and even manages to get quite a few laughs in the process. If only the simple story didn't let me down in the end, this could have been a classic in the making. Even still, I wouldn't mind Tim Burton taking us on another trip down the rabbit hole in a few years.",1267833600,5,2740,4.474
3630545,4,B001HN6940,"When it comes to Tim Burton, he really LOVES to make us wait for his next movie. No surprise, it's been like that ever since he released 2 movies in the same year in 2005 (Charlie and Corpse Bride). And when I heard he was creating his own vision of Alice in Wonderland, I was really excited. I certainly couldn't wait, it sounded like it was going to be an excellent movie. However, of course, I got pissed when back in MAY 08, I find out that it would be released in 10 months. So I waited patiently, and when I saw it last night, I wasn't disappointing.

Alice in Wonderland currently has a polarized audience reaction going on right now. Either you love it, or you hate it. I was well aware of this when I went to go see it. So that said, I stripped myself of all expectations, left them at the theater door, and just went in ready to take in what the movie was about to give me. And you know what? I wasn't disappointed. Was it Shakespeare-level? No. Was it exactly great? Maybe not, but I REALLY liked it, I have almost nothing (except for a couple boring spots and the ending) to complain about. Therefore, it was enjoyable for me.

13 years after the events that Alice experienced, Alice is 19, and lives with her family. She is being pressured upon to accept an engagement from a man she doesn't like. So at the engagement party, after seeing the rabbit show her that she is very late for her important date, she runs to where the rabbit hole is and falls down it one more time. After struggles to shrink herself, she meets up with everyone she knows once again and is taken to The Mad Hatter, who reveals to her that The Red Queen is terrorizing wonderland once again. She must help The Mad Hatter and the white queen stop the Red Queen from eventually overtaking Wonderland before it's too late.

So in total, that isn't exactly the best plot for a sequel, is it? Well, I didn't think it was, but that didn't prevent me from really loving the movie. The visuals are very gorgeous like we see in the trailer. The CG is well rendered, and in short it looks gorgeous. As for performances, Alice was portrayed very well by Mia Wasikowska. She really did a great job, she really nailed the role big time. Bonham Carter was great as The Red Queen too- she really has come a long way as her role as the junkie Marla in Fight Club. Of course, Depp never fails to entertain, and Alice in Wonderland is proof- his wacky performance as The Mad Hatter is certainly enough to keep your attention. The only performance that wasn't exactly great was Crispin Glover as Knave of Hearts- that may be in part due to his character, but he wasn't bad in the movie, he did quite good. Just he wasn't one of the better performances.

I do have but two complaints- I thought the ending seemed really fanfic-ish, and the movie was slow in a few spots. And also, one more thing- if you're going to see it in 3D, it is really good. I definitely recommend it, as it is well used. That said, I really liked the movie and I can't really see why people are complaining. I guess people need SOMETHING to complain about. So guys, don't be a puppet of the critics, and DON'T let your expectations run away with you. See the movie and decide for yourself.

Oh, and someone please tell me where I can learn some of the hatter's funky dance moves.

IN TOTAL:
Entertainment: 8/10
Violence: 4/10- quite a bit in this movie
Depp: Mad as a Hatter indeed
Gorgeous visuals: A visual feast
Burton: May be getting unoriginal, but not declining in terms of directing

3630546,5,B001HN6940,"In this new Tim Burton version of the Alice in Wonderland story, we follow a grown-up Alice down the proverbial Rabbit Hole and into the world of Wonderland (called Underland in this version).  Alice believes that this place is one that she has created in her dreams.

All of the usual suspects are there to greet her, beginning with the White Rabbit, whom she pursues until she falls down the Rabbit Hole.  As she encounters the growing and shrinking phenomenon, she gathers her wits about her and sets off to explore.

But just prior to these events, we'd seen Alice at a garden party, during which a rather unattractive young man had proposed marriage to her in a gazebo--and in front of all the guests--putting her on the spot.

Like the version with the younger Alice, we see this young woman ""escaping"" from a situation that has made her uncomfortable by falling into a world inhabited by fantasies and quirky characters.

But unlike the earlier versions, this Alice adventure is no harmless escapade, but has many rather frightening creatures who confront her at every turn.

Mia Wasikowska stars as Alice, Anne Hathaway is the White Queen, Helena Bonham Carter is the Red Queen, and Johnny Depp is charming as the Mad Hatter.  If I had to choose a favorite performance, it would be a toss-up between Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.  Mia did a nice job as well.

The plot line is fairy predictable and, except for some variations, follows the original fairly closely.  What sets this movie apart is the fabulous imagery and special effects that seem larger than life and beyond surreal.

I found it an enjoyable movie that didn't seem to drag, despite its two-hour length.

To me, it deserved five stars.",1267747200,10,1717,4.760135135135135
3630547,4,B001HN6940,"Let me get this out of the way first.
And I have a feeling many of you will laugh when you read this.
But....I have never read the original story.
All I knew was some girl named Alice fell down a hole and met a bunch of strange characters and that's about it.
Honestly?
I think that gave me an advantage to actually watch the film without expecting things to go a certain way.
I know a lot of critics are saying this version is too much like ""Lord of the Rings"".
I can't say if that's accurate or not but the ending hardly reminded me of anything out of ""Lord of the Rings"".
I was scared, I mean REALLY scared that Burton, even with Depp and the rest of the cast wouldn't be able to pull this off.
I was scared right in the beginning that the film would rapidly dissolve into something so bad and so corny it would be painful to watch.
It didn't.
In a sea of weird movies, this one has to be Burton's crowing jewel of weirdness.
If you thought ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was weird, you haven't seen ANYTHING.
This movie ups the weirdness factor by 100.
Is that a good thing?
It depends.....
Did you like ""Charlie""? If the answer is yes, than you'll probably like this.
I liked ""Charlie"" but I though this was a hundred times weirder and better.

Ok....""Alice in Wonderland"".
What was good?
Masterfull acting from Depp, Carter, and Hathaway.
Burton's most visually stunning movie ever.
Great score.
The film was paced well and wasn't a second too long or too short.
I know a lot of people were worried that the CGI would ruin the movie. It didn't, it blends seamlessly with the human actors into a film quite like no other. Some may say Avatar, but I haven't seen that yet so I really can't compare.

What was bad?
There really wasn't a whole lot of story to be had here.
It had A story just not a very deep one.
What little story was there was good and it wrapped up very nicely.
I'm knocking one star off due to lack of a more in depth story.
But considering I never knew what the original story was to begin with I really can't complain.

Let's sum it up.
Burton's most visually stunning film ever.
The entire cast is amazingly good.
Everything is perfect in every way except the story could have used a little more work.
I saw the movie in 2D not 3D but I loved the 2D version. I may or may not go see it again in 3D but I'm anxious to read what others say about the 3D version.
All in all,
""Alice in Wonderland"" comes....
Highly Recommended!!!",1267747200,9,2456,4.243589743589744
3630548,4,B001HN6940,"It was only a matter of time before a director as visually inclined as Tim Burton would latch onto ""Alice in Wonderland,"" quite possibly one of the most vivid and stirring fairy tales of the last century and a half. Indeed, it has given Burton whole new vistas to explore; never before has his imagination been so fully realized, so finely detailed, so delightfully eccentric. In some ways, he has been set free, the computer technologies of today's day and age having finally caught up with the vision in his mind's eye. He and his team have thoroughly created a world of phantasmagoric delights, a successful blend of live action, computer animation, and performance capture all distorted into wonderfully weird settings and characters. As an added bonus, all of this is presented in 3-D, which doesn't assault our eyes so much as envelope us, like a blanket.

The problem is that Burton insisted on creating a story. Despite the classic title, this is not an adaptation of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" or ""Through the Looking Glass."" It's in fact, for lack of a better term, a third chapter, one that disregards Carroll's literary nonsense in favor of a generic Good vs. Evil fable. There are heroes and villains where none existed before. Alice, once just a curious little girl, is now conditioned to be a champion, which means she will go through a series of challenges before having to engage in a battle to the death. Most importantly, there's now a beginning-middle-and-end plot rather than a series of vignettes. All of this is done well, and it will play even better if a traditional story is what you crave.

But that's the thing - the story as Carroll intended it was NOT traditional. That's what made it so appealing, I think. Giving this movie a conventional storyline is sort of like providing an answer to the riddle of why a raven is like a writing desk. It takes the fun out of it.

In this version, Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is a nineteen year old young woman who, after having visited Wonderland thirteen years earlier, has been plagued by strange dreams. This is of no consequence to her family or friends, all Victorian in every sense of the word - prim, proper, and snooty. They only want her to find the right suitor, and lo and behold, they have arranged an engagement party for her and her intended, the hopelessly uptight Hamish Ascot (Leo Bill). But ... what's that off in the distance? Why, it's the White Rabbit! And he's nervously tapping on a pocket watch, as if to say he's late, he's late for a very important date. Alice uses this as an opportunity to flee, and in due time, she peers into a rabbit hole, loses her grip, and falls down, down, down.

In the blink of an eye, she finds herself in a locked chamber. The only way out is through a tiny door, the key of which rests on a very large table. After a few hits and misses with a shrinking ""Drink Me"" potion and an enlarging ""Eat Me"" cake, she unlocks the door and finds herself back in Underland. Really? Not Wonderland? No. Underland. Anyway, the citizens of this world desperately need Alice's help: The wicked, big-headed Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) has overthrown her sister, the overly dramatic White Queen (Anne Hathaway), and now rules Underland with an iron fist. If Alice can obtain a magical sword and slay the dreaded Jabberwock, everything will return to normal. Unfortunately, Alice doesn't remember ever having been here, nor does she remember the many colorful residents. As far as she's concerned, this is all a dream.

Naturally, every creature or person Alice meets is strange, if not altogether insane. To start with, there's the Mad Hatter, played by Burton regular Johnny Depp. As usual, he completely disappears into his role, letting the character emerge through inhuman eyes, deranged clown makeup, a mismatched wardrobe, and a voice that alternates between a foppish lisp and a William Wallace imitation. Why the different voices? Because he's mad, I guess. There's also Tweedledee and Tweedledum (both played by Matt Lucas), who look like a cross between Humpty Dumpty and Pugsley Addams. There's the sly, sneaky Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), who freely appears and disappears in a puff of smoke and lets his extra wide smile linger a moment or two more than necessary. There's the arrogant Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover), the enigmatic Caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman), and the March Hare (voiced by Paul Whitehouse), who's absolutely off his rocker.

There are many things about ""Alice in Wonderland"" to praise. It's a stunning technical achievement, not only for the computer artists, but also for cinematographer Dariusz Wolski, production designer Robert Stromberg, and costume designer Colleen Atwood. The performances are decent; I particularly enjoyed Anne Hathaway, who plays the White Queen with the exaggerated poise of a Disney princess. But I have to admit, I was a little disappointed by the story. Tim Burton has taken two highly off-the-wall tales and forced them to be ordinary. I think part of the reason many of us grew up on Carroll's books is because they were anything but ordinary - all character, setting, and manipulation of logic. I can't speak for everyone, but for my money, I'd rather not know why a raven is like a writing desk.",1267747200,4,5313,4.83938393839384
3630549,4,B001HN6940,"""Alice in Wonderland"" is a literary/intellectual story, full of clever ideas and wordplay, which render it essentially unfilmable. It's highly episodic and has no particular point (unlike ""Though the Looking Glass"", which at least offers the conceit that the story represents a chess game). But its fantasy elements have tempted too many filmmakers who ought to have known better.

I haven't seen every version, but up to now, the least-bad has been -- yes -- the 1951 Disney version, which, when it sticks with the original, is quite good. But I've long felt that, if you're going to turn ""Alice"" into a film, it should be aimed at adults, and emphasize the darker elements of the story.

This is what Tim Burton has finally given us. Linda Woolverton (who penned several successful Disney features) put together a script that provides dramatic movement -- Alice is destined to kill the Jabberwock *, which the Red Queen uses to threaten those who would oppose her. Whether this is the best-possible dramatic arc, I don't know, but it's at least broadly consistent with the original story. It also roughly parallels Alice's need to stand up for herself and reject the wussy twit her mother and late father's business partner have chosen for her to marry. Yes, this is trite and obvious -- but how many basic storylines /are/ there? This is one of the two most-basic -- someone has to make an important decision. (The other is ""someone wants something they're blocked from getting"".)

Not only is the Burton/Woolverton take on the story dark, but so is the imagery. With the exception of the White Queen's abode, ""Underland"" is a dark and often-dismal place. This is absolutely not a film for children much under the age of 12. It comes close to PG-13, not so much for content, but for tone. The tykes will neither appreciate it nor enjoy it.

Adults probably will. Recommended, if you like your fairy tales on the dark side.

PS: I just made some revisions and noted the ""5 out of 11"" helpful votes. (As we all know, these votes are more-often based on whether a review correlates with what the reader /hopes/ the review will say, rather than whether it provides any useful information.) What do you /want/ me to say, that this ""Alice"" is one of the greatest family films of all time, and you should grab the kids and rush right out in a viewing frenzy? Well, it isn't, and you shouldn't. It's a film for teens (not tykes) and adults. I've told you why, and you ought to be grateful enough to give the review a ""helpful"" vote. So there.

* With one exception, the Jabberwock is referred to as the ""Jabberwocky"" -- but that's the name of the poem, not the monster. It's perhaps worth noting the Tenniel's drawing of the monster is rather uglier and more-frightening that Burton's. I'm surprised it wasn't used.",1267747200,8,2810,4.712830957230143
3630550,4,B001HN6940,"An older Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to Wonderland after escaping a planned engagement party, that was planned by everyone but her. While in Wonderland, the white rabbit thinks he might have lured the wrong Alice into the Rabbit's hole. But the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) believes she's the real Alice and that she's the chosen one to bring down the Red Queen (Helen Bohen Carter). The Red Queen stole the thrown from her good sister, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and has forced everyone to worship her.

  I like that it's not an unnecessary remake, we have had the same story done over and over again enough times. The movie is fun with a brilliant cast. Burton does his most imaginative work even if we didn't really need a big fight between good and evil in an Alice and Wonderland movie. All of that felt like a combination of Narnia and Lord of the Rings.

  I've seen some reviews where dumb critics say Depp was the only good thing about the movie. He was good, but I don't think it was his best work. I don't know why his Mad Hatter had accent on and off that makes him sound like a leprechaun. Hell, he even occasionally sounded a lot like BeetleJuice. Other than that, he was perfect in the role. However, the film would be less effective if Wasikowska wasn't cast as Alice. She's a real find and was excellent as Alice, she was possibly even the best I've seen. I'd love to see a Burton remake of the Wizard of Oz, but only if he doesn't think the Wizard of Oz would need an big epic battle between good and evil. It would also be nice to get a break from Depp and Helen Bohen Carter in everything he does. We don't need Carter as the Wicked Witch and Depp as the Scare Crow.",1267747200,3,1691,4.3354430379746836
3630551,3,B001HN6940,"There was quite the schism when Tim Burton remade&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory/dp/B000BB1MI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>.

He made the factory grander, weirder, and far more unsettling, and he took Gene Wilder's impishly subdued Wonka and made him into a twitchy germaphobe with creepy teeth.  I found it difficult to compare the two films, because it seemed like they were trying to do two completely different things.  The first film was about childish wonder and the fine line between growing up and growing old.  The second film was about daddy issues and the dangers of drug abuse.  I think.

Burton's next big remake, ALICE IN WONDERLAND suffers from the same division of purpose.  In fact, it would be far better if the film had been billed as a sequel.  ALICE IN WONDERLAND II: BEYOND THE THUNDERDOME.  Alice is no longer a precocious and curious child, and when she falls down the rabbit hole this second time, she realizes that she misheard the name of the place when she was younger.  It's not called Wonderland.  It's called Underland.  Burton is known for his darkness, and that name change gives you a good idea of just where Burton applied most of the strokes of his grim, black brush.  The effect is contrary to what most people (fans of the original, for sure) will be expecting from the film.  The original was about the wonder and beauty of a child's imagination; this film is about the dreary blackness of control.

Of course, the original Wonderland had its dark sides (not the least of which being a queen with a penchant for beheadings), but those dark sides were the unavoidable shadows you got from all the loony brightness that dripped from the trees or exploded from the ground (or just appeared out of thin air).  What Burton has done is take all that background menace and bring it straight to the fore, so that the wonder and enchantment take a backseat to the film's angry (and rather dull) plot.  What we have here is a Wonderland -- excuse me; I mean Underland -- that is steadily decaying under the rule of its Machiavellian queen (""It's better to be feared than loved,"" she mutters, a copy of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Prince/dp/0979415403/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Prince</a>&nbsp;surely hidden beneath her dress).  According to a prophetic scroll, Alice must return and restore order to the world by dispatching of the queen's barbarous pet, the Jabberwocky (a beast lifted from a few of Carroll's poems).

Wonderland as Carroll described it was always distinctly amoral.  It sprawled and seethed and pulsed with chaotic color.  Burton's Underland is all about justice and slavishness and it hisses with murky moodiness.  Instead of having a Mad Hatter of dizzying antics and baffling wordplay, you now have Depp's (oddly Scottish) Hatter, a man who is less mad than he is bi-polar.  One minute he is railing against the queen and crying for rebellion, the next minute he's sadly melting into himself as if struggling with senility.  He shares the screen with the excessively plastic White Queen (Anne Hathaway cheesing it up big time) and the encephalitic Red Queen (played by an emotionally mute Helena Bonham Carter; she uses about as many facial expressions as an actual deck of cards, and I never once believed her when she called for yet another person's head).  The only character who really lights up the screen is, of course, the Cheshire Cat, and even his psychotic omnipresence is neutered by the film's insistence on rules (I CANNOT believe a character actually claimed there were rules in Wonderland!) and structure.

There's no real plot to Carroll's tale, and that was part of its beauty and charm.  Burton's movie, on the other hand, is what you get when people pretend that madness is supposed to make sense.  Although it doesn't need to be said that Burton has created a visually arresting tale (the 3D mostly a so-so addition), he hasn't done anything to enchant the mind or heart.  He has instead replaced Carroll's whimsy with bellicose dreariness, and he's supplanted the frivolity with your basic (and boring) movie morals: Believe in yourself!  Don't back down from adversity!  Enslave the Chinese with the opium trade!

Forget I said that last part.  I'm not sure what it has to do with the movie, unless it's Burton's way of slapping himself in his own face.  You won't get the reference unless you see the film to the very end anyway.  If you do, then you might find, like I did, that this final moment of the movie makes the preceding bits all the darker.  It proves that, although fun in all the most obvious ways, Burton's film still lacks charm, grandeur, and the kind of loony and limitless innocence that makes Wonderland a place anyone -- young or old -- would ever want to visit.",1267660800,9,5290,5.216568047337278

The actors in this film are all wonderful, from Alice to the flower faces. I thoroughly enjoy them but particularly the Hatter and Cheshire Cat.  Johnny Depp's Hatter is phenomenal.  I could watch the Hatter all day! Every time I watch it, from the moment he sees Alice for the first time, when his whole face lights up and his huge bow tie sweeps up along with it, I am hooked again on sweet Tarrant Hightopp, the Mad Hatter. I love both sides of this wonderful character.

The special effects are phenomenal, within the action as well as within the characters. One only has to watch the Red Queen to ponder how in the world they pulled that off!  Getting back to Cheshire...I find him captivating because of his flowing, undulating movement, his shifting colors, and most of all his voice, played by Stephen Fry.  The animation is truly lovely.

Mia Wasikowska is a fairly unknown actress but , as Alice, she is a perfect combination of softness and strength, sometimes confused, but never helpless. Johnny Depp has defined the role of the Mad Hatter forever more as far as I'm concerned. His madness is gentle, he's compassionate, and even seems a bit in love with Alice. All of the characters are marvelous, from the Tweedles to the Cheshire Cat to the Red Queen (Big Head) to the White Queen (admittedly, though, Anne Hathaway with her dramatic gestures, kinds of takes it over the top). This is a marvelous movie but I don't recommend it for young children as it's definitely not in light, airy, fairy-tale mode.",1520121600,2,1015,4.491891891891892

The anger and violence may be fearful for their tender hearts, IMO. As for this adult, I appreciate Tim Burton and his vision, which can be dark at times, yet always seems to find a redemptive end as good triumphs over evil. Johnny Depp is an excellent Mad Hatter, and brings a pathos to a tragic figure, made mad by his profession. The Queen of Hearts' portrayal by Helena Bonham Carter is frankly brilliant.  Mia Wasikowska's portrayal of Alice, who is understandably confused having forgotten her childhood wonder, is sympathetic and kindly. Aside: The 2016 origin story dvd 'Through the Looking Glass'  is excellent, and brings closure to the 'Alice in Wonderland' saga.",1510358400,,793,4.823529411764706

the plot

As a child, Alice Kingsleigh was often bothered by the same horrible dream.  She would tell her father of falling down a deep deep hole and then meeting strange creatures in an enchanted forest such as white rabbits, disappearig cats and a pipe-smoking catepillar. She would worry aloud to her father that she thinks she is losing her mind, which her father would reply that it was good news as 'all the best people are mad.'  Now Alice is 19 years old and one special day, at her own engagement party, she finds herself being lured away by a little white rabbit holding a watch before Hamish could make his public proposal to her.  As she is following the rabbit, she follows him to a hole in the ground by a tree, which she accidentally falls into.  Over the thirteen years that it's been since she fell down the hole the first time, she has had dreams of falling down this hole, and meeting strange characters.  Now that she is falling again, and meeting all of the same people, her memory is cloudy.  The people of Underland are not even sure if the rabbit had lured the right Alice down there because she doesn't remember.

She meets all of her old friends (who she has now forgotten) Tweedledee and Tweedledum, Absolem the Blue Caterpillar, Cheshire Cat, March Hare and of course The Mad Hatter.  They tell her that she was brought back to Underland because it was foretold that only she could defeat the Red Queen's Jabberwocky dragon.  In her quest to find the sword to slay the Jabberwocky, the Mad Hatter is captured by the Red Queen and taken prisoner to her castle.  Alice wants to first help the Hatter go free before she begins her quest, and she also is staying at the castle but under a false pseudonym of Um.

She is filled in on what had happened since she had left Underland, and although it seems impossible to complete such a task of killing a giant dragon, she still soldiers on.  Will Alice be able to slay the Jabberwocky and restore the White Queen to her rightful throne, which was stolen by her sister Red Queen all those years ago?  Find out when you watch Alice In Wonderland.

the breakdown

I wasn't expecting much from Tim Burton's latest vision for Disney from the mixed reviews from Epinions.  It turns out that I am in the camp of viewers who loved it.  Johnny Depp's performance as The Mad Hatter is probably my favorite role so far of all of the films he had starred in.  He has given the character fathoms of depth, and his take was entertaining, disturbing and moving.  It was Depp's presence that totally made the movie so fantastic.  I wasn't familiar with Mia Wasikowska until this film.  Her performance was fine but generic in the way that just about any young actress could have played the part of Alice as well.  Matt Lucas is another actor whose work I haven't come across.  His face seems to be a well-fitting image to play the dual role of Tweedledee and Tweedledum.  He has very funny mannerisms, and he himself was witty.

I found it fitting that this was a Disney film, as it served as a sequel to the original Disney animated film of the same name from 1951.  Also because it was a Disney film, it may have nudged director Tim Burton to curb the usual type of dark and gothic look from this film, and mirror the 1951 setting more than I thought it would.  Sure, there were still a couple of his trees with the curly-branches left over from movies like A Nightmare Before Christmas, but most of the main scenes looked very familiar.  It was nice to see the recognizable tea party setting with the Hatter and the March Hare.  The wooded area seemed right with the talking flowers, the blue caterpillar and of course the Cheshire Cat.  Here, the Cat's smile was longer, making it a bit creepy that suited Burton's tastes, but it was still faithful enough to Disney's first version so as not to upset the hardcore fans such as myself.

The film took on a story of good vs evil in the guise of Red Queen vs White Queen.  The two queens were sisters, but the Red Queen had stolen the crown from her sister a few years ago and had turned Underland into a horrible wasteland and filled with terrorized citizens who are scared to death of this Red Queen.  It kind of mirrors The Lion King in that regard, when Scar had stolen the rule of the land away from Simba.  This comparison makes sense since both films have the same writer, Linda Woolverton.

There is some fantasy violence with a Jabberwocky, a Bandersnatch and a flying Jubub, however this kind of violence may produce a bit of squirming.  I think it's still OK for the kids, but the younger ones around six or seven may get bored, around nine years old they may get as into the film as you.  Amidst all of the wondrous and imaginative scenery and the nonsense Lewis Carroll-inspired language, the main draw for me ended up being the amazing performance of Depp.  Looking at the pictures on the advertising, I wouldn't have dreamed that it would affect me the way it did as it all seems just a bit gimmicky with the makeup, the costumes and the computer illustrations.  I highly recommend this new vision of Alice in Wonderland for all.  Hopefully the 3D version will look awesome in our home theaters when it finally arrives.

3630639,5,B001HN6940,"I will cover the 3D aspects of this film, then I will add my thoughts on the storyline and the movie itself.

I originally bought this to add another title to my 3D collection, however after seeing this in 2D when first released and upon obtaining this movie in 3D, I was able to experience it like I wasn't able to before. It brought a whole new dimension to the movie and allowed me to view it as it was meant to be seen as a theatrical 3D release. As for how well the 3D aspect of this movie is, I was impressed for the most part, I didn't really experience any ghosting as some reviewer's claimed to have experienced and was quite pleased with the depth of the 3D in some of the scenes. Please keep in mind that not all 3D TVs perform the same, some do a much better job at rendering 3D than others. Luckily I own a 65"" 3D TV that does an excellent job at displaying 3D, and let me tell you this movie did not disappoint. I only wish that I had opened and watched this 3D version sooner as I've had it for a while.

First I want to mention and give credit to Tim Burton, he never fails to deliver a superb masterpiece with every film he produces.

As for the story, the plot is pretty much a sequel to the original Disney animated Alice in Wonderland. The movie starts out with Alice as a little girl waking up from a dream, which was her first trip into Wonderland. It then moves onto when she is an adult and finds herself back in Wonderland again. This time around Wonderland has transformed into something dangerous and dark if you will. Alice becomes more of a hero in this version by saving Wonderland from the disparage and evils of the Jabberwock. Again Johnny Depp plays a fantastically insane Mad Hatter, just love him in any movie he is in, what a character. The acting in this movie was done pretty well. I have read other reviews saying the actress portraying Alice 'Mia Wasikowska' could've done better, however myself I thought she did quite well. All in all I was quite pleased with this movie. This would be a good choice in movies for the entire family to view together, including the young ones.",1497744000,8,2118,4.29

Alice meets a whole colorful cast of characters, nice ones and bad ones. It has its charms and it is very different from the book and even the animated Disney version. The new looking glass one is completely farther than the book. That doesn't make this a bad movie in the least. A fun family movie.",1488240000,2,627,4.460869565217391

The 6-year old girl, Alice Kingsleigh (Ella Challen), wakes up after having a nightmare again. Her father, Charles (Marton Csokas), puts her back in bed and comforts her. Alice tells her father about the strange creatures. Her father tells her she can always wake up.

Her mother discovers she is not wearing her corset nor her stockings. She tells her she is not dressed properly. Realizing her daughter is growing up, she gives Alice her necklace.
  The affair is actually a surprise engagement party for Alice. Hamish (Leo Bill) wants to ask her hand in marriage.  As Lady Ascot speaks rudely to Alice in the garden,  Alice sees a rabbit in the bushes. Then when she talks to Aunt Imogene (Frances de la Tour), she sees the rabbit again.
  Later, Hamish proposes to Alice in front of everybody. She is reluctant and says that it is too quick for her and she walks away. She doesn't really like him. She runs to the backwoods following the rabbit. She comes across a big hole at the roots of the remains of an old tree. Looking deeper into the hole, Alice falls.
She falls a long way down into Wonderland.

3631059,3,B001HN6940,This is a hard movie to review.  Everybody in it is terrific.  Ever since Johnny Depp has been around he has been one of my favorite actors and this is the kind of role he does best.  Although with recent events I don't think as much of him.  But that has nothing to do with this.  This is the first time I had heard of Mia Wasikowska who is great also.  Anne Hathaway as the White Queen.  Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen who looks like she puts her eye shadow on with a windshield wiper.  Are all very good. For Carter who has a style that you either get or you dont.  This is the best role I think I have seen her in.  I have never read this book.  I have seen several different versions on film.  And the final battle against the Jabberwocky is very well done.  This isn't a kid's movie and with all the colors and the different charectors.  There were times I was wondering what kind of drugs were they on when they made this.  It  is also the kind of movie where everytime you watch it you will probably pick up something new that you had missed before.  With all the negative reviews this is an entertaining movie.  Annd isn't that what you want for a move.,1473724800,,1169,4.12

This version of the Classic tale is very dark with a star-studded cast (Depp, Hathaway, Bonham Carter, Lee, Rickman, Gough) the story is well out together. Alice is being pressed into mariage, not knowing what to do. She runs off after a rabbit in a suit. Only to find herself in a magical world full of good vs bad , mythical creatures, adventure, and of course Tea. Well worth giving this one a shot.",1472515200,,460,4.423529411764706

3631171,1,B001HN6940,"But, for whatever reason, they keep bringing in this political power struggle and talk of the prophecy, and that's not what Alice in Wonderland is about! It's supposed to be a fun road trip of dream-like nonsense; an escape from reality through creative surrealism. It's supposed to be a child-like experience, not a war movie! But, listen, these characters constantly talk like they're in a war movie!
So let me get this straight: In Alice in Wonderland, the story based on the Lewis Carroll novel, Alice is not a little girl anymore, she's all grown up, she's not in Wonderland, she's returning to Wonderland, and Wonderland itself, in fact, isn't Wonderland at all, it's called ""Underland"". UNDERLAND?!? That sounds like a made up world in a Fruit of the Loom commercial! I'm sorry. How am I supposed to take an adaptation seriously when you can't even get one word of the title right?!
""Mickey's Adventures in Wonderland"" is a better adaptation than this. That goes for 'Care Bears in Wonderland' too!",1470700800,2,1005,4.883040935672515

3631451,4,B001HN6940,"I watched this after a friend recommended it. I had a prime credit, so I got the rental for just over $1. It was very visually pleasing, but the storyline was so-so. As far as live-action remakes of cartoons go, it's great. I also love Johnny Depp as the mad hatter. The Queen of Hearts is a little creepy with the big head and honestly I'm not convinced with Alice, but I might be overly critical. In the end, it's a great movie if you want to watch pretty CGI and like the Alice in Wonderland story, but personally, I liked the Disney cartoon version better. I know there's a sequel out, but after watching this, I probably won't watch the next one. I feel like it'd just be another carbon copy of this... generic storyline with pretty visuals.

While ""Through the looking glass"" was good, the visuals were the only truly great part about the movie. The story lacked volume and backing, and often got muddled. While this first version was far superior and actually showed Alice fighting to help her friends. Alice is supposed to be a little girl after all, and not an adult (like they are pushing far harder in the second version), at least in this version she could pass for a sulky teenager over a little girl, the second movie gives you no option on asking how old she may be as she is a ship captain sailing her fathers ship all over the world.

3632239,3,B001HN6940,"With ""Alice's Adventures Through The Looking Glass"" soon to make its premier, I thought I ought to visit this earlier Tim Burton effort in the Carroll library, as my memories of it were faded, yet distinctly displeased.  It didn't take very long at all (well before the actual adventure begins) for me to realize what had turned me off on the film when it first came out, and why I'd not seen it since, but more on that later...

Properly told, this is not Lewis Carroll's story of Alice in Wonderland, as interpreted by Tim Burton;  rather it is Tim Burton concocting an entirely new story using the characters from Carroll, and referencing the earlier work.  As such, it should be called ""Alice's Adventures In the Underland"" as that is what this world is called, and it is quite distinctly different, even with the raft of Carroll's characters carrying the story as it is.

Sadly, what Carroll wrote as a most engaging fantasy, Burton makes into (Yet Another) war story, because we don't have enough war stories.  Here, the Red Queen (as delightfully played by Helena Bonham Carter as the Mad Hatter is played by the always loopy Johnny Depp) has laid waste to the kingdom of the White Queen (played with a mostly failed attempt at camp by Anne Hathaway) and rules in her place.  In the place of all of Carroll's imaginative story is a silly prophecy that Alice will return and slay the Jaberwocky and Happy Endings Will Prevail.  Alice doesn't want to do this, and a lot of the characters don't think this Alice is The Alice, but it all works out in the end, although getting there is much more tedious than reading the original for the third or fourth time (which isn't tedious at all).

Creating yet another dystopian world, in which to have yet another war, is way below Tim Burton's talent.  When it comes to imagination, Burton has been right up there with Carroll, and Baum, and a bit more productive as well.  This, well, let's just hope ""Through The Looking Glass"" is more Burton and less of whatever it is afflicted this one.",1464739200,3,2038,4.602209944751381

3633137,4,B001HN6940,"As a huge Alice in wonderland fan I first watched the movie under the impression it would be a remake of the cartoon I grew up on, which, personally I feel is what most expected and why I think many were disappointed. However, this movie mostly focuses on a short poem from the book Lewis Carroll wrote. The visuals were awesome, as were the characters and their costumes. Sitting down to watch this, you may very well be disappointed if you're expecting a remake of the Disney film, but to sit down and watch a good movie with nothing but a love for wonderland in mind, it's more than worth a watch",1464134400,,599,4.357142857142857

Although the Hatter doesn't play such a large role in the book, he's all over this story and played to perfection by Johnny Depp. Also Helena Bonham Carter makes a superb queen of hearts, even with the eye watering effect of her head being huge compared to the tiny body!
The art work, special effects, scenery and costumes are all really lush and perfect, making this is a visual pleasure.
Not a true rendition of the book but even as a Lewis Carroll fan I found this a wonderful film.

3633418,4,B001HN6940,It is not a spoiler that this is more of a sequel to the original Alice in Wonderland. She is all grown up and things are a bit different now. The movie alludes to this constantly. It seems like a fun romp through Wonderland none the less. Until the end where it feels a bit forced. Like they ran out of ideas about the time came to right the end. It is still a decent watch in my book and with the new sequel coming out there is new interest.

3633422,4,B001HN6940,"Burtons dark reinvention of Alice is visually amazing, and it boasts terrific, bold and odd performances by Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp, as the Red Queen and the Mad Hatter respectively.  With a 19 year old Alice (shes revisiting, although she doesnt know it at first), and an almost post apolocalyptic feel to areas of wonderland, Burton beings his trademark black humor to the childrens fable.  The CGI work is excellent, and there are a lot of interesting thematic ideas.

On the other hand, I found myself almost completely devoid of emotion.  Never bored  theres always something to interesting to watch  a great performance moment or an inventive visual or both.  But at the end I felt empty  not happy, or sad, or feeling a need to ponder the story more deeply.  Also, the book-ending story device  of Alice being proposed to by a WAY over the top unattractive Lord-to-be) felt heavy handed and obvious.  It's great that this is a female empowerment version of Alice, but its too bad we know in the 1st 3 minutes where well end up.  Last, throwing a pop song on the closing credits after 2 hours of excellent classic score by Danny Elfman felt like a painful bow to the commercial desire to have a song to sell.

I always want to see anything Tim Burton does, and there are many nuggets of gold here for the fan of his work.  But in this case theres a lack of heart I don't usually associate with him.",1463011200,,1417,4.52755905511811

3633655,5,B001HN6940,"This is a movie that entertains, from beginning to end.  The cast is wonderful. Mia Wasikowska is a great teenage Alice, sublime, with a steely core.

3633755,5,B001HN6940,This is just an amazing version of this movie. Jonny Depp brings the Mad Hatter to life and with such an array of characters throughout Wonderland you are sucked in as though you are experiencing everything through Alice's own eyes. There is drama/excitement for adults and great images and character traits for younger viewers to hold their interest as well.,1460764800,,359,5.0
3633766,3,B001HN6940,"Tim Burton's ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a mixed bag for me. There is a lot to like about this film and a lot I found annoying and tedious. Visually stunning at times it certainly is. Disney and Burton have created an exotic fantasy world as our hero Alice returns to the enchanted land. I was expecting a live-action version of the ALICE story we all know but it appears to be a sequel as an adult Alice returns to the wonderland she only remembers from her dreams. It's all just a vivid dream or is it all real?

It's all in good fun and then just seems to get too full of itself and turns silly. Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is older and actually looks a bit sickly and gaunt though she is pleasant enough. Much to my surprise the two characters I did not expect to like became my favorite. Johnny Depp as the wild and affected but loveable MAD HATTER is a pure joy. Helena Bonham Carter is delicious as the evil Red Queen. Disney worked its visual effects magic by creating her huge head on a small body. Some of the other effects are not as perfect but Bayard the bloodhound is just so remarkable. Anne Hathaway seems to be channeling Glinda the Good Witch from the WIZARD OF OZ with her hand movements.

ALICE IN WONDERLAND is an OK movie especially if you are a fan of Tim Burton's world. Maybe it is just a little too over the top at times as I lost interest half way through. The journey is continuing in a new film so I am curious as to how the story continues.",1460419200,,1460,4.210714285714285

3633937,1,B001HN6940,"This redo is crap. Watch the 1951 version. It was entertaining and happy. This is morbid, dark, ritualistic. I used to like Johnny Depp but with all his wierd unpleasant roles like this one, I now detest Johnny Depp. I try to avoid his movies unless there are other actors there that I like.
This is not a children's cartoon like the 1951 movie. The music, the plot,  and everything is wierd. Look at Ann Haathway's performance as the White Queen. She doesn't act human but very ritual and affected. There was humor in the first alice movie but not much humor here at all.
Reject it. Don't let your young kids watch something dark like this. Get them the much more pleasant, happy,  and creative 1951 verson.

Between 1950 and the present, Disney went to the dark side. Not all their movies are this bad but this is bad in my opinion. Gothic children will like it Teens on drugs will like it. It reminds me of what someone on LSD what write.",1458432000,,941,4.396551724137931

3634325,2,B001HN6940,"While watching this version of Alice in wonderland by Tim Burton
i found out that half the scenes in the movie are from the Alice through the Looking Glass Book aswell as the Alice wonderland book
screenplay writer on the film Linda woolverton mixed both books from Lewis carrol's novels
into this 1 screenplay which i found very annoying and confusing
obviously Tim burton liked this Idea so he Directed it
while call the film Alice in wonderland if the 2nd half of the film are scenes from the novel Alice through the looking Glass
that makes no sense to me, ridiculous and stupid
it would make more sense to concentrate on the Alice in wonderland book and then do the sequel Alice through the looking Glass
not mixed both books together in 1 film, stupid stupid idea
i do love some of Tim burton's films mainly the Batman films and Mars attacks is good aswell
but this so called remake of Alice in wonderland is bulls**8 in my opinion
it's a tim burton version of Alice in wonderland with the rest of the movie from Alice through the looking Glass
Great acting performances ofcourse, but they idea of mixing both novels in 1 film is stupidity at it's best.

3634332,4,B001HN6940,"To this day Tim Burton remains one of my favorite
directors. There was a time where his films were met with
the greatest of expectations.  When Burton takes on original
projects such as Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before
Christmas or Big Fish I think the work is tremenous.  However,
I think Burton is at his least best when attempting to take on
old ideas, remaking classic films such as Planet of the Apes
or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Alice in Wonderland falls somewhere inbetween. Rather than
being a remake, it's an inspired sequel of the original Lewis Caroll
classic.  In fact, Burton took on this project because he personally
didn't feel a connection to the original story and wanted to do a sort
of ""re-imagining.""  In a press conference Burton explained, ""the goal
is to try to make it an engaging movie where you get some of the
psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic
nature of Alice.""

The story begins 13 years after the original, introducing us to Alice
(Mia Wasikowska) now a young adult at 19 years of age. She has
forgotten all of the events that have happened to her prior other than
strange dreams that she can't quite figure out.  When Alice attends
her surprise engagement party where she is to be proposed to by
Lord Ascott, she becomes distracted by a white rabbit that she
chases after only to end up tumbling down a large hole.  Sound
somewhat familiar?

Alice finds herself back in ""Wonderland"" where she reacquaints
herself with old and new characters voiced by talents Alan Rickman,
Barbara Windsor, Stephen Fry and Crispin Glover.  It is there that
a magic scroll reveals that she is destined to take on the nasty
Red Queen (Helena Bohham Carter) and slay her Jabberwocky.
With the help of The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and White Queen
(Ann Hathaway), Alice begins her uncertain adventure to make the
world right once more.

It's unfortunate that Alice In Wonderland ends up being just
mediocre.  While Tim Burton has put his magic touch in creating
a wondrous world, the story just cant uphold it.  There are wonderful
performances here by Johnny Depp and particularly Helen Bohnam
Carter, but neither dominate the majority of the film's running time.
The story gets rather weighted during the film's initial 18 minutes
and somewhere towards the third act.

Alice in Wonderland was not originally shot for 3D.  The filmmakers
apparently felt that due to the costs and clunky cameras that it would
be better to film in 2D and then convert to 3D.  This process is generally
not well accepted by audiences, particularly when there have been
badly converted films like Warner's Clash of the Titans.

Surprisingly, the conversion looks fairly good.  The problem is that
the quality of 3D doesn't remain consistent.  The film's first scenes
which take place in the real world has a nice 3D feel to it with foreground
characters resembling cardboard cutouts. However, sometimes the
images seemingly go completely flat such as the carriage ride with
Alice and her Mother.  Once Alice opens the tiny door into the ""Underland""
world, the film takes on a beautiful 3D landscape that you look at
and think, ""coooool.""  However, some scenes look more 3D pronounced
than others.  I did enjoy those involving the Red Queen within her palace
where you get a real sense of depth between foreground and background.
If you are looking for any ""In Yo' Face"" moments where things lunge from
the screen, you will find very little.  Once in a while swords, talking flowers
and even the brim of the Mad Hatter's hat will slightly extrude the 4th wall.
However, when objects are purposely thrown at the camera they tend to
blur as they come closer to the eye rather than give the effect they were
intended for.  Still, I was enthralled enough with the quality of 3D that
I don't think I would have enjoyed the film as much without it.

Good news!  I found hardly any ghosting issues.  Those that exist happen
where it is expected -- in dark scenes.  However, I don't think I saw a
minute's worth of ghosting throughout the entire film.

The transfer itself looks flawless, which is not surprising since most of
the film was shot digitally.  Picture looks more soft than sharp and colors
more pale than vivid.  Really, the most colorful scenes in the film involve
those with The Red Queen where the reds are highly punctuated.

Most enjoyable here is one of the most active surround tracks that I have
heard in quite some time.  There is a constant array of dialogue and effect
sounds that dance around the channels.  Watch the scene where Alice first
meets Tweddledee and Tweedledum in ""Underland"" and enjoy the conversation
moving from channel to channel.  The forrest scenes seemingly come alive
thanks to the whispers, creaks and other various sounds that fill the rears.
The DTS-HD soundtrack robustly conveys Danny Elfman's score.  Bass
response is rather subtle throughout with the exception of the scenes involving
the Bandersnatch and Jaberwocky.

Nice little touch here is that there are no trailers or other non-essentials
included on the front of the presentation.  Essentially the viewer is taken
directly to the main menu shortly after inserting the disc.

I have to give props to Disney.  Alice In Wonderland was a title
originally bundled solely for release with Sony hardware.  I had criticized
the studio early on for not releasing enough 3D content for the first
big 3D holiday season.  The announcement that this title would be
released retail came suddenly only a mere two weeks ago and in
time for Christmas.

Though I personally don't think Alice In Wonderland is nearly the
best film Tim Burton has made I do feel that Disney has put together
a 3D Blu-ray worthy of everyone's consideration.  It's not consistently
the best 3D title I have watched but it does succeed as being good enough
to be the perfect choice for a family night gathering.",1453075200,,5911,4.815659068384539

3634535,1,B001HN6940,"Alice In Wonderland (2010) is a sequel to Alice In Wonderland and Thru The Looking Glass.
Except that it doesn't make sense.

I put it on last night and did not really pay attention, but based on what I saw I an not dying to sit with the film and carefully look at stuff.

Careless, sloppy story, made by people who are not even familiar with the original tale.

""Jabberwocky"" indeed.

The Hatter and the Hare already have names, Hatta and Haigha. No need to change them.

The Red Queen becomes absolutely confused with the Queen Of Hearts, and while some scenes are repeated for no reason, since it is a sequel, they lack the dream logic of the book or even the dream quality (for example the sheep at the store scene transmogrifying into a boating scene,) and the story does not even work as a chess game, which is what Looking Glass is supposed to be.

But, of course, this is not Alice Thru The Looking Glass, but then why do I see a chessboard motif?

Why are there more than two Red Knights, shouldn't those be Red Pawns?

Maddening, really.

They really should have named the film something else.

Even my 11 y.o. daughter said: ""This is not what I expected, why isn't this like the book?""

The ""real"" scenes of Victorian England are even more ridiculous.
Alice is already a rebel. Why does she need to have the dream fantasy to work up the courage to say no to an arranged marriage.

The Victorian scenes are so out of touch with history as to be even more fantastic than the fantasy scenes.

Can we not have a feminist message without lying about history?

Why is a dream so undreamlike?

Where is the Liddel in Alice Liddel, why is she Kingsleigh, or whatever?

Why is the White Queen not living backwards in time?

Where are the Red and White Kings?

What does killing a Jabberwock have to do with refusing a proposal of marriage?

Tweddledee and Dum look like a pair of Pugsley Addams, and end up looking more like Humpty Dumpty than anything else, where is Humpty Dumpty, btw?

Why not make the Jub Jub Bird into a Giant Crow, thus killing two birds with one stone?

Who the hell is the guy with the eyepatch?

Why is the Dormouse not sleepy? We've recently already had Repicheep and Desperaux, why do we need a third swashbuckling mouse? It just feels repetitive.

Why does it feel as if Burton keeps telling us dirty jokes, which he thinks are funny, but no one else does?

Why create all new characters that don't fit the story, when so many others already exist which do? Why not use those?

Why, why why?

Having also seen the BBC version, it suffers by comparison.

The BBC, Jonathan Miller directed, version is very literate, well paced, highlights the use of the English language and nonsense and uses no fantastic costuming.

Yet is a million times more dreamlike, using only limited effects such as lenses, forced perspective and a double exposure (?) for the Cheshire cat at one point.

At this point I have come to believe that even the animated Disney version is superior to the 2010 version.",1448236800,,3018,4.486238532110092

3634541,4,B001HN6940,"This is an unusual spin on the classic ""Alice in Wonderland"" tale, with nuances best appreciated by adults. The story is good... odd, but good. The casting was very good. The performances were very good. The set designs and special effects were impressive.

Depp brings an interesting interpretation to the Mad Hatter, and while his performance seemed a little restrained (both for him and for what this movie could have been), he also brings magic to this film.

It's not quite ""great for the entire family,"" unless your children are 10 years old or older. (Younger ones may not understand what's going on in some scenes, and little children might actually be frightened by some of them.)

The ""big head"" and other physical distortions was amusing, but barely held up as a running sight gag. It seemed almost like filler for a story that needed more substance.

Alice... I'm not sure if it was the casting or the direction, but I found it difficult to care what happened to her. Frankly, she was pretty to look at, but seemed rather vapid. I didn't see much character arc there.

Tweedledee and Tweedledum were charming, and probably could have had more screen time.

The White Queen was confusing. I didn't dislike her, but I didn't like her, either. Her character didn't make sense... but not in the charming, ""nonsensical"" context that Carroll had provided in his stories.

The Red Queen did seem nonsensical and delightfully warped. Helena Bonham Carter can shine in any role, and I think this one -- between the script and the makeup -- probably challenged her more than most roles she's played. I wish we'd seen more of her character's eccentricities.

Depp's role was enigmatic, but something seemed lacking; I'm not sure if he was distracted, or not given enough to work with, but -- whatever the issue -- he did a very good job in this role.. just not what it could have been.

I know this review sounds as if I didn't like the movie, but I did. It just wasn't as good as it could have been, and not quite up to the standards I expect from Disney, Burton, and the cast. If I'd watched it with lower expectations, I might be giving this a better review.

On balance, this movie is intriguing enough to be worth watching, if only as a preparation for the 2016 sequel... which I hope will be more dazzling, stylish, and whimsical. This movie didn't quite achieve what I'd expected, in those terms, but it came close enough that I can say I liked it and I'm glad I purchased the DVD.",1447718400,,2489,4.610859728506787

3635584,4,B001HN6940,"Not being a Tim Burton fan (much to the dismay of some of my friends), I've been debating about his new version of Alice in Wonderland almost since I first heard about it.  But curiosity got the better of me, and I went to see it.  This certainly isn't the Wonderland of the books (and combines elements from both of Lewis Carroll's famous tales), but if you can get past that, you'll find it very enjoyable.

It's been thirteen years since Alice (Mia Wasikowska) first visited Wonderland.  Now a young woman of nineteen, she is about to become engaged, only she isn't sure if she wants to get married.

And that's when Alice starts seeing a rabbit in a waistcoat again.  Curious, she follows him down a giant rabbit hole and lands in Wonderland.  Everyone there seems to remember her, but she doesn't remember any of it.  They are expecting Alice to free them from the reign of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).  But Alice doesn't think she is the Alice they think she is.  Can she free them?

I knew going into this that we were dealing with the Alice of the books, and I was glad.  If I had been expecting that, I would have been highly disappointed.  That's not to say there aren't plenty of nods to the source material.  Obviously, the characters are the same.  Plenty of references are made to the most famous aspects of the books, which kept this fan smiling.

By ditching the books, this movie is able to tell one coherent story instead of a series of encounters Alice has with the strange creatures.  Everything is woven together quite well, and I liked where the story went.  This isn't to say that the story was original.  In fact, I found the predictability of the story to be one of the biggest flaws with the movie.

Tim Burton has a very specific visual style, and it is all over the place here.  Every moment of every frame screams Tim Burton.  It is gorgeous to look at.  The movie is filled with visual effects, and they are quite believable.  Only one or two of them fell flat for me.  And considering Alice changed sizes several times over the course of the movie, that's pretty impressive.

I went to see the movie in 3D.  While I enjoyed the effects, very few of the moments truly required the technology to enjoy.  I wouldn't worry about seeing it that way.  Save the money and see it in standard 2D.

The acting and voice acting were all top notch.  It's not too surprising that Johnny Depp can play crazy so well.  I did see another couple characters in his Mad Hatter, but he was always good.  Helena Bonham Carter was great as the Red Queen.  Anne Hathaway seemed weird as the White Queen, but that was mainly because of how she played her.  I've seen some people complain about Mia Wasikowa as Alice, but I thought she was great in the part.

One reason I'm not usually a fan of Tim Burton's movies is his dark tone.  That's certainly true here.  There were several scary moments that might scare young kids, although those in the audience with me seemed okay with the movie.  One particularly nasty scene involves skulls in a moat.  Another couple things like that seemed pointless to me and would have made for a better movie if they were left out.

Overall, I am glad I gave in and went to see Alice in Wonderland.  It's a different take on the classic characters, and that's what makes it fun.",1430524800,,3329,4.434710743801653

I love Johnny Depp as an actor & I've absolutely loved all of Tim Burton's work since I was a very young child anything done by Tim Burton & features Johnny Depp is bound for success. This movie picks up where Alice is a young adult, it is well done, well though out, and a must have for any Alice fans. Even if your not an Alice fan (as I myself am not) this movie is still awesome, it's the only Alice movie I will watch & I've watched it over 100 times. But If you are a fan of Tim Burton's work, or huge fan of Johnny Depp's acting, & if you love seeing the 2 of them and the awesome work they do together then this is a must see movie.

3636290,4,B001HN6940,"This is a very different Alice than Ive reviewed for the past two weeks. Because Alice is grown up in this one rather than a child, the conflict is more serious. Its not longer a whimsical place full of fun and whimsy; Underland is a place where the threat of death is very real. Danger lurks around every corner, and everyone is looking for Alice Kingsley, who believes the entire fiasco is a dream.

I know a lot of people who really dislike this version. Its definitely not my favorite, but you have to admit, Tim Burtons vision of Wonderland is visually stunning. The art direction is absolutely gorgeous, and so much fun to look at. Every time I watch it, I see something new that Id never noticed before.

The conflict here is quite interesting; because its something of a sequel, its all about Alice stepping up and becoming a heroine, rather than simply an observer. The idea that she believed in dreams when she was little but has lost those beliefs as shes grown up is a very relevant theme. Alice has to figure who and what she wants to be; this is the main crisis she is dealing with at home, having just been proposed to by someone she could never marry, though everyone expects her to accept.

Alice is played by Mia Wasikowska, and honestly, shes probably one of my least favorite Alices. I loved her Jane Eyre, but she just doesnt seem to work here. She has a look that is classic Tim Burton, so its no wonder why she was cast, but shes quite robotic for most of the film. Johnny Depp is, of course, brilliant as the Mad Hatter, skipping between light-hearted and serene Hatter to a truly mad, intense and angry Hatter. Helena Bonham Carter is terrifying and odd as the Red Queen, while Anne Hathaway is possibly even more bizarre as her sister the White Queen.

The Jabberwock is not just a poem Alice recites; here he is a monstrous beast that Alice must defeat to save Underland. This scene alone is creepy and slightly nightmarish and knocks this movie up and out of the kids range (if other things about it hadnt already). Tim Burtons Alice is not one I would recommend showing your small children. Everything has an eerie and nefarious air to it, and its a much more grown up tale than what I imagine Lewis Carroll had in mind.

3636681,4,B001HN6940,"Turn Tim Burton loose, add Johnny Depp, mix with 3D (not shot in, rather ""shot for"") and it does add up to some free-wheeling fun. In theatrical release this followed right on the heels of ""AVATAR"" and the audience was just as rewarded. Unlike a number of studio-generated 3D rip-off conversions which quickly followed the 3D here is well planned and enjoyable to watch. The likely downfall in favor of 3D which we are experiencing today probably results from the idiots who run things thinking that a computer can solve all. This is good 3D (and a would have added a 4th star for that if it could have been so designated).

Just enjoy - it is just as watchable a second and third time as it is the first.",1416441600,2,705,4.423076923076923

3637295,3,B001HN6940,"First up is Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland, a slightly updated telling of the classic tale. This time
around, Alice is 19-years-old, and faced with the pressures and expectations of life. She returns to
Wonderland, encounters all the old familiar characters, and finds herself thrusts into a battle she is not
sure she wants to join. Yes Alice  its just like the real world! You have to make a choice!
I was lucky enough to see this in 3D and the CGI effects were awesome. Particularly the Cheshire Cat,
with his floating body that can appear at every turn. Johnny Depp as usual takes front and center in his
portrayal of the Mad Hatter. That is, if you can understand what he says half the time; his Mad Hatter has
a bizarre Scottish brogue that would come and go.
The story holds up well, and the message of girl power comes across, though I do think by the end it
became Hey, look what we can do with these crazy effects!",1408406400,,925,4.409356725146199

3637544,4,B001HN6940,"This movie is, sadly, reflective of Tim Burton's films of the last 15 years: an absolute marvel of visual genius dragged down by a script that just does not hold up its end; thus 4 Stars. On BD it is a wonder to behold once we get past all the pasty-faced toffs that ""set up"" Alice for her welcome adventures away from the snobbery of the first 15 minutes. For the next 30 minutes the movie is a delight with Helena Bonham Carter giving a marvelous performance that steals the show in my opinion. Now we come to Johnny Depp, whom plays his role as if he is Johnny Depp pretending to be someone else playing JD as JD would play the role if he was not REALLY JD but was trying desperately to pull it off somehow. Whew! Does that make sense? It's a typical mannered performance and not a bad one, I guess it is just that we have seen him do this before many, many times and it's time to move on Johnny. ""Alice"" is about 20 minutes too long, the grrrrl power fight scene is a total bore (does anyone expect Alice to lose to the Jabberwocky?), and the ""let us sail to China and trade with them"" ending is a head-scratcher. I picked mine up used for $8 and for that price I am happy to have it, and I will enjoy watching it once a year maybe with a few chapter skips along the way. If you are torn between this or the Disney version I would heartily recommend going with Uncle Walt.",1404259200,,1376,4.118959107806692

That Burton and his collaborators can't follow Carrol's carefully worked out story and felt the need to turn it into a teenage story of female empowerment is irritating enough (the original Alice is already intelligent resourceful and brave)  but that it made  a billion dollars at the box office makes me want to weep for our dumbed down culture.",1402963200,,535,4.782608695652174

The special effects are high quality and although the acting is not great, it is good, and the characters are very believable. High marks. And OMG that White Queen......heavy sigh......",1402272000,,264,5.0227272727272725
3637590,5,B001HN6940,"It's hard to comprehend why so many reviewers here seem unaware that THIS IS A SEQUEL  to Lewis Carroll/Charles Dodgson's book(s). Yes, there were two Alice books, and Burton's sequel (to both) blends elements from both (chessmen and playing cards, for example) as well as inventing new ones (the power struggle between the Red & White queens, for instance), which should be expected when creating an extension of an existing story. This film is unlike ANY of its predecessors (the classic, creepy 1933 version with W.C. Fields as Humpty Dumpty, the unfortunate 1951 Disneyfication, which sanitizes every atom of creepiness from the books  I'll take Johnny Depp over Ed Wynn as the Mad Hatter, ANY day), because IT ISN'T THE SAME STORY.

That being said, Burton's green-screened, motion-captured ""Underland"" is the most lush, fully imagined Wonderland I've seen outside the original Sir John Tenniel illustrations  not to mention the Oraculum scroll, which obviously pays homage to Tenniel's style. Danny Elftman's eerie musical score is equally outstanding. There are very few instances where a film transcends a novel (other recent examples might be Wes Anderson's stop-motion tour de force, Fantastic Mr. Fox and Kyle Balda & Chris Renaud's marvelous CGI production of The Lorax.) All three of these films take up the challenge of translating beloved children's classics to the big screen, and succeed outrageously  because they simultaneously respect AND exceed the original authors' imaginations.

If one is only looking for a cinematic translation of Alice in Wonderland and/or Through the Looking Glass, go watch W.C. Fields and his surrealist contemporaries (it's definitely an all-star cast), the Disney travesty or any one of the feeble made-for-t.v. efforts. Just don't take Tim Burton to task for his ""failure"" to make Alice in Wonderland  especially when he's made such a marvelous ""Alice Returns"".",1402185600,,1911,5.35

3637700,5,B001HN6940,"The movie was a laugh riot of pure entertainment.  I'd recommend this for kids and adults, such as myself, who need to space out now and then.  Jonny Depp is a great character actor.  I think he could play a peach and still get caffows.  However this version was personal as well.  You get to see how the Mad Hatter-Depp and Alice-Wasikowska relationship develops in a dream that has haunted Alice since childhood.  These two are a real pair.  It is a dream that is so real yet not surreil.
Action was great.  Costuming very good.  Animation, direction, cinematography all of it a real treat.

Sometimes Alice needs to be as small as a bug or tall as a tree.  The rabbit leaves cake to eat or solution to drink that makes her tiny or a giant depending on the need.  One favorite scene of mine was when Alice has to grow to meet the queen.  Unfortunately she eats too much and becomes maybe over 6' tall.  All of a sudden she finds herself nude behind a tree like bush.  She has to introduce herself to the evil queen.  When asked her name Alice says Um as most would in this predicament.  So her name is now Um from Umbridge.  For some odd reason it makes me laugh just to think about it.

I've decided to add it to my collection and purchase it.",1395705600,,1246,4.247863247863248

3637738,5,B001HN6940,"]Being a TOTAL Tim Burton fan, my objectivity may be a tad skewed, but this is an excellent realization of the Carroll classic with Burton flourishes, i.e. dazzling special effects, exquisite production standards/art direction and ultimately flawless casting replete with his sidekick, Johnny Depp and his faithful, FLAWLESS wife, Helena Bonham Carter who simply WERKED the Red Queen.  Her performance alone is worth the price of admission.  Off the CHAIN!!  Johnny was wooooooooooonderful as usual as the Mad Hatter and Mira Wasikowska was perfectly cast as the independent, strong-willed, critical-thinking Alice!  Visually stunning as is usually the case with Burton fantasies and this one delights.  It could also be a fun family film.

3637768,1,B001HN6940,"Alice in Wonderland is a sequel to Lewis Carrolls original Alice books, with many liberties taken combining all characters into one Underland.  Teenaged Alice is unwittingly dragged back to the fantasyland to overthrow the Red Queen.

 With a name like Wonderland one expects exotic creatures, fantastical situations, and a vivid rainbow of colors.  Two out of three aint bad.  Only Tim Burton could take the whole spectrum and make each color its own shade of black.  Wonderland is both mystifying and drab at the same time.

 Im not a fan of Hollywoods desire to turn every new film 3-D. I do think some movies might be worthwhile in 3-D and really hoped Alice was one.  Unfortunately, nothing in this film really popped off the screen.  Id have rather saved three bucks and seen it in 2-D.

 On a positive note, the Red Queen and her giant head were great to watch and Id have loved to have seen more of her and less of the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp playing Johnny Depp.)

 Too dark to be a kids movie and too whimsical for adults, Alice is a movie that will be mostly appreciated by those who live at Hot Topic.",1392854400,2,1113,4.5
3637769,3,B001HN6940,"This film could have been epic with a few minor changes. The special effects and 3D were very good, awesome in parts. Some of the characters were fantastic. Everyone recognized Johnny Depp's talented acting in the role of the Mad Hatter. Unfortunately, I found his eyes to be distracting. Makeup got it wrong there. I'm also surprised that not more people talked about Helena Bonham Carter in the role of the Red Queen. She was excellent in the role, and they couldn't have picked a better person for the part. I wish I could say the same about Anne Hathaway in the role of the White Queen. Wow! Really? She was the best they could do?! It's as if she thought just showing up and going through makeup and wardrobe would be enough. It wasn't! The same holds true for Mia in the role of Alice. You call that acting?! Considering Alice is the main character of the film, the role called for much more talent than Mia delivered. It's obvious that expense was not spared in making the film, so it's a puzzle as to why mediocre talent was chosen for such important roles. The fact that Johnny Depp gets top billing in a film that is not titled ""The Mad Hatter"" says it all. The Mad Hatter, The Red Queen, and the Tweedles were my favorite characters. If the producers had done as good a job choosing actors for the roles of Alice and The White Queen, the film could have risen to four stars. The fifth star would call for a more entertaining story line. Just a little more humor would have done the trick. I fell asleep twice trying to watch this. I did not give it a third try.

I have read some of the positive reviews here and can in no way add to the precision descriptions or enlightened conversations about the way the story did or did not unfold or the elegance in which it interlaces with the original story of Alice.

Instead, I have a completely different take.  This is a movie that is not for children but is for the child within the adult of people like me and many of the friends I grew up with in the 60's and 70's.

I did not compare it to anything.  My mind was open and while ready for was not prepared for the sheer entertainment of the intense visuals and comedic dryness of the many fantastic mini stories for which both this and the original are so well known.

Pure entertainment.  A vaudevillian story comprised of stories. Flip flash.

Currently I am the one and only IT consultant/manager/administrator for several small businesses.  When a business with 35 workers suddenly experienced a catastrophic system failure that launched me into a week of working around the clock with a sum total of 7 hours sleep in 8 days, I found that I had reached a point where I simply could not sleep.  My mind had been forced to remain on task for so long that it simply could not accept that it was time to call it a day.

I drove to the local theater instead of home.  I purchased a ticket for the next movie that was showing.

With zero expectation I walked into Alice in Wonderland (2010) not even realizing that Johnny Depp was a part of the movie.

Over the course of the next hour I slipped in and out of a state that can only be described as dreaming with eyes wide open.  I missed nothing and yet there seemed to be time gaps and all the while was entertained in a way that I can only relate to those days as a child when Looney Tunes had no more meaning to me than the sound of great music soothing my soul and  joining in a world of crazy characters as if I were one of them and yet knowing it was not real while not caring about the difference.

Suspension of reality.

Alice was exactly what I needed to leave the world of intense concentration that had been thrust upon me by the requirement to keep 35 people working against nearly impossible odds for a week with no chance to relax or slip into apathy.

Alice was like walking into a dream and when I left I felt satisfied and complete and went home and slept for 12 hours.

Let yourself be a grown up child and enjoy this masterpiece but do not bring any children.  It is an adult's child film and well worth seeing.",1385683200,,2569,4.266528925619835

As for the movie itself, it was AWESOME in 3D!!  This is, of course, the Alice in Wonderland movie of old but but with a little bit more cartoon-ish like characters and  scenery.  There are a few different things about this edition of AIW, but overall, it follows the same guidelines as the original.  With it being in 3D you not only have objects flying in your face, but the color and depth of the film is wonderful!  I also own this movie in 2D and there is really no contest on which one is better.

I would recommend using this Vendor that sold this DVD to me and also ""highly"" recommend getting this movie in 3D.",1385078400,,763,4.3546099290780145
3638158,4,B001HN6940,Bought this for my daughter.  Her dance class is doing a theater production of Alice and she wanted to see the whole story.  She has watched it several times so far.,1384300800,,165,4.290322580645161
3638206,5,B001HN6940,"Okay, let us get this out of the way:  This isn't the story created by Lewis Carroll, and it isn't like the cartoon that Disney put out originally.  I know it is put out by Disney, but it isn't the Alice in Wonderland we are all familiar with.  When you saw the name Tim Burton, this should have been a big clue.

The story does use many of the beloved characters from Lewis Carroll's story:  Caterpillar, Cheshire Cat, The Red Queen, Mad Hatter, White Rabbit, Tweedledee and Tweedledum, etc.  However, Tim Burton has created an entirely new story line that is a sequel to the original Alice story.

Alice is now grown up, and she has dismissed her memories of Wonderland as a fantastic dream.  While running away from a marriage proposal, she falls down the rabbit hole again.  Convinced she isn't the Alice everyone is looking for, she keeps waiting to wake up.  Meanwhile, she is being hunted by the Red Queen because it is only Alice who can save everyone from the Jabberwocky, which the Red Queen  used to steal the throne from her sister and to maintain control over her subjects.

The movie has a bit of a slow start at first, and it may not be embraced by the purists who want the original story.  However, I can appreciate this retelling and new story line.  I am a big Tim Burton fan, at least of his later works.  Though people often criticize him for putting his girlfriend and Johnny Depp in all his movies, I generally enjoy their acting.  I have to admit, this wasn't one of my favorite roles of Depp as the Mad Hatter.  I liked the portrayal of the character, which is shown as being more sensitive...but I don't know if I exactly liked Depp in the role.  He seemed a bit ""washed out"".  It was like seeing Jack Sparrow if he had been turned into an artistic nerd.

Helena Bonham Carter, though, was my absolute favorite as the Red Queen.  Though the Red Queen is still awful, there is a bit of a sympathy with her as well.  Personally, I was rooting for her.

I also really liked Alan Rickman as the Caterpillar, and I loved the Cheshire cat too!

This is kind of a ""coming into yourself"" type of story.  It was really delightful to see so many talented actors in one movie.",1384214400,,2190,4.388059701492537

3638208,4,B001HN6940,"I truly enjoyed Alice in Wonderland for its artistry.  The scenery was so colorful, the acting by the main characters, particularly Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter was stupendous.  They really know how to turn a phrase, and H B-C is one of my all-time favorite actresses.  I can usually depend on her to do something I will want to see.  The animation of the fantasy characters was so well done - the Cheshire, the red knights, the caterpillar, etc.",1383696000,,454,4.708860759493671
3638209,5,B001HN6940,"My children wanted to see this but I was skeptical. I'm not an Alice in Wonderland fan (no stones please). I never cared for the original book or the first movie at all. I watched this with my children though and I have to say, I actually enjoyed it much more than the original. This version just made so much more ""sense"" to me (as much sense as a nonsensical story can make). I can see why some who loved the original wouldn't like this version - it would be like taking a favorite song from your teen years and having someone re-make it. It's not the song you have so many fond memories attached to.  But since I had no prior attachments, I love this version!  I love Johnny Depp's portrayal - even if it was a bit creepy, it was more human and sensitive, even a bit romantic. I love all the characters more in this version!  I have a feeling we'll be watching this one again and again.",1383609600,,889,4.187134502923977

I waited with eager anticipation. When I finally saw it I felt richly rewarded! All my favorite characters and a few new interpretations of ones I had never seen before presented in the beloved familiar Burton style in a tale that is respectful of the classic but unique so as not to be redundant.

I was very irritated that the music and other sound effects were so deafeningly loud while most of the dialog was done in whispers. If you turn it up load enough to understand the various fantasy characters, you will be blown out of your chair by the music/sound effects. But it was quite refreshing to see the courage Alice gains from this experience and I felt the best part of the movie was in the last five minutes (after she leaves Wonderland).",1375660800,,580,4.37962962962963

3638386,3,B001HN6940,"But can't get past the ""meh"" feeling. I have a deep love of Tim Burton and of course Johnny Deep but this one always felt so rushed. There's never any down time for any of the characters so it constantly feels rushed. That's probably not a problem for most people but I found myself not caring about Alice (or any of the characters in fact) because there was never enough time for suspense to build or a threat to be established. It was just ""this is bad, oh no, now this is bad, eek, this is bad too!"". The gravity of the situations never really sunk in, so it never felt engaging, just eye candy. That and I've seen better acting from rocks than Alice, but again that's just me.

Visually it was a great movie and it definitely has Burton's spin to it. It does look great in Blu Ray as well so if you want something that looks pretty, pick this up.",1375056000,,850,4.182926829268292

He was flippant, deep, concerned, sorrowful in each of his scenes.  His voice as he quoted from ""Twas Brllig"" as he marched with Alice through the woods was profound.  Only Johnny Depp could have pulled that off.  Bravo!  As for Alice's intended, well, there is nothing more to be said.  He was her intended.  Her intention was not for him.  Her erstaz Father-n-Law was made of sterner stuff and recognized good business sense when he heard it.  I wonder how Alice is doing in China.

Depp is delightful as the Mad Hatter, and he gives real depth to a character which might otherwise be dismissed as a flake.  Mia W. as Alice is wonderful, and of course Helena Bonham-Carter is unrivaled as the horrible Red Queen.  Anne Hathaway is a great choice as the White Queen and a perfect foil for Bonham-Carter.

3638631,5,B001HN6940,"My orientation of ""Alice In Wonderland"" came primarily from the animated film version. I did not have an interest in any of the other film adaptations until this one came along. Johnny Depp has proved himself dependable in the world of fantasy with such hits as ""Sweeney Todd"" , ""Pirates of the Carribean"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"". He does not fail to impress as the ""Mad Hatter"". The characters were truly dreamy. There was never a second where your attention would wander elsewhere. Anne Hatheway charms as the ""White Queen"" but the true star was the ""Red Queen"". Kudos to the directors/producers for making her head huge and heart shaped. The action sequences were authentic enough but tame so that adults could enjoy the film just as much as kids will. I think this was a solid attempt at bringing a little fantasy back into the hearts and minds of us all. No detail was left unattended in this film. The design of the costumes, characters and set were all wonderful. If you are a fan of ""Alice in Wonderland"" then you will adore this movie.",1359763200,,1046,4.65945945945946

Not surprisingly, Johnny Depp as the Mad hatter dominates the screen. Still there are quite a few other fun performances.

Altho I said ""a little bit more for adults"" it is still rated PG, and fine for all but the smallest viwerers.

His characters are always really quirky, intriguing, and well played.  It is hard to believe they are all just the one guy (and to see him off screen you'd never be able to imagine him in these quirky parts).  No, he's not the star of this film, but I probably would not have bought it if it hadn't had Johnny Depp in it.

As for the rest of the film, I found it to be quite draggy at the start and then it got interesting.  It is night-and-day different from the original Disney animation film.  But this new film does follow the original Lewis Carrol work more closely.  This film is dark and strange ... just like the original stories//poems.

Kids will enjoy the action but they'd probably enjoy the older ""cartoon"" film more.",1357516800,,857,4.407643312101911

I give five stars to the movie itself -- I absolutely love it and I'm not a big Tim Burton fan either. I also hated the book when I was a kid, tried reading it a couple times, and just thought it was stupid (well you know how kids are!), but I love this version of the story! But as far as the manufacturing is concerned... I won't give away anything, will just say late in the movie you're watching one scene and it pauses and then jumps to another scene. Since it's on both dvds that I purchased I can't tell how much in between is lost. The rest of the dvd runs fine. Maybe I just got a hold of two bad copies, but I'm not about to buy a third!

3638684,1,B001HN6940,"I'm a big Alice in Wonderland fan, I've read Alice's Adventures in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass and of course as any genuine fan, grew up on and absolutely cherish the original Walt Disney Classic (one of Disney's favorite stories as well). On that note, this movie is total garbage.

I first hear Tim Burton (who I for a long time idolized) is doing an Alice in Wonderland interpretation and I initially hear a few years prior to the films release that it may be a dark stop action/live action film, ala The Nightmare Before Christmas with a live action Alice, which could have been pretty awesome. Much time passes and pictures of the characters start surfacing, I'm already worried at this point but I decide to trust Tim as I did with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which probably could have been much worse. This movie fails miserably on every level, acting, set design, costumes, dialogue, story, music, Avril Lavigne doing a song in a Tim Burton movie, what's up with that?!

All the people that will like this movie are new age yuppies. The 3D gimmick only works well on a few films, this was not one of them. The film was originally not shot in 3D but because of the success of Avatar it was redone to get a better box office exit with it's shorter gap from the cinema to DVD. Beware of the ridiculous ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" Scottish accent and embarrassing dance coming from Johnny Depp's disgracefully portrayed Mad Hatter.",1356393600,5,1450,4.682352941176471

3638734,3,B001HN6940,"This telling of Alice in Wonderland uses all the modern techniques and technology but it puts a few twists into the familiar story.  The effects are quite good and almost hallucinogenic, but the variations of the original story don't seem to be necessary, although I suppose they help to give us a new slant on things. I'd like to have seen more of some of the key creatures, such as the Cheshire cat, the caterpillar, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, etc. Maybe Disney's animated version just overpowers anything after having been in the brain for a few decades.
The 3-D works well, having sent my wife ducking once or twice. The effect isn't overly done; when things do come at you it doesn't seem like it's done just to show off how well the 3-D works, but instead it just seems like part of the story.
I don't want you to get the idea that this is a poor version. It's a quality piece of work, but for me, I'm just as glad that I got it on 3-D BluRay rather than paid for the theatrical release.

3638780,5,B001HN6940,"Alice visits Wonderland as a child and grows up believing it as just a dream before it calls to her again, this time seeking a Champion to free Wonderland from the Tyranny of the Red Queen and regain the crown for the White Queen. While in the original story, the Jabberwoky was rather different, in some variations he is depicted as a dragon-like creature, so this is not new. The Red Queen has always been depicted as a tyrant,and it can be assumed that she might consider extending her reign during the time of Alice's absence from Wonderland. People tend to forget that Fairy Tales are not all sweetness and light, some can be extremely dark and this story focuses on this aspect as it mirrors Alice's dilemma in real life as a free spirit  who finds her life literally scoped out for her in a stiflingly arranged situation to a weak milquetoast nobleman. It is in Wonderland that she discovers her power as she reluctantly accepts the challenge of killing the Jabberwocky and takes over her own life once she reemerges from the rabbithole to reality and refuses to play the faceless wife while seeking a new destiny. This movie was beautiful without being ""cutesy"". It depicted Wonderland as more of a nightmare and the Hatter was a wild wonderful mad catalyst to spark Alice's discovery of self. It was dark, but there were still elements of fun and I found the movie enjoyable overall as different from other stories. I can accept this as Alice's last venture into Wonderland as a wild dark romp as Alice seeks to save the friends she made over the times she had visited before before leaving Wonderland forever to take up adventuring for real.",1350777600,2,1651,4.654109589041096

3638784,1,B001HN6940,"There's nothing wonderful about Tim Burton's adaption of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland; a fantasy novel by Lewis Carroll. It's one of the most popular children's stories American culture has to offer. I remember attending a stage-play version of it back in elementary school. But I don't remember it being this bad.

This is a movie without a clear plotline. The visuals; the costumes and set designs that make-up Wonderland; are artsy and imaginative. That's one thing a Tim Burton presentation virtually guarantees. But the story, which lands a girl named Alice in an impossible dreamworld of sorts, fails to captivate or even intrigue.

Even worse is the characterization. I especially hate Johnny Depp as the incredibly annoying Mad Hatter and the cringe-inducing ""futterwacken"" dance he does, which an otherwise likeable Alice mimics near the end. It's just so stupid and pointless, as is the whole movie. Shame on Tim Burton for ruining childhood memories.

3638785,4,B001HN6940,"This is one in a series of posted reviews for every Alice in Wonderland title available on Amazon. When the Tim Burton rendition of AIW with Johnny Depp was due out in 2010 I thought it might be a good time to go back and watch the benchmark Walt Disney production from 1951, which I saw -or assumed I saw- as a child. It was a chance to get reacquainted with the many varied characters from the story as sort of a warm up for the Burton film. Upon viewing the Disney classic I was astonished to realize that I had likely never seen more than a few clips (at most) of that beautifully rendered Alice in Wonderland. So much seemed brand new. Nor did I have a memory of ever seeing any other ""Alice"" production. Then I realized that I had never read the book! Wait a minute. Where then did my memory of the Alice story come from? The curiosity sparked by that question ultimately led me over the next two years to accumulate every version of Alice in Wonderland still in existence. Well over 40 by the way!

This general commentary continues as a posted review for both the 1951 AIW production from Walt Disney and the 2010 production starring Johnny Depp (this title), as these are the two most well known Alice's. Rather than attempt to add yet-another-review here, it seemed like it might be a more fun use of the provided space to muse for a bit on the popularity and remarkable longevity of the story spawned by Lewis Carroll in 1865, as well as to share with you a bit of what I picked up while watching these 40 or so renderings of Alice in Wonderland. All other Alice productions listed by Amazon will have a specific review of the relevant production with same title used throughout.

To continue...
I claim to be neither a Lewis Carroll nor an Alice in Wonderland expert. Rather, I went into this project naive... ignorant of the details of the story of Alice in Wonderland... ignorant of the poems within the story, and certainly ignorant of the comings and goings in Lewis Carroll's life that set up the circumstances allowing him to imagine the story of Alice in Wonderland (originally entitled ""Alice's Adventures Underground"", by the way).

Watching that 1951 Disney rendition of AIW was a remarkable experience. It was fun to ""remember"" the story of Alice again, but also, it left me with a desire to see how else the Alice story has been rendered. The Disney film is of course animation. So how would Alice in Wonderland be portrayed in other mediums? What I learned is that AIW has been rendered in about every way you can imagine. Most familiar of course is the telling of the Alice story in film, with live action, animation, and various combinations of both. In fact since the invention of film at the turn of the 20th century not a decade has gone where at least one (and usually several) fresh renderings of the Alice story been told in moving pictures.

Beyond that however the Alice story has been told in many forms: audio recordings, plays, ballets, operas, and musicals. It's been done with the use of puppets and marionettes, with stop motion ""Gumby style"" animation, in games, in home-brew backyard productions posted to YouTube, and as an Alice in Wonderland theme park. There's even been an X rated version done as a musical (quite good). A number of established shows have done a take on the Alice story; The Muppets, Sesame Street, The Care Bears, Betty Boop, Mickey Mouse, Barney, Scooby Doo, The Simpsons, Star Trek TOS, and even `Hello Kitty' took a shot at Alice.

What's more, a wide variety of famous actors and celebrities have appeared in an Alice film. Stars from W.C. Fields to Cary Grant to Peter Sellers to Richard Burton... The Smothers Brothers, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Dudley Moore, Brooke Shields, Maryl Streep, Debbie Allen, Nathan Lane, Sammy Davis Jr., Ringo Starr, Terry Garr, and Whoopi Goldberg, just to name a few, have been involved in some sort of Alice production.

And then there are the numerous Alice based endeavors, from Woody Allan's `Alice' with Mia Farrow, to Jefferson Airplane's `White Rabbit'.

Why? Why is Lewis Carroll's story of a young girl who fell down a mythical rabbit hole so compelling? What gives the story such staying power? How is it that people of virtually all ages are so inexplicably drawn toward Alice and her land of wonders?

I don't know.

I've tried to steer clear of scholarly answers that address that question. There have been many attempts to do so. On the surface we can locate several plausible reasons that explain why Alice in Wonderland resonates with so many. We have a young, [seemingly] helpless girl. She's an underdog. Out of her element. A vulnerable character put in jeopardy. We ask, ""what will happen next?"", as the story takes one unexpected turn after another. And of course animals with human attributes in any story is compelling. Walt Disney discovered that innate attraction and made an industry of it. But do these answers get to the heart of the question?

I happen to believe the explanation of Alice in Wonderland's universal appeal is that we, all of us, all human beings, young and old, have been to Wonderland ourselves. We go there in our dreams. We can all relate to the experience of logic and proportion falling away because it has happened to us. We understand how, in all the bizarreness of the wonderlands we fall into at night, that we rarely lose our heads. We should be really scared. Alice should be really scared. But somehow we accept what we see. Such is the worlds of dreams.

Furthermore, how many of us have wondered if we continue to dream after we die? Are dreams what the afterlife is composed of? We don't fully understand the nature of dreams, so we contemplate upon them. Even the errant machine HAL in 2001 A Space Odyssey asked if he would dream after he was turned off.

And now to return to the original question I postulated. How did I somehow know the story of Alice in Wonderland without having a particular recollection of reading the book? Or seeing a movie? One answer of course is that pieces of the story just leaked into my consciousness over the years. A movie clip here. A verbal explanation there. But could there be a deeper reason? It may have to do with ""archetype"". It is certain that Alice in Wonderland acts as a metaphor for dreams, but the Alice Stories seems to delve deeper... into a primal archetype --a ""template"" if you will-- out of which human circumstances arise. Because of that we recognize Alice's dilemma in a deep and fundamental way.

To write the story of Alice in Wonderland Lewis Carroll had in some way become conscious of the meta-physical world. The world beyond normal perception. A world that is, as Rod Serling put it, ""beyond that which is known to man"". Whereas visual artists such as Hieronymus Bosch reflected their visions of the other-world in paintings, Lewis Carroll's palette was paper and words. I would not be surprised if Carroll had at some point and in some fashion become ""experienced"", in a Jimmy Hendrix sort of way.

Anyway, enjoy every telling of the Alice story you can get your hands on. Each one is unique. It's fascinating to see how the core Alice story is manifested in different media. It's fun to see how the various animals are rendered. If you can, read the books first. If you can't, remember that anything to with a playing card motif, the King and Queen of Hearts, the Knave of Hearts, the stolen tarts, the Duchess, falling down the rabbit hole and the pool of tears, the White Rabbit, growing and shrinking, the Mad Hatter (and tea party), Bill the Lizard, the Caterpillar, the Cheshire Cat, the March Hare, the Dormouse, the Mock Turtle, and the Gryphon, -phew- all come from Alice in Wonderland.

A motif based upon a chessboard, The Red King and Queen, the White King and Queen, the Red Knight and White Knight, the Jabberwocky, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Humpty Dumpty, the Lion and the Unicorn, Hatta and Haighaa (a disguised appearance by the Mad Hatter and the March Hare), and the The Walrus and the Carpenter come from Through the Looking Glass.

You'll find that many renderings of Alice in Wonderland combine elements of both books, and you know...

Not everyone likes what's often been done
turning the story of Alice on ear
but I say, it's in the spirit of fun
there's really nothing at all to fear

so what if Tim Burton brought forth Tweedledum and Tweedledee
And introduced Alice to the ja-bber-wock-y
It's been done by others dontcha see
he named the movie from the first book
but he didn't stop there
he poured in the latter... yet kept the Hatter!
gotta tell-you-the-truth, I just don't care

in the end we all know who killed the ja-bber-wock-y
it was done in plain site for all to see
The vorpal sword was manned by that girl
The blonde
With the curls
that unfurl
or was it a boy who did the deed?
From the poem. Didn't he succeed?
Gonna have to give that book another read

so yeah
you-know-what?
it's really O-K.
It's all just a dream an-y-old-way

of the many many versions of this fine tale
hardly any of the a-dap-ta-tions fail
they've all been done with narry a shred of malice
all in all it's in the spirit of our dear friend Alice

so go visit Netflix
Amazon
and Youtube
No one will care...
An Alice you'll love will be waiting there
And if the telling don't exactly track Mr. Dodgson's theme
Like we said before... it's only a dream

3638819,5,B001HN6940,"While we have seen this cast in several other movies before, they do a wonderful job in this adaptation in Alice in Wonderland.  The quirkiness of Wonderland is on full display with every character involved.  Some enthusiasts of the original may look at this movie as slightly blasphemous because of the change in tone and situation but I feel the changes are fantastic and well thought out.

Alice in Wonderland is remarkably intelligent and witty while keeping the audience ensnared with a complex use of colors to bring Wonderland to life.  It feels like Alice was JUST in Wonderland and has not actually gotten older.  The multiple references to being THE Alice is at first confusing because one would think the creatures of Wonderland would remember her forever.  However, upon subsequent viewings of the movie, one realizes the importance of these references.  The creatures constantly asking if this is the REAL Alice shows their true suspicion and their hesitance to believe anyone that is not known and among them.

All in all this is one of my favorite movies currently out there and will probably stay there for a very long time.  I purchased this because I had the movie on my DVR for about a year and a half before it was automatically deleted (which I was quite unhappy about).  I decided then that it was time to simply add it to my collection and the price I paid was fantastic.

3638837,2,B001HN6940,"It's been a long time since I watched the original Alice in Wonderland and I was never all too partial to it so I went into this not biased against a remake. I didn't see this in the theaters and didn't see this in 3D (just did the Instant Video just now) and I found it rather boring.

I didn't particularly care what was happening to Alice. It was visually stunning but it wasn't enough to keep my interest. In fact, I kept wondering about the real world and how Alice was going to answer Hamish and deal with her cheating brother-in-law more than I cared about her killing the Jabberwocky. I mean, it's obvious she would become the real Alice at the end, and take up the mantle of the Champion so of course she was going to kill the damned monster. There was no urgency to the story since it was so predictable. And that made it quite boring in my mind.

But maybe the 3D effects would have made up for the lackluster plot, like it did with Avatar. But since I didn't see it with them, I came out of this movie supremely underwhelmed. And I wish I had spent my money (not to mention my time!) on something else.",1338249600,,1114,4.200934579439252

It's colorful, amusing and very entertaining (the imagination that went into making the characters come to life, the sets and all the people who pulled it off were top notch!)

3638840,5,B001HN6940,"Not your childhood Alice by any means. Tim Burton directed it, Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter, and the voice of the hookah-smoking caterpillar is Alan Rickman (aka Professor Snape). A lovely young Mia Wasikowska plays Alice as a 19-year-old who has followed a rabbit in a waistcoat down a rabbit hole to escape a put-up job of an engagement party to a total twirp of a young lord.

This one answers a question I had as a child: why did Alice's clothes shrink and grow when she did? In this one, they do not. When she's tiny, and hiding in a tea pot so that the knave of hearts won't find her, Hatter fashions a little dress for her from the shreds of the dress (or maybe chemise?) she was wearing as of the earlier shrinking. Then when she's in the Red Queen's garden and grows very large, she is hiding behind some trees because she ""outgrew"" her clothes.

The story is that this is (or is not?) the same Alice who was in Underland when she was a child, and called it Wonderland. This time her mission is to take up the Vorpel sword and slay the Jabberwock.

The funniest character in the story is the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) who has an enormous head -- literally. Also an enormous ego. She has a sort of lisp, and sounds a lot like Madeline Kahn. In fact, I was surprised to find that the actress was one I had not heard of before; the sound of her voice was so familiar.

Great fun, especially if you can put aside any expectation that it follows the original story.",1336694400,,1480,4.293906810035843

And the nerve to name the movie Alice in Wonderland. It's not that story. They should've named it Return to Wonderland: The Battle to Make a Harry Potter movie with Alice Characters.",1335916800,5,530,4.589473684210526
3638842,5,B001HN6940,"I bought this DVD for the 3D effects because I had seen the movie before on a regular TV and thought the visual aspects were just gorgeous. The colors, characters, special effects and whole production were excellent. So I was expecting some great 3D effects with some of the chase and battle scenes. The movie had good depth and 3D presentation and it made you feel like you were in there in many parts, but one of the things I like in 3D are the ""out of screen"" effects, where objects look like they're jumping out from the TV screen and ending up in the middle of your room. While some things seemed to slightly stand out, the only real out of screen effect was a butterfly flying out at the very end. Still, the 3D added a lot to an already stunning movie.

The original Alice in Wonderland scared the crap out of me when I was a kid. That caterpillar was scarey looking and when that baby that Alice was holding turned into a pig...ugh! The only part I liked back then was the Mad Hatter. So when I heard that Johnny Depp and Anne Hathaway were starring in this new version, well, they're two of my favorite actors, so I had to see it. Helena Bonham Carter who played the Red Queen was just amazing. The animated characters were very unique too. I really enjoyed this version. And the storyline was quite a bit different than the first.

So, would I buy this movie again for the 3D? Although it didn't have many of the oos effects, I would because it definitely enhanced a movie that I already liked for it's regular effects. But I would rate the 3D as 4 stars and the movie overall as 5.",1335571200,4,1592,4.285714285714286

3638900,5,B001HN6940,"I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan, but I do like a few of his movies. I wasn't particularly interested in seeing this version of Alice in Wonderland which puts a twist on the Alice in Wonderland story that I grew up with. But, when we purchased a 3D TV, I thought it might be a great addition to our 3D DVD library.

The peaceful world of Wonderland became the nightmarish world known as Underland under the villainous Red Queen's reign. Alice doesn't recall visiting Wonderland as a child, but was having recurring nightmares about her experiences in Wonderland. When nineteen year old Alice falls down a rabbit hole, she is transported to Underland where the residents remember her & have been waiting for her return to rescue them from the evil Red Queen. Johnny Depp plays an excellent Mad Hatter; Helena Bonham Carter, the Red Queen with the big head...no HUGE head, is an excellent villain. I could go on to praise everyone in this movie, the casting was perfect. The Bandersnatch, a ferocious creature under the Red Queen's rule & the Jabberwocky, a terrifying dragon type creature used by the Red Queen as a weapon, might terrify younger children.

My whole family enjoyed it from its beginning to the end. The colors, atmosphere, characters, costumes & 3D effects make this movie visually exciting. (There were a couple scenes which had minor parallax problems; I'm the only one in the family that noticed them) This is one movie where 3D definitely adds to its visual entertainment.

This Combo set contains  4 discs: DVD, Blu-ray, Blu-ray 3D & Digital (you can download a digital copy to your Mac or PC in ITunes or Windows Media format, use the code to transfer & watch the movie on your computer or compatible portable device.)

3638902,3,B001HN6940,"Adaptations can be difficult to pull off. Even if you're not adapting a work that is particularly well known among the masses you have to look at how the source material speaks to you and what you want to say to the audience with your film. Beyond that you have to consider what you possibly might need to change in your adaptation to make the source more cinematically viable. If you're working on a project that is ingrained in the public consciousness, or adapted previously into a universally adored film, then the line you walk can feel like the green mile.

Tim Burton has had a lot of experience with film adaptations, making massive hits with Batman, Batman Returns, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (which is not a remake, but that's a discussion for another blog post). He's also at times shown a capacity for not really understanding the source material. For his adaptation of Alice in Wonderland for Disney Burton said, ""It's a funny project. The story is obviously a classic with iconic images and ideas and thoughts. But with all the movie versions, well, I've just never seen one that really had any impact to me. It's always just a series of weird events. Every character is strange and she's just kind of wandering through all of the encounters as just a sort of observer,"" but such observations ignore that this was Lewis Carroll's intention in his writing. In the end though, Burton's film became only the sixth film to gross more than $1 billion worldwide.

Alice Kingsleigh (Mia Wasikowska) is 19 years old and on the verge of getting engaged to a man she doesn't love. But when she sees a white rabbit she feels compelled to follow it down the rabbit hole (so to speak). When she arrives in Wonderland, a place that she has been to before but doesn't remember, she's confronted by various creatures telling her that she's the wrong Alice. Soon she learns that on the fateful Frabjous Day she is supposed to become the champion of the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and slay the Jabberwocky to restore the kingdom from the clutches of the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).

Tim Burton has a tendency to view the world through dark shades. If Armani made a pair of gothic sunglasses they would belong to Burton. For a film like Alice and Wonderland which is known for its bright Day-Glo colors he might not seem like the right choice to direct, but in the end his style works well for his interpretation of the source material. You still have the bright colors and Burton retains some of the tones of outrageous zaniness that were present in the Carroll stories and in previous incarnations of the tale.

A relative newcomer to the Hollywood stage, Wasikowska is the biggest acting surprise of the movie. She adds a certain gravitas that grounds the flick when it could have easily been lost in its excesses, and it could serve Wasikowska far beyond films of this nature. Helena Bonham Carter (whose casting in Burton films has been blamed on nepotism) steals every scene that she's in. She's typically brilliant and the choice to not hold back in this particular performance allows her to reign as an evil queen should. I must make a note here on Johnny Depp who more than a few people have made a note that he seems to be unable to properly act anymore without donning crazy makeup and disguises. Here I feel that the Mad Hatter he plays was taken in a hopelessly dark direction that should have been lightened up quite a bit more. Although watching the film I did look forward to his ""Scottish"" freak outs.

There's a certain detachment from the material of the movie though. I don't really feel that Burton actually invested much of himself into this flick the way he did with, say, Nightmare on Elm Street or Ed Wood. His view of the world here, that imagination builds confidence, feels generic at the end of the day as if he were a hired hand who felt the need to put his stamp on the film out of necessity rather than artistically. The animation borders on ironic, which in 2D works quite well, but didn't hold up as well in the initial 3D viewing. Also, I felt the end was compromised slightly by the Mad Hatter's Futterwacken which seemed a bit too modern styled to fit with the rest of the narrative. In the end it just ended up being corny.

Critically, this turned out to be Burton's third least enjoyed films among critics. (Planet of the Apes being his critical worst and Mars Attacks! which I think is underrated, not being far behind.) That's interesting considering Tim Burton only has three films that are considered by Rotten Tomatoes to be rotten. In my humble but honest opinion this is far from Burton's best film, but it's also not that close to being his worst film. I recommend you give it a try if you haven't already. It's a fun flick even if it isn't quite as perfect as I, or even some of you, wanted it to be.

So to get me to see a Burton film,let alone review one,has got to take some doing. A friend of mine got after me repeatedly to watch this,so I finally caved. I found Burtons heavy hand again and a totally miscast and uninteresting Alice in Mia Wasakowska. The movie only really starts to come to life once she is down the rabbit hole under the tree,before and after is sheer boredom. But I found it interesting enough to give it at least an average mark.
The story involves Carroll`s beloved character of Alice here betrothed to a rather obnoxious society Lord. As he proposes in a gazebo under the scrutiny of all at the huge garden soiree,she spies a rabbit and excuses herself to run after it. She finds a large hole underneath of a tree and tumbles into it. After attempts at growing and shrinking she finally enters Wonderland. She apparently has been there before but it takes almost the entire film for her to realize her strange dreams over the years were based on real events. She runs into a plethora of Wonderland characters including Tweedledum and Tweedledee,the White Rabbit,the blue Caterpillar,the Dormouse,The Cheshire cat,the March Hare,among many,many others. What she discovers is this land is ruled by the psychotic Queen of Hearts,she of the bulbous head and deadly swift temper.
At one point Alice comes upon a long table at which sits the dormouse,the March Hare and the Mad Hatter. Depp is a master of the exotic and strange in his characters and this is no exception,as he embues the Hatter with the right mix of madness,a marvelous vulnerability and pathos,all wrapped up in a kind heart. Over time Alice becomes mixed up in the ruling Queens court and finds the Vorpal sword which is the only thing capable of killing the Jaberwocky(a dragon like creature),a venture she is destined to perform. She escapes with it to the White Queen,the Queen of Hearts nice sister,who previously ruled wonderland. In the meantime the Hatter has been arrested but he escapes and provokes an uprising against the Queen of Hearts. The resistance,for the moment,is quashed but the `rebels`escape to the White Queen. There they amass,regroup and return in a final epic battle with the Queen of Hearts troops.
It is now Frabjous Day,the day of the final battle and the day Alice,with Vorpal sword in hand,and dressed in battle armour,confronts the Jabberwocky. In the end all is returned to normal as the Queen of Hearts and her consort,the Knave of Hearts,are banished from the kingdom. Alice says a farewell to her friends and returns to the ``real`` world above. Little time has passed since she left and she returns to the gazebo,refuses the request for marriage and enters into a mutually beneficial business partnership with her uncle.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp and is in its original a/r of 1:78:1. Extras include three featurettes on the making of the film.
All in all just an average Burton entry. It would have gotten higher marks if the film had been more interesting in the pre and post Wonderland sequences. Also Mia Wasakowska is totally miscast and a bore as Alice,with little or no life in her portrayal. Depp is the entire show here,along with Carroll`s wonderful Wonderland characters and with Helena Bonham Carter coming in in third place. For Depp fans this is a must. For the rest of us...the usual.",1325289600,,4063,4.814020028612303

3638919,3,B001HN6940,"When a marriage is seemingly perfect, it's hard to even think of the alternative extreme; that is, so catastrophically imperfect that the divorce papers are in and out quicker than Jason Vorhees at a sorority.

As it turns out, Burton's potential magnum opus transcends neither realm, deeming it extraordinarily...average.  Did anyone see it coming?  Certainly not I.  The themes, set pieces, presentation, talent, and overall legacy seem far too absurd and unapologetically mad (hatter) to be anything but so-so.  Well, leave it to Burton to surprise us.

Truth be told, there are some things that were never questioned.  Among those are Burton's sprawling imagination, and how it translates to the big screen.  Let it be known that, yes, Wonderland is a visual treat, even post-Avatar, with the real pleasure in witnessing the eccentric director's surreal character portrayals.  Dare I say that never before have computer graphics and kinetic, real-life performances been meshed together so well?  It's all very easy to take for granted but, given the source material and setting, that's what makes it such a success.

Unfortunately, and damned if I could see it coming, everything else is sacrificed before the great pedestal of visual awe:  character development, pacing, and even, to an extent, the charming and endless wonder that accompanied the original.  It's a pretty package, to be sure, but not something that surprises as much as satisfies.  That said, you look at Burton's Wonderland and it's difficult to suppose how it could have been any other way, even with all of its glaring flaws.  It's a fan service, to be sure, and those who have stood by it for all of these years will be pleased.

For everyone else - critics included - you just can't give it all a free pass.

While it is largely lacking in charm, bittersweet glimpses are found in the spontaneous performances by an all-star cast that was impeccably chosen.  Relative newcomer Mia Wasikowska is everything a new-age Alice should be, even if she's really nothing but wavy hair and somber eyes.  That said, she often spreads her wings to show us what this young actress is capable of, and I expect great things from her in the future.

And, while the other cast members are tried-and-true companions that are synonymous with the mythology of Burton, a few notable efforts rise above what it typical.  Michael Sheen delivers the biggest laughs as the cracked out, punctual rabbit; Glover, Hathaway, Bonham Carter, and Fry all fall into the ""acceptable"" category, with none going too far out of their comfort zones to please; andMatt Lucas presents himself as the twins so well that, had more screen time been given to him (er, them?) I'd go so far as to say that he'd have stolen the show.

Alas, that accolade predictably belongs to Depp, who's a virtual shoe-in for yet another performance that pre-pubescent girls will be idolizing for years.

It all sounds rather fun, yes?  Well, who's to say that it isnt?  Burton is a fine director with a loyal fanbase, and his heart is certainly in Wonderland, even if we can't really see it on the big screen.  There's nothing to discourage one from joining Alice on her intriguing - albeit unspectacular - adventure.  Just be sure to have a mind open for all of it, and don't dwell too long on any one thing, for you would certainly go bonkers, senile, at your wit's end.",1324166400,,3390,4.870855148342059

3638925,5,B001HN6940,"I'm not a huge Tim Burton fan, but I do like a few of his movies.  I wasn't particularly interested in seeing this version of Alice in Wonderland which puts a twist on the Alice in Wonderland story that I grew up with. But, when we purchased a 3D TV, I thought it might be a great addition to our  3D DVD library.

The peaceful world of Wonderland became the nightmarish world known as Underland under the villainous Red Queen's reign.  Alice doesn't recall visiting Wonderland as a child, but was having recurring nightmares about her experiences in Wonderland.  When nineteen year old Alice falls down a rabbit hole, she is transported to Underland where the residents remember her & have been waiting for her return to  rescue them from the evil Red Queen. Johnny Depp plays an excellent Mad Hatter; Helena Bonham Carter, the Red Queen with the big head...no huge head, is an excellent villain. I could go on to praise everyone in this movie, the casting was perfect. The Bandersnatch, a ferocious creature under the Red Queen's rule & the  Jabberwocky, a terrifying dragon type creature used by the Red Queen as a weapon might terrify younger children.

My whole family enjoyed it from its beginning to the end. The colors, atmosphere, characters, costumes & 3D effects make this movie visually exciting. (There were a couple scenes which had  minor parallax problems; I'm the only one in the family that noticed them)  This is one movie where 3D definitely adds to its visual entertainment.  5 Stars",1321660800,,1504,4.768339768339768
3638926,4,B001HN6940,"Even though the storyline follows nearly the same path as the Disney classic and Lewis Carroll's beloved work, it derails itself from the set path by mid-movie.  And thank goodness for that.  This is a sequel of sorts to our original Disney film where a young Alice tumbles down the rabbit hole to encounter Wonderland for the first time.  Instead of that, Burton takes the reins and makes Alice 19 and about to be wed to a rather frumpy young gentleman.  She flees, following her imagination of a rabbit skittering about the grounds of her future in-laws property, only to find herself tumbling down yet another rabbit hole to Wonderland.  She has forgotten much of what she remembers from her first encounter in Wonderland and chalks the experience up as a mere dream.  However, as she become more and more involved she finds that Wonderland truly is real and what she does there matters.

Although Tim Burton relies heavily on the stories that Lewis Carroll has already set into place this is right up his alley.  Carroll and him could have had long discussions over tea about such fanciful, near delusional, half mad contrivances.  The compatibility of the two creators is perfect.  Burton throws his own flair into the film at every turn and provides the stories and poems that we are all familiar with.

With the talents of Johnny Depp, Mia Wasikowska, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, with a wide array of talented voice actors, we are greeted with a stunning performance by all in this incredible display of computer technology melting with live action so seamlessly it's hard to tell what is real and what isn't at times, which fits well into the theme.

One problem I have is that Alice becomes our heroine in a far too heroic sense.  It definitely deviates a bit sharply from the original stories and concepts lent to us by Carroll and so is a bit farfetched.  However, the part is well conceived by Mia Wasikowska and the other supporting cast.

A superbly portrayed, layered duality also exists in this film.  There are connections to all that knows Alice in the ""real world"" and in her ""imaginative world"".  It's a simply stunning two hours that will blow you away if you let it.  Allow for the oddities as Carroll would and you have a perfectly wonderful film.",1321401600,2,2279,4.726582278481013

Johnny Depp is wonderful as the ""Hatter"" and we gain an acceptable explanation for his ""madness"" that I felt was very moving.  Mia Wasakowska is well cast as Alice and her performance is brilliant.  A very talented young and beautiful actress that I also enjoyed in the recent version of Jane Eyre.  I will want to see her in what she does in the future.  Helena Carter as the Red Queen is also great and has several hilarious lines, ""I just love a warm pig belly for my aching feet"" cracks me up every time.

What I can attest to is how beautiful and entertaining Tim Burton's version was. I've read several reviews from those who did not care much about this film. Those who hated the deviation from the original story. Those who hated the deviation from the animated film. Those who thought it was another fantastical, yet watered down, version of Tim Burton's imagination. I suppose all of those opinions could be true. However, while I can understand how tired it is to continue seeing Depp in a lot of makeup and playing what appears to be the same character with a different voice in yet another Tim Burton movie, the fact is, this was a Disney feature film. It wasn't budgeted for Tim to go all ""Tim Burton"" on it. It needed to appeal to kids and adults alike, and this film greatly achieved that. Disney is using the most colorful and imaginative director to bring to life another Disney classic in order to achieve the same success as Pirates of the Caribbean. Adults and children alike are very familiar with Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, so to have expected anything more than what was delivered was unrealistic. To go farther Tim Burtonesque would have resulted in a movie Disney would not have been able to market. To move further away from Tim Burton would have watered down what Tim is good at.

3638985,5,B001HN6940,"I don't believe this movie deserved the slam it's been getting in a lot these reviews. I understand that some are upset that it was completely different from Lewis Carroll's original, but this is basically a sequel. It was not made to be exactly like the book. However, Tim Burton provided all the correct elements to make sure it didn't lack any necessary components to make sure it would not create a completely different land from Lewis's original book or the Disney movie. Though I do not suggest it for small children for some characters and scenes that could very easily frighten them.

Actually, I think this was much better than the book. Tim gives it a story line that has a purpose. I did very much like the book, but the basic story line was Alice goes into Wonderland and wakes up to find it was a dream. However, with Tim's sequel Alice is called to Wonderland by the White Rabbit to help the White Queen defeat the Red Queen (previously known as The Queen of Hearts). When Alice discovers this she denies being able to do it and ends up getting caught up in a series of events chain-linked to each other. These events, of course, include the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Hatter. All the while, Alice is slowly finding pieces of herself she had lost from her childhood. She re-becomes herself through the movie.

The graphics were simply put as amazing. Graphically wise, this was Tim Burton's best work yet. Though also his most recent. Out of completely green-screened scenes, and even some green-screened costumes, he created this world and some of the characters. Yet, it stayed sharp and very real-looking.

The actors/actresses played their characters very well. Johnny Depp, appearing in a lot of Tim's movies, always plays the oddball character very well, and this time he was perfect for the Mad Hatter. Mia Wasikowska was made for Alice, and seemed to very well understand her character's personality. And as for the Red Queen, played by Helena Bonham Carter, you could not have picked a better one. All the other characters seemed to play their characters very well and had the face to make the character believable.

So overall, this movie was not made to be like an Alice in Wonderland before but as a sequel. It still included all the elements to keep it still like the Wonderland we are used to. I would not suggest if for small children because of possibly frightening characters and scenes. Also, Tim Burton has given the story-line an ultimate purpose and conclusion. The graphics were extremely good. And the actors/actresses were all perfect for each part. This movie made it into my top five favorite movies the first time I saw it in the theater.",1310515200,,2677,4.713675213675214
3638986,3,B001HN6940,"I used to be a huge Tim Burton fan, but like many directors and writers he lost his edge somewhere along the way. In the late 80s and early 90s he was responsible for some of the most creative, visually stunning and most interesting films I had ever seen; now he is often at the helm of some of the most boring.
Tim Burton has oftentimes had success creating bleak and somewhat depressing tales for children that also appeal to adults and he usually drags Johnn Depp (and in recent years Helena Bonham Carter) along for the ride, so it was really no surprise when I found out he was doing Alice and that it would star who it did, but based on other recent collaborations between the three of them I remained skeptical of what the end result would be.
Here is my main thing: When CGI is done properly it is a thing of wonder and when it is done poorly it can ruin an otherwise acceptable film. The CG in this movie is overwhelming and more-often-than-not, overwhelmingly bad. I am a little confused by why they didn't just make this an animated film, because they chose to animate just about everything. Even things there was no reason to CG! Like the knight's horse. There is no reason on Earth why they couldn't stick a man on a real horse for a few galloping and rearing scenes. Instead they chose to stick him on a horribly unrealistic looking CG horse whose leg movements do not even attempt to mimic those of a natural horse. Same with the bloodhound. and the CGI work on Helena Bonham Carter's character is so poor I'm not even going to get into it in detail in this review.
However, I can't complain about all the CGI. The backgrounds and landscape of Wonderland are, for the most part, beautifully done and embodies the artistry and imagination that made Tim Burton so exciting in the first place. The scenery made me want to explore Wonderland.
Another thing I didn't like was the over-the-top changes in the basic structure of the story of Alice in Wonderland. I think that the original story was interesting enough and, in my opinion, a lot of the ""depth"" he tried to bring into it ended up detracting instead. But I know most others disagree with me there.
That said I really loved the tea party scene. Even though it was a much darker take on the original, it filled me with nostalgia because the tea party has always, to me, been the creepiest and most unnerving part of the book and I think Tim Burton perfectly recreated the way I always sort of envisioned it as a child.
Depp, of course, saves this movie. While I don't like some aspects of his costume (make-up, etc.) his performance is the strongest of everyone. He really throws himself into every role he does and while I might not like every film he's in, no matter what role he's in he always manages to truly become that character. He always looks like he's genuinely having fun and The Mad Hatter is no different. It's nearly impossible to avoid getting sucked in by his enthusiasm for being the Mad Hatter and I enjoyed that quite a bit.
That said, I do find his accent(s) to be somewhat confusing. He seems to randomly slip in and out of a Scottish accent and I can't tell if that's purposeful for some reason or an accident. But that's a minor point.
Bottom line: Like much of Burton's recent work this movie is interesting to watch and it has a lot of imagination, but poorly executed CGI makes it feel cheap and shoddy. In some places I feel like he tried to be weird just because he is Tim Burton and he knows people expect it, so at times the movie felt forced and tired. Danny Elfman's soundtrack compliments the film and is beautiful, as always, but is also pretty typical of the work he usually does for Burton and in that respect can be a little stale at times.

He seems to be under the illusion that his imagination and inventiveness are equal to Carrolls. It ain't.

3639042,4,B001HN6940,"""Alice in Wonderland"" is the Tim Burton re-imagining of a classic children's book in true, weird, brilliant spectacle.

We meet up with Alice more than a decade after her first trip down the rabbit hole, where she must fight to try and make her life her own despite societal convention that forbids her to do so.

The plot of this particular script is probably more geared toward the young adults (specifically young women) in the audience - but anyone familiar with Tim Burton's movies would easily recognize it's not necessarily a kid's picture.

This probably earned it a PG rating (with help, no doubt, from the hookah smoking caterpillar.)

The weird world of Carroll's fantastical Wonderland seems tailor made for the equally strange sensibilities of Tim Burton, and indeed he toils this fertile ground with glee. The end result is both fantastic and freakish, leaving the movie goer feeling as though they literally did fall down a rabbit hole themselves.

Burton also makes the very shrewd decision to back away from the very obvious temptation to make Johnny Depp's Hatter the centerpiece of the story - instead he focuses the action (rightfully so) around Alice, played by Mia Wasikowska.

By doing this, he keeps us in the POV of the outsider to this strange and magical world.

In the theatrical release he also utilized the 3D effect less ostentatiously as one might imagine - and this added to the effect of bringing the audience into the action rather than just watching from the sidelines. Those expecting to jump out of their seat didn't. It's far more subtle than that, which is probably why ""Alice"" has been getting mixed reviews on the utilization of the medium.

When Alice is above ground, the scene is quite classic, with muted, pastel colors in regards to dress and to people. The only real splash of vibrant color we get is through the natural surroundings, which draws our attention (much like Alice's) away from the place she's supposed to be.

Once she's below ground, however, the colors are eye popping - but it's not quite beautiful. Wonderland is tainted by the Red Queen and it shows in the scary dark places that threaten to take over.

Nothing becomes truly beautiful (read: safe) until we finally see the White Queen's castle and its surroundings.

Some may find this less than lush portrayal a bit dark, especially for younger audience members.

While most people were looking forward to seeing what Depp did with Hatter, what we actually saw was a mix of many of his previous characters. He doesn't really bring anything new to the table. He had the eccentricity of Willy Wonka, the bravery of Captain Jack and the vulnerability of Edward Scissorhands.

That recall actually detracts away from his performance as Hatter, but - as stated earlier - the women of the tale effectively steal all scenes they share with him.

Mia as Alice is brave, stubborn, smart and strong. She utters, ""Lost my muchness, have I?"" and proceeds to prove that assessment wrong.

Helena Bonham Carter sinks her teeth into the nasty Red Queen, who demonstrates cruelty and fragility sometimes in the very same scene. Her polar opposite, the White Queen (as played by Ann Hathaway) is far more ethereal. Hathaway mixes humor and grace and makes her limited time on screen quite memorable.

Crispin Glover delivers a more duplicitous portrayal of Stayne - Knave of Hearts, an opportunist to the nth degree, but he too plays second fiddle to his female co-stars, which delivers more of a mixed review for the whole of the actors themselves.

That a female scribe penned this particular tale should surprise no one as it is the ultimate feminist tale.

There's familiarity for the original tale, but also the story is made current with the more mature dilemma Alice now faces with an unwanted proposal from a Lord everyone assumes she will want to marry.

These are the expectations of a young woman in her particular station, expectations Alice herself wants to reject.

In Wonderland, she faces the same conundrum - whether or not to do what is expected of her or blaze her own trail. The only problem is that blazing her own trail could in fact jeopardize all her new friends.

How screenwriter Linda Woolverton reconciles these two differing odds is inspiring.

The redemptive value of Alice in Wonderland is that it reaffirms that we can do the impossible if only we first believe that we can. This is the underlying theme that carries us from the very first scene all the way to the last. It is an excellent message for kids of all ages.",1301270400,,4553,4.81025641025641

3639045,4,B001HN6940,"Given his flair for the whimsical, the surrealistic, and the preposterous, Tim Burton would seem the ideal choice to direct a modern movie version of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."" And turns out he is. (Terry Gilliam and Guillermo del Toro, whose ""Pan's Labyrinth"" was already a variant of sorts on the story, are two others who might have done as well).

Lewis Carroll's darkly humorous Victorian Era classic chronicles the adventures of a spunky, imaginative young girl who tumbles down a rabbit hole into a fantastic world of talking animals, size-altering potions, and memorably eccentric characters, a land ruled over by the evil, bulbous-headed Red Queen, played with petulant haughtiness by Helena Bonham Carter.  The screenplay for the film - now called simply ""Alice in Wonderland"" - by Linda Woolverton draws from both ""Wonderland"" and its first sequel ""Through the Looking Glass"" (as most previous film versions have done), and captures both the darkness and the humor of the material.

All of Carroll's beloved creations are here, some played by actors in costumes and makeup, some generated entirely through CGI, and some - like The Red Queen - produced through a canny combination of the two.  There's the mad Mad Hatter (played by a typically loopy Johnny Depp), the growling Bandersnatch, the slyly smiling Cheshire Cat, the virtuous White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the roly-poly twins Tweedledee and Tweedledum, and the dragon-like Jabberwocky, which it has been prophesied Alice will slay, thereby liberating the people of the kingdom from their tyrannical queen.

Burton breathes new life into this oft-told and oft-filmed tale thanks to a team of visual and special effects wizards who come as close to capturing the world of Carroll's imagination as any group of filmmakers could ever be expected to, given the enormity of the challenge.

As the heroine who must learn to accept the impossible before she can know who she truly is, Mia Wasikowska manages to keep Alice life-sized and appealing even in the midst of all the larger-than-life pyrotechnics going on around her.

A masterpiece of art direction, costume design and special effects, this ""Alice in Wonderland"" is the next best thing to the books themselves.",1300924800,,2240,5.188365650969529
3639046,1,B001HN6940,"I curse the day I prayed for this to happen.  Seriously, if you read the review I wrote for Disney's animated version of `Alice in Wonderland' I said that Tim Burton needed to make this a live action film.  I was salivating over the idea.  When my dreams came true I was ecstatic.  I just knew that this film would be everything I hoped it would be and then, well, it wasn't.

It really, REALLY wasn't.

First off, everyone and their mother needs to be forewarned that this film is NOT a direct adaptation of the classic original we all know and love.  That isn't to say that this isn't pulled from Lewis Carroll's books, it is just that it doesn't follow the animated classic we all have grown up loving.  This film follows an older Alice who has just been proposed to by a nasty young man.  She flees the scene of the proposal and falls down the rabbit hole once again except she can't remember anything from before (although she does recall some lost memories she assumes are part of a recurring dream) and so she does a lot of repeat work (I assume in an effort to draw on the nostalgia of it all) before she uncovers the reality of why she is where she is.  She has to help overthrow the Red Queen by defeating some dragon creature so that the White Queen can take her rightful place on the throne.

Thank god for Helena Bonham-Carter.

Ok, so let's be honest here.  This film is a total mess.  The issue here is that Burton doesn't know how to edit himself.  He throws so much at you, assuming that more is more when in actuality, it's a freakish overkill.  `Alice in Wonderland' is a trashcan filled to the brim with a months worth of leftovers that spills out onto every frame.  From the overload of colorful set pieces that just overtakes every scene to the nightmarish performance by Johnny Depp, this film is garish to an extreme.  The plotting is underwhelming.  In reading Tim Burton's take on the film, he had mentioned being unmoved and emotionally disconnected to the actual flow of the books and the original films.  He said that he wanted to create a human element here, but he lost the whole point of the tale and instead shoved a generically clich&eacute;d `formula' at us and called it UNDERLAND.

I won't say that the visuals are bad because they are not.  In many instances they are slick and exciting, but there are just TOO MANY OF THEM.  This film is far too loud.  Sure, some may say that the point of this film is to be loud, and to an extent they are right, but this film doesn't carry the right visual feel.  This film feels forced and unfocused.  Far too much (FAR TOO MUCH) attention was given to creating dreamlike set pieces that cross the line of `tasteful' into `tacky', and far too little attention was given to fleshing out the childlike curiosity that embodied the original.

Burton didn't `get it' and so his take on the story doesn't `get it'.

The less said about Johnny Depp's embarrassing portrayal of The Mad Hatter the better.  Why won't he just go away?

In the end, there are two things worth mentioning here.  The score is on one hand rather loud and forbearing but it is also appropriately used and beautiful in its own right.  Also, Helena Bonham-Carter is BRILLIANT here.  I really think she needs to divorce (at least professionally) Tim Burton and solely work with other directors, but it is apparent that her talent was needed here since she livens her every scene and creates an unforgettable presence in The Red Queen.

She's magnificent.

From Alice's entrance to exit, Depp utters no more than 50-60 words -- the critical line has three -- but his stunning face reflects a lifetime, a history, a tour de force of emotions, volumes and volumes.

3639076,5,B001HN6940,"At 63, I can remember seeing the original Alice in Wonderland and really didn't like it.  It was a little too far out there for me. So, I was skeptical about the new version.  I first viewed it in regular BluRay and loved it.  Although I'm not a real big fan of Johnny Depp, I thought he did a marvelous job in this movie and I absolutely loved Helena Carter as the Red Queen.  I normally don't like the ""bad guy,"" but she was a very likeable villain.  In fact, I loved all the characters.  What a great movie.  I'm really surprised it only received a 6 out of 10 rating.  When compared to the original version, it should have received a solid 10.  Guess it's all a matter of personal preference.  Very few ""remakes"" are better than the original and I thought this movie hit the bullseye.  AND...the 3D version simply blows your socks off.  I've watched it several times and enjoy it even more each time.",1298505600,3,904,4.315476190476191
3639087,5,B001HN6940,"First, this is probably the best version of Alice ever filmed.  The story is told in a manner that makes the characters seem more ""real"".  The acting is great.

Now, let's get to the 3D.  With the exception of a few places in the opening sequences, before Alice goes down the rabbit hole, the 3D is great...almost equalling Avatar 3D.  When filmed against green screens and with a healthy dose of CGI, the realism of 3D is superb.  Why? because with those tools, depth of field can be controlled precisely.  There were scenes where I ducked when an object came my way. :-)  That brings me back to my reference to the early scenes which appeared a bit flat, in places.  This is primarily due to the limitations of optical lenses.  The wider the aperture, the more limited the depth of field...foreground and background cannot be kept in focus simultaneously.  When that happens, the 3D effect suffers.

So why did I rate this 5 stars?  Simple, because the part of the film that its primary focus, was done superbly and was visually stunning.  Use the Wizard of Oz as a comparison.  Before Dorothy left Kansas, it wasn't so spectacular, but once she arrived in Oz.....Wow!  Same thing here.

BTW, this was viewed on a Panasonic 54"" 3D plasma TV.

I should also point out that 8 days after I bought it, Amazon dropped the price $5.  That angers me.",1298160000,3,1345,4.552301255230126
3639088,4,B001HN6940,"Give Johnny Depp a chance to don fantastic make-up and costumes and pair him up with director Tim Burton, and you can expect something bizarre and creepy. ""Alice in Wonderland"" (2001 in 3D and IMAX) takes great liberties with Lewis Carroll's books, and drags them into the world of the surreal, the violent, and nuttsyland. There's a lot of claptrap and scary stuff in this one, and I think it will frighten some younger tykes. The bad Red Queen with a huge head literally and figuratively is played by Helena Bonham Carter. ""Off with their heads"" is her constant refrain.
 At the beginning of the movie when Alice is among ordinary people, she doesn't look well with those dark circles under her eyes, kind of a haunted look. Mia Wasikowska plays Alice. A young woman, she is at her engagement party, and she doesn't want to marry the foolish fop her mother is pushing on her. She wanders off and drops into the world she had been in as a child, Underland or Wonderland with its weird characters. Alice's father had told Alice all the best people are mad so she shouldn't worry about her fanciful imaginings.
 Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter, and he becomes a pivotal character. There's Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the fat roly-poly twins, the March Hare, the disappearing Chesire Cat, the hookah-smoking Blue Caterpillar (Abosolom), and the White Rabbit. At one point Depp recites part of Lewis Carroll's famous poem ""The Jabberwocky"" in which Carroll used some of his invented portmanteau words. The jabberwocky is a species of dragon that Alice has to slay on a Frabjous Day.
 If you are looking for a faithful rendition of Carroll's 1865 masterpiece, you best look elsewhere. This is kind of a mishmash with fantastic colors and special effects. Alice grows to giant size by drinking a potion and then shrinks to tiny size by eating cake. The Bandersnatch is a monster pursuing Alice, The aim is to depose the evil Red Queen and reinstate the good White Queen.
 On its own terms, disregarding fidelity to its source, this movie can be fun and also enlightening because of all the interesting vocabulary introduced. It's a deluscious treat. Carroll might turn over in his grave, but Disney would probably be pleased by the result though it's not as tame as his original stuff.",1297468800,,2280,4.793893129770993

3639092,4,B001HN6940,"When I first saw the 1951 animated version of  Disney's ""Alice in Wonderland"" I liked it immediately and it remained my favorite Disney animated feature ever since.  FIrst because of the funny and crazy design of the film and also because, as a radio listener,  I recognized most of the great voices used in the picture:  Ed Wynn, Jerry Colonna, Verna Felton, Sterling Holloway, et al.  When I heard that the Disney Co. had undertaken a remake of this story, I feared the worst: It would be modernized, it would lose  its charm and humor.  As is often the case, I was wrong:  The two versions are completely different in approach and both are most entertaining.

The new film is a masterpiece of production design and wonderful characterizations given by a fine British cast.  Even beyond this are the amazing visual effects that give the Blu-ray version a real advantage.  Nearly every scene involves complicated processing which is seamless and impossible to analyze on first viewing.  The additional features, which explain how some of this was accomplished, indicate what a grueling effort the making of this film must have been.

Mia Wasikowska is a lovely (older) Alice.  The Mad Hatter and the Red Queen are wonderfully played by Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter.  The voices used for various animated characters are superb choices:  Alan Rickman, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall, Barbara Windsor, Michael Gough.  One remembers Michael Gough as an important player in the Alec Guinness comedy, ""The Man in the White Suit,"" made by Ealing Studios sixty years ago and Mr. Gough is still working, bless him.

Not to be repetitive, this film is one of the great examples of the advantages of Blu-ray.  Having both versions to compare, I was very impressed by the additional detail brought forward by Blu-ray and how much can be missed watching the standard DVD.  For example, at the very beginning of the opening title, it's very easy to miss the clouds briefly forming a smiling face across the moon.

My only serious reservation with the new version is the annoying and inappropriate vocalizing  that is heard at the beginning of the closing credits completely dispelling the atmosphere left by Danny Elfman's superb score.",1296950400,2,2229,4.951482479784366

3639116,5,B001HN6940,"I had absolutely no idea Alice in Wonderland was so... dark, twisted, highly unusual and hypnotically colorful, haha.

You see I never actually watched the original animated version because I was under the impression this was a Disney film intended exclusively for *girls* so I completely avoided it for years.  A blonde-haired little girl stumbles across a bizarre fantasy land, makes friends with many of the people, and instantly changes into a much bigger giant girl simply by drinking or eating something magical?  Yeah... not exactly what I would have considered a *cool* movie.

Well, that all changed last night.  Hey, anything with Johnny Depp must be at least decent, right?  Well yeah... but it deserves a higher compliment than being tagged as simply ""decent"".  It's a really exciting adventure that's honestly a bit darker and more complex than I originally thought...

That is, assuming this movie is exactly how the animated version goes storyline-wise.  I have no idea how different it really is to that (or any other generally accepted *official* version).

The only thing I really know is that the animations and many unusual effects featured in this particular version of the popular childrens story are extremely psychadelically enchantingly... bizarre, haha.  No other possible way for me to describe its many vibrant layers of eye candy.

I know one thing for sure- most of the characters are downright uniquely strange or ugly.  Talking soldier frogs?  A cat with magical disappearing abilities?  A queen that's unbearably unattractive?  A beautiful exceptionally white angel creature?  Two chubby vulnerable twin boys?  An oranged-haired joker... whatever he is (Depp's character).  A bloodhound that talks?  Oh, and who can possibly forget the extremely awesome demonic creature that just appears out of nowhere and attacks the good people of the land?  That is one really dark moment of fairy tale storytelling, and I won't dare spoil his reason for existing or what happens.

Hmmm, now I really have to sit and wonder just what kind of person this film was intended for all along.  Children?  Well I suppose it would HAVE to be a childrens movie.  Whatever the case- the delicious smell of fabric softener coming through my living room vents from the dryer and washing machine in the basement below is making me feel really fruity and happy.  Maybe NOW is a good time to give Alice in Wonderland another shot and appreciate it in the way originally intended.  Here we go!",1295136000,3,2498,5.0588235294117645

This evening my 11-yr old daughter invited me to watch Burton's version of ""Alice in Wonderland"", so we sat down and watched it together.  I must admit that I went into the experience with low expectations, but was soon drawn into the story.  Without giving anything away, I saw parallels between the tradtional story and Burton's, even before Alice went down the rabbit hole to ""Underland.""  That made it fun.

It wasn't long before I saw that this version is a sequel to the original tale, and that was fun too.

The imagery was classic Tim Burton...the shapes of the trees, etc., just oozed Burton through and through, and, of course, everything was mostly dark and dreary...again, Burton-esque.

Burton's development of the story on screen was inventive and visionary, combining live action and aminated components to weave the tale.

So, in the end I was engaged and interested all the way through...surprising myself with that!

All in all I'd say that I liked it very much, though I wouldn't say that I loved it.  Even so, it's highly watchable, mainly for viewers over the age of 10 or so, but not for young children...at least that's where I'd pitch it.  There are a few somewhat gruesome scenes, but nothing I'd call gory.

My contribution relates to the Amazon.com exclusive Film Cell Photo Frame that is available for purchase with the ""Alice in Wonderland"" Blu-Ray.

In case this review appears on the standard blu-ray release, here is a link to the specific item I am discussing:

Film Cells are actual 35mm film frames that show an image from the movie.  For this display, the cells were hand-selected and mounted.  As seen in the photos, this display includes 3 individual film cells.  Each display will have unique cells, so you will own a one-of-a-kind item: no two pieces are the same.

Also included on the display are three photos from the film, as well as a title card.  The photos and the film cells are mounted on a black matte board and placed behind a sheet of glass for protection.  I own many film cell displays and this is one of the highest quality and most well designed pieces I have ever seen.

The display itself measures 8x10 inches, and framed it is 11x13 inches.  The frame is solid black, and comes ready to be mounted on the wall.  On the back of the display is a certificate of authenticity from Trend Setters, the manufacturer of the item.  Each display is numbered and the entire run is limited to 3500 pieces (get your hands on one while you can!).

The only downside here is that it will cost you considerably more to purchase this Amazon exclusive set than it would to just buy the Blu-Ray (approx. $70 more at the time of writing this review).

Maybe I expect too much but I wasn't very impressed with the 3d quality of this movie. 3d quality, in general, seems to vary quite a bit with content. I've played some 3d video games that cause you to jump because you feel like you're about to be hit with something (with no ghosting), and then this. It's my belief that since this movie wasn't created in native 3d(like Avatar), the 3d was an afterthought. Furthermore, there was signifigant ghosting at times and the 3d effect consistently broke down. To add to all of this, though I'm a Tim Burton fan (Sleepy Hollow, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure et cetera), the movie itself really has a ""been there, done that"" feel to it.",1292284800,10,825,4.434210526315789

3639249,5,B001HN6940,"A very creative (some may say bizarre) take on Alice's return to Wonderland.
Some may say bizarre.
But it beautifully ties up the story as the 19 year old Alice returns to Wonderland (Underland) to see some of her old friends and fulfill her destiny which is to end the reign of terror by the White Queen.
The young Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is an independent minded and head strong girl who suffers from a recurring night mare.
At a garden party she is expected to accept the proposal of marriage by the toffee nosed young Lord Ascott.
She excuses herself before following the white rabbit once again into a grotto (the same one she had entered 13 years before) and once again falls down the whole into wonderland.
There she stumbles across Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas), the Dormouse (Barbara Windsor), the March Hare (Paul Whitehouse) and the remarkably strange and wonderful Mad Hatter in a role that seems to be typecast for Johnny Depp.
She enters the court of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) who mistakes her entirely for someone else (who she refers to as Um), while all the time the Queen is after Alice.
but it is through battling wild creatures such as the Bandersnatch and dodging the forces of the evil Stayne, the Knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover)
Leading a rebellion against the tyrant Red Queen she flees with her friends, the Mad Hatter, the rabbit and various other characters from the original to the court of the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) where she is to fullfil her destiny as a dame in shining armour to battle the Jaberwocky
While there are scenes where you may wonder where the movie is going it all comes together beautifully.
Just the right dose of the bizarre and dark for the slightly philosophical yet entertaining adventure that the director was aiming for. Though this is not a children's movie and has some strange and potential frightening scenes and sequences.
Mia Wasikowska was beautiful, charming and strong as Alice, with the right qualities for what the 19 year old Alice was supposed to be

This Alice inspired movie was not quite what I expected (if I expected anything in particular at all), but it was a delightful surprise.  And I adore how empowering it truly IS for girls!  I still love all the princess-happily-after type stories, but they should not the only types of heroines we see or show children.  THIS Alice is such a conquering heroine, her world is so impossible while her emotions are exactly what one would expect.  If you want your little ones to ""believe in at least 6 impossible things before breakfast"" and slay dragons (I mean, Jaberwockies), make sure they see.  For that matter, make sure YOU see this.

3639273,5,B001HN6940,"In my opinion this version of Alice in Wonderland had even more ""muchness"" than Lewis Carroll's original works.  The cast is marvelous, especially Johnny Depp who was absolutely brilliant as the Hatter!

I've read both Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass.  I've seen other older adaptations of the books in movie form.  I've seen the original Disney animated version, which I never liked, even as a child.  Nothing comes close to Tim Burton's 'return to Wonderland'.  As far as the animals and sets go,
Computer Generated Images have ruined me for anything less.  Another A+ here, I loved, loved, loved the CG.

There are so many wonderful aspects to this film.  If I could give it 10 stars, I would.  Brilliantly done!  And if that wasn't enough, it contains no profanity!  Bravo!  I've added this to my list of all time favorite movies!",1288656000,,858,4.794520547945205
3639274,4,B001HN6940,"I like the fact this was a sequel and not a remake. I loved the animated Disney version as a kid, it was my absolute favorite! I was a little afraid of a dark, weird version of the story messing with my fond childhood memories. The cartoon version is a classic and Disney knew that classics should not be remade, even when it is their OWN classic! The new version is colorful with some dark undertones but it's a fun movie and it's kid friendly. It also is a totally different storyline from the original where we see a 19 year old grownup Alice who remembers little of the strange dream she had as a child.

I think the movie did a good job of being different and original as well as bringing back our favorite old characters only in a human form. I really liked Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter! The Red Queen was especially mean even more so than in the original and she was on the brink of being annoying. Anne Hathaway overacted a little bit in her role as the White Queen though usually she is great in fantasy-like roles like this. I think it was partially the White Queen's makeup too, I thought it was a little harsh. Otherwise the costumes were awesome...and at least the question is answered that many little girls asked when they saw the cartoon, ""How does Alice's clothing grow and shrink with her?"" LOL! Well, we see her go through several wardrobe changes throughout the movie so the new generation finally has an answer to this question!

Personally, I think Tim Burton could have added a little more color and fun. Wonderland (now Underland...what is up with the title?) should be a bright, colorful place. Tim also missed the mark a little bit in other areas too. The very nature of the ""Alice"" story had a paradoxical, crazy, dreamy kind of vibe. What we see is a gray, dark world that is in ruin because of the evil Red Queen. I would have LOVED to see the White Queen change it back to the colorful, happy place I remember in my childhood but that doesn't happen. It has a good ending that I don't want to spoil but it still left me wanting the crazy, fun and wacky Wonderland that we all are familiar with.

Then again, this is a Tim Burton movie so a lot of it was sort of what I expected. Personally, I think Tim has done ENOUGH with the 'dark' theme. His movies are starting to all look the same. I do appreciate the gift he has for thinking outside the box. Unfortunately though, I think he needs to look outside the box when it comes to his style! I would like to see him make something that is just as flashy and eye catching but that has a little bit lighter of a feel. His work is becoming predictable.

I think they should have chosen a different title for this movie like ""Return to Wonderland"" or something like that. It isn't the same story as the original and the name is a little misleading. It is rated PG and this seems appropriate. It IS definitely more of a kid's movie but it does have a lot of action and intense scary music that might be a little much for very small children. I did like this movie and I was entertained. It wasn't boring and would probably hold the attention of kids or adults who are into kid's movies. I would probably watch it again though I don't think I would pay to see it. Honestly, Disney's animated version was better and I would rate it five stars in a heartbeat! Tim Burton's version in my opinion is only worth 4 stars. It was a good movie but it wasn't a great one. It is MUCH better than Tim's terrible ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" remake but I still felt like something about this movie was missing...hence the reason my rating is missing a star!",1288656000,,3626,4.320117474302497

The film hinges itself upon the performances of Mia Wasikowska, Johnny Depp, Crispin Glover, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter. All turn in effective displays of their considerable talents, and are entertaining. There are a few flaws in this version, which I feel do detract from the movie as a whole. Lewis Carroll's world is not treated with respect in all ways; random concepts (such as Fustilug, Gribling, Keltikidik, Queast, Zounder, etc.) are introduced which have nothing to do with the original stories, and Depp's dance number at the end is a travesty. The CGI, while striking and beautiful, gets in the way of characterization sometimes (especially the poor Queen and Knave of Hearts effects, which are more distracting than engaging). The worst flaw is probably that the brilliant wit, humor and logical paradoxes of Carroll's masterpiece are almost entirely missing. This seems quite surprising, considering the material they had to work with. All in all, however, this film is a darkly radiant success. It's beautiful, enjoyable, intricate and eccentric ... everything you'd expect from this director. Enjoy it, and hope for a sequel that's even better!",1288483200,,1419,5.255506607929515

The strength of this film is in the area of its visuals, no effort is spared here, it is a lot of fun to watch. The story concept is one that has been beaten to a pulp. This is: start in the real world, go to fantasy world, end back in the real world. But, who cares, it can work here too.

This film continues where the original book ended off. Alice is now grown up. At first she has difficulty in coming to terms with her return to Wonderland. But as time goes along she comes to terms with her destiny. There is a lot of action and quirky aspects that has become the hallmark of the director, Mr. Tim Burton.",1286323200,,928,4.17877094972067
3639323,1,B001HN6940,"This movie was a huge disappointment, and I have to agree with many criticisms raised by other people who gave it one star. Now, I have no quarrels with film directors who want to modify their literary source to fit the demands of the cinematographic media and make the best use of the media. I think it's the only way to create a strong original movie as opposed to a series of video illustrations to the book. However, I have a problem with the fact that the movie has none of the originality, depth, absurdity and paradoxical nature of the books. Instead, it has a pre-digested Hollywood formula complete with a happy ending, a standard set of visual and verbal cliches and is flat and predictable at every step. Anyone could have written the screenplay after watching 3-4 Disney movies and substituting the characters for those from the ""Alice"" books. The visuals appears to be borrowed from a bunch of Disney's haunted house movies and sometimes - from ""The Lord of The Rings"" but without the breathtaking originality and the panoramic scale of the latter. The music is even worse and seems to be coming from the same third-rate ghost movies. I have heard that the last song is good, but cannot comment on it; I could not believe my luck when the movie has ended and turned it off as soon as the titles began.

Against this pathetic backdrop, some things in the movie that could have been otherwise disturbing (such as a mockery of physical deformities in people) did not really matter. This movie is not going to have any kind of lasting impact on minds and souls.",1286150400,20,1570,4.607142857142857

The Disney honchos said,
""Alice"" is a property
To raise up from the dead.
Tim Burton can revive it
Through his visionary head.

The forces all were marshaled.
A screenplay was commissioned
From Woolverton, who'd proved her worth.
She had the Disney frisson;
With Belle and Simba in her past,
Now Alice was her mission.

A two hundred million budget
For every C.G.I. step.
Led by Burton's whimsical genius,
At FX he is adept.
And for a box office guarantee...
A Mad Hatter they call Depp.

A blonde young lass in the title role,
An unknown known as Mia.
Surround her with a cast of greats
And the folks will come to see her.
But it's really Depp that draws the crowds
From Spain to South Korea.

To play the part of the mean Red Queen
The director cast his wife.
Though they never really married,
Together they've built a life.
With her outsized head and bitchy flair
Helena's mouth cuts like a knife.

In London town they slaved away
With mo-cap, opticals and green screen
From Dodgson's book, Burton made
A world that's never been seen.
The problem is his story's like
An undernourished cuisine.

For, truth to tell, I have to say
And say it without malice,
I didn't give a fig about
The plight of brave, dear Alice.
Even fighting off the Jabberwock
Outside the Red Queen's palace.

But who am I, a lowly scribe
To argue with the millions
Who shelled out dollars, euros, yen
To gross over a billion?
And don't forget, the poor real,
The currency Brazilian.

Did they all love this ""Alice"" film,
Or was it the one they had to go see?
Paying out the extra bucks
For lame post-production 3D.
But in Hollywood, a hit's a hit
With sequels guaranteed.

With shortened window, it now arrives
On DVD and Blu-ray,
Where it looks and sounds just wonderful
On my big screen, but I must say
I really felt most unengaged
Despite the hi-tech display.

So, if you long for Burton, Depp
And worlds that are fantastic
My words may seem like curdled milk,
My attitude sarcastic.
But this ""Alice"" iteration makes me
Unenthusiastic.",1285372800,5,2052,4.536585365853658

Because it's colorful and flashy, however, it's still going to attract all the kids and their parents, but any thinking, discriminating individual will see right through the charade. Boy has Timothy Burton fallen far from his own tree. If only he had picked up this project right after making Edward Scissor Hands, we would be talking about a masterpiece of a movie; instead we get an uninspired, white bread excuse from him when we all know that whole wheat is better. This book was written for Tim Burton, and somehow he managed to screw it up royally.

This is a newly created SEQUEL. where Alice has grown up and finds out that she misheard all of these years ago, and it's actually ""Underland."" Okay fine, that makes for somewhere to go with a story. But had they named this ""Alice In Underland"" it would be clear that this is not the original, classic story that kids should be familiar with. This is a movie that can accompany that movie/book as a supplemental piece of entertainment. But no, for some reason, Hollywood decided it would sell more tickets, and Blu-Rays, and DVDs if they misled everyone with the title ""Alice In Wonderland."" It is deceptive and unethical. Just as naming a movie about Kung Fu ""The Karate Kid."" To purchase or support this movie in anyway is to encourage this sort of behavior. So I highly recommend letting this one go by. You're not missing much, you and your kids won't be any worse for it.

I've always loved the animated Alice and it's my favorite of all the Disney classics which is why I'm so disappointed with this version. It's not that the storywriters took liberties to make a mostly original story based on the original Alice, that's fine. It's that the end result is confusing and just plain boring.

The movie actually starts off fine seeing Alice from our normal world to Wonderland, but it gets bad from there and I found myself scratching my head so much, you'd have thought I had a dandruff problem or something. We're kind of rudely reminded that this is not a retelling of the original Alice but a pseudo sequel. Alice has appararently returned to Wonderland but then nobody's really sure if she was originally there, even her. The plot is slowly explained over the course of the film but it feels choppy and it never really gets going. I was always in anticipation of meeting all the classic characters and for the fun to begin but it never did. This is a very confusing film because I don't know how to identify it. It's not fun, funny, scary, sad, action packed or intense. It just is. I found myself bored and tired about halfway through. The bleak new Wonderland didn't help as many parts were dark, drab and old characters were all more like older, more serious versions of themselves. I know it's supposed to fit with the new war torn, oppressed Wonderland but what fun is that anyway? It also didn't help that Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter mumbled half his lines throughout the movie and I had no idea what he was talking about. The absolute end for me was the thrown together battle scene and a prophecy fulfillment of Alice to fight a dragon. Uh, what?

The audio/video are both excellent, near the best available even, but for me, it seemed as whole movie's selling point. They may have just as well advertised it as, ""3D everybody, Alice in Wonderland in 3D. Come see our great computer graphics in 3D!"" I don't really see anything else this movie has to offer other than you can use it to show off your hi def t.v.

I'm confident in saying, I'll never watch THIS Alice in Wonderland again as there's really no reason. While it might have had Alice, the only Wonder was as to why the people who made this movie thought that this was a good story. I would've rather they took the easy way out and just do a remake.

Johnny Depp does his usual remarkable job of being strange; his versatility continues to amaze me as he shifts roles and appearances like a real pro from film to film. The sound and video quality on the Blu-ray version left nothing to be desired.

As one reviewer pointed out this is Alice's second trip to Wonderland; the first one was initially forgotten by Alice but comes back to her toward the end of the movie where she begins to remember bits and pieces of her first trip.

I watched this movie as a rental and I'm glad I did; I will probably never seek it out to watch it again. Although it's rated PG I would caution parents of small children about the threatening and rather dark ambience of the film.

I only found 2 interesting things regarding your latest romp through another crazy place (i.e. Willy Wonka's Factory) First off where the visuals. Amazing scenes filled the screen with true to life representations of Lewis Carrolls' literary classic. You felt as if you where actually in Wonderland for seconds. (But only for seconds.) Secondly was Johnny Depps' portrayal of the great mad hatter. He did hit the nail on the (crazy) head. Nothing did delight me more to see him let loose again as an actor. And I appreciated the attempt at bringing in some one a little new to the filming process, but honestly you could of used a much better Alice, in fact, Anne Hataway would of faired MUCH better as Alice than the White Queen...role reversals...I do wish I would of gotten to see this flop on the 3D screens, but unfortunately thats what you have to deal with when living in a small town in Oregon.

3639376,3,B001HN6940,"Most of the many attempts at filming Alice In Wonderland haven't been particularly successful, for two reasons. First, directors seem to feel that the movie must have a strong male character. Lewis Carroll didn't give them one (all the male characters in the books are rather spineless and feeble) so they invent their own, usually, for some reason, the Mad Hatter. Second, they misread the character of Alice. In the book she is headstrong, inquisitive and feisty; she dominates the other characters even as she takes part in their fantastic world. She is not a spectator, watching what they do, but a full participant, accepting. or more often rejecting, their view of life. She's not, nor is she meant to be, a nice girl meekly accepting what befalls her.

Unfortunately, Tim Burton's 'Alice' falls into both these traps. Instead of being a passing character Alice meets along the way, the Mad Hatter becomes central to the film and in doing so destroys much of the point of the tale. Alice herself, though she has her moments of rebellion, is played far too passively; she's more often merely watching what goes on in  Wonderland. In making her character too detached, Burton loses the involvement that the audience should feel and which has made the books so successful for so long.

On the plus side, Wonderland itself is marvelously realized. I love the bright colors, the ever-more-convincing computer graphics and the strange flora and fauna which inhabit this suitably dream-like place. Everything looks as it's supposed to- distorted versions of reality, only possible in the imagination. The story meanders far from the original tales, but I have no problem with that, as long as it holds together. Tim Burton is the master at making a fantasy world come to life.

It's a fun movie to watch. It just doesn't make the audience feel involved.",1283644800,118,1852,4.926282051282051
3639377,2,B001HN6940,"Finally! The long awaited Alice in Wonderland  has screened in thousands of theaters across the country. Now... how was it?! Ok, I've done this a few times before and it seems to get the best response. I'll go through what I liked and didn't like about the movie.

What I liked:

'Underland':
What did you expect from Tim Burton? Seriously, was there a doubt that this man was going to make 'Underland' anything less than magnificent? The world looks and feels familiar, yet so very different. It has a very eerie, Gothic feel, that makes you just a little bit uneasy... which I'm sure Alice must feel as she enters this strange world. The colors, the animals, creatures, all amazing. I don't want to focus too much on this point... but watch the film in 2D. My wife and I watched in 3D and to be completely honest, it took away from the movie for me. So many details are blurry (a big negative to 3D), that I would rather enjoy them in 2D.

The cast/characters:
Again, what did you expect? So much talent, so many unbelievable characters it's ridiculous. Let me start with Johnny Depp, he does an amazing job as the lovable, yet crazy Mad Hatter. He has to be charming enough for you to care, and goofy enough to make you think he's nuts... without being annoying. Great work.

Helen Bonham Carter STEALS THE SHOW! She's sooo good, she's so talented, so funny I couldn't wait for her to reappear onscreen. Pay close attention to the amazing acting she does with her face alone, because her body is slightly twisted for the movie. Mia Wasikowska does great as a curious, scared, confident Alice.

The characters were mostly CGI all of which are stunning. Great to look at, great voice acting and just overall a orgasm for the eyes. Anne Hathaway... I still think you're the most overrated actress in Hollywood, 'nuff said.

What I didn't like:

The story:
This is perhaps the deal breaker for me as far as giving this movie a thumbs up approval. The story is simple, and I understand that's good for families going to see the film, but come ooooon! I don't want to spoil anything, but I promise you this... you will leave asking yourself ""who cares?"" Seriously, why even make the movie with such a weak story? As I was watching the film, I thought to myself, ""oh, this happened in the 1951 Disney cartoon. Oh those characters are in the cartoon. Oh that is a cool CGI version of the cartoon."" There wasn't enough of a difference from the cartoon classic to consider this a true sequel, as much as a reboot with CGI. So disappointing there wasn't more meat to the story... SO DISAPPOINTING!

My own expectation:
Look, this is an interpersonal issue, and I understand that. But you're on our blog, so I'm assuming you care what we feel. I felt like I was so let down. I feel like it was such a lost opportunity to make something so special. The talent was there, the characters were there, the technology was there, but.... flat. So flat. A year now of solid anticipation and I walked out so let down.

Maybe I'm being harsh, maybe I ""missed the point"", but I really did feel let down. It's ok, Burton and company are going to be fine, because the movie is going to do well, VERY WELL. It was sold out 1:40 PM showing on Friday afternoon, a school day. So look for big numbers, check out the movie and lets compare scoring points.

3639379,4,B001HN6940,"Everyone's entitled to their opinion, of course. But it seems to me that too few people are able to really sit down and let themselves go and be taken along for the ride in a movie these days, while too many prefer to watch a movie with a cynical eye, actively looking for things to criticize (perhaps in seeking to write a ""witty"" review later on).  If you're going to watch a movie based on a child's tale, watch it from your inner child's viewpoint, OK?

After recently seeing Alice in Wonderland, and then searching online for reviews afterward, I was very baffled by some of the venom I saw directed at this movie.  Maybe it's just an aversion to the story of Alice in Wonderland itself, more than anything.  I admit that, growing up, I never much liked this story.  However, seeing the genius with which it was brought to the screen (and DVD), I simply can't take seriously any of the bashing.  This was beautifully, masterfully, and bizarrely-done (and bizarre is definitely appropriate for this).  Perhaps there was too much CGI, as some have pointed out.  I'm not a fan of overdoing CGI.  (As much as I love most of Cameron's work, Avatar left me somewhat cold, as CGI just has an empty and soulless feeling to it that we sense, no matter how real it appears to our eyes).  For Alice in Wonderland, I suppose the amount of graphics tinkering was necessary, though, because the story itself, as well as the characters, were deeply distorted in all imaginable ways.  It managed to avoid having too much of that empty CGI feeling, though, since they combined the effects largely with the actual actors.

This movie made me feel like a little kid, as I watched it wide-eyed and oo-ed at the Cheshire Cat, and ah-ed at the settings, and giggled at the doormouse.  It challenged my poor brain with its shape and relative-size distortions, physics-defying moments, and general madness.

And on the subject of madness, ah, Johnny Depp as the Hatter.  Nuts for sure, but with silliness and an unexpected vulnerability brought to the part which really caught me off-guard, and which made him so endearing.  All the casting was perfectly done, in fact.  But I'm mad about the Hatter.  :)

I take away 1 star for several moments in the movie where some lines were delivered too muttered, too quietly, and were unintelligible.  Maybe it's not the actors, but the audio mixing, and I notice this more and more with movies lately.  (And yes my hearing is very good.)  Dialogue too quiet, loud parts too loud - dynamics issues.  I read a lot of reviews where people mention this about a great number of movies, and they having to turn subtitles on to catch the quiet dialogue.  ""Alice"" suffers just a little bit from this problem.

Other than that....

It's sad because if you pay attention there is a good message and character development that is lacking in many movies these days, so I implore anyone who hasn't watched this yet to do so without judgement or preconceptions until completely viewing it.

3639426,2,B001HN6940,"Lewis Carrol's original ""Alice in Wonderland"", despite being more on the bizarre side and not having a real plot, was an entertaining and charming book, as I remember it from high school. When I heard Tim Burton was adapting it, I thought it was perfect for him, given his love of doing bizarre movies like ""Big Fish"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", and ""Beetlejuice"". However, this movie failed my expectations.

Burton takes a classic tale and gives it a modern storyline and mixes it up with other of Lewis' works (such as the White Queen and the Jabberwocky). Basically, Alice has grown up and is reluctant to marry the man people want her to. While she wanders off to think, she falls down a rabbit hole and makes her way into ""Underland"", where she visited years before when she was a child. Then, like your typical, predictable story, Alice discovers she is the prophesied one who will kill the Jabberwocky and restore the White Queen to the throne of Underland. Besides an unoriginal plot, the movie failed in other ways. The characters were bizarre and nothing truly memorable, and most of the ones from the original story had very little screen time and little part to play in the story. In short, it came across as a poorly done film.",1280620800,2,1251,4.6863636363636365

  about the movie, in the movie house it was abit disappointing only because i wear glasses and it really interfered with the 3d experience. i watched it at home with my system and no 3d and i really had to reconsider my rating for it. i picked up alot of the audio,especially the dialog between the mad hatter and alice, i really believe that by not focusing so much on the 3d experience, it allowed me to really get more into the story and explained alot more to me.

Tim Burton is most courageous as a film visionary - his films break new attitudes and visual ground. Storytelling-wise, however, his films have memorable scenes chained together with a dental-floss-storyline and medium-to-slow pacing - but more power to him; he's doing what he loves in a market very closed to originality. Burton refreshingly breaks his storytelling pattern for 'Alice' with slightly quicker pacing, and still offers the ground-breaking visuals you ache for. The mixture of virtual and real - sometimes within the same character - is nearly seamless. Alice is played with a quiet sensitivity by Wasikowska, and it's through your strong sympathy with her character that you come to experience and love the characters and of 'Underland'.

We are privileged to see the talent of Burton unfold as mainstream genius.",1280188800,,974,5.158227848101266

3639446,2,B001HN6940,"When I heard that Johnny Depp was going to play the Mad Hatter in Tim Burton's rendition of Alice in Wonderland, I was really excited and couldn't wait.  After seeing the movie, I feel like it was a waste of time that no amount of cool computer effects could rectify.

Yes, the movie has good effects but that's about all it has going for it.  Even Johnny Depp disappoints.  His character is too tame (despite the ridiculous make-up), too bland, and frankly, a major let-down.  My biggest problems with the movie were:

1. Completely predictable plot.  I mean, come on.  They told us what was going to happen from the beginning.  Is that any way to make for an interesting story?  There was no point in watching because you already knew what was going to happen.  And the whole, grown-up Alice coming back to wonderland was stupid because we're supposed to believe that she somehow forgot about it or something.  Really?  Just stupid.

2. First-class actors really fudging their parts.  First there is the Johnny Depp thing.  As if that wasn't bad enough, Ann Hathaway, who is normally a classy actress, plays possibly the most annoying characters ever - the White Queen.  She prances around holding her hands in that stupid princess way and talks in a voice so annoying you really wish someone would just shut her up already.  Helena Boham Carter is the one exception to the poor acting and comes through wonderfully as the Red Queen in typical Helena Boham Carter fashion.  But I'm not sure what the point was of half-animating her.  The girl who plays Alice is bland and unmemorable.

3. The only spontenaity or uniqueness in the film is the special effects (which are well-done).  It feels like Tim Burton put no effect into this movie at all.  You're used to his films being wacky, crazy, and incredibly messed up.  Then, given an already wacky story, for some reason, he decides to make is more tame.  Yes, I realize Alice in Wonderland is sort of a kid's story.  But at the same time, it's an intense, crazy, twisted kid's story.  This version seems to lose the whimsical nature of the story.",1279929600,5,2099,4.64850136239782

For example I basically watched the movie for Johny Depp being in it. Otherwise I would never have bother to watch it since it's not quite my type of genre. Actually it was my daughter who picked this DVD up, and I sneeked to watch, just curious on Depp's acting in this movie. Dan mentions Harry Potter and Narnia in his review. And I disagree there a little bit. I don't think Alice in Wonderland can be comapred to either Harry Potter. I watched the 1st Harry Potter and liked it, after that it almost became a serie, and I haven't watched the sequels. To me it just became ""too many of the same"". Never watched Narnia, but here also I felt, it's like so many others movie in the same genre. So I never bother to watch Narnia. But other then that, I totaly agree with Dan's review on Alice in Wonderland.

I realy did not expect to like this movie, as I said I was just curious for Depp's acting, but I did enjoy it. Not only for Depp's acting, but for the movie on it's own. Once I started watching I could not stop. Great movie, great acting, great set, great costumes, great story, great lines. Very entertaining.",1279238400,,1293,4.320987654320987
3639473,3,B001HN6940,"""Alice in Wonderland"" is Tim Burton-lite but that will appeal to the young and old, without becoming overly dark or twisted.

The 2010 film directed by Tim Burton (""Corpse Bride"", ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Beetlejuice"") and a screenplay by Linda Woolverton (""The Lion Queen"", ""Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey"", ""Beauty & the Beast"") is loosely based on the Lewis Carrol 1903 classic ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"".

Featuring a production by Team Todd (The Austin Powers films, ""Memento"", ""Across the Universe""), the 2010 Disney incarnation received a lot of buzz when the announcement was made that the film would feature a reunion of both director Tim Burton and actor Johnny Depp but the that the film would feature a cast tat would include Mia Wasikowska, Helena Bonham Carter, Anne Hathaway, Crispin Glover, Alan Rickman and many more.  The film would also receive buzz about the creation of the world of Wonderland and the extensive use of CG, especially with its steep production budgeted at around $200 million.

Despite receiving reviews that were 50/50 from film critics, there is no denying that a Tim Burton film would bring people to the theaters and in this case, the Burton and Depp mystique would help bring in over $996 million dollars in the box office.  The film would achieve the sixth highest grossing opening weekend of all time and the highest opening weekend for a non-sequel and also surpassing ""Avatar"" in the IMAX and is currently the highest grossing film of 2010.

VIDEO:

""Alice in Wonderland"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1) and for the most part, ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a film that showcases a great amount of detail on Blu-ray but in terms of colors, for example, Alice going with her mother for a party, the color seem quite muted (like it's overcast) and I looked at it as a way for the film to show the viewer how Alice was a bit disenchanted with her life.  When she falls into the hole, we notice a different, surreal landscape that was created digitally.

In fact, you will see in the special features that a large part of the film was created alongside a green screen, so for the most part, the film is CG-heavy and one can expect gorgeous CG graphics for Wonderland.  Blacks are nice and deep and scenes such as the Red Queen's lair and the use of reds are quite vibrant.  And as mentioned, there is a good amount of detail.  From Mad Hatter's hat to the tea party and more.

As for the DVD version that is included with the three-disc Blu-ray release, the DVD is presented in Widescreen 1:78:1 (enhanced for 169 televisions).

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Alice in Wonderland"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (48 kHz/24-bit), English 2.0 DVS,  Spanish and French Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  The lossless audio was very well done as the film is quite immersive.  From crowd ambiance, to the smallest noises created by the Red Queen's servants to the thunder clouds approaching nearby, to the galloping horses, the march of the soldiers and more.  Dialogue is crystal clear through the front channels as Danny Elfman's music utilizes the front channels while the surrounds utilize the special effects.  From Alice falling through the hole and hitting various objects to the various characters running from the Red Queen's soldiers and more.

""Alice in Wonderland"" may not be action-heavy but the 5.1 DTS-HD MA is no slouch either.  Audio is well done for this film and overall, a satisfying, immersive lossless soundtrack.

As for the DVD version that is included with the three-disc Blu-ray release, the DVD is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and English 2.0 DVS French and Spanish.

As for subtitles, the film is presented in English SDH, French and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Tim Burton was able to create a magical world of Wonderland with its characters with the heavy use of CG.  The film was literally filmed with a big green screen all around and people having to wear it while most of the work was then added via post-production in making sure the characters, the scenery and of courts the animals and inhabitants of this world are captured quite well in the film.  So, I had no doubt that the Blu-ray release would look good because mostly everything is CG-driven.

""Alice in Wonderland"" is a film that was received 50/50 and for the majority of the critics who are familiar with the Lewis Carrol novel, the film was a major deviation from the actual story.  Whereas the novel was about a young Alice who ends up in Wonderland and interacts with the inhabitants of the land including the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, the King and Queen and Duchess and literally an adventurous experience of a girl in a new land.

As for the Linda Woolverton screenplay, the film is about a young adult Alice who faces adulthood.  Not knowing how to explain her emotions and being asked to take part in a marriage (in which she doesn't love the man), she just wants to escape.  In Wonderland, this escape from reality is where Alice gets to know her true self and learn how to stand up for herself without anyone calling the shots in her life.  Call it a coming-of-age film, ""Alice in Wonderland"" deals with a young woman not knowing her true strength but when her life and her new friends lives are in danger, she is the only one that can defeat the Red Queen's biggest weapon.  She may not think that it is possible but her brief stay in Wonderland will eventually be an incredible test.

Typically, I am a reviewer who tends to find CG-driven films to be quite banal of late.  Granted, ""Avatar"" was a film that was extremely well-crafted and as for ""Alice in Wonderland"", I actually enjoyed the world that Tim Burton and staff was able to create. Wonderland may be lush but a CG film can only go so far.  It depends on the characters and its storyline.  And reading a number of reviews, the film was split 50/50 for critics who enjoyed it or those who felt the film was to astray when compared to the original novel or just more eye candy and an unappealing film.

Sean P. Menas, film critic for The Salt Lake Tribune wrote, ""Burton's overamped, visually frenetic and chaotically action-heavy adaptation of ""Alice in Wonderland"" manages to be both too much and not enough of what a retelling of Alice should be.""

I have to agree with Sean P. Menas and that ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a film that could have been an amazing trilogy if given the chance.  As I pondered about the film, sure, images of ""Lord of the Rings"" came to mind but it would have been great if there was more to the story of ""Alice in Wonderland"" because 109 minutes did not seem enough.  And I felt that Tim Burton's storyline was diluted by its pacing of trying to get from point A to point B so quickly that I found myself more in-tuned with Alice's character and Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter was just a creepy character that needed more time.  Even the Cheshire Cat which was so instrumental in the novel was left with very little in the film.

Michael Smith of the Tulsa World writes, ""A disappointment on a massive scale canvas, Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a beautiful, giant bore that's almost comedy-free. It may be of some interest to adults, but kids will be bored to tears, unless they don't listen to the leaden dialogue and imagine they are watching a new video game.""

Although, I didn't find ""Alice in Wonderland"" as a giant bore, I found it to be entertaining and felt it was a film that had potential but in the end, making you feel it was OK or good but not fantastic.  I can't call the film a disappointment on a massive scale, especially as it is one of the highest grossing films of all time.  I also feel that with the pairing of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, the films success was facile and if anything, their pairing would lead to financial box office success but I may not be an erudite when it comes to the original novel's storyline but I do feel for the film, the story of ""Alice in Wonderland"" could have led to more sequels and stretch out the story to make us care for the characters and even Wonderland itself.

We are told that Alice has been to the Wonderland many times before, even painting roses for the Red Queen and this is where I find the biggest fault of the film.  The original novel would have served a better first film for ""Alice in Wonderland"", taking her to adulthood and bringing her back as featured in this film as a sequel.  This would have made sense and a much more engaging film.

I did enjoy Mia Wasikowska as Alice.  She fit the part of a young woman trying to find herself and both Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway did a wonderful job playing the queens.  And Johnny Depp, he was wonderful as the Mad Hatter but for each of these three characters, once again, I just felt there was more storyline for these characters that could have been developed.  I felt there was too much emphasis on the glitz and the look of the world while watching a girl who was trying to find her inner strength.  Granted, that was the writer's intention but for all these characters introduced, including the CG animated animals who play a major part in the film, it would have been great to see these characters explored a bit more.  If anything, making the viewer care enough to see them rescued or have created some emotional connect to them.  I just felt the pacing of the film was a bit rushed.

As for the Blu-ray release, there is no doubt that ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a beautiful film with tremendous detail.  The lossless soundtrack is very good.  A good amount of special features and you do get a DVD and digital copy for the 3-disc release.  So, as a total package, its a pretty solid Blu-ray release from Disney.  If you enjoyed the film, you will most definitely enjoy the Blu-ray release.

Overall, I was content with ""Alice in Wonderland"" and I'm sure that both parents and children may find the film entertaining.  Those who are familiar with the original story may feel the storyline's deviance from Lewis Carroll's work to be too much of a difference and for children, for the most part, this is a safe film with not much violent content until the latter end of the film in which Alice goes against the Jabberwocky.  Some parents might find the scene a bit too much for younger children and in that case, parental guidance is suggested.

But for me, I felt the film had tremendous potential but missed its target.  Sure, it was a box office success but as  I watched the film alongside with my seven-year-old son, after the film was done, the words that came out of his mouth was  ""is that it?""  And like my son, I felt the same way about ""Alice in Wonderland""... ""is that it?"".",1279238400,,12782,4.6541889483065955

It's a wild adventure, far wilder than the cartoon and it's far more than just a re-telling.  It ties together the land of fantasy and real life and wraps it up with a powerful, positive, uplifting message.  One of my favorite lines in this film is ""You look like Alice, but you've lost your much-ness.""  That is a profound thought!  How many of us have grown older and lost our ""much-ness"".  I've watched this several times now and my view has stayed the same.  I totally love this film.  It is totally Tim Burton, but it is also totally Lewis Carol.

It sounds more like Narnia than Wonderland to me--just with a Blue Caterpillar instead of Aslan the Lion.  Still, I enjoyed the movie.  Johnny Depp was diverting as the Mad Hatter, and Mia Warsikowska was delightful as Alice.  I also found it amusing that Alice kept having to find new clothes because the clothes she was wearing didn't grow or shrink with her!  It was nice to see Crispin Glover again.  He did a wonderful job as Stayne, the Knave of Hearts.  So even though it wasn't classic Wonderland, I do recommend this movie.",1278806400,2,773,4.432624113475177
3639489,4,B001HN6940,"""Alice"" has a bit of a slow start, and to any viewer not familiar with the story, it can be confusing for awhile. Yet it wins a person over, voice by voice, visual by visual, and step-by-Depp. Johnny continues to amaze me with his versatility as an actor. He has become one of those guys who makes anything he is in better, even if he can't save them all (like Michael Caine in that respect.) Director Burton has filled the cast with great British character actor vocalizations, and the screen with oddball colors and drawings that amuse, frighten or delight. I think the best way to enjoy his version of ""Alice"" is to see the Disney animated 1950's effort first, which is great, and then the new twist on the story. If a mom or dad could read the poem ""Jabberwocky"" to the kids and explain a bit about Lewis Carroll, the author, first, so much the better. Burton does assume a certain literacy and familiarity with the tale and the poem that may give contemporary kids too much credit, but he has done a good job overall. If watching this version of ""Alice"" leads some young folk to read the original prose, hurrah!",1278806400,,1116,4.4754901960784315

newer twist, it still is Wonderland. Darker, maybe, but that is how Carroll's books were too.

This was not too harsh for our daughter, who was entranced with it until the Hatter did a dance on ""frabjous day,"" with a bit of rock in the background. The Tweedles were actually quite right. The Hatter is supposed to be mad, and did a good job of it. No other Alice in Wonderland will give you the Jaberwocky as this rendition does. None will give you the Jubjub bird or the frumious Bandersnatch as this one does. The Dodo bird, and others. What else do we say then?

We enjoyed it, even though there were many negative things written about it. Even though we were dubious about it prior to
viewing. We were in for a shocking treat, captivated by it through and through. May or may not be suitable for
everyone, due to some fearful Jaberwocky and other very dark scenes. Then again, your child may like it, as did our nine

The story needed some adjustment due to the age factor of the victim. So this is why we get a more of a return the Underland in place of the original Wonderland. The wit is replaces with action, the cunning with swordplay and so forth.

I do not want to give away any surprises but this presentation is a unique made for the actors and to be politically correct for this day and age.

3639511,5,B001HN6940,"ALICE IN WONDERLAND

I have to say that I am indeed a fan of Lewis Carroll the person who wrote the stories on which this film was based [yes I said stories as in multiple, it's true look it up], and am a huge fan of the animated film that we all know and love, CLASSIC. Add in that I am a Tim Burton fan, a Johnny Depp fan [my girl loves him], and a huge Helena Bonham Carter fan [I love her]. So naturally we all got together to see this film opening night and had a great time. Also naturally when released on this three disc combo pack I had to have it, the day and minute it was released it was mine. Did I love the film that much, is it a classic, is it five stars, are all questions I am sure you want to ask me after reading that. Well before any are answered here in the review let me say this, I believe in supporting people you claim to be a fan of. So regardless I would have bought this any way luckily I liked this film so it was all good.

This is not the classic animated version you all remember from back in the day, no, this is Tim Burton's take on this. In this version of the film Alice is older and on the verge of getting married, or so her hopeful husband to be thinks. Of course she is not in love and doesn't want to do it plus she thinks she is seeing a rabbit every where she goes. It is at a party in which the future husband [he hopes, or is it expects] will be asking for her hand that she follows the rabbit. Of course you all know she falls into the hole at the bottom of the tree only to end up in Underworld, oops I mean Wonderland [which is it, I guess you will have to watch]. Now that we are here there are a few familiar faces, or maybe not so much if you are Alice. It turns out she doesn't remember any of them or she may not be the real Alice at all.

All of your favorites are here of course from Tweedledee and Tweedledum, White Rabbit, Blue Caterpillar, and of course the Cheshire Cat along with so much more. But yes as I am sure you all know the Mad Hatter is here and plays a big role in the film. You see the Red Queen and her huge head are planning on killing Alice so she can't kill the Jabberwocky. But if she isn't Alice how can she defeat this monster and why should she even try, this is not her battle after all. So off we go on a crazy adventure that I can honestly say I enjoyed as did my little cuz, she loved it.

This is with out a doubt a Tim Burton film as it has his style all over it but I wonder what type of film this would have been if it would not have been geared towards kids. Still I found it to be a very entertaining film that was just straight fun. If I would have went in expecting more I may have been disappointed but if little 5 year old cuz and my girl enjoyed it then so would I, and I did. It must have been kinda hard for writer Linda Woolverton to not only write this but write a visual film for 3-D. the visuals are amazing and look flawless and bring magic to the screen, the colors and creatures of this world are wonderful. DP Dariusz Wolski did a great job with this film as it looks excellent.

Now if the story changes are too much for you in the script or you feel Burton's take was not what you expected there is one thing you can count on, the performances. We will start with our lead, Mia Wasikowska, the way she portrays Alice is wonderful. In fact it is possible she may be the best Alice yet from all of the live action films and TV shows. Johnny Depp of course is excellent as The Mad Hatter and brings a new version of the famous charter to life, switching between a sweet yet mad version and a more menacing version when talking about the Red queen and such. Depp has always been able to bring any character to life and does a great job here, especially after watching the special features I love this Hatter. Just an example is how Depp had them put one eye slightly off from the other, the reason for doing so, you will have to buy and see for your self.

Now before I get to any one else I have to say my absolute favorite in the film for sure is the Red Queen, Helena Bonham Carter. I have to admit that I love her as she is one of my favorite actresses ever, of all time, and well you get the idea. Her over sized head just gave me more to look at while she was giving the show stealing performance in my opinion. She hits the ""Off with his head"" line perfectly throughout the film and delivers me and my girl's favorite part off the film. That of course is when she yells ""IDIOT"" at Stayne; you know she is very much like my lady in this film. She yells that at me a lot 2, I'll let it slide today. Speaking of Stayne Crispin Glover as does an excellent job in this film and looks very, well, awkward I guess as he is very tall and thin. Still it was cool to see him in another theatrical release; I have always liked him [""Willard"" is a classic].

As for the rest of the cast they are all as good as the ones previously mentioned such as Anne Hathaway who plays the White Queen. Matt Lucas plays both the Tweedle brothers, Michael Sheen is the rabbit, Alan Rickman plays the Blue Caterpillar, but the show stealer from voice over characters has to be Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat. He steals every scene that he shows up in plus he is a big lazy looking cat like one that I own [it is her cat I swear, she made me get it, I never wanted to own cats but she forced them upon me I swear]. Well regardless of that the Cat is still a bright spot in this film, in fact the one thing that people who didn't like the movie can agree upon is that the acting was great.

I must also say that the special features on this 3 Disc edition are wonderful and highly recommended, so get the Blu-Ray/DVD combo like we did. Also I think another reason I enjoyed this film so much [aside from Helena Bonham Carter, love her] is that my girl she loves Depp] and little cuz had a wonderful time with this film. Of course my cuz loved it because she is 6 and was completely sucked in by the wonderful images and characters that were before her. Whatever the case was for why I enjoyed this film so much I guess it really doesn't matter, this review is for my lady since she loved this film and would give it 5 out of 5.

Johnny Depp was a character that you thought was crazy and sweet at the same time.  Alice was just stand offish enough to fit in the world but then grew her character to become the heroine.  All in all, a very enjoyable movie with colors and delights that I wouldn't imagine could exist in a Tim Burton film.",1278374400,,595,4.422018348623853
3639527,4,B001HN6940,"There seems to be a new constant surrounding Tim Burton: the cast will most likely include Johnny Depp and real-life companion Helena Bonham Carter, that it will be visually arresting and have incredibly unique art designs, and will most likely include the music compositions of Danny Elfman. But now there's a 4th: it might not be that good. Ever since Mars Attacks! in 1996, he's been weirdly inconsistent from the great (Big Fish, Sleepy Hollow, Sweeney Todd) to the mediocre (Planet of the Apes, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). It's hard to tell whether it's studio manhandling or whether he's lost ""the touch"" or whatever it is but the one-after-another success of the late 80's/early 90's is kind of gone and whenever he makes a good movie now, it almost seems like a ""finally!"" reaction than anything. So when faced with the notion of adapting one of the king's of wild imagery which is very present in the Alice in Wonderland story, I'm thinking Tim Burton, one of the last few directors with an unmistakable style, will go completely hog-wild with it. So visually, yeah, it works. The rest?

Rather than re-tell the old familiar story of young Alice encountering Wonderland for the first time, Burton and Co. instead do what Steven Spielberg did with ""Hook"": a returning hero who can't remember ever having been there but everyone knows they have. So this time we have 19 year old Alice journeying back to Underland (as ""Wonderland"" was what she thought it was) and revisiting the old characters from the pipe-smoking caterpillar Absolem, the dimwitted twins Twiddledee and Twiddledum, the time-obsessed White Rabbit and the Mad Hatter. But if everyone's back then that also means the Red Queen is as well and Alice returning isn't making anything easier on her still-present love of beheadings.

Disney so far has had an excellent track record with stunning Blu-Ray image transfers and this allows the visuals of the film to shine and Burton still continues his knack for making some unique and at times, almost stunning visuals. But then you see the images created by computers (of which there is many) and it becomes a bit too obvious and certain scenes and characters almost look unfinished and just scream ""we're green screen!"" but the film on a visual standpoint does have a great look about it, unfinished or no. The score though by Danny Elfman is quite strong and while I wouldn't say it's one of his top works on a Burton movie, it's certainly one of the better ones in years.

Now we come down to the casting which to be honest, is really all over the place. The lead role played by Mia Wasikowska is part of it as she indeed has that confidence and almost bravado about the role yet at the same time that wonder and ""what's going on?"" attitude is clearly missing. I mean, even though she can't remember the first time she's been there, having disappearing cats with huge smiles or walking playing cards would certainly bring a bigger reaction than she does. Johnny Depp seems to be echoing his eccentric role as Willy Wonka but it isn't quite as lovable as Captain Jack was, another unhinged character. But then we have Helena Bonham Carter nearly completely stealing the movie as the Red Queen with a bulbous head (which strangely enough seems unnecessary when you see how well she looks sans digital ballooning) and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. The voice work of Alan Rickman, Timothy Spall, Michael Sheen and Stephen Fry are very much recommended as well.

Another slight problem I have with the movie is that it just feels slow, not necessarily boring like others have said but on one hand I felt like I didn't want to turn the movie off as I was being entertained by what I was seeing but I felt like I needed some snap in its step if you will, just a quicker pace. But then the 3rd act comes in and it's almost like a watered-down Chronicles of Narnia ending complete with a fight against a fire-breathing dragon, Alice in a metal knight armor and that damn DANCE! It's here the 3rd act just becomes too noticeable as a problem and whether you're into the tone and pace and visuals of the film or not, the last parts feel really out of place.

Is the film worth seeing? I would suggest a viewing but when you have people saying it was one of the worst films this year to other people saying they really loved it, well, kind makes a recommend hard but I will say that the film isn't a travesty nor is it a misunderstood masterpiece.

All the ""Alice"" movies I've seen were so fairytale-ish they seemed rather stupid to me as an adult. However, Burton's version gives more depth to the characters and gives adults something to relate to. Of course, I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp, and his portrayal of The Mad Hatter was brilliant. And I cannot leave out Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen, also amazing.

3639556,4,B001HN6940,"I like Tim Burton and I liked this movie. Johnny Dep is always great but if you are looking for the traditional ""Alice"" story you will find this confusing...creative but confusing.",1278201600,,180,4.838709677419355
3639557,1,B001HN6940,"Once there lived a man named Tim Burton who created magical worlds and stories such as ""Beetlejuice"", ""Batman Returns"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", and ""Charlie and Chocolate Factory."" These films films dropped you into a world and sucked you into the plot. You were able to connect with the characters and felt like you were inside the world of the films I listed above. When the technology of computer generated imagery alias 'CGI', come around, it changed the structure of story telling and film making...for the good? Well all I can say is I feel some directors have been abusing CGI and when I watch these over grossed CGI films I don't feel connect with the film or characters as much (I'm for CGI but only when used as a story teller (ex. ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Tin Man"",""Lord of the Rings Trilogy"" and ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" for a few.) Tim Burton has fallen into the technology trap that George Lucas did on the ""Star Wars Prequels"" and has many other film makers. Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" is a film that could have been really good, but fails to live up to my expectations as a big lover of the original novel by Lewis Carrol.

Oh yes, speaking of the original novel ""Alice in Wonderland,"" Burton's adaptation, if its a adaptation at all, is poorly developed. It takes what Mr. Carrol originally created as an innocent children story and distorts it into a complicated action plot with silly dialog and un-logical references to the original novel. By the way, what is up with filling wonderland with action scenes and a underground resistance? WHEN DID WONDERLAND TURN INTO NARINA???

I have heard that some people thought the film focused too much on the Mad Hatter, but in all honesty, I thought it focused too  on that god annoying Red Queen played by Helena Charter. I now she is Burton's domestic partner, but what the hell is up with him always casting her in his films? I mean good grief! Whenever Burton comes out with a film nowadays that he directed I already know who is going to be in the film, Johnny Depp and Helena Charter, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO MICHAEL KEATON?? why did they break up after ""Batman Returns?"" that was great film. I didn't enjoy watching the film either, well that is too say really enjoyed the opening of the film. The scenes that took place in England (before Alice fell down the rabbit hole) was really well photographed, and the part when Alice falls down the rabbit hole was entertaining to say the least, but after she enters Wonderland it started to get ridiculous. As I watched the film I was comparing it to Burton's '80s and '90s films.

I have become spectacle of Burton. He is now only doing films for Disney and I understand he is on contract to direct of live action version of Malificent, which will be a retelling of Cinderella. Oh no, hell no. why doesn't he just retire, he hasn't really done anything really good since ""Sleepy Hollow"" I liked ""Charlie the Chocolate Factory"" but he is slipping and needs to retire for heaven's sake. To summarize this awfully long review, I will just say to skip this film and watch a older Burton film.",1278201600,18,3094,4.609800362976406
3639558,4,B001HN6940,I like the way they translated this movie to the big screen.  The characters and costumes were great.  I'm not really a big Johnny Depp fan but I think he handled the character the Mad Hatter well.,1278201600,,197,4.297297297297297

It is a little off-beat from the cartoon by Disney but I enjoyed this movie very much. I did not like the ending too much, I thought that she would meet Johnny Depp after she came back from Wonderland. I figured he would be a real person that she would fall in love with. I am a ""Happy Ever After"" romatic person. The story line was very good. The acting (by all participants) was very good also. This is a very good movie and well worth buying it. I am not sure about youngsters watching it. They might not understand it. It might frighten them (the monster at the end).

it's an intangible thing, but there is a certain SOMETHING with some of the scenes, the smiling cat, the tea party... it all feels ""right""... and of course, the cast was absolutely perfect.

3639573,4,B001HN6940,I alway enjoy Tim Burton/Johnny Depp colaberations and this one didn't disappoint.  I loved this movie and the unique way Tim Burton spun the story.,1277856000,,148,4.92
3639574,3,B001HN6940,"The classic Alice in Wonderland story by Lewis Carroll is, in my opinion, a thin story. It was a profound statement regarding the fantastic for it's time but does not hold a candle to modern masterpieces of fantasy fiction. But it is nothing if not weird, and weirdness is what longtime fantasy director Tim Burton thrives on. What makes Alice inn Wonderland ultimately nothing special is the fact that it succumbs to the thinness of Carroll's storyline. Burton innovates the same way High School Musical 3 innovates from High School Musical 2, by taking Alice through the same steps that Carroll laid out for her as a teenager instead of a hapless little girl. There is no painting of roses in this take on Wonderland, or Underland, as Burton's creatures continously call it.

  As in any Tim Burton film, we find Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter doing what they do best, being strange. Mrs. Carter and Mr. Depp are both very accomplished actors outside of the Burton sphere, but under his direction they are nothing nore than glorified chadpricatures, circus sideshow acts to be ogled at and talked about by audience after audience. They are buzz generating vehicles, which make both the Mad Hatter and the Queen of Hearts very one dimensional characters, interesting but without depth.

  I argue that Alice in Wonderland is attractively designed and weird enough to focus a certain degree of interest, but the plot is wandering and boring, with an ineffective, complete with a made for 3-D climax. Best to skip this one.",1277769600,4,1528,4.88030888030888
3639585,3,B001HN6940,"Tim Burton needs to take a break. If you need any proof of that, look no further than Alice in Wonderland. Not only did this movie make me fall asleep twice, but it's one of those movies where big name actors play characters that barely have any dialogue, and could've been played by no-names and gotten the same result. But that's not the big problem I have. Nope, it's that there's nothing interesting about this iteration of Alice in Wonderland at all. As usual, Burton goes for his usual 'twisted' art style with the classic characters, but he forces so many different characters in the movie that there's nothing but wasted potential here, especially by John Depp as the Mad Hatter. Who was it that was featured the most in the previews for this movie? Him. How much does he do in this movie that you didn't already see in the trailers? Not much. And it's sad too because you can tell that Depp could've done A LOT with this character. But that's just one of many, many problems. While it isn't the pile that a computer put out and then laminated like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was, it's close.

If you don't know the main plot by now, Alice has grown up, and abandons a proposal/marriage when she spots the white rabbit at said proposal location, and falls down the rabbit hole once again. She ends up in Wonderland, now known as Underland, and things aren't as bright and cheery as they were when she was little. The Red Queen has taken over, and she rules Underland with her super weapon- a dragon known as the Jabberwocky. Apparently, Alice is the chosen one who'll save Underland and slay the Jabberwocky, restoring balance to the Force...I mean, Wonderland. She gets the help of the Mad Hatter and several others who are all sick of the Red Queen, including her sister, the White Queen.

Oddly enough, most people who praise this movie only go on about how beautiful it is, or just go on about the art direction, or how they love John Depp. You never hear a single thing about Alice herself, and there's a reason for that- she's boring. I've watched this movie three times now- the first two times I fell asleep, and the third time I managed to stay awake. They couldn't have gotten a more flat, dry actress to play Alice. I think Al Gore can display feelings better than whoever this person was. In fact, aside from being ""the chosen one"" here, Alice barely does anything in the movie thanks to the other characters being crammed into the story. Depp as the Mad Hatter, like I said earlier, was ok, but he didn't really do that much. Most of the laughs come from his facial expressions and that's it. Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen was the main scene stealer, and while I didn't get a kick out of her scenes as most people did, I can honestly say that she's one of two characters that truly stand out. As with all of Carter's performances, she gives it her all, and I appreciate that. The other character that stands out, and the only reason I'm adding a second star to the rating, is Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. She didn't exactly stretch her acting skills, but my god was she -gorgeous-. So gorgeous that she had my full attention every time she was on-screen. Yes, it's a dumb reason to add a star, but when the rest of the movie is so dull, it works for me.

The rest of the cast is a bunch of minor characters, most of who are played by well-respected actors who probably got a million bucks each for their short time here. Christopher Lee plays the Jabberwocky, and literally has only 4 sentences of dialogue. Alan Rickman as the caterpillar? I love Rickman and all, but Burton really needs to stop calling in his buddies for roles and going with people who could probably do a much better job, and cost less than half the money. My other complaints have to do with the use of CG. Don't get me wrong- I'm not one of those anti-CG people who are a dime a dozen these days. In fact, I thought the CG characters looked good for the most part. But...people who are part CG and part real, like Crispin Glover's character, were just distracting. Had they just made the whole movie in CG, I probably would've liked it a little more. Finally, there are a good number of scenes here that were so obviously made with the 3D version in mind that, just like the CG/human hybrids, they were distracting. Alice growing huge, then small, then huge again being the main example.

As for the blu-ray itself, one reason I'm bumping this up a star...it's loaded. The picture and audio are both perfect, and sure to impress people with your home theater system. And the extras have damn-near everything you could possibly want to know about the making of the movie, except for a commentary track. Otherwise, they threw in everything and the kitchen sink with extras. Character concept art, music, behind the scenes, you name it. A lot of it's interesting, and it'll take a few hours to go through the extras. Trust me when I say that I'd need more room for the review if I were to go over everything.

Had Burton focused on the script more than being a 'visionary', this movie could've been so much more. Instead, he continues making movies for himself and his friends rather than audiences. What happened to the guy who made Beetlejuice, Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Batman, Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands? I really can't believe this movie did as well as it did in theaters, unless most of the people who went to see it had just got done partying and looking for a certain kind of trip. It seems that all Burton needs to do to make a movie is hire Depp and his wife, call in Danny Elfman for the score, and make sure there are 'twisted' tweaks made to inanimate objects.",1277769600,2,5688,4.475915221579961

Tim Burton's vision and Depp's Mad Hatter come together in a stunning tour-de-force of live action w/cgi in an enchanting tale of the Next chapter of Alice in Wonderland, as Alice is grown up and returns to Wonderland to 'save the day' in this brilliant adaptation of the classic.

Depps' best work since Jack Sparrow.  Wonderful characterizations from all the rest of the cast too, who work together flawlessly as an ensemble team; the chemistry and ""fit"" is right on the money.

I'm glad they did the 'next chapter' as a story arc vs a straight retelling of the tale, which adds depth and continuity to this classic tale.  Perfect for children and adults alike, this is a thoroughly enjoyable story that captures the magic of Alice with humor, stunning effects and more.  One of the best family films since the original Shrek.

Thanks to all who worked on this title, it must've been a ton of work to produce, direct, design and composite, and it's done flawlessly.  Our family will watch this many times in the years to come; thanks for creating this truly captivating movie, Tim.  I hope you folks will do a trilogy.  Bravo!

3639635,5,B001HN6940,"I always find something to love about Tim Burton's insane epics. In spite of the annoyingly convoluted ending of his adaptation of Willy Wonka, There were numerous reasons to enjoy that film. So, I was definitely ready for a Wonderland re-do, as I always loved the story but felt that there should be a different adaptation, bringing a freshness to the Alice story. Well, Burton certainly delivered there, though there are a couple snags he could have worked out a bit more.

Burton's favorite stablemate Depp is flawlessly fantastic as the Mad Hatter. Just when you start to believe he has too much to do in the movie, he suddenly surprises you with his many talents again, making viewers happy that he always seems to be there as big as life in order to keep everyone enjoying the journey.

Alice's character goes from whimsically perplexed to nonchalant to heroically motivated with a calmness that is rarely seen quite as necessarily suitable in a Burton film.

The Red Queen is positively preposterous at every turn, demanding everyone's head's be lopped off in nearly every scene she appears and her sister the white queen is sickeningly sweet in the most macabre, understated, unsettling and twisted way.

The Cheshire cat's toothy grin looks like something out of Burton's stop action animation films and is entirely creepy. I felt cheated each time he made an appearance and disappeared. I wanted to see more of him, no pun intended.

The sets are lavish in their computer driven design. The paintbox is supremely stupendous in it's strange concoction of bright colors and almost nightmarish feel. Effects like the Red Queen's enormous head and small body are so perfectly executed, you would swear that Helena looked like this in real life.

So, if the movie a 100% success? No, there are little things that will leave you wondering, yet you won't care because the film's shortcomings are so overshadowed by Burton's ability to bring so many elements together in his unique story weaving.

Ultimately, this version of Alice will have you believing in six impossible things before breakfast too, and isn't that what Wonderland is supposed to be all about?",1277510400,5,2164,4.9449035812672175

3639642,3,B001HN6940,"Perhaps an alternate title for Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" should have been ""Green Screen Theatre,"" because that's all I see when I look at this film - people standing around pretending to talk to and interact with invisible objects. As a viewer it was not engaging at all. The CG was very cartoonish and distracting, and really made me miss the days when movies used actual sets and props to tell their stories. Now, I know  these kinds of movies are meant as a kind of mental escape, a fantasy, and I'm sure they are still fully capable of sparking the imaginations of young children, which is good, but on the other hand I feel sort of bad for the kids today growing up on this stuff because they'll never appreciate the TRULY innovative movies like Wizard of Oz or Willy Wonka, or god forbid anything animated in 2-D. Not that ""Alice"" was all around a bad movie, because at face value it's actually very entertaining and the costumes are terrific. But for me personally, the magic is lost when you know the whole thing was made over the course of a month on someone's laptop computer. Plus these Johnny Depp/Tim Burton collaborations are getting old. They had one good movie like 20 years ago and have recycled the same old shtick six or seven times since then in some form or another, and quite frankly I'm bored with both of them. Both are extremely talented, creative men in their own right, but have fallen into a rut these past few years and really need to branch out.",1277337600,,1484,4.516728624535316

My guess is burton didn't get the budget he wanted from Disney and fudged this one. it should be swept under the rug and forgotten. don't even waste your money buying it on Blu Ray

JOHNNY DEPP....without a doubt one of this generations great actors....is unable to rescue his insipid part and his dance at the end is definetly the career low point for DEPP.
BURTON is hit and miss at best and this is the greatest stinker that he has yet produced. It is amazing that the film was released in this form as anyone watching the final cut would have to shudder at the crap they've created. There are so many opportunities for some smart dialogue or some comic scenes with the characters that make up the story, but not ONE opportunity is taken and the dialogue is too stupid for even the youngest viewer.

It would have been better maybe, or a little more entertaining at least, had they just used clips from the other movies.  For example, if you splice together Lord of The Rings and The Chronicles of Narnia you have seen this film, but unfortunately this film is still not interesting.  The film has some good points and lines, but because of its problems these seem like cheese on a lousy meal.

And the special effects may be groundbreaking (I don't know if they are, and I'm not about to look into it because I already feel this film has wasted too much of my time) but they don't really look convincing.  Tweedledee and Tweedledum for example look like what they are- a man's face stretched and morphed onto a CG body.  This kept taking me out of the story.  Not that it took much to take me out of it since it was boring and didn't make sense.  Why does Alice come to Wonderland the first time?  Where is Wonderland?  Who are the Red and White Queens?  What happened between them and why is the Red Queen able to hold power?  Why is Alice the only one that can restore the White Queen?

Instead of answering these questions and making an interesting movie we get the following:  Alice is to be wed in real life, but!...she doesn't want to and the guy is creepy!  She walks away from the proposal to have a think and falls down a big, big hole.  She sees some folks who ask her if she is Alice.  Is she?  Isn't she?  Is she again?  Isn't she again?  Maybe she is.  Maybe she isn't.  One thinks she is.  But no, perhaps she is not.  After some chases there is a big battle.  Oh my God- it's a battle between the Red and White Queen!  What!  Then the White Queen gets back the crown, and the Red Queen goes away.  Roll credits.

The cover of the DVD tells you that this film doesn't really have a direction.  Alice, our main character who takes up the majority of screen time, is to the side on the cover looking off at what, we don't know.  The Mad Hatter is in the center of the cover, skipping along, looking at us for some reason (this role could have been interesting, if the subtleties of this character were explained in the movie- bit they aren't, enough said).  And the Rabbit is also on the cover- oh my God! - listening to his clock; I have never seen that before!

This movie put all its eggs in the computer animation basket, and since they don't really help the already very slighted story, the whole thing is a boring wash.  Alice could have been a good film if it had been a film and not just a technical and marketing exercise.",1277078400,15,2630,4.253036437246964
3639660,5,B001HN6940,"This movie is a lot of fun. The point of seeing this is to look at the same story through a new perspective. Looking at life through a new mind is the purpose of a remake.

Before you watch this- read Alice in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass, shove the memories in a jar, shake them up and pour them through Tim Burton's creative process. I think his vision was captivating. I found myself loving the mad hatter and wishing him a friend of mine. I loved the silliness strewn about and I loved the art. I loved Alice and the costumes and the general madness.

I loved it.

For teenagers and adults the story will be interesting although at times it's slow.  There's a big battle scene that goes on too long, but over all the pacing is decent and story multilevel.  My favorite character in the movie is the Red Queen; over the top and so fun to watch and listen to.  Alice was a little weak, and Depp's Mad Hatter was sympathetic and damaged, but pulls through in the end.  Don't get it expecting Disney, as many have said.

3639662,5,B001HN6940,"Adored this movie! The film's premise is Alice (Mia Wasikowska) as a young woman of 19, on the verge of a serious life choice---whose only reprieve is the ""deja vu"" return down the rabbit hole to ""Wonderland."" The viewer is visually stunned by the magical scenery in all its nightmarish luminescence. Tim Burton perfectly captures the balance between darkness and light...his characters creepily loveable, charming and magical. Alice has an opportunity for distraction and to save herself in both worlds, the real and dream worlds...but which is which and how are they conjoined? Gotta see the show for the outcome!!

Johnny Depp is perfect as the Mad Hatter...doing his best to be consistent, a difficulty for someone enduring madness. He tries though.. betwixt his confusion, resignation, anxiety, loss, and disorientation. The hatter does indeed realize a noble calling as the aide to our young heroine, played beautifully by Wasikowska. He steps forward with courage when the situation demands and dances with jubilation (a cool street dance) as a tribute to success.

My favorite character was Stephen Fry, as the eerily, smoky blue Cheshire cat. Fry definitely stole the spotlight with his ""toothpaste ad marquee"" grin, unshakable confidence, misty, ethereal presence...an utter delight! Disney on Acid? Maybe aptly described by another critic...but how sublime...a nightmare is not about Care Bears frolicking in the clover. Kudos to Helene Bonham Carter...she aced her role, and i enjoyed her outlandish performance, along with her evil sidekick, Stayne (Crispin Glover). Anne Hathaway did a decent job, yeah, maybe a wee bit restrained but it could have been the botox...Alan Rickman as the caterpillar was the all knowing ""Yoda"" of nightmares...his voice and cadence well suited for the role.

The 2010 ""Alice in Wonderland"" has an enchanting spark that somehow eluded Disney nearly 60 years earlier. Mia Wasikowska's inspired performance as a refreshingly mature Alice is well-matched by Helena Bonham Carter's wicked Red Queen and Johnny Depp's twisted Mad Hatter. A tad slow at times, but endlessly imaginative in the Burton tradition. In fact, the new version would make a terrific double-bill with ""Beetlejuice.""",1276905600,,620,5.67741935483871

3639675,2,B001HN6940,"Something has gone afoul in Wonderland. This is not Lewis Carroll's Wonderland, it's Tim Burton's, and it is as wondrous and curious as ever. Rather than simply recreating the world that we've seen adapted so many times from Carroll's source material, Burton and screenwriter Linda Woolverton have developed an entirely new spin on the world and the characters that inhabit it. There are some very interesting Burton-esque alterations that update the elements of Alice's journey quite nicely. Many touches don't work, and some are catastrophic to the film's integrity.

Woolverton's script essentially picks up where Carroll's story and other variations of it left off. Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is nineteen, and about to be forced into marriage to a pompous, snotty Lord, when she decides to run off to escape from this unbearable fate. Once again, she discovers and falls way down the rabbit hole, and so begin her adventures through ""Wonderland."" She encounters all new versions of Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas), the Chesire Cat (Stephen Fry), the blue hookah-smoking caterpillar (Alan Rickman), the white rabbit (Michael Sheen), the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), and of course, the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter).

What is interesting is that Woolverton has more-or-less written a sequel, and it's one that follows a far more linear, traditional path of storytelling than Carroll's book. Alice doesn't experience a series of independent encounters that are meaningless to one another, but rather travels on a fluid course. She also has a purpose this time around. Her ""destiny"": to slay the Jabberwocky and return the throne to the White Queen (Anne Hathaway). Unfortunately, because there is a mission with a deadline, Burton doesn't spend enough time examining and sharing many of these characters with us. The one's he does show off the most become annoying, with the exception of Carter's Red Queen, who is very funny and fresh. Carter is one of the most underrated actresses around today, and her performance here inspires pure delight.

Frankly, I got downright sick of Depp's Scottish, somewhat satanic Mad Hatter. He has some nice moments in his first scene, but its all downhill from there, as he descends into incoherent, unfunny silliness, that is far off the path of what the character is supposed to be. I think that it proves that Depp's subtler characters are more memorable, and more inspired, such as in 'Ed Wood' and 'Sweeney Todd.' When it comes to the pairing of Burton and Depp, there is often genius created, but not this time. This performance reminded me more of Depp's Willy Wonka, in that it stands out for all the wrong reasons, particularly the catastrophic, unthinkably out of place moment in which the Hatter dances some strange dance. I shuddered in my seat.

I wanted to see more of the blue caterpillar, which is one of the best versions I've seen thanks to Rickman's voice performance. The same goes for the Cheshire cat, I wanted more, and got less. Burton and Woolverton do explore the world in some depth, and some of the long shots of the land and of the Queen's castle are fantastic, visually. The story parallels the brilliant visuals nicely until the third act, which is filled with climactic clichs and battles with predictable finishes. As a follow up to 'Sweeney Todd', 'Alice in Wonderland' is a disappointment. Tim Burton could have really taken this material and run with it, but instead, he has settled for formula sprinkled with moments of intrigue and wonder. However, since the build up to the final third has such moments, the final sequence can be forgiven for some, not all, of its flaws. That damn dance! I just can't grasp it.

A key issue with Burton's direction and Woolverton's script is this: Carroll's Alive in Wonderland was, more or less, episodic in structure. Woolverton's idea to reconstruct the story in a traditional, linear way could perhaps work in another life. Unfortunately, in order for it to work, the characters would require more depth in order for them to fit into a story like Burton has created here. These are characters with shallow, episodic presence, in a film trying to tell a beginning-middle-end story. It is a major misstep that prevented this movie from being truly interesting.

*I would like to mention Crispin Glover, who plays Stayne, the Red Queen's right hand man. Glover is an actor who I've always enjoyed watching do his thing, and as usual, he is given the creepiest role in the film. It's what he's best at, and he does a knock out job delivering the line, ""I like largeness."" A crucial line, and for delivering it with such precision, Mr. Glover, I salute you.",1276905600,6,4669,4.964194373401535
3639676,5,B001HN6940,"This is a wonderful movie, and should be accepted for what it is.  The ""bookends"" do a great job of foreshadowing the story and bringing to its climax. When she was a young girl, Alice knew who she was and what was inside her.  Even at age 7, as she feared for her sanity due to her recurring nightmare, she demonstrated her awareness/consciousness of her ""self."" As happens to most of us as we grow up, Alice begins to behave in a manner that suits others and is expected of her.  She loses her ""muchness"" - that part of her - deep inside her- that defines who she is.  This story is not about Alice's battle with the Jabberwocky; it is about her search for herself. To paraphrase:  ""The decision is hers - when she faces the creature, she will be alone."" This is not a reference to the Jabberwocky; it's a pivotal insight to her future - when she makes decisions, she is the one who will live with the consequences, not the people who are expecting her to behave in accordance with their standards.

The cast is phenomenal, the colors and imagery are amazing. The Mad Hatter's accent changes in responses to where (and when) his personality is living. To truly understand the movie, watch it with the English subtitles, and watch the bonus features - but only after you've watched it at least once just for fun.

Just watch the DVD extras to get an idea just how much effort went into creating AIW.I'm not sure if Disney had this version of Wonderland in mind when they gave this project to Burton. Maybe Disney wanted a live version of their animated Alice in Wonderland,like they did with 101 Dalmations. Regardless,this version of AIW has been given a dark,adult edge.(At least as much as could get by Disney's censors.)The White and Red Queen drop a number of subtle hints as to the VERY adult goings-on in Wonderland. Fortunately, most of those won't spoil the beauty of this movie. What an excellent idea to give Christopher Lee the speaking role of the Jabberwock,even if it's only 3 of 4 lines.

The visuals are gorgeous and really creative, Wonderland is in one word ""fantastic"", the characters blend effortessly in the Wonderland scenery (sorry Underland).

Johhny Depp is fantastic as the Mad Hatter as is Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. Crispin Glover also was good as the Knave of Hearts.

Mia Wasikowska gave an excellent first impression in the title role. As conclusion, Disney and Burton delivered an imaginative, visually stunning, well performed film.

The Bluray/DVD/Digital Copy combo is excellent. The picture looks stunning in Bluray and Wonderland is gorgeus. The sound is equally impressive. An excellent transfer.

3639683,5,B001HN6940,"If you are a fan of Lewis Carroll's classic ""Alice in Wonderland,"" you will either love or hate this film - maybe some will find an in-between. It really depends on your take of the novel, and how you view it on the screen. In this particular case, Tim Burton was the director selected to put his very particular (i.e. dark) vision on film. The result, as I said, depends on your understanding of the original novel. Having said that, I found the movie to be quite entertaining and colorful, provided with great photography, and with the Burton signature on it.

The film begins with little Alice having a nightmare - one of many --, and being consoled by her loving and understanding father. It turns out that both Alice and her father have great imagination, and he instills in her not to be afraid and follow her dreams. We then fast-forward some years, and we find out that Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is now a beautiful 19-year old young lady. Sadly, her father passed away some years before. We meet her in an elaborated party, when she is about to get engaged to a young man that she dislikes. However, just about when she unwillingly is about to give the ""yes"", in front of many guests and relatives, a rabbit calls her attention, and she decides to follow him. The chase makes her fall into a deep hole, taking her to a surreal Underland. Once there, she meets and make friends with a series of characters, including the Cheshire Cat, Tweedledee & Tweedledum, the White Rabbit, and many more. And, of course, there is also the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp). Together they will join forces to fight the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and Stayne (Crispin Glover - who else?), her right hand, and return the power to the White Queen (Anne Hathaway), its rightful and generous owner. By doing so, they'll first have to defeat the equally evil Jabberwocky.

As I mentioned earlier, if you are a fan of the original book, perhaps your take on ""Alice in Wonderland,"" the movie, will be critical. Having that in mind, the film will prove to be good fun for almost all the family. The 3-Disc combo Pack includes a Blu-ray disc, a DVD version of the film, and a digital copy. The excellent Blu-ray disc, in addition to the film, is loaded with extras - some features explore the film's characters (Finding Alice, the Mad Hatter, The Futterwacken Dance, The Red Queen, and more) and other take a look at the making-of the movie (Scoring Wonderland, Stunts of Wonderland, Tea party Props, etc.).

But in this story her journey through the land of Wonder is too vegetarian.  Of course confusion needs unconfusing and strength needs to be returned, but there should be meat to why the answers need questions.  The prelude to her fall down the rabbit hole isn't good enough.  And neither is the support cast, save the insane door mouse, the Dweetles, and the Red Queen.  Johnny Depp is very actorish as the Mad Hatter, making a bad call returning to a Scottish accent one too many (meaning once might have been too many) and stealing from Mike Myers (deep voice, barely breathing while speaking).  Anne Hathaway is a mannequin in her role as the White Queen and I feel for her in the same way I do my neighbors fence.  The Chesher Cat, who I wanted to love, lacked charm or humor or or.  Yes, it definitely lacked enough or.

But again, it's the playfulness and the close-your eyes beauty of Um from Umbridge that makes this movie feel like a home.  I doubt you'll stay long enough to where you'll buy an in ground swimming pool, but you'll be happy about having lived there when you get to where you are.

Have a happy frabjous day.",1276387200,,1725,4.453674121405751
3639698,4,B001HN6940,"As an Burton fan, I was not disappointed.  Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Anne Hathaway were perfect in their roles.  Mia Wasikowska was fantastic as Alice and I hope we see more of her in the future.  Some people complained that the Real 3D version wasn't what they expected, but I was quite pleased; the movie was like watching a giant View Master slideshow!
I bought the DVD edition because I don't see some big thrill in the Blu-Ray items.  Remember when we had VHS?  Disney is pushing Blu-Ray because it is durable.  Come on, really?  Treat your DVDs with care and respect and they will last forever.  More room?  There are only three short features on Alice in Wonderland, but I remember DVDs being able to hold a ton of information.  Disney, please STOP pushing Blu-Ray and cheating DVD fans out of features; a second disc of special features wouldn't have costed you much.",1276387200,3,888,4.634615384615385
3639699,5,B001HN6940,"I was totally disinterested in seeing this movie until I saw the preview at the El Capitan. Visually, this movie had me hooked immediately! Lush (yet dark), detailed, and full of wonderful imagery, it was a feast for the eyes. The movie itself didn't disappoint, and neither did this blu-ray version. Rather than retell the previously oft-filmed tale, Burton picks up where the other two Lewis Carroll tales ended and gives us an exploration of Alice's emotional state as she transitions from childhood to adulthood. Alice's father has passed on, and she is about to be proposed to by an extremely nerdy (but wealthy) Lord. Unsure that this is the future that she wants, escapes the engagement party by following the white rabbit and promptly falling into a rabbit hole to find herself in Underland. Much darker than the Wonderland we are used to, Underland is held hostage by the evildoings of The Red Queen. Waiting for Alice to find her ""muchness"" and rescue it, The Mad Hatter and The White Queen have waited a long time for her to return. Will Alice be up to the task of leading The White Queen's Army to save Underland?

It is a lot of fun along the way with fantastic performances by the Tim Burton troupe of actors that you usually find in his flicks: Johnny Depp (a perfectly fresh interpretation of The Mad Hatter, thus redeeming himself from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Charlie-and-the-Chocolate-Factory/dp/B000BBOUU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</a>), Helena Bonham Carter (practically steals the show as The Red Queen), Crispin Glover (characteristically dark, quirky, and evil as The Knave of Hearts), and Anne Hathaway (showing her acting versatility as The White Queen). With all of the talent surrounding her, it is a testimony to the talent of Mia Wasikowska (Alice) that she is able to act without getting swallowed up and upstaged by the others.

There are plenty of special effects and computer graphics here, but the fantastic part is that one only notices the beauty of the film and the wonderfully wacky characters. The mood of the film is enhanced by the music of Danny Elfman.

As for the quality of the blu-ray transfer, it is superb. Just as in the theater, the computer graphics are well rendered and the picture is rich (albeit dark because of the tone of the film) and the sound is rich and robust.

Wonderland Characters (27:56)

1. Finding Alice: Talks about Alice's emotional journey as she learns to embrace her courage and matures into womanhood.

2. The Mad Hatter: Depp talks about how The Mad Hatter has been frozen in time, waiting for Alice to return. Interesting to hear how he developed his characterization. Both he and Burton independently made sketches of how they thought the character should look. Very cool to see them side-by-side!

3. The Futterwacken: This is the one part of the movie I thought was lame. Still, the guy who did the dance for Depp (yup, just found out it wasn't Depp who actually danced in the movie! As he states, ""Another man futterwacked for me!"") is very talented. He was found through a clip on Youtube!

4. The Red Queen: Carter obviously relished this role (even though she lost her voice daily from the loudness of her character). The combination of villainy and childlike petulance actually makes her somewhat endearing, and she pulls it off marvelously. Carter also loved the props--the glasses, the scepter. These were actual props (not CG) that helped her with her characterization.

5. Time Lapse: Sculpting the Red Queen: 3 hours each day in the makeup chair! See it all come together.

6. The White Queen: Hathaway's performance was an unexpected treat. Depp states, ""She made me jealous--I wanted to play the White Queen."" Burton let Hathaway show a little darkness and ""explore the off-side of someone who is supposed to be good."" Hathaway herself says that her character is ""A little ditsy, but very clued in--kind of a Norma Desmond thing.""

Making Wonderland (19:28)
1. Scoring Wonderland: Danny Elfman collaborates again with Tim Burton (for about the 12th time). You'll want to listen closely to the music on the next viewing after listening to Elfman talk about how and why he created some of the eerie vocal choruses in the film.

2. Effecting Wonderland: Tim Burton relates how the cast had to feel like they were in the real AND the unreal world. Really amazing what a fantastic job all the actors did, especially considering that many of the costumes, sets, and more were done post-production on the computer. The film is a melding of CG, motion capture, and live action. Interesting to see how the Red Queen's head is enlarged. This is all way beyond my comprehension of how they figured it out and then kept track of all this stuff!

3. Stunts of Wonerland: Garrett Warren (stunt coordinator) discusses how he read the script and had to break down each scene into what would need stunts and how they would be done. Shows green-screen filming of Mia as Alice as she tumbles down the rabbit hole.

4. Making The Proper Size: Tells of the frustration experienced by Mia when having to be different sizes in the film, acting towards different site lines since most of the size change was done post-filming on a computer.

5. Cakes of Wonderland: Made by the Cake Divas (Joan Spitler and Leigh Grode), even this tiny detail was given much attention. They researched and then baked items that would be found at a Victorian Tea Party. The table had to be reset 12 times! And yes, the ""Eat Me"" cake was truly edible, as Alice had to bite into it for filming 32 times.

6. Tea Party Props: details the decor on the Mad Hatter's tea party. The look is inspired by what one would expect at a wartime tea or the great depression. Much work had to go into this scene, as 3 of everything had to be made in addition to breakaway pieces for the destruction. In all, there were about 150 pieces to manage and keep track of.

Having said that, I loved this film! The graphics were awesome, the characters wonderfully quirky. I loved Anne Hathaway as the white queen and the rest of the cast was great, too.

Favorite scene: the tea party! I giggled and laughed all through that, starting when the Hatter walks the length of the table and breaks all the cups.",1276214400,,519,4.51063829787234
3639703,4,B001HN6940,"I expected to dislike this movie because weird, quirky, ""Edward Scissorhands"" type Johnny Depp movies are not my thing.  But I must say I did like this movie.  It is a Disney film, but isn't like the cartoon ""Alice in Wonderland"" really at all.  It also incorporates elements from the book that the original cartoon Disney version omitted.  And then it tells its own version.  Visually it is a beautiful movie.  The sets and computer generated creatures were done fabulously.  I was surprised to find Anne Hathaway in this film, didn't realize she was in it. Acting is very good as well.

The tale is of Alice, who has had nightmares about ""Wonderland"" since she was a girl.  After taking a minute after certain events in a gazebo, she finds herself falling down the rabbits hole.  The story begins in a similar manner to the cartoon, needless to say.  But once there she finds herself speculation of a prophecy regarding a hero to slay the Jaberwooky.  With assistance from the cheshire cat, the Mad hatter, and the White Queen Alice must determine if she has it in herself to be the hero of the prophecy or if she will agree with other's claims that she is the wrong Alice.",1276214400,,1175,4.569377990430622

3639707,3,B001HN6940,"Way back in my school days, I was required to read ""Alice in Wonderland."" I didn't care for the story, nor did I particularly understand it. It just didn't make good sense. Everyone else.seemed to understand and enjoy it, and, if course, it's widely regarded as a classic. References to the Mad Hatter, Tweedly-dee, Tweedly-dum, the cheshire cat and al the other bizarre characters are everywhere. So be it. In any case, my wife picked up the latest Tim Burton ""Alice in Wonderland"" DVD starring Johnny Depp and we watched it last night.

I have very mixed feelings about this DVD. On the one hand, the computer animation is just amazing! Real People are all mixed seamlessly with bizarre characters and an out-of-this-world landscape. Amazing! And in dazzling colors! Surely, the animation efforts of this movie will bring in some type of award. On the other hand, the story left me uninterested. I neither found it fascinating, humorous or compelling in any way. Instead I was counting the minutes until it was finally over. My wife felt much the same way, and she's a big fan of both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp and she loves the ""Alice in Wonderland"" story.

So, I'd give the animation 5 stars. The story and presentation perhaps 1 or 2. It was a disappointing DVD. And I still don't understand Alice in Wonderland. It still doesn't make good sense. Off with their heads!

3639708,1,B001HN6940,"This movie is one of the worst i have seen. If it hadn't been for that i Watched it in 3D, I would have left the cinema.",1276041600,4,120,3.4814814814814814
3639709,3,B001HN6940,"More of a sequel to the old animated Disney classic than a remake, Tim Burton's ""Alice in Wonderland"" is just the type of movie you'd expect when clashing Burton with Walt: it's beautiful yet strange, struggling yet touching. I saw this movie at the local cheap cinema, and felt it was worth two dollars (literally, two bucks for a ticket). And as I left the theater, I thought about how I felt about the movie.

The basic plot-line is well known; an older Alice returns to Wonderland to discover it broken and controlled by the Red Queen, and with the help of several old friends, has to find a way to defeat the Jabberwocky and save the mysterious land. Pretty straight-forward, not too complex, and not incredibly thought-provoking. I felt the story seriously sagged at parts; it was slow, and boring, and sometimes even confusing.

So why give it four stars? A few reasons, really. First of all, though I felt every actor and actress did an amazing job in this movie, the true star is Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter. In other film versions he is simply a flat, bizarre character we don't really care much about. But here Depp makes the character a real human, with ranging, fascinating emotions, and a mad, quirky personality I couldn't help but describe as charming. The other reason I enjoyed this movie was for its computer graphics; they made up well over 3/4 of the movie, and were done incredibly well. Though the amount of them might feel overwhelming at times, they still blew me away.

It's a movie with heart, but not much else. I believe Burton got a little carried away with the effects, and felt that he could lack a little plot and make it up with fancy effects. Sadly, he was wrong, but hey, nobody's perfect. The actress who portrayed Alice, Mia Wasikowska (what a last name!) did a good job, and acted well with Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter, whose head is swelled the whole movie, which makes it a bit odd to watch.

The other characters within the cast are all ranging; from talking bloodhounds to the familiar rabbit with a pocket-watch, and even the Jabberwocky (voiced fleetingly by Christopher Lee) makes a bold appearance. The costumes and make-up (especially on Depp) was all great, and though this movie is far from perfect, some qualities redeem it. Such as the final scene between Hatter and Alice; perhaps one of the most saddest scenes in a movie I've watched in awhile, I could really feel Depp's powerful acting through those large green eyes, and it makes me wonder if Hatter and Alice had more going on than what meets the eye.

Before I wrap this up, I have one huge thing to add about this movie: maybe you've heard of it, but there is a final dance scene by Depp's character. And it is absolutely atrocious. So bizarre and out-of-place, it truly kicked off a star when I wrote this. Not sure who's idea that was, but they need to get fired, seriously.

Alright, so that final dance scene aside: over-all, it's a good movie that had more potential than plot. I'll probably sucker and buy it for Depp's sake. Give it a try; I'll guarantee you'll get bored, but Depp, Carter, and even glimpses of a very well done Cheshire Cat saved this movie.",1275955200,,3181,4.591549295774648
3639710,4,B001HN6940,"This is a magical movie regardless of your age. Tim Burton is amazing, and yes, I agree, that this movie could have been ""darker"" in how it portrayed some of the characters (afterall, this is Tim Burton!) but I think it still works in it's own way. I like that it had a real storyline, there was a sense of start and end. I like that at the end we are not completely sure if she really experienced those adventures or if it was all really a dream. The conflicts she had in Wonderland were parallel to conflicts she was having ""up above"" (everyone telling her what to do, the personal battle of herself with those around her, should she get married or not?, the loss of her father....etc) which is often what occurs in dreams. There is definitely a feel of the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" in that it is about entering another world through some kind of strange portal, a child having to lead a battle between good and evil and hence saving the world and all creatures in it and the dreamlike quality of the whole adventure. But the visuals were great and overall it was worth watching. And who could resist a good Futterwack?!",1275955200,,1120,4.415458937198068

3639712,4,B001HN6940,"I got this movie mostly because it was on sale and I had a coupon. I do love the way it looks, kind of the way I love Sleeping Beauty. For a lot of people, however, the eye candy wasn't enough to overlook a story they found lacking. It also helps if you love all things Alice, or all things Tim Burton. I think it will entertain kids easily enough, but the movie itself isn't for everyone.

If you DO like the movie, or if you're getting it for kids, it's hard to go wrong with this edition. This package includes the movie in 3 formats-- blu ray, DVD, and a digital copy. Putting the digital copy into your media library on your PC is pretty straightforward, and I can't help thinking having multiple formats would save a lot of spats over who gets to watch what among the kids (and adults sometimes).

The extras are pretty typical ""making of"" featurettes that can be played all together or separately. I was surprised at how much of it was computer-generated or enhanced in some way. I don't usually watch these and only did so because I knew they were very short. Some people may be left wanting more, especially if you like director's commentary or extensive documentaries. You're paying for multiple formats here, and the extras are an afterthought.

The one downright irritating thing about this edition, as is the case with so many movies these days, is the multiple trailers and commercials that auto-play when you put the disc in. (The digital copy doesn't include this annoyance and I'm glad I wasn't forced to devote hard drive space to it.) You can skip the promo tracks-- a lot of discs don't let you do that, but it's still irritating, especially if you are going to be watching the movie a lot either by your own free will or with the kids.

Other than the previews, if you know you'll use the multiple formats and already love this version of Alice, this is a perfect choice. It's also a great gift for an Alice devotee if you don't know what format they will use, or when you don't know what kind of player they have, because this covers most of them.

Four stars because I love the visuals, and I want the multiple formats. Casual fans will want to see the movie before they buy it, and should consider whether they need all three versions before buying this package.",1275868800,,2286,4.45933014354067
3639713,3,B001HN6940,"OK, I know I'm going to upset a lot of people, but here is MY review of this movie:

I've seen CGI that was so real, so lifelike - regardless of the subject matter, that you could NOT help but believe what you were seeing on screen.  My problem comes to this; with all of the money and talent that Disney commands, why is the CGI so obvious and UN-believable?  Please don't tell me that if I saw it in 3-D it would be better.  I didn't.  I also didn't see the other examples of BELIEVABLE CGI in 3-D.  So the playing ground is level.  The story is fabulous, even this 'generation' of the story is fabulous.  Lewis Carroll was a genius.  The overall movie is quite good, and you can even make yourself overlook the piss-poor CGI and enjoy the movie.  But I wonder just how phenomenal the movie would have been if the CGI had been top-rate instead of second-rate.  As it stands, this is a good, entertaining movie.  However, it could have been a breathtakingly outstanding movie.  I also wonder about the wardrobe for the movie.  Granted, 'Alice' looked nice in her gown - but the time period would not have allowed a ""20 year old"" to be in a YOUNG juvenile dress - showing her lower legs (over the age of 12, this did not happen at this point in history), and bare arms OUTSIDE in the daytime just was NOT done! Why were 'Alice' and her sister the only ones to flout tradition and style by baring their arms during the day - outside, where they just might get SUN on their skin?  You might as well have put her in a spandex dance outfit, for all the historical accuracy - and YES, this does contribute to the believability, the 'feeling' of actually being there - in a movie.

Sorry Disney - you really flubbed this one, and I can't recommend it to anyone other than children.  And, it wasn't made for children, now was it?",1275868800,2,1822,4.296187683284457

3639740,5,B001HN6940,"A clever family film in which the 19-year old Alice returns to the world which she had originally visited at the age of six but had convinced herself was just a dream.

The story fuses elements of Lewis Carroll's original books ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Alice through the looking glass"" as well as the poem ""Jabberwocky."" It is more of a sequel than a re-interpretation though there are elements of both.

This film is significantly darker in tone than, say, the classic Disney film or even the original books, and I would not recommend this for a very young child who might find certain scenes frightening. However, my two eight-year-olds enjoyed the film and had little difficulty with it (they hid their eyes or behind mummy once or twice). The story appears to be at least as much intended for the adult members of the family as for the children, and the saccharine sweetness of many interpretations of the Wonderland story are almost wholly absent.

In places this film is very funny, exquisitely beautiful, or very exciting, and often several of those things at once. The first thing which makes it fun is the many excellent performances by the star-studded cast.

Mia Wasikowska is delightful as the 19-year old Alice, and Johnny Depp suitably manic as the Mad Hatter.

Helena Bonham Carter's character, the evil queen, is an amalgamation of the Queen of Hearts from ""Alice in Wonderland"" with the Red Queen from ""Alice through the looking glass."" Helena BC and Tim Burton appears to have modelled this character on Queen Elizabeth the First as played by Miranda Richardson in the second series of the British TV comedy Blackadder (link:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blackadder-2-The-Entire-Second-Series-1986-DVD/dp/B00004YN70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blackadder 2 - The Entire Second Series [1986] [DVD</a>]). The mannerisms, style of speaking, even the voice are a direct lift of ""Queenie"" from Blackadder but it works brilliantly. Crispin Glover is very funny as her evil henchman Stayne (the Knave of Hearts).

The Red Queen's sister and antithesis (the White queen), is played by Anne Hathaway, who comes over as a somewhat irritating goody-goody but one who is still far preferable to her sister as a ruler.

Much of the show is stolen by the CGI characters, particularly the Cheshire Cat (voiced by Stephen Fry), Absalom the blue caterpillar (voiced by Alan Rickman,) and the Doormouse (voiced by Barabara Windsor). The latter is not the soporific character of Carroll's original, but more like a female Reepicheep on steroids.

The Jabberwocky is a looming threat for most of the film but when it finally appears for the climax, a combination of superb special effects and a marvellously threatening voice provided by Christopher Lee make the beast magnificently scary.

Other cast members worth a mention include Tim Piggott Smith who has a charming cameo as Lord Ascott, the business partner of Alice's father: Geraldine James as his ghastly wife who wants Alice to marry their equally ghastly son Hamish (Leo Bill), and Tim Spall as the voice of a bloodbound called Bayard.

The artwork was stunning: in places ""Underland"" (apparently the six-year-old Alice slightly misheard the name) is incredibly beautiful, in other places it looks ruined and devastated for reasons which are soon revealed in the film but which I don't want to spoil the story by giving away.

These days the viewer is used to films with special effects of such a high quality that we tend to take them for granted, but the special effects were particularly brilliant in this film. The manner in which Alice is seen to grow to much above her normal size or shrink to be far smaller, the manner in which the Red Queen's soldiers look like playing cards while those of the White queen look like chess pieces, the ruined landscape of Underland, and particlarly the way the Cheshire Cat fades into and out of existence, all made impossible things look as real as you could hope for.

Overall I think this is the best Tim Burton film I have seen",1275782400,,4079,5.071641791044776
3639741,4,B001HN6940,"This movie was well done. It is not what the majority of people expected, but I believe that's because it seems every bad review I see is mainly centered on disappointment that this wasn't a re-run of the original. This is a Tim Burton film. It's just going to be ""different"". I believe that regardless of what ""Burton"" has his hands in, he is simply not going to do the ""Copy & Paste"" routine, and is definitely going to create something that is pretty much unthought of by anyone. Sometimes the outcome is good, and sometimes not so much. He did do a pretty good job on this. It's just, I always look back at ""Edward Scissor Hands"" and just imagined his material would just begin to get even more fascinating, but again, this is not always the case.

A lot of things that I thought would annoy me to death...they just didn't. The ""Queen"" was my main concern. Love the Actress (always have), but I thought they were just going to run that character in the ground and make it extremely stressful to view. They honestly did an excellent job with the editing etc... I just don't know how much better this film could have been pieced together by an editor.

I LOVE watching Johnny Depp act absolutely nuts, and so I thought his character was hilarious, because his character is deifintely nuts, but funny, all in the same. Depp has such an interesting sense of humor, and a seemingly very humble man behind the scenes.
I cannot remember if they explained the true meaning to what a ""Mad Hatter"" is or not. It is a name created because back in London (I believe) everyone used to wear these top hats. The way the people creating the hats were able to give a hat it's firmness was to take and feather ""Mercury"" on the hat (interior). Even a lot of people who simply wore the hats were going crazy because they would of course sweat, and they were constantly absorbing mercury into the scalp. This lead to the entire business creating these hats to go insane. A Doctor (whom I believe is still living) was determined that he find out what happened to these people. Well, he spilt Mercury on himself. He wound up in the sane asylum as well. He kept trying to explain to them that he wasn't crazy, and that something caused this. I think it took him somewhere around 10 years to prove that ""Mercury"" was the cause to all of this, and so he has spent the rest of his life teaching people about ""Metal Fillings"" (urging people to have them professionally removed) in their teeth, and they have to use Mercury in order for metal fillings to harden properly. Well, you can get a sensor put on that filling & it will read a scale of how much Vapor of Mercury is constantly being released and absorbed into the roof of the mouth, and into the blood stream. They stopped giving babies a certain vaccine some years back, which was 50% mercury by weight. They said as soon as they stopped giving that vaccine, ""Autism"" immediately dropped off by right around 50%. Anyway, I have Mercury poisoning, and I really was hoping they would have elaborated on the true meaning of what ""Mad As A Hatter"" truly means. It could have been a quick explanation, but it could have also destroyed this entire ""Imaginary World"", and so maybe it was best that I kept my thoughts out of thinking I could be someone to have the right to say that Tim Burton wrote this incorrectly. For what this films is, and was, and what it is supposed to mean....everything is Extremely opened, and so you just really have to do the ""Im just going to run & jump in the pool, because I know it's cold, and I'll just freeze more if I crawl into it"". Try not to have expectations that could destroy your ability to enjoy this film. Just jump in, and try to ""Appreciate"" some ""relief"" by not seeing something that just seems like the same old things we see day after day. I was happy to se something ""Wacky"". It eased my nerves quite a bit, and let me rest my mind away from the worlds other Legions of anxieties we have to deal with.

Last, but not least. This film was a bit ""all over the place"", but my brain tends to be all over the place. So, I guess this film just fits my awkward train of thought. I think anyone could at least enjoy giving this film a watch, but I definitely suggest to not expect a re-run of the original, because this is far from it. View it with an opened mind, and enjoy watching Depp, and 'Helena Bonham Carter' do what they do best. Act a little crazy, and make us laugh. I say, give it a try, but whom should trust my point of view completely is beyond me... :)",1275782400,3,4538,4.355371900826446

3639743,3,B001HN6940,"I wasn't terribly taken with this version of Alice In Wonderland.  While it was amazing as far as graphics go, the story was actually boggling.  I couldn't really understand what the point of the plot was.

Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is at a party when she sees a mysterious white rabbit.  After falling down a hole, she comes to wonderland.  But it is much changed from the wonderland we all know as our childhood.  She actually encounters the Tweedles fairly quickly as well as a few other characters who tell her her destiny is to slay the Jabberwocky.

A bit incredulous Alice is led to the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) and associates.  He sets down his life to save her from the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and tells her to seek out the White Queen (Anne Hathaway).  There she prepares for the ultimate battle against the Jabberwocky.

The characters in this movie, to me, were lukewarm at best.  While I always enjoy Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp, they played the only characters that I actually enjoyed in the movie.  Even Alice didn't hold the charm for me she should have.  The rest of the characters seemed minor and weren't really developed.  One other exception would be the Cheshire cat, I found him delightful.

While Burton's done some wonderful work, I just don't think this was up to his usual standard.  Even the music was only so-so any nothing that really made me go ""wow"".

The makeup and visuals in this film are outstanding however.  They are very crazy looking but don't look fake or not well done.  A lot of care was put in the costumes and it made it very realistic.  Even the Mad Hatter's hat played an integral roll in the movie.

Alice in Wonderland is not an easy story to make into a film. Basically it is a collection of weird encounters loosely strung together, lacking any real narrative thrust. Its success as a book lies entirely in Carroll's verbal wit and inventiveness, but such things do not translate easily to the big screen. Tim Burton has tried to counter this problem by devising a story line of his own: after 13 years Alice, running away from her engagement party, returns to Wonderland (or rather, as its inhabitants have it, Underland), where she is awaited as the one who will end the reign of the red queen. Themes from Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass and Jabberwocky are combined, with limited success it seems to me, to furnish this rather thin plot, that really doesn't bear stretching to the  nearly two hours that the film takes. The end, where Alice returns home, dumps her oaf of a fianc and starts out on a career as an international entrepreneur, feels tacked on and unconvincing.

The other remedy against lack of plot adopted by Burton is relentless visual spectacle. I don't think I've ever before seen a movie so utterly overdesigned. Three quarters in or so the eye becomes desperate for some repose, for just one scene that isn't burdened six layers deep with curly trees, wild skies, splashing waterfalls, scurrying fantasy-insects and colors to match. That is not to say that it isn't fascinating to watch; the design, Burton-style, is surreal and always interesting. It just is rather 'much of muchness'. You must also ask yourself if you want to get an image of the Jabberwock imprinted on your mind; in a lapse of inspiration Burton comes up with a rather conventional dragon, loosely based on Tenniel's illustration, although this one doesn't wear a waistcoat.

Here, a little more humour would have helped. In general, this wonderland is pretty humourless, deranged rather than funny. There is, nonetheless, some comic relief. In the shape of Matt Lucas's Tweedledum and Tweedledee, for instance. And you can trust Tim Burton to make the good white queen even more ludicrous than her hotheaded (and bigheaded) sister. There are sudden touches of viciousness too, such as a combative dormouse with a nasty penchant for putting out eyes. Johnny Depp does another Willy Wonka and is getting a bit tiresome.

Tim Burton remains an interesting director, but it seems that of late, despite all the panoply of CGI (or maybe because of it), he never quite reaches the heights of his earlier years, that brought us such brilliantly hilarious movies as Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks!, as well as the wonderful Nightmare before Christmas. Alice is definitely not in that league and while beautiful to watch, is surprisingly forgettable.",1275696000,11,2766,4.978354978354979

3639759,5,B001HN6940,"For this journey down the rabbit hole, Tim Burton is the driver and Johnny Depp the tour guide. Several film versions of Lewis Carroll's two ""Alice"" books have been released almost since the beginning of the 20th century. By and large, they have not been box office successes, though Walt Disney's 1951 animated feature has become perhaps the most iconic (I also like the 1933 Paramount film, the 1972 British musical film, the 1966 TV special of Through the Looking Glass, all on DVD, and the Hanna-Barbera 1966 special, which I wish was on DVD.)

Disney's new big screen version of Tim Burton's vision of Alice in Wonderland, or ""Underland,"" gives us Johnny Depp once again creating an original persona to our sheer amazement, This film is the first mega-hit movie version of Alice ever, hitting the 1 billion dollar mark worldwide. It's a testament to Johnny Depp's astronomical star power within the right vehicle. It has also been accomplished not only through Burton's artistry, but Linda Woolverton's screenwriting (she penned Disney's Beauty and the Beast, after all).

But they also had to change the story to make it work as a movie. Every filmmaker has struggled with the Carroll texts because, like dreams, they are random experiences with no arc. Walt Disney was the most successful, in my view, at staying faithful to the story without adding an arc (and Walt's artists' vision of the rabbit hole is still the best of all time).

What was done with the 2010 Alice in Wonderland was to make it a revisit, of sorts, with Alice at marrying age and at a crossroads in life. This is her second Wonderland visit, to bring her confidence and direction. It's probably the most re-defined and altered story arc of any Alice adaptation to date (in the excellent Hallmark TV miniseries, Alice is afraid to recite a poem and the Wonderland characters give her moral support).

Alice, in this version, is a bit like the Pevensie children in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe -- sent by a prophetic destiny to rid the kingdom of an oppressive, deadly leader. The characters are given names (which my son loves: ""It's not the White Rabbit, Daddy, he's McTwisp!""). Elements of the Carroll narrative (the rabbit hole, ""drink me,"" etc.) are still here, but eventually the new adventure takes hold and the film becomes an action fantasy.

By the time Alice, the Mad Hatter and the Dormouse reach the Queen's castle, they've become a team more in the style of L. Frank Baum than Carroll -- in fact, I expected Alice to tell the Hatter ""I'm going to miss you most of all."" She even says a line similar to ""and you were there, and you and you!"" But I digress and perhaps spoil.

But you know what? It works. And it's more akin to Disney tradition that it may seem at first, since Walt himself considered changing the Carroll story as well, and also almost made a live-action/animated version with Ginger Rogers. This film, with its blend of live actors, CG animation and motion capture, was virtually all performed in front of a green screen, a descendant of the live action/animated sequences in Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks.

The cast is marvelous, on screen and off. Mia Wasikowska suggests Hayley Mills, with a physical resemblance as well as a similar spunky yet sober attitude. Helena Bonham Carter is having a ball with a juicy, outrageous villain to chew on Red Queen. Anne Hathaway channels Snow White (watch those bent elbows) and Billie Burke as the White Queen. The voices of Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, Michael Sheen as the White Ra-- oops, I mean McTwisp are among the letter-perfect voice casting. And of course, there's to Johnny Depp's masterful, mercurial ""Bozo-Blows-His-Big-Top,"" yet somehow heartbreakingly sympathetic, Hatter.

One note to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang fans: the legendary Barbara Windsor, who voices the swashbuckling Dormouse, was the blonde girl friend of Arthur Millard, the big goofball who got the ugly haircut from Dick Van Dyke's machine in the Sherman Brothers 1968 musical classic. And that's just a small part of a very big stage and screen career. It's nice to hear her in this film.

The film is visually amazing and as good a reason as any to plunk down the cash for a Blu-Ray player. The DVD has a handful of the bonus features included on the Blu-Ray disc, but I sure would have loved to hear an audio commentary from someone about such an interesting film.

Can't wait for the sequel -- how can there NOT be? I've always loved Alice in Wonderland and am glad to see it possibly become a franchise, as well as ""cool"" again. This is one instance where today's filmmakers have realized that total fantasy and escapism is what audiences want during depressed times.

And it still compliments the Walt Disney version without replacing it. There's always room for another Wonderland, and the Walt Disney version will always be landmark, especially because of its Mary Blair look, classic voice cast and unforgettable songs.",1275609600,13,4980,4.819672131147541

It had all the potential to be a great version of this wonderful movie, but instead it becomes very tiring. It is just a collection of Burton's past accomplishments wrapped up in the dressing of a classic. It just has many of the same old tired tricks that go no where quick.

With worlds of the outlandish and incredible heartfilled characters there was no doubt that Disney would call upon him for bringing one of the most beloved childrens tales to life, in Alice In Wonderland.

Now, in order to truly appreciate this film you need to know your Alice 101. If you have never read the two Alice books (yes not many people know there were two books) Or if you haven't seen the 1953 Disney animated film, chances are this will not be the best experience for you. What makes this film so great is that Tim Burton wanted to give his audience something fresh, so he made his very own unoffical 3rd Installment. This Alice In Wonderland is sort of what Stephen Speilberg's Hook did for Peter Pan. In Tim Burtons' fims whether good or bad his cast is always great (most of the time because it's the same). The best performances here have come from Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter. Cater filling in the shoes and head of the Red Queen gives you a true 'you love to hate me' character. Johnny Depp turns on his Jack Sparrow/Willy Wonka charm, but kicks it up one huge knotch. The only beef I had with this movie I think the CGI was a tad overdone. Sure we have come to an age where the CGI is king. Still, you compare it to so many of the Burton films before, the lack of CGI just made them all the more whimsical. Still, the movie is entertaing and so much fun to watch. I would say proceed with caution if you haven't caught up on the story in a while.

I had doubts when ""Pocahontas"" was released in 1995.  Turned out to be a great film.

This film is good NOT GREAT.  I have never read the Lewis Carroll book, just know the 1951 film.

Of course, we do NOT have songs in this 1.  You can always listen to the songs in the 1951 film.

Depp, he has done this type of role before, so this was no stretch for him.  Carter, Burton's girlfriend so that is how she keeps getting these parts in his film, good as the Red Queen.  The big head bit....with special effects the way the are today this effect should have been done better.  Hathaway needs Disney to get hit films.  OK job as the White Queen with no screen time till 2cd half of film.

Tweedle Dee & Tweedle Dum were a let down compared to the 1951 film.  All the animated characters NOT even close to the classic film.

The ending was bit of a let down.

NOW, I find myself having to say this with recent Disney DVD releases.
A line on the back of this DVD case describing the film ""The extraordinary characters you've loved come to life richer and MORE COLORFUL THAN EVER"".  OK, Disney, if you are prompting how the film looks then why are you guys resorting to PLAIN SILVER DVD' LIKE WHEN DVD'S CAME OUT IN THE LATE 1990'S?

I say let's look at the new version with new eyes. I thought it was brilliant to make it Alice's second trip down the rabbit hole, thus allowing an entirely new story - one where Alice is more grown up, and thus not as non-sensey (yeah, yeah, not a word, but I like it) because she is no longer a child.

This begins off so well and then after about 30 minutes gets boringer and boringer. I had such great hopes at the start and soon gave them up when I saw how badly the script had messed with Carroll's original vision. That story and its magic wordplay is what made AIW great, not just the characters.

Making this Alice's second visit down the hole is pointless and ends up killing the momentum. Carter steals the show and is the film's highlight, Depp is merely there as the Hatter, and Mia is, sorry to say, a very unexciting Alice. Is that really the best casting they could do? She just isn't much fun to watch here; we need an Alice of great verve and zing! Carroll's Alice is much sassier and just a lot more interesting, all told.

But it's hard not to like the wonderful colors and fine sets, though the CGI gets old after about an hour. Nonetheless, the many fine visions make up for some of the meandering plot, if not nearly enough.

Dang it, Tim: why mess with perfection? You could have stuck to the first and best story and made a real classic, but instead you used an unappealing older girl who leaches the fun out of everything, and a story that can't begin to compare with the faultless whimsy of the original.

3639776,4,B001HN6940,"ALICE IN WONDERLAND  is a merry mixed bag of a film.  The criticisms range from adulation to condemnation and that usually identifies an artwork worth visiting.  No, this is not Lewis Carroll's wondrous book intact: it s a variation on a theme of that book and there are so many aspects of the original here that those whose childhoods (and adulthoods) captured so much of the wild imagination and hilarious dialogue of this ma group of otherland creations that the film will at least connect on many levels to everyone.  One suspects that with the manner in which the movie begins (a haughty 'engagement announcement' party at which the now 19 year old Alice Kingsleigh is set up to become betrothed to a dullard geek and runs from the gazebo setting out of dismay) is the reason for the restoration of individualism in the Alice that returns from slide down the rabbit hole return to Wonderland.  Linda Woolverton's screenplay is creaky at times, but wisely keeps enough of the fantasy alive before drowning it in an ending that is perilously close to gluttonous CGI mess.

The flavor is pure Tim Burton and his style fits this adaptation well.  To justify the return of the elder Alice to the world at the end of the rabbit hole Burton has to have a driver: Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is needed to evict the evil Red Queen (Helen Bonham Carter so that the good White Queen (a miscast Anne Hathaway) can restore calm and order to Underland.  Many of Carroll's characters are used as CGI creations - Tweedledum/Tweedledee (voice of Matt Lucas), Cheshire Cat (voice of Stephen Fry), the White Rabbit (voice of Michael Sheen), the Blue Caterpillar (a wonderful voice character for Alan Rickman), the talking Flowers (voice of Imelda Staunton), and the hound dog Bayard (voice of Timothy Spall), etc.  The Mad Hatter is well captured by Johnny Depp and some genuine realism is added via the transformative presence of Marton Csokas as the young Alice's now departed father Charles Kingsleigh.

Where the movie gets off track is the final battle with the monsters that protect the Red Queen.  It just gets expensively silly here and certainly not a film for young children: the violence is disturbing.  But there is enough to like in this DVD version - even without the advantage (I suppose there was one) of theatrical 3D.  And as Alice keeps reminding everyone, 'This is MY dream.'

I've been a big fan of Burtons movies since ""way back in the day"" and was hoping the critics were wrong. I have to admit that I was disappointed with the movie and almost fell asleep a few times during it. I won't go too much into the story as the other reviews have already done that - this is a review for the BLU-RAY.

MOVIE: While I wasn't a big fan of it, it certainly wasn't terrible (just a little slow at times!) - 3.5 / 5
VIDEO: Absolutely incredible (and since most of it was CG, that's expected -- it still impressed me very much, and I'm someone who has been a HDDVD/Blu-Ray owner since the initial releases of each): 5/5
AUDIO: Also very strong - I didn't notice any issues with it. 5/5
EXTRAS: Now here's where it gets tough. The extras are great! Only problem is that they're so SHORT - 2-3 minutes a piece - there might be 45 minutes worth on the disc (divided into 12 features). These could have been fantastic if made into much longer extras. Sometimes they were better than the movie but came to an end so quickly. Not even a commentary! - 2.5/5

I have a feeling we'll be seeing another Alice blu-ray in the near future (probably in 3D and with much more features).

The 3-disc combo pack is nice - a Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital Copy (great for an iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch).

It was an interesting story, and not at all the rip off of BBC's Alice that I expected it to be. The writing was adequate as was the camera work...sort of.

Alice (Mia Wasikowska) does a great job considering what she had to work with. And by ""what she had to work with"" I mean Johnny Depp. Not that Depp isn't a good actor, he is. And not that Depp doesn't play some weirdos, he does. The problem with Depp's character is his appearance--which is so over the top that the only thing I could think of when he was on screen was ""oh my gawd, Willy Wonka exploded and then Walt Disney threw up on him.""-- was almost painful to watch. Really, it's so bad it's distracting.

The Hooka smoking bug was interesting, even well done I suppose. And considering Carrol's original has all of the aspects of an LSD induced trip I suppose this caterpillar was in keeping with the doped up spirit of the book.

I was a little disappointed that the door-mouse didn't tell Alice to ""feed her head,"" but that's a minor thing as well.

The biggest problem I had with the movie wasn't in the writing at all. even if you can get forgive the Johnny Depp--Mad Hatter psychedelic demon thing in the movie I don't know how anyone can forgive Hollywood for taking Ann Hathaway--who is one of the best looking women in the movies not to mention a great actress--and making her look like some sort of Frankenstein/post operative transvestite hybrid who wanders around looking like the lobotomy has been successful. Such a hideous transformation of this great actress is  something that clearly cannot be forgiven, ever.

3639783,4,B001HN6940,"I saw ALICE in 3D in an IMAX theatre. This being said, viewers can expect a mildly odd family entertainment, best made memorable by a lackluster performance from Johnny Depp. Once again, Depp dons his generic British accent that while believable, is unvaried from his other Brit roles- of which he's had a few. I feel comfortable being critical of the genius that Depp most certainly is- now that he's made enough money to retire 20 times over. He's going to have to work very hard indeed to top his previous Burton collaborations. Hopefully we will all forget Willy Wonka from the formidable list of triumphs.

Unlike the wonderland of AVATAR, Burton's Wonderland seems somewhat unfinished, as if there were insufficient time or monies to satisfy his vision. Burton's Wonderland is not only bleak, but lacking in detail and imagination.

All of this is relatively unimportant. ALICE is in its own way a respectable work of art which, for a Hollywood blockbuster, was no easy credential. Clearly, Burton knows the ins and outs of working Tinseltown. Few art films in history and fewer film makers have commanded this kind of strong-legged boxoffice.

In spite of a nice 3D eyefest made nicer indeed by the IMAX format, this ALICE is neither ""trippy"", profound, or for that matter, truly entertaining. But hey, I own stock in both Disney and IMAX so I know the smell of big bucks when I get a whiff.

Ultimately, I've passed on owning this DVD. The film is simply not memorable enough to hold up to, or command repeat viewings (unless one is chemically enhanced to grok anything with groooovy images). And I am the kind of guy who collects Disney animation. I find it ironic indeed that Tim Burton, who came into his own by rejecting the Mouse Factory, has won a hit for himself at Disney. There- I guess Disney has been well compensated for providing Tim's apprenticeship.

I found ALICE to be an engaging, but ultimately unsatisfying addition to Burton's Filmography. I have no doubt that Burton himself is dissapointed with this WONDERLAND. Nevertheless, ALICE IN WONDERLAND accomplished what it set out to do, namely, make a lot of money for all parties involved.",1275350400,2,2166,4.8432432432432435
3639794,4,B001HN6940,"I've written a review of the film elsewhere -- it should be under the DVD reviews, dated in early March.

As for the Blu-ray... It's an improvement over the theatrical 3D version, as there are no glasses to dim the image, or cause a slight color shift. It is a beautiful film that takes full advantage of CGI and digital grading to create a plausible fantasy world. (Bayard the hound is particularly remarkable.) The transfer is gorgeous.

My feelings about the film itself have not changed. Carroll's story is impossible to film in any way that's consistent with what we commonly expect from a motion picture. It's little more than a sequence of disconnected events, with no particular dramatic arc. This adaptation might not be ideal, but it's better than most -- there's a coherent storyline, and the overall approach is adult and on the dark side, as you would expect from a Tim Burton film. It is an acceptable and generally entertaining adaptation, which is why I've given it 4 stars. As other people will likely weight the film's strengths and weakness differently, their opinions will differ.

One of the best things about the original story is that Alice has always been a plucky, argumentative character who's not easily intimidated -- so there's never been a need to redefine her in ""feminist"" terms. She only has to recover a bit of her ""muchness"" to face the Jabberwock -- Which, for some unknown reason, is referred to as the ""Jabberwocky"". How can Linda Wolverton /not/ have known the latter is the title of the poem -- not the monster?

Lewis Carroll would probably have been less bothered by the changes to the story than by the more-explicit violence. (The original has a lot of nasty behavior and implied violence.) However, as a mathematician, he would undoubtedly been fascinated by our ability to model things as numbers, and manipulate them as desired.

PS: The Mad Hatter's recitation of ""Jabberwocky"" has several significant errors. Why weren't they caught?",1275350400,,1982,4.886904761904762

3639796,3,B001HN6940,"Don't be fooled.  Tim Burton's version of ""Alice in Wonderland"" is not another film version of the Lewis Carol classic, rather it's more of a sequel.  The premise is that on the day she's proposed to by a upper class nitwit, Alice runs off and falls back down the rabbit hole and returns to Wonderland.  Unlike her first trip to Wonderland in which all the weird creatures treated Alice quite cruelly, Alice is now a hero of sorts because she's the only one who can defeat the evil Red Queen.

Unfortunately that pretty much sums up the entire movie.  This isn't as artistic statement as much it is a high concept re-imagining.  I am sure the thinking behind this movie was something along the lines of, ""Tim Burton directing 'Alice in Wonderland' with Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter.  Who cares if it's any good as long as the ticket's sell.""  Yep, this movie is pretty much mass marketing, and if you think I'm exaggerating, Hot Topic was selling merchandise for this movie four months before it's release (Nov. 09).  This is not a terrible movie by any means, but it's not a great one either.  I did enjoy some of the performances, especially the manic March Hare.  Visually, the movie is quite impressive.  Just too bad it doesn't have a stronger narrative.

After he screwed up CHOCOLATE FACTORY I shouldn't have been surprised, but wow.  This was bad.  Awful script with zero character development, it made absolutely no sense (which would be fine if they stuck with the original nonsensical premise, but they TRIED to have it make sense!), and Johnny Depp (who I usually love) was just way too far out this time around.  Short of a great performance by Helena Bonham-Carter, this was nothing but an impressive visual 120 minutes.  That's not enough for me.  Some people can sit and just watch CGI for hours and think it's brilliant.  Personally, I'd like a well-told story and fully-formed characters.  This had neither.

3639799,2,B001HN6940,"You have to hand to Disney; they really are treating this Blu-ray release like a million bucks. I actually got excited for this release again, that is until I remembered I didn't really like the movie. I thought it was an ugly, blurry mess because of the 3D but after watching the Blu-ray last night, no, it's just an ugly drab mess - period.  I don't understand how Tim Burton got the cinematography so wrong on this. I said in my original review that Tim Burton was born to make this movie - 10 films ago, now it just feels like I've seen it all a million times before with more passion from the director.

Picture/Presentation

I really expected to love the Blu-ray experience, I mean I officially hate most 3D films so I thought watching this in the crispness of HD would enhance the experience and it doesn't. It's one of the worst looking films I've ever seen on ye old Blu-ray.  The transfer is fine, but I don't think there's any amount of sharpness you can add that makes up for the dreariness of the production quality.  Audio sounds great, but a boring soundtrack doesn't help matters.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and French. This comes in Disney's standard 3 Disc packaging (Blu-ray, DVD, and Digital Copy) with a slip case. I like the cover art, but there's nothing that stands out.  Menu navigation is easy, clean and straightforward to use.

Extras

Disney does add one unique unadvertised extra and that's something called a Descriptive Audio Track. It's very cool; it's some woman that's describing everything that's happening on the screen. It's as though you are listening to an audio book. I hope all future Disney productions include this; it adds a whole new dimension to the viewing experience.

Other than this new feature, the rest of the extras are an extensive set of featurettes that show you how the production was put together and cast interviews. Warner has Maximum Movie Mode and Universal has U-Control, Fox we just won't mention them - we're lucky if they give us one 4 minute featurette, Disney really needs to come up with their version of Picture N. Picture. They generally do everything else right, but skimp on this one feature.

Comments

I wish I could rave about this disc, I always love and appreciate a great PR Campaign, and Disney Home Video rarely disappoints but this package sucks, not because of anything on this set, but because the movie is barely watchable (I turned it off 20 minutes into it) and no amount of shine is going to fix this simple fact. Wonderland should be this amazing, vibrant looking place - even if it's under control of evil, there should be a sense of awe to the visuals instead everything just lays there looking dead and fake. There's no life to anything on screen - even the actors. You should skip this movie altogether, it's not worthy of a rental that alone a purchase.",1275350400,2,2857,4.646825396825397
3639800,1,B001HN6940,"""Alice"" fails in so many ways, not the least of which is Burton's uncreative reliance on computer-generated EVERYTHING. Beyond that, the character development is shoddy as hell and the whole thing just feels like a poor attempt at using names and star-status to get people to see it.

Sure, Jonny Depp is great as always and Helena Bonham-Carter is funny, but as a story, it left me feeling very unfulfilled.

You might as well go see another frikkin' ""Shrek"" movie, 'cuz this is just as soulless, but particularly disappointing because this man made ""Beetlejuice.""

Where did Tim Burton's ability to truly haunt us with his visionary skills go?

Check out ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" instead. It may not rape your eyeballs like ""Avatar,"" but it's definitely more grounded in a tangible fantasy world, one that speaks to something deeper than candy.",1275264000,21,859,5.028169014084507
3639801,1,B001HN6940,"Who were they trying to appeal to with this cheesy, um, rendition(?) of ""Alice in Wonderland""? My best guess is eight year old tom-boys. Far and away Tim Burton's worst movie. Why does this need to be an action film? It's not like it's even thrilling or magical either. Mia Wasikowska is horrible as Alice; she has but ONE facial expression through the entire film: slightly peeved. Helena Bonham Carter is OK at best with a small role and Anne Hathaway is completely wasted. Johnny Depp is playing insane just because that's all he does now and it's totally dull. In fact, the entire picture is dull The ""wonderful"" images are bland and lifeless. Visually it's a poor mans ""Avatar"". ""Alice in Wonderland"" is by far one of the worst movies of 2010; completely misguided, boring, unfunny and worst of all uninspired.

Who said we wanted ""Alice in Wonderland"" to be a lame combination of the two books, an action film, a feminist piece and have the Mad Hatter AND Alice break dance in the climax? I certainly did not.

3639803,3,B001HN6940,"Tim Burton is a master of visuals; usually, he's a master storyteller, too.  And you'd think he would be the perfect fit to bring Lewis Carroll's psychedelic little novel to life.  And, if Burton and company had stuck to the novels, perhaps they would have a great film on their hands.  Alas, this film takes place AFTER Alice's initial visit to Wonderland.  Instead of the prepubescent charmer (borderline nymph) that inspired Carroll to tell his tale, we get a decidedly more mature Alice (no subtlety here).  She's come back to Wonderland, except the Mad Hatter (a minor character in the novels, a major player here) is the only one who's really sure.  But the Red Queen doesn't care if Alice is or isn't THE Alice.  Off with her head anyways!

True, the visuals are amazing; I only saw it in 2D, and I was blown away.  But the rest of the film falls amazingly flat.  Even Johnny Depp, perhaps the most talented actor of his generation, doesn't seem to know what to do--to make the Hatter whimsical or serious?  (And what's with the break dancing?)  Mia Wasikowska proves she's got talent, but she doesn't have much to do here in the titular role.  We get some decent voice acting from Michael Sheen, and some genuinely fantastic voice acting from Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat (his performance alone, small as it is, is worth the ticket price).  Christopher Lee has one line (no kidding: one), and Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter, both amazingly talented actresses, are stuck in a rut here, never able to break free of their confines.  Crispin Glover, good as he usually is, just doesn't come off as too villainous; and Alan Rickman, as the Blue Caterpillar, is merely here for show; he's better than this and he knows it.

Overall, ALICE IN WONDERLAND serves as a decent family film--kids won't care that the performances and stories lag, and parents will probably be enthralled with the visuals.  But for those of us craving a decent take on the book--well, there's always the old cartoon, still one of my personal faves.

Just another ""ooh, look at how liberated this girl is"" kind of movie. But still I enjoyed it. Why, well not the story which is pretty stupid. You can read other summaries here so I won't repeat them.

What I really liked were the actors. This Mia Wasikowska girl is beautiful and quite cute in this film. I hope she does more movies. Johnny Depp isn't allowed to monopolize the screen (think of every Jim Carrey fiasco) and turn it into a film all about himself and so he is a great addition here and he does a good Mad Hatter. He recites the Jabberwocky poem. I loved it. Very, very well done.

Helena Bonham Carter (christ was a long name) is very good. Actually her arrogant malevolence is right on and was probably patterned after real life female politicians like Hilary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi. Pretty scary.

There are no Negroes in this entire movie. How excellent to see a film which doesn't succumb to the 'we need to put a Negro in the movie regardless' template.

3639829,5,B001HN6940,"I'm afraid many people have entirely missed the point of this film, mostly because they expected it to be a re-creation of the original Lewis Carol classic. Instead, Burton ""re-imagined"" the original film, not only through having Alice return to Wonderland (now called Underland) as a young adult, but by seeing in it a rich allegory of the journey into psychological adulthood.

Like most young adults, Alice begins the story confused and un-self-knowing, vulnerable to the pressures of the largely unhealthy adults around her, and in the process of being forced into a dismal marriage to a wealthy, aristocratic dolt who has no conception of who she is as a person, only as an ornament. In the course of her ordeals in Underworld--akin to a shamanic journey--she finds her true self, becomes confident in who she is and who she isn't, and returns to surface life (much of which is truly ""surface,"" in the sense of superficial) able to speak her truth to power and reject what doesn't fit for her. It might be seen as a feminist tale in the best sense of the word: not rejecting of the Masculine (indeed, her mentor later in the film is a healthy older man), but honoring the Feminine, and insisting on a place in the world for healthy femininity! The actress in the role of Alice does an amazing job with the subtle challenge of portraying psychological health and balance.

Given all this, it is clearly not a film for children, even tho there are some cute and cuddly creatures in it, and it has some cartoon-like qualities. There are also some truly fearsome creatures and traumatic scenes that can be challenging even for adults! And, as I have elaborated, the essence of this film is available only to those with enough life experience to appreciate it.

Other issues with the movie: It tried to hard to be Narnia and Lord of the Rings Jr. A lot of people complained that it didn't make any sense, but I say it made too much sense. Read the books, there is barely a cohesive narritive outside of little girl in strange world looking for a rabbit. It was way too predictable. You can call the whole ending by around the ten minute mark. I wanted to like this movie, I really did, but I think this fails on the same level as Tim Burtons version of Willy Wonka.

The actors were all good, especially Mia, but without the lunacy they seemed to have little to do. The closest film I can think of in recent times which was like Alice, but not an straight adaptation (like this film was attempting to be) was Labyrinth, with its illogical puzzles/wordplay and endearing characters.

Not one I feel the urge to buy straight away. Get one of the straight Alice adaptations which have graced the TV instead.",1274918400,8,696,4.704918032786885

3639847,3,B001HN6940,"I'm a big fan of Tim Burton's work, but I have to say that ultimately this one is a disappointment.

I'd gathered from the previews that this was intended as a sequel to the original books. I didn't have a problem with that, and as far as the eye-candy aspect of this movie is concerned, it ranges from amazing to literally stunning.

Which is what you'd expect from a Tim Burton film. But Lewis Carroll is a hard act to follow, and the story just isn't up to the challenge. Although it starts off well enough, with Alice now grown up and on the verge of being forced into an arranged marriage to someone who's definitely not her type, the story quickly squanders the charm of the original story's characters, degenerating into yet another ""Quest for the Magic Thingummy"" (in this case, the Vorpal Sword from Carroll's classic nonsense poem ""Jabberwocky"", which is the only weapon that can slay the fearsome Jabberwock and free Wonderland from yada yada yada).

To cap this mess off, when Alice completes the quest and returns to the ""real"" world, the ending is more unrealistic (for the late 19th Century) than anything you're liable to come across in Wonderland. I'm sure the scriptwriter felt it would be ""empowering"", but ... no way, no how. And I really have to wonder what bad thing Depp did to make them write that awkward and humiliating dance bit into the end.

I'm sure kids will find this entertaining (and a bit scary at times). The visual effects should make it at least bearable for any adult viewer. But I can't give this movie more than three stars, because it fell so far from what it could have been.",1274832000,4,1618,4.568965517241379
3639848,2,B001HN6940,"There's a lot of criticism focusing around Tim Burton at the moment and it's spiked at the release of this film. The major criticisms directed at Burton focus on his lack of any original ideas and the re-casting of the same actors in every film he makes. Johnny Depp is a great actor; I don't think anybody would deny this, but to cast him in almost every movie made by Burton is just insane and has become repetitive to the point it runs the possibility of damaging his career and casting a negative shadow over the serious roles he has played in the past and may play in the future. Anyway, back to the film...

19 year old Alice Kingsleigh is a girl in a difficult situation. Haunted by weird dreams and still mourning the loss of her father, Alice is faced with the decision of deciding whether to marry a man she cannot foresee a life with, despite her family's wishes to marry the man in question. Events lead her to find herself falling down a hole, landing her in a place called Underland which is filled with a number of strange people and creatures and turns her perception of her own life upside down. Greeted by Doremouse, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and the white rabbit, she is told that she is the right Alice and that it is her destiny to fight the Red Queen's Jabberwocky on Frabjous day to restore the White Queen to power.

That is the general gist of the movie plot, but naturally, the story includes the legendary Mad Hatter (Depp) and other wondrous creatures which are lead by a truly brilliant cast. The main cast, both voicing and live action consist of Hatter (Depp), Red Queen (Helena Bonham-Carter), Absolem (Alan Rickman), Tweedledum & Dee (Matt Lucas), White Queen (Anne Hathaway), Nivens McTwisp (Michael Sheen) to name but a few. I would say that the cast are the real saviours of this film as without them, this would have been a bland attempt at re-inventing the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland story.

I like Burton's work, I really do. Beetlejuice is up there as one of my all time favourites and Edward Scissorhands isn't far behind. But these were new and fresh ideas created solely from the mind of a genius; but his most recent works have simply been gothic reinventions of classic novels or movies we have all heard of at some point. This is where Burton fails in my head as, although I find his style of film making interesting and visually, the films become quite intriguing, it's all the same just with a different plot. It has come to a point where you can safely say to people that when you've seen one Burton movie, you've seen them all. When considering his works over the past decade, that couldn't be more true.

That aside, I liked this film. It was a simple and easy way to kill a few hours and I have to admit that it was kind of interesting to see Burton's twist on this classic tale, so it's sort of understandable to see exactly why he still manages to release financially successful movies. I would recommend this if you already have the curiosity to see this, or if you have some time to kill; otherwise, if I were you, I just wouldn't bother.",1274832000,6,3101,4.502664298401421
3639849,2,B001HN6940,"This film is a difficult one to review.  Those who have never read ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There"" might be able to enjoy the film from an unbiased perspective, but those of us who have read Lewis Carroll's classics a number of times find it harder to appreciate.  First off the film tries to combine both books, which is the norm when adapting the books to film.  It of course was done in the 1951 Disney classic Alice in Wonderland.  The title ""Alice in Wonderland"" is often one used when combining both original Carroll books.  I don't see any harm in that.  In fact, the 1951 animated movie did it exceptionally well because it continued to stay true to other aspects of the stories.  The 2010 version fails to do this.

The story completely changes in the 2010 movie.  We can forget about the fact that Burton made the story dark and scary instead of light and whimsical, as it was intended originally.  We all expected that...he's Tim Burton.  But characters are combined and new ones are created that make no sense.  For example: the movie contains the characters the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) and the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter), when in fact Carter is playing the roll of the Queen of Hearts.  The Queen of Hearts is a character from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, while the Red and White Queens are characters from Through the Looking Glass and What Alice Found There.  They are also chess pieces...not people.

Tim Burton takes characters from the books and destroys them.  I understand that Burton wants to ""go his own way"" with the story, and that the characters are supposed to be a little changed because it takes place a few years after Alice's original trip to Wonderland, but this film doesn't make sense.  The only positive thing I have to say is that Mia Wasikowska made a wonderful Alice, but you would never know that since the films marketed as ""OH MY GOD IT'S JOHNNY DEPP."" It's not supposed to be about the Mad Hatter, but it is, and again, it's expected.

Also, the plot is very weak.  Alice goes from inquisitive and innocent one minute to slaying the JABBERWOCK the next.  That's right..it's the Jabberwock NOT the Jabberwocky!!  ""Jabberwocky"" is the name of the poem in which the Jabberwock is introduced.  And not once was the word ""nonsense"" mentioned.  Which is a purely disgraceful since Carroll invented his own genre of ""nonsense literature"" for children.  This could have been a wonderful film, but instead it was ruined by Burton's love of turning childhood classics into horrible nightmares.  Also Burton's ultra-crush on Johnny Depp is overshadowing what a wonderful young actress Mia Wasikowska is and how it's called ALICE in Wonderland.",1274572800,8,2750,4.8
3639850,4,B001HN6940,"Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland starts off like sense and sensibility with a bunch of stuffy British elite playing match maker with Alice. The humor at first is subtle. Alice is proposed to by an oafish snob, she then excuses herself to think over a decision. During that time she runs off into the woods and falls down a hole. She is then transported into wonderland.  She meets all her old snarky friends that seem to have a bad attitude at first. I was thinking that her friends would turn on her but they stayed loyal to Alice throughout the movie. Throughout the movie all of the characters had  snarky one-liners and whimsical attitudes that gave the movie depth and vitality. The entire movie felt like a journey very similar to the Disney cartoon Alice in Wonderland and Return to Oz. There wasn't anything original in this movie. Tim Burton borrowed from the classics and created his own version. And I think he did a good job at it. The movie lost a little steam towards the end. Alice has a one on one predictable battle with a serpentine dragon. Christopher Lee provided the voice for the dragon and spoke half a line which was very disappointing. A legend like Christopher Lee deserves more than that. Then the giant battle sequence lasted for about 2 minutes before the dragon was beheaded. So don't expect a 30 minute epic battle like that in Lord of the Rings. Soon after that the obnoxious red queen was exiled out of the wonderland.

The majority of the time I couldn't understand what Johnny Depp was saying. His dialogue was muffled and riddled with obfuscation. Aside from prancing across a dinner table and helping Alice fly across a lake, he came out in three comical scenes. The first is when he was to be beheaded and he vanished into thin air to later be seen hiding behind the red queen's throne. The second scene is when Johnny Depp created an array of hats for the Queen's giant head, and third Johnny Depp did a silly and abrupt Michael Jackson-esque dance towards the end of the movie. Sadly, this movie ended abruptly and it could have used a few more plots and a better script. At times a few of the actors seemed bored with the uninspired script. The best characters were the caterpillar and the super-friendly Cheshire cat. Both characters had the best one-liners and the best special effects. The cinematography and special effects were colorful and brilliant throughout each scene. And the acting was mostly well-done despite issues with an uninspired script. Don't expect anything original because this movie is a blend of the Alice in wonderland cartoon and Return to Oz.",1274572800,4,2611,4.6965065502183405

Johnny Depp played the Mad Hatter excellently, i can't fault him there. The director Tim Burton who as far as i know also made Edward Scissorhands made huge money from this as it was one of the biggest grossing movies, he is also known for making slightly odd movies.  So it's obviously popular and well liked just not my cup of tea. I do however agree that it should have been called Return to Wonderland as to not give the impression that it's a remake of the original Alice in Wonderland.

3639854,5,B001HN6940,"Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and ALICE IN WONDERLAND certainly have NOT lost their muchness.  In fact, they are full of it!  I have to admit, I went into ALICE IN WONDERLAND expecting the worst.  I had heard some terrible things from friends who had already seen it, and the trailers didn't give me much hope, either.  But since I frequently believe in six impossible things before breakfast, I decided to try ALICE IN WONDERLAND for myself. And I am so glad that I did.  ALICE IN WONDERLAND is an incredible mash up of Lewis Carroll's two Alice books - ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There.""

Let's face it.  Tim Burton is a very odd director, and the original Alice books are quite odd themselves.  Put the two together and you get amazing brilliance.  Remember, Disney's animated Alice in Wonderland is not very true to the source material; rather it is, well, a Disneyfied version of a small part of Lewis Carroll's original works.  Carroll accomplished quite a feat with the Alice books:  he wrote a fanciful story that really appealed to children, and combined it with a strong satire very relevant to the political world of the time.  And perhaps the most astonishing thing of all is that his works continue to be so well known.  Many, many words and phrases from the Alice stories have become part of our lexicon and are still in use, even today.

But, back to this film rendition of ALICE IN WONDERLAND.  This ALICE IN WONDERLAND opens with Alice, age 19, about to get engaged.  She doesn't really want to, but it is what is expected of her.  We realized that Alice is an unusual girl:  she has a mind of her own, modern ideas, and she has been plagued by mysterious dreams all her life.  Alice is dreading her engagement (she doesn't even particularly like the young man), when suddenly she is distracted by a rabbit...in a waistcoat, no less!  Of course, she follows him, avoids her own proposal, and falls down a rabbit hole.  Once she lands, a long, long way down, there are many of the expected Alice experiences from the original book, ending with Alice eventually being the right size to enter Wonderland.  Once she is there, people keep asking if she is THE Alice, the REAL Alice, and Alice slowly begins to understand that her dreams...her nightmares...have perhaps, maybe, been memories.  But is she the real Alice?  Is she the champion?  And can she save Wonderland from the Red Queen?

Tim Burton works his usual brand of extraordinary magic bringing Wonderland to life.  The sets and effects in ALICE IN WONDERLAND are outstanding - dark, colorful, and wonderfully weird.  The bandersnach, the jubjub bird, and the jabberwock look very similar to the original illustrations and exactly as I have pictured them in my head all these years.  Dee and Dum are definitely Tweedly.  And the beamish vorpal sword does indeed go snicker-snack on the Frabjous day.  The Rev. Dodgson would have been amazed and proud at seeing his imagination brought to life so vividly.  The acting and voice talent are incredible, including the incomparable Johnny Depp as the appropriately mad Hatter, Stephen Fry as the voice of a delicious Cheshire cat, Severus Snape, uh, I mean Alan Rickman as the voice of the hookah-smoking Blue Caterpillar, Mia Wasikowska as a near perfect Alice, Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway as ideal opposite foils portraying the Red and White Queens respectively, Christopher Lee as the terrible Jabberwock, and a veritable host of others.  The cast assembled for ALICE IN WONDERLAND is what makes this film click, and all put in amazing performances.

I can certainly see that ALICE IN WONDERLAND is not for everyone.  It is a very odd and strange film, but, in my humble opinion, in a good way.  And in a way that is true to Lewis Carroll's original writings.  If you like the bizarre and unusual, if you think you CAN believe in six impossible things before breakfast, then this ALICE IN WONDERLAND is definitely for you.  My husband and I really loved it, when we had not expected to.  It really surprised us.  And that is what defines ALICE IN WONDERLAND as a truly great film.",1273881600,2,4168,4.750696378830083
3639855,5,B001HN6940,"Tumble down the rabbit hole with Alice for a fantastical new adventure thanks to Tim Burton. This is an imaginative new twist on the Lewis Carroll classic in which Alice, now 19 years old, returns to the whimsical world she first entered as a child and embarks on a journey to discover her true destiny. This is a Wonderland unlike anything you've seen before, with characters more colorful than ever, from Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter to Helena Bonham Carter`s Red Queen to Michael Sheen's White Rabbit. This is a Disney flick, but it's like some drug-induced dream that will feed your mind and your soul. Those who want a less flamboyant and less colorful (as in black-and-white) experience can opt for the 1933 live-action gem starring W.C. Fields and Cary Grant. A word of warning: Universal Home Video hurriedly released this flick to cash in on Burton's Alice adventure; this is the edited 77-minute version, not the complete 90-minute version, Still, W.C. as Humpty Dumpty and Cary as the Mock Turtle are (almost) worth the trimming.",1273708800,5,1036,4.892045454545454

3639878,1,B001HN6940,"Saturday afternoon - Matinee showing of Alice in Wonderland.  I had seen the 1951 Disney production of the same name, and I had some hopeful expectation that, now, in 2010, we might enjoy that light and humorous story again, but with updated animation, sophistication, and more contemporary cultural sensibilities.  After a week of long and demanding hours at work, I was enjoying a sunny Spring afternoon in town, and I had decided to amuse myself by going, as I used to do in quieter and more innocent days, many years ago, to a Saturday matine, with all of my accustomed associations of inspiring adventure.

I left after a half hour into the film.

I believe that my loss of interest was in part a result of the fifteen minutes or so of trailers before the movie started.  Morris Wolfe, analyst of contemporary culture, in the 1970's, referred to JPM's (Jolts Per Minute) as an important factor in the marketability of entertainments.  Now, after having been subject to the visual, auditory, and physical bombardment of those fifteen minutes of trailers, I was thinking that, in 2010, the marketability factor had been accelerated to MJPS -  Mega-Jolts Per Second.  By the end of those trailers, I felt thoroughly beaten down into my seat, never to recover, until eventually I found my way again out into quiet daylight.  As the smash-bash-roar-boom of the trailers subsided, and the more peaceful introduction to the feature film - Alice - began, I found myself fatigued and numb.

Then the movie: It started pleasantly enough; however, in the early minutes of the script's unfolding, it seemed that the film was intent upon introducing a young audience to a variety of the more common, uninteresting stereotypes.  Immediately we were introduced to a physically unattractive and personally unpleasant suitor, to a dictatorial mother-in-law, to a caricature of a spinster aunt hopeful of marriage and so an object to be ridiculed, and so on.  Yawn.

Once Alice followed the White Rabbit down into Wonderland underground, the story disintegrated entirely into a stream of stock, gratuitously-violent, animated action-flick sequences, much of which was entirely an introduced fabrication and had nothing to do with the story as written.

After seeing this mess, I believe that the production companies use the same basic animation sequences repeatedly, in film after film, just re-programming their computer graphics to change the appearance of the characters and settings.  We might as well have been watching movie versions of computer game superheroes battling intergalactic monsters.  Who cares?  Nobody over thirteen, I doubt.

What a wasted opportunity!  That a story with such potential to be presented with subtlety and gentle humour should be made into a technically run-of-the-mill mass-production mish-mash of shallow gimmicks!  It gives one reason to despair once again of any hope for quality in popular entertainment.

Lewis Carroll, in spiritus, to protect our young from the woeful impression that a cultural classic such as Alice in Wonderland teaches value in gratuitous violence and shop-worn stereotypes,  might wish to take out an injunction, or sue to shut down this thoroughly compromised, but also uncompromisingly mis-representative denigration of his work.

These mournful words could just as easily be attributed to the bewildered moviegoer who has shelled out good money for Tim Burton's spectacle-without-substance sequel to that same Carroll classic. As the credits roll and the truth settles in, it is the advice of the wily Cheshire Cat in Holden's book that haunts with its greater truth:

""If you really must go, then it's best you should know

3639906,4,B001HN6940,"So I went and saw Alice in Wonderland as envisioned by Tim Burton, acted by Johnny Depp and scored by Danny Elfman. Call me a squealing fangirl, but that combination frequently results in a cinematic win in my view.

First of all, I liked how they linked with the well known animated Alice in Wonderland. I thought it was I nice bit of continuity and was actually rather grateful that it wasn't a remake and instead more of a sequel. This leads to some rather interesting questions regarding the title of the film and indeed, the entire marketing strategy they used.

Actually, for all the hype Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter got in the trailers and advertising, he didn't overpower everything else going on in the narrative. All the characters seemed to be completely in balance without hijacking any part of the story from Alice. It was very nice. It was also an interesting way to present all of the social pressures acting on her.

In a rare case of happy fangirly squeeing, I can't think of any character, including the villains, that I didn't like. The Red Queen sadly saying, ""It's better to be feared than loved"" was among the best moments of the film. In addition to that, the White Queen's movements and patterns of speech screamed ""Disney Princess"" to me, which might have been overly saccharine and fakey... had it been Alice. The White Queen was a minor enough character that it didn't overpower everything else. I felt that every single character, from the dormouse to the jabberwock were well played and very well voice acted.

The story itself was not as complex as it could have been, but it was still a very cleanly told coming of age tale. I did like the added touch of making Alice older and facing engagement in Victorian England. I especially enjoyed all the parallels that were drawn between Wonderland and the guests at the engagement party. And believe me, there are a lot of them. And it's awesome once you realize where they all are.

The aesthetic didn't distract from the story and instead kept itself as a backdrop and an enhancer. Sometimes the lighting was somewhat overdone, but it seemed to make Alice look pale and colorless that anything else. It did tone down as the film progressed, possibly to show that Alice gained dimension, solidity and maturity as the story kept moving.

I suppose that if I were to levy a complaint, it would be that the comparisons were very obvious and that the story was a bit simplistic at times. It was still well told and definitely geared towards families with young children, but supposed to entertain the adults as well as the kids.

Now I want to go listen to my Looking Glass Wars CD. :P",1272758400,2,2654,4.634042553191489
3639907,3,B001HN6940,"In Tim Burton-directed ""Alice in Wonderland,"" the titular heroine re-visits (not just visits) the strange world where Cheshire Cat and Mad Hatter live. Though two original books of Lewis Carroll serve as the basis of the plot (newly written for the film by Linda Woolverton), Tim Burton's latest offering is about the journey and adventures of grown-up Alice (Mia Wasikowska), now 19 years old, who has almost completely forgotten the magical world, or ""Underland,"" where she once travelled when she was much younger.

This is the second time I was disappointed with Tim Burton's films (the first being ""Planet of the Apes"" - I love ""Mars Attack"" for its sheer ridiculousness). The change of the heroine's age is OK with me as long as the story is interesting. The generic plotline never gives her a chance to show what she can do, however, and I admit Mia Wasikowska is doing her best, Alice's character remains boring and lifeless.

I am not saying there is nothing to be wondered at in ""Alice in Wonderland."" Though they lack in style, the pitch-perfect visuals are gorgeous to look at. Helena Bonham Carter's big-headed Red Queen is amusing to see, and so is Mad Hatter played by Johnny Depp in a delightfully tongue-in-cheek way. One regrettable thing is that these characters are trapped somewhere in the computer-graphic extravaganza and usual ""Good vs Evil"" dichotomy. I almost forgot to say that this is a Disney film.

As in the book, ""Curiouser and curiouser!"" Alice says in Tim Burton's adaptation. My impression about the film is opposite. Alice's new journey looks derivative and uninspired, something I didn't expect from the director of ""Edward Scissorhands.""",1272672000,4,1675,5.017985611510792
3639908,2,B001HN6940,"Why does Tim Burton keep making the same movie? He was very original, and at his prime, with his films like ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""Ed Wood,"" ""Mars Attacks,"" ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" ""Sleepy Hollow,"" and especially ""Big Fish."" But it seems that for the past few years he has been regurgitating the same movie again and again, no matter what the title. It has gotten to the point that as long as you know his style, all they have to do is announce that Burton is doing Charlie or Sweeney or Alice, and I feel like I've seen it already. I can visualize it, therefore I don't need to watch his overanimated rendition of it. It's always better in my mind because he has such awesome potential, but then he just botches the whole thing up.
  Johnny Depp has been one of my favorites since he's been on screen, but it seems as though he does not know how to say ""no"" to his good friend, even when it may be better for his career (which, I guess is respectable to a degree). I honestly believe that he did not have as much fun with his role as the Hatter as he could (and should) have. The character was too down-to-earth. The Scottish dialect transitions did NOT work. They made him less MAD and more RANDOM, and were completely out of context. I feel that his character, and possibly the entire idea of Burton doing Alice, was less because there was a demand for (ANOTHER) interpretation of a story that nothing in this world can convince me to care about, and more aimed to sell the trendy ""today's Burton/Depp project"" merchandise at Hot Topic to all the fashion-challenged sixteen-year-old teenybopper girls. I LOVE Depp's Willy Wonka...*LOVE it*...but I felt as though I was watching Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka pretending to be Jack Sparrow with a James M. Barrie alter-ego as opposed to actually being pulled in to The Mad Hatter as a charismatic, mad, and most importantly, NEW character.
  Helena Bonham-Carter is still boning the director, so of course she's in the movie.
  Though I remember going to the cinema and throwing down the dough to see it and actually sitting through the entire thing, I feel like I am still waiting to see the new ""Alice in Wonderland"" movie that I was actually excited about. Next up: ""Dark Shadows."" Tim Burton/Johnny Depp? Check. Potential for excessive CG environments? Check. Room for Bonham-Carter (and every other regular Burton actor)? *sigh* Check...

3639909,4,B001HN6940,"I've never actually read the books, or seen the cartoon, so I couldn't compare this. To me, it's just another typical gothic Tim Burton movie. Of course, no Tim Burton movie can be complete without Johhny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Danny Elfman music. This was like 'The Wizard of Oz' tripping on acid. 19-year-old Alice is forced to marry, so she runs away and falls down a rabbit hole, into Wonderland. She must team up with the Mad Hatter and try to stop the evil Red Queen. I'd probably recommend ALICE IN WONDERLAND!!!",1272585600,3,528,4.627659574468085
3639910,5,B001HN6940,"Went to see the movie when it first came out and was NOT disappointed. This movie was breathtaking in scenery, saturated in colour, the acting was incredible and the music was the icing on the cake. There wasn't a moment of boredom!

I had read the White Queen stole the show but I beg to differ. While all the actors turned in a wonderful performance in their own right...the Mad Hatter was endearing, Alice was wonderful and irritating as a 19 yr old is, the Red Queen was outlandish as only she can be and her Knight was self-serving in grandiose way. But the one who stole the show in my opinion was Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat...the cat was sly, cunning, sweet, came and went (as cats do) and was the best in show.

I've loved Alice in Wonderland since my Grandmother used to read me the Jabberwoky as a bedtime poem. I came out with stars in my eyes and knowing that I must own this movie. It is one of Tim Burton and Danny Elfman's best. The critics know not of what they speak. It is a must see movie! This is the stuff that dreams are made of.",1272499200,3,1056,4.197044334975369
3639911,5,B001HN6940,"I was never a fan of the original Alice -- not as a book (despite some brilliant bits), never as a movie (ugh). I am a fan of Burton.

This update, simply, rocks. Better than any Alice before.

Amazing visual effects -- the environment, the Queen of Heart's Army and the Queen herself! I loved Bonham Carter (huge fan since Fight Club and Sweeney Todd) and I especially love her makeup artist (Clara Bow, eat your heart out -- these are lips!) And who figured out how to distort the Red Queen's body?! And good work on the Cheshire Cat, guys!

Honestly, I didn't love the Jabberwock -- too much like Enchanted's awful CG dragon which was too much like too many other CG dragons in too many other special effects movies. Only Shrek has managed to make a CG dragon that works, and that's even given Dreamwork's awful 3D work. That said, the final battle actually worked well.

Depp's gay (again), but I didn't mind. His Mad Hatter is a lovely person and, like Bonham Carter, a visual treat.

I even found myself liking Anne Hathaway and I really don't like Anne Hathaway.

All in all, despite the unfortunate CG Jabberwock, a truly frabjous outing.",1272412800,2,1146,4.538834951456311
3639912,3,B001HN6940,"Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland didn't exactly live up to its hype, yet it was not as terrible as what many other reviewers have been saying.  I would agree that more attention seemed to be given to the 3-D effects and small details than the storyline, but that's to be expected for a ""kids"" movie (especially from Burton).  The movie was appropriate for all audiences, but was probably more interesting to the younger generations (despite the disturbing Red Queen and her demand for ""Off with their heads!"").  What I enjoy most about the movie is the inspiration that Alice offers to each individual and the reminder she gives that every person has the ability to become something great.  The movie also persuades the audience to root for the underdog.  It seems as though all the odds are against Alice, but with the help of friends, she triumphs.  This reminds me of Ecclesiastes 4:12 that says, ""Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves.  A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.""  When we team up, the tough stuff can be accomplished!  The Red Queen serves as the perfect example of an individual blinded by their selfishness.  Fortunately a corrupt leader/person will always get what they deserve in the long run (Romans 2:12).  Overall, remember to speak up for yourself and don't go along with the crowd (""Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind"" Romans 12:2).  Do what is right, even if it's hard because the outcome is worth it!!",1272240000,,1526,4.738636363636363

It is obvious that he only cares about the visuals, but that results into a boring movie, because the ""plot"" (so to speak) is utterly uninteresting. Lucky I watched it on 3D, as a 2D movie it would be twice as flat. Needless to say I will not purchase it, I couldn't stand this movie more than once, honestly.

Tim Burton made a movie that remade the way wonderland looked. The scenery was strange and the characters were well acted and well scripted. The Mad Hatter bacame more of a main character in this film and Alice's character is developed throughout the movie. Johnny Depp did a wonderful job of making the Mad Hatter a strange, somewhat crazy character. This film was a wonderful story with mystery and eeriness that makes wonderland a seperate world from our own, but still with small similarities. I loved this movie, and thought that the acting was great, the scenery was wonderful, and the characters were all well developed and enjoyable. This movie was a wonderful film for all age groups. The fact that it is coming out on blu-ray with the dvd and digital copy just makes the release even better. This movie is definitely worth buying.

3639929,4,B001HN6940,"For starters, it seems that everyone I know is shocked when I tell them that this Alice in Wonderland is a sequel of sorts. At the age of 19 and about to be forced into marriage, this is Alice's second trip to Wonderland. I'm glad Tim Burton and his team came up with a new story that still featured all the great characters from the original source material. That's also where the weakest part of the movie lies. The dialogue given to the characters is great, but the script is razor thin. I think if more effort went into this particular aspect, I might have given it five stars.

I saw it in IMAX 3-D and the visuals are as grand and beautiful as you would expect from Burton. It's not quite as eye-popping as Avatar, which was shot completely in IMAX 3-D, whereas, Alice in Wonderland was upconverted (Clash of the Titans did the same thing to bad effect). The music by Danny Elfman is some of his best stuff in recent years and the costumes/makeup are top notch.

Aside from the look of film, the acting also makes it very memorable. There are so many well animated and voice acted characters running around I don't know where to begin. I guess I'll start with those made of flesh and blood. I didn't like Depp's take on Willy Wonka that much, and I'm a big fan of his, but his Mad Hatter is just the right amount of crazy. His voice goes back and forth from having a lisp to sounding like William Wallace from Braveheart. His look is so jarring, you probably wouldn't even know it was him if you somehow dodged all the advertisements before entering the theater. Helena Bonham Carter played the Red Queen brilliantly. I couldn't take my eyes off her giant head. Anne Hathaway really surprised me here (in a good way) with her take on the White Queen and it was nice to see Crispin Glover back on the big screen in a role that suited him. Last, but certainly not least, Mia Wasikowska was absolutely captivating as Alice. The way she talked and her reactions were just what the film needed in it's central role. All the digital animal characters were great, but my favorites were the Cheshire Cat, voice by Stephen Fry, and the March Hare voiced by Paul Whitehouse.

I'm somewhat surprised that the combination of violence and meanness, along with the smoking Blue Caterpillar didn't get this a PG-13 rating. It's not too harsh, but young kids might get a little freaked out.

Overall, Alice in Wonderland looks like a polished jewel, has great acting/voice acting, wonderful music and even manages to get quite a few laughs in the process. If only the simple story didn't let me down in the end, this could have been a classic in the making. Even still, I wouldn't mind Tim Burton taking us on another trip down the rabbit hole in a few years.",1271462400,117,2749,4.47011952191235
3639930,4,B001HN6940,"In spite of having to read many negative reviews, I was still curious to see this movie. I not a huge Burton fan neither, although I've enjoyed some of his previous work. But it was something about Alice in Wonderland which seemed appealing; its visual look and its quirky characters. Still I had in mind the several hostile reviews, which accused this movie to be a flat, soulless and muddled attempt of a classic, which I also feared it would. But after finally seeing the movie, I can claim my disagreement with the reviewers. In fact, I'm not sure if we even saw the same movie. What exactly was so terrible about it?

Overall, I found Alice in Wonderland to be very entertaining. I feared that the movie would lose some of it's magic as the main character entered to Wonderland, but fortunately it never did. I enjoyed the movie from the very start to its very end. It's a cute fantasy/adventure movie, equal to the Harry Potter and the Narnia flicks (although I personally felt Prince Caspain had some slight weaknesses). But beware; there are some frightening creatures that may scare the youngest in the audience, so the PG rating is suitable.

One of the films biggest advantages is it visuals. With it lush and dark landscapes, cute animals and colorful costumes, the flick is beautifully to look at and I can't wait to enjoy the sharpness of the picture on Blu Ray. The score of Danny Elfman is effective and gives the movie a dreamy, atmospheric tone. The characters are mostly passable. They don't steal the show entirely, but neither do they appear as distractive or annoying.

Although I've always liked the original novel of Lewis Carroll, I must say that I found this new twist of the story fresh and creative, depicting the wrong Alice's adventures in Wonderland as a young adult. Linda Woolverton, who's behind the excellent screenplays for Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King and Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey, has written a solid and decent script to Wonderland. Many have claimed this screenplay to be muddled and confusing, but I didn't felt it that way at all. Once again, did we even saw the same movie?

Mia Wasikowska is quite decent as Alice. Although she doesn't have a distinctive emanation/charisma who characterizes other young actresses at her age, she's still delivers a nice and acceptable performance. Personally I felt her screen presence expanded during the movie. Johnny Depp is indeed a good actor. To claim anything else, would be a like claiming that the climate isn't humid in the rain forest. Although I've never been crazy over Depp's work, he's goofy and great as The Mad Hatter, which is indeed the best character in the movie. Helena Bonham Carter is also believable and funny as the Red Queen (just prepare yourself to hear Off with his head at least a hundred times during the movie, ha ha). While Anne Hathaway, on the other hand, is warm and passable as the White Queen (although I must confess it was a little distracting to see her with a blonde wig and with a British accent).

In fact, I can't see anything wrong with this new Burton version of Wonderland. I truly enjoyed it and recommend it to everyone as possible. It didn't deserve the negative criticism at all, in my opinion. With quality films like this, perhaps I could finally forgive Disney for its recent mistakes? (*Cough, leaving hand drawn animation behind and promoting teen stars as crazy, cough*)

So follow every white rabbit you see and follow him to the hole... Wonderland is waiting...

BONUS FEATURES
Unsurprisingly, most of the bonus features lies on the Blu ray disc. However, the amount of the bonus features are disappointingly skimpy. The featurettes are divided in two sections. First are the Wonderland Characters and Making of Wonderland.

First up in the Wonderland Characters-section is ""Finding Alice"", which is about the casting of main lead. During a short brief or times, there are interviews with Mia Wazikovska, Tim Burton, Helena Bonham-Carter and Anne Hathaway. They bring up Burton's vision that differs from the Novel, the character arc of the protagonist and some of the clothing designs. Wazikovska herself comes off as a humble, mature and reflective young woman.

Next on the list is ""The Mad Hatter"", which is about Depp's insights on his character. Depp manages to give a brief, but interesting research about real hatters, while he talks about his own sketches and visions for the Mad Hatter, comparing to Burton's sketches for the character. And of course the costume and stylizing of the character.

""The Futterwacken Dance"" explains the origins of the fictional Futterwacken dance which Depp's character dances in the movie. The dance was based on an internal joke between the director and Depp. Without spoiling too much, there are interviews with several guys who were in charge of the ""Futterwacken"".

Next is ""The Red Queen"", which centers about the origins of the Red Queen. Interviews with Bonham-Carter and technical members of the crew, they discuss the design and the costuming of the character, as well as Helena's own thoughts of her own performance.

""Time-Lapse: Sculpting The Red Queen"" is a short video demonstrating the transformation and sculpting of Helena as the Red Queen, while Helena and other make-up artists narrates during the video.

Next is ""The White Queen"", which is about the creation of The White Queen.  Hathaway explains her own, early visions for the character, as well the costuming and the other crew members' thoughts of the character.

The first featurette in the Making Wonderland section is Scoring Wonderland. An interesting featurette about the scoring of the film. During an interview with composer Danny Elfman, we'll receive his thoughts about his collaboration with Burton, as well as his process about the film scoring and especially making the ""Alice"" anthem.  Quite interesting and informative.

Effecting Wonderland is an interesting featurette about the CGI aspect of the film, the creation of the fully CGI characters in the film and how to exaggerate the looks of the human characters with CGI.

Stunts in Wonderland is a brief featurette about the stunt process of Mia Wazikowska.

Making the Proper Size is about the process of giving the character of Alice the proper size. Interviews with Waizkowska and other crew members reveals the process of making Wazikowska look to small or too big in the various scenes in the film.

Cakes of Wonderland interviews a baker which made all the cakes in the final film, especially the Eat Me cakes. She talks about the ingredients which she used in the film to make the cakes.

Tea Party Props centers about the making of the Iconic Tea Party table and all of its props.

So there you have it; Tim Burton's version of Alice in Wonderland. While it's not one of the most memorable movies of its genre, it is still a solid and good movie that has gotten way more underrated than it deserves. The quality of the picture is superb and so is the sound. While most of the featurettes are interesting and enjoyable, there could still have been of more of them. However, this edition is still recommendable for every fan of this movie.",1271462400,257,7189,4.885057471264368
3639931,2,B001HN6940,"Watching Alice, you'd never think you were watching a Tim Burton film. Burton is a creative director with an eye for whimsy and colorful as well as strange and macabre-but you feel none of that when watching Alice in Woderland. Yes it is vivid and full of color and wonky shaped objects fill every screen-but it never really resonates with you. There is no mystery or 'wow' factor. It's sort of pretty to look at, but that's all it is.

The actual story is a tad confusing as well as you're not really sure if you are watching a sequel to anything or a retelling. It just feels sort of hasty and rushed in certain parts. There is no flow or direction and then your at the end of the film and it all just feels...strange. And speaking of strange, I just found the ending (after she leaves Wonderland) really weird and pointless, unless I missed something entirely while watching the very beginning.

In regards to characters and acting, Helena Bonham Carter is the star of this production, by far. She's crazy, delusional and utterly perfect in this role. Even hearing ""off with their head!"" didn't get stale after so long. Johhny Depp as the Mad Hatter was a dissapointment. He's supposed to be loony, but there are times when you think he knows exactly what he's doing. His accent is distracting and overall, I just wasn't feeling the performance. Anne Hathaway has a short but cute part as the White Queen, the evil Queen of Heart's sister. It's slightly over the top but works for her. As for the Alice herself, played by Mia Wasikowska, well to be honest, I barely remember her. She was very passive and bland throughout the entire film and didn't really emote , well, anything. I can't review this film properly without including Mr. Alan Rickman...He plays Caterpillar, of course, and though his role is very small, it is also quite enjoyable. It's amazing what that man does with his voice. He flawlessy goes from berating to indifferent to sarcastic all in the span of a sentence. Just brilliant.

All in all I was dissapointed. What should have been a slam dunk for Burton turned out to be a bore-fest. All the ingredients are there-but he just didn't cook up a good one this time around...",1271376000,5,2199,4.604591836734694
3639932,2,B001HN6940,"Tim Burton's version of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice in Wonderland"" is 98% Tim Burton and 2% Lewis Carroll. Like other versions of the Victorian classics, Burton's interpretation combines the two separate stories ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There"", but this time so many liberties have been taken with the two plots there is almost no recognizable resemblance. Burton has tried here to run all the box-office bases: cute talking animals for the kids, violent special effects for teenaged boys, and a feminist heroine for young women. The combination seems awfully contrived and the picture completely lacks Lewis Carroll's charm and cleverness. I have to doubt that Linda Woolverton, in creating her screenplay, really gave that much attention to the original stories. For instance, in ""Through the Looking Glass"" the monster's name is Jabberwock, not Jabberwocky -- it's the mock epic itself which is called Jabberwocky. Also, Tweedledee and Tweedledum are much more schizoid in Lewis Carroll than the sitcom pair presented here. The Red Queen has been combined with the Queen of Hearts, and her rivalry with her sister the White Queen takes on a Broadway slant  la ""Wicked"". Completely new characters -- a fierce knight and a friendly dog -- only add to the considerable clutter. The Mad Tea Party is not so much mad as sloppy slapstick, though I have to admit that Disney's 1951 version is not much better in this respect. (That version of ""Alice is Wonderland"" is my least favorite Disney, though I don't include the inanities of the past few years.)  In fact, there is almost nothing 19th Century about Burton's movie, and that includes the framing story of Alice being married off to an oaf. (Alice is nineteen years old in this version, and her return to Wonderland causes a lot of bother as to whether or not she is the real Alice.)  Needless to say, Tenniel's illustrations have been completely ignored, in favor of loud and overbearing  creations produced (I assume) with CGI. I'm not certain what Burton was trying to achieve here. Was he trying to be adept, hip, advanced, all of the above? Well, he failed. His Wonderland is a flat and unimaginative excuse for fantasy.",1271030400,9,2235,5.0

Perry's Previews:

------------

What would the young Alice from ""Alice in Wonderland"" be like... 13 years later?  Faced with the challenges and issues of adult life, will she have time to retreat into the fantasy world of Wonderland?

 Tim Burton's new film adds a unique twist to the classic story.  It is about love, courage, sacrifice, dreams, and reality.

 When 19-year-old Alice Kingsley is invited to a surprise party hosted for her own engagement, she sees a peculiar sight: a rabbit in formal clothing pointing to his watch and beckons her to join him.  She follows him down a large hole, and through many twists and turns, ends up in the land where all of her childhood dreams took place.  She finds out that the Red Queen had governed poorly and cruelly, giving death to all the people who did not follow her rules.

 Alice must bring order to the land and make the Red Queen pay for her wrong doings.  In Wonderland, which is called ""Underland"" in the new film, Alice meets many strange creatures, such as the fat, argumentative twins Tweedledum and Tweedeldee, grotesque beasts such as Jabberwocky, a clown-like Mad Hatter with a crazy smile and red hair, a mysterious blue-striped cat who can disappear instantly, a wise Caterpillar who smokes, and two sibling rulers who are the exact opposite of each other.

 A calendar scroll has not only what happened to the Underland, but foretells what will happen in the future, including an epic battle which makes Alice realize who she really is.

 I can relate to Alice because I have a wild imagination too.  I made up many stories to share with my mom when I was in pre-school, including one with me being a spirit in the sky and breaking a magic teapot in order to come to the ground and finding my mom by recognizing her beautiful garden.  One of my favorite activities these days is still making and sharing stories with mom.

 My two favorite characters are Alice and the Mad Hatter.  Alice has great imagination, just like her beloved diseased father ""who could imagine six impossible things before breakfast.""  Alice said ""Why don't you just paint the white roses red"" when her potential future mother-in-law wished she had red roses instead.  I like the Mad Hatter (played by Johnny Depp) because he is charming, loyal, and risked his life for Alice many times.

 One of my favorite scenes is when the Bandersnatch, a giant, savage, muscular, snow leopard-like creative with claws as long as your hand licks Alice's wounds that he made in an earlier fight.  I also like the scene that followed when Alice rides the Bandersnatch after taming him in an impossible gesture of forgiveness.

 I give the film 4.5 out of 5 starfish.  I enjoyed the many unexpected yet believable scenes related to the character development.  I loved the stunning visuals and 3D effects that made the characters jump out of the screen in a riot of colors!  Meeting Tim Burton and Johnny Depp at the Disney D23 Fan Expo last September was a real treat.  The film has a powerful moral:

 Imagination makes you discover who you truly are.",1271030400,5,3192,4.729582577132486

3639935,5,B001HN6940,"This film is the most surprising adaptation of this typically Victorian novel for children written by Lewis Carroll and published in 1865, one hundred and fifty years ago. Centered on a woman, Alice, it is a memento about the role of women in society and their necessary liberation. The queen was Victoria and as such was setting an example, and in 1865 she was still young. Lewis Carroll with his two queens fighting for supremacy and the crown is providing a caricature of what the world would be if only women were at the top and that is a direct allusion to the debate of the time when Queen Victoria became a widow and refused to remarry. Behind this discourse about the liberation of women, or rather the promotion of women into responsible positions in the world, there is the discourse that they need men to stabilize and balance their government, their authority. It is obvious that Alice ending up as the captain (really?) of a colonial ship is the modern addition to the tale.

But this story is of course the matrix of a tremendous amount of childrens literature in England, though rarely so much oriented on women. We can think of The Chronicles of Narnia by another Lewis, C.S. this one, where girls and boys are more equally balanced. And in this case there is also at the beginning a tyrannical queen. We could on the other hand think of Tolkien and his Hobbit or his Lord of the Ring and there men and boys, all males of course, are vastly dominant and we go back to the plain old pattern. This being said what is the creative dimension of this particularly adaptation?

First of all the technique is using all kinds of tricks to manipulate the pictures and make people disappear or appear, the cat particularly. Along the same line it uses monstrous beings like the Jabberwocky, or distorted beings like the two fat boys. On the other hand some are supremely realistic like the dogs. He is also able to use a mixture of digitally mastered beings like the card soldiers within a natural setting and with human actors. But those techniques are now very standardized in the cinema with Dreamworks Studios for example or the various Star Wars films.

The second originality of this film is that it is entirely in full colors, and the dark scenes are rare, in the forest a little bit and a couple of night scenes. But otherwise it is luxuriant in colors, both the real world and Wonderland, called Underland or not. I must admit too that the fall in the dark hole is extravagant and brilliantly composed.

The third element is of course the use of the strange mysterious language the hatter and some others practice. That language is typical of Lewis Carroll who has been using that type of meaningless gibberish language in many poems too, like The Hunting of the Snark. Lewis Carroll was a mathematical mind in a way and he considered that what Saussure was going to call the arbitrariness of the linguistic sign was absolute and thus anyone could invent new signs, meaning words, as long as the syntax, the formal rules associating these words, and the intonation were respected. So in his world Fridig imeas man flowbaster fluously akum spoul midsten spoof, as long as the intonation centers properly on the modal man and the verb flowbaster. We understand the intonation of what the hatter says not the words but that does not matter because it is the Hatter and he is there to make us believe we are in another universe.

The fourth element is the overflowing of all kinds of feelings and emotions in this film. The characters are suffering, crying, getting angry, fearful and frightened, they start running away and hiding and yet are captured and beheaded while one queen is enjoying such torturing and capital punishment and at the same time the other queen seems to be weak and maybe even impotent. And what is that queen who has taken vows that prevent her from defending her own country and people? Thats the aristocratic superiority wrapped up in vows that sound kind of religious. Is she a nun or something? She does not sound very pleasant.

The fifth element I like and dislike at the same time is the forced cohabitation of the red queen and her knight in exile tied up one to the other. Thats cruel and useless. Why didn't Tim Burton put them to work at some useful task, not useful for them but useful for the people, like cleaning up their mess and rebuilding the ruins? In other words Tim Burton did not modernize the tale entirely, certainly not enough.

The sixth point is the Hatter. He was of course expected to be great and Johnny Depp makes it outstanding, outscoring, outreaching in all directions and he is really superb, except his last dance, a fudderwupping that looks like no whipping no feathers not at all and which could sound OK on paper but does not look that realistic nor attractive, like some kind of extravaganza by some contorsionist, though I would prefer it here in German, ein Schlangenmensch or eine Schlangenfrau or even why not ein Schlangenweib. But that sounds and looks barbaric. I am sure Tim Burton could have thought of something more realistic that children could have imitated like some voodoo trance extreme dancing. Thats Tim Burtons problem: at times he overuses his technology and seems to think a technical prank has to be artistically good. But it is not always the case.

3639936,5,B001HN6940,"This version of Alice was, indeed, a pleasant take on the whole story that we all know so well.  My wife and I found it to be one of those flicks that stick with you for a few days.  In the deft hands of Tim Burton, the entire experience was delightful and nothing below outstanding.  It was clear that he had full control over all aspects of the filming process.  The acting was superb, and the story was very well-written.  The visual stimulation was enough on its own without the story.  Great job and thumbs up all around!!!",1270857600,4,528,4.336734693877551
3639937,4,B001HN6940,"I didn't feel a compulsion to see this film. I like Johnny Depp but don't have the need to see whatever role he's taken on.

But a friend wanted to go and I tagged along.

Here are a few things that surprised me.

I liked it. Didn't love it but liked it enough that I can suggest that those who love good vs. evil, mythical war scenes and mild to moderate adventure to give it a shot.

Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter is a skillfully played and entertaining if sadly whimsical character but he is not the main player. The point of view is primarily Alice. The Hatter doesn't appear until about a half hour or so into the film and then comes and goes after that. His film time ends up being maybe half of the film. The Red Queen is a slightly bigger (pun intended) player in the whole storyline. The well done and creepily compelling characterization by Helena Bonham Carter may never, never leave my psyche.

The plot line is a parallel story to the traditional Alice adventure. Some of the plot is familiar like the shrinking and growing Alice, tea parties and beheadings. What's not familiar is an interesting addition to a more grown-up version. The first 15-20 minutes is very low key in the adventure department so don't expect to find yourself plunging immediately into a rabbit hole.

I don't know that I'd recommend this film for very sensitive children. Tim Burton and Depp fans may or may not love it. I'd watch it again and probably will but I probably won't own it for regular viewing.",1270771200,,1495,4.457875457875458
3639938,4,B001HN6940,"Mad as a hatter and wildly audacious, this fantastical 2010 adventure turns Lewis Carroll's classic tale of surreal logic displacement on its ear. Who better to translate this story into a female empowerment parable than the master of quirky darkness, director Tim Burton, and his favorite muse Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter? The excesses of Burton's imagination, guided by Linda Woolverton's (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lion-King/dp/B00003CXB4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lion King</a>) sharp-tongued screenplay, result in a particularly idiosyncratic adaptation. Yet, as dazzling and sometimes scarifying as the computer-generated images are, the film is not overwhelmed by the visual elements and retains the basic themes of the original stories.

Combining elements of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-s-Adventures-in-Wonderland/dp/1402725027/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>&nbsp;with its sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Through-the-Looking-Glass/dp/0543900568/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Through the Looking Glass</a>, the movie begins when a young Alice awakens from a nightmare in which she has visited Wonderland. The obviously precocious child questions her sanity to which her father assures her that it's fine to be ""bonkers"", all the best people are. Flash forward several years later, and Alice has become a rebellious nineteen-year-old on her way to a garden party where all the guests are to witness her being engaged to a patronizing fop named Hamish. She hesitates and asks for a moment at which point she chases a rabbit from her earlier dream into a hole. Perpetually shrinking and enlarging, she finds herself in not Wonderland but Underland where she sees all the talking creatures from her dream, but this time, they all question whether she is the real Alice. They all need the Alice of their collective memory, the one who would have no trouble defeating the monstrous Jabberwocky and ending the reign of the evil Red Queen.

Once Alice joins the Mad Hatter's party, it becomes clear she is not in a dream of her making, that she is being signaled to make her own way in life and within Underland, ensure that the virtuous White Queen be restored to the throne, even donning Joan of Arc-like armor for the climactic battle scene. Australian actress Mia Wasikowska (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amelia/dp/B0030E5NJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amelia</a>) makes a terrifically wary Alice whose sense of wonder is tempered by her palpable search for self-confidence. As you would expect, Depp has the showiest role as the Mad Hatter, all leering smiles and electro-shock orange hair, and he makes the most of it despite an incongruous dance solo toward the end. With her head blown up three times its normal size, Helena Bonham Carter has a field day as the decapitation-crazed Red Queen as she barks orders at her lackeys and demands to be pampered with pigs being used as footrests.

The rest of the cast make the impressions needed within the dimensions of the story - Stephen Fry as the dapper but cowardly Cheshire Cat; Crispin Glover as the villainous Knave of Hearts tending to the Red Queen's absurd orders; Alan Rickman as the surly, hookah-smoking Caterpillar; and English comedian Matt Lucas as Tweedledee and Tweedledum, perhaps the most Disneyesque of the characters conceived here. Only Anne Hathaway disappoints in an arch turn as the White Queen, appearing to channel her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Princess-Diaries/dp/B00006L948/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Princess Diaries</a>&nbsp;co-star, Julie Andrews, in accentuated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mary-Poppins/dp/B001JRB16U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mary Poppins</a>&nbsp;mode. All the production values are first-class from Robert Stromberg's wildly varied production design to Dariusz Wolski's rich cinematography and Danny Elfman's bombastic music score. The movie does meander at various points, primarily to establish the next story turn, but fans of Burton's and Depp's work shouldn't be too disappointed.",1270339200,4,4326,6.442340791738382
3639939,4,B001HN6940,"For someone who is not a big fan of the story ""Alice in Wonderland,"" I am surprised that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did. In Tim Burton's film, Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is all grown up and escapes from an unwanted marriage proposal by falling down a rabbit hole and returning to the strange world she visited during her childhood. The kingdom is in peril, suffering under the rule of the Red Queen (played brilliantly by Helena Bonham Cater, who is by far the best part of the movie). Alice encounters many old friends, including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), who attempts to help Alice slay the Red Queen's Jabberwocky and save the kingdom.

This is a very good film. The story is clever and the cast is very good, with the exception of Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. (Her idea of acting in this film is keeping her arms raised above her head the entire time. So annoying.) I saw the movie in 3D, which is something I didn't think I would enjoy but actually did. Instead of being a distraction, the 3D effects just served to make Alice's world look even stranger.

""Alice in Wonderland"" still isn't my favorite fairy tale, but this new and improved version is much more enjoyable than the original Disney cartoon, and I recommend seeing it in the theatre for the 3D experience.",1270166400,2,1285,4.510729613733906
3639940,4,B001HN6940,"To kick things off with a personal note, lately I haven't been as into movies as I once had.  After Pirates 3 (At World's End) and Spiderman 3 debuted, I'd lost a lot interest in just 'enjoying' film for the excitement and then became severely critical when reviewing them.  Then along came this year (and when I refer to this year, I mean going back 12 months from today)  Films like Avatar, Shutter Island and (of course) Alice in Wonderland brought back my interest in engaging and enjoying films.

Alice in Wonderland, while obviously not possessing Avatar nor Shutter Island-like cinematic quality, it is still a 'very' enjoyable film for the visuals (absolutely pristine), the characters (excellently cast) and maybe, just maybe- the screenplay, which is scattered with funny bits throughout.  Johnny Depp is wonderful at his characterization as Tim Burton's take on the mad hatter, and Helen Boham Carter is... in her entirety- 'amazing' as the red queen (her shrieks--including the patented ""Off with her head!""-- that will literally make the audience squirm in their seats).

Now, for those hoping to see an accurate take on Lewis Carroll's book, get that thought out of your heads- now.  This is nothing like the book, nor its follower ""Through the Looking Glass"".  To put it more accurately, it's a spin-off of the original storyline.

In this story, Alice (Mia Wasikowsk)  is 19, and is once again led back to 'Underland' (or Wonderland, as we know it better) to fight the Red Queen (Helen Boham Carter), who's bratty and spoiled tendancies have gone completely out of line since her last visit, which Alice does not remember.  She is joined by the classic bunch of Wonderland characters, including the White Rabbit (voiced Michael Sheen), Chesire Cat (Stephen Fry), the mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) as well as a bunch of other familiar faces.  After finding out she is the only one who can stop the queen's tyranny (which involves slaying the Jabberwocky--a monster about five times her size) she finds herself fleeing from the queen's army, led by the persistent, blood-thirsty knave of Hearts (Crispin Glover), her destiny and even herself.  Soon finding out just merely running away is not the answer, and also bearing the consequences that come with it she eventually claims responsility, and faces off against her enemies, one by one.

Be warned, this isn't a five year old's Disney movie (meaning, it isn't like those princess films you put on for your five year old daughter).  It contains violence, severed heads floating in a moat (queen of hearts, what do you expect?), decapitation, gore, and even a scene of sexual harassment.  If you had to rate it accurately, its more like PG/PG13 borderline, instead of the PG rating it was bestowed with. So make sure your kid, nephew, niece, grandkid, whatever, is at least 8 years old, or failing that, very mature or (most likely in this era) completely desensitized.

Closing, Alice in Wonderland is a good film for anyone just looking for something to enjoy for fun, but for someone looking for a hard-core masterpiece or for something that will leave you thinking... look somewhere else.",1269993600,,3152,4.9506641366223905
3639941,4,B001HN6940,"As an ""Alice"" purist I generally cringe at the assortment of attempts to adapt either of Lewis Carroll's works ""Alice in Wonderland"" and/or ""Through the Looking Glass"" to the movie screen.  These have been of varying quality but even the best are no more than satisfactory (""Dreamchild"" being an exception but it was more about the real Alice than about the Wonderland Alice).

But I had a pretty good idea what I was getting into before shelling out the bucks to see this Burton effort in 3-D.  I knew that despite what many have said and despite its title, this is not an adaptation of Carroll's books.  Accordingly I knew that this would greatly increase my toleration level.  They could do what they liked with the traditional characters and play around with whatever sort of plot elements intrigued them; I would not take particular offense.

That said I had no real problem with anything about the film.  In Burton and writer Linda Woolverton's story, Alice revisits Wonderland/The Looking Glass House 13 years after waking up from her original dreams.  Alice, now almost 20, is attending her sister's garden party, which she discovers is intended to be her engagement party.  Cringing at a marriage proposal from the unappealing son of her father's former business partner, she runs from the party and follows a white rabbit down an immense hole.

Her seemingly endless fall is arguably the best scene of the film and is by far the best Hollywood has ever assembled; even including a slick twist at the bottom where her hair is standing on end.  Then she repeats the drink-me eat-me shrinking-growing bit from the book.  And these two sequences are pretty much the only thing other than the characters that come directly out of the book.  One advantage of having a 20-year-old Alice is that her clothes do not shrink or grow with her size changes.  She must improvise on each occasion and this adds a touch of physical comedy to the transformations.

For her part Alice seems to have suppressed the memory of her two childhood dreams, showing little familiarity with the characters she is meeting for a second time (in some cases a third time).  And initially they are unsure that she is the same Alice who visited them over a decade earlier.  But for the white rabbit, the dormouse, the Tweedles, and the smoking caterpillar she has be the right Alice because they have lured her back to fulfill a prophecy.  It has been foretold that  Alice will slay the Jabberwocky (a dragon worthy of the lizards in the old 50's sci-fi films) with a magical sword.  This will change the balance of power, with the good White Queen getting the crown from the wicked Red Queen. We've seen this thing before, insert: ""Narnia, Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings"" here. And they throw in a few visuals from ""The Neverending Story"" series.

Ultimately Alice goes all ""Joan of Arc"" or at least ""Jane and the Dragon"" and becomes a knight in armor.  Many have lamented this action adventure turn of the story but the actual showdown takes only about 10 minutes so I don't think it is that big of a deal.  And it has some considerable basis as Alice had been the White Queen's Pawn (because the Queen's daughter Lily was too young to play) throughout the chess match in ""Through the Looking Glass"". That story was just one big chess game with a lengthy combat segment between the White Knight and the Red Knight, as well as a fight between the ""Gladstone"" Lion and the ""Disraeli"" Unicorn for the crown.  The only problem I see is that the combat is all too predictable.

Mia Waisikowska strikes a perfect balance as the title character, playing the bravest heroine in literary history requires a lot of nonverbal stuff and she sells her reluctance nicely along with giving her character a subtle sensual dimension.

Helena Bonham Carter pretty much steals the film, although she is upstaged on occasion by the grinning Cheshire cat.  Depp's Mad Hatter never quite comes into focus, playing the character as a schizophrenic (at least that's what I assume he was doing) introduced a little too much pain into this type of story; in much the same way that his take on Willy Wonka just brought the viewer down.  A run-of-the-mill lunatic would worked better.

As the White Queen, Anne Hathaway was pretty much irrelevant and was most likely cast because of her ""small"" head (her features seem to take up her entire face-especially with the extreme make-up),  a kind of good-guy bad-guy balance for her evil sister's big head.  But I did like the off-kilter Morticia Addams take she gave her character; rather than playing her as a goody-two-shoes.

The audience during my showing was attentive and entertained from beginning to end (well almost to the end as the film goes out on a couple of extremely weak scenes back on the surface).  But most bolted before the closing credits, which played over Avril Lavigne singing ""Alice"" (Avril also appears in the film's trailer).  Given that it is mostly up-scale theaters with state-of-the-art sound systems showing this film, those who left missed one of the best moments of the whole viewing experience.  Not unlike those who missed the great closing credits animation sequences at the end of ""A Series of Unfortunate Events"".

3639943,2,B001HN6940,"i thought about this. this movie has terrible values. most over-blown large budget film making often does. there was no need for yet another version of 'Alice'. and this one is the worst. it makes the Irwin Allen adaptation look good.
  who would be so foolish as to let a kid see a movie where a young girl walks up to a very old woman and tells her she's deluded? she's an old woman with very little time left to change. that was bratty, rude, and uncivil. Carroll believed in civility and would have trumped that situation fast. there was no point to it. it was wrong. Burton's Alice needs to grow up and stop bossing everyone around.
 also it's foolish to tell your children ""that some of the very best people are insane"". insanity and mental illness are much more complex than that. children should be careful about mental illness, it's a dark unhappy thing and some mentally ill people can be dangerous. not all, but some. so be careful!

  Tim Burton's direction and Johhny Depp's performance were very good, but Linda Woolverton's screenplay was ridiculous tripe and not worthy of the original story by Carroll. I hated everything about the way she ended this. equating feminism with commerce and rudeness. shame on her, she is a total beast.
 you are better off with the beautiful Jonathan Miller version or the original Disney cartoon classic than with this idiotic, over commercialized junk.
  if you must have your children watch this than you get what you get. it's maybe not the worst film in the world, but it's shallow, thoughtless and vacuous. is that how you want your children to grow up? if it is, then i wouldn't want to be YOU for anything in this world. i've pretty much had it with everyone's brainless tampering with all that is right, sound and clearly good.

3639944,5,B001HN6940,"Tim Burton and Lewis Carrol's ""Alice"" books seemed, when this project was announced, to be a perfect combination. I waited with great anticipation to see the result and I know many others did too - and I was not disappointed.
The story follows an adult Alice, who is at a crossroads after being proposed to her by a wealthy heir, but one whom she feels nothing for. At just this moment, she espies the White Rabbit, who leads her into Wonderland, a strange land that she visited in her childhood, but believed to be just a dream. There she meets the familiar characters of the Mad Hatter and his tea drinking posse, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the Caterpillar and the Cheshire Cat. They have been waiting hopefully for her return, as she is the one who will end the rule of the paranoid and violent Red Queen, a character amalgam of the Red Qeen from ""Through the Looking Glass"" and The Queen of Hearts from ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"". She eventualy becomes the champion of the benevolent but exiled White Queen and is set on a collision course with the Red Queen and her forces, including the sly and mean-spirited Knave of Hearts (who seems to amalgamate The Knave of Hearts from ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and The Red Knight from ""Through the Looking Glass"") and the fearsome Jabberwocky, the dragon that protects the Red Queen from challenges.
 Many, it sems, were disappointed with this. Some complain that it eschews the books fragmented plot in favour of a quest structure, while others complain of the lack of storyline. Burton, by his own admission focuses on characters and imagery rather than story. This is a valid approach as cinema is a visual medium - not like a novel. This being said, I was surprised that Burton was more interested in a version with a story than the fragmented original, although this may not have been his decision alone. The result, however, works. There is just enough of a story to give the characters more of a history and motivation - a feature of Burton's previous film adaptations of ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" - in which characters were given more depth by introducing more of a back story. Yes, as many have pointed out, the film does utilise the monomyth structure as many other recent fantasy epics have - but stories do tend to use it - and this is not the first ""Alice"" adaptation to do so. The film has to be judged on the merits of how it achieves its own goal, and Burton's key is in using his distinctive imagination to give this ""Alice"" and this monomyth its own peculiar feel. Some may miss elements of Carrol's nonsensical wit that are not here, but there is sufficient essence of Carrol in the language of the characters and the confusion Alice faces in dealing with many of them. It must be remembered that much of the plot is derived from ""Through the Looking Glass"" which has more structure than ""Alice in Wonderland"". The story of ""The Jabberwocky"", a poem from ""Through the Looking Glass"" is also used in the plot structure - introducing the key folkloric motif of the special weapon - the Vorpal Sword. The brilliant result of this is in creating a new, surreal version of the monomyth filtered through the sensibilities of Carrol and Burton.
The CGI I is used sparringly and has the weighted feel of Burton's stop motion work, making it feel more real and much warmer than much of the cold, slick CGI of other films. Some say that the 3D was tacked on and not integral, I offer other adjectives: unintruseive and understated. I ddo not want to walk away from a film with my memory focused on the special effects - to me there is a great failing in the characters if this is the case. Burton's brilliant visual quality stands out in every frame of the film - beautifully tonal and detailed. Slightly gothic and with a wonderful technicolour palette.
All actors are outstanding. The CGI characters are voiced to perfection. Wasikowska is a curious and assertive presence without gushing at her surroundings like an Alice from a bad panto adaptation. Depp is a delighfully nuanced, bi-polar Mad Hatter with the right blen of whimsy and psychological damage. Bonham-Carter is a wicked Red Queen, delightfully spoiled and OTT, but also showing the damage that made her a monster. Ann Hathaway is a warm but motivated presence who has done exceelent work in the building of her character. Some find the characters a little cold - I find an emotional honesty rather than the sentimental syrup many expect from family fantasy and Hollywood movies in general.
This is a wonderful fantasy that harkens back to great fantasy films like ""Labrynth"", The Dark Crystal"", ""The Princess Bride"", ""Return to Oz"" and even Disney's earlier animations such as ""Sleeping Beauty"" ""Snow White"" and their original ""Alice in Wonderland"" - that were unafraid to be stylistically bold, slightly wierd, a bit scary, very whimsical and a lot of fun!",1269907200,2,4926,4.747957992998833
3639945,5,B001HN6940,"I recently saw the IMAX 3D version of this film. As usual, Johnny Depp performs with amazing magical skill to his part.  What really stuck me, is Burton's visualization of a number of neurological afflctions in his characters.  As a practicing neurosurgeon, it's hard for me to miss these things.  For example, The Mad Hatter has asymmetric pupils and his eyes are incongurent.  These represent at least two cranial nerve defecits.  The original author, Dodgson, or Lewis Carroll as his pen name, may have suffered from temporal lobe epilepsy or migraine disorder.  His mother, according to the Wikipedia page, died at an early age of meningitis or encephalitis.  Dodgson may have well studied neurologic disorders as a result of his personal experiences.  Tim Burton hit these abnormalities spot on.  Furthermore, did you notice the wierd large skull of the Red Queen?  This is precisely how children suffering from untreated hydrocephalus appear.  I'll have to watch this movie several times to look for more neurologic anomalies.  It definitely adds a new dimension to this wonderful film.

Now, if you're no longer familiar with the fable, you might want to flip through the novel version to help you through.  This movie should be called Alice Returns to Wonderland (at age 19, obviously with amnesia about her journey there as a 7 year old) or simply ALICE, who is still as mouthy and defiant as the novel-protagonist.  But definitely not as cute.

Young children who have never seen the Disney version or read the Disney book will surely be confused by the complicated poetry (stanzas from Lewis Caroll's ""Jabberwocky"" thrown in to assure everyone that a battle with the monstrous Jabberwock is coming up) and other squeeze-ins that don't really seem to make much sense to a young viewer.  Most kids from 3-7 might want to break it down to this question..is the red Queen bad?  There is also a white queen, poorly played by Anne Hathaway.  The white queen tries to make herself appear feminine and ethereal but spoofs with her pretentious swanning around(and what's with the awful Goth lipstick?)  I will say the costuming was superb but the makeup and wigs, just amatuerish.  Even Mad Hatter's orange eyebrows looked glued on.

The movie also gives Johnny Depp, the Mad Hatter (previously a minor though memorable character in the original book), a fleshy and admirable role.  In the original, he's gross in his troll like ugliness with no interest in Alice whatsoever.  In this ""sequel"" he is colourful, attractive and charmingly persuasive of Alice's help..she is after all the 'one' to slay the Jabberwock and return their Queer-dom to the white queen.  True Hollywood style, there's a strange 'attraction' between Hatter and Alice, who has just turned down her a wedding proposal back on Earth.

If I can stretch my interpretation here...one of the later scenes paints Alice as some sort of Joan of Arc venturing to slay the Jabberwock dragon against the Red Queen (who I see as a reference to Queen Elizabeth I).  The white queen dare I say was an allusion to her half-sister Mary Queen of Scots.

On a final note Alice in Wonderland, the original was silly, bizarre but oddly witty.  Tim Burton's rendering of Alice in the Future is as well bizarre but macabre (chopped off human heads floating in the castle moat that Alice has to step on to enter the red queen's castle).  Not to mention LOUD!  Bring ear plugs for the kids.",1269734400,4,2452,4.754137115839243
3639957,3,B001HN6940,"In many ways this is a good movie but is  it  Lewis Carroll's ""Alice""?  Burton has taken some of the characters from Alice and ""Through The Looking Glass"" and stuffed them into this screen play which seems to be constructed from scraps of the books but with a  new and darker view.  The original works were very episodic but Burton has added details  and  more  of a plot in an attempt to make sense out of the original.  The result is a movie that is well done but barely resembles Alice.  However, many of the Alice characters are spectacularly drawn.  The Cheshire Cat is particularly well done as are Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, but the Dormouse seems to have drunk to much caffeine.  Depp's Mad Hatter is well done but is a new  and different  character whose madness seems to be  in his dress and appearance rather than in any disconnect from reality.  Gone are the talking flowers, the Duchess, and  many other parts of Wonderland along with Alice the young girl.  Instead the movie begins with Alice -- who is now 21 rather than 12 -- at a party.  This sequence is too long too boring and a ridiculous attempt to avoid the governess and a bored Alice falling down a rabbit  hole.  The end  of the movie concludes with another 10 minutes of these ridiculous people which does nothing for the film other than extend  it.  But, as bad as this party is it  is trumped by the totally awful dance done by Depp at the end of the movie.  The Jitterbug scene  was scrapped from Wizard of OZ because it would have spoiled the movie -- the Depp Dance Scene should have been scrapped from this one because it really ruined this movie.

 Burton's ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" was very well done and clearly he wanted to meet or  exceed that standard but alas he has fallen short.  Nevertheless this is a  spectacular movie in many ways.  Wonderland is truly a wonder and the various characters very well done.  But Alice In Wonderland it  is not.  It is worth seeing but not worth seeing  again.  It is a 3 star effort at best.",1269648000,,2023,4.426229508196721

More for the teen to senior crowd.  Leave the very little ones at home. The connection between the
characters in Alice's real life and her dream life is apparent throughout the film thanks to the scenes before she falls down the rabbit hole.  It is easy to sympathize with the plight of Alice and the creatures she meets in this ""wonderland"" ruled by the Red Queen.  Their characters are well developed.  It is both gripping and touching to see them work through each challenge as a team.  The action is very exciting.  The settings are beautiful and creative.  An all star cast, including Tim Burton veterans: Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter, Alan Rickman and Timothy Spall make this movie a must see.

3639959,3,B001HN6940,"I was not too excited about the upcoming 3D adaptation - continuation of the classical books by the English Math Professor known to the world as Lewis Carroll about the adventures of a young girl named Alice in the Wonder/Under-land. I consider the best adaptation of the book, the closest to its spirit directed by Jan Svankmajer in 1988. I went to see Alice in Wonderland directed by Tim Burton in 3D because I remembered how wonderful it was to see Avatar few months ago in 3D. The 3D features in Alice are nice addition to the film, and I would never say that the Burton's film is not beautiful, and the Wonderland he creates is not magical and entertaining but I felt that something was missing. I wanted to be amazed, fascinated, to be changed constantly like Alice herself but it did not happen. While watching the film I was thinking, oh, it is so much like The Wizard of Oz for 21st Century - the Good Witch, the Wicked Witch, and the brave girl who returns to the world she visited once and can't forget. Then, during the final battle Alice transforms into a Jean of Arc - like warrior with the magic sword in the shining arms. The story of the grown up Alice that bookends the Wonderland visions seems to be written to make Alice who is not a child but a 19 years old in the film, an inspirational young woman, the early feminist. It's been a long time since I read fabulously twisted Carroll's stories but as far as I remember, their charm is in the captivating words games, in the unexplained and extraordinary strange situations and deliciously absurd characters. It is also in the ability to look on the same event from totally different perspective. Just remember how many times and how suddenly and instantly Alice changes her size and perception of unreal reality. Tim Burton and his screenwriter tried to give some logic and explanation to the world of dreams, fantasy and absurdity. As a result, the film turned into another version of the struggle between good and evil, which closely resembles the story of the girl named Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz. I felt like in the struggle between Tim Burton, a highly creative, imaginative Artist who is at his best while producing the dark visions, and the Disney studio that financed the film, there is no convincing victory. For the film that was made to include the young children as the target audience, Alice is too dark, complex, and scary. For the older viewers open to any complexity coming from the union of Burton and Carroll made in the cinematic haven, the film is strangely dull, slow, and boring. It could be easily described by one simple equation, Barton + Disney = Cheshire cat without a smile. It is really strange because the production values of the film are very high, and the actors enjoy playing weird and creepy characters. It was pleasure to see Johnny Depp as a Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the villainous big-headed Red Queen but I think that Crispin Glover deserves special mention as the Knave of Hearts, the personal assassin to the Red Queen and her confidant.

I don't regret seeing Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland at the theater but next time I want to see the cinematic equivalent of the Carroll's book, I'd pull from the shelf DVD Jan Svankmajer's Alice which is still my favorite Carroll's adaptation",1269216000,,3312,4.63265306122449
3639960,1,B001HN6940,"I have always love ""Alice in Wonderland"" and newer nonsense like ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" & ""Brazil"".

""Alice in Wonderland"" is a wonderful book, influential in my formative years, I saw the Disney version and read the book, first in college. Lewis Carroll (Charles Dodgson) was a Mathematician and Logic Professor at Oxford. The girl on whom ""Alice"" was based was an inquisitive, sweet young child, Alice Liddell. The greatest thing about this book was it is nonsense. Carroll plays clever but logically consistent nonsense word games throughout. It prepared me for a world which should be logical and rational but seldom is and is often laughable nonsense. Think of an America president going to war, searching everywhere for nonexistent weapons of mass destruction while ignoring the real threats to America. Nonsense and silly logic abound.

Tim Burton destroys the basic nonsense premise of the book wherein Alice is the only one asking logical questions and the other characters respond with silly nonsense. This movie starts with Alice, a willful teen whose major act of defiance is refusing to wear a corset. (When John Tenniel did etchings for the early Alice editions, he sometimes substituted a girl that looked more like the teen in this movie.) Burton has supplied us with rational explanations at every turn. Tweeledum and Tweeledee are the wonderland equivalent of annoying teen girls above. Everyone in Wonderland has an analogue in the real world. Alice is being pushed into an unwanted marriage with the Upperclass Twit of the Year, no chin and bright red hair. So she escapes from this pressure down the rabbit hole into Wonderland.

In Wonderland, all of the characters, and I do mean all, are dumbed-down into Friends of Alice (FOA) and Enemies of Alice (EOA). Alice in Wonderland is turned into the equivalent of a car chase movie. Instead of the nonsense all of the characters of the book, there is a plot - the evil oppressor Queen of Hearts (Helena Bonham Carter) and her henchmen want to kill Alice (EOA) and the March Hare, Mad Hatter, Dormouse, Smoking Caterpillar and Cheshire Cat (FOA) want to help Alice into being a lib Wonderland superhero. This dumbing-down doubtless makes the movie clearer for Little Johnny and Little Suzie, so they can understand these black and white/good guys and bad guys, but it destroys the essence of Carroll's original. Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter has a bit of the clever Carroll word play (but even his part is over-explained and rationalized). He and lead Helena Bonham Carter have the only real acting parts in this movie. She puts her feet up on a pig to rest them! I'm surprised the Walrus and the Carpenter didn't' choose sides. One of my favorite nonsense poems, the Jabberwocky, is similarly forced to choose sides with Alice the hero in armor! I searched in vain for an interesting character and the only one was the ""evaporating"" toothy Cheshire Cat.

Why do movie producers insist on overlaying contemporary values on historical fiction?  The rationalized end of this movie is a cloyingly formulaic, Victorian feminist, coming-of-age wish-fulfillment. The end of the movie (which I won't reveal) is so bad, so lib, it made me want to gag.

 Is this the future of movies, dumbed down 3D predisgested pablum? Why waste all this acting and animation talent on a ludicrously bad screenplay?

Hey, just trying to save your money!

If you want to see a much better feminist coming-of-age movie, try ""An Education"" or ""Young Victoria""; a better cartoon-ish movie with a much better plot and more believable fleshed out characters ""The Princess and the Frog""; or a better ""Alice in Wonderland, try Disney (or any other version ever made).",1269216000,36,3706,4.974151857835218

These mournful words could just as easily be attributed to the bewildered moviegoer who has shelled out good money for Tim Burton's spectacle-without-substance sequel to that same Carroll classic. As the credits roll and the truth settles in, it is the advice of the wily Cheshire Cat in Holden's book that haunts with its greater truth:

I just looked back over the spreadsheet, after sorting by director and year. With the inclusion of Alice in Wonderland, I have seen, reviewed, and rated ten Tim Burton-directed films. (Two others, Batman Returns and Mars Attacks!, I've seen, but don't remember enough about to rate. I plan to go back and rewatch them eventually.) I was initially kind of surprised at the average rating, which is pretty low, but when it comes right down to it, the best ""Tim Burton"" movie ever made was not actually directed by Burton (Henry Selick's The Nightmare Before Christmas, on which Burton served as a producer). And his recent outings have fared pretty miserably with me, with the exception of The Corpse Bride. I don't think it's a case, as was hypothesized on The Rotten Tomatoes Show, of the public (in this case, me) getting tired of Burton's same old visual tricks. No, when I look a little further into this, I see a pattern, and the Corpse Bride exception noted above may have already tipped you off to it: in every case but one on my spreadsheet, the higher-rated movies are Burton originals, and the lower-rated movies are adaptations. (The sole exception is Burton's first Batman film.) And in that regard, Alice in Wonderland is my favorite Burton adaptation since that first Batman movie over twenty years ago, but I still don't think it measures up to Burton classics like Beetlejuice and Ed Wood.

Alice in Wonderland gives us, in essence, a sequel to the story we're all used to from countless other films based on Carroll; in this one, Alice (Skin's Mia Wasikowska) is nineteen and believes her childhood trip to Wonderland was a dream. On the verge of becoming engaged to Hamish (Kinky Boots' Leo Bill), Alice, who has ever strained against Victorian conformity, runs off following a hare in a waistcoat. Then down the rabbit hole, &c., &c., and back to the world that she believes to be in her dreams. She hooks up with the usual suspects, including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), and is told of her true destiny: the kingdom is dying under the reign of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and her pet enforcer, the Jabberwocky (voice of Christopher Lee). The Hatter and his rebel pals want to see the White Queen (Brokeback Mountain's Anne Hathaway) reinstalled on the throne, and it has been foretold that only Alice can defeat the jabberwocky in battle. But first, she has to get the Vorpal Sword, which is in the possession of the Red Queen...

what a cast Burton assembled for this spectacle. Aside form the abovementioned, Marton Csokas, Timothy Spall, Crispin Glover, Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, and Imelda Staunton, among many others. And the casting is right in line with Burton's oft-mentioned, sometimes-criticized method of filmmaking, which is ""throw as much spectacle at the screen as possible and have the audience hang on for the ride."" Too often, the spectacle is used as a cover for the boringness of the plot, the entire lack of plot, or Burton's odd inability to actually present a compelling case for the adaptation/remake/what-have-you in question. After seeing early reviews for Alice in Wonderland, I expected the same sort of thing here, but I didn't get it; there's actually more of a plot to this than there was to Burton's pale, boring Sweeney Todd, and that plot is more coherent than it was in his confusing, silly Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Which pretty much by default makes it his best adaptation in the past decade. (I refuse to watch Big Fish; every bad actor gets one good film, and Ewan MacGregor, who is a terrible actor, got his with Little Voice.) Still, many of the criticisms levelled at the movie are well warranted. Wasikowska is a stunning lass, to be sure, but her portrayal of Alice is rather wooden. (And, much to the disappointment of quite a few people in my party, she spends a great deal of time falling out of her clothing, but never gets naked.) In reflection, though, it should be no surprise that Depp and Carter steal the show; the two of them have been thick as thieves with Burton for years now. Who's going to be allowed to yank the spotlight away? Which makes the wooden-ness of Wasikowska's portrayal a minor thing, really; think of this as an ensemble piece and it will be less noticeable. The spectacle is in place, Depp and Carter are in fine form, and there are many, many worse ways to spend a couple of hours in a darkened theater.

Which would be a perfect place to end this review, but I feel compelled to mention that if you're looking for a visual-spectacle version of Alice where acting is less important than visuals, it's been done before, and better, and is available through your DVD-by-mail rental subscription, whichever one you may have (I know Netflix, BBO, and GreenCine all have copies)--Alice, Jan Svankmajer's superlative 1988 film. I haven't seen it recently enough to be able to point out specific places where Burton's film parallels it, but I remember enough of it, in that vague sort of way, to see how Burton is at least aware of Svankmajer's film and is paying homage to it with some of his choices here. If you saw Burton's film and were less than impressed, see Svankmajer's. Or even if you loved Burton's film, see Svankmajer's. ***",1268697600,7,5286,4.754901960784314

When it works, it works well, and some of the casting, especially of Depp and Hathaway, was inspired.

The story is, as usual, a blend of the two books, with the added re-entrant twist that an adult Alice is returning to Wonderland/Underland. The special effects are well done, although I hated the enlarged head that Burton gave to Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen. She is a beautiful, classically-trained actress and the absurd distortion serves only to irritate and distract.

The final Joan of Arc-style battle against the Jabberwock at least lifts the movie towards the end, before shambling back into the sterile, over-stereotyped garden party.

For me, it fell well short of what it should have been, despite some solid performances. If you are going to effectively rewrite/extend the Alice saga, what is the point in stopping short of REALLY rebuilding the story arc, and taking it onto another level?

3639966,4,B001HN6940,"I saw Alice in Wonderland opening weekend along with my family. We all enjoyed it very much.  My two kids are 10 and 11. I read the first book as a kid and enjoyed the fantasy aspect of the story.  As a kid the book was intriguing because it really made no sense. I have never read the second book ""Through the Looking Glass"".  I have seen several movie adaptations of the story and have read about the origins of both books.

Having said all that I found Tim Burton's version very entertaining and interesting. As many viewers have correctly said this version is a mixture of the two books in both the story and the characters.  I have no problem with that because the movie did have a feeling of fantasy like the book did but with a more cohesive plot.  I think a plot was somewhat necessary for a movie adaptation.

The movie was well produced and had the feel of a full length movie and not a TV movie.  As the movie progressed I felt like I began to see the Wonderland through Alice's eyes.  Her mental dilusion was simple.  Am I dreaming or is this real? This mental conflict of Alice unfolded as the movie progressed. Despite using fantasy for a backdrop,  Tim Burton did a clever job of overlaying it with drama, suspense, and humor.  I think that is his niche in movie making. The acting was excellent.  I do not think any of the characters were overdone.

I also would like to say that I do not understand why every time ""Burton"" makes a movie someone describes it as ""dark"".  This movie was not ""dark"".  The ending speaks for itself.

I have long ago learned that books don't translate well to movies and expectations of readers differ, so I never go to a movie expecting to watch the book...so to speak.

It's an amazing fantasy film the might not suit a younger crowd, but the adults in the movie theater loved it. Don't let the Disney tag fool you, because it's not a typical Disney film with head cut off floating in the Red Queens Moat.

3639968,4,B001HN6940,"I really enjoyed it!  There were all ages at the theater.  It was a very nicely put together combination of people and creatures. (I think you call it animatronics?)  While I remember the basic Alice story from years ago, I don't necessarily remember all the fine details to compare it to the original.

The story begins with several businessmen discussing possible ventures when little Alice comes downstairs.  Daddy says, ""Another nightmare?""  Alice affirms and daddy takes her back upstairs and tucks her back into bed after another dream of strange creatures with funny names.

Fast forward 13 years.  Alice and Mom are traveling through the English Countryside.  Daddy has passed on to ""the other side"".  They are going to visit one of the business partners who also bought Daddy's share of the business.  Arriving at the partner's beautiful English country estate, Alice is paired up with their son Hamish and soon finds out that Hamish will ask for her hand.  Now, let me side step here for a minute.  Alice doesn't exactly seem all that thrilled with Hamish but he is breathing without assistance and the family has money.  Well-meaning relatives quickly point out, ""Your face won't last forever,"" which translates to ""you had better grab some guy before you get ugly and nuts like Aunt xxxx.""

While all this dialog business is going on, Alice keeps seeing a white rabbit in a topcoat with a stop watch. Hmmmm.  Finally, Hamish asks for Alice's hand in front of the whole gathering but she hesitates.  Thinking, ""Do I REALLY wanna do this?"" she spots the white rabbit again.  He is pointing to his stopwatch, indicating there is not much time left.  Alice excuses herself and runs off to follow the rabbit that no one sees but her.

Alice soon falls down a hole. Down, down, down - landing in a locked circular room.  The key on the table isn't helping because it only unlocks a small doggie-sized door.  She finds some potion to drink that makes her small, and a cake to eat that makes her big.  You hear a male and female voice talking in the background saying, ""You'd think she'd remember all this from the first time.""  She gets through the door and finds herself in a strange garden where a blue caterpillar is smoking a hooka pipe.  He is the ""wisdom"" guy.  As Alice meets the Cheshire Cat, the Mad Hatter, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum, and other characters, there is discussion as to whether or not she is the RIGHT Alice.  A  mean-looking polar bear type creature chases her and her friends, as does a mean buzzard.  The mean creatures all belong to the Red Queen, as does the  ""Jabberberrywalkie"" (a dragon).  The Queen likes to behead anything and anyone who displeases her.  She has a frog beheaded for eating her fruit tart.  Every other word out of her mouth is ""off with his/her head!""  (Fortunately, you don't see them beheaded.)

Once upon a time, the land was beautiful, but the Red Queen, her warriors, and the mean creatures raged war and the dragon fried what was left of the land.  The ""prophecy"" was that Alice would return and slay the dragon, but this Alice is a peace-nic.

We also meet the White Queen, who is the nice one.  Alice is actually supposed to steal this special sword, return it to the White Queen, become her Champion in the battle against the Red Queen, and then slay the dragon.  Oh, BTW, the Queens are sisters.

I found the movie quite enjoyable.  Johnny Depp was absolutely wonderful, as always.  It amazes me how he made his character come alive!  He is very talented and was the real star of the movie.

This is a nice story about facing fears, transformation, friendship, and about a young woman who is stronger than she thought she was.  There is also an underlying message to Alice that she is not a girl who has to take the first guy who comes along, especially when she has no special feelings for him.

Is it for young children?  I think it's iffy.  This is not really a children's movie anyway.  It is an adaptation of one for adults. It's not bad, but you do have the concept of beheading people/charachters and the dragon shooting out fire.  You also have the 2 monsters, one getting his eye plucked out with a sword.  You see an almost beheading of a person and a monster gets his head chopped off.  It might give your children nightmares, so, be careful.  They may not be as unaffected as you think.  I say this because I made the same mistake with my son.  He told me about how it affected him many years later.

3639970,3,B001HN6940,"I've always liked Tim Burton's work for the most part. I've come to recognize over the years that his movies are either very,very good or they seem to be ""by the book"" & lack the imagination that some of his other films have. Sadly, this film is one of those that seem to have been typical ""paint by numbers"" Burton.

This film is half sequel, half re-imagining of the Alice in Wonderland story. Alice has grown to womanhood & on the day of a garden party she discovers that she is going to receive a proposal from a pompous & humorless suitor she has no love for. Bolting from the scene of the proposal, Alice follows a white rabbit down a hole & finds herself in Underland- a land she's been to before. With the help of an assorted cast of characters including the Mad Hatter, Alice must defeat the Jabberwocky & restore the rightful queen of Underland to the throne.

I really wanted to like this movie. However everyone I'd spoken to about it said the same thing. ""The visuals are BEAUTIFUL but the story isn't all that great."" I have to agree with that. If Burton had spent as much time on the story as he did on the visuals, this would have been far better. When the film has Alice wandering around Underland or in the Red Queen's castle, the film is fantastic. Unfortunately those scenes only make up about a third or a half of the film, with the rest of the film feeling vaguely tedious. (My mother got up partway through the film, came back & felt like she barely missed a thing.) The story is barely there & I kind of wished that the film had been at least 15 minutes shorter. A friend of mine said that Burton is starting to become the ""Michael Bay of special effects & gothy, candy colors"". I almost gave him a black eye for saying Burton & Michael Bay in the same sentence, but after watching this I can't help but think that there's a little something to what he said.

Acting-wise, the film is ""ok"". Helena Bonham & Crispin Glover are the two best parts of the film, to be honest. They go through their roles with sadistic glee & its at those moments that I really enjoyed the film the most. Then there's Johnny Depp. I love Johnny Depp, but quite frankly... this wasn't his best role. He was basically Jack Sparrow playing the Mad Hatter. He was fine enough for the most part, but I couldn't help but think that perhaps someone else would have done a better job. (I actually kind of thought that it would have been better if Glover & Depp had swapped roles, although that would have deprived me of watching Glover as the Knave of Hearts.)

The film is ok. That's really the best I can say for it. The good thing about Tim Burton is that even when he's at his worst, he's still pretty darn entertaining. Now don't worry. This isn't nearly as bad as 'Planet of the Apes' or 'Cabin Boy' (yep, he made that stinker). Well, not until Johnny Depp does his dance. That was absolutely the stupidest thing I'd ever seen & I kept silently hoping that something- ANYTHING would cut his legs off so he would be incapable of torturing the audience with that awful dance of his. (Seriously, I'd rather 'The Hottie & The Nottie' than see that dance again.)

Long story short: this film is more about visuals than story. If that's your cup of tea, you'll love this film. I can only hope that with Burton's next film- an adaptation of 'Dark Shadows', he brings back some of the Burton charm. This movie is just a pale shadow of what Burton can really do.",1268524800,12,3453,4.355590062111801

My favorites need not have worried. This movie offers fair adventure, a young heroine rising to heroic demands, a modern bit of rebellion against Victorian constraints, and delighfully bizarre fantasy. It just doesn't offer Alice as we knew her. Instead, Burton let Alice grow up, then placed her within a sequel to Lewis Carroll's originals. I always have reservations about modern writers collaborating posthumously with others no longer able to defend their work - and this just helps solidify that distrust.

So, this movie presents an effect-filled romp, with some novel effects that I expect to see more of. It brings a modern rewriting to straight-jacketed Victorian sexism. It splashes the screen with amazing visuals (even in 2D). It just isn't Alice. Therein lies my disappointment.

3639972,3,B001HN6940,"19 year old Alice (Mia Wasikowska) returns to the magical Wonderland from when she was young and meets some old friends, and learns of her destiny.. to overthrow the evil Red Queen, sister to the good White Queen (Anne Hathaway).

I rather enjoyed it. Dark and weird, but it's really a sequel in feel, so why call it Alice in Wonderland? Return to Wonderland would have been an more apt title. Although that is probably too similar to Return to Oz...

Whereas the Disney Wonderland felt bright, surreal and colourful, this film had a very muted colour pallette even in the ""real"" world and Tim Burton's Wonderland had a kind of run-down, almost post apocolyptic feel. I pictured Alice being about 10 years old in the novel and 1951 Disney adaptation.

In that sense, by making this film a kind of sequel with Alice now in her late teens, maybe the broken, dark Wonderland becomes a metaphor for lost innocence and childhood itself, and how one's perception of childhood changes as you get older, which I think is actually quite clever.

I felt the 2 bookending parts of the film were boring (in the opening, we learn Alice is getting married to a slimy suitor) and I didn't feel for those characters.

Mia Wasikowska gave a good performance playing Alice as she was more independent and resourceful than I remember, surely ahead of her time!

I did like Helena Bonham Carter's turn as the Red Queen a lot - even though, talking with a high pitched, childish lisp, she reminded me of Miranda Richardson's Queenie in Blackadder II! In fact, she ripped off that interpretation wholesale. But still very funny.

Stephen Fry was excellent and probably gave the best ""performance"" of the cast as the Cheshire Cat but he was criminally underused I felt. Alan Rickman had just the right kind of stately voice of the Cattepillar.

In order to bring peace to Wonderland, Alice must slay the monster known as the Jabberwocky (I don't remember this Harry Potter type battle from the novel), which seemed shoehorned in to give the film some more structure and narrative and give the older, supposedly more resourceful Alice a mission, which The Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) helps her with. His performance is a strange one - wearing lots of make up and adopting an occasional Scottish accent, there may be some sadness as well as madness in his air because he and the other characters have been waiting up to 13 years for Alice to come back.
However, in one scene the Hatter does a Michael Jackson inspired dance for no apparent reason, which I found cringeworthy.

The suggestion through the film that Wonderland may actually be real (with Alice often questioning her surroundings) reminded me of themes explored in Pan's Labyrinth and The Chronicles of Narnia. In my opinion this gave the film a darker edge and made it more appealing to adults and older children.",1268438400,66,2849,4.751012145748988
3639973,5,B001HN6940,"Alice in Wonderland meets The Lord of the Rings! Alice meets Frodo Baggins! Madness meets magic! Tim Burton has lost none of his muchness. If only the Blue Caterpillar had given up his habit.

Delightfully madcap performances by Johnny Depp and by Helena Bonham Carter lived up to their advance billing. Anne Hathaway was ditzily gorgeous as the White Queen. The acting of established pros, however, only framed the charming strength of newcomer Mia Wasikowska. Wisftul and willful, soft-spoken and fierce, she was captivating as the child-woman of Burton's revisionist tale. No Oscars for special-effects films, as Avatar taught us, but Mia's day will come.

I watched the movie in 3D, but it would not lose as much on flatscreen as Avatar would. Alice's sets, alternately whimsical and nightmarish, would be wonderful in any dimension. As for Danny Elfman's majestic score, reminescent of Howard Shore's in LOTR, it deserves to be heard on its own.

My immediate reaction after just seeing this is been-there-done-that, but I vaguely recall it being a way cooler trip. Why is that?

The highlight for me was Johnny Depp yet again perfectly transformed and fully immersed in another character, except for the ultra-goofy ""dance"" which was maybe the worst, most cringe inducing thing in the whole movie. But what an actor! He even came up with the look of his Mad Hatter. Perfect.

The biggest failure of this film -I'd agree with Roger Ebert- is the big, dumb, loud and boring unnecessary third act battle.

But I found this movie in general just really *odd*. It's a story about an upper class English girl from stuffy aristocratic society, this time in her late teens, hanging out with a bunch of weirdos, as director Tim Burton put it. Well Burton said ""brat"" hanging with a bunch of weirdos is basically the depth to which the story has been brought to the screen before, but here Alice seems like a pretty cool, independently minded chick ahead of her time. In fact the Burton version is basically a ""you-go-girl"" fable about following your bliss (literally following your dreams in this case) and having the courage to be yourself...

It felt familiar but wasn't what I expected at the same time and the story didn't truly hold my interest and exactly why I can't put my finger on. Combination of things. Burton's attempt to add a tad more depth to these dream creatures and this being Alice's second trip down the rabbit hole? The pacing of events and subplots? I don't recall the Disney cartoon so much or the original Lewis Carrol story at all but there were details in this version that were weird. Members of The Red Queen's court and the intrigues, the Knave of Hearts, just the look of some of these characters and the castle were creepy, but not in a good way to me. This movie will give many kids some weird dreams by the way.
The special effects were OK but for a person not too big on cgi I was again underwhelmed. Props on The Cheshire Cat tho... I dug that. To be sure there were some moments. I went in with an open mind towards the cgi and the 3-D and I gotta say I think 3-D is overall just lame. It strikes me as mostly a gimmick and the visuals will look more vibrant and colorful in good ole 2-dimension in your home on Blue Ray. (Although I want to add as a side note the preview for a 3-D documentary of the mission to repair to Hubble Telescope was incredible!!)

3639986,4,B001HN6940,"Knowing that the actual story of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass are just weird stories to begin with (there's a caterpillar that is getting high and a cat that can disappear and that has a smile that stretches from ear to ear...literally), I always thought that Tim Burton would just be perfect as the director of a movie version.  So, when I heard that this was actually coming true, of course I would have to go see it.

Sure, it was weird.  It seemed even weirder than any other Burton movie that I have seen (and I've seen a lot), but I think that had to do with the weirdness of the storyline combined with the weirdness of Burton.

This particular version follows 19-year-old Alice (Mia Wasikowska) as she returns to Underland (or Wonderland, as she called it when she was there the first time, at just 6-years-old).  That's an important thing to remember.  She has been there before and all of the characters have been waiting 13 years for her to come back down the rabbit hole and help to save Underland from the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Club/dp/B0007DFJ0G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Club</a>), who is the over-sized-headed evil sister of the White Queen (Anne Hathaway&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rachel-Getting-Married/dp/B001E95ZNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rachel Getting Married</a>).

Depp's makeup got some getting used to.  I found myself staring at his long, orange eyebrows more often than not.  I just really wanted to trim them.  But, once I pushed the old Disney version out of my mind, I found that I was able to enjoy it...with the one small exception of the character of Alice.  The girl in this movie just seemed so depressed and clueless and just *bleh* the entire time.  She talked about imagining the impossible and how she believed things could happen that other people didn't believe.  If that was the case, why did it take her about 4/5 of the movie before she finally accepted the fact that it wasn't just a dream?  I would've realized it the moment this weird creature almost sliced my arm off.  But, looking past the annoying main character's complete lack of excitement of being someplace like Underland/Wonderland/whatever you feel like calling it, I really enjoyed the movie.

I say that if you still aren't sure if you will like it, don't see it in 3D.  Just pay the normal 2D price, like I did.  That way, if you don't like it, then you didn't spend $12, instead you spent $6-7 (in my area, at least...but you get the point).  But, if you do end up liking it, then you can go back and see it in 3D, if you feel so inclined...like I do.  :-)",1268092800,2,3206,5.410462776659959
3639987,4,B001HN6940,"Ever since the first film version back in 1903, Lewis Carroll's classic surrealist tale, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, has provided fodder for many a film studio.  While these films all have their charms, they do tend to be tough going for some viewers.  Part of this stems from the fact that the original story is very episodic.  The titular heroine basically jumps from meeting one weird character to the next with no real growth until she wakes up from her ""dream.""  The other obstacle is the fact that Alice can sometimes come across as insufferable prig!!!  In an attempt to address these problems, Tim Burton tried not to recreate the novel itself, but to fashion a sequel of sorts featuring a now 19 year old Alice.  When she gets a marriage proposal from an insipid lord at a ""surprise"" engagement party., she sees a very familiar White Rabbit nearby.  She escapes the party and chases the Rabbit to the usual rabbit hole and falls into a new adventure where she not only must help her old acquaintances, but discover herself as well.

As always, Burton has a dark sensibility that actually works with the subject material and the art direction of this film is nothing short of spectacular.  This sensitivity also extends to the varied residents as well.  Danny Elfman provides a wonderfully quirky score to match the mood.  Mia Wasikowska makes for a lovely Alice.  However, it takes her about a quarter of the film before she really becomes likable. Still, she does help ground the film with an otherwise solid performance.  Johnny Depp is always interesting to watch, and his daft Mad Hatter is no exception here.  Unfortunately, his performance is not quite on a par of such more recent roles like Sweeney Todd or Capt. Jack Sparrow.  Part of that stems from the Scottish accent in his more serious moments that seems more like a gimmick than real emotion.  Ann Hathaway's spacey White Queen doesn't fare much better.  More fun is the voice work of British comedian Stephen Fry who is a delightfully suave Cheshire Cat.  Alan Rickman and Christopher Lee do solid work as the a hookah smoking caterpillar and  the Jabberwocky respectively.  However, it is Helena Bonham Carter who steals the show with her wild over-the-top turn as the wicked Red Queen.

The film goes at a rather leisurely pace that definitely picks up as you take in the delightful visuals.  The story starts out quite promising, but it does end with a climax that is very derivative. Despite all that, there is much to recommend for this version.  Diehard Carroll fans might howl at the liberties taken with this ""sequel"" but this is still a film worth seeing and recommending.",1268006400,3,2649,4.7736263736263735

3639990,3,B001HN6940,"For me, Tim Burton has always been more miss than hit.  For every excellent effort (ED WOOD, SWEENEY TODD) there seem to be several misfires (SLEEPY HOLLOW, CORPSE BRIDE, BIG FISH.)  Unfortunately, ALICE IN WONDERLAND is mostly a miss for me.  I looked very much forward to his twisted vision, as the ALICE books were insane mash-ups of verbal nonsense and visual oddness (thanks to the classic illustrations from Teniel.)

Burton's film is full of some stunning visuals, most bearing no resemblance to the illustrations...but I'm okay with that.  Burton and his collaborators have re-imagined the look for Wonderland, and that's actually a perfectly valid approach.  Plenty of other ALICE films have tried to hew more closely to the look of the original books.  But what I didn't like was the story Burton chose to tell.

ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS are very difficult to handle cinematically, because they don't really tell a cohesive story.  Yes, there is the barest filament of a plot...but it's mostly a string of incidents as Alice meets weird creatures who tell strange and often nonsensical stories.  (There's a reason Jefferson Airplane wrote the song ""White Rabbit."")  So I can understand that Burton and crew wanted to force a real plot for all these familiar characters to enact.  However, I think Burton made two mistakes that resulted in one big problem.

Mistake #1 was to set the story later in the life of Alice, so that she's a young lady on the verge of being engaged to a man very much not right for her...instead of a young girl.  It makes sense that a young girl could observe the insanity of wonderland and accept it all.  Rabbits that talk?  Sure, no problem.  A giant caterpillar smoking a hookah?  Yep.  Living playing cards?  Fun!  But as a 19 year old young lady, who is clearly intelligent...wouldn't you at least expect some raised eyebrows?  Granted, the Alice we meet is a curious & imaginative person...but she still seems to have little trouble drinking one potion to shrink and nibbling on something else to grow without giving it a thought.

Mistake #2 was to focus on the politics of Wonderland (actually, in this film, it is called Underland, sadly).  We get this story of the evil Red Queen and the virtuous White Queen, and how their animosity has affected the citizens of the land.  The poor creatures are suffering under the yolk of the bad queen.  It smelled just a little too much like Narnia to me (without the religious overtones).

The net effect of these two mistakes was to sap the film of any real sense of wonder.  I ADMIRED much of the visual look:  Tweedledum & Tweedledee were suitably creepy/funny.  The life-size playing cards / soldiers were well-rendered.  Helena Bonham Carter was a visual marvel as the Red Queen.  But I wasn't swept away.  I didn't feel transported to a new world, I felt invited to a viewing of a really cool set and some nifty CGI.  Wonderland didn't feel REAL, and the story didn't feel compelling.

Mia Wasikowska made for a very striking Alice.  Even though I disagreed with making her a ""grown up,"" I can't fault the actress for that.  She plays her underwritten, one-dimensional role as well as possible.  (I'll say right now that one of Burton's biggest flaws, to me, is that he seldom creates well-rounded characters...usually just a collection of traits.  Some actors can wrangle those quirks and ticks into a believable person...others cannot.)  I enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen...again, she was seldom asked to do much, but she tore into her role with relish.  A lot of the voice work was very good as well:  Alan Rickman is perfect for the Caterpillar and I always like Stephen Fry (Cheshire Cat.)

Less successful were Crispin Glover as Stayne, the Knave of Hearts.  If ever a character needed to be unhinged, it's Stayne...and usually Glover can deliver unhinged with the best of them.  But he mostly came across as stoic.  Anne Hathaway was bland.  And most disappointing was the usually reliable Johnny Depp.  I'm used to him being the best thing in any Burton movie.  He was flat-out brilliant as Ed Wood, full of wonder as Scissorhands and deliciously villainous as Sweeney.  Yet as the Mad-Hatter, he's all over the map.  Burton has tried to take a minor character from the original books, and stretch him into being the conscious of Wonderland...the IDEA of Depp as the Hatter was great, but reinventing the character just to give your star more to do was a mistake.  He's amusing to look at for a few minutes...but his accent jumps around (and worse, he's often unintelligible in his mumblings) and he appears to have a rather odd fixation on Alice.  Is he ""in love"" with the lovely young woman he sees now, or is he ""in love"" with his memory of the 10 year old girl he once met...which is highly creepy, but seems to be the case.

ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a huge disappointment.  Burton is an awkward storyteller but a visual genius.  This time, however, even those skills are found wanting.",1268006400,15,5027,4.75462962962963

She has no memory of having been here before, and all the folk she meets, like the White rabbit, the March Hare, the Doormouse and, of course, the Cheshire Cat and the Mad Hatter, aren't sure she is who she says she is. Well, the Hatter might be, but he's mad.

All those worthys are engaged in a little light rebellion against the Red Queen (played by Helena Bohnam Carter, who appears to be channeling Miranda Richardson's Queen Elizabeth from Black Adder II), who sics the Bandersnatch and Jub Jub bird on anyone who challenges her authority. With the Knave of Hearts by her side, she wages a campaign of tough hate on the people of Wonderland as her sister, the White Queen, does frak-all but wait for Alice to turn up, obtain the Vorpal Blade and go snicker-snack on the Jabberwocky.

If all this sounds a little on the mixed-up side, it is. The only thing we're really missing is an appearance by the Walrus and the Carpenter, and I'm surprised we didn't have them show up.

But despite mixing in just about everything from Lewis Carrol's works, the film isn't muddled and stays surprisingly coherent. It's helped by some great performances (including Johnny Depp as the somewhat restrained Mad Hatter), and an incredible production design that uses some of the old-style illustrations of the characters to make them look very inhuman, particularly the Red Queen and the Tweedles.

At no point was the movie boring and at no point did it fail to entertain. As an adult, I don't recommend seeing it on a Saturday afternoon, like I did, but rather suggest seeing it while all the little kiddies are in school. Also, since the theatre I go to still does not have 3-D capability, I had to see it in 2-D, so I can't say how it would look in the other format.

But, yes, this was a film worth seeing, so kudos to Tim Burton and company! Oh, and for the record... they both have quills.",1267833600,2,2515,4.478165938864628

8309008,3,B001HN6940,"Great price, but disk doesn't have any extras or even a chapter menu (or any menu other than to select captions/language and start the film). Have to fast forward or reverse to reach a specific start point. You can pause, but the only play option is to start disk from the beginning and play straight through.

The 3D is passable as 3D, but nothing special. (LG OLED 65E6P) Some scenes are noticeably flat. Others have good depth. One butterfly popout at the end. Perhaps I'm jaded because of all the eye-popping, amazing 3D blu rays available, but the 3D seemed underwhelming.

4 stars for the fun movie. 3 stars for the 3D.",1526428800,,625,4.571428571428571

Overacted, aggressively loud, stupid special effects without which, so Disney seems to think, no American viewer could possibly enjoy anything.
