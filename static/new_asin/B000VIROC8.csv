8218957,5,B000VIROC8,"This DVD shows you exactly what tools you need to start creating your own low-cost, high-value DVDs.  It's amazing how easy it is to create a simple home video ""studio"" using what Bill covers in this DVD.

I use the term ""studio"" loosely because it's really just a few of the right tools setup in the right way.  But in the end, you'll be able to create videos that look and sound like professional productions with little effort.

Bill makes all of this easy to understand in this DVD and offers you tips on which tools to buy, how to set things up so that creating your videos is easier and how to create a professional looking set using just a few simple tricks and a spare bedroom or office.

This DVD along with his other products helped me create my own DVD products so I don't think you can go wrong with this disc if you're looking for a fast way to learn the basic tools needed to create great how-to DVDs.",1214179200,,915,4.265895953757226
