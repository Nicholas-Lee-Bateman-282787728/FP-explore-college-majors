8501576,4,B00004RLO8,"No, it's not in the same league as, say, ""The Breakfast Club."" But, I've always liked this movie for its heart. There is some senseless nudity. My favorite scenes, however, are the scenes between Sue (Kristy Swanson) and Alvin (Sasha Jenson). They are cute together. I've only seen Sasha Jenson in one other movie. It's a pity - I really liked him in this. Alvin is a lovable nerd. It had been a while since I'd seen it; it was good to see it again.",1237248000,4,449,4.294117647058823
8501577,5,B00004RLO8,"Finally available on Amazon, albeit only as a used VHS (somebody Please issue a DVD!!) is Dream Trap, which just may be the sexiest movie of all time.

  A supernaturally-tinged romantic comedy/fantasy, ""Dream Trap"" is a rarity in movies in that it's almost totally devoid of villains or 'meanness'.  I'm not saying every movie should be like that, certainly (I'm a huge horror movie fan myself) but it's a refreshing change and allows the sexuality, the romance and the humor of the movie to shine forth completely free.  There are a couple of 'jerks' in the movie, but they're basically on a level with Reggie Mantle from Archie Comics - they're humorous, mostly harmless jerks.  I was briefly afraid the movie was going to stray into the offensive and very tired realm of so-called 'fat jokes' with the introduction of a heavy female character (the likes of which are all too often brought into comedy movies not to be a Character but to be the basis of a bunch of stupid attempts at really bad humor) but such fears were unfounded.  While there are jokes involving the character they're not really that different from the good-natured humor that permeates the whole movie, and the character adds to the movie by being just another part of the group, not an object of ridicule like in too many 'comedies'.  It might have been nice if the filmmakers had hooked her up with a boyfriend or something, but a lot of the characters don't end up as part of a couple anyway.

  The premise is simple but wonderful: two shy, bookwormish students new to a college (the female of the pair played by Kristy Swanson) end up in one another's dreams and sharing a telepathic romance.  There are all kinds of hi-jinks amongst the various characters and jaw-droppingly beautiful exposure.  Although most of it is of heavenly girls (which I certainly have no problem with) ""Dream Trap"" also provides some exposure involving guys for the benefit of female viewers.  There's a bumbling principal trying to get to the bottom of all the harmless antics who actually comes off very likable whereas in other movies he'd most likely seem like a meddlesome shmuck, there's a couple of wide-eyed younger kids who seem to feel very fortunate just to live in the same neighborhood as a campus where the female student body's wardrobe (or, often, relative lack thereof) is such as it is, and a very strong and bright 'believe in love' type of message.  Many comedies have promised to be this sexy, very few have succeeded.  Even fewer have tried to blend it with such an overall positive and romantic vibe, let alone succeeded.  Did I already mention that we Really need for someone to put this out on DVD?

Beyond a ten out of ten.",1140998400,7,2705,4.694915254237288
