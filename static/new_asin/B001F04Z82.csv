The film is easy to watch and has a great message.",1232064000,4,140,4.423076923076923
3558688,3,B001F04Z82,"I thought the acting was excellent.  Very natural, looked like real people to me and very convincing.  Wayne's talking got a bit long in places.  The point came across, but I thought this is too simple.  The advice is easy it's putting it into real life that is the work.  Knowing when to flow and when to assert, knowing when you're being selfish and when you are preserving your inner being in a healthy way.

I don't resonate with his use of God, it stills feels dualistic to me as if God is seperate from the ego and only in the flow, for me God is all there is and that includes when we use our ego and when we use our higher self. It kind of misses the point of the Tao to use dualistic terms I think. I prefer to use other terms and leave God out of it, but that's just me.

I kept watching the movie to find out the stories of the characters, and I thought the janitor had the most to offer as far as wisdom.

I think this type of movie is needed to balance out hollywood's influence, but we all know that it's still only one way of looking at the world through a very small lense and to apply it to real life will be a lot more complex and different for each individual.",1231891200,34,1179,4.030042918454936
3558689,5,B001F04Z82,"I think Hay House did it again and put out another meaningful movie. I enjoyed every minute of it. Don't buy this movie for great acting but for the message. It is a message I have heard Dr. Dyer talk about before but the scenery is lovely and I believe he gets his point across. I think it is a message you can never hear enough. Ambition to Meaning will be a movie like ""You Can Heal Your Life"" which I will watch many times over. If you are a Dr. Dyer fan or a Hay House fan I don't think you will be disappointed.",1231804800,25,517,3.933333333333333

3558693,3,B001F04Z82,"Although this movie is extremly well done, I also enjoyed it under its ""other"" title, ""The Shift"" by the same author, stars, etc. - It is THE SAME MOVIE. Having ejoyed 'The Shift' when it was on loan from a friend in its short version (i.e., not Deluxe), I decided to purchase it for myself in the Deluxe Edition and was pleasantly suprised to find, what I believed to be, 'another in the series', and purchased Ambition to Meaning. Sadly, it was the later that I recieved first, only to find out, that I had actually purchased another copy of 'The Shift' as it was originally marketed - disappointing! Unfortunately, had I received my copy of 'The Shift' first, perhaps I would have noticed the fine print stating: ""Formerly titled 'AMBITION TO MEANING' This should be more obviously stated with the product description (if included at all.)",1283385600,4,842,4.73469387755102
3558694,4,B001F04Z82,"For anyone who ever needed clarfication about what ego can and cannot do for us as individuals, this film will clarify that very well.  Although meant to be a movie, I found it to be more of a documentary with actors presenting how other people's lives and situations can change when we allow them, as human beings, to happen.  The basic premise is that we are all part of the same ""source"" and as such we all have our purpose in life.  The hardest part is figuring out what that purpose is and how to align it with our present situation in life.

By combining philosophical thoughts, human psychology and ancient teaching from China, Dr. Dyer shows us through (fictional) lives of others how we can make or allow a ""shift"" that is necessary to make any person's life easier.  The purpose and meaning of life basically comes to being able to accept the virtues of life as prescribed by the ancient teachers.  And as if nothing is absolute, it is just amazing that teachings from thousands of years ago are still holding up in our today's busy world.

Many seeking self-help and self improvement will find this video helpful.  I found it interesting.  Film definitely reminded me that is it time to re-read a famous ""Tao Te Ching"".",1274486400,,1230,4.579908675799087

3558696,5,B001F04Z82,"Everything I read, listen to, or view from Wayne Dyer has a significant impact on my life!  Ambition to Meaning really made me look at why I have struggled for so long.  I have always wanted to do something meaningful, but have been torn by the need to provide for my family.  This really woke me up to making the shift completely to focusing on meaning.

Thanks Wayne!",1248048000,,369,4.382352941176471
3558697,5,B001F04Z82,"This movie was like taking a retreat for two hours and coming away feeling more centered and excited to continue this journey called ""life"".

Wayne Dyer weaves together a tale around his teachings in this movie about finding our life's purpose through letting our own creation/music out, expressing our lives through spirit rather than ego. Watching this, I was immediately drawn into the place where this was filmed because it is where I am from (living in Austin now, my heart longs for home and the Monterey Bay Area). Its funny to be writing this because its what I understand to be a double entendre that I'm writing about here: the way that Wayne Dyer speaks towards is the path to our home/center, it is where I am most at peace, the place of my own deep longing and the wellspring of inspiration that I love to be tapped into, and strive to be tapped into, full-time! The duality in this is that the latter part of my childhood was spent growing up in Monterey. So here I am watching a movie about letting myself be at home with ""the music still inside me"" (such that I express it) and yet I'm also watching this filmed in a place that truly is home for me, as such it represents all the twists and turns that brought me to this point in time.

Throughout this movie, I couldn't help but write in my journal, a usual thing I do when I am learning from wise teachers (note that a journal isn't required.) I kept pausing and reflecting and then continuing the movie and taking in more. Wayne Dyer drums up deep truths for me. He is masterful in how he isolates and uproots wornout ideas, and subsequently seeds empowered, universal truths in their place. I should give myself a little credit here as I was up for putting in the extra effort to take what he was teaching and apply it as a light to shine into the dark corners of my life. But, he definitely makes it easier as he weaves the audience into his world of letting go and letting God. Its as if I am a building and the structure that was built on ego I've been setting up for demolition (I've been working on this for a while, so I ready for something like this). I've been afraid of what will happen once this building is gone, I've been afraid of letting it completely go. What Wayne Dyer does is remind me that there is a more magnificent building ghosted over the ego one, but for this grand building to exist truly, I need to let go of the ego building.

What came up for me really tied together in an unexpected way. Then hearing the ""owner's"" story in this movie really got me, it was a moment of ""aha!"" The scene with the piano, if you want to understand, you'll have to see the movie. I am going to write this in as honest a way as I possibly can: I vow to move forward from that insightFULL story in the movie remembering to let spirit live my life for me and let go of ego. I have witnessed and learned what my ego behavior is that has gotten in the way in the past, I am reorienting my distortion by watering my plants, staying in the now with what I love to do and who I love to be regardless of expectations, judgment or anything else. I will forget ""my ego self"" for the sake of living the light inside me. I will live my life in service to my higher will and spirit knowing it is where my heart has always been and is therefore safe to be FULL TIME (lol!)

It goes without saying that the movie was really well done--some of the shots were so gorgeous! The actors serve their purpose well, I believe Wayne Dyer does a great job of communicating subtleties that couldn't otherwise be taught except through the audience witnessing these examples of the human experience. If I was recommending this movie for myself, I would say, watch it when you are in the mood for a retreat, to site back and learn, and watch it when you have a level of patience that is beyond just being entertained. I would say watch this movie with an open heart and mind as you would listening to any teacher. I'm considering getting the book too. I always love Wayne Dyer's books and especially his audiobooks because I can listen to them while I ride my bike around Barton Springs in Austin (where I live now after years in NY following my ego, now I am somewhere natural, surrendering my ego driven work for a new daily routine (baby steps) in a much more beautiful place, proud of what I've learned, even all my screw-ups, because it has brought me new understanding, it has brought me to this moment after watching this movie, full of insight...

So, thank you Wayne Dyer for this great movie and thanks for being such an important teacher for me. I really appreciate all you are putting forth into the world, because it has really resonated with me over the years. Thus far, my most important teachers seem to be you, Gail Straub, Pema Chodron and Abraham-Hicks. My teachers are helping me to recognize, reckon with and open up to the wisdom and the creative spirit that is within and all around throughout everything.

I've immediately followed up the movie with wanting to plan a trip ""home"" to commune with nature in Carmel/Monterey letting spirit live through me instead of ego--to go for a walk in Asilomar and witness myself coming home in a deep prayerful and intentional way.

Note: I keep wondering about the guy in the movie's story, who is supposedly the owner of the hotel they are staying at. Is this true? I think he is listed as an actor, just wondering what the facts are or if that is a fictional story to make a point...",1247961600,,5497,4.3623046875
3558698,5,B001F04Z82,"For those who would rather watch a movie than read about the current spiritual ideals being presented today, This is the DVD for you!  Dr. Dyer steps out of his role as writer and lecturer while encouraging others to do the Tao.  Cleverly, he is commissioned by a film crew to state to the world his present teachings.  An attitude shift occurs within the film crew set in a resort-type setting which coincides with other shift changes at the resort.  While the stories were long-winded, you can't escape the messages that emulate Dyer's overall philosophy of personal empowerment which leads to the meaning of ambition.",1244505600,2,620,4.876190476190477
3558699,5,B001F04Z82,"Please note that this is a ""mix"" of a movie with characters that revolve around each other's interactions with Dr. Wayne Dyer mixed in there.  The information he shares is still relevant.  If you are familiar with his work, it is not new, but still refreshing to hear.  I think he did a marvelous job in this DVD.  Quotes stood out, and situations the people were in are familiar roles we all know or have played.  It is a slow format, but if you watch to listen for the messages you will get them.  I hope this review has been helpful.  Namaste.",1244419200,3,546,4.294117647058823
3558700,5,B001F04Z82,"Loved this DVD. The message of shifting from the ambition stage of life to the desire for deeper meaning and connectedness in ""adolescence"" of our life was so clearly stated and expressed. It seemed as if Dr. Dyer was speaking of my life when he discussed the Quantum Shift. I've experienced this! It is indeed memorable, sudden, a surprise, sustaining...and I do remember everything about the moment when the shift occurred. My life will never be the same. Beautiful message about what really matters in life and following THAT! Worth watching again and again.",1243555200,,561,4.9787234042553195
3558701,4,B001F04Z82,"Very enjoyable movie. Good acting. Good story lines. It gets the message across. Most of us can identify in some small way with at least one of the characters and begin to see how we can apply the principles of the teachings into our own lives. I loved Dr. Dyer's personal stories the most, those he told during the interview process. You can tell he is a very spiritual man. The message of this movie fed my soul. I'll reach for it every time I start to run on empty. I get it, Dr. Dyer, and I thank you for the reminder. xoxo",1243036800,,527,4.12621359223301
3558702,5,B001F04Z82,"At last, here is Wayne Dyer's first movie, filmed part fictional story and part real. It follows very characters in vignettes that are interwoven on their weekend journey at a spiritually oriented getaway spot - all on a backdrop of the motivational guru being interviewed at the same local). Now renamed The Shift, this is somehow one of the most relaxing and uplifting films that makes you think, in a quiet way, how far off-track we all get and what life would be like if we led instinct first, ego second. Unlike The Secret which touches on some themes Wayne Dyer has long espoused, this is a lower key, substantial film that is about finding meaning and your own center (vs. using tricks of manifestation to bring on the wealth and material rewards which are not, in the long run, as meaningful as knowing what you need for true inner nourishment). The acting is notably natural which is what makes the film particularly unique. But for those who enjoy Dyer books and talks, it's another window of perception seeing him in this film, expressing his views, his way and style - in yet another dimension. If you didn't know anything about the concepts nor hear of Wayne Dyer, you would be entertained and informed. For those that do,this film is a welcome treat; an oasis that reminds you of the bigger picture. What is particularly effective is seeing Dyer himself integrate his perceptions and words within a larger 'story' (vs. just reading his words in his books) and secondarily, seeing 'average folks scenarios' (a busy workaholic, a lonely wife who shops her woes away, a tired out mother of two
who misses her artistic self, etc.) tell their story in conjunction with
some of the Dyer wisdom they come to find - not even realizing they are on a path. What also works is seeing a variety of ages respond to the same messages which adds a component of accessibility and 'organic' sense to anyone's journey.",1242172800,2,1914,4.699404761904762
3558703,5,B001F04Z82,"I loved this film (documdrama) and the messages behind it.  Dr. Wayne (one of my personal favorites) is being interviewed throughout the movie, as part of the ""plot"" highlighting the stories of several people trying to find purpose in their ego-driven lives. Each needs to reach a crisis point, a dark-night-of-the-soul (Dr. Wayne calls it a ""quantum moment""), before they can change direction ... from ambition (morning of life) to meaning (afternoon of life). The expanded two-DVD version has more interview with Dr. Wayne as well as additional scenes from the movie and other special selections.",1241654400,6,598,5.229166666666667
3558704,5,B001F04Z82,I loved this DVD! It was like having tea with Wayne Dyer who I believe to be an honest prophet in this time.,1241222400,,108,3.739130434782609
3558705,5,B001F04Z82,Watching Wayne Dyer in this DVD was inspiring to me.  I particularly loved how Wayne behaved with all around him.  He remained centered and in a place of integrity - sharing of himself - modeling behavior - observing without judgement.  I loved to watch the transformation in the characters and appreciated some of the surprises.,1240790400,,329,4.945454545454545
3558706,5,B001F04Z82,"A 2009 release from Hay House, this DVD is absolutely beyond fantastic!  The movie is approximately 2 hours long.  Wayne Dyer ""explores the spiritual journey from ambition to meaning.""  The focus is on shifting from the ego's perspective of accumulating and achieving to a life of service, of giving back.  (This does NOT mean you have to be a nun or priest to give back.)

We begin by entering the bedroom of a small trailer in a peaceful country setting and we observe as the clock changes to 3:13 a.m.  Wayne Dyer awakens, expresses gratitude by saying ""Thank You"" exactly 3 times, puts on his slippers and shuffles over to his writing pad and begins reading Jung and writing notes on a pad of paper.

We briefly shift focus to meet 3 groups of people.  First, we meet a couple and their children preparing to leave for a weekend getaway.  While taking on the nurturing role of wife and mother of 2 young boys, a woman has lost focus of who she is inside.

In another location, a hard-driving businessman, obsessed with achievement, argues with his lawyer over a building project.  He has lost focus of his wife and the love they once shared.  Money now rules.

Then we meet a movie director, arguing with his agent over financing for a film, as he prepares to do the Wayne Dyer interview.  He is so obsessed with seeing his pet project come to fruition that he has lost touch with all else.  Isn't it synchronicity that all 3 groups wind up at the same hotel.

In a series of interviews at this beautiful California resort, Dr. Dyer begins to dialog about finding your life's purpose.  Reminding us that we are created with everything we need, Wayne tells us we just need to go forth from there.  We are perfect in the beginning, but then e.g.o. (edge God out) takes over and we get sidetracked. We begin to want more, and more, and still more.  We begin to believe we are what we have and what we do.  We become consumed with who we are, and with what we have/make/achieve.  We compete constantly.

We also learn to believe that we are what others think of us.  The ego also teaches us we are separate from everyone else and separate from God and separate from that which we believe is missing in our life. So we end up living a lie.  We tend to live in ego, feeling stress and disharmony, instead of living in dharma (a higher place) and feeling bliss. You even begin to re-define what success means to you. What satisfied you before is no longer enough.  You want more.

Dr Dyer talks about how he also struggled with ego earlier in his career.  He worried over money and success.  In his case, he began shifting toward spirituality from within himself and recognized it.  He explained that you get to a place where you begin to be guided by something larger than yourself.  Dyer also talks about the Tao, frequently, and allowing Source to work its magic if you just stop interfering in your own life.

Throughout the story, the others lives are all intertwined at this resort and they walk through the process of realization and a shift in thinking.  You clearly see the egos in action as people do not get what they want and the way they react, as well as the effect it has on those around them.  Dr Dyer talks about quantum moments, the effects of which reside with you forever and about beginning a path to awareness.  He explains that once you are (re)connected to Source, the other stuff is no longer relevant in your life. When you are supported by Source, you have a knowing, a wisdom and there is such a beauty of reaching out to help another.  You attract what you are, not what you want.  Just show up and make your own music.  Prepare and let go.  Trust that everything will happen perfectly, as it is supposed to.  Just trust and let go. We are here to enjoy life and live in peace

If you loved Louise Hay's ""You Can Heal Your Life"" DVD, this is on the same order and you will likely love this DVD too.  It is profound and can be life changing.  If it doesn't affect you positively, you really need to wake up!  (Sorry)  I can tell you emphatically that this DVD is priceless!  Be sure to watch the movie credits for a final smile.

The spirituality that eminates from this movie brings tears to my eyes, the location is spectacular, the setting is wonderful, and how the story unfolds is artful. And that is all balanced by Dyer talks. Which are very well orchestrated. They happen in a natural flow, very creatively, I was suprised how much I enjoyed this and I guess that is why I am taking the time to write this.",1236729600,,791,4.142857142857143
3558718,5,B001F04Z82,"In an effort to provide full disclosure I should note up front that I am a long-time fan of Wayne Dyer's work and found him to be quite gracious and down-to-earth when I got to meet him at one of his lectures last year.

I thought this film was a magnificent compilation of Wayne's ideas - both in documentary form, as well as in theatrical form.  The video weaves back and forth from dramatic scenes, to interviews, much in the same way that ""What the Bleep"" successfully does.  With art of this kind there is a propensity for dialogue to slip into cheesiness (especially during the theatrical scenes), however, that was not the case with this video, and I found all of the dialogues to be quite genuine and authentic.  The director also makes subtle use of a number of motifs in a profound way.

I recommend this video to anyone who is a fan of Wayne Dyer's work and for those who are looking for a shift in consciousness but don't want to be beaten over the head with someone else's ideology.",1235692800,,995,4.415300546448087
3558719,5,B001F04Z82,The movie is beyond human words! Every single message is WOW...we all can serve money or money can becaome our servants! What would you choose? Watch the movie!,1235606400,,160,4.75
3558720,5,B001F04Z82,"I recommend the two-DVD, Deluxe edition, rather than the single DVD sold here. The first DVD is  the ""movie"" (which is more of a docudrama) and is 2 hours long. The second is a supplemental disc containing about 2+ hours of interviews, additional movie footage, and music. Both DVD's are excellent and you may find they are worth a few dollars more for the set, as compared to the single DVD version that is available here. The second DVD contains the taped interview with Dr. Dyer that the movie was ultimately written around. It goes into depth into areas sometimes only touched on in the movie itself. However, if your more of a cut-to-the-chase-type, then the single DVD should work just fine for you - it's the one I've watched the most, and continue to go back to time and again.

The movie follows the stories of various guests checking into a beautiful resort along the California Coast: a young family; a wealthy couple with a troubled marriage; and my favorite, an ambition-driven director, wonderfully played by Michael Deluise, whom I remember as a frequent guest star on the Gilmore Girls. (Some trivia here - he is also the son of Dom Deluise.) The director and his small crew are filming a docudrama starring Dr. Dyer (played as himself).

All of the key characters in the film experience what Dr. Dyer describes as a ""quantum moment"".  It opens the door to transformation for them as they  recognize and begin to live ""the music inside"" that Dr. Dyer teaches we were all born with but too often push aside while we are busy living our lives. One of the key points in the movie:  what if we come to the end of our life and discover it was all wrong?

The three stories (as well as some additional, interesting character development) are expertly woven throughout the movie and accompanied by voice-over's from Dr. Dyer. His deep, soothing voice always seems to hit the mark and works perfectly within each scene that it is added to. (Not too much, not too little.) The dramatizations are used to illustrate Dr. Dyer's timely teaching (mostly Taoist) of transformation from a life of ambition into a more meaningful life; a life that can be just as successful and full of prosperity and ambition as you desire but with greater significance through a deeper, spiritual motivation. It is a wonderful departure from the usual ""live-audience seminar"" format of most personal growth DVD's.

The narrative and story lines used as a way to exemplify the ideas presented here remind me of another Hay House production also directed by Michael Goorijan  ""You Can Heal Your life"" starring Louise Hay, and of another docudrama, not related to Hay House or Goorijan, ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"" (I recommend the ""Quantum Edition"" only, as you can edit out the sometimes tasteless dramatizations & it offers hours of additional interviews). Although both of these are excellent DVD's and highly recommended, ""Ambition to Meaning"" is so expertly written, directed, acted and produced that it has raised the bar and taken this genre to a whole new level. The cinematography of the Monterey Coast is absolutely breathtaking. The tranquil original musical score is worth noting as well. Especially nice are the original piano pieces played by ""Joe, the Janitor"" mid-way through the movie. (Don't ask... you just have to see the movie - it really does work.)

I have watched ""Ambition to Meaning"" countless times now and continue to learn something new and unexpected about myself with each viewing. This is not a ""spiritual addiction"" response as a previous commenter asserts of another reviewer of the Deluxe Edition who also said they have watched this movie repeatedly. But rather it is to be encouraged if you wish to explore your true purpose in life - or just want to make sense of life's struggles and challenges. Also worth pointing out is that I am a Christian and find these teachings well attuned to the teachings of Jesus.  I believe, whatever your faith, you  will find the movie inspiring if not life-altering.

3558721,5,B001F04Z82,"Updated January 2011: Sorry for the duplicate review here... this originally appeared on a different page when these DVD's were sold in two different packaging sets (one was a single disc version and the other a two-disc set which I reviewed below). The duplicate review you see above appeared along with the single DVD version which has since been deleted, so the reviews have been combined.

Also worth noting is shortly after the original release of this DVD, the name was changed to THE SHIFT, and you can still purchase it new under this name if you desire. But it is the same movie as reviewed here. Note, the only way to purchase the original ""Ambitious To Meaning"" title is to buy it used, here. If you decided to do this instead of buying the re-named version, you might want to check to see if you are getting the single disc version or the double disc set, as this particular product page doesn't really make it clear which version is being sold here.

Hope this helps sort out what has caused a bit of confusion. I think it would have been good if the folks at Hay House had gotten their act together before releasing this great movie in multiple disc-sets and names. (End of update)

3558724,5,B001F04Z82,"I just finished watching Ambition to Meaning and I felt compelled to recommend it to others. Dr. Wayne Dyer successfully shares his message of creating a life of meaning and purpose in a film that is not only filled with his amazing insights from start to finish, but is also a joy of sights and sounds. He makes the message so simple to understand, especially for visual people who enjoy seeing stories and messages unfold.

Dr. Dyer provides his audience with a framework to understand the pivotal shift that happens when we enter the ""afternoon of our lives"".  The characters are so well-crafted that viewers from all walks of life can find one to empathize with or to be inspired by. Personally, I was drawn to the mother of two who makes a pivotal shift towards finding herself and her own unique purpose outside the construct of her family and identity as wife and mother.

If you are attracted to the message of creating a life of meaning, I highly recommend this film.  The message is so profound that you may experience a shift yourself towards a life of higher meaning by the end of your viewing.",1234483200,,1106,4.598984771573604

The message in Ambition to Meaning is one of purity and love.  Dr. Dyer has a way of motivating you to look deep within your self and expand your self love and ambition!
In this movie the different scenarios going on with different beings are very easy to relate to.  I love the symbolism in each dilemma that ends in bliss.
Watch this movie with an open heart and know that your purpose in life is sure to reveal itself!
Thank you Dr. Dyer for another breathe of insight into our own ambition to meaning!!

With Much Gratitude,

3558727,4,B001F04Z82,"I found this movie to be a bittersweet experience. On one hand, I enjoyed the three plotlines thoroughly and found myself touched on more than oneoccasion. I found it delightful to watch as three people made the shift from having no clue about their purpose to discovering a divinity with themselves that illuminates their lives (and the lives of others). The acting was not only believable, but tangible and real. It was also easy to see a bit of myself in each of the characters, and that's testament not just to the acting, but also the writing.

On the flip side, I feel that Wayne got in the way of what could have brought the movie to even greater heights. The scenes with him come across as a little bit too preachy for my preference. Though the content of his monologues is informative, I wonder if his core messages may be lost in the sea of of telling people how things are... moreso than encouraging their own process of self-discovery.

There are some parts of the movie where a nice balance is struck between these two seemingly opposite experiences of the movie. At some points after the main characters experienced moments of significance, Wayne voices over with some insight that indirectly illuminates what the main characters were going through. I find these third person narratives to be welcoming.

Though I wish the movie had less of Wayne's monologues and more of the three plot lines, this movie is still one that has the power to change lives. If you can see past the preachy nature of his monologues, and understand and embody the concepts he talks about, then you will experience meaningful changes in your life. Seeing the other characters in the movie go through this process provides a tangible and realistic example that may help shed light on your own spiritual development process.

As with all spiritual content, each person will have a different experience of this movie. For me, this movie was entertaining, and at some points touching. For other people, Ambition to Meaning may serve as an amazing opening into a new way of being.",1233532800,4,2066,4.762569832402234
3558728,5,B001F04Z82,"Simply put, I was blown away by Ambition to Meaning.

I've been reading spirituality-related materials for years, including some of Wayne Dyer's work.  After watching Ambition to Meaning I noticed that a subtle shift had taken place within me.  I was able to internalize the teachings Dyer offers in the film in a way that was effortless: for the first time, I felt and ""knew"" Dr. Dyer's teachings on an internal level, rather than just as an external idea to be discussed.

The movie is very well positioned to have this kind of impact.  I am a media psychology student who has been studying how movies like this can make an impact.  In my career, I intend to make movies that can spark an inner change in viewers, and I have never seen a movie that has been as effective in that regard as this one.  Ambition to Meaning itself is a combination of Dyer, who plays himself as a character in the movie, offering his teachings alongside fictional character stories which demonstrate them.  The subtle combination of Dyer's real-life message with relatable stories makes integrating his teachings automatic in a way that I don't yet understand (but would like to!).  It's safe to say that I will be keeping this movie in mind as an benchmark I'd like to meet in my own filmmaking work.

Another sharp departure this movie takes from others like it is that Dyer has created it without the ego that usually accompanies spiritual teachings.  He plays himself and is himself within the movie - although he is acting, it is not an act - and he offers his teachings and these stories freely and openly.  You can sense that he is nonattached as to whether or not the characters he interacts with in the movie (as well as the viewer) will accept what he is saying at all: he just offers it because it comes from who he is.  This made Ambition to Meaning a very refreshing movie to watch, and made Dyer's teachings very easily accessible.

If you feel interested in watching this movie, I cannot recommend it highly enough.  Thank you, Dr. Dyer, not only for offering who you are to all of us, but for doing it in a way that is a true departure from what has ever been done before!",1232496000,6,2169,4.5115089514066495
