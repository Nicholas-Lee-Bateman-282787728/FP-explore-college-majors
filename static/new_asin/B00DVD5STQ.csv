5859389,1,B00DVD5STQ,"The trailer made the movie look like an edgy action packed thriller.
Reality of the movie was boring with 2 sub-par dull pranks.

If you are waiting for it to get good...it doesn't.",1378425600,5,181,4.484848484848484
5859390,5,B00DVD5STQ,"Sarah is a young former federal agent turned private security firm employee (not so subtle digs at the power and prestige of Blackwater).  Clever and articulate she goes undercover as Jane on assignment to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group called The East.  She is just fascinating to watch as an actress in this role, she uses even the slightest nuances to her advantage.  As the movie progresses it can be hard to tell where Sarah begins and Jane ends as she herself struggles with perception.  Marling is just brilliant in this role.

Alexander Skarsgard shines as Benji, the charismatic leader of The East.  It is nearly impossible from his first scene to view him as a villain since he is such a sympathetic character.  Benji has a great deal of depth and things aren't what they seem.  Ellen Page rounds out the cast with her portrayal of disillusioned but kind Izzy.

This film clearly has a liberal, pro-environmental slant, providing a glimpse into just how much destruction and corruption we as a society are willing to tolerate in the name of progress-or for our SUV's and central air.

Great film, definitely one of my favorites of 2013.  Worth having in your collection!",1378252800,4,1183,4.835820895522388
5859391,1,B00DVD5STQ,Horrible movie. I could not finish it. It had no story no suspense and nothing really to say. It was gross and disgusting to view. I don't know why they make movies like this.,1378252800,2,175,4.176470588235294
5859392,4,B00DVD5STQ,"Taut, thrilling, exciting, eerie. The East is all this without losing its Indie spirit and while tackling the subject of espionage in the nation's Capital. Very cool.

Brit Marling plays ex-FBI agent Sarah Moss. Sarah is smart and appealing without falling victim to Hollywood cliche. Moss, who now works for a private security firm, tells her boyfriend she is going on as assignment she can't talk about. She goes undercover to infiltrate The East, a group of anarchist freegans who take on anyone exploiting the environment for profit. As she gets deeper into The East, Moss begins to question her own identity and beliefs. She learns fast that her life is a maze of deceit and lies, and she is not sure who she can trust.

The story builds slowly, but never predictably, like driving a big truck on a winding mountain road that you have never been on before and each turn is a surprise.

Then the movie kicks into high gear. Watching, you feel you're in a runaway truck going downhill and you can barely keep the truck on the road, tires skidding the whole way. The end is a hairpin turn that the movie takes a little too fast.

What a ride though, seriously.

The East will always keep you guessing who the hero is, and in a good way as the characters are interesting, well-drawn, and the stakes are very high.

Intense.

Enjoy!",1378080000,7,1332,4.594936708860759
5859393,4,B00DVD5STQ,"Not the quickest pace for a movie, at least in the beginning. It's one of those movies that when the pieces start falling together and you see the bigger picture, it becomes impossible to not keep watching. It has a tendency to flip around, but again, it works.
The story that surrounds this cell, The East, was very intriguing. There is a part if me that agrees with what they stand for. I just don't appreciate the extreme measures they feel the need to use.
A lot of people will enjoy this movie and the story behind it. It really is an intense mind thriller.",1378080000,3,562,4.3619047619047615
5859394,4,B00DVD5STQ,"The East is 116 minutes of great acting, wrapped around a twisting (yet predictable) plot of Eco-terrorism, Anarchist mayhem, economic sabotage, and parental rebellion.

If Fight Club had began as a hippie movement focused around a Guy Fawkes concept, The East is what it would have been. However, don't expect an all loving, spiritual awakening type of film, it still rubs raw the ideals and expectations of the naive with brutal truths and discoveries.

Zal Batmanglij wrote and directed a great film. While it is not his first outing in the directors chair, it is by far his most well polished work thus far.
Brit Marling (""Arbitrage"") plays Jane, an operative for a very deep pocketed elite private investigation firm that is sent out to infiltrate the group as Sarah. What she finds is a well polished and close knit group of like minded people, most of which have a very personal interest in the anarchist movement that is The East.
Alexander Skarsgrd (""True Blood"", ""Battleship"") completely sheds his inner vampire for this role, and does an extraordinary job portraying Benji, the cautious and scarred Zen like commander of this leaderless pack of renegades.
Ellen Page (""Juno"", ""Inception"") takes hold of the reins of Izzy, a protective and very defiant young woman who does not take kindly to the uninvited introduction of Sarah into their little family.
The actors do an absolutely outstanding job creating unique and likable characters. From Shiloh Fernandez (""Evil Dead"", ""Red Riding Hood"") as Luca, the motherly one of the group who brings Sarah in when she needs medical attention, to Toby Kebbel (""Wrath of the Titans"", ""RockNRolla"") as Doc, who struggles with his own physical limitations and provides the medical help that the group sometimes needs. There are zero weak links in the chain of actors in this film, even the supporting cast all do an outstanding job peeling back the curtains and giving the viewer a glimpse at what it is like to run rampant upon the corporate world with revenge and retribution fueling the fires of well conceived chaos.

Most of the film takes place in and around an old half burned down home in the forest, which the group uses as it's temporary headquarters while the carry out their Jams (attacks). The cinematography is spot on and always finds a way to incorporate the surroundings, whether its peeling wallpaper or horses running across a meadow into the story to keep your eyes entertained and your mind thinking. What is important, what isn't?  It's a very well conceived film that unspools as a bit of a mystery as you ride along with Sarah as she tries to uncover who trusts who, who might be dangerous, and who is on to you in an adventure you are sure to enjoy.",1375142400,11,2724,4.839055793991417
5859395,5,B00DVD5STQ,"I first caught actress and screenwriter Brit Marling in a movie called ""Another Earth"" from a couple years ago.  Shortly thereafter she shows up in ""Sound of My Voice.""  In both cases she plays quiet, thoughtful young women with complicated personalities.  ""The East"" is her best role and her best film.  She plays an FBI-trained agent who is working for a private security firm headed by Sharon (Patricia Clarkson), a no BS CEO.

Sarah/Jane is given the task of infiltrating an eco-terrorist group known as The East.  This is a big step up in Sarah's career and she relishes the assignment.  She's very good at her job and manages to get inside the secret group, which is headed by Benji (Alexander Skarsgard) an heir to a fortune, but ultimately disillusioned by corporate greed.  Ellen Page plays Izzy and like Benji, she seeks payback for corporate atrocities is necessary even if lives are at stake.

While this sounds pretty cut and dry, Sarah using the alias Jane, begins to see the other side and why The East feel they must do what they do.  Evidence exists to see polluted lakes and water sources.  Drug companies produce unsafe compounds with little repercussions.  So now in most films, we would expect Sarah/Jane to flip sides, but Marling and her co-writer and director Zal Batmanglij don't make it so simple.

Even after Sarah and Benji play advanced kissy-face, things aren't so easy for Sarah.  Without giving away too much, Sarah must ultimately come up with her own plan.  This movie had me switching sides multiple times and Marling's performance is the reason.  This is a very good film and like Marling's earlier film efforts, likely won't get much attention.  Do yourself a favor and find it.",1374019200,59,1715,4.818493150684931
5859396,4,B00DVD5STQ,"""The East"" (2013 release; 116 min.) brings the story of Sarah Moss (played by Brit Marling). As the movie opens, a TV report comes on regarding the latest ""eco-terrorist"" attack by an outfit called The East, and we then see Sarah in discussions with the CEO (played by Patricia Clarkson) of Hiller Brood, a high-end security/intelligence firm. Sarah is tasked to go undercover and infiltrate The East, to gather up as much information as possible, and eventually bring this eco-terrorist cell down. Sarah manages very quickly to infiltrate the group and becomes part of it, eventually becoming close to the leader of them, Benji (played by Alexander Skarsgrd). At this point we're not even half-way into the movie, but to reveal more this plot-heavy film would surely ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: this movie is brought by the same ""team"" that brought you last year's ""Sound Of My Voice"", with Zal Batmanglij as director and co-writer and Brit Marling as co-writer and co-producer (and of course co-starring). In fact there are a number of scenes in ""The East"" that reminded me immediately of ""Sound of My Voice"", when the cell does some ""group bonding"" but in reality it feels more cult-like. This is supposed to be a political thriller, but to me some of the 'bad stuff' that Big Pharma is accused of seems over-simplistic (chemical dumping every day at exactly 3 o'clock!). The movie is far more effective as a psychological thriller: will Sarah fall for Benji? Even the Hiller Brood CEO recognizes the danger (""we understand it's quite natural to bond, but don't ever get soft""). And who is playing/setting up who exactly? That tension plays strongly in the last 45 min. of the movie, with a couple of plot twists I hadn't expected (and that is not a complaint!). I suppose I should mention that both Alexander Skarsgrd and Ellen Page are part of The East group, but in reality I felt a bit sorry for them and the other performers, as they are simply blown away on the screen by Brit Marling. She seems to get better and better (last year in ""Sound of My Voice"" and equally excellent in ""Arbitrage"" in that Ivanka Trump-reminding role, and earlier this year in a smaller role in Robert Redford's ""The Company You Keep""). She is still not even thirty! Last but not least, any movie that plays The National's ""About Today"" in its soundtrack (it plays at a key moment in the second half), is quite alright in my book!

The screening I saw this at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati in late June, was surprisingly well attended, I'm happy to say. If you are in the mood for a quality indie movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The East"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1373500800,18,2803,4.718367346938775

5859432,3,B00DVD5STQ,"I saw this movie on cable. This film is thought provoking but unfortunately it has some predictable parts. For example, the female protagonist has a brief sensual relationship with male antagonist shortly after meeting him minutes after his friend was murdered. What a waste of time. This young female already had a boyfriend,  and literally, for less than two minutes, she and the guy she is investigating has a 'quikie.' I like the someone unpredictable nature of the film but I hated the predictability of it as well. The predictability of the film stole the excitement that I thought I would have from watching this film. I still enjoyed most of the film but the 'love' parts made no sense to me. Knowing that you are an infiltrator to the group and already have a serious, long term relationship with sineone outside of The East, the female protagonist betrays who she is and what she personally had on a 2-minute heavy breathing, clothes ripping session with a man who has no issue kissing another man. This film's direction  went from good  to typical  after a member died .

5859436,5,B00DVD5STQ,"A superb movie to say the least. It makes mainstream big budget Hollywood movies feel like...

At a deeper level, I saw the message of the movie as follow :

It is aboutthe modern man, who lives his life like a robot, competing with other robots in the chasing of the dangling carrot of ""a career"", materialistic comfort, money and so-called ""love"". All the while, being completely oblivious and indifferent to the destruction and suffering - to himself and to others - his foolish pursuits of misunderstood concepts, leave in the trail.

The movie invites the viewer who hasn't surrendered his ability to think and feel - just like the main character of the movie - to take another look at his life and attitudes, that he may one day be truly happy by being an agent of positive change in himself and in the world.

To Love Is To Actively Care.

Quoting Rollo May ('Man's Search For Himself') :

_ ""The human being cannot live in a condition of emptiness for very long: if he is not growing toward something, he does not merely stagnate; the pent-up potentialities turn into morbidity and despair, and eventually into destructive activities.""

_ ""When men at last accept the fact that they cannot successfully lie to themselves, and at last learn to take themselves seriously, they discover previously unknown and often remarkable recuperative powers within themselves.""",1446076800,,1371,4.858369098712446

It is quite different - more of an action thriller than SF - but they have familiar threads that mark what I am beginning to see as an influence even though there are two different directors.

I really enjoyed how the time was taken to create not only rich, fully believable - and different - characters but also the many threads of interplay between the different characters.

Add to this smart dialogue, subtle twists - and I won't tell you more - and you get, in my opinion, a great film.  The kind of film that sticks with you days later as you turn over different bits and realise that it makes you see things in a different light.

5859458,4,B00DVD5STQ,"This is a psychological thriller movie where the main character goes undercover into an eco-terrorist group called The East.  Very much a grey-area film, you journey with her as she goes deeper and deeper until she's no longer really sure what she believes or if this group is right or wrong.  Even if you applaud the goals of this group and understand how they came to bear grudges and anger against the corporations that have messed them and the world up, do the ends really justify the means?  Can Jane, the undercover operative, keep hold of her old corporate self or will she end up more like the very group she is investigating.

Some spoilers. Jane gets a big job on her rise up the corporate ladder with Hiller Brood, a high-powered company that seeks to gain big corporations as clients to help them fight against those who come at them (the impression is this is not just against groups that use actual terrorism, but more than that).  She dyes her hair, leaves her man, changes her name to Sarah and goes off the grid.  Eventually, she hooks up with this group in the ruins of an old house where she becomes involved in their ""jams,"" where they attack corporations by aiming their evils back at them.  In this, there are three jams they intend, one regarding big pharma making plans to sell their new antibiotic for military use (a drug that causes nerve and brain damage), another corporation that is polluting the waters, and one that spies on people to sell info to the powers that be.  These three issues being some of the main ones people have with today's corporate world, it makes sense that these three evils are the ones shown.

Along the way, Jane/Sarah meets Benji, the leader of this group, and there are some situations where her reserve is broken down.  This appears very cult-like in some ways, so you're not sure if she is being brainwashed by it or if she is being awoken from her cold, business self that has cut her off from her real feelings.  Again, very grey...

Will Jane flip sides?  Will she fall under Benji's spell?  Who are the real bad guys in this movie?  This movie will make you think and wonder so that even if you don't agree with The East's methods, maybe they have something worthwhile to say.  Well-acted, good script, some (NICE!) nudity with Skarsgard, who plays Benji.  Definitely a movie to watch in conjunction with ""V for Vendetta.""",1421798400,2,2386,4.589622641509434

Sure, there are plenty of films produced in Hollywood every year that deal with group infiltration, going under-cover, oppressive governments and corporations, political thrillers, and so on...what makes this movie different is that it feels and looks totally original.

No, like those great soviet indoctrination films of yesterday, all pretense to art or entertainment has been abandoned; the plot, the characters, the dialogue, the editing and even the prop garbage are all subordinated to one pure ideological message: the good people are oh so justified in hating and working to destroy the vile, heartless, evil corporate interests.

I caught this rather interesting thriller late one evening cable. There is no point in regurgitating the whole plot here. However, the premise is as follows Our main protagonist Jane is an operative for a private intelligence firm Hiller Brood, and is assigned by her boss Sharon to infiltrate The East an underground anarchist co operative who plan and carry out covert actions against corporations in an effort to bare/reveal their corruption and negligence. In her undercover role, and in-line with the ethos of the anarchist cell, she practices Freeganism. This entails the eating of recovered/eating food that has been thrown away. As Jane gets to know the group, her views are shown to change, as she is not immune to the cells message as well as the individual narratives of the group members. As the plot progresses there some rather interesting twists and turns to the story.

For me there lots of symbolism in this film, some of which is quasi-religious such as the set up involving straight-jackets, where by, each member feeding each other as they are unable to feed themselves. It is interesting to note that Brit Marling  who plays Jane in the film, experienced first-hand how to hop trains and learned to sleep rough as well as practicing Freeganism. The East, is no espionage film as we know it and Jane uses the same field craft  disguise, tools of spy craft and a legend that holds up to the scrutiny of the cell. This is film whether you like it or not it raises many questions. The cells attack on a pharmaceutical company that sells flawed and dangerous medicine  is part based on a drug company that touted medication that lead to a number of suicides amongst patients that used it. This an unusual thriller it is not the state but rather big business are the culprits, a film worthy of a good four stars in my estimation  its not perfect by an means but it is very thought provoking.",1404000000,,1928,4.706231454005935
5859486,1,B00DVD5STQ,"Propaganda masquerading as entertainment.

The writers and director of this movie live in an alternate reality where people on the far political left are in some way counter culture, rather than the vocal, elite-endorsed vanguard of the progressive tidal wave. The movie gets to paint conformity with the dominant social narratives in our society as somehow being edgy, and dangerous. So we get to watch some hipsters being very, extremely edgy for 116 minutes as they like totally do stuff to bad people, because corporations.

The intellectual bankruptcy of the film is revealed in a scene where a character who had his nervous system destroyed by antibiotics laments the fact that warning labels that such things can happen to people who take antibiotics ARE printed on the containers, because it lets big pharma do terrible stuff 'in broad daylight'. Never mind that he voluntarily took the antibiotics after reading the  warning label and then gets cross that what the warning label said might happen does, in fact, happen.

In other words, he fails completely to realize that the problem might not be that there was a label on the bottle, but that he was apparently too much of an idiot to read it.

The good news is that this exercise in intellectually fluffy tedium returned a $2.4 million box office on a $6.5 million budget, which indicates, for some inexplicable reason, that your average person doesn't get quite as turned on by SWPL Marxist fantasies as do over-educated, reality insulated try hards from the top echelons of society.

By a strange twist of fate, I turned this film off mid-way and turned on the other DVD I'd gotten for the night, which was Sound of My Voice, and lo-and-behold it was by the same director and once again featured Brit Marling playing a, like, highly, *highly* intense and edgy person doing lots of hipstery edgy stuff.

The plot is that a young, former FBI agent is a rising star in a private firm that specializes in corporate security.  Conveniently she's a Christian who prays and listens to Christian radio on her way into work.

She's assigned to go undercover with a radical group called ""The East"" who target corporate CEO's to ""punish them"" for their ""sins.""

In the process, she comes to see how right the East is.

The movie creates a straw man of evils being perpetrated by corporations that aren't really happening.",1386028800,2,701,4.666666666666667
5859549,4,B00DVD5STQ,"Actor/Screenwriter Brit Marling really has something on the ball. She's a remarkable performer, and she certainly has an ear for dialogue and creating realistic situations out of moments that could easily be made very melodramatic. And with co-writer and director Zal Batmanglij's THE EAST, Marling has certainly become a force to be reckoned with in independent cinema.

THE EAST exists in a morally grey area about moral superiority and how it's acted upon. Sarah (Marling) is a rising star in a private security agency, whose agents are overseen by the fearsome yet relaxed Sharon (the excellent Patricia Clarkson). The agency represents major conglomerates all over the country, and an environmental/humanist activist group calling themselves The East have risen up and seem to be up to more than just chaining themselves to trees and occupying Wall Street as they commit acts of ""environmental terrorism"" against some of America's wealthiest citizens. Sarah is tasked with infiltrating the group, which she does through incredible guile and amazing use of tradecraft. She meets the charming and earthy leader Benji (Alexander Skarsgard), and his right-hand, the more volatile and angry Izzy (Ellen Page). As she goes deeper into the people in the group, they prove to be even more enigmatic the more she learns, and her mission to stop them becomes an internal conflict between her sense of justice and her personal morality. And, with all stories of this kind, she needs to make a choice between what's in her head and what's in her heart.

If this were a larger budgeted film aimed at a more ""Hollywood"" audience, it would mark Marling's work in this film as someone who could easily be the next big thing, but this isn't that kind of film by design because there's no way that a more ""Hollywood"" studio would take on a film of this kind. The performances, particularly by Marling and Skarsgard, are extraordinary, but when it comes to Page, it seems that this role is a little rote for her. She's an wonderful actress and she really disappears effortlessly into the role of Izzy, but too many beats of this character hearken back to her breakout debut in David Slade's HARD CANDY. Another problem is the ending. I would have liked to have seen this film take a bigger risk with a more definitive ending. So much of the film exists in the grey area already, and the ending follows through on that thread, but it seems a little perfunctory.

However, the rest of the film makes up for what the ending seems to be lacking for in staying power and creates more layers to the ongoing questions that need to be asked. Such as how most of us seem perfectly fine with the status quo despite the criminal activity being perpetrated by some of the wealthiest in our society. Are the members of The East terrorists? Are they misguided young people looking for a cause to believe in? Are our corporations solely interested in their bottom line that they would perpetrate what are truly crimes against humanity or does benevolence exist at all in the corporate world? These are certainly questions worth asking, and THE EAST will certainly polarize its audience on these ideas, but when it comes down to it, THE EAST works best when it's more of a concentrated character study that holds its characters in a grey area allowing us to make our own decisions.",1385942400,2,3351,4.844677137870855

I figured the protagonist would come down hard on one side or the other of her dilemma.  But somehow they found a path to the end that was, in fact, satisfying and not a sellout.  I found the movie inspiring.  And Marling is just a joy to watch.",1385683200,,588,4.060869565217391
5859553,4,B00DVD5STQ,"Brit Marling is really making a lot of herself and becoming one of those names to get excited over.  Between her work (in front and behind the camera) in films like Another Earth and The Sound of My Voice, she is clearly one of those ones to watch of this decade.  Shes certainly more interesting than some of the talentless bodies you see floating around magazine covers.  With her latest entry, Marling once again proves that she has the smarts to not only craft an original piece of work but also the talent to carry it on her shoulders.

The East is possibly her most straightforward work so far, and so for that it may be deemed her least impressive and yet it is probably her most polished to date.  Where The Sound of My Voice felt somewhat avant-garde in tone, and Another Earth felt entirely indie, there is something very grounded about The East.  It feels very surefooted, which is a good thing, and even though the ending left me a tad underwhelmed (and yet, it was effective), there is a lasting presence here that is undeniable.

The East tells the story of a young woman who is working for a private intelligence firm.  Her firm is hired to infiltrate a group of terrorists targeting companies who are putting the health of their fellow man at risk.  Under the alias of Sarah Moss, this woman finds herself being sucked into the world of The East, becoming part of their plans and their jams and eventually sympathizing with their mission.  The thing is, these kids aren't just random punks looking to stir up trouble; they have legitimate axes to grind and, in a way, they are just looking out for the greater good.

It doesnt make it legal.

The East excels in one area over all, and that is in the pitch perfect ensemble.  Every player here in uniformly great, with a few standouts (this could be Ellen Pages best performance) and not a single sour note.  The brooding is kept at bay, and used only when needed, for there is so much brimming beneath the brood that it becomes important to play it just right.  Skarsgard is also very good here, betraying his good looks with something far more impactful.

The films message is very much the same as the group it glamorizes, and in that effect it works rather well.  The fact remains that things like this are not uncommon (Im talking conglomerates exploiting and endangering the rest of us) and sometimes it feels like the only thing to do is take matters into ones own hand.  The films concluding twist is a smart one, even if it feels anticlimactic in a way (so subtle), because it adds a more realistic and admirable spin on the films message.  Violence does not beget violence, and so Sarahs eventual decisions shed a glimmer of hope where bleakness reigns.

I do wish that the clichs regarding the cultish nature of The East weren't so pronounced (the dinner scene was regrettable), but overall its a minor glitch.

Like I said, this film is very polished.  The cinematography is beautiful, and adds to the films atmosphere.  The set pieces are memorable, especially that abandoned house (eerie) and the overall construction of the films themes are engaging and interesting.  Mostly though, The East serves as further proof that Brit Marling is the real deal.  She has range (sci-fi, cults, terrorists) and she understands how to build tension without resorting to histrionics or gruesome violence.

I, for one, am anxious to see her become a huge star.",1385510400,2,3425,4.647840531561462

But it's worst crime is that it is incredibly amateurish, a story that turns into drivel at the slightest scrutiny.

5859563,3,B00DVD5STQ,"""In a year where paranoia cinema is getting a bit of exposure (i.e. The Fifth Estate, The Purge, Closed Circuit, The Company You Keep), The East (produced by the late Tony Scott) is a nice addition to this catalogue with an interesting but rather rudimentary and simple take on the actions of ultra-left wing environmentalists.

Brit Marling, who has been of independent film fame with Another Earth, plays a private intelligence firm agent who takes on the mission (sounds implausible but it does not once you see it) of becoming part of the environmentalist cult for the sake of uncovering their identities. Soon as she assimilates, she becomes part of their ideological imprint spying on their actions yet doing her job. The film's approach is one that is conventional of the espionage thriller but without much of the action, thrills, and extreme intensity that is inherent in much of the Hollywood fare. Still, it is much of the grassroots, underground approach in the film that is a good feature which is due in part to Brit Marling and Zat Batmanglij living among the Occupy Wall Street protesters.

But despite its origins and acclaim being a Sundance Film Festival favourite, the film suffers and drags a bit with a rather rudimentary approach of suspense (except the scenes where The East goes out to hunt for their suspects) for drama by focusing more on a romance, acknowledgment of strange encounters, and having some rather bland and stale characters (even the stereotypical head of the agency that sent the lady to do the mission) that could come out of a Demetri Martin skit of 'hipsterdom.'

Ellen Page was never once convincing here nor is Peter Skarsgaard and Brit Marling but the themes of the film were and some of the satirical-like voiceovers and actions which are pretty much a stab at organisations like Greenpeace and PETA (which some love and some hate). The ending is not enough to suffice and the suspense sizzles out pretty quickly to where what was almost promising seems ordinary and stale like white bread. Certainly a nice take on the hypocrisy and odd mannerisms of extreme organisations but not enough to keep its head on its knees with suspense and intrigue. Some scenes steal it and so does the intriguing and mysterious trailer but that is not enough.

If you want that cream on your pie, why not consider watching a documentary about this subject or the news. Well, at least I seen this film over the perceivably predictable The Company You Keep. Maybe modernity and relevance was a factor in the decision?""",1384300800,,2547,4.848275862068966
5859564,5,B00DVD5STQ,"The majority of Americans know that our Congress is more than half full with ""lawmakers"" who are the corrupt tools of large corporations that make relatively large ""donations"" to them. Those who ""frack"" and pollute citizens' water supplies have a get-out-of-jail-free card, and those who spill oil on land or sea basically have much the same. Indeed many of us well remember that when BP caused a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico a few years ago (a spill which has not yet been properly cleaned up), there were those is Congress who demanded that an apology be given ... to BP!

And it is apparent to many of us that regulatory agencies such as the FDA and the EPA are often manipulated by members of Congress and by various wealthy corporate interests ... for the enrichment of the corporations (and members of Congress) rather than the protection of American citizens.

THE EAST (2013), a Ridley Scott production with a liberal agenda, opens with disturbing images of water fowl and sea turtles covered in thick layers of oil and dying.

Next, we are shown images of vigilantes ""punishing"" an oil executive by invading his lavish house and providing his personal property with a thick covering of black oil.

In the plot of this well-made polemic, an athletic young woman (Brit Marling, who co-wrote the screenplay with director Zal Batmanglij) is assigned by her pro-corporation, anti-vigilante company to infiltrate the group responsible for such an outrage to an oil executive; she (with vast amounts of implausible good luck) is able to do so very quickly and easily. The questions arise: what IF she is expected to participate in ""terrorism"" that will hurt or kill somebody? what IF she is found out as a spy? what IF her sympathies are converted to the goals of these people she has been gathering evidence against?

The range of ratings THE EAST has received thus far by nearly a hundred Amazon reviewers is almost typical of the views of similar percentages of voters in America. About 55 percent of American voters tend to view many corporations as greed-driven organizations that will put their profits first and the welfare and health of ordinary citizens last. And about 45 percent of American voters tend to believe that corporations are basically necessary things that should be protected at almost all costs, regardless of any harm they might do.

During the course of this film viewers are invited to consider whether vigilantes are ever justified, whether the moral code of ""an eye for an eye"" is appropriate, or whether citizens should try to rely on our country's current system of laws and lawmakers. We see some diversity in the views of the vigilantes themselves, and towards the end of the film we see some polarization of views ... followed by the infiltrator's own chosen path for taking action.

This is a film that is designed to make its audience Think (with a capital T) and Rethink (with a capital R). It does not present the answers for us.

Chiefly because it is a vivid and largely successful prod towards finding a solution (or solutions) to the harms (plural) of corporate greed and Congressional corruption, if I were giving this film a letter grade, I would give it a solid ""A"".

It was entertaining, but not a good movie.  There is definitely no payoff for the audience in the story.  It kept me entertained, but I was unhappy with how it ended.  No one will be winning any acting awards for this one.  It seems to have been made on a tighter than normal budget.

This film does not avoid those uncomfortable moments people need to face to make change, although it could have been a bit more uncomfortable if you ask me.

The other great one this week was 'Stuck in Love' - I also highly recommend and we both agreed that it's a winner.

I felt like The East had elements of some of the later Bourne Identity movies and at times reminded me of The International as well. All favorites of mine. It had all the right ingredients - great acting, great story and the filming had that hard to describe sort of European thriller grittiness - like you believe this is actually happening and you're peering through a window.

Brit Marling was awesome - over the top awesome - I saw her on Bill Maher a few months ago plugging the movie and She and Bill were right - yeah, I really liked this movie.

One major flaw is that for some inexplicable reason, they decided to put key plot resolution points into the credits where they can easily be missed,  rather than into the end of the actual movie.  Also, as someone who is knowledgeable about many of the topics they discussed I felt that the writers could have done a little bit more research on their subject matter as there were numerous technical errors in the 'corporate wrongdoing' scenarios.  In fact I can think of real-life stories that paralleled closely but were even more dramatic than the made-up scenarios in this film and would have made better subject matter (names changed to protect from the lawyers, of course).",1381795200,,797,4.788321167883212

I had hoped that the film might deliver some nuance or surprise, but basically the entire plot, climax, denouement, character arcs are essentially obvious and eminently predictable from the preview. There was not one single element of the film (other than it's aggressive ugliness - it was filmed with the aesthetic notion that dark and ugly equals artistic and deep - I often felt myself wishing (as I often do) that I could have loaned the cinematographer a light meter) that I and my companion had not predicted. Not one.

Here are two suggestions of entertaining films with deep (and genuine) pathos, as opposed to cheap sentimentality, and intellectually sound, as opposed to shallowly simplistic, investigations of similar themes: The Lives of Others, which investigates how morally sound individuals become subsumed within dominant ethical and ideological hegemony, and how they can find redemption, and Michael Clayton, which examines how feudal corporations victimize and predate upon an uninformed citizenry.

This isn't the typical FBI which stops groups from performing terrorists acts before they happen, or arrests them when they can, but that Hollywood FBI which allows terrorists to hurt people and then maybe arrest them after they hurt some more. The anarchists are personal victims of the companies they go after. Sarah begins to sympathize with the group which leads to an anti-climatic ending which I could have written better myself.

I had really enjoyed the film up until the ending. Ellen Page turned in a good performance, but for the most part, I thought the tale was a tad on the lackluster side. Seriously, who is shocked that drugs are unsafe (Tylenol) or poisons are dumped into water? We did see ""Rude Awakening.""

This is not an action movie, but it is a deeply profound one. The writers did a great job at developing a script that you can connect with and characters that are truly real. On top of this the actors did an admirable job at developing their characters further and allowing the viewer into the emotion of the moment and empathize with what the characters are going through themselves.

The East was the opposite.",1379462400,2,175,5.0
5859664,5,B00DVD5STQ,"The movie is well worth watching for its suspenseful, thought-provoking plot and intriguing characters alone, but Brit Marling's on-screen presence astounds. Excellent acting in one of the best films of 2013.",1379462400,,208,5.741935483870968
5859665,5,B00DVD5STQ,"Gripping, edge-of-your seat, well-paced thriller. Excellent acting especially by lead actress Brit Marling who deserves an Oscar nomination for her role as Sarah. Loved the twists and turns in the plot, the moments when I gasped, and watching Marling delve deeply into Sarah's conflicting emotions.",1379376000,3,298,5.644444444444445
5859676,3,B00DVD5STQ,"You have to take any sort of education out of your mind to watch this and just enjoy it. So, if you are about 16-17 and impressionable, it should work for you.
The acting was great. The directing was great.
Spoilers a little bit. Not plot just a few complaints.......
The thought that a drug distributed by injection or IV could be ingested with same results ( and a small amount in a glass) is just silly. There was no explanation if FDA was paid off for forgoing clinical trials or if the drug was sooooo needed, they were given approval with a black box label. And the 'can't sue the drug company' thing...really?  Most sued industry....the fact he couldn't sue because it was in the package insert is just ludicrous. ( obviously writer had never seen all those late night law commercials)
The EPA not dinging the company dumping arsenic wasn't explained either. Then finally for me...surgery without gloves....The medical person in me just wanted to throw something at the screen knowing that the Dr would know better. Why not leave her on an ER doorstep?
 But, the acting was good for what was written. Ellen Page didn't act like Juno, and it was actually fun to see what potential she has.  Had never seen Brit Marling before and really thought she did a great job.
And seriously. I bought this for the Alex S involvement. *Why do you think anyone purchased Straw Dogs?* He was outstanding in his acting. Its ok to be both a great actor and a sex god. Embrace it. Somebody has to do it.
We get you are not just a pretty face.",1379289600,,1531,4.480286738351254
5859677,4,B00DVD5STQ,"""When it's your fault it shouldn't be so easy to sleep at night. Especially when we know where you live."" Sarah (Marling) works for an elite private intelligence firm and her new assignment is to infiltrate an anarchist group that attacks major corporations. When she takes part in the first attack she is set to rat them all out, until she realizes what they do isn't as evil as she originally thought. Now she is torn between the two worlds and wonders who the true evil group really is. First and foremost this is a great movie. While this is not specifically based on a true story all of this is based on actual groups. That fact alone makes this disturbing. This is like an intense version of Erin Brokovich. This also makes you wonder what corporations actually are like and why groups like The East are considered the enemy. I really liked this and highly recommend it. Overall, an environmental Donnie Brasco that is tense and makes you think. I give it an A-.",1379289600,3,968,4.537142857142857

5859682,5,B00DVD5STQ,"I'm not a movie critic, so I don't know the technical operations of filming and I can guess that most people watching movies don't either. Therefore, this is simply based on my experience of seeing The East. I love a movie that can open a hole into my mind and inflict the question of how I am living my life- leaving me with a sting of the truth and the mixed feelings of someone who is on the brink of acting to correct those choices and someone who is unsure about leaving behind the comfort of what is familiar. Though the consistent opinions of this film not having a lot of action is true; it in no way lacks the reality that life does not happen in a constant motion, but draws in inconsistent flourishes- enhancing, for me, the ability to grow with the plot, as well as allowing me time to think about the overall picture. I got attached to the characters, felt their emotions, and could sympathize with their motives. Sure, it sucks when you have to buy a movie you aren't sure about, but I took a leap of faith and ended in an unexpected place- which is exactly where I wanted to be. The East brought me a subject I cared about, led me to follow my gut, asked me where I would turn right from wrong, and called me to really look at what's happening around me, us.  I hope you too are searching for a movie with purpose- because this is it. So just Watch and...",1378684800,52,1370,4.229007633587786

5859685,1,B00DVD5STQ,"This is a film of serious intent. Boy, oh, boy. Is this ever a film of serious intent. Eco-terrorists versus corporate types. One of the leads (Brit Marling) also co-wrote the screenplay. A dangerous situation. Actors work best when their approach to a screenplay goes something like, ""How do I make this **** work?"" But if you wrote it...Well, then. Each word is precious and oh so serious. That's Ms. Marling's problem here. She needed (I'm serious) someone standing off-camera with an (I will be delicate) electrified cattle-moving device so as to encourage her to move her face from her one, frozen, serious expression, a mask of gravitas. It's possible that Brit Marling is a good actress, but unless she stops writing her own acting stuff or hires a wrangler with a prod we'll never know. And the other actors--with the exception of the unsinkable Patricia Clarkson--do no better. All so very serious, frozen. Okay, that was the acting. The screenplay? Right at eight minutes in, we (my wife and I) later confirmed that we knew Where The Film Was Going. But in all our years together we haven't learned how to say, ""I ain't watching any more of this stuff"" for fear of being rude to our mate, who might be enjoying whatever film we're watching. But after ""The East"" we're working on developing subtle signals that will indicate our displeasure and need to bail. A ""T"" made with the hands, like coaches use maybe. This was a film of serious intent, but I'm sorry. Time is precious as one ages. And even when you're young.",1378512000,11,1526,4.719101123595506
