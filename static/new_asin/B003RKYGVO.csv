8403798,5,B003RKYGVO,"This was one of the best films to come out of the '80s and the only one featuring the Bridges brothers, Beau & Jeff, acting together along with an Oscar nominated role for Michelle Pfeiffer.  Steve Klove's direction/writing plus Dave Grusin lovely score make this flick a winner all around. Also check out a transcription of ""My Funny Valentine"" on YouTube.",1514678400,,357,4.852459016393443

8403800,5,B003RKYGVO,"One of my favourite films.  The blu-ray version is is wonderfully clear visually and the audio quality is superb.  The disc has a ""segregated soundtrack"" option where you can turn off the dialogue and listen to the brilliant score.  I have the CD soundtrack also, which is great, but there's a brilliant piano piece in the movie (the post New Year's party scene) that's missing from the CD where Dave Grusin plays a great solo piece.  Perfect!",1482364800,2,443,4.714285714285714

8403802,5,B003RKYGVO,"Two failing lounge piano players decide to add a singer. Michelle Pfieffer is amazing in this film. She is perfect in her role as escort/singer. The Bridges brothers are also at their best. Lots of sexual tension here.  Fabulous acting, great drama. You will enjoy this exceptional movie.",1475107200,,288,5.0
8403803,4,B003RKYGVO,"This review only refers to the technical quality of the Blu-ray version of this film: good transfer, true to the original source, with nice film grain (there seems to be no undue amout of digital noise reduction applied). Some amount of dirt and dust visible, but never to a distracting degree. Audio quality is also good. For fans of the film a clear recommendation!",1471305600,4,367,4.75
8403804,5,B003RKYGVO,The Fabulous Baker Boys is an excellent film that oozes pure class and style from every frame. An 80s gem that deserves a much bigger audience. The performances are wonderful with Jeff Bridges giving one of his best (which you can say with any of his performances) and Michelle Pfeiffer is stunning as always. It has one of the last true stellar scores to come out of the 80s as well that is also featured as an isolated score track on Twilight Time's terrific blu ray. Movies like this don't exist anymore sadly which makes The Fabulous Baker Boys an even greater treasure. Cinematic magic.,1468800000,5,591,4.6380952380952385
8403805,5,B003RKYGVO,Twilight Films in general are so superior to original releases.  I have been waiting for this film to be released on BluRay.  The chemistry between the actors is one great aspect of this film.,1466726400,4,192,4.617647058823529
8403806,5,B003RKYGVO,Cinematic and musical masterpiece finally on blu ray! I was waiting years for this!,1446854400,3,83,5.0
