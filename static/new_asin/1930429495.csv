Very fun to watch and great advice.  we have been using some of the techniques and so far it is helping.  Its not a cureall but it helps.  the best part is that the advice can be used in other areas of life as well not just for dealing with children.  ""I know"", ""It's hard""...",1459036800,,366,4.098591549295775

7801396,5,1930429495,"I love the Love and Logic principles for parenting!  They are wonderful!  They really show you how to help your children behave and be the wonderful little people you want them to be without having to argue, fight, or drain your energy trying to do so!  What's best is your children KNOW that you love them even when they get corrected!  I think my favorite part about Love and Logic is the fact that the consequences get to be the bad guy, not you!  The consequences do the teaching so your children actually learn from their mistakes instead of focusing on how mad they are at you for yelling at them.  I would give Love and Logic more stars than 5 if that was an option!",1364947200,2,673,4.301587301587301
