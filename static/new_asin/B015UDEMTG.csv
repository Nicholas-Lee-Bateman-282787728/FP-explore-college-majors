8734676,4,B015UDEMTG,"Hamatora's story takes a decidedly darker turn in its second season, with several of the new Minimums outright causing madness and chaos, if not death, and several very dark and traumatic secrets coming to light, with (SPOILER) Art becoming emotionally/mentally unbalanced, due to the reclaimed memories of his brother's fate (END SPOILER). Having deconstructed so many tropes in its first season, it's now as if Hamatora is turning around and deconstructing itself! That being said, I would have to call this season a good idea poorly executed. Several re-watches and some serious thinking are necessary to get a grasp on the plot points and the characters' motives, and the ending makes no sense from any perspective no matter how many times I watch it. Also, there seems to have been some retconning in the time elapsed since the death of Art's brother. All that being said, I still enjoyed it, and the truth of what happened to Art's brother breaks my heart every time I think of it. (SPOILER) No wonder Art went off the deep end when he remembered (END SPOILER). If ""brains"" were the theme of the first season, then ""heart"" is the theme of the second, and to make sense of it, you really do have to view things through an emotional perspective, a challenge I enjoy.",1458777600,,1270,4.777272727272727
