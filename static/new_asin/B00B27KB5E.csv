8561254,5,B00B27KB5E,"Set up with 6 separate workouts which run about 15 minutes each.  I usually do three at a time.  These are very simple relaxing workouts, but I have had issues with sciatica, and have found these really helpful.  On days where I don't feel like I can run or do an intense workout, these are just enough to feel like, at least, I did something, and make my back feel better",1430006400,,372,4.211267605633803
8561255,5,B00B27KB5E,"I love this DVD. I first began using these workouts when I discovered them ""On Demand"" on Cox.  When they were no longer available through Cox, I promptly ordered the DVD from Amazon. There are a number of excellent workouts featured that I can do even though I have Arthritis. I can mix and match the different ones and the woman who leads them is easy to follow. Each workout focuses on a different area of the body which I enjoy and the workouts are both energizing and calming at the same time. I've tried several different Yoga DVDs and I have to say this is my favorite.",1425168000,,576,4.333333333333333
8561256,5,B00B27KB5E,I'm shocked to see this DVD hasn't received any reviews. The selection of workouts are relaxing and cleansing. The voice that talks you through the poses is calming. Overhead shots of the model gives a truly refreshing perspective to many poses that many of us don't often get to see. You can combine workouts to make a 30-90 minute session or just do one in the morning for 15 minutes. In a nutshell: A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!,1374192000,9,416,4.635135135135135
