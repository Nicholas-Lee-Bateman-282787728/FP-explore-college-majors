4860583,5,B005QW98NM,"This is a small compilation of the biggest storms that Josh and Sean and Reed were on before being joined by Tim Samaras. V2 was just getting started at this time and Sean was in TIV1. Still, it is quite compelling to watch, and the bonuses were nice. This makes a nice edition to the series as it does have some nice odds and ends not mentioned in the main series, and the storm videos are definitely worth a look and there is a little less squabbling going on here, as well as one incident where the V2 group had to try to escape one storm they had gotten too close to and it chased them instead.",1410134400,3,598,4.119658119658119

4860588,5,B005QW98NM,"i haven't gotten this movie yet.  this guy is insane lol.  he never gives up on going on these dangerous quests for looking for dangerous tornados in kansas and texas lol.  and so he hears on the weather updates in texas, and then hears if there are any tornado warnings coming up, and then starts going onto these dangerous journeys looking for dangerous tornados.  i recommend this movie to everyone to watch , it's good to learn about these dangerous twisters, that hits certain areas in texas and kansas lol.",1384646400,,512,4.655555555555556
8483861,1,B005QW98NM,"I know this DVD has mostly high ratings but I cannot for the life of me figure out why. The team, except for the radar technician who states he has a doctorate, seem like a bunch of excited children who are just running around yelling with no professionalism at all. I think some Ritalin may do the trick. If you are interested in Storm Chasing this is NOT the DVD to learn from. Your money is better spent elsewhere.",1520467200,,417,4.291139240506329
