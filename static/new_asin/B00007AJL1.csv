He always wanted to work in a bank, but had no banking experience. He watched this DVD everyday to build up his confidence and faith. Using the principles learned through Pastor Jakes in the DVD, he went from teller to branch manager in four years!!!! Even though this was about 7 years ago, I remembered this DVD the other day because I, too, need a career boost. As a high school teacher, I am sensing the grace lifting off of me, urging me to make some changes. Determined to not overstay my assignment, I purchased this video. Immediately, I feel a shift in my thought processes, my confidence, and my excitement. I know my advancement is around the corner and I am extremely thrilled about it. I will Maximize this Moment! Thank you Pastor Jakes and thank you Jesus!!! If you are in a similar situation, or you just know that this is your ""Season of Victory,"" this DVD is so necessary.
