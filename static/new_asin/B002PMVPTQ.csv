3965309,5,B002PMVPTQ,"Been looking for this movie for a week now and for some odd reason Amazon is the only one that carries it that I could find. I ""Unboxed"" it and went nuts !! This movie wowed me from the get go. Has everything that a slasher film should have. Gore, gratuitous sex, gore, partying, gore, dead teenagers and did I mention gore ?? So what if it ain't an award winning movie. Most of the suck anyways. Rule #1 if you can keep my attention for 90 minutes then you must be doing something right. Loved the storyline, loved the acting loved the gore scenes ... in fact the only complaint that I have is the fact that I blew $9.99 on the download when I should have just bought the DVD outright (which is what I'm doing after the holidays).",1259193600,3,731,4.191489361702128
3965310,5,B002PMVPTQ,"Blood Night is just a great old school horror film. While we are getting set up for the fun stuff there is plenty of funny scenes and T & A. When the fun does begin it's bloody and brutal. While I agree it is not a perfect film I was not expecting one and the film makers passion for the genre made up for any rough edges. Danielle Harris was great in it as was Bill Moseley, two names familiar to horror fans everywhere.",1258675200,,421,4.023809523809524
3965311,3,B002PMVPTQ,"Personally, I thought this movie was just ok. I'm not too much of a stickler for how realistic effects look in horror movies unless they look absolutely terrible, so I don't have too much to complain about as far as that goes.  However I am very picky about the pacing in horror movies, and that is one of my problems with this movie. It pulls you in right at the beginning and then spends the next 45 minutes setting up a story that ultimately drags the movie to what feels like a complete standstill before it picks back up again. Also, the ""twist"" near the end of the movie is one you can see coming from a mile away. I feel that they could have done a much better job misdirecting the viewer so the twist had a much better payoff when it came down to it. In the end though, my biggest problem with this movie is the ""Too gory for theaters"" and taglines like that. If you build your movie up to be a non-stop splatterfest and one of the goriest movies to date you damn sure better back it up, but Blood Night does not. Not to say it isn't a gory movie, but this would be a straight up ""R"" rating by the MPAA, not even a hard ""R"". All this being said however, Blood Night isn't a bad movie at all, I think I just bought into the marketing campaign and some of the ""planted"" reviews as another reviewer put it and ended up a little disappointed. Starring horror vet Bill Moseley(Devil's Rejects, Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2) and Danielle Harris(4 of the Halloween movies,) and an ample supply of T & A, Blood Night is a middle of the road horror movie trying to recapture the feel of the 80's slasher flick. While I must give credit for not being a remake, I think things could have been done a little better. Hopefully the director learns from some of the problems with this movie, I really would like to see what he could do with a bigger budget and a little more experience. I would give Blood Night 2.5 stars out of 5. Apparently you can only order this through amazon or directly from the film's official website, and as long as they are charging 15 to 20 bucks, i'd keep my money. But if you can grab a copy for 5 or 10 bucks, give it a shot.",1257984000,7,2147,4.185990338164252
3965312,4,B002PMVPTQ,"Blood Night ""The Legend Of Mary Hatchet""

This movie starts off full speed ahead  with a flashback of young Mary murdering her family in their home, action and gore galore.

Flash to the mental institution some years later  where Mary is being held because she cant  stand trial due to reasons of insanity.

Enter a fat gross mental ward worker who is taunting Mary asking her if she wants to ""in his words"" Goo Goo Gaa Gaa his Loli Pop..
She is raped and a child is conceived.

The  staff informs Mary that her child died during childbirth after that Mary breaks loose and kills the staff ,after the carnage she is standing out front of the institution holding the severed head of the man who raped her ,is gunned down and killed by the police.

Now flash to what they call Blood night where teenagers celebrate the night that Mary killed her family.

You have a bunch of obnoxious teens talking about their penises ,getting laid and terrorizing people with eggs,tampons dipped in red paint and other delightful gifts. The parts that are suppose to be funny actually are ..There is a lot of female flesh for the guys to drool over and that adds to the retro feel.

The middle slows down quite a bit and I got a little disinterested but it picks back up again when Graveyard Gus played by ""Bill Moseley"" of The Devils Rejects and House of 1000 Corpses fame shows up and takes the remaining teens to the mental institution to reunite Mary with her dead baby because he was the one who knows where the box like coffin was buried. There is a twist but I saw it coming a mile away as for the gore it's pretty old school and over the top..Danielle Harris of Halloween franchise fame has quite an interesting role in this movie as well.

Some of the gore is well done some of it not done so well. As a slasher lover not affiliated with the film in any way I would say give it a watch It's pretty good..""The piano in the soundtrack sounded a bit like a rip off of Adam Greens Hatchet,but that's just my opinion.

It won't make my top 10 of the year but it's worth being in my collection and I'm sure I will pull it out again one night and watch it again..",1257724800,11,2148,4.300248138957817
3965313,4,B002PMVPTQ,"I got a chance to go to the screening of the film last year and it was a blast!!  It reminded me of the old horror 'scream' flicks of the 70s and 80s, with all of the terror and guts, plus more fun and games!  There is nothing held back and the audience is kept hanging on to their seats, plus the music was pretty damn creepy.  I can't wait to see it again.",1254268800,25,358,3.810810810810811

The introduction of the characters is incredibly overlong, and before any of the action even starts you really don't care about any of them. Bill Moseley and Danielle Harris seem completely wasted for the most part, and the camera shots are amateurish and frenetic. The menstruation story line (yes you read that right) was completely pointless and comedic. It almost seemed like the movie was in two parts, like there were two separate movies combined. Finally the characters are completely inept and idiotic, you have a murderer that can barely swing the weapon they're holding at yet the multitude of guys couldn't team up to take the killer down.

3965351,2,B002PMVPTQ,"Why can't horror filmmakers invest more in smart scripts. ""Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet"" was an unoriginal, recycled, clich horror story with the same horny, alcoholic party freaks getting their up comings. The killer secretly attacks each couple, one by one, until everyone discovers the real killer's identity; then by huge coincidence, the unbeknownst killer suddenly attacks everyone all at once. By the end of the movie, the party freaks are so annoying, you actually root for the killer to slaughter them and shut them up!

3965352,2,B002PMVPTQ,"There are two words that got me to watch this film: Bill Moseley. As he ties with Steve Buscemi as my favorite character actor, I felt the need to watch ""Blood Night"" on the grounds of his top billing. Moseley, as always, delivers a great performance, odd, quirky, and a tad over the top, though this role was a bit of a departure, with his playing a good guy. Likewise, the special effects and makeup work were just plain gorgeous, especially for the apparent budget. However, this is where the film's virtues run out. Th plot is terrible, the acting (apart from Moseley) is horrendous, and the dialogue is just...no. There's ""B"" movie, and then there's just too bad to justify, and this one falls into the latter category.",1367798400,2,724,4.62015503875969

3965364,2,B002PMVPTQ,"This is about as ugly, lurid and mean spirited a movie as I've ever seen. Its target audience is apparent and that's even scarier than the movie.

Here's the scoop. Mary Hatchet is a disturbed young girl. She kills mom and dad, enters an institution and becomes pregnant after being raped by one of the guards. The baby is ""lost"" during childbirth and Mary goes on a murder spree killing many of the staff members. She escapes only to be gunned down by the police. She becomes such a celebrity the town has a ""Blood Night"" each year commemorating the night she murdered her folks. This year, her ghost comes back and kills some teens celebrating Blood Night.

Like I said, this is some ugly stuff. There are a couple of female characters that are only mildly annoying but everyone else is a low-rent loser. They refer to women as bitches, drink, have sex, insult one another and talk in ghetto-ese, as though this is how they intend to spend the rest of their lives. There is no wittiness, intelligence or kindness in the lot. There is no one to root for. No hero. No loner who doesn't want to join the lot but finally jumps in to save them from themselves. Just a bunch of strokes.

And the killings are run of the mill. None are inspired or clever. All you get are some of the yawning, jump scare red herrings, bountiful nudity, drinking till you puke garbage that any moron could write. Some of the shots look as though they were comic book panels and the colors were often over-saturated. The director actually looked as though he knew his way around a camera. Why would he squander his talent on this trash.

I know slasher films are a genre that have been around for a long time. Shouldn't those making these films at least try to explore it as opposed to just making the same old same old?

Unless you need to see every slasher film ever made, I'd give this one wide berth.",1364256000,3,1880,4.421965317919075

3965367,5,B002PMVPTQ,"Today's offering of horror films has been known to be very hit-or-miss. Some 2000's horror films are great, other make you want to claw your own eyes out. Fortunately, in a time of such extremes, ""Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet"" takes us back to the golden era of horror films with a modern-day intensity to make for a movie that truly impressed me.

This movie goes for the throat straight from the getgo, with bloodsoaked mutilation, great eerie and atmospheric location, graphic nudity and a disturbing rape scene within the first 15 minutes. The film then goes into classic teenage debauchery in a suburban area, and it's done in such a classic manner. The whole film rolls really smoothly with a nice blend of full-on gore, sexual indulgence and ironic humor. Then of course, let's not forget that we have horror heavyweights Danielle Harris and Bill Moseley thrown in.

Overall, I thought this was a great horror film that's definitely more than just a one-time watch. The only thing I'd complain about is how they chose to end it, but a lot of horror films end in a similar manner so that's sort of a dead issue. Either way, for a highly entertaining slasher film packed with sex and gore, this will be one wild ride! Thanks for the time and peace.",1318204800,,1264,4.638392857142857
3965368,1,B002PMVPTQ,"The opening sequence, before the credits even roll, gave me some hope that this would indeed be something I'd like to add to my collection of slasher films.
Unfortunately, after the credits do begin to roll, it's as if another director took over and proceeded to ruin everything that had looked so promising only minutes before.  Suddenly, we're mistreated to the gathering of a group of nitwits all giggling like hyenas, carrying on like buffoons (no wonder their clique was so exclusive, who would want to hang out with these dopes?).  At that point the movie ground to a halt, veering off on a tangent as this gang wanders aimlessly, hangs out, yap and yap and yap some more.  Someone got the bright, but unoriginal, idea to play with an Ouija Board in a cemetery.  Then a creepy guy pops up and tells them a boring ghost story.  What momentum they started with is now gone because it's party time!  Everyone gets drunk, sex ensues, dancing follows....I kept asking myself, because at this point I wasn't certain; this is a horror movie, isn't it?  It's as though they forgot the genre and decided instead to make an update of Porky's.  It took forever before the story finally drifted back to the matter at hand.  By then, however, I'd lost interest and nothing they did after that could change my mind.  Worse.  When the (no surprise) killer is abruptly revealed, it's such a laughable revelation all I could think was, how stupid are you people, there's more of you and just the killer.  Band together and put a stop to it!  But no, they preferred to run and scream and separate like the idiots they are.  The sad part of all this is that they were such obnoxious twits I couldn't wait to see them killed in the most gruesome fashion possible, anything just to shut them up!  You want shocking deaths; go after characters that are lovable.  No one cares if a creep loses their head.  It also didn't help that the killer was itty bitty and wore noisy boots.

Unsatisfactory on all levels, a botched effort.  Not a keeper.",1309564800,5,2026,4.5777777777777775
3965369,2,B002PMVPTQ,"If you follow my reviews you know I'm a pretty big horror movie fan. So for me the thing that drew me into this movie was the fact that Bill Moseley & Danielle Harris were in it. But really that's all this movie has going for it. I figured if those two were in it, chances were the movie had a higher budget then those low budget ""school project"" films. But I was wrong.

3965370,1,B002PMVPTQ,"The slasher genre has become one of horror's most abused formats.  BLOOD NIGHT is a prime example.  Lazy and inept, the movie uses a lengthy middle portion to focus on the obnoxious teens soft porn celebration of the titular ""holiday.""  None of the characters are given any real identities and the actors left 17 years before.  The menstrual connection is hilariously vulgar and the excessive gore merely repugnant.  Goof alert:  When Mary Hatchet kills her parents, it's supposed to be in 1972 and newspaper headlines say Mary was 12 yrs old.  In the present, her tombstone gives her date of birth as 1967 which made her 5 and definitely pre-menstrual.

Group of kids do something they think is a joke, drinking, sex and death occur.  This is a movie type that has been done to death and is starting to wear out I think.  Acting is not the best, but most of the actors are in the movie because of thier looks anyway.  Very gory and bloody, but not any worse then other movies like this. If you like the typical ""Friday The 13th"" slasher movies then this is for you.  Overall nothing too exciting, you can only watch so many movies like this before it becomes repetitive.

3965374,1,B002PMVPTQ,"You ever notice that when a movie totally sucks, the creators were ""not taking themselves too seriously"" and it was the viewer who just didn't seem to get it?  Or if it's ""fun"", that sort of implies we are supposed to cut it some slack if overall feel of the movie is fecal?  Blood Night could have been so much more.  At the center is a nice little urban legend about this crazy woman, Mary, who is blown away by police after she goes on a rampage at the mental hospital she was kept in.  Sadly, this isn't dwelled upon as much as the rest of the movie's focus shifts to a bunch of teens, so inconsequential with their bad acting that half of them aren't even given names, who decide to party it on down at one of their homes.  Bill Mosley is in it!----for all of about 4 minutes or so.  He tells a half-baked ghost story, delivers a tidbit of information, then ends up not even being able to dodge a pickaxe swung slowly at him from 5 feet away.  Yes, it was one of those movies.
Though they wouldn't have been too original, there could have still been some nice scary tense moments to have been milked from the bottle situation of being trapped in a house with a very violent killer circling the outside about to dispatch everyone.  Instead, the movie dwells upon meaningless (and extended) sex scenes and booty shaking.  Admittedly, promising your friends an honest to god film reel version of Attack of the Killer Tomatoes and then switching it out for an old-school seventies skin flick was a stroke (no pun there...) of genius.  As for the dispatches themselves, they are gory and nasty, and when they come, but also sparse when you consider the movie as a whole-it all ends up coming fast and furious.  Between the editing and jerky camera work, you will probably be left wondering what the heck you just saw.  Ironically, as fast moving as the camera work is when the violence comes, the victims move with nothing less that deer in the headlights speed.  Seeing these kids bleating around trying to do something made me wonder if Jason, Michael and Freddy must not've imagined themselves at some point to be on a nice quiet sheep farm sometimes while they were going about their business.

If your still reading this review then you like myself have had the fortunate(or unfortunate)pleasure of viewing many good, bad & great examples of this sub-genre. We all have different opinions and appreciate different flavors, but we who enjoy this kind of film mostly have common expectations or similar standards when it comes to what makes a keeper. My favorite kind of slasher films are the ones that succeed in keeping you scared and on the edge of your seat until the credits role, but unfortunately they don't make those kind as often as I'd like. My second favorite kind are far more common and these are the ones that are fun, silly & sexy with a hint of fear and a healthy dose of blood & gore. Blood Night: the Legend of Mary Hatchet falls perfectly into this second catagory. While the film is easily more predictable & fun than it is scary it does at times muster up some creepy atmosphere and the acting is above average in some areas wich helps the movie along in its slower moments. What I enjoyed most though were the spurts of colorful direction and visual shout outs to old school film making. Highly recommended if your a fan of this stuff!",1290124800,6,1208,4.541284403669724

3965381,2,B002PMVPTQ,"This movie failed to satisfy any expectations of seeing a great horror movie where a female focus as the main killer in a slasher film might be a breath of fresh air... unfortunately, you get the typical naked girl with a knife thing that will draw the attention of teenage boys and perverts, but there is no way in hell I will ever give a high rating because someone in a movie showed their boobs.

The backstory seemed decent, but a-typical... a little girl in her childhood is shown killing her parents, so she ends up in a mental home, where later in life she is raped and had a daughter, only to be told her baby didn't survive the birth... she's then killed, and we skip to 20 years later, the town is celebrating Blood Night, in celebration of Mary's death... ok, wait, stop, enough telling you about this direct copy of Halloween 6... so, the typical dumb teenagers get together with no adult supervision, engage in some booze, sex and laughs... until the lights go out and they are picked off one by one.

If you are newly exposed to horror movies, or the type of idiot who only watches movies that have just been made while thinking ""old movies are just OLD and uncool"" then you might find this movie enjoyable... but to me, i've seen so many horror movies now, i'm just completely sick and tired of the teenager doing stupid things and dieing for it, and to make it worse, there is even a graveyard caretaker who warns them of danger... come on, enough is enough, this cliche has been done a million times before, and it's time to come up with something better then just a bunch of filmmakers paying homage to Halloween, Friday The 13th and all the other movies they love... just, enough already, ok, it's been done to death, and so has this ""surprise ending twist"" nonsense that started with the 6th sense, and has been dumbed down in too many movies since.

I'm all for a female star of the red screen to make a name for herself, but after watching this film, Mary doesn't even hold a candle to Carrie.... hopefully one day someone will do it right and be somewhat original about it.",1280880000,,2096,4.438961038961039
3965382,4,B002PMVPTQ,"This movie is bloody!  I mean, really bloody.  It's also fun, and for the genre, fairly well written and acted.  Now, remember I said for the genre.  This ain't Oscar material, but for what it sets out to do, it does and does it with gusto.  Heads go flying, people are split in half... You get my drift.  Still, the victims are all fun to watch even when they aren't running around screaming, which is a plus since you spend a good chunk of time with them before the slashing starts.

Now, why am I not giving this five stars?  The overall tone of the film is fairly goofy and over the top, yet early on in the film we are presented with a very nasty, disturbing rape scene.  Yes, the scene does play into the story.  Yes, the result of it is important, but at the same time, the seriousness of that particular scene and the complete lack of seriousness in the rest of the film do not mesh, and end up leaving a very nasty taste in the audiences mouth.

That one scene aside, the film is a bloody mess of a good time.  Just be ready to be disturbed early on.",1277683200,2,1059,4.137254901960785

It feels like and old Friday the 13th or Halloween.  All the story and action takes place in several locations keeping things interesting.

3965397,3,B002PMVPTQ,"I ordered ""Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet"" from amazon.com, and upon its arrival I slid it into my DVD player for my first showing.  I agree with most of the critiques thus far for the reasons given out, so this is my take on certain scenes, why they do or don't work, and how the ones that don't work could have been improved upon.  Perhaps some aspiring film-maker will read this and get some ideas for what not to do in making a slasher/horror movie.

The opening sequences are frightening enough, but they don't make much sense.  The villain of the film, twelve-year-old Mary, appears at the very beginning of the movie to be incredibly disturbed and it is difficult to believe that her mother, who comes into her daughter's room to brush her hair, doesn't notice Mary's spooky catatonic behavior.  If I were a parent and I found my kid acting like that, you'd better believe I'd see that something was wrong.

The next thing that happens is Mary's mother waking up to the sound of breaking glass and going to investigate, finding a trail of blood leading to the bathroom, which is streaked all over with blood.  Mary's mom is understandably frightened and she immediately goes to check on her daughter, who for reasons never explained stabs her mother in the eye with a large kitchen knife.  Then Mary proceeds to murder her father with a hatchet to the face, giving him a much wider smile than he probably would have liked for family photographs.  Inexplicably, despite having had a huge knife embedded in her eye, Mary's mother is somehow still alive and has crawled down the stairs, reached the phone, and is dialing 911 to get out one last scream before Mary comes down to finish her off.

Flash forward from 1978, when the initial murders take place, to 1989, when Mary is grown.  She is confined to a mental hospital, and for reasons still not given she is huddled in her room at night stark naked.  A guard, stereotypically fat and creepy, comes into her room and brutally rapes her, leaving Mary pregnant.  She gives birth, and the child is ""revealed"" to have died.  Then, again inexplicably, Mary manages to get out of her room and with her bare hands proceeds to slaughter the entire staff.  She is gunned down outside by a pair of police officers who arrive on scene to find her naked and holding the torn off head of her rapist.  They shoot her after she throws the head at the squad car's windshield, breaking it.

The rest of the film I won't give away, but the other reviews reveal enough about the plot without giving too much away that they are very helpful.  Suffice to say that if you enjoy slasher films with huge amounts of blood and boobs, this is the one for you.  The setup scenes for the film's homicidal ghost, all of which takes place before the opening credits even roll, kind of drag out but the remaining setups in which the rest of the characters are introduced make up for it by being well paced.  Not too much time or information is given about these disposables, rather, just enough is given to make you give your sympathy or your dislike.  Then the killing begins.

What I want to focus on are the story flaws that are rampant throughout the opening scenes.  The first and most glaring I have pointed out: Mary's strangely unnoticed odd behavior.  It's never really explained why her mother doesn't notice it, although it is implied by this failure to see what's going on that perhaps it is nothing new; Mary seems already to be very disturbed, and one gets the impression that her mothers already knows this.  But if that's so, then why is her subsequent violent behavior such a shock?

Then we have all that blood in the bathroom.  Someone who has bled that much simply isn't going to have the strength to murder two grown people no matter how unawares they are taken, especially if she's only twelve.  It's suggested that Mary's menstrual cycle is somehow involved, that it has gone into overdrive making her incredibly homicidal and -- again without explanation -- giving her superhuman strength.  Special effects allow the viewer the implication that is may be the result of demonic or some other form of supernatural possession, but again we are given no other hints that this is what's behind the movie's gruesome events.

Then we're supposed to believe that a woman who has had a large knife driven through her eye and into her skull, with all that damage shown, was able to survive long enough to get down the stairs (albeit half crawling, half slipping), pick up the telephone, dial 911, and manage any kind of coherent words before Daughter Dearest comes down to finish her off?  I realize that in slasher films a certain amount of disbelief must be suspended, but this is a bit much.

Now, here is where things get really bizarre.  It's eleven years later, and Mary is next shown huddling naked in the middle of her room in the mental hospital.  A fat, ugly, creep of a guard walks by during his rounds, leers at her through the window making really creepy baby-talk, then enters the room and proceeds to rape her.  If Mary is possessed of supernatural strength, as is suggested in the opening murder sequences and in the scenes immediately following, why doesn't she have it to fight off her attacker?  Between her rape and her violent childbirth, Mary's doctors observe her behavior, and after she has the baby, she is informed rather coldly that her child is dead.  Now, I admit that I don't know how real-life mental hospitals are staffed or how the personnel behave toward patients, but one would think that they'd show a bit more compassion toward someone who was brutally raped while in their care -- especially when the following scenes of murder suggest that he was never caught much less punished.

Which leads us to the next logical questions: how does Mary get out of her room?  Again, supernatural forces are implied as she literally twists the neck of a nurse with her bare hands and then goes on to kill everyone else in the building, all completely unarmed.  Obviously someone got in a phone call to the police before being killed, but the authorities must not have taken it very seriously because only one squad car arrives on the scene.  By that time Mary is already walking outside, stark naked, carrying the head of her rapist in her hands in a crotch-covering position.  The officers draw their guns on her and order her down on the ground or they'll open fire, but it's clear that isn't going to happen,  She throws the head at the car's windshield, crunching it, then screams like a banshee before the two cops shoot her down.  Now, this scene being in 1989 or 1990, tasers weren't in wide circulation, but one would think that when faced with an obviously unarmed naked suspect, guns would be the second thing drawn.  (Nightsticks would be the first.)  No attempt to take Mary alive is made.  If the cops realized how violent she was that they felt the need to use lethal force as the first resort, why weren't more called out?  Yes, the film is low-budget and had to make do with what it had, but still...

And this is all before the film's credits even start rolling.  Flashes of newspaper headlines as those play reveal Mary's young age at the time she murdered her parents, which render the crimes all the more implausible considering her hyper-menstrual cycle is supposed to have caused profuse bleeding that would likely drop someone fully grown.

Shots of doctors' reports during the opening credits reveal that the driving force given as explanation for Mary's homicidal tendencies is Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder, which is supposed to cause violent mood swings and intense bleeding.  Mary is prone to violent fits of rage during her violent menstrual cycle, which makes the apparent lack of security both before and after her rape and subsequent childbirth so much more puzzling.  Either the reports were exaggerated or we're looking at one of the most incompetent mental hospital staff in cinematic history.  At least in John Carpenter's original fright fest, ""Halloween,"" it's explained that the killer was catatonic for fifteen years and lulled the staff into complacency.

Once this setup is out of the way, the rest of the movie unfolds as typical 80s-style slasher fare, with a lot of blood, gore, and bare breast shots to titillate viewers.  When the murders begin happening, it's suggested that Mary's demonic spirit manifests from time to time to murder the unwary upon whom she comes across.  The revelation as to the killer's identity is disappointingly not as surprising as the writers would have had us believe, and it's a bit insulting considering what was established earlier in the film.  As I have written, supernatural forces are implied to be at work, which would explain a lot more if it were presented in a better fashion than was ultimately done.

Having said all this, I did find the movie enjoyable once I buried my 'what-the-hell' impulses.  The special effects were actually good, being a combination of old school makeup and latex complemented with CGI that seems to have been done by professionals.  Most CGI these days is done by sloppy amateurs who don't care much about making it look realistic, but here the emphasis was on CGI as simply an enhancing component of traditional SFX media.  Clearly, the film-makers cared enough about their audiences to at least make their FX look realistic even if the story itself was lacking.  The humor was done in all the right places, giving pause between moments of tension without going over the top or coming across as pretentious.  And the acting was superb; horror icons Bill Moseley and Danielle Harris lend additional power to an already talented cast of lesser-known actors and actresses.

For what is stated as a first time effort, ""Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet"" isn't nearly as bad as it could have been, though it does fail to reach the level to which it aspired.  If director Frank Sabatella, who is given writing credit with Elke Blasi, can use this as a learning experience and tighten up his storytelling, I think he'll go far in the genre.  Only time will tell.",1268438400,,10151,4.707413695529145

One other note: I think the visual storytelling (for lack of another way to put it) really stand out. The special effects, lighting, editing, storytelling, and even the music are exceptional for what is apparently a fairly low budget project by a first-time director. There's talent on display here, and I suspect (and hope) we'll see more from the creative team in coming years.",1264982400,,659,4.584745762711864

This one is about a town that is still celebrating the deaths of many one night, 20 years ago when Mary Hatchett (Who has a rare psychosis condition where when she menstuates, she becomes unstable and homocidal) went loose on her parents and then on the local mental asylum that locked her up. After her murderous rampage she was shot down and the town lives her story like their own 'Halloween' celebrating it once a year and running around with Mary masks etc. Then one year, it all starts again. A group of teenagers are harrassed by a killer that show the same MO as Mary but Mary is dead.... or is she?

This one has loads of cheesy 80's moments. It is like watching an old 80's slasher thats been 90'd up! And look, it works. You got some good scares, some good kills, some creepy moments. Not huge on the character development but not necessarily bad either. It honestly is an entertaining little flick and I am glad I got it and I did enjoy it.

3965402,4,B002PMVPTQ,"In recent years, the horror genre has been plagued by more duds than gems. For every decent slasher film, there are scores of movies that barely deserve a second glance, much less a full viewing.

  The reason for this is a conflict of interests that rarely compromise with each other. On one end, we have low budgeted movies that try to bring us back to the golden age of horror(circa the 1970s and 1980s) with their gritty kill-shots, fountains of blood, and enough bare breasts to make Hugh Hefner blush. On the other end we have high-gloss production houses putting out cookie-cutter horror stories, many with the dreaded PG-13 stamp.

  With the release of Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet, we are given the best of both worlds; a movie made by fans(in horror afficionado/director Frank Sabatella), for fans, and with a dynamic production value to capture the guts, glory, and breasts, of the film for a stellar visual effect.

  The story is as follows: A young girl named Mary Mattock(played by Patricia Raven) butchers her family for no apparent reason. We later learn that this is due to a physiological problem called Menstrual Dysphoric Disorder which makes PMS look like a walk in the park. The young woman(now played by Samantha Facchi) is sent to the King's Park Psychiatric Hospital, where she is raped by a hospital night-guard. She becomes pregnant, but loses the baby in child-birth. This brings on another intense bout of MDD in which she slaughters what seems to be all staff and patients at the hospital, and is gunned down by police.

  The story brings us to the present, where high school kids celebrate that night of butchery by calling it Blood Night, and proceeding to paint the town red in a night of vandalism and excessive partying. The movie focuses on one group of kids, who decide to visit Mary Mattock, or as she is now known as Mary Hatchet, at her grave, and unknowingly release the ghost to wreck vengeance once again. One by one, the group is dispatched in various, high impact slaughterings, as they try to lay the spirit to rest.

  Sounds simple? It's not, but who am I to ruin it for you?

  This movie lacks in nothing for entertainment. The kill-shots are highly detailed, thanks to the superb special effects of Monster in My Closet special effects artist Jeremy Selenfriend and Harrington Talents virtual effects artist John Morena. Dismemberments, spinal readjustments, and blood washes all become intensely realistic by utilizing Selenfriend's definitive prop functions, from custom sculpted heads(and brains) to mouth interiors. To make sure these effects lack nothing on-screen, Morena utilized digital enhancements to help make the kill-shots pop off the screen with the addition of blood enhancements that were shot seperately, and then transcribed into the final edit. With these talented artists and the fantastic camera-work, the film popped off the screen, much to the glee of fans of gore.

  There is humor interlaced into the horror, as well. Graveyard Gus(played by Bill Moseley) is nothing short of the drunken graveyard-keeper who drinks way too much whiskey and yaps about Vietnam. A conversation about Tom Jones between Alex(played by Nate Dushku) and Chris(played by Anthony Marks) had me giggling out loud. A male virgin wiping his brow with a pink, ""Princess"" pillow while getting frisky with a hot chick? This movie has it. The comedy is just enough to help the viewer fall into the comfort trap before being shown a decapitated head flying across a room. By balancing these bits of comedy into the horror, the bar of suspense is raised, because you never become too jaded by seeing an overflow of gore. Not that either way would be bad, but for Blood Night, comic relief makes the suspense grow. And lets not forget Eric(played by Billy Magnussen), who is the pinnacle of every sex-crazed high school guy we've ever known.

  What's amazing is that all of these actors and actresses are able to turn their clown routines off when director Frank Sabatella calls for it, with great results of suspense. Let us not forget that scream-princess Danielle Harris, playing her part impeccably in the storyline as the knee-socked Alyssa, who can never seem to hold her liquor and brings back some intense stories of her time in school.

  So what defines this movie beyond all others? High production, an extremely gifted cast, and intense kill-shots, all embedded into a suspenseful story-line where even if you think you know what is going on, you really don't. At the same time it's just good, head-jerking fun, a horror movie with serious overtones, but doesn't take itself too seriously. Think Wes Craven's Scream meets Lucio Fulci's The House By the Cemetary, and out of that seemingly scandalous affair comes its offspring, Blood Night: The Legend of Mary Hatchet.",1260230400,17,4838,4.933415536374846
