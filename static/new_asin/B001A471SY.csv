8326249,3,B001A471SY,"Fugitive Rage had an ok story line but the acting was subpare even for a B rated movie. It was disjointed and completely corny in spots. It was a t and a movie but that was it. If you like t and a with no substance then buy or rent. Personnally not my cup of tea. Merchant of Death had a nice story line, pretty good acting and lots of gunfire. Overall you should just get Merchant of Death. It is a good movie.",1336262400,,411,3.9047619047619047
