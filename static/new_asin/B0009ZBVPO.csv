2343896,4,B0009ZBVPO,"This film may contain more information for those who already know the terrible things the government is hiding. It should also, however, awaken the uninformed person to at least reopen their minds against the propaganda initially heard that day. The misinformation lies in the story U.S. citizens were  originally told, that no connection exists between the terrorists and members within our government.

  Military drills are practiced ""live"" many times before they are performed at the fatal level; and the ""technology"" sectors of our government ultimately contribute to the subliminal (etc.) aspects of these games.

  As much as I've learned, I learned another significant fact; that a similar act involving airplanes was participated in on September 12, 1970. Through all of this I've learned to expect different events when looking at the calendar, because the people involved (within our government) use code to such a repetitious extent that the old perspective is too naive anymore.",1147737600,7,991,5.396103896103896
2343897,4,B0009ZBVPO,"While much of the information in this DVD has been in the public knowledge (at least that of the community who refuses to accept our governments story re: 9/11) for a few years now (this was made before the Iraqi war, I think), the dvd will serve as a good starting place for those with questions about what occured in 2001. Which is not remotely what your government wants you to believe.

9/11 is the foundation of all the rotten to the core actions that Bush and his minions have persued since. To not investigate this, or ask relevant questions, is to give up your rights as a citizen. Which is exactly what those in power have always wanted from their subjects.",1128988800,35,666,4.459016393442623

2343906,5,B0009ZBVPO,"It is another 911 DVD.  I bought the National Geographic one, the CNN one and many more...I think these DVD's represent many facts and you will have to decide which way to believe...conspiracy or terrorism...another point of view.",1207094400,,230,5.052631578947368
2343907,3,B0009ZBVPO,"This video is fine as a short and sweet introduction to 9/11 issues, but leaves informed viewers asking ""where's the beef?"" A far superior film addressing similar testimony that I would rate a ""4"" is ""9/11: Press for Truth"" which again, I would say is important, but ""introductory,"" material that illustrates the sham of the 9/11 Commission. Two ""five-star"" DVDs after this are ""911: In Plane Site"" and ""9/11 Mysteries: Part 1: Demolitions,"" both of which will rock your world with hard evidence not only of negligence and foreknowledge by powers in ""high places,"" but circumstantially point to the disturbing reality of lies, fabrication, and collusion. Follow these up with Alex Jones' ""Terrorstorm"" and/or ""Martial Law 9-11: Rise of the Police State"" and you'll get a fairly complete picture of the ""why?"" behind the truth. Jones' alarmist tone can be annoying, but his research and conclusions are pretty solid--as I said, he provides a ""big picture"" look at the global politics and purpose for orchestrating such an event. Also, related to 9/11 for those interested in the history and future of Islamic terrorism, politics and prophecy pertaining to war in the Middle East, read Dave Hunt's ""Judgment Day! Islam, Israel, and the Nations,"" and view the DVD, ""Israel, Islam, and Armageddon.""",1189036800,2,1294,5.137440758293839
2343908,5,B0009ZBVPO,I am intrigued by this short DVD about the effect that 9/11 has played on the american psyche. it is informative and leaves you wondering about the quesions posed and the bills that have passed through the senate. It has certainly opened up a new area in the living world about what our governments are doing to protect us or themselves?,1185062400,,337,4.540983606557377
2343909,5,B0009ZBVPO,"It is essential to watch not just the movie, but the special features on this DVD; all of them. While there is a lot more information out in the world and on the Internet regarding 9/11 and the truth that dare not speak its name, much of it is concentrated on this DVD. From here, with computer links, one can explore as far and wide as the eye (and heart) can see.

We all should be asking these questions - and it is upon us as American citizens to be demanding answers, while our citizenship still means anything at all!

2343911,3,B0009ZBVPO,"First I want to say that the shipping and service was first rate.  This movie was OK, but it was not the movie I thought I was ordering. That is no fault of the seller. There is another that is more informative that I still have not located.  This one is good as a warm-up to one I saw at a friends home.  This movie is thought provoking, but it is a toned down version of the other whose title I am not sure of.",1170720000,,412,3.823529411764706

2343914,1,B0009ZBVPO,"Just another, yet not so pointed attempt of conspiracy thugs dwelling on ""tweaked"" and downright falsified information.  As stated earlier, conspiracies are born every minute.

Suggestion...don't let a ridiculous flick like this brainwash you.  Do you own homework and come to your own conclusions.  I already have and they aren't close to what you'll see in this film.  Save your money.

Disgusting.",1159142400,12,400,5.370967741935484

There's a conspiracy theory born every minute. Don't actually pay for them though.

On the plus side, it's a lot more entertaining than Al Gore's flick. And probably more believeable!",1156809600,12,325,4.684210526315789
2343916,5,B0009ZBVPO,"This is perfect for the person whom went out and bought the 911 commission report at their local book store and said thats that. There are glaring omissions in our governments time by time analysis of that day. Why? I don't know & this DVD won't tell you. It just gives you a list of Commonly asked questions relating to 911, and outlines each question in detail for your own introspective thought. It does not tell you what to think, it just asks the questions you yourself probably all ready asked but they do it in concise clarifying detail. If your looking for a conspiracy movie this is not it, it only asks really, really great questions that as of yet have not been answered.",1154995200,18,682,4.464
2343917,5,B0009ZBVPO,"This is a great DVD. Even if not all of his ideas are accurate, the evidence he presents definitly proves, at least to me, that at least there is more to the story than the goverment has told us. I have seen alot of plane crashes and yet too see an entire plane burn up completely, where were the wings to the ""plane"" that hit the pentagon. The hole in the pentagon is a perfect circle no extra's on the side and if they fell off when it hit the pentagon we should have seen them but I've seen no evidence of this.",1153267200,7,514,4.0
