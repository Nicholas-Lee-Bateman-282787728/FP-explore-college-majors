7915968,5,B00002NDLK,"Although produced over 10 years ago, this amazing series still ranks as one of my all time favourite animes. Even if you have never watched a Gundam anime before, this is highly recommended since it does not assume a  high degree of familiarity with the Gundam universe. Watch it for its  complex character development and egrossing story-line, but make sure you  set aside an entire afternoon because once you start, you won't want to  stop till you finish the entire series.",963878400,,476,4.839506172839506
