3116965,2,B0013LRKS0,"I thought Nora's Hair Salon 2 would have been as entertaining as the original, how wrong was I! This movie didn't hold my interest at all. There are parts that just don't make any sense at all. At one point, I was like ""Okay what was that about?"" Well actually a few times I said this.

I would suggest that you rent this movie instead of buying it.",1211068800,6,349,4.132352941176471

3116996,4,B0013LRKS0,"Nora's nail salon has been handed over to her two nieces, Lilliana (Tatyana Ali) and Simone (Stacey Dash). With a history of not getting along, can the two cousins put their differences aside and come together for the sake of their family's business. If you have seen Nora's Hair Salon you will probably like Nora's Hair Salon 2. The sequel is a light-hearted comedy about two cousins that have different ideas about the salon. One wants to sell the salon the other wants to keep it. If you are in the mood for something easy to watch and want a few laughs along the way Nora's Hair Salon 2 is for you.",1262736000,,602,4.383928571428571

3117000,1,B0013LRKS0,"First of all from the beginning I thought it was stupid to kill off Jennifer Lewis in the first movie, she was the best part of that movie. And this one, well heres what made it terrible

1. The main characters son, he was a terrible actor, I don't care how young he is, he was terrible, all of his scenes were aukward and stupid.
2. Mekhi Phifer's character was nothing but a knock off of Wesly Snipes character in Waiting to Exhale, and completely usless
3. Devin turning into a preacher, PLEASE, that is bull, nothing in the first movie hinted for a second that he was religious,and then in the sequel out of nowhere he's a preacher,DUMB DUMB DUMB.
4. Where's Tamela Jones, she was the 2nd funniest next to Jennifer, and now she's gone, which was another sad thing.",1227916800,3,768,4.408450704225352

8251909,1,B0013LRKS0,"This is just a bunch of forgotten semi-talents in a direct to video mess. The first one was bad, but this one is way worse. It's not funny, the dialogue sounds completely improvised, pretentious and pointlessly preachy. The generic R&B soundtrack is insipid, and is played to cover the lack of actual dialogue. There's a horribly annoying radio DJ who keeps saying ""c-c-c-c-c-c Compton radio"" at various points of the film., and the whole film gives off a racist mean spirited tone, as with many black themed films these days; where all the white people in it are made to look stupid, uncoordinated, foolish, and are subtly put down just for being white - this film is no exception.. Racism is racism, regardless from whom it's coming, and I'm tired of the double standard in so-called black entertainment, especially when disguised under the banner of ""black Christian movies""... The ending is also ridiculous. A proud gay man is the first movie is now a preacher in this one and he says he loved being gay, but loves ""god"" more..Gimme a break, spare me... I do believe there's a third film in this series, but I'm done with this cheap and tacky pandering junk...",1416009600,,1164,4.738916256157635
