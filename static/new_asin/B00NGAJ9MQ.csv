8677901,1,B00NGAJ9MQ,"Wish I could give it less stars. Off/on out-of-focus shots, terrible acting, and three ""stories"" that seem like they were written by a 14-year-old. Worst, though, is showing a kid get stabbed and then the cutting into a pregnant woman's belly -- unnecessary nastiness no one needs to see, ever... It's not scary, just crappy.",1419120000,9,325,4.927272727272728
8677902,1,B00NGAJ9MQ,"Not the worst movie I've ever seen but bad enough.  How bad.  As you watch you keep asking yourself, why am I watching this, I should turn it off.  But, I rented it, maybe it will get better.  Yawn....boy this is incredibly mediocre.  Wince....wow...that there is some bad acting.  I know they are trying to be ironic by intentionally being bad with the acting, but yikes, that is unintentionally bad and they don't know.  It just gets worse and worse until the very end which doesn't bother to make any sense.

The movie commits the ultimate sin.  It's boring.  You can make bad movies.  You can make stupid movies.  You can make movies with horrible acting, giant plot holes with ridiculous stuff people will make fun of years later.

But a boring movie.....you've basically wasted by time.",1418947200,9,792,4.693430656934306
8677903,5,B00NGAJ9MQ,"My search for some new Christmas horror led me to Night Terrors and I'm glad it did. This film deserves a major cult following. For starters, the tagline on the cover of the DVD says ""The return of VHS horror."" That is no joke. I felt like it was 1984 again and I had picked up some obscure tape with an intriguing box from the video store. The look, the feel, the music--the lack of cellphones in the movie--they nailed it. This is how you do a retro horror film.

Night Terrors is actually an anthology film -- three stories with a wraparound about a sister telling her little brother scary stories before he goes to bed.

While I just assumed the entire movie was a Christmas horror film based on the DVD artwork, only the first story is. ""Massacre on 34th Street"" has a guy with an axe, in a Santa suit, wearing a creepy Santa mask, targeting a home of young squatters. We get gory kills and a Santa that just won't seem to die.

The second story, ""Baby Killer,"" is about a man trying to find a cure for his daughter's cancer...using human Guinea pigs. The story starts off slow but gets into seriously disturbing territory that sensitive people may not be able to handle.

The last story rules!!! ""Abstinence"" combines horror comedy, body horror, and infected horror. The two main college dudes are great lovable characters who play off each other perfectly. They can't seem to get lucky, but that's a lucky thing, because all the students who are scoring are getting infected with a nasty skin disease. ""Abstinence"" manages to capture the bad spreading virus feeling of longer movies, delivers plenty of dry humor at the same time, and goes for a few awesomely over-the-top gross out moments.

Night Terrors ends with a quick but creepy conclusion of the wraparound. It's such a great feeling when an indie horror impulse buy totally pays off.",1418083200,6,1849,4.60790273556231
