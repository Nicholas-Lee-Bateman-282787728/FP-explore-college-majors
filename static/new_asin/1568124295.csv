7796865,5,1568124295,"I had gotten away from these workout in favor of bodyweight workouts. I tell you, as you age you really need weights to keep your muscle tone.
I have all the old FIRM tapes and a few on dvd. I gave away all the newer ones, there not the same at all. Very generic moves in the newer/pink ones.  I'll stick with these and FitPrime.",1434412800,,329,4.061538461538461
7796866,5,1568124295,This is one of my favorite Firm workouts.  It really shapes the lower body in a short time.  I wish they would release it on DVD.,1222646400,2,129,3.923076923076923
7796867,4,1568124295,"This workout emphasizes on reshaping your lower body with a variety of exercises, but there is some upper body and ab work as well. You will need a tall box, assorted dumbells and a dowel or broom handle is used for the stretch. Three instructors lead you through this workout, Jennifer Carmen, Taber Bruner and Jennifer Peluso. This workout is part of the Firms Tri-Trainer series, which includes Maximum Body Shaping and Fat Blaster.

After a brief warmup and stretch, you start out with ab work which is not common in videos. Jennifer P leads you through a nice ab routine, some of it including pilates inspired ""breath work"". Then you will move into lower body exercises. Jennifer C. takes you through a set of squats, some of them hover squats where you hold at the bottom. They use the tall box and a 2 x 4 to elevate the heels but you can easily do without the 2 x 4 if you do not have one. Then you will do some side lunges on the right leg, which are rarely seen in the earlier-era Firms, these are done unweighted, though some could add weights to add challenge. Following these you do another set of squats then side lunges on the left side. Then Taber comes in with leg presses working the right leg, you will do one set of 16 reps, followed by a set of tall box climbs, then you will do one more set of leg presses on the right leg.

Upper body work is next with some plyo jumps led by Jen C. You will do some plyo jumps first, then you will do military presses, french presses and bicep curls. More plyo jumps finish out this segment. Jen C sticks around for a bit leading you through a set of squats and leg abductions. You only use a dowel for balance for these. Then you will pick up heavy weights for a set of lunges and dips working the left leg first. You lunge on the left leg and dip with the right, repeat this 6 times then you will do a few dips with pulses. Then you will do a brief set of step squats with smaller range of motion, stepping to one side then the other. After that you will do the same lunge/dip sequence working the right leg. Then it's time for leg presses working the left leg, Jen C. takes you through 16 leg presses, then tall box climbs and then finishing out with 16 more leg presses.

Taber comes in with some hamstring work and rear leg extensions using the tall box for balance, with one arm rows following. Then you repeat this entire sequence on the other side, left or right side isn't specified here so you can choose which side to work first. Following this are some plies squats with some pulsing reps and glute pinches just to add a little more intensity. After this Jen C. comes back to lead you through a set of pushups, she does all of these on her toes as does Jen P.

Jen P. returns for the final segment which is lower body work done on the floor. Table work is first using ankle weights, then you remove your ankle weight and lie on your side and do some pilates inspired leg kick from the front to the back while adding cleansing breaths then you repeat this on the other side. Then Taber returns to stretch you out.

This is a nice workout in 45 minutes, it isn't the hardest workout that the Firm has come out with but it is fun and it works you out nicely. The set is bright and the participants are wearing colorful outfits. The music is more jazzlike which fit the routine nicely. Each instructor did a nice job I thought. I really wish they would release this one on DVD, but unfortunately it has gone out of print. Hopefully they will re-release it in the future as the other 2 are still available.  It really is a good workout.",1110067200,5,3600,4.248175182481752
7796868,4,1568124295,"I am an avid firm user of 6 years and I have always loved this video!  Although it may not be as difficult as some other firm tapes, I find it refreshing, different and fun. I use it at least once a week. I really love the latin music at the begining, and there is a tough floor routine that even advanced exercisers will find difficult!  When I am done with this workout I feel energized and peaceful.  It is a great total body workout as it works the entire upper and lower body. Even if you are an advaced exerciser, it is a great workout to suppliment other firm videos.",1017878400,6,574,4.153153153153153
7796869,3,1568124295,"This is one of the easier Firm tapes.  It's not Total Body either.  Mildly aerobic, it mostly works legs.  It's a good tape for beginners or those wanting an easy workout to break up heavier workout days (that's how I use it, anyway).  Interesting touch:  The ab work comes right after the warmup, making it much easier to get thru.  This touch is wasted however, as the ab-work itself on the tape is just too easy.  They would have been better off slamming you with a really tough one to take advantage of the section's placement.
Three instructors.  This bugs some people.  Doesn't bother me a bit.  You will need a 12-14 inch stool, a couple of sets of barbells, a dowel (a broomhandle's fine) and a 2 foot long 2 x 4 (not mandatory, but it works better that way).
Worth owning, but if you're going to just get one tape to do every day, this is not the one you want.  Then I'd go for The Firm: Total Body - Body Sculpting Basics, with Susan Harris.  It's their first tape and still one of their best.
A note:  While I'm not overly enthusiastic about this particular tape, I can easily say that it's still better than most of the exercise tapes out there.  Firm users get pretty spoiled pretty quickly.  They make the best product on the market.",985132800,11,1247,4.360869565217391
7796870,3,1568124295,"I wasn't really impressed with this tape, and I generally love the Firm's tapes.  This tape mainly focuses on the lower body (hence the  ""buns"" title), but it isn't really difficult like The Tough Tape  or Standing Legs.  The focus of the tape is mostly on body building and not  on cardio, in fact, there wasn't much cardio other than the warmup and some  jumps (which are high impact).  The tape itself is 45 minutes and would  best be classified as intermediate.  The equipment you will need is a  ""tall box"" (12-14 inch) and a dowel (or broom), plus weights.  If  you are looking for an intermediate lower body tape, this one probably  isn't bad, but try Tough Tape or Standing Legs if you are looking for  maximum lower body work.",966470400,5,735,4.511450381679389
7796871,5,1568124295,"I've been on excercise sabbatical for a year, and needed to get it back into my life (amidst working full time and caring for our toddler).  I have  always enjoyed Firm Workouts, and I absolutely LOVE this tape. The  instructors are extremely upbeat and motivational; the mix of the routines  is optimal. There are new techniques added to their signature box work; the  series of jumps showed me just how much more work I have to do until the  tape becomes unchallenging!  So, if you are returning to or starting  exercise, you'll find this a fun, upbeat, unique workout that will make you  sweat and clear your mind of any stress. I'm more than satisfied with this  purchase.",958694400,5,676,4.6525423728813555
7796872,4,1568124295,"I don't care what anyone else says - this is a wonderful leg and butt shaper.  It's not an aerobic tape, so you would want to add another tape  before or after doing this one if your legs can take it.  It uses a tall  box step- 14""- which really gets your heartrate up, and it has a great  ab section.  The three instructors are wonderful, and very motivating.",940896000,9,360,4.144927536231884
7796873,5,1568124295,The intensity level is just enough to feel a good workout with the 14 inch step-up box.  I especially like the variation of weight work interspersed with Pilates-like floor work and breathing exercises.,931737600,,202,5.121212121212121
