8473598,5,B005HSDM5U,"These guys can play. I saw special efx numerous times in the 80's and 90's. Recorded recently 2009,Chieli and the band are still hot. Playing some old and new tunes. Daybreak is one of my highlights of this dvd, bringing me back to the 90's. All the musicians here are excellent but being a drummer I was blown away by Lionel Cordew. Great jazz here. Still one of my favorite jazz bands. 5 stars",1328400000,,395,4.351351351351352
