2201394,5,B00076ON28,"This and The Mysterians were released at the same time. The Mysterians is a lousy film full of animated death rays and outlandish alien costumes. Mantango is a real thiller, though, very different for Toho. It is also very unsettling. I have never seen anything like it. No toy tanks being trampled by fire breathing reptiles, no toy rocket explosions, no toy airplanes being ""blasted"" from the skies and no streams of running, screaming people fleeing Tokyo. Different and quite surprising.",1117497600,7,491,5.074074074074074
2201395,4,B00076ON28,Actually as stated on this DVD's actor commentary Matango premiered in Japanese theaters in and around mid 1963. The Gilligan's Island first pilot (with different actors as The Professor and Ginger)was made in late 1963 thus the Japanese film does not predate Gilligan by a few years as another poster here thinks. Schwartz could have heard about a Japanese film made with seven castaways (as Hollywood and Tokoyo's Toho were in communication). But he definitely didn't see the Japanese film before he pitched gI to the networks in early 63. As for Matango itself it definitely is the creepiest Japanese monster film ever. But why do only some mushroom monsters go down when getting hit by bullets from the protagonist's rifle and others stay standing.. Loved the Tokoyo showgirl delusion scene best.,1115942400,3,800,5.068181818181818
2201396,4,B00076ON28,"I think most people have a film that they saw when they were younger, one that stayed with them, perhaps even haunted them, into their adult years.  For example, one of my friends can't watch the film Trilogy of Terror (1975), specifically the scenes with that little Zuni doll, without having a full blown freakout ...my youthful cinematic scarring occurred at the hands of Mantango: Attack of the Mushroom People (1963) aka Curse of the Mushroom People, Fungus of Terror, Matango the Fungus of Terror, Matango: Fungus of Terror...I remember seeing it on WFLD in Chicago (before it got co-opted by FOX) on the Son of Svengoolie show in the early 80's, and while I didn't remember much of it prior to watching it last night, certain visuals from the film have been stuck clearly in my mind for the past 20 years.  Funny thing is I've hesitated watching this film, as I purchased it back in January of this year, but, there comes a time when one must face his or her demons...looking back, I can see how this could have warped me at a tender young age, given the strength of some of the scenes, but since having learned the true horrors of life (working for a living and such), the film seems more bizarre than frightening now, so many years later.  Directed by the legendary Ishir Honda (The Mysterians, King Kong vs. Godzilla, Godzilla vs. Mothra), appearing in the film is Akira Kubo (Gorath), Kumi Mizuno (Frankenstein Conquers the World), Hiroshi Koizumi (Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster), Yoshio Tsuchiya (The Monster Varan), Kenji Sahara (Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla), Hiroshi Tachikawa (Gorath), Miki Yashiro (Godzilla vs. Mothra), along with Eisei Amamoto (King Kong Escapes), credited as `Skulking Transitional Matango'.

The story begins at the psych ward at Tokyo Medical Center as we listen to what appears to be an internal monologue from a patient, but it's hard to tell as his back is to the camera.  This segues into a flashback with some very peppy pop music and 7 people (5 men and 2 women) crusing the ocean on the sailing yacht Aho Dori, which, I think, means short-tailed albatross.  Aboard the yacht is Mami (Mizuno), Akiko (Yashiro), Etsuro (Tachikawa), Kenji (Kubo), Fumio (Tsuchiya), Naoyuki (Koizumi), and Senzo (Sahara).  Anyway, night falls, a storm hits, one that features giant waves pounding a miniature boat, and the next day we see a very damaged yacht adrift in foggy, unknown waters.  Hope arrives in the form of an island, and the group makes their way to shore, and begin searching for food and water, noticing an unusually large amount of mushrooms growing throughout the area.  While traversing the seemingly deserted island, they find a derelict, beached, research ship grounded on the beach, one covered with fungus.  After finding some canned goods on the ship, they decide to take up residence, and begin making plans to fix their yacht.  Tensions build as the food runs out, and it appears they may not be alone on the island as shadowy, lumpy figures visit the ship during the night.  What happened to the crew of the research vessel?  There weren't any corpses on the ship, and the captain's log offers little in the form of answers...perhaps their disappearance had something to do with the fungus that populates the island (you bet your mold covered bippy it does)...

Someone else mentioned this, and it occurred to me as well, in as far as at times I got a sense I was watching an episode of Gilligan's Island, if David Lynch had directed it.  We have a small ship that runs afoul of some adverse weather, and the seven castaways are stranded on a deserted isle.  As far as characters go, there's Mami, a professional singer/part time strumpet, who would be the Ginger character, Akiko, the student, is Mary Ann, Naoyuki is the Skipper, Etsuro, the goofball writer, is Gilligan, Kenji, a university professor, is obviously the Professor, Fumio, the rich businessman (who's also the dork dressed in full sea captain gear including the hat), is Mr. Howell, and Senzo, the deckhand would have to be Mrs. Howell only because there's no one else left (sorry Senzo).  But seriously, this has to have been one of the strangest films I've seen in awhile.  The story was pretty slow throughout, but I found it really interesting as director Honda does an amazing job creating a moody, oppressive, nightmarish atmosphere that permeates the film much like the fog on the island.  Looking at the title, one would get the impression of a silly B type movie, but the tone is pretty serious, about as serious as one can get given the antagonistic fungi factor involved.  The performances and characters were decent, but what really sells the film is the overall direction, extensive sets, and appropriately creepy musical score, along with some fairly sophisticated special effects (for the time).  There were some scenes near the end where I felt like I was watching a Sid and Marty Krofft (the pair responsible for such wiggy 70's television fare as H.R. Pufnstuf, The Bugaloos, and Sigmund and the Sea Monsters), particularly when the giant fungus creatures become more active, but the overall production worked well to overcome any minor silliness attributed to limitations on the visual effects regarding the giant shrooms.  Is there a moral implication present with regards to the consumption of the mushrooms (they induce psychedelic hallucinations, among other things) and their harmful after effects?  There sure is, and it worked on me...I've never eaten a mushroom I've found in the woods.  I think my favorite scene in the film was when we saw Etsuro Yoshida, the goofy writer character (the Gilligan character), sitting in a patch of mushrooms, consuming them with a silly grin on his face.  Oh, and by the way, I'd rather eat my left foot than any food I might have found on that wreck of a vessel, especially if I thought the ship was involved in some sort of nuclear research.

Media Blasters presents a superior anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) picture, along with three audio tracks including English 5.1 Surround, English mono, and Japanese Mono (I'd recommend the Japanese mono with English subtitles, but to each his own).  There are some worthwhile extras including a commentary track by star Akira Kubo, an interview with chief assistant director of special effects Teruyoshi Nakano, a spoken word piece with scenes and stills from the movie by writer Masami Fukushima, and an original theatrical trailer.  There are also previews for other Media Blasters releases including Dagora, the Space Monster (1964), Gappa, the Triphibian Monster (1967), The Mysterians (1957), and Varan the Unbelievable (1962).

2201397,5,B00076ON28,"I happen to suffer a severe financial disability, I have this incredible urge to purchase almost every 1930's thru 60's classic and not so classic Sci-fi and horror title that hits the market. Last month, I purchased an excellent Toho movie from Tokyo Shock entitled MYSTERIANS which I had always heard good things about but had never seen. I was pleasantly surprized how truly good this movie was when I watched it. After the movie, I watched the trailers and noticed that a movie (which I had always figured in the past MUST be just the cheesiest and worst Japanese sci-fi movie ever made due to the stupid title) entitled ""Attack of the Mushroom People"" was due for release. Well, being a fan of the genre, I was now excited to have this ""screen gem"" in my collection which I figured would be filed away with my Ed Wood collection alongside Phil Tucker's ROBOT MONSTER. I never had the chance to see this movie shown on TV so I had no basis for my opinion other than it's title.

Last night, I watched this movie for the first time and let me state how absolutely wrong my pre-conception was. Please keep in mind this movie was inappropriately re-titled for the American audience and that MIS-titling of the movie lowers it's viewer's expectations to the ranks of such Toho ""classics"" as SON OF GODZILLA. There are many amazing, classic movies of this era that suffer from terrible titles (such as the awesome I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE) but this is a movie whose title suffers from Americanization.

Anyway, let's get back to the movie. Others who have reviewed this seem to have wonderful childhood memories of this movie, something I lacked while viewing it. The nostalgia would have been nice but the absolute freshness of this movie to me was what truly sold me. There is nothing like seeing a movie that you have dismissed as cheesy fodder (don't get me wrong, I do LOVE cheesy fodder) only to discover a brilliantly executed tale. This is a well-acted, well-directed story that really caught me off guard. The actors tensions continue to build realistically throughout the movie as they find less and less to eat. The sequences in the abandoned ""ghost"" ship are truly gripping but what grabbed me the most were the psycedelic scenes shot in the mushroom fields. As demetia and insanity saturate the minds of the castaways, the wonderful cinematography captures the kaliedoscopic fungal phantasms amazingly well with it's unnatural lighting and frenzied sequencing. These scenes near the end of the movie are actually mildly disturbing. The musical score seems to reflect human voices screaming in agony and torment. What a great added touch. And the surprize ending...I didn't see it coming so I won't ruin it for to those of you who have never seen this hidden treasure.

This morning I sat down to a breakfast of sugar-coated vowels and consonants and ate my words with gusto. Don't be fooled like I had been by this movie's American title. From this day forth, this movie will now be placed in the top rank of my sci-fi collection with the best of the best and it will be filed under ""M"" for MATANGO!!",1112486400,48,3124,4.717948717948718
2201398,5,B00076ON28,"Wow! Was I glad when I discovered ""The Attack of the Mushroom People"", as I always remembered it, was coming to DVD! I remember seeing this on tv years ago, and never forgot how damn creepy it left me feeling. Story revolves around a handful of young Japanese citizens enjoying fun in the sun on a yacht. They wash up on a little fog-shrouded island after a storm hits them at sea. Finding no food on the island with which to sustain them until rescued, they one by one give in to their hunger, and start eating poisonous mushrooms. This in turn causes them to turn into human toadstools!!

  The DVD presentation of this ""classic"" is outstanding, and their is some really interesting extras. Buy it already!!!!",1111190400,6,711,4.582677165354331
2201399,5,B00076ON28,"It's here. One of my favorite movies - and most eagerly-awaited DVDs - ever. And EVERY single bad scenario I could think of for its DVD release has been stamped out soundly by Tokyo Shock/Media Blasters. Because THIS is exactly what I wanted from a DVD of ""Matango"" (Attack of the Mushroom People). My dream came true, and it's sitting in my hands.

The movie? Some of you might remember seeing it back when there were things called ""local UHF television stations"" :) that showed lots of cheap movies - mostly bad ones, some good ones, but almost universally fondly remembered regardless of their narrative quality. Back when we were kids, all we remembered about the movie was the ghost ship, the mushroom people, and the narrator's unforgettable final lines (dubbed in English, of course). And that it was cool. We may not have noticed that the script is very effective, the character interaction and motivations convincing, and the production design truly remarkable... and there's plenty more about the film that elevates it WAAAAY up above your average Japanese monster movie.

The DVD? Well, now we can finally really see the movie and rediscover it. The DVD boasts a beautiful clean print presented in anamorphic widescreen. The aspect ratio is stated as 2.35:1 on the back cover, which is correct for TohoScope, but the ratio actually measures out to be about 2.53:1. Add to that the fact that the image is actually windowboxed (when looking at the full image, say, on a PC screen, there are black bars on the sides as well as top and bottom), and this movie looks VERY wide on a television.

Just like the other recent DVD release of ""The Mysterians"" (q.v.), there is a wealth of audio selections: the disc includes a 5.1 surround English audio mix, a mono English track, and a mono Japanese track. There is also a commentary track from Akira Kubo, who plays the lead role of Kenji Murai in the film. It is in Japanese, but there are subtitles for the film AND the commentary... and you can even turn them BOTH on at the same time if you want (one subtitle appears at the top, the other at the bottom).

Just a glorious presentation of the film (at last!) would be enough to please me and other fans of the film, but we also get some marvellous extras. There is a 17 minute 41 second piece called ""Spoken Word from Matango writer Masami Fukushima"" which is a written narrative of the story accompanied by widely varied video - sometimes stills, sometimes behind-the-scenes footage, and so on. There is also a very generous, in-depth and fascinating interview with special effects cinematographer Teruyoshi Nakano. The interview runs 27 minutes 38 seconds and covers the film from all angles, accompanied at times by some great production stills and behind-the-scenes photos detailing the set, makeup, pre-production artwork and more. It's clear from what he says that ""Matango"" was MEANT to be a cut above the rest, and the loving care they put into its production really shows in the movie itself. Also included on the DVD is a trailer (16:9 WS), plus previews for ""Dogora"" (1964), ""The Mysterians"" (1957), ""Varan"" (1958) and ""Gappa"" (1967).

One more thing... if you're already familiar with the movie, you'll probably just want to watch it in the Japanese language with English subtitles on. The impact of the ending is undeniably weakened in the Japanese (original) version, believe it or not. So you, and ESPECIALLY those who have never seen the movie before, will want to watch the movie both ways at least once, and I'll even go so far as to suggest your first viewing be of the English dubbed version. (Don't think it to be sacrilege; the Japanese version is right there waiting for your second viewing, which you'll want to do anyway.) Anyway... THANK YOU Tokyo Shock/Media Blasters for having such remarkable respect for the material to present it to us with every bit as much loving care and attention as any other recent Hollywood blockbuster film released to DVD. Buyers, start your debit cards! You don't want to be without this title!",1110412800,148,4058,4.799713876967096
2201400,5,B00076ON28,"...and that's a serious question. It predated the premier of Gillian's Island by several years. There's a millionaire who owns a yacht that looks like the Minnow.  On board is a professor, the captain, a goofy (though somewhat sinster in the film) first mate, a pretty but shy country girl named Okiko, and a singer/movie star. There are seven castaways in all.  ""Lovey"" is replaced by another male character, a writer named Roy. The boat crashes into an island where they are castaways... Course on Gilligan's Island they didn't all turn into mutated mushrooms monsters. Rent or buy the DVD (one of my favorite films in Japanese cinema, finally getting its due...) and you tell me if Gilligan's Island isn't a complete rip-off of this film.

If I was Toho I would have sued Sherwood Schwartz for copyright infringement.

2012 Update: tooling around the web in the 7 years since I wrote this review, I observed that it has been linked to and discussed.  Don't know if I was ""the first"" to make this observations or others drew a similar conclusion as me about the similarities between this film and Gilligan's Island. I was aware of these similarities since I was a kid in the 70's, since this film was a staple on ""creature feature"" horror shows on Saturdays, and watching Gilligan's Island was unavoidable.  It was replayed over and over for a decade at least back during the terrestrial TV days, per cable, with only a handful of viewing options. Either way, whatever...

In tooling around the web the answer, seemingly, as noted by some bloggers, was that both Gilligan's Island and Matango were based on an old William Hope Hodgson novel called House on the Borderland.  Flash forward to 2012 when public domain audiobooks are available on free smart phones apps. This book was one of them and I listened to it over the course of a few commutes to work.

All I can say is ""nope"".  No way.  There are no castaways, there are no shipwrecks, there are only two main characters in House on the Borderland.  Without going into detail about this novel, there is absolutely zero similarity between this book and Gilligan's Island.  Matango was extremely loosely based on this novel because a fungi monster manifests in the last chapter of the book, one of many different types of monsters in this early (and interesting) work of horror science fiction. Matango borrowed /one/ of the monsters in the book - the idea of a fungi monster, and used only the idea for this kind of monster for the film purportedly but the entire scenario is completely different - setting, characters, plot, everything.  So, this accounts for the fungi monster in Matango.  Where does this leave Gilligan's Island?",1110326400,8,2689,4.79004329004329
2201401,4,B00076ON28,I saw this as a kid and loved it. FINALLY it's to come out as a DVD (I hope legit! I have the bootleg VHS so no more thank you). A great film with B movie touches Japan style but with great atmosphere. A small ship gets hit by a storm and lands on a radioactive island covered in ship wrecks only where are their crews?? A tropical island BUT the only thing worth eating are the mushrooms. Scary!

More fool me for not checking but then again, had Amazon posted the correct review for the correct product, things might have been slightly different.

For me, that's not really a complaint so much as a warning.  the ""featured"" monsters in these toho films are always being awaited in a kind of plot-build that seems constructed more in favor of an audience that has no idea what they are sitting down to watch, as opposed to people who are expecting Attack of the Mushroom people to have a lot of Mushroom Person Attacks.  Which is rather silly in this era because i don't think there's a person out there who has purchased this out-of-print gem within the last 3-5 years who didn't read/hear about it somewhere first.  Either way, the story building up to the actual Mushroom People encounters is one of the much much better stories from Toho, one that i would liken to the comparably (emphasis on comparably) good plots of ""Destroy All Monsters"", ""Frankenstein Conquers the World"", or ""The Mysterians"".  More actual character development than any Toho kaiju or tokusatsu film i have viewed.  (which is to say all of them with the exception of Half Human and The Human Vapor.)

My main point of contention is to urge viewers to watch the Japanese audio with English subtitles (except for those folks that speak Japanese, and don't need the assistance!).

2201420,4,B00076ON28,"I am a tremendous fan of the Toho Monster Films - that seemingly endless menagerie of technicolor beasts, once glimpsed on Saturday afternoons with bad dubbing and worse TV reception. I'm an even bigger fan of Weird Tales - the pulp horror fiction of the earlier twentieth century popularized by writers such as Lovecraft (creator of Cthulhu) and Robert E. Howard (creator of Conan). Of those writers few were as eclectic, or as creepy, as the English author William Hope Hodgson, who specialized in tales of unknowable evil born from mist, sea and the depths of collapsing time. What a wonderful thing it was for me to discover that two of my most seemingly disparate interests met here, in this film, directed by Ishiro Honda (who did the original Godzilla) and adapted from a short story by Hodgson.
The film itself is wonderful. The set design is simply incredible, bringing to life jungles, rotted ships and claustrophobic, decaying rooms filled with scarlet plumes of fungus. Honda was immensely proud of his work on this film, and I can understand why. Beyond the look of the film, the atmosphere of creeping dread is quite unlike most other Toho films. Here, the monsters do not appear towering above mountains, to stomp and scream and smash cityscapes. No: the monsters here are subtle. Patient. They stare from the shadows, sit within the rain-soaked fronds of island forests, listen and plan and mutter. The monsters grow, become fat, within the earth, within the ship, within you. While the acting can at times be a bit much, I think Hodgson would have approved of the film's overall mood of inescapable doom. From the moment a crew of privileged socialites become marooned on a seemingly deserted island covered in a rare and mysterious fungus with bizarre properties, it is abundantly clear that things are going to get ever so much worse before any of them can escape.
This is a great film, real pulp but unashamed of it. It glories in its steamy subtext, exposed flesh, sweat, lust, mysteries and horrors. There are great slashes of reds and greens, shouts and cries, and monsters that laugh and wish to embrace you in horrific friendship. This is a weird one.

I had tried unsuccessfully several times to find the movie for sale, but did not know that the name was actually ""Mantango."" Luckily for me, when I looked on Amazon recently, it came up when I typed in ""Attack of the Mushroom People."" I had always thought the movie was in black and white, but then I didn't my first color television until 1976.

I love old sci-fi movies from the 1950's and 1960's. This movie, ""Mantango,"" is fun to watch, which is what I like in my movies. The special effects are good for as old as it is. The story itself is rather unique for sci-fi movies and, in my opinion, campy, which makes it fun. And, compared to so many modern sci-fi movies, it is ""clean,"" and can be watched by younger people without concern for language and sex.

""Rocketship X-M"" from 1950, the first manned mission to the moon that goes to Mars instead by accident. Another flight to Mars in the 1955 movie ""Conquest of Space."" And another trip to Mars in the 1951 movie ""Flight to Mars."" And if you like giant insects, there is the 1957 sci-fi thriller ""Beginning of the End"" about giant grasshoppers and the 1954 classic ""Them!"" about giant ants. All of these movies are well done, good, clean fun, with great special effects for their day.

2201425,5,B00076ON28,"Toho's 'Matango' (1963, and also known as 'Matango, Fungus of Terror' and 'Attack of the Mushroom People') is surprisingly bleak Japanese horror film which combines elements of 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' (1956) with some of those from William Golding's 1954 sociological novel 'Lord of the Flies.'

'Horror,' especially in the West, is traditionally defined by two essential components: the active presence of decay and/or some 'abnormal' manifestation of nature, or a combination of both.

Beautifully directed by Ishiro Honda and adapted from British writer William Hope Hodgson's short story 'A Voice in the Night,' 'Matango' is a grim, engaging film about the overwhelming force of nature in several forms, both 'normal' and 'abnormal,' not the least of which is the infection of a human body by an external agent which transforms the infected party into something other than human--in this case, a fungus.

'Matango' is positively dripping with unpleasant manifestations of nature: typhoons, turbulent seas, endless heavy fog and smothering humidity, torrential rain, equatorial heat, and lush green rain forests all combine to give rise to an isolated island of creeping phallic fungus, while simultaneously destroying everything manmade, either immediately or in confident steady increments.

'Matango' begins as a group of successful young professionals take time off for a brief yachting trip together. Among the guests are university professor Kenji (Akira Kubo), novelist Etsuro (Hiroshi Tachakawa), and arrogant popular singer Mami (Kumi Mizuno).

The presence of the ship's stoic, common-sense captain, Naoyuki (Hiroshi Koizumi) is offset by the sardonic, vaguely threatening personality of the ship's mate, Senzo (Kenji Sahara).

Though the group initially appear to be good friends, most are actually business associates who have used one another in various ways to gain their own professional status.

That they are not genuine friends becomes apparent almost immediately when a freak storm drives the yacht far off course, breaks its mast, leaves it adrift in miasmic, uncharted seas, and in an opaque fog which never seems to lift.

Increasingly frightened, desperate, and suffering without adequate shelter, food and water, the group eventually make their way to a large, lush, and deserted island, which seems to lack almost all animal life, though foliage and mushrooms are plentiful.

The remains of a huge derelict ship are discovered on a far shore, its dilapidated interior almost completely clogged by a thick yellow mold. Investigating its contents, group learns that the ship was used for specimen gathering and scientific research related to the effects of nuclear radiation; they also discover a enormous broken mushroom in a refrigerator unit, which is labeled only 'Matango.'

Clearing away the fungus from the cabins, the group makes the wreck their temporary home.

Though fresh water is found to be plentiful on the island and a small cache of tinned food is discovered in the pantry, the thin veneer of camaraderie among the group continues to erode as competition for Mami's attention rises among the men. Tempers flare, threats are made, and guns are pulled and pointed as selfishness, suspicion, and paranoia slowly become the norm.

Only logical Kenji and diligent Naoyuki work together responsibly to keep the peace and group united. The pair discover the missing captain's log book, in which it has been recorded that the local mushrooms cause hallucinations and nerve damage when ingested.

Thus, the others are firmly warned that no one is to eat the mushrooms under any circumstances.

That night, someone or something that leaves human-like footprints visits the ship, waking the troubled sleepers. While attempting to hunt for game on the island, a huge lumbering figure is seen stumbling awkwardy in the distance, and is shot at. The figure escapes, leaving only a trail of mushroom caps behind.

As nerves continue to fray and the tinned food runs out, one or more of the group decide that eating the mushrooms is their only path to survival, even as fog continues to envelope the island and endless heavy rains cause the mushrooms to sprout to tremendous sizes.

'Matango' is not one of the greatest 'fantastic' films ever made; it's not in the same class, for example, as 'Metropolis' (1927), 'I Walked With a Zombie' (1943), 'Beauty and the Beast' (1946), 'The Innocents' (1961), 'The Birds' (1963), 'Don't Look Now' (1973), or 'Donnie Darko' (2001), but it remains a taunt, suspenseful and highly effective viewing experience.

Though 'Matango' could have easily degenerated into silliness, it is anything but silly, for which director Honda must be given the lion's share of the credit.

As in 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers,' what is most frightening is not from the takeover and transformation of a man's flesh into something entirely other, but the complete and total loss of all that it means to be human: kindness, compassion, the ability to love, independent will and thought, courage and other human hallmarks vanish immediately once one of the mushrooms has been eaten.

The climax, though somewhat anticipated, is surprisingly powerful, as the strange inhabitants of the island lay siege to the survivors. The sound effects the creatures make during this assault are suitably hallucinatory, add greatly to the film, and haunt the memory.

Though there is nothing to suggest that the fungus has arrived on Earth from outer space (the radiation from the atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki is the implied cause of the invasive fungus), 'Matango' travels heavily in H. P. Lovecraft territory, which makes perfect sense, since William Hope Hodgson was one of the strongest influences on Lovecraft's fiction. Though 'Matango' is in no way based on Lovecraft's work, it is nonetheless one of the most Lovecraftian of all horror films.

The film has attained international cult status for its unrelenting seriousness of intent, and also produced several successful lines of 'Matango' toys, which are hotly sought-after by collectors, sell for exorbitant prices, and whose purpose, intentionally or otherwise, seems to be to diffuse the more genuinely frightening aspects of the 'mushroom people' into something more palatable, and thus the production of the toys, and the toys themselves, act as a kind of exorcism.",1363651200,2,6381,5.310515873015873

2201428,5,B00076ON28,"Although most people consider ""Matango"" as being Honda's finest horror film (although fans of ""The H-Man"" and ""The Human Vapor"" would disagree), it is unquestionable an extremely effective film, creepy, suspensful and totally engrossing.

Although tame by today's standards - and not particularly frightening even to audiences back in the day - ""Matango"" conveys what to Honda was the essential message; not to scare or repulse your audience by the monsters but to invovle them in the movie's true meaning - the breakdown of individual morality admist social chaos.

Others have pointed to other motivations: everything from the unprincipled lifestyle of yachters to a warning to youth against using drugs, and Honda himself had admitted to these interpretations, but him main message was the basic hope of teamwork and of cooperation in the face of the dire necessity to survive.

Honda always worked well with the actors at Toho - arguably the best in the world at the time - and each does a star turn.  Hiroshi Koizumi, usually cast as a scientist, is given a much broader range as an actor and does an exemplary job as do his fellow cast members.

The print is glorious, bringing out the superb colors captured so well by Hajime Koizumi, and the sets and art direction are excellent.  The claustrophobic surroundings, the moldy environment and the general atmosphere of lust, deprivation and greed and brought to full cinematic light.

Akira Kubo's commentary is insightful and fascinating.  In all the presentation does a glorious tribute to a film that in many ways capture's Honda's full command of his powers during the peak creative period during the center of Toho's glorious Golden Age, of which Honda himself had initiated with ""Godzilla.""

2201430,5,B00076ON28,"MATANGO (Toho, 1963), or ATTACK OF THE MUSHROOM PEOPLE (U.S. title), is one of Japan's creepiest, most unusual science-fiction thrillers. Directed by the great Ishiro Honda, it tells the story of 7 shipwrecked people who come across a fungus infested island and ghost ship. Soon, unable to bear the lack of food, they succumb to eating the poisonous mushrooms and slowly begin to deform into deadly, fungal monsters.

Kind of a Japanese take on INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956), MATANGO is different from most of Japan's sci-fi films in that it focuses more on the psychology of the characters than it does on fighting the menace at hand. This isn't saying that MATANGO doesn't deliver its share of chills, it does, and the fact that the characters all come off as somewhat unstable only makes their situation even more dismal. The claustrophobic atmosphere also adds to the steadily increasing feeling of impending doom. The real horror is ultimately found in everyone's inability to resist eating what they know will destroy their humanity.

The special effects are by the legendary Eiji Tsuburaya, best known for the Kaiju films featuring Godzilla and other giant monsters. MATANGO's Mushroom People aren't gigantic, but they're just as invincible. Hajime Koizumi's cinematography perfectly captures the slimy atmosphere of the rotting ship, as well as the steamy, fungal jungle of the island.

Tokyo Shock's DVD offers a really nice, widescreen transfer of MATANGO, in both the original Japanese and English dubbed versions. There's plenty of extras including commentary by lead actor Akira Kubo, an interview with SFX cinematographer Teruyoshi Nakana, a spoken word from the film's writer, Masami Fukushima, and the original trailer.

2201434,5,B00076ON28,"I had only heard of Matango several years ago while researching Toho films.  After pondering for some time and hearing about what a cult classic it was, I broke down and bought it.

The film is about a group of people shipwrecked on an island(kinda like a Japanese version of Gilligan's Island).  On the island they find an old shipwreck and one part of the jungle covered in strange mushrooms.  As hunger and desperation begin to set in, some of them get more and more desperate for food and escape.  They also discover that perhaps the crew of the shipwreck may not have left the island....and what is the strange connection with the mushrooms?

This film was made by the great ""Toho Trio"" Inoshiro Honda(director), Eiji Tsuburaya(special effects), and scored by Akira Ifukube. Despite not having any real ""monsters"" per say, this is actually a very nice film and I enjoyed it much more than I thought I would.  The only real complaint I had was that the film's pacing is somewhat slow and tends to drag at times.  But near the climax, the film is in full swing and the ending is quite creepy!

If your looking for a classic ""monsters destroying cities and fighting"" film, you should probably look elswhere because this might not be your cup of tea.

2201437,5,B00076ON28,"Okay, so I have owned this Toho Shock print since it came out in 2005 and waited 6 years
to write a review, I am little slow!
Anyway, I pulled it out of my library last night since I had not seen in it for a while.

As others have said, this film is completly unlike any Jananese ""monster movie"" ever made.

The intellegent scrip, acting, set design and oppresivly unrelenting gloomy atmosphere transports you
into a surreal nightmare unlike anything I have seen since. A movie with this much imaginative skill at
really creeping the hell of of people could never be done today.
Best viewed by your self, late at night, and on a big wide screen TV.

I never saw this one as a kid, and never even heard about it untill I was well into my 30's when I came
across a bookleg of it on eBay and forked over the money in the hopes of seeing something different.
And WOW! this is different. This has got to be one of the darkest, bottomless and depressing nightmares
ever filmed. BTW, with the release of this very fine print, I can gleefully toss those bootlegs :)

I have not listened to any of the extra commentary yet, but it seems obvious that Honda was serious about
this project. It has been noted by film historians that Honda uses many metaphors and scocial commentary
about human nature and the duallity we all share.

Our charactors here are not particularly likeable. They are selfish and narcissistic. We have little sympathy
for them, indeed, even before they are shipwrecked, we have a pretty good idea about there personalities.

Each charator is well written, and actions throughout are perfectly logical for their perspective.

The few plot holes, are easy to overlook after we become suspended in the gloomy, atmosphere and the way better than
average (for a Japanese monster movie) acting. The scene where they discover the ""ghost"" ship off in the misty
distence is at once surreal, creepy, mysterious and beautiful all at the same time.

The set design, esp inside the ghost ship, covered with fungus, is very effective and heighens our sense of
dread and mystery. The lighting and attention to set detail is flawless, as is the use of colors.

Even when we see the mushroom creatures, with their haunting, eckoing laughter, the effects do not deminish
the mood with it's silly looking rubber costumes. The creatures, though some say look silly, to me were very
scary looking because of the way Honda chose to film them.
Using thick atmosphere effects, rain, fog, shaddowy lighting, and that background of extremly creepy laughter,
the final encounter with the unfortunate humans [turn mushroom] is truly nightmarish.

There is a scene where one of our charators, who has resisted the temptations of the mushrooms which are everywhere
on this island, finially is seduced to eat them, he goes into a kind of LSD trip.
We are also told that once you start eating the mushrooms, there is no stopping!! Pretty clear metaphor of the
consequences of drug abuse, even if Honda was not conscience of it at the time.

With the silly and lurid US re-titelling of ""Attack of the Mushroom People"", few took this movie very seriously.

That is a shame, but now we finally have a wonderful DVD transfer, and I hope this fine work of surrealist art
can be re-discovered by a new American audience.

For both the film the the DVD quality transfer, I give this 5 well deserved stars.",1297900800,4,3379,4.668350168350169

I haven't watched the dub yet, because I just don't enjoy them much, but because of the American name, it's easy to see why this and other good movies by Toho don't get the respect they deserve. It sounds like a typical 50's low-budget horror movie. The story is one of the most solid of any of Toho's monster movies, as each character has a solid role; there are none that just ""tag along"" so to speak. There is a heavy message of betrayal in the movie, which gives it more depth than just being a monster movie. On a more silly note: Everyone makes fun of the mushroom people suits! Ask yourself this; what would a human-sized mushroom look like? It would look fat and awkward and goofy and pimply, just like in the movie!

2201440,5,B00076ON28,"""Matango"" (also known as ""Matango: Fungus of Terror"", ""Attack of the Mushroom People"", and several other variations) is a truly innovative Toho horror movie from 1963 that's distinctive from the rest of their catalog. It is a more expensive film than many of its contemporaries (for more on this see the excellent commentary with cinematographer Teruyoshi Nakano), with excellent sets, generally very good acting, a great script, and fabulous photography and direction. If the film has any flaw, it would be that the pace is a bit plodding on occasion.

The premise of the film is that seven people from various walks of life are on a yacht, which is wrecked on a mysterious island. The survivors discover a prior shipwreck that is deserted and coated in fungus. The social fabric holding the seven together quickly rips and the survivors turn on each other, mostly out of hunger. Despite warning signs pointing out the dangers of eating the local mushrooms, one by one they succumb, and are filled with psychotropic fungi. These mushrooms are no ordinary life form, though (as the trailer makes quite clear they are a third, evil form of life; neither fauna nor flora), and they both mentally and physically change the humans slowly into demented mushroom people. This may sound like an ordinary run-of-the-mill ridiculous B-movie plot, but it's far creepier than that, particularly toward the end as the lone survivor is surrounded by the mushroom people. The film is interesting as it focuses not only on the battle between the survivors and the mushrooms, but places man's ugly self-centered survival instincts and the worst of human behavior front and center as well, making this much more of a psychological adventure than the typical Toho release. In a masterstroke, the film is done in flashback from the perspective of the lone survivor Kenji Murai (Akira Kubo) in his post-rescue Tokyo hospital room. The conclusion is not wholly unexpected, but is still stunning, attesting to Ishir Honda's directorial genius.

I had seen ""Matango"" several times before, and enjoyed it, but I was much more fond of it this time, and found the DVD packaging to be truly superior and fully justifying a five star rating. Not only is the print nearly perfect with beautiful color, the extra features are wonderful. There is a great commentary from Akira Kubo, which not only comments on the factual information of how the film was made, but provides great personal insights into the intentions of Honda and special effects director Eiji Tsuburaya, and other more meaningful observations about the film. There is an excellent interview with special effects cinematographer Teruyoshi Nakano about the making of the movie, and the new processes that were involved (and why it cost so much money to make), and a surprisingly captivating monologue outlining the concept of the movie from writer Masami Fukushima set to a variety of still and motion photography. I expected this to be a somewhat boring recap, but truly enjoyed having it explained through the writer's eyes. There's also a trailer and a choice of subtitles, and I enjoyed watching it in English with the English subtitles on: it was surprising how different the translations often were.

While this isn't a typical Toho monster movie, it's a great film, and I appreciate it much more as an adult than I did when I first saw it as a teenager. The movie is great on it's own, but the DVD package is a real treasure and I recommend it to fans of Toho, monster movies, the horror and suspense genres, or anyone else who wants to see an excellent combination of physical and psychological thriller from 1960's Japan.",1277856000,5,3664,4.954471544715447
2201441,4,B00076ON28,"Bad storm.  Shipwreck.  The crew seeks refuge on an apparently deserted island.  Amongst the group is a skipper, a professor, a millionaire, a beautiful singer, doctors, plus some more sailors and beautiful women.  Sound familiar?  All we need now is Gilligan.

The shipwrecked crew battle isolation and hunger as they quarrel amongst themselves.  They discover another broken down ship, one that had apparently been used for radiation and fallout research.  There are some bizarre mushrooms on this ship, and eventually several members decide to partake of the strange fungii.

MATANGO is a very imaginative movie from Japan back in '63.  It was almost banned upon its release because the deformed Mushroom people makeup was reminiscent of the atomic bombing victims a couple decades prior.  This is not a cheesy monster movie by any means.  It's a slow-paced, very creepy descent into madness.",1267056000,,895,5.225352112676056
2201442,4,B00076ON28,"Based on the William Hope Hodgson short story ""A Voice in the Night,"" this 1962 Toho horror classic could almost be titled ""Gilligan's Island Goes to Hell."" Seven shipwrecked survivors find themselves on an island haunted by the ghosts of previous wrecks--or so it seems. The castaways soon discover that the crew of one abandoned vessel was conducting experiments with a mutated fungus known as ""Matango""--and may not actually be dead but weirdly transformed.

Amid the production of its colorful, fantastic daikaiju flicks, the Toho tried at its hand at several very grim horror stories, of which Matango is arguably the most successful. Avid Godzilla fans will see many familiar faces in Matango, which featured one of its typical ensembles of extraordinary talent. The Media Blasters/Toho Shock DVD offers a gorgeous, widescreen print with the original Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles (or English dubbing for those who prefer it).

The film was released directly to television in 1963 with the lurid title Attack of the Mushroom People, and was rarely seen in subsequent years except on the occasional late-night horror show. The story is unrelentingly dark, claustrophobic, and misanthropic; none of the characters are particularly likable (though extremely well-portrayed), even those with whom we ought to feel a measure of sympathy. The build-up to the final horror is inexorable, without a shred of comic relief for the viewer. The eerie sound effects and unsettling score add to the mood, making Matango a true horror classic, now available as it was originally meant to be seen by Tokyo Shock Productions.",1265500800,2,1626,5.274131274131274
2201443,5,B00076ON28,"I saw this movie as as child on one of those saturday afternoon horror shows. It scared the pants off me. As an adult I realize the this was excellant special effects given that this movie was done in the early 60's long before computer generated effects became the norm. It's good old fashion horror without all the blood, guts and gore of today's film. Yes your kids can watch this. I still find it entertaining as an adult and I still wonder about wild mushrooms as a result I never touch them growing in the wild because of this movie.

Mantango is a classic horror film from the past that leaves you wondering if there is such a things wild mushrooms driving people mad while turning them into mushrooms. It has it's funny moments too at times but still has an aura of suspense. Good horror with out all of today's violence.",1260489600,3,829,4.4183006535947715
2201444,3,B00076ON28,"Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a fateful trip ... Numbered among your castaways are a sailor, the skipper, a wealthy businessman, a professor, a female performer, a cute and mousy young woman, and - a writer.  Oh well, you didn't think this was Gilligan's Island, did you?  Nobody gets tired of coconut cream pies here because there is almost no food to be found on this deserted isle - nothing except great big mushrooms that thrive in the seemingly cursed environment.  You don't want to eat these mushrooms, though, for this is the one place on earth where the old maxim ""You are what you eat"" is actually a truism.

Matango: Attack of the Mushroom People taught me one thing.  If I'm ever on Survivor and there's a Japanese contestant in my tribe, I'm going to do everything I can to make sure he/she is the first person booted out.  This film's ""survivors"" definitely are not team players, and things start getting ugly even before their drenched clothes have started to dry out.  The decision to take their tiny yacht directly into a huge storm is anything but unanimous in hindsight, the men soon starting looking at the women as if they've been locked away in solitary confinement on Alcatraz for a couple of decades, and the small and dwindling food supply is not even safe under lock and key.  These folks wouldn't have lasted a day if they hadn't found an old, abandoned relic of a ship on the other side of the island.  There, they at least have shelter.  All too quickly, though, the more annoying characters succumb to the lure of the abundant mushrooms, even after they've learned that eating them will cause you to turn into a mushroom yourself.

Honestly, I expected to enjoy this film much more than I did.  After all, it is from Toho, the guys who gave the world Godzilla, and a number of other reviewers seem to have a special kind of affection for Matango - but I found the whole thing rather boring and utterly devoid of creepiness.  I didn't think the character development was all that impressive, so much so that I sometimes had trouble telling the different male characters apart.  And the constant bickering was just annoying.  Whatever moral lessons this movie may have wanted to impart were rather lost on me, I'm afraid.  Just to be blunt about it, I found the whole thing to be rather silly.",1259366400,,2345,4.574162679425838
2201445,5,B00076ON28,"Agreed with another writer here about seeing this first on UHF for the first time back in the 70's or 80's, except on this end it was on VHF.  TV that is.  Amazed when I found out that I could actually get my hands on this excellent movie.  Before this it was going to the video store to rent it out, and even then the quality was not so good.  This is a masterful reproduction of the original and minimal loss in quality when compared to the airwaves of the 70's and 80's.

The storyline is already spelled out by Amazon, and quite a number of recommendations have appeared for this film.  Here's another thumbs up as it can be seen that a majority are saying that this is five stars, or ""love it.""  The total weirdness of the film with all of its majestic undertones and hints of what some people may really want to do (escape the rigors and realities of everyday life in civilization) and go back to the down and dirty, or the earthy and awesome.  When we see firsthand one of the characters eating the mushrooms (the storyteller) and how it affects his brain (flashbacks to most pleasurable moments) we are taken away to the outer space of time.

In the previous paragraph was written the word civilization, but actually it should have quotes around it, as told by the storyteller near the end of the film too...""people in cities are cruel, aren't they?""

The movie was one of the better horror movies from japan during that decade and it even found a strong following accross the world.  One of the reasons for this is that the people trapped on the mushroom island have the terrible choice to starve or to eat mushrooms and become a mushroom creature.  The spooky scenes of the fully mutated mushroom people who are laughing with glee at the total conformity awaiting the mushrooms victims remains a disturbing vision. It reminded me of some  life long stoners I know who have become more like cabbages than people.  Of course jaded viewers need not bother with old horror movies as they will just pick apart the lack of modern effects which is a shame because old movies are alot of fun.",1196121600,,802,4.626760563380282

2201454,5,B00076ON28,"While most Japanese monster movies from the 1960s are loads of fun, this one is in a creepy class by itself. The horror isn't in the obvious mushroom monsters, but in the peeling back of civilization as the shipwrecked characters encounter the real monsters -- their own dark selves, stripped down to the primal core. The allegory is never overbearing, but the cast is clearly a microcosm of then-contemporary Japan, and by extension the modern, post-nuclear world. Beneath the glossy, fast-paced surface of the technological cityscape, irrational forces still fester, ravenous & unrelenting.

The film itself looks terrific, drenched in rich color & mood. Rather than rely on gore & easy shocks, it builds atmosphere & dread as the casual veneer of each character begins to disintegrate. And exactly what are those mushroom people, anyway? Symbols of those who have abandoned reason & responsibility in favor of self-absorbed hedonism? The true face of the alienated public, which is concealed beneath flash & pop culture? The desire to hide from & deny the looming terrors of the world? Perhaps all that & more.

As usual, Media Blasters has done a superb job of restoration & providing all the extras you could want. The commentary by lead actor Akira Kubo is informative & charming, and the additional special features are a treat. In its own way, as profound & challenging as the original ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" this is not to be missed -- most highly recommended!",1180656000,7,1480,5.012195121951219
2201455,5,B00076ON28,"I remember this movie from watching Creature Double Feature movies on my local tv station. I had a video copy and the dvd is much better.

  This movie is an excellent choice for sci-fi classic horror fans. Its best qualities are: atmospheric creepiness, editing that supports tension and creepiness, and visually arresting color schema that focuses on neutral colors offset by primary colors. I also enjoyed the fashion. The imagery is haunting and creepy. If you like such imagery as passengers shipwrecked on a deserted island, rotting boat sails, and misty fog curling over questionable sea and landscape  I recommend this film for you. There are also psychological connections to nuclear radiation, escapism and drug culture, and man's inhumanity to man and city life.

  This movie may seem slow to viewers not accustomed to or attracted to the acting and story pacing of older monster films.  The creepiness and tension build at a slow pace and viewers familar with the instant gratification, fast pacing, and more realistic acting of modern horror films may be disappointed by the film.

  My memory of this movie from childhood is that it was black and white and I am wondering if the one I saw from childhood was a different version? I am into some of the arty aspects of filmaking and I was entranced by the editing and imagery of this film. I really enjoyed it!",1177286400,3,1373,4.849785407725322

I wonder if this film was meant as a drug allegory.  Despite a few creepy scenes when the mushroom people shamble after our heroes, they really seem to be more interested in lying around in the forest and giggling.  Even though the protagonists know what will happen to them if they eat the mushrooms, they do so anyway as they give in to despair over their situation.

2201457,5,B00076ON28,"This is a great movie! The Japanese subtitled version is an improvement on the dubbed version I used to see on tv back in the early 80s. There is a great sense of menace, with more background on the abandoned ship found by the castaways. Ishiro Honda shows he can do more than the kaiju films (I LOVE those too, don't get me wrong), making an effective horror movie/morality tale.

The extras on the disc are great too, with the original story told over scenes of the movie, and another story by the same author. A commentary by star Akira Kubo is interesting, though he spends more time talking about his career in general, as opposed to Matango. A featurette on the makeup and special effects is informative and fun, also.

The script was well written, with tension among the castaways contrasted with the growing menace (the tension was done much better than in the movie Goke: Body Snatcher From Hell, another japanese movie from 1968, which I thought sucked). The monsters were well done, as was the derelict ship.

Plot and all are great but what really stands out in this film is the art direction, which is inspired to the point of genius. Absolutely one of the most beautiful and magical looking films you'll ever see and a stark contrast to the greasy cartoony quality of modern CGI based fantasy films. Even a challenge to Hollywood films of the same era. Plus the ideas and execution you're seeing on the screen here is just so much better than modern fare. Let's face it, studios got so enraptured with people who could handle computers competently that they ignored or downplayed quality artistic training and talent. Also, who goes to art school these days and gets the kind of rigorous fine-arts training that anyone working in film years ago would have gotten? Do you know of anyone now who could do the old Land o'Lakes logo? Or the sets for older Broadway productions? Or a Tom and Jerry cartoon?

2201463,5,B00076ON28,"I have been a long time fan of Japanese sci-fi films. Unfortunately, I have never seen Matango until Tokyo Shock/Media Blasters released it onto DVD earlier this year. And let me tell you, this film is much better than most films Hollywood flushes out nowadays.

Many folks have already told the story of the film here so I will not go into that. I was very surprised, however, how much care was given into this film and how effective the story was at bringing you into the film itself. You don't see the Mushroom people much throughout the film, but the story is just so interesting that, in the end, you really find more interest in the conflicts among the characters than the Mushroom people. The best thing I love about this film is the message it has, that being society is always torn apart by individual wants and needs. No one thinks about society as whole; they put themselves first. It is a message that still works, perhaps better, in today's society. Greed and corruption on the individual level.

Another thing that I love about this film is the atmosphere it creates. It creates an atmosphere that is very mysterious, troubling, haunting, and just downright creepy. It sent chills up my spine in certain areas of the film, and the ship the characters stake as their home, is creepy itself.

Words simply cannot describe how great this film is! Many people may be thinking that since it's a Japanese film, it will have the same ole cliches of other Japanese sci-fi films. That couldn't be further from the truth. The film is just grand at telling a story that just keeps you glued to it and you actually feel for the characters. How many Hollywood films could you say about that nowadays? Also, there really isn't much in the way of special-effects here except the Mushroom people costumes and the makeup used to show some of the characters transforming into Mushroom people.

I highly recommend that everyone see this movie! It is a model for great storytelling and is sure to become a favorite with just about everybody who sees it!

Adrift for several days, the vessel happens upon a deserted island. When the marooned group goes exploring, they discover a shipwreck. Entering the craft, they find it's covered in fungus. It also turns out to have been a scientific research ship. No survivors are found. From the ship's log, they learn how dire their own situation may be. There's not much food on the island, and the abundant mushrooms have an apparent nerve-damaging property. Further exploration of their new home reveals that they may not be alone after all. However, this might not be a good thing, since whatever roams about, isn't quite human. Not surprisingly, w/ food in short supply, it's not long before someone tries the mushrooms. There's a growing sense of unease, and tension among the stranded castaways. As order breaks down, and divisions take their toll, the true terror is unveiled. Director, Ishiro Honda is mostly known for his GODZILLA and other giant monster movies. MATANGO is a refreshing departure from such fare.

It was a real trip as a kid and it still is as an adult. Maybe even more so now because I want to understand how all the elements came together to make it happen.
Production values for Attack Of The Mushroom People are fairly high, there is meticulous attention to detail.
Direction seems a little weak to me along with the script.
It would have been fascinating to spend more time with the people who had or were in the process of morphing into mushrooms.
Are they Terrestrial or Extraterrestrial? It really isn't explored.
The endings for the English and Japanese versions differ so much it affects the entire film.
In one version the lone survivor expresses how useless it was to struggle and how terrible people are, in the other he says he was starving on the boat ride back and simply ate the mushrooms.
Apples and oranges maybe, but the original filmmakers' intent is what matters to me.

Whenever I think of this film I also picture another favorite, The Lost Continent (1968). They compliment each other very well and both are B+ movies.

This is a great production, very expressive and never tiresome!
I love the 'shrooms, fungi are people too.
