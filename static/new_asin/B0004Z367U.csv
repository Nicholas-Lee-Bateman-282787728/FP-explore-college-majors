Included are reports on the scientific comunity and what they are doing to understand the Phenom and what telling evidence have they gleen about them... However I couldn't give if 5 stars cause of the fair- video quality and the sound didn't make up for it. Its a very watchable DVD for sure, but it could have been better. There's No Extras and no menue, it goes straight in the movie when you start it. I wished they showed more Crop Circle Pictures than they did, and several of the aerials were shot poorly from a heavy slant. It was adequit for viewing but for 22 bucks it left me wanting more. The Higher marks are for the content which (shines) includes Lots of interviews & venues & science is explored here. For that it's worth it.",1139097600,,855,4.35
