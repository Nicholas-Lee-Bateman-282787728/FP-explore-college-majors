All in all, I figure it's still better to watch a so-so Sci Fi movie than ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Evita"".  This movie will end up being non-memorable, but it's preferable to being in a coma.",1127001600,,366,4.260869565217392

997692,4,630523275X,"Amazon really needs to stop mixing reviews together.

This movie wasn't egregious. It had a plot, and I could usually hear the dialogue , and I've seen several movies where those basics were not present. Admittedly, it is not to my taste. However, as a woman , I almost cared about the romance. Not a one-star movie.

The riffing is okay, failing to be one of their top efforts, but to my mind almost any RiffTrax is better than no RiffTrax.",1485561600,2,441,4.432098765432099

997696,1,630523275X,"This is not the kind of bad movie that's so bad that it's awesome to watch. It looks like it would be, which is why I bought it, but it's not. It's just bad. Not good bad. Bad bad. Not Michael Jackson 80s bad. Michael Jackson 90s bad. I'm talking so-bad-you'd-rather-go-to-the-dentist-than-watch-this-movie kind of bad. I thought we were in for a poor man's Terminator knockoff with some comically awful production value, but it's barely even that. It's more like some film students took a crap on a film reel and this is what was left after they wiped it off. It's so unbelievably terrible that you can't even laugh at how bad it is; you just want it to stop. It's like chemotherapy. Stay away from this movie. Please heed my warning and do not watch this. You'll be so angry at the fact that you've just wasted 93 minutes of your short life which could have been more enjoyably spent doing math word problems, or cleaning the toilet, or drinking day old coffee from the employee break room at work. I feel like I need to blow my nose because of this movie. I cannot stress enough how unenjoyable this was for everyone involved, and we love terrible movies.",1421366400,,1158,4.519047619047619

997698,2,630523275X,"After starring in the dreadful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Futurekick/dp/B0000AB13O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Futurekick</a>, Don Wilson could pretty much relax when it came to sci-fi movies: no matter how lackluster they might turn out, there was no way they'd disappoint as much as that one did. In this way, ""Cyber Tracker"" is a triumph, but I'm in no mood to celebrate after watching it. This is a fairly run-of-the-mill, futuristic B-movie outing from the mid-90s, with little going for it other than its main star. As always, Wilson fans may be more charitable, but I could have done without this one.

The story: in a technocratic future where a computerized judicial system and robotic executioners have been imposed, a Secret Service agent (Wilson) uncovers the crooked roots of the scheme and becomes a marked man.

The film's plot actually isn't too shoddy, once you think about it: writer Joe Hart (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Power-Within/dp/B000C8STMG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Power Within</a>) examines social complacency to corrupt systems and infringed civil rights - managing to fit in an Ayn Rand quote - and even manages a couple sound dramatic scenes, like when Wilson's character's watches the video of his ex-wife. An unexpected reveal near the end of the movie is pretty cool. However, this is balanced out by the negative aspects of plainly having too many characters in the story (I couldn't remember a single name of the freedom fighters) and not really doing much with the idea of killer androids besides having them shoot a lot of bullets. This latter qualm may be a matter of budgetary restrictions, which seem evident by the production design: though everything is clean and professional-looking, futuristic Los Angeles doesn't look all that different from 90s LA.

Action scenes are routinely underwhelming. There are a lot of explosions and a handful of car stunts, but the shootouts are not interesting enough to justify their lengths and the fistfights could have been better. Joyfully, there's less slow motion in these scenes than is the norm in Wilson's pictures, and Don gets in some fairly decent choreography, but the fights are either too quick to be taken seriously or poorly paced. The semi-final fight between Wilson and Richard Norton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Under-the-Gun/dp/B0000A02VX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Under the Gun</a>) is pretty even and even lets the former show off some unexpected flexibility, but it's disappointingly slow and the action keeps cutting away to other characters.

What we have here is a below par movie, but I don't blame it on Wilson. This is one of the times where, given a different director and more resources, he could have looked really good. As is, most viewers can just leave this one be.",1400457600,2,2922,5.649202733485193
997699,4,630523275X,"Framed for murder and android police sent after him. I liked this quite a bit, has a lot of action and some good fights.",1355788800,,120,4.041666666666667
997700,2,630523275X,"Cyber Tracker is watchable for fans of low budget SciFi action movies (like me).  However, comparisons to Terminator or RoboCop are not warranted as this movie simply is not in the same league.

No plot spoilers from me; the movie is set in the not so distant future where the justice system has been turned over to a corporation (CYBERCORE) which uses computers to judge and pass sentence on criminals. We follow Secret Service Agent Eric Phillips (Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson) who has been framed for murder and sentenced to be, well, terminated by a Tracker.

Released in 1994, the special effects are seriously outdated (look for the 5.25"" floppy disc sitting on top of a monitor) and not very believable. The car chases are really not much better and it is almost funny at times as cars become airborne and explode at the slightest provocation.

Where you would expect this movie to excel is in the fight scenes, and that is generally true. No doubt Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson is a talented martial artist, but there are far too hand to hand (foot to head) scenes and far too many poorly done shootouts.

Still, this was an OK movie if you don't expect too much other than a lot of explosions and some decent fighting.",1252195200,4,1216,4.611111111111111
997701,3,630523275X,"With a movie starring Don The Dragon Wilson and Richard Norton, you don't expect great production values, and Cybertracker is a low budget movie, with futuristic technology that probably seemed old when it was released in 1994 and a story that echoes Terminator and RoboCop. But the story is entertaining and it has some good fights and should please most fans of cheesy low budget action/sci-fi movies.",1210636800,7,403,5.029850746268656

7886139,5,630523275X,"For a RiffTrax feature, Cyber Tracker is one of their better movies to watch. It has a coherent plot and the acting is decent. Take Terminator and RoboCop, add plenty of water, blend to a puree and you have Cyber Tracker. I'll admit Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson  (he's not really a dragon) is a bland hero and there is violence and profanity, but not to the extreme as in Samurai Cop. It takes place in the future (movie made in 1994 and I think it's set in 2015). Computerized Justice has replaced our legal system and it run by an ugly, evil Steve Jobs Wannabee. If you pay attention there is some prophetic social commentary. The scene where Don is talking to Agnes his run-the-home computer system made me think, ""That's Siri."" With the movie being halfway decent, the riffing from the Trax trio is an added bonus and makes the 90 minute investment of time worthwhile.  Now one of my RiffTrax favs and definitely five stars!
Some memorable riffs:
""He's actually going to show us his penal code.""
 ""All those trials are the real downside to the murder epidemic.""
 ""Run now while his updating his operating system.""
 ""Can't we get through one meal without gun play.""
 ""I want to die shooting the cool way.""
 ""Watching all my friends die earlier got me all frisky.""",1485648000,2,1261,4.5777777777777775
