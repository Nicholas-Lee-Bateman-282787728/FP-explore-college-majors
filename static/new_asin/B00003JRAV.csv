1330899,4,B00003JRAV,"I wish Americans would make movies like this.  A woman, sexually frustrated beyond imagination, at first seeks sexual relief in as tawdry of circumstances that rutting will lead to, yet eventually finds a  compassionate lover where she least expected him, and finally is vindicated  in her own sexuality through his highly stylized sexual behaviors.  And  yes, there are touches of explicit sex not seen in America outside porn  movies so prudes should avoid this one. The pacing is slow and conveys the  notion that you are watching a good friend across a few ages of discovery.  I won't forget this movie.",948067200,,607,4.9405940594059405
1330900,2,B00003JRAV,"For all its explicit sex, ""Romance"" is a very very cold film. The problem lies in the fact that the star of the film spends 90% of the time discussing the meaning of sex and love during the explicit scenes that  it becomes a complete turn off. But what I found more annoying about this  film is that it is supposed to be about the liberation of a woman through  her sexuality, yet the heroine constantly allows herself to be humiliated.  This is not liberation...it is self-loathing. Proceed with caution on this  one, it is not for everyone...",945561600,5,544,4.510204081632653
1330901,5,B00003JRAV,"This is the psychological journey of a passionate woman whose lover refuses her any form of physical pleasure. Because of her emotional ties to him, and her hesitance to leave him only because of sex, she persues a  twisted series of sexual affairs in search of some relief for her desire.  The movie makes phenomenal observations about women, who according to the  main character, wish to live with the top half of their bodies near their  loved ones in a picturesque romance world, and the lower half in the dark  corners of wild sexual freedom. This is the first movie I have ever seen  that addresses the dark natures of woman's sexuality without degrading or  pitying her. Plus, the film is well made, the plot is interesting, and it  will leave you feeling quite differently about the way you treat your  woman.",945561600,189,817,4.697183098591549

1330919,1,B00003JRAV,"This video came with high marks for its content being one of the best and most candid movies about sex and sexuality.  One review even said it was quite possibly the sexiest movie ever made.  I am by no means a prude; quite the contrary actually.  My sense of this movie was that it was one of the worst portrayals of humanity related to sex I've ever seen.  I have over 400 movies in my collection and a couple of them are pretty poor, but I keep them because the had at least a little redeeming value.  I watched this movie waiting for the good part; the part where something shifted and we got to see some of the honest humanity there was supposed to be there.  It never showed up or, if it did, I missed it because it was so far out of the mainstream that I couldn't recognize it.  This is the first movie I've ever thrown away.  I could have sent it back to the person I bought it from because the have a guaranteed return policy and they did their job perfectly.  The biggest reason I threw it away is that I thought if I returned it, it would be just one more copy of the poorest movie ever made floating around waiting to strike another unsuspecting person.",1474761600,4,1165,4.188340807174888
1330920,2,B00003JRAV,"When an American film is based on a dumb idea, this is plain from the start.  When a French film is based on a dumb idea, one thinks that perhaps one is missing its deeper meaning and the film will improve.  ""Romance"" is from that genre of French films based on dumb and pretentious ideas of Jean-Paul Sartre: we are what we do, we define ourselves by our actions, our freedom is our essence.  Misunderstanding Sartre has produced a deluge of idiotic French cinema in which unbelievable characters behave in bizarre and unsympathetic ways uttering nonsensical dialogue that conveys no coherent inner life or motivation but are animated instead by abstract metaphysical notions and ideology.

One can hear Marie (Caroline Ducey) philosophize her inner thoughts of sexual degradation but unlike the blurb on the cover ""Genius! Possibly the sexiest movie ever made!"" they are entirely unerotic, hard to watch, and laughable because even when attached to scenes in which the characters are really doing it on screen they reflect nothing like sexual passion for anyone who has ever had it.  I would not have watched it for free and regret paying $10 for it on Amazon (bought through a friend's Prime membership).",1472083200,2,1207,4.955445544554456

Or is she just expressing a normal amount of sexuality? Males do this all the time. Think about sex, joke about sex, and have had typically more partners than females.

Why does she have to be in the adult industry, or a some sort of woman of the night to get some once in a while?",1328227200,3,497,4.03030303030303
1331030,4,B00003JRAV,"This is a very good, very French film.  From the reviews, it seems to have confused a great many people:  not only are the protagonists bizaarely unfathomable, but the young lady maintains this unbearably insipid dialogue going about what she is experiencing and why, a kind of cheesy left-bank philosophy that is off-putting.  However, these things should not be taken at face value, in my opinion, but as ironic view into the characters:  they are indeed lost idiots, clueless about how to live their lives without inflicting cruelties on anyone close to them, and thinking way too much in the self-important manner of pompous, dim-witted narcissists.  Those are the characters involved.  Breillat is painting a tableau, not talking directly to the audience via the confused young woman.

The plot involves the retaliation of a pretty young woman against her boyfriend.  For whatever reason, he has lost all sexual interest in her and is abruptly cruel while openly flirting with other women.  She observes this in a heartbroken way, continually trying to seduce him - all graphically acted out - and yet she cannot bring herself to leave him.  This is odd because there is absolutely nothing interesting about him (or her for that matter), there is no emotion or warmth on display from either of them, and the passion if it ever existed is long dead.  So instead of leaving him, she decides to get even by seeking a series of ever more degrading sexual encounters.  It is horribly explicit, strange, and empty.

This is not pornography because it is not meant to titillate.  The girl is sullen and blank in every one of the situations, never showing the slightest pleasure or interest in her partners.  Indeed, the only pleasure she shows is a fit of despairing auto-satisfaction, all the time describing to herself what she is feeling in a detached and idiotic voice, without real insight. Another artful twist is the long, unexplained sequences, when the viewer must guess what is happening.  They don't always make sense and are not tied off as you would expect in a hollywood film; this creates gaps that the viewer must fill in, must work to interpret.  That too is a trait of many good French films.  The funeral ending, for example, must be placed into the context of the film; it is not an obvious denouement.

I enjoyed this on re-viewing, even if it is sad and cruel.  It is deep psychodrama with many layers.  Recommended.",1312848000,16,2436,4.835748792270532

1331032,2,B00003JRAV,"The cover's sub-text states (a) love is desolate, (b) romance is temporary and (c) sex is forever. To me, this is pretentious. It suggests either a degree of titillation (placing emphasis on the sex) or a complete lack of belief in the emotional conditions of 'romance' and 'love'. What is in the film's favour is that (as in my other reviews of similar movies), the female perspective is worthy of exploration. The theme is one of unrequited love and desire from the man she clearly loves. This sends her to alternative erotic scenarios. If you want explicit sex, there's not much here, compared to others in the genre. An understanding of emotional and sexual disappointment is attempted.",1287100800,2,690,4.905982905982906

The main character spoke of herself in the MOST negative and demeaning terms and language.
The way she let herself be treated by her lover and other men made me wonder why she let herself continue to pursue such empty relationships.
The story is sad, both in emotion and style. The acting was mediocre at best. The dialogue was shallow and phoney. The film quality itself is the only saving grace, as it was very good, it is the ONLY reason I gave it even ONE star.

Romance is unfortunately notable only for its graphic sex, for Breillat has not come up with a compelling story to go along with the taboo-shattering scenes; if you want to see the provocative French director use her skills to a point and purpose, watch Fat Girl instead.",1234051200,,289,4.78
1331048,4,B00003JRAV,"[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.]

Is Marie (Caroline Ducey) perverted because she wants to be used and abused, or is it her boyfriend Paul (Sagamore Stvenin) who is perverted because he denies her the love she craves because of his need to control?  Or is it Robert (Franois Berland) who has spent a lifetime chasing and seducing women?  Or is it director Catherine Breillat herself who in France is sometimes known as a ""porno auteuriste""?

Or, better yet, is it the debased mind of the censor, the prude and the hypocrite who would deny the range of human sexuality?

From Breillat's point of view, it is the censors who create the concept of obscenity.

I have to say however that some movies are so graphically sexual that it is difficult to watch them without being aroused, and this is such a movie, the most pornographic movie that I have ever seen that was not pornography per se.

Candor about sexuality is not what most people want.  Even rarer is it for a woman to be candid about her sexuality in a forum that might include men.  The fact that Catherine Breillat directed this film does not mean in any way that the sexuality of the central character is Breillat's sexuality, but it does mean she understands that sexuality; and since it is presented in a sympathetic manner, it means that she believes it is true at least for some women, at least some of the time.

In effect the movie asks the politically incorrect question, do women want to be used and abused?  Breillat's cinematic answer is a bit of equivocation.  I think what she is saying is, it depends.  For even asking such questions Breillat has experienced hatred and been denied funding.  But she says ""All true artists are hated. Only conformists are ever adored.""

Marie's boyfriend who is pretty and very attractive to most women will not have sex with her.  Not completely.  He frustrates her for no apparent reason.  He seems almost pathological in his disinterest in her.  She feels not just rejected but inadequate and of course frustrated.  She is crazy about him and does everything she can to interest him, but to no avail.  A game begins: but we see only her side of the game.  His side is hardly present, but there is this blond-haired male friend that he likes to hang out with.  Perhaps Paul is gay and doesn't know it or doesn't want to admit it.

Marie first tries a guy in a bar.  It doesn't work out because there is no feeling on her part aside from...aside from what?  From a desire to hurt Paul?  To prove to herself that she is attractive?  Then there is Robert the older man who claims to have had sex with 10,000 women although he is anything but handsome.  This reminds me of the French novelist Georges Simenon who made the same claim in much the same way.  Incidentally 10,000 women is approximately one a day for thirty years, which (pre Viagra) is sometimes thought of as the length of a man's sexually active life.  Some readers may recall these lines from the poem ""Go and Catch a Falling Star"" by John Donne:

""Ride ten thousand days and nights,
Till age snow white hairs on thee,
Thou, when thou return'st, wilt tell me,
All strange wonders that befell thee,
And swear,
No where
Lives a woman true, and fair.""

Or the reader may be reminded of the ""ten thousand things"" from the East.  In other words, ten thousand is a number that means ""many,"" but many in a very human way.

At any rate, this man Robert is past the time in his life when he can, shall we say, perform.  But he knows women and he discerns Marie's desires which are to be taken completely.  He ties her up and she finds that she likes it, etc.

Well, what's the resolution?  How should this end?  Should Paul wake up and really love her?  Or will she finally get completely disgusted with him and leave?  Or will he wake up and then be found boring.  Is that what he is afraid of?

The way Breillat chooses to end the film is both a bit too easy and yet seems apt.  Notice that the title ""Romance"" is a kind of sardonic take on the ""pornography"" of romance novels.  Romance novels fulfill the wishes of the feminine reader but in a euphemistic and unspecific way.  The ""hard"" sex that Breillat presents (in a mostly soft way) in this film is only hinted at in romance novels.

On the other hand, clearly in keeping with a good ending from a woman's point of view (in so far as a ""good"" ending is possible in this film) is the fact that Marie ends up with what in evolutionary psychology is called having her cake and eating it too.  She receives superior genes (or at least very attractive genes) for reproduction while winning the support of the man who will take care of her and her child.  In this case these are two different men.  Guess which one is which.

Be forewarned that this is a MOST explicit film sexually speaking and will offend many viewers.

This stupid, STUPID lead female won't leave her boyfriend even though he is the most self-centered jerk of all time.  Instead she just engages in depressing, depressed sexual acts while complaining about herself and the entire world.  The ONLY uplifting part is the final minute when she (THIS IS A SPOILER SO STOP READING HERE) finally wises up and KILLS HIM!!!!

If you're looking for a good Catherine Breillait movie, try ""A Real Young Girl,"" which at least mixes eroticism in with its disgusting images.  This one is just depressing and frustrating from beginning to end (aside from the last minute).

And about that 'hardcore' footage -- it's the lead actress trying pitifully to arouse her asexual boyfriend on a few different occasions.  Wow!  What a turn-on!",1201392000,7,1064,4.96045197740113

While the American general public would stay away from a film like this regardless of critical opinion, I get annoyed when critics dismiss her work as pretentious porn.  Quite often, reviews of her work (this film and Anatomy of Hell in particular) are usually hatchet jobs on her, not on the films itself.  The reviewers usually mention certain scenes, but never mention the context or their relationship to the whole film.  They don't seem really interested in understanding her work.  They seem uncomfortable with her, and essentially their reviews are reduced to name calling and bewilderment.  She really gets at the heart and soul of relationships.  The insight she has is rare in any age.  This film had numerous censorship problems worldwide (including an outright ban in Australia), which to me is absurd.

First off the sub-title font is old fashion block and the color of the subtitles is white well half of the movie's background is in white so you can't read the subtitles. If you should choose the dubbing then be prepared that it sounds like a really bad porn movie or even the old fashioned Karate films where it sounds like the dubbing was done in a echoed hallway and they don't even come close to matching the lip movement of the actors.

The story the female is in a relationship with a boyfriend that doesn't have sex with her on the jacket cover it says she is fulfilled in everyway but this with him..... that is never clearly shown in the movie they have no connection what-so-ever. This movie is very French it drones on and on with metaphors and just a lot of blah, blah, blah of the female {Marie} talk about her views on sex and her female private parts . This is a very explicit movie I saw the unrated version and they showed a scene where she got a pap smear and the hospital was using her as a ""test subject"" so like (I think) 10 men performed a pap on her, they showed a rape scene that really (in my opinion) wasn't rape, 2 bondage scenes (reminded me of {The Secretary} and she from time to time tries to perform oral sex on her boyfriend to which they show his genitalia.

The female in the movie played by Caroline Ducey decides to go out and find sex for herself since her boyfriend is not having any with her and (unless I missed it) it is never explained why he chooses not have sex with her. She has rules like no kissing, she doesn't want to look at the face of the person she is having sex with etc. etc. The policeman from the movie {Transporter} Franois Berlan, is a coworker of hers whom she ends up with for some S&M and she has a albeit brief interlude with a widower played by International porn star Rocco Siffredi.

I would recommend that you rent this movie first before purchasing maybe it was so French that it was above my head and me being a American I lost what I was supposed to get from the dialogue. I'm not sure but I can say that the ending made no sense WHAT-SO-EVER and they never addressed what the deal was with the boyfriend.

Our heroine is all too well aware of how the men are drawn to the gash as she is raped, put in bondage and examined by a gaggle of medical interns.  It is the heroine's journey of coming to terms with her body and the way in which men see it and her, and want it but not her, in herself, that the film explores. In Latin ""pudenda"" is literally translated THAT OF WHICH ONE ONE SHOULD BE ASHAMED. And so is it any wonder there is this massive contradiction in a woman's attitude - our attitude- to the physical side of women. But to the film. Is it erotic? - yes. Is it intellectually interesting? - yes. Does it provide men (at least this man) with an insight into the contradictions and torment women face regarding their bodies - yes.

This film hypothesizes that, during initial courtship, men have all the power in a relationship. They have a constant need to chase and conquer (to paraphrase a line spoken by Marie's vain boyfriend Paul), which opposes a woman's need to attach and commit. Once the initial chase has ended, the man loses interest. The result is that the woman finds herself degraded. And yet, when pregnancy enters the picture, the balance of power changes. In the film, Marie's boyfriend is literally destroyed at the moment she conceives his child.

The only way he could stop her from loathing him would be to stop mating with her. Pretty well this movie only shows the couple when they are not cohabiting - she is madly in love with him (and hating it because of his neglect) and he, well this is where it falls down for me - as a male myself I'm not at all sure what he is doing in his mind - and the film really doesn't show us, doesn't explore the issue.

It's a cold, alienating film; we don't like or identify with anyone in particular, and we are invited to take a voyeuristic/anthropological interest in the fairly disturbing proceedings. In this, Breillat's objectives are certainly toward art: she wants to make us think, not drool.

It is interesting that in the U.S.A. sex is not really viewed as a legitimate medium or experience for real change and especially real love to occur.

1331122,2,B00003JRAV,"There's an unstable, blurry line between art and obscenity that is difficult to clearly define.  In an allegedly free society it is pretty much agreed that ""snuff"" films and ""kiddie porn"" are not acceptable, but where exactly do  depictions of actual sexual encounters belong when they are marketed in art house cinemas and on DVD, not as porn, but as elements of legit feature films?
Sex has always been a staple of movies.  One way or another, all films are exploitation.  Voyeurism is why we watch movies. Recently, a handful of feature films have played with our fascination with observing human sexuality whether it be manifest as control, intimacy or rage.
Strong reactions have followed in the wake of these movies.  Is it art, obscenity, porn or trash?  Does it lift the human spirit and inform? Does it titillate and entertain? Or does  incite and debase?
The ironically titled ""ROMANCE"" has been available on DVD in an R-rated version for over a year.  It's a simple story about an ordinary looking young woman, a teacher, who looks for anonymous encounters when her model boyfriend won't have sex with her. However, director Catherine Breillat's much more sexually explicit unrated director's cut, is an altogether different film, emotionally anyway, that's a more jolting exploration of a neurotic schoolteacher's search for, well, it's not really sex, but validation via humiliation. It's finally a sad and depressing story that has not an iota of romance or even sensuality.  The sentiently detached sexual encounters with unattractive men are discomforting in their blunt visualization.  In fact, we are more inclined to feel for the humiliation of the actor playing the teacher. And when the suspension of disbelief is gone and it enters real life it's not particularly pleasant. That crossover of emotional empathy is perhaps the whole purpose, or trick,  of the movie.  An exceedingly odd artistic goal.",1009929600,9,1921,5.121794871794871

And her?  Urbane and sophisticated.  Shouldn't some movies disturb us and make us view the world differently and not just entertain us?  This one does it.
I suspect the deepest female sexual animal seperate from her public facade, forced by our society (our ""heroine"" is a schoolteacher, after all) to stay hidden nearly always, disturbs many of us and perhaps makes this movie too strong for the mainstream.  I found it very intriguing and in the vein of the French Emmanuelle series and perhaps 9 1/2 weeks (Rourke/Basinger).  Colorful, hot.

1331134,4,B00003JRAV,"This is easily one of the more remarkable films of recent years. Breillat's frank treatment of sex sets the film apart from any other of its type. The story itself is unfortunately a dismal treatment of one woman's  masochistic approach to sex as a form of self-punishment for her lover's  refusal to sleep with her (will we never, ever see a woman truly enjoying  sex for sex's sake, and finding it the life-giving respite from the world  that it is?) But still, to actually see such frank depictions of sex is  tremendously refreshing...it's particularly wonderful to at last see an  erection in a mainstream film (the brief glimpse in ""Angels and  Insects"" notwithstanding). And that one of those should belong to the  extraordinarily beautiful European porn star Rocco Siffredi, in a sweet and  understated performance, is of course icing on the cake. But again, the  real drawback of this film is that it is yet another protrait of a woman  who suffers in love rather than breaking out and going for something  better.

This movie is  almost a parody of European art movies. Faux-meaningful narration,  antiseptic sets and long pauses are not in themselves enough to provide an  insight into the human condition. None of the characters are fleshed out  and, apart from a couple of scenes where she's allowed to act, Caroline  Trousselard sleepwalks through the film. As everyone else does the same,  I'm guessing the director is to blame, rather than the actors.

At lot has been said about the ground breaking aspects of this film (but they said the same about Basic Instinct) but I found the most disturbing scene to be the  internal examinations by the doctor and the medical students when she  becomes pregnant.
The story is total allegory and covers themes as  diverse as rape-fantasy and intimacy, our general attitudes to sex and our  specific nuances when it comes to fulfilling our partner's needs.
I have  not felt as uncomfortable watching a film since Blue Velvet, nor have I  felt as intrigued. Is this aimed at women audiences? Perhaps, but I cannot  imagine anyone empathizing with the main character. And if you are  expecting a pornfest, you are going to be really disppointed.
Is there a  point to this movie? Maybe an ethereal one about what women really need  from men in relationships (and perhaps the message that the Black Widow  spider and the Preying Mantis may have got it right in killing their  partner after mating).
Is this worth buying?

1331150,3,B00003JRAV,"If you're looking for romance in Romance, forget it!  Marie, the despairing and desperate heroine, is one unhappy warrioress.  This young lady has become emotionally betrothed to a narcisstic male model who treats  her with disdain by witholding both physical and emotional intimacy. Paul  the model, doesn't abuse Marie in the normal sense: no, he succeeds in  getting her bonded just enough to fully control her need for him by  withdrawing what he has implicitly promised.  Marie struggles mightily to  recapture what has been lost....or stolen from her.  Men are good at this  game; just ask any woman.
But here, in this artsy film, the French  director has all the significant characters addressing their wants and  needs in dissertation formats.  Marie, a teacher of what appears to be a  3rd or 4th grade class of Parisians, has them conjugate the verb forms 'to  be' and 'to have' with the added bonus of gracing their young minds with  this thought: 'being is not having', 'having is not being', etc.  Immediately we see how pleased these young philosophers are: finally, an  adult who understands that not all issues are to be (there it is again)  cloaked in black and white.  Marie is not ashamed to admit she has flaws as  a teacher: she can't write well or spell.  She spells it out to the  headmaster: I must be 'dis-lex-ic or something like that.  Not to fret,  though; this past middle-aged master can help.  Not only is he an  understanding Principal but a principled, experienced master of a sexual  sphere beyond casual, a quest that Marie needs to begin to secure her  release from Paul's captivity.  The headmaster, by his account, has had  ""ten thousand women.""  And he remembers all of them; no, not  their names and not their faces!  Marie is soon to beomce ten thousand and  the one.
Romance doesn't hold back on the visuals; it's all  here.......and more!  Though there are obvious faked scenes of passion in  Romance (true porn) some scenes are genuine.  However, without the main  performers all speaking in esoteric syntax, you would come close to seeing  a basic porn flick in Romance.  Marie does get her freedom, however, and  Paul must pay dearly for the woman who loved him.  But in the process a  very minor character must also suffer loss with Paul; that I particularly  didn't like.
When does Marie have time to prepare her daily lesson plans?  Perhaps every class session was devoted to making the distinction being  'being' and 'having'.  It is a profound thought.  If it's to be and you  must have this Romance, then do it.  Small town America video won't be  stocking this one.",951436800,4,2618,4.7792792792792795

1331153,5,B00003JRAV,"The words of Emmanuelle Beart (referring to her nude scenes in La Belle Noiseuse) came back to me as I watched Romance: ""I wasn't baring my ass, I was baring my soul.""
So it is for Romance, a drama that has been called everything from ""sexiest movie ever made"" to ""pornography"". And on a strictly technical viewpoint, the terms apply -- with graphic depictions of fellatio, copulation, childbirth and all manners of sexual behaviour both conventional and alternative, Romance walks the fragile line between art and exploitation.
What makes this film a great story instead of a series of sex scenes is its emotional approach. Director Catherine Breillat, who explored the subject of teenage sexuality in 36 Fillette with frankness and earnesty, applies the same approach to the sexual frustrations depicted in Romance. The graphic nudity, then, becomes not exploitation but attention to detail, and Breillat's choice of covering scenes with a series of sequence shots (the average running time of singular shots in this film is in minutes, not seconds) gives this film a painfully immediate, real-time feel. The use of long takes without cuts could not have been easy given the graphic sexual acts the actors have to simulate in the film. And the sequence shots are highly appropriate to the performances, capturing the actors' every beat. Caroline Ducey gives a brave performance as Marie, the frustrated teacher who tries to rediscover sex within a stifling relationship. The pressure of the graphic scenes and the character's staggering vulnerability give her performance a charge, and it is to Ducey's credit that her character's heart says much more than her oft-displayed body. By the end of the film the ironic, seemingly exploitative slug line comes true: ""Love is desolate, romance is temporary, sex is forever"". The final sequence of the film actually proves this to be a sincere statement in a sly, but also emotive way.
This film could never have been made on American soil -- pointing to the cultural difference between the Gallic and American film scenes. From this difference also comes explanation of why Romance, despite its sincerity and the depth of the characters, was received with such outrage here. In France, nudity has been naturalized -- it is no longer a shock to see frontal nudity and frank depictions of sex. In America, on the other hand, onscreen nudity is considered a special occasion, the ""last resort"". It is quite frankly unimaginable to me that an American actress would have consented to doing what Ducey does here -- the eternal question being ""What can we get away with?"" Well, sometimes you can't think in terms of what you can ""get away with"". Breillat and Ducey, by opting to expose the character as they must for her to come alive, make the question moot. Imagine Romance as an airbrushed Hollywood product, with artfully executed Nicolas Roeg-style montages and dissolves for the sex scenes, and the story will fall apart. Really, which is more exploitative: The painfully emotional scene in which Marie tries to get her boyfriend to desire her, or that bathtub scene in The English Patient, where a cut was specifically made so that the audience can see a naked Kristin Scott-Thomas rise from the tub from the front?
All sociological comments, aside, Romance is a searing drama on relationships and sexuality, unwavering in its integrity, and challenging in its approach both to the audience and to the actors. Its greatest strength lies not in whether it's ""sexy"" or not -- but in its close, intimate examination of matters of the heart.",950140800,159,3584,5.01510067114094

The point is, of course, that the scenes aren't titillating- in fact, they are quite horrifying in places.  The whole film is a journey into the dark side of female sexuality, and (speaking as a heterosexual male) it can become highly disturbing.
