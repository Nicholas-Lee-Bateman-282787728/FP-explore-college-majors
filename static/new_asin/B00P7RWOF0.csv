6788684,4,B00P7RWOF0,"3 1/2 STARS FOR A PREQUEL WITH DECENT CGI AND FAMILIAR FORMULAS

This third installment steps back in time from the first and second movies and gives us kind of an earlier view of a possible tale genesis.  There have clearly been dragons before (because they know what they are), but we see the arrival of a dragon at a time there doesn't seem to be others.  Instead of the latter ""Middle Ages"", the story reverts to a time just a few hundred years after the Romans, but with still somewhat Romanesque forces manning Hadrian's Wall.  The chivalric tradition and knighthood are already a factor in the movie.  Many familiar formulas are employed from the first and second movies.  For a direct-to-video feature, this is definitely better than most.

THE PLOT (no spoilers): Gareth is a young man training to be a knight.  He longs to better his circumstances and is clearly one of the best candidates.  However, he does not entirely share the ruthless attitude of his garrison commander Sir Horsa or his fellow squires.  Despite his participation in the tax collection efforts, a moment of mercy brings him back under the scrutiny of Horsa and puts the young squire's knighthood in jeopardy.  After witnessing the falling of a comet, Gareth determines to go north of the wall to retrieve precious metals and secure his knighthood with wealth.  What he finds in the wild lands of the Picts and Druids (as portrayed in the movie) will completely astound him and change his life.  Through a series of events, he will become bonded to a dragon named Drago (the dragon in the original was called Draco, not Drago, as you will remember), and will find himself pitted against the rogue Druid sorcerer Brude as he gathers minions to attack those south of the wall.  In his quest, he will find new friends in the form of a young Druid acolyte and a fierce, but very lovely, Celtic archer Rhonu played by Tamzin Merchant (Tudors).  Ben Kingsley voices the dragon.  In the end, Gareth will have to prove he is a warrior of The Old Code to break a spell and turn the tide.

OTHER THOUGHTS: The CGI far exceeds that of the second movie, but might still be just a tad short of the original.  The artistry is never the less cool and some of the things they did with the dragon were very interesting.  There was still comedy, but slightly more edge to this prequel and the acting in general was quite good for a direct to video ""B"" movie.  It is still light budget, so it's maybe a little less substantial in some areas.  The characters were interesting, but could have been fleshed out just a bit more.  The common themes of The Old Code, sharing a dragon's heart, striving to become a knight, tawny redheaded beauty, and spiritual side kick are all reprised in this movie.  With the villain being a sorcerer, obviously there was a little more magic involved.  Though people have varying opinions on the second movie, this one for me redressed some of the mistakes of the second one and allows for a resurgence of the franchise.  If you are a real fan of the series, I think you will be mostly pleased with what they accomplished on a modest budget.  Just keep in mind that they can't have the same production values on a much smaller budget to the first movie.  For those not familiar, you may want to start with a rental.",1423612800,33,3307,4.561016949152543

6788703,5,B00P7RWOF0,"I was pleasantly surprised, this movie didn't stink.  Its actually pretty good for a straight to DVD flick.  The design of the dragon is incredible, especially when they apply the ghost curse when hes less than substantial in daylight.  The lead actor is also decent (Julian Morris, as the less than sterling would-be knight Gareth).  The plot follows Gareths obsession with becoming a knight, failing to realize the man he wants to swear fidelity to is corrupt and dangerous.  Thinking he can buy the title, Gareth sets off to find a treasure.  Instead, he finds a dragon with nine eggs that look to be encrusted with gold.  Suddenly, too many people are counting on him to be a hero.  And when you cant even trust him................

Even though the plot feels too familiar it is fun.  The only drawback is the inclusion of two villains too many and one of them isn't as impressive as the other.  Jonjo ONeill, as Brude (a Druid conjurer) isn't quite as imposing as the part calls for.
Otherwise, loved the dragon (Ben Kingsley).

Meant as a prequel to the original 1996 film, it easily stands alone without benefit of seeing the first film.  Supposedly, they hope to make this a longer series with part 4 in the works.",1479686400,,1222,4.654205607476635

6788719,5,B00P7RWOF0,"Because of the nature of the storylines in "" Dragon Heart 1"", "" Dragon Heart 2"" I thought it a very good move to make the 3rd "" Dragon Heart"" a prequel if they wanted to turn this franchise into a trilogy.  Many may feel a 5 star rating is generous, but I rate movies not on there budgets but there ability to entertain on there given budgets.  I feel that "" Dragonheart 3; The Sorcerer's Curse "" does just that...entertains that is.  Today to many movies get lost in the dependence of special effects & C.G.I. to carry the movie.  Good story telling , good character development & decent acting make for a much better movie than a over dependence on special effects.  Yes there are C.G.I. special effects in this film but it does a better job developing the characters into people you can relate to & care about.  I've seen a lot of the newer so called "" Block Busters"" that have  a grand spectacle of special effects...but what does it matter if you are not invested enough in the characters to really care what happens to them!  I don't like to go into a lot of details when reviewing a film because I don't want to give away spoilers or raise expectations to high.  I will say that at the price I picked this up for lovers of Sword & Sorcery will be happy to add this one to there collection, especially if you already own the first 2 films.  Its always fun after time goes by to revisit movie trilogy's like this franchise and watch the movies not in the sequence of their release but in the chronological order that tells a better story.  No Oscars or Academy awards anticipated for these films but you can expect some fun & exciting escapist fantasy on a rainy afternoon or a bitter cold winters night.  I would say by todays standards all of the movies in this franchise can be viewed by the whole family.  I've seen much worse on prime time T.V.!",1466294400,5,1855,4.326589595375722

Bad people want them so he and a young monk have to get them to safety. the dragon can't help too much, a bad sorcerer has put a spell on him. The animation and CGI are way above what I thought it would be, pretty darn good. The actors....very good. Yep, very good. Especially the young knight.

6788745,1,B00P7RWOF0,"I just saw this film hoping that it could bring the franchise back up again after the disappointingly mediocre second movie Dragonheart: A New Beginning.  Well sadly it just wasn't to be as this movie just didn't pack the thrills even once.

The first Dragonheart will always be a truly unique and great classic.  Dennis Quaid, the late Pete Postlethwaite, David Thewlis, sexy Dina Meyer, and best of all Sean Connery voicing Draco the dragon, plus exciting action, incredible special effects, and some humor for good measure.  In that movie's case what's not to like.

Sadly, with this one you get nothing but talentless no name actors, a 91 minute running time that may as well have been 91 hours as slow and plodding as it was, decidedly dull, flat characters with the charisma of a cement mixer, lousy special effects, very little action and where there was any the action scenes they didn't really amount to much, a forgettable plot point playing on a Great Wall of China element of isolating realms from eachother,  a plot hole involving a sub-plot with one of the characters mother having been killed by one of main villains giving no explanation as to what went down with the said incident, the final fights are both unimpressive from both being rushed(ironic how the one thing that should've moved slower speeds up too much.) and having bland fight choreography,  the villains known as the Pict Warriors all look like circus clowns with really bad hair instead of colorful wigs, sadly Drago the dragon is not only both little seen and little used, but he's every bit as dull as the human characters, if Ben Kingsley can be the dragon's voice and not do anything to make him fascinating then you know there's a problem. The love interest(Rhonu) to the main squire Gareth character is unconvincingly militant to say nothing of her being very plain looking, the tagalong would-be Druid Lorne is just worthless as he is lame,  the dragon eggs are for some reason golden colored, also, you never get to see a baby dragon hatch once, and finally this movie takes itself too darn seriously.  It could've benefitted from some laughs as slow and dull as it was.

In closing, if you are a fan of part 1 and/or part 2 well then this movie is not likely to live up to either/or. This movie suffered much having nothing in the way of character development.  Part 1 is the only one that not only had that, but also, an actual interaction between the characters instead of just throwing them together with a common goal but no chemistry or relating to one another.  Dragons are awesome and it's always a shame when the people who make these movies can't seem to do a good job of it at all.

First of all, the CGI was amazing. Voice acting for the dragon also amazing. It's truly sad that this movie was so bad.

A dragon, by the unoriginal name Drago, is sent to Earth with a clutch of eggs in order for dragons to live there amongst humans. Why the dragons decided to send a bunch of their eggs to Earth, the last place you'd expect them to want to send their young, is beyond me. You would think they would send some that are a little older.

The plot revolves around the supposed 'guarding' of these eggs. The problem is, Drago is utterly inept at protecting them, nor does he (or any of the other characters) seem to care about them.

At one point, the dragon tells them ""Not all can survive, sacrifice what you must."" and they proceed to use one of the eggs as a grenadeworst of all, in a situation where it wasn't necessary. I'm so blown away by it, can't believe the writers thought that was a good idea. Drago also makes one of the unhatched dragons give half its heart to someone he barely knows, which is like giving a baby's kidney away but worse: if the other person gets hurt, they feel it; if they die, they die too. Really?!

It's so ironic, it's hilarious that the moral of this story, repeated several times throughout the movie and again as a climax at the end, is ""One's choice is their own."" Hmm... does that apply to the 8 iout of 9 baby dragons you guys tossed around like grenades or the one who's heart you gave half away?

This review has nothing to do with my 'religeous' beliefs' by the way (I'm athiest AND pro-choice). I just find it absolutely callous and despicable how the eggs were treated in this movie. They weren't regarded as baby dragons (which in the Dragonheart universe are intelligent like humans), more like objects or livestock. If that kind of thing bothers you, definitely skip this movie.",1442448000,,1857,4.447058823529412

6788762,2,B00P7RWOF0,"Why don't female dragons have female voices (will one did, ""Eragon""), but all the rest that happen to have human vocal cords seem to sound like Sean Connery. Leaving aside total animation films, those with joint human/reptile billing seem to not be able to decide if dragons are nasty or puppy dog nice (at least to the right person). Bad list - Potter, Dragonslayers, Hobbit, Reign. Nice list - How to Train, Neverending, Dragonhearts, Game.
Westerners think they flew about in the, ball park, middle ages. Easterners place them at least 4000 BCE when the Earth was a cube. Ahhh, the fun begins when superstition and religion encounter dinosaur fossils - what imaginations.

Well, this film's particular dragon actor had great CGI which was easy to accomplish since the computer graphics code was already written and the dragon look already established in many films dating back to the '80s. The storyline was ""Game of Thrones"" borrowing (haha, stating it tamely) with wall, tribes, eggs and general overall feel.

6788778,3,B00P7RWOF0,"His heart knows only virtue. His blade defends the helpless. His might upholds the weak. His word speaks only truth. His wrath undoes the wicked... I live my life by those words.  And by the 'lyrics' to Nightman... In other words, I was really rooting for this movie and I was looking for any reasonable excuse to give it 3+ stars.

Dragonheart 3 is almost exactly what you'd expect:  corrupt kingdom, virtuous and shunned knight from a castle, woman archer from the wilds who acts as the love interest, fat bumbling magic apprentice for comic relief, and an evil sorceror.  One cannot rate a movie like this on its originality, but just on the degree to which they don't screw up.  Unlike Dragonheart 2, this is not a film directed to an eleven year old audience.  Nor is it a 'so bad it's good' movie for all the stoned chuckleheads to laugh at.  At least it didn't start out that way.  But by the halfway point I was tempted to dust off my bong...

The special effects of the dragon was better than I expected, but you can tell from the wardrobe that they were on a tight budget.  The lead actor  (Julian Morris) felt out of place because he's the only one who could act.  Other than him, the cast was bad.  Tamzen Merchant played the druid archer love interest, and she looks like she just fell off the turnip truck.  Her acting would be considered bad by high school theater standards; her Irish accent was so distracting and her mannerisms so weird that every time she was on camera the scene became awkward and uncomfortable.  She apparently is a legitimate actress, and plays the redhead witch in the series Salem (I don't care what you people say- I like that show!)  I almost gave it two stars just because of her!  As for the other two members of the knight's party, you got the noob mage who looks like every kid brother with ADHD out there and the other guy is a warrior I guess, but he has toothpick arms, an eyepatch and has the dessicated face and body of a meth-head.  Where did they find these people?!?  And my god, The Evil Sorceror... he was alright, except when he tried to sound threatening.  When he lowered his voice to appear menacing, he really sounded like a homosexual.  It looked like he wanted to kiss the cameraman!!  And when the sorceror removed his shirt, it looked like there were a bunch of penisses and testes carved on his back.. It probably sounds like I'm making things up just to be funny or mean, but I'm really not!!

There was some effort put into the film and they did have the music from the first Dragonheart during emotional scenes, so maybe they did the best they could with what they had.  I'd only recommend this to people really into sword and sorcery movies or for potheads to watch during bad movie night.  Apparently there is a Dragonheart 4 in the works and hopefully they'll get the funding to do it right.",1433462400,2,2864,4.440613026819923

6788780,5,B00P7RWOF0,"This film, for being a straight to release low budget one, was actually pretty darn good.  I liked it a heck of a lot more than the second Dragonheart.  I think that it could have been improved in some spots and areas by cutting out a little and tweaking, but, considering, it's not bad at all.  The acting and dialogue were the most pleasantly surprising.  Generally, from my experience, straight to release movies like this turn out to have some of the most cringworthy acting and dialogue in film--this one, on the other hand, wasn't bad.  The only actor I even recognized was the guy who played the pirate with the wooden eye in ""Pirates of the Caribbean.""  Even still, everyone did a good job.  The CGI was good too.  Some of it seemed a little overdone to me in some cases, but, again... The movie was pretty good.  XD

To clarify, I rate it 5 stars, not solely for the quality of the film, but because I'm considering what they had to work with, and because I appreciate what they were able to do with that.  Had I just been rating the film, I'd say it's a one time 3.5 star rental that you may feel as if you're having to force yourself to finish (which is what I meant about it needing some tweaking), depending on how bored you are, how much you fangirl over anything dragons, etc.  I say give it a chance...

6788787,4,B00P7RWOF0,"Julian Morris (Pretty Little Liars, Cry Wolf) comports himself well as a ""knight wannabe"" in post-Roman Britain some time around 800AD (? - the chronology is a bit confusing since there is a reference to Merlin who was purportedly there ca. 400 years earlier).  This film is actually a prequel for the much earlier Dragonheart and displays enough action and special effects to satisfy even its most ardent critics. Playing the part of a squire named Gareth, Morris aspires to being a knight in a Medieval garrison protected by Hadrian's Wall (built ca. 135AD) that serves as a barrier against the ""wild tribes"" of the north. He would have achieved his goal were it not for a nasty and unscrupulous leader who fails to recognize mercy and kindness. Forced to flee the shielded compound in which he serves, Morris searches for the remains of an astral body that impacted the nearby outer perimeter.  He believes that gold is contained within it.  The result is first contact with a dragon who he names Drago (voiced by Ben Kingsley).  A group of outcasts battling a tribe of Picts led by an evil Druid sorcerer is also encountered by Morris. From that point on, there is almost non-stop action between the various rival factions with the ""good guys"" aided initially by the  dragon.  A ""tug of war"" also exists to see who can control the dragon in the end.  A romantic situation slowly evolves between Morris and a female ""outcast"" who has great skill with the bow and arrow.  She is like a Medieval amazon combining both strength and beauty. However, the path to ""true love"" comes with many bumps (literally). The unique relationship that also develops between Gareth and Drago is literally ""heartwarming"" and has broad and significant implications.  The grand finale is exactly like one could hope for.  Never mind any sense of triteness. There are a few surprises and considerable sword play. It's still plenty of fun and valor is its own reward. A bonus in this film is the music score which reuses the main theme by Randy Edelman from the original Dragonheart in addition to new music. (Edelman's theme has been reused repeatedly in any number of film coming attractions and is one of the most beautiful to be found in a film score.) Unfortunately, I found no credit in the end credits for the reuse of Edelman's music.  One last alert: Be sure and watch ALL of the end credits through to the end. Audiences these days run out of a theater or turn off a DVD as soon as the end credits begin to appear. Big mistake. ""Hollywood"" has gotten wise and often tacks on something right after you think that everything is over.  Enjoy!",1432771200,5,2628,4.701525054466231

THE REST OF THE STORY
DH1 - I enjoyed the original Dragonheart movie (DH1) for what it was, a blending of semi-historical with fantasy in a movie that just felt fun to watch. Fallen hero finds his way, and all the rest.  It had its shortcomings for me, even when I first watched it. I would have given DH1 four or five stars because, as I recall, it left me feeling very good afterword and I bought a video of it, perhaps a couple of times. DH1 was solidly fun, forgivably flawed, and all in all, very enjoyable.

DH2 ... I heard so many bad reviews I never watched it. Maybe I will some day, but it would take some pretty great convincing on the part of someone I trusted.

DH3 ... I tried it.  I got about half way through and stopped. The weaknesses and inconsistencies were too many. It was hard for me to watch. But then I had a snack (being honest here :) ), then chose to force myself to finish watching it based solely on the number of positive reviews it got from other people.

Had I just run across DH3 on my own without reading reviews by others, I'd have stopped half way in and given it 1 star. From the start it felt like ""a movie that's trying to be ..."" ... but, in the end, is not what it tried to be. It felt amateurish on many levels and more than that, very uneven, with bits that were done well and bits that were really dreadful. I found myself disinterested in nearly all the characters, and the ones I was interested in were not the focal characters, but a few of the supporting ones. The role of Sir Horsa played by Dominic Mafham and the potter played by Chistopher Fairbank were really quite good, but the rest I could have given a miss. Had the rest of the film been up to the standard set by these two, I'd have most likely enjoyed it a lot.

In the end, I did go on and finish watching it, and ended up giving it two stars because it ended better than I thought it would. But still, the story was lacking and so was the execution, and you just can't get three stars out of me without at least a good story or solid execution, and for 4 or more, there must be both.

I prefer that stories of dragons and knights and quests have strong and timeless messages.  This film felt kind of random and chaotic throughout, with a tag line message thrown in at the end, ""one's choices must be one's own"". Well, yes, and he did finally make his own choice, but there's good story telling and there's weak story telling, and this felt weak and not compelling to me.

BUT ...
If DH3 is such a weak film, why do so many people give it reasonably high marks? It gets a fair number of favorable reviews despite what feel to me like rather obvious weaknesses and shortcomings. So what's with the high-ish ratings?  Here's my theory:

a) People like stories about dragons and knights, especially when both are good.  These movies do give you that. For some folks, that's enough.
b) People like movies where the dragons look rather realistic and impressive. DH3 certainly gives you that, to a degree. Not bad, not bad.
c) People like medieval fantasy movies in general and there just aren't that many of them to start with.
But lastly ...
d) Even though the story telling and cinematic art (writing, acting, directing) were not high end in DH3, the film was trying to be about sincerely unselfish people trying to do something good in a semi-magical world ... and people want to like such films, because they are not just like everything else Hollywood turns out the rest of the year, even if it was direct to DVD.

I think films like this get a 1 or 2 star handicap for just being about heroes and good dragons. And that's not the end of the world. But I think the producers would be wise to spend just a tiny bit more money and a good deal more time sitting down with gifted story tellers when they prepared to weave the tale of DH4, if there is to be such a thing. A solid story, with a lot of heart, well told and well produced is what makes for a great movie, and you can't cut corners on the basics and expect to create cinema.",1429747200,2,4169,4.234256926952141

Though lacking the authority from the commanding presence of character as compelling as Dennis Quaid, the acting here is strong by all the featured players and the story compelling, though I lost the continuity a few times when I could not understand what was spoken at critical moments.  This story is also darker than the first with more hackum and gore, less humor.  The light romantic touch could have been stronger since to me the makeup of the male/female lead characters had some unrealized potential for more humorous tension by way of verbal ripost.  I could easily sit through this one without feeling I was watching a B- children's cartoon as the second movie was very hard to watch.  If another installment followed this level of performance, I would watch it.

6788827,5,B00P7RWOF0,"This review will cover the ist Dragonheart movie and this 3rd one.  The initial Dragonheart with Dennis Quaid was, I thought, a really terffic movie
in the tradition of adventurous, wholesome, clean (no F words here!) and heroic movies.  It had some very funny moments, especially when Quaid
and Drago trick Villagers into thinking the down and out knight killed the nasty, smelly dragon.  But they got caught when the dragon, pretending
to be shot with a spear fired from a Ballista ,fell into a lake too shallow to cover his escape under water.  The villagers saw him and chanted ""meat""!
and Drago made a very quick exit.  The rather unethical scam ending when they had to take on a vicious brutal king who the dragon shared a bit
of his heart to save his life.  Nice guy, huh? The dragon, voiced by Sean Connery (superbly!!) was brilliantly animated, Dennis Quaid was funny and
yet heroic in the end.  And the nasty King got his comeuppance!!  The photography was excellent as were the special effects.  I  am a lover of
dragon lore and love films that deal with them intelligently.  This movie was both funny in parts and serious in others.  Good fight battles and sword
play; real sword and sandal (or boots!) stuff.  And of course there was the hot chick.  The producers must like red heads, because the chief chick
in the first and third films are red heads.  OK by me, though I like brunettes.  And, of course, a happy ending though the dragon sacrificed his life
to save the people but went to dragon heaven among the stars; a teary but happy ending.  And guess who Quaid ended up with?
  The third edition of this movie I just finished watching.  It is simpler in story than the first but still very entertaining.  Theres the nasties as usual,
on both sides of Hadrian's Wall but I am still not sure who exactly was the worst.  A bad ruler was training knights-to-be but our hero fell out of
grace with the baddie; on the other side of the wall was another nasty who wanted to take the Wall.  He had this cycle that somehow controlled
this cool dragon  who was cursed and could not come out into the sun.  But somehow he (the dragon named Drago) got hold of dragon eggs, and
our hero got on his good side by saving an egg.  Anyway,he was befriended by this Red Headed Chick (what else?) and together and for the
rest of the film battled evil, especially the  bad leader south of the Wall.  They also befriended this monk like character who was trying to become
a sorcerer but wasn't good at it. Until the end!  Our hero (Gareth) had been mortally wounded but guess what, the dragon Drago gave him a piece
of his heart and saved him.  And at the end all evil is vanquished, at least for now.  I understand this was released only on DVD, but if so, it is very
well produced, with excellent Drago animation effects, good cast and acting and a good story, though I rate the first Dragonheart  the best of the
Three.  The second one is good but I haven't watched it in quite a while  and will review it later.  This film or films have the classic feel of movies
that I like: action, good SFX,cast ,story and a HAPPY ENDING!!  This a one of those movies that you can see and leave the theater feeling good
about it and feeling well entertained.  I  got all my DVDs from Amazon; I do recommend these films: FIVE STARS  for the lot.  Enjoy!",1426377600,8,3342,4.405891980360066

The problem with the film is that it moves along by the numbers. Nothing new here, you already know who is going to be good, evil, and how each character is going to pan out.

The nice thing is that the main character has a small character arc which is a bit of a surprise.

If you liked the first DragonHeart movie and don't have a stick up your behind then you should like this movie.

 Also, calling this a family movie is a bit misleading. It earns its PG-13 for violence. Go ahead and watch this with your family if you think your kids are ready to see men executed with the sword, burned alive, shot full of arrows or had one stabbed through the throat.  Its not quite R level violence, but you'll get more than you bargain for if you based your expectations on these other reviewers. So be warned. Edit: I forgot to mention the partial nudity.

6788847,2,B00P7RWOF0,"As much as I didn't prefer the second one, it still has significantly more going for it then this knockoff and has nothing on the first. The characters in this film had no depth and the ""character development"" of the protagonist Gareth felt incredibly forced at best. The conflict with the evil sorcerer felt rather pathetic as the Celt girl could have easily sniped him with her bow when he was at his weakest during dusk to be safe, and probably could have accomplished it at any other time she felt like it. Mostly it comes down to a list of just small things that don't mesh with the previous films, aren't consistent with the story, or just plain ridiculous. Things such as three people on foot outpacing men on horseback, Drago somehow not being able to tell Gareth is a self centered jack ass by looking at his heart, fighters on both sides using swords inconsistent with the period, and  the list goes on.

At least with the second film when the protagonist Geoffrey goes through practically the same moral dilemma between becoming a knight and doing the right thing, it comes off as fairly believable or at least significantly more sincere then what occurred in this film. I came into this film with an open mind and hope they could recapture some of the essence of the original. However as I was watching, I couldn't help but feel annoyed by the blatant truth that the screen writers didn't know how to write a good script and/or wanted money for little effort.",1424649600,,1471,4.5893536121673

6788849,4,B00P7RWOF0,"First off - If you're picking this up thinking that you are going to get something that could TRULY compete with the original Dragonheart, you will be disappointed.  Nothing is better or more majestic than the original Dragonheart and its star Draco. Nothing. Yet, if you see the potential of returning to this world, to a time BEFORE Draco, and that excites you, this film might be to your liking. Now with that out of the way, may I continue?

Okay, show of hands, how many live action films with talking dragons can you name?  Off hand, I can think of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug and now, with this latest entry, all three films in The Dragonheart Trilogy (that's now a thing).  You could include Eragon, but the dragon in that one merely communicates with the hero telepathically, there is no CGI facial lipsync going on (those cheap bastards).  But if we do include Eragon's Saphira, that's less than half a dozen films that have attempted to create an onscreen depiction of a dragon as a ""real"" talking character interacting with live actors and not merely some generic monster/menace that must be dispatched ala the countless, nauseating SyFy/Aslyum B movies that litter NetFlix/Redbox. I'm not comparing this film to the 80s classic Dragonslayer (since that dragon was a menace) nor the newer How to Train your Dragon films (since those are fully animated and Toothless acts more like a pet than a "" dragon person"").  My point is this - this is a very select breed of special films, so there's not a lot to compare it to.

Having said all that, how does Dragonheart 3 fare against those that came before?  Well, its better than those numerous SyFy B movies (and Dragonheart 2 for that matter) in that its CGI dragon wasn't dodgy or weightless (its great) and it had characters and I plot I actually cared about.  Its better than Eragon, in that it didn't feel like a half of a film with a truncated ending, its a complete tale.  However, it doesn't reach the heights of the original Dragonheart.  Let's be honest, how could it?  The original film had a budget of 60 million compare to this film's direct-to-dvd budget. Give its creators a break. They did an admirable job and cared about what they were doing.  See this film for what it is and it just might please you.

What worked for me:
1)Holy crap!  This thing is a prequel. Once I realized that, the whole world really opened up for me and I saw the possibilities of future DVD releases expanding the narrative and, perhaps, linking up of the original a few films down the line.  I was hoping to see our favorite Draco hatch from one of the eggs, but that didn't happen - except in my mind's eye. Maybe in Dragonheart 4 or 5?

2)Ben Kingsley as Drago!  Sir Ben has such a regal, distinguished voice that really worked for the role of Drago, who acts a guardian to a batch of 9 dragon eggs. His role was to guard and instruct the dragon hatchlings how to work with man.  He has sort of a school master vibe to him and it works, especially in his interactions with the would-be knight.

3)The CGI and Design of Drago. It took some getting used to not seeing a Draco clone on screen (ala Dragonheart 2) and figuring out Drago's unique dragon design.  He appears older than Draco, with more reptilian features.  I especially liked his teeth and his coloration for most of the film.  There is a flying scene at the end, however, in which his scales look black (as depicted on the cover), but throughout most of the film, Draco has a golden/green look to him that works and makes him look ancient/otherworldly.  Also, his lipsync looks better than the original to me and it took me a second look to notice all of the detail they put into his coloring has he's getting corrupted.  Great stuff all around.

4)The Supporting characters - I liked the supporting characters better than the main character. The redheaded lass and the comic relief monk/druid were an interesting pair to watch. and root for.  The main guy, less so.

5)The Music - Great callbacks to the original score!

What didn't (totally) work for me:

1)The Villain.  Have you seen the movie Your Highness?  I swear its the same character.  Wasn't able to take this guy seriously and that's a big weakness for a film.  I don't know anything about this actor, but the look of the villain just screamed frustrated LA guy stuck in traffic or disgruntled Starbucks customer. If they do a Dragonheart 4, the villain NEEDS to be a badass mofo, not a whiny yuppie-type character.  No fault of this actor, its just how the role was written and the design of the character.  Now that I'm thinking of it, there were two villains and they were both forgettable twin douches, one on each side of the wall.  Maybe they were twin brothers separated at birth?

2)The Curse - When I first saw the film the whole curse seemed to me like a cop out - a budgetary constraint to help hide the fact that they couldn't afford to show the dragon for the whole film.  They might have been how it was originally intended, but it looks like they spent a great deal of time/money depicting the ghost-like ""dust"" version of Drago that could have been spent showing more scenes of him talking and interacting as his normal self.  It was a strange choice that, while looking cool, wasn't totally satisfying - I want to see the full on dragon in day night!  The curse should have just been him turning evil with ""evil"" eyes to show that, forget all the dust dragon nonsense.

3)The main character-  I can't think of his name. He starts off as a jerk and doesn't totally sell his arc of redemption to me. Again, the writer's fault, since the actor did just fine in the part. More heroics next time, less angst.

4)The eggs.  Drago starts with 9 eggs.  Two are shown being sacrificed in the film, so we are down to seven.  Towards the end of the film, the main character saves a box of two of them, but the last scene shows only one.  Is there only one left or still seven??  This drove me nuts, since it was the entire thrust of the film - GOTTA SAVE THE EGGS!  Also, none of the hatchlings were shown coming out of their eggs, just a burst of light with the one at the end.  How killer would it have been to have seen a baby Draco stick his head out at the end of the film as the original theme swells? That would have one a lot of the original fans over.  Ah well, maybe next time.  And I do want there to be a next time.  Bring on Dragonheart 4, they did good job on this one.",1424390400,5,6476,4.434010152284264
6788850,4,B00P7RWOF0,"It was pretty groovy for a budget release riding on the coattails of a cult classic. People often put on nostalgia glasses when thinking about the first Dragonheart, but if you go back and watch it, it's pretty campy and silly. This one matched that tone pretty much perfectly, though with a bit more visible violence. Infinitely better than Dragonheart 2, which should best be left forgotten. Honestly I was impressed with the dialog writing, which was both snappy and clever at times. I'm looking forward to what the writer can put out in the future.",1424217600,5,552,4.760416666666667

Gareth (Julian Morris) a sometimes knight sometimes squire chases a prophesied meteor from Draco to the north. Here he meets up with an unfriendly evil wizard and some friendly folk and of course that dragon thing. From here on out a seventh grader writes the rest of the story.

It is a family film, that was so-so in acting and plot. Should keep the boys interested, but for me ""Strange Magic"" is a better family film.

6788853,4,B00P7RWOF0,"SPOILERS:
The first movie is very near and dear to me, so when I heard that there would be a third one I can honestly say I was excited. I have managed to watch the movie, and I can say that it was a better successor to the original than the second one. I don't like to rag too much on A New Beginning because I can see ways in which the idea behind it could have been redeemed with a bit of work and polish, but Dragonheart 3 does have a lot of work put into it with a not inconsiderable amount of effort to make things connect. There are some things that could be changed, such as the part at the ending in which Rhona is saved from dying through one of the dragon eggs when there was no hint that they were anything but combustible and certainly not capable of doing what was seen in that scene. Apart from minor inconsistancies like that, the movie as a whole was well-put together and worked well as a story.",1423872000,3,913,4.0777777777777775
6788854,1,B00P7RWOF0,"this movie was a complete disaster. the acting was horrible, as was the voice acting. the dragon only showed up like 4 times throughout the span of the entire movie, and he looked more like a dinosaur than an actual dragon. they made a complete mockery of dragonkind and the original franchise. they also messed up crucial parts of the movie (the parts where pain is supposed to be TRANSFERRED, NOT shared. and they didn't even share the pain properly if that was supposed to be it)

please PLEASE don't make another one, you will mess up the entire story and people will no longer want to watch the original one- THE BEST ONE. draco is canonically more than 100 years old, and you guys kept saying how this was supposed to be a stand-alone movie and now you're trying to make it tie in to the original one??
