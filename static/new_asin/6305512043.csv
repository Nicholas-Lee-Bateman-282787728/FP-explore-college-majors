1042784,5,6305512043,"I truly love this movie.  The movies from Disney have become dissappointing for quite some time. It is hard to use Disney as a safe-guard to have our families safely watch as wholesome entertainment.  But The Happiest Millionaire was of an era when families were together in  laughter and a togetherness without having to hold the remote to stop the  language,or change the channel due to sex. The actors were made for the  part. Tommy Steele has always been a favorite of mine and he hasn't let me  down in this romp of a film. Fred McMurray,though alittle short on singing  skills, still gave it his heart. The songs are simple and strong and i find  myself humming and singing each tune. Thank you ,i will enjoy this movie  with my family for long times to come. This is a film we shall never tire  of.",957139200,,805,4.4520547945205475
1042785,5,6305512043,"I, too, just saw a screening for this and thought it was brilliant!  I love the music and the story is classic Disney...Good, clean fun!  It was amazing how many new things I saw in this film.
I love the roadshow  edition!  The Sherman Brothers score brought out the best moments of the  movie, and I love the last song that Greer Garson and Fred MacMurray share.  You don't want to miss ""There are Those"" either.  It's  hilarious!  Lesley Ann Warren is charming and who wouldn't want George and  his kin for household pets?",953856000,7,524,4.4787234042553195
1042786,5,6305512043,"This is a wonderful family movie.  I watched it so many times when I was younger, and my sister and parents enjoyed it too.  It's one of the old classics comprable to The absent minded professor and the barefoot  exectutive.  I've searched for the Happiest Millionaire for a long time,  and it's the one movie that I can say was the favorite of my childhood.",946339200,2,358,4.446153846153846

1042788,3,6305512043,"This may not be a work of art, especially by today's standards, but it is funny and cheerful, and the tunes will keep you humming for weeks. That makes up for a lot. It's ENTERTAINING - not thought-provoking, not  intellectual, it doesn't strive to be a wonder of modern theater (even for  the days it was created). It's an amusing family film and does its job very  well.",938995200,,372,4.4411764705882355
1042789,3,6305512043,"THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE is the last live production that Walt Disney oversaw before his death. The movie is an attempt to emulaite the big blockbuster reserved seat movie musicals popular following the SOUND OF  MUSIC's success during 1960s and also to duplicate MARY POPPINS success.  The production is lavish in terms of settings and costumes; with a great  cast led by Fred MacMurray and Greer Garson; The songs by the Sherman  brothers are likeable and not as bad as critics would have you believe;  there are some great dance sequences. Unfortunatly, the plot is such a  simple trifle which goes on and on for 164 minutes(in the restored  version)that the movie eventually becomes a bloated, overlong bore. Its too  bad because all the right ingrediants are there except a good story and  script. The new DVD finally restores the movie to its original roadshow  lenght. MILLIONAIRE was cut by 20 minutes following its premiere  engagements. In fact the print which opened at Radio City Music Hall in NYC  was already cut. The colors are excellent, the stero sound is good and the  source materials are generally in good shape (a few markings here and there  are not worth complaing about). This movie is now more a curiousity of its  era and the wanning days of Disney's regime. It is certainly worth a look  and may appeal to non-discriminating fans of musical movies.",933552000,23,1375,4.862068965517241

1042996,3,6305512043,My low score has nothing to do with the movie itself.  Its a fun lighthearted movie that is nostalgic and cute.  My problem is with the DVD that I have now ordered twice because both copies has such poor picture quality that it looks fuzzy and like everyone has braces on their teeth or are just very blurry because it looks like the picture didn't line up correctly so you can always see a 2nd outline of the person right next to the 1st image.  Its very distracting and doesn't make me ever want to watch this copy again.  I bought this copy in the hopes that it would better than the copy I bought in the 4 movie collection with this movie in it.  BOTH of them had the same problem.

1043000,5,6305512043,"I watched this movie for the first time as an adult, and the experience of watching something this good, that I never knew existed, was magical.

The Happiest Millionaire feels like a grown-up movie with all the flavor of Mary Poppins: It's set in a very similar time period, and the costumes and sets feel familiar. Even the music in the two movies has a similar warmth and quality, because it was written by the Sherman Brothers.

Some reviewers say that the quality of the songs in The Happiest Millionaire just isn't as good as the Shermans' other work. I don't think that's at all true: I think that the significant difference is one of familiarity and association. Most of us have grown up hearing ""Feed the Birds,"" but few of us have the same glowing childhood memories of ""It Won't Be Long 'til Christmas,"" even though the latter is no less stirring and poignant than the former. And although ""Fortuosity"" is played on Main Street in Disneyland countless times every day -- probably to crowds who don't recognize it -- it doesn't have the rock-solid cach of ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious."" That has little to do with the music's relative quality. Rather, Disney has made Mary Poppins and its music part of the core of its message and canon, and left The Happiest Millionaire almost completely unused in this way, even though the quality of its music is exceptional. There is a simple lack of public exposure for the songs from The Happiest Millionaire.

I believe this is because The Happiest Millionaire, while containing nothing inappropriate for children, is fundamentally a movie for adults, with adult themes. The characters are concerned about things like marriage, careers, and their house becoming an empty nest. Kids haven't had those experiences and won't be able to relate. Also, the road show version of this movie, which I actually prefer, is quite long. It feels like a stage musical on film. While this makes for a satisfying viewing experience for adults, it will almost certainly leave kids bored. Despite the length, the writing is snappy and the humor genuine -- just not anything that is typically kid humor.

It seems to me that this movie is forgotten about or found lacking by some people because it is a Disney movie that isn't really for kids. Don't let that dissuade you from enjoying it for what it is, because it is wonderful. There are plenty of other things out there for the whole family to enjoy, and this movie is a gem.",1472256000,,2467,4.79764705882353

1043132,2,6305512043,"This film actually helps explain why the movie musical form died in the 1960s.  I actually had to do some research on the backstory to this film to begin to understand what Disney and company thought they were doing here.  The Biddle family is certainly interesting -- but the film loses its focus most of its over long 173 minutes.  This musical has not one tune worth listening to, a shock given that the songs were composed by the brilliant Sherman brothers.  The title itself seems quite odd given Mr. Biddle (the millionaire in question) spends the first twenty minutes of the film complaining and acting the role of an eccentric curmudgeon for the rest of the production.  What worked in the film? The cast was OUTSTANDING!  MacMurray, Garson, Cooper,  Page, Warren and on and on are all stellar.  Indeed, it's a shame they couldn't have found more for Greer Garson to do here in what was her final  movie role.  In addition, as usual for Disney in the 1960s, the production values were first rate.  The film had all the elements of a great movie -- but the execution failed badly.",1465603200,,1087,4.609375
1043133,4,6305512043,"Truly a Disney musical movie with an all-star cast and a good feeling about it when it is over. Based on the musical of the same name, Fred McMurray (My Three Sons) plays Mr. Biddle who is also the happiest millionaire in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and perhaps the entire world. His daughter, Cordelia, is played by then newcomer Lesley Ann Warren. His wife is played by film legend, Greer Garson. The musical film is set in 1916 during the height of World War I better known as the Great War of the time.

The film stars a talented first rate cast including Dame Gladys Cooper as Aunt Mary; Hermione Baddeley (Mary Poppins, Maude) as the maid Mrs. Worth; Geraldine Page (one of America's finest theatrical, film and television stage actresses. F. Murray Abraham presented as the greatest actress of the English stage) as Mrs. Duke; and a young John Davidson playing Cordelia's fianc from New York City. The film can be slow at times but it is enjoyable too. The film has plenty of music and dancing to keep audiences entertained.

The film is truly a Disney musical with light-hearted humor and drama. The film is over 2 hours and a bit too long at times. I did enjoy pet alligators in a Philadelphia mansion. Mr. Biddle is played as an eccentric but lovable husband and father to Cordelia. The writing was the weakest part of the film though. Angie Duke (John Davidson) and Cordelia Biddle (Lesley Ann Warren) obviously love each other but face their families quarreling over wedding plans.

The film is predictable. I would have liked to have special features such as recollections about the film and the making of it. The musical was a Broadway hit with Walter Pidgeon playing Mr. Biddle and toured the country as well. I would have liked a special feature in explaining this movie and its inspiration behind the making and the film's history. This film obviously gets forgotten among other popular Disney musical films. I do enjoy seeing Hermione Baddeley play a maid again as she did in ""Mary Poppins"" and on the television sitcom, ""Maude."" I would have liked to know about the alligators as pets.",1464912000,2,2103,4.740437158469946

Fred MacMurray does and admirable job of showing the transition that parents go thru when their children come of age. The various ""vignettes"" that combine to form the story as a whole, blend well with all the characters.

This movie also has a musical component which does not overwhelm the viewer but enhances the story line.
The final ending is one you'll cheer.
This is a good movie for the entire family to watch and will no doubt be treasured in your movie collection as it is now in mine

1043346,2,6305512043,"The story goes that this was the last live action film that Walt Disney personally attended to prior to his untimely death.  If true, this movie may well be what killed him.  For the record, I am a big Fred MacMurray fan.  His acting credits span four decades with stellar dramatic and comedic roles.  The one thing he wasn't, however, was a singer.  We gave up watching this movie after about 30 minutes and that was 15 minutes too long.  Even the Sherman brothers couldn't save this one.

I have been rather fond of Tommy Steele and have always been a huge fan of Leslie Ann Warren (from Mission Impossible to Clue)...but this movie is way below mediocre.  By comparison, the Kurt Russell Disney Trilogy (The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes, Now You See Him and The Strongest Man in the World) are high art and infinitely more entertaining.

If you are a Fred MacMurray fan, pass on this movie and rent Double Indemnity, The Caine Mutiny, The Egg and I, The Absent MInded Professor or even Follow Me Boys.  They are far better testaments to the talent of Mr. MacMurray.

If you are a Tommy Steele fan, rent Half A SixPence--the music is MUCH better.

And for all you Leslie Ann Warren fans, rent Clue -- absolutely the finest movie ever based on a board game.",1417651200,,1256,4.508849557522124
1043347,5,6305512043,"Back in 1967, critics generally panned this turn-of-the-century Disney musical as being rambunctiously and fatally out of touch with the real word, where headlines were dominated by hippies, feminism, race riots, Vietnam War protests and convulsive college-campus upheavals.  In the eyes of the critics, the movie's giddy Broadway-style ditties were obscenely anachronistic and simple-minded.  Certainly childish.  Possibly even irresponsible in an era with traumas that needed to be addressed, not glossed over by such pap.  The days of turn-of-the-century nostalgia were done.

They seemed to say that Walter Elias Disney--who was the personal embodiment of this movie's values, sentimentality and outlook--had become irrelevant, obsolete.  This was especially biting because Walt had died just six months earlier, and, with this being the last movie he oversaw from beginning to end, he deserved a better epitaph.

But maybe this movie was it after all.

To begin with, the concept of a turn-of-the-century musical was a savvy business decision when it was conceived: at that time, this genre had generated the biggest blockbusters in Hollywood, most recently and most lucratively ""Mary Poppins"" and ""My Fair Lady,"" which had been preceded by other Disney hits like ""Pollyanna"" and ""Summer Magic,"" to name just a couple.  And it's fitting to remember Walt as a shrewd businessman, especially in light of criticism to the contrary when this movie premiered.

More importantly, the film showcases Walt's most deeply cherished ideals: that family values are the most important and that persistent kindness and optimism are chief among them.

The setting is also quintessentially Walt.  He turned again and again to the turn of the century, to a world where streets were populated by both horses and motor cars.  In addition to the aforementioned motion pictures, he delighted in the production of ""Toby Tyler,"" ""The Adventures of Gallagher,"" ""The One and Only Original Family Band,"" and countless others.  It's his turf.  It's no mistake that ""Main Street USA"" is the prerequisite for any tourist wishing to visit a Disneyland-style theme park.  It's the vision of Walt's childhood come to life, where he often retreated for the soothing balm of nostalgia and comfort food (grilled cheese sandwiches and chili) in his little apartment above the Disneyland firehouse.

And although Walt's critics are quite correct that his films' ideals and simplicity banished life's harshest realities in favor of happy endings, it's equally true that his films bore the gravitas of life's lessons.  In ""Mary Poppins,"" it was that, despite the demands of making a living, we must fight to make sure that we really live--and that we relish life's greatest joys by embracing our children.  In this sense, ""The Happiest Millionaire"" is a fitting bookend: it reminds us that another time comes later when we must let them go.

The film is so quintessentially Walt that it's hard to understand why the critics were so peevish about this one: it was so congruent with so many of his own successes and even with other hits like ""My Fair Lady.""  And perhaps that was the problem: it was inevitably judged based on comparisons with such towering successes.  And then, as mentioned earlier, the movie was also a victim of the disillusionment at the time (though despite what Walt's critics alleged, turn-of-the-century musicals had not really run out of gas yet; the biggest hits were yet to come: ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"" and ""Hello Dolly."")

At $5 million at the box office, this movie would have usually been deemed a success for a Disney film in that day.  But for this movie, they spent a quarter of a million on costumes alone, and its lavish production values kept it from turning a profit (not the first time Walt's perfectionistic creative drives exceeded eventual commercial success).

And although the characters are compelling, the pacing steady and the viewing experience generally excellent, this movie fell into a black hole for nearly 20 years.  It was never shown on TV's ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" on a Sunday evening as nearly every other Disney movie was.  Most people--even Disney fans--forgot about it.  It was as if it never existed.  Until it was discovered and run on the Disney Channel in the 1980s--and then released successively on VHS and DVD.

Now it's hard to imagine it being regarded as such a dud.

In fact, it's alive and well at Disneyland: The movie's liveliest tunes--""Fortuosity"" and ""Let's Have a Drink on It""--can be heard as background music on Main Street USA.  The oddish phone booth kept in the Biddles front hall was preserved and installed in Disneyland's exclusive Club 33 restaurant.  And if you're not lucky enough (and rich enough) to have a Club 33 membership, you can visit Cafe Orleans at Disneyland to see pieces of the bar from ""The Happiest Millionaire""'s big fight scene.

But don't wait for your next visit to Disneyland.  Order ""The Happiest Millionaire"" today, and enjoy the quintessential film experience from the incomparable Walter Elias Disney.",1416960000,,5090,5.135922330097087

1043385,2,6305512043,"A musical version of the Broadway play, filmed on the cheap by Walt Disney Productions. The happiest millionaire appears to be living on a soundstage with walls that bounce and shake when doors are shut, unattached seams in the wallpaper and bric-a-brac from a dusty prop room. Disney darling Fred MacMurray mugs his way through a story that doesn't really need him as a protagonist. Oddly, the production sacrificed a lot of the budget to the dress designer who indulges in a dayglow Edwardian fashion show which is interesting at first but then becomes grating on the eyes. Why the two stars? Lesley Ann Warren as the ingenue is genuinely fun to watch. An underrated comic performer in my opinion. And then there's the great Geraldine Page who turns a possessive mother role into a full portrait of a silly, endearing and rather heartbreaking human being. I was unaware that this version of the film is a new ""extended cut"" and not the original edit that was released theatrically in 1967.

1043503,3,6305512043,"I bought this movie because I was reminded of it when a John Oliver/Daily Show bit on Detroit's bankruptcy featured a scene. I remembered having seen the movie as a kid, although all I could recall about it was alligators in the bathtub. My kids (12 & 20) like it in the way they like watching the old Batman on TV -- it's entertaining in an almost campy kind of way. Although the story is different, it sometimes seems a retread of Mary Poppins (Rich folks from long ago & their servants & children, set to music). Hermione Baddeley doesn't even seem to have changed her costume.

The music is peppy but not that interesting. As in Poppins, the father has song in which he mostly speaks (What's Wrong With That). There are no winsome children, but 3 squeaky clean teens of indeterminate age. The daughter (played by Lesley Ann Warren) is the focus, so her (perhaps younger?) brothers make one appearance for one song, their dad mentions they are going to boarding school, & they are never heard of again. They seem to have existed in the movie solely to sing that one song.

The premise of the play on which the movie is based (& the book on which the play is based) seems to have been: Dad was eccentric, so I (the daughter, Cordelia Drexel Biddle) struggled to find my way among in a society that valued conformity. This was also the idea behind Cheaper By the Dozen, but Gilbreth's personality seems stronger, because it's written that way -- Fred MacMurray may have been miscast -- he's too laid back to seem eccentric -- props like a boxing ring & the alligators seem to substitute for projecting a really unusual persona.

This musical seems designed to showcase the talents of Tommy Steele, who was a British teen idol at the time. The prominence of Steele (who plays the family's Irish butler) also diminishes the presentation of the father's character. The love story between  Cordelia & Angier Duke has a confusing conflict: the implication is that the eccentric Drexel Biddles represent Philadelphia old money, while the Dukes are New York arrivistes, but from North Carolina, which makes them seem like plantation gentry.

Academy Award winner Greer Garson is in the film but has nothing to do but stand around looking aristocratic & understanding at the same time. Unlike her Poppins counterpart, she seems to have no interests of her own - just shopping & humoring her husband. Although seemingly everyone else in the movie gets a song, she does not.

The movie, not surprisingly, does not follow the actual history of the Biddle-Duke union. The film is set in 1916 (the better to highlight Biddle's work with the Marines), while in real life, Cordelia gave birth to her first child in 1915. Angier Duke had his hand amputated in a boat accident, & although ships and yachts form a large part of the art introducing the movie, there's nothing about Duke's missing hand or boats in this movie. He supposedly wants to break free of his overpowering mama, & leave the family tobacco business for a chance to earn his own way in Detroit's brand new auto industry. I couldn't find any online record that he had anything to do with the auto industry.

We're from the Detroit area, so we felt sad contrasting the city's the bankruptcy & the movie's vision of Detroit as a place of golden dreams. The movie was released the year of the riots (1967), so perhaps most of the original viewers suffered that jolt as well.

In the final analysis, this was worth the $10 I paid for it, but not more.",1378080000,3,3500,4.633870967741935
1043504,4,6305512043,"Nobody sets out to make a dud, but somehow these things just happen anyway.  Watching this film for the first time in decades (having forgotten it even existed), I was struck by the fact that everyone involved was working as hard as they could but the results just weren't growing roses.  Having competent singers might have helped.  Having songs worth singing would have also helped immensely.  Tightening the story to keep it from straying from the point would have also helped matters greatly.  This was, after all, supposedly a biography of a real person (Biddle, played by Fred MacMurray) yet more time was lavished on the budding romance of his daughter (Lesley Ann Warren) and her newly acquired boyfriend (John Davidson).  It might have helped promote their careers but it did nothing to keep the story in check.  When the focus is kept on MacMurray and Greer Garson, the film is packed with fun (and gators).  When it veers off into the more mundane matters of other characters, it falls flat.  They managed to give his two sons (Paul Petersen and Eddie Hodges) a single song before shipping them off to boarding school, never to be seen again.  Why couldn't they have done the same thing with their dreary daughter?
Other than that, Greer Garson was elegant, Gladys Cooper was all nasty in the best way possible, so too a much underused Geraldine Page.  Hermione Baddeley was amusing.  Tommy Steele was all teeth and a wink.  His song (Fortuosity) was the only one I could remember afterwards and not in a good way.
I wouldn't label it the worst musical ever set to film.  I did enjoy most of it.  I'm definitely keeping it in my collection and wouldn't hesitate to watch it again.  But.

The Drexel-Biddles are old-stock Philadelphia, Biddle is an uncommon man in an era of conventionality, especially among the aristocracy. He loves boxing and built his own ring in the old stables, and started the Biddle Bible Clubs; he also captured 20+ alligators in Florida and keeps them in pools in the conservatory of his house (all of this is documented). His aunt Mary Drexel, a role captured beautifully by Gladys Cooper lives ""just around the corner"" from the Biddles, and she attempts to bring some order to the chaotic household. When daughter, (Leslie Ann Warren) is sent away to school, she falls in love with the heir to the Duke fortune, Algier Buchanan Duke (John Davidson). The differences between the wealthy Dukes (new money) and the Biddles (old money) is charmingly captured in song. Geraldine Page (Mrs. Sarah Duke) and Cooper (Aunt Mary Drexel) duel ever so cleverly over the differences in social mores between NYC and Philadelphia, the talky-singy duet, ""There Are Those"" points out these social more differences. It is a movie the whole family will probably enjoy. Following on the heels of Mary Poppins, the movie didn't do as well at the box office, probably because the music isn't as singable as the music from the prior Disney hit, but the movie seems to be making a well-deserved come-back now that it is on DVD. Greer Garson is lovely as Biddle's wife; low-key and elegant, she is the perfect foil for his mad-cap parenting style. The Duke University, of course, is named for the Duke family, and Sarah Duke is memorialized in the Duke gardens on the university grounds. The story is embellished truth told humorously.",1373932800,,1896,4.9842271293375395

But that said, Leslie Anne Warren brings a level of heart to the film and pretty much owns it.  John Davidson is likable, and Greer Garson (sp?) brings a subtle sophistication to the table that softens the broadness of Fred MacMurray.  Over all it becomes a fun musical from another era when perhaps folks were able to suspend disbelief a little easier and just enjoy people breaking out into song and archetypal characters.

1043602,2,6305512043,"I was sorry to hear of the death of Robert Sherman a few days ago, and this week I'm holding my own personal tribute to his memory by watching some of the films which the Sherman brothers worked on.  And so tonight I watched the 1967 musical ""The Happiest Millionaire,"" a DVD I've had at hand for a few months but hadn't yet viewed. I may have seen this film when I was quite young, but I had no recollection of any specifics of the film whatsoever.

Yikes. This is a film I really wanted to like---and was expecting to enjoy---but man, did it fall flat. I found it incredibly dull and slow-moving; true enough, I viewed the original cut of the longer roadshow version, but I don't think any number of trims would have brought this to life.

Problems? Well, sad to say the score was second-string; nowhere near the best of what the Sherman Brothers were capable. The juvenile leads, while attractive, were colourless and uninteresting. And perhaps most troublesome, I gather that we were supposed to find MacMurray's title character a loveable eccentric? Instead he was an insufferable bore; an irritating jerk.

Holy cow, this film dragged on and on and I was hard-pressed to maintain any interest in the proceedings. It wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't particularly good either.

Now, to be fair, there were things I liked about it. I appreciated the period sets and decor, and the real pleasure of the film came in seeing some all-time Hollywood greats like Greer Garson, Gladys Cooper, and Geraldine Page in primary roles. But even they couldn't enliven the leaden script to any great degree. For me personally, the ONLY time that the film came to life was when Geraldine Page was on the screen. Unfortunately, she didn't even show up until after the half-way point, and all her scenes put together probably didn't add up to much more than 15 or 20 minutes of screen time---just a drop in the bucket compared to the overall running time of 172 minutes. (Though to be accurate, some of those oh-sooooo-long minutes of total running time were taken up with the overture, intermission, and exit music.)

Sorry to say that I didn't find any of the songs the least bit memorable---I would have to say that this is easily my least-favourite Sherman brothers film, out of all I've seen.

Still, I'm not sorry I viewed it this one time. And I may even cue through it every now and again, to re-watch those portions of the film featuring Geraldine Page. But I can't imagine that I'll bother ever watching it right through again. My two-star rating may seem a bit harsh, but I really couldn't summon up the enthusiasm to give it three stars.",1331078400,3,2643,4.6587982832618025

My opinion of a movie is based on did I enjoy it for what it is, every movie made is not a classic but can be entertaining, thought provoking or hit that emotional nerve that makes you feel something be it good or bad.  I purchased this movie based on the reviews, which still are overwhelmingly favorable.  I watched it with my wife and grandmother and we each had the same opinion, this isn't very good, in fact it is bad, to our taste.  I like musicals but the songs, to me, were not catchy and the singers not very good or believable and the characters not really even likable.  In Poppins, The Sound of Music, Lady and The Tramp, Jungle Book, Song of the South, I could go on and on, there is the ability of the viewer to suspend disbelief, meaning of course that you are willing to go along for the ride of the story.  I didn't feel that way about this film.  I can't even think of a film that I can compare it with and say that if you liked film ""A"" then you will probably like film ""B"".

I know exactly what scenes were added back, and I have to say that it's obvious why they were cut in the first place. This wouldn't be so bad if it had the option to watch the uncut version, but it doesn't. If you don't think it'll make that much difference, know that I will be buying it again in the original cut. I can't even stand to watch the new dvd - I watch my old vhs despite the lower quality picture. The overall movie is just that much better without those clips.

I have always love this movie when it was on TV.

I must say the extra footage really added something for me though i do think the movie is now at least 20 minutes longer so maybe not all children will want to sit through it any more as one or two segments have become slower.

Great extras are the extensions of the songs of i'll always be irish and no shilly shallying and some small reprises of whats wrong with that. I especially enjoyed the reprise including the marines which had a male chior like feel. The ending is also entirely different than what i've seen. Instead of stopping at the elopement we see the parents returning to their empty home. the song they sing about letting their children go is truly beautiful.

Wow, I was actually impressed because I knew that this was Mr. Disney's last effort to capture the Mary Poppins crowd, and it didn't completely work at the time. That I knew. I think the bad thing was that the songs weren't exciting as Mary Poppins, and many other fine Disney productions.

1043682,5,6305512043,"You could rate this four stars for the edition; I gave it five for the show. The edition would be helped by remastering the film; the color is washed out, the sound could be remixed. That would happen were this a ""Disney Classic"" and not a Vault Disney style budget release. But that would also price it out of its market. What of the show? This film is hurt by the comparisons with Mary Poppins, a film in which many viewers feel Walt got everything right. On it's own, however, it stands up quite well.

It's a film from a musical from a book, and hearkens back to a nearly forgotten time when kids could buy books in school for 50 cents from little newspapers by Scholastic Book Services circulated on Weekly Reader day. One of these was a skinny b&w photo story from this movie. Live action Disney films were just as anticipated as the animated features. How happy they are again being released in affordable versions. The flyer in this DVD case lists three more Fred Mac Murray films: Son of Flubber, Follow Me, Boys, and the even less seen Bon Voyage.

This film was poised at the cusp, as it were, of what may be seen as the end of classic Disney or the rise of a shift in entertainment, as its release coincided with the Summer of Love and the Beatles' Sgt Pepper album. Everything before that time was effectively buried and is only now being unearthed.

This film was directed by Norman Tokar, with Pat Paulsen from The Donna Reed Show in a minor role. It marked the film debut of John Davidson, who would become a household name and have his own variety TV show. The film's tone is hundreds of times more optimistic than anything now. If it won't win Best Musical, the songs are nevertheless quite stick-in-your head memorable. If the acting seems damped and restrained, it's somewhat due to the subdued ""millionaire"" setting, amid which MacMurray and the Biddles stand out as non-conformists or rugged individualists. But there are plenty of action scenes: boxing, bar fights, live alligators, and Tommy Steele as the indefatigable Irish butler. Films like this were made for the big screen, for the Saturday afternoon matinee. That's their true home, where they play best.

The ""Restored Roadshow Edition"" is, frankly, odd. Having not seen the shorter version, I have no idea how much this 172 minute cut exceeds it in length, but there are title cards reading ""Overture"" at the beginning, ""Intermission"" in the middle, and ""Exit"" at the end, clearly meant for theater-going crowds. These add a bit of time on their own. In sum, I think any fan of early Disney would like this film. It would qualify for the way overused term ""Disney Classic"" not by being splashy and lavish, but because it likely fulfill's Walt's vision for his films. It's odd and unique, and may leave you wondering, as it did me, why can't they make films like this today?",1242691200,2,2856,4.627218934911243

What did disappoint was Disney's failure to enhance the Roadshow Edition for 16 x 9 televisions.

1043716,3,6305512043,"It has been told  that film was the last live action Disney film which supervised by Walt himself(The last animated film Walt had his stamp on was the Jungle Book). This forty year old film was and still is a weak musical Disney vehicle. You could see that there were Disney touches in this production. However, in this film, touches would help only slightly...like a bandade does not help a gaping bleeding wound

This musical with songs and score from Richard M. and Robert B. Sherman, the studio's resident songwriting team seems forced into this film. This motion picture could have worked better without being a musical. One of the problems is the film fall flat with the off key and out of tune singing of Fred MacMurray and Greer Garson. British import Tommy Steele as the wise-alec butler John showcases his British song and dance reputation. the two vocal duets of Leslie Anne Warren (who was hand picked for this role by Disney himself ) and John Davidson is sweet, but too few.

One would assume this movie would be in genre of Mary Poppins, Disney's other live action musical hit...but it misses in many ways including its casting. Fred MacMurray may have been a great actor for the studio, but he is the weak link as the Biddle father figure. The characters of the Biddle boys (Paul Peterson & Eddie Hodges) vanish after one scene

In hinesight, this stylized musical seems like a dinosaur in the Disney Backlist compare to other films.  Norman Tokar's direction, which is usually fast paced,  focus on odd long shots, focusing on MacMurray's close ups  and Tommy Steele's smiling mug, rather than moving this film to any pacing.

As classic family entertainment, It is okay. but rather long timewise and tonewise. For those parents who want to share this film with their kids, note this DVD is the Roadshow edition which has an intermission. so I suggest ,you can show this film to the kids in two parts

With all the talent involved, I rate it three stars for all that is jammed into this movie.

1043718,3,6305512043,"Once upon a time I was involved in a discussion about favorite movies and someone said that their favorite film of all time was THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE.  I had never heard of the film before.  The person told me that the film was a corny Disney musical starring Fred MacMurray.  After now having seen the film for myself, I agree that the film is kind of corny, but it is full of enough quirky and eccentric moments to make it beguiling.

Released in 1967 THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE was the first of a set of musicals that Disney produced in an attempt to capture the success of the highly popular MARY POPPINS.  The studio had high hopes for the film.  The movie was adapting from a popular (but now mostly forgotten) Broadway stage show of the same name that was in itself adapted from a popular memoir of the time, MY PHILADELPHIA FATHER.  The same songwriting pair of MARY POPPINS was hired to write the songs and lyrics for the show.  Tommy Steele was cast as the Irish butler who serves as a semi-narrator through parts of the show, Fred MacMurray was cast in the title-role of Anthony J. Drexel Biddle, the Happiest Millionaire, and the beautiful and talented Lesley Ann Warren of recent CINDERELLA fame was cast as Cordelia `Cordy' Drexel Biddle.  To top it all off, the film was overseen by Walt Disney himself and was the last live-action film that he ever was involved with.

The film didn't live up to expectations.  Initially it only made $5 million and the only Oscar nomination was for costumes.  The movie was also apparently panned by critics at the time thus regulating it to the unknown status it has retained for sometime.  There isn't anything outstanding about THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE and there isn't much of a plot.  Yet, what the film lacks in substance it makes up for in charm.

Taking place in 1916 Philadelphia the movie is basically a story about a daughter's coming of age and the changing relationship between herself and her beloved father.  Anthony J. Drexel Biddle was a real life eccentric millionaire who kept alligators in his mansion, led Bible classes that involved boxing, was trained in judo, and became an officer in the U.S. Marines when he was over forty to train young cadets in hand-to-hand combat.  The movie begins with the arrival of the Biddle's new butler, John Lawless (Tommy Steele) straight off the boat from Ireland.  Lawless serves as a pseudo-narrator through parts of the film.  We first meet the Biddles through Lawless' eyes and from time to time he discusses with the audience about the events taking place on screen.  Anthony Biddle's daughter Cordy (Lesley Ann Warren) is growing up and wishes to leave for school.  Her father is opposed to the idea, but eventually consents.  Cordy leaves and soon finds herself in love and engaged to a wealthy New Yorker named Angie Duke (John Davidson).  These two love birds are madly in love, but Cordy is from Philadelphia and Angie is from New York and their families live in completely different worlds.

I found THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE to be enjoyable, but in a hit and miss fashion.  The sets and costumes are quite lovely, the acting is decent, and the singing and dance numbers are reminiscent of the days of a beautiful by-gone era.  I like Fred MacMurray and his role in the film and I got a kick out of Tommy Steele's performance as John Lawless.  Actually, most of the cast is quite good.  Yet, the film just doesn't stand out.  Most of the songs are quite entertaining but other ""Fortuosity"", ""Let's Have a Drink On It"", and the bittersweet ""It Wont' Be Long"" there aren't any memorable tunes.  There really isn't much plot to the movie and after awhile some of the antics seem repetitive.  Instead of a concise, well-told story, the movie feels more like a series of scenes and sketches that are loosely connected by the relationship between the characters.  Such a device often works well in a book, can sometimes be pulled off on stage, but usually doesn't make for a very good movie especially a musical.

THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE is a movie worth watching once.  Though it doesn't really standout in any way, it can be seducing with its charm.  It's not a movie I'll probably watch again for awhile, but I do want to read and research more about the real-life Anthony Biddle.",1171152000,6,4295,4.688918558077437
1043719,3,6305512043,"""The Happiest Millionaire"" is not pleasingly perfect in every way. I enjoyed it, but I had to work at it. Some songs of humor. Quite surprisingly, Fred MacMurray, usually stoic (not showing emotion), is a good singer who can carry a high note for some time. His song with Greer Garson, at the end, is good.

The film is more interesting if you know that the film was based upon a true story; there really was a millionaire Mr. Biddle, who owned alligators which froze and thawed, ran a Bible study for reformed drunks, had a boxing ring, practiced Judo, smoked to cure his asthma, and had trouble keeping servants, until he hired a butler from Ireland, all in the book ""My Philadelphia Father"". Truth is stranger than fiction, so much so, the truth appears unbelievable in the film. When you compare this film to the generally bad television and films of today, it is entertaining. Musicals I recommend solidly ahead of this one are: Disney's ""Summer Magic"", the 1937 ""Maytime"", and ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"".

The same Sherman brothers who wrote the songs for ""Mary Poppins"", and the same dance choreographer. However, I do not believe Walt was really involved, and you can tell the difference. Mr. Disney was involved in the immense challenge of starting Disney World, secretly buying up land in Florida, running Disneyland in California, planning a ski resort, running the Cal Arts school, running his animation studio, producing several other films, spending more time on vacation with his family, and dying in the advanced stages of lung cancer; he did not live to see this film released. The film is a comedy, with some silliness, needing better plot, more focus, and more grounding stability. The acting is often veiled and distant, with glimpses of joy. Tommy Steele is good as the singing, dancing, butler, puzzled by it all. The opposing wealthy family matriarchs (mother-in-law, grandmother or aunt) singing about their wealthy family being better than the other is funny.

This silly film with a weak script, and without depth, has some fun songs, and humor that is interesting if you know it really is a true story.

There are three formats on Amazon, two of the formats are 20 minutes longer. The third Road Show Edition, is twice as much money as the other two, apparently only for wide-screen. I recommend the cheaper longer version.",1169683200,2,2349,4.865
1043755,4,6305512043,"""The happiest Millionare"" was a big roadshow musical Walt Disney produced in 1967 following the smashing success of ""Mary Poppins.""

Lightning did not strike twice.

The film was dismissed by the critics, returned only $5 million to the studio, and received only a single Oscar nomination, for cotumes.

It is time to re-habilitate this fine work of entertainment.

Since Disney was a staunch Republican, it is no surprise that he chose for his source material, the antics of the Biddle family of Phildelphia at a time when there were few Democrats in Philadelphia, circa 1916.

The film boasts an all star cast which is worth the price of admission, or a dvd.  Fred MacMurray, then at the height of his ""My Three Sons"" fame, stars as Tony Biddle, eccentric millionare who irritates the establishment from keeping live alligators in his house to Aunt Mary, a crusty old society matron delightfully played by Gladys Cooper.  Greer Garson stars as Mrs. Biddle and is enchanting.  There was always something very intiguing about Ms. Garson; her blend of warmth plus a littler daftness make for an interesting character.  Tommy Steele is here in his first American picture and you either like him or you don't.  His enthusiasm frequently goes over the top, and he is a little big for the screen, but i enjoy him and admire his great dancing ability, amply shown in this picture.  Leslie Ann Warren and John Davidson are the young lovers the story revolves around.  Looking at the picture now it seems they were stuck in a time warp-it could have been made in 1947 not '67.  They give their numbers their all and they just don't do it like they used to.  This can either entice a modern musical enthusiast, or turn off today's audience so wary and weary of musicals.

It is left to Miss Geraldine Page to walk off with the entire picture, and she doesn't even appear till into the second act.  As Mrs. Duke, John Davidson's mother, Miss Page knows her way around a sound studio.  She also knew that less IS more and is so stunning in her comic moments as your basic New York Society snob.  However, the character is from North Carolina, so Miss Page is able to employ that classic accent, that had served her so well, in ""The Happiest Millionare.""  Her costumes are a riot and her bitchy duet with Miss Cooper is a hoot in the ""Bosom Buddies"" tradition.

The look of the picture is drop dead gorgeous as befitted a big budget musical of the era.  At 172 minutes, the picture may be a little long, especially for kids who were the original target audience.  The ad campaign stated this was a show in the ""Mary Poppins"" tradition, and it is not.  It is a grown up musical with nothing offensive for children.  There may one or two too many numbers, and the score is nowhere near ""Mary Poppins"" but stick with it till near the end when Greer Garson and Mac Murray sing ""It Won't Be Long Till Christmas.""  This was cut before the movie opened and was not on the original soundtrack.  The cd has a different version of the song not from the film soundtrack, as a bonus.  It is wistful, contented and a bit sad as is inevitible when parents are facing an empty nest.

And where, but in a Disney musical could you find a cuddly alligator named George.  Tommy Tune and George do a show-stopping Act One Finale to a reprise of the film's best song, ""Fortuosity,"" straight from vaudeville.  A real treat.",1167782400,3,3389,4.5721393034825875

1043762,5,6305512043,"In her eighth film (there were also two TV movies mixed in there) Geraldine Page plays a slightly unusual character for her, for in this show she plays the mother of John Davidson and when she hears about his growing attraction for Cordelia (the effervescent Lesley Ann Warren from TV's CINDERELLA) Page gets on the warpath.  You don't see her playing the ""mother in law battle axe"" role often, but she brings a different shading to it, perhaps from all her years in the famed Actors Studio in New York, which used to be a real school long before the wretched James Lipton got hold of it and turned it into a combination fund-raising resource and personality parade.

This was Geraldine Page's first film project following her appearance (also taped and still available) in Chekhov's THE THREE SISTERS, with Kim Stanley and Sandy Dennis, and some of the tried and true Chekhovian sadness and melancholy poke through her trimmings as Mrs Duke, an aristocrat of the same period as Chekhov was writing about.  She stands out even in a cast of brilliant actors that includes Tommy Steele, Fred McMurray, Greer Garson, and Gladys Cooper, all of them putting their best foot forward, a little intimidated no doubt by a) co-starring in a Geraldine Page movie and b) laboring away under the personal supervision of Mr. Walt Disney, whose very last movie this is.  A master of unconventional casting, Disney personally selected Geraldine Page for the role after rejecting fifty other actresses.",1093219200,10,1485,4.904382470119522
1043763,3,6305512043,"Walt Disney's was a visionary film pioneer; he took the fledgling craft of animation and transformed it into an art form of the highest order, and, in the process, altered our collective perception of what childhood is all about. However, occasionally that vision was marred by Disney's own lack of foresight into changing audience tastes. By the end of the 1950s the Walt Disney Studios had incurred huge expenses on Disney's foray into live action films, the birth of his theme park - Disneyland - and the lack luster box office response to his most recent and most expensive animated feature - Sleeping Beauty. Though the old master was set to recoup his losses, the sumptuously mounted, though often dismal, The Happiest Millionaire (released the year after Disney's death) was the personal and financial failure that rounded out Disney's tenure as the mogul of one of Hollywood's great cinema dream factories.

Throughout the 1950s and 60s road show engagements for movies of distinction were quite common. Road shows were designed to elevate movies to the lofty ambitions of live theater. They usually began with a lush orchestrated prelude, included an intermission half way through, and exit music to escort audiences out of the theater after the final credit sequence. One often dressed up for this sort of premiere event, certainly paid extra to attend and was often provided with a printed program as a keep sake from the occasion. Disney had attempted the road show only once before, on Fantasia (1940) and the result had been an unqualified financial disaster.  What a pity then, that The Happiest Millionaire - what should have been an eighty-minute tune-filled - if antiseptic and sexless - melodrama, is over inflated into a gargantuan three hours spectacle that, quite simply, fails to dazzle.
The plot is a fictionalized account of real life circumstances that concern an eccentric Philadelphia millionaire, Anthony J. Drexel Biddle (Fred MacMurray). He runs a combination Bible and physical fitness college of sorts, loves boxing and keeps alligators in a solarium adjacent his dining room. When immigrant John Lawless (Tommy Steele) becomes Biddle's new butler he does indeed find his new surroundings rather odd. Not that Lawless isn't odd himself - it's just that, unlike Biddle's quirkiness, which can be grating to the point of distraction, Lawless becomes a genuinely loveable reprobate of congenial good humor, thanks to Tommy Steele's remarkable performance. The plot is thread bare to the point of nonexistent. It concerns Biddle's only daughter, Cordelia (Lesley Ann Warren). She's a sort of tomboy desperate to be feminine and sent off to a lady's finishing school where she meets and becomes engaged to New Yorker Angie Duke (John Davidson). Mrs. Duke (Geraldine Page) is social snob but Angie doesn't share her values. He wants to forgo the family business and build automobiles in Detroit. True to Disney form, everything does indeed work out in the end with Angie and Cordelia driving off toward an unintentionally apocalyptic matte painting that depicts the Motor City as something of a cross between Blade Runner and Mary Poppins, a glowering jungle of towering chimneys blackening the skies with the aftershocks of modernity.

Plot construction is problematic; As Cordelia's mother, Greer Garson is given extremely little to do. One of Disney's good luck charms - Hemione Baddeley has even less of a say. Equally curious is the fact that after the film takes great pains to introduce the Biddle two sons Tony and Livingston (Paul Petersen and Eddie Hodges) - even giving them a song - it suddenly loses interest in their character development by sending them off to school where, as an audience, we forget that they ever existed.
Of course, the plot - such as it is - would be largely forgivable if Disney's resident song writers, the Sherman Brothers had come up with a score worthy of their best endeavors.  Tommy Steele opens the show with a bang with, Fortuosity, but the rest of the score does not live up to expectations and, in spots, is painfully sweet and cuddly. Valentine Candy or Boxing Gloves is so coy one wishes for the elegant Tommy Steele to burst into the room and tap dance its treacle into silence. All in all, Steele is remarkably well served by the score, belting out I'll Always Be Irish and several other songs with such austerity and charm that he easily dismisses the awkward lyrics. His choreography by Mark Breaux and Dee Dee Wood showcase Steele's finer points, particularly in the barroom number that closes the second half of the show. Unfortunately, there are no memorable showstoppers that leave one with a sudden urge to run out and buy the soundtrack or even leave the theater humming.
THE TRANSFER: This re-released DVD of The Happiest Millionaire is about as dismal as the film itself. Everything's present: the Overture, Entr'acte and Exit music, but the transfer is not enhanced for widescreen televisions. Unlike the previously available DVD from Anchor Bay, colors seem somewhat more dated this time around and fine details breaks apart with a considerable amount of pixelization and edge enhancement, especially when viewed on a larger monitor.  There are also several cases where mis-registration of the camera negative results in an excessively blurry print - something else absent on Anchor Bay's version. This DVD compresses the entire running time on one side of the disc, which I suspect is the biggest problem. There are no extras, not even the trailer.

But it is a very long movie (aren't all musicals?) so that may be why.  The story is based on fact (exactly how close it comes I don't know!)and concerns a millionaire who is, to say the least, quite eccentric.  He runs off servants constantly, but manages to hire as his butler John Lawless from Ireland, who fits in perfectly.  McMurray, who plays the millionaire who hates change, was perfect in this part, as he fights sending his daughter off to finishing school and then fights even harder when she gets engaged.  John Davidson plays the fiance (I think this might have been his first big screen role)and is both good-looking and likeable.  The songs are good & some scenes are memorable indeed, like the high-class duel-of-words between Aunt Mary and Mrs. Duke or the hangover scene when they go to get Angie (Davidson) out of jail.

THANK YOU GRANDMA FOR INTRODUCING ME TO SUCH A WONDERFUL, FUN FILLED MOVIE, AND FOR BROADENING MY HORIZON.",1042243200,3,606,4.371681415929204
1043818,5,6305512043,"Alright, I admit it - John Davidson was my schoolgirl crush.  I grew up watching Happiest Millionaire and to this day I just love that guy.  My question is, now that I've got Happiest Millionaire in my video collection, when can we expect One and Only Genuine Original Family Band?  I've tried asking Disney Store people but no one seems to remember the movie.  Anyone out there know what I'm talking about?  It's another great musical with Lesley Ann Warren and John Davidson.  Classic Disney.  Let's call Michael Eisner if we have to.  This movie has got to be made available.",1039478400,10,578,4.653465346534653

1043820,5,6305512043,"A carefree millionaire(Disney Style), played by Fred MacMurray, lives life his own way, sometimes bordering on Addams Family-esque habits, such as keeping Alligators as pets and going on a chocolate cake diet! With his two sons soon to leave for school, he is disturbed to find that his only daughter is now engaged and will be out of his life too. The story is told somewhat from the cheerful Irish butler's musical point of view. Tommy Steele portrays the butler and steals the show! The film is great traditional Disney fun!

I fell in love with non-roadshow version of Happiest Millionaire a few years ago when seeing it on the Disney Channel, and it has since become one of my all time favorite films. Then, I found out there was a roadshow version, and, when I started switching from VHS to DVD a year or so ago, I decided to order both versions from Amazon. I recommend fans of the shorter version do what I did and buy both the shorter one AND this roadshow version. Why? Well, I felt they were so different! I knew I loved the shorter version, so I HAD to see the Roadshow version! It's just a matter of one having more scenes than the other, but the shorter version is simpler, one you'd watch with your kids, and the longer (Roadshow) version is the more grown-up version. Sometimes, you just want to watch the simple, happy, short version, and sometimes you want to watch the real deal. I don't know, but I LOVE them both, but when you started out with the short version, it just won't do to only have the Roadshow.",998784000,60,1527,4.473118279569892
1043821,5,6305512043,"Fred MacMurray, Tommy Steele, Lesley Ann Warren and John Davidson star in the classic Disney musical THE HAPPIEST MILLIONAIRE, a delightful story centering on the Biddle family of Philadelphia.
Cordy Biddle (Lesley Ann Warren) becomes engaged to Angie Duke (John Davidson).  When  this should be a happy occasion, Angie's snooty mother (Geraldine Page) still ensures that Angie hangs onto her apron strings.  Cordy's mother (Greer Garson) tries to sort things out while Aunt Mary (Gladys Cooper) engages in some bitchy repartee with Mrs Duke!
The entire production is flawless, and while Leonard Maltin has criticised this film for being too long, I think the time flies by.
The Sherman brothers songs are strong throughout, and the supporting cast, including a very young Joyce Bulifant, are wonderful.
Highly recommended.",985132800,10,823,5.4140625
1043822,5,6305512043,"It's wonderful to see the roadshow version out on DVD-it has been shown on the Disney Channel, but from poorer source material than this, and a short dialog sequence setting up the final number was still missing.  But it is all here, and the transfer is stunning-Disney always demanded the best from Technicolor, and it shows.  For those that only saw the 118-minute version, this is a must!",971481600,2,391,4.735294117647059
1043823,5,6305512043,"I am a fan of Fred MacMurray and so I love this film.  However, aside from that this movie is great because is portrays a family that is very close.  They are unique and proud of it.  The children are taught that being  different is good and that the family is most important. I believe that one  of America's major problems is that the families are so divided.  I love  the relationship Cordy has with her father and the relationship between the  parents. Cordy's life does not revolve around her friends.  Those types of  relationships are needed in the world today.  The father does not come off  looking like a goofball with a wife who has to ""fix"" him and make  him socially acceptable.  It is very refreshing to see a Disney movie that  is portraying famliy values.  I also love the fact that it is a musical by  the Sherman Brothers.  It is based on the book ""My Philadelphia  Father"" by Cordelia Drexel Biddle.  I read the book and loved it.  The  video is very similar.",957139200,3,978,4.406779661016949
