2893716,4,B000T28G1E,Enjoyed watching this series.  Only saw the last few episodes on cartoon network then watched season two and have been hooked ever since.  When I saw this come out I had to get it and it didn't disappoint.  Can't wait for season two to come out.,1196812800,2,245,4.282608695652174
2893717,5,B000T28G1E,"Pending US licencing - A GRAND future

I first encountered this series approx ep. 20 on Cartoon Network - investigated and discovered it is adapted from a Manga that is still being published - for Japanese release 150+ half hour TV episodes, 2 full length movies (2nd due to release in Dec 07) and 300+ Manga chapters/episodes - lots left to animate.

My only fear is that the licencing will prevent the future episodes from making it to the US - after all, Ghost In The Shell took forever to make it to the US.",1196467200,2,511,4.368421052631579
2893718,5,B000T28G1E,"I am not a fan of anime, but my wife got me hiiked on Bleach. This is a great show for anyone, wide array of characters, good storylines, and good music make this a great show.",1194998400,3,176,3.9166666666666665
2893719,4,B000T28G1E,"Ichigo Kurosaki is just your average teenage boy... except that he can see spirits.

So it's not exactly surprising that he gets involved in wild, dangerous adventures, in the first season of the hilarious, action-packed ""Bleach."" It starts off a bit slow, but rapidly winds into a thrilling, expansive adventure story, with lots of big swords, roaring monsters, and TV psychics.

One night a strange girl appears in Ichigo's bedroom, and is shocked when he can see her. She explains that she's a Soul Reaper, who helps the dead pass on to the Soul Society, and destroys evil spirits called Hollows.

But when Rukia is injured in a fight with a Hollow, all her powers are transferred to Ichigo -- and with them, the responsibility of killing Hollows. Ichigo soon finds out that it isn't easy juggling his new responsibilities with his normal, everyday life -- especially since the powerless Rukia is now attending his school, and living in his closet.

Even more distressing, his new powers are attracting all sorts of trouble: the Hollow who murdered his mother, the now-monstrous brother of his ditzy friend Orihime, an outspoken ""mod-soul,"" and classmate Uryu-- the last of the Quincys, sworn enemies of Soul Reapers. Moreover, Orihime and the gentle giant Chad start developing spiritual powers of their own.

But then two powerful Soul Reapers show up to arrest Rukia. Ichigo is left mortally wounded and robbed of his powers, while Rukia is taken back to the Soul Society to be executed. To rescue Rukia, Ichigo agrees to undergo a terribly training regimen that could leave him worse than dead... and the journey into the Soul Society may be even worse...

Most long-running series run out their welcome pretty quickly, or start following a formula. But ""Bleach"" has that magical mix of complex plot, kinetic action, likable characters and kooky comedy. Not only does it click, but the results are sort of a mad hybrid of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" and ""Inuyasha.""

To keep us entertained, there's lots of action, monsters, blood, giant magical swords, spirit arrows and even a skyscraper-sized Hollow. But the writers keep an eye on the characters, and the first arc is used to establish them -- we get to see their pasts, their motivations, and why they want to fight Hollows.

And just as important important -- comedy. Every episode of ""Bleach"" has some comedy, whether it's crazy friends and/or relatives, TV appearances, or the wacky dialogue (""OH NO! I'M FRIENDS WITH A NERD! Maybe you need some thick nerd glasses...""). Even Ichigo produces some hilarious moments, such as his bloodcurdling scream when he wakes in Urahara's house.

Ichigo himself is the pivot of the whole series -- like many a good anime hero, he is rough, brash, sensitive and fights for those he loves. And though he's incredibly powerful, he still has a lot of training, fighting and learning to do, though he tends to jump in without thinking about it.

And he's backed by a colourful squad of characters: the prickly Ury', quiet Chad, ditzy love interest Orihime, and the mysterious ""Mr. Hat and Clogs"" who trains Ichigo to be a full-fledged Soul Reaper. Not to mention Kon, a living lion doll who provides plenty of comic relief, whether he's getting kicked around the room or dressed as Marie Antoinette.

""Bleach's"" first season introduces viewers to a brilliant series, full of hilarity, tears, blood and big, bad monsters. Definitely a must-see, for anyone who likes any of the above.",1193702400,,3467,4.92967409948542
2893720,5,B000T28G1E,"I like a ton of anime and manga series. I've looked into so many different types and am well versed in anyone series you can name. Very few impact me like Bleach has. I have been following Bleach for some time now. And let me tell you nothing you know can prepare you for it! As far as the Japanese series is the U.S. sure is behind. But it is well worth sticking on too (even in the Bount filler arc). It stays true to the Manga storyline (until like episode 64ish I think but jumps back around episode 109) so you can expect solid things form it. I recommend this to everyone who is a fan of action anime. It grips you and never lets you go. And the characters are so easy to fall in love with. ORDER IT NOW!!!

I would ignore the positive rating on this series, due to the fact that if you did a simple search on review of this series.. You would get the almost identical positive review.  To add further insult, you get a positive review that tells you to stick through the filler.
If you must watch this series, I would only recommend buying the first three seasons. After that, do yourself and your wallet a favor and look elsewhere for quality engaging anime entertainment. Im sorry, but a quality anime shouldnt cause the viewer to force themselves to endure mindless filler to get to the story line. Bleach is nothing but filler.

However, I also ordered the second season boxed set along with this one. THAT one never came in, and the seller said NOTHING about it until a week and a half after the first one arrived, in response to a concerned E-mail I sent them. It rather worries and angers me that they're willing to simply allow something like to happen in order to hopefully pocket some free cash.

Bad customer service. Be wary when purchasing multiple items from this seller. If you do, and one or more do not come in, check your E-mail immediately, and if they haven't said anything about that item being out of stock, they're likely trying to keep your money without you noticing.",1376524800,,862,4.449367088607595

Even though I think that this Aizen business took too long, I do like the show. It is very addicting.

As of now the show did end. I won't say much but I will say after watching the ending of bleach I was very disappointed. I could tell you not to watch dis show because it has a bad ending but I would be lying if I would say I would if someone told me that. Overall this show is noting less than epic right up there with Naruto and One Piece of course if you are a truly knowledgeable anime watcher you would know that the best animes don't just have the best acton, they have characters who are emotionally gripping and powerful stories .

I like bleach alot but the reason i gave it two stars is how the story flows in the anime . First 3 seasons are fantastic. then filler hits. ok fillers fine for a while. next few seasons have filler mixed in. ok. Then the show goes downhill. ichigo and friends go to hueco mundo. this starts the battle with a major enemy that takes almost the rest of the anime to finish. the problem with that is because of that instead of drawing out scenes to stay behind the manga it gets too close and filler happens!

I ordered this on a Monday and hoping to receive it by Saturday, but got it on Thursday of same week.

 Well, lets just say my family (my 23 year old wife, our two year old daughter, and I) are having to pace ourselves with this season due to the fact we will run right through them all without appreciating them. The season is very easy to follow and very interesting. I think after I get all these seasons, I will move on the Death Note volumes.",1341100800,,653,4.0859375
2894034,5,B000T28G1E,"I have been a fan of anime since I was a kid and all we had was Thundercats, Gundam (the original), Speed Racer, and Battle of the Planets.  I've stuck with the genre through adulthood, and have enjoyed a variety of series.  I really have to say that I was apprehensive about watching this series due to the overwhelming teen love for it, but I figured that I like Dragon Ball Z even now (and started watching it in my teens, hence giving that series my teen love!), so what could it hurt to check it out?

I must say, while it is definitely skewed towards a young adult crowd, I really have enjoyed this series.  It doesn't really remind me of Dragon Ball Z as other reviews have stated.  Instead it reminds me a bit of various other series kind of mashed into one.  There are scenes and episodes that remind me of Crono Crusade, Samurai Champloo, My-Hime, Melancholy of Haruhi Suzuyama, and even High School Rumble.  There is a great balance of action, drama, and comedy.

The action is central to the series, but it's not all there is (which is great).  Often the action involves many other periphery events, such as people Ichigo is trying to protect, or particular Hollows that are more than just a faceless spirit.  Speaking of, I won't really get into the details, as this review would be far too long.  But let's just say this series is kind of a modern, high school series with action, intrigue, and evil spirits that only certain people can see and interact with.

The comedy is often over the top and sometimes a bit unfathomable (even knowing a good amount of Japanese culture, there were some rather interesting father/daughter interactions...).  The comedy between Rukia and Ichigo is rather amusing, as are her descriptive drawings.  Often there are brief comedic spurts inserted even into the more serious scenes which give the series a kind of light heartedness even when things are grim (think sword tied to top of head with handkerchief to use as spirit energy vessel during major battle).

But there is enough going on to entertain even an adult.  There are some things which irk me a bit (Orihime for one), and there are some cheesy lines on occasion, but it's overall a good series and one that I enjoy.  It's not the best, but it's surprisingly addictive and entertaining.  I highly recommend watching it, no matter what age you are.  If you're an anime fan that is!",1337731200,,2389,4.6052009456264775
2894035,5,B000T28G1E,"this review will be for the first three seasons of bleach and I did not buy off of amazon, however they are the same product. the first 60 some episodes are amazing and by far the best part of the series, also the first three box sets are great quality. all three are creative and more importantly shows little signs that fans will love (such as a hallow mask on the inside of the box, and other little easter eggs). basically you could tell they cared about the quality of the box sets, and spent time on them.

the reason I'm limiting it to the first three sets is because you could tell they stop caring after the third set. instead of 20+ episodes, they eventually dwindle it down to 13 episodes, and instead of releasing an entire arc or season in one box set, they divide it into two or three sets. the quality also goes down, now its in a regular DVD case with little or no creativity to it. also the number of filler episodes or filler arcs (non cannon episodes) make up more then half the episodes. I'm currently around episode 250 and over 100 of them are filler, honestly I'm starting to give up on the series, but the first 60 some episodes were so good I want to ride it out.

The first arc of Bleach, originally written by 'Tito' Kiba in his manga series, is known as Agent of the Shinigami or The Substitute. The viewer is introduced to our hero, Ichigo Kurasaki, a spiritually aware high school student who lives in a fictional area called Karakura Town. Our story begins with Ichigo coming in contact with a Soul Reaper from the Soul Society and gaining temporary Soul Reaper powers in order to fend off hollows; evil spirits that feed off of souls trapped in the living world, and keep order in his home town. A great adaptation, director Noriyuki Abe really captured the essence of the manga. The Substitute keeps you hooked from the second you pop in the first disc! Great buy!!

The relationship between the father and son is hilarious: sneak attacks in the morning and night, witty comments from son and daughters. I was laughing my butt off through the entire first season.

2894066,5,B000T28G1E,"I got started watching this Anime by my nephew. He mentioned it, and I sought out the episodes on Joost, Hulu and Youtube. I have to say that I was really impressed by the production. This is an anime the exemplifies what an Anime should be. After just a few episodes, I went out and bought Season One. Now I am a parent of a 9 year old child, so what I have to say is with that in mind. She doesn't really watch this with me, but she knows that it's ""Daddy's Cartoon."" She watches it with me from time to time but right now she's more interested in Shojo type anime. Bleach is violent, that is one of the things I should say up front. But unlike others, I don't fear my child seeing violence on a Cartoon. The makers of this Anime aren't trying to manage your children, they're trying to tell a story--a fact that animators in the US would do well to realize. That's one of this anime's strengths--it doesn't try to reshape the world. There are good guys and there are bad guys and right is right and wrong is wrong. That's the way a hero's story should be.

Ichigo is a complex character, as are all of the characters in this saga. Even with their complexities, it is easy to follow and I like that. Chad, Uryu, Rukia, Orihime and Kon all develop as characters during the course of this story. No one is cardboard or seems to be window dressing to the story. The way Ichigo interacts with each of them further establishes his image as the hero. I particularly enjoy the relationship between Ichigo and Rukia who come to mean a lot to each other as friends and perhaps even more...

While Ichigo gains strength as a Soul Reaper, he is not invincible. He makes a lot of mistakes and he suffers for them. In spite of this, he overcomes his setbacks and pushes forward. He doesn't think about the possibility that he might loose. He's protective of his friends and willing to sacrifice in order to protect the people who need protecting. This has rapidly become my favorite Anime and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime.",1258588800,,2030,4.353562005277045
2894067,4,B000T28G1E,"When I first viewed Bleach I was kinda skeptical, however; After viewing the first 7 episodes I was hooked. Its nonstop action, supernatural element, and humor really grew on me. Bleach is about a high school student named Ichigo with a sort of sixth sense, enabling him to see and speak to the deceased. While thats all fine and dandy, labeling him somewhat of a psychic, the real ordeal begins with his encounter with a shinigami named Rukia. The first 20 or so episodes are mainly character and plot development leading to what is deemed as the soul society story arc. Bleach without a doubt has some of the most interesting characters that you'll either love or hate. Its humor is top notch and fits within the right moments and moods. With that said, this series isn't without its downside, let me explain:

First: the recaps at the beginning of every episode is way too long. Giving you that feeling that a huge chunk of valuable minutes per episodes has been used on recaps alone, kinda makes you wonder if the creators really believe that its audience is in a constant state of amnesia.

Second: As the series progresses, mainly during the Hueco Mundo story arc, you'll notice that the flow of the story is abruptly disrupted to introduce its viewer to the series unrelated (story wise) fillers, this is quite annoying. While the fillers themselves are not bad (unlike Naruto), the way they are implemented into the series itself is the problem.

Third: This series seem to suffer from what I call the GI JOE syndrome (Talking about the 80's cartoon series), which means that as many slashing and critical blows dealt, none seem to die, with the exception of villians & non-essential characters of course. You could probably play this off as, ""Well it is an anime."" or ""They are shinigami's."" Yet at key moments, which I deem heart felt moments, the emotional impact loses its meaning or credibility.

Despite those flaws, it's still a great anime with some great characters. Unlike this series counterpart, Naruto, the fillers themselves are well done and well written. This series plot, its enemies, its heroes, its side characters, and its comedy are all well done and blend together to make it a wonderful viewing experience. Its not for everyone, but a good choice for any anime fan to add to their collection.",1258156800,2,2323,4.785536159600998
2894068,5,B000T28G1E,"I was looking around for a good anime and was asking friends what was good. They said either Full Metal Alchemist or Bleach. I researched both and came to a decision to look into Bleach due to the supernatural and samurai fantasy fiction I like, plus the plot and imagination is just astounding. Pretty much, my friends were right about Bleach.

Seeing Im able to do only one review, Im going to include the other 2 seasons of Bleach as well. Warning: I am just giving you a one sentence summary for each season, so read ahead at your own risk.

The first season is amazing and shows pretty much what the show is about. The second season shows Ichigo and his friends arriving in the spirit realm on the way to rescue Rukia from the Soul Society and fight the Soul Reaper captains along the way. And finally, season 3 draws down to who ordered the execution of Rukia, which will be a twist you will not believe; as well as the amazing fights that Ichigo will have as well some of the Soul Reaper Captains.

The way I see it, each episode I watched, the show was getting better each disc. Bleach is one of those animes that gets better each time you watch a new episode, to be honest; it is very rare to find a good show that gets you interested these days. I bought it on trust and instinct, and both of those turned out to be good. I highly recommend this anime for anyone just starting out or beginning to discover anime. Besides, all the Bleach dvds are original and uncut, do not waste time buying the separate little discs; get it all in the box sets on Amazon for cheap.",1257033600,,1575,4.296296296296297

I have watched all the episodes out so far In the English Dub (153 episodes with more episodes to come) and in the Japanese Sub (240 episodes with more to come) and its just AMAZING! Sinse Amazon already tells you what Bleach is about in the desription, I'm just gonna get right to the point and talk about the box set.

When I got my box set in the mail it came in great condition and their were no scratches on the discs either. The boxset cover has Ichigo Kurosaki and Rukia Kuchiki on the front and on the back it tells you what Bleach is about and what you will expect in the first season. Their are 5 discs with 4 episodes on each disc and it even comes with a douple sided Ichigo poster and on the back of the poster has Bleach character production art inside too. This boxset is made a little different then other anime boxsets, you have to open the Bleach boxset kinda like a book to look at the discs unlike some other anime boxsets that have you unfold it to see the discs and such. Personally, i like how the Bleach boxsets are made better then how other anime boxsets are made. ANYWAYS....If you don't like the English Audio and prefer the Japanese version with subtitles you can always go to ""Set Up"" on the Main Menu of whatever Bleach disc you are on and change the language, I like the Japanese version and the English version but when it comes to which one i like better i would have to say that i like the Japanese version better but i still very much like the English version too. The subtitles they use for the Japanese version for the boxset are kinda similar to how the English cast people talk BUT the subtitles are still different then it though! i just said that they are KINDA similar, The subtitles are very seeable and easy to read also.

There is also special features like ""Behind the scenes from Bleach"", Production Art, and the Bleach Ending with no credits in it. The boxset all together is approximetley 460 minutes. If you are a Bleach fan or anime fan PLEASE give Bleach a try!! i'm sure you would like it, especially if u like shonen anime!!!",1254787200,,2107,4.318181818181818

The second feature is ""Manga Preview,"" which is a preview of the first volume of the Bleach manga.  However, you have no control over the speed that the feature goes through the pages.  You also cannot rewind the feature, which is rather annoying if you can't read the text on the screen fast enough.  While this feature was an interesting idea, the execution could have been better.  The next feature is ""Clean Ending,"" which is a textless version of the first closing theme.  The final extra on the disc is ""Shonen Jump Home Video,"" which contains previews for Naruto, Hikaru no Go, and One Piece.

The second disc has twenty three pages of production art of the characters and items that appear in the episodes on the disc.  The ""Manga Preview"" is simply ads for Bleach and other Viz Media manga titles.  The Clean Ending and the Shonen Jump Home Video features are the same as on disc one.

There are twenty five pages of production art on disc three of the characters and items that appear in the episodes on the disc.  The manga preview is the same as what appears on the second disc, and the Clean Ending and the Shonen Jump Home Video features are also the same as on previous discs.

The fourth disc has the same manga preview and the same Shonen Jump Home Video features that appear on previous discs.  However, the production art is twenty four pages of characters and items that appear in the episodes on the disc.  The Clean Ending is the textless version of the second closing theme for Bleach.

On the fifth disc, the manga previews and the clean ending are the same as what appeared on previous discs in the set.  The production art on this disc is twenty three pages of characters and items.  Also included on this disc is ""Bonus: Behind the Scenes of Bleach.""  This is a roughly twenty minute long documentary that includes interviews with the English voice actors for Ichigo, Uryu, Orihime, and Tatsuki.  For a Viz Media release, this documentary bonus feature is probably one of the better extras I've seen on one of the company's releases.

Personally, I was rather disappointed by the repetition of the extras that appear on the discs.  Perhaps Viz Media should have considered only having extras on one or two discs, to help minimize the repetition.  Also, I question why a clean version of the opening wasn't included on any of the discs as a bonus feature.

Even though I was a bit disappointed in the bonus features, I would still recommend this box set to anyone who is a fan of the Bleach anime series.",1251158400,9,2867,4.583497053045186

2894074,5,B000T28G1E,"I am not a big shonen fan, but I have to admit that I have found some anime series in this genre that have left me really satisfied. The list includes&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hikaru-No-Go/dp/B000AM6OC6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hikaru No Go</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hajime-no-Ippo/dp/B000UVKFAY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hajime no Ippo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yu-Yu-Hakusho/dp/B000F6ZIFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yu Yu Hakusho</a>, but if you are looking for the best shonen anime for adults (and I am aware of the oxymoron) then i would have to say ""Bleach"" takes the price.

Even though the series has elements that portray why this is classified as a series for teenage boys, there are also many layers to the story that make it look as if it was targeted to a different demographic. The storyline is dark and captivating, and the topics of loss, friendship, sacrifice and fighting against insurmountable odds are explored vastly.

One of the aspects that really surprised me was how quickly I was hooked by this series. In my experience it takes me somewhere from 4 to 6 episodes to get to the point at which I feel I ""need"" to keep watching a series non-stop. Even some of my favorite anime like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Berserk/dp/B001GF8WSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Berserk</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Lagoon/dp/B001GT9DS4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Lagoon</a>&nbsp;required me to watch at least four episodes to be captivated. This was not the case with ""Bleach"", since when the first episode ended I felt I was not going to be able to stop for a while.

Finally, this series did not fall for the pitfall some other series in the genre fall for, and that is to keep a story arc going for way too many episodes. Some of the story lines are left open in some cases, but I think that overall, the plot is expertly crafted and provides closure while keeping the interest of the viewer at a high level. Highly, highly, highly recommended.",1248480000,,2232,6.3841059602649
2894075,5,B000T28G1E,"Bleach is an action packed anime that began in 2004 in Japan/2006 in the US.  At the time of this writing, the English language dubbed versions have been announced to extend to 172 episodes (or 9 seasons), while the Japanese version has 227 episodes (11 seasons) with no intention of stopping anytime soon.  For people who like lengthy anime this is definitely one of the ones to choose but because of the lack of reruns ever appearing on TV networks now is a good time to start.

I personally started watching Bleach after buying a copy of the monthly Shonen Jump that is released here and seeing nice action sequences in Bleach.  I tended to avoid any of the hype associated with shows because often times hype has lead me to be bored out of my mind.  On that note, Season 1 of Bleach (The Substitute) starts off on a confusing high, goes to a slight droll, and then regains its high at  the final 5 episodes of the season.

The first episodes open with Ichigo, the main protagonist, being able to see Souls.  He meets another girl who is able to see Souls, Rukia, who comes from the Soul Society, which is explained in later episodes to be this gateway world that maintains a balance between the destinations of the souls (yeah its kind of confusing, but the second season takes place in the ""Soul Society"" so we will hopefully get a clearer explanation then).  She transfers her powers to Ichigo, making him a Soul Reaper, empowering him with the powers to fight misguided souls, ie, evil souls known as hollows. The rest of the 20 episodes explore his role as a Soul Reaper as well as a student/friend.  Several episodes have interesting plots as well as interesting commentary on death and such.  The main background plotline in these episodes should be evident to most people.  The final episode is a cliffhanger, however, the ""episode previews"" at the end of the credits ruins the ""cliffhanger"".

The series is written as Original and Uncut, this means that the episodes have the original Japanese opening.  All of the 20 episodes in this volume use the original Japanese opening for Bleach, with the song, ""Asterisk"" by Orange Range (they seem to have done an ending theme in Naruto); the opening song will grow on most people after 20 episodes, even if it sounds weird at first. The two ending themes are also Japanese, the first is ""Life is Like a Boat"" by ""Rie Fu"" which has some English lyrics, and ""Thank You"" by ""Home Made Kazoku.""  The endings are more enjoyable.  At the end of each ending is an episode preview with hilarious commentary done by a revolving cast of characters.

The voice actors are all amazing and a few of them have voiced roles in other anime. For example the Johnny Yong Bosch who voices Ichigo sounds exactly like the voice of Lelouch Lamperouge/Zero in Code Geass (basically if you saw that anime, then his voice has not changed one bit). The Derek Stephen Prince who voices Uryu in Bleach sounds exactly like Ken from Digimo, and Shino from Naruto.  The voice of one of the Hollows in Bleach sounds exactly like Pakkun from Naruto.  So the English cast did well for this show.  OF course since this is an ORIGINAL and UNCUT boxset full Japanese vocals are included with English subtitles, so purists should be proud.

The show has solid animation that doesn't fall apart in high action sequences.  The solid colors works in making this look like a modern anime as well.  Blood is also appropriately shown in this ORIGINAL and UNCUT version.

Finally in terms of the product, a poster of Ichigo is included in which he is wielding his zanpakuto ""Zangetsu"".  Each of the 5 disc's has its own graphic on it.  The DVD boxset has an outbox that surrounds a case of the 5 discs.  It is reasonably sturdy and nice looking.

Bonus features of the discs includes previews of various Shonen Jump anime such as Naruto, as well as other VIZ media properties.  There is also an extensive section on the behind the scenes with the English language cast, and lastly ""clean"" (creditless) versions of the ending themes.

Ultimately this is a pretty solid boxset for the anime and is an appropriate start for the series.  It is suggested that anyone who likes previous Shonen Jump anime, or even just Shonen anime in particular pick up this boxset and start collecting them for Bleach.",1245110400,4,4308,4.636363636363637

2894084,5,B000T28G1E,"As a note, because I left a review for Bleach on the Amazon Unbox page, I decided to buy the DVDs because I like having them around, anyway, onto the review:

Bleach is a great Anime, It's full of action/adventure and humor. The story is about Ichigo Kurosaki, a 15-year-old high school student who can see spirits, when he meets Rukia Kouchki, he his thrust into a world of monsters called Hollows, and Soul Reapers who fight them and guide souls to the Soul Society, the afterlife in the Anime.

One of the reasons I enjoy the show is because of the excellent voice acting. Johnny Von Bach is a great voice actor who conveys real emotion with only the script and his voice. The other voice actor that I like is Derek Stephen Prince, who voiced Ken Ichijouji in the Digimon Anime. He's an excellent choice for voicing Uryu Ishida, rival of Ichigo in the series.

As a note for parents, this is not a ""kids anime"" like Digimon, this has blood, violence, one of the minor characters (not any of the main characters) is apparently a lesbian, but it's not Tatsuki Arisawa or O?righime Inue. if you dislike that lifestyle (I do), but it doesn't really bother me that much, it's very minimal, as another note it does have some cursing and language, about as much as maybe a ""LOST"" episode, but that's about it.

Unlike a lot of people, I like the English Dub, it's a lot easier to just watch the show than have to read all the dialogue using subtitles. The language difference in grammatical structure doesn't bother me, even though some people say that some of the depth of the show is lost because of the language differences and how things are worded, I like it just the way it is.

I will admit that when I was first exposed to Bleach, I was not a fan.  About a year or so after it first began airing I managed to sit down and watch an episode.  Since that episode, I haven't stopped.  The only regret I had was not watching Bleach from the beginning.

This is one of the first anime I have come across where both the characters and storyline develop with each episode.  It also has one of the largest collections of characters that I have seen to date.  (I am just getting into anime now, a little at a time; so there may be others out there that invalidate what I am saying but I haven't encountered them yet.)

Bleach centers around a 15 year old boy named Ichigo Kurosaki (known as Strawberry in the manga) who can see ghosts.  One night he has an encounter with a soul reaper - Rukia Kuchiki - and both of their lives are changed forever.  Ichigo is forced to become a substitute soul reaper and as a result not only has to prevent hollows from attacking humans but also his friends, who also become entangled in Ichigo's new found adventures.

Season 1 is an excellent opportunity to learn about the characters, their relationships, their powers and their lives as it culminates with an unbelievable season finale, which sets things up beautifully for Season 2, which will not only introduce a new plane of existence but also an even larger cast.  This is not your typical monster of the week anime like some of the others.",1216684800,2,1657,5.007299270072993

2894106,4,B000T28G1E,"I was pretty cynical about the whole Bleach thing. It is Shonen Jump, and Shonen Jump doesn't really have a good reputation among hardcore anime fans. However, I watched through the most recent episode via fansubs and realized I liked it enough to acquire the DVDs.

First of all, the current price ($28) is hard to beat. You get the first 20 episodes, which unfortunately aren't the best (things really pick up in the next few boxsets)... but do serve as an important introduction to the series. As far as the actual boxset goes, this one is really nice. Unlike the crappy Naruto Uncut boxes (I mean, I love Naruto and get those box sets, but you don't look at those and say, wowie, what a well-designed box!), the Bleach box has fantastic little touches that fans appreciate and enjoy. (Plus, it includes a poster... which is much more useful than those pointless books that come packaged with Naruto).

Bleach is highly overrated simply due to its popularity. But that doesn't mean it is a bad series. Sure, I wish shows like Elfin Lied or Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi got the same kind of attention, but I've never been one to throw out the baby with the bathwater.

(I will say I find Viz's use of ""soul reaper"" instead of the fansubber's use of ""shinigami"" quite obnoxious. But oh well, it is to be expected.)",1214265600,9,1321,4.6127659574468085
2894107,5,B000T28G1E,"To someone who is either a non-anime individual or a total anime freak, Bleach can certainly seem a little tedious at times. The plot does develop rather slowly, however it creates a powerful and rich universe where humans and spirits live and die together. It is visually satisfying and filled with humor to force even someone grumpy smile or even laugh. It is a continuous story, so season 1 probably leaves  you hanging ... so you will want to buy season 2. Isn't that how they all do it?",1213660800,2,491,4.51685393258427
2894108,5,B000T28G1E,"For the uninitiated, Bleach is one of the newest shows in a long line of Shonen (for males) anime. The normal Shonen anime plot usually revolves around a boy (most often teenage) that has special abilities, and that uses them to overcome some sort of challenge. In the tradition of Yu Yu Hakusho and Dragonball (also Dragonball Z) this means that the show normally turns into a lengthy coming-of-age action anime in which the protagonist (hero) and antagonists (villains) constantly one up each other in a seemingly never ending cycle of power shifts that are interwoven between something resembling a plot. You can look forward to good action, comedy, and decently thought out characters, but you've also got to expect that the story might only serve as a vehicle for the flashy action sequences. This is where Bleach sets itself apart from other shonen anime such as Naruto and Dragonball Z; The plot is thick with political intrigue (thick for a shonen anime anyway) and with dark twists and turns that easily set it on a mantle as the premiere shonen anime (in the action category) of it's day.

Someone above went over the synopsis of the story, so I'll leave that out. I will say that you can expect good characters, an interesting setting, great action, and passable (great at times) humor from the characters. This boxed set is referred to as season 1, and that seems to have upset one of the other reviewers, since it doesn't really feel like a ""season"" at all. This is because most shonen anime aren't separated into seasons in the American sense. Shonen anime (by design) run hundreds of episodes, with story arcs that can range anywhere from 60 to 100 episodes. Bleach's first story arc is 60ish episodes, so really you could call this boxed set ""Arc 1 part 1 of 3"" though I'm sure ""Season 1"" sounds a whole lot better.

In the box, you get 20 episodes on 5 discs, with extras such as production art (on the DVD's) and textless versions of the endings. Both Japanese and English audio are on the discs, with English subtitles. Inside the box is a book-style DVD case with 1 DVD per side (nice compared to the two discs on top of each other in boxed sets such as the DBZ season sets) and the original case art from the single DVD releases inset. Rounding it out is a poster of Rukia and Ichigo, as well as images of Kon and a hollow mask printed inside the outer box (a very nice touch indeed. I was surprised to see Kon looking up at me from the box). Overall, this is probably the highest quality (value) boxed set I've ever bought. When I say value, I mean a boxed set that is just the DVD's, and not a ""Limited Edition"" set (which usually come with full length posters, stickers, pencils, OST's etc). The addition of the poster in the box was more than I was expecting for a set as low priced as this, and truthfully, most boxed sets you buy don't even have little extras like that.

In conclusion, if you go into a shonen anime seeking something as deep and dark as an anime such as Monster or Elfen Lied, then you probably need to rethink the genre you are going into. I would argue however that by the time you've seen the end of the 60 episode first arc of Bleach, you would agree that the story in a shonen anime can absolutely transcend the genre, and become something that coexists with the action, instead of being something that exists only as a distraction between excellent fights (of which there are many in Bleach). Bleach destroys it's peers in the shonen genre (such as Naruto, and One Piece), and I'd say it's definitely worth the buy if you liked such shows as Yu Yu Hakusho or Dragonball Z.",1213056000,123,3623,4.503039513677812
2894109,2,B000T28G1E,"First of all, this isn't a complete story.  I've seen through episode 28 or so and I wouldn't be able to really tell you where ""Season 1"" ended.  As near as I can tell, the whole series is one continuous and ongoing storyline.  So don't be surprised if you get to the end of the last episode in season 1 and are wondering ""What the heck happens next?""

In general, Bleach could have been a decent, albeit rather cliche, chunk of anime if it weren't for the fact that it moves astonishingly slowly.  If you're a fan of the open-ended series that tend to have two episodes per fight (with ""fight"" being what characters do best) along the lines of Inu Yasha, Ruroni Kenshin, Dragonball Z or 12 Kingdoms, this may be an amusing and lighthearted romp for you.  I prefer the series that start wherever they start, bound about a bit and then deliver a plotline to a suitable conclusion some 13-26ish episodes later -- Lain, Slayers (by season), Trigun, Read or Die, Last Exile, Samurai Champloo -- and Bleach just didn't work for me.  As far as I'm concerned, when you can skip through every other episode and just watch the re-caps without missing anything of any significance, you know your time isn't being well-spent by the show.",1212969600,15,1226,4.545454545454546
2894110,2,B000T28G1E,"This anime is just a bunch of conventions of the genre put together.
The hero who shows a ""don't care attitude"", but in reality want to protect everyone. He got this hidden power that makes him kinda of invincible, meaning that you will never fear for his life since you know he will always win, no matter how strong is the enemy.
  Besides the pacing of the series is constantly interrupted but little side stories that adds nothing to the overall plot and are really boring.
  The action so far have nothing special to it, since the animation is just average, and all the main caracter can do is swing his sword with no technic (which is understandable since he just got his powers, but still..).
  But i have to admit that this anime have style. All the caracters have great designs, with a lot personality in it. Before looking out for Bleach I recomend you to see YU YU Hakusho, which have a similar concept but is infinitely superior.",1212537600,3,940,4.5
2894111,3,B000T28G1E,"A lot has been written about the anime and the manga. So I'll be brief: Bleach is great! It is one of my favorites.

Then why just the three stars?

I do believe that payed downloads are a great space and time saving alternative to DVDs, but I wouldn't go for these because they are dubbed.

A lot of depth goes lost in the english translation. For example, in Japanese language the choice of specific words reveal status and relationships. Just watching the english dubbed trailer, gave me the feeling that I am missing things. I would recommend watching the DVD's with the subtitles.",1212364800,,585,4.605769230769231

2894113,4,B000T28G1E,"Ichigo Kurosaki is just your average teenage boy... except that he can see spirits.

So it's not exactly surprising that he gets involved in wild, dangerous adventures, in the first season of the hilarious, action-packed ""Bleach."" It starts off a bit slow, but rapidly winds into a thrilling, expansive adventure story, with lots of big swords, roaring monsters, and TV psychics.

One night a strange girl appears in Ichigo's bedroom, and is shocked when he can see her. She explains that she's a Soul Reaper, who helps the dead pass on to the Soul Society, and destroys evil spirits called Hollows.

But when Rukia is injured in a fight with a Hollow, all her powers are transferred to Ichigo -- and with them, the responsibility of killing Hollows. Ichigo soon finds out that it isn't easy juggling his new responsibilities with his normal, everyday life -- especially since the powerless Rukia is now attending his school, and living in his closet.

Even more distressing, his new powers are attracting all sorts of trouble: the Hollow who murdered his mother, the now-monstrous brother of his ditzy friend Orihime, an outspoken ""mod-soul,"" and classmate Uryu-- the last of the Quincys, sworn enemies of Soul Reapers. Moreover, Orihime and the gentle giant Chad start developing spiritual powers of their own.

But then two powerful Soul Reapers show up to arrest Rukia. Ichigo is left mortally wounded and robbed of his powers, while Rukia is taken back to the Soul Society to be executed. To rescue Rukia, Ichigo agrees to undergo a terribly training regimen that could leave him worse than dead... and the journey into the Soul Society may be even worse...

Most long-running series run out their welcome pretty quickly, or start following a formula. But ""Bleach"" has that magical mix of complex plot, kinetic action, likable characters and kooky comedy. Not only does it click, but the results are sort of a mad hybrid of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" and ""Inuyasha."" Its biggest problem? The first season ends with a cliffhanger the size of the Grand Canyon.

To keep us entertained, there's lots of action, monsters, blood, giant magical swords, spirit arrows and even a skyscraper-sized Hollow. But the writers keep an eye on the characters, and the first arc is used to establish them -- we get to see their pasts, their motivations, and why they want to fight Hollows. Even if it's simply a desire to do what's right and protect others.

And just as important important -- comedy. Every episode of ""Bleach"" has some comedy, whether it's crazy friends and/or relatives, TV appearances, or the wacky dialogue (""OH NO! I'M FRIENDS WITH A NERD! Maybe you need some thick nerd glasses...""). Even Ichigo produces some hilarious moments, such as his bloodcurdling scream when he wakes in Urahara's house.

Ichigo himself is the pivot of the whole series -- like many a good anime hero, he is rough, brash, sensitive and fights for those he loves. And though he's incredibly powerful, he still has a lot of training, fighting and learning to do, though he tends to jump in without thinking about it.

And he's backed by a colourful squad of characters: the prickly Uryu, quiet Chad, ditzy love interest Orihime, and the mysterious ""Mr. Hat and Clogs"" who trains Ichigo to be a full-fledged Soul Reaper. Not to mention Kon, a living lion doll who provides plenty of comic relief, whether he's getting bounced around the room or dressed as Marie Antoinette.

""Bleach's"" first season introduces viewers to a brilliant series, full of hilarity, tears, blood and big, bad monsters. Definitely a must-see, for anyone who likes any of the above.",1210291200,,3628,4.911764705882353

A lot happens in a short amount of time - there's a lot of action, new characters are constantly appearing, and it seems like you're always learning something new about the world of Bleach. It's beautiful.

One of my favorite features is that you can either watch it dubbed in English, or in it's original Japanese with English subtitles. I prefer watching it in Japanese, but the English dubs are very well-done. (Unfortunately, a lot of foreign movies we get are very poorly dubbed and end up sounding cheesy.)
I had never previously watched Bleach before I borrowed season 1 on dvd, and now I'm hooked - I can't wait to get my hands on season 2!",1210118400,,748,4.54074074074074

2894120,5,B000T28G1E,"The first story arc of the anime, Bleach, is one of the most unforgetable and captivating stories I have ever seen in an anime. Ichigo, who along with  some members of his family, possesses the unique ability to see lingering spirits. This ability however gets him into trouble whenever an evil spirit called a hollow comes after him looking to devour his soul. He is saved by a Soul Reaper named Rukia, who is badly injured in the process. Soon enough the hollow comes back and the only way Ichigo can save his family from the hungry spirit is to become a soul reaper himself by sapping the powers out of the incapacitated Rukia. However in doing this he gets a lot more than he bargained for. Because Rukia gave him her powers of as a soul reaper she is unable to perform her duties(killing hollows, sending spirits to the other side, etc.) and Ichigo must do it in her stead. This series of events sends him on an unforgetable roller coaster ride of adventures that eventually brings him to the gates of the spirit world. If you are a fan of good anime, this is a season you absolutely have to own. Buy it, its worth the 70 dollars(psst don't buy it from amazon. u don't need to pay 200 dollars! your local best buy has it for 70!) Look forward to the release of the boxed second season. It is way better than this as hard as that is to believe, but trust me you will thoroughly enjoy this animme.
