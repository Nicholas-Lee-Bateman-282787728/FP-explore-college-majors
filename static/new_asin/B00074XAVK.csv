2nd part - 4 stars

3rd part - 5 stars

There is very special feature in Hollywood: if first part of the film is great, then sequel is worse and if there is 3rd part of film - then it's usually crap (for example, Matrix, Final Destination and think there're more examples).

This movie is absolutely opposite. First part seems ok, second is better (would even say much better), third part is wonderful. Jokes are less flat and more interesting.

All 3 parts definitely worth to watch and even have in home collection.

One of best French movies.",1169856000,,565,4.436893203883495
