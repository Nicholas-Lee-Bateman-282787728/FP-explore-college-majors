8271786,1,B00005LPZO,"I stopped watching after about 15 minutes.  This is junk, the people talking were terrible, the acting was lousy, and the story (from what you could tell in the first 15 minutes anyways) didn't seem that great either.  I'm glad I only paid $2 for it.",1312848000,,250,4.413043478260869
8271787,4,B00005LPZO,"you don't think you can go wrong, which may be true.  That all depends on your needs in a good Japanese film.  First of all, the movie is not that violent, but to me, and maybe many of you, it was still pretty good.  Te ending brough up a few complaints, becasue not much gets resolved, seriously, but it does set up for the sequel which is also good.  If you like Riki or are a fan of the genre, try it out, and don't build it up too much.",1013040000,4,440,3.8555555555555556
