8694822,3,B00RC7LEE0,"This DVD turned out to be in PAL. That's a European TV standard which can't be played on most American DVD players. It is not so marked anywhere. I tried it on my three (a blu ray, a HD, and a regular) and got error messages, one of which told me it was PAL.  However, I have found that Amazon offers DVD players that can read PAL and I bought one by Phillips. This DVD works on the PAL compatible DVD player.
This turned out to be a movie centered around Die Fledermaus rather than a video of an opera production. It is in German with no subtitles. My German is poor but I could make out some of it. The main protagonist seemed to be an opera singer with a part in Die Fledermaus whose lifestyle much resembled the characters in the opera but contemporary (ie., 1937 not 19th century). The first couple of scenes feature him singing live on the radio from home - it was interesting to see the equipment for that from the period, and quite a bit of singing by his household and friends. Then there is an extended dream sequence in which he lives the part of Eisenstein in a somewhat abridged version of the opera, which is done movie-style more than operatic production style. The period special effects are amusing.  The singing is fine, the sound quality is, well, 1937. If you are familiar with Die Fledermaus you know that the spoken parts, especially the comic part of the jailer, vary considerably from production to production. In this movie you can see that many of the classic jokes and routines date back at least as far as this. A curiosity that may intrigue some viewers is that, if they thought lady entertainers in revealing dresses was only a modern phenomena, they will learn otherwise. When Rosalinda appeared in her Hungarian disguise I couldn't help wonder where she would hide the watch. When the dream is over there is a final scene in which any family complexities are resolved much as in the opera. Overall, very interesting. Not the same as seeing a real opera production from the 30's but probably as close as one can get now.",1447286400,,2051,4.481283422459893
