2769609,2,B000NJL4SA,I have to admit that I was a little disappointed with this item. Most of the comedians that appear in the episodes are not well known and frankly weren't very funny. I can't wholeheartedly recommend this item.,1255132800,2,209,4.675675675675675
2769610,3,B000NJL4SA,"The 2 disks feature several stand-up comedians, some of whome are really funny and others, not.  George Carlin, for example, bombed.  He was a funny comic in his early years, but not here.  I can't imagine why this particular Tonight Show appearance was included.  Drew Carrey is another bomb, but then I never thought he was very funny.

My favorites in this selection are Rodney Dangerfield, Gallagher, Rita Rudner, and Brett Butler.  The rest are so-so.",1234656000,,456,4.934210526315789
2769611,3,B000NJL4SA,"It should be known that, at twenty-six years old, I was not around/not old enough to stay up late to watch any of these clips live. That being said, I love stand-up comedy of all eras and I know that a lot of greats had made their marks on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.

The DVD promises ""classic routines,"" but what it really should have said is ""first time on televsion for some comedians."" Jerry Seinfeld, Roseanne Barr, Brett Butler, Steven Wright, and Drew Carey are among those making their TV debuts. As a sort of historical document, this is kind of cool. But as far as bringing the funny goes, some of these routines are lacking -- most notably in Seinfeld's case. It's easy to see that he got way better through the years.

The rest of the set is fairly uneven; George Carlin is off his game here (though that just may be the restraints of broadcast TV), but Gallagher's routine was one of the most enjoyable even without his Sledge-o-Matic. It really varied from one comedian to the next. It was also apparent that the less-well-known comedians (Ronnie Shakes?) were less known for a reason.

This two-disc set isn't really as bad as I make it seem. There were some surprises from comedians that I wasn't really familiar with (as in I haven't heard their material) like Louie Anderson and Garry Shandling. Rodney Dangerfield was hilarious as usual. It's just that the shortcomings of the DVD are so obvious: first-time apperances that weren't very good, unknown and unfunny comics, etc.

I would recommend this DVD for fans of older comedy because there are some gems to be found here, but at the same time tell them not to expect a whole lot from the set otherwise.",1204934400,14,1684,4.6033333333333335

2769613,4,B000NJL4SA,"I loved it! Johnny Carson IS the King of Late Night and there's no two ways about it. It's great to be able to see him interact with many great comedians of that era.  I think it's a great buy, though I feel like it excluded a few stand-up acts that I enjoyed when the show was still on television. Nonetheless, it's a great DVD set for the Classic TV savvy.",1181260800,2,358,4.042253521126761
2769614,5,B000NJL4SA,"The Best of the Tonight Show: Stand-Up Comedians was a great purchase.  My wife and I bought the box set last week and have enjoyed it very much.  It's about 2 hours long and features a lot of great comics and memorable moments from the Tonight Show.  I own the Ultimate Collection already, but bought this set because it compiles the stand-up routines that I enjoyed so much. It's not ALL of Johnny Carson's greatest moments but it's his greatest moments on shows where he had stand-up comedians on.  If you enjoyed the stand-up, you'll appreciate this compilation.",1181260800,12,566,4.744897959183674
2769615,5,B000NJL4SA,"The box set features a lot of great comedians of my time, as well as some of today's greats before they made it big.  Jerry Seinfeld will always be my favorite, so it was nice to see him earlier on in his career alongside Johnny Carson, no less.

2769616,5,B000NJL4SA,"For three decades the dream of almost every comic was to perform for Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show.  Carson helped launch virtually every important standup until he retired - and there has been no venue to replace him.  This DVD set has all the greats we are still enjoying - Seinfeld, George Carlin, Steven Wright, Gary Shandling - and many of the greats that are gone, including Rodney Dangerfield. It is really interesting to see them with 70's suits and hair at the very beginning of their careers.  A great collection.",1180915200,14,527,4.706521739130435

8178297,4,B000NJL4SA,"On two discs features a collection of comedians, some their first time on 'The Tonight Show'. Roseanne Barr leads off talking about her size and food, Steve Wright appears and is invited over to the couch, Brett Butler appears as a brunette, Jerry Seinfeld from 1981, Louie Anderson (1984) talks about his size and the Olympics, and Garry Shandling.

Disk 2 opens with Drew Carey who talks about high school reunion, he gets invited to the couch, George Carlin talks about Thanksgiving, David Brenner talks about traffic, Gallagher appears without fruit, Rita Ruddner talks about guys and anti-commitment, Rich Hall, and Rodney Dangerfield who just goes and goes. Some unknowns also appear. Mostly from 1970's and 1980's. Insightful. Two mentions of fruit cake and two mentions of jaywalking.",1434153600,,792,5.1875

8178302,5,B000NJL4SA,"I refer you to the header....it says it all.  Carson gave so many comedians of our generation and up until today their start that it will surprise you who all's here.  It's worth the price for the memories and because comedy is also subjective you'll like some, you'll love others and a few won't be your cup of tea.  That's what a line up like this is all about.  I enjoyed myself immensely so I would heartily recommend it.",1395619200,2,425,4.341772151898734

8178304,3,B000NJL4SA,"As a working comedian, I thought this DVD would be a great study aid - watching the very first national appearance of some many iconic talents.  Unfortunately, the editing made that impossible.  Almost every comedian had his/her very first seconds cut out.  Instead this ""clip disc"" jumps deep inside the comedian's set.  The critical first seconds on stage gone. To add further insult to injury, the disc producer went so far as to cut out slower moments in the comedians' sets (they even cut precious minutes out of Wright's set - sacrilege!) A possible great learning tool, ruined by bad production.",1297123200,6,602,4.930693069306931
