8637191,3,B002QNZMVQ,"I have seen this novela around 5 times in it's orginal form and it is the BEST love story ever told.  I was very dissapointed with this version, I bought it because it was a 5 disc 2 sided set and I thought that it would have less chop and editing work and be a fuller version as it was directly from TV Azteca, the Mexican station that was responsible for the original version.  The editing job is absolutely horendous as it leaves out LUCRATIVE key parts between the two main characters, Diego and Paloma, and leaves a story that is hard to follow in some places!  I thought that I would see the beautiful romance unfold all over again with this set, and it was not so.  I guess that owning it is better than nothing at all.  I recommend that anyone buying this see the whole story first. . you can find it on the internet and youtube. . . this set is much easier to follow if you have seen the whole novela first.  They have taken 230+ episodes and condensed them down to these 5 discs and hurt the end product in doing so.  I would much better have the whole 230+ episodes available in the entire form and paid more.",1264550400,5,1120,4.181395348837209
