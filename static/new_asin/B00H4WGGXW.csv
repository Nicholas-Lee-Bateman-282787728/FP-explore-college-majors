6132293,5,B00H4WGGXW,A really excellent series. It's a shame it didn't last longer. Patrick Warburton should have worn a mask. Funny Stuff!,1405728000,6,118,4.95
6132294,5,B00H4WGGXW,"I was a big fan of the cartoon growing up, so I was a little skeptical when I purchased this series because it had been cancelled so quickly. How wrong I was--this series did not disappoint! After a quick setup in the pilot, the show hit its stride in episode two and never let off for the whole season. Great acting and character chemistry, funny situations, and no shortage of witty repartee. Patrick Warburton captured The Tick's persona perfectly, complete with pithy soliloquies. I laughed so hard I was worried that might bother the neighbors. Add this title to the ever-growing list of great series killed by Fox well before their time.",1399248000,9,643,4.75
6132295,1,B00H4WGGXW,"This show is great, but the product description for the DVD set I bought specifically says ""Aspect Ratio: 1.77:1"". It's not true. The DVDs I received are in 1.33:1 (fullscreen not widescreen) format. Will still enjoy the show, but disappointed in the misinformation.

Edit: I just noticed the back of the DVD case also says ""Aspect Ratio: 1.77:1"" even though that's not true. Avoid this set if you want a widescreen version.",1398902400,10,424,4.888888888888889
6132296,3,B00H4WGGXW,"This show was way ahead of it's time, and way too short lived! A live-action adaptation of the comic book, it was filled with sarcasm, satire, and good old-fashioned Super Hero hi-jinx! The series itself gets 5 enthusiastic stars, I can't recommend it highly enough! HOWEVER. For some unknown reason, Mill Creek chose to take the original widescreen format and chop it down to full frame. I disagree with doing that, but it's not the worst thing in the world. The problem is, that Mill Creek then blatantly lies on the packaging, which clearly states that the episodes are still in their original widescreen format. Instead, what they did was take the full-frame copies of the episodes and stretch them to a widescreen dimensions and hope no one noticed! Last time I checked, that was called bait-and-switch. Buyer beware, you aren't getting what you pay for with this!",1398556800,25,869,4.878378378378378
6132297,5,B00H4WGGXW,This was a short but funny series. I had a copy of some of the episodes that a friend made shortly after the series ended. I was glad to see that they finally got a DVD of all the episodes. If you like him in Rules of Engagement you'll like The Tick.,1394582400,4,250,3.826923076923077
6132298,5,B00H4WGGXW,"When I heard back in 2001 that THE TICK was going to become a live action series on TV I was thrilled. The comic, that would be considered underground by some, was hilarious as had been the animated series back in 1994. My expectations were high and fortunately they were well placed. The show was hilarious and I loved it. Apparently I was in a minority though because it sadly lasted only one season. Luckily the entire series has been available on DVD, first for a steep price that eventually dropped and now for just $9.82 (amazon.com price).

If you aren't aware of the series or haven't heard of the Tick then you're truly missing out on one funny show. With super heroes all the rage these days, the series was obviously well ahead of it's time. But the superheroes on display here are not the average ordinary types that we have today. Sure, they may be found in colorful tights, but they are not the successful bunch found in most movies now.

No one knows where the Tick came from. As played by Patrick Wharburton he is central to the success of the show in a role that I can't imagine anyone else playing now. Dressed in what appears to be a latex blue one piece outfit with wiggling antennae (one of the funniest visual things in the show), the Tick leaves a bus station he's been guarding to head to the big city. His goal is to put a stop to crime. The Tick has several things going wrong for him though. The first is that he has no clue of his own strength and with that the ability to be aware of the things that he does around him. Like knock out portions of roofs as he leaps from one to the next. He also has a tendency to try and make everything he says sound profound. His tone may make it so but not his choice of words. My favorite takes place in the opening of the pilot where the Tick is ""fighting"" a coin operated coffee machine that refuses to give a patron the cup of coffee he purchased. Grabbing the machine he lifts and shakes it yelling ""So vending menace we meet again...Armless bandit! Empty your bladder of that bitter, black urine men call coffee!""

Once the Tick arrives in the city he meets a hero wannabe, accountant Arthur, just released from his job because he wants to be a hero...and dresses in a white spandex suit with wings. Until he meets the Tick no one recognizes that the outfit is that of a moth. The pair then meets two other heroes, Bat-Manuel and Captain Liberty. Discovering a plot to kill Jimmy Carter by a dormant Soviet robot that's been awakened, the heroes must work together to thwart this menace. See? His way of speaking can be infective.

Other episodes in the series took all kinds of turns. And rather than be kid friendly like the animated series, this one often had sexual innuendo on display throughout, especially when Bat-Manuel tried to bed Captain Liberty. Or the episode where she went to bed with The Immortal only to have him die there.

For the most part though this series didn't dwell on those topics. They were background noise to the real focus which was just how dedicated the Tick was to justice while at the same time causing as much damage as the bad guys did in an attempt to apprehend them. And yet at the same time you had to love this big galoot who just wanted to do good.

I can't say enough how the best part of this series was Patrick Wharburton. This is not to short change the rest of the cast, but he stood out so much here. To this day when I hear his voice in anything he does, this is what pops into my head. He's a great voice actor and a wonderful live actor and deserves not only more work but more credit as well.

The series may not have lasted that long. Looking back the Fox network didn't promote it all that well and placed it up against SURVIVOR and NBC's must see shows on Thursday nights. Fortunately it can still be enjoyed on DVD and watched again and again. For me it's not a DVD that I'd part with. I can still watch the episodes and enjoy them as much today as the first time. If you love super heroes or comic books or just want to enjoy something funny and different, then pick this up. You won't regret it.",1394150400,9,4125,4.30798969072165

6132302,1,B00H4WGGXW,"This was so bad I can see why it only lasted 9 episodes. The ""grand finale"" was them remembering how 1 year earlier they had defeated ""The Terror"", who was a barely functional old man. I threw the disk out afterwards, didn't want to give it to anybody.

Sheldon and the guys are in a dream sequence and meet The Tick and the crew since the guys love comic books and dress as superheroes for costume parties.

6132318,3,B00H4WGGXW,"If you're a fan of the series, DO NOT buy this set. The transfer is horrible and on top of that the aspect ratio is only 4:3 (the show was shot in 16:9 widescreen).

Get the 2-disc set release if you can find it. Not only is the picture uncropped, so you get to view the show as it was filmed, the transfer is better; less blurry, less pixelated due to more information on each disc, this will help with the upscaler in your TV/player/computer to get the best picture possible. It costs more, but personally I rather pay more for a superior copy than waste my money on an inferior one like this release.",1496534400,15,603,4.243478260869566

6132342,5,B00H4WGGXW,"I recently watched the Amazon original pilot for The Tick, which starts good, but it going to have to work hard to match the live action 2001 series. Patrick Warburton played it well. The supporting cast played it well. They seemed to understand that level of satire and spoof that this property demands.

The comic book was great but only found small audiences. The Tick should have helped follow up on the 1994 cartoons momentum. It does. Sadly, it was ahead of its time. In 2001 comics were an important part of the pop culture but society does not seem ready to mock it yet. In 2016, after the Marvel and DC invasion of the last decade, it is time to stop being so serious. The Tick is the hero that can save us from being serious.",1473897600,,735,4.364963503649635

The funny thing is, most of the time, these so called heroes dressed up in costumes, do very little rescuing or crime fighting and more time looking to score a girlfriend or have a meal at the local diner. Seriously funny show that spans 9 entertaining episodes. Bring The Tick back I say.",1461196800,5,580,4.696078431372549

We've been over this!"") or understand the concept of his own birthday.  Arthur, Batmanuel, Captain Liberty, the Champion, the Immortal, even the villains are wonderful parodies.

6132357,2,B00H4WGGXW,"Not only is the transfer of this pained live action translation of The Tick comedic comic book grainy, oft fuzzy, and lackluster but this describes the limited television series and its pathetic humor as a whole (I don't even know if I can use the term humor honestly here because this caped comedy is not funny).  SO much more should be expected from series producer Barry Men In Black Sonnenfeld and The Tick creator Ben Edlund.  Its hard to fault the stars of the show when they are given such bad scripts.  Patrick Warburton (Putty from Seinfeld and star of Rules of Engagement) gives it the old college try as the titular Tick.  His suit is one of the extremely few things this televised series gets right and while Warburton can play the big, dumb oaf and mug with the best of them the writers and directors have managed to denude him of his doofus charm somehow.  Arthur is played by David Burke, who gets the look right, and probably comes across as the truest of Edlunds creations.  Hes the straight-man-in-tights, the sidekick who constantly wonders why hes jumped into the rabbit suit (Its a moth!), and who reluctantly provides shelter and whatever else to do for the Tick.  Unfortunately, because theres no gravity to these live action episodes, this put-upon partner of the Tick never generates real pathos or sympathy.  Another thing the series did get right is the suit for Batmanuel (Die Fledermaus in the animated series) and actor Nestor Carbonell filling it.  This Batman knock-off has got the look and they played him as the coward that he is.  They also made him an overt womanizer which automatically dropped the humor of this series into the toilet of a college dorm.  And frustratingly instead of giving us a great Edlund creation in American Maid (think a Wonder Woman attitude crossed with an Uncle Sam gung ho marine) we here get Captain Liberty, a highly sexualized proto-feminist character who adds to the college dorm toilet humor.  The thing that makes me want to pull my hair out (and I cant afford to do that) is that there was so much potential here if they only stayed true to the source material!  Out of the 9 (?) eps  I think that I laughed once and my wife laughed twice.  We groaned and grimaced a whole lot, and our attitude toward watching them was lets just get this over with.  Other than a vain hope I don't know what kept us going.  Oh, yeah.  Edlunds great and funny original comics.

And the animated series didn't look all that great but still got it right.  Watch that, not this garbage.",1457827200,,2538,4.610244988864142

It took years to get over because I couldn't find it anywhere, then one day I remembered ""hey Amazon sells almost everything"" and look where we are now!

For some unknown reasoning the early 2000's The Tick was only a single season which comprised of 9 episodes:
1. Pilot
2. The Funeral
3. Couples
4. The License
5. Arthur Needs Space
6. The Big Leagues
7. The Tick vs. Justice
8. Arthur, Interrupted
9. The Terror (unaired)

If you have seen this show (or its animated counterpart from a few years prior, its a must have for your collection) the episodes are still hilarious all these years later, and if you never seen well lets just say you have truly lived until you have seen Patrick Warburton dressed as a giant blue tick with the battle cry of ""SPOON!""
