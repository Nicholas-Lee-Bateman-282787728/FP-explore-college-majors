8259172,2,B0015N3BSO,"Don't buy it.  It is very unprofessional and,also, very boring.  We couldn't finish watching it.  I feel bad that I sold my copy to someone!  I just found a documentary on here called, ""The Source.""  I want to buy it, but fear it is the same movie as this.  ""The Source,"" sounds good.  The subject certainly is interesting but this lame documentary sucked.",1377129600,,356,4.555555555555555
8259173,1,B0015N3BSO,"Lamest of the lame! Like some kind of D- school project. Shows no footage of the father or his band, just a bunch of jibber jabber from 1960's burnouts. Waste of money and time.",1369440000,,177,4.235294117647059
8259174,2,B0015N3BSO,"Graphics are distracting, unnecessary and cheapen the people interviewed and the context of their statements.  Weird, odd framing of interview subjects is not psychedelic, it gave me ADHD.  The director thinks a lot of himself, so you have his ego need to be in many scenes in stark contrast of the people he is interviewing.  I'm not kidding here, there are times the director has placed his profile on the right bottom of the screen which cheapens the work.  Sometimes we get to look at the back of his head while he holds a microphone and does nothing.  I swear there is a moment here and there where you can pick up some members of the source family making slight facial expressions as if they don't respect the person interviewing them.  It's the same thing you see when a daughter brings home a complete douche and the family HAS to be nice about it.",1359763200,2,856,4.525974025974026
