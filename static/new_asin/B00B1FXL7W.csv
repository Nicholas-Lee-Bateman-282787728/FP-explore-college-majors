8560784,2,B00B1FXL7W,"Bill Zebub can neither act nor direct.  But his ideas for plot and dialog are, to my tastes, hilarious.  If he ever learns to direct, and ever finds anyone who can act, he will be an unstoppable movie making force!

This movie is basically just a long diatribe against Christianity.  It's funny, if you like that of thing.  If you don't like that kind of stuff then stay far away!  The real problem here is how bad the movie is.  No amount of funny lines, or naked breasts, can save it.  And I was expecting more nudity!  A handful of breasts, and not much else.  Disappointing.",1450915200,,578,4.367924528301887
8560785,1,B00B1FXL7W,Bill Zebub Should Be Banned From Filmaking. His Films Are Pure Garbage. And Playing To The Guise Of Being A Independent Filmaker Is Such A Joke. Ive Seen 4 Of His Films. This One Is The Best One. And Thats Not Saying Much. Save Your Money. Supporting This Kind Of Trash Is A Waste.,1440201600,,281,4.222222222222222
8560786,5,B00B1FXL7W,"Hilarious premise, attractive women, clever, and great slow motion fight scenes with girls in G-strings.  I saw it at a horror convention before it came out on DVD.  It was on my radar for quite a while, and I am happy to finally own it.  Plus, the bloopers are hilarious.",1368921600,12,272,4.4
8560787,4,B00B1FXL7W,"this isn't so much an acquired taste, as it is a taste that should be force fed to the masses.  (much like Christianity is upon the children of the world)  I feel acorns. Continuing in the theme of 'Jesus, the Total Douchebag' and 'Quantum Leap', you find out what would happen if a bleach strawberry stripper possessed the body of Christ.  Sully forth!!",1366848000,10,354,4.587301587301587
8560788,1,B00B1FXL7W,This is wrong on so many levels.  A movie with this plot should never have been put on film.  It is absolute bigotry.  It's too bad I can't give it zero stars.,1366675200,7,159,3.90625
