Also, I used this video as a reference to a project I did in a health class in high school. But I was really into the 7 upbeat songs on this video (Krossed Out Version of the Nursery Rhyme, Mockingbird, Kids Dance Number, This Old Man, Mary Had a Little Lamb, Loop-Dee-Loo and Nursery Rhyme Medley). This video is full excitement, comedy and music you'll be dancing to all night long.",1520985600,,510,4.268041237113402

7829134,5,6302676746,I purchased this VHS because I am a Sheila E fan and i needed it to complete a collection but I rather enjoyed it and it was great to see ole school heads like Shanice Wilson and Kriss Kross. It was really great that all of those celebrities got together for such a good cause and kids will surely enjoy the music.,1062633600,,314,4.080645161290323
7829135,5,6302676746,"This video is a must for parents and children to see. I was purchasing it for my five year old neice and decided to buy one for myself. The creative  renditions of the nursery rhymes were superb.  The songs were so delightful  and lighthearted.  It's also educational for anyone who wants to know about  AIDS. I commend everyone who played a part in this video.  It's the best,  simply the best!!!",941241600,3,397,4.507042253521127
