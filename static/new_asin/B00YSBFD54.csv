7242965,5,B00YSBFD54,This is a terrific series we enjoy having it in our DVD collection.  I hope someone buys it and enjoys it as much as we do.,1458691200,2,123,3.730769230769231
7242966,5,B00YSBFD54,"As a Holmes fan I'm always skeptical about a new format.  Jeremy Brett will always be the definitive Holmes.  I did have to grow into this series, but by the end I was totally hooked.  Great dialogue, chemistry, and storylines.  A  British feel in a New York setting.  It's a cross between Sherlock Holmes and Nero Wolfe.  Great depth to the storylines.  Thought provoking in the areas of interpersonal relationships, friendship, and even addiction.  Holmes perspicacity remains a constant yet unlike other series he develops as a character.  The only negative is the formulaic and superfluous sexual ingredients.  Highly recommended for true Holmes fans.",1457568000,6,655,5.201923076923077

7242983,5,B00YSBFD54,"I was extremely skeptical at first. Watson as a girl? C'mon, that's not how the story goes... But after three episodes I was hooked!!! I loved the modernized twists, I love that it's not full of swearing and sex, I love the new Sherlock and feel his addiction struggles. I can relate to him as my husband is super smart and views/relates/exists on a different plane of existence like this Sherlock. Strongly suggest this show to people looking for something different and not full of all the garbage most shows have now.... Awesome!!!!",1489017600,,535,4.763440860215054

7242990,4,B00YSBFD54,This is a good show. I had trouble hearing it on the original tv so I stopped watching it. I decided to try the dvd's and the sound is much better. Enjoying the shows.,1473379200,,167,3.9411764705882355

7242993,5,B00YSBFD54,Very good,1472774400,,9,4.0
7242994,5,B00YSBFD54,"I bought this set to get season 3 at a reasonable rate. The other 2 are in my collection already.
I don't get all the complaints about the new companion she is young but does an excellent job. I like this show and collect them when they meet a decent price.
It is not Sherlock and I appreciate the differences in both shows. This season was good and the episodes are enjoyable. Jonny Lee Miller is a solid Sherlock and carries the show. Lucy Lui as Watson does as what she can with a sometimes confusing character written erratically. I still enjoyed the season and am glad a forth season is supposed to be on the way.",1472601600,2,618,4.2905982905982905

7242996,1,B00YSBFD54,"Something is wrong with Season 3. None of the DVDs play!

Season 1 & 2 are great.",1472601600,,81,3.764705882352941
7242997,4,B00YSBFD54,Excellent value for a series I missed the first time around.  The characters and the crime solving are both worth the watch.,1472515200,,124,4.636363636363637
7242998,5,B00YSBFD54,"Bought this thinking it would be something I could half watch to kill time on vacation, but it beat all expectations and became a new favorite show. The gender twist doesn't affect the classic Sherlock-Watson relationship. One of my favorite aspects of this show is the real world problems such as drug addiction in stark reality, sensitivity to mental disorders and the strain they can have on families, dating while trying to be 100% devoted to ones career. Each episode deals with either a relatable emotional issue or a real world debate. Highly recommend this show to anyone who loves Sherlock Holmes or a good murder mystery.",1472428800,,631,4.906542056074766
7242999,3,B00YSBFD54,"Poor quality control.  A few of the disks had scratches, some had strange ""color"" splotches...only way to explain it.  One case was chipped off on edges.  Checked each disk to make sure it at least played, and appeared to be okay.  Haven't heard back from the person for whom I purchased it so am assuming they played through all the way okay.  So, not worth returning...  Either I got a bad batch, or whoever made these up needs to check its equipment...reason for 3 starts instead of 5.",1472256000,,488,4.488636363636363

7243013,5,B00YSBFD54,One of my favorite shows ever. It's so clever and the relationship between Sherlock and Joan is cute and touching. There are so many subtle conversations that mean so much. Watching it again helped me pick up on even more.,1470009600,,222,4.575
7243014,5,B00YSBFD54,Elementary set such a great price and good condition.,1469923200,,53,5.0
7243015,5,B00YSBFD54,"This is such a high-quality show. In watching from season 1 through season 3, the evolution of the two characters and their relationship is really human and touching. The show is funny and smart and dramatic, and I look forward to it every week. I had to have the dvds to watch all over again. Love it.",1469836800,,302,4.315789473684211
7243016,5,B00YSBFD54,The Elementary Three Season Pack was as expected.  I viewed all 18 DVD disc on my PC computer without any problems.  The special price made this purchase extra nice.  It filled in all the gaps of the episodes missed.,1469404800,,216,4.487179487179487
7243017,5,B00YSBFD54,"This is an entirely different Holmes and Watson, and that takes some getting used to. However, the personalities are very much in tune with Doyle's original vision, especially the energetic, enigmatic Holmes, who sees his talents as more of a burden instead of a gift, and once you accept the show's premise of a modern day Holmes in New York City who is a recovering heroin addict, it is quite an ""addictive"" series.
It is well produced and dramatically paced and each episode is not necessarily neatly tied up at the end.
There are some stumbles along the way. The whole issue of Watson feeling under Holmes' thumb, moving out, getting engaged and then getting replaced by Holmes is overdone and distracting. The incident with detective Bell (shot while trying to protect Holmes) is handled much better, but finally, by the end of season three, Holmes and Watson are back together, though not without some uneasiness.
Altogether, a fascinating take on the Sherlock tales.",1468800000,,973,4.939024390243903

7243019,5,B00YSBFD54,"excellent.  we gave up watching this on tv because we cannot understand a lot of what is said because of the accent, the speed, and the sound of the voice seems like it has way too much base.  now we can go back and start at the beginning, use the closed captions, and see every word.  also, i hate those ""continued next week"" shows, and with this set, we can go on to the next one right away.",1468368000,3,393,4.012820512820513
7243030,4,B00YSBFD54,Good deal  on the package of 3 seasons.  I liked the extras included in some of the dvds. Enjoyed catching up on Elementary having come into the show late.,1467504000,,155,4.310344827586207
7243031,4,B00YSBFD54,The only thing wrong with this is that Disc #2 in Year Three didn't work at all.,1467417600,,80,3.764705882352941

There was an issue with one disc not staying in place, but that's fairly common with the discs I get from Amazon and iI preferred to just get another jewel case to hold that one disc.",1464652800,2,245,4.104166666666667

Otherwise, great show, fast shipping from Amazon. CBS did not issue a Blu-Ray for some reason. If you're a big fan, maybe wait for the Blu-Ray? It's a minor issue, but sad for 2017.",1495584000,,277,4.653061224489796
