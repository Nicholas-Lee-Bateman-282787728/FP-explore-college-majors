7059557,2,B00UMSA2E4,"I can't recommend this language program.  It's a good concept but poorly structured.  It's all done in a haphazard manner.  In addition, it's an old TV show that didn't transfer to DVD too well.  The image quality was poor and the aspect ratio didn't work on my wide ratio flat screen TV. (adjusting the aspect ratio on my set did not fix the problem)  I found the Michel Thomas audio program to be a better way of learning french.  I want to add that this Amazon seller was responsive to my dissatisfaction with this item and issued a refund.",1313971200,10,543,4.434343434343434
7059558,5,B00UMSA2E4,"Title describes it!  This purchase solved my wanting a copy of my own.  Never could catch it on tv in an organized fashion.  Excellent review, if you studied French long ago.  Buying the hardcover text fills in the gaps of knowledge.",1308441600,,233,4.609756097560975
7059559,5,B00UMSA2E4,"Bonjour!

I used to love watching Destinos, by the same Annenberg source, but for Spanish.  I was excited to learn about ""French in Action"", the same type of course offered by Annenberg.  You can go to their site and order either DVDs or downloads, but they are EXPENSIVE.  This product on Amazon is such a steal!

Some people are giving the material bad reviews, but they should delete those reviews and instead, review the specific shipper they ordered from in the shipper review link.  I received mine very shortly.  And yes, this is the full 12 disc, 52 shows set.

I've just got started, but already I love it.  I now have the hardcover full 52 episode textbook, the Study Guide Part 1, and CD Workbook Part 1.  Tonight I ordered the Audio CDs.  I have to go to Paris for career reasons, and this is the best immersion program I've found. [Noting that Rosetta doesn't provide enough information about their products to make me want to buy them.  Pimsleur, ditto.]

I suggest you buy these DVDs here.  Other parts of the program may be cheaper new at the source, but may be cheaper at Amazon for used material.  I'm sure that situation is dynamic.

Salut!",1305676800,15,1159,4.553398058252427
7059560,5,B00UMSA2E4,"This is a great program of 52 French lessons on DVD which uses the immersion technique. I have the complete package: textbook, workbook, audio tapes and study guide, but I find the DVDs to be the most important part. A great way to learn French!",1298937600,4,245,4.466666666666667
7059561,5,B00UMSA2E4,"French In Action takes the immersion approach to studying French.  This course takes you to the streets of Paris to watch a soap opera style story as you follow the adventures of a young French woman named Mireille and a young American man named Robert.  These segments of the story are used in conjunction with a classroom with an instructor teaching a class.  There are 52 episodes that run around under 30 minutes each, and of the episodes, only the first episode is entirely in English; the other episodes are entirely in French except for a summary in English at the beginning.  To illustrate some points, you will see a woman in a hurry, and then be told that she is in a hurry, then you will see someone who is not in a hurry and be told that person is not in a hurry; this is done entirely in French.

I first came across French In Action during my first year studying French in ninth grade when it aired on the local PBS station, which routinely aired the program.  I only got the one episode and subsequently made no use of the program for my studies (which I should have).  I think French In Action is well produced and quite useful for people wanting to improve their French.  The DVDs are great, and I like being able to watch them on a full screen television rather than watching them in a little window on my computer.  This edition is on 12 discs and it is all 52 episodes, not just the first 26 episodes or the second 26 episodes.  Again this edition includes ALL 52 EPISODES!

There are other materials available for this program: an audio component (which I've never listened to), workbooks, study guides, and textbooks.  There is also an instructor's guide for this program as well.  The texts (and I include the workbooks, study guides are textbooks) are for the most part either cover the first 26 episodes or the second 26 episodes.  At least two editions of the textbooks can be found that cover all 52 episodes.

I highly, highly recommend this program to any student of the French language.  It is an excellent tool to help you improve or maintain your listening skills, and a way to improve your vocabulary.",1294531200,44,2134,4.503896103896104
7059562,5,B00UMSA2E4,"There were 52 episodes on TV.  They're divided between two DVD collections.  As far as I can tell, only the first is available on Amazon.  For the other you have to go directly to the Annenberg website itself.",1285804800,4,209,4.447368421052632

7059610,5,B00UMSA2E4,"I took many French courses in college, but that was over 30 years ago.  For the last couple of decades, the only way I was able to keep myself from losing the language was to read French books. But when I watched movies, or worse yet, traveled to Paris, I couldn't follow the spoken words. I was too far along to take any beginner's course, and couldn't find anything that made sense at my level of education. That's why I was so thrilled to discover this series.  You are totally reliant on the spoken word, and because Pierre enunciates everything slowly and clearly, I can pretty much follow most of what he says (if not the characters - yet). By disc 4, I'm finding the dialog challenging. In the first half of each episode, the characters speak at their normal pace and I often get lost. In the second half of the episode, Pierre reviews the story in slightly different words, emphasizing the grammar and tenses, while leaving the less important sentences for me to figure out for myself. I'm hoping to get better at listening as we go along (I think this is the idea). I wouldn't want to try this series as a rank beginner, but I think it's marvelous for someone who has a good foundation in the language and needs to take it to the next level.",1382227200,,1250,4.406926406926407

7059612,5,B00UMSA2E4,This is a great series incorporating a story line with two young individuals and their friends speaking only French. The professor behind the scenes uses many audio-visual techniques to explain what is being said...with grammar details and written words to help with the understanding of the lesson that is playing. Everything is in French and with spoken dialect as would  said in conversation so it takes at least several reviews of the lesson to start to comprehend what is happening. It's French immersion and would probably be aided by the books that go along with the lessons.,1375228800,,582,5.0
7059623,5,B00UMSA2E4,"I had recorded these tapes from PBS broadcasts in the 1980's. They had become very, very pale. I was thrilled that they had been made into DVD form.

It is great to have the series at home as I continue my studies. Admittedly, production values leave something to be desired, as the series was produced in 1987, long before DVDs, let alone HD. Nonetheless, serious students of French will enjoy and learn much from this series.

Loved the story told by the instructor to help his students learn the language.  I was surprised there had been controversy about this series.

I have used Rosetta Stone as well, which is very good, but this series just simply speaks to you in French the whole time, in a way that is similar to you sitting in a room of full of French people and trying to figure out what they are saying.  It forces you to really have to listen and associate what is being said in context.  It is brilliantly put together, with lessons laid out simply enough so you under the gist of what they are likely saying, but then you have to just listen hard and learn.
