7788315,3,0739062654,"I was so excited to find that Sue Foley had released an instructional DVD. Her performance DVD&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-in-Europe/dp/B000GEIOEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live in Europe</a>is terrific and features a bonus concert and interview...that I was really excited to learn some of her tunes and hopefully some of her hot instrumentals. Well...Sue, known for her flashy fingerpicking on her Tele...teaches 4 of the 6 songs on acoustic and one of them flamenco! Okay...basic folk blues picking styles like she demonstrates on the first 3 songs are available by the hundreds and these lessons are simply nothing even remotely new or unique. Her flamenco tune as well is superfluous and done better by dozens of flamenco artists including Juan Martin in a wonderful series.  What we are left with is two servicable electric tunes...that sort of represent her real style of playing and performing.

bottom Line...If you , like me, were expecting Sue Foley to teach the songs she actually plays and records....forget it...if you want basic fingerpicking on acoustic guitar you will be happy. I consider this a huge opportunity lost by the company that put this together. Sue Foley is a prize and a heckuva artist and a great and unique picker who deserved a whole DVD playing her strength and the stuff that makes her unique...not the basics of guitar....its a shame that the most interesting little tune she plays is during the closing credits and its not taught or transcribed!!!

In trying to be all things to all people the great artist that is Sue Foley has been diluted too much for me and I'm really sad that there isn't more of the real Sue Foley...the player instead of Sue Foley the historian.",1304985600,,1760,5.23404255319149
7788316,5,0739062654,"This video combines segments of Sue describing her influences and the research she has done on female Blues Guitar players with discussions on how she plays some of her signature songs. This is not a ""how to play the blues"" training video, but it offers Sue's guitar playing fans an opportunity to understand where her style comes from and how she plays. She does not go through songs note-by-note, but does explain and demonstrate the basic techniques that she uses to play them. There are pdf tabs of the songs provided as well, so I found that to be a great resource, since you can't just go out and get tab books for all of her albums.

I have listened to Sue's music for quite a while and had the opportunity to see her play live, so I was glad to find this video and was satisfied with its content. I would recommend this to an intermediate player who would like to learn some of her songs and follow her style.",1304640000,,917,4.362573099415204
