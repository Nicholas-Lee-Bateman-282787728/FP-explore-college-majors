1625679,4,B00005MKXB,"Don't get me wrong; 'Audition' is a very well-made film, with plenty of genuine twists and intense imagery that makes you squirm in your seat.
But what I thought about while watching this was how stunted the growth of filmmakers in the U.S. has become in comparison.
I saw in this film the best of 'Fatal Attraction', 'Basic Instinct', and 'Play Misty for Me'. Certainly, this film is more graphic but that's because what's happed to the female lead -AND- what's happening to the male lead only shocks when shown.
I've always thought American filmmaking restrained itself except when they weren't worried about having thier film go out as NC-17 or unrated, and that's not too often. It should be. There is a market, whatever the Moral Minority might say, for adult (not porn) film.
Having said that, this film is not for everyone. But it's popular, so what does that say? It is for more than a few...",1023408000,,900,4.666666666666667
1625680,5,B00005MKXB,"..is different, as are their films, as is their humour (e.g. live camera ""humorous"" shows...). If you've been to Japan, you should understand. Judge any japanese film only if you've seen it at least once in original version. I own a big collection of asian DVD's and their films lose so much in any (what ever quality) translation (E/F/G). So to appreciate fully you need to get (and understand) the original feeling. After hearing and reading so much about Audition I was almost  dissapointed 'cause not shocked: I am no gore freak or so, but there is not too much or gratis violence. However, I would have liked to see a more intense phase of courtship and extended sufferings.. this is a main objective of the film. But I take these new Japanese horror pics as they come along, inventive and with power and imagination, even irony. See also Battle Royale. The final sequences are a deception to me, I would have liked more pomp, maybe I am too much influenced by Peter Greenaway!? I really like the film and the DVD is ok, could have more background infos etc. Anyway, just  check out Audition!",1022716800,,1097,4.62051282051282
1625681,5,B00005MKXB,"I originally saw this movie in the theatre. I had heard very little about it but I was not prepared for what was to come. An incredible blend of psychology and horror. The movie plays on like a humorous love story, but what is in the bag? They seem like pretty normal people but then you find out in the bag. Was everything she said lies, or did he tell us what we wanted to hear until the truth came out? America could not make this clever yet gruesome film. As it goes on, you wonder, where is all the scenes everyone's been talking about, and when they come, you want them to stop. This production is put together well in its entirety.",1022716800,,638,4.195121951219512
1625682,2,B00005MKXB,"As many of the other reviewers have suggested, ""Audition"" had the making of a great horror classic. However, I found the direction to be completely incoherent, the production values very poor and the graphic violence completely gratuitous. There was very liitle buildup to the final showdown and, without giving anything away, Asami's motivation was never very convincing. Perhaps the incoherence was intended to unnerve the viewer?  Anyway, this screams for a remake in the hands of a much more capable director with a bigger budget.",1022457600,2,534,5.2823529411764705
1625683,5,B00005MKXB,"Yes, the sound of the movie's anti-heroine as she sticks needles into her man's eyes stays with me.  Audition is a gross melange of styles (love story/personal angst/macabre horror) which builds into a cresendo of harrowing & dramatically brilliant cinema where Asami, the seemingly ingenue girl who auditions for & wins a widower's love, leads him into a spiral of psychological confusion, so much that you wonder if the final scenes happen.  Asami's tortured past creeps up on her & the boudnaries of reality & paranoia devastate Asami & the audience (let alone her partner!) to alarming effect.  Let's just say that this movie is a rollercoaster of moods culminating in some of the most unsheathed & suggestively horrific images ever put into cinema.  A movie which Hollywood doyenne's would never even entertain creating, cheesewire & pins will never be looked at in the same respect again!! Never did I imagine that Japanese cinema would be so brilliant (watch also Ring & Ring 2 for testimony) nor so grittily realistic.  As a lover of horror, this movies not only whet but satisfied my appetite.  Okay, it starts off a bit slow as a love story, but that's the point. The gripping transformation in Asami makes her acts of brutality increasingly powerful & downright scary.  May put you off looking for Mrs Right:-)))))",1020988800,7,1325,4.941441441441442
1625684,5,B00005MKXB,"I am an absolute fan of horror movies and I must admit that I'ts been a long time since I have last been sincerely scared and disturbed like with ""Audition"". Miike Takashi has crafted an amazing movie here, a movie that can be read on many levels. With it's subtle black humor and it's slow unnerving pace the movie will lurk under your skin and I can assure you it will stay there long after you have seen it. Light years ahead of  any Hollywood  modern slasher movie, this is not for everyone, and certainly not for the faint-hearted, but if you are prepeared to ""follow the white rabbit and see how deep the hole goes"" you won't be dissapointed. This is powerful filmaking, Japanese horror at it's best. Believe the hype this is truly something to scream about!",1020470400,3,764,4.489208633093525
1625685,4,B00005MKXB,"I had heard of ""Audition"" for months before actually getting my hands on a copy of the DVD. I basiscally knew what to expect -- slow first hour, horrific final half hour, leaving you guessing at the nature of what really happens. However, because I'd read so much about the film, I think I really cheated myself out of a truly visceral horror experience.
First, a short plot synopsis: Main charcter's wife dies. Seven years later, he's lonely and decides he wants to re-marry. To meet women, he holds an audition, casting for a fake movie, in order to easily meet young women. One particular young lady captures his fancy. But she is definitely more than she seems.
ATTENTION: This is NOT a Hollywood horror film. Don't expect the fake-scare red herrings, or the busty brainless chicks creeping into the attic to find out what that growling noise is. In fact, Audition contains few, if any, ""shock"" moments. Instead, the movie is a slow boil of disturbing creepiness that crescendoes into a brutal third act. This is not to say that there are not horrific moments, certainly this movie is rife with terrible images. But the film plays so differently from the tripe we see in American horror genres. It's slow, it's measured and it's effective.
I might be in the minority here, but I enjoyed the first hour of this film immensely. I liked the main character as a person, even felt a little sorry for him during his quest to find a mate, which made his fate (which I knew because of my research into the film) all the more dreadful.
I suppose because the second half of the film is so brutal,  viewers might feel cheated out of what could have been a nice love story. However, I think this is what makes the film so quintessentially Japanese in its horror. ""Audition"" is the fright of every day relationships, taken to extremes beyond extreme. This is the darkest journey into ideas of loneliness, friendship and the fact that noone really knows anyone in this world. It is an examination of psychological fears made flesh.
My advice: See this movie, but do not ruin it for yourself by reading much about it before experiencing it. ""Kidee, kidee, kidee, kidee.""",1020470400,91,2159,4.666666666666667
1625686,4,B00005MKXB,"Takashi Miike's AUDITION (Odishon) is not your ordinary horror story. Rather, it's a complex look at human frailty, fear and the desire to be loved.
I just saw it at a midnight screening, and the anticipation I and my friends felt was very high. Even the theatre management offered us their high praise of what they said is a very intense and unforgettable film.
Unforgettable and intense would be just two words I would use to describe AUDITION. The words suspenseful, horrific, sad, creepy, and graphic also come to mind. This is not a film for younger viewers (those under 17) or those who are squeamish at all.
The story revolves around a man, Aoyama(Ryo Ishibashi) who some years earlier lost his wife to illness, and had to raise their young son on his own. In the present day, his son is about 22 years old, and Aoyama is feeling old and very lonely. His business partner and he hatch a plan to find him a bride. They use the guise of casting for a film. They hold a casting call from the hundreds of interested young girls who respond to their solicitation. Ayoama, who desperately wants to find a wife, has already set his sights on one girl, Asami (Eihi Shiina) whose very touching letter he read from her resume.
Asami enters the interview room dressed in virginal/angelic white, acting very humble and deferential like a traditional Japanese woman would act toward a man. She is literally a vision of beauty and peace, while there is much more to her emotionally and psychologically. The business partner tells the man there is something he feels is amiss with Asami, and recommends against choosing her. However, Aoyama is irresistibly attracted to her, and can think of nothing but phoning her to say she has the ""part"" for their fake movie.
What transpires for the first half of the film is an unfolding of a potential relationship, wherein Aoyama and Asami spend hours in cafes revealing the most intimate emotions and details of their painful lives. Aoyama truly believes he is falling in love, and all will be well. He does come to tell Asami that he isn't really casting for a film, but really looking for a wife and lifelong companion. Asami then suggests they go away for a weekend away, and the downward spiral begins...
What follows for the next 45 minutes or so is a collage of dream-like flashbacks (a la David Lynch), extreme violence, and a lot of ""heartbreak."" I'm not going to detail the events of the last 20 minutes as this is the point where you DEFINITELY don't want to get up and walk away from the screen. Too much happens here and if you blink, you will miss something.
If you look past the graphic depiction of torture/revenge visited upon the men in this film, you will see that AUDITION is in many ways a social commentary on the modern-day perils, both real and imagined, that all people potentially encounter when they are paralyzed by their fears of loneliness, rejection and sadness.
The film's key strength is its use of genuine suspense and the deliberate unfolding of one horrific image followed by something more innocent. It is this juxtaposition of horror and innocence, love and hate, revenge and desire, that draws the viewer further into the darkness that is the soul of the abused and the unloved.
Recommended with a caution that is very graphic and disturbing. Nonetheless, you won't likely soon forget it!",1017446400,16,3360,4.706281833616298
1625687,5,B00005MKXB,"This is the sickest movie I've ever seen. Eihi Shiina plays her role wonderful. If u finally want to be scared again by a movie, you'll have to watch this one.

1625688,4,B00005MKXB,"I hadn't seen anything by this director before I saw this film at a horror film fest in North Carolina and I must see more.
  Audition starts off like a cheesy romantic comedy about a middle-aged movie producer trying to find a wife in a modern Japan that's nothing like the one he grew up in.  So a friend of his suggests to hold a audition for a film that may or may not be made.  He takes a liking to waifish Eihi Shiina, classicly trained and obedient.  And they appear to hit it off, but as he checks out her past we see events spiraling towards a gruesome end.  Lynch-like in it's dream sequences and Argento-like with it's horror; Audition won't let you look away or leave no matter how much you want to.

The movie finally flips the switch in the middle, which at first is exciting, then delves sharply into truely unsettling matter.  What Japanese films do better than most is to paint the true villains in their most grotesque form. There are many villains in this movie.

1625808,5,B00005MKXB,"I watched this movie because it was listed on Rolling Stone's 20 best horror movies you've never heard of.

They praised the director on excellent use of pacing and build-up. I think they under-praised him.

The movie follows the middle aged man is trying to recover from a death of a spouse. He decides that he wants to start seeing people again and one of his friends recommends that they hold an audition to attract a large number of eligible bachelorettes. Their plan works and soon he is dating a former ballerina turned actress with the past that becomes more mysterious with each scene.

Compared to a lot of movies, the dialogue is relatively sparse. Still you get a great sense of each character's personality and their motivations. The film builds a sense of foreboding danger, but you're not sure how it will develop.

The director makes excellent use of cinematography and dialogue. Many scenes he has a light touch but that is exactly put the scene needed. I am reminded of Soderberg's approach with the Girlfriend Experience.

Another movie that comes to mind is Jacob's ladder. In that one, hell becomes reality and it is not really clear which the viewer is seeing. In this film too, you are left to wonder whether some scenes indeed happened.

I was pleasantly surprised. I knew this was a horror, and I even knew when the horror is supposed to start. The beauty of this film is how get incorporates to psychological horror. Some of the scenes which I play over and over my head had no such impact when I first saw.

1625852,4,B00005MKXB,"Made in 1999 this is a nightmarish horror that will stick with you. It is about Shigeharu Aoyama, he lives in Tokyo and has lost his wife  leaving him to bring up his son alone. As the years have passed he realises it is time to find love again. He works for a TV production company and so a friend there suggests that they hold an audition for the perfect companion for him under the ruse of actually casting for a part.

The ideal candidate shows up and Shigeharu Aoyama is rather taken with her  but is she all she seems? If something is too good to be true it generally isn't true and Shigeharu Aoyama is about to find out the very hard way.

Now to say this can be nasty is a bit of an under statement  it had me squirming on more than one occasion. It is the sort of film where you shout advice at the screen in the hope that they won't do the stupid thing. That aside it is masterfully done, utterly compelling and mad as hell  completely recommended.",1452902400,,958,4.151351351351352

Seriously great. But seriously disturbing. Eli Roth and Rob Zombie allegedly had a hard time watching.

I'd love to show this movie to everyone who thought Paranormal Activity needed some Red Bull.  The acting is decent, but not enough to save the story.  The climax literally comes out of thin air;  The movie literally shakes and remembers to tell you things you should know, jumping back in time for no reason.

*Spoilers*
The climax is the biggest let-down, moreso since you've been sitting and watching this movie for a little over 80 minutes when things actually start to happen.  The main character gets drugged, then the movie decides to pull some kind of Memento crap and starts flashbacking, showing scenes you've seen before with different things happening in them.  I have no idea if that's what actually happened or if it's a hallucination because it comes out of nowhere.  He then gets his ""comeuppance"", as typical in these types of films, except he doesn't deserve it at all; His new girlfriend flips out at the mere sight of a picture of a woman at his desk.  He never told her about his dead wife?  He sure as hell wasn't hiding it.  How did she know it was his dead wife?  Was he really banging every chick in the movie, even in front of man-in-the-bag?  The subplot with the wheelchair guy lead absolutely nowhere.

I guess I'm left to believe that this is a kind of Misery-type chick: 'I'll make you love me, like the man-in-the-bag, but not like the barkeeper...or the guy in the wheelchair.'  The antagonist's motivations and intentions are all over the place.",1439424000,3,1627,4.620209059233449

Audition is often cited as one of those great horror films you've never seen. In fact, I've seen two documentaries on that subject and both had Audition on their lists - so, I decided to check it out.

In all honesty, I thought this one was just OK - there are no real scares or chills. Instead, this slow-build film (in fact, it seems to be as well known for its torture scenes as it is for the very slow build) is a psychological horror film as well. Now, normally, I love horror of all kinds, and films with a strong psychological element are among my favs.

Audition did invest me in the main character, a lonely, late middle-aged bachelor looking for love. But, while I did empathize and sympathize, I never really felt fearful FOR him, nor fearful OF the female villain. So, while I do see the attraction so many horror fans find in the film, this one just didn't do it for me. And, at the end of the day, I'd recommend it - maybe you'll have a different reaction.",1424995200,2,1019,4.296875

1625959,5,B00005MKXB,"Audition is a story of a widower,Aoyama Shigeharu,who is a middle-aged president of a video production company, left alone with a teen-age son when his wife died seven years before. At his son's prompting, he finally starts to think about remarrying, but the method he chooses for selecting his potential bride is unusual, to say the least.

On the idea of his friend Yoshikawa,he decides to hold an audition, using the excuse of a possibly-to-be-made movie to survey the female field. Looking at the resumes, he actually comes across one, from a Yamasaki Asami,that peaks his interest. The essay she wrote, relating the loss of her childhood dream (to study ballet) and the specter of death that she faced, shows a maturity the others do not.

When it comes to the actual audition, Aoyama ends up ignoring most of the other women, and promptly calls Asami that night. They seem to hit it off well, with Aoyama eventually deciding to propose to her on a trip to the seashore, but after they sleep together, with Asami asking him to love ""only me,"" she suddenly disappears. His subsequent search for her only turns up grisly mysteries of missing men and dismembered bodies.

It would be easy to turn Asami into some monstrous female man-eater, but the director, Miike, a veteran of many films about the marginal and displaced, is too concerned with those who don't fit in society to allow that. Dialogue early in the film equating catching fish to catching women emphasizes the violence of the audition and establishes, even with the sympathy we feel for Aoyama, that he is not free of guilt.

This is the best horror film I have ever seen in world cinema. Better than those horror films whose goal is just to scare us. By the way,this movie is not for everyone for it is a dark film and more concentration is needed while watching this film.

I consider this a grim character study, not of the pretty, young, psychotic madwoman but of the state of womanhood in Japan and the state of relations there between the sexes. Women must be meek, cultured, and ""obedient"" while men pretty much get to have their way with them. This second-class treatment seems to have taken a severe toll on the protagonist, who asks the men who show an interest in her to ""love only her"" and then she proceeds, in her sick way, to make sure they stay put. The suspense builds gradually and artfully but her victim's realization of the monster she truly is is conveyed in flashback scenes that, to this viewer, seemed out of place. It didn't seem possible, the way the story unfolded on the screen, that the lonely, widower victim, who devised an intricate ""screen test"" plot with his movie industry friend, to find a mate, could discover the details of her past. Maybe I missed something. Or maybe it's the way the Japanese tell a story in cinema, but I didn't completely buy that the poor guy learned, firsthand, all the details about her gruesome past.

1626040,5,B00005MKXB,"Audition was my introduction to ""Asia Extreme Tartan"" and Asian horror.  Good one to start with, right?  Well for me it was.

For some people this movie will move ""too slow"".  those those people I would say that you probably won't/don't enjoy some of the better ""horror"" films from Japan/S. Korea/Thailand because Asian ""horror"" tends to be more psychological and slower paced.  They're not the go for the gore from the start type of movies - usually.  I'm not talking the real extreme stuff (ex: Guinea Pig, which NO I haven't watched, even I have limits).  I'm talking more like A Tale of Two Sisters, Kairo, Ringu (not to be confused with the very cool FX but completely different story The Ring).

Watch this movie closely - the slow parts.  You might want to watch it more than once to pick up on some of the more subtle nuances ex: Shigeharu Aoyama turning his wife's picture around, for instance - there are reasons for just about everything in this movie.  Some won't make sense, especially to the normal Western mindset.  Like, why did Asami Yamazaki allow the branding and other abuses?

The last half hour?  Oh, it's ON!  Now, you will need to have a bit of a strong stomach and yeah, probably a bit of a twisted sense of humor for one specific thing (the window ""splat"" cracked me up).  Yes, Asami is very, very, very, VERY disturbed.  That's why you need to pay attention to the rest of the movie and be patient - take in as much as you can to try to get into Asami's head even a little.

I will say, it's been noted that Rob Zombie found this difficult to watch (really?!), so if you're squeamish this probably isn't for you.  If you're impatient or only like fast-paced films, this probably isn't for you.",1387670400,3,1720,4.493548387096774

1626043,5,B00005MKXB,"I've watched all the popular horror movies such as: Friday the 13th, Halloween,  Night of The Living Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street, Paranormal Activity, Scream,  Texas chainsaw massacre, The Ring, The Grudge, The Walking Dead, and all movies based on Stephen King's novels, etc. Audition (1999) is one of the most horrifying and credible of them all.
That's because it realistically and skillfully depicts the brutality of human beings. It reminds me of notorious serial killers such as Ted Bundy. He also looked loveable and well-mannered as the killer here. People could not detect Ted's dark side by examining his appearance. The same thing happened in this film. This is one of the reasons why it still scares the wits out of me for a long time after it ended. It's so close to reality.
Of course, other pictures had terrifying scenes too but most of them were related to ghosts, devils or paranormal entities. Here, we were dealing with human beings with extremely twisted minds. It truly reflected the killings executed by serial killers in real life.

The acting of the main characters played by Ryo Ishibashi, and Eihi Shiina was superb.  They made it suspenseful, credible and frightening.

The director paid attention to details of human's actions and psychology. For example in one scene, the main male character was restless. He was torn between calling the audition applicant he liked and not calling her. He promised his friend not to call her but in his heart he did want to. He walked back and forth. He picked up the phone then put it back to its cradle, etc. Those actions were very much like those of an ordinary person. They struck a chord with me.

The director also gave the main actors enough time to develop their characters. This made the movie deeper. Some people might think it made the pace slow but I thought it was okay.

It also had more than a couple of twists that made me shudder and caught me completely by surprise.

Because of the nature of horror movies, the less you know about it in advance, the more you will enjoy it. So, try not to read its spoilers before watching it.

The only problem is it will be much less interesting when we watch it the second time because we already know what happened.

Amazingly, it was made 14 years ago and yet it's so believable and entertaining. It is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT than every Hollywood horror movies I have seen. In short, it's one of the BEST that my MONEY can GET in terms of horror movies, suspense, credibility, acting and twists.",1383004800,6,2517,4.687074829931973

1626045,5,B00005MKXB,"SPOILER ALERT

Takashi Miike's ""Audition"" sets a brilliant example for a horror movie. The film litteraly had me gripping onto my chair watching the film for the first time because I was confused, I had no clue as to what was going on or what to expect. The only thing I really heard was a torture scene in the film, and sitting through this movie, although some may say it was slow, was surely worth it. To fully understand this work of art, one may have to rewatch the film again a second, or even a third time, and REALLY pay attention to the dialogue, actions, themes, and symbolism in the film. It's really a complex movie. Most people will say that ""THE BI*CH WAS CRAZY"" or they'll simply comment on the infamous torture scenes. Me having a strong stomach and all had no problem ""digesting"" this film, since I am too a gore fanatic, but this movie isn't all about the gore or the torture scene. It is there to shock the audience, obviously, but I personally feel the torture is a symbol. Asami is also a symbol in the many aspects of the film, and that is what I am going to analyze for this film.
Auyoma, the protagonist of the film is a widower, and he is dispirited in life so he holds a faux audition in the means of finding his ideal woman, who is Asami Yamazaki. When he reads her essay prior to the audition, you will notice that Auyoma's dead wife's picture is sitting on his desk where he is working, and it is a distraction for him, so he turns the picture so the face of Ryoko(Auyoma's dead wife) is not facing him. That in itself is a symbol of his guilty conscience pressing inward. When he's holding a fake audition to find his new love, he's also letting go of Ryoko to feel happier in his life. Auyoma does not want to make Ryoko think that he is cheating on her with another woman, so he is trying to steer away from the crime by turning the picture of her so she doesn't have to see it. The guy in the bag is symbolic of his agony, and the troubling child hood of Asami is a symbol of his despair. Notice, in the film, there are two scenes where Asami discusses her childhood to Auyoma. The first time is before Asami supposedly puts a sedative in his drink, and during the first cut, Asami tells Auyoma that she had a decent, average childhood. When Asami does sedate Auyoma, that is when the guilt takes place. Note, between the first conversation about Asami's childhood and the second time, Asami and Auyoma were strongly applied to have sex. ""Will you love me and only me"" can also be a symbol for Auyoma's despair and need for another partner, because now that his son is getting older and will probably be moving soon, he doesn't want to be lonely when he leaves and lives on his own. During the second conversation between Asami and Auyoma about her childhood, which is after Auyoma collapses from the sedative, Asami talks about the abuse she had coped with. The abuse symbolizes his guilt for setting up the faux audition and lying to a soft-spoken, sensitive young girl who has been torn to shreds because of her past, that most likely did not happen(again, this is during the hallucination scene). The torture scene is representative to the consequences. ""Words create lies; pain can be trusted"" means that he has lied to Asami, but he feels the pain from the torture, not from her supposedly cutting off his foot or sticking acupuncture needles in various parts of his body, but because of his actions. From him setting up a faux audition, feeling like he's betrayed his dead wife by trying to seek a new love, and lying to a sensitive and broken girl(Asami). The hallucination ends when he wakes up and realizes that it was all a dream, and we as the audiences can only interpret what will happen next, since Asami is in the bed with Auyoma when he wakes up. However, there's more! What about the end of the movie when the perspective switches back to the hallucination scene? Auyoma's son mortally injured Asami, and Asami is reciting words describing the excitement about talking to Auyoma when he called her back after the audition. This makes Auyoma cry, and he regrets ever hurting Asami(himself) because of his actions, because Asami is representative to Auyoma's guilt and conscience during the hallucination scene, and with that in mind, Auyoma will then change his behavior and approach when he hangs out with Asami in reality.
This is my own interpretation of the movie, because it is a movie that leaves you thinking and guessing as the credits role. The creators of this film aren't spoon feeding the audience, they leave the audiences clueless so we can dissect from the movie what we want, and this is how I saw the movie in my own perspective.",1382918400,2,4696,4.498829039812646

1626059,1,B00005MKXB,"I am a fan of horror films and Japanese horror films in particular, because more often then not they tell a good story that actually manages to be scary. This is one jap film you can safely pass on because it's neither scary, creepy nor entertaining.

For what seems like the first 2/3 of the movie, the story oozes along telling a fairly typical story of a lonely middle-aged guy who wants to get re-married. He is apparently the owner of a movie production company and decides to hold an audition, with the idea that the applicants are his potential mates.

Not surprisingly one of the applicants catches his attention and he decides to pursue an awkward romantic relationship with her. She's 24 and he's probably 50-something, so that's creepy in the ""really, dude? you're dating your daughter"" kinda way.

After they meet a few times, the movie turns into a disjointed clusterfcuk of ""out of order"" story telling in an effort to make the one dimensional characters appear to have more depth. I get that japanese films love to start telling the story from the middle, but much like auto-tune, over-use of this technique makes it become old and stale.

*** Possible Spoiler ***

The movie culminates with the girl claiming that the guy who claimed to ""love only her"" was also banging just about every other female who appeared in the movie, including one really ugly woman who worked at his office (not enough beer in the world, my friends). The movie seemed to imply that even though he slept with these women, he did not remember doing so - which I can't blame him for, because they were rather hideous.

Aside from those implications about him that seemed to be injected out of nowhere, the only thing Mr. Lonely was guilty of in this film was liking girls who were half his age. The movie did not portray him to be a womanizer, which made the last scene incredibly stupid and out of place.

Near the end, the film seemed to show two versions of events: one version where he and the girl agree to get married and another (which is implied to be what actually happened), that the girl was some kind of serial killer that liked to torture and dismember her victims - lonely, middle-aged japanese men. Neither one really makes sense.

Now, if you have a buddy who likes Asian Horror, I want you to do for them what I wish someone did for me. Make them watch this movie with zero-preknowledge*. Don't even let him read the back of the box. Say to friend, ""yeah its some kind of relationship flick** but you gotta see it anyway."" If you friend is like me, they will thank you afterwards.

Once the movie is over you can unwind laughing at the extra feature where other horror directors and authors talk about how much they were disturbed by _Audition_.

1626107,4,B00005MKXB,"So I finally watched Takashi Miike's infamous Audition and let me say that this film lived up to all it's hype but in a different way. I am just recently beginning to try and watch all of his films after seeing the shocking and insanely good Ichi The Killer. So after hearing renowned directors of horror such as Eli Roth and Rob Zombie talk specifically about this film on a special on Bravo I made this one my must see before I descended into Miike's madness. Now I knew a little of this film,let me say I knew of it's reputation and that it is one of only four of his horror films. I heard that it had some torture and other disturbing content.spoiler alerts:So me and my buddy sat down and popped it on and prepared,now it is not your typical horror/torture/gory film by any means it moves at a brooding almost a little boring pace but it is a very effective and intelligent directing strategy. So those expecting a Japanese Saw that is not the case. The film begins rather charmingly with a man tragically losing his wife to an illness and jumps ahead 7 years to him and his son's relationship which is close but his son is a teenager now with a girlfreind and his own life and just doesn't need his dad for company as much anymore. So him and his buddy who both work in TV come up with a smart but semi sleazy idea to hold a false audition so he can meet and hopefully find a new mate. The audition scene is very amusing and being a lover of asian women a very sexy scene with lots of cute japanese women shedding clothes,giggling,and just being cute.finally the 3rd to last audition steals his attention and his heart. She comes off as the kind of woman evry man would want. Obediant,cute,soft spoken almost resembling a little angelic like school girl. His freind is not as impressed though and does some digging into her past and her resume. Turns out most of it if not all of it is a lie and even more creepy her old boss who she said was her current employer has been missing for a year,just dissapeared. So he says don't call her,then the eerieness of the film begins we see her hunched over with no exprssion on her face in a vacant like room waiting intently by the phone,the only furniture like thing we see is a big burlap sack,then when he finally breaks down and calls her we cut back to almost an identical scene,her sitting in the same spot,same postion as what were lead to beleive she was sitting in days ago when we saw her last. Then the phone rings and we see the most creepy and mischiefious grin come across her face then that same burlap sack moves and rolls across the room,then it cuts to them in a resturaunt talking. Absolute proof of just fantastic directing,just letting things build to the point where you know something very sinister is not only currently happening but what is to come when her true nature comes about. The film continues in it's brooding pace with a dark undertone just looming over,your thinking when his he gonna clue in and investigate this mystery woman whom he has already caught in a lie more then once but is just to star struck to say anything. Then he finally does it he goes to her reidence from her resume that turns out to be a abandoned,run down old ballerina studio. There he meets her uncle and we find out where some of her scars came from in a truly disturbing flashback to her childhhod then it cuts to another scene where we are in the point of view of the woman out side of his house and she sneaks right on in. By this point we know something bad is about to go down,The man comes home and pours his routine glass of scotch but it's a little stronger then usual and he collapses to the floor. What follows next is a retro dream that is very David Lynch like and is a good 10 minutes of wtf is going on,then we find out why this film is the # 11 scary movie of all time. I don't want to give too much away but let me say that the final 20 minutes of this film will disturb you and stay with you for awhile. It's not even that it's that gory or violent compared to Zombie and Roth's films and even Miike's other films the gore is pretty tamed. It's just the sadism and the enjoyment in the acts that just shock you and that it's happening to an absolute saint of a human being and what we discover is in the sack makes the gimp from Pulp Fiction look like a cute puppy. Do yourself a favor if you are a true horror fan who truly appreciates real horror such as mood,story and power over just blood,guts and a body count then watch Takashi's Audition. I found it to be the most creepy and disturbing film since Texas Chainsaw Massacre(1974) don't let the negative reviews that say it's slow and boring derail you,the slow pace and build up is what makes this film especially the shocking climax all the more powerful and proves why Takashi Miike is not only Japan's finest director but internationally in the top 3 best filmakers around period,the other to being Qeuntin Tarantino and Oliver Stone. So check this film out now,also check out City of lost souls and Ichi the killer 2 other fantastic Miike films but vastly different another plus to this movie is that it is one of 4 horror films by Miike I havn't seen 2 of them yet but I have seen masters of horror's Imprint which is amazing as well so if you like this also check the others out..",1355788800,3,5319,4.304087736789631
1626108,5,B00005MKXB,"Those of us who revere opera as the highest art form are all subliminally aware of what a great challenge a successful career in opera poses.  This DVD confirms that beyond any doubt.  I had the greatest admiration for these young singers who had sacrificed so much to reach the Finals and appear with Maestro Marco Armiliato conducting on the greatest of all opera stages.  They all did so well that I had difficulty deciding who the winners of the Finals should be.  However, I had concluded before hearing the Judges' decisions that Alek Shrader was probably the best performer.  His rendition of ""Ah, mes amis"" from La Fille du Regiment was simply incredible for such a young artist.  I was much touched also by Michael Fabiano's rendition of Lensky's aria from Eugene Onegin.  He brought out the pathos of this truly Russian aria in a most moving way.  Most surprising of all was Ryan Smith's performance.  When I first heard him earlier in the DVD, I thought he had no chance of winning.  However, when he finally appeared on the stage at the Met and performed ""E la solita storia del pastore"" from Cilea's L'arlesiana he clearly transcended anything he had done before and was himself amazed at his own performance.  Even Caruso who had popularized this aria so long ago would have been proud!  It was most sad  to hear that Ryan had later succumbed to cancer.  In conclusion, I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough to all opera lovers and indeed it offers also a lot of potential tips to aspiring opera singers who have the courage to enter for later auditions.",1355529600,6,1572,4.669090909090909

It does seem to validate the process as a way of identifying singers definitely on the way up.  The documentary is fascinating in showing the process and conveying its joys and pressures.  There are a number of fine performances but a number of them are truncated for the purposes of the drama.  The interview with Renee Fleming, Susan Graham, and Thomas Hampson is a fine extra.  It would have been nice to have a few more complete performances from the finals and some more of the coaching sessions as supplementary material.

Hence the introduction of the father's film producer friend.  The two characters stage a film with dozens of eligible young women ostensibly auditioning for the lead role.  Meanwhile, of course, the father has ulterior motives in meeting and interviewing the ladies.

When the father meets the leading lady, there is an instant chemistry between the two and they hit it off, going out to dinner, spending the weekend together, meeting her stepfather, etc.  She has a troubled past, including abuse and the shattering of her dreams as a ballerina, but has resolved many of her issues with her abusive stepfather and now apparently cares for him at her residence.

Finally, she comes back to his house, where things get off on the wrong foot when the young lady introduces the father to her amateur acupuncture skills.  This is also the moment in the movie when the young lady meets the son and there is definitely some friction between the two.

The end of the movie is unclear, but I am optimistic that these two lovebirds will make it work out in the end, despite their differences.  They may have some issues to resolve and possibly some couples counseling, but you just know that love conquers all and they'll stay together.",1351296000,14,1488,4.77734375

The only thing that bothered my girlfriend was the needles, the piano wire didn't even phase her. The feeding of the bag was kinda interesting but it bored me other then that.

I'm not really a gorehound although I have watched the goriest/most disturbing movies ever filmed, and this would be nowhere on that list.

Amber Wagner is her name, and I learned she had been a finalist in the 2007 Met Auditions. Bingo.

Frankly, I was seriously irritated that the people who produced and edited this otherwise fine video for some reason well beyond my understanding were so unimpressed by this spectacular voice, she was consistently given short shrift when it came to featuring her. The fact that she was one of the finalists apparently didn't impress them much. Her ""winning"" performance the final night was abbreviated to a very short excerpt, repeated at the very end in the wrap-up of the video. The practice sessions often did not include her offerings at all.

I've been an opera nut for more years than I care to admit to, and I go on record here: This is a rare voice nutured by an extremely levelheaded young woman, one full of confidence, work ethic, intelligence and strength; and while most of the others, in my opinion, will do well indeed, I think she will outstrip them all in a few years.",1336003200,2,1422,4.616600790513834

Yes, sure, American horror's gore and violence is lovely and entertaining, the horror label of it stems from the fact that it would be horrible if you had to go through it. But American horror is terribly superficial. Almost all American horror films have the exact same plot, you can guess that that one dumb blonde bimbo with her breasts popping out her top is going to go searching for the noise and ask ""who's there?"" Japanese horror is far more emotional, psychological, deeper. Films like this haunt you for longer because characters like this stick with you. They are misleading, you don't know where it's going, and from seeing what the girl is like at the start to the end, the idea sticks that people are not what they seem, that they shouldn't be trusted, that you never really know a person.

1626124,1,B00005MKXB,"I believe in total artistic freedom, but some things go too far. This is one of them.
 It's not that it's scary, which it isn't, it's exploitative. Produced by dullerds with a passion for torture and cruelty, for an audience learning to enjoy torture and cruelty. The images in this movie not only sicken normal sensibilities, but more importantly act as receipes for a deranged mind. We have plenty of these already. People near that border, don't need any more ideas.
 There is no need for any extended-detailed-depictions of human torturing. We don't stand it for animals, even suggested, and people throw a fit.
  WHY isn't the same applied to humans? There is NO possible merit, or necessity, for including torture in movies.
 If a movie was based on factual events, or was intregal to the story, then torture only needs the briefest nod until our imagination takes over and fills in the rest. Just as effective.  A portion of society has grown up seeking cruelty and suffering in movies. It seems to be getting bigger. People that relish this kind of movie, and consider the 'normal' horror movies too boring and tame, are evidense of their own lack of sensibility. They haven't faintest idea of pain or misfortune because they lack the imagination.
 A new category should be created for movies like this, and this stuck in it. Something to alert, and hopefully, limit audiences. The producers of such films wouldn't like such action. Too bad.
The movie industry is already controlled by a group of sexually repressed puritans. Passing judgement on X-rated material,and restricting and categorizing everything else. Protecting youngsters! Nonsense. Continual nudity and scenes of the rawest fornication possible, can't damage children like violence can.
 'Well, just don't watch movies like Audition. Nope, that's not the answer. By the time the torture or cruelty scene appears, the damage is already done.",1327190400,6,1913,5.070063694267516

1626137,3,B00005MKXB,"I watched Audition having read absolutely no reviews of it and not knowing what to expect.  The first half is bland, the second half has the horror.  I thought it was overly gory, but liked various back story glimpses into the heroine's tragic past.

The plot to Audition follows a middle aged businessman, Aoyama.  His wife died years ago, and now his teenage son is beginning to date and wonders why dad doesn't date and remarry too.  A co-worker who produces films plays match-maker and holds an audition for the romantic lead in a script featuring a heroine with traits Aoyama finds desirable and an age ranging from early 20s to early 30s.  The movie isn't funded, so the audition is a way to screen women for Aoyama.  Aoyama takes a shine to a girl with a past which is both sad and difficult to verify.  She seems sweet, but you know it's a horror movie.

Oddly, I didn't find this movie that scarey.  It's gory, but that didn't bother me much.  What sticks with me most is the way the heroine is developed.  As she dates Aoyama and talks, she is open about her childhood.  She has a sad past with abuse and loneliness.  Later, as things move from romance to horror, it becomes clear how she brings the past with her.  Even her ultimate fate follows the same trajectory.

Overall, this is a solid gore film, with gore that is simultaneously overstated and understated.  It's not a must see, but also not a waste of time.  It's worth a watch, but not worth going to much effort to see.",1318896000,2,1491,4.439114391143911

The first half of the movie plays like a romance/drama that's very dull and slightly weird. Then the plot changes to a kind of surreal suspense film from the halfway point until twenty minutes before the end.

And then the end happens.

If you have a low acceptance of gore, do not watch this movie. If right now you're thinking ""Bah, I watched Saw, and that was really gory"", then do not watch this movie. The ending sequence is widely renowned as incredibly disturbing on an emotional level. It may seem like ruining the movie to say this to someone who has yet to see it, but it is necessary to prepare yourself for this moment in order to experience it without just pressing pause and never pressing play again.

1626142,3,B00005MKXB,"A bit artsy fartsy for me. A middle age guy looking for a young woman he can love and grow old with after his wife's death seven years prior. I'm not sure how available a beautiful woman that age would be to a man in his 40's/50's in Japanese culture, but he falls for her hook line and sinker. The acting was very good by all around and the subtitles took nothing away from the film. That being said, this reminded me a bit of Black Swan with Natalie Portman. The first half of the film was realistic and well done, but later on we get the make believe ""artsy"" scenes that were a turn off.

Note also some of the scenes are gory and quite disturbing as others mentioned. In some sense the whole thing was about men getting up there in years and wanting a younger woman to fall in love with and being dangled and rejected.",1309651200,,822,4.169811320754717

There's nothing here that hasn't been done before, and I found it completely predictable.  However, this director is the best in the game, and he has me squirming and creeped-out every time.  The plot is fairly simple, and is really just an excuse to show gratuitous violence and dismemberment, but that's okay with me.  I like a horror movie that isn't embarrassed to be a horror movie.

1626144,5,B00005MKXB,"This is definately a movie that every horror fan should see at least once.  The movie is almost exactly the same as the book, with a few extra gore bits in it.  The plot is simple, guy's wife dies, guy wants to meet young girl, he holds fake audition, young girl falls for it and than the second half happens!  The movie starts slow and methodical and finishes in a conclusion that is so intense that you will not want to look away.  You will be disgusted and enchanted by Asami at the same time.

The movie is definately a social commentary on Japanese men and women, and their perceived gender roles.  Similarly it is a commentary on what could happen if the wrong guy picks up the wrong ""docile"" girl.  Get ready for a few pretty hardcore scenes of violence.  But even through the violence Asami still maintains her elegant, feminine poise.  The movie is definately filled with black humor, gore, violence and even has a nice beautiful love story in it.  The movie is great and is a must see for horror fans.

If you do not have the stomach for torture or violence, you might be better of sticking with the book.  I have seen many of Miike's movies and this one is definately one of the tamer ones but in my opinion is certainly his most genius!",1307664000,,1248,4.354978354978355

Perhaps the reason why the film was so effective for me was that I knew nothing about the plot, the trailer revealed nothing, it was just a sequence of creepy and atmospheric scenes without dialogue. Unfortunately the film has since been branded as highly disturbing and gorey, which ruins the impact of the last few scenes. If possible, try to forget everything you've heard about this film when watching it, enjoy it for what it is, a romantic drama for the most part. If you have a strong stomach and an appreciation for beautifully photographed and well acted cinema, you will love this flick.

I often wonder why since I can't explain why I like it myself... maybe because although the slow bits can seem almost mind numbing at times I think it makes the horror of what ends up happening that much worse. Here you are observing a relationship that seems to start slow and boring... but then it seems like something weird is going on... can't quite put my finger on it... and about the time you feel that tension, it goes back to being mundane and boring. There's that extremely slow build-up with flashes of absolute creepiness... and about the time you get crazy bored again it seems like all hell breaks loose and you have no idea what's going on until the end when you're like...

1626178,4,B00005MKXB,"""Audition"" is heavily praised by millions across the globe citing it as one of the greatest films to ever come out of Asia.  Critically acclaimed as a Japanese horror and thriller masterpiece, ""Audition"" is a gem within the vast mass of foreign films available to the American public.  Due to its everlasting praise at every turn, I was intrigued enough to check out the film for myself in order to analyze its value from my own, personal perspective as compared to what I have heard in regards to the film.  Described as being ""violent, obscene, grotesque, gory, creepy, and haunting"", does the film live up to all of its praise or does it deserve its own fair share of criticism?  The answer: a mixture of the two.  The film has its high points, but it is also full of negative points which heavily weigh it down from being as haunting as other foreign masterpieces within the horror genre.

The film begins by showing a man in the hospital with his wife, who is sick and dying.  The woman dies and leaves her husband and son behind to fend for themselves.  Immediately the film takes the viewer to a later time, showing the son and father fishing together with the son discussing reasons why his father should begin dating women again.  Full of grief, the man (Shigeharu Aoyama) never remarried, but his son feels it's about time he tests the waters again and tries to find another companion for his lonely life.  Shigeharu Aoyama eventually agrees with his son, and with the help of his friend, the two men come up with a perfect plan for Shigeharu Aoyama to meet a nice woman who meets his qualifications: hold an audition.

The audition is held in false light, telling young women that the two men are producing a new film and that they are in search of the lead actress for the film.  Hundreds of women show up for the audition, all showing their best reasons why they should be chosen, whether it's from their dancing skills, acting skills, or their willingness to strip off their clothes in front of the two men, all of the women are trying their best to get the part at all costs.  However, one woman truly catches Shigeharu Aoyama's eye, a young woman by the name of Asami Yamazaki.  Asami Yamazaki is very shy, a quiet girl who is very reserved in her actions when approaching the two men.  Immediately Aoyama is fascinated by her and asks her out the next day.

Aoyama and Asami begin to bond, however, the closer he gets to Asami, the more his friend questions the woman's true intentions and motives.  It is slowly revealed that everything Asami has said is nothing but a lie, from here address, to her place of employment and even the name of her manager at a major record label.  The film continues to simply display the ever-growing attraction and obsession that Aoyama has for the woman, depicting the several dates the two go on, along with other intimate encounters between the two.

For this reason, the film feels more like a drama, a romantic tale between two people.  The slow pacing lasts for almost the entire length of the movie, simply consisting of the two lovers interactions with one another, and almost nothing else occurring.  Not until the last 25 minutes or so does the film truly become intense with shocking scenes of violence, and grotesque mannerisms.  Through a series of flashbacks and other glimpses into Asami's past, the audience is greeted to scenes of body mutilation to a high degree.  The truth behind Asami and her former lover is revealed, along with her true past actions of murder and deception.  With Aoyama as her new target, Asami will stop at nothing to make sure the man will not leave her, even if that means slicing off his feet so he can no longer walk.

The film takes too long to develop into a truly intense horror/thriller flick.  The majority of the movie is simply used to show a romantic connection between two people, with little to no other developments occurring whatsoever.  However, once the film takes a turn and decides to pick up, the film becomes one of the most disturbing foreign horror films available on the market.  It provides the audience with vile, stomach turning scenes and violence rarely shown in most Japanese movies.  The last 20 minutes of the movie do make up for the slow build up, but it still leaves the audience wishing that the film had taken the dramatic turn much earlier before the viewer loses their attention due to the lack of development within the movie up until the turning point.  ""Audition"" is an excellent addition to any collection, as long as the viewer knows what to expect: a film with a very slow pacing but a very dramatic, violent, grotesque ending sure to satisfy any horror fan.  If you're looking for a better paced foreign film, ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" is a truly haunting Korean film that keeps the audience disturbed with constant images of gore and provides a high quantity of thrills throughout its entirety.",1285545600,,4933,4.635632183908046

I've invited friends to view it,  I've carted it around to others' homes, I've pestered people to look out for another showing on Public Television.  I've had to put the DVD away for a little, although in no way has it palled for me.  It has so many aspects. The  wonderful singing,of course, the awesomeness of the auditorium, the backstage,  the kindness and helpfulness of the Met staffers  to these young singers (in the finale, one of the voice coaches has tears running down her cheeks, as she listens backstage), the eavesdropping on conversations between the singers, their talks into the camera when they explain what their chosen aria means to them.  The expressions on their faces when caught in unguarded moments particularly--- as the filmmaker points out--
when they hear each other sing for the first time with the orchestra. One very articulate young woman spells out after a breathing class that you get all this advice, you practice the techniques,  but then, you forget it all and  you sing---but, to sing like this. It is possible only after years and years of training.  One tenor, Alek Shrader,singing Ah. Mes Amis, was just a knock-out, bursting with barely contained energy, as he hit the nine high C's the aria calls for. By  now launched in his career and represented by a New York agent,

Audition has a nice touch to it. Something that most Japanese horror films have. They are simple and try to bring your mind in to play. They don't go for the big right away they usually try to lure you into them and keep you guessing.

Audition is in much the same fashion. Starting out with what feels like a normal movie then turns into an unexpected horror. This film you pretty much feel for the main character and his plight to find himself a good wife because he is a good man and that's all he wants. Just a nice simple woman that he can love and she can love him back. Knowing the main characters good intentions are what makes this a horror in seeing how it turns out.

For the first 1hour and 10 minutes or so the film is great but then it's like the writers left the room and some random guy walked in and started defecating over the masterpiece they were righting. This movie doesn't have a satisfying ending at all. Mainly because you'll find yourself watching the ye ol' is this real or not dream sequence. It last longer than it should and it completely ruins the film I felt. It destroys the story they were trying to tell. Instead of writing out the movie where the main character discovers these things for himself they shove it in your face with a dream sequence. There's some disgusting stuff in the dream sequence that will make you cringe but for the most part you don't know what's really happening. It goes from interesting to bizarre to you completely lost me.

I like horror but the Alice and wonderland sequences are ""played out"". They are a cheap shot to throw in a story that you couldn't figure out how to write (I hope movie producers realize we see through this). The ending actually left me more confused than shocked...then it ends abruptly.

 ***might be a spoiler here*** The only real shock is that female in the story was abused all her life and she finally did meet a man that cared for who she really was and she tried to torture him to death). I guess the joke was on her and him.

Either way this movie was going to end up a disaster... what could be expected from a guy who wants to marry a woman after only 3 dates. Better to take his foot now than half his finances after a messy divorce later down the line. Now that I think about it he should be happy he got off that easy.

3stars not a bad movie at all it just falls short of what it could have been. I think the writers/director could have done better.",1282780800,2,2652,4.248015873015873

1626202,1,B00005MKXB,"Audition is heralded as being one of the greatest horror films of the last decade. It's supposed to be creepy, eerie, shocking, horrifying, etc, etc, etc. It sounds like a winning formula, since a lot of horror films these days sacrifice these aesthetics for gore and an element to gross out the audience. I had high expectations for this movie and expected to be as enthralled as everyone else. Lo and behold, it is yet another ridiculously overrated movie.

It has a nice concept. Shigeharu holds an ""audition"" to find s replacement for the wife he lost 7 years ago to an illness. The one he finds seems to be perfect at face value, but we soon learn that there's a little more to her than meets the eye. I will give this film one compliment - it certainly takes the time to develop its characters. The theme of loneliness driving people to do ridiculous things (whether it's wanting to marry someone you just met, or just wanting to torture theme) is actually very powerful. However, that's the only good that this movie generates. Its biggest flaw is its pacing. Audition drags on... and on... and on... and on. Hardly anything happens within the first 80 minutes of its 115-minute run time, aside from a moving sack, which almost everyone on the planet has heard of. This film mistakes its boring, droning atmosphere for a dark, brooding one. By the time the excitement begins, I was already left with the desire to shut it off because the previous footage was a sleeping pill. The two main characters have plenty of depth, but they overstay their welcome way before the movie is over, and I found it hard to care about them by the time the ""torture"" scenes began. It's 115 minutes that could have very easily been condensed to 80 or even 70 minutes. A lot of the film gets very redundant with the two of them going out to dinner on a multitude of times and them both staring lustfully at the phone for God knows how long.

The movie really isn't even that disturbing. I'll admit, though, that the ""vomit scene"" certainly made me cringe and was legitimately creepy. It's a testament to the idea that horror films don't need gore to be effective or scary. But it's a drop of brilliance in a sea of monotony and mediocrity, and one I don't feel like swimming in again. The scenes of Asami torturing Shigeharu aren't disturbing at all, and actually feel drawn out (like the rest of the movie!). I was relieved when the movie was over, but also mourning over the knowledge that I will never get back those 115 minutes.

Perhaps I'm slow and ignorant, as I'm sure many reviewers will pin on me, but I've seen a lot of movies over the years and this one doesn't come close to being a quality film. Had it been shorter and equipped with a bit more excitement, it probably would have turned out to be much more effective and compelling. Modern horror is thriving quite well, despite what many critics like to tell the world, but this film doesn't exemplify that. Martyrs, The Descent, Let the Right One In, A Tale of Two Sisters (actual quality Asian horror cinema) The Others, and even the Saw movies (which contain good plots and themes, despite them being the favorite whipping boys of critics for content that doesn't even exist in the series) are all far better and more compelling examples of good modern horror movies, and beat out Audition any day of the week.",1268092800,12,3365,4.558677685950413

1626218,5,B00005MKXB,"Opera is an aging art form, as Met Opera honcho Peter Gelb points out to the successful candidates for the 2007 National Council Finals. And yet, in this riveting documentary, nearly a dozen men and women, most of whom are under the age of 30, have committed their lives to singing repertoire that is deeply out of fashion with most of their peers. And they do it -- peerlessly. It's a glimpse behind the scenes, literally, to the years of training that they have undergone and the 10 minutes or so they will have on stage that will make them or (possibly) break them. There's an African American from Texas, who's had the bailiffs show up at his door; an Icelandic singer who's a star at home and wants an international career; and a guy from New Jersey, whose ambition radiates from him with the same manic intensity that his voice projects audibly. (As one judge later says, he'll either be great, or he'll be dead.) The music never overwhelms the characters (or vice versa) and the viewer is treated to lots of insight into what makes a good opera singer better, from breathing to dramatic technique. Then there's the competition... It's impossible not to root for your favorite singers in this. Watching this has convinced me to buy a ticket to the 'real thing' this year.

1626221,4,B00005MKXB,"In my mind, Asian cinema comes up with some of the best movies you can possibly see. Unlike a lot of American cinema, Asians typically come up with extremely original and thought provoking works of art from gangster movies like Infernal Affairs, to revenge flicks like Oldboy, and even monster movies like The Host. One of the best Asian filmmakers to come out in recent years is Takashi Miike. From Ichi the Killer to the original version of One Missed Call, Takashi Miike has always been a filmmaker that helped to represent excellence. With Odishon, or Audition in English, Miike (pronounced Me-ay-kay) crafted a modern horror masterpiece that even American metal and movie horror-master Rob Zombie said messed him up when he first saw it.

Audition is the story of Japanese film producer Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi). Seven years after his wife dies, Aoyama decides to find himself a new wife after the urging of his son Shigehiko Aoyama (Tetsu Sawaki). After talking to a colleague that he plans to find a new wife, his colleague comes up with the idea of holding an audition for a movie that would serve for casting the lead female role in a new movie and finding Aoyama a wife. While reviewing the candidates for the audition Aoyama comes across the profile and resume of Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina) and is struck by her picture and her life story. At the actual audition he has eyes for none of the other girls besides Asami, and when the audition is over he can hardly wait to call her. His colleague has misgivings about the girl, and despite his warnings Aoyama starts a relationship anyway.

Audition starts off slow going, building up characters and relationships rather than just jumping into the horror like most American films will do. This actually really helps the horror, you actually feel for the characters so when you find them in horrific situations you truly feel the horror of what they're going through. While the movie takes a little bit of time to pick up, when it does hit, it hits hard and doesn't let go, and leaves you with that, ""WTF?!"" feeling.

The acting in this movie is superb. The movie mainly follows the building relationship of Aoyama and Asami, and they play their characters deftly. Sawaki plays Aoyama as a businessman having been seven years out of the game becomes obsessed with a girl whom he thinks is perfect for him. Likable, not quite sure of the moral implications of the ""audition"", and a good father who's just lonely, Sawaki plays a character with many layers and makes the audience feel all of them. Shiina, playing Asami, plays a woman that you feel sorry for and you constantly wonder what really lies beneath the surface. Slightly creepy, damaged, and also very lonely, Shiina shows that something always lies deeper in her character while not always letting the audience into what it is.

I highly recommend this movie, but it's not for everyone, it's not in English so you will have to watch it with subtitles. Also there are some very graphic torture scenes that will last in your memory. For those of you who don't mind, or enjoy that type of thing though, you will be rewarded!

I was starting to fall asleep at one point; only the hot laptop on my lap kept me awake (I watched the movie over my laptop through Netflix).  It's only in the last 20 min. or so that the movie picks up and becomes more intriguing and creepy.  I think I would have liked it more if the creep factor had come into play a little sooner.  However, I liked the actors and I thought overall it was a good movie.  I probably wouldn't recommend it to most people because of the brief torture scene.  It didn't bother me that much but I realize a lot of people get pretty freaked out by scenes like that.

Joking with a friend over drinks, they decide to hold an audition.  From the women who audition, he will select a woman to date.  And he finds the perfect woman, but she is obviously not who she says she is.  Some crazy scenes ensue, time lapses, and mysteries abound as we watch their relationship.

1626229,4,B00005MKXB,"The less you know about this movie going in the better experience you will have. As stated by the director on the DVD introduction, Audition is really slow for the first hour on purpose. It gives you a false sense of security. The tension really builds in the last 45 minutes and there are a few scary moments. One actually happens quite early, where we see the girl waiting for a phone call and something on the floor suddenly moves. Has she been staring at the phone like that for days? I get shivers just thinking about it. The acting by both Ryo Ishibashi (very likeable) and Eihi Shiiina (angelic and creepy at the same time) are excellent. The characters they play are on two different ends of the spectrum, but without properly casting these lead roles, the movie wouldn't have any legs to stand on. After reading some reviews by both critics, Quentin Tarantino (claims this is one of his favorite films) and the casual movie fan before I decided to rent this, I expected to be covering my eyes in disgust, or simply turning off the TV to avoid the horror and watch it the next day. That wasn't the case. Sure there are some disturbing images, but most of the gore is off-screen, save for one gross bit towards the end. It's what you don't see that gets inside your head and does all the dirty work. If you liked the original Japanese versions of The Ring or The Grudge, be warned this is far more brutal than those, but if Oldboy was your sort of thing, Audition should be right up your alley.

1626230,5,B00005MKXB,"I was concerned when the Lion's Gate Uncut Special Edition of this movie went out of print a year or so ago, but this year we're treated to a fantastic-looking 2-disc release of one of Miike's premier movies ... surprisingly, from the folks at Shout Factory (who've also released the original ""The Stepfather"" this month).  This movie takes some patience to watch, but Miike, working from a script by Daisuke Tengan, has the story unfold in richly developed stages, starting with a lonely man, Aoyama, and his son, then gently exploring the nascent relationship Aoyama has with the beautiful and seemingly sweet Asami.  About halfway into the movie, however, the dreamy love story turns into a nightmare, with the heretofore linear narrative bending and breaking, bludgeoning the viewer with illusions, flashbacks, and warped color pallets, all capped by a crescendo of violence and brutality that hits even harder due to its simplicity and the mutual downfall of characters we've grown to know and really care about.

Shout Factory's presentation is the uncut, 115-minute version, with Japanese language and English subtitles.  Thankfully, the DVD goes straight to the film menu when played, sparing the viewer the endless barrage of previews that most DVD release companies insist on including, and when the movie is played, all we have to contend with is a brief 1:18 minute introduction from both Takashi Miike, who comes across as charmingly uneasy on the other side of the camera, and Eihi Shiina, who plays Asami.  The first disc features an audio commentary from Miike as well as screenwriter Tengan.  While Miike typically receives the majority of the praise given to his movies, as the screenwriter Tengan deserves much of the credit as well, so it's good to see him involved in the commentary.  The second disc features an additional 90 minutes of new interviews with cast members and two trailers.

Aside from the top-notch DVD presentation, Shout Factory has done a fantastic job of packaging this movie as well.  The insert booklet features an incisive essay by Tom Mes, who seems to be a Miike scholar, and the essay easily enriches the movie by pithily investigating and analyzing a number of the themes contained there, offering a particularly intelligent reassessment of the violence of the movie and what it could represent.  The essay booklet, along with the 2 DVDs, is packaged in a standard-size clear 2-disc case with attractive double-sided artwork, and this in turn is housed in a slipcase that replicates the DVD cover art.  The devotion and attention given to the packaging as well as the DVD content certainly befits this movie, which seems to get better every time I watch it.

I love horror movies, love creepy twisted films, and I can even appreciate and enjoy gore. I loved Rob Zombie's movies, for instance, and enjoyed abusing myself by watching Hostel. So I was really looking forward to seeing this film.

Unfortunately, it was awful. The worst 115 minutes ever. The entire first part (i.e., practically the whole movie) dragged on and on and on. One guy wants a wife, his friend concocts this ridiculous scheme to find him one, and then the guy gets to know the girl he's fallen in love with. But there's not one single remarkable thing about the characters. There's very little foreshadowing of what lies at the end, besides some random sack that moves during one brief scene, leaving you thinking ""What the heck is that about?"" rather than being creeped out. Aside from that, the movie just drones on and on and on. The only reason I stayed with it was because surely the last scene must be incredible, making it well-worth the wait. Right?

Wrong. The sole reason for the last scene was to attempt to shock you beyond anything you've ever seen in a movie before. It failed miserably. I will give it that it was a bit surprising at first. And the way she says ""deeper, deeper"" was kinda creepy. But that's it. It was otherwise just gross, with the gore quickly getting redundant. Oh, it's not that I just don't like gore- no, as I mentioned, I enjoyed watching Hostel- it was scary and done gruesomely right. Audition just fails in a way that most horror movies, even bad ones, do not.

It's been a while since I've seen this movie, but I don't think they actually show much of the blood and gore during the last 15 minutes.

1626246,4,B00005MKXB,"With all the praise, I expected so much from Takashi Miike's breakout movie.  More psychological thriller than horror, I was impressed and disturbed at the same time by Audition.  Technically and creatively it is beautiful, but I've never been more pleased and disappointed by one movie.

According to Miike's commentary, the heart of Audition is about family, about discovering what makes a person function by examining the relationships that define their home-life.  Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) is a Japanese Average Joe grieving his recently deceased wife.  Aoyama bottles up his pain and loneliness, instead devoting himself to his son.  Fast forward seven years into stability and a great father-son bond, and his son recommends that his father remarry.

With a casting director connection, Yasuhisa Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura - the guy who got his head lopped off in Kill Bill), a plan is devised to find Aoyama's new woman through a fake audition.  Before seeing the pool of applicants, the two men remark societal changes, the dwindling pool of traditionally subservient women who are ""beautiful, classy and obedient"".  After reviewing several candidates, however, Aoyama sets his eyes on Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina), a pretty but haunted women whose previous aspirations to be a ballet dancer were crushed by an injury.

Immediately the two find a connection and dependency through loneliness.  As intimacy increases, more of Asami's former life becomes suspect.  She's incredibly sweet and demure, but the buildup progresses slowly enough that uneasiness develops amidst the foreshadowing and hints Aoyama ignores.  Too bad for Aoyama.

The first 60 minutes slowly persuade viewers into forming their own mental endings, and then Miike, through his own admission, hoped that the twist would be a ""psychological betrayal"" leaving viewers shocked.  Without going into the details of the gruesome ending, let me just say that I plan on buying a home alarm; I'll probably never go an acupuncturist; I'll always sniff my drinks before taking a gulp; and I'll always be haunted by a single Japanese word.

Ishibashi is superb as the depressed Aoyama, but Shiina absolutely blew me away.  Per portrayal of a troubled psychopath is bloodcurdling.  Her ability to display either apathy or glee towards what would normally elicit nausea was brilliant.

Both strength and weakness, the buildup for the final scene is difficult in two ways.  One, it's excruciatingly long.  It's probably the primary reason why this film is so polarizing.  For over an hour, the movie drags so much that the characters' pure ennui causes boredom by proxy.  On the other hand, the buildup is difficult because it allows a viewer to relate and empathize with Aoyama, to trust the rising sanguinity, making the jaw-dropping 180 so much more powerful.  It's not just a gut-punch; it's a gut-punch from your father.  It's completely unpredictable, and the surreal nature adds to the nauseous shock.

Once again, I'm pleased and disappointed.  The beginning is agonizing; but, then again, that's what made me so susceptible to the surprise.  Off-hand, I can't think of a movie that has made such a lasting impression.",1241568000,2,3195,5.2362204724409445
1626247,3,B00005MKXB,"Shigeharu Aoyama is a widower. Even with a son that he loves and the complacency for the life that he lives, he is still a lonely man. He wants to be in a loving relationship once again. Thanks to his job as a movie/television producer and a crazy kooky plan from his friend, he decides to hold a fake audition for a show. The casting call that the women will be on for the show is actually more like window shopping for Shigeharu to find a new girl. While looking through resumes and portfolios of the women that will `trying out for the part', he comes across a pretty girl by the name of Asami Yamazaki who he intends to keep an eye for. During the casting call, most of the women just don't cut it for Shigeharu, until Asami sits down in the lone chair across from the two producers. Shigeharu is immediately attracted to her and decides to save her phone number to ring her up later. When he finally does call, he asks her out to dinner and they begin to hit it off. He tells her he'll call her again, but he doesn't right away because he doesn't want to seem desperate. And while he waits, so does Asami, literally. Asami sits uncomfortably looking, head hung low with her long black hair draped over her face, waiting for her rotary black phone to ring. The black phone that is sitting next to the brown potato sack. When the phone rings for the second date, and the smile that eerily forms on Asami's face, we then begin to find out more about Asami's past. She has been abused by every man that she's been in contact with and all she wants now is to be loved by 100% of someone's heart and nothing less.

Audition is definitely one of those movies where at the end you will be saying ""What the heck did I just watch?"" And I say that in a good way. The first time I saw this, I was completely blown away by the ending. I did not see it coming at all. Well, not to the extent of what happened at least. But it left me confused because it seemed like it took too much of a dramatic turn of events. The second time having seen it, I think it was a lot better than I remembered. Though it still left me a little confused. Sure I get she was abused by all the men that should have loved her and treated her like a princess, but I honestly just didn't care for the ending that we saw (even though it was pretty awesome when it comes to being screwed up..hehe). I could understand why some of it would happen, but not the extreme situation of what we saw.  Maybe it was so extreme though because no matter how much anyone loves Asami, she'll never trust that love because of how screwed up she is now thanks to her childhood. And that's how Miike wanted to prove it to you. I really don't know.

While I do like the movie, I would recommend this to only fans of this type of genre. It is a thought provoking movie, but it can be a tad to slow for some. When the end hits you in the face like bean bag from a shotgun, you're going to be doing one of two things. Saying ""That was awesome"" or ""That was dumb"". I'm only giving this a 3 stars (even though it's more like a 3.5) instead of a 4, because no matter how much I like the first 3/4ths' of the movie, the weird ending just kind of throws it off for me. Not the extreme part of the ending, but the little weird montage scenes.

1626248,5,B00005MKXB,"REVIEW: What appears to be a well-acted drama about a Japanese widower seeking a new wife: nose dives headfirst into a superb yet gruelling thriller on a par with ""PSYCHO"", ""REPULSION"", and ""FATAL ATTRACTION"". Famed director Miike is no stranger to subtlety, but the restraint he shows in the first half of the film (as he carefully builds up the seemingly normal chain of events surrounding his protagonist, T.V. producer Aoyama, and his ""auditioning"" a new wife in conjunction with his friend's latest project) pays off brilliantly by the film's end as we come to find out that Aoyama's ideal mate (a beautiful yet demur mystery woman named Asami - wonderfully played by actress Shiina) may not have been the best choice for a lifetime companion! The surreal quality of the final hour is deliberately hallucinatory as the revelations that confront the audience may just very well be the subconscious depiction of Aoyama's fear of re-marrying and the guilt he feels in ""betraying"" his love for his dead wife (the continual pleading of the Asami character to ""love only me"" could certainly be a reflection of Aoyama's own sense of loyalty and fidelity). It is interesting that all of the more ""nightmarish"" segments of the film occur after Aoyama is shown to be drifting off to sleep (and after making love to Asami for the first time). Add to that the sharp psychological portraits of these two people and how they mirror each other's emotional pain: and you have a Japanese version of Ingmar Bergman's classic ""PERSONA"" which dealt with a similar situation whereby two people act out their innermost turmoil against a surrealistic backdrop of film exposures. But apart from the final half hour: the most striking thing about ""AUDITION"" is the pall of loneliness that hangs over the film (one character even makes the comment that ""all of Japan is lonely""). And so loneliness is the main theme of the story: whether it is depicted as Aoyoma sitting quietly alone at the dinner table, or Asami staring at the telephone in a bare room (well, ALMOST bare: except for the oversized burlap bag which she keeps close by...). The whole film reeks of terrible pain, tragedy, and grief. As usual with a Miike film: it is the sexual violence that is more disturbing by far (though here it is kept to a peripheral minimum) while the various horrific things that one character does will certainly make you hurl your lunch (if you've already seen the film: then no pun intended!). But again I wish to stress the emotional and psychological horror of the film which is the true core of its message, and which can also be read as a treatise against the undercurrent of male chauvinism strikingly prevelant not only in Japanese culture: but in every culture. The women who are abused, neglected, ignored, and treated with indifference or in a politely condescending tone are shown at the end of the story to be not only scarred in various ways, but also to be victims and human beings struggling against the damaging effects of such a male-dominated social structure. But aside from its philosophical and spritual implications: ""AUDITION"" will be forever known as the flick that garnered a record number of walk outs when it was screened at the Rotterdam Film Festival. So be forewarned: you know that when a film director gives such advice (in the DVD special feature ""Director Introduction"") as ""If you feel sick, pause the movie. Watch the rest of it tomorrow."" that you are in for a heap of gut-wrenching trouble. For certain: Hitchcock would have been pleased.",1234742400,2,3550,4.85973597359736
1626249,5,B00005MKXB,"The genius of this movie is that it sneaks up on you.  The whole thing is simply a set-up to get you to think the way they want you to about the characters, so that when they change it is subtle.  The characters are realistic, so not particularly outrageous or interesting.  The whole thing is very 'romantic drama' with a bunch of people that seem to have no twist to them at all.  Even though I knew that the girl is a psycho killer (just look at the cover) I found myself viewing her as some normal sweet little Japanese girl.  After the first time I saw her do something horrific in the movie (I won't spoil it for you) I quickly went back to thinking of her as the sweet innocent girl.  When that happened, I realized that the film makers were really getting inside the heads of the audience.  It works.  It's not gory or overly violent, but creepy.  If you want lots of blood and big creatures jumping out at you, or people that get shot 30 times before they die, watch something else.  If you want real creepy, psychological horror, watch The Audition.",1233187200,2,1059,4.32994923857868

1626251,3,B00005MKXB,"The movie is executed generally quite well. It really nails ""creepy"" in a very constructive way. The acting is quite good, and the build-up of the plot is certainly worth the wait -- though you need to be at least 45 minutes in before you realize you're watching a horror film.

Unfortunately, the most controversial part of the movie, the gruesome and sadistic climax near the end, almost ruins the entire work. The movie was excellently executing a psychological terror/horror flick. And even with implied blood and gore, and a little look here and there, it still worked. It's this narrow balance between the implicitness of psychological terror and explicitness of physical violence that provides great tension in these kinds of stories. Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" worked so well because it didn't have to show you everything and wallow in it.

But that's precisely where this movie comes apart, because suddenly Miike seems compelled to show you everything and wallow in it. And with that, the movie's psychological terror gets lost. In a scene that could have made the movie twice as powerful by cutting the scene to a tenth of its length, we're suddenly watching a different movie made by a different director with different purposes for a different audience. I felt like how an action flick junkie must feel when the director insists on shoehorning a love scene in the plot just to appeal to the non-core audience of the film.

And with that, Miike scored big points with squeamish teenagers wanting to hold hands -- and lost massive points with me... and with what he had spent the prior 90 minutes delicately building. As a result, the climax is a cowardly cop-out for a movie that had no need for its brief but bizarre moment of self-indulgent excesses.

It's all not a total loss, however. There's enough redeeming parts of the film that make it still worth watching. But this is one movie where the Directors Cut should really be just that: more cut, and less ""more"". At least when it comes to the film reel. Unfortunately, that will never happen, because it seems all of the talk about this film is based more on its worst scene than on the other redeeming 105 minutes.",1231027200,2,2177,4.781914893617022

1626266,4,B00005MKXB,"The methodic build of suspense to a terrifying conclusion is a rare art in horror films, and none so cunningly employs this tactic than Takashi Miike's Audition. At first giving the appearance of a romantic comedy, Miike's deliberately paced facade vanishes in the blink of a pierced eyelid and concludes with perhaps the most agonizingly vivid torture scene ever filmed.

The movie has a deceptively lighthearted premise and is even rather charming to begin with. An aging father whose wife passed away some time ago is urged by his friends and his son to try dating again. Shigeharu (Ryo Ishibashi) agrees to participate in a fake audition staged by a filmmaker friend in order to interview potential candidates to be his new wife. Despite his friend's objections, Shigeharu chooses Asami (Eihi Shiina), a young former ballerina whose past is shrouded in mystery. After several dates Asami seems like the perfect match for the aging bachelor, but upon his decision to propose to the timid girl, things quickly spiral out of control into a hellish nightmare he cannot escape.

While gore is no stranger to Audition, Miike's most effective strategy lies within his deceitful manipulation of reality. Flashbacks, ghostly imagery, and dream sequences betray possible truths and horrifying realities, and the unpredictability of these scenes offers more wrenching anticipation and unnerving apprehension of just how harrowing Shigeharu and Asami's situation will become. The sadistic climax proposes an illusory avenue of escape, one so craftily devised it has often been copied, but never equaled.

Certainly not for the squeamish, Audition does commendably incite thrills for its genuine creepiness and the nerve-shattering fusion of conflicting genres. This early work from Miike is a true test of backbone for even the most jaded gorehound and cleverly mocks the traditional tactics of western horror films. Dare to see the unrated version for the full, uncut (and most unforgiving) torture scene.

If there ever was a movie that I would no doubt say is one of the best movies ever if I was asked this would be it, in fact I would say that this is in the top 10. To those who have yet to see this film know now that you are in for a ride that you will never forget. J-Horror has become a very popular thing here in the states lately but let me say that these American remakes are nothing compared to the real deal productions from Asia. If America ever tries to remake this I may boycott what ever studio is doing it, I like this film that much. Also let me say J-Horror, K-Horror and any kind of name for a horror film from a country not your own is ridicules, I do not hear anyone here in America calling American horror films A-Horror so why can't it all be .............. HORROR. With that being said [been waiting to get that out] ""Audition"" is one of those films that just sneaks up on you, in fact if you have never seen this stop reading now and put it in, surprise awaits you.

Shigeharu Aoyama played masterfully by Ryo Ishibashi is a very lonely man looking to get back out there after coming to terms with his wife's death. His best friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa [Jun Kunimura] convinces him that having an audition for a film would be the best way to meet some women and learn a little about them. Aoyama who only has the company of his son who obviously has more to do then hang with his father eventually agrees and off the two go. It is in these interviews that a beautiful young woman named Asami Yamazaki [Eihi Shiina] walks into the room and into Aoyama life. Little did Yoshikawa know that his friend had already chosen this girl long before she auditioned. The two hit it off or so it seems because both are unsure about the other and wait for the other to make a move or call. A relationship starts to blossom despite warnings from Yoshikawa and a good movie is well on its way.

Or at least one would think so if they only made it that far, because other then a scene involving Asami and a bag in the back ground this seems more like a romantic comedy [see the scene were the two friends are talking at a bar, and the audition scenes] then a horror film. To be honest, even though it seems that way it actually was working as such and would have been just as good staying that way [did that make sense], but man that throws you off for what is to come. The last 20 to 30 minutes of this film are some of the hardest things to sit threw and watch, honestly it really is. I think because the film built it's self up and seemed like such a different film, the last part of this film is heightened and these scenes seem a lot harder to view because of that. If I could describe what happens in this film to you in these written words I would. But the atmosphere and emotion add so much to the scenes that it is pretty much impossible to really convey to you how powerful they are. I hope I am not hyping these scenes up to a point that will eventually disappoint you, but I really feel that this film is a classic. Also i won't give away what happens here because you must see them for your self, trust me.

Ryo Ishibashi plays the role of the lonely single father very well and is more then believable as such, in fact he is so good at it that you actually feel horrible about what happens to his character [even though you learn a few bad things about him]. Ryo has a certain boyish charm about his character that shines threw the screen and really plays it well with the female characters. Jun Kunimura who plays his best friend is just as good as the confident yet distrusting best friend, his character actually calls out the female leads shaky background to Ryo. His character is a successful and some what cocky guy who comes up with the plan for his friend to meet women, he was very right about the girl. Speaking of which Eihi Shiina is downright evil in this film and portrays her self very differently so well throughout the first 3rd of the film. Her performance is hauntingly brilliant as it is so believable and really every guys worst fear about women, which is what this film is all about. She is at times a sweet and innocent girl and a strong but giving woman at another, but towards the end she is extremely warped and sick. The thing that makes her performance so good is that she slips in and out of all these emotions of the character with such ease that you think she is really like that, she is that character. Another thing about her performance is that during those horrific torture scenes when you look into her eyes there is no emotion there, I mean the character has no emotion not the actress.

Director Takashi Miike helmed in my opinion one of the greatest films ever made regardless of what country this film was made in, like I said this is not J-Horror or A-Horror it is straight up horror. Although one could argue that Miike did not create a horror film in that he really crafted a human study and hardcore tension film. Of course screenwriter Daisuke Tengan must get some credit as he pinned this wonderful film from a great novel by Ry Murakami. Both the book and the screenplay are wonderful works of art, man I hope I am not over doing this review with praise. But with that said I can't find anything wrong with this film, some say it is slow but I think the pace is the perfect build for the last 3rd of the film. But all of the film before that is a wonderful film in its own right and really deserves that credit, plus it is the perfect build for the end.

I hope that I did not over do this film with praise or hyped it so much that you will go in with expectations that could never be matched but I really believe this film is worth your time. Ask almost any one [a few poor souls actually don't get this film] who has seen this film what they think about it and I bet they say it was great. Some people I know will never watch it again because of the last part of this film in. I have to give a shout out to WP for getting me to watch this again and review it.

This was a good movie; don't misunderstand that.  It was interesting and curious, well acted and all that; In that respect, I enjoyed it.  However, I was let down in that it is not, NOT the graphically violent film that you might have been lead to believe it is.  Yes, there is some violence, and it is a bit intense, but really only a bit; nothing more than you might see in any other 'horror' or 'thriller' type movie out there.  You expect it.  But this movie shouldn't be made out to be one of those movies.  It isn't senselessly violent; its about realistic situations and people.  While it escalates to an extreme point in the end, I wouldn't suggest going into this movie with the intent of seeing a ""violent movie"".

The first review I read about this told me to ""stop reading here and just watch"".  I think I should have; I suggest the same to you.

It is certainly not a horror film, but a messed up love story disguised as a thriller. There really is no air of suspense, no jumps of any kind, and it makes no sense. The supposedly infamous torture scene is very boring and again, very mild, unless you are afraid of needles...

I realise that violence and gore do not necessarily make a movie. Obviously, it is the case with great films like the Sixth Sense and The Others. However, Audition has nothing at all to offer. The story line is confusing, jumpy as hell and the end leaves you feeling absolultely nothing. The entire thing feels like a waste.

The last part of the movie does get confusing, what with different characters and scenes getting jumbled together and conversations changing.  The director's commentary clarifies some things as he explains what he was trying to communicate with a particular scene or with a character's actions.  Not all questions are answered though, but enough to make the movie a richer experience (as opposed to an ""ok, what exactly happened here?"" experience).  Even the ""kiri kiri kiri kiri"" words spoken by Asami are given some additional explanation by Miike that, to me, makes them all the more creepier.",1213833600,,758,5.138211382113822

Reluctantly, our hero finally agrees.

Our hero meets a very shy, soft spoken women...wearing all white...that he is attracted to.  His friend doesn't think she is the right type of women for him but he decides to ask her for a date anyway and she accepts.

The rest of the movie is them finding out about each other.  Basically, he is a widower that is feeling guilty about dating again and dreams that his new ""dream girl"" has a few, let's say, issues.

The movie starts real slow, like 80 minutes of setup, but I'm thinking, That's cool, he's just making us feel comfortable before he hits us with the hammer. But when the hammer fell, I was not awestruck.

The beginning was fine and the ending was fine, but right before the torture starts there's one of the strangest montages in cinema history. It's like a flashback, but it includes things we never saw before. We don't know if this is a flashback, a dream or something else entirely. And the sequence ends with the worst horror gag of all time, the fake it-was-all-a-dream awakening, before going right back to where you started.

The horror film genre is considered to be one of the greatest, bestselling markets of all time, but no one--and I mean no one--can even come close to the Asian horror film genre. The Ring--a bestselling movie in America--was based off of the Japanese movie Ringu. Bet you didn't know that, huh?

Audition starts out simply enough. It shows Shigeharu Aoyama--our leading man-- grieving for his wife, while often thinking about what it would be like to remarry. When his son suggests to remarry, our main character decides to hold an audition. Now, this isn't a normal audition; it's fake, set-up, and is supposed to turn out a woman that Shigeharu will fall in love with.

So, the audition turns out good. Shigeharu goes through the rsums of all the women that came out for the audition, thirty in total. One woman's face seems to pop out at him. Asami Yamazaki is a pretty girl who liked to dance before she destroyed her hip in an accident, and she`s the woman that Shigeharu wants to get to know.

What Shingeharu doesn't know is that Asami has a dark past, and that past continues to haunt her...

To the core.

Audition is a fine example of how foreign films can do well to an American audience. Modern-day America wants movies that they can be able to watch without having to read subtitles. (Americans read only one book a year, mind you; and some don't even read that. Why read subtitles on a foreign film when you can watch an American film?) Audition is stunning, horribly disturbing, and downright creepy. Any and all fans of horror must watch this movie.

No seriously, someone try this.  I want reactions.

Anyways, now that I have that out of my system:  Unfortunately, I kinda knew what to expect when going into 'Audition,' but WOW, it is still a stroke of genius in its execution.  Don't let anyone tell you this movie is worthless because 3/4 of the story is 'boring.'  No, it's not /boring,/ it is an elaborate setup geared towards those watching the movie with /no prior knowledge of it./  (Which, unfortunately now, loses its punch at the expense of becoming a staple Japanese horror classic)  Furthermore, it's an engaging story with a fairly likable and sympathetic and middle-aged male lead, something you don't see all the time in horror movies which are usually riddled with angst-ridden teenagers and prom queens.  Right.

If you're a shock/gorefest horror fan looking for instant gratification, this film probably isn't up your ally... but I would still recommend it for its unforgettable payoff.  Miike Takashi spends over an hour setting the audience up slowly, slowly, easing them into a sense of discomfort as the true nature of the story rears its ugly head and suddenly unleashes itself full force.  The acting is also amazing.  As I stated, the main lead is a hapless middle-aged man, Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), living as a widowed father.  He has good intentions, but really wants to discover love again and as quickly as possible.  In his haste, he and his friend in film producing business devise a scheme to 'audition' a large group of attractive females; one for the lead heroine role in a movie, and one to take the role of his wife.

Cue the subtle, soft-spoken, polite, and submissive Asami (Eihi Shiina).  She is everything he thinks he is looking for in a wife, and possibly more... but as they start seeing each other exclusively, she becomes seemingly as drawn to him as he is to her, possibly even more so.  Aoyama, however, soon discovers that there is little he or anyone else knows about Asami... and when she disappears, leaving him stranded alone in a hotel bedroom, he goes on a frantic search to find her and uncover her secrets, which leads to a fast and furious downward spiral into insanity, where the line between reality and dark fantasy blur.

'Audition' won't feel like a horror movie until you really sink your teeth into it.  This isn't a movie one can 'sample' or listen to as background noise, but rather, the type of movie one needs to invest in to appreciate, and pick up all the subtleties in the storytelling that eventually become relevant.  Trust me, it's well worth it.",1200096000,2,2872,4.698
1626295,5,B00005MKXB,"A Japanese movie producer, Aoyama, widowed and starting to feel lonely as he heads into middle age and his son grows up, concocts a scheme with a friend and fellow producer to snag himself a romantic partner.

The actress Aoyama ends up falling for is a girl named Asami (the beautiful Eihi Shiina), who he indeed does end up getting involved with.  It starts off with a comedy-sounding plot, then seems to be developing into a sweet, though at times rather tense, romantic drama.  Except for those little moments that crop up suggesting something is...off...and then making it apparant that there's something far more than just 'off' or unusual taking place.

  ""Audition"" evolves into one of the scariest and most sinister horror movies to ever creep up on you, a wonderful, twisted treat that might have you wanting to burrow under the cushions to safety, as Aoyama begins to have questions about this new woman in his life, and if she might have secrets unknown to him.  Spectacularly well-made and jarringly realistic, superbly acted (with its two leads especially deserving of praise), it's often a quiet movie - literally, not metaphorically, as some parts of the film are similar to the almost-silent-movie air of much of director Takashi Miike's 'Box' segment in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-Extremes/dp/B000CRR3ME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3 Extremes</a>.

1626297,4,B00005MKXB,"I hesitated for a while before viewing this movie. Usually movies that get such high ratings I find aren't all that. But this one was.
I won't go over the plot, it's been done here in many other reviews.
What I liked about the movie was that it took time to build up the main characters. Some say it was slow, maybe so. But the story that lead up to what happened wasn't your typical slasher flick.
These people have a character, they are fleshed out very well here. You are drawn to them as people first throughout the movie.
When the blood does begin to spill, I felt more than just fear. I actually felt sorry. Mostly for the girl. It shows her life, through flashbacks, and how horrible it became until she finally snaps.
About the flashbacks.... it got to be confusing because there were times it was hard to tell which was present day and which was in the past. And that was all I didn't like about the movie.
The slashing that takes place is purposeful, also. I know that sounds a bit sick. But the female lead character has reasons for each dismemberment that she does! Although she is a sick person, she delivers each wound with thought that goes way back in her history. She is deliberate at the time she is chopping. I found that a little different from most other shasher flicks.
This movie is indeed chilling because the characters are given such a full expression and personality. It is easy to see that when one starts a dance with this femme fatale, that it ends up fatal!
I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a bit more than just mindless and gratuitous chopping.",1193788800,,1592,4.418367346938775

His mate gets the idea of having an audition of women under the pretence that its for a tv production (That way they will never know and he can look at his leasure and 'choose the best' so to speak)  So there the poor chap is when bingo! He sees her.  Quiet, modest and shy just what he is looking for.  He begins to take her out first to get to know her then later as he slowly starts to fall in love with her.

Slowly but surely he begins to find that hsi little perfect find has a little bit of how shall I say cough cough baggage with her.  Abused as a child by some nut case who slashed her with heated knives she has some issues to deal with.

Our hero tracks the guy down (some nut in a weelchair) as he desperately wants to find out more about her (especially after he finally sleeps with her and she disappears the next morning, never a good sign that one)

Anyway he starts to give up and get on with his life when back at his home who should turn up but his little miss perfet to inflict 10 minutes of the most horrific torture on the poor guy you could imagine.

The movie starts out very slowly, building the viewers sympathy for the middle-aged man who has lost his wife and has become smitten with a mysterious 24 year old young woman.  There are foreshadowings early on that something is wrong, but nothing prepares you for the truth.  This film is a cautionary tale to all middle-aged men seeking that young trophy wife.  Be very careful what you wish for.

I own this movie and have watched it several times and I still get VERY uneasy during some of the scenes.  When the lovely girl quietly purrs, ""Stick in!,"" it makes my skin crawl.  Note to prospective viewers:  the young woman is NOT referencing sexual intercourse when she speaks.

If the sight of a young woman vomitting into a dog dish and feeding it to a grossly disfigured starving man she keeps tied up in a burlap bag doesn't appeal to you, then you might not want to eat before you watch this movie.  That is only one of the disgusting scenes in this tale about a lonely man in search of love and a young woman who was abused from her earliest memories by men who used her to satisfy their perverted sadio-masochistic and sexual desires.  The protagonist in the story is cautioned repeatedly by his best friend and even his dead wife who, in dreams, warns him, ""No, not her.  NOT HER.""  Still, he is so bewitched by his newfound love that he ignores the cautionary pleadings and embarks on a brief affair that ends in tragedy.  To the very end, he clings to his fantasy of his young woman as a gentle, loving, creature who wants only to love and be loved by him.

If there is a theme to this movie, it might be to convey that to some extent, we are all actors; hence the name for the movie, ""audition.""  If I were to classify this movie I would place it in the revenge genre.",1189641600,2,1941,4.377094972067039

1626302,4,B00005MKXB,"Takashi Miike's Audition is an extraordinary film.  The first hour of the feature plays like a comedy-melodrama.  It's about a widower, Shigeharu Aoyama, whose son and best friend both recommend he weds.  He concedes that they are right.  He and his friend are movie executives, and his friend decides that in order to find the perfect mate they should hold an audition for a movie that may or may not get made.  In the audition, Aoyama is to choose which girl he would most like to wed.  Before the auditioning process even begins, he has his eyes on a girl named Asami Yamazaki.  After a humorous montage of bizarre auditions, Asami appears, and it is clear that he had already made up his mind when he demonstrates a complete memorization of her application.  His friend feels uneasy about her, and tells Aoyama that she will not be good for him.  Aoyama ignores him, and he begins dating her.  This makes up the first 60-75 minutes of the film.

The first scary sequence comes when Aoyama is sitting by his phone, unsure about whether or not to call Asami.  It cuts to Asami, kneeling down beside the phone, very still, with seemingly nothing to do but wait for the phone call that she know will come.  There is no furniture in her apartment.  Behind her there is a stuffed laundry bag, a bag which provides the first real jolt of the film.  After that scene, there will be no doubt in your mind that there is something very wrong with Asami.

Soon Aoyama loses contact with Asami, which leads him to begin searching for her in all of the few places he can associate her with.  After two very scary sequences, both of which basically tell him that Asami is severely insane, he continues to search.  I won't give away what happens next, but the final fifteen minutes of the two hour film were rated #11 in Bravo's countdown of the 100 Scariest Movie Moments.

I do not like horror movies.  It's not that I'm easily scared, because I like being scared.  It's just that so few horror movies try to do anything original to scare me.  It was the first Halloween movie that ruined the genre, and yet that first Halloween movie was perhaps the scariest film I have ever seen.  The first Halloween movie didn't just come at you with not-stop gore or a million formulaic scares.  It was a closer cousin to Hitchcock than Freddy or Jason.  Audition, while not Hitchcockian, has a slow build.  In fact, if you knew nothing about it prior to viewing, it's an hour before you would even realize that it's a scary movie.  When it does present the extreme gore, it does it quite shockingly and with immense energy.  It doesn't do it with formula in mind.  And because it takes nearly the entire film to get to the fifteen-minute sequence, it is that much scarier when it comes.  If you're as depressed as I am with the current state of horror movies, or even if you're not, this film is a must-see.",1187136000,3,2887,4.485604606525912

That being said, try to judge it for yourself while watching it, as the film takes you on an interesting and deceptive ride that plays on our definitions of film genres and cliche devices. In this respect Miike is not unlike Tarantino.  He is a director who thinks outside of the box and seemed to recognize the potential in expressing himself with this story...and used this wisely to scare the hell out of me.

The story is about a widower who decides to finally begin a search for a new wife at the suggestion of both his son and his movie producer friend. But how will he find his new bride? Well, this man's friend is of course a filmmaker and he decides to hold an audition for this widower, so he can look for an attractive girl with a history in some kind of artistic discipline (i.e. dancing, piano, ballet etc.). Our protagonist possesses a handful of applications and must choose 30 girls to audition for a part in this faux movie. His friend agrees that he must find a girl who is happy to be his wife, and happy women are never good enough actors, so whoever he chooses will convincingly not be acceptable for this fake movie role to being with. However, contrary to his friend's advice our protagonist chooses a girl named Asami, who is profoundly unhappy. She used to be a ballerina but broke her hip and feels that having to quit something she loves can be paralleled to accepted death itself. Asami is not happy but she is an attractive 24 year old girl who has intrigued our hero and he more or less chose her before the audition happens anyway. The film takes a turn as we begin to see some hints as to what kind of person Asami is and all her mysteries are gradually revealed. Trust me when I say there is plenty about Asami to reveal.

Miike gives us a film that comes off as a Romantic Comedy in the first 80 minutes and then slowly transforms into a thriller/mystery kind of film, and then smacks us over the head with it's intense climax and conclusion that is shock, horror, gore and utter madness. Audition could've easily become a one-trick-pony in it's goal to play with our understandings of genres and what to expect, but it actually goes far beyond that and rarely gets credit for doing so. This is a very sharp film on many levels and in many ways. It is smart and surprising.  I highly recommend this film to anyone willing and able to deal with it's violent content. I also see this as a gateway and introduction to Miike's films and other films like his. You shouldn't regret discovering this filmmaker.

I have heard people say this is exploitative but that is likely a judgement on Miike overall, as Audition is one of his few films that really isn't exploitative at all. In fact, in terms of `gore' films Audition is not even close to Ichi the Killer but it should be taken with a warning as it is still very violent and realistic. I don't think this film deserves beyond an R-rating when we take into account the violence portrayed in ""The Passion of the Christ"". The limits have been pushed enough to allow films like Audition wider release in the United States without forcing either an NC-17 or no rating at all.

Its also important to remember this film was not made with the whole world intended as the audience, as director Takashi Miike has mentioned. You need to be patient and give it some time, it is not done in a style which most movies adhere to. Imagery is key to the film.

1626339,5,B00005MKXB,"This is Miike Takashi's magnum opus. Both beautiful and honest.

Audition is a languorous film. It slowly pulls the audience into a lonely widower's world ...

Years after the death of his wife, Shigeharu Aoyama begins seeking a new  companion but to little avail. Both he and his friend lament the disappearance of the traditional Japanese woman: one who is trained in the arts, is demure, and graceful. Aoyama's friend is involved in film-casting and arranges an ""audition"" for Aoyama's potential mate: only the women do not know they are being auditioned for the role of ""girlfriend."" It is here where Aoyama meets his perfect woman . . . or is she?

What is important to know: the film is deliciously slow. It reads like a drama. And, a compelling one at that! Then ... the last twenty minutes are like successive punches to the face. They are ABSOLUTELY shocking ... nearly unbearable! But, if you require immediate gratification, this film is not for you. It is a film about human drama ... the build-up to the grand finale is very long, very deliberate. (And, it is this exact reason why the film is so very startling!!)

The cinematography is gorgeous. The soundtrack is thoughtful. The acting is impeccable. The audience genuinely cares for these characters (even Asumi). And while Aoyama may have approached finding a new love in a dishonest manner, he certainly does not deserve the grotesque, unspeakable, impending violence. Our sympathies lie with him. And, even in the final scene (without giving away ANYTHING!), Miike Takashi explains that Aoyama looks to Asami with forgiveness and tenderness (found in director's commentary).

What is most startling is that Miike Takashi HIMSELF has explained that the young woman who plays Asami Yamazaki is a method actress, so the vomit scene is REAL!! (Listen to the director's commentary for details!!) Just thought you should know;)

This film is a cautionary tale both about the pitfalls of adhering to ""tradition"" at all costs.

1626340,5,B00005MKXB,"`Audition', directed by the very accomplished Japanese director, Takashi Miike is an exceptionally good horror movie, which more than makes up for all those dreadful `Godzilla' hack jobs from Japan. It is no surprise whatsoever that it came in at number 11 in Bravo's top 100 scariest horror movies, beaten out by only the cream of the crop like `Carrie', `The Exorcist', `The Shining', `Alien', and `Jaws'.

It's noteworthy that unlike all but `Jaws', these horror leaders all rely on some kind of supernatural agent or ability, even those penned by Stephen King, the master of eliciting horror from the ordinary. `Audition' begins with the most ordinary of premises, a lonely man who is still recovering from the death of his wife seven years ago. The story also happens to use the conceit of a movie within a movie, as the principle male character, the lonely man, is a film director, who hits upon the device of an audition for a fictional film to locate a suitable young woman with whom he can form a romantic relation.

As the director freely admits, the first half of the movie goes very slowly, giving practically no hint of the menace to come. This may be the film's one weakness, as in all the other films mentioned above, the buildup of anticipation is steady, with especial skill applied to ratching up the tension in carefully metered scenes. In `Audition', the premonition of terror hits you like a sledgehammer about half way through the movie. From then on, the only flaw in the suspense is the ambiguity in whether the scenes are real or dream. This is especially true since in other films, Miike has build the entire story within dreams, a fact revealed only at the very end of the film.

Almost all the film's weaknesses fall away when we reach the climactic scene, and we get a taste of horror that puts scenes such as those in the `Saw' flicks to shame. Aside from the originality, the scene gains much from the length of the scene. There is no quick and done tummy burst or gym firestorm here. The scene goes on and on and on, and from lead-in events, one has the unpleasant experience of knowing what's coming, and you know the victim can do nothing about it, and does not know what's coming.

The movie may be imperfect, but it is a paradigm of how to do really good `naturalistic' horror scenes without the need of a 24-foot shark named `Bruce'. One can hope that Mr. Miike will perfect his craft and we will see more pants wetting works like this one.",1173398400,,2477,4.597285067873303
1626341,4,B00005MKXB,"`Audition' isn't your typical horror movie, but like Japanese fashion, the movie gives a lot of detail and may be confusing to some people who aren't used to dream sequences explaining some of the story. I was overall impressed with the pacing and style of the movie, but I was a little disappointed to learn that one of my favorite parts of the movie wasn't in the original novel this movie was based on. Credit goes to Miike, the director, for the new ideas that were added to the story in this movie because the scenes that Miike added were probably the best parts. The biggest complaint I have of the movie is that the cameraman in some scenes couldn't keep the camera steady and it is shaky in a few parts. Nothing major, but it is enough to notice the picture not being steady.

The special features for the DVD are a great addition and answer some questions about the movie, mainly when they interview the author of the novel. I don't know if this could be considered a horror movie, it is definitely more of a suspense story. The author of the novel, Ryu, himself said that this isn't a ghost story or about a maniac with a knife, but more about the dark side of the human heart. It's not until the last few minutes of the movie when things get really bad, most of the time it is like a normal love story with a twist. If you like thriller suspense stories like ""Psycho"" that deal with the outcome from years of abuse, then you will like this movie. But, if you want a slasher that goes for the throat, this isn't for you because this story builds up to the moment instead of going straight for the jugular. Remember, the movie isn't what I'd call ""scary"", but more disturbing than anything else and it doesn't become that until the last twenty minutes.

The actual blood and gore is low in this movie but it scared me on a much deeper level. There was a realism about it and it makes you think. People are not always what they seem.

If your over 16 and still think that bodily function humor is funny, then you are probably not mature enough to understand the concepts of a movie like this.  if you have Attention Deficit Disorder or can't stay off your cellphone for more than ten minutes, then you won't understand this movie.

But if all of your brain synapses are working properly and you have any inkling of an imagination, i.e being able to immerse yourself into story and character, (remember books, where you had to create your own emotions and imagery rather than having them spoon fed to you?) then you will find this very psychologically disturbing and in some instances jolting.  I saw this movie awhile ago and still have some of the images stuck in my head.  It also helps a great deal not knowing too much about the movie going in.  If everyone has been telling you how shocking or how great this movie is, as with any movie, it's going to take away from the overall effect intended and you might be disappointed.  i recommend renting this movie to decide for yourself if it has any merit or not.

1626358,4,B00005MKXB,"Director Takashi Miike has a truly strange pedigree when it comes to filmmaking. In the film ""Audition,"" what starts out as a normal date set-up for a lonely widowed man turns into the nightmare date from hell. The film takes place in Japan, where a decent and honorable man widowed for seven years is urged by his son to find a companion. Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) is a television producer, and when he is in a bar one day, he tells this friend that he wishes society was different, and that he would like to have a traditional woman who is the stay at home type. His friend recommends that he use an audition to find the suitable partner.

Since both of them work in the film business, the friend decides the Audition is the best way to find the right woman for Aoyama. Soon resumes from prospective female actors seeking the role in a film begin piling in. However, prospect after prospect is rejected by Aoyama. That is until he comes across one particular woman named Asami. The woman is very shy, and this appeals to Aoyama. However, his friend urges him to choose someone else. It dawned on me when I viewed this film a few years ago, that his friend was in the business of auditions, and apparently he saw something  that the lonely Aoyama did not. His friend even goes so far as to say that there is something wrong with her chemistry. Whatever the case, the point is Aoyama is infatuated with Asami.

Therefore, Aoyama has made his decision, Asami is the one. However, there is a problem, as Asami has no address. With only her phone number, and Asami sitting all alone awaiting his call--or any call, he decides to make contact. I will not go further into the film, as this will spoil it for those who have not seen this film. I will write though that this will not be the woman of his dreams. Life will seem much fuller and joyful after he and Asami begin a very strange relationship with each other. A relationship that I might add will be very one-sided. So much for Aoyama's  plans of a coy and subservient wife. The film is more or less a drama for the first half of the film, it is the second half where a seemingly 'normal' drama makes way for horror/thriller that is truly shocking. At least for the lonely Aoyama. Recommended.",1166400000,2,2243,4.436893203883495

There are many reviews you can read about the content, but one of the striking feature of this production is the ""crescendo"" of intensity and horror.

You could watch the first 3/4 of the movie on the Disney Channel, really, while the last quarter could not be broadcasted on American television.

And this is one of its most powerful strengths: you are watching an every-day, bland, realistic portrait of a Japanese man's life, which keeps ""real"" until madnes rips it all apart.

The ""deeper...deeper"" torture scene is an all-time classic of the genre, in my opinion.

Good photography, camera usage, scenography. Acting is convincing and genuine. The only little disappointment: there is no sex what so ever in the whole movie, although there are some sexual episodes. This is ok if you think this is more of a psycological horror movie, but considering the origin of the female protagonist madness, sex might have improved the averall ""color"" of the movie.

The subtle camera angling, amber lighting, conservative use of a score, long moments of silence punctuated by sudden bursts of action, the occasional intercutting of disturbing flashbacks.

1626380,3,B00005MKXB,"Audition has one of the most glowing reputations of any foreign horror film.  Everytime I tell someone that I am a horror fan, most of the time I get the response:  ""Have you seen Audition?!?!?!""  Well, I can finally say yes.  And I must say that I was a little disappointed with the results.  It would have been much better for me to watch the film without having any preconceived notions, but as I must review the film as is, I'd have to say it was disappointing.

The film is very Hitchcockian, in the fact that Miike takes something that seems normal and boring and, by the end of the film, turns into something absolutely horrible.  We are introduced to the main character as his wife dies, then, as we are propelled ahead 7 years, the widower goes to a friend and tells him he wants to remarry.  The friend decides to use a fake audition so the man can find himself the perfect mate.  The widower (I think his name was Aoyami...) picks a girl and starts to become pretty serious.  Basically the whole film is the development of their relationship with each other, and the last half hour of the film is devoted to the underlying horror that has been building for the past hour and a half.

I won't reveal anything about the film's final 20 minutes, but I will say that it had me squirming in my seat.  I can now see why Eli Roth chose to have Takashi Miike have a cameo appearance in Hostel.  Overall, though, the film was pretty boring up until the end, and it all felt pretty pointless to me.  Especially after hearing that Miike himself has said that the film is meant to have no social commentary.  If that is so, then Miike is truly using horrific violence for no reason at all.  Maybe just for the shock value, and that is no reason, in my opinion, to display horrific torture such as is displayed in the film's finale.  I'm not one of these anti-blood, anti-violence people, I love good violence in film, but my problem with Audition was just that the violence was borderline offensive and, as I said earlier, appears to serve no purpose whatsoever.

The quality of the film is definitely high, and the last scene did do its job of making me extremely uncomfortable.  But I can't give it a really good rating due to its slow pacing and ultimate pointlessness.",1157587200,,2271,4.428915662650603

1626382,3,B00005MKXB,"I'm not saying that I didn't want to see this film, simply that I was badgered into it by a girl I work with. My resistance lasted almost a month before I caved and finally sat down to watch it. Afterwards I tried to figure out why she recommended it and I'm still not quite sure, but my only guess is that it's because she's never seen anything quite like it. The film starts off with a plot similar to ""The Producers,"" only with the objective being love as opposed to money. A lonely man will cook up a fake movie and hold auditions for it. Once he finds the girl he will win her heart (no problem), and then make the movie anyways just to perpetuate the ruse. But because this is a Takashi Miike film the hero (and the audience) get far more than they bargain for.

The main idea of the film seems to be: ""Don't chase the fresh booty."" Aoyama picks a girl from his pile of headshots and basically decides that she will be his bride. From there he begins a disturbing obsession with her. Much is made of the fact that she is significantly younger than he is. Film really has a knack for hating on sex, but since people actually enjoy it they continue to sell it. Even films that are based around sex (""Unfaithful"" and ""Vanilla Sky"" leap to mind) compromise that fact by preaching the evils or sex (especially if it casual). Here Miike actually portrays the young girl as a violent, sociopathic monster, which I saw as a wee bit heavy handed. My dad was seriously bamboozled by a younger woman, so I know the dangers of this particular creature first hand. I'm simply saying that you can pump out all the cautionary tales in the world about sex, but it won't make a difference because people are people. Nobody likes growing old and everybody likes younger sex partners.

The end of the film turns into a jumbled mess in which reality has no meaning. This hurts the film because as I lost track of the action I continued to lose interest. Going in I thought I was going to be treated to extreme violence ""Ichi the Killer"" style, but since it doesn't show up until the final fourth of the film I thought for a while that I was mistaken. As far as that violence goes I consider it a net plus in this case. Its screen time is kept low and we actually have context to go with it (unlike ""Ichi the Killer""). It also creates some truly disturbing and original images that I guarantee will stick with you. If we are going to go with the idea that the violence did occur, and I'm not ready to make that jump, then the justification seems to be that the girl wants revenge on Aoyama because casting agents use their power to sleep with actresses (I guess). But that's a lot of nonsense since acting is such a greedy, self-centered profession that the girls who engage in that behavior are just as guilty. Also, Aoyama was looking for love not sex. His methods may have been a bit unorthodox, but what's a more honorable goal than love? The film also quickly delves into the nature of obsession (Aoyama really needed to get a clue and get off the case), and the thin line between pleasure and pain. Neither of these themes are ever really explored. Still I can't help but think that my dad would've benefited from seeing this film before he got married a second time. As for me, you have no reason to worry, the girl who I caved for is a few years older than I. **3/4",1155945600,3,3358,4.32012678288431

A man who loses his wife when his child is only a wee one, gets somewhat used to a life dependency on his son, work, and friends.  I guess this is an emotion we all go though at sometimes when we're hurt by losing a loved one, we just kinda clam up and live life though others, such as the lead character and his son.

When his son comes of age the widower decides to take the advice of his son and find a mate.  Well, for those who are unaware of this being a horror, the next thirty minutes is somewhat light hearted and fun filled.

This man holds a fake audition to find a new girlfriend, pretty humorous, especially some of the ladies who tried out for the fake audtion.  Then in comes his dream lady.

Instantly, you notice this girl is meek, filled with joy, polite, pretty, and just the girl any guy would want to bring home to mom.  For a bit of the film they kinda play the game of chase me.

Then the movie just takes this sick turn and it takes on a dream like state.  You see this girl actually is insane due to years of torture and rape by a realitive. What is most disturbing is I actually believe she thinks torture is pleasure, murder is love, and fear is joy.

In the last fifteen minutes of this film, the torture is so sick and twisted it made my toes curl.  The needles under the eyelids, gave me a headache, and the guy that came out of the burlap sack with missing libs and tongue really freaked me out when he ate her bowl of vomit.

1626390,4,B00005MKXB,"Audition is just THIS close to being brilliant.

Uber-manic director Takashi Miike starts slow, introducing us to Aoyama, a lonely, middle-aged Japanese widower, whose film-director friend gets a novel idea and sets Aoyama up with a great way to meet babes: as a sham producer, sitting in on auditions. Aoyama becomes infatuated with a seemingly demure Japanese beauty, calls her, invites her out for dinner, and then all hell breakes loose. Maybe literally, maybe not - unlike most of Miike's billions of films, a lot of this is left to the viewer to decide.

Miike directs from screenwriter Daisuke Tengan's script beautifully, letting the grotesque tension build to the point of bursting, subtly commenting on Japanese culture and with enough patented scenes of surreal freakishness to make the most jaded gore-hound run for cover (a friend of mine, seeing Audition in the theater, actually did, bolting out of his seat during the aforementioned needle scene).

The special edition doesn't really include a lot of new stuff, but is completely uncut, with all the fun creepiness included. So throw a party, invite all your squeamish friends and introduce them to real Asian horror cinema.

Aoyama then starts to get to know this woman and goes on dates with her but then he finds out that she may be lying about herself as he tries to figure out who she really is and once he finds out it isn't pretty.

Bottom line he goes out with a nut case.  The movie is 115 minutes. I kid you not 100 minutes of pure boredom. Man dates woman, goes to restaurants, small talk. Real boring stuff.  But the last 15 minutes of torture was awesome. It made me feel nausea, which means it was good quality torture (it takes a LOT to make me react to a movie.)

Asian cinema has a flare I don't find in American flicks. I was impressed with production, as well as directing, editing and superb acting. The storyline was expertly established from the beginning. The loneliness of the title character was unquestionable. So was that of the unexpected 'perfect lady.' Unlike many reviewers, I missed the horrifying 'horror.' This was a unique thriller and skillfully executed, even when dialogue was absent. But, to me, this was not a horror movie. The 'creepy' factor was missing, so I watched in expectation of something I never experienced. The 'perfect lady' was definitely demented and did horrible things, but didn't horrify me. If the movie was dubbed an unusual drama with unexpected, disturbing twists, I would have had more of an open mind. I guess, for me, the jury is out as to what sort of film this is. It's not a typical horror film, but it's very well done.",1149292800,4,1047,4.988571428571428

I actually had to turn off the movie at one point to take a break form the shock at what was happening to the main character. It was truly horrible.

1626395,5,B00005MKXB,"""Audition"" stands as not only an important horror film, but an important film in general. However, I wouldn't go so far as to say that ""Audition"" is horror. Indeed, the last fifteen to twenty minutes are extremely edgy and disturbing, but overall it could very well be Takashi Miike's finest achievement since it comes off as a painting more than a comic book (i.e. ""Ichi the Killer""). It is a film about loneliness, abuse, deception and (oddly enough) hope. Although there are no protagonists in this film, and though the somewhat pitiful femme fatale gets her point across with razor wire and needles, you feel sympathy for the characters involved because the true enemy is circumstance, and it is through circumstance (mainly Asomi's tragic past) that the male lead is drawn however subtly into his inevitable downward spiral. I'm surprised that Criterion hasn't integrated this important film into its outstanding library. Perhaps it will one of these days, but for the time being I'm just thankful that Lions Gate was gracious enough to make ""Audition"" domestically available. I give ""Audition"" my highest recommendation and strongly suggest you check it out. 5 stars.",1145664000,13,1173,5.114583333333333
1626406,4,B00005MKXB,"Takashi Miike is recognized as being one of the masters in the horror genre today. With such great films like Dead or Alive, Visitor Q, Ichi The Killer, Gozu etc. Miike's name is known all over to fans and its no surprise that hes even working on the episode 'Imprint' for the Showtime horror anthology series Masters of Horror. 1999 was pretty much the breakout year for Takashi, one of the films which he released was Audition. The romantic horror/thriller which shocked many audiences all over the world. Thankfully Lions Gate was able to bring us another DVD edition for the movie. The Auditon Uncut Special Edition DVD which is just enough to please any fan of Asian cinema.

Based on the novel by Ryu Murakami, Audition tells the story of a widower who is in search for love once more. After losing his wife many years, the mans son gives him an idea to look for a new companion. The lonely widower then gets together with a friend and his friend suggests that they hold a fake Audition so that he can meet new women. Once planned the two men hold an Audition for a TV movie with lots of women trying out for the lead role. Fascinated by one particular young woman, he then proceeds to ask her out on date. Sadly what the man doesn't know is that the woman is more mysterious then she looks.

Being a fan of foreign films I actually had a good time watching this movie. Ive reads tons of positive reviews in the past and when I got to see it for the first time I was pretty impressed. Honestly I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about and I can really see why a lot of people dig this movie. The film is even mentioned on Bravo's 100 Scariest movie moments countdown. Audition is a film which you really need a lot of patience for. Most of the film is more of a romance and the horror doesn't really kick in until the last 15 minutes. So if you plan to see this film I highly suggest that you don't watch it for the horror aspect of it. Take the time to watch it and enjoy the characters and story.

It starts off somewhat tragic and runs as a romance film. If you're a viewer who actually enjoys interesting realistic characters and plot then you won't be bored. But honestly if you have very little patience or a short attention span then you really won't enjoy this movie. There's tons of dialog and a lot of slow moments in the film. Miike's intention of the film is best explained in the bonus features. The film was made this way on purpose and its no surprise if you get bored after awhile. It was made to give you a sense of comfort for an hour or more and slap the horror in your face near the end.

Most of the film is just a build up to the last few scenes and its Miike's way of shocking an audience. I think thats one of the main reasons why people love this movie so much. Sure its not as gory or disturbing as Miike's later films, but Audition isn't the kind of movie to watch for the blood and gore, just more for the psychological aspect and nightmarish turn near the end. With this latest DVD edition there really isn't much of a difference if you compare it to the other uncut DVD which came out before. It features the same length running at 115 minutes, which is two minutes more then the R rated cut of the film.

Not only does the film look better in this edition but there are also some really neat special features. There's a new DVD introduction by Takashi Miike himself, select scene commentary, a sitdown interview with Miike, a photo gallery, the Bravos 100 Scariest Movie Moments segment and even an interview with the original author Ryu Murakami. If you're a fan of Miike and his work then you won't be disappointed with this Uncut Special Edition.",1144972800,3,3694,4.309352517985611

1626408,5,B00005MKXB,"Audition illustrates how our expectations and interests color what we perceive. There seems to be a lot of debate about whether it's horror or romance, but really it's both - and an excellent example of both genres at the same time. I don't believe there's really a sucker punch here either, as it's clear throughout that something doesn't add up about the woman, and the man is too blind to listen to reason. What happens, though, is your emotional investment in the characters in the first two thirds of the film makes you hope against hope that there can be a happy ending. We're used to the Hollywood kid-glove treatment. The gore, violence, etc. isn't as bad as most reviewers would lead you to believe; watch Jack torture suspects on the TV hit 24, or see some episodes of Oz, and you'll find scenes as bad as this. What makes the snakes slither in your gut and bite your spleen is the emotionally crushing element, which - in this era of anything-goes desensitization - is a testament to Miike's directorial prowess. There's also a wonderfully bizarro sequence where Miike finally pulls out all the stops and plunges you into the pain, skillfully show you the what and why without ""explaning"" things in the typical dumbed-down Hollywood way. Audition is a must-see film, especially if you're into cross-genre work.",1141516800,3,1321,4.798245614035087

You think you are watching one type of movie for the first seventy-minutes, only to be painfully, shockingly jolted into another kind of film for the last twenty. While the 'trick' itself is somewhat juvenile, the execution of it is incredibly well-done.  The father-son relationship at the core of the film is subtly and naturalistically rendered. The performances are perfectly under-played, and Miike times his low-beat revelations (""Dad, I brought home a girlfriend"") just right. Unfortunately, this is all done merely to set a trap for the audience, but I found myself wondering what Miike could achieve if he left behind the fantastic elements he seems so addicted to and set out purely to explore the kind of domestic drama he sets up so convincingly in the first two acts here. He seems to be trying to be David Lynch, but maybe his true talent is to be Ozu. Miike has his niche audience and they love the trademark stuff he delivers in the last 20 minutes. Personally, it left me cold. The shock-horror of it all felt way too contrived, and it drives a wedge between the filmmaker and the audience. You can sense Miike standing to the side, smiling as you squirm. I know people who rave about Miike, but I will have to watch more than Audition to understand why.",1140739200,,1320,4.764192139737991

There's not that much violence but this girl still freaks you out with her insane secrets. The beginning is a little long but it's put to good when you see how it all comes together at the end. I started watching Audition expecting a very scary movie meaning excessive gore and things that really aren't needed but instead I got a thought provoking film and that's how it gets in your head.

Asami seems like this cute young and talented girl with the usual ok but a little troubled past. It's crazy because Asami is cute but like Ryo's friend in the movie said right off you can tell something is wrong with her, you don't know how but you can just tell. Around the scene with Asami waiting by the phone for Ryo's call in a very different way than a normal person would you start getting the full effect of creepy that this girl is on. It gets even weirder when Ryo finally calls and Asami gives you a very disturbing and sick smile.

The film is better than others because it's more realistic and seems like it's a possibility that somewhere in the world there could be someone like Asami.

1626429,4,B00005MKXB,"I was first introduced to Audition by Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments in which it landed a not too modest # 11. Director John Landis (Animal House, An American Werewolf in London) confessed that he disliked it because it was TOO horrifying. Everyone else enthusiastically recounted the film's vomit-inducing closing as one of the most graphic and innovative torture sequences ever filmed.

Based on this I was a little apprehensive that it might turn out like the shamefully exploitative horror films that have been polluting theaters lately (Cabin Fever, Saw, Chaos), that it would be a blood-fetish pornography hiding behind a poorly drawn social parable which makes the film even more obnoxious.

With a different director (one in particular jumps to mind, but I'm not going to mention Eli Roth's name), this would've probably been the case, but Miike displays one characteristic which separates Audition from its less savory contemporaries: he looks on his characters, their infidelities and their cruelties, not with disdain and contempt, but with understanding, sympathy, and even compassion.

The presence of sadomasochism in the first half is extremely subtle compared to the T&A sequences that break Scream's horror movie survival rules. There is no prostitution or rape, only an unconventional and perhaps slightly dishonest way of meeting the right girl. Indeed when the tables finally do turn, the revenge hardly seems justified. And at the moment of greatest hopelessness, we see how, had the main character's shyness not inhibited his honesty, the whole situation might never had developed.

Audition's insight will satisfy most thoughtful movie-goers, and its gore should satisfy the cult crowd. Yet there's something mysteriously dry here. Usually seeing a film like this (even a horrible one) phases me. I'll be trapped in deep thought about the film's social implications or mope a little after the extreme violence. A dark cloud will hang over my mood for a while, and the experience will be difficult to shake from my mind. Audition didn't stick with me long after despite everything, but there's something bittersweet about thinking back on it when I do make the effort.",1138665600,3,2194,5.26

Audition is compelling storytelling: the lonely search for true love where a couples expectations clash . . . in this case cut to the bone! And I thought my first wife was a creep; she's Mother Theresa compared to the film's heroine. What starts as a search for love spirals into a nightmare of torture. Someone said this film is in the tradition of Vanishing, and I see the point. For in Audition a person's appearance can hide what lies deep underneath. I also agree with another reviewer's point that Audition is a metaphor for miscommunication between the sexes. We're all talking to one another. The problem is we use different scripts. This is an interesting film. It would be hard to classify it in a particular genre. Maybe Romeo and Juliet meets The Texas Chainsaw Massacare. Don't see this film if you have unstable angina or suffered a recent stroke. I also wouldn't advise seeing it on a first date or taking you mother to it . . . unless she's Mommie Dearest or Norman Bates' mother.

1626435,5,B00005MKXB,"After seeing this, I'm convinced that not only is Takashi Miike a thoroughly disturbed individual, but as brilliant a horror director as there is. He doesn't need monsters, or constant scenes of death and destruction (though he does do this in some of his movies). He can use innocent moments and sweet, lonely girls to achieve the horrifying effect that all of his movies seem to have. Audition is that movie. It starts out actually kind of sweet, and remains that way for more than half the movie, slowly drawing us into the romance between the two main characters, until that final, blood-soaked moment at the end.

As I said, Audition starts out innocently, with a man named Aoyamo grieving the death of his wife and accepting the responsibility of raising his son all his own. And this, he excels at. Everything he does is for his son, and, seven years after the death of his wife, he has more of a deep friendship with his son. So, when his son recommends that his father remarry, the widower follows the advice, and asks a friend for help. The friend, a man whose job is casting films, decides that they should hold a fake audition for a romance movie, and thus Asami, a gorgeous young woman, enters the movie. Slowly yet surely, Aoyama falls for this mysterious woman, whose past does not exactly add up to the ""facts"" she provided during the audition, something he ignores. While the movie plays out, we see him getting drawn closer and closer to this dangerous woman until ""it"" happens.

The movie has moments that carry us from scene to scene that constantly reminds us that, ""Yes, this movie is a horror film, and just so you don't forget, have this...."" Two scenes in particular jump out at me, one I call the ""Jumping Sack"" and the other ""The Tongue."" After seeing these scenes, I knew what I saw yet I was still unsure and I had to go back and check and see if the horrifying feeling I had in my gut was justified. It was, both times, and many more after that. That's basically how the movie carries itself up until the torture scenes at the end, with gut-wrenching and startling moments of pain or torture that last no more than a blink. But it's enough. The ending itself is one long moment like this, where you can't help but watch yet you feel terrible for doing so (whether it's in your mind or in your stomach, you'll definitely feel something).

This movie was considered one of the top twenty horror films made in the last fifty years by Bravo, and after watching it you'll know why. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Takahashi Miike, because it takes a true fan to enjoy his movies to the fullest. I'd also recommend this movie to anyone who a) doesn't mind feeling disturbed and, b) can't take the constant failures that American horror movie-makers are pumping out on a monthly basis.",1136592000,5,2827,4.528375733855186

1626438,2,B00005MKXB,"Obviously there are some people who really enjoyed this film, and some even thought it terrifying. While that seems almost incomprehensible to me, I still credit them with the ability to get pleasure out of something from which I felt completely disconnected. And much like ""Mulholland Drive"", the film has inspired a lot of message board communication based on the inability of its fans to agree on (or to even understand) what director Takashi Miike was trying to communicate. Or for that matter what is supposed to be reality and what is supposed to be dream/hallucination. To experienced viewers of Japanese cinema I acknowledge that my finding the story predictable and simplistic is most likely due my inexperience with Japanese films (although I love ""Dansu Wo Shimasho Ka"" aka ""Shall We Dansu?""). But my point is that other inexperienced Japanese cinema viewers will probably have similar reactions.

Accordingly, while I would not take the responsibility to recommend ""Audition"", I don't discount the possibility that some viewers may enjoy it. Technically and creatively it is a well made. Although the production design was an afterthought (antiseptic) and every scene is depressing and ugly; the lighting, editing and directing/acting are all excellent.

It is not terrifying, it is not even scary although it has some gross scenes. It would be scarier if you were unaware of its genre and of the film's reputation, the less detail you know about plot, the better. This film can only offer suspense and shock when you don't yet know what to expect. Unfortunately, anyone reading these comments or the DVD case has partially blown it-so reading the next paragraphs if you intend to view the film is a bad idea.

""Audition"" feels realistic, in part because of the deliberate slow pacing throughout the first 2/3's of the film. Unfortunately that makes it soap opera boring and I began identifying with the succession of passengers in ""Airplane"" who commit suicide rather than continue to listen to Robert Hays' life story. I was able to stay focused by counting the many spelling errors in the subtitles, which were especially amusing on the occasions when they changed the entire meaning of a sentence to something absurd.

There is much more mild melodrama than horror or suspense, like reading a textbook on abnormal psychology while listening as a BBC historical drama plays on your television set. First you get thirty minutes that sets up Aoyama's family situation and loneliness. Then thirty minutes to introduce Asami and the start of their relationship. Then forty minutes unearthing Asami's family situation and loneliness. Finally Asami begins to take her revenge on Aoyama but is dispatched by his son with remarkable ease, so easy that you actually wish for a Jason-like reanimation.

The ""Uncut Special Edition"" is not a new cut, it is the previous DVD release with new special features. Director Miike provides a commentary and an interview.",1133395200,11,2966,5.10721649484536
1626449,4,B00005MKXB,"Okay.  I usually try to avoid making comparisons to other movies in my reviews, but talking about this film in context to Ichi the Killer will help me be more clear about what I'm trying to say.

When I saw Ichi the Killer, I was stunned by how well everything added up into an insanely exciting climax that is honestly one of the best pieces of cinema I had seen in a while.  When I read the synopsis of this film, Audition, I was expecting that it would be even more intense because it would be a more personal accumulation into sadism and psychotics than the public gang-brawl exposition of Ichi the Killer.

And I was disappointed.  Whereas this film does go in directions that seem incredible and amazing (and very, very uncomfortable), said directions don't really seem to have a purpose.  I mean, she's a sadist and the subject of an abusive life, but what are we supposed to do with it besides the little bit of what's there?  This film doesn't really end, it just kind of gets it over with and then dies down.  I was expecting a lot more from it.

This isn't to say this film is completely terrible or even bad.  It's very finely crafted and for most of the lead-up is very exciting.  The knowledge of what's to come makes it terrifying, and I don't even want to think about what this movie would be like without knowing what's going to happen--possibly traumatizing.  Yet it eventually left me unsatisfied.

Miike is an amazing director and an awesome visual artist.  His work with sadism is like the Asian version of Cronenberg, at least that's as best a comparison as I can think of right now.  By all means, watch this film if you can... just I'd strongly recommend experiencing Ichi the Killer instead.

1626450,4,B00005MKXB,"Like a David Lynch film, ""The Audition"" does not give you all of the answers, and is open to interpretation. Part romantic comedy, part horror film and part surreal thriller, ""The Audition"" is full of surprises.

Aoyama, a lonely, workaholic single father, is still recovering from losing his talented wife seven years ago. After confessing that he'd like to marry again, he lets a smarmy friend convince him to use a film audition to pick out a potential wife. He's  instantly attracted to Asami, a former ballerina who he senses has lived through pain and loss like he has. They begin a hurried love affair, and Aoyama is ready to propose before they spend their first night together. However, Asami disappears during the night, and the film takes a completely bizarre turn.

My interpretation is that Aoyama is a man who has learned to equate love with suffering. Losing his wife has left him an emotional cripple, so in his dreams (or fantasies) his new love, Asami, who appears sweet and gentle, is actually a twisted sadist who will torture and cripple him as well. The disfigured cripple in the sack is Aoyama himself.

However, like any true work of art, the viewer is left to draw their own conclusions.",1132531200,,1212,4.757142857142857
1626451,2,B00005MKXB,"All the reviews on this film and everything everyone I know told me about this film were all incredibly misleading.

""Audition"" was an extremely boring movie. I'll admit, I went into it with high expectations - seeing as I had been told it was, ""The most messed up movie ever,"" by a professor and I read about its ""brutality"" here on the Amazon reviews. There are no words to describe how amazingly disappointing watching this was.

It is not ""brutal"" or ""gruesome"" or even ""intense"". The first hour of the movie drags on like it's never going to end, and in this hour there is NOTHING happening. It is all monotonous build up to a more than unworthy climax. Honestly, there were points where I wanted to just stop the DVD, get up, and run around in circles because I could not stand the boredom of sitting there waiting for something to happen.

When the film reaches its climax, even that was a let down. Yes there is an extremely disturbing scene that is very graphic and there is also a scene that is just downright disgusting, but they are not good enough to make up for the ridiculous amount of build up. TWO scenes, no more than 15 minutes, to account for all of that? I didn't need a mindless bloodbath, but I did need to feel like I hadn't wasted my time.

It seems many reviewers are calling this a ""psychological thriller"" and perhaps it is if you are a very simple person. There is no ""thrill"" to the psychology here. From the moment she is introduced, it is made very, very clear that there is something very strange about Asami, the pretty girl auditioning. Protagonist Shigeharu's good friend, the one who had the idea for Shigeharu to pick a girl via audition in fact, tells Shigeharu from get-go that he doesn't like or trust her. The audience knows all along that she's a lunatic and she is shown acting as such randomly throughout the film so it's not even a matter of ""waiting for her to crack.""

Some people say that this is a story of revenege - it's NOT. It's a story of an insane woman who butchers and kills men, seemingly randomly, once she's established a relationship with them. There is no real reason other than that she is insane because of what she was put through as a child.

I truly believe that some people convince themselves that this was a good, interesting film just because other people seem to think it is. Well, it isn't. Honestly, I wish I could see and understand what it is that everyone is convinced was so great. Don't make the mistake I did, rent it and make up your own mind before you buy it.

And I must add that anyone who says ""Audition"" is Takashi Miike's best film have obviously just never seen his others...or they thought his other films were just downright awful.",1132099200,12,2723,4.455823293172691
1626452,5,B00005MKXB,"Takashi Miike's best film.  Audition is a movie best viewed without any knowledge of the storyline.  I bought it on the basis of many positive reviews & having recently gotten into the Asian horror films such as 'Ringu' &  'Pulse' (Kairo) I was looking forward to another great Asian horror film.  But of course it's not a Horror film.  Well, not really.  There's nothing supernatural here.  Just the rather sad tale of a man who's wife having died seeks love in a rather sneaky & underhand way setting up fake Audition's for a non-existent movie ( hence the title).  He meets a demure & otherworldly young woman who captures his overly eager heart.  Unfortunately this girl comes with a whole lot of History & none of its good.  If you didn't know better the first half of the movie plays out almost like a romantic comedy in stark contrast to how it ends.  Don't expect fireworks here though.  This is a movie where the slow-burn really works.  Beautifully directed by the very talented Mr. Miike (Check out 'Happiness of the Katakuris' & 'Ichi the Killer' to see his range).  You know something's got to give and when the final pay-off hits you it's definitely worth the wait.  Not for the squeamish or faint of heart some of the final scenes induced in me my most cringe-worthy moments in all my years of movie-watching.

1626455,5,B00005MKXB,"It can be hard to commit to a movie you know nothing about. But I will try to give a review of Audition without spoiling the film.

First of all, you should know that Audition is NOT a horror film. It is more of a psychological thriller with very intense, very disturbing images.

There is a lot of character development in this movie. This goes on for almost 2/3 of the film. Some people may find this to make the film drag.

To be honest there are subtle hints that everything may not be quite right early in the film but the first real scare is probably 40-45 minutes into it (The scene where he finally calls the girl back after three days or so and it cuts back to her flat...if you've seen it you know what I'm talking about..for those who haven't seen it I would love to tell you but all I can say is I jumped a mile when it happened).

The character development, for me, works very well..I even found myself enjoying watching the two characters develop the relationship almost like a love story.

But...the film suddenly turns on you and then it has you.

For the last 20 minutes or so the film just becomes disturbing. All bets are off, everything that the film was building to make you comfortable is shattered and you are left squirming in your seat.

There is a halucination scene that messes with your mind, not to mention that part of it is a very disgusting. Then a torture scene - played in real time. The camera doesn't show everything but it doesn't look away ether.

So...Final Thoughts..

I was very impressed (and disturbed) by Audition. The character build up reminded me of The Exorcist or even The Usual Suspects, where it builds up slowly and then takes off without warning then doesn't let go.

If you are the type of person who needs the shock, horror and graphic gore up front and immediatly...this film is not for you.

If you are easily disturbed by unrelenting, in your face graphic violence (even for the short amount of time it is in this movie) this film is not for you.

If you are willing to be patient, commit yourself to the story that is unfolding in front of you, let the film sneek up on you and then stay with it to the end then you won't be sorry.",1130803200,8,2190,4.32762836185819
1626456,5,B00005MKXB,"Although there is certainly something worth saying about ""ripeness"" in Audition, Michael W's review should have said the violence is ""rife,"" as in abundance, not well-aged. Thanks as well to Michael W. for the spoilers, and the redundant observation that he thinks the film is about loneliness. One character even says that everyone in Japan is lonely.

The first two thirds of the flick feels like the Japanese equivalent of a Lifetime flick, sprinkled with moments that something is terribly, terribly wrong.  A gentleman by the name of Aoyama is looking for a new wife, having become widowed some years ago.  A buddy of his has the bright idea of holding a fake audition so he could meet the right girl, and immediately he becomes enamored with a pretty young lady named Asami.  However, it becomes obvious that she's not all that she appears to be.

I'm not going to give anymore away.  All I will say is that at the end of this movie, I felt as if I had been violated somehow.  I cringe just thinking of the last 45 minutes or so of this movie.  And it takes a lot for a film to have that effect on me to that extent.  Truly, it is the work of a genius.",1130630400,5,1077,4.282178217821782

I enjoy intelligent horror movies.  I don't enjoy gore for gore's sake, or the formulaic malfunctioning car at the inopportune moment, or the naked girl running without explanation through a dark forest, etc.  If you are of a similar mindset, this is a movie for you.

It's disturbing, it's terrifying, and it builds up to a climax that will gray the hair on your head with fear.  The story is a simple concept, portrayed by complex characters.

Maybe the best thing I can say about this movie is that it has spurred my interest in other Japanese horror films.  As I understand, this movie might be the measuring stick for their brand of horror.  However, until American moviemakers stop cranking out the standard, cookie-cutter horror movies, tired remakes of older, better movies, or Americanizing previously released Japanese horror films, I'll turn to the Far East to get my fright fix.",1130544000,4,1167,4.79

AUDITION made #11 on Bravo's 100 Scariest Movie Moments list, and there are some chilling scenes that really stand by the reasoning for such a high rank on the list.

Aoyama is set up as one of the nicest guys on the planet, and after the tragic death of his wife at the beginning of the movie, he sets up a fake audition for a new wife to begin another chapter of his life. After sifting through several women, he finally settles on Asami, who at first seems like the sweetest girl on Earth, but during the course of the movie, her insanity, her evil, and her instability show their true colors. Trust me, this movie will leave you confused, shocked, and startled. The torture scenes in the movie are absolutely disgusting, and poor Aoyama gets the worst of it. Everything in this movie will leave you on pure edge and pure insanity.

AUDITION remains too real to this day, and the worst bad date experience of anyone's life. It's a brilliant classic; it's a horrific piece of art; and the movie will leave you in complete disbelief about how scary silence and shyness really can be.

This one suffers from the same problem as Gozu.  Boring slow buildup to an extreme ending.

As similar to something I heard in Brian DePalma's Carlito's Way featurette, my criticism is that the beginning is excruciatingly long and boring.  But the solution isn't to shorten it but to make it longer.

When we are told about the girl's background, much, much more details are needed to get us interested in her dangerous and dark mindset.

Also when the violence comes at the end, I also felt it should have been extended 2 or 3 times the length to really make it torturous instead of some quick extreme violent acts.  But that may just be me, I thought the ""I Spit on Your Grave"" rape scene was extremely silly and unrealistic just cutting away to a guy making silly faces.  Same here, I didn't feel much empathy in the guy's torture.  It just didn't seem torturous enough to me.

It was some good violence at the end but it was too quick and isolated to be reason to rate the movie higher.

There are other problems as well, the main character is drugged and falls down.  During this time, thoughts go through his mind about the girl that actually may be pretty accurate but are things that he had absolutely no knowledge of.  The director instead really should have introduced these points elsewhere in a logical manner.

Also, Miike seems to like to reuse his ideas.

Breast milk - Visitor Q + Gozu

Needles into skin - Ichi + Audition

Violence to tongue - Ichi + Audition

I believe that if Miike extended the beginning further, it could have been more interesting and seemed less drawn out and slow.  Also, the ending needed to be more drawn out and torturous.",1125446400,4,1805,4.495384615384616

I would also have to say that ending was kind of stupid too. What the hell is she spraying at that kid anyway.

1626477,5,B00005MKXB,"A truly terrifying movie that happens to be a well made film. Audition scares and shocks for sure, but you might be surprised that underneath all is a deep, well constructed plot full of subtlety you'd never expect from a ""cult horror"" movie. This disturbing film brought international acclaim to director Takashi Miike, one of the most original, innovative, and skillful directors to appear in the last 20 years.

This movie has little in common with Ringu and the other Japanese horror fare currently being cannibalized by Hollywood. In many ways this is less a horror film than a drama. There are few of the horror genre's traditional ""scare moments."" The film has it's over the top aspects, but overall, this film feels realistic to a degree which the average horror film never approaches.

This is not a film for everyone, certainly. Many are bored by the film, which is understandable due to the deliberate slow pacing throughout the first 2/3 of the film. Others are letdown in general as compared to the reputation the movie has. I can also see this, as the film's seems to have gain an almost mythical status among some fans; it's shock aspect is often built to a level which nothing but a snuff film could reach, and it's usually represented as something it's not (i.e. an edge of your seat thriller). This attracts people seeking only moments such as those found in the movie's final scenes find they are out of luck; this is not just an exploitation splatter flick. The psychological elements far outstrip the gore, and they contain the real terror this film stands on. The amount of violence and the general explicitness is above what many people (perhaps most people) consider tasteful.

Also, some of said ""don't believe the hype,"" but I say ""don't listen to the hype."" What I mean is, the less detail you know about this film and its plot, the better. The film is a truly great when you don't yet know what to expect.

Technically, this DVD edition is good (and badly needed, as the film has been out of print for a while). Calling this the ""Uncut Special Edition"" implies that this is a new cut, but this is NOT the case. This is the uncut edition, as was the previous DVD release, along with new special features. Director Miike provides an intro to the DVD, commentary, and an interview. Also includes is the BRAVO segment on the film and an interview with Ryo Ishibashi.

Before watching this, my first Takeshi Miike movie, I thought that The Exorcist, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Evil Dead, Rosemary's Baby, and Kubrick's The Shining were the scariest horror films I'd ever seen.

Audition blows them ALL away in a single stroke. I seriously don't know exactly what level of damage we inflicted to the Japanese psyche with our ""visit"" to Hiroshima 50 years back, but methinks it has something to do with the likes of this movie; which (along with the rest of Miike's oeuvre) makes 99% of American horror entries past and present look like an episode of The Brady Bunch by comparison.

The genius of this film lies in its pacing. Unlike most pedestrian, substandard ""slasher"" flicks which hit you with the splatter and severed bodies almost right up front, Audition takes its sweet time in milking the suspense for all it's worth. At first, this movie seems like a slightly quirky romantic comedy with a Japanese twist (main character and film producer Aoyama's wife dies of terminal illness, so at the behest of one of his friends he stages a fake film audition in order to find a prospective bride). He discovers the delightful, alluring, and stereotypically submissive beauty Asami (played to the cold steel hilt by Eihi Shiina), a woman who is not at all who she appears..

I won't spoil the rest. Suffice to say, once things start coming unglued and Asami reveals her true sadistic nature, you will be left with images that dive like a red-hot fireplace poker straight into your psyche; a portrayal of cultural gender roles turned on their heads; and will probably have to sleep with the lights on for the next week and a half.

Later on during the movie when they go to sleep he has a dream that seems so real about her childhood and everything else. When he wakes up shes not there(its a dream), and wants to know where she went. Then out of nowhere shes in his house and starts to put needles all over his body saying deeper(I don't remember what the Japanese word was) and then sits on them to make it go in deeper. She has this rope thing that can cut though meat or anything then starts to chop his foot off with it. Then she dies and tells him that everyone's the same to her but he wasnt.

1626542,5,B00005MKXB,"1999's *Audition* cemented Takashi Miike's reputation as the preeminent l'agent provocateur in Japanese cinema.  No mean feat, given that this was an industry that, thanks to a relative free-reign ethic towards censorship (only the display of genitals is a no-no), had for decades tested the boundaries of the traditional and the taboo, expounding the theme of 'eros in hell' to extreme measures.  Chalk up another entry here.  Worlds away from the yakuza genre-deconstructions of the *Dead or Alive* series, *Audition* begins deceptively low key for a Miike film, and for the first two-thirds maintains a subtle, serene composition, balancing the main thrust of the story - tentative romance between disparate individuals - with occasional hints of a far more dreadful denouement.  The meat of the film examines the fabric of power and submission in relationships, between producers and auditioning actresses, between men and women, between traditional mores and secreted desires.  Then the gloves come off and the third act puts a new spin on the catch-phrase ""damaged goods,"" evoking horror and tension - ""neutralized"" (to quote Miike) by grotesque black-humor - to an almost unbearable threshold.  It goes without saying that Miike films are not for those of weak constitution, but *Audition* succeeds above and beyond by unleashing its secrets in the final half hour, long after the audience has come to sympathize/empathize with both the main leads.  It's delayed-gratification torture, exquisite in design and all the more psychologically traumatic therein.

*Audition* begins with film producer Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) in the hospital, watching his wife succumb to a terminal illness.  We then cut to seven years later, when Aoyama's son tells his father that he should re-marry, he's ""starting to look old.""  Aoyama thinks this is good advice, but had no clue as to finding his ideal mate - one that, in his descriptions, comes off as a stock clich of the submissive-innocent ideal.  A fellow employee comes up with an ingenious scheme: audition a number of unknown actresses for a phony movie and find one suitable for marriage.  A very funny montage of struggling Japanese actresses trying to land the part follows, but Aoyama has already made his choice in the mysterious figure of Asami Yamazaki (the gorgeous Eihi Shiina), whom he discovers when he spills coffee on her applicant sheet.  Clad in virginal white, displaying via body language the quality of the traditional submissive Japanese woman, Asami sears an unforgettable image in Aoyama's brain, though his co-worker is suspicious:  ""I don't like her...her chemistry...it's not right.""

Aoyama forges on regardless, calling up the actress and carefully manipulating the relationship from the professional to the personal.  In this first half *Audition* resembles a typical romantic drama - lonely bachelor seeks young, willing partner; she, scarred by the past, responds with sweet acceptance - but the film forewarns us that things are not what they seem, explicitly in a portrait of Asami's stark living quarters, complete with a howling wind ambience and a mysterious bag on the floor that shifts and gurgles when the phone rings.  Dread seeps into the atmosphere; something sinister is afoot.  Just how sinister, however, is doled out with methodical precision, and the charisma of Ishibashi and Shiina, who exude a sweet compatibility at first, the flaws and wounds of the past inconsequential to a primal ~longing~, help distract us until the blinders are finally ripped away and the power/submissive ethic is put in stunning reverse-mode.  At this point in the DVD interview Miike admits that theatre audiences began to trickle out of the initial screenings, unable to comprehend or endure the succession of caustic images filmed in real-time.  I can't say I blame them, but I personally couldn't look away, either.

Part of this is in large part due to the masterful craft of the film - cinematography, editing (ranging from understated to gut-punching) and especially the use of sound: tinkering piano conjures fuzzy sentimentality; dissonant violins build the tension; and those sound effects...! I don't think I'll ever be able to hear the phrase ""here kitty kitty"" again without thinking about this film.  The particulars of *Audition*'s cinema-construction burrow deep into the brain, like a tick or a virus, simultaneously seducing and setting bonds: this is tragic filmmaking at its best.

I tend to dislike the genre of horror for its (general) cheapness of script and overall intent, its rampant copycat reiteration and stale motifs.  ~Real~ horror, to me, is the trauma that human beings inflict upon each other, both physically and psychologically, intentional or subconsciously.  With those parameters in consideration, *Audition* is one of the best ~real~ horror films I've ever seen, a romantic postcard edged with razor blades.  The fact that the end credits roll in accompanied by quasi-jazz J-pop/rock careens the whole affair into the beyond-disturbed realm.

1626544,5,B00005MKXB,"I will not go over plot points already covered in other reviews, but rather add another dimension to the discussion of the horror / gore aspect of the movie.

In my view, the horrific and gory scenes of Aoyama being drugged, dismembered and so on are all dreamt. That is, everything between Aoyama being covered with a sheet after entering the bed with Asami and his waking up to fetch a glass of water is a dream. The dream continues after he goes back to bed.

To put it simply, at the surface level, the movie is a psychologically acute and well acted drama about the growing relationship between Asami and Aoyama. Now, just as vintage horror fans will tell you, that which is implied is far more subtly terrifying than simple splatter and gore. The torture and punishment Aoyama undergoes at the hands of Asami is a nightmare firmly rooted in the narrative of the so-called boring build-up to these gut-wrenching scenes.

An attentive look at the first three quarters of the movie reveals how motifs, phrases, and the emotional 'baggage' brought by each protagonist to the relationship are reworked in Aoyama's subconscious into a terrifying nightmare.

It is to the writer's credit that this nightmare follows dream-logic in a way that is still cinematic and accessible. It is a dream which reveals much about the character of Aoyama, and nothing at all about Asami. (In fact, through the whole film, she is more an object of his gaze and interpretation than a subject narrating her own experience.)

Does this mean that this movie should not be classified as a horror film? In my view, it is better seen, and only makes sense, at the level of an insightful, character driven drama about the guilt-complex of a traditional middle-aged man decided upon marrying a younger woman with some baggage of her own. Her 'baggage' is, of course, only alluded to, but it is enough for Aoyama's imagination to work into a powerful expression of his own fears and sense of guilt. And, likeable as the character of Aoyama is, there is enough for his guilt to chew on: he has used the artificial and deceptive 'audition' to find himself a wife. He was against the idea but talked into it by his coworker. Is it so strange that his subconscious should reproach him for it? He is remarrying after the death of his first wife through illness. Is it so strange that she should reappear in the dream sequence to warn him against Asami? And Asami herself is somewhat of a mysterious character. She is marrying a far older man. Why? And why isn't she already involved with someone. She has had a difficult upbringing. What emotional scars might it have left on her? The character herself, so brilliantly acted, also conveys a negative 'vibe' in the way some people just seem to do.

This is a movie in which the 'male' gaze is very much the primary one. The story is told from his point of view. But the female has her own revenge. She intrudes through the workings of his subconscious, complicated by his doubts and his repressed sense of guilt. If she must be objectified in the manner she is, an unattached female drawn out of a short-list of viable female candidates and turned into a dutiful wife, then she might just become, potentially a rather nasty object. In the strange, reverse world of the dream, she has become the active subject, and he is the drugged and immobile victim of her tortures and punishments. .

Why, then, is the movie always referred to as a horror film? In short, it needed to be promoted as such to get an audience. If the reviews here are anything to go by, it certainly seems to have been received as such.

But it is so much more than a horror flick, one-and-a-half hours more in fact. It is NOT a horror film with good characterization, but an insightful romantic drama with a violent undertone of personal and cultural repression. In fact, I would say that it is unique in standing between the two genres, linking the two and transgressing the bounds of both, for if horror films are so often characterless splatterfests, then romantic dramas are also often guilty of being superficial, sugary twaddle. To see it any other way is to overlook what the film achieves at once so brilliantly and so terrifyingly. Whether this was a fluke or intended as such, can only be answered by the director himself. I like to think, that like Asami, this movie can take on a life of its own in the viewer's mind.  A+++ of an movie!",1108512000,12,4435,4.618020304568528
1626545,4,B00005MKXB,"takashi miike pulls no punches in this movie that is clearly not for the squeamish. the movie is devious and gory, yet credible enough to keep the intelligent viewer wondering.

The PLOT: aayoma, the lonely widower, meets asami a pretty single young woman through an audition set up for the purpose of helping aayoma find a suitable girl. as aayoma begins to fall for asami hard, there is more to her innocent pretty-girl looks than meets the eye. a dark sinister secret surrounds her and her demanding love results in a tragic and incredulous end.

The ANALYSIS: Audition has its shock value, but is there more to the movie than that? definitely. the plot (based on the enfant terrible of japanese literature, ryu murakami's novel) which starts off in a linear narrative hurls the audience through an impossible vortex as it hurtles through a horrifying finale, where the narrative spans through time and reality back and forth, leaving the viewer guessing what is real and what is a dream.

PLOT BREAKDOWN -(SPOILERS herein): Aayoma falls for asami, he goes on a date with her, they spend a weekend together at a resort where he proposes marriage, she accepts, he wakes up while in bed with her having a nightmare, she realises that even while in bed with her, his thoughts are not entirely hers. asami's brittle and disturbed mind takes this as a sign that he doesnt love only her. presumably sometime he has discussed with her how much he loves his son too. anyway, he wakes up the next morning to find her missing. he investigates, finds out about her, her lies, her past involving her uncle, her aunt (who she probably mutilated and murdered, it is upto the viewer to decode and understand this). her record company agent has incurred her wrath too and he gets 'suitably' punished by asami. asami sneaks into aayoma's house and drugs his drink, kills his dog. in the drugged state, even as aayoma's subconscious is beginning to unravel all this information mixing up his own personal inner demons with the realisation about asami that he is figuring out, asami enters to wreak havoc. she is not done with aayoma yet. she begins to inflict serious torture on aayoma, including amputating his feet. enter aayoma's son and he saves his father from suffering more. end of story.

FINAL VERDICT: Audition is an audacious movie, it subverts the viewer, throwing sadistic images and thoughts at him. However what makes it work is the study of alienation, childhood abuse, loneliness and the subtle insights into the working of a sick mind, what makes it so compelling is that the sick mind hides in the body of a gorgeous woman (Eihi Shiina who plays asami is a former model). Audition is a sick metaphysical tour de force, that leaves the viewer gasping for breath, while the beginning is a bit too slow-paced it is essential in shocking the viewer by lulling him into a sense of complacency leaving him totally unprepared for the sick mayhem that follows.

If you've heard of the millenial new wave of east asian cinema treats and only have enough money for one DVD(and Ringu and Battle Royale) this is a must have title. Unlike Ringu, The Eye et al its non supernatural but no less frightening for it. Having said that it still taps into very modern concerns balanced with ancient,for want of a better word superstitions,as those pictures do.

 We've all dated a psycho(guys and girls) but covergirl Asami(played to mathematical perfection by Elii Shiina) goes a bit further then leaving to many messages on your machine or buying you unwelcome ties. ALOT FURTHER! If youve heard anything at all about this pic its probably that people have walked out of hte theatre(hand over mouth gagging) but if I were to cut ten minutes from the film youd never no why and it would still stand up as a pleasant and engaging slice of eastern cinema. But those ten minutes - you won't see the like of it coming out of Hollywood especially given the current climate(you know what i mean).

The violence is not graphic but horrifying, theres a difference. The context of the violence makes it so. Psycho Cop 3 The slashining has graphic violence but is never scary. Is it that the person inflicting the violence is so beautiful and pure looking, the very plausible idea that behind such a lovely face could lurk cold hearted insanity or the fact the director has poured so much effort into getting the audience to invest with these characters. In any case there are three scenes of extreme and visceral mutilation and torture. If  that sort of thing offends you then give this movie a pass. Takashi is a guy who has been accused of being a courter of shock and controversy for its own sake but here I think most people would agree the violence is central to the well crafted story and completely justified artistically.

1626569,5,B00005MKXB,"Miike Takashi's film is a superb example of the increasingly popular genre now as 'J Horror' Although I should point out that it is not a good starting place for newcomers. The tone of Audition is quite remarkable. It starts off as a film about a widower who runs a small business. His teenage son thinks that dad should start looking for a new wife. Further egged on by a film producer friend of his, they put together an audition for young, attractive actresses for a film role that does not exist.
It is said that these kind of fake auditions are often used by men in the film industry looking for a new girlfriend or more commonly, a mistress. If the girl they date mentions the role, they claim there is trouble with the financing that has delayed the whole project. The irony here is that the main protagonist is clearly uncomfortable with lying, and has his arm twisted to go along. The girl he does fall for and subsequently dates, seems a little odd but with great depth to her character. What slowly unfolds is that this girl has gone through hell. Sadistically abused whilst practicing ballet for her disabled and [...] uncle. She later suffers the trauma of having to completely give up dance by an injury. She is well aware of how budding young women like herself are used. What we see unfold is her turning the tables. For me, what works best about Audition is the subtle clues it gives you, as it moves towards what you expect to be a disturbing finale. Well, it does not disappoint..The girl has an ingenious way of getting even with men who would use her. Ingenious, immaculately planned and so cruel as has to be seen to be believed. I can't help wonder why it is only in the far east they seem to able to make extreme movies that are so superbly produced and acted. Half way through, you could be forgiven for thinking that this film is a romantic drama. Yet by the end, everything makes sense in a satisfying way that is too often absent in western horror /thrillers. For me, I found it a fascinating study of the everyday duplicity and lies that we are all engaged in to get what we want. Most people seem to think that they are not worthy enough to fulfill their dreams and therefore have to lie and cheat their way to success. If Audition doesn't persuade you of the dangers that stem from deceiving people, particularly women, in order to use them, then nothing will. This film is 'adult' in the real sense. Not because of nudity or
violence, but because the subject matter is best viewed by mature, cynical people who understand the dark side of their own nature.",1103068800,7,2588,4.473572938689218

  That being said, this movie is a dark Hitchcockian gem.  The acting is superb and realistic from all of its players.  The direction is flawless and very creative at once.  The movie is touching in its early stages and unflinchingly sadistic in its latter. One scene in my opinion rivals the scene in ""Texas Chainsaw"" where Leatherface is revealed.  I won't go into the moral and social issues, but they're there.

  It personally took a 2nd viewing of this movie for me to appreciate its finer parts.  If you're new to Asian Cinema or Miike (yet, he seems to change his style or rules on every movie), it might grow on you as well.",1101600000,3,908,4.537037037037037
1626573,4,B00005MKXB,"The romantic relationship between Aoyama and Asami seems genuine. Aoyama has met is bride-to-be, and I don't see Asami as his next brief sexual conquest. Of course Aoyama is infatuated, and knowing little about Asami, he makes her into the girl of his dreams. And when speaking to Asami, Aoyama hears only what he wants to hear, and gives little consideration to Asami's abusive past. He feels sorry for her, and acts not as the manipulator, but as the rescuer.

Despite Asami's bashful persona, it is she that is the manipulator, moving the relationship forward at an all to quick pace. If Aoyama is the criminal who deserves to be punished, I can see no crimes that he has committed. He has several brief affairs with other women, but I don't see Aoyama as a callous male aggressively seeking sexual gratification. And not once does he lie or break his trust with Asami. I see Aoyama as a victim of his own loneliness, and his punishment is unjust.

As with Aoyama, Asami is also a victim: a victim of abuse. But instead of depressed, lacking in confidence and suicidal, Asami is confident, manipulative and sadistic. I also find it difficult to detest Asami because, like Aoyama, I also fell blindly in love with her portrayal. No doubt she is a sick sadist, but love is blind, and also forgiving.

I'm not sure who or what reeked such terrible misery on Aoyama in the final scenes, but I'll venture to say that it was not Asami.",1101600000,2,1432,4.607843137254902
1626574,4,B00005MKXB,"The plot is simple enough: Widower, father and all-around nice guy Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) decides to remarry. Film producer Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura) offers to audition actresses for a film that may or may not ever be produced, to help his shy friend find a ""nice girl"" in a non-threatening setting. Aoyama is imediately struck by thoughtful, demure Asami (Eihi Shiina), an ex-ballerina with a mysterious past. They strike up a relationship that appears headed for marital bliss...

If you're at all familiar with this film, I don't need to tell you that Aoyama made the WRONG decision, so I'll try to avoid spoilers (almost impossible in discussing this film) and get to the heart of what I loved about ""Audition"":

First of all, the film is extremely well-shot without being intrusive or drawing too much attention to itself. One example is during Asami's audition; the camera begins from behind her shoulder while she's questioned by Yoshikawa, and slowly moves toward Aoyama's face. You can see the attraction just in his facial expressions and it's a subtle, clever way to develop his connection to this alluring (and ultimately dangerous) woman. Director Miike sprinkles these kind of visual flares throughout the film, culminating in nearly 20 minutes of hallucinatory, visual storytelling toward the end of the film. I walked into ""Audition"" with no knowledge of his older movies and almost no expectations, and I was really impressed by how confidently the movie is shot.

The movie also starts with such a languid pace and really takes the time to develop its characters, especially Aoyama and his playful, teasing relationship with his son. Most characters in horror movies are purely cannon fodder. I really grew to like and care about Aoyama -- a simple, shy and loving widower -- and it makes the carnage at the end of the movie that much harder to take.

Finally, the story seems ripped right from the nightmare psyche of the Japanese male mind. Even a casual fan of anime or Japanese films knows that the culture tends to be very mysoganistic. Miike takes the stereotype of the demure, obedient asian girl and uses it as a bludgeon (or an acupuncture needle or fles-and-bone cutting wire, in this case) against the viewer. The message seems to be that even a basically nice guy like Aoyama is complicit in the kind of sexist culture that would great the monster who punishes him at the end of the film. Horror movies should be entertaining first and foremost, but if they also have an element of deep-seeded fear and something to say about societal ills that's a great asset. ""Audition"" succeeds on all counts.

I probably don't need to warn you that some scenes at the end of this movie are EXTREMELY graphic and disturbing... proceed with caution! Gorehounds and fans of other Japanese or Italian horror films may not be shocked, but even as a fan of video nasties I found a couple parts of ""Audition"" to be pretty hard to watch. Unless you're even more jaded than I am, this movie will stay with you for awhile.

My only qualm with the film (and the reason why I gave it four stars instead of five) is that Miike overplays his hand a little with the slow pacing in the beginning. I liked that he took the time to develop these characters, but it's a good 45 minutes into the movie before we even get a glimmer of the horrors ahead, and about an hour before things really get rolling. Viewers will be rewarded for their patience, but that ""Audition"" might get boring for fans of faster paced horror and isn't the kind of film you'll want to watch over and over again.

Still, these are pretty minor quibbles. Great story, strong characters, excellent direction, and some very haunting and disturbing imagery make ""Audition"" one of the best horror films I've seen in years; highly recommended.",1101254400,3,3809,4.788432267884323

1626576,5,B00005MKXB,"In Japan, a constant theme is that of public and private face.  That which you show the world is often quite different from what can be found behind closed doors.  Along with this is a spider web of social roles and expectations of gender, rituals and customs.

""Audition"" takes these roles and customs, and hunts for the darkest possible side, the deepest pool of what lies beneath the surface.  Bondage and rape pornography is popular in Japan (indeed it can be difficult to find non-genre adult magazines/videos) although no one admits to buying it. Mixed violence and sexuality are a bubbling stewpot just beneath the surface of the cool veneer.  Miike Takashi has drawn these societal poisons up from the hidden depths and displayed them for all to see.

To set the stage of this horror show, Miike has populated ""Audition"" with regular people, the people in your neighborhood.  In day to day life, you will see a thousand Shigeharus trundling their way through their salaryman lifestyles, wanting a girl but not really having the time or know-how to get one.  Next to them are a thousand Asamis, shy and unassuming, just seemingly going about their daily business.

After watching Shigeharu and Asamis's cruel love story, it is difficult to pass by those people on the street in exactly the same way.  You wonder which of those girls, with their head down walking quickly to catch the next train, secretly has a man at home tied up in a bag, or knows the chemicals necessary to work her magic on you.

Maybe it is best that the mask of society stays firmly put!",1100476800,2,1567,4.7032967032967035

directed by Takashi Miike

2002, 115 mins.

Meet Shigeharu Aoyama. He is single, and you know it. And Shigeharu knows, too. And his friend, Yasuhisa Yoshikawa, weeeeell, he knows too. Good thing Yasuhisa is in the movie business. 'How about a little audition, Shigeharu? You can choose your favorite chick out of the girls that come auditioning.' Needless to say, our 'hero' accepts this (admit it, strange) offer and after a fairly amusing audition, one candidate remains.

Enter Asami Yamazaki. Gentle, shy, quiet, pretty. Shigeharu's wet dream, so to say. Date date date romantic romantic romantic yatta yatta yatta. But wait, isn't this a Miike film? 'Visitor Q'-Miike? 'Ichi'-Miike? Well, yes. That's the guy. Where's the sickening stuff/ultra-violence then? Well, be patient. It's in there. Somewhere. I could tell you. But I won't. I wouldn't want to spoil everything.

Yup. Audition should be watched blankly. By now, we all know the cover art, maybe the trailer, and everything has been spoiled. Just try to watch it without thinking of everything you might know already, and prepare for this joyride. Enjoy it.

1626590,3,B00005MKXB,"Takashi Miike does a nice job of creating two movies into one here.  Audition goes from being a romantic, light comedy to a scary, torture fest.  It is well acted all around with believable characters.  The relationship between the father and son is touching as are their feelings of loss and death.  The audition sequences are hilarious.  The lighting is moody and effective.  Miike's use of cut to scenes is frightening in several parts and should make you jump.  You will both laugh and flinch during this film.  His use of dream sequences may throw some off but I found all questions to be answered by the end.  To me, the violence wasn't that bad or explicit.  It isn't a perfect film or my favorite by Miike but I would still recommend it.",1097884800,3,745,4.533834586466165
1626591,5,B00005MKXB,"Miike's usual over the top direction takes a back seat to subtle drama and thrills in this horrific Asian Thriller.
The main character is facing loneliness after his wife's death and decides to hold a fake movie audition to screen potential female companionship. The one he falls in love with becomes the source of  major terror for him and his family.

Sounds simple right? Well combined with Asian stereotypical attitudes towards male and female sexual roles, and Asian movie makers fixation with tortue, this movie becomes far from simple. Like I said before Miike takes us on a slow but effective ride for the first 1-1/2 of the movie, Basically showing the coy and romantic side of courtship between the main character and his new companion. But through out this dilberate pace, subtle hints of horror is shown as well as one of the scariest scene of the whole movie, in my opinion. Then at about 30 minutes before the end, Mikke decides to shake things up by displaying absolutely horrific events through ""out of sequence"" scenes that are debatabally realistic or a part of a dream. If you've seen Lynch's Mullholland Drive, then you know exactly what to expect since this movie does the same thing.

To some,The last thirty minutes ruins the movie. But to me it adds a needed intensity that was missing in most of the movie. Instead of the director pacing out his intensity through-out the film he purposefully decides to slow it down only to throw the viewer into a hyperspeed  experience of horror. To me this was an excellent technique. On a side note, if you are not use to disturbing scenes of tortue and horror or not used to Asian horror films, then I would pass this up.",1096848000,7,1685,4.6824324324324325
1626592,3,B00005MKXB,"This movie may tap into the Japanese male psychology, but to outsiders (or at least to me) it didn't really resonate.  The idea of a female who tortures her male suitors promises some interest, but what you get here is disturbing violence that makes Stephen King's ""Misery"" look like a respite care ward.  The first half of the movie is quite enjoyable and coherent. However, it becomes increasingly surrealistic towards the end with dream and reality becoming blurred.  Overall, its compelling in parts, while bizarre in others.  For me, this ends up as a confused and violent spectacle that loses much of its impact when viewed in the context of western culture.",1096675200,2,664,4.901785714285714

Director Takashi Miike's movie starts out like any other run of the mill romantic comedy - milquetoast, sweet and recently widowed Shigeharu (Ryo Ishibashi), his son, Tetsu Sawaki (Shigehiko Aoyama) and housekeeper Rie reside together in a quaint little house with their family dog.  16 year-old Tetsu is old enough to date and suggests dear old dad follow suit, do the same, get married and GET HAPPY!  Shigeharu follows his son's advice and decides it's time to find a new wife.

Enter Shigeharu's movie casting director cum game show host friend Yasuhisa Yoshikawa who suggests advertising over the radio and holding a totally fake audition complete with written compositions to find Shig's dream girl. Innocent Shigeharu blindly and totally falls in love with one girl's composition before even meeting her and it soon becomes unbelievably apparent that there is something wrong with Shig's choice of his dream girl in Asami Yamazaki (Eihi Shiina) .

This is no ordinary Fatal Attraction-style thriller. That is precisely why I enjoyed the film so much. ""Audition"" really can't be compared with anything else that I have viewed thus far except for maybe ""Boxing Helena"" if that gives you any indication of the visual and psychological effects that take place in this film.

""Audition"" also shatters the overused, stereotypical Japanese submissive woman act and lays it on the line between the male and female sexes. The film slowly builds and in the last 20 minutes it will have you on the edge of your seat!!!

1626619,2,B00005MKXB,"This asian romantic comedy-gone-wrong has a couple of neat and compelling ideas yet as a whole ends up being a disappointment. ""Audition"" tries to play with some conventions regarding the oriental female stereotyped role (shy, loyal and submissive women), delivering a strong and unexpected twist by the end of the movie. While this concept is somewhat interesting, the plot moves at a terribly slow and tiresome pace, being nothing more than flat mumbo-jumbo for about 3/4 of the movie.
This effort is forgettable and not very enticing for the most part, presenting a japanese romantic comedy (not very funny though) about a middle-aged man that makes an audition in order to choose an actress for a movie. Simultaneously, he`s also trying to find a girfriend in the process (and he manages to get one). ""Audition"" develops this scenario and suddently delivers a strong twist that provides some shocking and disturbing scenes, giving a new perspective into the protagonist`s recent (and apparently innocent and fragile) girlfriend.
Director Takashi Miike tries to raise subjects like the effects of isolation, the possibilty of love and the old ""looks can be decieving"" idea, yet this cinematic experience is flawed overall and just fails to convince. Sure, ""Audition""`s last 20 minutes are strong and memorable material, still that doesn`t make for the unengaging and bland previous events.

1626620,5,B00005MKXB,"Auteur of more than 50 movies since 1991, Takashi Miike gained an international cult reputation in the year 2000 with the release of Audition.  This film is an examination of the roles of women in modern Japanese society that completely shatters the myth of the Japanese woman being submissive and gentle.
Aoyama is a lonely man who lost his wife seven years ago.  At the urging of his son, Aoyama agrees that it might be time to start seeing other women.  His co-worker proposes a scheme: Set up a fake audition for an upcoming film (Aoyama is a media mogul) inviting several dozen women to try out for the part.  The Audition in question is really an opportunity for Aoyama to be able to select from the pool his ideal woman.  His choice is Asami, a former ballet dancer who seems to fit the profile of ""beautiful, classy and obedient"".
One of the more recurring themes in Audition is loneliness and how it can drive some to the brink of madness and do very questionable things.  Although his co-worker's idea of this fake audition is sleazy and deceptive, Aoyama goes with it anyway.  His personality is anything but mean or sleazy but Aoyama just doesn't possess the requisite social skills with the opposite gender to be able to find a woman in the more traditional way.  His supreme sense of loneliness is what drives him to agree to the scheme.  Asami, the object of his affection, seems even lonelier.  She lives by herself in a tiny apartment and spends all of her time either curled up in bed or sitting motionless on the floor doing absolutely nothing.  Miike's portrayal of this is effectively chilling, a tragic situation of two lovers who, because of their social awkwardness can never completely know each other.
Audition benefits greatly from the strength of the characters that Miike creates.  Asami is a beautiful woman with godly looks who redefines the term ""sweet"" for most of the film.  Once the movie ended however I could barely get myself to look at her image on the DVD box cover without feeling repulsed. That says lots about Miike's power to lull the viewer into a state of shock.  The first  of the film moves slowly and makes us feel for the characters until we get assaulted in the last half hour with image after image of unpleasant gruesomeness (especially for a male viewer).  In yet another example of the unpredictable and unconventional style of director Takashi Miike, the last half hour of the film turns into an exercise of surrealist cinema where things are never what they seem and what is a dream and is not a dream is unclear.  Not many directors would be this good at playing it straight up for so much of the feature's length and then effectively turning it into a nifty David Lynch style head trip towards the end.

1626622,3,B00005MKXB,"I wish I could give this a higher rating because it is quite an original story with some compelling moments, but the fact is the movie falls apart near the end. Briefly, some years after the death of the protagonist's wife, he decides he might want to re-marry and goes about trying to find his ideal mate through auditioning women for a documentary about his trying to find his ideal mate. The woman he ends up falling for turns out to be a nutcase who proceeds to torture him to death ( or at least to an extreme degree of being handicapped).
The problem is that this may not really be happening and may only be a nightmare. The question is, there is really nothing in the set-up to suggest the whole thing isn't happenening exactly as the audience is seeing it, so why suggest it? It is certainly  much more compelling to see this sweet (if creepy/mysterious)girl go off the deep end than to think it isn't really happening. And as you come to the end and she begs for sympathy due to her past, you are expected to forgive her for something she may not have even done.
This brings to mind the film Donnie Darko, where the viewer finds he has been caught up in some alternative reality. Finally, that film probably has more questions than answers, but it contained some weird, internal logic and still left me satisfied. This film left me frustrated because it doesn't resolve the key issue of who this girl is and did these things really happen.
This would have worked better as a straight-ahead thriller. It has a great premise and a really good set-up. The minor detective worked performed by the two main characters unveils some genuinely creepy things about the girl. If the director would have stuck with it to a more logical conclusion it would have been one nifty flick. As it stands, this might be one of the few films I hope Hollywood DOES attempt to re-make.

Though I look forward to forgetting about Audition completely, I cannot fault the quality of the film. The cinematography is stunning and the acting is mostly top notch. But that isn't enough to overcome the almost joyous gore and torture the director subjects us to.
One could argue that Audition is the logical progression expanding on David Lynch and Alfred Hitchcock. But I would argue that there needs to be a limit. While Audition is very well made and intelligent in it's own way, that same quality makes the gore even more unbearable.
If you didn't know that Audition was a horror piece, you might have watched the first hour or so and enjoyed it. But by the end of Audition, I defy anyone to tell me they are glad they saw this film.
Audition owes a lot to Italian horror master Dario Argento - particularly the film Trauma. Like Trauma, Audition has moments that will make you look away.
American horror films have nothing that can compare to this film and other films by Argento. American horror films often give the viewer a chance to feel comfortable. But once Audition gets rolling, I seriously considered stopping the DVD several times.

The premise is simple. Lonely father seeks out his film making buddy to hold a fake Audition for a movie so that he can find a woman that he wants. The woman he chooses turns out to be a bit of a mystery and so he tries to track her past down only to reveal a lot of murder and mayhem along the way. The film then sort of becomes dreamy and we learn through some very confusing sequences that the protagonist has done a lot of bad things off-screen that we did not know about. The ending is torture in every sense of the word and has become legendary in Asian horror cinema.
Many people will not like this movie because it is very slow moving and is often confusing even at the best of times. Towards the end of the film the director brings out a couple of flashback and dream sequences that actually show that our protagonist has been doing a lot of cheating and in many ways is getting what is coming to him, however at the same time what happens goes a way beyond justification and certainly shocks the viewer on all counts. Many viewers will have their eyes firmly shut until the screaming stops.
The imagery and editing in this film are striking. The story is non-linear and this will put many people off but it is done in a David Lynch sort of way. The film must be watched more than once in order to understand the story but this can be a hard task to be put through twice because of its sluggishness at the start and merciless display of horror at the end.
Although never one to tell the audience everything directly Takashi Miike's modern masterpiece still works as a structured film although crudely done but highly original all the same. This is an extremely graphic film that is not for the squeamish by any means but you will be hard pressed to find any femme fetal movie that can match it for horrors.
Men of the world, learn the message well. Keep your thing firmly in your pants with strangers of the opposite sex if you don't want to end up like him!",1073606400,2,2299,4.275229357798165
1626626,5,B00005MKXB,"In the battle between men and women, who will triumph? Who knows, but Japanese director Takashi Miike's film ""Audition"" shines a particularly brutal light on this eternal conflict. Set in Japan, the film takes on additional significance considering what we know about the role of women in that society. I am far not expert on Japanese social roles or mores, but I imagine the stereotypical picture of a Japanese woman as a subservient figure to men is more or less an accurate one. Certainly, gender roles have changed somewhat over the last fifty plus years as Japan rapidly industrialized and assumed a western style political system. One hopes that some progress in this area has taken place there, but I am not so sure after watching this film. Apparently, the idea of a docile, ever ready to serve her partner woman still exerts a strong influence in that country. Otherwise, ""Audition"" would make little sense to its target audience. Completely independent of its effect on Japanese audiences, the movie will send shivers down the spine of every American male.
""Audition"" starts like a Japanese adaptation of some saccharine American family television program. Aoyama, a man whose wife died some years before, desperately seeks female companionship. He works as a television producer, has done an excellent job raising his son, and enjoys bonding with this son on fishing trips. Aoyama, in other words, is a really nice guy. It's just that he is so lonely nowadays since his son is quickly growing up and has less and less time to spend with his father. Aoyama therefore soon faces the prospect of almost total solitude. Our hero opens his heart to his business partner one evening at the local bar, lamenting the changing face of Japanese society that has led to a decline of traditional women--meaning ladies who will stay home and serve their husbands--and a rise in the numbers of modern, cynical women. After commiserating with his buddy, the two come up with an excellent idea. Recognizing that they work in the film business, why not put out an ad for a female part in a new television program while secretly using the audition process as a means of securing the perfect mate for Aoyama? What a brilliant idea! A quick perusal of the resumes beforehand will help narrow down the final choices.
The plan goes off without a hitch, and Aoyama does indeed discover a young woman who he thinks will be his ideal match. Blessed with an ethereal visage and the pretty name of Asami, this young woman seems like a magnificent catch. Aoyama likes the fact that the young woman has undergone a few personal tragedies in her life but emerged stronger because of them. He even seems to like her perpetual shyness, perhaps because it indicates Asami is a traditional woman who will know her place in Aoyama's household. Even after deciding on Asami, our hero hesitates to pursue the relationship. Should he be so forward? Wouldn't it seem indecorous to make such blatant overtures? As Aoyama debates what action he should take a few problems emerge that cast a pall over his choice. His partner encourages him to choose someone else, saying that her ""chemistry"" isn't right and that he has a bad feeling about this young girl. Another possible problem emerges when Aoyama discovers that Asami has no permanent address. Only a phone number links the two potential lovers, but the lonely Aoyama throws all caution to the wind and calls anyway. On the other end of the line sits Asami, who spends a lot of time sitting around a bare room waiting by the telephone. When the phone finally rings, a smile full of sinister implications stretches itself across Asami's mug. She obviously knows her charms worked on the older Aoyama and now she plans on running a show full of painful activities.
No guy wants to think the sort of things that happen to Aoyama could really occur, but it can happen when you start treating people like objects instead of living, breathing beings. And Asami has been treated like an object by every male figure in her life. When it comes time to lash out at her oppressors, Aoyama is there to take the fall. The film becomes problematic when we learn that the main character is actually a nice guy. He loves his son, certainly wouldn't treat a woman badly, and is so lonely that it is tough to not empathize with the desperate measures he takes to find a woman. Miike lessens the likeability of Aoyama during the second half of the film, when we see he has some decidedly unsavory desires of his own, but I still couldn't help but feel sorry for the guy.
Whether the extreme torture session between Aoyama and Asami actually takes place or is a dream really isn't all that crucial to the story line although it certainly achieves a fingernails on the blackboard effect for any male watching it. I think ""Audition"" is a film about how men and women constantly and consistently fail to connect on a personal level. When Aoyama authorizes the audition and reads through the resumes looking for the perfect woman, he assigns a host of assumptions to Asami based on what HE wants in a woman. Whether she will fulfill these expectations in person is secondary to what the man wants. Watch the movie, not just for the gore scenes, but also to view a social critique about gender roles and miscommunication.",1073260800,214,5321,4.759740259740259
1626627,5,B00005MKXB,"The quiet unassuming opening of this film quickly and inexorably turns into a nightmare. A 40-ish executive, recently widowed, is nagged by his son, friends and business partner to get on with his life and begin dating again. Because he is involved with film production, a colleague suggests he hold an audition, whereby he may meet a match among the candidates. The ensuing audition is by nature a cruel but funny affair. One jewel does sparkle in our protagonist's eye, and the old adage ""be careful what you wish for"" here applies tenfold. What the viewer has been watching soon becomes something very different, hallucinatory, violent and pretty damn scary. If you watch this alone late at night, you may have trouble sleeping afterwards. And even if you see this with a crowd in broad daylight ... Beware! Stay with the slow beginning, the subtext for the characters is set up here, and repeated viewings will bear this out. Make no mistake, this is a horror film. It is also a rewarding and frightening experience, well acted and directed.",1069977600,3,1045,4.843575418994414
1626628,5,B00005MKXB,"I prefer films, whether they be horror or psychological thrillers (and this one is sort of both), where the suspect or villain isn't beyond human and just conveniently evil for the sake of an escalating level of suspense and to draw a close to the mystery.  They're more realistic in the sense that the 'bad guys' are depicted as individuals with their own thoughts, perceptions and personality, etc, and they respond to everything around them in their own way and have been affected by specific experiences and encounters from their past which have molded their overall perspective on the film scenario.  When you have a more profound understanding and can feel compassion for the misunderstood antagonist - it makes them all the more fearful because they're more human and they are simply acting upon their own instincts, motivation and desire.  Since you understand this and you may even relate and have a connection to the killer, in a way you want them to get away with what they're doing as though you were doing it yourself.
This film really touched me because I felt incredibly connected to Asami and the issues of isolation and loneliness addressed in this film.  In fact, I felt sorry for her as much as I thought she was foolish for getting herself involved such a predicament in the first place.  The whole situation could've been avoided realistically, but then when you consider Asami's devastating past and her current grief-stricken, oppressive lifestyle it makes a lot more sense.  The torture scene then seems even almost romantic.
Because of this film's complex storyline and themes, I think it stands out on its own as more of a thriller and tragic romance than a horror film.  I think it delivers a powerful message which is bound to touch most of us with pondering doubts and questions regarding our own identity, what we look for in relationships, and how we perceive culture and tradition.",1069804800,2,1913,4.867692307692308
1626639,5,B00005MKXB,"I saw this at the theatre when it first came out.  I arrived early only to find people leaving the show before it was over, telling me to get my money back.  Of course...  that only heightened my anticipation of this film, of which i previously knew nothing about.
The first hour of the film was slow, like ""if it were on t.v. i'd change the channel"" kind of slow, although the photography and overall sense of design was top-notch. Slowly the whole film started to twist itself into a bizarre depravity, creeping up on you like an altered state of conciousness,  and i was hooked.  I didn't find anything overly shocking or gratuitous about this film, in fact i found a deep sense of beauty and brilliance on the part of the director for being able to flawlessly morph both the story and the viewers emotional attachment, to the point where fifteen minutes before the resolution a dozen people got up and walked out of the theatre disgusted. I, on the other hand, felt privledged to have experienced a great work of art.
However, after the film I looked up some reviews, and was shocked on how everyone else COMPLETELY missed the point by turning the premise of the movie into ""a statement on the objectification of women in Japan"".  I can assure you that this movie has no political agenda whatsoever.  It's as if anytime a director makes something that doesn't fit our standards of political correctness, then he must be trying to expose us to the injustices that exist outside of our perfect p.c. world...  gimme a break.
This film is a brilliantly realized work from one of the great directors of our time.  It's the kind of film that demands a response, and will stay with you for long after the credits roll.  Highly recommended.",1066003200,5,1736,4.588996763754046
1626640,4,B00005MKXB,"Disturbing is too kind of a word for this film, yet in its way Audition works as a shock-thriller meant to sear itself into your brain.
Suppose your wife dies, and you're getting old and lonely.  Do you hit the bar scene to find an annoying, giggly, snobby girlfriend (watch the film...)?  No!  You get your movie producer friend to set up a fake movie so you can screen the young women auditioning for the lead role as prospective wives.  Perhaps what later ensues is simply turnabout for fair play...
Everyone has a ""bad feeling"" about Aoyama's choice, and for good reason.  Demure little Asami spends her free time at home, sitting hunched-over and drooling while waiting for the phone to ring... with a large, bulging sack in the background.
The film does explore very well the fears of men in Japan today while at the same time looking hard at and twisting the role of the ""obedient"" and proper traditional Japanese woman that Aoyama so desired.  Looked at from a cross-cultural perspective, the film makes much more sense--which only heightens the horror and disturbing nature of its message.
I would wonder (or perhaps worry) about those who claim to truly love this film, but at the same time those who enjoy psycho thrillers or like to be disturbed will find this movie worth a watch.

1626642,2,B00005MKXB,"Seven years after his wife Yoko died, the middle-aged Shigeharu Aoyama is encouraged by his son Shigehiko and his video production colleague Yasuhisa Yoshikawa to get remarried.  Aoyama is picky, though.  He wants someone who has special talents, such as dancing, singing, and being able to play the piano, using Yoko as an example.  He says ""Certain training gives people confidence.  A lack of confidence brings unhappiness.""
The solution is to use an old romantic triangle script as a ruse and to audition women.  Based on the interviews, Aoyama can choose one of them.  He is taken by one Asami Yamasaki, a 24-year old girl whose aspiring career as a ballerina was nipped in the bud by an injury at eighteen.  She is beautiful, classy, and obedient, but something about Asami makes Yoshikawa nervous.  ""Something chemical.  I just don't like her,"" he says.  Not only that, but there is nobody who can vouch for her employment history, nor anyone who knows her.  Aoyama is undeterred and proceeds to meet her.  It turns out that he should have heeded his friend's advice.  However, the montage of questions posed by Yoshikawa and the aspiring talents respond to his questions or demonstrate their abilities is a humorous moment.
There are other side characters stricken with loneliness.  One of Aoyama's female colleagues clearly has a crush on him, but he is too blind to notice.  Rie, the woman who does odd chores for him, isn't too happy with her married life.  Yoshikawa puts it well when he tells Aoyama early on that the whole of Japan is lonely, and ""it's like a survival game or a game of torture.""  For that reason, Japan is finished, he says.
I was quickly taken with the drawn-out leisurely pace of a study of loneliness, but the gruesome final quarter of the movie ruined what could have potentially been a new classic.  And I rarely take points off for an uneven switch, but this was way too much.",1061424000,3,1914,4.748484848484848

I saw this movie on a movie screening at Rockport college of arts while I was getting my masters degree on dramatic filmmaking. I saw the ad for the audition, wich by the way, was completly diferent than the dvd cover and I thought it was some artistic film from Japan worth of watching.
I sat through the first 50 minutes of the film and I was very enetrtained by the slow paced love gone extremely bad love story. This first 50 where very visual and poetic, the characters were deep and thought provoking and the cinematography and the art direction were just stoning...then something when incredible wrong...this beautiful and slow paced movie was changing into a dark and depressing vortex of hallucinations, psychodelia and disturbing imagery and I had no clue of what was going on...then...for my confused attention to the film, the ending arrived......JESUS, MARY AND JOSEPH was I shocked!!!
The Audition is not the most disturbing film in the world, but it's ending is very visual, graphic and dicturbing...I mean, I was pretty inpressed by it...and more than 80% of the theatre was quite upset and disgusted by it.-
Probably, the reason why I was so impressed and disturbed by it was that I walk into the film without knowing what I was about to watch. Nobody told me anything by it, I didn't knew it was suposed to be a ""horror"" film by any chance, so my mind wasn't expecting anything...So, I guess that if I happened to know what I was about to watch, I probably wouldn't like the movie ...Why? this is not your typical horror splatter film...the first 50 minutes of the movie has hardly any blood or disturbing imagery of any kind, but a slow, deep and thoughtfull sad love story about a widowed man trying to find a partner...so after the first 50..that when hell really break loose...and the ebding will disturb you so much, you won't believe it!...believe me...it was crude and shoking as hell!
Not the best movie I ever seen, but a great oportunity to watch a diferent film... and also pretty good!....so if you're a gore fan, fast forward the the first 60 minutes and you will find one of the must disturbing scenes in film history...get it and don't tell anyone what it's about...you will enjoy watching their horribly surprised faces",1060214400,3,2791,4.8045738045738045
1626645,5,B00005MKXB,"You've probably heard that ""Audition"" is extremly violent - and that's true. But what makes this violence so disturbing is the tenderness that lies in this movie's heart.
Basically, it's a story about two lonely people, in a lonly society (as one character notes - ""All of Japan seems lonely""). These two people try to make a connection, and each of them fails miserably. The man find it hard to see past his ideals about what a woman should be - and misses the person in front of him, while the woman needs, probably because of her troubled childhood, demands total love.
Out of the failure of the relationship comes a climax, which is very brutal and graphic (I've found it hard to watch - and I'm a med school student and am used to the dissections...). The fact that you come to care so much about these characters, make the violence seem human, and not horror movie cartoon gore.
A spacial notice should be made to the work done by the lead actrice, Eihi Shiina. It's her first time on-screen, and acording to the director's note, a large part of her acting in the latter part of the film came from improvisation. Perhaps she was working on her inner demons, but her performance is hard to forget.

Shigeharu Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) is a bachelor who decides to hold fake auditions for a movie he never intends to make. Instead he uses these as an opportunity to build up a portfolio of women who have the potential to become the future Mrs Shigeharu. But Aoyama's search ends quickly when he comes across the file of 24 year old ex-dancer Asami Yamasaki (Eihi Shiina), whose promising career came to a premature end at 18 because of hip problems.
Asami strikes a chord with Aoyama at her audition, and they go out on a date. Asami appears to be the perfect woman; but unfortunately his focus veers away from the movie and onto her. Of course Aoyama's collegues can sense bad juju radiating from Asami: an actress with no agent, contacts or associates- in fact nobody appears to have heard of her. In fact Asami has a traumatic past which has scarred her for life and below the surface of that pretty face.... you can guess the rest. But the rest is a big surprise. Trust me.
AUDITION is brilliantly filmed, intelligent, dark, funny with some rather unsettling scenes including a grisly garotting, impromptu tongue piercing, and an extremely sadistic acupuncture session. But I won't spoil all the gruesome details, you'll have to see for yourself. AUDITION is a true masterpiece but not recommended for the squeamish.

Takashi Miike's movie, 'The Audition', is about the relationship between a man who has lost his wife seven years ago and a young peculiar woman whom he gets to know in an audition he organises for the sake of finding a potential wife. The beginning of the movie reveals the life of the man and his son, in a family context. Everything is so peaceful and quiet that you doubt whether it's the correct film that you put on. But, yes, it's the right film.
As we see scenes where the previous life of the young woman is revealed, the tension suddenly forms and mounts. Despite his friend's warnings, the man decides to take his relationship with the woman further. They see each other more frequently. And the rest of the movie is totally insane; differently insane, though.
The editing and montage of the film has been perfectly done; the ideas are clearly expressed, and visual cues are provided in all cases, where one might need to remember a particular previous scene. The movie, in general, is not  a horror movie. It is actually anything other than horror movie, for it depicts sincere family relations, love, dismal life conditions.

As other people have stated, Audition is a movie about sex roles in Japan.  It is also a movie about love-blindness.

When he is going out with the girl of his dreams he is in love, and his mind chooses not to see the bad things.  He thinks he has a pleasant conversation with her, drives her home, and drops her off on the street.  In reality, she tells him about the abuse, and then takes him back to her apartment where he discovers that she keeps her last boyfriend inside a bag (sans an ear, his tongue, and a bunch of fingers) and only feeds him her own vomit.

1626660,2,B00005MKXB,"I love horror movies, especially intelligent, subtle ones. I kept hearing about this movie from people who compared it to Ringu. After seeing it, I'm not sure how it earned that comparison.
I love the main concept of Audition, the story is a critique of sex roles in Japan. The film is very well made, from a technical standpoint. The sets and lighting start out very ordinary, and slowly get more extreme. Same goes with the camera work. So all the pieces of a really great movie are there.
But the ending is horrible. I have no problem with the violence, and there's a surprisingly small amount of gore considering the situation. But the film takes what should have been creepy and understated and shoves it in your face. It's as if the filmmaker was afraid that we're all too stupid to get his point. And although the movie's theme was made totally clear, the plot got sloppy. The story just dissolves into a mess of relatively dull hallucinations and flashbacks, occasionally punctuated by severe torture. I think that throwing together a bunch of dreamy scenes is a cop out ending. I guess some people see that kind of thing and call it art, but I'm not one of them.

I'll just say that if you like such controversial works as Roman Polanski's Repulsion and David Lynch's Blue Velvet, you'll probably like Audition, which, in my humble opinion, ranks alongside those films as a classic of (very) uneasy suspense and borderline surrealism.  Well worth owning on DVD, since it almost demands multiple viewings. In fact, I'm surprised that few of the reviews here have remarked on the tantalizing ambiguities and odd contradictions that pop up toward the end.

1626673,5,B00005MKXB,"First of all, this was my first introduction to Asian films, everything before whether it be Giallos (Bird with the Crystal Plumage, Opera, House with Windows that Laughed, What Ever Happened to Solange), or Film Noirs (The Third Man, Mildred Pierce, Memento), or 70's Exploitation (Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Black Christmas) seemed to teach me a lot less about the visual effectiveness a director can have on a film and its audience. The closest experience I had had to this sort of thing beforehand was Requiem for a Dream, and even that didn't seem to get to me as much as this film. If you want to understand Film Aesthetics study asian movies, the more contemporary the better. There will always be those critics who say the Japanese revolutionizing film ended with Kurosawa, those people have not seen Audition. So if you want to study film or study film and become a filmmaker pick up an asian flick. Audition, Battle Royale, Ringu, The Eye, Dark Water, Chaos, Kairo, Kakashi. With the recent resurfacing of horror and original ideas coming out of Japan, China and Korea, even if you aren't paying attention to these places you should already have figured out by now that even Hollywood is catching on. Dreamworks remade Ringu into The Ring, Wes Craven has plans to remake Kairo (the story of a live webfeed which broadcasts dead people who are seen still alive) into Pulse (the English translation of the word), Tom Cruise's production company has bought the rights to remake The Eye (the story of a girl who can see the dead after she gets a cornea transplant), there are also plans to remake the Korean film Cure (about a killer who hypnotizes people into commiting murders for him). Audition is an example of one of those movies that, while brilliant aesthetically and story-wise, its just too dark to be make it as an American Film, as is Battle Royale (a high school class is transported to an island where they are given 3 days to kill each other until only one people remains, or they all die). There is a lot of art and money in this medium, The Ring was the third remake of  Ringu, there was also a sequel, a prequel, two tv shows, three made for tv movies, the book series and the comic book series. But Audition stands alone, its too good for a sequel, too proud for a franchise, and (I'm sorry to say this) just too good to be an American movie.",1041638400,9,2364,4.601895734597156
1626674,5,B00005MKXB,"I just rented Audition a couple days ago, it's still here, and I will probably watch it at least 4 times by the time I have to return it. Then I plan on buying it when I get a DVD player.
Ordinarily I am not even that much into ""thriller"" or ""horror"" types of movies. Seen a bunch, didn't get much out of them. Thus it's not really my preferred genre. After seeing Audition it turns out that the only reason I'm not too into this genre is because none of the other examples are as nightmarishly believable as Audition. Eihi Shiina taps into the vein of evil like no one else I have ever seen.
If I were to sit here and try to think of my favorite movies I rented in 2002 I'd certainly end up forgetting lots of great ones until 5 minutes after I submit my review. Thus I won't do that. But I will indeed say that Audition is one of the most perfect movies I have ever seen.
I think the best way I can review and recommend this movie is to say nothing about it. I just don't want to give anything away. I want the viewer to go blindly into this movie, and then walk away afterwards with the feeling of curdled blood clogging their arteries.
My advice: Either go rent this, buy it, or rent it then buy it. Learn as few specifics about it as possible and just pop it into your VCR/DVD player and let it crawl inside you and linger in the regions of human consciousness that are best left dormant.

Apart from the original Russian ""Solaris,"" and the German mini-series ""Das Boot,"" I can count the number of films I've read the subtitles to on one hand, and they've mostly been by Kurosawa.
I purchased this movie purely on the strength of the reviews I read of it here on Amazon, the first time I've done so. ""Audition"" seems to elicit extreme reactions from reviewers, like Kubrick's 2001, you'll either love it or hate it... and as you can see from the 5 Stars I gave, I'm in the former category. But just so you know, my taste in film runs from, A Man For All Seasons, to the original Halloween, via the aforementioned 2001, and the original Dirty Harry!
I won't go into too much plot detail, others have done so, suffice to say it's not terribly original; boy meets girl, boy falls in love, boy loses girl, girl reappears, transformed from meek and mild child-woman, to messed-up psycho-slasher with an extensive collection of acupuncture needles!
The first half of the film plays out as a gentle romantic comedy. Even with reading the subtitles, and missing the undoubtedly subtle Japanese cultural references, I was smiling and chuckling as our hero, Aoyama, met, under slightly dishonest circumstances to be sure - the ""auditions"" of the title - and then started to woo, the girl of his dreams, Asami.
But all, of course, is not as it seems. Her background is hazy, to say the least, but still, he is smitten, and plunges headlong into the relationship, only to have her disappear without trace after they have made love for the first time.
He sets out to track her down, and slowly but surely his world disintegrates into a living nightmare of disturbing revelations and strange, dreamlike, meetings. This all builds inexorably to the ""messed-up psycho-slasher"" finale, with its extended scenes of fairly graphic torture, which, to be honest, COULD have been much worse! The reasons for all the horror goes back to Asami's childhood, and is explained in a couple of, brief though explicit, scenes of sadomasochistic child abuse!
This film is not for everyone by any means, but it is one, I feel, that will reward repeated viewing. The performances, cultural subtleties aside, are warm and naturalistic, the story is solid, but it's the direction/editing that drives the whole thing, relentlessly, to its Grand Guignol conclusion. Certain scenes are repeated/expanded upon, seen from different perspectives, then repeated again `til you're not quite sure what is ""real"" and what is imagined on the part of the protagonists. The final moments have an ethereal dreamlike quality... a stunning conclusion to one hell of a ride!",1038700800,3,2738,4.928571428571429

The real problem is that the violence and gore is plainly gratuitous and beyond.  Yes, certain maladjusted fools get their bit of thrill by hyping things that they know is inherently offensive (in fact specifically because of it), but the truth is, this is bottom-of-the-barrel horror cinema.  Those who genuinely enjoy it (more specifically, its final torture sequence) on any level above that of detached slasher-film thrills, likely need help.  Those who believe the film and its disgusting visuals are really about ""sexual politics"" or any other innocuous-sounding ""justified cause"", have issues and may well be beyond it.
I love Japanese cinema, and intelligent thrillers.  This is neither...just shock-value garbage that passes itself off as avant-garde.

1626678,4,B00005MKXB,"Audition (1999)
Ryo Ishibashi, Eihi Shiina, Jun Kunimura; dir. Takashi  Miike.
A widower of 7 years, Shigeharu Aoyama (Ishibashi) starts looking again.  Reluctant to use the normal channels (understandably, in my view) he has a friend set up a phony audition for a TV film, as a way of interviewing 30 eligible young women.  The strategy works.  He meets Asami Yamazaki (Shiina) - and she meets his requirements.  She is demure, sensitive, educated, with a mature, somewhat pessimistic sensibility, to which Aoyama is drawn.  She is responsive to his interest.  And then it all goes horribly wrong.  The film isn't exactly a horror movie, though.  It's more of a short story which goes gorily surreal.  The first three-quarters or so are shot at a leisurely pace, and constitute an engaging investigation of Aoyama's situation, with a good cameo by his cynical, ever-smoking friend (Kunimura), whose uneasy warnings fall on deaf ears, even though Aoyama has similar intuitions himself.  The film is cinematically well-made, although a more rigorous approach to framing and composing every shot would have been an alternative approach.  Director Miike is apparently a busy man, however, and perhaps he was in a bit of a hurry.  Anyway, the light comedy seeps out of the film, continuity and point of view are fragmented and the spooky moments mount up (including one real eye-opener) as we follow a somewhat tortuous progress to the torturous finale where Aoyama is confronted by the monster Asami.  The ending may have a little too much grue for some.  Extreme depictions of violence seem to be a Japanese national characteristic (probably the direct consequence of their excessive politeness and unnaturally low crime rate, which would seem to stimulate these fermented fantasies).  Despite the weirdness, however, ""Audition"" retains psychological plausibility, particularly with regard to Asami.  Her character confronts the viewer.  We are given no explanation of her motives - beyond a fairly superficial hint at abuse as a child.  The suggestion that she is taking revenge on behalf of Japanese women for their treatment by the patriarchy is obviously ham-fisted (and besides, one could argue that in Japan everyone is oppressed by society) - but in a strange way there is something to it.  Does Asami have some kind of grounds for her revenges?  Is Aoyama guilty?  For manipulating women?  Or just being a complacent bourgeois male?  These notions at least get a toehold; they wouldn't if the roles were reversed.  Perhaps we tend to cut villainous females a little more slack than their male counterparts.  Overall, a good film, provocative and worth seeing, but not for the faint of stomach.",1038268800,9,2699,5.147126436781609

To me, Japanese horror is mostly not very graphical, and not much bloodshed, but it will chill you to the bone.
Like this movie, I must admit the first 3/4 of the movie is really slow, but the uncomfortable, sick atmosphere just build along the movie.  At the final final part, which is the most horrific scene, may churn your stomach upside down.
Next choice: Ring the movie in Japanese version - a truly horror moive without a single drop of blood, but still can triple your heart beat.
The reasons that I don't give a 5 stars for this movie - the female lead is actually quite ... ugly.  And I think the ending can be more violent (I am a sicko!!)",1035849600,2,811,4.38
1626680,4,B00005MKXB,"This film made my stomach turn and heart beat faster. I've never seen pain and torture portrayed so graphically, yet so... enlighteningly onscreen.
The film starts out as an ordinary tale of a widowed film producer who is encouraged by his son to date and marry again. He uses film auditions as an alibi for him to pick an ideal woman. And falls immediately under one girl's spell. This is developed as a traditional story, and makes up 2/3 of the movie. Then the film does one of the most insane 180 degrees, as the main protagonist finds out the horrible, scarred past of his new girlfriend, and is exposed to an unbelievably graphic series of tortures put upon by her. The last 30 minutes of the film are nightmarishly surreal. I thought I couldn't finish the movie because of its harsh violence, but I could not let myself not watch it, because under the context, this violence was necessary. The filmmaker completely subverts all our expectations and turns what started out as an ordinary, machismo-driven film into an exact opposite: one of the most scathing and scary cautionary tales ever on the cruel and flippant male sexual politics. It can even be called a feminist statement, as long as the psycopath girl is viewed as the avenger femme fatale. It's a brilliant move. The violence is real, but it's tempered by shots of tremendous poetry and lyricism.
The psychological acuity of the director Miike is amazing, and the surreal sequences that mix real events and the subconscious of the characters have the true, sublime power of a real, horrifying dream. I haven't seen dream sequences handled with such agility since David Lynch's best work. There are loose ends and things left unclear, but it is obvious that is the intention of the filmmaker. Only after viewing the film did I realize the film was based on a story by Ryu Murakami, a postmodern Japanese writer of immense talent who does not yield easily to the readers' expectations.
This is not a film you can easily love, but nonetheless, it is a remarkable testament that a film can still be made without compromising its integrity and honesty. And it's not a surprise to me that such a film is a product from outside of Hollywood. Wa-y outside.",1035158400,,2216,4.728682170542636

Most of the characters aren't developed enough, and the life story of asami is too vaguely laid out to suspend disbelief and buy into what's happening.  What causes her to so totally lose it?  We're not given enough to go on.  She seems to be gloomy and tortured, but what in her past, other than the vague pictures we're given, has moved her down this road?  It would be easier to identify with her if we had a better idea of what caused her to snap.  As it stands, she simply seems repulsive.  Aoyama is better portrayed as somebody blinded by love to obvious hints of danger, but too much of the cast gets short shrift.  The jolting reversal of tone late in the movie isn't too unusual in japanese films, but in most cases it's set up better than it is here, and the gratuitous violence appears not as a result of foregoing events but as something totally out of place.",1033171200,4,1018,4.349206349206349

DVD/VHS
10/10
Japanese with English Subtitles
This film is un-rated and contains graphic violence.
I can't decide which director would enjoy watching this film best: Clive Barker, Dario Argento, or Alfred Hitchcock.  All these directors I appreciate for their talents in darkness whether it is extreme or subtle.  Takashi Miike has accomplished drawing the audience in slowly with subtle and well-made storytelling that turns into a roller coaster ride of white-knuckle extreme terror. At first it seems as though Miike is presenting at straightforward  family drama. Husband/father Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi) widowed seven years prior decides under the gentle and humorous direction of his son (Tetsu Sawaki) it is time to remarry.  Simple? Well, no. Aoyama's drinking buddy Yoshikawa (Jun Kunimura) decides to hold a fake audition for a film in search of the perfect woman.  The editing during this sequence has a natural rhythm and humor that highlights the  whole facade as the numbers of unusual women are asked a series of questions. Enter Asami (Eihi Shiina), a former ballet dancer, who seems to have suffered in her past.  Aoyama falls in love quickly, and against the warnings of Yoshikawa moves forward in quest for the perfect mate,"" a compliant woman is best.""  Takashi quickly cuts to a still shot of Asami, sitting on the floor her head bent down, her hair falling over her head so we can't see her face, a telephone in the foreground, and a very large canvas bag.  Throughout  soundtrack is very well done and there are  very different types of music to fit each scene. At this point, however, there is total silence. Long enough to create tremendous tension.  Miike takes the audience with Aoyama as hints Asami's of psychotic disintegration almost subliminally sneak into the narrative. At the midway point we become  just as disoriented as Aoyama.  Is love blind and deaf? In a series of well-edited montage scenes we are shown previous shots of conversations with different dialog, or simply, more direct.  Asami seems to be disclosing all of her painful and tragic past. Or is she? Do we really listen when we are in love, or do we simply hear what we want to hear?  Asami's lifelong forced submission and compliance have been driven so deep they boomerang ..standing these traits on their heads. I enjoyed Takashi's sense of direction. The film flows, picking up pace towards the final scenes effectively employing the lost  art of giving the audience the maximum amount of tension and fear while revealing little. By then  it is too late. Throw in a couple of misplaced acupuncture needles, dismembered limbs, three fingers and a tongue. Well, you can imagine the scenarios. Or can you?  This is a slow burn, with a great pace and it really pays off. Not for the squeamish, faint of heart or anyone who is afraid of needles. Deeper, deeper..deeper.",1032652800,25,2913,4.9649484536082475
1626694,5,B00005MKXB,"As many other people cover the story line, I will quickly focus on the actual DVD presentation for people who would like to know.
First we get a fully animated menu (Well designed) focusing on the Audition tapes, nice to leave on in the background before watching the film, each transition between chapters menu, audio/subs (Subs are well translated, removable and yellow making them easy to read) setup and special features plays an amount of noise and a quick snippet from the film (Very nice).
Audio quality varies, 5.1 (Japanese) is not needed for a film of this type, but it brings great clarity to the score and dialogue. ""kiri kiri kiri.""
Picture quality is average at best, it is quite dark so brightness needs to be upped, but generally the picture displays limited to no wear, pixellation is non existent and sharpness is good for a NON anamorphic image. There is some background noise in certain scenes, but it does not distract from the viewing experience. Some edge enhancement is present in brightly lit areas, and venitian blinds tend to alias in office settings. This might sound messy, but honestly this is the best this movie will look on DVD for English speaking backgrounds.
NOTE: There has been a new 16:9 R4 version of Audition released, but this print is the same master used for the TARTAN UK version which is bad compared to the R1 CHIMERA release.
All in all this R1 version of Audition is the BEST out on the market at the moment. The Japanese version is a tad better but has no English subs and English subs are needed for this film, if you can't understand Japanese because the film is dialogue driven.
Extras are minimal but interesting. The final 30 minutes audio commentary with Miike is very interesting to listen too.
Audtion is pure Miike excellence... Not for the faint of heart, as the unrated version is quite gruesome in some parts. Miike is still my favorite director, nearly all of his films are fantastic and I am a huge fan of Audition.",1030924800,,1979,4.673352435530086

Parts in the ending re-evaluate conversations which have suddenly changed and the main character having visions of his torturers victims.  And you think if he knew all this why did he want to marry her?
The torture scene is not completely horrific but the lead actress does play the ending superbly and you can feel her insanity.  Without her the torture scene would just be another bit of gore.
The movie does have its endearing moments such as the father and son scenes.  However you never feel that much sympathy for the wife-seeker, even at the end.

The director is able to play with your emotions as few other artists are able, regardless of artistic genre.  If you haven't seen the movie yet, don't read these reviews - they can only diminish or intellectualize the experience.
I don't think it's fair to compare this movie to other horror movies, as some of the other reviews have done, or to question the plausibility of an ex-ballerina going postal, which isn't the point.  Rather, it's a sick joke being played on the audience.  Miike shows amazing range as he's able to create a perfectly acceptable, even compelling romantic comedy, and then slips the rug from under the audience, turning it into something so much more horrific than any straight horror movie could be.  I remember a NY Times review, which (favorably) compared this movie to Maria suddenly joining the Nazis somewhere around the Sound of Music's intermission, than going after the van Trapp family with a machine gun...
The movie was made with great craft and restraint (two words not to be associated with other Miike flicks), and as such bears repeated viewings.  However I think the main reason to own this movie is to take it out of the somewhat creepy dvd case, lend it to a friend without offering a work of explanation, and seeing what their reaction is.",1025395200,,1492,4.785992217898833

1626716,5,B00005MKXB,"Friends, I am not one who scares easily.  Sure I have my favorite cheese-horror flicks just like every genre-hound.  Be advised, however, this ain't one of em.  Like almost every review I've ever read of this puppy, I'll tell you right now that the less you know about this film going in the better you'll be able to appreciate it.  Granted, the first hour is kind of pacey and will leave you wondering where exactly the film is going.  The second hour is where the weirdness begins.  Now a lot of people have refered to this film as Lynchean and I can see their point somewhat.  The film's latter half includes many hallucinatory sequences and leaves it more or less up to you to decide what is real and what is fantasy.  The line is blurred about as much as it can be, so the answers are not easily forthcoming.  This, naturally, puts ""Audition"" in the same league as ""Lost Highway"" or ""Mulholland Drive.""  I think, however, that the film also stands out as a prime example of what I refer to as Polanskiesque.  These are stories which draw you in with innocuous, though well crafted, scenes and scenarios gradually luring you into a false sense of security (along with the main character) until the trap eventually springs and it is too late to run and there is nowhere to hide.  The plus side of this technique is that it allows for a great deal of identification with the main character, the one through whom we experience the film, and makes their struggles our struggles and allows us to more thoroughly share in their destiny.  The down side is that most films simply are not made this way anymore and, as such, many people have forgotten how to relax and enjoy them.  This is a very literate, deliberate, pacey film that is meant to be enjoyed sans interruptions.  Watch it with the lights off and the phone off the hook (just make sure a friend or two will be home that night).  I got the chance to see this movie this week and it kept me awake for about three hours after I normally go to bed.  It is just that creepy!  Enjoy it, don't ruin the experience by reading too many of these reviews before hand, but be warned:  This film's final reel pulls no punches and it will rock you hard!",1024012800,4,2199,4.411910669975186
1626717,2,B00005MKXB,"This is a clever and often stylish Japanese variant on the Fatal Attraction genre.  Aoyama is a widower who loses his wife early in the movie.  Prodded by his son to remarry several years later, and aided by a colleague at work, he stages a mock audition to meet a companion.  He meets and chooses Asami (a pensive, pale Eihi Shiina) and for the first 1/2 of the film it seems like a heart-warming love story.  But Asami has a scarred heart and dark secrets...
This is a really good movie on many fronts.  It magnifies all the perils of dating 1,000 fold, and as a reviewer below pointed out, cleverly plays around with the fact that we don't another person as much as we'd like to believe, especially early in the relationship.  Another good choice on the director's part was to make Aoyama a pitiable, sympathetic character.  In Fatal Attraction, Michael Douglas's character was an outright jerk.  In Audition, you actually care for Aoyama, who's just a grief-stricken mid-aged Japanese worker bee who seeks companionship- the same thing that motivates people to advertise in the personals.  Unlike what is the case in many American horror films, there's no lame attempt to cast the character's sufferings as justified, the villain as forgivable, or the acts themselves as some odd form of revenge.  They're bad things that happened to somebody who didn't deserve them, Miike therefore making the central character even more sympathetic and identifiable to the audience.
Asami's sudden change into coldblooded would-be-murderer seems a little implausible.  Though of course the hidden inner identity is key to the movie, the extreme differences between the character in the movie's first half and the second don't quite jibe.  While Miike avoids most of the horror-movie cliches, the naive central character is still in there-- the danger for Aoyama becomes pretty obvious later on as he uncovers clues, yet he seems almost oblivious.  There were also some technical issues-- the sound was kinda lousy, with some kinda background fuzz at times, and the scene transition wasn't always smooth.  Still, all in all, this is an interesting movie that provides a taste of something quite different to those of us used to the same-old same-old Hollywood fare.",1024012800,6,2254,5.008042895442359

1626719,5,B00005MKXB,"To simply reiterate the storyline of AUDITION would be an injustice ... This is a film that challenges and excites so many different emotions in the viewer, it really should be seen ... a few times .... The plot follows a good-natured but lonely widower ( Ryo Isibashi ), and his search to remarry .... He has a good job ( he works in the film industry), and a very good relationship with his son ( and dog :), yet the seven years that have passed since the death of his wife have left him alone and empty ... At the suggestion of a coworker / friend, he stages an ""audition"" for a new film project ... What none of the applicants realize is that the ""new"" film project is actually an old rejected script that is being used as a vehicle for our lonely widower to meet a perspective wife ..... What makes AUDITION a little difficult to reveiw is the fact that, more than with most films, too much info and knowledge of the plot will take away from the fun ... But that's not to say that this film isn't worth seeing many times: it IS ... I have seen it 3 times now, and I look forward to seeing it a fourth ... ok, back to the film ...Eihi Shiina is applicant #28, an extremely beautiful and shy 24 year woman ... Did I mention beautiful ??? How about mysterious ??? ... Above all, she is intelligent, with a very impressive screen presence ... And much to the delight of both Ryo and Eili, they hit it off ... So much so that our long suffering widower's flame for life is rekindled in such a way, his verve for dating and happiness outshines even his teenage son's ... At his point in the film, the story and tone turn 180 degrees ... .... What follows is so harrowing and so disturbing, and with each passing scene we the viewer think back to the set-up audition and inital giddiness of our happy couple as almost an entirely different film ... But it WORKS ... Not only that, but the way the film spins out of control only adds to it's overall impact, and leaves us feeling THAT MUCH MORE horrified .... At this point I will mention the film debut of actress Eihi Shiina, who give a performance nothing short of stunning and unforgettable ... It is very rare that an individual can induce feelings of such horror, yet leave the viewer feeling saddness and pity to the point of tears ... I can't say enough about this brilliant young actress ... While I highly recommend this film, I must say that if child abuse, amputation, or sadism and torture might leave you feeling offended or queasy, do not see this film ... But if you prefer an experience to a ""movie"", I can't recommend AUDITION enough ... It might have taken 40 years, but I think we've found someone who can give Norman Bates a run for his money :) ...",1023494400,4,2717,4.2776699029126215

7945649,3,B00005MKXB,". . . and, knowing the ghastly power that was to be exhibited near the end, I confess that I watched in a rather detached way. I tried watching this film again recently and gave in to the impulse to turn the film off at the scene where the twisted ballet teacher is introduced. This impulse happened as I had come to genuinely like our male protagonist and had no desire to see the awful things that lay in store.

To that effect the first half of this film is compelling, engaging and friendly. I like this man who is looking for a bride. I am not offended that he allows his somewhat amoral accomplice to talk him into employing an elaborate ruse to find his new wife. To critics who read this process as misogynistic or sexist or objectifying of women I say that what these boys do is no worse than the shenanigans that school girls employ to force-match the boy of their desires to the girl who they wish to keep in their debt.

Depending on how the critic chooses to view the suffering of the young lady in this picture will influence the opinion of her motives. While It may be possible to read her actions as a bid for female empowerment I feel that the case is better made that she has slipped into a psychotic channel and chosen to push her strange power as far as It could go.

Very few women get to grow up to be accomplished ballerinas. Fewer still become accomplished sadists. Perhaps this need for exclusivity found symmetry in the shift from preforming arts to deforming arts.

I would like to repeat how deeply I enjoyed the character development and the acting and the composition of the mise en scene within each frame during the first half. Especially earnest was when the male protagonist nearly breaks cover with the way that he speaks to his desired bride to be when It is her turn to audition. I do not understand how anyone could feel animosity towards that man. To the contrary he seems to me to be a very beautiful human being.

Were somebody interested in remaking this film or adapting this story in a different way I would like to see someone take the first half of the film as It is and write a second half that takes the story in some other direction. I am tempted to own this movie on the off chance that I might be able to help to realize that potential. (3.5 out of 5 stars)",1505779200,,2308,4.321016166281755

7945651,3,B00005MKXB,"This movie was... okay. I didn't love it, and I didn't hate it. But I honestly feel like at this point in time it is severely overhyped with everyone touting it as a ""masterpiece"" and the ""most terrifying horror movie ever made."" Yes there is some strong imagery, especially for the time it was originally released (1999, and 2001 for it's US release) and by today's standards the effects actually hold up surprisingly well. However, the main part of this movie I have a problem with is the story. MINOR SPOILERS: I'm not going to go too much into detail here but if you want to go into this movie knowing absolutely nothing like so many other people suggest then stop reading now. However, if you'd like to know sort of what you're getting into and potentially save you from wasting some money then continue reading.

First of all, let me just say that I like slow, psychological movies. Movies that make you think and are left up to interpretation. It's not like I need every little thing answered in every single movie I watch but I feel like this particular film left TOO MUCH up to interpretation and there just needed to be SOMETHING that was even a little more explained. These next two statements may contradict each other but I feel like you shouldn't have to go out and basically study a movie to understand it's actual meaning. On the other hand, I actually really love going on YouTube and watching hour long analyses on obscure or confusing movies, learning things I missed, little details or clues, and references. The thing about that is the movie has to initially draw me in enough to actually learn more about it and this movie just didn't do it for me.

I don't know if it was something lost in translation or a cultural barrier but... the story doesn't make sense in the long run. Yes, I get the basic premise; The main character is lonely, older, and perhaps even a bit desperate and with everyone telling him, even his own son, it's time for him to find a new wife he finally decides to just go ahead and do it through the process of auditions. This is where my first problem with this movie pops up. Pretty much everything we've seen of the main character up to that point suggests that he's actually a pretty decent and relatable guy so the fact that Aoyama so easily goes along with his friend's suggestion of basically tricking girls into auditioning to become his new girlfriend just... really threw me off. Which may be the whole point. From what I've seen others say one of the main points of the movie is misogyny which did clear things up for me a little bit but doesn't explain everything else.

Once the film got into the second half and things started turning darker and more twisted the movie just made less and less sense with introducing dream sequences, hallucinations, and the main character seeing things that he almost certainly would have no knowledge of, which leads to an unreliable narrative. I felt like the movie was really heading in one direction with a certain kind of twist and then... nothing. I'm not saying every movie ever has to have some kind of twist but this movie just leaves you with nothing. Yes the climax is shocking and I did genuinely care about the main character but when the whole movie leads to a scene that by today's standards honestly isn't all that bad (especially if you've seen your fair share of indie, artsy, and foreign films) then it just made the whole story that came before it feel pretty hollow.

Overall, the acting is great, I liked the cinematography and I didn't mind the slow pace. But if you're coming into this movie only because you've heard people talk about how shocking and gruesome it is then I'd have suggest you avoid it. If you're wanting to watch this just for some torture porn then I'd recommend something more like A Serbian Film or heck, even the Saw films instead.",1502150400,,3868,4.561151079136691
7945652,5,B00005MKXB,"Not everyone is moved by opera. There is the language barrier, for one. There are the less-than-perfect acoustics in many venues where performances take place. There is the distance from the stage that makes the acting of the performers harder to 'read' when so much is communicated with expression and gestures.

That is what is so nice about this film. You see it all, with much better lighting and professional cinematography than you usually get with even a filmed opera.

The stories of these singers aren't explained much. You don't see their families - except for some brief contacts that are so brief, they are nowhere near front and center. That is usually the theme of competitions - 'Hi, mom! Hi, dad!'

The music really takes over the film, which is a wonderful thing. Then the very expert film editor shaped this into a revealing tale of a band of talented performers who share one thing, for the most part - their doubts that they can win (but they will try, my God, they will try!) Alek Shrader's name is displayed beneath 'The Audition' but he was perhaps the only truly confident that he would win. Every atom of his being seemed to shout 'I got this' while others struggled to maintain their composure before going on to the stage. He deserved to be chosen. Yet there were others chosen who suffered visibly when they felt their performances weren't perfect. They still won. They deserved it too!

I loved the music. Even good opera can sound like musical shouting, depending on the acoustics and where you are sitting in the theater. This was a treat.",1498867200,,1570,4.698181818181818
