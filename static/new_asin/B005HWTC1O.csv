8473909,5,B005HWTC1O,"very challenging workout, just what I need. I do not have 2 bells even with 1 bell I still think it's awesome. I highly recommend it.",1470268800,,133,4.153846153846154
8473910,1,B005HWTC1O,"Very dIsappointed in this workout.  I bought this based on another review which stated that ABR teaches excellent kettlebell form. This DVD, IMHO, is highly over rated.  In order to do this work out, you must have two KBs to perform the workout as demonstrated.  Plus she struggles to do the workout.",1453593600,,300,4.730769230769231
8473911,1,B005HWTC1O,"I don't want to do other floor exercises or cardio workout with my Kettlebell, if you want to then buy this.  It's not for a beginner and not for advanced either if you don't want to do other exercises while setting down your Kettlebell.",1448064000,,237,4.386363636363637
8473912,5,B005HWTC1O,"Great instructor and fine variety of challenging exercises.
Always great to go back to for a change of pace.",1444694400,,108,4.7368421052631575
8473913,4,B005HWTC1O,"I have done Amy's kettlebell workouts before, and I like the short intense workouts she provides.  This DVD allows you to mix and match exercises and you will do sets of various exercises.  With the warm-up, you're looking at 20 minutes total.  Can't beat that.",1411948800,,261,4.7555555555555555
8473914,5,B005HWTC1O,"Another great workout by Amy Bento. Love the way these are set up to be short yet very challenging, easy to pick different chapters and make it a longer and harder workout when I have the extra time",1374969600,,198,4.2368421052631575
8473915,4,B005HWTC1O,"I am a runner and have a injury so needed a different activity to do for a while. I ordered this DVD and I have to say I am surprised that it is actually pretty good! DVD's are so hit and miss, with most as misses. So I give Amy credit for putting out a good workout. I do feel you need some background in kettle bells before doing this though. You also need either 12 lb or 14 lb kettle bells (2). The only part I don't like (so I do abs while she does it) is the last exercise which is a very difficult and annoying move. The name of it escapes me right now but you will know what I am talking about if you buy this DVD. I do the entire DVD for my workout, but there are three seperate workouts and a warm-up and a cool down.",1368489600,2,727,3.789473684210526
8473916,5,B005HWTC1O,"This is my third, and favorite kettlebell video from Amy Bento. I've been working out with kettlebells for about three years now and was looking for an advanced workout. She focuses a lot on form and intention with theses workouts, which I appreciate. Not a lot of fluff, just Amy, some simple background music and pure kettlebell fun. I also enjoy the Kettlebell Goddess and Jillian Michaels dvd.",1356048000,3,397,4.852941176470588
8473917,5,B005HWTC1O,I workout with Amy on a daily basis and love every minute of it. Amy takes kettlebell workouts to a whole new level.,1333411200,,116,4.086956521739131
