The DVD is anamorphic 1.66:1 widescreen but sadly has no subtitles so one must be able to understand Austrian dialect to appreciate the brilliant black humour that is ever present within these stories of Nazi and later Soviet brutality. I first saw Der Bockerer at a Jewish film festival in Melbourne, Australia and it made a very deep impression. I rate it as one of the most powerful films of its type I have ever seen.

Der Bockerer is a simple butcher in pre Anschluss Vienna. He does not like the Nazis and a number of his friends are by chance Jews.

Der Bockerer tells of events during the war. A harrowing and powerful story of one man's determination to maintain his honour.

sterreich ist frei tells of events after the war is over but Vienna is not yet free, this time from the tyranny of the Russians.

These films are generally regarded as some of the best ever to come out of Austria. The acting is excellent. It is a shame that there are no subtitles to help non German speakers enjoy them too.",1226102400,4,1041,4.463157894736842
