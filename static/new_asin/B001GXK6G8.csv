8307341,1,B001GXK6G8,"This movie has no script, the acting is flat, uninspired, one-dimensional, cliche-happy, the cinematography is terrible, although I don't think it will matter to many.  If you like Paul Rodriguez you could probably stomach this flick but I can't see anyone paying full price for this.",1236643200,3,284,5.173913043478261
8307342,1,B001GXK6G8,"First of all, I have a TON of Blu-ray movies, and I'm a huge movie fan in general.  I watched this on a 52"" Samsung LCD HDTV that was NOT in anyway defective.  The picture quality of this movie is absolutely horrendous!  I had to double check on my PS3 to make sure it was actually a Blu-ray movie.  Sure enough, the video was encoded at a high enough level (over 20 mbps) for me to be safe that I hadn't accidentally gotten a standard def. movie instead.  Grain, grain, grain, terrible shadow detail, awful colors.  I honestly think this movie was shot on a camcorder and then lazily transferred to a blu-ray disk, with no attempt to improve it what-so-ever.  To call this ""high definition"" is a joke.
On a side note, the audio quality (2.0.) is just about as bad as the video.
Extra side note :  Upon further inspection, my TV reports the video image is actually 1080i, not 1080p, so it wasn't even mastered in true high definition.
The story itself?  Eh, it was below-average, predictable, not worth anyone's time.  I was so shocked by the movie quality I really never gave the film itself a chance, to be honest.  If this was a VHS tape I would've been o.k. with it (it really DOES look that bad!) but on Blu-ray it's simply inexcusable.",1236124800,2,1241,4.399122807017544
8307343,4,B001GXK6G8,"John Seda is Richard, a guy that is pretty much miserable with a girlfriend that's cheating on him and a job he hates. He gets sent down to Mexico City on business and everything goes haywire! After witnessing a murder, he has to cross-dress to stay concealed from a gang that's trying to hunt him down. This movie takes its viewers on a wild ride![...]",1235692800,2,353,4.446153846153846
8307344,1,B001GXK6G8,"Admittedly, I ordered this for the store for two reasons, a low priced BD and Alison Eastwood. Neither proved to be what I had hoped in value. Alison's role was smaller, and the BD quality was one of the worst transfers I have seen.

The story is reminiscent of a low grade B movie involving a man trying to save himself while traveling to our southern neighbor. The whole ""during Pete Wilson's regime"" plot feels misplaced for what the story is about, but in the end it apparently gains some relevance. That aside, the acting is below average and not enjoyable.

The quality of the BD is horrendous, including volumes of grain and foreign artifact throughout. I played it in the store for a brief spell (on the BD display) but customers thought I had damaged the display or was showing lowdef broadcast, so it was removed in short order. The sound was mixed to 2.0 quality, and was muddled at best.

No special features to list, so overall not a BD recommendation, and a weak B movie reference at that.",1234396800,8,1003,4.530386740331492
