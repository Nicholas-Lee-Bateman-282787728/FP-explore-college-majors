5688726,5,B00C2CDJ34,"I picked up this 4-pack for five bucks so I'm pretty happy.

The set has 2 single-sided dual layered dvds with 2 movies on each. The Blob and Christine on one, Fright Night and The Seventh Sign on the other. All the movies are anamorphic widescreen and the picture quality is pretty solid considering 2 movies are on one dvd. There are no English or Spanish subtitles on any of the movies but there is closed captioning (English only) which you can receive through your tv set. The problem with cc is that cc will not work if your bluray or dvd player is connected to your t.v. via hdmi cable. All the single dvds of these movies had subtitles so I don't know why they are not included in this set. I was considering deducting a star for that but I don't need subtitles myself just wanted to give a heads up to those that do.

The Blob - This is the 1988 remake not the original. The movie is presented in 1:85 anamorphic widescreen. There are no extras. The original dvd from 2001 only had a trailer as an extra.

Christine - The movie is presented in 2:35 anamorphic widescreen. There are no extras. It appears to be the same transfer used on the 2004 Special Edition dvd of Christine. The SE had a bunch of good special features. An audio commentary with John Carpenter and Keith Gordon, three featurettes, and 20 deleted scenes (about 26 minutes). It's too bad these extras weren't on this set. They were obviously left off to make room for the Blob.

Fright Night - This is my favorite movie in the set. The movie is presented in 2:35 anamorphic widescreen. There are no extras. This is a good way to obtain this movie since the original dvd is now out of print. This is the same transfer and the only extra on the original was a trailer.

The Seventh Sign - The movie is presented in 2:35 anamorphic widescreen. There are no extras. The original dvd was a flipper dvd with this transfer on one side and a pan & scan transfer on the other. There were no extras on that dvd either (unless you consider the p&s transfer an extra). Not even a trailer.",1469318400,,2053,4.349869451697128

5688759,5,B00C2CDJ34,"I bought this collection for FRIGHT NIGHT (1985) which has become a cult classic and one of the best movies of the 80s representing the horror genre. It is the modernization of the classic Dracula story perfectly retrofitted to set in the 80s. For a long time, I have waited for the Blu-ray format for FRIGHT NIGHT and I finally gave up and decided to buy the standard format DVD. Luckily, I came across this excellent collection.

THE BLOB (1988): This is the remake of the original classic from 1958. On the 30th anniversary of the original, they released this remake. Although I am normally against remakes (or reboots, re-boosts, or whatever term they use these days to re-cycle an idea), I think this one is a pretty decent remake. It does contain some awesome special effects, sound effects, and editing. At times, it gets a little gory for my taste and it has some flaws but overall I think it is very well-crafted movie. Audio and video quality were better than I expected.

CHRISTINE (1983): John Carpenter's adaptation of a Stephen King classic, CHRISTINE deserves more credit than it has received over the years. This is one of my favorite Stephen King movies and I think it is very faithful to the book. I love the old-fashioned special effects used in the movie. There are some very memorable scenes such as the one where Christine is engulfed in flames cruising down the street chasing her victim. I would consider this a masterpiece for its effectiveness.

FRIGHT NIGHT (1985): I already wrote about this in the beginning. This is an absolute classic. Chris Sarandon's portrayal of the vampire was truly brilliant. He was charismatic, slick and humorous. I don't think up to that point, vampires had that kind of charisma. I love the fake vampire killer being thrown into a situation where he has to deal with a real vampire - what a marvelous idea for a script. I highly recommend this to any horror fan, especially to those who love vampires.

SEVENTH SIGN (1988): Undoubtedly, this is the weakest film in the collection. It is not terribly bad but fails in comparison to other movies in the collection.

Overall, $10 for these 4 movies is an amazing deal. Only Fright Night is worth the price and probably more. The collection has 2 DVDs with 2 films on each DVD. Unfortunately, there are no subtitles (or extra features) but DVD does offer English Closed Caption. Video and audio quality are better than I expected on all movies. I was pleasantly surprised about that.",1431993600,8,2487,4.734411085450346

Both movies looked good -- no extras or subtitles -- but I never watched The Blob due to poor reviews when it came out, and I can see I missed out.  It is really a good movie, and though it is gory at times, it is always done for a reason and does not seem gratuitous.  The premise is highly believeable.  After watching Fright Night again I remembered what a good movie it was -- and how it was not really a great movie at the same time.  Twilight Time put out a nice blu ray for this which is now fetching astronomical prices, and though it would be nice to see on blu ray, frankly it is not such a good movie that I would pay a collector's price to see it on blu ray.",1400889600,,763,3.9607843137254903

It includes four feature films: The Blob (1988), Christine (1983), Fright Night (1985) and The Seventh Sign (1988). While hardly a collection of all-time classics, there is some gold to be mined here and this sort of horror movie grouping is just the stuff you need for your DVD player when Halloween rolls around.

The Blob: this movie came and went rather quickly when I was a sophomore in high school, but has since risen to cultic status, and justly so, because it's a rare case of a remake being better than the original. The story is simple. A meteor crashes near a small town, releasing a gelatinous alien creature which consumes all protein (read: flesh) that it encounters, growing larger each time it feeds. In its path are a variety of fairly well-drawn characters, including the town's motorcylce-riding rebel, played with cliched panache by Kevin Dillon. THE BLOB is surprisingly well-made and the deaths are gruesome and cut deep into the ranks of the likeable characters, giving you the feeling that no one is really safe. Throw in a government conspiracy and some well-known character actors and you have a very entertaining 90 minutes that are much leaner and swifter than the original. A very fast, fun film.

CHRISTINE: Okay, so this film is not the least bit scary, and the ""high school students"" often look like 30 year old men and women. Still, this John Carpenter adaptation of one of Stephen King's earliest hits is worth watching. CHRISTINE is the story of an old Plymouth Fury nicknamed ""Christine"" which has a personality all its own. Small-town nerd Artie falls in love with the car, and the feeling is mutual...so much so that Christine begins paying fatal vehicular visits to Artie's enemies, begins taking over his personality, and in the end, tries to knock off even his close friends. Christine is quite jealous, you see, and would rather see Artie dead than with anyone else. As adaptations go, this one is clumsy and rather badly written, but there is a certain energy and charisma to it all the same, and the sequences of Christine regenerating after taking horrific damage are extremely cool. And unlike modern horror films, there's no attempt to explain the inexplicable, either.

FRIGHT NIGHT: The best known movie in the collection is the tale of an ordinary American teenager named Charley who discovers that his next-door neighbor is a murderous vampire. Unable to get anyone to believe him, Charley enlists a worn-out, has-been actor who played a vampire hunter on TV, only to discover that he doesn't believe in vampires either. Meanwhile, the charismatic vamp is well on his way to seducing Charley's girlfriend Amy and his nerdy sidekick Evel. A battle of wills develops between the master vamp and the bumbling but resolute teen. I can't honestly say this film is very frightening at all; indeed, the emphasis is a little more on comedy, and the final confrontation is way overdone and makes me more sympathetic to the vamp than the heroes, but there is some nice acting work by Chris Sarandon and Roddy McDowell and just enough menace to keep things entertaining. This is more fun than it is horror, but fun is okay by me.

THE SEVENTH SIGN: This is a difficult movie to summarize. SIGN is the story of a couple, played by Michael Biehn and Demi Moore, who are expecting a baby. As they anxiously await birth -- the wife miscarried the first time she was pregnant -- various freak occurrences are happening all over the earth which seem to be portents of the apocalypse. At the same time, they take in a mysterious stranger (Jrgen Prochnow) who takes a very creepy interest in Demi's unborn baby, and are more or less stalked, in a semi-friendly way, by a priest who is taking a similar interest, also for unknown reasons. Obviously, everything hinges on the child; but the real question is not whether the child will be born good or evil but whether it survive birth or be stillborn. SIGN is a rather strange film, not frightening but occasionally menacing, with a few interesting twists; not very memorable, but not entirely forgettable either.

I gave this collection four stars more for the price than the greatness of the films, but again, I really dig these cheap collections, which are zero-frills but very respectable in picture quality. Three or four of these will get you through Halloween very nicely.",1531008000,,4459,4.823529411764706
