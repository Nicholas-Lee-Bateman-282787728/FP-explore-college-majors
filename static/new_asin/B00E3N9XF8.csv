5888065,5,B00E3N9XF8,"I have almost every Scooby Doo box set, dvd's, etc. I am more of the Where are you season fan, but my 20 month old son now absolutely loves this Scooby Doo puppet dvd. He has memorized it and dances at the dance scenes. He used to only watch Baby Einstein and now this is his favorite dvd and watches it almost every day. I really hope they make more because I will add them to my collection for him. I've always wanted my child to watch Scooby Doo so I'm happy to watch them with him. :)

I am actually about to buy a second copy for the car as well. I bought my 1st copy from Walmart and not Amazon even though I usually buy everything from Amazon with my prime. I think when it first came out I either didn't think to look here or they didn't have it yet.",1383436800,3,758,3.954248366013072
5888066,5,B00E3N9XF8,"A lot of effort went into the puppetry and sets, which just made a good Scooby film, into a great one.",1379635200,,102,3.9047619047619047
5888067,5,B00E3N9XF8,My family watches and loves all things Scooby.  This was a cute movie that reminded us of a Pup Named Scooby Doo.  The puppets were cute and my son laughed throughout the whole thing.  It was kooky.  I would recommend it.,1378166400,2,221,4.317073170731708
5888068,5,B00E3N9XF8,My 5 year old loved the movie non stop laughter if you are a die hard scooby doo fan and love the old cartoons then this is a little different reminded me of crank yankers without the obscene subject matter but as long as my son loved it it was fine with me,1378080000,4,257,3.8679245283018866
5888069,4,B00E3N9XF8,"Our family loves Scooby and we've watched pretty much every incarnation of the show. I wasn't quite sure how well this would go over with my kids as they weren't really keen on the live-action movies. This however I found quite adorable. If you're familiar with ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo"" this show is like a Muppets version of that complete with the little dancing ditties, Velma's little steps and Daphne's diva side - the only thing missing is Red Herring.

It was funnier than I expected and even I got a few good laughs from this. I'm not sure why this was created, but really for the younger kids who love puppets and Scooby, I think it's a great crossover. Yes it's campy, but it's meant to be. The jokes and pratfalls are quite cute. The other good thing is that many of the regular voice actors are in this, so the kids will recognize their favorite characters.

I'm sure we'll be watching this again.",1376956800,,908,4.463855421686747
5888070,1,B00E3N9XF8,"I am a huge Scooby-Doo fan. I've been a fan since the 70s and now that I'm a father my kids and I watch all the old and new Scooby-Doo shows. Unfortunately, Scooby-Doo Adventures: The Mystery Map simply doesn't feel anything like Scooby-Doo and the Mystery Incorporated team. This puppet show is more like a horrible adult parody of Scooby-Doo; it reminds me of the old show on Comedy Central called ""Crank Yankers"" and is not in any way something that I would want to watch again or have my children watch.

I'm not sure who thought this was a good idea, but it's NOT. Stick to the classic Scooby-Doo formula and stick to the cartoons we love. Please.",1376438400,8,652,4.4789915966386555
5888071,4,B00E3N9XF8,"Warner Bros. Home Entertainment recently released ""Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map"" exclusively through Wal-Mart. Imagine the familiar characters from ""Scooby-Doo"" if they were turned into Muppets. The 45-minute mini-movie will thrill children and even parents who don't dig too deep below the surface.

Scooby-Doo and the gang embark on a search for buried treasure when a map is accidently left in their pizza. The lost treasure belongs to a pirate named Gnarlybeard. The quest gets difficult when the Phantom Parrot steals the map from the sleuths and their clue-sniffing canine. They must track down the mysterious bird and recover the map if they ever want to find out what's inside Gnarlybeard's treasure chest.

""Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map"" is based in the world of ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo."" To jog memories, the Saturday morning cartoon series featured Scooby and his pals as children. Remember back when every cool cartoon franchise was intent on turning their characters into pint-sized ankle biters? ""The Flintstone Kids,"" ""Tiny Toons Adventures,"" ""The New Archies,"" and ""Muppet Babies"" are perfect examples of this obsession.

If you don't get too picky, ""Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map"" is entertaining. The sets and backgrounds all look good. It does seem like the filmmakers had a hard time figuring out exactly how to get the puppets properly framed in the picture at times. However, none of that really matters when your target market are children who aren't going to complain about those sorts of things.

Most of the familiar voice actors who we've come to identify as these characters lend their talents to ""Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map."" Frank Welker plays both Scooby-Doo and Fred as usual. Matthew Lillard breathes life into Shaggy and Grey DeLisle Griffin portrays Daphne. Mindy Cohn is replaced as the voice of Velma by Stephanie D'Abruzzo (""Sesame Street,"" ""The Book of Pooh"").

There's not much to be found in the way of bonus material for ""Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map."" The first is an episode of ""Scooby-Doo! Where Are You?"" entitled ""The Backstage Rage."" The second is the episode ""Robopup"" from ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo."" It would've been interesting to see some ""behind-the-scenes"" footage of the puppeteers working.

""Scooby-Doo! Adventures: The Mystery Map"" knows exactly who its target audience is and hits the mark. I can see where they could take the puppet concept of this movie and make it work as a new TV or movie series for the franchise. There's no better time than now to push the idea with the renewed interest in the Muppets at a fever pitch.",1376352000,,2640,5.17096018735363
5888072,5,B00E3N9XF8,"Not really knowing what to expect with a puppet version of Scooby Doo we were prepared to be disappointed. What we got was a fun filled adventure that was very similar to A Pup Named Scooby Doo right down to the characterization of each Mystery Inc member, (even Velma's twinkling feet when she walked) This was filled with with Scooby Doo site gags, and some real laugh out loud fun. This is also an EXCELLENT adventure for younger Scooby fans who I assure you will want to watch again and again. We picked this up at Walmart for 14.96, and it was well worth it. When it ended both my boys said they sure hope there are more to come. Me too! And, the puppets are done by a stellar cast of Sesame Street and Muppet puppeteers which makes this even more magical! Enjoy !!!",1374883200,10,771,4.324137931034483

So I got the DVD from the library first, to test it out and see if it was any good. Well, it's HILARIOUS! I love puppet Scooby and the gang! In fact, I hope they do more puppet movies! And soon!  I have bought this DVD as gifts in the past for the kiddies, and now, finally, I'm getting one for me. So I can watch it whenever I need great entertainment and a good laugh!

The puppetry is pretty amazing and it is amazing to see how well puppetry and technology can work together. I hope to see more of these movies in the future.

5888091,5,B00E3N9XF8,"I know that the puppets are different than the animation but my son loves this muppet-esque version of Scooby Doo. Sometimes you just can't judge by adult standards what kids will love. In an era where fewer shows for kids are appropriate, this movie is just fine.

Goofy but fine. As a note, this is two programs - the first is with puppets and the second is a traditional animated cartoon. Both have pretty standard mystery story lines.",1439078400,2,438,4.615384615384615

My son loves Scooby Doo, but the Parrot and Pirate look huge and scared him a bit. But, he still asks to see ""Scooby Doo Muppets"" and covers his eyes through those parts...In typical Scooby and Shaggy fashion!
