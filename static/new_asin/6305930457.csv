1087290,5,6305930457,"A flower's life span is nothing compared to humans, yet flowers go through similar developmental stages.  The most memorable part of a flower's growth is the blossoming progress where it goes from being a small bud until it dwindles to the ground in a rapid withering phase.  Occasionally, love uses the life span of a flower as a symbol for the affectionate spell under which two individuals bond.  When the flower withers, the relationship turns numb, which is the case with Ferdinando ""Fef"" Cefal (Marcello Mastroianni).  Fef merely stays with his wife Rosalia (Daniela Rocca), as societal restrictions are enforced by the Catholic Church, family, and public, which forces people to remain married until death do they part.  In the light of this notion, the audience will truly experience a socially important comedy, which plays with the ideas of divorce through more hideous plots such as murder, deceit, and other troublemaking.

The film opens on a moving train as Fef exits the public toilet while he bumps into two Sicilian police officers.  Quickly Fef leaves them behind, as he slowly makes his way through gentle zigzagging around other passengers to the dining car.  Seated while ordering roast beef and two potatoes, Fef continues to gaze upon the passing Sicilian countryside, which does not seem to have changed much since the Roman Empire.  This is a familiar place for Fef who begins to disclose an amusing tale of why he is on his way home, as he recollects in homesick manner his hometown Agramonte. This opening has several suggestive nods towards Fef's character, his family and what is important in Agramonte, which will be comically and profoundly illustrated as the story unfolds.

In the introduction by Fef the audience learns through his words, the camera, and the actions of the characters that societal progress does not seem to be high on the agenda.  Instead the audience learns about how politics and the Catholic Church seem to be intertwined in this small town.  The slow progress has generated some very rigid guidelines, which no one seems willing to challenge.  In this societal stalemate the men only seem to pay attention and gossip about one thing - women.  This is essential information, as it depicts the boredom that helps the withering of the flowers.

The story goes into great detail to depict Fef's monotonous life.  He is unemployed due to social status because he is a Baron, which means that he often sleeps in.  Whenever he does not sleep his exceedingly caring and nurturing Rosalia tends to his needs while it actually seems as if she is only annoying him.  There is a wonderful scene where Fef escapes everyone to read in peace and enjoy the soothing  breeze from a small fan in his study while Rosalia enters with coffee and turns off the fan.  Fef turns the fan on again while Rosalia turns it off with a smile, as she serves him the coffee.  This scene oozes of tension between the two while Fef keeps his cool and Rosalia tries her best to be a good wife. Yet, it offers him an opportunity to begin to imagine different methods of how he could kill her.

In between Fef's annoyance and boredom he discovers the stunning teen Angela (Stefania Sandrelli) whom infatuates him with a brief look at mass.  Fef begins to think about Angela while he sneaks to the bathroom to steal a peak at the youthful girl through the window.  Eventually, Angela expresses her mutual desire for Fef, but they have to be careful so they do not cause a scandal, or worse.  This provides an opportunity for Fef to begin to actually think of how to get rid off Rosalia, which turns out to be a comically ugly event as he cannot divorce her by law.

The audience will feel empathy for Rosalia who tries to be a good wife, but Fef does not allow it by being distant.  Simultaneously, one cannot help to feel understanding for Fef who now begins to study the law and how he possibly could get away with murder.  It is a sad thought, even though the presentation of the topic is jovial, that the people are ready to commit the worst possible act in the name of love.  Yet, it is also here where the film's strength lays, as it delivers a funny depiction of how a pass society can squelch life and frown upon societal progress, which was a big deal in the 1960s.  A notion arises in regards to progress--should one have the freedom to find their own blossoming flower?

Divorce Italian Style offers a well-written and genuine comedy with deliberate intentions for the audience to ponder regarding the society and the social restrictions that govern the unhappy.  The cast does a marvelous job in portraying the different characters.  For example, Daniela Rocca's illustration of Rosalia provides authentic view of a woman who seeks love form her husband, but does not receive it.  In addition, Marcello Mastroianni does a brilliant job through his dual performance in the film by also being in the Fellini's La Dolce Vita, which is shown in the film.  However, Mastroianni's visual persona suggests his infatuation with beautiful women that can be explored if one views La Dolce Vita.  Lastly, the camera work, mise-en-scene, and the framing of each scene enhance the complete ideas, as they transcends the expectations of the film.",1114992000,2,5262,4.782079646017699
1087291,4,6305930457,"Just so you know, divorce is now permitted in Italy. But in 1962, the only way you could get a divorce was by... well, ""Divorce Italian Style,"" a ka bumping off your adulterous spouse. This delightfully warped black comedy focuses on that very idea -- a disgruntled husband who goes to absurd lengths to get a ""divorce.""

Ferdinando Cefal&uacute; (Marcello Mastroianni) is a middle-aged Sicialian noble who is displeased with his life, and his adoring wife Rosalia (Daniela Rocca). In true midlife-crisis fashion, he falls for his angelic-looking cousin Angela (Stefania Sandrelli), but he can't get a divorce. Divorce isn't allowed in Italy at this time, so Ferdinando is left stewing over his problems, fantasizing about murdering Rosalia.

But then he hears about an odd law: if an adulterous spouse is caught in flagrante, then the wronged spouse can kill the adulterer and get off with a light prison sentence. So Ferdinando starts desperately searching for a potential lover for Rosalia, but she remains faithful. Then he locates an ex-boyfriend of hers, hoping to rekindle the old flame. But nothing goes quite according to plan...

Yes, it's a bit sick. But in such a funny way that it really doesn't offend. At a certain point it becomes less about Ferdinando trying to murder his wife, as it is an increasingly overwrought attempt to get her to commit adultery. Not to mention a spoof on traditional views on ""family honor,"" where it is more shocking to NOT kill your adulterous spouse than it is to do so.

Ferdinando carefully straddles the line between being slime and being a funny character -- his surreal murder fantasies are hilarious, such as when he shoves Rosalia into a vat of soap. And in keeping with the spoof atmosphere, the romance is overemotional, the fighting is overwrought, and the contrived adultery/murder scheme is absurd. The final scene is the final tragicomic flourish, hinting at future disaster that Ferdinando deserves.

Pietro Germi at first seems to be making an offensive movie, but viewing it with a sense of humor shows that he's poking fun, and making wry social observations. He was also not above plugging Mastroianni's other movies -- one scene has a priest denouncing ""La Dolce Vita,"" followed by crowds rushing to see it. Ferdinando's future brother-in-law ogles the beautiful Anita Eckberg, then hastily tells his fiancee that Eckberg is pretty, but ""she has no soul.""

The immortal Mastroianni injects just enough humanity into Ferdinando to keep us from loathing him -- in the middle of a midlife crisis, he seems increasingly confused as the movie goes on. Daniela Rocca sits on the fence between being devoted and annoying, while Sandrelli plays a girl who acts like an angel, but definitely isn't.

Thankfully Italian spouses no longer have to bump each other off to get a ""divorce,"" but ""Divorce Italian Style"" remains a classic black comedy/social satire.",1110326400,39,2914,5.033195020746888

1087444,5,6305930457,"""Divorce Italian Style"" is a charcoal black comedy about an aristocrat who wants to kill his wife so he can possess his cousin. But it's a very funny movie all the same, as so many of his plans go awry. Marcello Mastroianni plays the main part to perfection. His facial expressions are fantastic, and he's supported by an excellent cast around him.

I first watched this movie when I visited Italy last year, and saw the first 30 minutes playing at a bar in Florence. There were no subtitles, and the bar was very loud, so I couldn't hear what was being said. But I could see based on the facial expressions, and the acting, what was happening. Upon watching the full version on Criterion, I discovered I wasn't far off about what was happening. This movie is a true gem.",1401235200,,771,4.468085106382978

But now I think if there's one creation from the 20th century-- one perfect work of imagination that will stand the test of time-- that would make Martians forgive the human race all its stupidity, it's this one.

Scorsese has written about his passion for this film and -- after seeing it maybe ten times -- I think I have to agree.  There is simply nothing funnier, more human, sadder, more passionate, or beautiful than this movie.

It's as human as Chaucer, as wise as Shakespeare.  And it has the most brilliant plot ever devised-- a double helix of blindness, passion, obsession, and 2,000 years of Mediterranean soul.  Not an art film; it is, instead, a work of radiant art.  In short: the greatest film ever made.  By a million miles.",1354838400,2,1074,4.739130434782608

1087449,4,6305930457,"Directed by Pietro Germi and starring Marcello Mastroianni, DIVORCE ITALIAN STYLE is a pitch-black and highly influential comedy--but comedy is a delicate thing, it seldom exports well, and this particular film does not wear its age particularly well.

DIVORCE ITALIAN STYLE is the story of Fefe Cefalu (Mastroianni) who is long married to wife Rosalia (Daniela Rocca), a woman who was once attractive but who has descended into bumptiousness and whose emotional neediness has become horribly wearing.  Living with his extended family in the decaying splendor of a once beautiful mansion, Fefe falls madly in love with his cousin Angela (Stefania Sandrelli) and determines to marry her--but since Italy of this time did not allow divorce, there is only one way out from under his tiresome wife: murder.  In the film's most famous sequence, Fefe imagines various ways of disposing of Rosalia: a knife in the back, a shove into a boiling cauldron of home-made soap, even a rocket launch.  Ultimately, however, Fefe settles on fixing his wife up with an adulterous affair that will allow him to kill her and escape without too much of a jail sentence.  It is a decision that brings forth a host of ironies.

Marcello Mastroianni was already an internationally known star and DIVORCE ITALIAN STYLE put him well over the top: his performance here is nothing short of comic genius, and he is extremely well supported by Rocca and a memorable supporting cast.  But the film essentially relies on the shock-humor of playing out a seriously imagined murder plot for comedy, something we have since seen in many other films.  As such, DIVORCE ITALIAN STYLE is unlikely to hold anything new for modern viewers, and from time to time it feels a bit slow.  Recommended for its performances nonetheless.

1087452,5,6305930457,"Marcello Mastoianni is a rumpled unemployed minor, very minor nobility, in Italy. He is married to Daniela Rocca. She has eyebrows that continue from one end to the other. She also has a moustache. He is lusting after his niece, Stefania Sandrelli. All of them, being down and out aristocrats, they live, sharing a stinking depressing palazzo-in close quarters. He spies on her and she in turn is accommodating to the lechery he conveys. But this is Italy before divorce, and he can only get rid of his obstinately faithful wife by killing her. Italy being Italy, divorce is not allowed but killing is. He tries to trap her in compromising situations. If he can get her in flagrante delicto, then everyone will applaud him for defending his honor and the catholic code.
In the end, he does get to kill her, becomes a local hero and marries the 16 year old niece. But all is not well in this garden of eden. See the film to find out what poetic justice ensues.
Mastoianni and Rocca are just great in their portrayals of an old lecher and a mustachiod wife who deserves to be killed. Italy is the villain with its ridiculous laws and machismo customs.
Pietro Germi followed this up with Seduced and Abandoned, another must see film.
The humor is, like everything in Italy, including the Berlusconi's scandals, blattantly exaggerated, that's why Ilove Italy..",1261094400,2,1356,4.75

1087604,5,6305930457,"This brilliantly-observed dark comedy by director Pietro Germi outstrips anything Fellini ever made and ranks with L'Avventura and Il Gattopardo as one of my favourite Italian films. With one of the best scripts ever written in any language, filled with novelistic detail, the film is beautifully shot and features a wry, starmaking performance by Marcello Mastroianni. Skirting farce without ever falling in, it has this great Sicilian cultural specificity while, at the same time, applying a delicious acidity to universal themes of frustrated lust and soured marriage. The relative obscurity of Divorce Italian Style among modern film fans who lionise films by Fellini made around the same time in the early 1960s is confounding but perhaps rests in the fact that this film belongs to an old school of moviemaking based more on highly-structured narratives and attention to character than on some flashy deconstruction of cinematic rules. In structure, style, tone, and attention to craft, it owes more to Billy Wilder than it does to Michelangelo Antonioni. A must-see film.",1246406400,2,1078,5.347058823529411

I picked it up chiefly due to a reference Scorsese makes to it in A Personal Journey. Certainly, Divorce Italian Style is a farce but the emotions and events it contains are ones with which all of us can relate--even though none of us have a need for a Italian ""divorce."" One also can appreciate the mystique which European films had--as compared to the more stodgy state of American cinema--during that period. I've always loved Marcello Mastroianni and his efforts here are outstanding. He plays his role perfectly and is a figure of both contempt and admiration. All of the acting, however, is great. The plot unwinds slowly but does not end predictably (on the whole). The climax is nuanced and the last frame tells us much about the nature of men and women.",1190937600,,892,4.651898734177215

Mastroianni, delivering one of his finest comedic performances, carries the film from first frame to last, almost Keatonesque in his deadpan mannerisms. Originally conceived as a hard-hitting drama (Germi's specialty at the time), ""Divorce"" delves right into the issue at hand--women--with a devilish, socially biting sense of humor, such as the farcical fantasy sequences where Fefe imagines offing Rosalia in inventive ways. If ""Divorce"" was always this much fun, who'd be married?",1182902400,,708,5.504587155963303
1087609,5,6305930457,"Divorzio all'italiana is a richly textured satire of Sicilian macho Catholic life styles starring one of Italy's greatest actors, Marcello Mastroianni.  He is a bit Chaplinesque in this tongue in cheek exploration of how to dump your wife and marry your 16-year-old cousin.  His wide-eyed, dead pan expressions combined with vulnerability and suave, leading-man good looks made him the heart-throb of women for decades.  He plays a bored baron stuck with a baroness (played fatuously by Daniela Rocca) that he cannot abide.  It should be noted that today it IS possible to get a divorce in Italy, but at the time it was very difficult, perhaps easier to get an annulment, and so we have the premise of the plot.

Stefania Sandrelli, who became one of the great ladies of the Italian cinema, plays the cousin.  She was only 15 when the film was shot but could easily pass for, say, 18.  She is sensual, sweet and a bit naughty.  In the final scene, famous for its fitting irony, the last thing we see are her feet.  I won't tell you more, but the movie is almost worth seeing just for that final scene.

Rocca's Rosalia on the other hand is more syrupy than sweet and would qualify as clinging.  She could smother a lumberjack, and although it is not polite to comment unfavorably on a lady's looks, I must note that she seemed to be having a bad facial hair day, everyday.  Her impersonation of a country baroness nonetheless was unforgettable.  I also liked 16-year-old Margherita Girelli as Sisini, the maid.  Her coquettish ways helped to lend a French bedroom farce flavor to the film.

But what really makes this one of the great monuments of the Italian cinema is the witty and delightful script by Ennio De Concini (it won an Academy Award in 1962) and the detailed, textured direction by Pietro Germi.  The picture that Germi paints of life in a small Sicilian (or southern Italian, for that matter) village is picturesque, much imitated, and indelible.  The crowded ornate clutter of the old estate, the sun-drenched streets and the monolithic stone and mason churches haunt our memory.  True, the film starts a bit slowly and drags (at least for modern audiences) a bit at times, but don't make the mistake of giving up on this.  The latter half of the film is wonderful.  And remember, if you had to go to film school, Divorce Italian Style would be on the syllabus.

So see this for Mastroianni of course but also because no film education would be complete without having seen Divorzio all'italiana.

The Criterion Collection DVD includes a second disc with a documentary on Germi's career, an interview with Ennio De Concini, and screen-test footage of Stefania Sandrelli and Daniela Rocca that I just had to see.  There is also a booklet with reviews of the film from Stuart Klawans, Andrew Sarris, and Martin Scorsese.  Scorsese's review is adoring and nostalgic since he is from Sicily and since the film had made such a lasting impression on him as a 19-year-old.  For him the film was not so much a comedy as a true reflection of a life he and his family had known.  He writes, ""Every detail in Divorce Italian Style is so truthful and right that all Germi had to do was heighten everything a bit to make it funny.""",1167868800,6,3234,4.679646017699115

Made forty five years ago about an old Italian Law that had declared divorce illegal but would give a minimum sentence for killing a cheating spouse, ""Divorce, Italian Style"" is hilarious, melancholic, biting, clever, and belongs to the best comedies ever. First, Germi was going to make a tragic film and there are many elements of tragedy in ""Divorce, Italian Style"". After all, two people who are in love and happy together will be killed because of the strict and unforgiving traditions that made their way into the laws of the country. Pietro Germi directed a movie that is saturated with the merciless boredom, suffocating heat and humidity of a small Sicilian town where seemingly nothing ever happens and where Baron Fete Gefalu leads the life of not so quiet desperation with his wife or 13 years, Rosalia who had bored him to death. To make the things worse, his 16 years old angelic cousin Angela (one look at 16 years old Stefania Sandrelli in her early role and you can forgive or at least understand Fete) just returned from the nun school and he is desperately in love with her. As we know, love moves the sun and the planets and it made Fete's mind invent the plan on how to get rid of Rosalia which was deliciously simple and deadly funny. What Fete did was unspeakable but HOW Marcello Mastroianni played it was one of the greatest comedic performances I've ever seen. To watch his face when he was imagining all sorts of creepy accidents to Rosalia and to hear him narrating the movie was Delight from the opening scene to the incredible and brilliant in its irony final.",1167782400,4,1884,4.593471810089021

Aristocrat Fefe cannot stand his wife.  Loud, annoying, crazy facial hair she grates on his nerves all day then wants to cuddle, etc all night.  Yuck!  Lucky for him though there is a 16-year-old hottie next door that is in love with him.  Yes!

Now all he has to do is get rid of his wife, but since divorce is illegal he's just gonna have to kill her, but that means prison unless!  Unless he catches her in the arms of another man then he'll get less than 3 years!  But who would ever want to be with his wife?

Flawlessly directed with an almost psychotic intensity I think I grinned like an idiot the entire movie.  And the performance!  Everybody was great, but Marcello Mastroianni was absolutely brilliant.  I'd laugh even when he was just standing around thinking.

If you're a fan of Marcello, it's a ""must have"".",1485734400,,465,4.333333333333333

7897595,3,6305930457,"Divorce, Italian Style is a film I almost rate up. It is an entertaining story and somehow Mastroianni is able to make the film comical and play a sympathetic lead. Despite that, the film is very dated, slow in the middle, and feels old and garish. While it is an enjoyable film, it is not /that/ enjoyable and feels more like a relic than a classic.",1443571200,,350,4.318181818181818
