5272341,2,B00962R0F6,"I hate the fact that the Package Art format is completely different from the past 4 seasons, so now it looks very incongruent on the shelf. And it is NOT  because of the network change, because Season 4 aired on BET and the dvd has the same format as the first 3 seasons which aired on the CW. So I don't know why change it in this season, when the fans already have 4 dvds with the same style and now we're stuck with 1 that has a completely different design.",1355875200,,460,4.054945054945055

5272349,3,B00962R0F6,Only like Jason and Chardonnays Characters.  Mel and Derwin are too childish but there is some growth.  Its just a lot of drama most times.  But it is getting better now that Jason and Chardonnay are together.,1436054400,,209,4.594594594594595

5272356,5,B00962R0F6,"Love this season and if you don't know, this was the last season for Melanie and Derwin. Although Derwin did make an appearance in the first episode of the 6th season Melanie no longer showed. The acting in this season is just as good as the rest so no complaints. New sets of challenges our cast has to go through so it is worth the watch if you liked the first 4 seasons.",1423958400,2,373,4.123287671232877

5272366,5,B00962R0F6,"Season 5 would end up being the last for Derwin and Melanie. It was also found Jason married to Chardonnay after a drunken trip to Mexico. Malik struggled with his sobriety and Tasha found love with Pookie, her childhood goon friend. This season lost some of ""The Game"" luster from previous seasons, but it still managed to entertain. Good show!",1403827200,,345,4.766666666666667
5272367,5,B00962R0F6,I have always been a big fan of The Game.  The Football players are HOT and so are the Ladies who love them.  I have always been a big Fan of Melinie and Derwin.  It was sad to see them exit the series in season 5.,1402185600,,214,3.608695652173913

5272373,4,B00962R0F6,"I had my doubts when BET picked up the series. Those doubts still remained after season 4. But the series came into its own, in season 5.  The dialogue was more realistic (exception: Tasha. She can be ghetto without being ignorant. Right? Especially will all that money) and funny. It is one of the only dramedies I watch.  Whom ever is writing for the character Jason Pitts, hats off to you. Tell them you want a parking space. You must be writing from personal experience.",1388275200,,474,4.564705882352941

5272375,4,B00962R0F6,"THe DVDs came fast and the product was good. The season, on the other hand not too crazy about it. The characters are so different from how the show started. They are moving towards being caricatures which is disappointing.",1384560000,2,223,4.743589743589744

5272379,5,B00962R0F6,"The Game is a series about professional football players and their lives. I love the game because they have a beautiful cast. It has funny moments and serious moments, but i enjoy the jokes and the beautiful men they have on the show. What i disliked about this season was the fact that it was pooch hall and tia mowry-hardict last season and when season 6 begins they will not be apart of it. If you followed all the other seasons before this, this is a must buy just for the fact of being team derwin or team melanie.",1375142400,,519,4.252525252525253
5272380,4,B00962R0F6,"Needs more episodes, but the Drama is still brilliant. The game needs to come to the UK, we don't know what we are missing.",1374019200,,123,4.166666666666667
