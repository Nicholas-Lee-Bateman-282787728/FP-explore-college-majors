4489178,4,B004X0MHEU,"If you are attracted by high-tech special effects and big Hollywood names, The Grace Card might not be the movie for you, but if you are interested in watching a film that's profound enough to impact your own life, you definitely cannot afford to miss this wonderful film.

The Grace Card is being released this weekend, Feb 25-27 across the nation, and I seriously hope many will find it in their hearts to go watch it. Why, you probably wonder? The reason is simple: Our society is deeply divided and wounded, and The Grace Card offers a different approach to stop the bleeding.

Mac McDonald loses his young son in a tragic accident, and his life spirals down from that moment on. As years pass, his relationship with his family becomes strained, and his bottled-up angry feelings wash into his attitude at work, slowing down his progression in his career as a law enforcement officer.
As a final straw, Mac is forced by his superior to pair up with Sam, an African-American pastor who took the job as a police officer to pay the bills, though his true dream is to create a self-sustaining, full-time ministry. There is little love lost between the two men, and their forced partnership triggers feelings neither of them are happy to face. They accept their shared task out of necessity, but even Sam struggles to understand why their paths intersected. When tragedy strikes, the design becomes suddenly clear, and both men discover that nothing happens by mistake. In a breathtaking turn of events, they both realize that Divine Grace was at work the whole time to bring healing not just in their individual lives but, as a reflection, to the collective of society.

The Grace Card is a fantastic document on forgiveness and a powerful reminder that each of us is but a tile in the tapestry of life. A message most of us desperately need to acknowledge.",1298764800,224,1857,4.7253086419753085

I'm sure this was a wonderful storyline- if you know SPANISH!!  I watched the first 10 minutes and  it was completely SPANISH.  However, the 8 movie previews (arghhhhh- too many- should never be more than 3 previews!) were in ENGLISH... the printing on the DVD is in ENGLISH.  So,  the SPANISH version was placed in the ENGLISH cover- whose oversight was that?!

4489205,4,B004X0MHEU,"My husband and I liked the movie, alot. Gave it 4 stars just short of 5. This movie falls under the Christian, Spirituality if you watched this, then we recommend.... and we take that claim seriously. The storyline on forgiveness touches many real heart wrenching topics. Displayed in the beginning is main issue and done very well. The message of restoration, forgiveness and how it not only brings healing to those forgiven, but to those that forgive is clear. The acting overall is believable and good, especially one of the lead actors, Joiner.
The minus star is because as a film obviously trying to bring a Godly message, it fell short of getting the whole story of Jesus Christ's death and resurrection for all sin of mankind and through accepting that free gift of salvation, brings with it transformation and healing. It shows, God changes and helps message. It just left out going that extra sentence or two, yes God, but specifically by Jesus. This can be done without preachy methods, just adding a few lines.
This movie gave you part of that message where those that know Jesus would fill in that missing part, but others may not. Still a very good movie. Yes, ending can be for some predictable, but, in this type of movie it didn't affect where it was taking you.

Recommend: Greater, Do You Believe, The Investigator, Facing the Giants, God's Not Dead 1&2, War Room, and for every Dad, watch Courageous.

Grateful for these movies that bring positive messages without cursing and sex on screen.",1511568000,,1510,4.781609195402299

4489420,5,B004X0MHEU,"I see quite a few Christian movies and this one is by far one of my favorites. I only buy movies I feel have a strong teachable message and this one does. The ending is compelling. Life lessons that every single person should practice. One of the key points is on anger and how anger can consume us and make us bitter. Also, the difference it makes in how we respond to anger and how we must always act in love, after all we are witnesses of Christ. To give the ""grace card"" (as shown in the movie) was probably the most humble and yet most powerful and rewarding act I have ever done in my Christian walk. I was not in the wrong, just as the main character was not but to see God's Word play out in a powerful way when we stop conforming to the world and do something that makes absolutely no sense to even an average Christian and yet we are commanded to do in God's Word is a milestone in one's Christian walk that will change your life forever. It is not about what people think, it is about what does God says to do. Obedience has rewards, absolutely...huge rewards. It is not about being right, it is about doing the right thing. Something that goes against our flesh and how our world sees things. Must see movie. Everyone will glean from this movie powerful wisdom to use in their walk their God.",1455062400,7,1304,4.240963855421687

Seventeen years have passed since the tragic accident that had left the McDonalds without their eldest son. But the hurt hasn't gone away, no.

All too often, we are poorly portrayed in the media as being too hard or uncaring or simply too sappy and willing for believe every word that falls from the mouths of our patients.  Still, the message of forgiveness was powerful for me and continues to resonate given the many challenges faced by the characters in the film...",1453507200,2,649,4.725663716814159

And this is not just a bible verse. For I have lived it. My husband is white and I am hispanic.. In the beginning of our relationship my husband's family did not accept me just based on that. My husband was brought up to be a racist. However, once my husband put away his ignorance and began to get to know me, he said he fell in love with me. Despite his families objections. He said they did not have to be around us. Slowly over time, they got to know me and we became friends then family. We've been together and married for over 35 years. This movie does and will inspire you to get to know a person before you make a judgement solely based on a persons race.

There are some things about this movie that are not realistic such as someone being in church and not in prison after events unfold in the movie,  but I guess I'll get over that. Overall,  this is one of my favorite movies.",1402185600,,450,4.5125

4489658,1,B004X0MHEU,"Thankfully we are past the day where ""Christian Movie"" meant ""lame.""  However, this movie is just bad.

The acting made it unwatchable. It started laughable, from the moment the cop jumped out of the car, and it didn't get any better.

The story may be fine, there may be a ""grace"" message here, but I couldn't imagine sharing this with a friend.

There are lots of good faith-based movies out there. Try Courageous. October Baby. Home Run. Want a movie about Grace? Les Miserables is phenomenal.

But if you want to enjoy the movies you watch, skip this one.

(And Christians, why do we need to vote 4 or 5 stars for everything just because it's Christian? If it's bad, let's say so.)",1399852800,2,685,4.528455284552845

But when he is assigned a partner of that different race, who just happens to be a minister of the faith, it just complicates things......until God begins to intervene in the situation and His grace begins to become evident in the life of that Policeman. This is a fascinating look at a true-life situation that perhaps many can relate to in their own life. The story will peak and keep your interest all the way through and teaches all a very valuable life lesson. Highly recommended.",1370390400,,742,4.423357664233577

Unfortunately for many of us, it takes a serious loss to really understand and appreciate all that God is trying to do in OUR lives, ultimately for His glory and the good of those around us. The situation may not be exactly what everyone else is ""going through"" but the tension, grace and forgiveness represented here will speak volumes in anyone's life who watches.

I tried to hang in there to see the redemption part but was unable to take the hollering, yelling - general bigotry.  Too much focus on this and very little on the redemption.  It was very hard to keep up with what was going on and the whole thing seemed disjointed and did not flow smooth at all.  The dialogue wasn't even that great.  It was hard to keep up with who was the main character and who was the supporting cast.  I loved the partners family but they didn't show enough of the love there either.  The main focus was on how big a bigot the main character was and what a general creep he was to everyone.  After trying to keep up and not be too confused (I honestly did watch for almost an hour)I finally gave up and quit watching all together.  I am disappointed because the reviews were raving about how good the movie was.  Not even close for me and I wish I could have previewed it before purchase.",1364428800,4,985,4.247311827956989

4489782,5,B004X0MHEU,"If you are attracted by high-tech special effects and big Hollywood names, The Grace Card might not be the movie for you, but if you are interested in watching a film that's profound enough to impact your own life, you definitely cannot afford to miss this wonderful film. I seriously hope many will find it in their hearts to watch it. Why, you probably wonder? The reason is simple: Our society is deeply divided and wounded, and The Grace Card offers a different approach to stop the bleeding.

Mac McDonald loses his young son in a tragic accident, and his life spirals down from that moment on. As years pass, his relationship with his family becomes strained, and his bottled-up angry feelings wash into his attitude at work, slowing down his progression in his career as a law enforcement officer.
As a final straw, Mac is forced by his superior to pair up with Sam, an African-American pastor who took the job as a police officer to pay the bills, though his true dream is to create a self-sustaining, full-time ministry. There is little love lost between the two men, and their forced partnership triggers feelings neither of them are happy to face. They accept their shared task out of necessity, but even Sam struggles to understand why their paths intersected. When tragedy strikes, the design becomes suddenly clear, and both men discover that nothing happens by mistake. In a breathtaking turn of events, they both realize that Divine Grace was at work the whole time to bring healing not just in their individual lives but, as a reflection, to the collective of society.

The Grace Card is a fantastic document on forgiveness and a powerful reminder that each of us is but a tile in the tapestry of life. A message most of us desperately need to acknowledge.",1363737600,,1773,4.73462783171521

For me, however, the wife wasn't exactly enjoyable to watch. She may have been too typical of too many American women today who walk in fear and want to please their children above their husbands, being rescuers rather than mothers that support husbands in their efforts to raise sons to be men and responsible. The movie does not address this, but it bugged me because I saw her as part of the husband's problems, and not helpful at all.

What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice. As believers, we all need to recognize the importance of HIS WORD.  i read the reviews before buying this movie and many have high regards for the film.  i appreciate the people who wanted to make a movie about the MESSIAH's Grace and not some garbage about warewolves.  There is a scene at the pastor's home where they are about to eat dinner and the children are praying to the MASTER jokingly.  The parents being partaker of the prayer in like fashion.  i am not straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel here.  This is the typical church now.  Thinking we can come to the MESSIAH in any fashion and HE will accept us. Yes we come to HIM as we are but HE loves us too much to leave us where we are at.  The parents should have taught the kids to come to the FATHER correctly.  Our FATHER must be and yes i said must be worshipped in SPIRIT and TRUTH.  Look at it this way.  Everyone is right in their own eyes and YAH does not want us to be wise in our own conceits. Isaiah 5:21 Woe unto [them that are] wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!  It has some good points about forgiveness, which is a commandment of for us to do as believers.

4489875,2,B004X0MHEU,"Before watching The Grace Card, I heard several very good reviews about it. Everyone who watched it seemed to think it was a very profound and well done movie of faith. Needless to say, I was excited to watch the movie and had high(er) expectations.

The Pros:
-The cinematography as a whole is not bad. For the most part, the shots were good.
-The actor who played Mac (the white male cop, main protagonist) was the best actor in the movie. However, even he had some moments that were ""cringe worthy"".
-The anger and frustration over finances in the home were spot on.

The Cons:
-The acting. ...Enough said.
-The dialogue was clunky in several places.
-Sometimes, the choices of scenes were more of a distraction than helping the story. In several cases the choice to put in a scene jolted you out of the flow of the story.
-Overall, there was a feeling to the film that didn't sit right with me and those watching it with me. It's hard to describe. It's like you wished you had never watched the movie and never, ever want to watch it again. But it's more than that. It leaves a bad feeling with you for awhile. Thankfully, God isn't a God who wants you to be in that state and lifts you out of it!
-There were faulty theories and strange comments that were rather disturbing. One scene/line in particular was at the end of the movie when a member of Sam's (the black male cop, main protagonist, pastor) church said to the rest of the congregation -about Sam-, ""Welcome him back, he's our healer, Pastor Sam!"" Whether you are Christian or not, that statement is very creepy. If you are Christian you'll know that the phrase contradicts everything in the Bible.
-The movie, which is supposed to be a movie of God's grace and faith in Jesus, fell short in that area. Although it had a moment of repentance and two or three characters were ""Christians"", it really lacked God and having a relationship with Him. It was disappointing to see that the pastor/cop, Sam, became a pastor of a church because he thought it was the thing he was supposed to do and thought it was success to make ""his"" church bigger. He suffers from dissatisfaction in that he can't make things happen in the church. First of all, Sam shouldn't have become a pastor unless God specifically told him to- not because it seemed like the best thing for a good Christian guy, or the right thing to do. Second, he- as many real life pastors today- missed the fact that it's not about a bigger church attendance and it's not a pastor's job to make a mega-church. The job of the pastor is to shepard the people and to show God's heart. You do what God tells you to do and He'll bring the increase.
Lastly, Sam never recognized the fact that the source of his dissatisfaction was that he needed a RELATIONSHIP with God and not a distant mutual acquaintance. He never realized that maybe he WASN'T supposed to be a pastor. Sam should have taken a hiatus from ministry until he knew that God wanted him to go back or to quit being a minister.

Perhaps the real reason why this movie didn't make the cut is a combination of the bad feeling of the film, the lack of Jesus' saving grace, the odd comments and central theme of human grace and human healing.",1330819200,77,3215,4.455008488964347
4489876,5,B004X0MHEU,"I love this movie so very much! It makes me cry every time I watch it. Unforgiveness, anger, and hate are such heavy burdens for us to carry inside our hearts. They weigh us down and cause depression ,but oh, how wonderful forgiveness is! It brings freedom, peace, and joy. This movie is a beautiful example of God's love and mercy to us. Mercy is when you forgive someone even when you don't think they deserve it. I am so thankful for forgiveness :)",1330646400,,451,4.380952380952381
4489877,5,B004X0MHEU,The grace card was awesome. It is about a police officer that has had some loss in his family that he is trying to deal with and he is very angry.

4489882,3,B004X0MHEU,The Grace Card was a FAIR movie that missed the mark. I expected it to be a spiritually uplifting and believable movie much like Courageous. Instead the power of Jesus was not emphasized in a meaningful way. I read the movie created by a church group like Courageous so I expected a strong Jesus message. Why wasn't Jesus emphasized more during the movie? The plot was sensationalized and predictable like most Hollywood movies BUT Jesus and God were mentioned at some level. Then there was the unbelievable sensationalism. The son's killer comes back to apologize the exact day the pastor sergeant returns to church after having donating his kidney to his police partner's son after being the only donor they could find? This made the movie not believable or realistic. I was expecting his long lost father to show up too at this same moment. It was just over the top.

4489884,3,B004X0MHEU,"This was a movie I was really looking forward to.  Unfortunately, honestly, I have to say, that while there are a few redeeming things, I was disappointed on several levels.  The acting and production quality were both alright (not good, but alright) and did not distract from the story.  The problem came in with the story itself, and even more than that, some of the spiritual content in the story.  Let me explain.

I guess I'm starting to get a little weary of Christian movies that are just loaded with obvious stereotypes, cliches, and more than that, surface Christianity.  The obvious racial thing was played pretty much exactly as you knew it would.  The story itself, though taking a few odd turns (i.e. the son going from being honest and open with his dad to what they made him be a few scenes later where his accident occurs, which didn't even make any sense), pretty much played exactly as you knew it would.  By half-way through the movie, even though I wasn't sure of specifics, I pretty much knew exactly where the movie was going to be taking me for the next 45 minutes and honestly wasn't sure I really cared enough to see it.  That's never a good sign when you start thinking such things halfway through a movie.

I'll try to explain more in a minute, but I think I can provide a specific example that is representative of my feelings/issues with this movie. In the movie, there's several scenes with a ""Christian counselor"" that the wife (and son) see for help.  They actually had such a person claim she was NOT a ""Christian counselor"" but a counselor that was a Christian - trying to make some point to make you as the viewer think that was such a great thing she said.  But it wasn't.  It was wrong, and it was NOT Biblical.  I don't want someone that is trained in the ways and knowledge of the world, who just happens to also be a Christian as an afterthought, counseling me.  I'd much rather have a ""Christian Counselor"" - somebody who sees their Christianity as an integral part of their counseling.  But, actually, one could easily argue Scripturally that that's the JOB of the pastor or deacons or spiritually mature members in the church, not somebody you go and pay on the ""outside"".

And here's my point: This scene alone shows the contrast between movies like this, and say, the movies produced by Sherwood Baptist (Courageous, Fireproof, etc.).  In Courageous, there's family issues and tragedy, and the man goes to his pastor for Godly Spiritual counsel / wisdom.  In this movie, the filmmakers have them go to somebody who just identifies themselves as ""a counselor, who also happens to be a Christian"".  This may seem like a little thing, but this one contrast alone tells you much of what you need to know about this movie because it has a similar feel all the way through the movie, which more ""baby Christians"" might not pick up on, but those that have been actively growing in the faith a while, should be able to spot.

There are several other examples that could be given (such as the ""conversion"" scene), but basically the movie just never ""felt quite right"" to me in my spirit.  This movie is more about a general message of love, grace, and forgiveness, than the real depth of those messages found in REALITY in, and because of, Jesus Christ.

With that said, despite some of its questionable spiritual content and completely stereotypical portrayals, there are still messages of love, grace, and forgiveness in this movie (both forgiving yourself and forgiving others), and that's certainly not something I'm going to knock.  And because those messages, which we all need to hear, are ones that can affect some people very deeply if there's been lots of unforgiveness or hurt in their life (which describes many people), this can be a meaningfully positive movie.  I have read several such reviews, and have no problem envisioning some people being genuinely touched by this movie in a ""net positive"" way.

My favorite thing about this movie: I really liked that the black cop put his love into real, practical action - it went beyond just a sermon (which we get to hear part of earlier in the movie).  And they clearly showed that him doing that also spured on many other people to want to do the same.  So for that reason alone, this movie does have a major redeeming point (even though, because this movie was utterly predictable, I knew pretty much as soon as the accident occurred that this was going to happen.)

At the end of the day, my opinion is that if you're looking for a movie that explores the importance of the family unit and reconciliation in the family after loss, then you'd be much better served by a movie like ""Courageous"" that goes much deeper than surface ""Christianny Christianity"".  If you're looking for a movie to teach you a message of love and grace and forgiveness, I'd say there are better options out there also.  But because this movie shares them also, it still might be worthwhile for some.

4489888,5,B004X0MHEU,"I noticed that some of the reviews says it wasn't ""Christian enough...""

-One thing to remember, is the movie is not based on salvation... It's based on forgiveness and grace. This movie demonstrates on how to love your enemies, how to forgive those who have hurt you, how to give grace when it may not be deserved, etc.

This movie really gives you a good look at what some families go through, in the movie ""GraceCard"" it talks about drugs, racisim, bitterness, and death of a loved one; among more topics.

This movie handles more then just ""loosing a loved one."" It handles lossing a loved one, that was murdered. -There's a big difference to loosing someone to cancer vs. getting shot... You know?

In the movie, (don't worry, you find this out in the begining, I'm not giving anything away! ;) Officer McDonald looses his son when an undercover drug deal goes bad. -The suspect in this deal flees the Police and basically runs over Officer McDonald's kid. (It does not show anything)In an event like this, comes along with a great deal of grief, confusion and bitterness.

Officer McDonald was told he was going to be working with a new partner. -A Christian partner. Over the movie his partner eventually get's down to Officer McDonald's heart, and that's where the word ""GRACE"" blows up in the video!

-It is a very good movie, if there are any LEO's out there wondering ""how realistic is the Law-Enforcement half?"" -It's pretty good. LEO family and humor is there, and the reality of the calls are okay, you'll notice on a few calls you tell yourself ""Umm... That wouldn't happen for real."" But for the most part, I'd give the ""realness"" of the LEO half a 80-90%.

-It's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone!! If you have any other questions, ask me and I'll do my best! :)",1326153600,6,1794,4.570093457943925
4489889,3,B004X0MHEU,"The reviews of this movie looked great on the message of forgiveness, something that keeps so many of us in bondage way too long.  However, I was sadly disappointed in this movie.  It was not well-made, not even comparable to the Sherwood movies (Flywheel, Facing the Giants, Fireproof, Courageous).  The interview in the extras shows the (producer/director?) saying that when he saw Fireproof he thought, ""we can do that too"".  Sorry, but they failed.  The idea of forgiveness in a movie is great.  But this movie spent the first 1-1 1/4 hours setting up/showing how bitter the main character is about the death of his son (all very dark).  Then in the last 25ish minutes, the reversal happens.  This transformation period was my favorite part of the whole movie, tear-provoking & touching (somewhat resembling Sherwood movies)...but the brevity of this portion of the movie really ruins the moment.  It's like they were setting up the movie and then realized how long it was and slapped an end on it.  It would have been much better if they spent just 30-40 minutes setting everything up, more time on the reversal/transformation of hearts, then the end could be 10 minutes of showing the characters walking through life with their new/changed hearts.  I have to honestly say your time would be MUCH better spent watching the Sherwood movies, which are deep & truly life-changing.",1326067200,15,1382,4.9393939393939394

Everyone rushes out to see the high tech , large budget films with the a list stars and waist 2 or more hours of our life on these sex ridden violent films. Then we wonder what is wrong with today's youth and where have the family values gone. This is the type of movie that family's need to watch together and talk.  We need to get back to talking not texting not posting on Facebook but talking be it face to face or on the phone talk to your family your friends and your neighbors.

The two main characters do an excellent job, especially Mac. He played the hardened, bitter husband and father without seeming overdone. Watching this movie as a parent and a Christian, I placed myself in his shoes. What would I do if it was my child? Could I forgive? I hope so. The end scene was truly amazing. I cannot say some of what happened in the film wasn't a bit ""saw that coming"", but watching Mac break down emotionally and the love of his friend moved me as I thought about the way God orchestrates our lives, bringing people in for a season. This isn't a film easily forgotten after viewing. As for some of the complaints about this movie, no, it may not be in your face preaching and maybe isn't all you think a Christian movie should be (though I thought it was!) but it's clean and the message is powerful, so ease up.

We found out about The Grace Card after viewing another christian movie, as The Grace Card was one of the previews, and after seeing the preview I knew that I wanted to view the movie and add the movie to our movie collection.

This movie was great family entertainment, clean entertainment. This movie really did Bless my family and I.. For me it was right on time because I am dealing with difficult co workers (which is an understatement) and this movie helped me to see the Grace and Forgiveness that I needed. The main characters helped me to see that the difficult people that I am dealing with are really showing me that it is not about me, But about Grace and Forgiveness. It is about being a light in dark places. God places you in hostile environments so that we can change the atmosphere and win souls.

I pray more movies like this one are made, because there is a hunger for this genre, souls are hungry and this is one great way to feed them and to start a grass roots movement in many communities to take those communities back, families back, marriages back, etc.

The characters did an awesome job, The producers did an awesome job, everyone involved in this movie all the actors and the individuals that worked behind the scenes with this movie did an awesome job. The quality of the movie was awesome, I knew I had to find this movie and share this movie with my family. Which they loved the movie as well. I will continue to show this movie to family and friends and as many individuals as I can.

I like how this movie showed the issues that many families face on a daily basis. Many just don't want to talk about it. I am glad that The Grace Card was created made into a movie. This movie was right on time for my soul have after having a hectic day at work.

This movie will inspire you, fill your spirits and touch many souls.. We are so blessed to have viewed this movie and to add the movie to our collection.

We have movie night and this was one of the movies we chose to view on our  movie night

4489904,4,B004X0MHEU,"The Grace Card is a good, impactful movie about the power of grace and forgiveness, and how a little grace could go a long way in solving modern society's many problems - a good thesis, no doubt. The acting, casting, etc. are done quite well, and the story seems to draw you in. It's quite an emotional film, to say the least. You could say it hammers you a little too much emotionally, but overall, I think it's alright. And it has the added benefit of correcting those woefully ignorant of the extent of racism in modern America (heh heh, thinking of myself here).

Of course...I must admit, I'm a sucker for theology, and I happen to be a conservative evangelical. I certainly don't expect - much less demand - that every movie ought to line up with my beliefs. That's not my point here. But if you share a viewpoint similar to my own, I just want to let you know that this movie, despite having Christian leanings, is pretty liberal theologically. For example, despite the fact that this is a CHRISTIAN movie that's all about GRACE and FORGIVENESS, Jesus Christ is never once mentioned. Sure, they talk about God, and church, and Christianity, and crosses are depicted. But they never talk about Jesus, or the sacrifice he made on the cross that brought us forgiveness. Odd, to say the least. And if you share my belief system, pretty disturbing too.

Also, in one scene, the preacher says that justice will not bring peace, but grace will. I agree in the sense that grace is certainly necessary, but justice is also important. After all, the reason why Jesus Christ died for our sins was not only to serve the cause of grace, but also the cause of justice. After all, if God didn't need to serve justice, there would be no need for an atoning sacrifice, and thus, Christ would've died for nothing. As it is, however, BOTH grace AND justice were served.

Moving on from all that theology stuff, I'm also somewhat bothered by the fact that a person as unstable as Mac was permitted to be a policeman and carry a gun...but that's a minor problem. I also believe that, despite its theological difficulties, this is still a pretty good movie that makes a good point. Grace and forgiveness are certainly VERY critical, and it's always good to be reminded of that. And like I said, the movie is well-done, well-written, and interesting.

My overall opinion is that this is a good movie, and even if you share my point of view theologically, as long as you are aware of the flaws, you'll probably be able to enjoy it, and maybe get somethng out of it. But make sure you are aware.

This film does two thing it brings a Christian Kinder garden if you will to someone that will maybe not set still if you mention Christ more than 5 times in an 1.5 hour movie.  It also addresses a race problem which I see all the time among supposed Christians.  I am white and grew up in the 50s and 60s in the south and remember what went on.  It's hard to believe we still need healing there but we do.  So I think this film is just right for just who needs to see it.  If you don't get it maybe it isn't for you but there is a message and it will speak to someone who needs it.  Remember our primary purpose is to carry the message to the non-believer this does that.  If you don't think is has enough Christ good you you probably don't need it but someone does.  I plan on spreading it around to anybody. I enjoyed it.  Yes the acting was not perfect but I've seen very little big money going into this type of film.  If all your worried about is that acting quality then maybe you have a problem and you need to remember the primary purpose or maybe you need to be less critical of the message carrier and more open to the message. Would you be as critical of your church Christmas pageant?  I doubt anybody got rich on this film.",1316908800,,1510,4.162068965517242

4489925,5,B004X0MHEU,"I did not know what to expect from this movie, and yet I walked away more than satisfied. Where most Hollywood movies might leave a viewer feeling hopeless for the world, The Grace Card achieves the opposite effect. Where self-destructive behavior and angry revenge is promoted in other movies, The Grace Card promotes the only effective and positive solution.

It also happens to be the most difficult solution for many of us. Forgiving those who actively work to harm us or our family is a major accomplishment. Caring for those who make themselves very difficult to tolerate is a masterful achievement. It is from the powerful example of Jesus Christ.

The Grace Card is a well-made movie that also contains a gift that is given to everyone who watches it. You will be blessed to receive it and even more blessed to accept it.",1316822400,,829,4.75

4489927,2,B004X0MHEU,"As a Christian I looked forward to this film as a tool, opening doors to explain the Gospel to others. I read how the makers had worked with Sherwood, creators of three very good films, and I anticipated that this would be along the same line. It was not.

The Grace Card presents a Christless, crossless Christianity. I counted the name of Jesus five times in an hour and a half: once when the protagonist is half humming, half singing ""Jesus Loves Me"" and the name Jesus slips out; twice in a background song by Third Day (not totally sure of the artists) and (only) twice spoken in conversation - both times by the same person (not the pastor/protagonist) and in consecutive sentences, something like, ""Jesus' ministry wasn't in the  church. Jesus' ministry was in the streets."" Was the omission of the Name above every name intentional? It would almost seem to have been, for at the very end, as a visitor to the church gives his testimony, he speaks of 'giving his life to his Father', where surely even the most basic believer would have said, if only out of the habit of using the most common phrase, 'gave my life to Jesus.' In a hospital scene, where Pastor Sam's kids ask how a transplant can work between a black man and a white one, Debra, Sam's wife tells them that inside, we are all the same. Surely this was an obvious moment for any Christian parent to have at least said that 'inside, God made us all the same.' The film talks about 'the Lord' and 'the Father' and 'God', but stops short of anything that would actually offend Hollywood or an unbelieving religious person. Most average Americans would find the show acceptable on a religious level, well within that with which they are comfortable. Even a Muslim, though perhaps uncomfortable with scenes of people in church and unfamiliar with the concept of forgiveness, could find the theme palatable and worth considering, without giving a thought to Christ.

No mention of the cross. No mention of the resurrection. No mention even of the Bible, except that Grandpa shows a copy of Great-Grandpa's Bible to the pastor. The message revolves around forgiving one another (a worthy topic), but never gives the basis for that forgiveness: The Bible, the cross and the empty tomb.

The character of the pastor showed strange deficiencies in spiritual life. The wife, who was perhaps the closest to a genuinely edifying character, must remind her husband to pray, then pick up the prayer when the pastor says he can't pray because he is too hungry. We DO see him reading something which we assume (I assume?) is a Bible. Yet even when he attempts to witness to his partner Mac, the message is simply, 'God hasn't given up on you.'

The 'conversion' scene - if indeed it is supposed to be a conversion scene - is simply Sam and Mac at an altar, praying that Mac's son won't die. A step toward God for this man who apparently did not even believe in God's existence, but hardly repentance toward God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

Photography was acceptable, even surprising for an indie movie with a limited budget. Acting was varied but believable. The story line, though somewhat predictable, was nevertheless moving, if notably devoid in genuine Christian substance. However, it could have been, SHOULD have been, so much more. I am not asking for, and the public doesn't need, a theological film, but surely we can produce a film that makes clear the central truths of what Christians believe.

Dr. Evans, you can do better! Calvary Church, don't lose the Gospel in your desire to put out a Christian film. Come on, guys! Do it better!",1316563200,24,3611,4.686119873817034

Dad had made bad, bad decisions all his life.  His family suffers...especially the son.  There is something special with mom for putting up with dad this whole time.  (This is NO ""Love DARE"" movie!!)  Or perhaps it is the very dark side of some of the characters in that movie....

The pastor/co-worker is just so wanting to do the right thing.... sometimes he tries and screws up... other times in a perfect opportunity, he doesn't try  when he should... Wow!! Huh!! Duh!!.... Kinda, just like me and how I witness to folks......

Where Clint E. had ""The Unforgiven""... This flick should really be re-named ""The Forgiven, The Forgiven, and Re-forgiven""...OR;  ""Forgive, Forgiven, Forgivness is Free.""

This is the movie to keep you on edge with a mixed bag of feelings and surprises;  ""Is he that dumb?""  ""Is he really going to do that?!""  ""Is that really going to fix the problem?  ""  Boy, he'd better fix that one before too long!!!!  Can't any of them at one time or another see what they are doing to someone else?

When the two cops were pared together, I said, boy this is going to be too much.  But I saw the demure and peaceful attitude of the Black cop/pastor and I knew he would make a change in this man who had so much hatred in him against Blacks, because one killed his son.

This was a great and powerful movie, and I was not disappointed at all about the whole movie.  The end was even more powerful and it will make you shed a few tears.  Lou Gossett was great in this movie. I just love him. He always brings so much righteousness to a movie and his characters.

GREAT MOVIE MADE. I JUST WISH AMAZON HAD IT 2 BUY. I LIKE TO KEEP MOVIES LIKE THIS IN MY COLLECTION.  Saw it on christian website. Will have to buy from them.

It is a movie that reminds us of another time when ""love your neighbor"" stood for more than a sign on the wall...it was a way of life.

The Grace Card is really different. This movie proves great actors and stories can come from the Christian community.
Besides the acting, the story itself is a winner. It is a very touching, emotional movie that will bring tears to your eyes.
The Grace Card is full of hurting, blame, loss, forgiveness and sacrifice.
The main story is when someone does something against you, you will forgive them and love them even if they don't ask-that's The Grace Card.
My three youngest children 17, 18 and 20 watched it and approved it. They are hard to please, but have really loved it and will watch it again.
The end of this movie is so fantastic and amazing you will be brought to tears.
I give this the highest rating possible. A must see movie!

4489944,5,B004X0MHEU,"This movie will completely move you to tears. An emotional roller coaster from the first scene where Mac McDonald (Michael Joiner) and his family are put through the hardest of life's tragedies as his young son is killed by a drug deal gone bad. While the police are pursuing the dealer, Tyler rides directly into the path of the dealer's car.

Now the family, 17 years later is still struggling in the various stages of grief. For Mac, it's getting over the hate he still feels for the boy who took the life of his son. Even though he doesn't say he's a racist, his actions confirm that he is being held captive. Now partnered with Sam Wright (Mike Higgenbottom), who's an up and coming pastor and who just received the promotion that Mac had hoped he would get, he is faced with his greatest enemy.

Sam Wright is trying to get his church started so he can quit to police force, however he too struggles with his messages when he can't even find a way to reach a hurt and wounded man he is partnered with everyday who hates him simply based on his skin color.

Blake is the remaining son who is on the verge of not graduating in his senior year due to his grades. He is still dealing with trying to live up to Tyler even though the accident happened 17 years ago. He turns to the wrong crowd since being at home with his mom and dad only leads to more arguments. His dad, Mac, believes he will never measure up to his expectations.

Louis Gossett Jr. plays a small role as the grandfather of Sam who teaches him about what the definition of grace means through a story of a slave owner on a plantation. This movie is well produced and the storyline will impact you no matter where you stand in life.

I received the DVD, The Grace Card, compliments of Propeller and Provident Films for my honest review and once again LOVE that movies like this are being made for families again. The message is relevant to anyone who questions what the meaning of grace is and how forgiveness works in any situation we face in life. A word of caution: you WILL need tissues for this one. I highly recommend this movie to any family looking for a great story with a message behind it. This is a 5 out of 5 stars DVD.",1313798400,7,2201,4.319612590799031
4489945,4,B004X0MHEU,"Overflowing with saving grace, unconditional forgiveness, and abounding love, The Grace Card packs a powerful message into an intense and captivating story plot. While police officers Mac McDonald and Sam Wright can't imagine why they've suddenly been teamed up together, they soon learn that God has a purpose for everything.

Mac's life is in shambles. Having never been able to get over the sudden death of his oldest son nearly 17 years before, Mac's withdrawal and anger is hurting his wife, his other son, and his job. Prejudice of African-Americans (due to the fact that it was a black drug dealer who killed his son) Mac baulks when the police force teams him up with newly-promoted Sergeant Mac McDonald--an African-American, and a preacher to boot. Sam isn't all too crazy about having Mac as a buddy either. Mac doesn't like him just because of the color of his skin, and won't listen to him when out on the streets. What to do?

The two main actors who played Mac and Sam were great. There were several actors who seemed a bit dead--as if they were reading the script instead of acting--and that got a bit annoying. The music is contemporary Christian, which I personally didn't mind, but others might.

The Grace Card deals with the sensitive racial issue, as well as several other topics. Because of heated arguments and fights and other disturbing scenes, I wouldn't recommend this for younger children. Teens would probably learn a lot through this book, so I highly recommend it to them.

All in all, I found The Grace Card a very enjoyable movie. Perfect to watch as a family with the teens. So go grab the popcorn and get ready for an intense, fast-action, thought-provoking, tear-jerking movie!

4489947,5,B004X0MHEU,"Written by a 14 year old Girl:
My family and I really really enjoyed watching the movie ""The Grace Card"". It was an incredible movie with great themes and very moving and inspiring messages. My brothers playfully teased my mom and I about our tears after the movie because they had seen us crying during one of several emotional scenes.

The Grace Card: ""I promise to pray for you every day, ask your forgiveness, grant you the same, and always be your friend"".

Mac is a man who has been drowning in guilt and anger for seventeen years. When his five year old son, Tyler, was killed by a black drug dealer's car, Mac's family fell apart and Mac became a racist police man so that his tragedy would not happen to any one else and he could feel less guilty for destroying his family. His other son, Blake, loves his mom but can't stand the level of perfection his dad expects of him because the standard his father holds him up to is his dead five year old brother. Mac's wife can't get a job because she fell at work and now has a disability. 17 years have gone by since the death of their 5 year old son and their family is falling apart.

Sam is Mac's new police partner and a pastor who is working hard to get enough money so that he can become a full time preacher. Since Sam is black and Mac is a racist, their relationship doesn't start as a friendly one.  Sam doesn't understand why God has put Mac into his life, but his wife thinks that God has put Sam into Mac's life.  It turns out their both right as tragedy strikes Mac's family once again and finally brings Mac to his knees before God.  It is through Sam's friendship and sacrifice that Mac sees God's Grace and is able to share it with another who has hurt him deeply.  This story is about Grace, not judgement.  It is about forgiveness, not prejudice.  It is about God

This is a great movie and I learned a lot from it. It had many great messages about friendship, family, love, racism, murder, stealing and grace. It was very inspiring and perfectly appropriate for all ages.  Our family is 5 years to 45 years and I highly recommend it.
