It's an excellent grouping of characters and episodes, and the cheaper the better!",1513209600,,259,4.777777777777778
8474435,4,B005IA9JUO,"Video arrived on time and in good working condition. Good quality in regards to color, but do keep in mind some shows are older than others and may have been produced in a lower film resolution as compared to today's film technology. Nevertheless, even the older animations are still good quality viewing. Have had it now for 4 months and it continues to play without any issues. It was a great value for 8 HIT favorites my child already enjoys watching.",1437955200,,454,4.617283950617284
