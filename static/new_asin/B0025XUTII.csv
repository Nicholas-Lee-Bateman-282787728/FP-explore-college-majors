3849900,3,B0025XUTII,"Caution: Contains Spoilers

Never before have I seen such a desparate production of absurdity painted as hopefully possible.

In a nutshell:  An average mildly conservative college boy entering his last summer before college graduation, give him a gangster dad, a minimum wage job where his more-mature boss sexually harasses him, then introduce a beautiful young couple that both seduce him to spend his last summer with them, partying, vacationing, home invasion, robbery, riding her, getting ridden by him, and of course choosing to continue getting ridden by him, since that's so much better than Sienna Miller (duh!)  ... what a gem of a story

I'll give it 3 stars; the acting, directing, and cinematography were all top notch; the story itself is totally absurd.  If it were more honest, it would have painted the protagonist as more gay to begin with.. because average college guys don't take it in the can.",1253664000,2,915,5.026490066225166
3849901,4,B0025XUTII,"For those who find it difficult to appreciate the adaptation format of film making from a famous novel, THE MYSTERIES OF PITTSBURGH as now released on DVD should help explain the naysayers' opinions.  In a very valuable session of conversations among Michael Chabon and Rawson Marshall Thurber (screenwriter and director) and the producer and cast, the transition of this complex novel into a very altered story is comfortably explained and the person most happy with the result seems to be the originator - Michael Chabon!

That being said  this film stands well on its own terms. June and July in hot Pittsburgh generate mysteries among a variety of people, especially the young college graduate Art Bechstein (Jon Foster) who while working in a bookstore wastes time with a fling with the supervisor Phlox (Mena Suvari) with disinterested post grad classes dealing with becoming a broker and having monthly dinners with his mobster father Joe Bechstein (Nick Nolte), until he encounters an odd couple: bisexual biker and thief Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard) and his female consort, the violinist Jane Bellwether (Sienna Miller).  The bizarre interactions among these characters drive Art to make many decisions and discoveries - including his falling in love with both Cleveland and Jane.  The summer winds down with Art finally discovering his own identity despite the clouds of mystery that have surrounded his life.  It is a piece of life as lived by disparate characters whose direction in life seems at odds with the natural flow of finding happiness and success.  But then the question is asked - what is happiness and what is success if not survival?

For this viewer the explanation by the makers of this film was interesting enough to encourage a repeat watching of the movie. A good movie not a great movie, but it still tastes strongly of Michael Chabon's genius.  It deserves more attention than the critics have given it.....Grady Harp, August 09",1249689600,23,1959,5.077881619937695
3849902,3,B0025XUTII,"The beginning captivates the viewer and the movies has a decent story. Having said that, it's also worth mentioning that the storyline is hardly Michael Chabon's and why the changes were made (from the book) is unclear, however, as a stand-alone it seems to work (if you ignore that it's a novel adaptation and think of it as a standalone film). It's no the most engaging movie nor is it the worst movie ever. If you haven't read the book or don't mind watching the movie and can refrain from comparing it to the book, there's a good chance that you'll like it.",1242691200,8,561,4.456310679611651

3849905,2,B0025XUTII,"Art (Jon Foster) works at the Book Barn by choice as he studies for his exams. His dad (Nick Nolte) is a crime boss who has a job lined up for Art who lacks assertiveness. Phlox (Mena Suvari) is his boss and sex partner at the Book Barn. He meets Jane (Sienna Miller) at a party and they hit it off. She is athletic, sexy, charming, talented, and drinks to excess. She also has a boyfriend, Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard) ""like the state"" who we soon find out is bisexual. The three of them start hanging out together.

The first thing you notice is the annoying narration by Art because they couldn't make a decent screen adaptation. The characters of Art and his dad were poorly constructed. When they got together, you just wished the scene would be over. Jane is an interesting character who we never got to know, and Cleveland is a character we perhaps learned too much about. This is a story of Art trying to find himself one summer in Pittsburgh. For hard core indie lovers and clearly not my cup of tea, but an offering that might go good with ""Milk"".

3849906,1,B0025XUTII,"This movie was so bad, that I didn't even finish watching it. Part of the movie was filmed im my former neighborhood, which was nice to see, but between the gratuitous sex and the two lead male characters engaging in a kissing-fest, I had had enough.",1320796800,,250,4.456521739130435
3849907,4,B0025XUTII,"My biggest problem with the Mysteries of Pittsburgh is that the description is *nothing* like I had hoped.  It's misleading, in fact.  The description says action/adventure.  What?  Consider the name of the film and then the ""action/adventure"" tag and well, this ain't exactly an adventure now, is it?

Well, what we get instead is... a storyline about a young man who has a pesky old man for a father constantly questioning what he's going to do with his life.  ""You can't spend your entire summer being a lazy bum and hanging out with thugs!""  That's basically what his father says.  He never gives the poor kid a break.  He's also connected to the mob so his son always chooses his words carefully, and fearful that he might upset his father.  They only meet up at restaurants to chit chat and never anywhere else.  Well, until later.

The young man has problems of his own.  He's having frequent sex with his workmate/girlfriend at a bookstore.  Eventually he grows tired of her when he discovers a REALLY attractive blonde at a party.  From there, the REAL story kicks in.

Now it's about the young man having a huge crush on the blonde girl, but unfortunately for him she has a boyfriend.  Isn't that always how it is?  Yes, it's *always* like that, in both real life and the movies!

Well, the interesting thing about this storyline is that the young man develops a friendship with the blonde AND her boyfriend, and many times all three of them hang out together.  Interesting.  Of course there's a crucial storyline twist later on (actually make that TWO twists) that's quite surprising to me, but like always, I refuse to give away unnecessary spoilers.  Sorry!

Overall, it's alright.  I feel there wasn't quite enough suspense or storyline direction to warrant a purchase of a film that's only above average at best, however you can go ahead and rent the Mysteries of Pittsburgh as part of a one-time viewing.  It's good enough for that.",1313971200,,1948,4.70919881305638
3849908,3,B0025XUTII,"In 2000, I saw a great movie, Wonder Boys, and immediately bought the book. When I finished the book, I picked up Michael Chabon's other two novels, The Mysteries of Pittsburg and Kavalier & Clay. Since reading Pittsburg in 2000, I have re-read it three times, most recently when I heard the movie was being made. Upon release, I read several reviews trashing this movie. In the movie, Art (Ben Foster) is a recent college grad trying to figure out what to do with his life when he meets Cleveland (Peter Sarsgaard) and Jane (Sienna Miller). The first 15 minutes are pretty annoying with Art delivering tons of exposition in voice overs. Eventually, the voice overs stop, (well, they stop until the end of the movie), and then I didn't hate it as much. The movie is well shot. I really liked the music. They use a great Ryan Adams song, The Rescue Blues. Sienna Miller is stunning and I've been a fan of Jon Foster ever since I saw him in Life As We Know It. The movie is fine, not good, just fine.  If I hadn't read Chabon's first three books before seeing this movie, this would not have convinced me to check out the books. Buy Wonder Boys, unquestionably a better movie. It might motivate you to shut your TV off for a while, and read Pittsburgh, Wonder Boys, and/or Kavalier & Clay. This one won't. This flick is not as bad as everyone made it out to be, but not exactly good either.  Mediocrity at best, worth a rental. . . a three star rental.",1306800000,2,1450,4.386617100371748

3849911,3,B0025XUTII,"Shedding A Little Light On The Mysteries ... In the summer of 1991, on August 18th, at the SEEDS OF SOUND (Rock Mount Trashmore!) Ecology Benefit Concert held in Lowell, Massachusetts by the banks of the Merrimack River, a trio up on stage by the name of The Croutons  performed three songs, all by The Grateful Dead: China Cat Sunflower, Scarlet Begonias, and Franklin's Tower. Who would have known back then that this performance would have been so prophetic? ... There are a lot of `Cloud Factory' towers in the city of Lowell, MA - home of capitalist, industrial revolution in the western hemisphere, and now an urban national park full of renovated mills with giant smokestacks sticking up into the sky along the horizon line (See the movie: The Invention of Lying!).
Michael Chabon is a hugely successful and talented writer. This is a fact, as well as an undeniable certainty. The author himself, humbly, attributes his success to innate talent, disciplined hard work, and a little luck. If only all creative people with such gifted talent were as diligent as he in their artistic pursuits! The real Claire in The Mysteries of Pittsburgh once said to me that it was actually she who taught Michael Chabon how to write, being a year older than him. I find this hard to believe after having read this book and seen this movie adaptation of it. Having also seen (but not read) Wonder Boys, I am absolutely certain that Michael Chabon's gifts as writer were innate and formidable, and if anything, the real Claire (a fellow, mutable, communicative Gemini like himself) only may have had a helping hand as a literary midwife in encouraging his unique and original literary talent. If so, that was a good thing.
This book has a passage in it on pages 77 and 78 that is referenced, tangentially, in the movie and which is all about alcoholics. It says: ""In my innocent cynicism I didn't see that Cleveland was not trying to look tough; he just didn't care. Which is to say, he knew what he was, and was, if not content with, at least resigned to knowing that he was an alcoholic. And an alcoholic is nothing if not sensitive to the proper time and place for his next drink; his death is one of the most carefully planned and prepared for events in the world. Cleveland simply foresaw his imminent need for another beer."" ... WO! ... I mean, how old was Michael Chabon when he wrote this passage, 24, 25? For a 24 or 25 year old, first time novelist to come up with such a profoundly insightful line is the work of pure genius at best, and at worst, shows incredible insight into the psyche of alcoholics. It's possible that the real Cleveland (also a friend of the real Claire) may have actually verbalized this characteristic to Michael when they were buddies together at Carnegie-Mellon, or that Michael came to this conclusion about alcoholics on his own by simply observing their habits and missteps. Who can say for sure? Nevertheless, not only is this passage one of the most profound in the book, it is one of the most profound passages I have ever read in any book - fiction or school tectbook. It shows great understanding of the psychology of alcoholism from a perspective that is unusually and keenly insightful. Even sociology and criminology (after all, suicide is technically a felony and a serious crime) text books in college do not get this deep into the behavior of substance abusers. ... Also, how prophetic in regards to the actual death of the real Cleveland, who was a serious alcoholic found dead in his bedroom in Pittsburgh, circa 2001, with an empty bottle of vodka on the floor, an empty bottle of pills on the floor, and a picture of the real Claire by his bedside. I mean, the whole thing blows the mind!
Is it possible that the real Cleveland, who was heterosexual (unlike he is depicted in the movie), was influenced by what he had read in Michael Chabon's `fictitious' (Kerouacian) book about what he and all of his friends in Pittsburg had experienced while living on or near Squirrel Hill and the Polish section of the city where Andy Warhol had lived at one time? Maybe? Ya think? I wonder if Michael Chabon himself has ever given a thought to this? I mean, the prophetic nature of it all is astounding! I was one of the first people to watch this movie when it came out on DVD, having just recently read the book a week before for the first time in order to prepare myself for the movie. Also, I just recently purchased, in hardcover, Michael Chabon's latest book - his first book of non fiction - entitled, Manhood for Amateurs: The Pleasures  and Regrets of a Husband, Father, and Son, and I wonder if he mentions in there anything about this and the death of the real Cleveland. The real Cleveland, obviously, is the hero and major character of this book and this movie - and rightly so. He had a larger than life personality, in a way, and from everything I've been told was quite a charming, humorous, and interesting character with a great gift for conversation. The real Cleveland did go out to the family bungalow on the lake in order to get away from it all. The real Cleveland had a father who was gay, and a mother who killed herself. The real Cleveland supplied a lot of literary fodder for Michael Chabon's first novel.

As for the real Claire, she really does love Joni Mitchell and the films of Franco Zeffirelli (who is gay as well as a devout Catholic). She really does love Romeo and Juliet, Brother Sun - Sister Moon, and Jesus of Nazareth, and she really does idolize John and Yoko, The Beatles, Saint Francis and Claire (where the name comes from, obviously!), and Jesus and Mary Magdeline. That Michael Chabon makes reference to some of this in his book is quite revealing. I have seen, with my own eyes, the actual record albums he mentions in the novel! What he does not mention is that the real Art's real father took the real Claire out to one of the fancy restaurants in the movie, and told her she was to no longer have anything to do with his son, and that he was taking his son out of Carnegie-Mellon and enrolling him, instead - away from her - into the University of Pittsburgh. This was done, according to the book, because she suffered from ""dementia praecox"" (page 10), but according to the real Claire, she was told that it was done because she was Catholic and Michael was Jewish. It is true that all of Michael's books seem to heavily reflect themes of Jewish culture, that he married and has children with a Jewish woman (just like his father wanted him to), and he is involved in the Peace Now movement in Israel (a very good thing, indeed.) So, did the real Art in the movie and in the book break away from the influence of his father, or did he voluntarily embrace that agenda? Only Michael Chabon himself knows the answers to all thse questions.
Another confusing aspect to the book as well as the movie that needs to be cleared up is the relationship between Art and Arthur Lecompte. The real Arthur Lecompte is gay, and not bisexual, and the real Arthur Lecompte was also a friend of the real Claire's and the real Cleveland's. The movie combines the characters or Arthur and Cleveland into one person. Also, the book and the movie seem to bifurcate the real character of Claire into two different people. Whether or not there is a real Phlox Lombardi and a real Jane Bellwether, I do not know. But I do know this: the two characters of Phlox and Jane are totally and respectfully representative of the two sides of the complex character of the real Claire. It's almost as if Michael Chabon, the clever writer that he is, bifurcated the realClaire into two different characters: one, the negative, suspicious, controlling, jealous, dominating, violent Phlox, and the other, the positive, trusting, fun loving, adventurous, tolerant, musical, charming Jane. I mean, it's uncanny! The fact that Art had a sexual affair with Arthur was traumatic to the real Claire.

The book reads like a recent college graduate's fond memories of his college experiences with all of his friends. He pays tribute to and honors their memories. But it is more than an introspective reflection on the past. As a novel of `fiction,' it really works well as a work of literary art. The movie, on the other hand,  does not work as well as the book. If you love the book, you  may not love the movie. If you've never read the book, you actually might like the movie more. The cinematography is excellent, and it shows Pittsburgh in a nice light. As a screenplay, it's not the greatest. But it does entertain and expose the decadent and nihilistic eighties in a way that hits home. The ending is tragic - in the book, the movie, and as well as real life.  ...

That said, I was glad to see Jon Foster again, having enjoyed his work in The Door in the Floor.  Saarsgard is as good as ever, and Sienna Miller was wonderful as the woman caught between these troubled men.  Nick Nolte also makes a fine turn as the very unpleasant and controlling father.

I guess it was supposed to be suggestive and titillating. The ""boyfriend"" is either gay or bi. Yet ""Jane"" is his girlfriend. However, they enjoy hanging out with Art (another guy). Why? Is it because the boyfriend (""Cleveland""-also dumb) likes him? Or because he finds the idea of Art and Jane together enticing? If there was a plot here I couldn't figure out what it was.
