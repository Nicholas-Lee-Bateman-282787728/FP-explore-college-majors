8122448,4,B000FGL7YW,"I got a copy of this ""Raro Video"" release from Exploited Cinema. This release is very likely an uncut version compared with the US releases. Note that the audio comes in original Italian with English subtitles, which I consider much better than a usually poor English dubbing. Extras include a documentary with enterviews to people that talk about the cinema of director Mario Bava. Contrary to some, the only commonality between Bay of Blood (actually a more precise translation from the Italian title would be ""chain reaction"") and the subsequent Tuesday the 13th, is a scene in which a loving couple that is stubbed to death with a spur. The main motive here has to do with several people killing each other to inherit a property surrounded by a bay. Overall, a must have for Bava fans.",1231545600,,789,4.766423357664234
