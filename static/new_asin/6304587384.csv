920822,3,6304587384,"I could not disagree that this is a great film.  Moving and subtle in its treatment of deep emotions, with great acting.  Unfortunately, the sound quality of the DVD was really poor.  Full of static, and sometimes shaky. As other reviewers pointed out, the screen was often very dark, and facial details couldn't be seen clearly when they mattered. In addition, some important lines were not translated in the subtitles. Such a great film deserves to be restored by Criterion! I'll make a few more comments on the camera work, assuming that the DVD captured it accurately: the scene with Charu on the swing was interesting, with more adventurous camera work, compared with the earlier Apu trilogy and Devi. The scene with the storm, just before Amol arrived, was also done to great effect. Yet it is Ray's sense of drama and timing, and his ability to draw out the subtleties of emotions, that make his films great. I'm not convinced that the lighting was as good as it should be, although it is difficult to tell from the DVD. There were some awkward jumps, and in some shots, e.g. of shoes or feet, the timing or the framing didn't seem quite right to me.

The excellent bio of Satyajit Ray by Andrew Robinson mentions several things that might be unclear to Western viewers.  The 19th century romantic novelist Bankim Chandra Chatterjee was influential at the time of the story, and he encouraged Rabindranath Tagore, whose ""Nastanirh"" was the source for the film. Before agreeing to cooperate with the bio, Ray told Robinson that he needed to learn Bengali. In his chapter on Charulata, Robinson tells of the many allusions, especially to Bankim, that are used in the dialogue of the film. As Amon is an aspiring writer, and Charu shows her ability to write, writing is a major theme of the film, and these allusions - which I can't appreciate fully - must contribute to the texture of the story. The contrast between the imaginative life of literature and the more mundane political life is comically evident when Amon tries to read a poem, and Bhupati won't let him get past the first line, with his literal quibbling. The ""man of the world"" has no chance in this contest, because both Tagore and Ray are the poetic creators of the story!

I'll wait for a better DVD before viewing this film again. Ideally, the translation should be more complete, with subtitles that last long enough to be read, and supplemental material to provide more insight into the literary allusions.  Cleaning up the sound track should be easy.  I have a 55"" screen of good quality, and I would hope that a better DVD would show this film as well as it appeared in theatres.",1363305600,2,2657,4.698924731182796
920823,5,6304587384,"The fact that this wonderful film has not got a decent DVD release is beyond comprehension. Following his acclaimed ""Apu Trilogy"" Ray made films that were arguably better, though unfortunately they didn't get as much attention as the aforementioned trilogy ('Pather Panchali', 'Aparajito' and 'The World of Apu')--Charulata (1964) was one of them. It was critically acclaimed at the time, garnering Ray his second Silver Bear for Best Director at the Berlin Film Festival, and the director cites it as his favorite film--he said it was the one with the 'fewest flaws' (which is saying a LOT; Ray directed over 30 films in career spanning four decades).

The story is based on a novella written by Nobel prize winning author Rabindranath Tagore called the ""Broken Nest"": set in 19th century Calcutta, when India was still under British colonial rule, it tells the story of Charu (Madhabi Mukherjee) who leads a lonely life at the start of the film--her husband's attention is fully devoted to the paper he is running, hence Charu is left performing menial duties, trapped in a lavish household. This is ingeniously shown by the director sans one word of dialog in the opening sequence: Charu flits from window to window with her opera glasses, observing mundane details of the outside world like a curious child. Ray always felt cinema was a visual medium, dialog was a secondary device, the internal conflicts of the protagonists in his films can be understood by a single close-up, glance or subtle gesture; the characters surrounding landscapes--be it a mansion as in ""The Music Room"" or the village in ""Pather Panchali"" was captured and conveyed poetically to enhance the emotions running through the characters, and in ""Charulata"" the lavish household Charu occupies is a gilded cage holding her hostage, not only physically but intellectually. All this changes when Charu's husband's cousin, Amal, comes along.

Amal is a free-bird, the antithesis of Charu's husband: he is spontaneous, playful and happens to be a writer. Discovering in her wife a knack for literature, Charu's husband asks Amal to help her with her writing. During the process, their feelings for each other go beyond a mentor-student relationship. Nowadays this is where directors/writers resort to cheap sex scenes or loud confrontation to emphasize the conflict, but Satyajit Ray masterfully handles the ensuing sexual tension without resorting to gratuitous sexuality or verbosity. A famous scene in the film elaborates Charu's growing affection for Amal without a word of dialog or physical contact: Charu is on the swing, she swings back and forth while singing ""Fule Fule Dhole Dhole"" and we see a POV shot of Amal lying on the ground beside her--he is constantly swinging in and out of her view, and when she finally settles down on the swing she observes (with her opera glasses) a woman and her baby in a neighboring balcony, then she looks wistfully at Amal. We, as the audience, understand the conflict--no dialog or steamy sex scenes necessary.

""Charulata"" is required viewing for any serious student of film; it's a perfect example of how to tell a story visually, and its a lesson in literary adaptation. For instance, the last scene in the film is said to be the cinematic equivalent of the ending in Tagore's original novella: after Charu's husband finds out about her wife's feelings for Amal, he wanders around aimlessly and comes back home; as they reach out for each other in the doorway, the shot is frozen mid-action and cut to individual still images (close-ups) of Charu and her husband, then cut to a medium shot of both characters, and finally a long shot with the words ""a Broken Nest"" on the screen. It's a haunting ending, with the ominous music soaring in the background--can Charu and her husband ever reconcile?

A great, epic film by one of the finest director's in cinema, no less than a high-quality blu-ray release would do for ""Charulata"".",1338681600,2,3952,5.010654490106545

920877,5,6304587384,"Satyajit Ray was simply one of the greatest auteurs in the history of film.  If you haven't had the privilege of seeing one of his creations, then by all means, please heed my advice.  I was first introduced to Ray's work twenty years ago in a film class I took in college.  I'm no maven in regards to his movies, having only seen five of them.  However, what I can tell you is this, all five of those films were excellent.  This one in particular is a gem and many critics believe it to be his magnum opus.

""Charulata"" (The Lonely Wife) is based on the short story ""Nastanirh"" (The Broken Nest) by Pulitzer Prize winner Rabindranath Tagore (whose work I have yet the pleasure of perusing).  The story takes place in the late 19th century India and tells the tale of a lonely housewife Charu (short for Charulata), very reminiscent of Flaubert's Emma Bovary.  Charu and her rather detached, older husband Bhupati live a quiet, well-to-do life.  She is a very beautiful woman, with tons of money and all the time in the world to enjoy her passions - the arts, literature and poetry.  Yet her workaholic husband seems to be more concerned with his job than his marriage.  And alas, she is all alone, ailing from that distasteful disorder of ennui that seemingly plagues so many kept women.

However, the sun shines a bit brighter for our heroine when Bhupati's young, handsome cousin Amal arrives for a visit.  Bhupati, who is far from a heartless man and feels sympathy for his wife's cheerless plight, encourages his cousin to befriend his wife as they both have so much in common (he loves poetry and the arts as well).  Well, I won't go any further in relating the story line, but as most of you can guess...

I have read in several different articles that this was Ray's favorite film.  That is quite a boast when you consider how many classic, award-winning films this man had been a part of.  I just love this guy's directing!  He was an artist who was able to evoke any emotion he wanted from his actors.  There is typically not a whole lot of dialogue in his films, and he was definitely not one to use any effulgent effects, however I have never seen a director so adept in capturing the intimate feelings of his characters.  Ergo, I would be remiss to not give kudos to the fine cast as well -  Madhabi Mukherjee as Charlu, Soumitra Chatterjee as Amal, and Shailen Mukherjee as Bhupati.  All three give standout performances, especially Madhabi as Charlu and it's no wonder why Ray loved having her as his lead actress for several other films.

There is no violence, foul language, nudity, crude humor, etc... in this 1964 classic.  It's a charming story directed by one of the world's greatest story tellers - simple, yet stylish and sophisticated at the same time.  I can't recommend it enough!",1207958400,9,2806,4.575150300601202
920878,5,6304587384,"If you often visit films of Satyajit Ray, you will recognize many of his actors.  The women in Ray's films are generally beautiful, while the men are with memorable character in their face.  The lead actress in Charulata was also in his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahanagar-The-Big-City/dp/6304587414/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahanagar (The Big City)</a>.  And now she plays the beautiful Charu, ignored and lonely wife, who falls deeply for her assigned mentor, who is her brother-in-law.

What's unique about this love story is that there isn't the usual acknowledgement, no mutual confirmation of love, neither the display of affection.  It's rather one-sided and it is the actress who skillfully must convey to the viewer those feelings.  It is subtle but yet romantic.

Set in 19th century, and released in 1964, Charula (Lonely Wife) lives behind the walls of a grand luxurious place, viewing the outside world through her opera glasses, connecting only with servants, and her husband runs a political newspaper.  He doesn't have much time for Charu, and in order to bring out her writing talent, he asks his brother to mentor her.

Charulata was filmed entirely on set, with great detail to the period and details began with the Victorian bed.  A tedious process was the hanging of printed wallpaper pattern onto plywood.  Satyajit Ray was a remarkable man, a short story writer, graphic designer, and a composer.  His graphic design and musical composition talents were evident.  Music, lyrics and writing play a major role in this film.  The author referenced several times by Charu, Bankim, unknown to most in our world, was a prominent novelist of that era.

This is a lengthy film, at times slow moving, but the depth is the relationship of love without infidelity.  This is said to be Satyajit Ray's favorite work.  Satyajit is a remarkable man.  Rizzo

920879,5,6304587384,"A filmmaker has so many choices to make. What is the pace of the action? How is the scene framed? What is the best sequence of events? How is character condensed into its essence in a few brief moments of imagery? What do you do to build conflict and resolution? Satyajit Ray's Charulata has much to teach about all these questions.

This film is about a highly privileged group of people living in the late 19th century in Calcutta, and a marriage where a beautiful young wife, Charulata, sits bored and alone for weeks on end while her brilliant and preoccupied husband, Bhupati, tends to his other wife: his political newspaper. Bhupati is sensitive enough to understand his wife's frustration and asks his more emotional and romantic brother, Amol, a writer of sentimental romances, to tend to his wife and help her to write. Finally we see Charulata happy, singing, playful, and tending to Amol, mending his clothes and inspiring him to continue writing. Her innocent flirtations catch her offguard as she becomes deeply attached to Amol. Amol also realizes that his emotions are leading him astray. After Bhupati is ruined when his brother in law, whom he trusted and loved, makes off with the newspaper's money, Amol decides to leave, not wanting to take away from Bhupati his ""other"" wife. Charulata is crushed by Amol's departure and inadvertently betrays her emotions to Bhupati. Bhupati is completely disillusioned by these reversals of trust and love. Their marriage is severed. The final freeze frame is of the couple reaching out to hold each other's hand and is captioned, ""The Ruined Nest.""

This rather operatic plot opens slowly and quietly, but it becomes clear that a master is behind the lens as scene after scene move naturally into one another and the framing and pace draw the viewer into the emotion and drama of the story. Satyajit Ray's poetic, artistic, and literary sensibility fully enfolds and engages the viewer, and one realizes that all the right choices have been made. This movie is a master work, but in today's American film culture of fast action, cheap sentiment, and explicit sex, few people will realize it.",1114387200,4,2149,4.917355371900826
920880,5,6304587384,"I hadn't the slightest inkling of this till I recently read Aruna Chakravarty's translation of Sunil Gangopadhyay's 'Pratham Alo' retitled 'First Light'. I had seen the movie Charulata before, but after having read Sunil's novel, I realized that Rabindranath's relationship with his own sister-in-law Kadambari, the wife of Jyotirindranath, was in fact quite similar to that of Amal and Charu in Ray's film. I was further reassured after reading an article in Parabas, in which Univeristy of Chicago's Dr. Clinton Seely commented the same. His own life must have influenced Tagore to write 'Nashta Neer', from which Ray adapted the simply superb Charulata.",1039219200,5,656,5.378640776699029
920881,5,6304587384,"Till I saw Jalsaghar, this was my favourite Ray movie. I have read the book (the translation). This is a film version that does not destroy the book. It is perfect in its storytelling, acting, visually, the music...all of it. Madhabi Mukherjee fits the role like a glove and so do the rest of the cast. I think Amal is infatuated with Charu but Charu's involvement is of course greater. Charu is highly intelligent and has a certain sensibility - on the other hand she would perhaps have been content with some attention from her husband and a child. So it is like a combination of circumstances that make Charu so emotionally dependent on Amal that it eventually destroys her as a person and irrevocably damages her relationship with her husband. I think the tale is really timeless even if women today have more freedom than Charu could ever imagine. The heart betrays us in the same way no matter what times we live in.",1031097600,3,922,4.593939393939394
920882,5,6304587384,"Supposedly inspired by Rabindranath Tagore's real life ""friendship"" with Kadambari Devi, his brother's wife, this is Satyajit Ray's best work . Whatever be the inspiration for the story, there can be no doubt that this is the closest you can get to a perfect film.
Ultimately its a story of trust, betrayal and loneliness set in the 19th century. The characters consist of Bhupati-- a crusty feudal lord, with liberal views and a fascination with England and all things English.  He is distant,aloof and preoccupied with british politics and running his newspaper which like him,  is dry and unpopular. But he loves his wife dearly though has trouble expressing his love. Charulata, his wife, is imaginative, young and lonely in a loving through unexpressive marriage. And in the midst of this life comes the Bohemian brother of Bhupati- Amol, a budding author of doubtful literary credentials who comes in like a storm and catches Charulata's imagination and heart. Also coming into the mix is Charulata's evil brother who is out to embezzle Bhupati's money. What follows is a story of how love brings out the best in people, how trust and betrayal walk hand in hand, and of relationships broken and hearts that never heal.
 Satyajit Ray is in his elements as one unforgettable scene melts into another-- leaving behind  words not spoken, looks of smouldering passion not exchanged and tears that well up in the eyes and yet vanish with a smile....
A masterpiece...a Picasso on film
What more can one say.....",1016064000,30,1510,4.956521739130435
920883,5,6304587384,"Did Amol really fall in love with Charulata, his brother's wife? I do not think so, though I wouldn't debate on that, especially without having read the story (""NoshtoNir"" - by Rabindranath Tagore, written originally in Bengali) on which the film is based. And a film, as a medium of expression, just like literature, can be subjected to varied interpretations. That is never its source of greatness; and I'm definitely not the first one to realise that 'Charulata', as a film, is one such creation.  So what is it that makes it stand apart?
A film is like art in motion, a dynamic canvas trying to create impressions in your mind through the images and sounds that it presents frame-by-frame. And this film accomplishes that task to a superlative degree; right from the start where, over a few scenes, lucid camerawork and adroit focus capture Charu's boredom and solitude with alacrity. Near-flawless compositions with occasional sprinkling of eloquent imagery, dominate the whole film.  Some of the most moving images are:  1) A singing Charulata going up and down on a swing, her feet intermittently touching the ground while a contemplative Amol lies at some distance on the ground. The camera covers this shot both from the front when we see only Charulata and also from the side when Amol dominates the frame with Charulata swinging in the background. It produces a dreamlike effect. This is the strongest metaphor of Charulata's yearning for Amol.
2) Charulata's recollection of her childhood which inspires her to write - a brilliant montage of diverse scenes, such as a river, dancing men, a village fair and fire crackers, juxtaposed over a big close up of her face.
3) The final freeze shot, symbolising the indelible fracture in Bhupati and Charulata's marriage.
Music plays a significant role and qualifies most of the scenes. Acting perhaps ceases to be of supreme importance in such a masterful work but the very fact of the film's quality is testimony to good acting, though Amol (Soumitra Chatterjee) appears slightly theatrical in a few scenes and Bhupati's mannerisms a little arcane in the context of contemporary Bengali civility (which is perhaps irrelevant).
Ray himself has talked of 'Charulata' as his most consummate work, and we can understand why. Here he successfully blends picture and music, with his usual fluent style of narration, to create a deft composition, which is both adroit and expressive - adroit in its adaptation of technique and expressive as a work of art.",996364800,13,2504,5.014423076923077
920884,5,6304587384,"One of the finest filmmakers ever, Ray never disappoints and Charulata is one of his best.
A husband who loves his wife, but as in one scene where he strolls past her twice while reading his paper, he literally 'overlooks' her and her very fine qualities.  A man whose interests take precedence over his duties and responsibilities, he asks a relation to spend time with is bored and lonely wife.
He asks another relation to oversee his newspaper's business affairs so he can have more time for doing what he prefers doing, writing for the paper and sharing it with like minded friends.
Not wanting to give the story away, I'll just say that like all of Ray's films this one is perfectly told through more than just narrative, but also in the use of his superb cinematography and his sensitive portrayal of the people involved.
Just as he discovers the real worth of his wife, the husband learns that the consequences of letting others care for what he loves best, are costlier than he had imagined.",983491200,2,999,4.6440677966101696

In such a time, Charulata, falls in love  with her husband's young cousin, Amal. And along with it comes the eternal  struggle, the question, right or wrong. Ray's perspective differs from  Tolstoy's heroine Anna  who sacrifices her family and husband to pursue her  love. Ray has portrayed brilliantly the inner struggles that Amal and  Charulata go through and how they eventually cope with it. Its a story not  only of love and passion but also of duty and selflessness. The acting is  superb and flawless. The songs, one in which Charulata hums softly while  swinging on the swing and the other where Amal plays on the piano, with  Charu listening are beautiful. The surroundings of the movie are peaceful  and quiet. Amal says at one point, that life is like the waves of an ocean,  and that indeed is the essence of the movie.

7876802,5,6304587384,"Satyajit Roy (Ray) is an acknowledged master of the media. His reputation rests on the Apu Trilogy: no one can dispute their earthiness and the sheer brilliance of the direction, photography, music and acting. Roy actually shot a movie a year. After the critical success , alas, which did not translate into commercial one, he made movies with small budget and a small following and backing from the same producer (until the much later movies).
He made Parashpathar (The Touchstone): a less than funny adaptation of a good satire; and Jalsaghar (The Music Room), a very successful film of a heartwarming short story. His penchant for expanding short stories into movie length never stopped. Charulata is one of the exceptions of the early days where he actually chose a novel by Rabindranath Thakur (Tagore), but it was not like a full length tome the way big writers do. He always preferred a smaller, manageable canvas, very likely because of financial constraints.
Charulata turned out to be a heartwarming, lyrical love story: no, not the Romeo/Juliet kind, just subdued, not expressed (unlike The Home and the Road-which is nothing but a reworking of Charulata: by the same author called Ghare Baire). The big difference here is the heroine; he abandoned the waif like young Sharmila Tagore for the mature, fully realized actress: Madhabi Mukherji. And it made a tremendous difference. The acting by her and his usual hero: Saumitra Chatterji is of  high order: restrained, expressive and brimming with hidden sexuality: expressed so well in the one song: may be the only time he used a full one in his movies: 'Chini go chini tomarey, ogo bideshini'): I know you, stranger. (not a literal translation). It is the unspoken attraction between a lonely wife for her ebullient brother in law. A note here about the song; sung by Kishore Kumar, who was residing in Bombay and Roy did not have the money to get him to Calcutta where he was filming. The direction was done by telephone and the song when recorded was mailed on a cassette!
Sadly, Satyajit Roy, though he directed quite a few movies with international critical acclaim, never reached or realized his early glory and craft. Like all intellectuals of his era, he went the left wing path and his films resound with political waves. He also became obsessed with filming his own stories of detective Feluda, which like the stories were popular but of little cinematic importance.
Charulata, the book was actually called 'Nasta Neer' -Broken Home, showed a romantic Satyajit in a genius movie which was never duplicated.
It is a worth seeing movie for any one: even without any knowledge of Bengali life and culture of yore.",1500681600,,2682,4.920529801324503

As a woman, Charulata is confined to her luxurious house by custom; she cannot wander on the street unaccompanied, and in the film she never leaves the house. Ray plots out the parameters of the house in the opening minutes, as she looks out of windows from different rooms in the house onto the activities of the street.
