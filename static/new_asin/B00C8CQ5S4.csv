5700582,3,B00C8CQ5S4,"Lukas (Marius Jampolskis) becomes part of an altered state experiment by synchronizing his brain waves with a woman in a coma (Jurga Jutaite). They meet and live in a surreal dream world that is slightly bizarre and is sexual. Lukas becomes attached to the girl and has difficulty readjusting to the real world.

This is an indie art film. I found the subject matter interesting, but not always entertaining. 3 1/2 stars

5700583,5,B00C8CQ5S4,"Can we communicate with the dead? Perhaps since famous magician Houdini's death - probably the most famous case -, that is a question that has been craving for an answer, and not a good one, as far as I know, has been provided. Perhaps we can be more successful trying to establish contact with semi-death persons (comatose, that is). That is precisely the story behind the captivating, intriguing, and at times erotic (depending on what arouses you) ""Vanishing Waves.""

Lukas (Marius Jamploskis) is a young researcher who lives a steady and apparent tranquil life with his girlfriend. However, their calm days would be end soon, as Lukas volunteers to an experiment in the laboratory where he works. The senior scientists are trying to connect the minds - for a lack of a better word - of a normal, healthy person (Lukas), with that of a comatose one. In this case, they chose Aurora (Jurga Jutaite), a young, beautiful lady, who is in a comatose state. The experiment goes well, and Lukas gets some kind of connection with Aurora, as he is able to go into her thoughts. Despite the success, Lukas is not honest with the researchers, because he lies to them about the results, telling them that he wasn't getting any connection at all. As it happens, the communication gets improving, to the point of reaching erotic encounters (plenty nudity, of course). As expected, Lukas gets more motivated, to the point of obsession, and his involvement cause unexpected results.

""Vanishing Waves"" is original and heavy. It is a story of obsession told with intelligence, with great cinematography by Feliksas Abrukauskas, and able direction by Kristina Buozyte. The movie won awards at Fantastic Fest and other European film competitions. The 2-disc set includes a 12- page booklet with an interview with the director, a making-of feature, original motion picture soundtrack, and more.

8578741,5,B00C8CQ5S4,"Wow, what a beautiful movie that was!
At the beginning I was kind of not knowing what to expect. It was kind of slow ride and because of the art work in the dvd case, I still expected something so I waited.
The main actor volunteered to this experiment about himself being in some kind of dream like state. There is another woman who is in a comma. She has been this since she had a car accident and has not been able to wake up.
The main charactor meets her in this dream like state and fell in love with her.
Seems familiar? Well you haven't seen nothing like this before. I am sure about this.
The dream like state part is so so beautiful that I was almost felt like I am in some kind of heaven.
There are some nudity of both charators and having sex and all but that has nothing to do with sexuality. Believe me. This movie company tried to appealed to the audiences by using the sexuality but that is so so wrong.
There will be no one who will be aroused by those scenes. They are just so beautiful and even holly.
I recently saw the movie <UNDER THE SKIN> and really dissapointed so whenever I am about the see a movie that is about to try new things, I try not to expect too much.
But this one really made me so happy.
It really fulfulled my appetite.
Just make sure that this movie is not an American movie and it was made in Lithuania. You should read the subtitle and it really runs quite fast.",1453939200,,1404,4.109090909090909

8578743,5,B00C8CQ5S4,"Start with three stars, and deduct one or two if you sometimes or often complain a movie is ""slow."" (By the standards of foreign arthouse flicks, this isn't all that slow, so if you had no problem with The Tree of Life, you're golden. If, OTOH, you're down to one star, you may well want to skip this regardless of the following.)

Add a star if you like challenging sci-fi movies like Donnie Darko, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Prestige, and Primer. This one is actually easy to parse, provided you think along with it by asking yourself what might be possible in the film's sci-fi experiment (receiving information, via a wired connection, from a *comatose* patient), and then look for clues that confirm your suspicions. (See the end of the review for more.)

Add a star if you empathize with problematical characters and tend to cut them some slack if they behave badly, e.g., by sensing that were damaged by something in their past. In this case, our hero does not behave admirably, but it's ultimately clear that partaking in the experiment itself is damaging him, and making him increasingly obsessive. To the movie's credit, this is not telegraphed in the least.

IOW, this is a rare example of what might be called ""Arthouse Sci-Fi."" While not in a class with 2001: A Space Odyssey or Upstream Color, it's nevertheless terrific. The production design, cinematography and soundtrack are all stunning, the performances are excellent, and the story, while relatively thin compared to the aforementioned, is thought-provoking and moving.

Note that the trailer, near the end, gives away a key plot point, so you shouldn't watch more than half of it.

SPOILERISH TIP: Lukas has been connected to a woman who is in a coma and hence has no active brain function. What kind of information might such a person be sending him? Information that *already existed* in her brain ...",1420156800,,1891,4.842105263157895

8578746,1,B00C8CQ5S4,"The slowest yet of these Russian type Sci-Fi films.  Starting out the visuals are intriguing,  Beautiful and highly erotic, they quickly descend into things like a woman cutting her tongue with a knife for an erotic kiss and then a good deal of vomiting while having sex...at this point I decided I'd had enough.  My wife and i pronounced it unwatchable and put something else in the DVD player.  I guess this is just too damn Avant Garde for me,.. I found it disgusting.",1419206400,,471,4.571428571428571
8578747,2,B00C8CQ5S4,"I love watching exotic science fiction movies, and I had been led to believe that this Lithuanian movie was very interesting. According to various reviews, it is apparently interesting to some, but to me it was difficult to sit through. Very slow and very dull, hardly anything happens in its (waaay too long) 115 minutes. For a sci-fi movie, it has almost nothing to do with science. The main character had no depth; he was basically just a liar and a cheat. Immediately, he lies about the experiment he is in, and for far too long the other scientists stupidly don't suspect that anything is wrong. His friend points out the lack of plot logic, yet helps him commit further unethical and unscientific acts. Jeez.

The actual plot is about a comatose girl who unwittingly participates in an experiment to connect her mind with this research scientist (Lukas, the main character). Even though overt interpersonal connection is supposed to abort the experiment, it continues, with Lukas and the girl getting involved in various ways; sort of fall in love. The girl turns out to have been in a car accident, and also has issues with some past lover or husband. To be honest, it was all very, very boring to me, and moved extremely slowly. Sure, there were a few nice scenes here and there, but nothing to make up for the lack of proper plot, science, characterization, etc.

I will recommend this movie to no one who enjoys substance and a bit of action, because none of that is in this movie. You want to scream at it: ""Can something please HAPPEN?!"" The ending, too, is unsatisfying and anti-climactic.

I think people who are *not* sci-fi fans will probably enjoy it more than people who are. Sci-fi fans can safely skip this one.",1404691200,2,1731,4.6875
8578748,3,B00C8CQ5S4,"This movie reminded me of THE CELL, which justified its mental telepathy more thoroughly, relied in the same way on good, sexy photography, and yet got worse reviews -- though, admittedly, quite a few more of them. Much as many people disliked it, it got a wider audience than VANISHING WAVES will, so perhaps we should be charitable to this insistently beautiful movie.

In THE CELL, it was carefully explained that the mind of a mortally ill serial killer had to be entered in order to find the location of his latest victim. In VANISHING WAVES, the set-up is similar -- it is necessary for the hero to enter the comatose heroine's mind -- but only the vaguest account of why he should do so is given. He is a scientist, and his fellow-scientists are in some way researching how the brain works through this telepathic intrusion of theirs. Why it's important they bother a comatose patient so invasively is never explained. What they hope to find out is never explained.

Just as well, because when the hero enters the heroine's mind, the two fall rapidly in love and make love in various brilliantly modern artistic settings. The hero, whose fellow-scientists rely on him to tell them what he does when he enters the heroine's brain, lies to them at once, doesn't tell them he has encountered a woman and had sex with her, and in fact makes up stories about what's really going on.

So much for the important experiment. Of course, since we don't know what's important about the experiment in the first place, we don't much care if the hero messes it all up. But once we accept that the experiment itself doesn't matter, we are left with various incidents in a totally dreamlike love and sex story. To tell any more would be to spoil the ending, but I must warn potential viewers that the ending is preceded by a very long middle section in which everything that happens is dreamlike.

If that's not enough for the dream-lovers in the audience, there are one or two scenes that MAY occur in the dreamland the two lovers share, or may not. So is reality itself sometimes a dream? Be quite confident: not only will I not spoil the plot, but the plot itself will not spoil the plot. You will never know how much of the hero's life is a dream, or how much of the heroine's dream-life is based on reality.

Perhaps you will come up with other questions. If you do, I'd say the odds are five to one the movie will not answer those questions either.

In one sequence, the naked hero chases the naked heroine over a dreamlike shoreline for something like ninety seconds. The sequence is as good as a life-study class on the difference between male and female gluteal muscles in motion. But ... exactly how good is that? There's one more question this beautiful and deeply puzzling movie will not answer. Only its beauty is beyond all doubt. That may well be enough for its more patient viewers.",1388966400,3,2889,4.5675675675675675
8578749,5,B00C8CQ5S4,I promise you that you've never seen anything quite like this Lithuanian movie about an experiment that links the mind of a researcher and that of a comatose young woman. It is beautiful and sexy and disturbing and scary.,1382313600,2,221,4.6923076923076925
