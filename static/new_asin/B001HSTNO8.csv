8309512,5,B001HSTNO8,Classic and hard to find on vhs.,1476316800,,32,3.7142857142857144
8309513,1,B001HSTNO8,"i watched this 'film' not knowing what to 'expect'...

it turned out to 'be' a ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW ripoff without that films 'fictional' premise

unfortunately all the characters 'were' all to real

it's set in a secluded old home that looks like the PSYCHO house ripoff where a group of 'travellers' of every different per(suasion)version go to

they all go into some 'weirdo' room where they are 'voyeured' by the 'hostess' as they did 'far-out' things with themselves

it all goes even 'stranger' from there

the house is somehow surrounded by elephants, lions and a murdering, rapist gorilla.

'unfortunately' no one reveals themselves to be a transsexual alien from transalvania or does ROCKY even make an appearance

PS: as for the constant/irritating piano - well, it is almost as annoying as the one throughout EYES WIDE SHUT

REALLY REMARKABLE",1470441600,,858,5.071428571428571
8309514,3,B001HSTNO8,"Striated with scratches, muffled dialogue track, this disc is a decided letdown especially at the price. My old VHS copy is far superior. Still, if this is all we currently have to choose from, I suppose we should be grateful to those fine folk at DaaVeeDee for stocking it. It is jubilantly pornographic, and has a lot more to say about maverick seventies filmmaking than those alleged masterpieces by the likes of Coppola, Altman, Friedkin, and Scorcese. As a document of the talents of such late greats as McDowell, Kuchar, and the irreplaceable Marion Eaton, it is invaluable. It does deserve a better print, though, and we should be able to get rid of the Dutch subtitles. Here's to long, happy lives for ""Thundercrack""'s fearless (and great-looking) cast. An inevitable melancholy follows their every overripe phrase and sweetly raunchy move.  hfs",1398384000,3,853,5.049645390070922
8309515,5,B001HSTNO8,"...This is what the end result would probably look like. Filmed in glorious black-and-white and possessing a weird dreamlike atmosphere and long-winded soliloquies mixed with full-on graphic intercourse, ""Thundercrack"" is like nothing you've seen before. It takes the old horror film cliche of disparate travellers becoming stranded in a mysterious old house and not only turns it on its' ear--it knocks it on its' a** and penetrates with everything it's got!! Horny gorillas, pickled bodyparts, blow-up dolls, ""Thundercrack"" will blow your mind!!

The copies being sold here are bootlegs and the quality is what you'd expect from 2nd or 3rd generation VHS dubs. Synapse Films has reportedly been working on a fully-restored, 180-minute director's cut for some time, but it's taking forever since (as one of their reps told me) ""this thing looks like it was shot on toilet paper"". Perhaps we'll see a 40th Anniversary edition in 2015. I, for one can't wait!!",1382486400,4,958,5.220779220779221
8309516,3,B001HSTNO8,"wow, I'm glad they invented the internet... because if this is how people in the 1970's spent a rainy night... wow. don't be surprised to see a lot of nudity and sex toys... this film is choc-full of the both.  very good script, to say the least... and the acting isn't bad at times. I enjoyed the movie for the most part",1380240000,,321,4.17741935483871
8309517,5,B001HSTNO8,This movie is a Classic. One of a kind that will never ever be shown on television in anyway shape or form. To me its the perfect film that has to be watched and experienced for its great dialogue and A Grade B Grade acting. Marion Eaton is a legend !!  The whole gothic style and grainy film just add to the whole experience. Its like John Waters dropped acid and so did the actors and this is the result. Its worth it sooo much . Enjoy it and share it.,1352246400,6,454,3.989010989010989
8309518,5,B001HSTNO8,"Los Angeles Filmex --back in the '70s --I'm standing in line, in the dark on the westside of town, waiting to get into a midnight screening of something called, 'Thundercrack!'  I'm with my best bud from work who has convinced me, 'You GOTTA SEE this THING!'  I had no idea what to expect.  What I got was indescribable Laugh-Out-Loud SILLY FUN!  The amazing George Kuchar screenplay was Ridiculous Nonstop Hilarious MELODRAMA, very arch and played seriously, as if it were a matter of life or death!  A rundown of events in the film would do it an injustice --It was a TRUE Movie Experience!  The entire production has the look and feel of an inspired student film, by very talented Amateurs, but these guys are very sharp Artists.  There are several 'effects' shots that are very simply done, but stylistically perfect, and the acting is fittingly over-the-top, considering the material --imagine an old Dorothy McGuire/Rock Hudson potboiler whipped to a Hysterical FRENZY!  The porn is pretty decent, too.  Overlong?  Could it be they were having so much fun making the thing, that it was just hard for them to stop?
For those with a taste for BUG-NUTS GREAT, WHAT-THE-HELL IS THIS?, put it on your bucket-list, cause you GOTTA SEE this THING!",1304899200,19,1246,4.834905660377358
8309519,1,B001HSTNO8,"I will keep this short. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,TIME, OR BRAINCELLS. The most senseless film ever created",1239667200,4,105,4.888888888888889
8309520,5,B001HSTNO8,"There's been a website touting a US DVD release of this for a while now, nothing yet it seems.  This is one of those films that shouldn't exist.  A completely aburdist, hardcore xxx cult behemoth!  It runs over two hours and is filled with some of the silliest moments in film history.  I don't own this DVD, but believe me, you need to see it.",1235433600,19,344,4.246153846153846
