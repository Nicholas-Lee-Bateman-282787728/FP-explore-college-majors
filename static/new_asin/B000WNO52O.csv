8224384,1,B000WNO52O,"Not A good DVD. Very basic explanations, mostly verbal; While Mr. Gartin seems to have a background in martial arts, he talks an awful lot, but fails to explain fundamental principles. There are very few techniques shown, none of which are too impressive or usefull in real life situations (certainly not against a trained person). No real speed footage, no focus on knife techniques, vital points etc. Too much talk and certainly not enough practice makes this DVD superficial and inefficient as a learning aid. I'm sure Silat has much more in it than what this DVD shows.  wouldn't buy it again nor do I recommend anyone else to buy it. YouTube has much more to offer and it's completely free. This was on my wishlist for ages,and finally I made the mistake of buying it. Not a smart idea, as there are lots o better items on amazon for the 20$ I spent on this ridiculous crap. I Am very disappointed. won't ever watch it again. I gaveit 1 star only because I couldn't post this review with ZERO stars.",1505088000,,1004,4.54696132596685
8224385,1,B000WNO52O,"who does the guy think he is fooling / he shows his, obvious lack of knife fighting skills by running his mouth most of the dvd.not showing fundamentals but jumping methods that are not practical for todays streets he glosses over proper stances ,grips foot work nomenclature e.c.t the principles of the are not fully explained only a few moves . the person demonstrating with him had unlimited opportunities to counter any of the silly moves this guy calls silat knife fighting.this dvd is not worth the plastic it is made from and is only one of a multitude of reasons silat has not spread in the u.s the it should. anyone serious about learning silat or kuntao knife would to stay clear of anything to with this man or his dvds .at the end of the dvd he gives thanks to his lord and savior jesus, it is good he believes in jesus because jesus is the only person who can save him if he ever tries to use that garbage against a determined attacker on the streets.",1413676800,2,964,4.391061452513966
8224386,3,B000WNO52O,"I have watched it once and found it interesting, but no techniques that I plan to practice or study.
It seems like it would take a while to master the fluid movements and techniques presented. I would not want to fight against a Silat master.",1360886400,,242,4.4
