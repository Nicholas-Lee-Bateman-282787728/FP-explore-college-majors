7963751,5,B0000687CB,"Night Fright is the third best in the movie,What Scared Sue Ellen and The Fright Stuff are both great,especially when in the Fright Stuff,Arthur,Buster,Muffy,Francine,Binky,and the Brain preparing practical jokes! The Fright Stuff teachs how practical jokes can come back to haunt you,Night Fright shows that even the most embarrasing thing,can be very normal. What Scared Sue Ellen shows how even the scariest thing may scare you,but it may be just a dog howling. Overall,a very great movie. I would recommend it.",976579200,4,514,5.3580246913580245
