8166490,4,B000M4RG38,I thought this had interviews that span thier career. It is a bunch of interviews from Death Manetic Era and newer. It only had one old one from 1984. That was only7 minutes long.  All in all it is still a cool dvd to have in your collection.,1375747200,,242,4.041666666666667
8166491,3,B000M4RG38,"This DVD is a compilation of somewhat rare interviews. Don't expect concert footage here. That's not what detracts the rating for me, but it's the watermark. Why put a giant watermark in the video. And why a damn squirrel on a skateboard! Not worth the purchase. I downloaded this once and immediately deleted it due to the stupid watermark. I inferred that someone had ripped the DVD and then defaced it with an idiotic watermark but no, it's on the DVD. Get netflix and watch it on there, pass on the DVD.",1306800000,,507,4.521739130434782
8166492,1,B000M4RG38,This is Phantom Garbage! It is basically some Australian put together bootleg with unseen interviews from Germany and Australia and some interviews all thrown in like a compilation.,1283126400,3,181,5.5
