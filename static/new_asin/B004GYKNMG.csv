4374355,1,B004GYKNMG,Worst DVD I have ever bought. A total waste of money and time. Sorry but the Truth Hurts.  Donnie Blue,1373328000,2,102,4.1
4374356,1,B004GYKNMG,Do not buy this is the worst thing I have ever seen Kid Rock has nothing to do with this.,1359849600,2,89,3.5
4374357,1,B004GYKNMG,"I purchased it for a female friends birthday present! Needless to day it wasn't what I thought it would be! She wanted a Live performance of ""Kid Rock"". Instead she received a video of flashing tities & A MUSIC CD with unrecognizable songs. Now its sitting on MY bureau collecting dust.",1333324800,5,286,4.627450980392157
4374358,1,B004GYKNMG,"DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM. I received this as a gift from a friend! This was awful. The video stunk...a bunch of people talking about Kid Rock, but, Kid was not in the video. This was the worse thing that I have ever seen. After 5 minutes, I was ready to shut it off. The CD, at best, was just tolerable. Definitely, not a product of Kid Rocks! This is an UNAUTHORIZED product. Kid would never put his name on something like this. Again, do not spend your money!!",1325721600,5,474,4.163043478260869
4374359,1,B004GYKNMG,"this waste of money has no Kid Rock music or videos.
just some people who 'say' they know him and talk about him.

 DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY LIKE I DID",1303776000,17,149,3.933333333333333
4374360,1,B004GYKNMG,This DVD is a piece of sh..!! No wonder it's an UNauthorized biography!! I can't see Kid Rock putting his endorsement on this piece of garbage.,1303776000,5,143,4.538461538461538
4374361,1,B004GYKNMG,"This was the biggest WASTE of money ever!!!!! This should have been called ""KID ROCK THE INCOMPLETE STORY"". I should have known that if this was not being sold at regular stores or on Kid's site that this was an unauthorized piece of junk. I made it through an agonizing 15 minutes before taking it out and throwing it in the garbage. I wouldnt even give this away. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. All KID fans need to wait until he decides to release a REAL DVD.",1301356800,28,456,4.252873563218391
4374362,1,B004GYKNMG,This video is made by people and kid rock has nothing to do with any of it. It is just a bunch of people telling corny stories about kid rock. Worst thing I have ever watched and I am a huge kid rock fan. ZERO stars!!!!!,1300838400,43,220,3.8043478260869565
8429077,2,B004GYKNMG,"This dvd seems like people who claim to ""know"" Kid Rock filmed conversations with each other, very amateurish and poorly produced. The only worthwhile things are the songs Kid Rock sang. They were excellent.  I am a huge fan of his, and I wish there were more songs instead of pointless chit-chatting.",1520899200,,301,4.788461538461538
8429078,1,B004GYKNMG,"Dont even deserve a star....
Was the worse purchase I have ever made ... cant believe amazon will have this for sale..",1517184000,,118,4.409090909090909
8429079,1,B004GYKNMG,Not a good investment to say the least. It was very disappointing. I am just being honest.,1454630400,,90,4.352941176470588

8429086,1,B004GYKNMG,"Why if I bought a Brand New Copy of this did I not recieve the whole package. Poster? Booklet? Wasn't there but on the Gift box it claims they are included. I am a huge Kid Rock fan, the video itself sux. This is a scam to get money for a cheap video (Not Authorized by Kid Rock or Management) and if you can't be honest you need to take this back with the money I paid, or at least take it off Amazon.",1379635200,3,402,3.7976190476190474
