1946156,5,B0000TWMNY,"I have been a ballet lover since childhood and seen many performances of Romeo and Juliet.  This is far and away the best due to the very fine production at La Scala.  Superb dancing by all but in particular to the outstanding performances of Corella and Ferri.  I have never seen finer interpretations of these roles - Corella captures the youthful spontaneity and the manly qualities of Romeo. He sees deeply into the soul of this young man to portray his true nobility, and the depth of his love for Juliet.

I first saw Alessandra Ferri dance with the Royal Ballet in 1982 and was very impressed with her quality as a dancer.  She like Corella has deep insight into the character of Juliet, and is able to capture her youthful playfulness, and also her transformation into a woman through her love for Romeo.  She portrays this love with every fibre of her being.  I have never seen a dancer able to convey emotion as clearly as Ferri.  She is truly a dancer who can interpret a dramatic role better than anyone else I have ever seen.

 I would like to add that I have seen all the great dancers of the Royal Ballet from the end of World War 2!

There has never been a performance of Romeo and Juliet to equal this.",1104278400,19,1219,4.397321428571429
1946157,5,B0000TWMNY,"I'm not going to go through a long description about a ballet that can only be described as SUBLIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you have a chance to buy this DVD I would STRONGLY recommend it. The ballet was preformed with perfection. I could feel the dance and emotion from Corella and Ferri. Perfect for any great ballet collector. All my best, Christina:)",1091664000,13,349,4.816666666666666
8002931,5,B0000TWMNY,"Overall, this is a lavish staging that almost religiously respects what Prokofiev wrote (yes, MacMillan, like others, moves the Morning Dance from Act III to Act I, but aside from that I think it's a fine realization of the score).  What knocked me out of my seat in this film was Angel Corella and Alessandra Ferri as the young lovers.  They look beautiful, dance beautifully, and look madly in love with love as well as with each other.  The balcony scene at the end of Act I is BREATHTAKING.",1513641600,,494,4.52808988764045
8002932,5,B0000TWMNY,"With the exception of the French horns, the entire section of which should have been put up against a wall and shot, this is a glorious piece.  The score for this ballet is one of the chief reasons that Prokofiev is one of my all-time favorite composers.  REALLY a shame about the horns, as the rest of the orchestra was fabulous.  Ms. Ferri (whom I believe was about 38 at the time this was made) really has the magic to make us believe she is a very young lady.  And Mr. Corella is fabulous as Romeo, who has that magical mixture of dashing man and bumbling boy.  And that's just the acting.  Of course, they are among the greatest dancers of their generation to boot.  And if they can't make you weep at the end, then you really shouldn't be watching (or reading) Shakespeare, just stick with DIY videos.",1449187200,,807,4.375838926174497

8002934,5,B0000TWMNY,"A favorite ballet score is roughly treated. Running time is approximately 20 minutes short. Several tempi are too fast, especially in the interludes and pantomime scenes.  Cuts are crude, leaving passages sounding thin and incomplete. However, the two principals are magnificent.

Some DVDs of this performance in this version for Region 1 (U.S. and Canada) are selling for around $300.  However, if you purchase this all region player (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004BI6MVS/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00) for about $55 you can play a $15 PAL DVD version (http://www.amazon.com/Prokofiev-Russian-Subtitle-Chinese-Alessandra/dp/7799917946/ref=cm_cr-mr-title) and other discs from multiple regions.",1356393600,,699,7.011494252873563
8002935,5,B0000TWMNY,"I'm only submitting this ""review"" in hopes of raising the overall rating a bit.  Many reviewers before me have praised this production; I doubt that I could add anything more.  Just about everything works.  I could quibble about minor points and parts here and there; but, overall, this is indeed a magical performance and we should light multiple candles in thanksgiving that it was preserved.  In the end, everything comes down to the two leads; and these two are uncommonly superb.  There are many, many great dancers with respect to technique; there are all too few who can identify and ""live"" their parts as Corella and Ferri do here.  This is the highest art.  Buy this DVD for them.  I cannot, cannot believe you will be sorry.",1266451200,5,734,4.724409448818897
8002936,5,B0000TWMNY,"I have watched this ballet at least a dozen times. Corella and Ferri are spectacular of course. The music is mesmerizing. Ferri does seem to have lost a little of her edge since her pairing with Eagle years ago, but she is still wonderful and the best Juliet that I've ever seen. Who can say anything bad about Corella? He did seem to struggle a little with one part where he lifted her over his shoulders, but still, GREAT. Anyone wanting to see a truly great version of Romeo and Juliet should have this in their collection.",1178496000,4,526,4.43298969072165
8002937,5,B0000TWMNY,"As a musician and serious fan of all things Prokofiev, I was familiar with the music long before the dancing.  To see the MacMillan choreography, with the la Scala company, and Corella and Ferri, AND this glorious music makes for an artistic event beyond compare!  The acting is wonderful.  Corella and Ferri will rip your heart out, aided by the score, of course.  The swordplay is thrilling and sooooo fast.  The balcony and bedroom scenes are almost unbearably lovely--and will make you remember your youth.  And the death scene:  well, see if you don't feel a howl rising up from within your ribcage just like Juliet when she discovers Romeo's body.  Every. time. you. watch. it.  You can't ask more of art than that!",1145059200,6,721,4.75
8002938,5,B0000TWMNY,"WOW!  This DVD of La Scala's Romeo and Juliet (2000) is worth every cent.  I cannot stop watching it.  Though several of the lesser characters are without interest, that does not take away from me the sheer joy I receive when watching Angel Corella  and Alessandra Ferri... was there ever a better casting than this?  I think not!  Angel Corella, one of the best dancers the world has ever seen, plays his Romeo with just the right amount of boyish navety and innocence... after all, Romeo is a dreamer.  And Ms. Ferri never fails to impress me, her stunning line and beautiful feet are just amazing.  But what makes this R & J work for me is the high level of Ferri and Corella's acting abilities, which really come through at this performance.",1142208000,7,745,4.548872180451128
8002939,5,B0000TWMNY,"Hi..

This is an amazing ballet which includes great romantism and love, great emotion, great dance, great coreography and great music!

Ferri is a gifted ballerina...Her fragile appearance makes her the greatest juliet! With her strong techinuque, this fragile appearance seems more realistic. Her way of telling things with her body language is extremely enthusiastic and reliable.. The first dance with Paris(Act 1-15) shows her innocent happiness and excitement. Julliet is not experienced and Ferri shows that clearly. Then in the 3rd Act there is hopelessness, anxiety, again an ""innocent"" hate,and a desperate dance. This is the same dance but with  totaly different emotions. The way Ferri acts especially in these two dances is amazing!

And Corella!! First of all he is an amazing dancer with amazing acting ability.. There is this immature, childish side of Romeo which makes us see Angel Corella's ability to act..His way of holding Rosaline is innocent but passionate..The way he holds Julliet is as if he knew her, like she will never leave him and he trusts her with his deepest honesty and love! And he loves and respects her for the familiar feeling that burns his heart. Angel with his great technique, has both sides of Romeo's personality: innocence versus passion.

There are 4 parts of the ballet that SHOULD be watched. The first is the bedroom scene. They have this passionate connection between them. The love scene(22) is the perfection itself. The first combination makes me feel like there is the sun rising and their love is blessed with God's light!

The 2nd is the bedroom scene. Ferri does an arabesque then Corella pulls her and then she turns and hugs him with hope/hopelesness,passion/innocence,trust/fear..She asks God ""why"" with her hands and the desperate look on her face while both of their faces are brightened up...

The 3rd one is the one at Friar Laurence's. It is all about music and love...

And the 4th scene is the death of Juliet(51/52)...Corella performs exceptionally in these episodes...After the great scenes of love, hate, selfishness, and jealousy, this is the greatest end!

The coreography is based on music,innocence and emotions.. I watched it as a ballet and as a movie.. If more details are wanted Nureyev's coreography should be watched as well.

Lastly.. The music is just great! With the libretto, it is the perfection itself. The sarcastic tone of the music gives the clues to the end..And its importance lies in the irony during the most important parts of the ballet while the music is laughing and crying at the same time...

Every ballet lover should watch it!

(Note: Nureyev's coreography is just great with its details and extremely passionate scenes.. Manuel Legris(!) and Monique Loudieres's ballet is worth watching!)",1122768000,12,2792,5.098684210526316
8002940,3,B0000TWMNY,"This DVD features Prokofiev's  Romeo and Juliet performed at the La Scala in 2000. It has all the ingredients to make a superbly entertaining video with Alessandra Ferri and Angel Corella starring as the principal dancers. It also has great scenery,  fine costumes and better than average filming and editing.

However, to me, it has one glaring drawback, that being the music (not the way the music was played for this performance but rather the composition itself)...let me explain

To have great ballet, I associate thoughts of outstanding dancing and beautiful music that go together; things that compliment one another, things that seem to be made for and could simply not exist without the other. Such is not the case here (with the exception of the two pas de deux mentioned below).

To be honest, I'm not sure this music is meant for ballet. It's got a symphonic quality that is heavy and ponderous; it's just not ""pretty""!  For instance, in  Act I there is a lot of festive activities going on  featuring the corps de ballet: they are happy and smiling but its hard to understand why, with the decidedly cheerless music that they must dance to. Even the audience seemed to feel restrained during this entire presentation: their applause consistently subdued and short.

On the plus side there is Ferri and Corella!

Ferri seems to have blossomed into one of the better actress/ballerinas of our time; her facial expressions and body language compliment her gifted dancing abilities. She and Corella carry this performance from beginning to end; they have two outstanding Pas de deux during this ballet, that being the ""Balcony Scene"" at the end of Act I and then the ""Bedroom Scene"" starting Act III.  Other than these two magnificent dances, Sir Kenneth Macmillan (the choreographer) has done about as much as possible to ""fill in "" the rest of music with a ballet performance. Even under ideal circumstances it must be an arduous task  to try to choreograph dance to music that, dare I say, is a challenge to become enthusiast about; one can only compliment him in completing this difficult endeavour.

I guess it all boils down to whether you like Prokofiev's music (and obviously this is a purely personal, subjective opinion); nonetheless, I give this a 5 star presentation in all things but the music. If not for Ferri and Corella I probably would have given this disc a 1 or 2 star rating; in fact, if not for Ferri and Corella I'd have regretted buying this DVD at all. However, that being said, the two Pas de Deux ARE worth the price of this disc and the menu allows you the option to go directly to these scenes should you wish.",1104796800,8,2648,4.755458515283843
