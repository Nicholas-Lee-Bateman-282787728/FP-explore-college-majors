3907354,5,B002CWKTR8,Great series and great story. I love it. It has good ending I think. The character designs and artwork is great in my opinion. A android maid is so hot xD. A lot nude scenes of the girls woot. A super cute android girl and boy in one house.,1272412800,2,240,3.9183673469387754
3907355,5,B002CWKTR8,"Hello everyone today the review is about the complete collection of Mahoromatic. I won't give a summary since that's what wikipedia is for. This is basically a combination of both Mahoromatic collections plus the OVA packed into 5 discs in one box. Although the packaging inside has the discs packed one on top of the other, they don't scratch easily. This series is one of my favorite and there's no denying it's influence. I think this is a series well worth owning as it is one you will watch more than once. I recommend this for those seeking a romantic comedy as this delivers plenty of laughs!",1252368000,6,599,4.607476635514018
8364541,4,B002CWKTR8,"Good two seasons + one OVA.  Typical high school anime (except that it is supposed to take place in middle school) with out-of-character sad ending.  Gainax felt obligated to put some gratuitous fan service in every single episode for whatever reason but I still enjoyed it.  Interestingly enough, virtually every ""class trip"" taken by the students in this 2001 anime are repeated in the very recent ASSASSINATION CLASSROOM anime.",1476748800,,430,5.202898550724638

8364547,5,B002CWKTR8,"This is my number one favorite anime that has a good story. I actually cried at the end. It is funny, emotional, and also has plenty of fanservice. I loved Wendee Lee as the voice of the female teacher (I forget her name).",1409875200,,222,4.186046511627907

8364549,5,B002CWKTR8,"Mahoro is a retired combat android. She has a little over a year left in her operational life span. She decides to spend it helping people. She takes a job as a live in maid for a middle school boy named Suguru. She quickly works her way into his heart with her devotion and pure intentions. They become very close and overcome many challenges. A sexy teacher who has her eye on Suguru is always trying to split them up, an old enemy returns to settle the score with Mahoro, and Mahoro's impending fate weighs heavy on her heart. Despite these trials, their bond remains strong. Thye may be able to overcome any challenge together, but what will happen when her life span comes to an end?

This DVD set contains both seasons, and the summer OVA. There are Japanese and English audio tracks, and subtitles. My only complaint is that the DVD case has a spindle inside that is very strong. It is a little tough to get the discs over the lip of the spindle. All of the box sets may not be that way, but I think that if one is like that the others will be too. It's not that big of a deal though. At least it's strong and isn't going to break.

This is a great anime. It is very similar to Steel Angel Kurumi. It also has a bit of a Love Hina, and Girls Bravo mood about it. I personally like it better than Kurumi, and Love Hina. The animation is pretty good, there are lots of great characters. The voice acting, and soundtrack are also very decent. My favorite part about this show is the many different genres it spans. There is action, comedy, drama, and romance. This show has a very sweet love story going on, but there is also a lot of nudity and pervy stuff thrown in there. This show has everything. I can't believe that I just found out about it by accident. It's over 10 years old. I'm very glad I discovered Maharomatic. I think any mature anime fan can find something to love here.",1353196800,4,1890,4.26183844011142
8364550,5,B002CWKTR8,"If you can relate to seeing a show that is really impactful & becomes quite beloved to you, but can't quite explain why - that is Mahoromatic to me in a nutshell. Perhaps it was because I can relate to times of loneliness as a young person with our main character Suguru's loneliness. Perhaps it is because of the very intriguing sci-fi plot that is cleverly revealed a little at a time. Maybe it is because of the light to dark swings by using zany fan service comedy as contrast to make an eminent dark threat & thoughts of one's mortality being more emotionally powerful. Maybe it is the personal relaionship that develops between Suguru & Mahoro that is so touching. Maybe it is the classic tragedy aspects that make it so memorable.

No it is not one of those things - I think it is because all these elements are so cleverly crafted into one show, it has never left my thoughts after seeing this a few years ago. I can't say for others they will come away with what I did with on this show. I have seen some just dismiss it as a fan service show- hey no biggie if that's what someone else takes out of this. All I can say is it is one of those shows that hit me hard, and I can not quite explain why.",1331856000,6,1206,4.175965665236052
