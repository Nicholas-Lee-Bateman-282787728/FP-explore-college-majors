3794507,3,B001TWT0DQ,"Frankly, I was disappointed in this video.  Not much substance and not a lot of production value.  Just because something works for a golf pro who has been playing golf since childhood, doesn't mean it will work for most golfers.  For example, I suspect the ""hinge and hold"" is not great for most amateurs.  I think this severe hinging introduces a lot of error and most amateurs will be able to do it well.  No one advocates the severe hinge and Mickelson uses.  Most golfers who try this will wind up decelerating as the club head approaches the ball.  Just go the golf channel and watch instructional videos on chipping.  Brad Brewer, Tom Watson, Rich Beam, Annika Sorenstam hardly hinge and most advocate chipping with a putt-like swing with the club finishing low.  This technique will be a lot easier for 99% of golfers.  On a positive note, I did like the way he explained how to set up after opening up the face of the club.",1239753600,8,932,4.526946107784431
3794508,5,B001TWT0DQ,"I bought this to get my chipping technique straightened out. After watching it, and one session on the chipping green, it sure did! I have numerous books on golf, and not one of them mentions the hinge and hold approach to chipping! Why?! Phil says there is not one good chipper out there that does not use it. This DVD is a gem. I am DONE with the books. Thanks, Phil.",1239667200,,369,4.211267605633803
3794509,5,B001TWT0DQ,"This is a great DVD.  It's not filled with detail about grip and mechanics, its more about the approach to the short game, a couple of guiding principals and some drills.  If you take note of the key elements and make an effort to try them out and practice them, your short game will improve.

Watching Phil explain it the way he does is much better than reading articles in golf publications trying to provide 30 seconds worth of tips.",1239580800,7,436,4.425
3794510,5,B001TWT0DQ,"Excellent video. I have a good long game, but my short game is my weakness.  After viewing this video for the first time, I practiced his tchnigques and ""got it."" I felt 100% more confident in my chipping, bunker shots and short game.  Well worth the money.",1239494400,,257,4.446808510638298
3794511,5,B001TWT0DQ,This is the best golf DVD you can buy. It would be worth it at 10 times the cost. Phil is an outstanding instructor and can deliver his knowledge in a fascinating manner. Of couse he can make any shot look easy but he really explains the concept behind the shot.,1239321600,3,262,4.1568627450980395
3794512,5,B001TWT0DQ,"So I have just finished watching Phil's first video and he just makes the short game shorts all make sense. Of all the golf DVD's I have watched this one makes the most sense. Now as a disclaimer I am a PM fan, but I also love to play the short game shorts well when I am out playing. Phil has found a method that just simplifies everything in regards to the short game. His ideas for putting are very simple and as for his thoughts and teachings in chipping both short and long chips he teaches a method that works the same for both types of shot. There is nothing complicated about his methods and with practice we can use his methods to have more fun with our own short game. I highly recommend this video.",1239062400,29,709,4.182481751824818
3794513,4,B001TWT0DQ,This is more Phil's mindset and method than explicitly detailed instruction. I did get a lot out of it and feel it was well worth the cost.,1457136000,,139,4.185185185185185

3794524,4,B001TWT0DQ,"Phil Mickelson is perhaps the best short game player ever, as demonstrated by his mastery from 100 yards in, and this video definitely demonstrates how he does it. However, one must also consider the number of hours he has put in to perfect his craft. I was very excited to try his method out after watching the video. But I must say, I think it requires lots of hours of pitching and chipping to gain a reasonable level of consistency. And still, you have to wonder, if his method really is the best, wouldn't all the pros and advanced golfers be using it? One would think... and yet, I see very few pros or good golfers using his method. I just don't think it's as simple or easy as he makes it out to be.",1420588800,,707,4.2444444444444445

3794528,4,B001TWT0DQ,"I've always enjoyed watching Mickelson's instruction videos on YouTube. He's articulate and very energetic in his speech. In this DVD set, I found him to produce a bit of an attitude towards some of the traditional methods (clock technique taught by Pelz, and putting techniques). For a beginner, this DVD set will help provide a set of fundamental concepts with respect to chipping and putting - but consistent ball striking will still require practice! The video quality was acceptable back in the day, but now I've been spoiled by 720P/1080P HD and the Standard Definition DVD doesn't cut it!

Overall: 4/5 stars, good as a foundation for beginners/intermediate players but won't magically make you a better player. The hing and hold technique requires quite a bit of practice.",1414108800,,780,5.09375

3794542,5,B001TWT0DQ,"Don't buy it.

I just might be golfing with you sometime in the future and I would love to take all your money in a skins game.

For those who say that Phil unhinges his wrists when he chips and pitches, I think you missed a very important piece of the swing.

The wrists unhinge only very slightly after impact. This is due to the weight of the clubhead pulling the face forward. If you have a medium to light grip on the club your wrists will unhinge slightly when your arms stop.

Also the 50 yard shot technique is great if you hold the angle in your back wrist through impact. You can actually hit a 56 degree wedge low and with a lot of backspin to 80-90 yards with a short 9-3 swing. This technique will teach you the low stinger for shots under trees and into a strong headwind. Can be used for all clubs.

Putting part has a lot of different points not usually seen in most putting books. Very simple technique that can be learned quickly.",1395014400,,948,4.2154696132596685

Now, all I have to work on is my distances, swing distance and targeting.  All of these are explained by Phil to make it easy around the green both short distances and long, both launching the ball high or running across the green.  He also explains how to do a couple of his trick shots, that with some practice, will impress anyone.

I first read the one star reviews to see why people did not like it. They were all stupid. They either got a bad DVD or had delivery problems. Why would you gig a product for a reason that nothing to do with the product? Plus, Amazon is the best at fixing these type problems. If you are a single digit handicapper (or think you are), this video might not help you. I am a 12 handicap and absolutely loved the info Phil gives.

3794572,5,B001TWT0DQ,"This DVD Rocks, the putting drills and concepts alone are worth their weight in gold. In my humble opinion putting is the most overlooked, undeveloped part of the average golfer's game. Go to any course or driving range and you will fine very few golfers working on putting let alone short game. Atlas ""you drive for show and put for dough"" Just look at any major championship.  Almost any golfer can tell you that the majority of the game is played for 130 yards and within, but the ""Big Sick"" gets all the love? Not sure the motivation behind some of the negative comments? Yes the second DVD is mostly fluff but there is more than enough meat in disc 1, as far as the price it's less than what you'd pay for a lesson with far more detail and insight. Not to mention you can revisit the lessons with Phil whenever you like! (try to put a price tag on that!) The button line is Phil is arguably the greatest short game player of all time!

3794575,5,B001TWT0DQ,"How this DVD can get anything less than 5 stars is beyond me.  I've been watching this video for over a year, checking it out from our local library whenever I saw it on the shelf.  Unfortunately it is usually checked out, so finally I decided to buy it for my own collection so that I can watch it whenever I want.  I've played golf for 20+ years (high single digit handicapper) and have used different short game methods in the past.  Instructional books used in the past include those by Dave Pelz and Stan Utley.

Phil does a wonderful job describing his short game.  Surprisingly, most of his shotmaking comes from one basic swing method, with adjustments made for various conditions.  I think that this is beneficial for the amateur golfer, who should be able to implement Phil's method quickly.  Phil's communication is effective and very energetic.  I should add efficient as well, because the segments are concise and easy to follow.

I've recommended this DVD to many golfing buddies, and I do so here on Amazon as well.  This comes from a lifetime golfer and frequent viewer of this DVD.  I highly recommend it.",1370476800,4,1122,4.668367346938775

3794577,5,B001TWT0DQ,"I'm a 12 handicap as I write this review.  I'm not your typical 12 handicap, though.  Most players who are trying to get into the single digits need to shave strokes off of their short game in order to do so.  While I will freely admit that my short game should get better, it's not where I lose strokes.  My driver is the club I lose strokes with.  I'm the guy who takes 2-3 stroke and distance penalties off the tee per round.  I also struggle with the 70 yard approach, which is too short for a full swing and too long for a pitch shot.  Yeah, I'm prone to some horrible miscues around the greens.  I'll have those rounds where I just can't figure out the speed.  And I'll have those rounds where I just can't find my chipping stroke.  But all in all, I rarely leave strokes out on the course playing from 50 yards and in.  I attribute that to the fact that I have been putting into practice what I learned from Phil Mickelson from watching this video.

Granted, Phil doesn't bring anything new or revolutionary to the game of golf.  He simply does what all of the great golfers have been doing for decades.  He does, however, put it into a palatable form so that those of us who are new to the concept of how to accurately and consistently chip can understand it.  Different golfers call it different things, but Phil essentially breaks down the concept of hinge-and-hold and how we can apply it to various different golf shots from inside of 50 yards.

Whenever I run into a golfer who is looking for advice on how to properly chip, I direct them to this video.  I'm no teacher.  But Phil seems to be pretty good at it.  Even though I didn't like the section on putting very much, this video deserves five stars because it, with a whole lot of practice, has made me a pretty darn good chipper.",1367452800,,1798,4.2976190476190474

3794593,5,B001TWT0DQ,"Phil Mickelson's Secrets of the Short Game is a wonderful addition to any avid golfer who has been inspired by Mickelson's play throughout his career. The DVD is still a great landmark of information and swing ideas that will take players a great amount of time to practice his technique.

According to Mickelson, the reason he did the DVD is because there isn't enough instruction about the short game (putting, chipping, sand shots, pitch shots and even the dreaded flop shots) and there is an overabundance of reference on the full swing. He sticks true to that concept so if you're looking for any think full swing related this isn't the DVD for you. But if you are looking for a nice comprehensive view of shots around the green and putting tips, I don't believe there is a better player to learn from than Phil Mickelson.

I highly recommend this DVD to all the players looking for inspiration around the greens and some solid direction to getting your scores lower and having much more fun with the game.",1355270400,,1011,4.674157303370786

I was surprise at the lack of game improvement information on these two discs.  Before buying the discs I read numerous reviews.  Needless to say, I am more than disappointed in the product!

The one good point is the fact Phil has a lot of personality and very likable.  Unfortunately, that doesn't help my game any.  With the hinge and hold technique you will get the ball in the air but controlling the distance and speed is the problem. I would only use the technique if I want to lay up out of very very deep rough.",1316131200,,648,4.440677966101695
3794606,3,B001TWT0DQ,"I've been trying this technique of hinging the wrists in the backswing and holding that hinge through impact for about a year and half. I needed a good technique for hitting checking, biting chips and pitches from extra tight and hard lies around hard greens. Very easy to hit just about any chip or pitch from easy lies where the ball is sitting a bit up on grass.  I've been a 1-5 hcp for the last 20yrs. I've concluded that this is very difficult for me, because I cannot make the stroke automatic and must have swing thoughts to make consistent contact. For short, touchy shots where feel is very important to gauge distance, spin and break, filling my head with swing thoughts takes the feel out.  The main reason for my trouble is that if I use my wrists in the backswing, I automatically and naturally want to use it on the downswing. Phil does too, more than he says he does in the video.  Plus he drops down with his body to hit his stock chip. Watch his swing carefully and you can see subtle wrist release and body compression.

There's something missing from this dvd explanation. It's probably something that Phil automatically does without knowing it, but didn't realize that others won't do it instinctively. I think he needed to teach this to a few folks, go through the learning curve with them over a few months, then do his video. He'll definitely realize the missing element and hopefully come up with a great way to deal with it. There are a lot of excellent players out there who cannot become really good instructors, because they do not or cannot spend the hours, days, and weeks with students and go through the learning curve with them and discover how to explain the theories. Seasoned instructors, who spend their time teaching students one-on-one, know where students will have difficulties and have developed explanations or demonstrations to help them along.

Update: Read Stan Utley's Secrets of the Short Game book. In it he describes this chipping technique quite well, though I don't follow his pitch and sand techniques. But he does a great job explaining the missing info from Phil's dvd.",1315872000,,2125,4.701612903225806

It is easy to digest and I have found at least half a dozen pointers to use.  That is probably worth the price of the DVD itself.

3794612,5,B001TWT0DQ,"It is challenging to learn anything golf related from books and it is best to learn from a good instructor, but as far as learning from a DVD goes I don't think it could be much easier.

Phil shares his knowledge in a manner that is both educational and enjoyable to watch.

In the putting segment he clearly states why he does what he does and provides some really effective drills.

He also keeps the general putting principles as he moves into the short game so it is easy to transition from one to the other. The hinge and hold technique is very logical and can be learned with practice. Again he clearly states how he does it from ball position, to stance, to face angle, impact and follow through.

One of the best secrets is his discussion of how to hit shots with indirect contact with the ball. This is something that I never realized in years of trying to perfect lob shots and bunker shots.

In terms of bunker play Phil takes out a lot of the noise - eg) hit X inches behind the ball - and allows the golfer to focus more on variables that are easy to control including weight distribution and how that will effect approach angle and how the ball comes out of the bunker in different situations.

The trick shot segment is fun and probably not super practical for most golfers but interesting to see.

The most important aspects of improving your golf game are technique and practice. Phil provides some solid fundamentals, that with practice, can lead to an excellent putting stroke, chipping game and bunker play.

Seeing him hit the various shots in real time is obviously something to aspire to - and although few to none of us will get there because there are too few hours in the day - it is brilliant to see his technique executed properly.",1308614400,,1759,4.457943925233645

Several years ago, I used to complain that golf magazines talked a lot about 'swing without hooking' or 'swing without fading' or a lot more pages with  'tee-off for maximize distance with your driver!'.
Only the past few years has there been a gradual trend to say some more about the short game.

Phil Mickelson's instruction dvd is the best gift for golfers who want to work on their short game.
He's left-handed, and ends up being my mirror image on screen...but somehow, as a right handed golfer, I felt it easy to imitate.

For each type of shot, Phil explains the mechanics in ways that
- simply makes sense and gives me the confidence to try it out
- help me assimilate into my mind and to recall during a round

Terry Jastrow, the producer and director of this DVD is probably the best person to describe Phil Mickelson, ""I think he may be the most intellectual great golfer since Bobby Jones, and he has a very mathematical mind, he has a very scientific mind... And he sees the game in a fairly sort of scientific way, and yet what he does is actually fairly simple and more importantly he's articulate. He can explain it in a way that brings it all down to the common denominator, which is now the way that he understands it, so that he could explain it to people.
So by the time people get the chance to hear it and apply it, it's very straightforward, nothing too complicated...""

He explains that he had a chipping green in his  back yard and grew up practicing all the time.  That's it!  Great for him, but didn't help me much.

On the course, not only has this DVD improved my short game around the green, but most importantly I can hit bunker shots and have confidence on my short game from inside 100 yards!

Phil gives some great insight on putting.  He's 100% correct that all amateur's cant read a break (or line) and think it's closer than it is.  I've learned to read my breaks farther from the cup and get within 3 feet more than I ever had.  I love when my friends say I had an amazing read on the green!

3794639,5,B001TWT0DQ,"I have fluctuated between a 3 and a 6 handicap for the last several years, and have struggled with chipping and medium length putts more than any other aspects of my game.  As a relatively low handicap player, I was decent but not great with my short game and made my way off of my ball striking.  Previously I have worked on and utilized methods espoused by Stan Utley, Dave Pelz, Leadbetter, Harmon, and many others.
After golfing with a guy that was utilizing some of the techniques Mickelson teaches in this video I decided to order the DVD and give it a try.  Simply put, the guy was money.  He made fairly tough chip shots off of tight lies look routine, and he was very good inside 15 feet with the putter.

I immediately put Mickelson's chipping and putting stroke techniques into play and saw drastic results.  My biggest nemesis - chipping from tight lies - used to give me fits.  Many times I would chip twice or more on a single hole, either hitting chips fat or skulling them over the green.  The most important rule of wedge play is to make sure at all costs that your next shot is a putt.  The closer the putt that you leave yourself the better, but you must never ever leave yourself with another chip shot.  Using the hinge and hold technique, it just became much easier and my confidence soared.  That, combined with Phil's putting stroke technique has taken pressure off my iron game because I don't feel like I have to hit darts into the green and I can hit more conservative approach shots.

Phil's methods are simple and easy to learn.  He basically teaches to move the putter down the target line with a square face that closes on the through stroke to promote ""draw spin"".  His wedge tips are designed to keep the club gliding through the turf / sand as long as possible, and using an aggressive, accelerating swing.

I have posted 7 scores since i started using these techniques, and every one of the 7 rounds will count towards my handicap.  That means I'm playing my best golf in a long time, and it's thanks to the techniques from the DVD.
The production quality is good, and the materials well presented.  What can I say here - buy it, study it, practice it, put it into play, and watch your scores come down.",1275264000,6,2238,4.432762836185819

Phil's hinge and hold chipping/pitching/bunker technique is absolutely the best for both simplifying the setup and execution while adding consistency.  I chipped in the first week out after switching to Phil's method,  and my short game is much more consistent.  The flop and lob shot techniques are also fun to practice, but as Phil says, if you're having to use them frequently, you are probably not scoring well. Phil has changed the way I practice, since I now am very conscious of ending up in the 3 foot circle.  I prefer to add a little wrist hinge on chips, so Phil's technique is better for me than the Johnny Revolta style of ""putting"" with an upright iron or hybrid, which feels very robotic.

PHIL MAKES IT SIMPLE

Putting:
I'm convinced that many of the golf gurus think their answer has to be complicated to make it worth the price of advice.  Phil says 1/3 back 2/3 forward, don't let the club head get ahead of the arm, and  try to get it in a 3-foot circle.  There are a few more nuances, but that's about it  -- and I have had Zero 3 putts in the 36 holes I've played post video.  I know I'll 3-putt again, but I feel very confident about my stroke.

Chipping:
For twenty years I have carried the image of a Golf Digest cover with Ken Venturi showing a plaster cast on both wrists saying ""Chip with your Wrists in a Cast.""  Wrong.  Phil teaches ""hinge and hold"" with a quick wrist break and driving the arm to the target.  Great slow mo video shows how this is the ONLY WAY that will work with modern wedges.

The sand play section is spectacular.

Some pros or just instructors are nice guys, well meaning but just can't get their points across.  Arnold is one.  Lee Trevio, Ben Crenshaw.  Phil is one of those who CAN.  Like Jack.  His passion for the game and his desire to share what he knows with all who will listen come through.
Phil has the advantage of modern technology to keep his viewer captivated and his system or methodology is so straight forward and consistant with established methods, match that with his personality and the expert direction/production and you have a video you will not want to end.
Dave Pelz is a techie, Phil is one also.  You bring those two guys together and skill  plus science gets the job done.  Now one can take the video to the course with them and put it on the seat and expect their score to go down. You have to practice on GRASS a bit to see the result, thats with anything but these methods makes sense.  Well,  thats my two cents.

3794682,5,B001TWT0DQ,"I have bought and used a number of golf training DVDs and books in the past and have been able to get something positive out of all of them.

Phil's ""Secrets of the Short Game"" is by far the best.  The lessons are short and clear with great video examples.  Because he doesn't dwell on a hundred of the finer points the process and execution are very easy to commit to memory and use on the range or course.

After the first session at the range, about an hour and a half, I had pretty well gotten the technique down.  When I went to the course I didn't trust it at first but then willed myself to do it just as I had on the practice range and accept the results.

What happened is that my short game improved dramatically right away.  I was more accurate and learned to control the distance to a much finer degree.

After a month and a half I walk up to a shot of a 120 yards or less and confidently smack the ball right where I want it to go.  My handicap has dropped two points to 11 and the trend is down.

Now I am working on variations of loft using a higher lofted clubs and by opening the club face.  I have really started to know the effects in differing conditions such as deep rough, different sand compositions, and tighter lies.  It is going to take some time before I get really good in all those conditions but I am working in that direction.

A very large benefit of Phil's technique is that it has greatly improved my tempo with all of my clubs.  My confidense is higher and I believe my distance has improved as well.

By far, this is the best video lesson I have and I have Ledbetter, Smith, Harmon, and a couple of others.  All have their positives but this one is the best.

On a side note, the DVD set is worth the price just to watch Phil hit those astounding shots he is capable of.

3794699,5,B001TWT0DQ,"Solid advice on chipping and sand shots. Some good ideas on putting.
Interesting section on flop shots, but this is not the central theme of the DVD.
Phil can be hilarious when he gets opinionated, ""Why would anyone want to do that?!?!""
This DVD is worth the price, BUT it won't help unless you PRACTICE! (groan)",1243036800,,312,4.589285714285714

3794705,5,B001TWT0DQ,"I have been an avid follower of golf instruction for many years. Some of the information and insight here from Mickelson is brilliant and won't be found in any other instructional material from ANYONE. His explanation of his flop shot was so simple it made me sick!! If this doesn't improve your game, give up.",1242259200,,310,4.654545454545454
3794706,4,B001TWT0DQ,"This is a well produced golf instruction video. Shot concepts are simplified and well demonstrated, it was easy to go and practise the techniques after watching the video.
Excellent product and good value. Taken shots of my game.",1242000000,,229,5.052631578947368
3794707,4,B001TWT0DQ,"The ""Secrets of the Short Game"" is excellent.  All I need to do now is find a facility to practice the techniques he demonstrates.  One important factor about this DVD is that Phil makes it very easy to understand, now the only key is execution.",1241827200,,245,4.4222222222222225
3794708,3,B001TWT0DQ,"Phil is amazing with the short game, he shows some pretty cool things in this video.
The average golfer will never be able to take advantage of his technique.

Just my thoughts.",1241827200,,177,4.53125
3794709,5,B001TWT0DQ,"Love these DVD's.  The instruction is easy to follow.  After one practice session, I saw immediate improvement in my chipping.  My confidence has drastically increased.  I highly recommend this to everyone (except my playing buddies).",1241481600,,234,5.6
3794710,5,B001TWT0DQ,This is the best video I have ever seen for the short game.

3794711,4,B001TWT0DQ,"The DVD's provide a good overview the short game from Phil's perspective.  I liked his simple approach and the modifications he showed to the basic approach.  The drills were pretty good as well.

My favorite part of the DVD is that Phil just comes out says what he thinks and doesn't tip toe around the other philosophies out there.",1241308800,2,333,4.610169491525424
3794712,5,B001TWT0DQ,Totally enjoyed the DVD. I have modified my putting and chipping/pitching based upon Phil's methods and achieved great success. I had a big problem with skulling or hitting pitch shots fat. Those problems are now virtually eliminated and in fact I have had several pitches go in the cup.,1241308800,,287,4.877551020408164
3794713,5,B001TWT0DQ,"Phil is the best golf's short player ever. His knowledge and experience is big and the way he present his teaching is very interesting,  independent if you are a golf player or not. A must have for all golf players.",1241308800,,215,4.375
3794714,2,B001TWT0DQ,"While I enjoyed the video and the production quality was excellent, I have tried the ""method"" and it fails the ""amateur test"". Obviously Phil can do what he is demonstrating but I think he should have tried these ideas on real average golfers first to see if they could learn them. I am an average 14 handicaper with a decent short game already but I can't copy his results after hours of trying. I even think I know why: his hinge and hold has a fatal flaw. If you hinge and come steeply down to the ball you have to be pretty accurate to catch the ball consistently well. There is just too little room for error and average golfers don't typically hit thousands of balls a week to perfect these moves. Everything else about the chip technique is fine and it is fun to hit his flop shots but I don't trust it to use during play. The bunker technique is supposed to be rhythmical but you have to hinge up close to your body and then swing outwards towards the pin at about 40 degrees while maintaining a firm wrist and extension. Sound easy? Now do that so consistenly that you land within the 3 foot circle. Nope - still in the sand. Now that I have tried his method I think he is a little hypocritical in saying his is the only correct method. Perhaps for pros, but not for Joes. Stick with Pelz' more forgiving technique with a shallower approach. The putting has the same problem. He promotes a rotating clubhead that is timed just right and takes a lot of feel. Again, stick with his teacher, Pelz, and use a straight putt move. Kind of mechanical but hard to screw up. I was really hoping this would be good, especially with Pelz in the background. I suppose we will now have Tiger telling us how to get 120 mph swing speeds ""the easy way""!",1241049600,54,1746,4.310030395136778
3794715,5,B001TWT0DQ,Without a doubt the best short game instructional I've seen and I've watched many. His technique and descriptions are crisp and clean. Worth every pennie in my opinion.,1240963200,,168,5.035714285714286

This is not a puff video like so many other pros have put out. He is not holding back. Tells great info on putting, chipping, sand, and the lob shot he is so well known for. Some things were shared in these videos I have never seen before and I have studied the game for nearly 2o years and bought many dvds and even more books. Great job on the production of these dvds.

3794720,5,B001TWT0DQ,"I must agree with those who love Phil's short game instruction.  The key that Phil demonstrates so clearly is how his method, the hinge and hold works.  The backswing is really just a hinge of the wrists with very little lateral movement.  The hold, isn't really a hold but making sure that the hands stay ahead of the club head to the finish.  I'm a 5 handicap and the short game is what's keeping me from being scratch.  I feel sure that this instruction from Phil is going to help me realize that goal.  Thanks Phil !!",1240012800,,521,4.319587628865979
