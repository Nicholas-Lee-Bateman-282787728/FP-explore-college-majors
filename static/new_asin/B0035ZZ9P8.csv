8389319,5,B0035ZZ9P8,"Second season stories hit full stride.  This season exploits the established pattern from the first season of ""Not in sequence"" stories in each episode.  Over time you begin to see the full pattern out of all the pieces.",1385769600,,220,4.7631578947368425
8389320,5,B0035ZZ9P8,"The second season is a continuation of the first, though ""continuation"" might not really apply because all the episodes are in asynchronous order. The asynchronous order takes a little bit of getting used to, but it is actually a masterstroke because it improves the slice-of-life feel and also it is highly satisfying to remember plot points from several episodes ago that are filled in a later episode. Whether one enjoys the show will depend in part on one's general preferences: this is a slice of life comedy, so there is no adventure, no action, and no villain; the only overarching plot is the growth of four girls in their first and second years of high school. For those who like the type of show, however, this one is highly recommended.",1352246400,,747,4.753846153846154
8389321,5,B0035ZZ9P8,"I LOVE Hidamari Sketch with all my heart especially since its one of my favorite genre of anime which is ""Slice of Life"" slice of life is more like an anime you have to pay attention to because it has a really interesting plot/story If you think thats what your into then this anime seires is for you",1305504000,2,300,4.189655172413793
8389322,5,B0035ZZ9P8,"One of my favourite anime types that I seek out is comedy based off of Japanese 4 panel comic artwork (yonkoma); Lucky Star, Azumanga Daioh, K-On!, GA Geijutsuka Art Design Class, et cetera. I like the jumpy randomness, the nonchronological stories... especially for repeat watching. You're not following over-ly complex story arcs. Although all of these shows tend to take you through the three years of high school, this series is extra special that the story is completely out of sequence based on months. I enjoy piecing the story together or my brain doing it for me.

The characters are quite appealing, especially the spazz Miyako; I hope Sentai eventually releases the 3rd season.",1292544000,2,688,5.035087719298246
