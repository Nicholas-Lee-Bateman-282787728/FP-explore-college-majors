7513625,2,B017RR6ZG6,Annoyingly homophobic. Was this made by a straight person that likes stereotypes?  I was hoping this was based on a true story. It really has nothing to do about Stonewall. The story doesn't even make sense and it is totally not how the riots started or anything close. The last 25 min were the most horrible experience. Trevor should have been with Danny and then Trevor should have stayed like the nice activist he is then they should have some how been a part of the riot without the wierd drug street addict characters. This movie is just a insult to the Stonewall riots...,1453075200,,577,4.548076923076923

7513627,5,B017RR6ZG6,Very different from the 1995 version of the same name. But a deeper look into the back stories of the characters and shows the darker side of LGBT kids on their own trying to survive. It's that side everyone knows exists but seems to overlook. If you compare it to the 1995 version they look like very different stories. In my opinion this shows a more true to life side of history,1452211200,13,381,4.305555555555555
7513628,5,B017RR6ZG6,"I am puzzled by the overwhelming hostility towards this movie.  This is an excellent movie with a good story and an outstanding cast.  The production quality of this movie is definitely among the highest of gay-themed movies.  I know first hand that it is very difficult for a gay movie to obtain significant funding and support from the big studios and I am glad Roland Emmerich was able to do so.  There are some historical inaccuracies, but we should keep in mind that this isn't a documentary film.  I certainly would not hold it against this movie.  As an actor, Jeremy Irvine certainly has come a long way since his War Horse days.  His portrayal of a small town boy growing up in the 60s is quite convincing to me.  I still remember the feeling when I first moved to NYC.",1452038400,24,778,4.468085106382978
7513629,2,B017RR6ZG6,"How do you make a film celebrating gay rights that will appeal to the widest possible audience - including viewers who are predisposed to view the issue in a negative light?
1. Disguise it as a coming-of-age story.
2. Make the hero as straight-looking as possible.
3. Reduce the gay-love scenes to the bare minimum, and shoot them in near total darkness.
4. Use bombast and spectacle to distract uneasy viewers.
Judge director Roland Emmerich's Stonewall by these absurd criteria, and it would be a flaming success.
Stonewall is a well-meaning, if seriously wrongheaded, attempt by the openly gay filmmaker to depict the events surrounding the 1969 Stonewall Riots in New York, which put gay rights on the national map as a bona fide civil rights issue.
Emmerich, who specializes in absurdly loud, oversize action blockbusters such as Independence Day, Godzilla 2012, and White House Down, tries so hard to make Stonewall palatable to the most-conservative gay-bashing viewer that he ends up stripping the film of any real meaning.
His gay characters come off either as straight or as over-the-top caricatures, while their actions are depicted with such fantastical theatricality, they feel entirely unreal.
Jeremy Irvine stars as Danny Winters, a handsome farmer's boy from Indiana whose parents kick him out when he's caught carrying on with one of his high school football teammates.
Danny moves to New York, where he finds a home with the misfits and lovers, addicts and activists, who make up Greenwich Village's fabled gay scene.
Fabled is an apt word: While it certainly looks gorgeous on screen, the Village that Emmerich gives us feels as real as a children's story.
That's all the more troubling considering the filmmaker's stated intention to use Stonewall as a vehicle to depict the hard life led by the hundreds of homeless LGBT teens who stream to America's cities each year, many resorting to prostitution.
Danny and his friends, including bosom-buddy Ray (Jonny Beauchamp), survive by working as hustlers. But their lives seem to have far more in common with a number from Rent than an episode of NYPD Blue.
Stonewall, which features a memorable performance from Jonathan Rhys Meyers as a political activist who captures Danny's heart, dances around the darker issues of the day. Sometimes literally: In one riot scene, a score of young men climb on top of a car. Kitted out in denim cutoffs, women's dresses, or Jimi Hendrix-styled headband-secured afros, they pump their fists in the air. Overall, the effect is closer to a Monty Python skit or a Village People music vid than a serious film about civil rights.
Emmerich, who invested his own money in the film, should be praised for trying to bring one of the most important episodes in the gay rights movement to Middle America. But one wonders if the final product was worth the effort.",1450742400,3,2857,5.004201680672269
7513630,4,B017RR6ZG6,"I recently saw the movie Stonewall at a local theatre in Atlanta and left, feeling that I had seen a flawed film but one that was certainly worth seeing. The actors did a superb job, the soundtrack, particularly A Whiter Shade Pale, which carried me back many years, was enthralling, the seedy scenery I thought captured the Christopher Street area of New York in 1969 perfectly, and I was delighted to see that people of colordrag queens, trans women and transvestites-- who supposedly were in the front lines of the Stonewall riots had gotten the footage in the film they justly deserved. Parts of the movie moved me tremendously, particularly the ending. And while I was fairly certain that the young Caucasian gay man from the Midwest and bound for Columbia University was fictional, I thought his story that the director wove in and out of the Stonewall narrative reminded usif we needed a reminderthat life for young gay men in small towns in 1969 was hell. (I know since like Danny, I fled to a big city.)  His father acted the way countless other fathers reacted upon learning that they had a gay or lesbian child when we were considered illegal, sick and going to hell by the powers that were. And finally when I looked at my watch as I left the theater I was totally surprised that the film had run over two hours. It seemed much shorter.  Parts of the movie, however, were way over the top and didn't work for me.  A case in particular was the kidnapping of Danny where he was meant to have sex with a garish fat man in drag. That entire scene should have been deleted.

Then I read the reviews and learned that the gay politically correct contingent would be boycotting the film and that I should too. As I recall, I had heard similar admonishments about Boys in the Band, Cruising and Philadelphia, to name three films with gay characters.  (I saw all these movies and lived to tell the story and am not usually amused when anyone tells me what I should not see or read.)  Conventional wisdom by those who look out for my interests is that the director whitewashed the film by putting so much emphasis on Danny, who is by anyones standards, quite a hunk. The director is certainly in good company since the directors of three recent films Philomena , The Imitation Game and Selma certainly play fast and loose with the facts,  much to my consternation.  I know this because I saw the movies, rather than reading reviews of them.  The critics, particularly the one from the New York Times, found nothing to like about the film, from the director, Roland Emmerich-- who happens to be gay--  to the choice of clothing for the characters, etc., etc., etc. The police were portrayed as too violent. (I wondered on what planet these folks were writing from). Another criticism is that Danny could not fall in love with the effeminate Ray, and says so. While it is an unpleasant reality, effeminate men are often put down by more masculine gay men, or what society perceives as masculine, even today and certainly even more so in 1969 so Danny is in character here. There is also racism within our community; perhaps that is why Danny is not in love with Ray. Or maybe he doesnt need a reason for not falling for Ray, who as I understand, is based on an actual person and gets about equal time in the movie with Danny.  And I am not sure how someone can tell me not to see a movie that he/she has not seen. I remember years ago asking a similar question to a woman protesting the film I Am Curious Yellow at an art theater in Kansas City because she found it pornographic. She had not seen the movie. I walked around her and bought my ticket.

The film made the cover of the latest issue of the Advocate magazine, along with a very positive article. Larry Kramer, whom I often find myself at odds with,  also admonished the director not to listen to the craziesstrong language but what do you expect from Mr. Kramer?-- and said that keeping your film from being seen is only hurting ourselves. Mr. Emmerich has written that the film was a labor of love for him and that when his film finally comes to theaters, audiences will see that it deeply honors the real-live activists who were there. I agree with him.  You can see this movie and live. I did, as did a friend of mine who happens to be black. He has just seen the movie and liked it too. And just when I thought that I had blathered on enough about political correctness, I read an article on the Huffington Post entitled Was It Good for the Gays? Milk written by someone  who was cold and bored when he saw the movie in 2008 and had the same reaction at a recent reviewing. I was delighted to see that the author got trounced by the comments to his article.",1447718400,43,4721,4.45422943221321
7513701,4,B017RR6ZG6,"Touching story of survival and the fight for U.S. Constitutional rights & dignity revolving around an Indiana small town high school senior, Danny (Jeremy Irvine), betrayed by his long-term lover & his parents when he is outed.  So he goes to Manhattan's Greenwich Village because he will be going to Columbia University that Fall.

A Puerto Rican transvestite hustler and other ""street kids"" help Danny survive.  At least two major characters connected with the ""street kids"" are African American transvestites.

They all are at the Stonewall Inn the night of the riots and become active participants demanding their U.S. Constitutional rights and the end to police brutality, arbitrary arrests, and harassment.

They also demand the end to mob control of gay bars in Greenwich Village as well as police protection from violence, including murder.  Supposedly the police raid that triggered the riot is because the police were looking for the Stonewall Inn manager who is suspected of involvement in the brutal murder of a young male hustler.

Just as the Stonewall Inn at that time was known for hustlers and transvestite clientele the movie also features these subgroups.

The movie also features lesbians including one who is repeatedly arrested by the police.  There is a funny scene in which she repeatedly tries to escape from a police car.

Danny's relationship with his sister is particularly touching.  Danny's ex-lover and mother seem to want to do the right thing by Danny but are stymied by their own fear.  Danny's father seems torn by his bigotry and concern for his son.

The movie fleshes out the causes and consequences of the 1969 Stonewall Inn riots.",1499731200,,1670,5.073260073260073

7513704,5,B017RR6ZG6,"This is an amazing film.  If you compare the reviews on Amazon to the critics, you'll see that.  Viewers love it.  It has amazing acting, writing, production.  The star Jeremy Irvine gives a stunning performance.  Sure, this movie wants to explore farm town homophobia in the late 60's as well as the Stonewall Riots, but the critiques of whitewashing are insane.  This is a film with a white protagonist but it's Ray (who is trans and latino/latina) is the hero of the film.  In fact, Ray asks Danny and the viewer to question white privilege and cis privilege when she screams at Danny ""the difference between you and us, we don't have a choice.""
This film is very diverse and the portrayals of queer people of color are complex and well-acted - not only Ray but Conga and Marsha,
It's a shame that this film was so badly reviewed because it's better film than most. The film show how important trans people and people of color were to the Stonewall movement and yes it does so through (gasp) the lens of a beautiful, white young man, but to say this film is whitewashing or has a white point of view is reductive and unfair. It has a queer point of view that is revolutionary, beautiful and inspired -one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Don't believe the critics!

It reminds me of an old Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney movie where they had to put on a show to raise money to save the farm except the Garland, Rooney movies were entertaining. This movie isn't. The road to bad movies is paved with good intentions; and  Emmerich probably had the good intention of highlighting the Gay Rights struggle, but his approach is so hands off that it is impossible to sympathize with the movie's characters and if you don't connect with the characters, you can't care about the movie. Emmerich has a habit of borrowing from other movies, and here we have cliches: prancing, preening queens; thick headed thuggish cops; pathetic tricks; betrayer, best friend/lover; wise little sister; understanding mother; homophobic father; Emmerich is O.K. at directing special effects, but not directing people.

7513755,3,B017RR6ZG6,"Perhaps the problem with this movie begins with the title STONEWALL which would appear to portry the important historical event in LGBT civil rights. The real story of Stonewall is bigger and more complex than this movie can capture. A more accurate title would would be HOW A WHITE, LOVESICK, GAY KID FROM INDIANA SPENT HIS SUMMER IN GREENWICH VILLAGE IN 1969.  This film is historical fiction about coming of age, about coming out, about coming to grips with a society in which different was celebrated.  Then the movie shows fast moving, raucous moment in time when the street folk fought back against repression of the police who patrolled the streets and the mob controlled the bars and paid off the police through the eyes of a newbie.  The valid complaints and concerns about the movie putting the new kid at the center of this event are vexing because the actual leaders and fighters are marginalized.  Having the new kid ""throwing the first stone"" may be effective dramatically, but that writing and directing decision throws history completely off balance.  Have him stand aside at this critical moment and a different, more truthful story is possible--an eye witness to history not a maker of history.",1484870400,,1212,4.921568627450981

Of course it has changed a little for story purposes, but I grew to care about the character's, and I can only imagine the pain, torment, and hate they faced concerning their gay life style.

I grew up not long after this -I remember the ""bar"" life & times and had a more rich diverse experience than just drag queens and street life people.

I guess I was just hoping for more but expecting the worst from all the reviews I had read, so for me it's not the horrible trash this movie has been portrayed to be, but it leaves a lot to be desired...

7514329,4,B017RR6ZG6,"This is both a historical drama and a fictitious young man's coming of age story as he finds himself during the transition from high school to college. It's about the stonewall riots, but much of the general emotion and raw sentiment is universal.

Our protagonist Danny has to figure out what to do when he is rejected for being 'different' first by peers and then by his parents. It was relatable to much of my own current struggles as a person with disabilities who is not accepted by her father. The need for money and survival trumps what we like and prefer doing when we want to stay alive. This too is 'politics'.

We are introduced to the Mattachine Society, one of the earliest gay clubs. It was founded by Franklin Kammney, who had been fired by the civil service commission for being a homosexual. Learning about  federal employment restrictions which were then a reality visibly dashes the aspirations of young Danny. He was headed to Columbia to work for NASA.

The revelation that his government can and does legally discriminate against him in employment only because of sexual orientation seems quaint today. Why is he in college if he will even be unable to find and obtain gainful employment afterwards?? This too resonated with my current day challenges.

Danny ultimately does return home to talk with his mom and sister. His dad is still adamantly opposed to him,. Dad is such a jerk that he drives off when Danny is on the side of the road and wants to make peace. But Danny now also has a new family in NY. He has a community of people who do love and care for him very much.  Both of the families are excited about participating in the very first gay liberation pride parade

They are so earnestly psyched that it becomes tempting to forget how retrospectively miniscule social justice was for anybody who was not straight white able-bodied male in 1970

The only issues I had with this film was a stupid drag mob clip inserted midway-end. Danny is sexually assaulted by a mob boss in drag who could pass for Mimi on the Drew Carey Show?? Huh?? There were better ways to explain that the bars were under mob control. And these entities were VERY sleazy operations. We get the point here.

Then the first half of the film had Danny's past juxtaposed with the present. It looked like an episode or two of Happy Days was spliced in??  They could have just shown the film with a completely forward screenplay so there was less confusion in following along.

But all in all, it was a good movie. People who like history--especially social justice buffs would like this movie. And anybody just wanting a movie about yes, family relationships in general can connect with this movie.",1458950400,,2699,4.637316561844863

7514335,4,B017RR6ZG6,"Stonewall is a thoroughly entertaining although a fictional account of the Stonewall riots starting on June 28, 1969. A fictional hero, Danny, is kicked out of his home in Indiana by a bible-thumping dad. He heads for New York and soon finds himself among a varied group of street people, several of whom are based on real people or a composite of real people. (All of them are conveniently dead now.) After getting beaten by the police, Danny is happy to throw the first brick through a window, which starts the riot. Much flak has been made of the WASPY Danny starting the ball rolling, when more diverse minorities were responsible. His whiteness aside, this movie is actually a story of the steps Danny takes in coming out as a proud gay man, culminating with the first Pride march.  Jeremy Irvine, a Brit playing the corn-fed Midwesterner, is completely convincing in his role.

Many other things in the movie are historically inaccurate. Three years before the Stonewall riots, a liquor authority regulation forbidding homosexuals to congregate was challenged as unconstitutional and was done away with.  The movie does point out rightly that the Stonewall was an illegal, mob-owned club that sold liquor without a license. Legit bars were NOT being raided.  A law forbidding people to dress in clothing of the opposite sex was indeed used by the police to harass and arrest transsexuals. In the movie, a gay activist  promotes conservative values at a fictitious meeting place in Greenwich Village. This real-life activist did promote the idea that gays who fought for equality should dress in suits and act like their straight counterparts, but this particular activist led the Washington group. Such conservative opinions were never adopted by New York's leaders.",1457913600,,1772,5.054794520547945

If you are interested in watching this movie looking to see an accurate portrayal of the Stonewall Riots, then you won't like this movie. If you are straight and want to watch a movie that showed the struggles that gay men had to endure, then you won't like this movie. It's white-washed (even by my standards - and I am white), devoid of any women (except one lesbian character) and has scenes that made me cringe for how unbelievably homophobic they were. It's a gay movie and it made me ashamed to be gay.
Basically - you won't like this movie. Check out ""The Normal Heart"", ""Milk"" or even ""Brokeback Mountain"" if you're looking for a semi-mainstream film focusing on gay issues.

7514500,2,B017RR6ZG6,"The 2015 version of ""Stonewall"" goes well beyond being flawed.  It is an outright LIE and does a huge disservice to the people actually involved in those riots.

This watered-down version has as its protagonist a young, white, blonde-haired, blue-eyed babe from Indiana, named Danny Winters, (played by Jeremy Irvine.  He shows up one day in NYC because he supposedly has a scholarship to Columbia University.  Trouble is, once he arrives, he has no place to stay, no friends, and barely any money.  He is immediately befriended by a group of transgender males and drag queens.  One, named Ray, a/k/a Ramona (wonderfully played by Jonny Beauchamp), immediately feels some sort of connection to ""Columbia,"" and sort of takes him under his wing.  However, Ray is a notorious male hustler, and eventually Danny is introduced to this lifestyle to survive.  Ray definitely has a crush on Danny; however, the feeling is not mutual.  All this mess has NOTHING to do with the Stonewall Riots, which is viewed by many gays, transgenders, lesbians, and drag queens as THE first actual gay movement.

The big problem I had with the movie is I KNOW several facts surrounding Stonewall.  I grew up during that period (circa 1969).  It was NEVER about one white boy who decided to throw a brick through a window.  Anyone who knows anything about Stonewall knows the riot was started by a black drag queen named Marsha P. Johnson.  The majority of participants were not white.  They were black transgender males and drag queens who had had enough with being constantly harassed by the NYC police department.  Director Roland Emmerich's version would have you believe just the opposite.  I do not have any idea as to why he chose the path he did to portray a very pivotal moment in the gay movement.  His version is so ""white-bread,"" so untrue, it was all I could do to finish the movie.  What few black characters he did have in his movie were so non-threatening and over-the-top, is was as though he made this movie for a ""whites only"" audience.  He makes all characters--except the white ones--completely unlikable.  By doing this, he did a huge disservice to anyone and everyone involved in this very important chapter in the gay movement.

At first, I wasn't sure what was happening and my friend grabbed me by the arm and insisted we get far away lest the melee expand further out in our direction. The police were absolutely brutal; and with their swinging clubs could have given the Nazi Gestapo a run for its money. The only thing missing were German Shepherd dogs. The newly gay ""army"" responded with equal force. It wasn't until the next day that the newspapers revealed some of what happened. Basically, the gays in that area had had enough and weren't going to put up with being brutalized any more by individuals who should have been protecting them and were on the dole to boot. There's no telling how many might have fully guessed the full significance of STONEWALL (named after the local bar in that area) but it turned out to be a seminal moment in the history of American gay rights (brilliantly summed up and presented by Jonathan Rhys Meyers - who played the character of Trevor - after the film was over in a DVD extra interview). Directed by Roland Emmerich - who admitted to being gay in his commentary - this film did NOT come off as a documentary but rather a tragic human interest story where a needlessly suppressed segment of our population finally said ""enough is enough!"". It had a ""you are there"" look and feeling with a

superb cast ranging from Jeremy Irvine (Waterhorse, etc.) who seemed to be playing the composite part of an ""every(gay)man"". (As a British actor, he excelled at effecting a mid-Western American accent and persona from Indiana.) His role is central and critical to the
entire story. There was also a laudatory performance by Jonny Beauchamp (Penny Dreadful, etc.) as a sometime drag queen and boy out for hire who becomes Irvine's best friend and ""tutor"", initiating him into the confined gay world of pre-Stonewall days. There is also Jonathan Rhys Meyers (another British actor known for playing Henry VIII in The Tudors) who convincingly plays the head of the regional Mattachine Society and thought that the road to the advancement of Gay Rights was through peaceful means. Ron Perlman
(Hell Boy, etc.) as a scurrilous club owner and sometime ""pimp"" who later on does a 180 degree turn is also exceedingly well played. The entire supporting cast must be given individual and collective kudos as well.  This is not a film for the squeamish with its sex,
language, duplicity, vulgarity, and brutality. But it is what it was and should be carefully scrutinized for what America was like (and still is in too many sectors) a mere 45+ years ago. It is like a group ""coming out"" story that ultimately obliterated the closet, the house
which contained it, and allowed the sunlight to illuminate the cave of oppressive darkness that had imprisoned and crushed so many.",1454198400,15,3052,4.692164179104478
7514565,4,B017RR6ZG6,Entertaining but a bit too theatrical.  Filming leaves room for improvement.  Very noticeable that all NYC shots were filmed at a studio in California.,1453766400,,151,5.25

7514567,4,B017RR6ZG6,"Gay themed films are n abundance right now and (lesbian couples, transgender stories, more gay characters in many films) so it seems only natural that yet another film be made about the beginning of gay rights in the US. STONEWALL does that and despite the emphasis on political corruption attempting to steal the thunder from the brave gays who initiated the change to Gay Pride it works for the most part.

Many viewers will avoid the film because of the depiction of gays as being homeless, feminine street hustlers  too much so that it becomes a distraction form the other aspects of the story  but at least the message and the dates and the history are there.

The plot revolves around the 1969 Stonewall Riots, the violent clash that kicked off the gay rights movement in New York City. The drama centers on Danny Winters (Jeremy Irvine), who flees to New York after an aborted coming out with Joe (Karl Glusman) and being ousted by his homophobic father (David Cubitt), leaving behind his sister Phoebe (Joey King). He finds his way to the Stonewall Inn, where he meets Trevor (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) before catching the eye of Ed Murphy (Ron Perlman), manager of the Stonewall who colludes with corrupt police and exploits homeless youth. Danny becomes close to a group of nellie hustlers  especially Ray (Jonny Beauchamp)  and it is his association with this gay element that he eventually joins and fights for gay rights.

The cast is strong, the script by Jon Robin Baitz is less than impressive, but director Roland Emmerich manages to make the blend of history and human tragedy credible. Not a great movie, but the intentions are worthy. Grady Harp, January 16",1453593600,2,1673,4.808362369337979
7514568,2,B017RR6ZG6,"I, too, thought the script of this movie could have been so much better.  As it is, it's about a gay guy who leaves his small town to go to New York, and oh ya, along the way the Stonewall Riots happen and things change for gays.  However, we don't really get to see that, we just see a few sentences about how things changed for the better.  As a straight person and not at all familiar with the Stonewall Riots, I would have preferred to see much more of a story about the riots and the positive effects afterwards........not the story of Danny who falls in love with his classmate.",1453334400,6,584,4.243243243243243

8740257,5,B017RR6ZG6,"""Stonewall"" speaks to the watershed moment in America's gay history.  The pent up rage and anger that homosexuals had felt and experienced over decades was unleashed, finally.  The issues that faced gays at that time, and even experience sometimes in today's more enlightened culture, are deftly covered.  Jeremy Irvine, the star, is exceptionally handsome, good looking.  He fits that ""country boy"" look well.  The family difficulties Irvine portrays as Danny are found even in today's world.  Parental rejection of gay youth is the beyond painful.  That Danny was outed by his athlete love was and still is too common.  The script of ""Stonewall"" is well conceived, touching upon the multiple layers of challenge, pain and joy that are felt among the LGBTQ across the globe.  ""Stonewall"" remains relevant even now, several years after it production.",1531008000,,850,5.237037037037037
8740258,5,B017RR6ZG6,"This movie was very well and tastefully done, giving an inspiring life to this historical moment in Gay history.

It's a crying shame that it has been unreasonably maligned by attention-seeking folks who didn't even bother to watch before branding it with unjust judgement.

It gave very fair treatment, attention, and credit to all of the variety of minorities that were involved!

I'm very glad I bought this movie and I hope you will too. They deserve our support, and this story deserves to be told!",1530403200,,503,4.825581395348837

The acting is powerful spot on. No wonder so many wanted to be a part of this film. Jon Robin Baitz is a wonderful writer and this is a quintessential story he has told so well. There are no stereotypes in this movie. I believe Baitz, who is a Gay man himself, wrote these characters true to make them come alive' and they did. It seems impossible to capture every single faction of a social movement but I believe the collaborators on this film did, Beautiful film work-- excellent directing, all of it was superb. An important film for anyone wishing to understand the Gay Rights Movement and celebrate freedom and equality in America.",1530316800,,804,4.709219858156028

8740262,1,B017RR6ZG6,"This was a very whitewashed, straightwashed version of the true story.  There was so much room to develop both the stories of Sylvia Rivera and Ray Castro without mindlessly combining them into one character, ""Ray"", in order to give the white male lead more air time, who by the way does not even exist in the actual events of the Stonewall Riots.  In 2015, you would expect more from the movie industry.  They had a real opportunity to accurately portray the Stonewall Riots and capture the truly brave and heroic movement that Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and Ray Castro helped create.  Shame on Jon Robin Baitz and Roland Emmerich.",1508716800,,639,4.781818181818182
