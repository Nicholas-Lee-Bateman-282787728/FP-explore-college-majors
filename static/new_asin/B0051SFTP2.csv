4525902,4,B0051SFTP2,"Once again we find our meddling mutt Scooby-Doo in the third volume of his new series.  The four episodes this disc has (and again, not much else) are:

""Battle of the Humungonauts"" - A pair of hulking creatures start wrecking places in Crystal Cove.  Mayor Jones asks Fred and the gang to find out what's what.  So they do and with a new look to boot - Fred's idea; no surprise.

""Howl of the Fright Hound"" - Scooby is accused of attacking innocent people throughout the town.  Either he's to blame or else Scooby must find the real culprit.

""The Secret Serum"" - A vampire runs rampant and starts stealing some unusual items.  The prime suspect for this case, however, is Daphne's mom.

""The Shrieking Madness"" - The kids spend the weekend at a campus called Darrow College.  All of a sudden, a monster known as Char Gar Gothakon is terrorizing everyone.

Not to be a spoiler or anything, but I think I heard that the rest of the first season will be coming to a special 2-disc set in the near future with the last 14 episodes on there.  I'm sure it'll be worth waiting for even if the season ended on a sad note.  Perhaps I've said too much....",1320105600,,1147,4.37914691943128
4525903,4,B0051SFTP2,"My kids are hooked on Scooby Doo!  Wish they gave more hints about solving this mystery!  My kids are eager to solve it- or have the Mystery Inc group solve it.  I am curious, too....  Solution is not in this set of DVD's.  Guess another one is coming out soon???",1317772800,,263,4.18
4525904,3,B0051SFTP2,"Come on WB, where is the season set?!!

At least give us volume's that have more than 4 episodes. The other downside to these releases and why WB is quickly falling behind in television releases, is that they don't include any worthwhile extras and don't release the show in HD. The recent Scooby movies haven't had extras either, disappointing for such a long running character, but I can justify buying them to see them in crystal clear high definition. This series deserves the same treatment. As is, with only four episodes a release and in standard definition, I'm better watching these episodes online at my leisure and these releases seem to only be aimed at parents, or perhaps complete purists who don't mind being ripped off.

At any rate for anyone who wants to purchase this ridiculous release, not even a behind the scenes feature yet about how they designed or came to creating the new series, the four episodes included are:

Battle of the Humungonauts
When two giant monsters start to attack Crystal Cove, Mayor Jones asks Fred and the gang to help him and the sheriff capture them. Meanwhile, Shaggy has to choose between his relationship with Velma and his friendship with Scooby.

Howl of the Fright Hound
A monster called the Fright Hound starts attacking Crystal Cove and people believe Scooby-Doo is behind it. Could be Scooby the one attacking the city or is someone setting him up?

The Secret Serum
There's a vampire loose in Crystal Cove, terrorizing the residents and stealing an odd assortment of loot. When the gang does some sniffing around, they discover an unlikely suspect... Daphne's MOTHER. Things are already strained within Mystery Inc., and with this latest blow, the gang is truly torn in half. Girls on one side, boys on the other.

The Shrieking Madness
With Mystery Inc. broken up, the gang decides to check out life after high school and spend a weekend at DARROW COLLEGE. But things don't go as planned when a creature called CHAR GAR GOTHAKON begins terrorizing the campus.

A decent enough four episodes, this series tries to bring back the dark tone and creepiness of the original series, so despite its arguable flaws I enjoy it. It tries to do some new things while still being strongly tied and close in roots to the original series. Give it a try if you haven't seen it or had been turned off by other recent Scooby ventures. As far as these releases, WB is starting to stand for Why Bother.

UPDATE: Apparently, as of October 13th 2011, WB is listening to the fans... somewhat. After these first three releases that basically rip customers off they have announced the second half of the season will be released in a 2 disc dvd set with the final 14 episodes, Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated Season 1, Part 2. Date is set for January 24th, 2012.

There is no mention, however, of Blu-ray or of any special features being included. At least the dvd set, if nothing else is released, allows fans to own over three times as many episodes as these volume releases but at only $5 more suggested retail price. The set will be only $19.99 and likely sold on sale by amazon and other retailers.",1316217600,23,3137,4.720292504570384

4525918,4,B0051SFTP2,"My son LOVES Scooby! So I thought it would be nice to grab the latest incarnation of the old classic.

This series is actually quite entertaining and sticks to a lot of the classic ideas of Scooby and the gang, but does so with a much darker twist.  It is still somewhat suitable for smaller children, but isn't as much slap-stick humor as the previous versions.

However, these ""Volumes"" only contain 4 episodes.  I really wish they had broken it down into Part 1 with 12 episodes, much like they did Season 1 Part 2 with 14 episodes.",1362096000,2,535,4.428571428571429

4525921,5,B0051SFTP2,What a marvelous set of characters that are all positive role models for children.  Where respect for each other and cooperation and collaboration are the order of the day.  Compare this to the Simpsons and Family Guy and there is no comparison. This is quality children's entertainment.,1349049600,,287,5.085106382978723
4525922,2,B0051SFTP2,"I bought this, and the other two volumes that complete the series, for my daughter, who just can't get enough of Scooby Doo.

However, three discs, packaged and sold individually at an average of $10, brings me to a total of about $30 for a SHORT (12-episode) season.

Add to that the fact that the plastic cases are beyond flimsy, and I'm not feeling like this was my best-value Amazon purchase.

The compression quality is not exactly stellar either, which is inexcusable given how little material is on each disc.",1343520000,7,516,4.711111111111111
4525923,5,B0051SFTP2,"I have to say, I usually don't like when classic cartoons are re-vamped...but then I LOVE cartoons.  This new version of Scooby-Doo is actually a lot of fun.  My only complaint is the ""romance"" between Velma and Shaggy.  I just don't buy it.  But it's a lot darker than the original and still a lot of fun.  I have the entire first season and can't wait for season 2 to start and then come out on DVD.",1334793600,,401,4.1558441558441555
4525924,3,B0051SFTP2,"As a long time fan of Scooby Doo in all its iterations, I was pleased to see a new take on the ongoing franchise. The new series is impressive visually but the artwork, the more stylized characters, takes some getting used to. I was pleased that they retained the ""Man in a mask"" theme. It remains the only cartoon that takes a realist point of view on the supernatural, which we could use more of.
I enjoyed the series on the Cartoon Network but I have, with great reluctance, put off purchasing the DVDs. After seeing the amazing HD quality on TV, I could not be satisfied with anything less in my collection. Please! Issue a complete season collection on Blu-Ray! Now!",1331942400,,671,4.508196721311475
4525925,5,B0051SFTP2,"This is an interesting series. Each episode has a Mystery (geenerally a villian in costume with gadgets etc...), but some episodes are linked with an overall theme that come to fruition during the last half dozen episodes os so. I am eagerly awaiting the next volume. The release of this DVD into volumes has been slow.",1327104000,,319,4.714285714285714
