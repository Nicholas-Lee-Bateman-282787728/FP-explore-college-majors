7132258,4,B00WH762DI,"A finely wrought drama exposing issues past and present between two estranged gay brothers, set in a small California farming community.
""Bad boy"" Todd returns home from his wild city life to reunite with older brother Chet, somewhat upsetting the quiet, very regular and mostly closeted lifestyle of the latter.
Family resentments surface, especially regarding the past with Chet having been burdened to care for their dying father alone while Todd was away ""living it up"".  And Todd's continuing promiscuity  has all the prospects of creating social havoc in the small town.
Keen observation of small town life, the differences and similarities between gay siblings (observed as boys as well as adults) and the eventual bonding of the brothers are all well handled by director and co-writer Wade Gasque, always in a touching and believable manner.
Nice performance by fellow co-writer and star Mark Strano as the older brother and a scene stealing one by Frankie Valenti (aka gay porn star Johnny Hazzard), backed up by a sterling supporting cast make this short (76 minutes) film a potent and very satisfying experience.",1451260800,4,1123,5.164835164835165
7132259,5,B00WH762DI,"This was a different gay movie than what I was aspecting, the end result was a lovely feel good film. It is a unique take on the gay brother(s) and family dynamic.",1449705600,2,163,4.125
7132260,3,B00WH762DI,"Both brother's are gay.. One in the closet and the other one out and reckless... The story was a little hard to believed, but the acting somewhat hale it together.. They should of had the actor Dan Futterman played opposite Frankie Valenti. Maybe Mark Strano should of had Jesse Archer played his brother. To me the casting wasn't right or left.",1449360000,,345,4.672131147540983
7132261,5,B00WH762DI,"I have been anticipating this movie since hearing about and anticipation often comes with disappointment when it cannot live up to expectations.

Tiger Orange surpassed my expectations.  For an indie, low budget film, Tiger Orange had few of the telltale indications.  The story was first rate, the acting was first rate.  While this is not they type of film to blow one away with shocking twists or dramatic scenes, the film rewards with simple and honest dialog and acting.",1442102400,4,475,4.974683544303797

7132263,5,B00WH762DI,"WELL worth the purchase. This is a really great movie. The story is just like so many real-life experiences. To be honest, I expected a good movie, but in reality, this is a GREAT movie!!",1439251200,3,187,4.371428571428571
7132264,4,B00WH762DI,"Whether gay or straight, story line was very true to life. One son takes care of parent, the absent  one blows into town with issues to set things right. Drama was real, ending a little simplistic.  Overall I liked it.",1438905600,6,218,4.425

8713391,3,B00WH762DI,"Tiger Orange (2014). Unrated. Running Time: One hour, 16 mins.
Directed by Wade Gasque. Written by Wade Gasque and Mark Strano.

In central California, two teenage brothers are trying to settle down. It is bedtime. Chet (Ty Parker) is all wound-up and dancing and singing in the bedroom and is told by his father from another room to calm down. His brother, Todd (Adrian Delcan), wants to go to sleep. Chet finds a porn magazine of naked guys under Todd's bed. Chet wants to look at it, but Todd yells at him to stop it. Well, the father (Vincent Duvall) comes in and sees the magazine. He scolds Chet and tells him he doesn't want to raise a sissy child.
  Now adults and the father has died, Chet (Mark Strano) runs a hardware store and still lives in his father's log cabin home. He is privately gay. Todd (Frank Valenti) comes back home from living in Los Angeles to visit his brother. Chet lets him live with him.  Todd is very openly gay and aggressive. He is brash, not flamboyant at all.
  Todd likes to sleep and walk around the house naked. Chet has given up on relationships since college and has become closed-up since having to take care of his ill father by himself. But then, he meets Brandon (Gregory Marcel).

I enjoyed the performance of Frank Valenti as ""Todd"" and hope to see him in more films.
Tiger Orange (2014) was too short a film for me and wish there was more story to it. Would like to see a Part 2.",1518307200,,1987,4.594900849858357

8713393,2,B00WH762DI,"How many times has this type of story been filmed? A dysfunctional sibling returns and makes life difficult for a (barely) functional other sibling or siblings. The fact that both are gay men is incidental in a sense. I can't see that this film brought anything new to the genre except for the gay angle. Still, it wasn't so bad that I had to quit watching it before the end. Casting a porn ""actor"" in the second lead was a crap-shoot and it didn't play so well. Porn ""acting"" is pretty different from real acting after all. A nice try, but is misses the mark.",1481760000,,560,4.3428571428571425

8713396,5,B00WH762DI,I felt that the casting was so very well done.  The contrast between the two brothers felt very intense.,1461369600,,104,4.473684210526316
8713397,4,B00WH762DI,"Set in a small town in rural California we meet Chet played by Mark Strano of Out to kill fame. He has just organised his fathers funeral and taken over the reins to run a small hardware store. He lives in what some would call a rural idyll and others would call the sticks.

His brother is Todd played by Franki Valenti (aka Jonny Hazzard of Lair fame and also the intriguingly named Hole Patrol  which I am sure is about an annoying rabbit problem) who is more free spirited and has gone out and immersed himself in the World. Both brothers are gay but have chosen different paths, Chet of service and self denial and Todd of getting his rocks off and taking all the gay world has to offer. He is though a drifter and ends up home where they start to reconnect and explore their past.

Now this is actually a really good little indie effort. Valenti is very believable and plays the likeable rogue perfectly. The direction is spot on from Wade Gasque and the camera work is mostly very good but the scenes that are beautifully framed and shot are let down by wobbly camera action in some of the dialogue scenes  seriously if it looks good and works then stick with it. It is an original story line too and deals with many issues  this is not porn fest though so if that is your thing then best look elsewhere; if you like well acted and thoughtful gay based drama then there is a great film here waiting to be seen.",1459987200,2,1417,4.292134831460674
8713398,5,B00WH762DI,"This is one film that I purchased not because of its story but the fact the Frankie Valenti has a lead part.  As annotated on the front cover ""It's never too late to come home.""  This verbiage sums up the story behind the film in perfection.  NJMJr!
PS  I can watch this film over and over again, and get more out its message each time.  The interaction and competition of these two brothers is a true lesson in humanity and brotherly love!  It is just a great film!  NJMJr!",1459123200,,474,4.258426966292135
