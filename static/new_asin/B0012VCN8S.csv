8247965,5,B0012VCN8S,"Frontier Justice 50 Movie Pack

This collection has fifty movies from the 1930s and 1940s on twelve DVDs. Most are in monochrome. These western movies were popular, they defended small ranchers against the oppression from big landowners. The right to keep and bear arms was well-recognized then. Small movie studios were also threatened by big movie studios with their cartel of theaters. Was it changing tastes or economics that caused their decline? The new westerns changed from property conflicts to personal conflicts. ""High Noon"" was an example of personal conflicts (with a hint of business conflicts). One movie noted how an increase in settlers disadvantaged cattle men since they could no longer graze their cattle on publicly owned range land. This was given to homesteaders, people who would own the land by working and developing it. One of Laura Ingalls Wilder's books went into more detail about their homesteading.

These movies were popular before big corporations began to put small owner-operated stores and farms out of business. One way was to cut off small business owners from distributors. If banks ""red-lined"" small businesses they could not get the loans necessary for running their business. Many of these films were produced by small studios who produced these movies on a low budget. Later they were shown on television during the 1950s to fill up their broadcast schedule, just as older TV shows were recycled in the 1970s and 1980s (or today). These dramas show life and culture as seen by Hollywood and accepted by their customers. Many of the films were edited for television by reducing their running times to about 53 minutes. You can notice the loss of scenes in some of these movies. These western films had very little padding as there is more action than in some longer big studio productions.

This collection has sixteen Roy Rogers' movies (the ""King of the Cowboys""), the most popular and prolific star who acted in a wide range of roles. There are five Gene Autry movies, the best Singing Cowboy. There are three of the ""Three Mesquiteers""; two of: Johnny Mack Brown, Buster Crabbe, James Newill, George O'Brien, the ""Range Busters"", ""Rough Riders"", and Randolph Scott. The formula of the ""Three Mesquiteers"" seems to have inspired copies. You may be interested in ""Cowboy Legends"", ""Western Classics"", and ""Western Legends"". They are 50 movie packs with varying casts but similar messages: those who do right win in the end.

I find it irritating that the producers rename the same old tired films in these sets. It seems that every time I buy one of these 50 movie sets 40 of them were sold in another set that I already have. No matter what they called it and to made it worse they even rename some of the movies.

I doubt if there are very many of you out their who even know who Buster Crabbe or Gene Autry were. I am sure some of you know who Roy Rogers and Dale Evans were. Gabby Hayes and a few more appear in these movies.

Enjoy them!!!",1281744000,,691,3.893617021276596
