This compilation of Willie Nelson performances is a classic example.  There's an introduction by Willie himself, but you almost have to wonder if it wasn't recorded for another collection entirely.  The intro suggests that we're going to start our musical selections with some oldies from his suit-and-tie days (remember them?).  Instead it kicks off with a then-pretty-current version  ""On the Road Again.""  I joked to a friend that he didn't look all that different in the so-called ""suit and tie"" days at all.  A bit later on, however, you do get some vintage era footage of ""Hello Walls"" and ""Crazy,""  clips fans have likely seen before.  There's voiceover narration all the while, and the clips are abbreviated.  Not good.

I realize this is now a rarity--and will be considered by some fans to be a collector's item of sorts--but it really IS only for collectors unless you can get it at a significantly discounted price.  There are a number of great performance moments here, but they are sloppily sequenced and too many are fragmentary.

However you slice it, this 45 minute melange is a kind of slapdash effort and--since it's out of print and available as of this writing only at some outlandishly high prices--it may not be the wisest of purchases.  There are certainly better introduction to Willie Nelson's work out there.  Shop around.

NOTE:  There seems to be some error on this page (for WILLIE NELSON: ON THE ROAD AGAIN), since just about all the reviews here are for Willlie's  1980 dramatic film HONEYSUCKLE ROSE.  The song ""On the Road Again"" was included in that film, and that may explain the confusion, at least in part.  Prospective purchasers of this rather abbreviated music video should take note.  There are many rave reviews for the film below, but they don't have anything to do with this particular VHS product.",1361232000,,2095,4.7292817679558015
