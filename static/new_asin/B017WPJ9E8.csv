7536298,5,B017WPJ9E8,Great movie!!!,1462320000,,14,6.5
7536299,5,B017WPJ9E8,"I was very happy with how they continued the story. I was worried the themes or setting may become diluted in the second chapter and I am very pleased that it continues the story well. It is a much deeper story though it is also more traditional in terms of story, it needs 2 watches to really drink your teeth into. This one also relies on dialogue to move the plot forward more than songs making them seem less important than in the first however they are still very well done. Im really excited to see how this series and other projects unfold, it could be the catalyst of a generation defining culture.",1462147200,,606,4.371681415929204
7536300,5,B017WPJ9E8,Absolutely amazing!! Love this movie! I have all of Terrance's movies and none of them have disappointed me yet! As soon as I saw there was a preorder for this I jumped on it. I would've liked a bit more side merch but the film was aces and really what more can you ask for?,1462147200,,274,4.0
7536301,4,B017WPJ9E8,"The songs weren't as good as the first one but they still had some really good songs. The story was a lot bigger, though and a lot of fun. I'd definitely recommend it to my friends.",1462147200,2,181,4.055555555555555
7536302,5,B017WPJ9E8,"Love it, Love it, Love it!!!!!!!",1461888000,,32,4.5
7536303,3,B017WPJ9E8,"I bought it early because I thought the side merch, not the DVD, was going to be super rad to add to my collection. It wasn't. It's like the booklet you get in a CD :/ it came fine I just wanted more.",1461888000,6,200,3.6744186046511627
7536304,5,B017WPJ9E8,I am a huge fan of all the Terrance Zdunich productions.  Alleuluia is no exception.  I was fortunate to see the traveling show a few months ago and it was awesome.  I was very excited to buy the DVD when it came out.  If you saw Repo or the first Devil's Carnival than you know what you are in for and will enjoy this new musical.  If you have no idea what Repo The Genetic Opera is or the first Devil's than I recommend you look in to those in addition to this.  All 3 are fantastic unique movie/musical productions.  I can't wait for the next thing they create.,1461888000,,564,4.1192660550458715
7536305,5,B017WPJ9E8,Just as good as the sequel!! Maybe even better. I can't wait for the next episode!!!,1460332800,,84,4.3125
7536306,5,B017WPJ9E8,"An amazing film that continues the narrative of Lucifer and Hell against the might of a tyrannical Heaven. The movie is amazingly colorful and the cinematography is gorgeous. The best part of this movie is the music, each song is impact full and hauntingly beautiful in their own way. If you are a fan of the original, repo the genetic opera, or the weird or macabre but this film.",1460246400,,381,4.536231884057971
7536307,5,B017WPJ9E8,"One of my favorite movies I've seen. It's so creative and different. The special edition is worth it. It has a Blu Ray, DVD, and song lyric booklet. I love it!!!",1458691200,2,161,4.225806451612903
7536308,2,B017WPJ9E8,"I was under the impression I was going to receive everything in the picture.... After reading the description I understood that what I did pay for was accurate, so that was my bad. Picture is misleading would be my only complaint.",1502928000,,230,4.634146341463414
7536309,5,B017WPJ9E8,"Awesome as always, can't wait for part 3.",1501027200,,41,4.25
7536310,5,B017WPJ9E8,"Case came factory sealed inside of a tiny, soft drawstring bag with the logo printed on it. Included not only Blu-Ray disc and DVD, but a songbook with lyrics and a small piece of cardstock stating that this is certified to be a special edition.",1498780800,,245,4.466666666666667
7536311,4,B017WPJ9E8,"Firstly, this movie is fantastic. It is one of my favorites, along with the first installment and Repo! the Genetic Opera by the same people. The DVD and Blu-Ray work well, but my only complaint is that this did not come with the cute little bag shown in the picture. I only received the DVD container within my bubble-wrapped Amazon package.",1498608000,,342,4.622950819672131
7536312,3,B017WPJ9E8,"I loved the first Devils Carnival, but this one is so much different and not nearly as entetaining in both storyline and song. Many of the songs feel like they were store in a rush and not well thought out.

Like I said, I am a huge fan and admirer of the first movie. I also loved Repo Genetic Opera, but Alleluia, even with its great cast, has a hard time captivating and keeping my interest.
I was disapointed but understand not everyone can make a great movie every time. Even Steven Spielberg, Francis Coppala,  and John Huston had their flops.

This is just my opinion.

Btw,  my came with bag and inserts, but like others stated, not numbered. Just a sticker on the cellophane wrapper saying limited edition, one of 6,660 made.
Which really won't matter as I seriously this will be a collotors item like the first movie.",1498348800,,827,4.486666666666666
7536313,3,B017WPJ9E8,"I came earlier than expected with was good and came with the booklet and both dvds, but did not come other the bag, witch a lot of people who buy it from amazon say it doesn't come with even though it's advorticed with it. Still recommend you buy it though.",1494028800,,257,4.16
7536314,5,B017WPJ9E8,I love this DVD/Blu-Ray so much. Just finished it and i can honestly say I can't wait for more like this,1492128000,,104,4.0
7536315,1,B017WPJ9E8,"First off, it didn't come with the bag. The movie itself was disappointing. I am a huge fan of Repo! The Genetic Opera. I saw some clips of The Devil's Carnival online and thought it might be entertaining. I was wrong. This movie just dragged on and on. It had a predictable story, which would have been okay if it had more than just a hand full of songs in it. And that's the most disappointing part. It seemed like there were just a few songs in this musical. I have never been a fan of musicals until I watched Repo! The Genetic Opera. Terrance Zdunich has an amazing talent for song writing. I know part of my disappointment is from nostalgia, expecting it to somehow be like Repo, but all bias aside this movie was just bad.",1491782400,,729,4.2898550724637685
7536316,3,B017WPJ9E8,"Great movie, I love the series so far, but this set disappointed me - I got the Blu Ray, the DVD, the lyric book, and the ""certificate of authenticity"" - but I did not receive the microfiber bag that was supposed to be included. For $22, I'll buy it again, and hopefully get the bag this time.",1490918400,2,293,4.157894736842105

7536318,5,B017WPJ9E8,"My husband and I are big fans of Terrance Zdunich, and we always look forward to his films and soundtracks. This was well worth it.",1490227200,,131,4.28
7536319,5,B017WPJ9E8,"Greatness, but so are all of this guy's movies.",1490054400,,47,4.333333333333333
7536320,5,B017WPJ9E8,"A worthy successor to the first movie. Just based on the music, I didn't have much hope, I was wrong",1489276800,,100,4.05
7536321,5,B017WPJ9E8,"Such a campy movie, but so fun.  Certainly not for everyone, but if you like this sort of rock movie musical (think Rocky Horror Picture Show) you'll enjoy this.",1489104000,,161,4.551724137931035
7536322,5,B017WPJ9E8,love the booklet and this is a quick favorite movie of mine.  Hitting on All Sevens is my favorite.,1487376000,,99,4.2105263157894735
7536323,5,B017WPJ9E8,If you loved the first Devil's Carnival then your gonna love Alleluia. I feel like this one had more of a story to it and the songs in Alleluia were amazing!,1485561600,,157,4.096774193548387
7536324,4,B017WPJ9E8,4 stars because the bag is smaller than pictured and DVD wasn't numbered,1484265600,,72,4.615384615384615
7536325,5,B017WPJ9E8,"I love this movie! A perfect sequel to the first and totally worth the price! Came with everything it says. There were no flaws. If you don't have it yet, get it!",1484179200,,162,4.09375
7536326,5,B017WPJ9E8,Excellent,1482710400,,9,9.0
7536327,2,B017WPJ9E8,"A great movie, a great special edition set, but the bag was ruined by the sticker placed on it during packaging. The white label was placed on the fabric of the bag, leaving a permanent light-coloured stain on the graphic of the clown/devil/angel. The bag was why we bought this, since we already owned the DVD version.",1482019200,,319,4.614035087719298
7536328,5,B017WPJ9E8,Love this movie and the first movie. Comes with a nice looking bag.,1476576000,,67,4.230769230769231

7536331,5,B017WPJ9E8,"This movie is amazing! But I was very disappointed that I didn't get the bag it's supposed to come with and after reading the reviews, it looks like a lot of people didn't get the bag.",1469232000,,184,4.138888888888889
7536332,5,B017WPJ9E8,"Loved this movie! I was a fan of the first, but this was great! The lyric book, bag, and authenticity card were neat little additions.",1469232000,,134,4.4
7536333,1,B017WPJ9E8,"Very good movie but not as advertised. The bag does not come with the movie, or at least I did not receive it. The movie deserves four stars but the product does not.",1469059200,3,166,4.0606060606060606
7536334,5,B017WPJ9E8,"I was a big fan of repo (wish there was a second but whatever) and I was not disappointed with devil's carnival, Emelie Autumn (Painted Doll) had an awesome performance and it is deffinetley worth watching",1468368000,,205,4.722222222222222
7536335,3,B017WPJ9E8,"I liked this movie due to the fact that it is a continuation to the trilogy, however I wasn't as impressed with the musical numbers this time as I was with the first Devil's Carnival. It reminded me of a twisted Panem that constantly broke out in music.",1468281600,,253,4.291666666666667
7536336,1,B017WPJ9E8,"What a horrible incomplete piece of work, just rambling and disconnected, loved part one but this is just pointless nonsense, won't waste anymore money on mr terrance again, he blew it!",1467849600,,185,5.0
7536337,5,B017WPJ9E8,love it,1467417600,,7,3.0
7536338,4,B017WPJ9E8,"I wish i could give half stars, because it'd be 4/12. it arrived on time and everything, but being a limited edition print I was a little more over protective than normal and noticed a rip in the box art on the bottom while it was still sealed. I decided to keep it  because they were numbered copies and I didn't want another fan to be disappointed. Overall great product, played great, but normally I would have exchanged for a new copy.",1465776000,,439,4.353658536585366
7536339,5,B017WPJ9E8,"An amazing sequel to 2012's The Devil's Carnival. For fans of Repo! The Genetic Opera comes another dark and fantastically cast musical. So well written is will have you humming it after the movies and bursting into it's many songs throughout daily life! Terrance (who is co-creater and played Grave Robber in Repo!) is Lucifer. He is tired of his rule in Hell and yearns to bring down Heaven with their overly proud leader God. In this second installment you get to see more of heaven, the inner workings, the ""angels"", and God's right hand man.

This Blu-ray edition (only 6660 made!) is chalked full of great special features and comes in a collectible bag that you can't get anywhere else.",1465689600,,693,4.7272727272727275
7536340,3,B017WPJ9E8,Was hoping it was going to be similar to the 1st.,1465084800,,49,3.5454545454545454

7536347,5,B017WPJ9E8,I am such a fan of Terrance Zdunich. Loved it!,1462406400,,46,3.7
8740888,5,B017WPJ9E8,"I loved the first Devils Carnival so I bought the sequel. This comes in a cute little bag to house the Dvd. The movie was pretty good though not as awesome as the first film. Most of the film takes place in heaven, instead of the carnival. There is also a lot more talking in this movie. The first one was almost entirely singing. This one was longer and the lighting was done a lot brighter. It no longer had that creepy atmosphere. Heaven was all bright and glitzy and I missed the dark and mysterious carnival setting. Once the film gets the carnival parts it really comes alive. Terrance Zdunich makes the best devil.

I did like that most of the cast returned for this. There were some new actors in here like Adam Pascal (rent), the butcher babies, Bea Grant, Ted Nealy (Jesus Christ Superstar), Barry Bostwick, and lots more.",1534464000,,832,4.473684210526316

8740890,2,B017WPJ9E8,Didnt receive pouch that is supposed to be included. Very disappointed. Absolutley not worth the price for what you get. Super glad I bought it on sale.,1532649600,,152,4.666666666666667

8740893,5,B017WPJ9E8,I love this so much. Came in perfect condition and I cannot stop watching it. I really hope to see the third part one day but I will never regret buying this amazing movie. Terrance Zdunich is such a talented performer and had me mesmerized by each and every note. I wish I could have seen it live. Everyone needs to see this movie if you loved the first one you will love this one.,1523750400,,382,4.1066666666666665

8740896,5,B017WPJ9E8,"This movie, like all of Bousman and Zdunichs films, is absolutely amazing. The cinematography, acting, design, story, everything makes this a very unique and incredible film. Its very eccentric and different but it certainly delivers in its message. I highly recommend to anyone who will listen and likes off-the-wall musical genius movies, not only Alleluia! The Devils Carnival but also Repo! The Genetic Opera and the first Devils Carnival.",1515456000,,443,5.434782608695652
