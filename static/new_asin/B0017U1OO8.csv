in planets. and this book filled the bill. he had his mom read to him and he learned the planets
by heart. thanks",1485907200,2,203,4.1
8267271,5,B0017U1OO8,"the pictures are fantastic - the sun, the planets and their moons...... this is actually the second time I have purchased this DVD. Our first one was scratched from watching it so often and I was very relieved to see it was still available.",1478908800,3,240,4.4772727272727275

8267273,2,B0017U1OO8,"This video is very informative, but I'm having middle school flashbacks watching it. The cover says it was produced in 2007, but it looks more like it was made in 1990. Dated graphics, a patronizing narrator, and a boring robot spaceship driver made me feel as if I were sitting in a classroom, and not interested. This could have been SOO much better! I found more interesting videos with better graphics on you tube, which were free. My 5 year old seemed mildly interested, but much of it wasn't clear for a child just starting to learn about space. It did not start out explaining the structure of the solar system. It started with the sun, and within that topic, solar eclipses. This made absolutely no sense to a child who doesn't yet understand about planets rotating around the sun. The video would be more appropriate for a 9 or 10 year old, but the childish characters and voice of the narrator are geared towards 3 year olds. Not at all what I expected.",1351209600,6,963,4.540229885057471
8267274,4,B0017U1OO8,"I got this DVD for my son when he was 6 years old when he started showing an interest in the solar system and outer space in general.  It's a good DVD, but it could have been better; needed to be longer with more info, along with more engaging and professionally done.",1327104000,,268,4.153846153846154
8267275,5,B0017U1OO8,Our five year old was fascinated with this DVD - we have watched pieces of it many times.  And our three year old also enjoys it though with less understanding.  Actually the adults in the household also found it very interesting so I'm sure it is good for much older kids.  Highly recommended.,1305763200,7,294,4.509433962264151
8267276,4,B0017U1OO8,We really enjoyed this DVD but found it is very evolutionary. It talks about it all being billions of years ago. Each time the narator talked about it's inception billions of years ago it gave us the opportunity the share our beliefs of divine intervention. I would recommend it BUT with a parent watching.,1261612800,10,306,4.685185185185185
