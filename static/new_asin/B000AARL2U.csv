8077699,5,B000AARL2U,"With the exception of the third episode (where the action was minimal) all of the episodes are packed end to end with the same action seen in the first volume, making this volume one of the better ones in this series.

8077701,4,B000AARL2U,"After the fourth volume of Burst Angel, I had lost a lot of a hope in a series that had started out so well. That volume kind of stole the integrity away from a series that was already too close to losing it as it was. It was a shameless attempt to hold a viewer's attention with fan-service while the creators struggled to with new stories.

Volume five gets away from that, though, and even gets back to its roots with three episodes filled with great action. In the first episode on this volume (a continuation of the last volume) Jo continues her battle with a giant robot much like her Jango with the help of a silent samurai. She ends up discovering the robot is piloted by a woman very much like her, with her same tattoos. The second episode is one more about Kyohei than any of the girls, as he is reunited with one of her old classmates who just happens to be a cyberoid (Robocop). The third and fourth episodes reintroduce the very forgettable Takane, the first being about mysterious waves that come from our favorite form of entertainment, the TV, capable of controlling the minds of people, while the second brings RAPT back with a new traffic control cybot that has for some reason targeted Takane.

With the exception of the third episode (where the action was minimal) all of the episodes are packed end to end with the same action seen in the first volume, making this volume one of the better ones in this series. Pick this volume up if you're been collecting Burst Angel.",1137456000,5,1491,4.477941176470588
