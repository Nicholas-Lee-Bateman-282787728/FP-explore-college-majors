7842979,5,6303271219,"The gorgeous Shannon Whirry keeps the heat turned up in this one as a mysterious lady involved with cop Michael Nouri and maybe involved in some murders.  Ms. Whirry is sometimes the sole reason to watch a movie but  this time she is in a pretty darn good movie.  Good characters and plot  with some actual suspense and mystery.  Still, Shannon Whirry is worth the  price of admission all on her own.  She's all that and a bag of chips!  Check her out in this hot erotic thriller and see why Joe Bob and I think  she's the true Queen of this genre.",952732800,16,548,4.242718446601942
