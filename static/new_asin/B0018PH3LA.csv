3418342,5,B0018PH3LA,"I really liked this film. I thought it brought exactly what I expected, mean sorority girls and brainless humor, all wrapped up in a pink package called Legacy. I think some people on here took this film way to seriously, in no way was it supposed to be a moving, life changing piece of cinema, and I thought the writing was a fairly accurate depiction of sorority life yet also highly exaggerated. The whole film is an exaggeration...including the blond wig. To me it seems its on purpose, in fact I think Hailey's character even makes a comment about her hair falling out. If you are headed to blockbuster and want to laugh and be entertained, this is the movie for you. To me its what happens when Heathers meets Super Bad.",1256428800,5,726,4.507575757575758

3418344,1,B0018PH3LA,"This movie is problably one of the worst I've ever had to sit through. Nothing about this movie is funny, it is full of vulgarities and unlikeable characters. It was painful to sit through. I'm just stunned how bad this was. I was hoping that a masked killer would show up and start disposing of the useless teenage brats like in Halloween or Friday the 13th, then maybe there would have been something to laugh at, in this dreadful waste of a movie. You would have to be brain dead to find this movie remotely good. I bought this dvd as a gift, based on the positive reviews on here. Ooops!",1247443200,4,591,4.333333333333333

3418346,5,B0018PH3LA,"Having seen Paris Hilton's ""Pledge This"", the bar for a sorority film was pretty low.  The casting is dead on, the over-the-top acting and situations are hysterical and to me this is when Heathers meets Clue in a sorority house. Phenomenal ending. Very funny Tom Green role as a detective and I'm not even a fan of his.  Highly recommended for guilty pleasure only.",1220745600,6,365,4.6875

8270546,3,B0018PH3LA,The movie was sort of boring in places and overbearing with the sorority girl image at times.  I am in a sorority and it is absolutely NOTHING like this movie.  And the fact that someone dies right in the beginning because she doesn't look like a model is really messed up.,1354752000,,273,4.333333333333333

8270548,5,B0018PH3LA,Haylie Duff again amazes the audience with a truly masterful performance. she shows us why she has the determination and the talent to become one of Hollywood's finest actresses!,1275264000,4,178,5.172413793103448
8270549,5,B0018PH3LA,"I thought this movie was pretty good i like the story and most of the acting was well done.

my favorite character was Nina played by ""Margo Harshman"" Nina is a seemingly normal person who appears off and on throughout the movie she is taken advantage of by the other characters having to do all the chores around the house and even the others school work for them. eventually it drives here insane.

this is the first time Margo has played a villain and she gives a awesome performance in this movie and really creepy towards the end of the film. she is a very talented actress and i highly recommend this movie.",1274572800,,613,4.415929203539823
