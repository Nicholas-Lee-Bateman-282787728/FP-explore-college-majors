2263809,5,B00094AQZG,"I have been a fan of Monk since the series initial start.  I own the first season on DVD and I plan to purchase seasons two and three. I am also a huge fan of Bitty Schram and the dynamics that she brought out in her character Sharona.  Season three is compiled of the last episodes with Bitty Schram and the introduction of replacement for Schram with Traylor Howard.  I suggest that if you have seen an episode with Bitty Schram you should watch seasons one and two before seeing the new episodes with Traylor Howard.  I am very dissapointed with the departure of Schram and the new turn of the series.  I am although a devoted fan of Tony Shalhoub and Monk.  Some of the crafty writing and strong character relationships that helped to develop the show have slipped with the departure of Schram.  I continue to watch the series and hope the character chemistry and strong storylines will be revived or perhaps Schram will be invited back.  I must also give praise to other characters that help carry the show.  Captain Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) and Lieutenent Randall Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford) are brilliantly cast and bring a realization to the ""Defective Detective"" that made the first two and a half seasons worth watching.",1118620800,33,1232,4.719626168224299
2263810,3,B00094AQZG,"Ignore all the overzealous praise of the show's third season, while it is enjoyable and worth a buy for fans of the series, next to the other boxed sets of the show this one pales in comparison and will not serve as the best way to get someone hooked on Monk.

Monk's third season is most noted for the unexpected and controversial firing of Bitty Schram and the hiring of almost carbon-copy Traylor Howard for the second half of the season.  Without even a goodbye Sharona was remarried and shipped across America offscreen.

But I get ahead of myself.

The season opened strongly enough with Monk, Sharona, Stottlemyer and, oddly enough, Randall all following a lead from the previous season to New York City, where, unsurprisingly, Monk had one of his trademark meltdowns.

The rest of the first half of the third season had all the hallmarks of the first and second seasons: the random celebrity casting, the unbelievable explanations and Monk's continual grappling with his condition.  However, because of the show's appeal to younger viewers many of the mysteries were dumbed-down and made more childish to bring in younger and younger viewers.  The most notable example of this was in Mr. Monk and the Panic Room, which featured a possible killer monkey, a nice message for the kids wrapped up with a big bow, and and Stottlemyer literally acting like a crazy person in order to get a monkey to shoot a gun.

The first nine episodes did have many high points, however.  Mr. Monk and the Blackout is probably the best episode of the season, finding the perfect mix between past Monk episodes and new Monk moments.  Also of note is the excellent performance of Bitty Schram in Mr. Monk and the Girl Who Cried Wolf, which deserves an emmy nod.

There was one moment that foreshadowed the upheval to come, Mr. Monk and the Gameshow, which featured none of the regulars save Shalhoub and was produced specifically to show cast members that they were expendable.

The first ""season"" of the two part season closed on USA, with everything seemingly fine in Monk-land.  The episodes were becoming more adult again, and Shalhoub's chemistry with Schram never better.

Then, in a still mysterious chain of events, the episode count for the second half was cut from 9 to 7, Schram was fired and new characters were to be introduced that were almost identical to Sharona and her son.

Monk's new girl Friday was named Natalie Teeger, and was to be played by Traylor Hackford, late of Two Guys, A Girl and a Pizza Place.  Reception for the changes was harsh to say the least, and I find myself concuring that the producers should have payed Schram whatever she wanted to stay on the series, because the character of Natalie pales in comparison.

That isn't to say the character didn't show potential.  Hackford's debut episode, Mr. Monk and the Red Herring, is a crackerjack romp with many character building moments and an acceptable, if not believeable, sendoff to Sharona.  Hackford showcased some real chemistry with Shalhoub, and her character showcased a chance of becoming something other than a Sharona-knockoff.

But as the remainder of the season progressed it became clear that none of that potential would be acted upon.  It became obvious that the scripts were written for Sharona and Natalie was just thrown into the script as a replacement without much thought.  Hackford is a great actress, and you can see her trying in these later episodes, but to no avail.  The character becomes annoying and grating.

The mysteries do the same.  A budget increase was obvious, with big action sequences happening in almost every episode (most notably Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever and Mr. Monk Gets Caught In Traffic) and less attention paid to the mysteries, often making them eith so obvious or so outlandish they were laughable.

Shalhoub still provides the emotional drive and the center of the series, and doesn't overact or miss a beat no matter how stupid or unintentionally funny the situation.

Therefore, I recommend this box set for Monk fans.  The series took a big dip in quality near the end, but the Sharona episodes are a gentle reminder of great things past, and the first Natalie episodes showcases a potential never acted upon.",1117929600,265,4239,4.841886269070735
2263811,5,B00094AQZG,"I first started watching Monk when the second season aired on TV, and from the first few minutes of the episode I was watching I could already tell that this was a show I was going to be watching for a long time!  I've never laughed more in my life.  Season three was even more fun than the first two.  It's true that this is the season where Bitty Schram's character Sharona leaves the show; while sad it hardly makes a difference.  Her replacement Traylor Howard, who plays Natalie Teeger, is not as comical a character as Sharona Fleming, but it is a minor thing.  The true focus of the show is Tony Shalhoub and his hilarious portrayal of Adrian Monk.  I myself suffered from a minor case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and while it was not as extreme as Monk's case I can still relate to the character in a way.  I have trouble understanding why people don't like this season as much as they do the others.  I suppose it would have to be that they disagree with my opinion about Bitty Schram's character.  I will admit she was a much more humorous character then Natalie Teeger's character, but my true appreciation for the show is Tony Shalhoub.  Bitty Schram, in my opinion, got too greedy.  She wanted more money and the show refused to pay more.  I will admit I was a little disappointed, but only a little. It seems that Schram's character was important to other fans of the show.  I also heard some exclaim that they were disappointed with the last episode in this season ""Mr. Monk and the Kid,"" which was something I could not understand at all.  As far as I'm concerned it was the best episode in the series.  Monk temporarily adopts a toddler of about 2 or 3 years and then in the end is forced to give him up.  It was so sad, but it was a great episode nevertheless.  I heard others say that they wanted the last episode to have something to do with Trudy's murder (Trudy is the departed wife of Adrian Monk).  They already did that on the last episode of Season 2 and frankly it would have been boring and redundant to do it again.  In summation if you want this season to be like the other two seasons then it is likely you won't enjoy Season 3, but if you are like me and you want to see ""Monk"" in a different way then I definitely recommend buying this.

Here is a list of the Episodes From Season 3:

02)Mr. Monk and the Panic Room
03)Mr. Monk and the Blackout
04)Mr. Monk Gets Fired

I bought this season while it was on sale for $5. I love Monk and I am so happy I found a high quality streaming option.

2264396,5,B00094AQZG,"I'm still falling in love with this wonderful show.  And this season sure carried that theme through for me.  In episode three Monk gets about as close to falling in love again as we've seen him when he meets Alicia Coppola wearing a hard hat no less.  And I got about as close as these old bones can manage when episode 10 arrived and we were all introduced to Traylor Howard as Monk's new assistant, Natalie Teeger.  What a cutie!  I just want to wrap her up and take her home and....uh, I'd better stop right there.  This is a family show, after all.  But her cuteness aside she really does provide a fresh new approach to 'handling Monk' and the interaction between her and Shaloub on screen is just as 'right' and entertaining as was the chemistry between him and Bitty Schram.  Best of Season honors, though, has to go to the finale, The Kid.  Keep the tissues handy when you watch.  Heartwarming.

I have one problem with this season...the crappy packaging.  Discs stacked atop each other!  What's with that?  Fortunately I'm almost as fussy a Monk and I was ready with slim jewel cases and a label program, so there!",1416441600,,1124,4.5

2264454,5,B00094AQZG,"The first time I saw a Monk episode I did not think much of the show. I didn't pay much attention to it because I was busy cooking. The second time I watch an episode was at a friends house and both my wife and I fell in love with the characters. There is a little Monk in all of us. While I am sure he would drive me out of my mind if I lived with him, he is lovable in spite of all his quirks. The show has everything, it is both a great detective story and a comedy. It has no gratuitous violence or sex in it which is refreshing in this day and age. Besides Monk, my two favorite characters are Stottlemeir and Natalie. Their relationship with Monk is as opposite as night and day. While Stottlemeir gets extremely impatient with Monk, he is understanding of the man; and Natalie, who has infinite patience, sometime just lays down the law and Monk accepts it. Their interdependence is most obvious even when they are at odds.  The show is refreshing and I always feel better after watching it.

While there are re-runs of the program, I have been buying the Season DVDs because I want to be sure that I can always watch an episode of Monk.",1389830400,,1144,4.195454545454545

2264471,5,B00094AQZG,"Purchased directly from Amazon.

Recently, I went through and purchased every season of Monk. So worth it.

However, even I'll admit that season three has the the weakest episodes of the entire Monk series, notably because of the behind-the-scenes issues (actors, producers, network).

Season three is also, sadly, where Sharona departs mid-season (ah, darn.), and we have to adjust to Natalie. I admit, it took me a few seasons to get used to her. To this day, if I happen upon a Monk conversation with a stranger, they always say something about how it was too bad that the character of Sharona was cut.

It's still worth purchasing if you're completing your collection, or buying some seasons as a gift for a Monk fan, or a fan of the murder-mystery genre.",1383955200,4,759,4.770992366412214
2264472,5,B00094AQZG,"USA Network has a long and rich history of quality programming, but the cable network hit the jackpot and entered a new era when it introduced Adrian Monk to the world in 2002.

Mr. Monk is attempting to navigate through the unspeakable tragedy of the horrific death of his beloved wife, Trudy. The phobias he experienced as a young man growing up in San Francisco seemed to be under control thanks to his remarkable spouse, but suddenly bubbled back to the surface and completely overtook his life that December 1997 day, so much so that his best friend, Captain Leland Stottlemeyer, was forced to discharge Monk from the SFPD.

Season three marks a pivotal turning point for Monk after his loyal nurse and assistant, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram) returned to her native New Jersey. Not only was Monk's universe about to collapse inward upon him, the show was on the ledge as well.

Enter Natalie Teeger. Ms. Teeger, a military widow who is mother to brilliant 12-year old Julie, stops a home invasion by stabbing the intruder with a pair of scissors. Monk is then hired by Captain Stottlemeyer to clear Natalie of any criminal wrongdoing. During the course of the investigation, Natalie and Julie become fascinated with the ""defective detective"", and the Teegers are even more awed when Mr. Monk saves Julie's goldfish at the expense of a very valuable moon rock during a science fair.

Traylor Howard's arrival not only saved Monk, but it sent the show soaring to new heights. If you haven't watched Monk yet, watch season three. You'll soon want to watch the other seven seasons.",1383868800,4,1584,4.833948339483395

The last appearance of Bitty Schram!",1230249600,,254,4.795454545454546
2264651,5,B00094AQZG,"Detective Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) is back on the case for one of the very best seasons this series has seen.  At his side, as usual, are his brassy and long-suffering assistant, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram), by-the-book Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine), the always eager-to-please Lieutenant Randy Disher (Jason-Gray Stanford), and his new assistant, Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard).  They have their work cut out for them as they take on some very bold cases.

Every season opener for Monk has been strong and this one is no exception.  This one picks up right where Season 2 left off, as Monk and comapny arrive in New York City to follow a hot lead on the death of Monk's late wife, Trudy.  Before he can speak with the man who planted the bomb, Adrian must first figure out who killed a foriegn ambassador.  Adrian's days with Sharona at his side are numbered, but his last handful of cases with her are very exciting, involving all kinds of topics, such as a possibly murderous chimpanzee, another possibility of Monk's reinstatement, and Sharona questioning her own sanity.  At the midpoint of Season 3, Sharona takes Benjy and they move back to New Jersey so she can remarry her former ex, Trevor.  Monk's search for a new assistant leads him to meet Natalie Teeger, an attractive, widowed single mom who has recently been the victim of a burgarly.  Adrian's success in solving the case leads to Natalie volunteering to become Monk's new assistant.  Her first cases with Monk are just as exciting as Sharona's last.

A lot of people probably view this season to be perfect for discussing the classic Natalie vs. Sharona debate, so here's my input.  I like Natalie better.  She is very nututring to Monk and has far more patience for his obsessive-compulsive tendencies.  She can very much relate to the pain Monk goes through sometimes, as she too lost a spouse to a violent death.  In case you do not know, Sharona was written out of the show because Bitty Schram was fired, due to disputes involving money and creative differences.  I think the people behind the show did an excellent job casting Traylor Howard to play Natalie.  She is an attractive actress with a bright future.  It is nice that now Monk has an assistant who gives him more respsonsibility.  The rest of the cast is beyond superb, too (as they always are).  This season was awesome because in addtion to getting a taste of both assistants, you also get a unique roster of guest stars and excellent stories.  All Monk fans must have Season 3 in their collection.  For those new to the show, this is the best place to start if you can't get your hands on episodes from Seasons 1 or 2 right away.  In the end, you can decide which assistant you like better.  Here are all 16 episodes in this season with a brief synopsis:

1. Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan: Before Monk can follow a hot lead on his wife's death, while in New York City, he must first figure out who killed a foreign ambassador.

2. Mr. Monk and the Panic Room: Monk must decide wether or not a chimpanzee is guilty in the murder of a big shot record producer.  Carmen Electra guest stars.

3. Mr. Monk and the Blackout:  Monk must uncover the truth behind a series of unexpected blackouts in San Francisco.  Judge Reinhold guest stars.

4. Mr. Monk Gets Fired: Monk is determined to solve a grisly murder, even after having his private practice license pulled by the grouchy new commissioner.  Glenne Headly reprises her role as Sttolemyer's wife, Karen.

5. Mr. Monk Meets the Godfather: If he can sucsessfully infiltrate a mafia family to get the truth behind an apparent mob hit, Monk just may be reinstated into the SFPD!  Phillip Baker Hall guest stars.

6. Mr. Monk and the Girl Who Cried Wolf:  Sharona is on the brink of a nervous breakdown after a series of events lead her to question her own sanity.  Niecy Nash guest stars.

7. Mr. Monk and the Employee of the Month:  Monk's last partner on the force, now a security guard at a local department store, needs his help in getting to the bottom of the murder of an employee.  Enrinco Calantoni guest stars.

8. Mr. Monk and the Game Show: Trudy's father entices Monk to come with him to Los Angeles to solve a murder involved with a game show.  Jarrad Paul guest stars.

9. Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine: Monk's new anti-OCD medicine transforms him into an ego-maniac with very bad detective skills.  This is Bitty Schram's last episode as Sharona Flemming.  Melora Hardin guest stars.

10. Mr. Monk and the Red Herring: Traylor Howard's first episode as Natalie Teeger.  Single mom Natalie Teeger turns to Monk to figure out why someone would want to steal an ordinary pet fish.  Monk gets a new assitstant out of the investigation.

13. Mr. Monk Gets Stuck in Traffic:  Monk is stuck in a traffic jam with Natalie and her dauhter (Emmy Clarke), and finds that a murder is the cause of it.  Special appearance by Korn and Larry Miller guest stars.

2264653,4,B00094AQZG,"I'm not sure why Bitty Schram was let go from this show, but her absence is very noticeable.  Traylor Howard does all right and becomes a bit more likeable by the end of this season, but so far she doesn't quite measure up.

Aside from that, the main cast members continue to do fine work.  Shalhoub hits every note, tugging at the viewers' heartstrings as he clutches a pillow and imagines Trudy; tries medication for his OCDs but finds that they hamper his detection skills; and especially at the end of this season, when he wants to adopt a toddler but realizes that he can barely care for himself, never mind a child.

Levine and Gray-Stanford discover more layers of their characters as well.  I look forward to a fourth season and more Monk!!",1213228800,2,748,4.552238805970149
2264654,5,B00094AQZG,"Monk's 3rd season show the character to be just as fresh and interesting as the previous ones. Although I hated to see Bitty Schram leave the series, I have to admit Traylor was a welcome addition. It is interesting that the Monk books are written in the 1st person by her character, Natalie. I know people who like watching the show will enjoy the books as well. Well, Sharona is in the 1st nine episodes which makes this season a must for Monk fans. The funny thing about Monk is how when you watch him you can see a bit of yourself. We all have little quirks and obsessions just not so pronounced. Here's the thing, buy it. You'll thank me for it later. RLJ",1212624000,,660,4.288
2264655,5,B00094AQZG,"I here alot about people disliking the sherona dismissal and to be honest I loved it.

Sherona was probaly a really good nurse to monk but, not sure she was ever going to be a great assitant. simply put she babied him too much and he was never able to grow. In a sense I think eventually they would had either change sherona character somewhat in season 4 or get rid of her all togehter. I mean it got to the point where not only was she taking care of him with all his phobias but, he felt like his protector as well.

Natalie was totally different. She treated him like a man with probelms...instead of a little kid with probelms. However she is also a lot sweeter then sherona.

Just to get to the episodes themsleves. Best episode easily is mr monk and the cobra. Truthfully didn't have that much hope for it but, got a Trudy clip at the end. IMO that episode alone is worth buying the boxset as it one of the sweetest moments in the show.

we mr monk and the game show where it is a good mystery and we also get to meet trudy's parents and get to see some early monk. Mr. monk takes his medicine is also a very good episode. Finally as well the season finale was very touching. Mr monk and the kid. A very emotinal story when monk has to take care of a kid. I was very impressed by this episode.

The whole season was very strong in general and definately worth buying.",1211500800,2,1374,4.150375939849624

2264690,2,B00094AQZG,"Monk is an addiction.  He is the character that we wish we could turn off, but instead find ourselves watching from beginning to end because, while the episodes are formulaic, Adrian Monk is appealing.  He has troubles, like you or I, and isn't afraid to let them do what he loves.  He loves his job as well as his late wife Trudy.  Throughout the first two seasons, we had the opportunity to develop these bonds.  We had to chance to welcome Adrian into our homes with all of his problems and embrace him for the kind, sensitive detective that he is.  He brought laughter by his side, he brought criminals to justice, and he would be utterly frightened, but would be happy to take a bullet for any of his friends - like Stottlemeyer or Sharona.  ""Monk"" was a television show that worked because of the simplicity of the story along with the themes.  It wasn't as disgusting or dark as ""C.S.I."", but we didn't want it to be - we wanted our Adrian and friends to continue what they were doing through season three, hoping to develop more about what a happened with his wife, but instead ... DISASTER STRUCK.

We all know the saying, ""Don't change horses mid-race"", well (and I am probably not the first to attest to this using any forum), the television series ""Monk"" did, and subsequently lost a devoted viewer along the way.  Should I use the term ""spoiler"" with this?  I am not sure, but I must warn those just now getting into the series that Sharona Fleming disappears midway through this season.  There I said it.  Don't shoot me, you probably already know this, but it destroyed the chances for season four to make it to my player for at least three months.  I need time to cope with this loss.  That truth is, what upsets me the most, is that we lost Sharona and was replaced by someone who doesn't know Adrian Monk.  She doesn't respect the man that was presented to us for two whole seasons.  From the beginning of our introduction to Ms. Natalie Teeger, she tries her hardest to change Mr. Monk.  This isn't bad, we all realize that he is ready for anything, but the actress's portrayal comes across as bitter, nagging, and almost to the point of violent.  She does not work with Mr. Monk like Sharona did, but instead battles him on every decision made in which the writers feebly attempt to define this as humor.  This is a defining season for me because I feel like I lost a friend, and not one that could be easily replaced, but was wiped out without a chance of saying goodbye.  It was pathetic, and it hurt.

They changed the theme music (yet the quirkiness of the show is that you can continually hear it in the background whenever needed to bring us back into the essence of the show), they changed Monk's therapist, and they managed to go another season without really explaining the reason behind his wife's mysterious death.  All of this, and yet, I will watch the fourth season.  I will mutter under my breath about the nasty changes, yet continue to view each and every episode.  Why?  I love the character of Adrian Monk.  I love the fact that he is building this amazing re-relationship with Captain Stottlemeyer.  One of my favorite episodes from this season was when he and Stottlemeyer were in Vegas solving a murder case.  That, to me, was the complete epitome of what makes this show amazing.  Now, if we could only find a way to change back to Sharona - but I think that is an unbeatable mission.

Overall, I am not as happy with this season as I have been with other seasons.  While I realize that this is only my third year with Mr. Monk, I am not happy with any of the big changes.  I think these changes make me fear for the stability of the show, but Tony Shalhoub is bankable.  He makes this show worth going back to even when the surrounding characters make it look grim.  The writing seemed better in this season, the mysterious seemed more fun and developed (another favorite was when Monk was buried and has visions of his wife), and there were some very comedic scenes.  I am going to try to allow these massive changes in this season to whisk away from my shoulders, but I cannot make any promises.  I want Sharona back - if I could shout that from the highest mountain I would.

As of this time, season three is my least favorite season.  I loathe the character named Natalie Teeger, but I can be patient.  Who knows what will happen in the upcoming seasons.

2264693,5,B00094AQZG,"Since I refuse to schedule time in front of the TV to watch shows when they're scheduled, I had not seen any of this season's Monk until I bought it on Amazon.

One thing that surprised me was that when his assistant Sharona (Bitty Schram) leaves and is replaced by Natalie (Traylor Howard), I found that I preferred Natalie's character. This is very unusual for me because I generally dislike cast changes from one season to another or from one movie to its sequel.

Really the only thing that bothered me about this season was the long-standing argument between Monk and Natalie over how much money he was going to pay her. Considering that most episodes in the first season featured some type of subplot concerning money problems, I've seen enough. It has continually gotten less and less, and hopefully the writers will decide there are other subplots worth filming and never rehash that one again.

In all, Monk is an excellent show, and the 3rd season kept me guessing just as much as the first 2 episodes. I highly recommend it.",1179014400,,1035,4.675824175824176

There will be those who will be upset because Monk has OCD, but it would not be realistic without a character like Monk. He actually shows glimmers of hope at times, and his interaction with the SF police department is quite funny.

2264732,5,B00094AQZG,"The first thing I'd like to say is that this truly is a show with a great ensemble cast. There's no need for me to praise Tony Shalhoub because the other reviewers (and his three well-deserved Emmy Awards) have already made that case more convincingly than I could. I'll just add, though, that Ted Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford are both outstanding in their supporting roles, particularly when they're interacting with one another.

Since so many people have weighed in on the subject of Sharona vs. Natalie I guess I will too. Personally I found Sharona's ""Joisey"" accent grating and her character obnoxious and overbearing. Sharona frequently criticized Monk and made snide comments to him, not to mention quitting her job twice within the first six episodes of season one alone. I'm not sure what part of this behavior it was that appealed so some people but personally I consider Sharona's departure to be a positive and it certainly doesn't seem to have hurt the show's popularity overall.

Natalie, on the other hand, is a much nicer character but manages to do so without being a pushover or a bland Watson-like sidekick. She's kind and supportive to the fragile Monk but also sets boundaries on what she's willing to tolerate; in other words, she manages to be strong without being annoying. Monk was a great show with Sharona but in my opinion it's an even better show with Natalie.",1162684800,6,1392,4.84453781512605
2264733,4,B00094AQZG,"I think some of the comments reflecting the entire season by basis of the cast change are overly harsh. No one likes change but the shift from Sherona to Natalie offered a new perspective. Although I liked the cast the way it was; Sherona had a slight trashiness to her, comparatively, Natalie offers more of a sweet wholesomeness. Monk also seems a little less needy to Natalie, if you notice he is less trepid and more open to change 'as far as Monk is concerned' after the switch. I am still an endearing fan and will continue to be so. Like when your favorite football team has not made it to the play-offs in years, are you any less supportive and switch to the winning team of the year.

I, on the other hand, find Natalie much more appealing and believeable as a person than Sharona, who seemed to spend way too much screen time dressed like a cheap hooker and making plays for the show's weekly ""bad boy.""  Natalie is just the kind of solid, caring, but assertive person Monk needs to give him a shot of reality now and again.  Traylor Howard, who plays Natalie, is one of the most overlooked and underappreciated actresses on the small screen today.  She has nuance and presence, and it doesn't hurt that she's easy on the eyes.  If you're not sure about purchasing this box set, rent it first, and see for yourself.

2264767,5,B00094AQZG,"Tony Shalhoub is consistently excellent as Monk. Sharona fulfills her role as the ""Watson"" character in a way that is beyond good.
Trivial, but noticeable: I do wish some reviewers would get this right ... Monk solves way more than one case a show, in fact usually several, so its not just a matter of a new season and ""16 more cases to solve"", in fact it is closer to double that amount, easily.
Sharona just disappears ""Mid-Season"", and The so-called  Sharona  clone, Natalie, is introduced. Well, she is not, officially, a Sharona  clone. Yes she is a new assistant, but look at the specials on disk 3. The Special  Feature LIFE BEFORE  MONK is actually at odds with the NATALIE  TEEGER PROFILE, where Tony says ( wether for the official  Studio line, or ?? ) that the change to Natalie is to basically cut loose Monk and see if/how he grows. Well, check out the two special  features on disc 3, the two are incompatible as views on the same  situation.
From Shows 1-9 in the third series, Sharona Helps Monk, Motivates Monk, and pushes him on to do more; Sharona is the emotional, and plot catalyst in many ways ( she  rips the Hair piece off the Commisioner, and thus helps solve the case).
In the Shows 10-16, Teeger is a fifth wheel, does less than Sharona, and is superbly vacuous. One scene has Monk asking why she is doing something and ""Natalie"" says "" I can do anything I want, I'm cute..."".
In one great episode, Mako ( as Master Zee) makes some observations that resonate so well, and in a manner that only Mako, a superb character player, can deliver.
I don't want to say which scenes are the best emotionally, but when Monk/Adrian, gets to play essentially on his own, Monk is superbly emotional and emotive.
If they can find a way to restore Sharona, then this will restore the original Successful Formula.

Also,the Box is of a high Quality than previous boxes; contrary to some comments, the smaller plastic covers are better than the foldouts in Seasons  1 and 2 because they are more  robust. I have bought enough of the Digipack foldouts to know, and to be able to recommend that the Individual  Disc  Covers are Superb.
I honestly hope that this is not the last Major Season of Monk, but maybe, like so many great shows, three seasons is the limit; however, some superb shows can last 8 seasons with great writing. In my view, the core writing idea is great, what you need is maybe some fresh views on a timeless plot structure, not a change to a vacuous assistant that allows the lead to show his skills. The superb essence of this show is the ensemble cast that works so very, VERY  well.",1129939200,15,2613,4.4926004228329806

Tony Shalhoub, a seriously underrated actor, would love to see him in a main comedic role. Besides that he is a great actor, i couldn't think of anyone else to play the part.

Series 3 in general, as good as the rest??? i would say yes! Some hardcore sharona fans would disagree as i know there are few boycotting the show due to the way shorona was booted out, but hey it's a great show, and even though i was reluctant at first i'm glad i watched the last few without her.

Was looking forward to an episode with Monks brother in again (one of my favs from season 2), but unfortunately there isn't one, but i have seen that Season 4 Ep 2 is based on his brother again. One obsessive compulsive on screen is funny, put 2 together and it's hilarious!

2264800,5,B00094AQZG,"This is advice for the not-yet-hooked-on-Monk...

I came to know Monk because of my mother-in-law's recommendation. (I have trouble believing it, too.)

My wife and I have now been hooked for 2 years. It's the only series we watch and the only show we ever record.

 I predict Monk will be a long-lived favorite in the same sense as  M*A*S*H . Characters, story, characters, suspense, characters and humor... The predictibility of the characters, their interplay, the mystery solving, the romance of Monk and Trudie and, above all, Monk's Obsessive Compulsive Disorder driven skill, draw fans even though it airs on Friday night on a non-major network.

If you're not-yet-hooked-on-Monk, it's essential to watch Season One, first. (The boxed set includes the pilot.)

Yes, there is a thread running throughout the life of the series. Background info is revealed from time to time. And, you get to feel the dismay over Sharona being written out of the script...

Sherona left and a new, random ""nurse"" came in and took her spot.  Also the episodes oddly changed from their usual, almost innocent attitude into a violent almost scarry attitude.  In episodes such as Mr. Monk vs. The Cobra, where in the beginning a bloody assult on a seemingly innocent man takes place and where Monk is hit over the head with a spade, the attitude showing in the episode isn't very pleasing.

2264802,5,B00094AQZG,"One of the more clever television creations of the new millennium, Monk combines the high-grade suspense of a traditional TV drama with the quirky humor of a big screen comedy. Originally developed for ABC, the show became an instant prime-time lynchpin for the USA network, proving itself one of the more successful shows on cable TV...

In Monk, Tony Shalhoub stars in the title role of Adrian Monk, a former San Francisco detective placed on psychiatric leave. A true legend in the community, Monk solves unsolvable crimes via his towering intellect, photographic memory, and meticulous observations. But the one case that alludes Monk is the 1997 murder of his wife Trudy, which forever altered Monk's capacity to perform his job. Suffering from severe obsessive-compulsive disorder and a number of odd phobias, Monk requires a personal assistant, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram), for even his most basic daily activities. Yet Monk remains a police consultant on difficult cases, and he hopes to persuade Capt. Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine) to give him his old job back. But Stottlemeyer and colleague Lt. Randall Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford), harbor doubts about Monk's mental faculties. As Monk solves cases though, those doubts dissipate and Stottlemeyer and Disher learn to appreciate Monk's special talents - despite his inability to cope with the day-to-day activities of a normal detective... Nevertheless, he remains a de facto investigator as he and Sharona aid the San Francisco police department in solving numerous high profile cases...

The Monk (Season 3) DVD features a number of hilarious episodes including the season premiere ""Mr. Monk Takes Manhattan"" in which Monk and company take a trip to New York City to investigate a lead on Trudy's murder given to Monk in the previous year's season finale. But while settling into their hotel, a riot breaks out in the lobby, and three people are killed, including the Latvian ambassador (who was just standing next to Monk). With Monk's identification of the killer's left ear being the only eye witness description of the perpetrator, the NYPD must rely on Monk's unique skills in order to solve the crime... Other notable episodes from Season 3 include ""Mr. Monk Meets the Godfather"" in which Monk is pressured by a local mafia boss to help solve the murder of five of his henchmen, and ""Mr. Monk Gets Cabin Fever"" in which Monk witnesses a Chinese gangland murder, prompting the FBI to place him in the witness protection program - harboring him in a cabin out in the middle of nowhere...

2264803,4,B00094AQZG,"Tony Shalhoub is a versatile actor who's been in the business for many years. His sitcom career spans from Antonio Scarpacci in Wings to Ian Stark in Stark Raving Mad before landing the much acclaimed title role of Monk. Prior to that he began acting in small roles in films such as ""Honeymoon In Vegas"", and with Bill Murray in ""Quick Change"". He also continued acting in films despite his TV roles, including ""Men In Black"", ""Siege"", ""I.Q."" and ""Galaxy Quest"" among others.

In Monk Tony Shalhoub is former police detective Adrian Monk, whose photographic memory and amazing ability to piece together tiny clues made him a local legend.

He suffers from intensified obsessive-compulsive disorder and a variety of phobias since the unsolved murder of his wife, Trudy, in 1997. Now on psychiatric leave from the San Francisco Police Department and working as a freelance detective/ consultant on difficult cases, Monk hopes to convince his former boss, Captain Leland Stottlemeyer (Ted Levine), to allow him to return to the force. Stottlemeyer, who wavered between admiration for Monk and annoyance at his eccentricities during the first season, is becoming more of a friend to Monk as the series develops, frequently calling him in to help, as much for Monk's benefit as for his own. However, he knows Monk's limitations as well as his strengths and may still harbor doubts about the wisdom of allowing Monk to carry a gun or subdue a perpetrator. Stottlemeyer's second-in-command, Lieutenant Randall Disher (Jason Gray-Stanford), also seems to be developing both admiration and compassion for the man he once labeled ""the defective detective"".

Despite flaws and inadequacies all around, the three are becoming an increasingly effective team, with additional help from Monk's personal assistant. From the double-episode pilot through the first half of season three, Monk was aided by his nurse, Sharona Fleming (Bitty Schram). But in the tenth episode of the third season, Sharona was replaced by a new assistant, Natalie Teeger (Traylor Howard ex-star of Two Guys & A girl). Like Sharona, a divorcee with a son named Benjy, Natalie is a single parent, a widow with a daughter named Julie (Emmy Clarke). Unlike Sharona, Natalie is not a nurse but a former bartender with a fresh perspective on ""Mr. Monk,"" as she still addresses him.

You can't help but compare it to Columbo but funnier. Its subtle comedy is more an undertone & with great writing both the humor as well as the suspense shine through.

Verdict: Good third season although not as good as the first.  Traylor Howard is a refreshing change although time will tell how well suited she is for this role.

Rating: 4 stars for overall season. Would have got 5 stars had we not had season one to compare it to.",1120867200,13,2773,4.976241900647948
2264804,5,B00094AQZG,"Adrian Monk is back with sixteen new cases to solve.  The seasons starts in New York as the regular cast follows up a clue about the death of Monk's wife Trudy.  But soon they're back to San Francisco and dealing with killer monkeys, power failures, the mob, traffic, Vegas, and a new assistant.

Just over the halfway point, Bitty Schram, who played Monk's assistant Sharona, was asked to leave the show over a salary dispute.  As with any cast change, this one has it's own share of controversy.  I was afraid this would ruin my favorite series, but I felt it made it stronger.  Natalie is a strong character.  In fact, her introduction episode is easily my favorite of this season.  While she shares much with Sharona, she doesn't treat Monk with kid gloves but expects him to behave somewhat like an adult.  Even more importantly, it forced the writers to once again focus on good character interactions and stories.  I feel the first half of the season was slipping into caricature.  The cast change forced them to refocus their efforts; it proved to be a breath of fresh air that the show needed.

So what do you get with this set?  The sixteen episodes are presented in wide screen and Dolby sound on four discs.  Each disc also contains at least one mini extra segment.  There are five this time around.  Members of the cast and crew talk about favorite scenes; we finally get a profile of Monk as well as Natalie; Tony Shalhoub, Ted Levine, and Jason Gray-Stanford talk about the back story of their characters (we learn nothing new about Monk, but we do about the other two); and the series creator talks a little bit about Monk's quirks.  Most of these segments are only five minutes long, so we really don't learn much from them.

This series continues to entertain with funny lines and situations and puzzling mysteries.  If you love light mysteries, this series is for you.  I can't wait to see what Monk takes on next.",1120521600,51,1933,4.5964912280701755
2264805,4,B00094AQZG,"Tv`s volatile detective returns , for the third time, with a compilation of 16 episodes that fans will truly worship.  Adrian Monk, is a cautious hunter stalking as close as he can to his prey before making that final charge, who must inquire into the disappearence of his beloved wife.  With the forlorn hope of shedding his extremist image, he is assisted by Captain Stottlemeyer who, after a series of altercations, accepts that Monk`s mental quickness plays a crucial role in the fields of crime.  But for all that the Captain is Monk`s crime-fellow, his patience begins to wear thin and, as they couplet deal with the acts of atrocity and the lack of cohesion, he begins to muse the prospect of the case being solved.  While plunging deeper and deeper, we witness first-hand attempts to overcome the barrier of a test of wills, inevitable troughs and, most noticeably, the influx of authority!  I recommend this film for all, because this work of art will truly captivate adults as well as children!",1120435200,4,1004,4.813953488372093
2264806,4,B00094AQZG,"I was a fan of Monk since day one, this season left a little bit to be desired. The first episodes are still brilliant but the changes in cast and writing in the second half on the season change the show dramatically. The replacement of Sharona is inexcusable and Natalie Treager can't fill Bitty's shoes acting or chararcter wise, but the writing has suffered as well. The mysteries have become second rate and watered-down and the writing as a whole has become less clever and more hokey. The bizarre episodes without the Captain and Lt. are weird and leave you questioning whether this is really the same show. Hopefully for season four they have brought the writing back to par or it will be a miss in my book. A monk fan will appreciate this DVD especially for the first half but the second will not make a monk fan out of someone who hasn't seen the show.",1120262400,16,861,4.455696202531645

I mean I watched it till season 3 the red herring and there was this worst exit for a character who was kinda sympathetic and there is women who is a total feminist who says men is lying and I thought they were improving but no they have to bring in a piece of crap or jerk character and rub it in our faces. You know what this show is really making fun of those who issues. Thats what this show is which is insensitive and a bully as well.
