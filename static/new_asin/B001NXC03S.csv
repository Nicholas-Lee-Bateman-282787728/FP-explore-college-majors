8328027,5,B001NXC03S,"I remember coming to know about UFO Phil back in 2011 after listening to a Friday night show of George Noory's Coast to Coast am broadcast by hearing the ending song which was different than that of the other nights of the week. I googled some of the lyrics and found videos of UFO Phil including the UFO Phil the movie, I think I watched most of the videos on Youtube that night. I thought the movie was funny, especially the part where the metal head was explaining how he created a nuclear explosion in his apartment! This movie has a lot of heart and I have to say that Rick and the rest of the crew did an awesome job!",1412467200,2,623,4.1570247933884295

""Can You Keep A Secret ?""
First off please GOOGLE `Zippy The Pinhead',Weird huh ?,Phil is Zippy,Zoppy is Phil.(period)
We kept squinting at the screen to make sure,This wasn't MOBY pulling a fast one.
UFO PHIL has a sincere claim to fame,His songs were on Dr. Demento Radio Show,Hey- It did wonders for Weird Al Yankovic .
Phil visits a- Karate Studio(with mixed results,That kid did a low blow in fight),Insurance company(Trying to get alien abduction insurance),Hardware Store(This goes on & on with wonderful cinema moments).
The filmakers brag on using multiple cameras,Cheap...But multiple.
This could be PEREZ HILTON impersonating an alien ?
There is one touching segment that makes you think of Michael Jackson's Neverland and others abusing the star to their own agendas,But they don't Kill Phil !
Ends in one of those goal full-filling concerts,Seen a million times,But with a bigger budget(The others,Not UFO Phil).
