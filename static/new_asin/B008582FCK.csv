5132289,5,B008582FCK,"Hit and Miss is one of the most unique, interesting, and quirky series I've come across.  Great characters, great storyline, at times shocking, horrifying, and touching.  Wish there were more episodes.",1352332800,6,201,5.451612903225806
5132290,5,B008582FCK,"Hit and Miss is a fresh, new idea in entertainment.
I would recomend this dvd to anyone looking for something new.",1351555200,8,114,4.476190476190476
5132291,4,B008582FCK,"If you happen to flick through the channels, Direct TV only unfortunetly, and just happen to stop on the Audience channel, you might want to check to see if they are showing this incredibly well acted drama. Chloe Sevigny is fantastic, her English accent is believable and you feel for her characters dual roles; not only as a transgender (male and female) but in playing both mother to her new family and assassin, (her job; not exactly family friendly). The young actors are wonderful, the older kids play hot and cold with her while the younger kids are curious about her and quickly latch on all while each character having their own story, especially Riley & Ryan. Definitely check it out.",1345593600,16,694,4.743801652892562

5132294,5,B008582FCK,This movie so great she is like me but just a normal job though I give it a 6 stars.,1439942400,,84,3.25
5132295,4,B008582FCK,"I caught this on Netflixs and really enjoyed it. A great blend of genres: romance, drama, and thriller. Cast is pretty strong too. I only have a few of complaints. (1) Chloe Sevigny's accent was all over the place (2) Minor plotholes in some of the storylines, but nothing too distracting and (3) Cliffhanger ending.

If you enjoy The Americans on FX you might want to give Hit & Miss a try. This series has dark drama, toxic relationships, murder, betrayal, hidden identities, and a whole bunch of other stuff going on. I only wish it had a solid ending. You can kinda guess where it was going, but it really is a cliffhanger ending.

DVD worked great, but no real extras.",1431820800,,673,4.508196721311475
5132296,5,B008582FCK,Great TV series .. wish there was more than one season!!!  Still worth a buy .. i've watched this completely twice and i know i'll be watching over again many times.,1430179200,,165,4.32258064516129

5132298,5,B008582FCK,"Hit and Miss series is unique and unlike anything I have seen .It's like they condensed an entire season into 6 episodes. Each episode will keep you wanting to see more. As to the plot ,read the label .Be forewarned it's not filmed in the US and contains real actors who will make you believe in the story line .",1423958400,,312,4.216666666666667

5132306,5,B008582FCK,"I am really enjoying this series and I rank it right up there with The Fall and Top of the Lake. Sevigny is really outstanding as the protagonist and is entirely credible as a transgender pre-op individual coping with her commitment to family members, her gender identity and her job.

I am really amazed and pleased when I find a little gem like this of such high quality and sensibility.",1402790400,,389,4.557142857142857
5132307,5,B008582FCK,"I love this series I got the Blu-ray version six months ago watched it all the way through loved every minute of it.
Unfortunately the powers that be have decided that Blu-ray players in the United States Unless non-regional won't play
Anything other then region one formatted media.
So the movie they played in my PlayStation 6 months ago will no longer play and I'm out my $36 investment.
I however ordered the DVD version that is region one just because I love this series so much.
Thank you big brother for protecting me from illegal Blu-rays from Europe.
Now please reinforce me my $36. I kind of doubt that I'm going to get a check from the government for $36 but I'll keep my fingers crossed.",1398211200,2,699,4.511811023622047
5132308,5,B008582FCK,"Can't beat this story ---- a pre-op transgender assassin who inherits a bunch of children in Ireland.  Yet Chloe (and the great children) make is seem totally believable!  Lovely story,  fast plot, wonderful characters.  I really enjoyed it immensely!",1393286400,,251,5.358974358974359
5132309,5,B008582FCK,"Loved the series and regret that Chloe won't be making any more of these.
Keeps you interested with upturns and downturns.",1391990400,,122,4.857142857142857
5132310,5,B008582FCK,"Certainly not for everyone, this is one quirky show. The nudity will likely bother some people, but anyone with half a brain should be able to differentiate between sex and nudity, and what little exists on this show is the latter. It's hard to talk about this show without giving away spoilers, so I will leave it at that. I do hope there's a Season#2 forthcoming, because the acting is great, the story lines very human and interesting, plus a killer soundtrack throughout each episode.",1391212800,2,488,4.752941176470588
5132311,5,B008582FCK,"This is an excellent BBC production that is definitely not for children.

There's an intriguing plot: A young male-to female transsexual hit woman's ex female lover dies leaving four children, one of whom is our heroine's, to parent. Her 8 year old son is beyond adorable, while the two older children, teens, are a handful, and the youngest, a girl, is gliding through in a haze of fantasy.

I found the plot original and captivating. Be forewarned, there was plenty of gore, a couple of rape scenes, and full frontal nudity of our heroine.

The acting was superb.

One caveat: the ending leaves you hanging. At first, I thought my tape (borrowed from the library) was missing something, but apparently this is the actual ending.",1391040000,,730,4.816
5132312,5,B008582FCK,"Well actually I didn't love the first one I got because it was for a different country and made me crazy trying to watch it but when I got the US version it was great. Edgy, unexpected turns, it was just too short but I guess they aren't going to continue the story ... rats!",1383350400,,275,4.0181818181818185
5132313,5,B008582FCK,The moment i saw the first scene i knew i was gonna like this show. And by the end cliffhanger i was left hungry for more. Well written british drama..couldnt believe it was cancelled on its first season run. Reguardless it is nothing less than awesome. Chloe ( lead actor) rocked it!,1380672000,,284,4.480769230769231
5132314,5,B008582FCK,"Even characters playing minor role are superb. Mia, who has always felt female inside, is desperate to complete her transformation into a woman. In one of the most moving scenes, she purchases a pregnancy belly to try and get an idea of what pregnancy, something she will never experience, would have been like. She is in love with a man, and he with her, even after he learns her secret, but he struggles with her only partial physical femaleness. She comes to love the children she suddenly found herself responsible for so much that she spends the money she had saved for her operation to give them a home and in doing so delays, possibly for years, her desperately wanted final surgery that would make her completely female. And she is an efficient and ruthless killer. This is an extraordinary series, and it deserved much better than cancellation after only six episodes. Even ending on a cliff-hanger, this is well worth watching.",1380499200,,937,4.790123456790123
5132315,5,B008582FCK,"The story line and characters make this series a smash - at least for me.  Chloe is one of my all time favorites, and she plays her part with usual genius.  I am saddened that it didn't go past the 6th episode.  There were so many issues yet to be addressed in the program.",1377993600,,273,4.018518518518518
5132316,5,B008582FCK,"I just finished watching this series and found it very clever, well written, produced and with excellent acting. I was wishing there was more but still thought this movie was well work watching. I can definitely recommend it.",1375833600,,225,4.947368421052632
5132317,3,B008582FCK,"The story premise is great - since most other story ideas around hired or contract killers have already been explored.

Acting is wonderful, the characters, even the villains are 3-dimensional. One wonders who and why her(?) victims had to die - and she in some way echos that sentiment.

The one and only thing that really, really spoils my total immersion in this series is that the role of  transgender person is portrayed by a female actress. I'm reminded of the time in cinema and theater when black people were portrayed by white actors with ""blackface.""

Every time I see her (the actress) react to a scene, or move in a specific way, or portray an inner emotion, I'm left to wonder if that truly is how a transgender person would look, move feel and act in a similar situation.

Get it, and try and suspend the little inquiring voice that whispers ""is that really how it might have gone down?"" (No pun intended)",1375315200,2,919,4.579268292682927
5132318,4,B008582FCK,"In this British mini-series, Mia--played by Chloe Sevigny--is going through the process of becoming a woman, a transgender. What makes this drama interesting is that Mia is a contract killer and he needs to kill a lot of people to earn enough money to complete the transgender process and become a woman.

In Mia's mind, she is already a woman and lives the part. But a complication threatens her plans. When Mia's former wife dies, the male to female contract killer inherits several children.

I enjoyed watching this drama with its stark Irish setting, but felt cheated when it ended, because I wanted more of a conclusion. I felt as if the story were left hanging. That said, if you are looking for something offbeat and different, it's worth watching, because it offers us a peak into a world few of us are aware of--I'm talking about the transgender world not contract killers although that is interesting too.

I bought this three disk set.",1374019200,,947,4.762195121951219
5132319,5,B008582FCK,"I found this show via Jonas Armstrong.  When I read the synopsis I thought I was going to have to dig the internet for torrents because no way was this a show that would air on US TV, let alone be readily available on Netflix or Amazon.  I was overjoyed that it's on Netflix streaming (in case anyone wants to check it out there).  I had no idea what to expect from this.

The plot is a little convoluted, but well thought out and incredibly brave subject matter.  I actually could have done without the hit man part - I didn't think it was very well done at all.  Chloe just didn't sell herself as a man or even androgynous in these scenes.  She fought, looked, and shot like a girl - a girl with no experience fighting or shooting a gun.  As the main hook of the show I wish they would have sent her to better fighting camp prior to filming like the camp they put Hillary Swank thru.  There was several scenes of her hitting stuff (people, bags of meat) where not only would she have broke her own hand/wrist had she hit like that in real life, but would be delivering completely ineffectual flailing girl punches that most certainly would never knock a grown man out or even give a black eye.  I felt completely immersed in Mia's world except in those scenes.  And even the big guns Mia yields - in several scenes it looked like she was struggling to have the strength to cock/assemble/carry them.  I don't know how else they could have fixed those flaws, maybe a body double?  Thankfully these scenes were few and short just to move the other story lines.  Where this show was heartbreaking and fantastic for me was the scenes of Mia dealing with her world as TG, and watching how the writers chose to have the world deal with her.  I don't know if I've ever seen a movie or show unflinchingly let us into the mind of a transgendered person.  Chloe was brilliant in this.  The family was a little over the top, I especially cared less for the older brother, he was annoying.  The sister was fantastic and acted just as I imagine I would myself had I been in her shoes.  Amazingly, I loved what they did with the boyfriend.  Although I really didn't see my idea of ""fun"" play out in the show and what time Ben and Mia spent together that would send him head over heels in love with her so much that he can put aside his own identity as a hetro man (which could and should have been explored MUCH more - I mean, that's a HUGE deal.  HUGE.  Easily enough for a whole episode of just Ben dealing with his feelings, prejudices and sexuality), but I can suspend my disbelief based on the chemistry Jonas and Chloe had on camera and just imagine they had oodles of cuddle/talking/fun together that we just don't see due to time constraints.  The ending was a great cliffhanger, and I am sad to hear they won't be continuing this series.  Given a chance, I think it really could have broken down doors in the entertainment world.",1373760000,,2925,4.334558823529412
5132320,5,B008582FCK,"I hadn't seen the trailer - just read the synopsis but I absolutely loved the show. I wanted to see more than just the 6 episodes.
Chloe is so heart-breakingly good and the rest of the cast is just amazing. It was a story told from a perspective I haven't seen before and I was impressed and pleased.
Great show! I hope there will be more.",1372464000,,339,4.151515151515151
5132321,5,B008582FCK,"Not a boring minute in this series. I was thrilled by the characters and specially by Chloe Sevigny, who played her difficult part as a trans sexual hit woman very convincingly. The story centers in political corrupt and criminal circles, where problems are resolved through extrem violence, and rutless betrayal. The character of Chloe is torn between a family of children, where She is/was the ""father"" and the ""job"" She sometimes has to attempt too.
It becomes increasingly difficult for our Protagonist not to involve her children in a war of crime, where the sides
are not drawn, and where an ally today, can become your enemy tomorrow. Ultimately, our protagonist seeks a sex change operation to become a woman. So it's save to call our Protagonist a woman, because that's the way She looks and feels. Her lover, does not know about her transsexual state, until She can no longer hide it, this journey without leaving any spoilers is very delicately entertaining. Our Protagonist plays a very attractive person, which leaves her victims (hits), mostly unexpecting. Not being suspicious looking for her hits, is giving her an edge in the trade of carrying out criminal death sentences. Comment Comment | Permalink",1372032000,,1218,5.034653465346534
5132322,5,B008582FCK,"""Breaking Bad"" was based on a ridiculous premise - however with great acting, script, direction, photography and music  - somehow it seems to fly like an eagle.  ""Hit & Miss"" is similar in that its  lead character with a major medical issue is trying to support a family with money earned rendering an extreme service. In ""Hit & Miss,"" charismatic Chloe Sevigny plays ""Mia,"" and she is the field of gravity which keeps us reeled in despite a lot of unlikely stuff. For someone who isn't quite female yet (Mia needs to complete the transformation with surgery), Mia radiates female power - we can only think of her as a guy when she's in the shower. I have a vision of Chloe Sevigny playing the lead in a contemporary remake of ""Of Human Bondage."" Chloe could play both the bad girl (like Bette Davis) and the good girl who saves the nice guy's soul at the end.  Sevigny is a fashion designer who could absolutely give herself two different looks and play two different characters in the same movie.",1369526400,,998,4.558659217877095
5132323,5,B008582FCK,"In addition to the comments others are making, (and shared disappointment over the cliffhanger ending, with no resolution in sight) I would like to add my praise for the music in the series, which adds greatly to the bleak yet beautiful atmosphere of the series.  Others on the net have listed the songs, which I found reminiscent of the smoky darkness of Nick Cave and other gravelly, lyric-rich artists.  After hearing ""On Battleship Hill"" during episode 4, I was moved to purchase the album it's on--LET ENGLAND SHAKE by PJ Harvey.  ""Warm Shadow"" led me to the album PERFECT DARKNESS by Fink, a band I've never heard of before.",1369526400,4,630,4.761467889908257

8525303,5,B008582FCK,"Excellent writing, acting, everything.  The lead character is transgender and there is some nudity accomplished with explicit props but it's relevant to what stylistic and thematic elements the writers and directors are attempting to weave into the warp and weft of the series.  There are perhaps a couple attempts at theatrical symbolism, the main character falling into surreal harlequin like theatrics by herself epitomizing how she feels often to be left out or odd, e.g. by her having a phallic Pinocchio like nose attached to her face in one scene... kinda symbolizing a drunken semi hallucinogenic depression... those parts get a little too self-conscious for my taste, but that is saying more about my taste than the use of those elements as, again, i'm giving this 5 Stars easily, and would love for their to be follow up seasons.  Can't understand why there are not, in fact.  Again, excellent writing, acting, directing, and a real work of art and downright enjoyable despite the heaviness of themes the show handily wields.",1469923200,,1035,5.070588235294117
