1994556,5,B0001EQIGK,"I don't think that it is right that everyone is putting down this DVD. John Cena is a great wrestler, and a great rapper and this DVD represents that. If anyone actually put aside the fans in back-ground, they would realize that. Some creep was saying how you could barely hear him over the fans screaming, well they were screaming for a reason! Geez, you could hear him fine.  They were saying that it felt like they spent about an hour editing it. If you stop thinking about stupid things like that you could actually appreciate that.  This was a great DVD.",1080777600,,559,4.470588235294118
1994557,4,B0001EQIGK,"The dvd contains some full matches, extras and a lot of battle raps from WWE performer John Cena who is described as ""the future of WWE (SmackDown!)"".
I have to admit that there could have been more information about him and his past but in my opinion this is just one dvd of many thus I didn't expect to get the ultimate information anyway.
He has many years left, the best of the current John Cena was shown-I guess there isn't more so far.
All things considered I recommand ""Word Life"" only for the John Cena fans and although the price is a little bit too high (1 Disc-20 bucks), I wasn't dissapointed.",1079049600,,606,4.371681415929204
1994558,2,B0001EQIGK,"When I bought this DVD, I was expecting to get some behind the scenes footage with John Cena. But what i got was a bunch of footage that I've seen many times. Compared to other WWE videos, this was not very detailed. It seems like they put this DVD together in less than an hour. It was relatively short and I was very disappointed with the content. Unless you're a diehard John Cena fan, don't but this DVD. Take your $25 and but a PPV that lasts 3 times as long!!!",1078704000,,466,4.131868131868132
1994559,5,B0001EQIGK,"This dvd on John Cena is Bad Ass.  Tons of freestyles, a few matches and three hidden easter eggs.  I can't wait until June for his Album release.  If your down with ""Thugonomics"" this is a must own.",1078704000,,199,4.184210526315789
1994560,3,B0001EQIGK,"I'm a huge John Cena fan, but this DVD could be much better. The extra matches included are a nice bonus, but there's only 5 matches on this DVD period. When I buy a wrestling DVD it's for wrestling. The whole DVD is John Cena's freestyles. Really the whole DVD is JUST his freestyles, with Cena introductions. I like his freestyles just as much as the next Cena fan, but what about some content. Not a whole lot of replay value to hear him rap. The other extra features are a Before They Were Superstars, wich is a really cool look at his past. A funny outside the ropes segment from WWE Confidential. Behind the Scenes of the YJ Stinger ads. Smackdown Magazine cover shoot. John Cena & Eddie Guerrero in Singapore (funny segment). And Battle rap in Baghdad were he battle raps a soilder.
The matches are:
vs. Chris Benoit
vs. Brock Lesnar
vs. Undertaker
vs. Eddie Guerrero
vs. Kurt Angle
So if you are a huge Cena fan pick it up, if not this one should be passed on.",1078272000,8,968,4.3535911602209945
1994561,5,B0001EQIGK,"Not only does this DVD tell you everything there is to know about the Doctor of Thuganomics but also it takes a look at what made him famous. That is his famous rap promos dissing Lesnar-Taker-Angle-Show. All his classic rap promos + Battle raps with Angle and Show are in the DVD. His classic matches with Taker and Angle are also there to see.
The only thing that this DVD doesnt fufill that it doesnt have MORE RAP PROMOS of CENA...1 CD should have been totally devoted to every single rap promo he did since Thanksgiving 2002!!!
But at the end of the day, a great DVD and Im sure his 2nd DVD will be even better!!!",1077926400,,618,4.2905982905982905

1994564,3,B0001EQIGK,"I bought this fairly cheap, it's a solid movie.. nothing great. The movie is about his raps and the bonus features are some of his good matches.

1994567,1,B0001EQIGK,"Cena sucks and is an insult to wrestling and the now jolk of a WWE title which was created for this no talent bum.  Hopefully we won't have to ""See him"" much longer.",1227571200,2,165,4.0
1994568,1,B0001EQIGK,"We've Cen-enough,

when will the WWE stop pushing John Cena, lets be fair he came into the company as a jobber, and a jobber he should be. I saw parts of this DVD on a John Cena special on cable and it did not convince me to give him a chance. He has no wrestling abilty, he can;t cut promo's without sounding like a cross between Stone Cold and The Rock, his character consists of doing a poor impressions of a black man (Booker T does a far better job because he is a black man, unlike Cena, who just plays one on TV).

Instead of pushing Cena, they should have pushed Vanillia Ice, his just like Cena, except he might be able to wrestle.",1154563200,7,640,4.112
1994569,2,B0001EQIGK,"This dvd doesnt really do much justice for Cena. It was rushed in a hurry but for what purpose? The matches are good but the documentary on him is where it sucks. It forgets he beat Angle in his first match, and just kind of skips around to when he first started to rap. The raps are good for a few times around, espeically against Big Show. If your a Cena fan you might enjoy it , but there is alot left out.",1153353600,3,409,3.9397590361445785

IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT HIS BALLTLE RAPS TO AND TJHE EXTRAS ARE GREAT!!!! ALOT OF THE EXTRAS ARE MATCHES AND IT SHOWS A EPISODE OF HIM FROM BEFORE THEY WERE SUPERSTRS. AND MORE GREAT STUFF TO.

1994571,3,B0001EQIGK,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2012.

As John Cena has become the face of WWE, every success story has a start somewhere & this story started the day he decided to drop his generic babyface look in favor of sports jerseys, jeans, athletic shoes, a lock & chain around his neck, beginning to talk with more of an attitude & through rhymes while also adapting the four words of ""Word Life....Basic Thuganomics.""  Now this DVD set came out early in his career (under 2 years from his TV debut) to capitalize on his fast rising popularity so this wasn't your typical ""career"" documentary as it focused more on the best of his raps from the past year of his career which it being hosted by Cena himself with no other names adding to the set past his friends & cousin Trademarc in the background.

The presentation starts with his first rap at the SmackDown Christmas part back in 2002 as Vanilla Ice. His promo raps on Brock Lesnar (Backlash 2003) & Undertaker (Vengeance 2003) are shown before going into his battle raps he did with people like Rikishi, Brian ""Spanky"" Kendrick, Kurt Angle, and the funniest one of them all with Big Show (""Your the white girl & I'm Kobe Bryant!""). His little ""masturbation"" rap on Stephanie McMahon & his promo on Vince & Sable are also shown followed by highlights of his various pre-match raps on people like Rhyno, Billy Gunn, Funaki, and A-Train before with his rap at the first ""SmackDown In Iraq"" show close out the documentary.

Matches Include:
vs. Chris Benoit - This was the tournament final to see who would get the title shot against Brock Lesnar at Backlash.  Benoit stayed in control early by out-wrestling Cena to the point where dirty tactics were used in order for Cena to get an advantage before grounding Benoit with holds like the chinlock only for him to fight back with hard chops & even a suicide dive onto the floor.  Cena targeted Benoit's previously injured neck including a top rope legdrop while his neck was hanging across the ropes along with other moves like his throwback & headlocks while Benoit was able to take advantage when Cena got frustrated with his trademark german suplexes & crossface.  This was a good TV match between the two with Cena still being green but Benoit bringing out a better performance than previously seen since the birth of his ""thuganomics"" character.
""SmackDown"" Apr. '03

vs. WWE Champion Brock Lesnar - Cena was out for revenge here for Brock injuring his leg months earlier & jumped Brock before the bell only for Brock to quickly regain control using his power like two backbreakers & suplexes, an elevated slam, and Cena being tossed into the announce table.  Cena was able to use Brock's momentum against him sending him into the steps to take control targeting the cut on his head using the steps & ringpost, legdrop on his head while it was on the ropes, and DDT to the point where Brock was bleeding.  They went back & forth with Brock using his strength & superior wrestling ability while Cena stuck to his brawling style & even some dirty tactics at times to the point where the winner wasn't dominate more than he was able to catch the other guy.
Backlash '03
[Brock Lesnar: Here Comes The Pain - Collectors Edition]

vs. Undertaker - This was the rematch from the previous Vengeance PPV & Taker dominated right from the start working over Cena's shoulder with twisting armbars including an elevated one along with doing ""Old School"" & driving it into the turnbuckle.  However the internal injured that Cena gave him at Vengeance came into play after a superplex that hurt Taker as much as Cena which had Cena focus on midsection but Taker kept coming including one stiff clothesline but kept hurting himself with his own offense like the Last Ride attempt.  This match overall showcased Cena on the defense but was more about putting over Taker's upcoming storyline & didn't match up to their previous Vengeance encounter (which you can see on Taker's ""Tombstone"" DVD set)

vs. United States Champion Eddie Guerrero - This was suppose to be Guerrero's homecoming as the U.S. Champion but Cena ruined it by stealing the rim & tire from his low-rider coming into this match.  Guerrero was so upset that he attacked Cena from behind during his entrance & threw Cena into the steps cutting his forehead which Eddie continued to target using the announce table & using his own ""lie, cheat, steal"" ways to use a chair.  Cena was able to gain control when Eddie missed one of his signature moves before working over his back with moves like the powerbomb, delayed suplex, and bearhug while also using the the steps at ringside.  Eddie brought out one of the best performances from Cena during this period of his career as they traded momentum throughout the match but the biggest story was what happened towards the end & after the match which setup the famous ""Parking Lot Brawl"" between the two the next week (which can be seen on Eddie Guerrero's ""Viva La Raza"" DVD set).
""SmackDown"" Sept. '03

vs. Kurt Angle - Angle out-wrestled Cena early but caught a break when Angle went shoulder first into the post & started bleeding from the mouth which led to Cena going on the offensive with a grounded front headlock & spinebuster.  Angle took control back when catching Cena with a dropkick to the shin & even attempted to to a german suplex off the apron to the outside only for Cena to counter into a DDT on the apron as Cena continued to work over Angle's previously injured neck with a top rope legdrop right on the neck straddled along the top rope, his throwback, and a powerbomb into the corner.  The intensity picked up with both men surviving the others signature moves to the point where Cena himself resorted to desperation & dirty tactics to try to gain an advantage at one point.  Angle gave Cena possibly the best wrestling match in his career here but the bigger story here was how this match shadowed the future of Cena as despite the fact he was the heel in this match, he started getting a big show of support from the crowd.
No Mercy '03

DVD extras include his ""Before They Were Superstars"" profile, behind the scenes of his Stacker 2 commercial, a battle rap against a soldier in Iraq, and various features from the ""Confidental"" show including answering questions on ""Outside The Ropes"", behind the scenes of his SmackDown magazine cover, and visiting Singapore with Eddie Guerrero.  Hidden extras include his Stacker 2 commercial, a rap about the new year, and a backstage segment from SmackDown featuring him & Funaki.

If your a fan of his ""thugamonics"" period then I would recommend this as his raps were entertaining with some funny punchlines while he would go on to have better & more famous matches in his career but again were overall some the best from this period of his career.",1140825600,4,6808,4.677824267782427
1994572,4,B0001EQIGK,"It's nice to have a collection of all of Cena's early raps on one DVD.  The extras aren't too bad either.  If you like Cena, then I'd recommend buying this DVD.  If you don't like Cena, then don't buy it.  It's as simple as that. WORD LIFE.",1122940800,4,240,4.042553191489362
1994573,4,B0001EQIGK,"Word Life is John Cena's personalized DVD. It shows Cena's process through the WWE. Now if you don't like Cena's freestyle's or battle raps then you shouldn't buy it. Now the ""Movie"" is only 45 minutes long but with the extra's and easter eggs it becomes three hours. The movie is mostly Battle Raps and Freestyles but a good thing is if you want to see the matches that the freestyles led upto then go to the extras. I think the raps and freestyles are really funny and the matches are pretty good on a scale from 1 to 10 I give them:

vs. Chris Benoit 7/10 Winner JC

It is a suprise ending!

vs. Brock Lesnar 8/10 Winner BL

JC comes close to winning but loses at the last minute.

vs. The Undertaker 7/10 Winner Taker

Good match and good effort by JC

vs. Eddie Guerrero 8/10 winner JC

Great match

vs. Kurt Angle 5/10 winner KA

JC TAPS OUT!

The other stuff is also really good

Movie: 7/10

Matches: 7/10

1994574,5,B0001EQIGK,As a die hard Cena fan I love this video. I love the freestyles and matches. The extras were hysterical although I would have loved to see the Matt Hardy one included. I have a feeling that the next one will be even better due to all that he has accomplished since this one.,1092528000,,274,4.092592592592593
1994575,3,B0001EQIGK,"Now I have to admit I do like John Cena. I think he is funny and a hell of a competitor but it is a little too soon to put out a dvd about him. There is nothing in this dvd that really makes you excited that you bought this dvd in the first place.
It is just a bunch of his freestyles that you have already seen on tv. Oh and hey the extras aren't that good either.
Here are the matches on the dvd:
1. vs chris benoit
this match is good and Benoit is great but this match wasn't too exciting. 7/10
2. vs Brock Lesnar
A ok match with the monster, and had some dominating moves by Lesnar. Seemed to drag ona bit. 8/10
3. vs Undertaker
I thought this match was gonna be the one from Vegeance but it was already a match I saw on Smackdown. I was very dissappointed because I thought it was a ppv match but it was just aregular tv match. It was still good. 9/10
4. vs eddie Guerrero
Another match I thought was gonna be different. I thought it was gonna be their parking lot brawl. But it was their match the week beforethat match. An ok match, but nothing to jump up and down over. 7/10
5.vs Kurt Angle
A fantastic matchup,kurt and John put all their effort into this match. 10/10
In closing, this dvd was not that good because it was released too early in Cena's career. Cena hasn't had to many gimmick matches the only gimmick match I've seen in him was the lumber jack match. When he starts doing cage and hell in a cell matches then thats when you make a dvd about someone. An ok buy just don't expect too much . WORD LIFE",1086134400,3,1522,4.026402640264027
1994576,2,B0001EQIGK,"The only reason why WWE made this DVD was to capitalize on how over John Cena is on the fans. John Cena's had a limited career at the time this DVD was made, so not many note worthy matches. The ""special features"" weren't that great either.

Get it if you must, but it's not really worth it. WWE should have waited until after Wrestlemania 20 to even think about making a John Cena DVD.",1085356800,9,386,4.216216216216216
