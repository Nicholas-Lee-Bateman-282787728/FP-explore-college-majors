2681793,4,B000K2UDAK,"Interesting film - lots of good footage of the ""sky clad"" sadhus.  My only concern - the film seemed to be a bit repetitive, as if it could have been shorter and not lost very much.  I'm very interested in Hinduism, and especially in Shaivite monasticism, and was glad that I bought this film",1182816000,2,292,4.388888888888889
2681794,5,B000K2UDAK,"A wonderful documentary on a lifestyle that is mind-blowing piece of humanity's cultural heritage.

in India there are 13 million yogis, saddhus, and babas, out of a 1 billion population. Some of them are standing babas who never sit or lie down for decades. Other keep their right arm raised continuously for years. Only a very few of them do any kind of fancy asana, beyond plain old half lotus or tailor sitting.

The main focus is Shiv Raj Giri, as he and his tiny band of disciples, including 14-year-old boy  Santosh Giri, treks around between Hardiwar and the Himalayan foothills and the Kumbh Mela mega-festival. They wear no or little clothes, they smear their entire bodies with ash, they love the Ganga river. All yogi's in this movie, no yogini's. In many ways they are like homeless people the world over, though they seem a bit more content (Don't believe me about that homeless reference? Read quotes below). It also covered aghori yogi's, who live at the cremation sites full-time, and a number of others.

I could see, as the small band was filmed wandering all over Northern India, how the rest of India was kind of growing up around them, beginning to get overdeveloped with new buildings, power lines, concrete sluices in the rivers, etc. It gave them a melancholy air. Later on Shiv Raj commented on this very point, saying that the government wanted to clear out a lot of old temples and sacred natural areas, and put hotels and parking lots on them. Sad.

One other tiny group is just a duo, Hanuman Das and Barfani Das. They form an interesting pair because the lone disciple's legs are wasted, and he cannot walk. Therefore, the guru carries him everywhere they go, on his shoulders. They live in a small tent by a river and spend their days collecting driftwood for their fire. And of course chanting and so on.

Quotes from the Yogis:

""We are hermits and we will give our life for the sake of our souls.""

""I have stood  for 12 years to get peace in my soul.""

""After one sees the Supreme Lord, this whole world is like insects, whatever you see is worms.""

""The trees are being cut down. In the near future we will be scorched by the heat. We know Mother Ganga (river) comes for 5000 years. Now 3500 years are gone, and 1500 years should remain. But due to cutting trees, the time will be much shorter. Mother Ganga will go away from us soon. Clean pure air will also become rare.""

""The earlier life ends, the better.""

""We humans need vessels to eat. Just so, the gods need human vessels for their feeding. So man is like a vessel to god.""

""Shiva is Lord of the Homeless, King of the Himalayas.""

""The body has no reality.""

""Even after becoming a yogi, there is no peace.""

""It is not easy to go to the Parliament to voice your opinions without clothes.""

""I pulled a fully loaded jeep for 1 kilometer with my [...]. This [...] control is not easy. No [...] control, no good holy man.""

""Every human has 10 senses.""

""Today the population of yogi's is going down. in another 50 years you will hardly hear the word 'yogi'.""

""When the body suffers one remembers god. For devotion one needs one of two things: either fear or suffering.""",1175990400,27,3167,4.521052631578947

2681796,5,B000K2UDAK,"The recently released film documentary `Naked In Ashes' directed by Paula Fouce is an absolutely breathtaking up close and personal look into the hearts and minds of the modern day Holy Men of India. Travel up and down the River Ganges and meet a variety of yogis, sadhus, gurus and sages as they dispense wisdom and forgiveness to mankind by performing austerities and rituals in an effort to combat the current dark age known as the Kali Yuga.

I simply cannot say enough good things about this amazing production. The urban and rural cinematography is gorgeous, the interviews are insightful and filled with wisdom, and the camera positioning is so close you feel as though you're on the spiritual journey as a participant, not a viewer.

An added and unexpected plus in this documentary are some pointed, timely, possibly prophetic comments concerning the political climate of the country, the ongoing impact of the Kali Yuga on present day spirituality and the envisioned decline of ascetic life in India in the next fifty years. These insights interspersed here and there amongst the wonderful spiritual teachings conveyed in this film make 'Naked In Ashes' a truly intelligent, accessible, unique and important documentary.

The film also contains a mesmerizing Indian soundtrack that adds intensity and wonder to the already exotic atmosphere.

My Highest Recommendation!",1170547200,49,1379,5.226244343891403
2681797,5,B000K2UDAK,"Teaching yoga these days in the ""west"", can be a challenge for a true Yogi. People want to simply do their Yoga-workout. Not many wonder how the Yogis of India live and do their routine...

I just had to find out... because when you learn what the real Yogis of India do, how they do their yoga and meditation and how they give up worldly things, and more... I mean, they do things, some of us would never...and it may seem very extreme...

Yet one thing is clear....they have discipline...something most of us do not have anymore....

I can only recommend to watch this film... and also ""Origins Of Yoga"" (which is more about where Yoga came from)... Both these films will make you think...If you are into yoga, even just a little...or into countries like India, or into spiritual things, history, etc... You gotta get it and watch it.. it's well worth it, it's informative...the picture quality is outstanding...such deep beautiful colors....and the music is very beautiful and fits so perfectly.... It's def. on my list of must-see films....and it's def. one of my favorite documentaries.....",1164585600,24,1095,4.8449197860962565

2681809,5,B000K2UDAK,"This was a GREAT doc. More important than most people can appreciate. It focuses directly on the key problem of the human condition - how to heal The Human Birth Defect: i.e., our spiritual emptiness. The total commitment of the yogis in the doc to finding a way to heal shows that pathetically materialistic Americans are a million miles away from even getting the problem. If these yogis had a fire on their heads, they couldn't be more dedicated to putting it out.
Taking the Yogi Quest seriously, how would modern science explain what the yogis are seeking? If we knew that, then maybe we could re-design our methods of seeking. Maybe complete rejection of materialism isn't necessary, but only some moderate adjustment of attitude. Perhaps we can get the message, w/o having to copy their methods.

I find yoga and its origins interestig, at least I thought.....The film was strange and I really just didn't like it.  I had no idea about some of the things that they did and I don't really see the point of standing on on leg until it swells up to an unrecognizable limb, pulling a vehicle with your penis, or surrounding yourself with animal dung.  Perhaps that is closed minded, but it's just my opinion.  I continue to like the yoga practice for its physical and mental benefits, just did not enjoy this film.",1314230400,5,644,4.333333333333333
2681811,5,B000K2UDAK,"If you are looking for in depth information on the practice of Puja, Dhyana, Pranayama, Raja Yoga, Hatha Yoga, etc... you will have to look else where. Likewise if your only experience with Yoga has been at the local recreation center or YMCA you may be disappointed.

If you are interested in Yoga as a Mystical Religion, then this film will absolutely uplift your soul and inspire you to new heights within your own spiritual practice. It offers a rare darshan for Western Yogis living a long way from the shores of India.

This film will share with you the very heart of Yoga and give you a glimpse into the life style of the Naga Babas. You will meet many Yogis and even a Yogini, here are a few quotes;

""You can not become a Yogi by wearing some robes, you can not become a Yogi by just wanting to be one, you can only become a Yogi by the mercy of the Lord.""

""The life of a Sadhu is meant for doing good to other living beings.""

""You will not see God through these eyes, the third eye will open through Yoga.""

""It is a saints duty to try to attract people to the good and try to help overcome evil.""

""All prayer is beneficial""

""You Can Find God.""

""We do get donations but we try to live our lives as simply as possible, when we do have money as often as we spend it we give it away.""

""By doing all these Yoga Asanas I attract people and then I preach to them.""

I highly recommend this film to all Western Yogis.

2681812,4,B000K2UDAK,"I wasn't quite certain what to expect from this film, but it was much more entertaining than I would have guessed.  The film follows the day to day life of the Indian yogis, babas, gurus ect. that live their life devoted to attaining nirvana or enlightenment.

At first glance you see groups of men living along side the river Ganges.  From a western perspective it appears to be alot of homeless wild looking men just trying to stay alive.  However, as you follow their lives you start to see how profound their spiritual journey really is.  These men give up all to practice meditation, and learn about themselves and their place in the universe.  Through their practice they then serve as holy men to the people of India.

This documentary includes footage of their yearly pilgrimages through Himalayas and the Kumbh Mela festival, where thousands of holly men from all over the region come to practice and share ideas.

An eye opening an humbling experience to say the least.  It makes one realize very quickly that whatever personal sacrifices the rest of us make for our belief systems, do not compare with the life that the holy men in India have chosen for themselves.",1253318400,2,1176,4.7254901960784315

2681815,5,B000K2UDAK,"While this documentary was not quite what I had expected, I was intrigued, inspired and amazed by this group of wandering yogis.  When I ordered it, I thought it would cover a more varied experience of individuals and territory.  Though this film covers a small spiritual group of men in one particular area - magnify this in your mind, if you can, to 13 million.  India is a country of one billion people! Of these, there are at least 13 million holy people who have devoted themselves entirely to the Divine! and each day whether they eat or do not eat, where they lay their heads - all is relied upon Divine gift and the generosity of fellow believers.  It is a beautiful film and deeply touching.

There is so much detail in this film, it should be watched several times I feel.  Also, I would venture to recommend it to those who have some degree of familiarity with Indian religions, esp. Hindu (even if the familiarity is only slight, it would give a better basis for understanding what the film portrays).",1220832000,,1013,4.538461538461538
2681816,3,B000K2UDAK,"Naked in Ashes is a good dessert, loads of tasty sugar with little nutritional value.

Filmmaker Paula Fouce presents amazing documentary footage of India's yogis, loin-clothed mystics roaming the countryside in search of God and enlightenment.  If you ever thought your yoga workout at the suburban studio was tough, try standing for 12 years, or holding your hand above your head for 30.  If that's too extreme, you might try walking around naked smeared in ash, sitting meditation with a plate of raging fire on your head, or maybe pulling a car with your genitalia.  These guys are dead serious.

Fouce, though, seems anything but, at least for the viewer who is not already a committed Hindu.  The yogis talk quite a lot about God, the soul, enlightenment, and ultimate reality, but these statements amount to little more than a collection of non sequiturs.  Nothing adds up.

A number of questions are left unasked.  Where are the yoginis, the female practitioners?  How many of these yogis are imposters?  How many become yogis simply because they've become addicted to the marijuana high, or  to escape social and familial obligations?  How many give up the life after a short time?

Watch this like you might a slideshow, for the beautiful imagery. Don't expect to learn much.
