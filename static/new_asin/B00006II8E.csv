This is one of my favorite cartoons as a child, and this dvd only has a handfull of episodes. WE NEED FULL SEASON BOXSETS OF THIS SHOW AMAZON, PLEASE! Buena Vista Home Entertainment has the rights to this show, and they simply refuse to release it on Season boxsets. You did a good job by getting Nickelodeon shows, please try to make a deal with them. I know that it would sell.",1222819200,27,464,4.344827586206897

1776699,1,B00006II8E,"I read all of the spederman reviews and everyone said that just becasue this is spiderman it doesn't mean tht it is for children.  So I went to buy the one that had a G rating.  This is is way to violent for young children.  I had to turn it off, so please do not be fooled by the ""G"" rating.",1178496000,9,292,3.7540983606557377
1776700,5,B00006II8E,Marvel made many inroads with comics. They added a depth of character development that was always handled with great care. That care is plainly visible with their animation and very much so with Spider-man. I was amazed as I viewed this to discover how very close the motion picture followed the script of the animated Goblin story. I believe anyone who enjoyed the motion picture or the comic would also like the animated show.,1151539200,,428,4.797297297297297
1776701,4,B00006II8E,"The episodes aren`t too good,but the dvd quality is great! The dvd has special features like a trivia game where you try and save Mary Jane,Stan Lee`s Soapbox,a classic episode from the Spider Man 60`s show,and more! I also was surprised and glad that it has scene selection,set up,and more! A Spider Man fan would probably love this,so definately reccomended for fans of Spidey!

1776702,3,B00006II8E,"Buena Vista has released another DVD that compiles the 90's animated Spider-Man series, this time to coincide with the DVD of the theaterical feature. While there are many negatives to this release, the overall package is one that fans will want to snag along with the movie.
I'm still baffled as to why the episodes are being packaged this way. The series consisted of many story arcs that ran through multiple seasons, and should not be chopped up and grouped like this. In fact, one episode here doesn't feature the Goblins as prominent villains, and another omits them entirely. Their inclusion on this disc is to help tie up the loose ends of the story, but since the title of this disc is ""The Return of the Green Goblin"", they seem out of place.
However, it's nice to see that even if Buena Vista is releasing compilations, the episodes are all in sequence. This ensures a bit of continuity should the rest of the series be eventually released. There are also some pretty cool extras, including a fifth episode (even though it's out of order), another episode of the classic 1967 series, interviews with Stan Lee, and a mini game that's actually fun to play; my friend and I learned some things from the mini game about Spider-Man that we never knew before. Plus, unlike the ""Ultimate Villain Showdown"", the episodes on this disc are some of the high-points of the series and should not be missed.
Plans have already been made to release another DVD featuring the Spider-Man/Daredevil team-up episodes to coincide with the movie when it arrives next year. This is good reassurance that more episodes will be released, and an incentive to buy this DVD. While the compilation format is dubious, the overall quality of the episodes along with the good extras and cheap price means that no Spidey fan should pass this disc up.",1036195200,20,1829,4.754716981132075
1776703,4,B00006II8E,"I'm proud to say that this DVD edition is cool. It has some of the best episodes from the series...all in order from their original air dates. Although there are only 2 episodes with the Green Goblin and that they forgot the other episode where Harry Osborne becomes the Green Goblin, the DVD is still worth the purchase. I would have preferred that they released the DVD's by season like ""Friends"" & ""Buffy..."" but if your like any major Spider-Man fan...it's worth spending the cash!",1035849600,3,485,4.7176470588235295

1776724,2,B00006II8E,"These are some decent episodes (despite the fact that they are heavily censored and Spider-Man rarely punches his opponents in this series). Like other Spidey fans, I'm upset at the fact that they didn't just release the entire series. There are too many episodes I want that they didn't release, like the Secret Wars, the two part episode when he fights Hobgoblin for the first time, Insidious Six, and Mutant Agenda. What I don't understand is that they released the entire X-Men, Fantastic 4, and Iron Man Series, but not Spider-Man?",1427241600,3,536,4.9010989010989015

1776729,3,B00006II8E,"I would have given 4 stars if this were an entire season but it is only 4 episodes. Just bear that in mind. Until this series gets released in its entirety I would recommend avoiding these dvd releases and getting The Spectacular Spider-Man Complete Series blu ray instead. Just my 2 cents. Oh, and for the love of god, please don't buy or watch Ultimate Spider-Man. It is grade A garbage. Seriously. And I'm referring to the show, not the comic. The comic is amazing.",1401062400,2,468,4.517647058823529

1776731,5,B00006II8E,"This is the best of the Spider Man versions; of the comics and of the movies.  Peter Parker is drawn as a gorgeous, built guy, but conservative to the 'outer world.'

39.  The Spot:  Ex-employee of Stark Industries, Dr. Jonathan Ohn, invents a portable interdimensional technology that accidentally makes him the living embodiment of a portal. Calling himself the Spot, he tries to steal money to fund his research. But his unstable invention has created a vortex that threatens to engulf New York.  I'm in the minority, but I liked this episode.  B

40.  Goblin War!:  The Green Goblin and the Hobgoblin clash over Dr. Ohn's Time Dilation Accelerator.  The clash I've wanted to see since the Green Goblin's introduction.  A+

41.  Turning Point:  Norman Osborn, still with the Goblin in control tries to use the Transporting device to find out Spider-Man's secret identity.  This is one of my top 5 Spider-Man episodes ever.  A+

42. Guilty:  Tombstone, whilst incarcerated in Rooker's Island, plots revenge on Robbie Robertson as Robbie previously caused his arrest. In exchange for assisting cell-mate Richard Fisk in a few brawls in prison, Richard requests that his father, The Kingpin, frame Robbie as a criminal mastermind.  This is a great episode that shows a good side to J. Jonah Jameson.  A

Bonus episode:  49.  The Return of the Green Goblin:  Harry Osborn is haunted by dreams of his father, the Green Goblin, and Spider-Man. The Goblin visits him and guides him to the Goblin formula and weapons. Meanwhile, The Punisher promises Anna Watson that he will find Mary Jane, and top of his list of suspects is...Peter Parker?!  This is a great episode to round out the disc.  A",1366243200,6,1578,4.976923076923077

1776738,5,B00006II8E,"These five episodes are contained on one DVD along with two episodes from the original 1967 animated TV series.

The Sins of the Fathers Chapter XII ""The Spot""
The Sins of the Fathers Chapter XII ""Goblin War""
The sins of the Fathers Chapter XIV ""Turning Point""
Partners In Danger Chapter I ""Guilty""
Partners in Danger Chapter VIII ""The Return of the Green Goblin""

Where do I start? All I can say is: Wow! The animation of this TV series was phenomenal. I remember watching it as a kid in the 1990s and was nothing but enthralled by the color and art direction. But it was the storylines that truly drew me. This is where the series excelled. ""The Spot"" was my favorite episode from this DVD. It showcased a hard working scientist who was never appreciated until the King Pin came and gave him funding. Ohm fell in love with a fellow scientist, Dr. Lopez. When an accident gives the Dr. Ohm temporal powers, he uses his powers to do an end run around the demanding King Pin. Unfortunately there is an accident that puts the world in danger. Working together, he and Spiderman are only just able to prevent a catastrophe, but in the end, Dr. Ohm sacrafices himself to save Earth. Not wanting to live without him, Dr. Lopez throws herself in his arms, thus sharing his doom.

The episodes involving Green Goblin were fantastic, especially ""The Goblin War."" This DVD is best seen along with The Ultimate Villain Showdown Box Set.

You can't go wrong when buying this DVD.
