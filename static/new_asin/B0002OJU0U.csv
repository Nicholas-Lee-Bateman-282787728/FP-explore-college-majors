2110494,5,B0002OJU0U,"Not sure how or if this show was broadcast in the US. Here in Norway they called it 'En Selvsam Sjappe', which translates into 'a pequiliar, or weird, shop'. Weird and pequiliar it sure was! But also really, really wonderful. Few shows have made me laugh so much recently.

I got into Black Books, not on Norwegian tv, but in advance, on DVD from the UK. I knew nothing about it, but I knew plenty about Bill Bailey who plays 'Manny' on the show. Bill's early BBC comedy show was shown on BBC Prime, and I really fell for his brand of humour. When he performs as a stand up, he utilises his skills not only with his gob, but also his gift as an accomplished musician. Playing keyboards and guitar, he lays into Chris DeBurgh (the greatest of evil), U2's the Edge and even the BBC news signature tune. A french police siren will never sound the same, after watching Bill Bailey.

Dylan Moran was more of an unknown to me, however, I recognised him from the movie Notting Hill, and I was amused, that he who played a book thief in Hugh Grant's travel bookshop, would go on to play the owner of a bookshop himself. If you love angry, gruff, alcoholic irishmen, then you really need to see this! Dylan have two stand up DVD's out in the UK.

Then there's Tamsin Greig. I knew nothng about her before seeing this, but she really grabs you. Intense and brooding, she is so far removed from any females in any american sitcoms, it's a treat just to watch her. If you can't get enough of her, I really recommend the later series she made in the UK; Green Wing.

If you get this, I can promise you lots of belly laughs, as Black turns poor Manny into a suffering slave. You'll see customers treated so bad, they would WISH they were stuck in Kevin Smiths Clerks, just to get away and have a break. Can't come up with a good reason to open a bottle of cheap wine? Well, there should be enough suggestions on this set of DVD's!

Fans of Simon Pegg's Spaced, Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, wouldn't want to miss the 3rd season opener, where Manny meats a whole different breed of boss.

2110495,5,B0002OJU0U,"The joy of discovering a great series once it is finished always feels a little bittersweet.  There is 1% of me that regrets not being aware of it during its first run and promoting it to all my friends and family.  But this is often outweighed by the delight of having the entire collection at my fingertips and Black Books is no exception.

Although ""Grapes of Wrath"" from Series One is my personal all-time favourite, there is little doubt that Series Two is the strongest as a whole.  Series Three has a lot to live up to but even the worst season of the three is better than 90% of shows on TV.  Highly recommended.",1154217600,2,620,4.356521739130435
2110496,5,B0002OJU0U,"The main character of this show, Bernard Black, an angry Irishman, owns a book shop and is aided by ever-helpful odd doormat,Manny, while local shop-owner Fran keeps them both in order with her no-BS attitude.

This witty series really utilises British humour by throwing these characters into different situations. Episode highlights include the episode where Manny warns Bernard that if the temperature is too high he goes nuts (so, of course, Bernard does as much as he can to overheat the man); Fran bets Bernard that her friend's hen's night will be fun; Manny's oddball parents come to town; and Bernard gets locked out of his shop and wanders the streets.

For a fairly short series it manages to cover a lot of ground with a carefree attitude and the routine ""everything will be back to normal next week"" that shows like the simpsons employ (which allows for an abundance of possibilities of what could happen to the trio).

The delivery of the actors and the unique situations they're put in (plus a dash of monty python humour) makes this show another impressive slice of British television.",1145577600,2,1101,4.877005347593583
