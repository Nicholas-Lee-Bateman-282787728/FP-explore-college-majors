8269691,5,B0018FPHNQ,Love these yoga routines after bike rides.  They make all the tight area feel so much better,1440720000,,92,4.411764705882353
8269692,4,B0018FPHNQ,"Either I can't navigate a DVD menu - or there is not much of an introduction or an overview anywhere on this DVD. There is a trailer for an earlier (part I) version of this series on this DVD. That trailer seems to show how the yoga exercises relate to cycling (and to each other) better than what I saw on the part-II DVD. The DVD just starts with references to certain poses - as if you already know what they are. Maybe, seriously, I missed something when ordering this DVD - that says that you need to own the part-I DVD before buying this one. I had the impression prior to ordering that the part-I DVD was for mountain bikers and the part-II DVD was for road cyclists. The DVD may be OK when actually performing the poses - I have only had a chance to preview the product so far.

The insructor in the video does seem engaged and has a nice delivery style.

8269693,4,B0018FPHNQ,"I bought this DVD because I found their first one to be so good.  This one is too.  You can choose from many different routines - warm ups, recovery and strengthening.  I find the verbal instructions to be very good for reminding you how to do the various poses well.  I would recommend this for anyone interested in yoga - not just cyclists.",1224288000,3,342,4.380952380952381
8269694,4,B0018FPHNQ,I purchased this DVD with a little knowledge of Yoga from a few classes. The poses and instructions are easy to understand in this video. Some of the workouts aren't too long to lose interest or become bored. Highly recommended for beginners or someone looking for a quick workout. The DVD does offer a longer workout that I have yet to try.,1218412800,3,341,4.516129032258065
