Watching all the seasons again brings back great memories from childhood and is also creating the same with new additions to the family. Also, the buyer that it was purchased from sent it in a timely manner and in the condition promised.",1317686400,,354,4.378787878787879
4514903,5,B0050KTMVI,"Mr Ed was a great show throughout ALL five and a half seasons it was on. I agree with others that Shout Factory should let Amazon.com stock this season and they would probably sell alot more, but I don't think they should give the show a bad rating for that. The ratings should be reserved for the show itself, not the screwballs that happen to own the rights to it. Anyway, buy this and all seasons and you won't be sorry for owning a great part of television history.",1313280000,18,469,4.280898876404494
4514904,1,B0050KTMVI,"Why doesn't the studio or distributor of Seasons 4 & 5 of Mister Ed just let Amazon sell these sets? If they would like to see the sales go UP on them, they would benefit from doing so, which should drop the price closer to the first 3 seasons... I'd buy them right now if they did and I'm sure a lot of others would too. I'm sure I'm not the only one who's held out on this and I have no intentions on buying unless Amazon does the selling. Same goes for the last 2 released seasons of Ironside.",1312761600,32,496,3.97

4514912,5,B0050KTMVI,"I have always loved this clever TV series sitcom and am in the process of collecting all of the seasons made available/dvd.  The comedy portrayed in this classic series far surpasses that of current sitcoms now seen on TV.  I have been searching for the final Season Six  of ""Mister Ed"" but to no avail.  Since Seasons 1-5 have been made available/dvd, why not complete the series by releasing Season Six???  There are many ""MIster Ed"" enthusiasts out there that would like to purchase the sixth and final season, so I am hoping that 'Shout! Factory' will someday logically comply and please release it to dvd, even if restoration of this final season becomes a tedious/time-consuming task.  If 'Shout! Factory' does not intend to ever release the final season than please, please consider selling the rights to another company that would be interested in the restoration/release of season six to the public.  Thank You!",1379635200,,920,4.935064935064935

4514921,5,B0050KTMVI,"Mister Ed is a horse. He is possibly the most famous horse in the world, due to his show's six-season run that has been constantly replayed in syndication for over half a century. But what do we really know about Mister Ed?

He is impetuous. He's single-minded in purpose. He's a tad lazy, loving to both sleep and eat. He doesn't like heavy riders. He's a Palomino who claims to be eight years old. He's a hypochondriac. He reads the newspaper, comic books and a select number of magazines. He loves watching the late movie show on his portable 60's era television. He has a real eye for the fillies. He loves carrots. He remains actively engaged with the ASPCA. And, oh yes, he can talk.

But, he only talks to Wilbur. Actually, that's not quite true, even though Mister Ed constantly repeats that claim to Wilbur (""You know I only talk to YOU!""). Mister Ed shows little to no hesitation in using the telephone to phone-order some dalliance, contact the ASPCA with a complaint, or eavesdrop on the telephone party line to catch the local gossip. (Mister Ed loves to eavesdrop on gossip, so we should add that to the above list.) All this means that, indeed, Mister Ed actually DOES talk to quite a number of people, but only when he can do so without revealing his equine identity (the exception is that he will, on occasion, talk to kids, because, in Ed's own words, ""Who'll believe a kid, anyway?""). But with Wilbur Post, Mister Ed's owner, he's as garrulous a horse as you'll ever find.

And speaking of talking, did you perhaps notice the very thing that is so obvious that you might never think about it: Mister Ed's very first word to us, in every single episode, is ""Hello!"" ""Hello! I'm Mister Ed."" The first word of each show, then, breaks Ed's own rule, because he speaks to each of us while we look at him, standing in his stable. (Cool piece of subterfuge, huh?)

Like many people in the United States, I grew up watching Mister Ed. (His name is always presented as ""Mister Ed,"" without abbreviated spelling, never as ""Mr. Ed."") As a child, the show enchanted me and made me feel like I was part of a special, magical universe. When my wife and I recently started watching the episodes on DVD, I hadn't seen the show for decades, and I wondered if I could enjoy it as much as my memories would lead me to believe. But it was easy to see right from the start that the magic was still there. I admit to being caught off guard by this: the thought of a grown man my age watching a show that ostensibly was aimed at children seemed to be an exercise that would end in boredom and a perhaps create a little dent on my childhood reminiscences.

But the magic is still there. There is absolutely something special about this most special of shows. It's engaging. It's funny. It's even sometimes thought provoking. And much like the original Andy Griffith Show, there's even an occasional lesson about life woven into the story.

The horse Mister Ed is simply gorgeous, even by horse standards. His face is the envy of horses everywhere, and the director and filing crew found a way to bring out Ed's beauty in most every scene. As a Palomino, Mister Ed is a golden chestnut brown, but for reasons that I can't fully explicate, he is best portrayed on the ""silver"" screen. It's also apparent from watching these shows afresh as an adult, that Wilbur (Alan Young) was genuinely fond of Mister Ed, and Mister Ed fond of him. That very real affection clearly shows in many episodes: it's not something that can be ""acted"" over such a long period of time. Mister Ed (real name, Bamboo Harvester), too, was an exceptionally intelligent animal who was able to do tricks and tasks that likely would have been much more difficult, or sometimes, impossible, for other horses to learn, and these skills are put to great use in the show, often with few filming cuts, or other camera trickery.

So, what is it about this show that makes it so special, and that has kept it in constant play around the world for now over half a century? We'll, it's in part the magic of the concept. Mister Ed as the prankster who is always getting Wilbur into trouble because he has called on the phone to order new furniture for his stable, or to call the ASPCA because he's not getting enough carrots. Or by sabotaging Wilbur's guests at the house because Mister Ed is missing out on the daily attention he insists upon. Or stealing Addison's delicious homegrown apples from the backyard using a variety of increasingly sophisticated techniques but nearly always found out.

Perhaps also it is watching Mister Ed carry out and execute tasks that make you wonder how it could have been done. He was a truly talented horse, and some of these actions are mesmerizing, even for horse aficionados that know all about horses from first-hand contact.

And, undeniably, Mister Ed's gorgeous face is enough to steal every single scene--and I mean every single one in which he appears--regardless of who else is present. Maybe this, too, is one of the reasons for the enduring nature of the show. Mister Ed is so gorgeous that it is hard to understand why he ultimately has so much trouble with the fillies. But it is hilarious to watch Ed with his passing love interests, sometimes resulting in Ed demanding height-increasing horseshoes (because the filly he likes is taller than he), and other times prompting him to change his diet to shed a few pounds so he'll be able to complete with the other suitors aiming for the same filly.

As a kid, the show entranced me with it's magic of a talking horse, and as an adult, I still find that impact, but I now as an adult note that one of the things that makes the show laugh-out-loud funny at points is the biting sarcasm and the great one-liners that Mister Ed constantly uses. The writing for Mister Ed's dialogue is simply excellent. How can an adult sit there and laugh at this? But you will. Mister Ed comes up with some truly hilarious lines, often delivered with defiance and irony. This is undoubtedly one of the reasons the show works so well: the deep and droll delivery of Mister Ed's lines (voiced by the un-credited Allan ""Rocky"" Lane) works so well and is so engaging that its difficult not to be hanging on every word.

As far as the technical quality of these DVD's, they are clear as anything, with only an occasional episode with less video quality (perhaps the master for those few episodes were lost). If you are watching these with an up-sampling DVD player and a flat screen TV, you're likely to be as amazed as I with the film clarity of the show. The sound track is general good, as well, with only an occasional imperfection on a couple of episodes. But for the vast majority of episodes, the video and audio are excellent. Mister Ed never looked so good.

Mister Ed is simply a delightful show. Don't worry about how they got his lips to move at just the right moments in extended conversations with nearly no camera cuts, or how Ed can call the house from the barn if the two phones are on the same line, or how Ed can type on the typewriter with a nose that would have simultaneously hit seven keys with each tap. Just accept it. It's magical. And it's not just for the kids. They will love it, but so will you.",1342742400,3,7255,4.521341463414634
4514922,5,B0050KTMVI,"Great TV Series a little more Expensive and harder to buy then series like Bewitched, I dream Of Jeannie etc. The Good thing at least it's available and on DVD and not rubbish material like DVD R. The set is like the season before all in pretty good picture as the series is near 50 years old. There is a few flickering I noticed, kind of strange as I only see that happen in poor weather that interfere with digital on a couple of episodes but they play.",1322956800,,455,4.181818181818182
4514923,5,B0050KTMVI,"The 5th Season oif MR ED pulled out all the special effects stops you could possibly do with a horse...very funny season. Short on intelligent plots but still very funny. This was the last good season and the last with neighbor Colonel kirkwoood. After this season the show brought in Carol's father but the show was out of ideas and was cancelled 13 episodes into the 6th season. Show was limited by being primarily for children by this time and by the limits of censorship in 1965 era. but get season 5 many funny episodes. I guess they will only release 13 episodes to complete the series on DVD ..and I hope at half the price since it is half a season. Pl FYI All seasons are uncut escept 8 prints from season one (thankfully of mainly unfunny episodes..why they used edited prints for those 8 episodes seems to have been a mistake they had the uncut films .but were unaware the prints they used were edited until AFTER they released the first season..oh well..and a Horse is a horse......I would love to see a POLITICAL remake of this show with the kind of raunchy and politcal comments from ED you could not get away with in 1965...EXAMPLE... Wilbur in front of neighbors ""MY friends I want to welcome all of you here tonight"" ED chimes in the background "" And  welcome All of you illegal border crossers  making my dinner.""  just an idea lol",1322870400,,1348,4.493877551020408
4514924,5,B0050KTMVI,"This is the penultimate season to Mister Ed. I have certainly enjoyed all five seasons and await the sixth and final season.
The show is very funny considering the premise that it is about a horse that talks. Sounds silly. But it isn't. All the family can enjoy it By now, Larry Keating who played the neighbor next door, had passed on and been replaced. His character of Addison was brilliant and was in some respects the highlight of the show. But this series is still great tv and a joy to watch. You'll believe a horse can talk.",1317859200,5,532,4.383838383838384

8451333,5,B0050KTMVI,"I just rediscovered this show and I find it to be very entertaining.  I remember loving it as a child and that hasn't changed a bit as I watch it now.  Mister Ed's personality provides constant sheer amusement.  Though he can be a very naughty horse, his heart is always in the right place as he always finds himself doing the right thing by the end of the episode often at Wilbur's expense.  Mister Ed's relationship with Wilbur is that of mutual respect and love as Wilbur spends more time with Ed than his own wife, much to her dismay.  Mister Ed is a beautiful horse with many talents from music writing to trivia games to chess playing.  His looks and many talents make him irresistible.  Wilbur just can't stay mad at him.  Ed is also a very sensitive soul.  He often threatens to run away, but always leaves a hint for Wilbur to find him, knowing Wilbur will go find him and beg him to come home.  From his witty sense of humor to his beautiful looks, lovable personality and adorable props, Mister Ed is just hard to stop watching over and over.  The show is truly a one of a kind that just never gets old and never goes out of style for people of all ages.",1492214400,,1165,4.273972602739726
