7866769,4,6304278837,"I would recommend this tape for anyone who needs more variety in their weighted workouts!  I have over 100 workout tape and this is a great one.  Kathy is a great instructor. It is fast-paced, so it doesn't take a lot of time, but still provides a good variety of weighted moves.  I would not use this tape as my main lifting tape, but it does add variety.
Remember however, YOU NEED TO DO YOUR OWN BICEP AND AB WORKOUT BECAUSE SHE DOES NOT INCLUDE THEM IN HER TAPE.",1043193600,6,466,4.213483146067416
7866770,4,6304278837,"I love Kathy Kaehler's videos so much, I bought other tapes choreographed by her (Cyndy Crawford and Claudia Shiffer).  She is just perfect to workout with.  Her voice is soothing and personable, that you feel like she's right there training you.  If you're looking for a full body workout, her it is....oh, except she doesn't work on the abs.  Her tape is not a typical aerobic workout but more so she does sets and repetitions; you don't feel like you're out of breathe by the end of the tape.  Also, she is such an inspiration I have read her ""Real World Fitness"" book.  Its a good motivation to keep up with those days you feel like you're not happy with yourself.  I want more Kathy Kahaeler books and exercise tapes!",998524800,9,722,4.507692307692308
