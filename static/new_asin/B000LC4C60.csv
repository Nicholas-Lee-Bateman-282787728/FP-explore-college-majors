2701806,5,B000LC4C60,"Emergency is one of my favorite shows.  I was thrilled when I saw that Emergency season three was going to be released on DVD.  The disc is 5 disc and singled sides, so I don't think we will have any problems.  I'm glad Universal got moving again.  I was worried that the other seasons would not be released.  All Universal has to do now is release Six Million Dollar Man and Bionic Woman on DVD.  Thanks again Universal and thanks to Amazon for setting such a great price for their TV Shows on DVD.  I would rate this show higher than 5 is I could.",1165017600,8,549,4.171428571428572

2701867,5,B000LC4C60,Before this show came on nobody knew what paramedics were and before it what helicopters can do as transport for patients. In the 70's when most of my friends were watching All in the Family I was watching Emergency.

2701901,4,B000LC4C60,"With two years together under their belts, the firefighters of LA County Station 51, featuring paramedics Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) and Johnny Gage (Randolph Mantooth), and the staff of Rampart Hospital, headed by Emergency Services chief surgeon Dr. Kelly Brackett (Robert Fuller), neurosurgeon Joe Early (Bobby Troup), and Head Nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London), are back saving lives (and occasionally losing them) in another season of the series that made ""paramedic"" a household word.  Some cases are humorous, like the pop-art sculptor who welds himself inside his latest masterpiece, or the eight-year-old boy who drank a whole pint of vodka (without knowing what it was).  Others are very hairy indeed, like the two motorcycle gangs who have a rumble and flood Rampart with casualtiesone of whom (who looks remarkably like Sam Elliott!) does his level best to strangle another and takes five men to bring him down.  And some verge on the personal, like the young policemana good friend of Johnny'swho's injured in a traffic accident and dies on the operating table because Brackett can't stop his bleeding, and leaves a young wife and small daughter.  51 pulls off rescues in some strange situationsa half-submerged rowboat, the bucket elevator in a rock quarry, a light plane that's crashed on a bluff above the sea, a woman who falls into an abandoned, boarded-over well in her back yardand is faced with a paint factory in full flaming eruption, fires at an oil refinery and a winery, and a young boy lost in a vacant building with fire creeping through the walls and a dust explosion threatening; Rampart deals with a young rock singer whose high-pressure schedule has intensified a case of pneumonia, which has in turn sent her into diabetic shock; squad and staff both are faced with the many casualties of a massive pileup on a fogbound freeway, the case of an eight-year-old boy who apparently tried to jump from a seventh-storey window ledge, and a young auto mechanic in a catatonic state whose tests are 100% negative.  Johnny becomes a (foster) father when a stray cat gets into the firehouse and delivers five kittens (including two little calico girls) on his bed, and the company plays host to a British observer, while station prankster Chet ""The Phantom"" Kelly (Tim Donnelly) conducts a water-bomb campaign against the hapless Gage.  Roy and Johnny, now fully comfortable with each other as partners, explore the possibility of starting a part-time floor-cleaning business and entering the department-wide contest to invent a new tool for firefighting work, and Roy, to his regret, accepts Johnny's invitation to stay at his apartment while the DeSoto house is being fumigated for termites.  Brackett, Dr. Morton, Johnny and Roy must do an open-air surgery to remove a high-explosive round from an anti-personnel grenade that has lodged near the kidney of a gun-collector and may go off at any second.  Bobby Sherman of Here Come the Brides appears as a young intern who's a medical whiz but not so good at relating to people (including paramedics), and Will Hutchins, the former Sugarfoot, as a recently born-again Christian father who's reluctant to allow his daughter to have rabies shots despite the fact that she was bitten by a dog.  And one Donald Mantooth (who doesn't look a bit like his (I presume) brother) has a bit part as a paramedic from another squad.  An uncredited guest is Larry Manetti, who in the next decade would play Rick Wright on Magnum, PI.",1429660800,,3491,5.003448275862069

2702020,4,B000LC4C60,"More medical drama and firefighting adventures await the Emergency! fan in this multi-disc set, which compiles all 22 episodes of the action series' 1973-74 Season.

Story-wise, there's not much change at either Rescue Squad 51's headquarters, which housed Los Angeles County Firemen Roy DeSoto (Randolph Mantooth) and Johnny Gage (Kevin Tighe), or at Rampart Hospital, home to Dr. Kelley Brackett(Robert Fuller) and Dr. Bobby Troup(Joe Early) and the head nurse Dixie McCall (Julie London), though Roy must decide whether to become an engineer or stay with the paramedics in ""The Promotion"" (Episode 7), and Troup's Dr. Joe Early discovers he has a heart condition in ""The Hard Hours"" (Episode 19).
But story arcs and character change wasn't the fuel that drove Emergency!; it was the rescues, and naturally, there are plenty to be found here, from a motorcycle gang war (season opener ""Frequency""), a rocker in a diabetic coma (Episode 4, ""An English Visitor"") and a singer who suffers a heart attack (Episode 12, ""Body Language"") to a footballer (Dick Butkus) who is tackled too roughly by his own son (""The Hard Hours"") and a magician who locks himself in a safe (Episode 14, ""Computer Error""). Guest stars rescued and treated by the regulars this season include a youthful Nick Nolte, Mariette Hartley, Happy Days' Donny Most, and '60s heartthrob Bobby Sherman.

Unfortunately, as with previous EMERGENCY! DVD releases, there are no extras, though the episodes are spread across 5 single-sided discs rather than on double-sided discs. .

Life goes on thanks to TV's life-saving paramedics team from Station 51 and the medical staff at Rampart Hospital in this complete 3rd Season collection on DVD. Includes Frequency"" (9/22/73), Computer Error"" (12/22/73), The Hard Hours"" (2/2/74) and 19 more for a total of 22 episodes on 5 DVDs

It's also nice to see this show complete & uncut & commercial-free as opposed to all those deleted scenes & added commercials you'd get when EMERGENCY was shown in reruns on ME-TV and TV Land.

BTW, I recently got word that Warner Bros. is releasing CHiPs-Season 3 out on DVD on March 3, 2015.",1389744000,,2131,5.05982905982906

2702175,5,B000LC4C60,"It's the early 70's and yet the creators of EMERGENCY boldly give us a black doctor, and a caring, yet-tough-as-nails head nurse.  EMERGENCY was indeed, ahead of it's time.

There are so many shows I loved as a kid. I have revisited many of these shows years later and found myself scratching my head in dismay that I could have EVER actually liked that!

Then you have EMERGENCY!

I was in grade school when I loved this show. I watched it religiously. Now fast forward 40 years into the future. I haven't watched EMERGENCY since the 1970's when it first came out. I have forgotten all the episodes and story lines. It's like I'm watching them all again for the first time.

I was a big fan of ER. You would think after ER with all its quality and realism, EMERGENCY, a spin-off show from ADAM 12 (Remember THAT???) wouldn't even remotely compare. That's what I thought.

Ok, granted, the show is dated. You can't get around this fact. There were no computers then, or cell phones. Digital did not exist. Everything takes longer. Even the phones are DIAL phones, not even the button variety. The cars all look like boats--it's laughable. The first season the ambulances look like white hearses. The hair styles...everyone looks like they just emerged from a hair salon--the men too. The nurses are all female with the funny paper hats, and most of them obviously wearing false eyelashes. There is no swearing. In the first season not one single person dies. The dialog is laughable in some places. And yet....

One thing that's cool about EMERGENCY--you're looking at real fires. Some of the scenes are actually quite amazing when you consider when this show was filmed. EMERGENCY simply WAS the ""ER"" of its day. It was the best television could offer, and in my view, ahead of its time.

By Season Three we see a bit more modern style vehicles. The ambulances look more like they do today, and so do the fire trucks. But people die sometimes. You have that little bit of added realism.

Strengths that carry through every season I've watches so far-- EMERGENCY is character driven. I defy anyone to try to watch this show and not fall in love with firemen paramedics Johnny and Roy, or laugh at Chet Desoto's practical jokes, or feel along with the head nurse Dixey. McCall.

ER was great, but EMERGENCY did it first. ER probably wouldn't have been what it was without this founding show which demonstrates the importance of strong, multi-faceted, FEELING characters.

You will be transported back in time in EMERGENCY. After you get through Season Two you will be used to the outdated styles of clothing, cars, technology and mentality. In a way Emergency is a time capsule in that respect. The 1970's get to live again. And though every now and then you'll be brought up short (when it comes to the attitudes/portrayal of women back then especially), much of the time you will forget the outdatedness of the show because you will be so caught up in the STORY.

I am again, to Season Four and so far not one story hasn't been exciting, funny, interesting, moving. EMERGENCY has still got it. If you loved ER, you need to experience this show that came first.

As for the quality of the DVDs--they are bar none. I feel, for the most part, like I'm watching them new again on TV. Season two, if I recall, had one episode that suffered a little deterioration in its quality--but that was the one exception I have seen so far, in all these great episodes.

Very HIGHLY recommend. I'm still a big fan of this show. I'm guessing now I'll always be.",1354665600,2,3545,4.624203821656051

2702177,5,B000LC4C60,"This season had two of my favorite episodes in it. Snakebite and Promotion. It was also, in my opinion, the season when the actors started to jell, the stories became more exciting and the characters started to *flesh* out. The stories were getting more exciting, focusing more on the firemen and the paramedics. That was something I liked because I found most of the hospital scenes to be boring. It's ironic that two relatively unknown actors stole the show away from the more established stars.

One of the great things about Emergency was the fact that it put EMS and paramedics into the consciousness of America. It, literally, changed the face of what emergency medicine was in this country and many others. That's quite a legacy for a series. And even more startling is the fact that it is still going strong after almost forty years and garnering new fans all the time.

I also love this show and this season in particular because it takes me back to a time in my life when I could still get excited about watching a show and make it must see t.v. every Saturday night.",1332460800,,1077,4.575129533678757

It's actually a TV show that I could watch with my 5 year old niece, because it's '70's sanitized'....blood is amusingly fake but the action is real. The show as a whole is a fine example of what TV was when it was all about making entertainment.

its fun, its entertaining, its exciting. It's a show that inspired  people to become firefighters and its a great reminder of just how advanced we've come in just a few decades. And sometimes it's just plain fun to play 'spot the famous guest star'",1331596800,,570,4.317757009345795

2702180,4,B000LC4C60,"Emergency! is still a great show, but I find myself wishing mightily for extras.

The masters used for copying these shows showed their age in some episodes as well.

It's clear that subtitles were done by different people, and, frankly, some of them weren't any good. Subtitles on specialty shows, like medicine and, presumably, law, can be hit-or-miss, and many of these are a miss. Good captioners/subtitlers exist for these, and some are here. Another, however, is terrible and simply invents things when he or she doesn't understand the dialogue. This leads to some amusing substitutions, such as ""sinkable"" for ""syncopal."" Closed captions are not included with any Universal DVD properties that I'm aware of, so good subtitles are doubly important.",1282435200,,980,6.205882352941177
2702181,5,B000LC4C60,"Season three is one of my most favorite out of all the seasons of Emergency! I keep going back to watch this one the most.  The cast has now really gelled and when you watch this you can see the chemistry between the cast.  This is the season that has the infamous ""Snakebite"" episode (where Johnny starts his own IV while on top of a fire engine after he was bitten by a rattlesnake while out on a run).  Another favorite episode of mine is ""Messin' Around"", where Johnny is the target of Chet's practical jokes.

As far as the DVD itself, I am happy that Universal decided to do away with the double sided discs in favor of the single sided disc.  But I wish they would have put on some extras. This show had such an impact on real life, and to not have *something* about that as an extra is a crime, in my opinion.  I also wished Universal would have kept the episode synopses and original air dates on the menu when you access each episode individually.  I also wish that they would have used the proper opening credits on all the episodes, rather than the opening credits featuring the infamous bi-carb thumb pop.  (I guess I'm just a stickler for accuracy.)  Some episodes have the right opening credit sequence and some do not.

In spite of those issues, I still highly recommend this DVD box set.  The episodes and how good they are far outweigh the issues with the DVD itself.",1275782400,3,1385,4.37109375
2702182,5,B000LC4C60,"This is a great set for a few reasons. First, the discs are single sided, unlike season 1.  The episodes in the third season are more interesting and exciting than seasons 1 and 2.  This season also starts the tradition of a really big fire at the end of the show.  The only down side of this set is that there are a few episodes where it seems like the producers of the DVD had to use TV distribution re-run prints, so there are a few episodes where the picture is not as clear and the sound is not quite as good, with the re-run introduction.  The majority of the episodes have beautiful picture quality and sound.  I am too young to remember this show when it first came on, but I really became hooked on it when TV LAND ran the show back in 99/2000.  If you like the show you really should collect all the DVDs.",1266969600,,815,4.1265822784810124
2702183,3,B000LC4C60,"I watched the show and even had a web site concerning the show and its impact on EMS.  There is so much we take for granted.  Who had the first paramedic squad in service is unknown (Pittsburgh? Miami? Atlanta (private firm)? This is in dispute. What is not disputable is the impact ""Emergency!"" had on ambulances and prehospital care.  I grew up in a suburb of Macon GA where we had no real fire protection until February 1975.  It was the late Seventies before we had paramedics and another few years before they were dispersed around the community.

I loved the DVD but felt some effort from MCA was needed to get away from the poor quality prints that some hucksters imbedded with the Season 5 theme song.  Regardless I thought the show was wonderful and the producers had a good way of making even Mike Morton, the grumpy intern, look like a protagonist.  As a kid I loved all of those characters.

I will likely advise Universal to come out with a special edition DVD. In it we would hear commentary from the remaining actors, production staff (Hannah Shearer, Ed Self)and principals in creating paramedic programs (J. Michael Criley MD, Eugene Nagel, MD, and the first paramedics in the US wherever they may be).  Sadly some greats left us.  These include producer RA Cinader, Jack Webb, Battalion Chief Jim Page, LA County Fire Department PIO Dick Friend, Walter Graf, MD, Peter Safar MD (principal in developing CPR), and Kenneth Hahn of the LA County Board of Supervisors). We need not procrastinate in capturing the memories, faces and voices of those who made it all happen.  I would be perfectly open to some genuine footage from the early years of paramedic programs.

(No longer are there separate ambulances that come to transport the patient to the hospital.) The scenery/costuming, etc. is also neat to me because it is so 70's. The special effects are cheesy because, again as an adult, I can tell it's not real, but to my eyes as a child, it was as real as could be. The actors, specifically Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe, have great chemistry and worked well together. Keeping in mind that the show was set in the era of sex, drugs and rock n'roll, it's a really good show. Has some comedy and lots of drama/action.

2702228,4,B000LC4C60,"The third season of Emergency continues following the activities of LA County's Fire Station 51, and Rampart General Hospital.  You never know quite what to expect on Emergency, as the flexible format allows for a mixture of accidents, rescues, firefighting, and medical situations.  Some routine, some extremely dangerous, and some completely off the wall.  The writers do a pretty good job of coming up with interesting and exciting situations and blending them with everyday life.

Paramedics are now a standard part of emergency services, but back then, the program was relatively new and evolving, and LA country's was one of the pioneers in the field.  The integration of paramedics into the fire department is at the heart of the series.  Paramedics John Gage (Randolph Mantooth) and Roy DeSoto (Kevin Tighe) are regular firemen with specialized medical training, working at the frontlines in this new field.  Of all the characters, we know the most about this likeable pair, but there isn't that much down time for either the firemen or the Rampart staff to get too personal.  The horn will soon sound, sending the squad off on another emergency call.

Season three has 22 episodes on five discs, including `The Hard Hours' where Dr. Joe Early (Bobby Troupe) faces his own medical crisis, `Fools' with Bobby Sherman as a cocksure physician new to the ER, `The Promotion' where Roy ponders taking a promotion that will force him to leave the paramedic program, and ""Frequency' where communications problems highlight a potential crisis",1203206400,,1542,5.136

I had a humidistat that was mounted on the cold air return of my furnace to control the humidifier attached to my furnace.  To keep the humidity regulated, I had to monitor the outside temperature and adjust the dial on the humidistat so that its dial matched a chart that came with the humidifier.  Kind of a pain so I purchased this unit.  It works like a charm, it monitors the outside temperature with a sensing element and adjusts the indoor humidity automatically.  It can also be run in a manual mode that doesn't use the sensor, but I found the automatic mode works best.

2702236,5,B000LC4C60,Saturday nights in the early to mid 1970s was appointment television for me. 8:00 p.m. Gage and Desoto. Emergency! Season 3 was an excellent season. The new firetruck debuts in episode 2. The best episode is the one where Gage gets bitten by a rattlesnake attending to victims hurt in an accident where a car goes down an embankment and has to be transported to Rampart on top of engine 51. Another great episode has Bobby Sherman as a young doctor who initially does not think too highly of paramedics until he spends a shift working with Gage and Desoto. Another highlight of Emergency is the joking around among the firemen and hospital staff. Remember the episode where Johnny tries to straighten out an error on his credit card bill. Does Gloria Truelove ring a bell to Emergency! fans? How about when Johnny and Roy buy the 1932 firetruck and Dixie asks them if they knew where she could pick up an old hospital cheap. The only way we Emergency! fans can ever see the show again is to buy the dvd so if you can only afford 1 season of the 3 that are available I would recommend season 3.,1182816000,,1093,4.442786069651741

I agree with the other criticism (i.e wrong opening theme, no scene info/index, etc), and it does seem clear that Universal did not put near as much effort into this release as they did the first two seasons.  But, these cutbacks are just a slight annoyance (-1 star).

If anything, I think I found season 3 more enjoyable to watch just because of the development of the characters and somewhat better acting and directing from the first two seasons.  Hopefully, Universal will step back up to the plate and make season 4's release with better polish...but I doubt it...nevertheless, I'll still pre-order it when its available!",1182729600,,759,4.684210526315789

When I opened the parcel I was a bit surprised to find no double DVDs any more, but single sided ones, which not even have a nice colorful label, but are rather kept simple - just white.

So far, I have watched the first DVD and parts of the second. Actually, the quality of the sound seems a bit worse than it was on the previous seasons, the image quality seems OK to me.

One minor gripe...Universal seems to have lost some of the 35mm Master negatives of Season 3. A few of the episodes were duped from 16mm. These are easy to spot as the titles open with the both Engine and Squad 51 leaving the station together. The 35mm ones have the squad, by itself, speeding down a street. You may have seen the 16mm dupes if you watched the series on TV Land in 1999, as this was what was available at that time.

Seasons 1 and 2 were all struck from 35mm negatives, and look better than when they originally aired on NBC.

""Snakebite"", on season 3, was struck from 35mm negative.",1173830400,,833,4.2594936708860756
2702262,5,B000LC4C60,"Okay Guys,

I am SO tired of ""ripping"" on Universal, but what is one to do when they spend their hard earned money on a poorly packaged product?  Furthermore, what is one to do when they are WAITING to spend their money on other shows that Universal won't release (Adam-12 & Dragnet)!  ARGHHHHHH!

While all three Emergency sets could have been put together much better, I still gave them a 5 star rating.  The content is worth it because Emergency is a true classic.  I was six years old in 1972 and I like the show just as much now as I did then.  John and Roy are the coolest.

I thought that I would mention one thing.  In watching the first episodes in season one, you may perhaps get a bit confused.  The set starts out with a pilot movie that is actually very good, however, is probably a bit different than the Emergency you remember.  Then, the first few episodes are just plain ""goofy!""  As with any show, the characters develop and evolve in their own way.  These first episodes are very ""stiff"" and not very well produced.  Don't worry, by the end of season one you will be rushing out to buy season two and three.

In season two, everything starts falling into place.  The show becomes more structured and the writing is MUCH better.  I have only watched 5 episodes from season three so far and absolutely love it.  At times, I have noticed that you find yourself much more interested in the personal interaction between the characters than you are the ""fire and rescue"" aspects of the show.  Season three also offers some really great comic relief that is NOWHERE to be seen in season's one and two.

2702265,4,B000LC4C60,"Emergency! seemed to hit its stride in season 3.  The characters, and the interplay among them, had been developed more fully.  The show's pace, which occasionally lurched in seasons 1 and 2, had become smooth.

I chuckled at some minor continuity gaps. Several times, a Ford ambulance picked up the victim at the scene, but a Chevy ambulance delivered the same victim to Rampart General. And in one episode, while showing Squad 51 rushing to the scene, they spliced in a clip of Squad 10 from the pilot episode -- that truck had entirely different styling.

Sadly, the film is in rough shape in some of these episodes.  For example, in one episode just after the open, the film jumps and you hear a pop.  You can clearly see scratches and splice marks appear and quickly disappear in other episodes.  Moreover, in several episodes for some reason the open from the final season was spliced in, usually a little clumsily.  I don't understand why they did this when the proper season 3 open was available from so many other episodes.  I'm a stickler for accuracy, I guess.

2702274,5,B000LC4C60,"Since I got this set a week ago, I have spent most of my spare time watching it. I keep telling myself, it's time to put the DVD away, only to find myself watching enough episode.

The best one to me is ""The Waiting Hours,"" about Dr. Early's double bypass (not a routine operation back in the 70's.) The fear and worry on Dixie's face is real (after all, Bobby Troup was Julie London's real-life husband.) Once again, clam chowder plays a role in this Jack Webb show(both Dragnet and Adam-12 also had episodes that featured it.)

Other highlights are ""Inferno"" and ""Fools"" (featuring Bobby Sherman as a cocky intern.) And who can forget Gage treating himself in the field after being bitten by a rattler in the brush? There's also the more lighthearted moments, like Chet besieging Gage with practical jokes. But even if the plot of the day sounds a bit silly, there's always one or two rescues that get the blood flowing (or the funny bone tickling.)

People are complaining about the quality of the DVD's. Generally, I don't think it's so bad considering the age of the shows. However, there are a few episodes (the ones with the ""Season 6"" credits) that are poor quality, especially the one with the abusive mom. Interestingly, the DVD's seem to bring out things that weren't intended to be noticed in the 70's. For example, at a 5-alarm fire, you can tell that Engine 5 was really the old 51 engine (you can very clearly see the tape covering the 51.) But that's part of the charm.

This seems to be the best season released so far (the proof being that I didn't devour the first two seasons like this.)",1172707200,12,1607,4.531034482758621

I remember setting that hour aside every day straining to watch it through a channel out of Chicago.  It was worth every minute.  I love the fact that the discs were not double sided.  Yes, some of the episodes have minor flaws in the picture quality, but who cares.  A true fan looks past that and enjoys the program for what it is.

2702279,3,B000LC4C60,"I'm a big Emergency fan, and clearly season three is where most shows start to click with chemistry and character, which happens here. Better scripts and plots are the norm. Season's one and two, I found myself FF between the dull or uninteresting parts. Season three is very viewable, and holds up well.

The major fault is with some of the presentation itself. Example; one of my favorite episodes ""Inferno"" was either lost or not found for a clear transfer from the original film. In its place is a good print, probably taken from the syndication vaults, (which were edited with season 4 or 5 credits), (The hospital communication room doesn't exist yet, but appears in the opening credit roll). I'm not sure exactly what's up, or the story from the studio is, but I'd sumise to say that it's the best print available, or that could be found. It is better quality than VHS, cable or TV, but lesser that DVD is capable of presenting.

With that, one example of a great print is 'Snakebite"" Colors are vibrant, squad and engine are ""fire engine red"", dialouge is original mono, spruced to Dolby Digital, clear, and in keeping with the original presentation.

I love the original opening sequences, keeping the timeline of the show. All in all, I can remember at least four opening credit changes throughout the series.

I should also note that some of the subtitles don't exactly match a scene. For instance, ""Chet"" was off scene having dialoge, and the caption read ""Marco"" talking, ""Squad 51"" somehow got tranposed to ""Squad 52"". I've never seen this many errors in one presentation. Then again, where were the script girls for some of these episodes? The continuity errors are always enjoyable (for me), and part of the shows charm.

I still enjoy these episodes, and often look for actors in the background and their expressions. Love it when they throw Mike Stoker a line, and see if he fumbles. I also look to see when he's missing, knowing he was a real fireman on call, away from the show. It explains how he was technicaly able to pull off the engine scenes like that with the brush fire in ""Inferno"". The second Engine 51 appears in the season's second episode, and interesting to note it's still in service at Yosemite National Park, since 1987, (DNC Engine #7, license YCS-E51). How cool is that?

You need to at least like the show to pick this one up, as it has some disappointing production values. I think this will be the best that can be done, other than Universal discovering the lost original film and doing a season reissue.

2702280,4,B000LC4C60,"I remember seeing the episode of ""The Old Engine"", where the second Engine 51 (the Ward La France is delivered).  That first run where Johnny and Roy ""hop on the back"" of the new engine took me back to the day when I ran my first call on the engine in 1989.  I couldn't help standing up in the house and imitating Johnny and Roy hopping on the back of the new engine.  The volunteer fire department I was in had two Ward La France engines just like Engine 51 with one exception - they were white instead of red.  My department did not replace these two engines (one was delivered circa 1971 and the other about 1974) until 1993 and 1994.  They worked well for what we used them for, and our maintenance captain kept them up good (I miss him, he died about two years ago).

Few will remember that Ward La France donated Engine 51 to Universal Studios (after the series ended in 1977, the LACoFD used it at Station 60 at Universal Studios until it was retired elsewhere), and it was driven from the factory in Elmira, NY (Ward La France is now closed) to Los Angeles, CA.  A crew manned by Mike Stoker (he was a real firefighter who drove Engine 51 on the show), Ed McFall and Mike Stearns (Mike and Ed were real paramedics from the early days - had John Gage been real, he would of been in Ed's Class. Mike was in the first class of six men, so had Desoto been real, he would of been there with him), and Dick Friend (Dick was the Public Information officer for the LaCoFD, he passed away about two years ago) and  drove the Engine and arranged to make frequent stops in several cities to do demonstrations at shopping centers for the paramedic program.  Keep in mind this was the summer of 1973, and a few spectators were like ""do the real guys REALLY do that on the street, or is that just TV?""  Yes, the real guys REALLY did this - and the show EMERGENCY! helped spread the paramedic concept.

Like many, as said in other reviews (EMT's, fire captains), I watched Emergency! as a kid, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Quite a few firefighters, EMT's, paramedics, doctors, and nurses in my age bracket (35-50) watched Emergency! as children, and I have to admit it did have something to do with why I spent 5 years in a volunteer fire department, and my motivation to go to EMT school during the summer of 1987.

As I watch some episodes, they take me back to reminisce about the fire department and remembering calls, some are similar to EMERGENCY!  I liked Chet because he reminded me of an old Lieutenant I had, who could be a ""goof off"", but when the bell rang he got serious.  Captain Stanley often reminds me of my two fire captains, who both had direction and knowledge was always helpful.  Those captains (and my EMS Lieutenant and maintenance captain) looked out for me and helped trained me.

EMERGENCY! had a lot of authenticity that Jack Webb and R.A. Cinader insisted on.  There was a show that came out in the mid-1990's (LA Firefighters) where both LA County and LA City representatives said after LA Firefighters came out (which lasted only 6 episodes, Rescue 77 also had a short run, something like 8 episodes), neither department would lend there name to a TV series again.  That should be a statement about the quality of American Television today.  Back in the seventies, family hour was reserved for Saturday night - what happened?  Now, CBS and NBC dedicate Saturday night to showing re-runs of other shows, like Law and Order, Cold Case, Without a Trace, or one of the CSI's.

EMERGENCY! set a good example for a standard of television (we never saw Gage going to bed with his dates, or talking inappropiately about others) and was a good show for the Saturday night family hour. Hollywood - bring some quality back.  While I occasionally watch ""Law and Order SVU"" (or Criminal Intent) and ""CSI: NY"" (I don't like the Miami one and Without a Trace has started to go ""off the deep end""),  ""Cold Case"" and re-runs of ""JAG"" on USA are the only shows I try to catch on a regular basis.",1172275200,2,4000,4.440492476060191
2702281,5,B000LC4C60,"I have been a fan of this show since I watched the reruns that aired in the early 80s. It shows you what paramedics go through when they are saving lives and trying to calm down the victim's family members and friends. I like Season 3's episode Snakebite the best because after Johnny was bit by the rattler and he is being transported to Rampart it shows Chet really cares about him especially when Johnny is in the ER despite the hard times he gives Johnny. This show is alot like E.R., Rescue Me, Saved, and Third Watch rolled into one for those who haven't watched EMERGENCY!. My ambition is to become a fireman/emt and I thank EMERGENCY! for it.",1172102400,2,650,4.425
2702282,5,B000LC4C60,"Dont pay much attention to all the complaining in some of the reviews here. If you are a fan of the show, you probably won't care that some of the episodes have the season six opening titles, or are not fully restored. Most of them look great, and the ones that are a little washed out, don't look that bad! All I miss are the original airdates, like season 1 and 2 included. But I would still buy this set! More action, the new fire engine arrives this season, more humor, as the show went on it seems there was less soapish drama in the hospital and more action with the fire crew. Dont wait, go ahead and pick this up! Hopefully season 4 doesnt take as long....",1172102400,3,664,4.1953125

2702284,3,B000LC4C60,"I have been eagerly awaiting the release of Season 3 and absolutely love Emergency. Universal did a decent job with the quality of Seasons 1 and 2 but Season 3 is a step backward in many respects. First the good. The use of single sided disks is a much welcome change and I had no freezing problems like I did with Season 1 and 2.

Unfortunately, the quality of individual episodes isn't as good. I don't mind the fact they used the syndication opening. But Universal obviously didn't bother to go into their own archives to use the original tapes or film and that's dissapointing. The storage of what they did use must not have been very good because certain scenes in episodes appear ""washed out"" or have occasional lines, much like you occasionally see on old film. What is most dissapointing however is that the copies they used have content left out from when they originally aired. There is an entire scene in the episode Propinquity that many Emergency! fans have never seen which occured in one of the main character's apartment. That scene does not appear in the DVD version. That's particularly unfortunate because Seasons 1 and 2 did include many of the scenes cut out of TVLand's presentation.

I am happy Universal finally came through on getting the season out and I hope will get the rest of the series done, but the quality of the presentation is dissapointing.",1171756800,4,1377,4.68595041322314
2702285,5,B000LC4C60,"The only disappointment with this release was that it took so long!!

Much better than Seasons 1 and 2, which had the double sided discs.

Here's hoping the Universal gets the rest of the seasons out in a more timely fashion.",1171670400,3,225,4.463414634146342
2702286,4,B000LC4C60,"When it was first announced that Emergency was going to be released on DVD I was very excited.  I grew up on this show, and it still holds up well today.  In fact, Emergency was the groundbreaker that lead directly to E.R.

I loved watching it again on TV Land, but was disappointed that they used the final season theme/credits for all episodes.  It may seem like a trivial thing, but I've always loved the theme song that they used from seasons 3-5.  I've been dying to hear that full theme song - with the Jazzy mid section - for over 20 years.  I'm still waiting.

Universal chose not to put out the original versions of these episodes, instead using the versions given to TV Land.  Now, the episodes that I've seen so far appear to be full length, but I've only watched the first two and scanned through the rest.  (Update - it looks like just about all of the episodes are full length.)  The decision to go with the versions that have the wrong theme song/credits is perplexing, though.

They dug deep and found the original versions from seasons 1 & 2, why couldn't they do the same with season 3?

The picture and sound quality for the Season 3 Box Set is acceptable, but not as good as seasons 1 & 2 (both of which were flawed in authoring/mastering, but had good source material).  What happened?  A year wait and this is the best they can do?  I know these aren't the biggest sellers Universal has, but they're selling well enough to warrant releasing all seasons, so why not continue to do at least the same quality job that they did with seasons 1 & 2?  It makes no sense.

The quality of the episodes of this classic show more than calls for the purchase of this box set, but it is a disappointing release, and I hope that Universal gets it right for Season 4!  (Come on guys - ORIGINAL, CORRECT Theme Songs, and better picture & sound quality!)",1171584000,34,1859,4.370262390670554
2702287,2,B000LC4C60,"When it comes to crummy DVD production, it's a toss-up between Disney and Universal Studios.  At least with Disney the DVD's do play.  With Universal it's one step forward (Season 2) and two steps back with Season 3.  There is only one single redeeming point in favor of Season 3,; the change to single-sided DVD, but even then they are plain white instead of the standard practice of picture discs. :(  What kind of clowns are running this train-wreck of a company:(!

Universal Studios has reduced ""Webb TV"" to the horrid release of Dragnet '67, a big collection of muddy garbage, then the half-baked, freeze-up, seize-up Adam 12 - Season 1 and Emergency - Season 1, another messy release with pixalated episodes.  I thought when Emergency - Season 2 came out with no problems with the exception of moronic double-sided discs our problems were at least being addressed by Universal Studios.  Apparently Universal Studios takes delight (and our money) in releasing much wanted media in such an uncommitted, irresponsible, tergiversating and reckless mindset!

Universal Studios, you are a shameful embarrassment to American manufacturing standards.  Take an example from Paramount (whom btw corrected their problems with TAGS #4) and Image Entertainment.  Both these studios are producing above average to supurb TV season sets.

Please halt the further desecreation of Jack Webb's legacy!  If you can't handle the job, please let someone who can.  BTW, where are Season's 2 & 3 of Dragnet and Adam-12?

UPDATE: 03.07.07

I'm having trouble with disc #3 in my Toshiba player/burner.  The disc plays but makes a ""rumbling"" sound after insertion.  Out of the ~900 DVD's I own this is the only disc to do this.  A disc from Universal -  Who would have 'thunk' it!  I sent for and received a replacement but the new set is worse.  Just disc #3.  I give up. :(  It plays on my computer drive but this really sucks to have to put up with!",1171584000,18,1933,4.861963190184049

2702289,2,B000LC4C60,"This is my first review, which I wouldn't have bothered to write at all if Universal Studios hadn't royally screwed up.  I have to concur with Lonesome Crow's review of ""Emergency!-Season 3.""  We all waited for it...a year and a half actually.  And what do we get after this long wait?  DVD copies of the episodes that were originally released by Columbia House on VHS back in the late 90s and the rest of the episodes appear to be DVD copies borrowed from TV Land.  That's right, TV Land released the series on their network about the same time as the Columbia House VHS release.  They cut a few minutes out of each episode for commericials, which is to be expected but an interesting side-note is that all the episodes had the Season 6 Opening Banner at the beginning of the episode instead of the originally aired opening.  That's was OK...back then, because I hadn't seen an episode of ""Emergency!"" in over 15 years and I was so happy to be watching the show again and I was willing to let that slide.

Here we are, 10 years later.  We're all anxiously awaiting the DVD release of Season 3 because they released Seasons 1 and 2 with no problems.  Surprise...TV Land mono and picture on each episode that was not released by Columbia House.  What happened?  Did they borrow the copies of the episodes from Columbia House and TV Land for this DVD release because it cost to much money to go into their own archives and do the standard restoration?

I was looking forward to Season 4 but at this point, who cares...Universal Studios certainly doesn't care.  I give 2 stars, one star because Universal Studios bothered to release these episodes at all and another star for all the extra footage that TV Land cut for commercials that I finally get to see.  The only thing that's missing on the bottom right hand corner of the unrestored episodes is the TV Land icon.  First ""Northern Exposure"", now this...can we just make it through Season 3 of ""Miami Vice"" without screwing it up...probably not.  Way to go Universal...once again, you're letting down the fans.",1171411200,7,2061,4.618131868131868

2702297,5,B000LC4C60,"I was quite surprised to see that not one but three seasons of Emergency are out on DVD or pending. I remember watching this great show on Saturday nights back when I was in high school. In those days, the networks put the good TV shows on Saturdays. Today, Saturday night is a graveyard for the pseudo-cancelled. It's hard to believe that 35 years ago the concept of the paramedic was a novel one, and this is a great show about the problems and personal lives of those involved in those early days of the program.

Emergency kept the pace fast and interesting with a combination of strange, dramatic, and even humorous cases. More unusual cases this season include the rescue of a boy trapped inside his own homemade rocket, a man who has difficulty breathing because he has swallowed his partial dental plate, an amateur magician trapped in a safe, a bank robbery hostage has symptoms of a heart attack and the paramedics have to treat him at gunpoint, a patient with an earache caused by mothballs, and an artist trapped inside his own sculpture.

The personal side of Emergency is interesting too. The chemistry between paramedics John Gage and Roy DeSoto is great and their various misadventures are frequently humorous. They're good friends but quite different people. Roy is a family man through and through, and John is a carefree single guy. I remember one particularly funny conversation in which John is actually thinking about marriage but is not sure he and the girl have known each other long enough. He asks Roy how long he knew his wife before they got married and Roy says 12 years. When John says that is a ridiculous period of time to wait, Roy mentions that he and his wife met in the fourth grade. That's a pretty typical conversation for the two. I highly recommend this series. If you've never seen it, even though medicine has changed drastically, it is still good entertainment. Highly recommended.",1170633600,12,1924,4.740298507462686

I have some other favorites.  I am not sure what season this episode is in the one where Chet plays the phantom tricks on Johnny

But having this in my collection will be great and more.  I watched the series way back in the 70's and never saw it again till maybe in 2000 or a couple years before when I was flipping around to see what was on TV and heard a familiar siren sound.  Turns out our channel 51 was running Emergency.  They had it on TVLand at same time then as well but think on TV land they clipped the episodes.
