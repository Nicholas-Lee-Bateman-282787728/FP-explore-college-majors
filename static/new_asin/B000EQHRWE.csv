The opera is very humorous in the tradition of Rossini's Barber of Seville or La Centerentola. Of course, it is a lesser known work and not to the level of the later masterpieces of Rossini. But, I think lovers of Bel Canto music will fully enjoy this opera. The stage of the Stutgart Opera House is relatively small, but they manage to do a n impressive production of all of the operas I have seen produced there. The acting is at a high level of achievement and makes the opera much more lively and enjoyable.",1365033600,2,614,4.581818181818182
8113483,5,B000EQHRWE,"If your idea of opera is ""heavy"" and epic music developing heroic themes, then, this Rossini farce is not for you. But, if you want to lay aside your cares and just enjoy a good time, then by all means buy this DVD. I couldn't help thinking about modern musical comedy, which fulills the same purpose as this earliest effort by Rossini: just provide an escape for a reasonable length of time. This production makes a good case for type-casting singers who not only can sing and act but are believable because they are more or less the ages of the characters they portray on stage. The entire production is suited to the small Rokokotheater used in the Schwetzingen Festival, and what's more important in this case, to the small home theater. Delightful entertainment!",1277078400,9,767,4.731343283582089
8113484,4,B000EQHRWE,"It is a typical Rossini opera buffa, light, funny and frosty. Not grand, but fun. It is well recorded and sung.",1219536000,7,111,4.333333333333333
8113485,5,B000EQHRWE,"If you appreciate Rossini, you'll surely enjoy this production of one of his smaller, less well-known operas. Most of the music will be fresh in your ears, not appropriated from other compositions, and many of the ensemble pieces rank with Rossini's most brilliant. The staging in the antique theater of Schwetzingen is the height of elegance, with distinctly English period costuming for an English story. The acting is excellent, and the camera-work captures that expressive excellence. The orchestra is top-notch, particularly the horns and flutes, and the conductor is worth the price of watching for his expressive face. The singing is highly polished, though no single voice seemed to me to surpass excellence and achieve brilliance.",1171497600,18,739,5.379310344827586
