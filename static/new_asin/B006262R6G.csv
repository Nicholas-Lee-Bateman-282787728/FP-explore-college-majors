8491013,1,B006262R6G,"There is nothing ""virtual"" about this.  Certainly no POV's, just a loop from the same spectator's views.  The workout is VERY short (~20 min) and it is a short course with many loops.  As a former Pittsburgher I was really hoping for a nostalgic ride and it wasn't close.  Video quality is VERY poor.  Very disappointing.",1506988800,,321,4.660714285714286
8491014,3,B006262R6G,I wish it was a bit more structured rather than just following the group.,1472774400,,73,4.285714285714286
8491015,5,B006262R6G,I returned to the Cycling discipline after many years away and purchased this video to assist me in getting my Cardio back and get a Butt Kicking.  This video is Excellent!!  Gene Nacey very Enthusiastically walks you in coaching through all categories and levels of the races and Chris Mahew does an Excellent Job as well!  It's Great to see the Pittsburgh Skyline and the Bridges.  The Music was very fitting to the content.  5 STARS!!!!  Or as Siskel and Ebert would have it 5 THUMBS UP!!!!,1425081600,,493,4.609195402298851
