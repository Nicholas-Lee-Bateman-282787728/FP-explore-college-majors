It demonstrates from start to finish how great these girls can be.  Its really quite a remarkable exhibition of singing and dancing honed to perfection by their instructors.  Great material and magical performances with superb sound and video.  Mikiko had fun pitting the dancing of the Pastel Wind, Logica? and Mini Patti groups against each other.",1468195200,,491,4.785714285714286
