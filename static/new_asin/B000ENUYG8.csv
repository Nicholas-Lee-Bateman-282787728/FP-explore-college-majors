2524821,5,B000ENUYG8,"The Nanny was one of the best shows of the 90's!  Funny, entertaining, and just made you feel good...hard to come by in today's drama-crazed television society.  Fran Drescher's charisma lights up the screen and the supporting cast is brilliant...special kudos to the wit and chemistry of Niles and CC!

  I hope they continue to release all seasons of this show, I don't buy a ""not enough demand"" excuse...it doesn't re-run daily on three different channels for nothing!",1142380800,2,471,4.987179487179487

2524823,5,B000ENUYG8,"I am really happy that Season 2 is coming, as I thought it might not come due to insufficient demand suggested on this web site.

I really like ""The Nanny"" as I was growing up with her.

I was learning English with this sitcom when I first migrated to an English speaking country because English is not my first English. She made me laugh, made me cry during my early days in a strange country and I really want to recap these precious memories by watching the show on DVD again.

Though there are no such ""extra"" stuff on the DVD, but I am already too grateful for it to be released. Those memories of mine are very very precious to keep.

Last but not all, as I want to watch this show with my other friends whose first language is not English, I really hope that this season two will have English Subtitle, instead of just Spanish or French, etc.

Thank you Nanny for growing up with me. :)",1141689600,2,893,4.229411764705882

2524932,4,B000ENUYG8,"Franny Fine(Fran Drescher) returns to clean house in this hilarious 1994-95 Season of The Nanny when this show was one of television's most popular sitcoms, The Nanny took home an Emmy-Award in its second season for Best Costuming, making it the most fashionable show on television.

In this Sophomore season of this show that ran on CBS from 1993-99, Fran Drescher , Charles Shaughnessy, Daniel Davis, Lauren Lane, Nicholle Tom, Benjamin Salisbury Madeline Zima, and Renee Taylor are up to their same old tricks & will have you saying T.G.I.F. Thank Goodness It's Fran..

Fran dresses like a man to infiltrate an exclusive all-male club; Mr. Sheffield dates a dead-ringer for Fran; Niles auditions for Maxwell's latest play; and Brighton's knack for cards lands him on Sylvia's canasta team. And that's only the beginning.

THE NANNY has remained popular in reruns on Antenna-TV, TV Land, Nickelodeon, and on Lifetime.",1397779200,,919,5.154362416107382

2524947,5,B000ENUYG8,"I wondered with all the rich foods that they noshed on how she kept her tiny figure well, it did catch up to her for towards the end of the Nanny series she was not the size 2 she was in the beginning along with  her skirts which got longer as she gained her weight ...we did get to see her in her newest show where she was really big. I felt sorry for her but noticed as the series went on she was losing those pounds.  I ordered all the seasons that were available and have cancelled my cable so I can just watch the series I want to watch without all the political garbage in and out of time.  I also loved that she would bring on her parents to do some of the folks that were in her TV mom family.  Her Dad is so funny and her mom as well.  Also she has her dog Chester which is her dog on the show.  This one I think shows a out take of her flossing his teeth and telling him what a good dog he was.  I learned a lesson for my dog died from a heart condition from his bad teeth.  If I ever get another dog it will be a pup and I will start her out on flossing right from the beginning so I do not have to see another dog I loved die early from dental health problems.
you will love it if you love Fran.  Thanks to Amazon I can buy all my favorite programs in packs complete, so I never get tired of them, I also have Kindle and other means to watch programs that cable charges so much for. I can get 2 complete series for the cost of my 3rd tear cable over 200.00 plus a couple of movies to boot.  Thanks Amazon!",1391817600,2,1517,3.8025477707006368

2524991,5,B000ENUYG8,"Another great season to view and enjoy. The first season is the best, but season two follows up nicely. Well done. A native New Yorker born and bred and from the sleeper Borough of Queens myself, I have to admit that I love this show, though bits about big hair and her voice are way over the top, yes exaggerated for those whom never have been to New York City before. The parts with the loud talking, interrupting and slapping each other are so New York city. If you need a laugh a minute this is the show to watch. It is otherwise so New York city. It is hilarious. Now mind you, I never viewed this show when it first aired. I have no idea why, except that I wasn't watching TV at the time this aired. I'm now working my way through the DVD series. Where was I when this shirt first aired? Fran Drescher is just too funny.

2525020,5,B000ENUYG8,"Whenever I feel the need to laugh and forget my troubles, I watch a few episodes of The Nanny, with its fabulously talented ensemble cast, and its star: the incomparable Fran Drescher. It's pure escapism, but sometimes that's what we need. It's dated, but so are I Love Lucy and The Golden Girls; sometimes the past looks more inviting than the present, and a whole lot less scary than the future. I've purchased all of the available DVDs of this show, seasons I, II, and III, and I only wish ALL of them were available.",1366761600,,520,4.484210526315789
2525021,5,B000ENUYG8,"This show is a classic. It's right up there with ""I Love Lucy"" for me. The whole cast is endearing and funny. It's fun to watch the kids as they develop and Fran and Mr. Sheffield become used to each other. Of course, Niles and C.C. are the ""frosting on the cake"" with their witty humor. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Jewish Yiddish sayings and New York Jewish satirical humor. Fran Drescher and the whole cast do an excellent job of entertaining us. Make sure to get the rest of the seasons. So far I've only been able to get the first three seasons. If you have Nickelodeon on cable, they are still showing The Nanny at 7pm and 7:30pm weeknights and 7:30pm on Saturday. I've got my DVR set on it.

I have not been able to find The Nanny anywhere else and I did not know that Amazon had it either.  They notified me about The Nanny, based on my purchase of The Beautician and the Beast, in which Fran Drescher plays the lead role.  So Amazon made me aware of other titles they thought I might be interested in based on my previous purchases and I was able to find and buy several seasons of The Nanny because they let me know they had it.

Miss Fine interwove the combination of naivete and sophistification so successful.  Then in contrast were the momentary street-wise bursts of Flushing personality - also done so successfully.  Very well-done with such smooth transition.  My opinion is that this perfect combination of all cast members could do nothing wrong.

Another good thing is that none of Fran's outfits were plastic.  In the first season, she had a lot of plastic (pleather) outfits that were atrocious.

The best thing is that they are starting to bring Fran and Mr. Sheffield together which is nice.  The episodes are also very funny.  Like someone else stated they are dated but still very funny.

So, what's the problem?  Chastity Claire and Niles arguing all the time is annoying.  The worst part of this season to me is Maggie; all of her storylines center around boy crushes.  The Maggie character seems so one sided and shallow.",1277164800,,807,4.534722222222222

The kids are adorable, especially Grace, who talks back with an attitude. Every once in a while when I watch ""The Nanny"" I find myself bursting with laughter.

Unfortunately, the show didn't get much attention when it was on. Some of its cultural references are outdated (frequent references to the Clintons and Dolly Parton). However, if you didn't catch it while it was being aired, these DVDs are definitely worth checking out.",1263168000,,726,5.0

Episode #16 in the 2nd season was the choice for me. C. C. and the butler Niles are left behind when the Nanny and the family head off to a card tournament wherein Brighton is to play with the team. Almost at the end, you hear the song OLD TIME ROCK-N-ROLL begin and Niles comes sliding out on the floor in his underwear and a white shirt with black sunglasses on. He begins to pretend he is singing the song. Then, shortly into it, in walks C. C. and catches him. As Niles whirls he sees she is watching. He stops as though he were a child who's just been caught with his fingers in the cookie jar. He just stands there. When the live audience stops laughing, he states: ""You know this means I'll have to kill you!""

I laughed and laughed until my sides hurt and tears flowed from my eyes. The two of them appear in the show to NOT LIKE each other and the chemistry which is between them is CONSTANTLY funny. Both taking verbal PUNCHES at each other constantly. But this one was the GREATEST and FUNNIEST.

That gives you an idea about the humor which is true humor in the finest style on The Nanny. I love all the episodes. As well as the characters, etc.

Would I recommend this product or any season of The Nanny? You can bet the English Crown I would!

For not since I LOVE LUCY has there been a truly funny sit-com like this. And probably won't be for another 50 years.",1232582400,7,1619,4.209677419354839

My favorite episode from season 2 is the episode that Fran was chosen to receive the fur coat from her dead great aunt. She had to put a large napkin on her head and sing this hebrew song to her mother at the Sheffield's house just for her mother to forgive her for not wanting to keep the fur coat.
My favorite season is season 4. I liked seasons 5 when Fran finally married Maxwell and season 6 when she had the twins, but season 4 was so much typical Fran. I hated that she didn't catch that boat to meet Maxwell's brother",1205971200,,767,4.086092715231788
