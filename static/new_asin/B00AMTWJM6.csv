5456540,5,B00AMTWJM6,"This DVD is a must for anyone interested in doing prenatal pilates.  Prenatal pilates is an excellent exercise option throughout pregnancy.  Carrie Koziol provides an introduction to the techniques so that you feel comfortable that you are performing the exercises correctly.  She takes you through each exercises in detail so that you can follow along easily.  The calming environment creates a safe space while still providing a workout that will work your muscles and make you feel like you worked hard.  Carrie also provides information about what is safe during pregnancy so that you feel comfortable that you are doing your body good and not doing your body damage.  The meditations are a good cool down after the exercise, but they are also excellent meditations during labor or just for a destress.  Carrie's prenatal exercises have supported my health during my current pregnancy and prepared my body for labor and delivery.  I feel stronger and more flexible and I highly recommend this DVD for anyone looking for a safe and effective prenatal workout.",1357516800,,1062,5.098265895953757
5456541,5,B00AMTWJM6,"This DVD is great! Carrie gives very clear and vivid instructions. I always struggled with my pelvic floor and never know if I'm doing it quite right. Carrie's descriptions really help me visualize and execute the exercises correctly. She is extremely knowledgeable. I also love that the DVD is endorsed by OBGYN's, Midwives and Doulas. One of my favorite parts of the DVD is the relaxation exercises. I have a hard time relaxing, and I really felt myself relax during this section. I've done some other prenatal Pilates DVDS, and this one is my favorite. It targets the key muscles needed during pregnancy. I also love that it has exercises for the upper back, which is so important. I highly recommend this workout.",1356480000,,717,4.837398373983739
5456542,5,B00AMTWJM6,"I received this DVD as a gift and I fell in love with it.  The exercises were awesome - I always felt like I got a really good workout in. And there are bonus features where she talks you through relaxation visuals and gives you positive affirmations about the labor experience.  They helped me a lot through my whole pregnancy.  I will definitely ""pay it forward"" and gift this to my pregnant friends in the future.",1355616000,,416,4.447368421052632
5456543,5,B00AMTWJM6,"This DVD is a must have for every pregnant woman!  I had never done pilates before but a friend recommended this DVD so I thought I'd give it a try.  I just wish I had found it earlier in my pregnancy.  I caught on to the exercises quickly and was able to get a strong and safe workout during my pregnancy.  Plus, I LOVED the relaxation techniques.  They gave me the confidence I needed to not only survive, but really thrive during my labor experience, something I thought was impossible.  If you want to feel healthy and empowered during your pregnancy, try this DVD!",1355616000,,569,4.423076923076923
5456544,5,B00AMTWJM6,I took Carrie's prenatal class before having my daughter. Carrie is extremely knowledgable with prenatal Pilates strengthening and principles. With her background as a physical therapist and certified prenatal Pilates instructor you can count on a great program. Her exercises helped me feel stronger and more comfortable with my pregnancy and with delivery itself. Highly recommend!!!,1355529600,,385,5.892857142857143
5456545,5,B00AMTWJM6,I took Carries class and the whole time I thought - wow she should have  video!  I am sure glad she does now because there was so much that I learned from her that no Dr. or medical professional shared with me.  You feel stronger and more in touch with your body.  For a first time mom it was so enriching and exciting to learn these lessons from Carrie.  She rocks and you will love this video!,1355529600,,395,4.077922077922078
5456546,5,B00AMTWJM6,I took Carrie's 6 week prenatal class and loved it.  All of the exercises helped me during my pregnancy - especially towards the end when you become super uncomfortable.  Her relaxation techniques were a God-send during labor & delivery. Definitely a MUST during pregnancy!  I will be purchasing a DVD for a friend expecting her 1st baby in the spring.,1355443200,,352,4.833333333333333
5456547,5,B00AMTWJM6,"I took Carrie's Prenatal Pilates 6 week course. It was an amazing program and helped immensely with the back pain I had been having. The exercises were very beneficial!!! She is an excellent instructor. I had a wonderful pregnancy and I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that I practiced these exercises on a regular basis. I went on to have a natural childbirth, this class helped a lot to prepare me for it!

I highly recommend this DVD!",1355443200,,447,4.321428571428571
5456548,5,B00AMTWJM6,"I found this program when i was on my third pregnancy. My previous pregnancy had been pretty rough and i found that this program, not only made me feel stronger, but helped to have a positive attitude and feel empowered to belive i had control over my ever changing body. Carrie's knowledge of body mechanics, pilates and the specific needs of the pregnant woman are evident. I really loved this program!",1355443200,,404,4.704225352112676
8554353,5,B00AMTWJM6,"I do this DVD 3x a week during my pregnancy and it has been so helpful for making me feel better physically. (especially back pain). When I first started in my first trimester, I thought it was too easy and a waste of time, but as the pregnancy progressed I realized this lady is right on! Going to keep doing it until I give birth!",1515110400,,332,4.123076923076923
8554354,1,B00AMTWJM6,I felt like this DVD was a total waste of my time & money. I'm not sure why it has good reviews that's why I purchased it. I could have done 5minutes worth of stretching at my house on my own and felt more stretched or worked out than I did after this entire program. Extremely basic she has you do the most basic move/stretch for 3 seconds and moves on to the next. Very slow I could get up take a bathroom break and return and not miss anything. I haven't worked out my entire pregnancy other than walking and felt no challenge or even a good stretch after this. The warm up portion was maybe a minute long. If you're looking to take a nap while trying a pregnancy workout video DVD buy this. I don't mind relaxation workouts or stretching however this was incredibly boring and slow I couldn't relax I was focused on how much time I was wasting.,1497744000,,848,4.208588957055214
8554355,4,B00AMTWJM6,"I used this Pilates video while pregnant with my first child. I don't want to be too specific because each women's experience with pregnancy and delivery is so vastly different, but I truly believe that keeping up with pilates helped make my delivery go smoothe. I started this video in my second T and at the time thought it was very easy. I started to appreciate the 'easiness' in the third T and did it all the way up to the week my daughter was born. I can't say for sure if it was this video, but my daughter was head down the whole pregnancy and sat very low starting at week 37. I also delivered on time. I am currently three weeks postpartum and my recovery is also going very well. As I can't contribute anything specifically to this DVD, I will say that it's worth giving a try if there's a chance that it could help during delivery and recovery!",1424131200,,856,4.290123456790123
8554356,5,B00AMTWJM6,It is very hard these days to know you are getting a quality product when you consider all of the videos that are on the market. But this video is awesome! I am a physical therapist and it is comforting to know that this exercise video is led by a physical therapist who specializes in pre/postnatal and is also certified in Pilates! This is the real deal!!,1409184000,,357,4.343283582089552
8554357,5,B00AMTWJM6,"I took Carrie's prenatal and Postnatal pilates classes, AND I have her DVD.  She has such a soothing voice, and is very clear with her instructions.  I felt like I really did get something out of her prenatal pilates.  I was very pregnant and very afraid of how difficult it would be, but she gives a variety of instructions, especially if something is a little harder for a c-section mom.  I can't recommend this dvd enough!  I will buy a copy for my sister when she has her next kid.",1407715200,,485,4.344444444444444
8554358,5,B00AMTWJM6,"I am currently taking Carrie's 6 week prenatal pilates class and also purchased her DVD. What I love about the DVD, aside from the actual exercises and stretches, is the section at the end that includes meditations. The mediatations are so relaxing and make me give me a sense of confidence for labor. I plan to put these on my iPod to use during labor. I am planning for a natural, drug free delivery experience and am confident that this will help prepare both my mind and body. I feel that Carrie's class and DVD are both mentally and physically empowering, and exactly what an expectant mother needs. As a first time mother, I have eagerly sought out the best of the best! I am so happy I found Carrie!",1389052800,,706,4.438461538461539
8554359,5,B00AMTWJM6,"Highly recommend! My goal was to have a drug free labor and delivery and this DVD helped me achieve that goal. I'm a first time mom and didn't know what to expect, but this DVD prepared me mentally and physically. I practiced every other day and I'm so fortunate i did!",1387497600,,269,4.294117647058823
8554360,5,B00AMTWJM6,"This is a great pre-natal workout!! All the exercises really prepared me for labor and birth and now that I'm 3 weeks post-delivery, I feel like I'm in a great place with my recovery to my original weight/body. The hidden gem though are the relaxation techniques. I went through them over and over hearing her soothing voice in my head while battling my Pitocin-spiked, sunny-side-up-baby, no-time-for-an-epidural contractions!",1384992000,,427,5.388059701492537
8554361,5,B00AMTWJM6,"I was fortunate enought to take Carrie's six week class during my third trimester of pregnancy.  Carrie is also a physical therapist specializing in women's health.  So she really knows and understands what happens to a women's body during childbirth (as she's done it herself 3x).  I looked forward to her class every week.  She really guided me through the exercises which helped me maintain an easy pregnancy until delivery fives days past my due date.  Her focus on pelvic floor exercises and stregthening the traverse abdominal muscles were very helpful in the days after delivery too.  I look forward to exercising with Carrie during future pregnancies! After completing her class, I went onto deliver my 9 pound, 7 ounce son with no pain medications, cuts or tears!  Thanks Carrie for the easy deliver and easy post partum recovery!",1369267200,,839,4.9928057553956835
8554362,5,B00AMTWJM6,"I would recommend this pilates DVD to anyone who is pregnant and wishes to stay in great shape in order to have an easier
delivery.",1358640000,,131,4.28
