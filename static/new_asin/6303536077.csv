I was really scared.  Now I watch them and I'm not that scared, there just very good campy fun.  And there is little to no gore, and maybe 3 Adult Terms, through the hole film.
The fourth, and to date final film in the series, ""Critters 4,"" was a great idea.  The movie takes place about 100 years after the third film, and follows Charlie from the doomed apartment building to the deck of a salvage crew.  But once the crew discovers the eggs, the try to return there vessel to the owners, which have all but dissipeared.  The Slowest and unfortunatly worst film (even thought the plot was the most thought-out).",1051401600,,776,4.384615384615385

Charlie find the eggs and is about to blast'em but he gets an message from his Alien-bountyhunter buddy that he is not eloud to kill any other lifeforms if it means exterminating off the species,instead Charlie got an mission to put the eggs in a pud and send them upp to space,is he going to sucsess?? if you whant the right anshwer then borrow this lovely movie TO DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1011916800,2,644,4.707964601769912

The critters (aka Krites)are back for a fourth time, but this time they are in space and they are planning to steal another space pod that another crew members are on.

He seems to be angry all the time and doesn't quiet want to get  along with anyone on board the ship.  No one on the ship as ever been to  Earth before and now is the chance to get there for their first time ever  being on planet Earth.

Critters 4 has a good  story going, but just not enough critter action as in 1 & 2.  I thought  it was a very entertaining movie! If you haven't seen Critters 4 yet, check  it out.

681207,4,6303536077,"This movie veers off course in more ways than one.  Picking up where the last movie ended, Charlie (Don Keith Opper) has been lost in space for decades until a salvage vessel runs across his pod and takes it onboard.  Greed quickly takes over when the evil commander (Anders Hove) of the salvage vessel decides he must see what's inside this pod, before handing it off to Terracorp for a presumed finder's fee.  The designated handoff is supposed to take place at a nearby space station; abandoned for whatever reason by Terracorp.  Of course, complications arise.  Captain Rick manages to break into the pod and release Charlie and the 2 hatched Crites.  As if that wasn't bad enough, the space station's nuclear reactor begins to fail and the onboard computer-Angela turns out to be a bit temperamental.  They're surrounded by death from all quarters.
The body count is higher in this installment.  There's less humor to be had (not a bad thing).  And there's not one but two villains (Rick and Ug/Counselor Tetra).  The only false note for me is the belated appearance by Ug, now called Counselor Tetra.  At no time do they bother to explain the (seemingly) abrupt change in Ug.  This extraneous villain could have been anyone in name only, why a former character who was supposedly a good guy?  It was a little late in the game to drop a surprise that only lasted a few seconds.  Otherwise, not a bad effort; I had to have it to complete the set.  It's not the most inspired series ever made.  I like it because of repeated viewings; I've developed a certain fondness for the little critters.

I was wondering when they would have a Critters movie that takes place in space since they are originally from space and having the first three being taken place on Earth and around the same town.  While the humor that you'd expect from the Critters isn't there like in the other films and if you are a fan of the series like I am, this is probably one of the first things that you'll notice about this movie.  The writing seems to have improved over the previous three, but I'm not sure about the characters in the movie other than Charlie, who's the only character that has been in all four movies.  The acting is a better than the third movie, but not by much at least to me.  Overall Critters 4, gets 2.5 stars out of 5.",1299888000,,840,4.358974358974359
681212,1,6303536077,"Critters I-II were, by all means, excellent horror/monster/comedy/sci-fi movies. They blended many genres and elements. The creature effects were great, and the first chronicled two bounty hunters and a couple characters in a town called Grover's Bend, first with just some critters, and then eggs hatching and attacking an entire town. In the end, they win.
Critters III goes on with a ""crites are still around"" on Earth, but not many. Charlie is after them, which changes the setting to the city, a good call to keep the serious fresh. By all means, they should've been killed in the end, because Critters IV is awful.

First of all many space shots are just stock footage. it seems as though they ran out of money after spending it all on III (which was filmed back to back with this one). It takes almost 50 minutes for the critters to even show, seriously. Before that, bad actors talk about nothing, and get nowhere. And when the crites start their rampage...still not much happens. THere is a plot about genetic altering of experiments and stuff, but when the critters are genetically altered, we think something cool is about to take place...when the camera cuts off and you don't actually see any fights. By all means, this movies is atrocious.

How anyone can compare this to III is beyond me, nor how anyone can help this movie get 3 1/2 stars on Amazon. This is comparable to some of the awful sequels Like Leprechaun: In Space and Troll 2.

Just watch the first three, and a rumored remake maybe.",1277251200,,1509,4.686792452830189

Cast:  Don Keith Opper, Terrence Mann, Paul Whitthorne, Anders Hove, Angela Bassett, Brad Dourif, Eric DaRe, Martine Beswick, Anne Ramsay.

Running Time:  100 minutes

Rated PG-13 for violence, language, and gore.

""Critters 4"" starts, somewhere in Kansas and replays the last few minutes of ""Critters 3"" (1991) as the recurring character of Charlie McFadden (Don Keith Opper) is about to shoot the last two remaining Critter eggs in the universe which, we are informed, would mean the extinction of the entire Critter race which is against some sort of intergalactic zoological law or something like that. Charlie's bounty hunter friend Ug (Terrence Mann) is now known as Counsellor Tetra and is a top ranking official at the intergalactic council and orders Charlie not to shoot the eggs but instead put them into a pod that will land nearby very soon.  The pod does indeed land nearby very quickly & Charlie does indeed put the eggs into it but he is also caught in the pod which I presume cryogenic-ally freezes him as it's never really explained. ""Critters 4"" then informs us that we are 'Somewhere in Saturn Quadrant 2045' where a salvage ship comes across the pod drifting in space. Rick (Anders Hove) decides to claim the unidentified, to them anyway, pod and try to make a bit of cash out of it. With the help of his crew, Ethan (Paul Whitthorne), Fran (Angela Bassett), Al Bert (Brad Dourif) and Bernie (Eric DeRe), the pod is successfully recovered. They get in touch with the intergalactic council and Counsellor Tetra say to go to an abandoned space-station where a trade will be made for the pod and its contents, Tetra also specifically tells Rick not to open the pod. So in true horror film tradition Rick opens the pod, thaws Charlie out and the Critter eggs which hatch, kill Rick and escape into the space-station.

Co-produced & directed by Rupert Harvey, ""Critters 4"" is a pretty useless film and rounds the Critter series of films off with a whimper rather than a bang. The script by Joseph Lyle and David J. Schow is both predictable & clich&eacute;d, the space-station with an unstable reactor that will blow up in a few hours, the protagonists only means of escape being neutralised early on so they are stuck, the race against time to save themselves, the constant bickering & arguing amongst the crew, people splitting up and the loser who turns into a hero & saves the day, yawn. A lot of plot devices seem to come straight from ""Aliens"" and it rips off ""Star Wars"" with a tacky waste compactor scene. The characters are no better and you probably won't give a damn about any of them. While the other ""Critters"" films could be described as comedy horrors part 4 cannot, it appears to be deadly serious throughout, making it incredibly slow, uneventful and dull.  The looks cheap throughout with bland, dark unimaginative sets and it even steals footage from ""Android"" for it's ships and space scenes; ""Critters 4"" was apparently so low budget that the filmmakers couldn't afford any optical effects & the ones it takes from ""Android"" look seriously dated. The acting is pretty poor as well with Angela Bassett's over-the-top melodramatic reaction to seeing a few Critter eggs particularly cringe worthy. To look at ""Critters 4"" it is as cheap and unspectacular a production as you could hope to (not) see.",1135987200,6,3359,4.83623693379791
681248,2,6303536077,"This was the first Critters movie I ever saw, and I'm dissapointed. 53 years after Critters3, the Krites end up in outer space and wreck havoc there. The best parts are the rare cheap jokes that aren't even funny, but slightly better then the rest of the movie. The Krites in this one just look more silly then the Krites in the 1st 3 movies, I bet, because they had bald heads! MAXIMUM SILLYNESS!!!!!!!",1100304000,3,403,4.45945945945946

I have all of these movies on dvd and if anybody's a fan of the Critters films like I am, these movies are a good part of your dvd collection.",1091923200,,441,3.9
681250,3,6303536077,"This unfortunately was the last critters film.  The should not have stopped.  Sure it was  the second worest of the three.  Okay movie.
Charlie is a  major character but  very little action.  To make thing worse UG is now evil. Apparently something change Ug he does not want to wipe out all the Crites.  Cheezy parts  UG Sholud have been  like  70 in 2040 but he's only  looks like 30.
Charlie is order buy Ug to put  to the two remain eyes  in a pods.  Charlie get locked in the pod accidently.  He is  adjected into space  he is inside there for 49 years.  After  the pod is collected by  a salavage crew.
After there greed leader blast open the pods charlie is free.  Unforunately  the Crite eggs have hatched.  Is weird is the Crites were in with Charlie and did not hurt him.
The Crites get loose on the space station and  the killing  begins over again. This movie is also a spoff of Closous  there is a computer that talks named Adrina whos central logic is only at 50% .  That pluse there is one part  about  15 minuted into the movie  there is and reactment of the  trash compactor scence form episode 4 of starwars but is  only half as good.  When Charlie almost get  sucked into space.
I thought UG gooing bad as well as the lack of action and  no Bradly brown spoiled the movie that pluse having charlie kill ug.  I thought have the krites be a radioactive bio weapon was interesting. If you will like this i Recomen seeing Critters 1 3 and 2 as well a s Gremlin the movie that inspired Critters.",1082332800,,1509,4.241992882562277

I bought this movie expecting it to be great because it was the last in the series since who knows how long, ERR WRONG! it took me about a month to watch this whole thing, it was so boring!

681252,3,6303536077,"Being that this and Critters 3 were filmed back to back, this also was direct-to-video. Fortunately though, Critters 4 does not have the ""direct-to-video faults"" that Critters 3 had. This movie starts off showing what happened at the end of the 3rd movie. In my opinion of the 3rd movie, the ending is really all you need to see. By the way, DO NOT let the subtitle of Critters 4 fool you! This is no corny space movie. In fact, Critters 4 ranks up with the first one in the sense of a dark yet decent plot. Yes, the character of Charlie is in the movie and it does take place 50 years later but this is all explained. As far as the ending goes, it was surprising. Some people liked it, some didn't. As for me, I thought it gave the movie a good twist. As I said in my previous Critters review: skip Critters 3 and move on to Critters 4. The only reason I don't give this movie a 4th star is becuase it lacks some action compared to the first two Critter movies but don't let that dissapoint you. I would have to say that Crittes 4 is the only movie in the series that appears to be for adults as well as teenagers. Again, Critters 4 has a dark/decent plot somewhat similar the first movie and should not be missed.",1076112000,6,1215,4.174468085106383

7850237,1,6303536077,"The first two Critters films (which were excellent) were theatrical films.  Critters 3 & 4 were vastly inferior straight to video sequels.  Critters 3 is mainly known for being one of Leonard DiCaprio's first films and also features a pretty engaging turn by young actress Aimee Brooks, whose career, unfortunately, never took off.  The critter effects by the Chiodo Brothers (who also made the cult film KIller Klowns From Outer Space) were still fun but otherwise, the movie didn't really impress.  The drop-off in quality between parts two and three was pretty huge.

Critters 4 is actually much worse than Critters 3, although it does boast an early starring role by an unknown actress named Angela Bassett.  The film begins in Kansas with Charlie the bounty hunter (series regular Don Opper) having wiped out every one of the critters.  Only two eggs remain and he is about to destroy them when he receives a space transmission warning him that he will be breaking intergalactic law if he makes the species completely extinct.  A space pod comes for the eggs, but Charlie gets trapped inside with them and is cryogenically frozen.

More than half a century later a salvage ship in space picks up the pod, releasing Charlie and the eggs.  The critters now get to run rampant on a space ship, which sounds like a good idea in theory but there was apparently even less of a budget for this one than for Critters 3.  The space effects look much cheesier than the ones Roger Corman offered in his cheapie sci-fi romps from the late 1970's and the critters barely have enough screen time to make their presence known.

Critters 4 is the definition of abysmal.  It is shockingly boring.  It takes more than half the film for the critters to finally turn up.  The whole movie just feels like filler that exists only so New Line would have something to put on the shelves at Blockbuster that had name recognition.  As mediocre as Critters 3 was the movie at least felt like it was trying to be watchable.  Nobody seems to even be making an effort with this one.",1479254400,,2057,4.669444444444444
