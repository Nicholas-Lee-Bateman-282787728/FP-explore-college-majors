3414749,4,B0018BA70S,"Gorgeous cinematography- really makes me miss Texas.
Great performances by the cast.  I especially enjoyed James Thomas Gilbert's character.
Definitely recommended!",1229558400,7,164,6.809523809523809
3414750,5,B0018BA70S,"I would like to just say that the cinematographer, Cliff Richhart, did an amazing job of capturing the atmosphere of this small town. It's gritty, it's textured, and it helps supports the cast (which was amazing) as another character.
Fred's old beat up double-wide (rendered aging and decrepit by Production Designer Tom Walker), took on a life of its own, swallowing up the lives of these wandering twenty-somethings in the same way as the bleak landscape.
James Thomas Gilbert rocks as ""Duck,"" the almost un-lovable loser. He's funny, yet deeply sad. Jessica McClendon deserved every bit of praise she received on the film festival circuit (Best Actress - MicroCinema Fest) for her portrayal of insecure femininity figuring itself out amongst a male-dominated, ego-centric myopic existence.
I can honestly say that almost every aspect of this film blew me away, from the music to the craft services. As for the directing however, I should let someone else comment. I don't think I'm in any place to pass judgment.",1229472000,10,1016,5.089820359281437

3414759,5,B0018BA70S,"I was blown away by this movie.!  I seldom shed a tear when watching a movie, but this one was visceral to the point I couldn't hold them back! All the actors were top notch! I have to cite the guy who played his best friend (James Thomas Gilbert) and, of course, the one who played Fred (Bill Sebastian/actor/director!).I should also include Bill who was believable  and had a lot of charm in his characterization of Fred's other 'best' friend. The ending, although realistic, did not satisfy me in its resolution. I thought that Fred's reaction to Bill's confession was overwrought in its intensity.  After all, they were roommates for several years and known each other since childhood and were there for each other through thick and thin! So, his homophobic rant seemed out of place in view of this relationship (IMHO). It would be nice to have a sort of a sequel to this movie showing how they were getting along with their lives, several years hence?",1414540800,5,956,4.678571428571429

3414768,1,B0018BA70S,"I was so surprised when this came up on my recommended list.  I watched it and afterwords am appalled.  The acting was terrible.  for example, several scenes were perfect, and then just as they would have been complete anther line or several lines made them cheesy.  It seems to me like someone who is afraid to let the audience do a little of their own work, instead spoils the movie by spelling it all out for them.  It was just a terrible movie, not well directed, acted, scripted, or played.  Too bad for Amazon for having it on their list.",1383955200,3,544,4.39

3414771,1,B0018BA70S,"Totally a waste of time to watch, a Very Highly Disappointing, Disjointed, Disconnected and Highly Introspective movie. It really needs a script other than actors incoherently rambling on about their feelings and mumbling mostly to themselves praying that someone other than their psychoanalyst would listen to them. The name of the movie Midlothia must mean Muddled and Loathing of All.",1382572800,2,387,5.466666666666667

3414773,1,B0018BA70S,"I didn't even get to the point where I understood the plot. When the film first opened, I wanted to congratulate the editor, in the way he (she?) moved from static images to real life. It was excellent. But then, people started to talk. My take, in the five minutes I gave this film a chance, is that the screenplay and the acting are both rather blas. I think the people that gave this film 5 stars are either plugged-in to the film, or have a personal connection to the subject matter.",1381190400,3,487,4.304347826086956
3414774,4,B0018BA70S,"If he had better developed the female character (or maybe a different actor - but I think it was writing/directing that was weak here), this would be an excellent film!

3414777,4,B0018BA70S,If you spent any length of time in a rural town of 5K or less you'll connect with this film.  I thought James Thomas Gilbert's character Duck was especially authentic.  I would have given this film five stars but there were a couple of times that it just felt too over the top in the last third of the movie.  Just a bit too much drama for me.  But may be that's because I was enjoying the tone of the movie too much.  Probably without all the drama I would have been saying the storying didn't go any place but for me I really didn't need it to go any place.  I was that into the setting.,1379548800,,589,3.9914529914529915
3414778,5,B0018BA70S,"The story of four small-town friends trying to get unstuck in their young lives...

A truly lovely film--brilliantly executed.  Writer and Director Bill Sebastian tackles some complicated issues in this feature, simultaneously leaving the audience somehow wanting to comfort each of these characters and nurse their emotional wounds, while also finding satisfaction with the ending.

Sebastian's direction evoked emotionally complex performances from his actors, (including himself) and delicately balanced laughter as well as tears in this very raw film.

It's no wonder this film won so many awards! And the soundtrack is stellar!",1232668800,,632,5.763440860215054
3414779,5,B0018BA70S,"This is a solid film. It is exactly what independent cinema should be. Real characters and a clever original story. Midlothia is funny and tense and a real ride. I rented this film because the story looked good and I was not disappointed.  The movie involves three long time friends in the middle of nowhere and a girl. One of the characters has a secret and when it gets out all hell breaks loose.  It's a story everyone can relate to, I would suggest this film to any one.  A++",1230681600,15,479,4.3
3414780,4,B0018BA70S,"The biggest problem with movies in general, from big-budget blockbusters to micro-budgeted indies, is that most directors forget that films must be digestible on both an immediate ""enjoyability"" level, and also on a long-term intellectual level. Well, they either forget, or they are unable to accomplish the feat of presenting both levels effectively.

""Midlothia"" is a commendable example of a film that deftly balances both sides, creating an entertaining and intriguing film-watching experience.

The film follows Fred (Bill Sebastian) as he haphazardly - sometimes violently - uncovers the hidden truths surrounding his closest friends. Far from simple plot points, these truths profoundly change how Fred views his friends and, most importantly, himself.

Production design, cinematography and editing is better than most micro-budgeted indies, and while the cast is very small, the acting is believable. I highly recommend this entertaining film.",1229558400,12,953,5.792857142857143

8269271,4,B0018BA70S,this movie was a real life drama . reminded me of where I grew up and how messed up lives are in rural areas.,1472515200,,109,3.5833333333333335
8269272,4,B0018BA70S,"The plot is that Fred is leaving the backwater Texas town where he has grown up  however, he does not show up for his leaving drinks. He has split with his fianc&eacute;e, April, and is leaving best mate Bill and not so best mate Duck behind.

Duck is not best pleased at losing a drinking buddy as his life has spiralled into an alcoholic miasma of meaningless since he got married and realised his life was going nowhere  slowly. April still harbours feelings for Fred but is not sure and Bill seems strangely aloof. Then Fred does an about face and declares he is not running away and will face the demons that made him want to leave  only he is not the only one who decides to face up to a few truths and what unfolds is actually a really well written and performed piece.

This is the sort of film that could have been a play. It has a tight but believable script and all of the actors are very good  James Thomas Gilbert playing Duck is a real scene stealer and I think is a talent that needs to get better gigs. The production lacks a bit in places but then this is an indie effort and it is funny, moving, and sad and even has some well placed pathos thrown in  not bad for a film I streamed on the off chance. If you like things to be slightly left off the field then this might be right up your street.",1469577600,3,1312,4.12156862745098

When the truth comes out, we learn that they are all pretty well traumatized by the lies they've told and the secrets that have have kept them bound to one another for so long.
