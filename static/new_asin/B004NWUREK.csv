8436862,4,B004NWUREK,"I do like it when folks step out of their comfort zone (even as I stay in my comfort zone). Take Olivia de Havilland, an actress who built a career starring in weepy melodrama. Why is it that I relish her more bouyant films? Because they make for a refreshing change? MY LOVE CAME BACK finds Ms. de Havilland in one of her rare lighthearted turns. She's very appealing in this one.

Word is that, post her Oscar nomination for GONE WITH THE WIND, she anticipated meatier roles. Imagine her chagrin when her home studio, Warner Brothers, instead cast her in this 1940 B-movie venture (after Priscilla Lane turned up her nose on the part). It worked out well, though, because director Curtis Bernhardt's script rewrites so bowled over the studio suits that they thumbed up MY LOVE CAME BACK to A-movie status.

Amelia Cornell (de Havilland) has earned the seat of 1st Violin in conductor Geza Peyer's (S.Z. Sakall) orchestra at the distinguished Brissac Academy of Music - except that, on occasion, it's an empty seat. See, Amelia and punctuality tend to not see eye to eye, mostly because, as a talented but impoverished scholarship student, Amelia often gives music lessons to supplement her family's income. But the academy frowns on them activities - her teaching for pay and her habitual tardiness. Oh, but were the Brissac fuddy-duddies to suspect that their prize violinist also likes to mash up classical and swing music...

MY LOVE CAME BACK sparkles on the strength of a droll script, of how winning our lead actress is, and a cast of veteran actors seemingly having a swell time on camera. The story conflict manifests when a secret benefactor succors an at her wits' end Amelia. That this benefactor claims an altruistic motive and goes on to chaperone her to fancy concerts so as to, ostensibly, expand her musical knowledge, and that Amelia is in the dark about his lecherous intent, well, those make up the core of contention. What the movie does is spin what could have been a sordid tale into an escapade that is blithe and fun and innocent (with just a whiff of naughty). Tack on an injection of classical culture, courtesy of Chopin and Liszt and of Mendelssohn smoothly segueing into swing. Olivia de Havilland is perfectly winning as the compromised young lady, never mind that a professional violinist had to hunker down behind her so as to double the fingering on the violin. Jeffrey Lynn lends a self-assured presence as the potential love interest who forms a love-hate relationship with Amelia. Jane Wyman and Eddie Albert are delightful as de Havilland's roommate/fellow violinist and her pianist beau who occasionally contemplates suicide, and these two do their share in complicating the plot for our heroine. S.Z. Sakall, he of the pinchable cheeks, conducts his usual comic blustering, and you just know that he'd get over his disgust of swing music. Much of the key to the film's tone being so light relies on Charles Winninger's performance. Winninger's hidden benefactor could've very easily come off as a despicable old goat, except that Winninger plays his role with warmth and with kindness and also a certain guilelessness. I couldn't be mad at him. And maybe we should credit Spring Byington who plays his disregarded wife. At the end of the day, her good sense punctures all the misunderstandings and false impressions.",1402099200,2,3357,4.896309314586995
8436863,4,B004NWUREK,"Olivia DeHavilland is pretty hard to not like in almost anything.  Here she puts in one of her lighter comedic performances with a nice supporting cast including Charles Winninger, Spring Byington, and SZ Sakall.  It is another comedy that relies on misunderstood motives and takes some nice little twists and turns along the way to keep it from being too predictable.  Jeffrey Linn is the leading man and handles the role fine.  The only real drawback is Eddie Alberts annoying performance as the pianist who wants to do swing instead of classical music, he is just over the top in his performance to the point you have to cringe when he is on screen.  It is still pretty good though.  For other better comedies of DeHavilland's see ""It's Love I'm After"" with Bette Davis and Leslie Howard, ""Hard to Get"" with Dick Powell and Winninger again, and ""Princess O'Rourke"" with Robert Cummings.",1390089600,2,889,4.815789473684211
8436864,5,B004NWUREK,"Amelia Cornell (Olivia de Havilland, age 24 at the time of this film) is a brilliant violinist who is attending the Brissac Academy of Music in New York City on a scholarship. Unfortunately, her family has serious financial problems, and the $60/month Amelia receives is only enough to support her in the city, not enough to help her family. Because the terms of her scholarship forbid her from giving violin lessons to earn extra money, no matter how vital it is to her family's survival, Amelia threatens to leave the school. Unexpectedly, an additional $100/month is added to her scholarship, which Dr. Kobbe (Grant Mitchell), the dean of the school, informs her is from the school itself. This is not the truth, and this important lie is the cornerstone of this wacky plot.

Dr. Kobbe has been urging Julius Malette (Charles Winninger) for some time to take the position of honorary director of the school. Julius is a middle-aged man who is the extremely wealthy owner of a corporation that manufactures phonographs and musical instruments. He is also a patron of the arts. Julius has shown nothing but boredom at Dr. Kobbe's offer until he sees beautiful, innocent Amelia perform. He is present when Amelia declares that she is leaving the school, and Dr. Kobbe convinces Julius to become Amelia's patron, the one actually paying the $100/month. The two of them agree to keep Julius's support a secret since Julius has a wife and two grown children, a son (William T. Orr) who works in a sinecure Vice President position in Julius's firm, and a daughter (Ann Gillis), who thinks she's a woman of the world at 16. Julius asks his factory manager, a highly competent young man named Tony Baldwin (Jeffrey Lynn), to make the monthly payment to Amelia through Tony's own expense account at the firm--again for purposes of secrecy. He doesn't tell Tony what the payment is for, and Tony discreetly doesn't ask.

Julius sends Amelia a phonograph player and invites her to many different musical events, and he frames all of that generosity as merely supporting her studies in preparation for becoming a concert violinist. In reality, Julius has a major crush on Amelia, but she never suspects because he never treats her with anything but friendly respect. Then one evening, Julius is unable to meet Amelia at a public ball, and he sends Tony to convey his regrets. Tony ends up dancing with Amelia all evening and falls hard for her. It is obvious that Amelia feels the same, but Tony ends the evening coldly, with no plans made to see her again, because he assumes Amelia is his boss's mistress.

There is a fun subplot with Amelia's roommate and fellow violinist from the Academy, Joy O'Keefe, played by beautiful Jane Wyman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Falcon-Crest/dp/B00005JOA4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Falcon Crest</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pollyanna/dp/B003QSKAIU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pollyanna</a>), who is only 23 at the time of this film. More well known for dramatic parts as a brunette, she does a great job here as a bubbly blonde. Eddie Albert (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roman-Holiday/dp/B000MYFILK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roman Holiday</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Green-Acres/dp/B0000V4906/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Green Acres</a>) is a youthful thirty-four at the time of this movie, and he gives a high-energy performance as Joy's band-leader boyfriend Dusty Rhodes. Dusty is a proponent of ""swing"" music, particularly combining it with classical music to make a new sound in popular entertainment, and he pulls Joy and Amelia along for the ride.

I am a huge fan of Olivia de Havilland (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Adventures-of-Robin-Hood/dp/B001NVIZ3E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Adventures of Robin Hood</a>), particularly her early romantic comedies. She is an extremely talented comic actress and outstanding at ensemble comedy such as this movie. This movie was made a year after her stellar dramatic performance as Melanie in Gone with the Wind. The director of this film is Curtis Bernhardt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kisses-for-My-President/dp/B000MQTJ2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kisses for My President</a>, Beau Brummell).

This is a fun screwball, romantic comedy. Amelia is a sweet girl who continually gets into trouble throughout the movie because she is too trusting, but she is no pushover. The way that she deals with Tony, her romantic interest, displays plenty of backbone, and there are plenty of fireworks when she puts him in his place.

The always terrific Spring Byington (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/You-Can-t-Take-it-With-You/dp/B001NEP8JA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">You Can't Take it With You</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Please-Don-t-Eat-the-Daisies/dp/B000QJYC0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Please Don't Eat the Daisies</a>) plays Julius's clever wife. This character is quite pivotal to the story. And though on first impression Mrs. Malette seems to be an unliberated, submissive, too-tolerant wife, it's both funny and fulfilling to experience how her character turns the tide by the end of the movie.

Another delightful addition to this superlative cast is jolly, rotund, character actor, S.Z. Sakall (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Casablanca/dp/B001EBWING/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Casablanca</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-in-Connecticut-1945/dp/B00316WYGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas in Connecticut 1945</a>), as Geza Peyer, a conductor and professor at the academy.

Movie tidbit: Olivia de Havilland's playing of the violin was created by having a real virtuoso violinist stand behind her and do the fingering while she manipulated the bow.

For fans of classic romantic comedy, screwball comedy, and these fine actors, this is a film not to be missed.

Regarding the DVD quality: This is an ""on demand"" DVD, meaning it is produced one at a time, in the same manner as print-on-demand books. It is created to play on a DVD, not on a PC drive. There are no extras. The film quality is acceptable, nothing fancy.",1364774400,5,6446,6.176142697881828
