938961,5,6304932561,It was a great movie it could be a great movie for any age. The movie had lots of funny parts and those parts where funny. When they start looking for the car well thats when the action starts. Hope you like the movie! Best fan Nicholas,932947200,,236,4.042553191489362
938962,1,6304932561,I think that this movie could have been better if it had Culkin in it! I don't recommend you buying it if you like comedy.,932947200,4,122,3.92
938963,4,6304932561,"I like this movie a lot more than the first two  Home Alone movies. While they all share well thought out traps and bashing of bad guys, this one had something different. Perhaps it was the fact that Alex (the main character)  is about 10 time cuter than the main character from Home Alone 1 and 2.  Anyway, Home Alone 3 is a fast, fun-filled romp and is a great watch for  future FBI agents! :)",929577600,,395,4.157894736842105
938964,3,6304932561,"It doesn't equal up to the original Home Alone with the hilarious Joe Pesci an Daniel Stern as the crooks. This one has stupid crooks which are not as funny as the original.  On the bright side, the kid is good in it,  but again, not as good as Macaulay Culkin. At best, this movie is just  average.",912902400,,299,4.120689655172414
938965,5,6304932561,"I think out of alll of the Home Alones, this one bye far rates the best.  There is a much better story to this one.  In the other one how could your forget you kid, then fly on a plane far away. This one is also has a lot of  funny parts unlike the other one.  I would rate this movire 5 stars and the  other one 3 stars.  I liked the kid that was in this a lot better the that  other kid.  This a whole new twist to the other two and is a very good  twist.  All this stuff in the movie is a little bit creative but more real  than the other ones.  I will bye this movie a soon is possible and I think  you should two.  I would rate this movie the best one that came out in  while.",911606400,2,681,3.6

Most people expect a second or third installment in a movie series to be bad so they look for the bad points. I did that also but, to my surprise, I found the movie had some merit. Certainly not worth a one star rating. The kid does a good job. It does have a good plot and I would say has good writers (I don't know that for a fact).

939666,4,6304932561,"I liked this movie a lot as a kid.  I remember watching this movie a lot 16-years ago with a group of friends over.  I also remember seeing this movie in the movie theater with my mom back then and she thought it was better than she expected.  I know this movie doesn't have very good reviews, but it is not always about the reviews.  It is more about your personal opinion and taste.
What I like about this movie, well this movie you can play anytime.  After watching the other two home alones recently, I think they only work during the holiday season.  This movie does not take place during Christmas, so it's more a regular entertaining film.  I like the opening scene in Home Alone 3, it's epic showing high tech criminals walking together in the airport.  Although a lot of people don't think international terrorists work as well as burglars in the other Home Alone films, they were by all means interesting characters and the beginning of the movie shows it.  They look cheesy during the climax.
Another thing I like about this film.  We remember how Kevin is such a bratty kid while watching Home Alone.  This kid is a much nicer kid, he seems much smarter too.  Basically, Alex would be easier to get along with than Kevin.  Alex also seems to come from a more normal family.  Well, that's my review.",1396051200,,1310,4.472573839662447

The first two Home Alone movies were good so, just stick with the original Home Alone and its first sequel. They're the only ones worth watching in this series.

Home Alone 1 and 2 is better than the 3rd movie.

Home Alone one and two are the best movies EVER in my book!! Don't waist your money!! There will always be another Macaulay Culkin!!!!!

The First 2 Where Better, so, because I would recommend just only to stick with the first two as the real true done deal with Culkin forever, ever and ever, AMEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Everything else about this movie is excruciatingly awful! Home Alone 3 lacks the charm, wit, and warmth that the first two movies had. First of all, the plot is just ridiculous. It's about the same as the original, but this time, the government is involved! Yeah, it's just plain silly. Second, the booby traps are a bit creative, but really, how could a little kid come up with stuff like this? The main character from the first two films didn't create traps as complex as this. So why how does THIS kid know when to hit the mark? Third, if these villains are professionals, then why do they have a hard time defeating the kid?! I know it's only a family film, but these villains have to at least act like grownups and, of course, have a BRAIN! And fourth, this movie as a whole is just not funny. There are only two jokes that work; the rest would make the entire room silent with anger and boredom. But whatever. Just watch the first two Home Alone films. This one just doesn't do them justice.

939877,1,6304932561,"I'll admit that I loved the first two Home Alone movies. They had a certain charm to them given the silliness of the story. This third installment oozes with something else other than charm. Everything that was great about the first two HA movies is absent from this movie. Not to mention that the story is much different than the first two.

Plot: Some hi-tech crooks hide a microchip inside of a remote-controlled toy car. During their time in the airport, their luggage gets switched with the luggage of the crotchety middle-aged woman that lives next door to the Pruitt family. The crooks realize that their luggage has been swapped with the old woman and finds out where she lives. On arrival they meet up with the snotty scamp Alex who realizes something is wrong with them and plans to thwart them while his mother is away.

Opinion: After reading the plot, you already know that this has nothing to do with the MCcallister  family. That is the least of its problems. What was fresh in the first two HA movies is now mundane. Every gag is the same: people get bonked upside the head with things and fall down. Alex D. Linz is about as bland as tofu. As a matter of fact, the whole cast is about as bland as tofu. The wisecracking parrot has more personality than these cardboard cutouts in this movie. The crooks made Harry and Marv look like geniuses. Did I forget to mention that this movie is lethally dull? Plus this movie is missing what made the first two great: Heart. This movie is emotionally distant like Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter's character in  Fight Club). Nothing about this movie is redeemable. It's all routine. You've seen it all before done better. Home Alone 3 and 4 are classic examples of ""milking the cow"".

On top of that, the mom even without knowing became ""acquainted"" with the bad guys (because they moved in down the street!!). Ha, I really enjoyed that part!

You can see this movie is different and more entertaining in different ways. I do miss the mom from the original 2 (Catherine O'Hara), I really liked her acting.

The kid is an evil genius type who has more toys than the Mythbusters. His traps are meant to maim or kill the so-called bad guys, who are so unbelievably stupid it is difficult to accept they would be smart enough to steal a computer chip. Speaking of the chip -- something like that would fail if it were handled by so many people; it has to be in an anti-static protective bag, not in a toy car. But most Hollywood types don't seem to know anything about computers. Or the range of a toy car's remote control. Or a TV remote control. Or how a small child could put barbells on a roof. Or move a 4x8 sheet of plywood...or.... In short, just about everything in this movie stretches credulity beyond even cartoon violence. This also proves that to pull off this concept you need a cast of people with talent. The original 2 films work only because of a good cast. It certainly isn't the writing. Left to the writing alone, this type of film just fails. It also leaves one with a sense of mean-spiritedness at the heart of the film.

The plot carries on the Home Alone theme: parents leaving young boy alone, burglars attack, boy's ingenuity foils them, siblings nasty to the nth.

Here, Home Alone goes high tech, on the burglars part and on the defender boy's as well.  From outset, scene is set with defense part chip that gets mistakenly taken at airport security and ends up in young boy's remote car, which thus becomes center point in the plot.

The defensive measures this Alex takes up are what makes this one so good!  From aid of talkin parrot to yarn wound electrified wire, this one caused great laughter.

The bad guys include a girl this time, and are more hi tech & advanced than Marv & Harry ever were. They may be more classier than Marv & Harry, but they still get outwitted by a little boy. This time, the little boy is played by Alex D Linz, who has never been heard of again after this. Another child star down the drain. It's pretty much the same storyline, his parents are hard workers, he has chickenpox, they have to work. He gets up to no good, and has an older brother & sister, the sister played by Scarlett Johannsen.

The parrot is absolutely hilarious! For me, the parrot was the best thing about the entire movie. It certainly added a whole new level to the movie with the parrot helping out with the hi jinx too. He comes out with some classic lines, as do the rest of the cast.

It's one of the Home Alone movies that some people will not fancy. True it's missing a cast member, but the parrot more than makes up for it. Alex D Linz however? Nah.",1167955200,2,1151,4.1524663677130045

Stretching the number of bad guys from two to four was overload and, to boot, none of them were funny.  The booby traps, as another reviewer pointed out, were simply unrealistic in their execution (so much so that you couldn't suspend disbelief for just those few seconds) and when the bad guys were caught in them their comedic execution was beyond plastic.

I'm guessing that Roger Ebert said this was better than the first two so as to make the child star of this movie feel good.  But the ugly truth is Home Alone 3 isn't worth the effort.  The whole movie is contrived and talk about putting out sequels to make more money from a proven formula!

But its producers didn't want to let go and decided to pursue a third chapter in the series, which turned out to be a dreadful decision.
Home Alone 3 was an unnecessary addition.  The story doesn't have anything to do with the McCallister family and Alex's relationship with his family is not nearly as funny as Kevin's.  In this one, there are no unique siblings or relatives like Buzz, Kevin's cousins, or the very cheap Uncle Frank.  There really is no sense of character or family relationships in this film.
I give credit to Alex D. Linz, because he had tough shoes to fill and the writers didn't really give him any good lines.  But Alex's character was not mischievous like Kevin McCallister in the first two.  That's why this movie shouldn't have had the title Home Alone in it.
Overall, this movie was highly fictional and unnecessary.  Four intelligent spies getting out-witted by an 8 year-old.  Come on!
I haven't seen the fourth one that just came out, but I'm sure it will be painful for any adult to watch.  Especially someone who has seen 1 & 2.

If you keep an open mind and not criticize this movie for not being related to the first two, then you will definately enjoy Home Alone 3.

940048,5,6304932561,"I liked Home Alone. I loved Home Alone 2. I didn't think anything could possibly top the sight of Tim Curry on his knees telling a fictitious hotel patron that 'he loved him'.
Boy, was I wrong.
Many people seem to have taken issue with Home Alone 3 because it does not follow on directly from the 2nd film in the series. Really, is that such a huge deal? If anything, it's what made this movie work. They didn't try to make another 'Kevin' story, but went for something totally different, just using the same plot - David vs. Goliath in a house of horrors that David set up.
And as for trashing Alex D. Linz in the role, please.... At least this child could act. My biggest gripe with the first two Home Alone movies was that Macauly Culkin constantly sounded like he was reading his lines straight out of the script, rather than something that was rehearsed.
But back to the story. The premise of this tale is that four criminal masterminds have obtained a stolen chip, with the intention of selling it to a mega-rich (mega-dangerous) buyer.
Through a totally plausible mix up at the airport, the chip (which is hidden inside a remote controlled toy car) ends up in the hands of an elderly lady. The crooks chase her all the way back to Chicago to try and recover the chip and save their own rear ends.
This is another factor which worked well for the movie. Whereas with the first two films, it was funny because Harry and Marv were such an obvious pair of morons. The four crims in HA3 are supposed to be smart, which makes it so much more delicious when Alex makes idiots of them.
The hero of the story, Alex, is by himself not through any family holiday mix-ups, but rather because he has chicken pox, and both parents have to work. Like Kevin McAllister, Alex is portrayed as being rather hard done by as far as his family goes. He's the butt of endless jokes and tormenting by his older brother and sister, and when he begins reporting the suspicious activity going on his neighbourhood, no one will believe him.
Hence, he decides eventually to take matters into his own hands, find out just what is going on and do something about it.
There are some absolutely hilarious scenes in this film. Particularly the scene when Alex sends the car with a video camera taped to the top to try and get evidence to prove he is not lying.
And the inevitable confrontations in the end with the crooks have to be seen to be believed.
The best parts to watch for are firstly the incident with the mouse and the iron bar. If you thought Marv's screams in Home Alone 2 (when the pigeons were attacking them) were hysterical, then this one surpasses all possible expectations. Who would have thought a grown man was capable of hitting such a perfect high note...?
And secondly, the parrot is a complete crack-up. Watch for the shower scene, it's the best.
Like the first two movies, this has the standard little-boy-makes-friends-with-aloof-and-outcast-neighbour ploy. The plot is basically the same in all three movies, but the introduction of a completely new cast has done wonders.
This film is not the disaster that some would have you believe, and if you enjoyed the first two Home Alone movies, then it's hard to imagine that you wouldn't like the 3rd installment. Just do yourself a big favour, see it for yourself and make up your own mind. Because it really is worth it.",1068595200,6,3368,4.541118421052632

And the movies weren't necessarily played out because Macaulay Culkin had gotten older; they were played out anyway. I guess this movie was a vehicle to lift Alex D. Linz to superstar status, which, consequently, didn't happen (have you heard from him since then?). Parts of the movie were interesting, but not many. And you know a movie is weak when it's a so-called ""sequel"" yet none of the original characters are in it (see also House Party 4 - wait, don't).",1048464000,2,530,4.589473684210526
940109,3,6304932561,"I first liked this movie when I first saw it but now when I think about this, this movie totally ruins the home alone sequence.  Here are some examples.
1)  The movie has nothing to do with Kevin McCallister or any relationship with the first 2 movies.  So just because it has a kid setting traps like the first 2, is this really considered a sequel? because sequels usually have relationships to its previous films and this one didn't.
2)  The bad guys in the movie are not crooks like Marve and Harry.  These guys happen to be a group of masterminds and computer geniuses that are not wanted by the police but instead the FBI.
3)  It has a very bizzare plot.  The reason why the criminals are here is because of luggage mixup.  It was kind of stupid too because there bag was behind someones luggage and but comes out of the x-ray machine first and was identical to another bag.  And not only that, how could the lady who took their bag by accident have not realized it was the wrong bag.  It took the criminals less then 10 seconds to realize they had the wrong luggage.  They need their bag because it had a toy car that they hid a missil chip inside of that they need.
4)  The new hero, Alex (Alex d. Linz from Max Keeble's big Move) isn't staying home alone because his family went on vacation and forgot him but because he has chicken and stays home from school and his parents have to go work.
5)  An 8 year old boy takes out 4 supergeniouses.  Lets just take a minute to think WHAT IS UP WITH THAT????????  I know in the first 2 we have an 8 year old boy taking out criminals but those guys were morons.  Where dealing with people who have mini camers on their singlasses and intercept phone calls.  These guys are wanted by the FBI and they are dumb enough to get trapped by a little kid.  One trap where Alex put yarn and a wire together and hooking to a cord making it electrical.  The guy was sp stupid into cutting the wire, why didn't he just walk around it?
I agree with another rviewer that this movie shouldn't have been called home alone.  It had nothing to do with the original and brought us a totally different storyline.  It is like Halloween 3.  I'll admit this movie is kind of funny but becomes boring later.  This is one product that I recommend not to get but if you do intend on watching this movie then rent it.  But if you still like then go ahead and buy this movie because this is only what I think.  There many of other people who would say this is there favorite movie.  I'm just not one of them.

The plot is very interesting, it will keep you at the edge of your seat. Since the villains are professionals now (and more realistic), they act serious, therefore the stunts are not as funny.  In the first two, the villains were so stupid you could laugh at the sight of them (they ocasionally cursed at Kevin which sounded so funny).

The Christmas message is totally gone here however (even though it IS during the Christmas season), they could've made this movie at any other time in winter and you wouldn't have noticed the difference.  No Christmas music, no reunions, no Church or Christmas tree, etc.  (some decorations though).

If you're looking for a nice child action movie (and you don't pursue the Christmas scenario) this is the movie for you & your family.

The 3 bad guys,  actually 2 men and a woman, acted and directed brilliantly I felt, come  across as extremely dangerous and smart criminals at the very beginning.  As things get heated up however, Alex outsmarts these adult crooks, who are  looking for a top secret electronic device, which all the while is of  course right under their noses.  There are some brilliant technological  tricks used in the story, for example the camcorder on the remote control  car which sends a video signal back to Alex.  Alex is unstoppable in his  foiling the crooks, and that translates to cartoon-like comedy.  Adults  won't be fooled by the same unbelievable stunts that the kids will just  marvel over.  Both adults and kids will love the talking parrot, who even  sings a piece of ""Bad Bad LeRoy Brown"". The movie is obviously  made for kids, with all the kid heroism going on, but adults who pay close  attention will enjoy many of the dual-meaning and sometimes satirical lines  of the bad guys, often poignant and above the level of most children's  understanding.

Not only did Maculy Culkin not return (A big drop), neither did Harry and Marv (Another big drop).  You think they at least  bring the crokes back so they can try something new, like trying to  outsmart a new kid.  Don't support this movie unless your buying it used.  And even then I don't recomend it.",952473600,4,396,4.27027027027027
940180,2,6304932561,it was funny but if you look at all the things this small little 8-9 year old kid can do.  I can not see how a boy like that can hook up electricity or do so many traps. wasn't alex sick with the chicken pox and he did all  those traps! by himself very likely they don't show us many of the harder  traps (Calkin you saw all his traps being made by himself). I reckon go  back to leaving the kid home alone while the family is on vacation (bring  back Marv and Harry).,948672000,,468,3.8842105263157896

I have  to say that the first one was the very original and the second 1 was more  detail but it lacked into like the feature i mean it was harder to follow  so the second 1 & first one come in on a tie & the 3rd 1 i have  2  say beat them by 1 point or 1/2 point because this 1 was more substanined,  It wasn't all over the place i have seen them all, so u need to also and  make the final judgement.",944352000,,616,3.5864661654135337

One surprise was the older sister role played by Scarlet Johansen (aka the black widow - Avenger).
