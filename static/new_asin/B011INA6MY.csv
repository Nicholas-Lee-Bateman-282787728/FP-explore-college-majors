8724356,4,B011INA6MY,"Compared to the original Hanna-Barbera classic series, the hybrid features can't compete with the classic series, especially if you grew up with said series like my family. However, the 2 holiday specials for Halloween and Christmas actually have a fighting chance of being good like the classic series, since they're wrapped around by CGI wraparounds and the animation in between is hand-drawn (but with CG effects of course). Strangely, since it debuted in 2013, Smurfy Hollow was never seen on CN or Boomerang, unlike their own take on a Christmas Carol from 2011. Since all 4 of these and the Lost Village came from Sony, a lot of folks don't consider them being affiliated with Hanna-Barbera or the WB at all, even the holiday specials, strange as it seems. What you think of these and the old show is up to you; no matter what you think, these'll give you a Smurfy time at any time of the year!",1534982400,,900,4.666666666666667

8724360,5,B011INA6MY,"The Smurfs films are cute and fun to watch. I personally prefer Smurfs and Smurfs 2. The Lost Village is less appealing and entertaining.
