8107758,5,B000E99ZDA,"Dick Gabriel, Lexington-area sports media personality for many years, has put together an in-depth look at Adolph Rupp. The importance of this documentary is that it attempts to get to the bottom of some of the controversies surrounding Rupp. Over the years Adolph Rupp has been maligned in the national sports media as a racist. Rather than speculate and beat around the bush Gabriel goes straight to the earliest African-American players who played for Rupp and interviews them. He also interviews a large number of associates and players from all eras in which Rupp coached.

The responses of the interviewees, including the African-American players, to a man is that Rupp was in no way a racist. In fact, the documentary reveals that Rupp went out of his way earlier than most programs to try to help African-American players break the color barrier. The documentary goes into the cultural and administrative pressures imposed on Rupp, which is key in understanding the man's coaching career.

Unlike the amateurish reporting of certain national sports reporters, Gabriel weaves together a complete portrait of Rupp based on actual fact rather than hearsay and inuendo. Aside from debunking the accusations of racism, the documentary also goes into other parts of Rupp's career and life. Interviews with members of Rupp's family are particularly interesting in terms of learning about the non-basketball persona of Rupp.

This documentary is impressive, especially given that it was not made on a high budget. It is professionally done and historically accurate. Rather than editorialize and narrate for the bulk of the documentary, Gabriel lets the associates and ex-players of Rupp speak for themselves. If you are a fan of sports history, a UK supporter, or just a college basketball fan in general then you will benefit from watching this documentary on one of the most successful coaches in basketball history.",1216598400,3,1919,5.224025974025974
8107759,5,B000E99ZDA,"Finally, some true, factual, objective information that looks at the reality of the terrible character assassination that Sports Illustrated and Bryant Gumbel of (then) CBS did, in a pathetic attempt to garner ratings for both.

Their charges and innuendo are simply that.  No proof, just suggestions not supported by facts.

This DVD is the first to present factual information for the fans to digest and evaluate for themselves in an objective fashion, rather than the kind of knee-jerk reaction that Sports Illustrated and Bryan Gumbel can get by suggesting 'racism' which is a highly charged emotional topic that rarely produces facts to support that case.

I would like to see Bryant Gumbel and Frank DeFord (of Sports Illustrated) respond to this factual information regarding Adolph.

For anyone whom is interested in exploring the facts and not the innuendo of this emotional subject, this DVD is a must.

Some of the facts of the matter are that Mr. Rupp did recruit the Great Wesley Unseld.........he expressed his concerns to Mr. Unseld's parents that the SEC was not integrated and that Mr. Unseld would be subject to the attitudes of the deep south when they traveled on the road games.  Mr. Rupp felt he had an obligation for any of his recruits actual safety, and he told the Unseld's that things could be rough down there and that he couldn't guarantee anyone's safety.

He also recruited Mr. Kentucky, Butch Beard (both Unseld and Beard went to Louisville, where they were consensus All-Americans), but the same kinds of issues existed for Mr. Beard that existed for Mr. Unseld.

The SEC was not integrated at the time...........is that the fault of Mr. Rupp.........hardly.

Mr. Rupp also points out that he would not take a team on the road that would not be allowed to eat in the same restaurant or stay together in the same hotel as a team.  If any of you (that think Mr. Rupp was so bad) were coaching today, and were told that certain members of your team could not eat in the same restaurant as the rest of the team, or could not stay in the same hotel with the rest of the team, or would be taunted and threatened with their lives..........how would you handle it?

It took a strong personality like that of Mr. Rupp to tell those recruits what they were going to be getting into and to not just recruit them for the sake of breaking the segregation barrier........he had a responsibility to tell the truth to those recruits and that is what he did.

It was going to be pure hell for a person of color to break the color barrier of the SEC at that time.  Just look at what the American Great Jackie Robinson had to endure........and that was in major cities in the Northern belt of America. In the 60's, maybe the rest of the country was coming around, but the SEC was having nothing to do with it.

Mr. Rupp did not invent racism as many have seemingly implied...........he was forced to live in segregated conditions that existed in the SEC at that time, and this DVD goes a long way towards helping one to understand the circumstances of the word 'segregated in the SEC'.

Both Mr. Gumbel and Mr. DeFord would do well to see this DVD before they open their mouths again for the sake of ratings.  Mr. DeFord obviously only thought of himself at the time and did not say anything.  If Mr. Rupp comitted such a moral sin as Mr. DeFord claims, then why did he keep his mouth shut for over 30 years?  Mr. DeFord has no moral grounds to stand on.

Shame, Shame, Shame on Mr. Gumbel and Mr. DeFord for playing the race card to garner ratings for themselves.

Today in the media, the usage of the word racism, creates controversy, and controversy translates today into the word 'ratings', which means higher advertiser dollars, regardless of whether or not there is any truth or examination of the facts of the matter.  In media.........dollars and profits are God, not the truth.

For goodness sakes...........look at Professional Wrestling.  It is all about the money, not about the truth.",1199404800,2,4011,4.672830725462305
