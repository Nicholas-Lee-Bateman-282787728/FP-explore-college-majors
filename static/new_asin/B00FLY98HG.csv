6014103,5,B00FLY98HG,"We have found that the Dino Dan's Trek's Adventures ""Tyrannosaurus Trek"" is a great addition to the Dino Dan line.  The kids love Trek and this DVD included 5 short Trek Adventures.  I find them to be the the perfect length so we can watch one or two and turn the tv off with no issues.  The episodes are all engaging, interesting, and fun.  The 5 Senses Treasure Hunt was a favorite as well as the episode where Trek writes a dino story.  The kids enjoyed the animated part of that episode and it gave a nice flow to the entire DVD.

Trek is an engaging fun little boy that brings big adventure to the screen.  We highly recommend this new DVD.  My husband and I have been enjoying viewing this with our children as well.  *We received a sample copy as part of the NSider club.",1392768000,,778,4.238095238095238

6014142,2,B00FLY98HG,"From all 5 star reviews showing for this film on Amazon I thought I had a good bet at getting at least a somewhat enjoyable movie for boys about the age of the actor shown.

Wow. I did not like it at all. And I have found that if a movie can't at least mildly entertain me, then boys around 7 to 12 are not going to like it much either. Frankly even the Baby Einsteins keep adults' ...and even older kids' (though they deny it) attention. But the acting in Dino Dan was so stiff and clumsy that it took my attention away from whatever poorly conceived story-line there way.

I could feel my IQ points draining out of my head, instead of my imagination growing.

I could not even watch to the end. I bought the movie, and I HATE wasting money.

WHY is it that most of the children's films on Amazon have 5 star ratings, when at least half do not nearly approach a reason to rate them that high?",1414108800,2,893,4.114942528735632

6014148,5,B00FLY98HG,"We LOVE the new Dino Dan video!!!  ""Trek's Adventures"" is great! Dan has passed the torch to his younger brother, and Trek really enjoys keeping the dino experiments going. As always, there is lots of information is packed into each episode. My 5-year-old son and 8-year-old nephew said they love it! They especially likes that the grandmother can do ""everything!"" They also noticed that some of Trek's tools and safety gear are upgraded, and ""Trek still knows a TON about dinosaurs; he probably learned it all from Dan."" Great sequel to the original.",1407456000,,551,4.924731182795699

6014150,5,B00FLY98HG,"We received this Dino Dan DVD as a gift, and honestly, I wasn't sure my girly girl 3 year old would want anything to do with it. She normally likes princess sing along songs and watching Disney movies! But as soon as she saw it come out of the packaging, she was asking if we could put it on. So, that evening we decided to give it a shot, and she has continued to ask to watch more Dino Dan since. The show really keeps them engaged as they are doing dino experiments and she loved pointing out all the different colored dinos. Our favorite on this DVD was the senses scavenger hunt episode, as she liked helping Trek to look for all of the clues. I am one surprised, but very happy mama, and we will be watching more Dino Dan when we can!",1406678400,2,740,4.110344827586207
6014151,5,B00FLY98HG,"I received this DVD for reviewing purposes, but my opinions are my own. Both of my kiddos have enjoyed viewing Dino Dan Trek's Adventures. It has definitely inspired their imaginations, and brings out the ""what if"" in their play, especially with my six year old son. I love how they are learning all sorts of information about dinosaurs in a fun and entertaining way through all 5 of Trek's Adventures featured on this DVD.",1406592000,2,423,4.72972972972973
6014152,5,B00FLY98HG,"Ever since discovering Dino Dan a year or so ago our kids have been HUGE HUGE fans - especially our son who is enthralled with the world of dino's these days. :) Our girls enjoy it very much as well...and oftentimes I even overhear them quoting a line from Dino Dan - usually one of the humorous lines! This latest release of Dino Dan - Tyrannosaurus Trek was just as popular as the DVD's that featured mainly Dan. It has lots of great facts and information for kids to absorb & learn, but it also captured the attention of our children very easily - and held their attention too! In our opinion, the DVD includes everything a good children's DVD needs - humor, fun and easy to follow story lines, and some educational parts to keep our kids' minds active & learning! I would highly recommend any Dino Dan DVD's, including this latest release, Tyrannosaurus Trek!",1406332800,2,863,4.538461538461538

6014156,5,B00FLY98HG,My children cant get enough of this Dino Dan spinoff.  Trek inspires kids to problem solve and consider different outcomes in a scientific way.  Theres a lot of opportunity for learning through this DVD.  Kids are encouraged to use their senses and observation skills to find out more about the dinosaurs.  Kids learn that writing can be kind of fun when they get into it!  I received this DVD to review. The opinions shared here are 100% mine.,1405296000,,444,4.641025641025641

When I saw this available, I got it for him to download on his kindle for when we go out. He's always asking to watch Dino Dan now. This is basically a compilation of a few episodes he's already seen on tv but he doesn't care if he's already seen it.
