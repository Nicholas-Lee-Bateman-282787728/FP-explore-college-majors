7905525,2,B000009MRO,"IT'S A MAD MAD MAD WORLD (1987) is an amusing character-driven Hong Kong comedy about a middle-class family beset with all sorts of social and financial woes. Bill Tung (Uncle Bill from Jackie Chan's SUPERCOP and RUMBLE IN THE BRONX) plays a news anchor at a local TV station who has a very demanding wife (Lydia Shum) and three growing daughters at home in an apartment block where all of their problems become the talk of their neighbors. Bill gets fired from the station after trying to humiliate his bitchy co-anchor on air (in one of the film's funnier sequences). As the family seems headed for poverty, they win the lottery, which ultimately causes as many problems as it solves. Things take a melodramatic turn in the last 20 minutes when the boyfriend (Eric Tsang) of the oldest daughter does a despicable thing to the family to help some hoodlum buddies get hold of the lottery winnings. He is eventually let off the hook much too easily for American audiences' tastes. (The crime he commits would once have gotten him the death penalty in the U.S.!)
There are more chuckles than actual laughs here, although some of the gags are quite clever, including the youngest daughter's dream sequence about a school science fair in which her working miniature nuclear power plant suddenly goes into meltdown. The three lead cast members, Bill Tung, Lydia Shum, and Eric Tsang, are all top-ranked comic performers in Hong Kong. While western audiences may be more familiar with Jackie Chan's stunt-filled comedies, this film offers a less frantic comedy of errors about ordinary life in Hong Kong and should give American HK buffs greater insight into the culture that produces the cinema they've come to love.",989539200,,1711,4.883161512027492
