368708,5,6301805615,"This a classic western from 1946.  Gregory Peck did  one of  his  finest jobs of acting playing  the hot-blooded Lewt McCanles.(He should have won an Oscar for this performance).  Lewt's brother, Jesse played by  (Joseph  Cotton), is the opposite of Lewt clearheaded and calm.  They  become rivals  when they meet Pearl played by (Jennifer Jones), a beautiful half-breed  Indian girl who comes to live on their ranch.
Though she's won over by  Lewt, his volatile nature ultimately leads to trouble, igniting the film's  explosive climax.  This is a unlikely ending in any movie today.  But is  pulled off nicely by Peck & Jones.  This film should go down as one of  hollywood's top 100 movies of all-time.",960940800,4,705,4.871794871794871
368709,5,6301805615,"Since I can't address the claims that the film is racist-- hey, they got away with a lot in 1946-- I'll plug this film if for no other reason than that it shows a side of Gregory Peck that fans could scarcely imagine  possible.  Jones had just come from playing Saint Bernadette and Peck had  come off the success (and an Oscar nomination) of ""Keys of the  Kingdom"" when they were cast in this one.  The Catholic church was  appalled by it (all the more reason for me to like it!).  Peck is marvelous  as the almost-lovable criminal Lewt, outshining Cotten, who got the role  you'd expect Peck to have been given-- the straight man.

The sight of Jennifer Jones playing a ""half-breed""(ie. Mestiza, A Mexican) in brown grease-paint is offensive to the sensiblities of this 21st century Latina.  Plays heavily on the stereo-type of women of color being sexually loose.

368746,5,6301805615,"Duel in the Sun was a ""game changer"" western in the 40's. David Selznick tried to outdo his ""Gone With The Wind"" and the narrow-minded critics had no clue just how revolutionary and classic his movie was.  As I watched it, I saw so many westerns that came in the 50's ( especially ""Giant"") and the 60's on up.  David Selznick envisioned the kinds of monumental westerns that would come in the future and had to battle the brain-dead simpletons who lacked his vision and maturity in breaking traditions which impoverished movies of this period!  To see Gregory Peck as a sexual predator and Jennifer Jones go from innocent Indian maiden to a young girl who becomes ""hot to trot""  is a hoot!  For me, the music was the best thing about this movie! (It captured the emotions and monumentality of the movie perfectly.)  The color and the stark terrain of the movie were far ahead of its time and it should never have been criticized by anyone and yet it was!.  The finale of the movie is operatic but unforgettable: truly mythic!  This is absolutely one of my favorite movies and I am sorry that it received such invective and negativity from the shallow-minded critics of the time.
While I truly loved ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" and felt that Harold Russell truly deserved the two Oscars he won, I feel that David Selznick should have won an Academy Award for Best Movie and Jennifer Jones should have won an Academy Award for Best Actress.  David Selznick was truly a great director and I wish he had gotten the recognition he deserved.",1508630400,2,1537,4.58029197080292

368777,3,6301805615,"Duel in the Sun is a Cain and Abel allegory about good son Jesse McCanies (Joseph Cotton) and bad son Lewt (Gregory Peck) set in the Old West. Unrefined half-breed Pearl Chavez (Jennifer Jones) has been invited by her cousin (Lillian Gish) to the Spanish Bit Ranch in Texas, which is run by embittered and crippled cattle baron Senator McCanies (Lionel Barrymore). Pearls dad was hanged for killing his Indian wife and her lover. Jesse is the Senators older lawyer son who is cultured, gentle, and ever-tempered. Lewt is the amoral, gun-toting, evil younger son, who takes whatever he wants. Jesse and Lewt soon clash over Pearl.

David O Selznick (Gone With the Wind) produced Duel in the Sun in grand style, hoping  it would surpass Gone With the Wind in quality and box office receipts. For a 1946 film, it is pretty suggestive, with passion and sex simmering throughout. It was quite shocking for audiences back then to see Peck playing against his usual screen persona. Hes fiery and lascivious when he looks at Pearl, his thoughts crystal clear. The sexual undertones throughout are unmistakable.

The supporting cast is impressive and includes Herbert Marshall, Walter Huston, Charles Bickford, Butterfly McQueen, Sidney Blackmer, and Orson Welles. Though King Vidor (The Big Parade, The Crowd) is the credited director, he was plagued by constant interference by Selznick and other uncredited  directors  Josef von Sternberg, William Dieterle, William Cameron Menzies, Sidney Franklin  contributed their talents. The movie was filmed in Technicolor.

Selznick hoped that this film would propel his then-lover, Jennifer Jones,  to super stardom, which never happened. The film did well at the box office, but didn't come close to achieving either the popularity of financial returns of Gone With the Wind.

Bonus materials on the Blu-ray release include the roadshow version with prelude, overture and exit music; audio commentary; interview with Cecilia Peck, Carey Peck and Anthony Peck; and trailer gallery.",1502928000,4,2017,5.258566978193146
368778,5,6301805615,"Review of Duel in the Sun
Hot Toasty Rag, August 8, 2017

Everyone knows Gregory Peck as the very picture of American integrity, but my favorite of his performances is Duel in the Sun. Theres no trace of Atticus Finch in this movie; every bit of him is bad, and he never looked so good. In this wildly romantic drama, Jennifer Jones is torn between the kind, stable, respectful Joseph Cotton and the bad, manly, sexy Gregory Peck. Tough decision!

After his successful production of Gone with the Wind, its no wonder David OSelznick created such a beautiful, exciting love triangle. And while the script was original written for Teresa Wright, Jennifer Jones ended up playing the lead and marrying her producer three years later. You can find lots of trivia about what a headache the film was to make, including a very funny argument between OSelznick and Dimitri Tiomkin about the musical score, but in my review Id rather focus on the positives.

Jennifer Jones plays a half-breed who comes to live with Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore in Texas. Yes, its terribly politically incorrect, but youve got to get into the dated mindset to appreciate the story. Lionel is grouchy and racist, Jenny desperately wants to cling to her purity, and marrying a half-breed is unthinkable in a respectable family. Despite all that, its a wonderful romantic drama. Lush, exciting, well-written, well-acted, dramatic, and heart-wrenching, Duel in the Sun earns its place among the greatest classic romances of all time. Jenny gives a wonderfully layered performance, juggling sweet, sultry, innocent, trampy, and passionate. Greg is a delicious bad boy; its a miracle he didn't get typecast as a villain for the rest of his career. Add in crotchety Lionel, Lillian as an unfair mother, Joseph Cotton as a pre-Atticus Finch, Herbert Marshall, Charles Bickford, Walter Huston, and Butterfly McQueen, and you have an unforgettable cast.

While this might not be the best first date movie, watch this with your long-time sweetie pie, or with a bunch of your girlfriends. Its pretty heavy, but its definitely one to watch.",1502150400,2,2105,5.005714285714285
368779,2,6301805615,"Why do some say it's a classic?
Jennifer Jones wasn't a very beautiful woman. She's covered with a ton of makeup here.
Peck is his usual stoic, cold self.
Cotton was always cold and distant.

368780,5,6301805615,"I am really excited to wait to get the blu ray of this movie. You surely will enjoy to watch totally different attraction of Jennifer Jones

368791,5,6301805615,"Released in 1946 and directed by King Vidor, Duel in the Sun stars Gregory Peck and Joseph Cotton as two rival sons of a ranch baron (Lionel Barrymore) in West Texas in the 1880s. When a striking half-breed (Jennifer Jones) comes to live on the ranch, she inspires love in the mild-mannered, educated son (Cotton) and unpredictable lust in the mocking, wild one (Peck). Lillian Gish plays the mother stuck in the middle while Walter Huston appears as a semi-questionable minister known as The Sinkiller. Charles Bickford is on hand as an older man also interested in the drama mama.

While the movie runs 2 hours and 24 minutes, a full 16 minutes is opening and ending music, which makes the runtime of the story itself just over 2 hours. Speaking of the opening Prelude and Overture, the music (by Dimitri Tiomkin) is thoroughly pass and goes on way too long at 12 minutes before the credits, which last another 1:35. If you can get past that, though, this is a great old Western where the producers pulled out all the stops to entertain. Producer, writer and (uncredited) director David O. Selznicks ambition was to top King Kong (1933) and, particularly, Gone with the Wind (1939), two other pictures he produced.

Although critics fittingly dubbed it Lust in the Dust, the movie WAS popular with the masses, no doubt helped by its controversial sexual content (which is tame today) and Selznick's affair with Jones, which broke up both of their marriages. They got married a few years later and it lasted till his death in 1965. Despite its box office success, Duel couldn't top Gone with the Wind and, being the most expensive film ever made at that point, it only broke even, although it eventually went on to make a profit with a re-release in 1954, etc.

Jones is notable as the heavy-breathing babe, but I personally prefer Joan Tetzel as the fianc of the older son (Cotton). Also, Peck plays the bad son surprisingly well, considering how hes known for playing more noble protagonists, e.g. The Big Country (1958) and Mackennas Gold (1969).

Bottom line: Duel in the Sun was just too big of a production to lose. Its story, while decidedly melodramatic, is compelling from beginning to end and there are highlights spiced throughout, including some stunning cinematography, amusing moments with horses and a couple of almost shocking sequences and story turns (e.g. the shootout in the saloon and, later, on the town street). To be expected, there are also some lowlights, but the movie always quickly recovers and maintains its footing. Lastly, there's a valuable moral hidden within the Western soap operatic shenanigans.

The film was shot in Arizona & California (too many places to list). The script was written by David O. Selznick & Oliver H.P. Garrett (and, uncredited, Ben Hecht) suggested by a novel by Niven Busch. ADDITIONAL CAST: Herbert Marshall, Harry Carey, Scott McKay & Butterfly McQueen.

368792,5,6301805615,"For all of its troubles during production and post-production, Duel In The Sun ranks as one of the greatest cinematic photoplays ever made alongside D.W. Griffith's The Birth Of A Nation, Cecil B. DeMille's The King Of Kings, Selznick's own Gone With The Wind, and both silent (1923, 1925) and sound versions (1956, 1959)of The Ten Commandments and Ben-Hur: A Tale Of The Christ.  While certainly no Gone With The Wind, nevertheless the epic feel of that monumental motion picture is felt here and Jennifer Jones resembles Vivien Leigh in some shots. Gregory Peck is wondrously cast against type, and wears the villain's mantle very well. Joseph Cotton does a splendid job, and veteran actors Lionel Barrymore, Lillian Gish (D.W. Griffith's The Birth Of A Nation, Intolerance: Love's Struggle Through The Ages, Broken Blossoms), Walter Huston, and Charles Bickford round out a star-studded cast, providing as beautiful and rich a background as the gorgeous vistas of Texas. This movie has some really amazing shots of the sky, and is a testament to Selznick and King Vidor's mastery of the cinema. I highly recommend this epic masterpiece.

Time cannot change its impassive face, nor dim the legend of the wild young lovers who found Heaven and Hell in the shadows of the rock."" Nicknamed ""Lust in the Dust"", this film pushed the steamy movie envelope for its time...the directors cut failed to pass the Hay's Code censors and had to be heavily edited. But by today's standards this lavishly produced Western is strictly PG-13. Jennifer Jones is the sultry Pearl Chavez, a half-breed who goes to live with her father's relatives after he is hanged for killing her mother and her mother's lover. The rich and powerful rancher, Jackson McCanles is the patriarch of the family and resents having Pearl in his home; but the matriarch, Laura Belle, played beautifully by Lilian Gish, treats her lovingly as a daughter. The plot centers around Pearl's relationship with Cain & Abel-like brothers: Joseph Cotton is the educated, gentlemanly brother; Jesse; and Gregory Peck is the rogue brother, Lewt...an off-type role for peck, but he plays it well. The all-star cast continues with Walter Huston as the gun-toting preacher, called the ""Sin Killer""; Charles Bickford as a ranch foreman suitor of Pearl; Harry Carey, as a long time friend of Jackson McCanles and Butterfly McQueen as the McCanles maid. Produced by David O. Selznick, he had high hopes this film would rival ""GWTW"" and that his lover and future wife, Jennifer Jones, would be the next Vivien Leigh. Though it was a big box office hit, it is a far cry from ""GWTW"" and Jones was no Vivien Leigh. Still an excellent Western and highly recommended!",1432252800,8,1727,4.938144329896907

368878,4,6301805615,"Matt here again with Duel In The Sun. After having a monster hit with Gone With The Wind in 1939, David O. Selznick decided to recreate the success by producing epic pictures using the Roadshow Formula that he coined with Gone With The Wind. Duel in the Sun was the next attempt to do so & to be honest, it was okay but the attempts to recreate the success he had with GWTW were evident with the spectacular vistas, having an Overture & Exit Music & the final nail in the coffin was casting Butterfly McQueen in literally the exact same role as in GWTW, just renamed. The film itself isn't bad at all with Gregory Peck giving a REALLY nasty performance as the villain of the movie & the story itself is okay with the fact that there's a love triangle to the point it drives one to murder was gutsy as well. The hard part was that Selznick's hunger to recreate the success he had with GWTW is evident throughout this film, even giving it a Roadshow presentation. Duel in the Sun, which runs 144 minutes with Overture & Exit Music, was so controversial because it tested the censors at every turn & the fact that Selznick was having an affair with his leading lady during production. Again, the movie itself is perfect but I thought it was merely an attempt to recreate the success of Gone with the Wind.",1392595200,,1302,4.384297520661157

368942,3,6301805615,"As a rabid fan of western movies, this is one movie I had never viewed, and seeing that it always made the list of the top 25 westerns, I purchased it and saw for myself why this is widely considered a western classic.  Produced by David O. Selznick, the same producer of ""Gone With the Wind"" fame, ""Duel"" (1946) tried to become the western equivalent of 1939's ""Gone With the Wind"".  While it cannot match ""Gone"" in any head to head comparison, it really makes an honest effort.  The striking color cinematography, the immensity of the west, the dramatic musical score by Dimitri Tiomkin, and the casting of legends Peck, Cotton, Jones, Barrymore, and Gish, all show how the elements for a film epic are present in this film.

The film has at its center, a love triangle that is bound to result in tragedy.  Pearl, (Jenifer Jones) a sultry temptress Indian half-breed, having lost her father in Mexico, is shuttled to her father's former love interest, the McCanles home in Texas, where she is fiendishly lusted over by Lewt McAnles(superbly played by Gregory Peck), and earnestly loved by Lewt's brother, Jesse (Joseph Cotten).  While Pearl prefers the true love of Jesse and her own respectibility, she is irrestitably drawn to the darker, seamier, dangerous, more passionate lust/love of Lewt.  The entire film has as its axel, this love triangle and how it turns to the bitter end.  There are some mysteries to solve along the way, such as how and why Mr. McCanles (Barrymore) ended up in a wheelchair (another act of passion, not unlide the passion of his two sons), and why the film is called ""Duel in the Sun"".  Who actually duels?  One believes that it will be the two sons as they fight to own Pearl (partially true), but the film has a major surprise awaiting in its climactic ending. (no spoiler here!)

The acting is wonderful.  Jennifer Jones is stunning in her portrayal of Pearl.  Peck, cast in the contrarian role of the lusty Lewt, is also believeable despite his ""good guy"" good looks.  While Gish and Barrymore play somewhat minor roles, they are equally up to task.  In the end, the film rests on the shoulders of Jones and Peck, whose lusty love story the film turns on -very capable shoulders to rest a film on I might add.

While this is not your typical western shoot-em-up and morality play betweeen good and evil, I believe the western movie fan will enjoy this epic film.  Perhaps it is not in my top 25 list, but it is better than average, and certainly worth your consideration.

A mature fifty years plus later I found so much in it I never saw the first time.  Especially liked the beautiful (yes, plain old great camerawork) cinematography (the opening scene in the gambling hall is beautifully done) and the cameo characters played wonderfully by such stalwarts as Herbert Marshall, Charles Bickford and Walter Huston.  If this movie had been made a few years later in big screen and with a single director like King Vidor who could control Selznick's tendency to interfere and overdo (and who salvaged Gone With The Wind for the same reason), this movie would have lost some of the excess emotion that critics labeled ""lurid"".  Pearl, a love-starved half-breed girl trying to rise above a hostile world where she's considered an inferior in every way by everyone, seems movie-wise ahead of her time.  Gregory Peck (especially) and Joseph Cotton are well cast and the two and a half hours go by pretty fast.

368977,2,6301805615,"""Duel in the Sun"" (1947) was written and produced by David Selznick and stars Jennifer Jones, Joseph Cotton, Gregory Peck, Lillian Gish, and Lionel Barrymore. It was to be Selznick's follow-up to ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939), the film he is most remembered for. Selznick was nominated for 8 other Oscars for films as diverse as ""Viva Villa"" (1934), ""David Copperfield"" (1935), ""A Tale of Two Cities"" (1936), ""A Star is Born"" (1937), ""Rebecca"" (1940) and ""Spellbound"" (1945). Beyond these, he was also involved in one capacity or another in such classics as ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1957) and ""The Third Man"" (1949) among the nearly 90 films he produced.

Selznick married Jennifer Jones in 1949, but their relationship started in 1944 on ""Since You Went Away"". ""Duel"" was their next film, and it was followed by ""Portrait of Jennie"" (1948) with Joseph Cotton, ""Indiscretion of an American Wife"" (1953) with Monty Clift, and ""A Farewell to Arms"" (1957) which was Selznick's last film.  Jones was nominated for an Oscar 5 times and won once (""Song of Bernadette"" in 1943) - a pretty good record for a woman who made only two dozen films.

In this film Jones plays a sexually charged half breed (part Native American) who has an ill fated relationship with Gregory Peck.  Peck is a film icon, ranked #12 on the AFI list of Greatest Male Actors. He won an Oscar for ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" (1962) and was nominated 4 more times (""Twelve O'clock High"", ""Gentleman's Agreement"", ""The Yearling"", ""The Keys of the Kingdom""). He was nominated for an Emmy in 1998 for the TV film ""Moby Dick"" for which he won the Golden Globe. He had two other Golden Globe nominations (""The Boys from Brazil"", ""Macarthur""). He made 57 films, starting in 1944. This was Peck's first western and he would make several more - ""Yellow Sky"" (1948), ""The Bravados"" (1958), ""The Big Country"" (1958), ""How the West Was Won"" (1962), Mackenna's Gold"" (1969), ""Shoot Out"" (1971) and ""Old Gringo"" (1989). Jones and Peck worked together again in ""The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit"" (1956)

Joseph Cotton  plays Peck's good brother. Cotton was a close friend of Orson Welles and appeared in ""Citizen Kane"" (1941), ""Journey into Fear"" (1943), ""The Third Man"" (1949) and ""Touch of Evil (1958). He went on to star in such memorable films as ""Gaslight"" (1944) and ""Portrait of Jennie"" (1948), for which he won the Best Actor award at the Venice Film festival.  He worked with Jennifer Jones and Selznick on this film.

Lillian Gish was probably the biggest female star of the silent era, appearing in ""The Musketeers of Pig Alley"" (1912), ""Birth of a Nation"" (1915), and ""Intolerance"" (1916). Her talkies include several memorable roles, including Mother Mary in ""Portrait of Jennie"" (1948) and Rachel in ""The Night of the Hunter"" (1955). Her TV films include ""Trip to Bountiful"" (1953) and ""Whales of August"" (1987). For her role as the matriarch in this film she was nominated for an Oscar but lost to Anne Baxter in ""The Razor's Edge.""

The great Lionel Barrymore appeared in more than 200 films between 1908 and 1956, and was twice nominated for an Oscar, winning once (""A Free Soul"" ) in 1931 Though he's probably best known as the evil banker in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946) and from his recurring roles in the Dr. Kildare and the Dr. Gillepsie films, he gave us many memorable performances -  as the innkeeper in ""Key Largo"" (1948), Thaddeus Stevens in ""Tennessee Johnson"" (1942), Grandpa in ""You Can't Take it With You"" (1938), and Billy Bones in ""Treasure Island"" (1934). Barrymore plays Peck's father.

Other members of the cast include Butterfly McQueen,  Sidney Blackmer, Harry Carey, Charles Bickford, and Walter Huston.

Butterfly McQueen is best remembered as the quarrelsome Prissy from ""GWTW"" (1939) and this typecast her as a maid in several films (e.g., ""Flame of the Barberry Coast"", ""Mildred Pierce""). She was upset with the typecasting and retired in 1947, then transitioned to TV and appeared on ""Beulah"" (1950-2) with fellow GWTW alumni Hattie McDaniel where she played a maid.

Suave Sidney Blackmer appeared in nearly 200 films between 1914 and 1971, He's best remembered for his role as a satanic worshiper in ""Rosemary's Baby"" (1968). Blackmer was not only busy in front of the camera, he had a distinguished Broadway career and won a Tony in 1950 for ""Come Back Little Sheba"". He had the distinction of playing Teddy Roosevelt more times than any other actor (8). Blackmer plays Jones' mother's lover, who is killed by Jones' father (played by Herbert Marshall) when he catches the two together. It's a small part and in some versions of the film he doesn't appear at all.

Harry Carey Sr. was one of the first western stars of the silent film era, and we have him to thank for getting John Ford his first few jobs. Over a 40 year career he appeared in more than 200 films and was nominated once for ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"" (1939). ""Duel"" was one of his last films, - he died in 1948. But he lived long enough to launch the career of his son Harry Carey Jr. in ""Red River"" (1948). Carey plays a friend of Barrymore.

Crusty Charles Bickford appeared in nearly 100 films. He was nominated for an Oscar three times (""Song of Bernadette"" in 1943, ""The Farmer's Daughter"" in 1947, and ""Johnny Belinda"" in 1949), and each time, the actress who played opposite him won the Oscar for Best Actress - Jennifer Jones, Loretta Young, and Jane Wyman. Bickford plays a neighbor and the man Jones runs to on the re-bound.

At one point in his career, Walter Huston was churning out 4 to 8 films a year.  His performances are relatively undistinguished, even if some of the films (e.g., ""Gabriel Over the White House"") were hits. Huston got better as he got older, and he was nominated for an Oscar in 1937 (""Dodsworth""), 1942 (""Devil and Daniel Webster"") and 1943 (""Yankee Doodle Dandy"") and won in 1949 for ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"". Huston plays a preacher.

The film is directed by King Vidor (with William Dieterle completing the film after Vidor walked out).  Vidor was nominated for an Oscar in 1928 (""The Crowd""), 1929 (""Hallelujah""), 1931 (""The Champ""), 1938 (""Citadel"") and 1956 (""War and Peace""). He never won. He is listed in the Guinness Book as having the longest career as a film director (67 years).  Vidor and Jones worked together again in ""Ruby Gentry"" (1952).

Sexuality in films in the 40s was generally limited to film noir (e.g., ""Double Indemnity"", ""Laura"", ""Gilda""), but nothing equated with ""Lust in the Dust"" which is what this film became known as. Usually, sexuality was associated with death (e.g., ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", ""Laura"", ""Double Indemnity""). The Catholic League of Decency condemned the film, even though the ending was re-written to prove that lust doesn't pay. The Protestants condemned the film because the preacher (Huston) was made to look ridiculous.

For reasons of his own, Selznick hoped to have another ""GWTW."" In his new version, Tara was replaced by Spanish Bit and Scarlett by Pearl. He even brought in Butterfly McQueen who had been Scarlett's maid.  He tried to match Gable with Peck and he threw in the Union army to boot. But to no avail. ""Duel"" was a pale comparison to ""GWTW."" Jones and Peck overact, but worse than this, they fail to establish any real sympathy for their characters. People are either weak and good (Gish, Cotton) or strong and bad (Peck, Barrymore). It's cardboard cutout time on the range, and the result is not compelling.

The film was nominated for two Oscars (Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress) but didn't win. Selznick spent more than $2 million to promote the film, and the total costs for the film were $8 million-  it took many years for the film to make back its costs.",1273881600,,7751,4.7959489872468115

It is high camp, true, but I also find it truly artistic in every respect.  The production values are superb.

Rightfully assessed as a failed attempt to reproduce the oomph of ""Gone With The Wind"".

368996,5,6301805615,"""Duel in the sun"" is the ""Gone with the wind"" of the Western genre. The movie begins with a warning, a cactus flower that epitomizes and warns us about the tragic love of Perla Chavez , a free and gentle flower who grew wild, a half bred girl who was born signed by the disgrace. She is witness of her mother' s death by the hands of her own father, who sends her to his second cousin Laura Belle, happily married with a wealthy Senator and mother of two sons; Jesse, the good guy and prominent lawyer (Joseph Cotten) and Lewton , the bad seed of the family (Gregory Peck). Both of them will be engaged by this sensual woman at the same moment she arrives to the ""Little Spain"" ranch.

The plot suggests us much more that it shows, the febrile passion she feels for one is compensated by the candid love she feels for the other one, but she knows about her origin and nothing in this world will be capable to redeem her.

King Vidor was the director of this mature sex western that still stands out as one the most superb westerns ever made. As a matter of fact it has everything you demands about a western, legal clashes between the arrival of the railroad in these lands, a sublime photography, unforgettable scenes supported by the depth of field that remits us to John Ford's style but with a particular taste, fabulous performances of all the cast, not only the presence of Lyonel Barrymore justifies plainly your inversion, but the smart idea to hire the veteran Walter Huston in the role of preacher after his unforgettable role in ""The devil and Daniel Webster"" was emblematic and even mordacious

To my view, one of the twenty westerns in all time.",1203206400,6,1658,4.465346534653466
368997,4,6301805615,"King Vidor was a long-serving and much-respected Hollywood grandmaster who took a serious interest in movie-making... ""Billy the Kid"" and ""Duel in the Sun"" hold an important place in the history of the genre... These two films in particular, along with ""Northwest Passage,"" show Vidor's romantic vision of backwoods America and his love of natural landscape; they share, too, an earthy quality which is missing from his more routine action Westerns, ""The Texas Rangers"" and ""Man Without a Star.""

Photographed in rich color, the visual magnificence of the film was manifested in the shots of the cowboys galloping across the rolling hills; in the spectacular confrontation between the McCanles forces who aimed to defend Spanish Bit with lead and the U.S. Cavalry; in the deep red sunset sequence with Lionel Barymore as ""the lonely Senator""; and in that long shot of the surreptitious meeting between Lewt and his father on the hilltop at sunset...

""Duel in the Sun"" is extravagantly and grandiosely passionate and romantic and its characters are much larger than life... A poignant scene was the tremendous moment between two legendary actors (Lionel Barrymore & Lillian Gish) when Laura Belle said to her husband ""I'm a nuisance to you even to the end. It's the first time you've been in this room since that night./I loved you, Laura Belle. Yes, sir, I loved you.""

Now, when a single movie offers murder, rape, attempted fratricide, train wreck, fiery sensual dance, drunkenness, religion, range wars, prostitution, sacred and profane love and sex as the principal motivation and not as an incidental subplot, and all that against an epic background of empire-building, well, it is for the first time in a Western in such a big scale...

The film featured the story of Pearl Chavez whose past is dark as her coca-stained skin and who loves everybody but loves bad Lewt most often...

Gregory Peck character as Lewt is barbaric, undisciplined, untamed, overwhelming... He is a bad man, all bad, but he is also the lowest, dirtiest, meanest and cool, and he knows how to laugh and have a good time...

Jennifer Jones as Pearl, is the 'prettiest girl ever to set foot on Spanish Bit.' She is a marvelous overwrought minx, wild and sexy...

Joseph Cotton is the calm, educated, refined, pleasant son Jesse who ultimately sides with the railroad against his father...He even threatens to cut the fence wire promising: ""I'd rather be on the side of the victims than of the murderers.""

Lionel Barrymore is the invalid Senator Jackson McCanles who orders his son, calling him a ""Judas,"" to leave his ranch for as long as he lives...

Lillian Gish is the delicate Laura Belle who blames her husband of spoiling Lewt and she let him do so ever since he was a child making him think that rules weren't made for him...

Herbert Marshall plays Scott Chavez the condemned Southern aristocrat gentleman who sends his daughter to Laura Belle, his second cousin...

Charles Bickford plays Sam Pierce, the boss who gets a little ranch of his own but never run across anybody he wanted to marry... Besides, he never got up nerve enough to ask anybody...

Impassions, pulsating, barbaric, and thunderous, the music matches perfectly the fervid emotionalism of the story...

368999,4,6301805615,"DUEL IN THE SUN, otherwise known as ""Lust in the Dust"" to it's devotees and detractors, remains a guilty pleasure.  Full of grand artifice and excess, not to mention Jennifer Jones in a role light-years away from her usual screen assignments, it remains an enjoyable diversion.

Half-caste beauty Pearl Chavez (Jennifer Jones in heavy tropical makeup) is orphaned and goes to live with distant cousins in Texas.  Pretty soon she's caught in the middle of a love-duel between brothers Lewt (Gregory Peck) and Jesse (Joseph Cotten), who both want to have her.

The casting of Gregory Peck as the carnal, savagely-sexual Lewt was a masterstroke.  Playing against his usual screen persona, Peck instantly commands the screen with his impressive performance.  By contrast, Joseph Cotten positively pales as his weak-willed brother Jesse.  Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore play the parents and manage to climb beyond caricature territory; however Gish's death scene is totally ridiculous.  Butterfly McQueen plays the feather-brained domestic (but she might as well be reprising her ""Gone with the Wind"" role of Prissy).

Comparisons to ""Gone with the Wind"" have dogged DUEL IN THE SUN since it's original release.  It was no secret that producer David O. Selznick wanted to fashion a movie that would emulate some of the visual splendor of GWTW (not to mention the same box-office success).  From the rich-red sunsets to the sprawling running time, DUEL IN THE SUN follows the formula, but the overall standard of acting is too forced and florid to truly connect with audiences in the special way that GWTW did.

DUEL IN THE SUN does have the spectacular Jennifer Jones and Gregory Peck in it's favour; when these two stars take to the screen you can't help but be riveted.  The DVD includes the full theatrical Prelude and Overture musical sequences.",1186790400,2,1847,5.096345514950166
369000,4,6301805615,"Everything about 'Duel in the Sun' is overripe: the music, the photography (those red sunsets a la GWTW), the strong emotions and the climactic duel on a blazing desert sun by the two mismatched lovers. Indeed, the excesses are almost operatic in proportion--and yet, a viewer can get caught up in this sprawling western rightly termed ""Lust in the Dust"" by some reviewers.

The rampant sensuality of the steamy scenes between Peck and Jones are emphasized by Dimitri Tiomkin's luscious background score which becomes blistering and intense for the climactic shootout. Overproduced, overacted, overwritten--it still entertains and makes us appreciate the genius of David O. Selznick whose hand on all of the material is quite evident.

Jennifer Jones was nominated for her tempestuous Pearl Chavez (but lost to Olivia de Havilland for 'To Each His Own'). Lillian Gish deserved her Oscar nomination. And last but not least, let's not forget Walter Huston, who gives the most realistic and enjoyable performance in the entire film as The Sin Killer--a wickedly funny portrayal.

Weakest aspect of the film is Gregory Peck's easygoing villain--his whole performance strikes a false note and is not the least bit convincing. He and Joseph Cotten should have switched their roles--Cotten always made a more believable villain than Peck (as in ""Shadow of a Doubt"").

Selznick obviously was striving to make a western on the level of GWTW--even including Butterfly McQueen for comic relief. All in all, fun to watch if you don't take any of it seriously. Not exactly a work of art--but definitely worth watching. And, oh, that ripe technicolor, topped by Orson Welles' pretentious and deeply baritone narration and Dimitri Tiomkin's pounding score.

The only bland role in the whole film is played with dignity and warmth by Charles Bickford, so low-key that he appears to be acting in another film altogether. He's quite a contrast to all the high tension excesses of Jones and company.",1186272000,3,1980,5.155763239875389

Someone said it was an opera and that's what it is, all right.  They could be singing the lines with broad sweeping gestures and too much flesh and makeup.

However on all other fronts the film is magnificent and it is definitely one of the strangest pictures of the entire postwar period.  The colors are rich, troubled, seething with pixels, and the musical score shouts and clamors what we all knew at heart, the west is another word for s-e-x.  Selznick cleverly cast a number of silent film veterans in the cast, to trace the long history of melodrama in the movies, most notably Lillian Gish but also Lionel Barrymore, Harry Carey Sr and the incomparable Herbert Marshall, who plays Pearl's gambler father ""Scott"" during the first reel or two.

The younger generation, as represented by Cotten, Jones, and Peck, all visibly strain trying to be colorful, and in the case of Jones and Peck, they are rewarded with twin triumphs of overacting and sheer ham.  Selznick must have sat Jennifer Jones down and force-fed her the complete filmic works of her predecessor, Maria Montez, to get her to be so over the top.  As for Peck, the whole audience explodes with gasps and laughter when we hear him whistling, mournfully, ""I've Been Working on the Railroad"" after we see him blowing up an entire train just for the hell of it.  In contrast, Cotten's a little flimsy and distracted in his part--he doesn't hold up his end of the triangle very well.  Maybe Robert Walker would have been better, or Montgomery Clift, one of many to whom Selznick offered the part.

When I first saw DUEL IN THE SUN I was about fifteen and it blew me away.  Contemporary films rarely feature the kind of soak-through Technicolor that Rosson and Garmes (and I guess von Sternberg, who worked on the film for many months) were able to produce here.  The dancing (by Albertina ""Tilly"" Losch, the European answer to Martha Graham) is out of this world, and the oracular voice of Orson Welles blows the whole narrative into another dimension the minute his narration begins.",1109894400,15,2100,4.694822888283379

369043,5,6301805615,"Sweeping! Magnificent! Corny! Romantic! A west that never existed is splashed across the screen as only David O. Selznick, the master of such gargantuan Hollywood classics as ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Since You Went Away"" and ""Rebecca"" could give us.
This is not the revisionists west of the 1990's, nor that West of the gritty operatic glamour of Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In The West."" You will not find the spare clean and lean beauty of John ford's West. What we have here is the epic telling on a screen that screams to be stretched into widescreen and spills out over the audience the lush and romantic horse Opera of Pearl Chavez, the McCanles clan and the coming of the railroads in the 1880's.

From the moment the overture replete with unneeded narration begins you know you are in for a melodrama of purple emotions and blood red vendettas. The opening scene is set in a saloon on a scale of a modern Vegas casino. There amidst the wild gunfire of overheated cowboys and insanely spinning faro wheels we are introduced to the Scarlett O'Hara of the West, half-breed Pearl Chavez. As played by Jennifer Jones she is just about the hottest tamale to ever hit the pages of a screenplay expressly written to drive men mad, turn brother against brother and defy a ""Sinkiller"". What Jane Russell was supposed to be in ""The Outlaw"" we get in Technicolor spades in the form of Miss Jones.

She takes huge hefty bites of the massive sets and chews them to a fare thee well and in the process creates a wanton character of such charm, heat and passion that she is truly a motion picture original. This is the best thing Miss Jones ever did because it is so out of control and beyond the pale of her more subdued performances. Of saints, teenage war brides and ghosts of lost love.

As Lewt McCanles we get the hottest, meanest, most excitingly nasty performance Gregory Peck ever was allowed to give. And what an irresistible bad boy he is. He was never sexier or more wonderful than in this departure from the Peck norm.
Even the usually dull Joseph Cotton manages to rise above his typically dry rolls, but not too much, in the thankless roll of the good brother. He seems a little too old for the part and a little too polished. Someone like Charlton Heston might have been more on the spot.

Lillian Gish steals every scene she is in with quite assured screen presence and only finds completion from the ever-prissy Butterfly McQueen. In her final scene with Lionel Barrymore Miss Gish makes off with the scene so quietly that you are hit with it's impact only after the fact. Barrymore creates one of his most beloved curmudgeons as Senator Jackson McCanles full of sound and furry and ultimately signifying less than nothing. His introduction to Pearl topped by a sneeringly shocking racial slur that encapsulates his character and time and place.

Another highlight is the cameo by Walter Huston as ""The Sinkiller"". What can be said of him is only this, pure cinematic magic.
The film unfold with such a sense of grandeur and awe that it sweeps you along to its incredible ending on the wings of epic pure camp poetry. The Dimitri Tiomkin score is a masterpiece and much famed over the years for the incredible ""call of the bells"" set piece.

The three cinematographers involved, Hal Rosson, Ray Rennahan, and Lee Garmes paint movie memory after memory with the palate of hot dusty hues that have long been forgotten by audiences of today. To see it now is perhaps more exciting and thrilling than it was in 1947.

All of this mad mixture of melodrama, mush and music was orchestrated by the master showman of his time, the ultimate huckster of smoke and mirrors and consummate barometer for just what we wanted in our early epics of the America that never existed, David O. Selznick, who added the ""O"" to his name just because it looked better on the marquee. When they say that off heard lament ""They don't make'um like they used to."" Both Mr. Selznick and ""Duel In The Sun"" are what they are talking about. If they still made them like this then something would be terribly wrong. Thank god they did make films like this once upon a time and we still have them to lose ourselves in a dream of what never was and what will never be again.

369045,2,6301805615,"Producer David O. Selznick never thought small. Dreaming of a magnum opus on the same grand scale as ""Gone with the Wind"" and, perhaps a little bit self-conscious of the fact that his recent affair with Jennifer Jones had yielded only one stellar performance from the starlet - and not even in a film he had produced - Selznick's driving ambition to make Jones a star on par with the likes of Vivien Leigh, led him to handcraft ""Duel in the Sun."" This was to be an extravagant Technicolor epic about a doomed mulatto, Pearl Chavez (Jones) and her rabid lust for, Lewton McCanles (Gregory Peck, in the uncharacteristic part as the villain), the ruthless son and roguish playboy of retired senator and bigoted rancher, Jackson McCanles (Lionel Barrymore). After Pearl?s father, Scott (Herbert Marshall) murders her mother, Pearl is sent to live with Jackson and his wife, Laura Bell (Lillian Gish) on their sprawling ranch, Spanish Bit. Pearl is determined to live purely and plainly, but her incendiary disposition leads into the arms of Lewton. Jesse McCanles (Joseph Cotten), the good son, is forced to leave Spanish Bit, returning years later to find that his brother has become a ruthless tyrant and outlaw. Buttressed by a fiery backdrop about the colliding sensibilities of old West morality and the true Northern ambitions to tame it, ?Duel In The Sun? ultimately became an overblown melodrama that seemed almost a garish lampoon of ""Gone With The Wind"" rather than its successor. It did respectable box office at the time but very little to advance Jennifer Jones? career into the echelons of super stardom. Prior to its release a sensual dance sequence that Pearl performs around a tree stump for Lewton was deleted because the censorship of the period found its sexual implications?well, shocking. Selznick?s usual attention to craftsmanship and story design also seem to be absent from this occasion. He repositions Butterfly McQueen (Prissy from ?Gone With The Wind) as the Prissy-esque house maid, Vashti, who is even dumber than Prissy and, Selznick muddles the supporting cast with oddities of all sorts, including Walter Huston as a religious zealot, determined to rid Pearl of her sexual demons, and Charles Bickford, as an over-the-hill farmer who offers Pearl his hand in a loveless marriage.  Because of its sexually charged subject matter (there is, after all, a rape, a murder and the prospect of lovers committing suicide in the mountains) ?Duel In The Sun? acquired the rather unflattering moniker of ?Lust In The Dust.?
?Duel In The Sun? had previously been made available from Anchor Bay in a stunning road show edition. MGM's reissue is the truncated theatrical version ? also made previously available through Anchor Bay. On all three DVD incarnations, colors are well balanced, though on this new version they seem a tad more dated from the rich and vibrant colors on the Anchor Bay version. Black levels are good but fine detail is lost in many darkly lit scenes. There's also more noticeable film grain on this version than the Anchor Bay edition. The audio is remixed to stereo but only marginally appealing, sounding rather forced and re-channeled. There are NO extras.
There's nothing to stand up and cheer about here. If you are a die hard fan of this film, or westerns, then you will definitely want to look up the out of print copy from Anchor Bay, rather than this reissue. Aside from being longer, the Anchor Bay version also tends to be a better visual presentation overall.",1085443200,14,3513,4.964346349745331

Jennifer Jones is the panting half-breed girl torn between two brothers, the very good Joseph Cotten and the very bad Gregory Peck.  Their mother, the saintly Lillian Gish looks on with concern, while their father, the not-so saintly Lionel Barrymore opposes the girl and pretty much everything in general. What ensues is over two hours of lust, bickering, bellowing, and more lust.
Jones swings her hips and shoulders to convey her characters urges, but does little else with what little character she has been given to develop.  Peck is fun as the brother lacking pretty much any morals, while Cotten is one note and boring.  Gish looks stunned throughout most of the film, but manages a couple of effective moments (and lets ignore her straight-from-the-silents deathbed scene!!).  Barrymore blusters and blusters in a role tailor made for his hamminess.  Others in the cast, including Charles Bickford, Walter Huston, Herbert Marshall, and Butterfly McQueen deliver what you would expect of them.
The script is full of laughable lines and characters, and there's more than a few moments when you'll be holding your head wondering what they were thinking!?!?  The music score is dramatic, although sometimes overpowering, and the colour cinematography is outstanding.

369096,3,6301805615,"This 1946 western boasts spectacular, technicolor cinematography and a script that is sometimes laughable. Directed by Hollywood notable, King Vidor, one wonders whether he was under pressure by the producer, David O. Selznick, and was more of a puppet rather than a director. That can be the only explanation for this directorial faux pas. It is so over the top in its excesses that in the first five minutes one sees some wild, almost hysterical dancing, the cuckolding of a husband, and two murders arising out of that nasty domestic situation.
The storyline is simple. A Spanish Grandee, Scott Chavez (Herbert Marshall), married the wrong woman, a wild and passionate Indian, instead of his true love, Laura Belle. Together they have a child whom they named Pearl. Known as a half breed, Pearl Chavez (Jennifer Jones), wants to be a lady, a ""good girl"". Given who her mother was, however, no one wants to give her a chance to prove herself. When her father knows he is to die, he packs her off to his first love, Laura Belle (Lillian Gish), who lives in Texas and is married to Senator McCanles (Lionel Barrymore). They have two sons, Jesse (Joseph Cotten) and Lewt (Gregory Peck). Jesse is the good son and his mother's favorite, while Lewt is a spoiled rake and his father's favorite.
When Pearl arrives at the McCanles ranch, Lillian greets her warmly, as does Jesse. Senator McCanles, her overbearing husband, however, treats Pearl to some racist, politically incorrect invective, while Lewt eyes her lasciviously. Needless to say, a love triangle of sorts develops. Ultimately, both sons want her, but they both can't have her. Jesse treats Pearl like a lady, while Lewt treats her like a wanton. When a breach with his father arises, Jesse leaves the ranch, leaving Pearl to the mercy of Lewt who will stop at nothing, not even murder, to ensure his claim over Pearl. In the end, Lewt appears to be the one to get Pearl, but what he gets may be more than that for which bargained. Moreover, Pearl may also be prone to self-sacrifice.
Herbert Marshall, as the Spanish Grandee with regrets, gives an effective performance, although he is somewhat miscast. Lillian Gish gives an excellent portrayal of the put upon Laura Belle, though her death scene is so melodramatic that it is hard to keep a straight face. Lionel Barrymore is also excellent, though a little over the top in his performance. I have to say, I loved Gregory Peck as the bad guy. He gives a truly terrific performance. The viewer gets a sense that Peck really seemed to be enjoying himself. Joseph Cotten oozes integrity in the role of the saintly Jesse. Butterfly McQueen, as Vashti the maid, is, well, Butterfly McQueen, with her distinctive, high pitched voice, holding sway over the viewer. Charles Bickford, as the ranch straw boss, Sam Pierce, gives a restrained and moving performance as the man who truly loves and wants to marry Pearl, a desire that Lewt will do everything to thwart.
Jennifer Jones, quite frankly, is utterly laughable as Pearl. If she had not been the producer's main squeeze at the time, I doubt that she would ever have been cast for the part of Pearl. So over the top is her performance, so filled with pouty grimaces, histrionics, and sultry poses, that her portrayal of Pearl rises to the level of high camp. The scene where she grabs Lewt's leg in a histrionic fit, declaring her undying love as he walks away, dragging her across the floor, is a bit much. I suspect that the director's handling of Ms. Jones' portrayal of Pearl was the director's way of getting back at the producer. If so, the director succeeded in giving it to the producer in spades.
Notwithstanding this, the film is still a moderately enjoyable western. For those who object to its political incorrectness, remember to keep in mind the social context out of which it arose. The times, they are a changing.",1048377600,13,3887,4.777117384843982

But a total kick in the unintentional ... when it comes to seeing a movie self distruct before your eyes. The movie Cecil B. De Mille probably watched just before filming the 10 Commandments....(Oh Moses, Moses, Moses!)
Lionel Barrymore's cantakerous attitude....
Gregory Peck chuffing up his crop to be as freakin nasty as he can be....NOT!
Jennifer Jones......how many words can summon the idea of MISCAST! Actually its not her fault. A benzedrine addled Selznick was convinced he could carry her as a Mexican Scarlet O'Hara. Can you see the puppet strings? Hello....Eliza Dolittle!
Lillian Gish who is the ONLY remotely sympathetic character. Her death scene will ellicit chuckles if not guffaws! HELLO....MR VIDOR what where you thinking???!!!!
Like I said...bad, bad, bad, but a guilty pleasure none the less.
Watch it with a good eye for Selznick's ironfisted promotion of JJ....also remembering that this production team brought you Gone With The Wind. One of my all time favorite movies.
Can you say MAJOR STUMBLE!",1043798400,3,1059,5.1988304093567255
369098,2,6301805615,"No! This is one of the worst MOVIES ever made! Of course, political correctness did not exist in 1946, but some responsible person should have been considerate to the feelings of Hispanics, cowboys, Native Americans, women, and old people.  All are horribly stereotyped in this obvious big-budgeted epic.
Jennifer Jones is good on the eye but her believability as a half-breed is too much to take.  Thankfully, Joseph Cotten had earlier scored with Orson Welles in ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" and ""Citizen Kane,"" as well as with Hitchcock in ""Shadow of a Doubt."" He would have a long character-acting career, even with this turkey under his belt.
The same for co-star Gregory Peck.  Acting in ""Duel"" has to be an embarrassment for the Oscar winner. ""Atticus Finch"" couldn't even defend his performance.
Lionel Barrymore is AWFUL as the family's overbearing and racist patriarch!  Only Lillian Gish as his long-suffering wife succeeds despite such ear-shattering dialogue.
One can't believe that the man responsible for bringing ""Gone with the Wind"" to the screen produced this!",1024099200,2,1077,5.244186046511628
369099,4,6301805615,"""Duel in the Sun"" was David Selznick's attempt to outdo ""Gone With the Wind"". Sure, it has lavish and sweeping production, glorious cinematography. But nothing can outdo ""Gone With the Wind"". But it was still a valiant attempt.
The film revolves around Pearl Chavez, a half white/half Amerind girl whose became an orphan when her father was hanged for murder. She was sent to the family of her father's ex-fiancee (Lillian Gish). Unfortunately, the patriach of the family harbors racist attitude toward Pearl (""PEARL??? Why aren't you called POCAHONTAS?!!""). The two son, blond Jesse (Joseph Cotten)the saint and dark haired Lewt (Gregory Peck) the devil both fell for Pearl, and this love triangle eventually leads to the climatic event suggested by the film's title.
As usual, the ever reliable Jennifer Jones demonstrate her talents that other Hollywood actresses can only hope they had. If you are used to seeing Ms. Jones in goody two shoes virginal roles in films such as Song of Bernadette, Since You Went Away, Love Is A Many Splendored Thing, Portrait of Jennie, and even The Towering Inferno, Duel In the Sun shows that she can exude sex as well. Typical of Jennifer's performances, she don't just act with her face, she acted with her entire body as well. She BECOMES the character.
Gregory Peck is also excellent, being a rotten rakish rogue for once rather than the defender of right and virtue we use to get from him in films such as A Gentleman's Agreement and The Paradine Case.
Highly sexually charge in its day, Duel In the Sun was jeered by critics as ""lust in the dust"". But given how this film has gone on to be a classic, both Peck and Jones can jeer back. Their performances, and the film itself is still remembered and celebrated.
And where are the critics now?

369100,2,6301805615,"Duel in the Sun is an epic production. It is beautifully filmed -- with great music, expert stunt work, well-trained horses and a superb cast of superstars. ... end of story. It doesn't hold up as well most other films from the 1940s (or the 50's, 60's, 70' ,80's and rest of the century for that mattter), and the script (sic) which is corny, campy, unbelievable and painful to watch is an insult to discerning film-goers now, just as it must have been 60 years ago. King Vidor ( the name fits, and he wears it well) has teamed up with David O. Selsnick to foist this multi-million dollar spectacle on overzealous groupies of the film-classic genre who, (as you can read from the surrounding reviews) just adore it!  It has three things which will please film lovers: 1. Jennifer Jones 2.great scenery (redundant) and 3.the best stunt horses this side of - - wait -- I already said that.
Despite a tremendous effort on the part of Gregory Peck, Jones, Lilian Gish and the rest of the talented cast to make this  horrendous script come to some sort of life-form, the movie ultimately sinks to a level of  jabberwocky so low that it makes the script of  Paul Verhoeven/Elizabeth Berkley's ""Showgirls"" seem like ""A Place in the Sun"" by comparison.
  This is two and a half hours of my life I can never get back.

Today I find again  and again that I and many others it are hypnotized by it, find it fascinating, its outsized emotions, feelings, visual splendor, epic-geared acting all fascinate audiences. This is King Vidor in what is called his ""delirious period"" and Selznick as having his ambitions as well as his talent in  full control, before he started down. Glorious ""big"" performances by the  Jennifer Jones asnd Gregory Peck and world class supporting cast. Great music by Dmitri Tiomkin. A major treat!",1003104000,5,619,4.990291262135922
369102,5,6301805615,"This first-time-ever release of the original Roadshow Version of DUEL IN THE SUN is definitive both as to length and features as well as to its sparkling new look. The Overture and Exit music, by the great Dimitri Tiomkin, prepares the viewer for this overblown, extravagant, and overlength Western. The narration during the Overture places the film in its historical context, and foreshadows the filmmakers' concerns with the Production Code Administration of the day. This film wasn't known as ""Lust in the Dust"" for nothing.
That this film is overdone in almost every respect shouldn't for one minute discourage the purchase of DUEL. Its tremendous cast--including a surprisingly atypical performance by the great Walter Huston as the ""sin killer"" preacher--is well worth seeing. While the film is overlong, the costly restoration work that has gone into this edition makes it a visual treat that, for the first time, accurately reveals the high standard of craftsmanship insisted on by its producer David O. Selznick. The colors are so sharp and true that they seem to jump out from the screen. If you are a fan of this film--as something of a ""guilty pleasure""--you'll throw away the previous video release of this film with gusto. There is absolutely no comparison whatsoever. The 5-star rating is primarily for how gorgeous it looks than for the story itself. This is what great Technicolor could do during Hollywood's Golden Age. The trailers, also included in this edition, make this a great package.",976838400,46,1509,5.113360323886639
369103,3,6301805615,"Duel in the Sun is an epic in both it's themes and production.  Although it doesn't hold up nearly as well as other films from the 1940s, it has  many things which will please film lovers.  When Jennifer Jones, a  half-breed Indian Girl named Pearl Chavez, goes to live with her dead  father's ex-fiancee and her family, a love triangle develops between Lewt  and Jesse McCanles, Gregorgy Peck and Joseph Cotton respectively.  Peck is  the low down spoiled son of Senator (Lionel Barrymore) and Laura Belle  (Lillian Gish) McCanles, whose interest in Jones is purely physical.  Cotton's character on the other hand has a genuine affection for Pearl and  tries to protect her from his raffish younger brother.  The inevitable  showdown between brothers ensues, with Peck appearing the winner for  Pearl's affections.  Filled with enough sweep and grandeur for twenty  films, Duel has some of the most interesting color cinematography ever put  on celluloid.  The scenes during the building of the railroad and the  confrontation that follows are most impressive.  Everyone in the cast seems  to believe the storyline, which makes for a fun ride in spite of the  downright hokiness of the plot.  David O. Selznick spent six million  dollars on a film that was supposed to be another Gone With the Wind and it  shows.  Released in 1947, Duel became one of the biggest grossing westerns  of all time.  It's also a testament to how popular stars can turn a  mediocre story into a full blown blockbuster.  With all its faults, this is  a highly entertaining movie.",966211200,32,1558,4.899613899613899
