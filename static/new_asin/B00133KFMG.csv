8248938,4,B00133KFMG,"Death metal, doom metal, other sub-genres of metal... this is a nice compilation!  I found out about some new bands from this disc.  I also found out that there are music videos to some songs I already knew about.  My personal favorite on this disc is the track from Sleep, but there's a lot else going on.

Sadly, there are no special features, but it's still worth the price of admission.",1397606400,,390,4.450704225352113
