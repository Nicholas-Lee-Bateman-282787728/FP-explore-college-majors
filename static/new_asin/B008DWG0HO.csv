8527068,5,B008DWG0HO,"Desdemona was Tebaldi's role of choice, one which she often chose when she debuted at a new house.  Here in Germany, she is slender and looks beautiful.  The poor tenor seems terrified standing next to Tebaldi and she, I could swear, embraces him in support.  A magnanimous lady.  She sang this opera for her last performance at the Met and it was touching.",1508112000,,357,4.619047619047619
8527069,3,B008DWG0HO,"This performance was well sung but the acting was lacking with some exception.  Jessica Nuccio makes a wonderful Desdemona and sings a lovely willow song and prayer in act 4.

I have a beef with the staging.  For some reason the director chose to have several men dressed up in leather with punk hair floating around the stage distracting from the performance.  I understand that these blokes, not part of Verdi's work, represent evil, anger etc.  But they are just out of place and distract from the action and singers.  They are intrusive and just in the way.

They also reveal a subtle phenomenon common to modern thought.  They mime some of the action effectively deflecting some of the guilt/responsibility off Otello and Iago.  This is a crying shame but unfortunately part of the misguided modern psychology that also says ""the devil made me do it"" - the devil can be your genes, upbringing or socioeconomic circumstances.  One of these devils actually initiates the death of Desdemona which Otello completes.

Uggg.  The idea here is that Iago with a kerchief is able to let loose the devil inside Otello!  He is responsible for his own actions and evil.  So is Iago.  This nonsense, I believe, actually impeded the principals from acting their roles.  What we are left with is an emasculated Iago and Otello and a psychology that removes all the tension and drama, all the humanity from the characters effectively destroying the power of the opera.

Only Verdi's music saves this one.  Better to put it in and just listen with eyes closed.  Otherwise the production had promise of much better.  I feel sorry for the performers.",1495584000,,1636,4.816546762589928
8527070,3,B008DWG0HO,"This is mostly a good experience, but with several problems, and hard to decide how many stars to give.  I'll just spell out the main issues as I see them.  First the good news.

1.  Renata Tebaldi is wonderful.  Don't hesitate to buy if you like Tebaldi.  She is fine here, and she did so little on video.

2.  The B&W picture is excellent thruout, and the mono sound.  In fact, considering what the Metropolitan Opera was doing 15 and more years later, it is absolutely magnificent.  I was just watching the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1978-Vickers-Scotto/dp/B00579EKXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1978 Vickers/Scotto</a>&nbsp;Met video a few days ago, and I am amazed if they could tape a live production in Berlin in 1962 and make it look this good, why couldn't they do it at the Met in 1978 as well?  The Met video is so dark you can hardly see what's going on.  This is not like that.  This has a normal B&W picture as you remember from any  TV show of the era.

3.  The sets are a little on the spare side, but that's fine with me.  It is neither abstracted, modernized, or minimalist.  You get some steps, chairs, some curtains, arches, nothing that gets in the way.  It is similar to the spare sets of the the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Laurence-Olivier/dp/B000QGE8IS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Laurence Olivier</a>&nbsp;movie (but not related, of course).

4.  Most of the singers, except one that I shall get to, are competent, believable, and enjoyable.  The huge chorus also, very well trained, one of the best opera choruses I have ever heard.

With all this going for it, what could possibly be negative??  Alas ...

1.  The huge excellent chorus is singing everything in German, while the soloists are singing Italian.  I can't tell you how completely this destroys the ""suspension of disbelief"", that is, being immersed in the drama, thinking it is real, forgetting it is a fiction.  It really ruins everything, in my opinion.  It might have worked as a comedy (but I doubt it).

2.  The name of the opera is Otello, and the lead character is Otello.  It does not help that the Otello here is not very good.  Or, how shall we say, nowhere near Tebaldi's league.  He may be good local quality, but pairing him with Tebaldi is seriously out of balance, with all due respect.  He strains on the high notes, he sings the Italian phonetically, and is not much of an actor.  When I hear Vickers, or Domingo, or del Monaco or most of the others ... I can believe they really are Otello.  It doesn't gel with this gentleman.

On a happier note, Tebaldi fans are probably aware, but just in case they aren't:  there is a most excellent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tosca/dp/B00006ADF8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tosca</a>&nbsp;with Tebaldi and George London on video, from the same era, this from Stuttgart rather than Berlin, with all the same good points and none of the bad ones.  Check it out!

My favorite Otellos on video remain&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Domingo/dp/B00005BI90/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Domingo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Windgassen/dp/B003IP2YG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Windgassen</a>, and the Vickers is also far preferable, although his is dark.  (Hey, nothing like a dark Otello!)  (Avoid the Vickers movie with Karajan, that is lip-synched.)",1454371200,,3531,5.645714285714286
8527071,4,B008DWG0HO,"While it would have been even better if recorded a few years earlier, Tebaldi is charming, affecting and sings well.  The stage settings are spare but serviceable.  The rest of the cast performs well.",1378857600,,200,4.852941176470588
8527072,4,B008DWG0HO,"This Otello is badly unbalanced by Hans Beirer in the title role.  He has the volume but lacks stature musically and
in terms of his acting.  William Dooley came back to the U.S. later and sang Wagner roles with some distinction.  But here he is barely acceptable as Iago.

Renata Tebaldi appears as a guest Desdemona in this German production.  She radiates beauty and depth of voice  as Desdemona.  Her restraint and phrasing are aristocratic and she towers above the others musically.  Her Ave Maria and Willow Song stand as the last word in Verdi mystery.  Who is this beauty in the rough outpost of the Venetian Empire?  Patane had a long career as a conductor of the second rank.
But RenataTebaldi is a remarkable star, unattainable, deeply loving, the virgin who bewitched the world of opera for decades.  This performance is one of her few available on DVD.  Her simplicity and elegance are unmatched, truly historic.  She is physically very beautiful, the perfect Desdemona.  We are lucky indeed to have this document of her performance of her signature role, surrounded however by lesser artists.",1373328000,2,1106,4.908108108108108
8527073,4,B008DWG0HO,"The qualities of Tebaldi's Desdemona are quite familiar to collectors which makes it essential that we can now see as well as hear her. Hans Beirer is largely forgotten today but makes a fine, well-sung Otello. He may not have the volume of Vickers or Domingo but his performance is better than either of those. Dooley's Iago is another fine artist who left all too few recordings. He sings and acts well, without the vocal crooning or set chewing of, say, Milnes. Patane's conducting is strong and flows nicely, far preferable to von Karajan's attempt at perfection or the ""hurry-for-the-big-bits"" styles of Levine or Solti. Of course, the television technology of 1962 doesn't hold up to today's but must be overlooked to enjoy a fine performance that can't be matched today.",1351382400,5,777,4.938931297709924
8527074,4,B008DWG0HO,"This is a recording of the historic occasion in 1962 when the Deutsche Opera Berlin changed their programming to persuade Renata Tebaldi to sing in an opera for them. ""Otello"" wasn't even in their repertoire at the time, but they were desperate to present the great diva in a fully-staged opera, and this is the one she chose.

The video is clear and the sound vintage - but I have to say that the performance in general is pretty uninspiring and there are numerous places where conductor and stage part company. Hans Beirer is a reasonable Otello (he ain't no Vickers or Domingo), but his intonation is rather suspect at times. William Dooley has a fine baritone sound, but not much character, and the other soloists are distinctly average. But the whole point of this release is so that we can see as well as hear the magnificent Renata Tebaldi in one of her greatest parts. And she is truly wonderful!! OK! - so the voice wasn't at it's absolute freshest in 1962, and vocal problems (that would result in her withdrawing from the stage for a year to retrain) were on the horizon, but in this performance she sings with such beautiful tone and her stage persona is so sincere - womanly and graceful. She is also completely within the role at every stage of the proceedings.

Yes! - of course I wish this had been recorded a few years earlier when the voice was undoubtedly the most beautiful spinto voice in the world - but I'm just so glad to have this video as a memento of a great artist.",1349049600,10,1493,4.485294117647059
