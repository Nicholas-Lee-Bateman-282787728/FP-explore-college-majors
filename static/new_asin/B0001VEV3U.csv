8016596,1,B0001VEV3U,This did not work.  It is over 25 years old. I had a copy as a kid. I was much older than my sisters and this was something we could watch together and all love. I wish with all my heart that Disney would re-release this.  It is out of print. But to find one in good quality is difficult. I did find one that did work.  They only charged 29.99. To me as a collector the price was low enough for me to take a chance. and that worked I got it on ebay.  But copy sadly was a disapointment.  The storyline it's self is awesome. Any parent will realte to this and love it. and the kids who just love cartoons will love it.,1374537600,,617,3.865079365079365
8016597,3,B0001VEV3U,The reason i bought this VHS was that i saw this show on TV (with introduction by Walt Disneh himself). I really scared of the quality of this old VHS stuff. Even on my professional multi-standard vhs player. I should have known because that series of tapes are probably 25 years old. I tried to save it digitally but it was useless. I hope they find the mastertapes of that ol' tv-series and they release it as a classic dvd.,1254873600,3,426,4.3375
