How do I know it is working? When we go outside and he says Mommy look a Kelev! (Which means dog in Hebrew) I knew this was a word he did not know previously to watching Dino Lingo.

I have used the flashcards with him and guess what even mommy is learning a thing or two in Hebrew! Double blessing, I can learn along with my son.
We really have enjoyed this program, I recommend this program for any language Dino Lingo provides.",1433462400,4,669,4.21875
