4598972,5,B0058JEIGK,"Robot is pure zany and super theatrical. The car chase and the finale, despite some cheap cgi, were still marvelous and inventive. It's one of the most over-the-top movies you will ever see in your entire life. The last hour is just ballistic. And the songs weren't half-bad either!",1379030400,,282,4.775510204081633

4598974,5,B0058JEIGK,"Robot is a terrific Bollywood action film! It's got one of the craziest, out-of-control car chase sequences ever imagined. Totally over the top! And the finale is so outlandish, it defies description.",1354492800,3,200,5.28125

Until I watched this movie, I had never truly lived.

Watch, friends, and be enriched.

4598976,3,B0058JEIGK,"There are NO subtitles for the songs in the Reliance Home Video edition of Robot. This is a major disappointment for those who want to know the lyrics of the many beautiful songs in this movie. On a positive note, there is no watermark or logo in this edition, either.",1304812800,4,268,4.38
4598977,4,B0058JEIGK,"We loved this film. All we needed was open minded attitude and we rewarded with a crazy comedy action Bollywood good time. Sure there are odd choices made in this film. But that is part of the fun. The Lead will grow on you in Two different roles. And the female lead makes it fun, and is stunning to look at in every scene. The story is a Big blend of a Bollywood film, one part ""IRobot"", ""Kung Fu Hustle"", some Live action Disney film but with a hint of ""DayWatch"". There are some surprise reality moments which could jar a viewer in contrast to most of the film. But the songs, ""That will stick with you"". are fun and just and more flavor.  So you could watch this and have a really fun experience. Or some Tired Homogenized Hollywood retread.
And miss One great film.",1302998400,5,771,4.280821917808219

8461614,2,B0058JEIGK,I imagine it's a good movie but I got the Hindi version and couldn't understand what was being said,1467676800,,99,4.2631578947368425
8461615,5,B0058JEIGK,"Where do I even begin with this movie?  It's one of the most entertaining films I think I've ever seen.  The story of the movie is that a scientist (played by Rajinkanth) invents a humanoid robot called Chitti(who can do pretty much anything) and tries to teach him the ways of being human.  Now, that might sound like its a bit generic and that story has been done before in several other films, but trust me when I say that this film is like no other.  To say that this movie is all over the place would be an understatement.  This movie has so many different genres going on at one time.  At its core, I guess it's a science fiction movie, but it also has drama, as well as comedic moments(lots of them, some good, some bad).  It has some of the most awesome action sequences put to film(imagine the the movie ""the matrix"" but on serious crack).  It has musical numbers( yes that's right, this is also a musical!). It has moments of serious philosophical discussion, but then also has moments that are so stupid, you'd think you were watching low budget kids movie(you just have to see the movie to know what I'm talking about).  Now you might think that because of all of these things going on at once, the movie might be all over the place, but the movie does each and one of them so well that it creates its own unique tone and style.  It's not a realistic movie by any means, nor is it the best acted, but if you just want to watch one the most over the top films ever made then this is your film.",1464307200,,1504,4.2272727272727275
8461616,4,B0058JEIGK,"This was a fun change of pace both from Hollywood and Bollywood (technically Tollywood since this was originally a Tamil film but there you go).

The plot is simple Rajnikant plays a scientist who builds a humanoid robot based on himself named Chitti.  For the first half of the movie we see a familiar string of science fiction cliches as the robot struggles to understand humanity and eventually falls in love with his creator's girlfriend.  In a fit of jealous rage the scientist kills his creation and sends him off to the scrapyard.

In the second half an evil rival rebuilds Chitti installing an evil red chip in him.  Chitti proceeds to kidnap the girl and wreck havoc on the city leaving thousands dead before he finally stopped by his creator.

So it's a pretty familiar take on Frankenstein and countless other robot stories.  But there are some interesting subversions and cultural shifts not seen American films.  For example while American films often cast the scientist as a pacifist who would never let the military get their hands on his creation, in this film the scientist is actively trying to sell his robot to the army, they turn him down as they feel the robot cannot be controlled. When Chitti turns evil there's no soft-coating it.  He and his robot army outright kill countless police officers and soldiers in an epic action sequence.  None of Terminator 2's 'they'll live'.  In another scene Chitti rescues a naked girl carrying her outside.  She is so overcome with shame she immediately kills herself.

As an Indian film there are of course musical interludes and elaborate dance sequences.

At times the special effects don't live up to the film's ambition.  But it's an interesting film combining Indian and American norms into something new.  It's worth seeking out.",1462924800,,1797,4.881188118811881

8461621,3,B0058JEIGK,"This rating is a combination of the Movie, and the quality of this particular product. The movie itself I would give 5 stars, but this DVD and the quality of the transfer is terrible (2 stars). You can actually watch YouTube versions of this movie that are better quality than this (although you'd have to provide your own English subtitles the last time I checked). I was expecting at least a decent DVD transfer, but this was very bad. Fortunately, the movie itself engages you so much that you'd often forget how bad the quality is. I'm hoping I can find a reputable company who sells a studio produced Enthiran (Robot) Blu-ray in HD at a reasonable price. It is truly an entertaining movie if you're into watching Hindi movies.",1396137600,3,731,4.630769230769231
