I believe these sets are privately produced by Amazon, definitely not by the Learning Channel's production company. This is a bare bones set. NO special features, not even a disk menu to choose episodes on each disk. Discovery did much better with seasons 1-3, these new sets leave much to be desired, and at around $5 per episode, the price is steep. Still fun if you want to have these episodes. Come on Learning/Discovery- you can do better than this!!!!!",1211932800,2,959,5.006329113924051
8211463,3,B000TYV4SE,"The dvds are definitely manufactured by someone different than the first 3 seasons.  The dvds are really bad in the fact that they are out of order on the disc (episode wise).  I also had a disc arrive that did not even work.  The best part is that the cheap producers did not use any anti-burning techniques, so you can burn / copy them all you want.  Might save you some money if you don't want to pay the 30 bucks per set.  I would ask around if I were you before buying.

On a good note, the show is still excellent and provides lots of entertainment.  I love American Choppers.  I just hope they choose a better company next time to release the dvds, just for their sake, because pirating is going to be an issue with seasons 4-5-6 (which I bought).",1202860800,,754,4.223776223776224
8211464,1,B000TYV4SE,Season 6? I thought we were up to season 4. I love this show but my god what a mess the DVD releases are. It seems that even Amazon doesn't know much about these new releases.,1191456000,,175,3.888888888888889
