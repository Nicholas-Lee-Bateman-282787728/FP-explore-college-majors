1976118,1,B00018D422,"This movie is horrid! Horrid! Horrid!

Fortunately, I just rented this piece of self-serving ""Jesus Loves Me"" Christian trash. I was expecting a good ""suspensful"" movie about high school students being haunted by a curse of a hangman. Instead, it was a cheesy propaganda film about the supposed ghost of a bullied teen from the 80's who hung himself in the ""forbidden wing"" of the high school. Uhm, not to be nitpicky, but Webster's defines a ""hangman"" as ""A man employed to execute condemned prisoners by hanging,"" not someone who hangs themselves. Oh, and I wish this was the only illogical plot point. But there's more--enough to make Jesus fall off his cross in laughter.
For reasons unknown to me, Christians are unable to harness traditionally secular art forms without making a product that is lame, boring, and completely artistically invalid. For examples, see virtually any Christian rock band, or, for film buffs, this movie. I can think of nothing worse than to be limited to watching only this sort of poorly-acted, embarrassingly scripted, heavy-handed low-budget junk. It's completely unfair to put this in a place where normal horror-movie fans might see it. Imagine expecting a Slayer CD and getting DC Talk. Same effect.
To be fair, there are two good things about this movie:
1. I rented it and did not have to pay for it (Thank you movie pass!)
2. Jake Richardson (""The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys"" and ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"") is hotter than the fires of hell.",1081641600,4,1492,4.874015748031496
1976119,3,B00018D422,"First off let me just be straight forward about this. I hate being preached to, and this movie does have a Christian agenda to it, don't be surprised by that.
There are several scenes that made me wince because it just reeked of the syrupy after-school right-wing ""Jesus loves you,"" slant that most Christian based art comes from. Now, I don't entirely fault the film makers for this because obviously if you choose to make a film you have the right to pretty much take whatever perspective you want and propogate that. I mean, Oliver Stone does that all the time.
So, let me just say that the problem was that alot of the obvious Christian agenda was faulty for that reason, it was so clunky, and conspicuous that it made the film seem amateurish.
The scene with a debate in class over whether prayer in school is wrong...please, take this scene out and the movie jumps up a few notches.  The prayer scenes also seemed contrived like, ""we need to get more preachy, so let's throw in a scene where this happens..."" I mean I will cut them some slack because if you're christian than perhaps you would react to these situations with prayer. So it's not totally out of left field.
Basically you have a film that is part Buffy the Vampire Slayer, part X files, and part Christian after school special.
So what do you get?
Actually, a decent film, that entertained, and despite the preachiness, wasn't altogether too bad.
There are some plot flaws, such as a high school drama club actually making a functioning hangmans gallow as part of their play? And a play that deals with the subject that the school is in the midst of reeling from in terms of their students suffering. Weird.
Ok,
so bottom line. If you don't want preachiness. Don't watch. If you can get past that...not a bad film.
Great if you have younger kids who want some scares and you don't want any foul language. There is no nudity, violence, or profanity in the film.
So there you have it. I won't revisit the film. But it's not bad for what it is.  A Christian agenda horror mystery.",1081641600,3,2047,4.514824797843666
1976120,3,B00018D422,The movie was a bit off in some parts compared to the book. As much as i liked Elijah character the acting in the movie was not very good in some of the scenes because it made it so obious that they were acting out interogating places.  the acting for the most part was good.,1081641600,2,275,4.0
1976121,5,B00018D422,"I am amazed that some non-Christians have tried to knock this movie based upon it's content.  This is NOT a movie inteneded to convert people to follow Christ.
The main focus of this movie is to convert a very good novel to the silver-screen.  I think it is done quite well.  The movie has a great plot, good sub-plots and plenty intense moments.
I agree Frank Peretti over-acted in this film, but hey, the film's good points far outweigh its bad points.  The acting was very believable, and the bullying scenes could have been pulled right out of any high school, today.  I used to be one of those ignorant bullies myself...
Leighton Meester plays Elisha Springfield flawlessly, and she is one of the most beautiful people on the planet.
David Keith (playing Nate Springfield) did a great job, after the ""drug bust"" scene, which I think was a low point in the movie's acting.
Andrea Morris was excellent in her role as the tormented Crystal Sparks.  She really added a lot to this movie.  I actually felt sad for her character during the movie.
Jake Richardson was good as Ian Snyder.
All and all, I think this movie was way better than Arachnophobia, and I think it is not a movie that tries to push Jesus on anyone.  I believe anti-Christians find that a threat in any action a believer takes; even if they ask you to pass the salt...
Buy the movie, it's good!
God Bless.  :-)

1976122,5,B00018D422,"The movie is exceptional in almost all aspects. With a story as intricate as Hangman's Curse (a Frank Peretti book targeted towards teenagers), I didn't expect much less. The storyline is unique, as is the setting for it. For having a cast mostly containing 14-18 year olds, I thought that the acting was very good. Hangman's Curse will not dumb down it's story with sex, gore, or cuss words. With that said, there was still just as much shock and awe and pyschological twists, with the added security of it being okay for your teenager to watch. I highly reccommend this thriller with Christian values and good morals.",1080777600,,619,4.7407407407407405

1976142,5,B00018D422,"I found Hangman's Curse by Frank Peretti to be very thought provoking, and although it deals with some very difficult, and perhaps even disconcerting issues, I would highly recommend it to older readers. However, some of the content and imagery might be difficult for readers under the age of twelve.

Hangman's curse is about a Christian detective family who spend their time solving crimes using various forensic techniques such as analyzing chemicals within a straw, taking crime scene photographs, conducting witness and suspect interviews and speaking with various experts from various fields. The story centers on the investigations of a brother and sister team who work with their parents (very respectfully, might I add) to solve criminal cases. In Hangman's curse, they are trying to figure out why a number of bullies go crazy, and at first, many onlookers attribute the bullies' wild hallucinations and erratic behavior to be the work of a boy named Ian Snyder who portrays himself as some sort of spell-casting witch doctor. However, as their investigation continues, the young sleuths soon learn that there is a much more natural, although equally terrifying explanation for the odd behaviors and even deaths that have been occurring within the high school halls.

This book has an engaging and very suspenseful plot and presents characters with a very close and intimate relationship to Christ. It also addressed some very difficult and important issues like bullying, relativistic thinking and evolution in a clear, concise, and yet entertaining way by weaving thought-provoking details throughout the text.

However, some children might be scared by the mention of witchcraft (which was disproved as it relates to the story by the end of the text), by the imagery of spiders, by the mention of death (one of the students dies due to the mysterious condition that seems to be plaguing the bullies of the high school) and the mention of ghosts (which turn out to be nothing more than hallucinations caused by...oops, you gotta read the book to find out!) However, because wika, or the practice of witchcraft, is growing in America, some parents might like to see this issue addressed in a biblical manner, as Peretti does in this book. However, for those parents who choose to steer clear of these issues altogether or who have children susceptible to nightmares, this may not be the book for them. But for older students, and most especially, non-Christians who have never heard anything about creation or the Truth of God, this book does a wonderful job of addressing some of the issues that our students face in the typical high school classroom and effectively argues for the truth of Scripture.

In a nutshell, I would strongly recommend this book for teens and emotionally mature tweens who are not easily frightened. Arachnophobes should definitely steer clear of this book. Parents will also appreciate the clean language used throughout the text and the fact that there weren't any ""boyfriend"", ""girlfriend"" references or inferences; and students who find themselves on either side of the ""bullying issue"" will either be challenged or encouraged.

1976147,4,B00018D422,"You won't get a headache on that one. But if you don't like insects, particularly creepy-crawly insects with eight legs and that bite, please abstain since you have been warned. They are delicious animals but they don't exactly like company, in fact they hate company. The only thing that attracts them is the hormone of the other sex and they bite if they get the hormone but not the individual of that other sex. The film is building some kind of teenage thriller on the model of Columbine High School (ostracizing and bullying those who dress differently and listen to different music mostly, and a little bullying against the weakest, but just for fun to get some money out of them and see them wet their pants), plus all kinds of allusions to Freddy and Scream, and you name it you have it. So under the surface dark rooms with furnaces and pipes and tubes and shafts and many other ventilation, heating or just there for decoration pipes and tubes and shafts and whatever. A wing of the high school is of course abandoned and locked up and there is a curse from a hangman, from a teenager who was so bullied in his days that ended up hanging himself to pacify his own life radically and without any possibility for the bullying to start all over again. Then you introduce a family of FBI agents, father, mother, son and daughter, all FBI trained, who are going to infiltrate the school after a series of suspicious suicides. And you have it. Add to that a good case of vengeance on the side of the first teenager who hanged himself, since hatred survives in the bloodline of a victim and you have it. The end reveals that teenagers, even if they are FBI trained like fooling around with other teenagers, fooling around and feeling around to, though the film is discreet about it. At the most a little bit of same sex hugging and mixed hand holding.

1976148,1,B00018D422,"What to say and where to start?  Firstly, this movie bills, trails, and presents itself as a horror film.  This movie is like Nancy Drew without any direction, acting, or plot thrown in.  I don't think it has any idea what it wants to be.  It should be played like ""Scary Movie"" but instead opts to take itself shockingly seriously.

The plot is laughable and you know exactly who the ""bad guy"" is from the very first moment you encounter him (because there's simply no other reason for him to exist in the movie).  Things jump from one ridiculous scene to another and there is no reason whatsoever that any of the characters would ever be so blind or dumb in real life (like... you're being interviewed by the principal for attempted murder and the janitor is in the room watching?).  What the...?

More unforgivable than anything is the acting.  It's uniformly terrible amongst every adult role.  The young people in the film aren't great, but they could pass on an ABC Afterschool Special I suppose.  Frank Peretti (the story's author) makes a spectacle of himself in the eccentric professor role.  He's terrible.  Dreadful.  Indescribably bad.  If you were willing to suspend your disbelief for even a moment in this film, it would be shattered the second that he's on screen.

The school bullies are really just nerds with glandular disorders.  The outcast goth rejects are the most attractive people in the film (and for some inexplicable reason, give up goth at the end).  Such is typical of the film's casting.

This is just bad.  Not offensive bad, but completely pathetic film-making all the same.  It is not a buy, it is not a rent, it is not even a watch on tv when you're home sick Saturday night and laugh.  It's an avoid completely no matter your age or interests.  -star out of 5.",1227398400,2,1796,4.631746031746032
1976149,5,B00018D422,"I watched this on November 1st.  It would have been appropriate watching it a day earlier.  This is a very scary movie, relying on terror rather than bloods and guts.  It is rated PG-13, and deservedly so, but this is one PG-13 movie that is ideal for a teen-age audience (but not for a younger audience) as opposed to PG-13 movies which are close to being an R-rated movie.

The acting is not Academy Award worthy but is good.  Especially good is the supporting role of Algernon played by Frank Peretti, who wrote the book this was based on.  If Peretti wasn't busy writing, he should consider a career as being a comic actor.  He was excellent comic relief.

Also good were the background songs, especially those by Renfey.  Her MySpace picture does not fit the audience who would watch a pair of movies she did songs for (this one and ""The Visitation"", based on another Peretti story).

There is a subtle message to the movie concerning the fallacy of ""survival of the fittest,"" and there are expressions of the Christian faith, but as I said, it is subtle.  Those offended by the faith in this movie are offended by any Christian exercise of freedom of religion.",1225584000,2,1166,4.584541062801932
1976150,3,B00018D422,"From the deep dark recesses of a high school comes the curse of Abel Frye...aptly portrayed in the opening scene and following scene of the  football team's quarterback melting away psychologically during the game.  Having not read the book I was not prejudiced with the novel's storyline beating around in my imagination...so I tried this movie out.

I found the cinematography and sound design to be very good with some highlights being the wide angle of the high school corridor in the evening when another ""hangman"" is being chiseled into a locker (excellent clarity and lighting), plus the industrial rock entrance of the goths coming through a doorway at school (slow-motion with full sound).  The look and feel of the curse of Abel Frye was effective enough and not cheesy......BUT there were some mixed attempts at acting with the absolute low-point being the classroom scene where Elisha is challenging the teacher on his double-standards and hypocrisy ( which I think all too often reflects teachers these days ) but her mixing in of ""hip"" words and slang sounded, ohhhhhhhhhhh...""snap""...""my bad""...I'm trying to really give the benefit of the doubt on this.....nope, it was one of the worse scenes of acting and writing I've seen in movies, let alone a ""Teen Thriller"". It seemed that the writers were trying way too hard to sound cool, plus where was the director in terms of the quality of acting.  A ""horrorible"" scene.

On the other hand the scenes with the older actors and veterans, i.e. with the parents and the principal, as well as the scene [SPOILER AHEAD]where Elisha had fallen down the shaft, broken her leg and was being  tortured by psycho-dude and bitten by his throng of spiders brought more tension and creepiness to the plot.

I would probably enjoy Peretti's book more, even though this adaptation was fairly entertaining (like his acting, a bit over the top, but still engaging).  Not a B-movie, but not an A-grade, either.  I wouldn't buy it new....and in fact I didn't (about 3 and 1/2 dollars, used).",1191456000,,2036,4.909620991253644

Don't get me wrong, but this film, just like so many others, has an incredibly misleading teaser/theatrical trailer.  I first viewed the trailer for Hangman's Curse"" as a special feature on another DVD and was impressed with what I saw.  However, at the time I was led to believe that this was a horror film (the cover art also implies this), but that is far from the truth...  I had not read the book that this film was based on at the time I bought the DVD, so I will be unable to relay to you if the movie is accurate to the book or not.  I am however capable of telling you that I did not find at all what I expected when I first viewed the film.  It is a good movie with a really, really good plot and storyline, it is an action packed movie with its fair share of suspense, but contrary to the trailers' implications, there is no ""scary"" element to the film at all.  I would recommend this film if you're looking for a GREAT story and an interesting, edge-of-your-seat movie, but not if you're making a selection to watch at 3 AM on Halloween.",1181779200,,1128,4.242990654205608

Nate and Sarah Springfield and their two teenage children go undercover to solve the mystery claiming the students in the school with a deadly force that can only end in tragedy, after finding out you can not annihilate what you cannot come across.

What I liked though was how it kept you guessing as to what was really going on at Rogers High School.  I enjoyed Elisha and Elijah as a sort of Spy Kids meets Scooby Doo detectives but did believable job.  All of the kids seemed like typical high school kids with their whatever-attitudes.  I did guess who was behind everything about 55 minutes into the movie but still found it interesting how it was done.  If this was a regular movie, I would have rated it lower, but for a Christian movie (where there really isn't a lot of good ones), it was enjoyable and even slightly creepy near the end (don't want to give anything away though but you might start thinking something is on you!).  Also, I checked this out from the library, so it was free, which also helps.  I also think that the Christian overtones were not in your face as Elisha and Elijah use their actions more than words to show their faith.  I am also glad for a logical ending more than an unbelievable supernatural ending.  I also enjoyed the scene in the beginning with the class discussion about prayer in school.  A very good point.  I have not read the book, but enjoyed the movie despite flaws.  If you have a chance, go ahead and check it out.  There is no cursing, although you get to hear Frank Peretti say: ""A chemical booty call.""",1153180800,,1593,4.370748299319728

1976161,3,B00018D422,"""Hangman's Curse"" is an adaptation of a book by a ""Christian"" author (Frank Peretti), published by a ""Christian"" publisher, and promoted by ""Christian"" bookstores. But the religious aspects of the book are soft peddled in favor of elements intended to make it appeal to a wider audience interested in a traditional mild horror film. There is an obvious agenda but it does not overwhelm the story; mostly they wanted to present a positive message for Christian kids in an uncharacteristically ""cool"" package and to show that being Christian does not mean a kid has to be a total dork.

The agenda does have a dark side, a simplistic message that being different and asserting your individuality is a misguided response to facing life's challenges without the assist of inner spirituality. Some may view the film's ending message as anti-diversity, although it positively portrays interracial dating it ends with a conformist message. But this is inserted in such a clumsy and contrived way that few will feel any threat of manipulation.

The compromises they made to mainstream this film have offended both extremist ""Christians"" and hard core horror film fans, which is not exactly a surprise. Extremist ""Christians"" are upset because the ""Christians"" in the film seem to be just like ""regular"" (their word-not mine) people. There has also been some objection to the wardrobe of Leighton Meesier (the actress who poses as a student to investigate the situation) although it looked pretty wholesome to me; Meesier's actual sin is just being radiantly beautiful. If your own faith does not run toward elitist religious egoism you will find almost nothing objectionable. Hard-core horror fans will find this fairly tame although the premise is clever and there are some nice suspenseful moments.

The cast is mostly unexceptional and in many cases the physical casting is way off. The jocks are anything but physically imposing, the main bully would do better cast as a fat nerd and has no business in a speaking role. Crystal and Ian, the two main ""goth"" kids are supposed to be outcasts, but they are the most physically attractive students in the whole school.

The performance of Andrea Morris (Crystal) is the best thing about ""Hangman's Curse"". She is totally convincing in the film's most difficult role. It is a great acting for the camera performance and the director showcases this with frequent tight shots on her face. Meesier is also solid and Frank Peretti himself makes an amusing appearance as an eccentrically jolly scientist.

The direction and editing is very strong. The sequencing keeps things active and interesting. Apparently they deleted material that was needed to clarify the effects of the spider bites; that the victims did not die but rather went into comas until the anecdote was discovered and administered is unclear.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1135296000,10,2894,5.069327731092437
1976162,3,B00018D422,"I will fully admit that I checked out ""Hangman's Curse"" because the idea of a Christian horror film is rather intriguing.  By ""Christian horror film"" I do not mean something like ""The Exorcist,"" where priests show up to save the day, but one in which the heroes are true believers and faithful followers who quote Scripture and call on God for all matters and not those that serve as the basis for horror films.

""Hangman's Curse"" is based on a novel by author Frank Peretti, who is obviously an interesting character as revealed by both the behind the scenes features and his appearance in the film as the eccentric Dr. Algernon Wheeling, the scientist who provides necessary exposition and explanations.  This is the first of several stories about the Veritas Project, a family of investigators who are interested in getting to the truth.  So the Springfield make their way to Rogers High School, where strange things are happening to several students who play on the school football team and everybody is blaming the ghost of Able Frye, a student who hung himself in the school ten years ago.  We know that the kids who are freaking out are doing so because they see those around them turned into frightening figures.

So the Springfields go under cover.  Father Nate (David Keith) will work as a janitor at the school, mother Sarah (Mel Harris) will be in the counseling office, Elijah (Douglas Smith) gets to be the smart kid this time while sister Elisha (Leighton Meester) will play the ordinary kid.  What they discover is that Rogers High is divided into the jocks, the geeks and the Goths and that survival of the fittest is literally the order of the day according to the football coach.  But apparently Able's ghost is willing to go after members of all three groups.  This is all anybody is talking about at school and finding the figure of the hangman in your locker means you are next on the list.

The Goths decide the thing to do is worship Able and hope he goes after their tormenters, and the pivotal scene in the film comes when a Goth chick Crystal Sparks (Andrea Morris) falls victim.  At that point the leader of the Goths, Ian Snyder (Jake Richardson), decides to hang him self to appease Able.  Elijah is trying to stop him and keeps shouting about how it is not Able that is threatening Ian but someone with a different name.  Could it be Satan?  That is not merely a flip rhetorical question but one that is pivotal to ""Hangman's Curse"" because your assumption is not only that the answer is ""yes,"" but that we will see evidence of such that will get us to the familiar ground of horror films.

What is interesting to me is that ""Hangman's Curse"" does not go in what you might think is the obvious direction, which, ironically, might end up being the film's weakness.  That is because while on the one hand I appreciate the way the story keeps things in the realm of reality, on the other the truth that is revealed (remember, ""Veritas"" is Latin for ""truth"") is rather unbelievable, simply because it is really complicated.  I appreciate the idea that Darwinian survival of the fittest could be based on brains rather than brawn, but the truth here almost makes Rube Goldberg look sane and gets the rating on this one down to three stars.  But if rationality goes off the deep end here, I think most people will admit they get the religion right, which Peretti would have to think is more important.

I would add another star to the rating for ""Hangman's Curse"" if it can be shown to a group of teenagers who get to discuss the movie after watching it.  I say that because I think even those who look at what happens here with disdain would have to admit that there are some serious issues involved.  I can easily imagine several interesting discussions that would come from ""Yes, but..."" propositions regarding the issues and topics handled in the film.  Ultimately, what separates this 2003 film from the rest of the horror genre is not the beliefs held by its heroes but rather that there are actually things worth discussing when the whole thing is over.",1133395200,,4085,4.627423822714682

1976164,4,B00018D422,"I decided to watch ""The Hangman's Curse"" for several reasons. The most important of these factors, indeed the only one that really matters, involves the fact that David Keith heads up the cast list. I enjoy this actor's work, although I must say his standards have slipped over the past few years. Let's face it: going from films like ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" to ""Sabretooth"" and ""Deep Shock"" represents a horrific reversal of fortune on par with the dive into obscurity made by another talented actor named Joseph Cotten. Remember him? He's the chap who starred in such cinematic classics as ""The Third Man"" and ""Citizen Kane"" early in his career only to move on to such turgid schlock like ""Guyana: Crime of the Century"" and ""Lady Frankenstein"" towards the end of his life. While those of us who enjoy cheesy cinema might relish seeing the likes of mainstream actors like Keith and Cotten hamming it up in pictures far below their abilities, we must admit it's probably painful for them. Anyway, I figured ""The Hangman's Curse"" as another disappointing Keith project. I was wrong. The movie, while far from high art, does manage to entertain most of the time.

Keith plays Nate Springfield, husband of Sarah (Mel Harris) and father of daughter Elisha (Leighton Meester) and son Elijah (Douglas Smith). Together this family forms some sort of detective type agency that wanders around the country solving crimes. Actually, they work for some shadowy organization called the Veritas Project. Really. I'm not making this up. Their latest case brings them to a typical high school in Middle America where a series of gruesome crimes plague the student body. A long time local legend involving a student named Abel Frye, who supposedly killed himself in a now long abandoned wing of the school because of incessant bullying, seems to play a big part in the catastrophe befalling selected members of the school. The victims of the crimes tend to be bullies themselves, real jerks that like to pick on the Goth population in the school, and they usually ingest some mysterious substance that produces weird hallucinations of none other than Abel Frye himself. Hmmm. I wonder what's going on? Someone is obviously up to no good, and it falls upon the Springfield family to go undercover and crack the case. They've got their work cut out for them.

Elijah and Elisha pose as students in an effort to get the skinny on the various tensions in the student body. Dad takes a job as a janitor in the school so he can be around if things get sticky. Mom stays behind the scenes in the family's snazzy RV where she can examine any evidence that might turn up with the assistance of wildly eccentric Dr. Algernon Wheeling (Frank Peretti). Fun! We soon meet several students at the school--including geeky Norman Bloom (Daniel Farber), Goth chick Crystal Sparks (Andrea Morris), and her partner in black Ian Snyder (Jake Richardson)--who obviously will play a big role in the proceedings. We also meet a bunch of obnoxious jock types whose presence exists solely for the purposes of cannon fodder. I'm not going to provide an intricate analysis of how the plot unfolds because that would definitely spoil the fun. It's sufficient to say that the proceedings are surprisingly complex for a standard horror/thriller flick. We get several interesting twists and turns, red herrings as to who is responsible for the crimes, and a lot of spiders crawling all over the place. Even the dialogue often rises above what I've come to expect from these types of films. ""The Hangman's Curse"" is a fun film with lots of scares.

That's not to say the movie doesn't have moments of pure cheese, however. Exhibit A is Dr. Algernon Wheeling as portrayed by Frank Peretti. Peretti is actually a well-known and best selling author (I've never heard of him before watching the movie), and ""The Hangman's Curse"" is based on one of his books. He might want to consider sticking with his day job since he takes his character WAY over the top. Peretti's performance isn't bad per se, but it does often distract from the main narrative. Thankfully, Keith is in fine form, as are the young actors who play his kids. Leighton Meester deserves special attention for her beauty and her acting chops. She handles a snake in a provocative way few actresses could! The most surprising element of the film, aside from the actors and the clever plot, is the religious themes that pop up from time to time. At one point in the story, the characters get together and pray! This is such an unusual thing to see in a movie that I had to pick my jaw up off the floor. I can't remember the last time I saw religion seriously addressed in what is essentially a horror film. This element of the film is bound to take some people aback, but it's not overdone.

I recommend the movie as an entertaining way to spend a couple of hours. It's not overly gory, though, so fans of blood and guts should look elsewhere. The extras on the disc will keep you busy long after the credits roll. We get a behind the scenes feature explaining how the film dealt with all those spiders, a trailer, and a featurette that is essentially an advertisement for Peretti's other books. Another featurette, called ""Frank Peretti: From Page to Screen,"" is a behind the scenes look at the movie containing interviews with the author and the filmmakers. If you like this movie, check out other projects from director Rafal Zielinski. His film ""Fun"" is about as far as you can get from this movie subject wise, but it's also worth a look.

I would NEVER watch this movie again.  It had a whole lot of satan worship/rituals and very little of God.  I just don't understand how this movie is going to reach the general public.  People will think that Christians are barely any different than regular people because of this movie.  This movie was hard to watch at points and had very little real entertainment.  It had a lot of scary images in it that will probably give kids under 13 nightmares.  It definitely deserves the PG-13 rating.  Because of this movie, I will not be watching any more of Frank Peretti's movies.  If you would like to watch an entertaining Christian movie, try the Left Behind Series.

1976169,1,B00018D422,"I'm not very familiar with the book this film is based on, and heard very little about it because the film itself was released straight to DVD. In fact I recall hearing Frank Peretti, the author, promoting this film over the radio and explaining that it was a mild foray into creepiness for young adults that in the process enforced a positive message. Well, one of my sister's friends lent her a copy of it while I stayed over to babysit my two nieces for the weekend and she inserted this turkey into the player. I was in for quite a show, and not a good one either.

The film kicks off with the death of a disturbed teenaged boy, who hangs himself in one of the more spooky-looking quarters of his high school no less, and the spirit of his disdain supposedly lingers to haunt and...terrify the faculty and students ten years later. A couple of young sleuths are sent in to infiltrate the school and unravel the violent mystery behind the hangman's curse (with their parents of course).

We see jocks singling out the rag tag goths during the course of the movie, and the message that Peretti is instilling here is painfully obvious, almost as if he were grabbing you by the lapels and yelling, ""See?! Everyone should get along! Goths shouldn't be so sad all the time! Boo!"" Myself, I don't like that and find it very annoying, and I love and respect the Lord, so this review is not an attack upon the fact that there is a Christian message present. This is just a downright poor piece of film.

I was 16 at the time when I watched this and took into account that yes, this is trying to be in the vein of R.L. Stein's ""Goosebumps"" in terms of subtle fright and underlying positivity, but this movie, compared to ""Something Wicked This Way Comes"", a Disney movie no less, is quite awful. The highlight of the terror in this turkey is in its climax, where hundreds of venomous spiders infest the high school. Whereas most were real, a great deal of them were computer generated when they leapt at the screen to make us jump. Even though I found this an empty, cheesy way to evoke scares out of its disinterested audience, my skin was crawling. I won't tell you the man or the motive behind the chaos, because if you feel compelled to watch it yourself, feel free, but PLEASE rent it first unless you've read the book beforehand and know what you're getting.

One more note however. The ending. Possibly the worst, most painfully cheesy ending ever devised, and is sure to enrage many a goth and/or bored viewer (like myself). If you desire a truly bad ending that will give you nightmares, this is it. 1 star.",1114560000,5,2610,4.465408805031447
1976170,3,B00018D422,"Three-and-a-half stars would be more appropriate, but alas the Amazon.com star-rating doesn't have that option.

The low-budget movie is based off of Frank Peretti's teen novel of the same title.  Hangman's Curse is highly redolent of the R.L. Stine's ""Goosebumps"" series (both the books and the children's TV show).  Part of the plot strains credibility, namely the part about kids receiving the FBI training.  But then again, a lot of other kids movies strain credibility also (*cough* Agent Cody Banks *cough*).  Fortunately, it does a decent job developing the characters as the mystery unfolds, to the extent that even adults might find the movie ""not bad.""  So while it is primarily a kid's movie, we adults might enjoy it too.  The acting is mostly satisfactory, with the big exception of Frank Peretti himself, who plays an eccentric university professor.  Peretti is a skilled and best-selling Christian novelist, but the man can't act.

The basic plot: two kids are members of the Veritas project and go undercover in a high school posing as students to investigate the alleged paranormal activity.  The kids's father and mother are also members of the project and also go undercover.  Several kids have fallen mysteriously ill, seeing visions pertaining to the Hangman's Curse before they collapse.  Many students attribute the events to the curse of a ghost named Abel Frye, a teen who hanged himself ten years earlier in this very school.  Is the curse real?  What's causing it?  I won't spoil it here.

While the movie is not overtly Christian, a few of its themes can be found.  In one scene, a student or two slams ethical relativism (note the Christian belief in objective moral values).  The soundtrack contains songs by several Christian artists, like Tait and Tobymac; albeit the snippets we hear from them wouldn't necessarily make us THINK they're Christian (think P.O.D. or Switchfoot).  And lastly, there is something of a moral to the story regarding fears and prejudices.  The movie doesn't necessarily beat you over the head with it, but let's just say that some of the characters learn better after the good guys solve the mystery.

My advice to parents?  This is a movie suitable for the kids; after all it seems MADE for them.  Don't let the PG-13 level fool you.  It's quite clean, with absolutely no sex and no profanity.  The movie could easily play unedited on the Disney Channel (actually, I think it did).  A PG rating may have been more appropriate.  Scary moments might not be suitable for younger children, but if they're over the age of eight they can probably handle it.  The kids will be entertained, and that the movie added a moral to the story doesn't hurt either.",1113955200,2,2709,4.907488986784141

More importantly to me is the issue of high school stereotypes. I was labeled as a ""goth"" at my old high school because I chose to dress in black clothes, listen to heavier music, find pleasure in being alone, and watching horror survival movies. Stereotypes are something that really shouldn't exist. Everyone should just be themselves and that's all there is to it. I won't give away the end of this movie, but, it practically drove me to tears when I seen it.",1110499200,2,640,4.525862068965517

I wasn't really expecting much, but I at least hoped it was a clean film.  It doesn't sink as low as many movies, but for a Christian movie, I was hoping for better.  Maybe most wouldn't see anything morally wrong with this movie, but the clothing--even of the Christian girl--were rather immodest.  Even after the girl was out of her undercover work, she wore a dress with a very low neckline.  There were even a couple of uses of ""hell"" in an inappropriate way.

Not only the clothing was worldly, however--so was some of the music and the attitudes.  Christians lying to each other, etc.  I know Christians aren't perfect, but this does not set a good example, and I was very disappointed in this movie!

Now for the storyline.  That was weak, as well, though it had it's interesting moments.  Spiders overtaking a school?  Hmm.  And there was no spelling out of how bad the occult practices are, as there seem to be in most of Frank Peretti's books.

I'm kind of surprised Frank Peretti would approve of this film, much less act in it.  His part was slightly funny, but over-the-top.

I went through it all through high school, and I know parents and teachers like to say they all went through it too, and that its just something that all kids must go through to become better people. But in my point of view, all kids should not have to endure it. I'm not a bible thumper, nor am I some revenge driven teenager. But it really made me say, why can't the world be like the ending of this movie, minus the horrible wake up call. All kids have different scenes, all kids like to look different, wear different clothes. But deep down in your soul, you all may have the same point of views. If you looked past the outer appearance, and looked inside, you'd be surprised who you ended up being friends with.

The reason is this: I love movies that  make me feel something, this one did just that, I laughed hystrically (ok, maybe not that hard) and I cried at least three times. Another reason that I like it so much is that after it was over, I felt disturbed, but in a good way.

This movie reminds us all of our high schools with the different cliques: jocks, popular kids, goths, geeks, etc. It also plays with people's feelings of not fitting in and being picked on by the popular kids.

However, as a fan of Frank Peretti's previous books I was VERY disappointed to find that there was no spiritual or Christian message to the film at all.  (No, saying ""grace"" over a picnic meal does not count as a substantive spiritual message!)

Being a filmmaker myself I understand that films must be aimed at the broadest possible audience, but in removing any spiritual message from the film they have removed the very element that makes Peretti's work stand out from other secular horror/mystery writers.  They've removed the heart.

In fact, the students in the film who were apparently involved in witchcraft come off as more or less INNOCENT VICTIMS of the individual perpetrating the crimes!  There was no real rebuke or correction of their involvement in witchcraft at all, much less a presentation of the Christian gospel.  (Yes, the Veritas boy in passing warns the other boy about getting involved with spiritual powers, but this is just a brief mention, very watered-down).

This was all the more disappointing after viewing the ""making of"" featurette in which Peretti is presented as having a complete involvement in the film project (his professor role in the film is played a bit over the top, not surprising if you've seen his Saturday kid's show).  One would think that Peretti himself would see the absolute necessity of presenting or preserving spiritual themes in the work, since that has been the root of his success as a writer of Christian fiction.  After all, we don't NEED another Stephen King.  We do, however, need the Peretti of his early books (PROPHET being arguably the best).

Peretti mentions in the featurette that he is working to perhaps get his other books produced as films.  That sounds exciting, but if he allows the screenwriters to water them down and have little spiritual emphasis as they've done in this case, he needn't bother.

As a mystery, this is a nice little thriller for young people (if you don't mind the ""bad-boy"" element of the student witches or the hard rock music), but it is by no means a ""Christian"" film in it's themes, or spiritually substantive.  Enjoy it as a nice mystery story, but if you're a Peretti fan I think you'll be VERY disappointed that it packs no spiritual substance behind the surface story.",1097193600,5,2403,4.884236453201971
1976178,2,B00018D422,"I ask that because he and the rest of the Mystery Inc. gang would of solved this one in 22 minutes, instead of the hour and fourty minutes it took for the stars to figure it out. This is basically nothing more, or deeper, than a live action version of that old cartoon. Creepy school(where I went since this is filmed in my hometown), a gang of red herrings, and evidence that pretty much points to the culprit who is behind everything. You will know who the bad guy is way before the second half kicks in. This is filmed where I lived and my old high school, so I wanted to like it. It's just ""meh"". Based on the popular novel by Frank Peretti, who appears in the film in an over thet op performance as Dr. Algernon, the story is about a family who work for the Veritas Project. A select group who travel around and solve mysterious crimes and goings on. The team here is a mother and father(played by the only name people in the movie, David Keith and Mel Harris), and their kids Elisha(Leighton Meester), and Elijah(Douglas Smith, the little brother of Everwood's Gregory Smith). They get a mission at Rogers High School to uncover why star football players are having delusions and going nuts before collapsing and slipping into comas. Some, especially the goth section of the school, chalk it up to the ghost of a tormented teen who hanged himself in the school ten years prior to these events, who is out getting revenge. And if you get the mark of the hangman in your locker, then your time is up. It isn't a bad idea. It isn't bad at all. It even conjures a scene here or there that is kinda chilling, but the movie is paper thin and plays everything safe. It is PG-13 after all, and it plays like an extended Afterschool Special. It might of been something if it aimed higher than it did, or was in the hands of a different filmmaker. The acting is amateurish. Not very good at all. Keith and Harris, the veterans, do what they can, but it's basically the kids' show, and they aren't necessarily bad. They get into it a bit more as the film moves on, but it's pretty below average throughout. That said, the kids are likeable and watchable enough. Leighton is a pretty waif, and Douglas is very likeable. There are no surprises here at all. Everything is very transparent and you can tell what will happen long before it does. For an interesting premise and a great location with the school, it had things going for it. But in the end, they settled for middle of the road and that's what they got.",1096070400,,2506,4.391397849462366
1976179,4,B00018D422,"I think this is a really clever movie that has a good message behind it. I also believe that all the young actors did a really good job, especially since a lot of them were first timers in the acting business. Ian (Jake Richardson), who was the ""leader"" of the Gothic students, had to be my favorite character. Not only because he was irresistably cute (>.<'') but because you could tell his character felt a lot and cared for Crystal Sparks. You could sense the pain in his eyes, his worry, his repressed anger, and the feeling of being alone (especially in the scene where Ian puts his head in a noose in order to get Abel's attention).

  I also think that the movie (with the exception of the line ""Oh snap"") depicted teenagers fairly well, and how life is like in high school when you're different. Hangman's Curse also had its lighter parts to it, which I found myself being extremely amused by. (Such as Ian's version of jumping jacks, and when Elijah was undercover as a druggie and kept dancing to music only he could hear----I have friends like that, so that's probably why I liked it so much). This movie delivers its message clearly, without overdoing it with sweet goodie goodieness. I think the movie targeted a primal fear in all of us. I mean, even if you're not easily scared of spiders, having hundreds of them crawling on you will surely make you terrified. I really enjoyed how the characters developed throughout the story, and how they interacted with one another. The ending version of Ian and Crystal shocked me a little, but hey, they were happy weren't they?

  The only reason why I didn't give this movie 5 stars was the author of the book who played the eccentric scientist. I understand he was supposed to be a little zany, but still. His acting angered me so...-.-'' But anyways, I recommend this movie to anyone with an open mind, who enjoys trying to figure out the endings to movies and/or books. The ending will really get you!!! So overall a very well thought up plot with characters that you can really get to care about. Check it out! ^ ^",1095638400,,2076,4.522666666666667
1976180,3,B00018D422,"With the problem of bullies and kids being bullied, this movie had to be made.  I like that they were able to get across how the bullied kids didn't use actual guns to ""get even"" with the bullies.  That would have been too controversial.  I feel that the story itself was good, but the acting was so-so.  Had the budget been larger, and a better director got his/her hands on it, it would have been an excellent movie.  Unfortunately, Christian movies tend to have lower budgets, so they have to pay lesser known actors and directors.  Speaking of better actors...  there were some cheesy lines in this movie.  The funniest two, in my opinion, are the two lines spoken by two Caucasian teenage girls: ""...and he was fronting on her..."", and ""Oh Snap!  I forgot..."".  Also, take ""Christian Movie"" with a grain of salt.  It appeared that almost toward the end of the movie, the director just than remembered that it was a Christian movie, so threw in a religious song or two, and had a prayer at the end.  I purchased this movie, hoping for a Christian movie, since the only way you can watch them is to purchase them, since video rental stores hardly ever carry them.

If you are able to rent this movie, and you have high school kids living with you, it ought to be worth checking it out.  Like I said, the morals of the movie are good.",1093392000,,1336,4.422131147540983

It is an excellent portrayal, however, of the results of bullying and the effects of ignoring it. Some may quibble that the goths and pseudo Satanists are stereotypes but that complaint is minor. I do take issue, however, with the plot device of the play ""The Hangman"" which is being produced by the school. As a teacher, I find it hard to believe that any school which suspects the occult and has a history of a student who hanged himself would never allow such a production to continue. The video will appeal to those who are looking for horror with a Christian theme.",1093219200,,687,4.59349593495935
1976182,4,B00018D422,"The only reason I did not give this movie five stars was because of the spiders. I'm severely arachnophobic, and if I'd known what was to come in the last half hour, I would probably never have hired this film.
That aside, I was disappointed to read so many negative inferences into the film. I did not see it as perpetuating the whole 'Jocks/mainstream is good - Goth is evil' thing. It was, however, a strong effort to warn both mainstream students about the evil in oppressing someone just because they are a little bit different (karma always comes back to bite you in the rear), and a warning to anyone suffering at the hands of bullies about the dangers of trying to take revenge.
I also believe people have completely mis-interpreted the thanksgiving prayer right at the end of the film. It was a young man who was making his first effort at saying a prayer, and if anyone thinks God wouldn't have had a smile for him needs to take a good look at their own attitudes.
There is plenty to be positive about with this movie. One of my favourite points was when one of the Goth students tries to hang himself, and one of the jocks that had previously been harassing him ran to help and save him.
Hangman's Curse is a good story. My only concern is the lack of emphasis on the family's Christian beliefs. It is worth watching, though - assuming you're not arachnophobic.",1089504000,5,1372,4.47011952191235

(yes, the highschool really is as ghetto as the movie makes it seem.)  Some of our friends were extras in the movie, so we had a good time looking for them.
The plotline was a good idea, but it was played out poorly.  The actresses, especially the leading girl and her friends, are downright horrible.  But the stupidity of what the characters do and the movie's obsession with how preps are good and goths are evil is pretty irritating, but also hilarious. Maybe I just got a kick out of the moive because I recognized everywhere the people went.
The one thing that really bugged me about the movie was how the family lived in an RV by the river.  The place they were living is a good 20-30 miles from Rogers Highschool, yet the kids walk there in what appears to be a few minutes.  I guess I'm one of the few people who'd know that though.

Granted, it's nice to see a ""Christian"" horror movie, and Frank Peretti is to be commended for trying to reach a young audience in a genre not accustomed to saying a prayer before a meal.  The direction is tepid, and only manages to be suspenseful once we find out the spiders are the culprits, along with one of the students whose guilt is obvious the first time we see him.  Again, we get goths with their black lipstick, black clothing, saying they want to be different, but the same in their own goth world.  Leighton Meeser is good in the role of Alicia; she should have a great future ala Lindsay Lohman.  Douglas Smith as her brother is more wooden and thespianistic, but he shows promise.  Frank Peretti should be ashamed of himself for even appearing in the movie; hopefully, he'll stick behind the word processor and not force us to watch him over emote as he did in the role of the ""genius"".  Mel Harris and David Keith are wasted as the parents, although Keith puts out a little more than Ms. Harris (who must still be in her thirtysomething phase?).  Almost as banal as an afterschool special, the movie only delivers its promised chills when the spiders come out.  The special feature about Brian Gibbs, the spider wrangler, is fun; Gibbs is also the rat wrangler for the movie ""The Rats.""  He should have played Peretti's role.

Something's getting the bullies at a high school, and a family of investigators goes undercover to find out what's going down. Like most schools, this one's got a fair share of bullies, who pick on the resident goth population. The goths are looking for some otherworldly revenge, and it appears to be working.
The movie does start off slow and a little awkward, but you see the tension building as the plot structure grows. The acting, for the most part is OK, and while Frank Perretti's character is a little annoying, you can tell he was having fun, and that joy was infectous.

Incidentally, Hangman's Curse contains a few parallels to my novel Under the Blood. This novel features Gil Leduc who finds his good friend Paul Connors dead in a field on the way to school.

1976207,4,B00018D422,"I have to admit I wasn't sure if I would like this movie.  I am a Christian, but I hate to say it, a lot of Christian movies have left me wanting more.  I bought this as a gift for a sick family member, and watched it with my family.  I'm not ashamed to say that this movie had excellent connotations and considerations, and hit home on several issues that need to be directed upon.
The biggest issue is that of bullying and bullies.  As in Columbine, remember that?, Frank Peretti's book and movie was not so much about telling people how to be saved, but to address point blank the horrors found in our schools today.  Whether its the jocks against the nerds against the goths, there's pain spread all around, and sooner or later, as seen on national news these days, something gives.  And usually, that ends up with someone or someones dead.  This movie talks about this in very good ways, very realistic ways, showing the anger and the attacks and the psychological damage done by bullying.  The main characters are thrust into having to see the cause and effect, having to see the evils of what kids will do to other kids.
The highschool in the movie was a true to life theater of the anguishes found in being a young adult today.  Trying to fit in, trying to fight back, trying to just maintain some sort of sanity when there is so much going on around you and such little foothold (especially if you aren't a Christian, and even then you have to let God bring you through it His way, not your own way).  The background characters, whether the goths or  the nerds showed true, having trouble to fit in, having trouble to figure out, having trouble to find some dignity in a teenage wasteland where there is so little.  In this movie I felt for these kids because I know that a lot of these feelings and angers and anamocities between groups is real.  I myself faced bullying by many and I myself was a bully to some, thank God for Salvation to wash the sins away from the heart.
Yes there could have been a greater depth of Christian religious worldview in the movie.  The movie makers, in my opinion, should have used the Christian worldview as the moral compass that directs the main character family against what was happening in the Hangman's Curse.  As the truth of the Bible, as read and as shown by God, there is a need to confront social problems in our lives...whether its the abortion issues, witchcraft preying upon the hearts of our children, or bullying...there is a great need for a direct Christian response to the horrors of the world.  Sadly, this movie didn't home into that.
Still, I have to give the movie company who worked this project out some strong credit.  The acting, the actions, the mystery itself was intriguing and well worth the seeing.  Even if one is not a Christian, I am sure the issues (the main being bullying) hits home with a lot of people because I would say a lot probably had to face that in their past, whether they were the instigators or the targets.
All in all, yes it wasn't a direct Christian movie, but still, it was a strong adventure and I am not sad to say I bought the DVD.  You will be entertained, and you will have to face the issues addressed in this movie in your own mind and heart.

While I found ""Hangman's Curse"" a good book, it wouldn't have been my choice for a first movie. Still, they manage to adapt it reasonably well. It's a little slow-paced in parts, and yes, some of the acting is a little off, but it has its redeeming points. It's a family film that should keep the interest of teens and kids (though the adults will probably find themselves going to the kitchen for popcorn quite often).
The Christian message isn't overt. As a matter of fact, this couldn't really be considered a ""Christian movie"". Yes, one of the main characters prays during a crisis, but that's what most Christians do. There is no ""Romans Road to Christ"" laid out in the film, and it shouldn't offend anyone who's not a Christian. The special effects are good, especially for the budget they had to work with.
All in all, this is a movie I'm glad I watched, but I doubt I watch it again any time soon. I look forward to another Frank Peretti film in the future, but I hope it's ""The Oath"" or ""This Present Darkness"", either of which would be incredible. Don't judge Frank's works by this movie.

1976211,3,B00018D422,"The Hangman's Curse, based on Frank Peretti's novella The Veritas Project: The Hangman's Curse, is a tight little gothic thriller about a family who work on solving mysteries that appear to have a supernatural element. Rogers High School appears to be haunted by the ghost of Abel Frye, a young man who hung himself on school property ten years before the events that occur in the story. The Springfield family (what appears to be an inside joke....where are the Simpsons from?) infiltrate the school to find out why certain students go screaming insane from a visit by the late Abel Frye. The explanation of the mystery is creative and ingenious though scientifically impossible, but it makes for a good story if you can suspend disbelief.
The acting is quite good though the actor portraying Norman Bloom is a little stiff and Peretti is given to a bit of overacting. The soundtrack has some excellent musical interludes and it is easy to see the director knew what he was doing. I appreciate that goths, geeks, and jocks are portrayed as human beings without resorting to the temptation of stereotypes.
It is interesting to read reviews that are more interested in what they view as too much or too little of a Christian gospel message. The Hangman's Curse is neither an evangelistic tract or a brainwashing tool. It is 106 minutes of fairly good entertainment where, because the main characters happen to be Christians, they act like Christians would act. And yet, in no place does the film become a bully pulpit even  with the scene concerning prayer in school. The scene portrays a natural give-and-take that occurs in schools everywhere everyday.  If anything, the real ""in-your-face"" message of the movie is about the horrors of schoolyard bullying.
Bottom line: The Hangman's Curse is an entertaining PG-13 thriller you could show at a teen youth retreat or just kick back for a personal evening's diversion.",1081728000,3,1917,4.931888544891641
