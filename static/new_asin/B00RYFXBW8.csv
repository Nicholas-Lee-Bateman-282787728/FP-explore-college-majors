8696317,1,B00RYFXBW8,"This is quite lame!  As much as we love Joe Cocker, this is a once only viewing.  Interesting opening interview that would have been just as good to read and there was little or none of the other things promised that you could not have gotten on a better produced DVD.  We kept going back to the title page thinking we had missed something!",1467072000,,340,4.28125

8696319,4,B00RYFXBW8,"This unauthorized DVD ""In Memory Of Joe Cocker The Legend"", was released In early 2015 shortly after the passing of this rock n roll icon.  This 45 minute tribute has two recent interviews from around 2012, and some rare and complete performances of Joe and the Grease band from the late 60's. The video quality is superb on these performances that I believe were filmed in France.  You see him singing full length versions of ""Feeling Alright"", ""Just Like aA Woman"", ""The Letter"", and ""With A Little Help From My Friends"".  My only gripe, is I wish it could have been a bit longer.  Having said that, this DVD tribute is sure to please his legion of dedicated fans who he left behind with many great memories.  If anything, Joe Cocker surely deserves to be recognized and inducted into the RRHOF, as Billy Joel said recently.",1426896000,4,826,4.63013698630137
