5692323,5,B00C7A8WWO,"""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis"" is my favorite of all the sitcom TV shows of that era.  If you want to see a prime example of the fun, innocence and sweetness we ""Baby-Boomers"" experienced in our television viewing during the 50s and early 60s, this show, along with ""Leave It to Beaver"", ""Father Knows Best"", ""The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet"", ""The Andy Griffith Show"", as well as several others, this is it. I love this show!  My question is, ""Why don't they make BlueRay editions of these TV shows as well as DVD?  I would gladly pay a premium for them.  True, they were not so highly defined back then with our old analog over-the-air TV as on digital DVD, but seeing them today in 1080p would be such a treat indeed!",1365724800,6,726,4.395522388059701
5692324,5,B00C7A8WWO,"IMPORTANT NOTE June 28,2013: For anyone on a budget or who only wants to purchase certain seasons of Dobie, SHOUT! is also selling all 4 Seasons of The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis separately. You can pre-order Season 1 now, as it will be released on September 10,2013. This is great of SHOUT! to also release the Seasons separately, as I have a few friends who are only interested in the early Seasons when Warren Beatty and Tuesday Weld starred.

The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis was a television series based on the collection of short stories of the same name by Max Shulman. The series revolved around typical 50's teenager Dobie Gillis, played by Dwayne Hickman, who wanted what every teenager dreams of having- popularity, money and beautiful girls. Dobie's best friend is not your typical 50's teenager, but the new teenage beatnik- Maynard G. Krebs played by Bob Denver. Dobie has to contend with his classmates- some are what he himself wants to be- such as the popular and wealthy Milton Armitage played by Warren Beatty or the spoiled rich Chatsworth Osborne Jr. played by Steven Franken. The prettiest girl in class is someone Dobie would adore to have as more than just his love interest- Thalia Menninger played by Tuesday Weld. The only thing keeping Thalia out of Dobie's grasp is his lack of money, which Thalia loves and has to have. Dobie's best female friend is brainy classmate Zelda Gilroy, who keeps him in reality with her keen observations on their teenage life. Dobie's parents who own a grocery store add a lot of comedy to his 50's life, as does best beatnik friend Maynard.

The guest stars were always just as interesting as the cast. The wealthy mothers to Milton Armitage and Chatsworth Osborne Jr. were the same actress- Doris Packer. Since Milton and Chatsworth were cousins, their mothers were obviously sisters. William Schallert played Leander Pomfritt, the English teacher in both High School and Junior College. Jean Byron played mathematics teacher in both High School and Junior College also, and it is funny that Schallert and Byron ended up playing Patty Duke's parents following Dobie Gillis on The Patty Duke Show. Dobie's real life brother, Darryl Hickman played his brother Davey Gillis and Michael J. Pollard played Maynard's cousin Jerome Krebs. Raymond Bailey played the Dean, who many of you will recognize as Milbourne Drysdale from The Beverly Hillbillies. There was also quite a list of girl's Dobie would like to date on the series- Yvonne Craig (Batgirl), Barbara Bain (Mission Impossible, Space 1999),  Marlo Thomas, Sally Kellerman, Ellen Burstyn (when her name was McRae), Michele Lee, Cheryl Holdridge and many more.

CBS aired the show from 1959 to 1963. Even though it was a big hit with the late 50's and early 60's teenagers, it never went too high in the Nielsen ratings. In Seasons 1 and 4 it never made the top 30, and in Seasons 2 and 3 it made #22 and #23. The first season focuses on Dobie in High School, the second season finds Dobie and Maynard joining the Army right out of High School, the third season finds Dobie and Maynard in Junior College, and you can tell from the last and fourth season that the writers were running out of ideas to keep the show going. In the last season, they actually wrote a show about being stuck together with one of those straw Chinese finger locks called The Beast With 20 Fingers. When the show began, you would always see Dobie posed as Rodin's The Thinker contemplating his newest teenage dilemma. The times may have changed, but Dobie's teenage dreams of popularity, money and beautiful girls has not.

This is a wonderful, witty, funny and sharply written show that Dobie fans have been begging to be put on dvd for many long years. It's hard to believe that Shout! Factory is making all of our wishes come true on July 2, 2013, after such a long wait! The Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis was a launch pad for many very young actors and actresses careers- Warren Beatty, Tuesday Weld, Michael J. Pollard, Yvonne Craig, Jack Albertson, Sally Kellerman and Michele Lee to name a few. A Million Thank You's Go to Shout! Factory for all their time and effort working on the Many Loves Of Dobie Gillis. I heard we will not only be getting all 4 seasons pristinely fixed up on dvd, but some fantastic bonus material as well! From All Of Us Dobie Fans- THANK YOU SHOUT! You've made our long awaited dreams come true!!

5692325,4,B00C7A8WWO,"Been a long long wait! but finally we get to own and enjoy this wonderful TV Series.
As an avid collector of 50's-60's and 70'S Television I look forward to July release date.
Made my day!!!",1365724800,4,190,4.305555555555555
5692326,5,B00C7A8WWO,"Thank you, SHOUT! I loved this series as a kid and have been waiting for someone to collect it! Thanks for your work to bring this to market. WORK!",1365552000,4,147,4.103448275862069
5692327,5,B00C7A8WWO,"After hearing a radio interview with Dwayne Hickman a few years ago, I believed that a release of the series was imminent. THE best thing was that Dwayne was very keen to see the series out there. Glad to see a TV actor take such pride in their work, especially work so beloved by fans. Baby Boomers like me have some cash to spend re-living their childhood (Please read closely Warner Bros westerns in particular).
I'm an Aussie and there are STACKS of us looking forward to lots of 50s and 60s TV content being released ASAP. Just like all our American friends.
So... Dobie... let's start demolishing the old Endicott Building, start serving Mumsy's watercress sandwiches, re-running ""the Monster that devoured Cleveland"" and ""Son of the monster that devoured Cleveland""!! YEAH!",1365465600,33,780,4.916666666666667
5692328,4,B00C7A8WWO,"Don't get me wrong, I really want this series (been on my Wish List for ages) but I see there will be 20 DVDs and the series only ran for 4 seasons - wonder why so many DVDs - maybe there are only 2 or 3 episodes on each disc perhaps because they will be digitally enhanced/remastered (hope so) - anyone?",1365379200,3,304,4.0
5692329,5,B00C7A8WWO,"Ah, to hear those words again from Mrs. Chatsworth Osborne Sr. admonishing her spoiled playboy son who will reply with an ""OH, MUMSY!"" The sharp dialogue and cadence of this series is like no other. Bob Denver's work-adverse Maynard G. Krebs plays off the beatnik era of the time and is a more iconic role than his soon-to-be Gilligan persona. Look for Warren Beatty and Tuesday Weld in early roles. This was not your typical ""family"" comedy- Not with Herbert T. Gillis, Dobie's father always saying ""SOMEDAY, I'M GOING TO KILL THAT BOY!"" Once again we will be reunited with Dobie perpetually sitting next to the statue, ""The Thinker"", pondering his ill-fated but hopeful life!",1365379200,60,677,4.895652173913043
5692330,5,B00C7A8WWO,"I was a big Bob Denver fan before Gilligan's Island.  Maynard G. Krebs was the original beatnik/slacker of his time.  If you like Dobie Gillis, this will not disappoint.",1481068800,,169,4.793103448275862
5692331,5,B00C7A8WWO,Many likes for the vendor.  (Love seems a bit strong; don't even know you.)  Bought two of these.,1477440000,,97,4.333333333333333

5692333,5,B00C7A8WWO,"Unbelievably this show's first seasons were authored and filmed in the late 1950s yet contain content/issues/dilemmas/controversies that are exactly what parents and kids face today.  If you think the stories from Modern Family (and most other half-hour family TV comedies shot anytime during the past fifty years) are original, guess again.  If you believe that it's only the Hippies that had a sense of Tune In, Turn On, Drop Out, or the Punk/New Wavers that had their Me Generation, or that only the Millennials grew up with a sense of entitlement, think again.  For the past four decades I have had a completely different impression about what it was like to grow up in the Fifties and early Sixties.  This series woke me up to a new reality.  Highly Recommended.",1467849600,2,767,4.869230769230769
5692334,5,B00C7A8WWO,"I have always wanted to create an employment company. It's name would have been the Maynard G. Krebs Agency. It was a pleasure to watch this series again with Maynard jumping at the mere mention of the word ""work"".",1465171200,,214,4.512820512820513

5692340,5,B00C7A8WWO,"If you're from this era of television and remember anything abut this show, you'll probably love this. It's interesting how these old shows are better than anything on today. They're innocent and entertaining. Bob Denver is the perfect side-kick to Dwayne Hickman's main character. I don't have cable, and don't like television today very much.

The humor is loaded with meaning that will have nostalgic effects, and those who lived as young adults through the era spanned by the Dobie Gillis series will be brought back to a vision of America that was much more innocent than it is today. By the way, as a bonus, you will find Bob Denver, Tuesday Weld, and Warren Beatty in their early careers here.",1438646400,5,527,4.5

On a separate note, we received this ""complete DVD series"" but it was not complete- one DVD was missing from season 3.  We did not discover this until a few months after receiving it, meaning we were past the deadline for returns/ replacements per Amazon policy.

In syndication, Dobie Gillis was one of the most noticeable victims of time compression, or speeding up the episode like a DJ would a song on '60's AM radio stations, to get more commercials vs. content in per half hour. Many episodes are so good, ""Best Dressed"", that I've gone back to watch them again. Tuesday Weld is mesmerizing, not just her beauty, but her expressions and timing. I don't mind the army episodes as much as some, as it's the continuing journey of good buddies.  Mr and Mrs Gillis are not to be overlooked (it's too bad Florida Friebus didn't return for Whatever Happened To Dobie Gillis? [1977] as she was still acting, on The Bob Newhart Show, at the time).

As with all great shows, the ensemble cast works together without any weak performances. It is a delight to see many cameos of well known and soon to be well known stars. The DVD is black and white as you would expect, but everything is nicely transferred, clear with equally clear sound. My wife and I have been watching several episodes each night and there are many more to go.

5692388,5,B00C7A8WWO,"This is the entire all 4 seasons on this DVD release. If you like old comedy series from the 50's and 60's then this is for you.
All about a young guy  named Dobie Gillis played by Dwayne Hickman who wants to find a girl and fall in love. Unfortunately,he falls in love with every girl he see's except one.
That's the girl who loves him and intends to marry him no matter what. Zelda Gilroy is her name and matrimony is her game. Sheila James plays Zelda with the twitchy nose.
He has a best friend, a beatnik named Maynard B Krebs who is played by Bob Denver later to become Gilligan on ""Gilligan's Island"". Other characters on the show are Dobie's parents Frank Faylen and Florida Frebus. Steve Franken plays Dobie's nemisis Chatsworth Osborne and Doris Packer plays his rich mother. Episodes are always a plus when she is in it. She calls her son ""that nasty boy. Just like his nasty father"".In the first season Dobie's father was often heard saying as he looked into the camera ""I've gotta kill that boy. I just gotta"" when he got flustered with his son. This was dropped for the second season. A shame as I found this quite amusing.
Unlike other shows this series time period moves on each season. The first season he is just about to leave high school,the second he has enrolled in the army, the third and final season he has a honourable discharge and has gone to college followed all the while by his best friend Maynard.
The first season Warren Beatty and Tuesday Weld are part of the cast. Warren left half way through the first season and Tuesday near the end of the season but would appear in two more episodes in the third and final season.
Look out for the first season episode ""Chicken from Outer Space"" where a giant 10 foot chicken appears. The special effects are really good for a series made in 1959. Usually you would see this kind of special effects in the sci fi movies from the same period in the theatres.
Also see Dobie's hair change colour,although this show was made in black and white, from bleached blonde to his natural dark brown as the series progresses.
Bonus material includes the pilot for the series which shows actor Ron Ely ""tv's ""Tarzan"" and Yvonne Craig,batgirl in ""Batman""  who were to be in the series but were never to appear again apart from Yvonne Caig who would appear in a few episodes as another character.
Three episodes of ""Love that Bob"" starring Robert Cummings and Ann B Davis as his secretary, who would also become famous later on as Alice the housemaid in ""The Brady Bunch"". Dwayne Hickman plays the Nephew on the show. One episode of ""The Stu Irwin Show"" where  Sheila James  also appears  as the daughter. Dwayne Hickman appears in the one episode that is on this DVD. Two clips of tv specials with Dobie Gillis appearing one in colour. Also material from the show where you have to put the disc in your computer to access.
Not a lot of guest stars on the show. Those that do appear are Sally Kellerman, Michelle Lee ""Knot's Landing"" Jack Albertson ""Chico and the Man"", Ron Howard ""Happy Days"",Rose Marie ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" and Bill Bixby ""The Incredible Hulk""",1394409600,,3125,4.514134275618375

Highly recommended!",1394409600,,408,4.342105263157895
5692390,5,B00C7A8WWO,"Eager young Dobie Gillis falls madly in love in almost every episode of ""The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis,"" the landmark CBS sitcom based on the famous short stories by Max Shulman.

In addition to being girl-crazy, the Dobie as depicted in the stories was also a hapless and mildly sneaky young man who was a teen, college student or whatever Shulman wanted him to be at a given time. The Dobie stories was also adapted into a splashy MGM movie that often runs on TCM.

The series took the stories and expanded them into TVs first teen-focused prime time comedy, starring Dwayne Hickman, fresh from playing a similar role on The Bob Cummings Show. What made the TV show extra-special was the flexibility of its format and its remarkably talented, revolving cast, particularly Bob Denver as Maynard G. Krebs, Sheila James as Zelda Gilroy and Frank Faylen as Dobies dad.

Even though show left the series, Tuesday Weld made a few appearances in later shows, but for the most part she was replaced by a succession of young ladies who had some of her attributes but lacked her quirky charm; they were mostly one-note females of the late 50s/early 60s. They were certainly not shining examples of todays social mores.

Neither for that matter was Dobie, who tried to pick up young ladies with some pretty cringe-worthy lines, most frequently calling them my great tawny animal. Even the girls in the series generally find his lines more than smarmy.

Hickman clearly soaked up his youthful show business experiences like a sponge. His performance, as he has himself noted, veers between Bob Cummings and Jack Benny and it makes him a superb straight man. The episodes in which he is not the sole protagonist are the ones that hold up best.

Bob Denver created two pop culture icons with Maynard and Gilligan. They are similar but not identical. Denver is better than he gets credit for. Maynard is more introspective, witty and ironic than Gilligan. Both Maynard and Gilligan are like innocent children, both chatter incessantly, but Maynard is about 14 years old inside while Gilligan is about 9. Like Jughead in the Archie comics, Maynard doesnt mind girls as friends but would rather not get involved in a relationship that would tamper with his precious weirdness.

The language of the Dobie Gillis show is legendary, from Maynards squeal of WORK! beginning in season one to the movie that seems to be playing at the theater for five years, The Monster That Devoured Cleveland. The characters names are almost Seussian.

As Dobies dad, Faylen is a crusty but benign owner of a small grocery store filled with quaint, low 1960's prices. Like Archie Bunker, he often mentions his WWII service (including a good conduct medal). Florida Friebus, as Dobie's mom, gets little to do for the series run except for a few second season episodes. It's a shame because she was a stage veteran (she co-wrote a Broadway version of Alice in Wonderland with Eva LaGallienne) and of course, was the lady who knitted on The Bob Newhart show.

The character I would have liked to see more of was Zelda Gilroy, the determined pursuer of Dobie. Zelda is constantly proven to be capable of a lot more than Dobie, perhaps an early comment on the limited choices women had over 50 years ago. She could be Dobies booster but seemed not allowed to boost herself  at least until she became a recording star (which was never followed through).

Fans of the show know that the real life Sheila James Kuhl became a highly respected State Senator. It would have been interesting to see how the fictional Zelda and Thalia in particular might have changed with the times as the 60s progressed.

As you enjoy each season, look for familiar faces. William Schallert, also known to TV buffs as Patty Dukes TV dad, plays Professor Pomfret. When the characters enter college, their new professor is Dr. Burkhart, is played by Dukes TV mom, Jean Byron, who gets far more to do on the Dobie show than on the Duke one.

Also popping up in episodes are Ryan ONeal, Marlo Thomas, Steve Franken, Mel Blanc, Verna Felton and even silent film star H.B. Warner.

Special mention is due to great studio singer Gloria Wood, who provides the vocal jazz scats used in the early theme songs and as incidental music. Wood was a member of the famed Modernaires, sang on the Bing Crosby Show, made the hit record of The Woody Woodpecker Song with Kay Kyser, voiced numerous cartoons and cut records for Disney. Maynard casually drops Wood's name in the episode The Big Question.

The format of the show changed itself frequently to avoid becoming stale. Dobie and Maynard would occasionally appear as recruits in the reserves. Occasionally, the show would delve into fantasy in the Disney wacky comedy vein. Somehow it worked and the clever wordplay was the hallmark.

Extras abound on the complete set, some thanks to Stu Shostak of stusshow.com, where you can download several hours of audio programming featuring Dobie cast interviews not available anywhere else. The neatest extra to me was a Coca-Cola music special in which Hickman and Denver introduce Annette (even though we don't get to see her).",1392163200,4,5148,4.8

5692398,5,B00C7A8WWO,"On the television screens in America in 1959, a harried grocery store owner shouts out at his son's cavalier leave from their home with the SHOUT!, ""I've gotta kill that boy!""

And we're a long ways from the 1950s sit-com world of Leave It to Beaver or Father Knows Best or The Donna Reed Show.

SHOUT! Factory has made Max Shulman's Dobie Gillis series, starring Dwayne Hickman, available on DVD. It was one of those TV series that fans thought would not be released. The Max Shulman Estate had not approved of it, and many pundits thought it unlikely. And then suddenly, not one episode, not one season, but virtually all of Dobie was available!

I  like the fact that SHOUT! releases classic TV Series like Dobie as complete sets, all the seasons collected in one brightly designed box, and the company actually has begun practicing a reverse approach to the more or less established way of selling an individual season, seeing how the show does before committing to putting another season out for the collectors. If you love a series, and you want every season, there's a cliff-hanger element added, because, Hey! You never know if the company will continue or just abruptly abandon it. The question can linger for months, even years, if the show will ever be available in its entirety on DVD.

As a storyteller I also love that being able to view every episode over a passage of time means that I can see how a series like Dobie evolves, from conception and then from season to season. In this set you really can discover the shifting in tone in Dobie Gillis. I would have sworn before viewing these in this newly released DVD set that Dobie's father's angry/energetic/exasperated/sometimes a forlorn lament: ""I gotta kill that boy!"" ran through the course of all four seasons of Dobie, but it doesn't. He only pitches the line at the departing Dobie in the first season.

I suspect, as iconic as the line became for the series, someone behind the scenes decided that it was too harsh a litany to use week after week, from a father to a son, and that Herbert D. Gillis had to be mellowed down a bit, and their familial relationship not as dysfunctional.

See, you could not realize that if you only had the first season.

Or watch a performer come in for what may have been a one-shot episode, and so captured the writers and/or producers and/or the audience that half a season later that person becomes a full-fledged member of the supporting cast.

5692406,5,B00C7A8WWO,"When I heard that Shout! Factory was releasing Dobie Gillis, I was excited. When it was first shown on CBS, I wasn't allowed to watch it because it was past my bedtime. It wasn't until many years later when CBS put the reruns on in the afternoon that I saw it. It became my favorite show. I also watched it when it ran on Nick at Nite. After that, I didn't see it for years. I watched the first disc last night, and it brought me back to that time.

If I have any complaints at all, it would be the bonus features. I would have rather have seen ""Whatever Happened to Dobie Gillis"" (1977) and ""Bring Me The Head Of Dobie Gillis (1988) instead of Love That Bob and The Stu Erwin Show.

It's a real treat to see these funny, intelligently written, and well-acted episodes after so many years.  They're as good as I remember.  No disappointment there.

My only criticism is that the soundtrack fluctuates (rises) whenever the audience laughs or musical interludes are played.  This is a common occurrence with some movie musicals broadcast on TV.  I don't know why the volume couldn't have been adjusted when these DVDs were produced.  Seems to me background sounds should be muted, not louder than the actual program.

I think the show peaked in season 3, but went off into a strange surreal bent in season 4.

We all know that Dobie Gillis was one of the all-time best sitcoms on tv and fans have eagerly awaited it's release on dvd. That said, what in the world is going on with this complete series set? First, $139.99 list is an outrageous price for only a four season set. I believe it was originally up for pre-order at $87.95 or something. However, many buyers were hesitant to order...and with good reason. Why? Look at the product details. This show was produced at 1:33 aspect ratio. Yet, it's listed on Amazon as both full screen and widescreen with an aspect ratio of 1:85. Did Shout Factory chop the top and bottom portion to give the show the illusion of being widescreen? The set was scheduled to be released on 7-2-13. Very soon after that date, Amazon pulled the set, without any explanation as to why. Is there something wrong with the packaging or the set itself? I think we deserve to know. Several weeks later, the set reappeared on Amazon with an elevated price and the notation that it ""usually ships within one to three weeks?"" Now, it no longer has the notation ""ships from and sold by Amazon"" on the face page? Is Amazon no longer selling it? Why? As for myself, would I like to have this set? Yes. Will I purchase it? Not until it comes down to the $85 to $95 price range. When will I purchase it?

It's television history. Note: Zelda was an attorney in LA. My favorite episode among others is Maynard's giant chicken in Dobie's basement. I never laughed so hard. I bought the set and I love it. Chatsworth Osborne Jr. III is a ""Nasty boy."" Zelda's crinkle nose and Dobie's reaction. ""I gotta kill that boy, I just gotta."" Dobie's brother played by his real life brother Darryl.

5692419,4,B00C7A8WWO,"I have been watching Dobie Gillis reruns for 30 years, back when the old CBN cable channel had it on in the early 1980's and many channels since then. It has been one of my personal ""most wanted"" series to be officially released on DVD for a long time. So I was very happy to finally have an official release of the entire series, which I received a few days ago. The picture quality is great and all the shows appear to be uncut from the ones I've watched and a handful of others I just scanned.

 My main disappointment I guess is what I ultimately look at as a missed opportunity by Shout Factory with bonus features. You're only going to do a complete series set once, right? Why not include the 1977 reunion show done as a pilot for a new Dobie series? What about including the 1988 reunion movie Bring Me The Head Of Dobie Gillis, and any of the multiple interviews done at the time promoting that movie. The cast even appeared on the game show Win, Lose, or Draw for a few days to promote the movie. I was fortunate enough to record a lot of these things myself, but the picture quality of my 25 year old VHS tapes can't compare to a master studio recording. The Dwayne Hickman interview is only about 12 minutes, seems like it should have been much longer. Why couldn't they have interviewed Sheila James or William Schallert? I'm guessing that Warren Beatty and Tuesday Weld probably wouldn't cooperate, but there are many other actors still around that appeared on the show and it just seems like they missed the chance to do more. Even a couple of shows with commentary tracks as an option would have been nice.

I think it would have been nice to include any of these things instead of a few episodes of The Bob Cummings Show and one Trouble With Father episode.  No booklet of any kind either, so that's a shame, would be nice to have at least a simple breakdown of which episodes are on which discs without having to remove the discs from their cases, but I'm quite thrilled to have the uncut episodes in great quality, but it seems to me if you're doing a set like this, then do it right.

Bottom line is that I still highly recommend this set, The most important thing is the shows themselves, uncut, looking great, and I can't wait to sit down and start watching them all over again from the beginning.

So far, I have watched eight episodes, including ""The Beast with Twenty Fingers,"" ""Love is a Science,"" ""and ""Maynard's Farewell to the Troops.""  All episodes that I have watched run over 25 minutes and appear to be completely uncut.  The video and audio has certainly been restored for this release.  The video is sharp and clean, with only minor scratches and specks here and there.  The video of the end credits was not cleaned up, and you can really tell the difference between the unrestored video of the credits and the pristine presentation of the episodes.  The audio is surprisingly clear, with no noticeable background hiss.  From what I have seen so far, Shout! Factory has done an excellent job with these episodes, and fans should be very pleased.

The 21st disc is all special features.  The best part of this disc is the complete, restored, 30 minute pilot version of ""Caper at the Bijou,"" featuring Dwayne Hickman's pitch to the network executives at the end.  There is also a five minute clip of ""The Coke Time Special"" from 1960 featuring Bob Denver as Maynard G Krebs.  Another great surprise is a 6 minute color Dobie skit from The Dinah Shore Chevy show with a brief cameo by George Burns (no appearance by Maynard, unfortunately.)  In addition, you will find 3 unrestored episodes of ""Love that Bob"" featuring Dwayne Hickman and one episode of ""The Stu Irwin Show"" from 1954 featuring Sheila James.  This disc also has a DVD-Rom feature containing PDF files of 3 Dobie scripts and the shooting script of the ""Zelda"" spinoff attempt.  The disc even contains a new 13 minute interview with Dwayne.

5692421,4,B00C7A8WWO,"THE MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS

Based on creator MAX SHULMAN's series of short stories, this cerebral, fast paced sitcom starred DWAYNE HICKMAN as high schooler DOBIE GILLIS. The amiable character regularly dispensed philosophy and plot lines before a statue of ""The Thinker"", while pining for fame, fortune and ""the right girl"". DOBIE's best buddy was work-shirking, clueless, jive talking beatnik MAYNARD G. KREBS, memorably portrayed by a goatee-wearing pre-""GILLIGAN"" BOB DENVER; future film stars WARREN BEATTY and TUESDAY WELD also got their start here. Other unforgettable regulars included GILLIS' blustery, grocery store owning father (""I've gotta kill that boy!""), his sensible, doting mom (""...now Herbert!"") and brainy plain-jane ZELDA, who only had eyes and a ""wrinkled nose"" for her man DOBIE. Boasting a jazzy score, colorful characters with funky names, and tight ensemble acting, DOBIE GILLIS was as hip and eclectic as teen sitcoms ever got in the early sixties.",1369353600,4,980,5.490066225165563

I hope Shout was able to find the censored episode ""Almost a Father"" which was pulled from broadcast at the last minute and replaced later in the season with ""Rock-a-bye Dobie."" The suggestion that Dobie might have had a baby out-of-wedlock undoubtedly freaked some of the affiliates. The Kennedy-Nixon election episode (where Maynard was going to guess the winner) was pulled from syndication after Kennedy's assassination, but has since reappeared on some TV stations. Those are the two rarest episodes, with the former having never been released. I'm assuming the original version of the pilot episode will be included in which Yvonne Craig made yet another appearance on the series. Other than regular cast members Tuesday Weld and Sheila James, Craig was the most frequently seen girlfriend (playing a different girl each time), with six appearances including the pilot. This is one terrific series, quite unlike anything before or since. I've already pre-ordered my set. (Added note: Yvonne Craig was not actually ""in"" the pilot episode. She was seen in a bumper shot of several admiring girls. This film was used to sell the series and the bumpers were not included in the episode when it aired.)",1366848000,90,1436,4.865306122448979

Separately, I cannot wait for this to be released.  I'm a fan of nearly 50 years.  But I may not purchase this one from Amazon.  My 5-star rating is for Dobie and what I anticipate to be highest quality from Shout! Factory.

Update (6.15.13).  Still annoyed about the price rise from the original $97 listing.  Shop around.  I've found a number of reputable companies with pre-orders, free-shipping and quality packaging at that mid-$90 level.  Just placed my order elsewhere.  Sorry, Amazon:  not at this asking price.

======

Update (7.13.13).  I'm wondering why Amazon pulled this from direct sales.  It seems to be sold out in many places now.  But I'm wondering if the withdrawal has to do with the quality of the release.  I'm still so glad this is out and that I have a set, but I've reduced my rating from 5 to 4 stars.  This is a disappointing release from Shout!  The transfer quality varies widely due to source material, which should have been disclosed in my opinion.  I still would have purchased this anyway, without a doubt.  I've skimmed the first discs in each series year.  Many of the transfers appear to be from previous video syndications.  You can actually see the remnants of video interlacing in brighter scenes.  Many end credits are two or more generations removed from the original.  And then there are some individual episodes that are clearly new transfers from existing film prints (not negatives).  I also wish there were more extras.  I recall, for example, watching Dobie circa 1980 as broadcast from what was then WBTB-TV (68) Newark, and I recall seeing at least one original sponsor commercial (Polaroid).  On balance, I'm glad this is out, that I have a copy, and I'll surely enjoy it all.  But it is disappointing nevertheless.  I expect much, much better from Shout! - and at a more reasonable cost given the compromises made in source materials (for reasons unknown).  A pity.
