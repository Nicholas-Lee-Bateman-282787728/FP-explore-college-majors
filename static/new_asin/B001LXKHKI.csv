8320077,1,B001LXKHKI,"Just look at some of the reviews for this or any of their other blu ray discs: about half are raves about how nice they sound....and the other half are from users complaining that the disc does not play in X player!

I've now tested several discs with the latest firmware, and they are indeed garbage.  Amazon should pull all of the product from this company.  Why would anyone want to deal with a company whose product only works in about 50% of players?  I've never seen something so ridiculous or shoddy in my 10+ years of purchasing discs from hundreds of manufacturers.

BEWARE: DO NOT PURCHASE ANY PRODUCT FROM THIS COMPANY!",1277510400,,630,4.589285714285714
8320078,1,B001LXKHKI,"I bought three of this company's Blu-rays ... save your money and get the CD. Better yet, get an SACD version for real high-quality sound. I have ""Tchaikovsky Piano Concertos Nos. 1 & 3,"" ""Bach Orchestral Suites No. 1, 2 & 3,"" and ""Vivaldi Four Seasons"" in these discs. None will play in my Samsung Blu-ray player with the latest firmware. All play in my Panasonic. The sound quality is no better than standard quality 5.1 surround; in fact, I suspect they just copied the material from a standard 5.1 version. There's very little sound in the rear channels and virtually no separation. Sounds like stereo. Save your money, these are a rip-off.",1238025600,,644,4.707964601769912
