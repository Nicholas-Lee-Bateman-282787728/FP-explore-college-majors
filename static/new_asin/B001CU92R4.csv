3520186,4,B001CU92R4,"This is an interesting and very factual history of the beginnings of photography and its development. It starts with Niepce and his first known photograph in 1826. It describes how he researched and pioneered the process. He was followed by DaGuerre and Henry Fox Talbot who expanded the technical knowledge and marketed photography. The first war photography was in the Crimean war and later Mathew Brady became Americas most important war photographer in our civil war. The marketing and research and discoveries of George Eastman is explained. Eastmans discovery of roll film and small easy to use personal cameras was hugely successful and made him very rich. The development of color photography is visited. If you have an interest in early photography and the history of photography, this will be interesting to you. This DVD stops short of digital and modern photography.",1383955200,,878,5.190140845070423

3520188,5,B001CU92R4,"I use this in my (college) photography classes.  Good visuals and interestingly written. It humanizes some of the historical figures in a way that it is hard to do in a textbook.  No info about the digital age, which is unfortunate, but what it does, it does very well.",1365120000,2,269,4.469387755102041

3520190,5,B001CU92R4,"I was looking for a decent documentary on the history and early developments of photography. This one has been very interesting and informative for me being an amateur photographer. I learned that there were many events previous to Daguerre's success that let to his triumph as important as his but less credited. For sure this is not a complete and very in depth of the whole history of photography but is mostly focused on its beginnings. It exceeded my expectations.

If you are curious as to how early photography came into existence this is it. Not boring as someone else mentioned at least to me.",1353801600,4,602,4.733333333333333

It is a bit oldfashioned, but very comprehensive.  It does not cover any comtemporary trends, but is good as an introduction.  Because it is nice and short, I found it irreplaceable for showing in classroom.",1296777600,5,335,4.724137931034483

3520194,5,B001CU92R4,"Silver has the highest sheen and conductivity of any metal.  ""Silver Mines"" reviews both underground and open-pit silver mining, as well as providing historical information.

The ""Lucky Friday"" underground mine in Northern Idaho descends 6,200 feet and has been operating since the 1940s.  It contains 20 miles of tunnels, some stretching out for a mile and 12' wide and 16' high.  It is dark, wet, warm (120 degrees w/o cooling, 82 degrees with), and loud (sound of echoing machinery).  The hoist lifts miners in/out at 1,500'/minute; maintenance sections exist at each level.  Most areas are lit only by miners' cap lights and machinery headlights  Its ore yields 15 oz. of silver for every ton, as well as lead and zinc.

Blast holes are drilled 8' deep in the falls, while 4' bolts are used to hold up the sides afterwards.  Sixteen-ton trucks transfer the ore to the hoist and its ten-ton loads to the top.  Lacking an overall communication system, a stench-producing chemical is poured into the ventilation system to warn miners of emergencies.

Processing underground ore begins at the crushing plant - crushers and a ball mill create a slurry which in which the desired metals are then frothed to the surface, scraped off, and dried, before shipment to a refinery in Canada.

Viewers then see photos of the Comstock silver mine in Western Nevada, and realize the enormous manual labor required then.  Miners could only work a few minutes each hour because of the heat.  Fire, dust from the air drills causing miner's consumption, and burns from scalding water generated by small volcanic vents presented major hazards.  Enormous amounts of wood were used in stabilizing the underground walls.

Open pit silver mining is displayed at the Rochester mine near Lovelock, NV.  Lower grade ore is processed via leaching; the higher grade ore is also leached after going through a crusher.  This mine was closed in 2006, and the entire area (except the pit) is being reclaimed with natural vegetation.

The final segment of ""Silver Mines"" covers testing robotic underground loaders in Australia.",1222732800,4,2096,5.040697674418604
