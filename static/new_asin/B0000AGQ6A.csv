1905817,5,B0000AGQ6A,"I have some of Anodea Judith's other works. I expected this to be very good. It has surpassed my wildest expectations & leaves me at a loss for words. The visuals, the sounds, the feelings, the information are all of the highest quality. It is without doubt a work of superb magnificence. Judith & her colleagues are masters of their art. I highly recommend this to anyone who is serious about their search for higher consciousness.",1088035200,22,432,4.697368421052632
1905818,5,B0000AGQ6A,"This is an awesome video!  As a student and teacher of yoga, I recommend it with excitement and enthusiasm.  I have been impressed by Anodea's knowledge of the chakras in her books, but here she has brought the depth of her understanding to life in a way that blows the mind.  She dazzles and informs by transmitting straight through the analytical mind via the senses and the heart to the deeper places of knowing.  The visions, music and words moved me, awakened me energetically and emotionally, flowing through me from root to crown.  The experience is both visceral and ethereal.  Quite an accomplishment!  The images are stunning and original.  The experience of both (thank you) soundtracks is hypnotic, capturing effectively the vibrational quality of each chakra.  I know this review sounds unbelievable, but I encourage you to check it out for yourself.  In my opinion, this beautiful and unique DVD is a must-have for anyone interested in the inter-relationship of mind, body and spirit.",1068940800,182,998,5.030487804878049
1905819,5,B0000AGQ6A,"I've known about the chakras for 25 years, but what did I really know about them?  It's one thing to read about something and it's quite another to experience it.  Viewing Anodea Judith's video is a totally sensual experience.  It's like accepting an invitation to go right inside your body with 3-D, no, more like 7-D, glasses and SEE what your chakras FEEL like, or maybe FEEL what they SEE like.  It was truly like a journey to another world until I realized that the world I was exploring was ME.
Alex Wayne's art is astonishing.  It makes you wonder how he got all that computer equipment inside the human body!  And Anodea's writing is sheer poetry of the spirit.  This video is a work of art, but it's more than that.  It takes you deep into an individual experience and when you come out you are more than you were when you went in; you feel alive and glowing with new wisdom.  That's a real gift.",1067126400,45,905,4.37125748502994

1905828,5,B0000AGQ6A,I love Anodea Judith's Chakra Balancing CD's which are great meditative tools.  Before I do the yoga in those CDs I now have this wonderful DVD to watch as an aid to meditation.  It fills my mind with awesome images for me to imagine as I do the Chakra Balancing yoga in her CD set.  Her voice is warm and friendly and the images are mystically amazing!,1347408000,,353,4.2388059701492535
1905829,5,B0000AGQ6A,Beautiful imagery.  Tranquil music and guided meditation.  Informative and peace inducing.

1905832,4,B0000AGQ6A,This is a very good DVD if you are learing about the Chakras. Visually it's messmerizing. The only thing I didn't like is the music on DVD is louder than the women speaking so you have to turn the volumn up pretty high to hear what she is saying. You can understand her but would have been much better if you could have heard what she is saying clear.,1281484800,2,351,4.101449275362318

1905838,2,B0000AGQ6A,"I had high expectations for this movie, because it seems like combining meditative music, hypnotic voiceover guidance, and 3d visualizations was a no brainer for a journey through the body's subtle energy systems.  Unfortunately, the producer of this video cut corners on some of the animations, so while there are quite a few good ones there are enough really hokey spots that it distracts you from the journey.

Worse still, the same lady, Anodea, decided that she should narrate this video.  HUGE mistake!  Her voice is not remotely relaxing, it sounds like a 50-something ex-valley girl reading  her favorite passages from the Celestine Prophecy.  They would have done better to have one of her gurus or swamis narrate it, at least then it would have had a shred of authority and credibility.

Watching this movie just made me want to go and remake it with a capable narrator and quality animations.",1244160000,9,903,4.940397350993377

1905841,5,B0000AGQ6A,"Stunning visuals and hypnotic soundtrack.  There are some gorgeous vocals on there.
One has a choice of a narration in multiple languages or just the musical accompaniment.
I choose the music only option and play it over and over.
Makes for a gorgeous and meaningful ambient DVD.
Only thing I wish was that the default was music only, so that I did not have to reset it everytime I play it, and also that it would have a loop option so that it would just automatically start over again after it finished.
If you like this kind of stuff, I would also highly recommend ""Illuminated Manuscripts"" by John Banks and ""Ritual Path"".  Both stunning ambient DVDs with nice sound tracks.
Plus, it turns my 52"" Bravia into a gorgeous moving picture screen rather than just a big black monolith that just sits there (since I'm not much of a TV or movie viewer).
I would rather have kids be enchanted and hypnotized by these visuals and images than the crap that's on TV.
Worthwhile to purchase since you'll want to play it many times over.",1242000000,3,1027,4.545945945945946

It takes less than 30 minutes to watch, and is best used as a simple explanation or introduction to anyone who is not familiar with, or has ever heard of a chakra.  This is in no way a meditation video, and is informational only.  It would be a good video to loan to a friend who happened to ask ""a shock...what?"" or for instructors to give their students as introductory material.  The imagery is very creative and vivid, and the music is pleasant and appropriate.",1218585600,4,575,4.509615384615385
1905845,5,B0000AGQ6A,"Dear Anodea: I just finished watching your ILLUMINATED CHAKRAS DVD and, I must say, it brought tears of happiness to my eyes. The material, your voice and the visuals are absolutely superb. Simply watching it is an empowering meditation. Thank you so much for sharing your ""wisdom"" with the rest of the world, and I just wanted you to know, that even though we've never met, I am very PROUD of what you're doing.

My skin is still tingling with energy and my eyes are watery. I feel a sense of excitement, hope and unlimited potential. How inspiring! If this were a group, I would be asking: ""where do I sign up?"" (ha, ha, ha). :D This DVD is simply fantastic. Please do extend my congratulations to the amazing artists who collaborated with you to make it all marvelously possible.

1905846,2,B0000AGQ6A,"I bought this DVD to work with my chackras more,  It was a short video, and I agree with the other raters that said it wasn't calming.  It had images that not only did not fit with my perception of certain chackras which I can totally look past, but it was projected in clips that were like 2 minute commercials on each chackra.  It was fast chatty and not something I would want to use as a meditation tool and in the year I owned it I watched it once.  It doesn't seem to be developed as a meditation tool or for a deep introspection tool, but rather a simple introduction.  This might be good conversation starter in a group session, introduction, even for someone who just wants to see a lot of colors and explore the body more.",1197158400,3,732,4.237410071942446
1905847,4,B0000AGQ6A,"As someone who is fairly new to Chakra work, I found this DVD a fabulous bridge between reading a book and truly feeling or seeing whats going on energetically. I originally only rated this 4 stars as I thought the sound quality was poor but it turned out to be my DVD player.  The 3-D visuals are a delight to watch over and over again.  One great plus I enjoyed was the sparkling holographic image she showed of the brain near the end. Absolutely stunning. 5 Stars! If you get this DVD, definitely get her book ""Wheels of Life"" as well. It will keep you busy with energy work for years. ""The Chakra Handbook"" by Baginski is also fabulous!  I wish I could form a Reiki club here in South Florida. It is probably much more effective to do energy work with others as the energy of the group expands exponentially.",1195776000,4,812,4.364238410596027

The superb Computer graphics and visionary art are exceptionally well done, it is a true delight to watch what unfolds before ones eyes as the viewer is lulled into a world of energy and knowledge only those previously initiated into the art of Yoga had prior access to.

The narrative is a comprehensive guide to understanding the Chakras, their purpose and effect.

The sound effects and background music are hypnotically powerful adding dramatic purpose to the narrative and visual feast unfolding before the viewer.

This DVD is only 25 minutes long but don't be putoff by its short duration, it is a powerful video well worth getting.

I've never before seen anything quite like this before, it hits the spot and puts you in a trance of relaxed learning, those 25mins are truly splendid and powerful!

1905854,3,B0000AGQ6A,"Anodea Judith reads prose in a flat toneless voice. The graphics are wonderful, but as for the Kundalini experience or a great colour meditation, I think it lacks. Why? The colour of the chakras is only strong and consistent in two of the chakras (the solar plexus and its yellow graphic images, and the throat with its blue graphics). The rest of the chakras are depicted in a whirl of various colours that take away from the immersion in colour that a good open eyed colour meditation can provide. Shirley Mclaine's (circa 1990) open eyed colour meditation comes to mind as a great example with a mind altering after effect.
This DVD seems to be more of a basic introduction to the chakras than a useful tool to use repeatedly.",1184371200,4,729,4.615384615384615

YOU do NOT have to be a BELIEVER in CHAKRAS or NEW AGE
SPIRITUALITY in order to ENJOY this DVD!

This DVD easily doubles as a long form Music-Video for non-believers.

The program is divided into 7 different chapters of computer animation,
each intending to visually represent the 7 Chakras of the body.
The imagery is vivid and colorful and often hypnotic.

Each chapter is accompanied by a soundtrack of new-age electronica music.
The style is very remenicent of ENIGMA and DEEP FOREST. Sometimes soft
and soothing, sometimes rythmic and somewhat dancable.

Each chapter is also accompanied by a female voice reciting a guided
 meditation for each Chakra. You can choose to hear the narration in
 several different languages. Those who are put off by New Age dogma
can easily enjoy the music and visuals with French or Italian narration.

OR you can TURN the narration OFF and simply enjoy the DVD
as a long-form music video of computer animation. This would be
perfect to have playing on TV during a party or social-gathering.
I sometimes have it playing on TV while I read or clean the house.

I find the versatility of this DVD's format very appealing.
It can be used for Meditation or simply enjoyed as Art.
Actual belief in Chakras or New Age philosophy is not required.

Anodea presents the viewer with one delicious visual after another, while explaining in exquisite detail, the specifics of each spinning chakra.  Robin Silver's music is coordinated each step of the way and is really a musical delight, synchronizing so perfectly with all of the amazing visuals illuminating the senses.

Renowned teacher of the human energy system, Anodea Judith has teamed up with Alex Wayne (digital art) and Robin Silver (music) to create a stunning visual and audio journey through the ""wheels of life"" in The Illuminated Chakras: A Visionary Voyage into Your Inner World.

Along the spine, seven vortices correspond to elements, body parts, and life situations. According to Judith, these spinning centers-known as chakras-are seven layers of manifestation that form a rainbow bridge between Father Sky and Mother Earth. This bridge serves as stepping-stones from matter to spirit. The spinning of the chakras come from two basic currents: one from above and one from below. As these currents weave through the chakras, the cause them to spin like gears-moving us through our life journey.

The Illuminated Chakras is a fantastic 30-minute DVD that makes it possible to see and experience the subtle energy of the chakra system. To my knowledge, this type of visionary voyage has not been done before.  Anodea Judith narrates, explaining the nuance of each chakra, including the Sanskrit names, colors, associated elements, and their roles in our lives. The gorgeous music reflects the energy of each chakra. For example, the music of the second (sacral) chakra is watery and sensual, while insistent bongos and upbeat tempos match the fiery energy of the third (solar plexus) chakra.

The vibrant images further illustrate the purpose of the chakras. A meditating woman made of wood reflects the first (Root) chakra connection to mother earth and the material world; for the proper energetic foundation, we need roots deep into the earth. A beautiful blue sky with a heart-shaped cloud reminds us of the spaciousness of the sky-the element of air-from which wings of love soar from the open heart of the fourth chakra.

I've worked with chakras for about 5 years now (in fact, I've written an eBook and several articles on them), and yet, I found new ways of looking at these amazing energy centers from watching The Illuminated Chakras DVD. It is truly a ""moving"" meditation of sound and sight.",1144281600,16,2337,5.169312169312169

The DVD has 2 audio tracks that allow you to listen to the author guide you through the process and another soundtrack with just the music. The visuals are vivid and breathtaking. It's well worth the money. Is the length too short. NO! It's just right for its purpose. That purpose is to help the seeker to engage the Kundalini to it's maximum potential. I don't see it designed to teach the chakras in great depth. There are other books for that. However, she does give enough information to get a very good understanding of the chakras.

I'm glad I bought it.,1132790400,16,364,4.5
1905866,3,B0000AGQ6A,"This video is, without a doubt a stunning piece of visual work. This really does make for an excellent way to introduce the chakras to someone who has never before encountered the subject. Which, of course, is the purpose of this video. In this it succeeds.

The only problem I have is justifying the price. There is very little information given and the video is very short (20 min run time). Had I purchased this video instead of just renting it, I would definitely feel ripped off and this would quite possibly be a 1 star review.

...On the other hand, if I were still into psychedelics, this would be a five star review.",1114387200,49,625,4.473684210526316
1905867,3,B0000AGQ6A,"The only reason I gave this video 3 stars is because the artwork in the video is absolutely amazing.  With the potential to be an amazing video I feel that the lack of information about the chakras ruined this video.  If you are new to chakras and need to know the basics, then I would definately recommend this video to anyone.  However it seems the amount of information actually explaining the individual chakras can all be found on a free brochure from you local holistic living center or on the web.

  In a nutshell if you don't know anything about chakras and/or just want to see some amazing chakra artwork then definately buy this DVD.",1112918400,15,644,4.556521739130435
1905868,4,B0000AGQ6A,"I recommend this DVD for its artful treatment and good conceptual overview of the Chakra ?system?. To describe the 7 Chakras visually is a challenge and I cannot give high enough praise for the absolutely professional and wonderful graphics and work that went into this DVD.

 I also liked the textual desciptions accompanying the visuals, but have to shudder at the voice narration given by the author. This is not meant to detract from the material, but the talent and thought given to this DVD lies not in the ability to deliver a dramatic reading. Unfortunately, the default narration is supplemented by an option of poetry to music (a DVD audio option) which is even worse than the default narration. It surprises me that a successful practitioner and author of Chakra material has been allowed to produce and publish what is so obviously a flawed performance without trusted advisors pointing out the folly of the ""emporer's clothing.""

 However, I would still recommend this DVD for the art and graphics, the content itself and the thought and professional treatment of the material. If the narration were only more professional and did not detract from the other qualities, this would be absolutely stellar.",1090454400,72,1215,5.029850746268656
1905869,5,B0000AGQ6A,"This DVD is gloriously done! The combination of informatin, artwork, and music makes this the best meditative aid (and more) that I have ever seen. I highly recommend it to beginners and non-beginners alike.",1089244800,13,207,5.117647058823529
7997010,5,B0000AGQ6A,"I love watching & listening to this for relaxation, escape into lights & colors (and away from stressful media), and as a kind of bedtime story. I set the TV's sleep timer and fall asleep to it to replace my worry thoughts with healthier, happier visions. It's enchanting, and manages to be vivid and stimulating while also being soothing and hypnotic-feeling. It takes me on a little journey through my body and gives me time and pleasant guidance to reset and remind me of things that are important, and be more balanced.

I did not get this with any expectations for any level of high expertise in the subject or concerns about cultural misappropriation or anything but I'm sure criticisms could be made on both fronts, as with any western presentation of eastern bodies of knowledge. Having enjoyed this DVD repeatedly, I've found myself more familiar with chakra terminology, concepts and pronunciation though, so now when it comes up in other settings I have a foundation for better understanding. It seems like a great introductory journey, and delightful and soothing even if you aren't particularly interested in the subject matter. I wish more videos like this were produced - I love it! The only complaint I can come up with is the sexy/romance stuff is really heteronormative, but that's so common I'm only mentioning it as a warning for other people to prepare for that pinch of disappointment / feeling invisible. Fun, sparkly, entrancing & pleasurable!",1517443200,,1467,4.963414634146342
7997011,5,B0000AGQ6A,"A well designed program that has something to give to anyone no matter where they are on their path through this universe. We are actually carried on a meditation through the different chakras and more than just learning we are experiencing them.

Finally something that is not just in English French and Spanish options. We have music only after you have been introduced.

The author and orator is Anodea Judith, Ph. D. also author of several books including ""Wheels of Life"" and ""Eastern Body Western Mind.""

This is one of those presentations that can be repeated at the end or beginning of your day.",1507248000,3,603,4.778846153846154

7997014,5,B0000AGQ6A,this really helped me understand the chakras and visualize the energy involved. It is not for people who fear snakes because it uses that imagery. but I have no fear of snakes and found all the imagery uplifting/in powering.,1444348800,,224,4.769230769230769
