Loving on Kochikame and Ryotsu just like I did with vol 1. Like vol 1 showed you some of Ryotsu's youth(childhood, childhood friend and first starting off as a police officer), vol 2 covers some main characters that come up such as Nakagawa, Honda and Maria. Then there's that guy from episode 2 that reconnects with his long lost love (: I got the DVD today and watched it immediately when I finally got a moment and I loved it and I hope this seller also has vol 3 for order as well.

After vol 3 I'm not sure whether or not there is another DVD though but I did here about the kochikame revamp for the 40th anniversary so whatever is released for that I will be excited as well !!",1466208000,,826,4.098765432098766

It has a charming look about It.",1381795200,,119,4.0
