8490321,5,B0060ARPXO,"Once again, Helene Fischer at her best! Every concert she does is worth a second or third look! I recommend you buy this if you want to see and hear a truly fine singer giving her best and Blu-ray makes it even better! Note: You must have a multi-region DVD player to play this DVD.",1471651200,,282,4.1454545454545455

8490323,5,B0060ARPXO,"This was my introduction to Helene Fischer. I bought it for my parents who are German. I wasn't sure how much of it I would understand since I'm not bilingual. It made absolutely no difference in the end. The music was fantastic, her voice is incredible. I don't care what language you speak, if you like good music, you're going to love this DVD.",1424476800,,347,4.4375
8490324,5,B0060ARPXO,"Helene Fischer is the #1 pop singer in Germany.  She sings perfectly in German, Russian, and English.  She was born in Siberia, lived in the former East Germany and has already released her first English CD.  This concert is outstanding with 33 songs, a full orchestral backup, and outstanding choreography. If you purchase this DVD be mindful you will need a DVD player that will play the European PAL format, also known as Region-2 when reviewing DVD bluray specifications.  However, Helene Fischer's singing is outstanding and well worth the effort to purchase the DVD and playing it on the appropriate bluray DVD player.",1421884800,,624,5.029126213592233
