8471373,2,B005G7WGOA,"Dull - too little on airplanes and too much general Gulf War history.  While this is a good DVD for young adults who were not around during the Gulf War, I did not buy this for the history, but rather to see and hear the airplanes.",1422057600,,231,4.021739130434782

8471375,5,B005G7WGOA,"It is totally worth the money, it was exactly what I expected and was listed in the information regarding this DVD (product)! I'am ever now and then very disappointed because what is listed or advertised is completely false or inaccurate. You will be very please with this DVD or Blu-Ray (not sure it is available in Blu-Ray), most important you'll absolutely get what is advertised and it's very enjoyable and full of information regarding all the jets etc.........
Would recommend this product and the purchase through AMAZON to family and friends!",1374537600,,550,5.054945054945055
