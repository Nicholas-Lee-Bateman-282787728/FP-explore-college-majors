7975463,3,B00007ELG1,"This DVD largely consists of a taped lecture delivered by Andrews somewhere in the USA and sometime in - I believe - the late 1990s.  The lecture is supplemented by footage of many crop circles which date from both before and after the lecture.  In other words, the viewer must be careful to realize that much - but not all - of the crop circle footage was not part of Andrews' original presentation.  (This is particularly important concerning the  ""Oliver's Castle""  footage which purportedly shows the instantaneous formation of a crop circle by mysterious balls of light;  Andrews has made it clear that he believes this footage to be a hoax, but you would never know that from watching this video.)

The audio track on this video is mediocre  - a slightly tinny sound that you would expect from an amateur recording of a college lecture.  But it is nonetheless clear and intelligible.  Particularly on the question of hoaxing, the video does not represent Andrews' current views - he now concedes much more hoaxing, and high-quality hoaxing, than he was prepared to admit in this video.

This is not a ""must have"" presentation, but for those only slightly familiar with the crop circle phenomenon, it is a decent and inexpensive introduction.  I even found a few new things here - a few circles,  some of them very well done - that I had not previously seen.",1382140800,,1363,4.72457627118644
7975464,4,B00007ELG1,"I was hoping for an objective documentary to learn about crop circles. The marketing from Waterfall Home Entertainment is deceptive, they neglect to mention that this DVD is an old lecture by Colin Andrews, there are no other people interviewed.
I cannot tell how old this tape was, I am guessing 2000 or so.
Waterfall Home Entertainment does not volunteer any details on the front or back covers.
The recording quality is poor. The video is grainy, the audio is muffled. The collection of crop circle photographs are beautiful and intriguing. About 15 minutes into the lecture I became absorbed in the experiences of Mr. Andrews.
The DVD was worthwhile. It gave me a background on the crop circle investigation in the early years. It has prompted me to purchase Colin's recent book to get more details and up to date news.",1088553600,3,823,4.802816901408451
7975465,3,B00007ELG1,"This is not a documentary, this dvd is a lecture by Colin Andrews, leading expert in the crop circle field, who throughout the lecture gives us a history lesson on the phenomena. A few interesting stories are also told for the first time. There are hundreds of images and film footage shown throughout the lecture, this is a must for crop circle enthusiasts. This lecture looks like its from the late 90's. Very annoying that there is no mention on the back cover that this dvd is a lecture, Waterfall home entertainment, shame on you.
The transfer is very grainy when you see Colin in the lecture theatre, but when it switches to images or film footage, the transfer is very good. I think this is one of the reasons why there is so many photos of crop circles throughout this program. Audio is PCM stereo. Plain menu screen, extras, there is a photo gallery which has 39 photos of crop circles. Running time 64 minutes. Transfer 2/5, audio 3/5, extras 2/5.",1051401600,5,957,4.569767441860465
