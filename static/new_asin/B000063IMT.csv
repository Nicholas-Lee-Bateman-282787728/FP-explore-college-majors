7959155,1,B000063IMT,I cant believe you people give this a good rating. It sucks so bad it gives anime a bad name. If you like this show may god help you!,1180310400,,133,3.6206896551724137
7959156,5,B000063IMT,"When I first heard of Medabots i decided to give it a shot because it looked to me like a cool show. Boy was i right. After just watching the first episode i was hooked. I loved the whole idea of owning your very own medabot. Unlike pokemon where you have to collect like 500 different ANIMALS or Yugio where well, yugio ""is bad"". I thought it was cool how you could have your own bot that could communicate with you and relate with you with a personality of it's own. The transporting watches are cool too. Metabee cracks me up when ever he talks back to Ikki.
Although, Medabots is a exellent show. The rubberrobo gang is kind of a ... attempt at Team Rocket(Pokemon) and it's just kind of weird how the referee pops out of anywhere. Other than those few cons Medabots is a cool show. I bought this dvd because of the quality of this show and just the fact that it's so cool. And before you just automatically label this as a bad show give it a try. Watch it and i'm sure you'll get hooked. If not then, you still have lameass yugio, out of date pokemon, and real tired digimon to run back to.",1042675200,2,1095,4.194312796208531
7959157,5,B000063IMT,"Hello.  I am a 23-year-old and I really don't care when people always say stuff like: ""You're to old to be watching kiddie shows.""  Because most anime shows are not ""kiddie shows""  Sure at first glance it might seem a little childish.  But deeper down the episodes are funny, with lots of hilarious comments, they have a plot (which immediately seperates this and other anime shows from the ""kiddie"" selection).  As you watch more than you will see that the plot gets deeper.  There are mysteries within mysteries in Medabots.  As a side note I do not count Pokemon as an anime show because it has no plot, no humor, and the characters are all stupid.  I highly recommend this sow to viewers of ANY age.  And adults: next time you are surfing channels and you see an anime show (other than Pokemon) try watching it!  You could gain something out of it.  This message has been brought to you by Tagg.  A 23-year-old anime lover.",1039910400,3,927,4.518072289156627
7959158,5,B000063IMT,"OK, I might seem too mature for it, but MEDABOTS IS THE COOLEST SHOW EVER!(Yu-Gi-Oh season doesn't start til Fall...)",1029196800,,117,4.9
7959159,5,B000063IMT,"it's very good!
It takes place some time in the future,with battling robots called 'Medabots'.Everyone has a medabot,except Ikki. Ikki can't afford a medabot. One day,he finds a medabot medal. A gang of medabot thives attack! Ikki runs to the store to buy a medabot with all the money he has. He buys a KBT type(a beetle type medabot)and names him medabee. Ikki then saves the day!
Medabee is hillaious! He has a spunky additude and doesn't trust anyone. He has lots of funny lines like 'Kiss your bot goodbye!'and 'Dude,i rock'
You should really see this",1020297600,,555,4.731958762886598
7959160,3,B000063IMT,"After Watching ""Medabots"" On Foxkids Network I was getting pretty Interested in the show. After watching around 22 epsiodes the network was canceled and now showing repeats. The Show is about trainners and their robots challanging in arenas and collecting other bot parts when there done winning. It might seem like the best action anime show ever, but its not. With all of the fighting its still made for kids. Shows lack in intense fighting & Story line. If you are between the ages 6-12 you will enjoy this show...",1017532800,2,517,4.7555555555555555
