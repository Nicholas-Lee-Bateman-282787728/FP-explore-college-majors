2307547,5,B0009P42S2,"In Steamboy, Director Otomo turns his attention to the Steampunk genre, and the result is a gripping Victorian era techno-thriller. The macguffin of the plot is a ball that is supposedly able to store steam at enormous pressure and density. It doesn't make much sense, but it manages to drive a plot with a lot of action, engaging steam-puffing war machines, and some moderately sophisticated debate about the uses of science and technology.

The characters are engaging, although hero Ray is  the usual somewhat generic plucky adolescent. The spoiled adolescent aristocrat Scarlett is considerably more interesting, as are Ray's father and grandfather, who personify conflicting ideas about the uses of technology.

The animation is, of course, wonderful, as expected from the director of Akira. The film is full of strikingly original action scenes, which are both well conceived and well executed. Destruction abounds. Reputedly, the film used quite a bit of computer graphics, but it is extraordinarily well integrated. The hand-drawn characters do not have the ""pasted in"" look that has characterized most previous attempts to combine hand drawn and computer generated art, and I was hard put to tell where the traditional animation ended and the computer animation began.

The DVD includes both the original Japanese version (with English subtitles available) as well as an English dubbed version. The English dubbing is extremely well done, with top notch talent including Anna Paquin (Rogue from the XMen movies) as the adolescent boy hero, Patrick Stewart as his grandfather, and Alfred Molina as his father. The English dubbing was overseen by Otomo himself, and is arguably better suited to the story than the original Japanese, as it is set in Victorian England. There are, however, a few moments where the words do not quite mesh with the mouth movements--which is a bit of a testament to the quality of the animation; in most animated films, you can't tell what language the characters are supposed to be speaking, anyway.

Although this is an animated film, it is not a kid's movie, and some parents will probably find some scenes inappropriate for small children. There is a lot of violence and destruction, at least as much as in a typical theatrical action thriller, but relatively little gore or overt killing--less than in Akira. There is, however, a moment when young Scarlett comes face-to-face with a dead soldier. It is an important and necessary scene, but might be troubling to some children.",1122595200,27,2518,5.161764705882353

Hardy-Har!"" and so then when i went to see it, I was tottally ready to finger those critics. I loved it! So I bought the DVD 2day, and I loved it! IMO this is the best movie ever made!

STEAMIN' STORY: James Ray Steam is a son of an inventor, Edward Steam. They are both living in London right now, taking control of STEAM TOWER. Then, Ray visits this beautiful girl named Scarlett, who everyone treats royally. But then, Once ray learned that his grandfather has escaped, He dosen't know whether to trust his dad or grandpa!

THOUGHTS: WHY DOES EVERYONE HATE THIS????????????????HUH???? I LOVED IT!!!!!!! I thought this is the best movie EVER!!! Nothing stupid, It's all soooooo cool!

SO GO BUY IT!!",1122508800,3,793,4.570422535211268
2307549,5,B0009P42S2,"Steamboy is the latest entry into the Steampunk subgenre, speculative fiction that presents an alternate historical setting of the Victorian era in which modern technological advances were invented earlier in history through the assistance of steam-era technology. Early fiction like Jules Vernes' 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, William Gibson and Bruce Sterling's novel, The Difference Engine and Alan Moore's popular comic book, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen comic book are perhaps some of the best known examples of this subgenre. Gibson's Cyberpunk fiction had a profound influence on one of director Katsuhiro Otomo's previous anime movies, Akira, one of the greatest animated films ever made. Steamboy sees him influenced by Gibson's fiction again as he wrestles with some of the same themes, such as man vs. technology that he explored in Akira while maintaining the same level of quality animation.

Otomo's film explores the differing views of science. Ray's grandfather believes that only the fruits of advances in science should be available to the educated and the privileged while his father believes it should be shared with everyone as he says at one point, ""Science exists as a power to be used in reality."" He believes it should be used to improve all of humanity, not just a small portion of it.

Watching this movie only reinforces how bad The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen movie is compared to its original source material and the Steampunk genre in general. Steamboy is the real deal-a wonderfully nostalgic look at a bygone era mixed with a parable about the destructive nature of technology if put in the wrong hands and how it affects the relationship between a son and his father.

""Re-Voicing Steamboy"" takes a look at the Hollywood types who voiced the characters for the North American release. Anna Paquin, Alfred Molina and Patrick Stewart talk briefly about the film and their appreciation for Otomo with Stewart speaking the most eloquently about the time period that Steamboy is set in.

""Interview with Katsuhiro Otomo."" he started working on the project ten years ago with actual production on the film itself starting seven years ago. Otomo found that doing a period film was a bigger challenge and more time-consuming than a futuristic one like Akira.

""Multi-Screen Landscape Study"" is an interesting featurette on the set design and look of the film but conveyed via three split-screens that show clips from the movie, vintage newsreel footage of London and footage of the film's creators talking about their movie.

""The Adventure Continues"" allows you to watch the artwork on display during the end credits sequence without the text obscuring it.

""Animation Onion Skins"" allows you to watch several sequences in various stages of development, from rough pencil sketches to computer modeling to the final product. This gives some insight into how much work went into this movie.

Finally, there are ""Production Drawings,"" a montage of artwork for the film's setting that allows you to marvel once again at the attention to detail.",1122508800,4,3082,5.187122736418511
2307550,1,B0009P42S2,"What a steaming pile this was. I had the unfortunate opportunity to see this film in the theater and took it.  Katsuhiro Otomo has a fantastic reputation as an illustrator, author, and director.  However, this does not excuse him from the prolonged banality that is called STEAMBOY. Though there is stunning animation, that is no excuse for the shallow character development and weak plot that permeates this film.  Moreover, rampant explosions and wanton violence at the end (sorry for the spoiler, but AKIRA fans will know what I'm talking about) were not enough to erase the placid nothingness that forced this viewer to try and keep from nodding off for almost two hours.  I must make a point that I am a big fan of Otomo's comics and the film version of Akira.  Visually it lives up to his artistic reputation. Falling short doesn't even come close to describing how deep in the hole the rest of this movie has descended.",1120867200,9,926,4.726708074534161
2307551,1,B0009P42S2,"...what was the director (Katsuhiro tomo)thinking? I heard that this movie, in terms of animation, took TEN YEARS to complete. All I can say on that is, WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.

I don't know about the DVD version, as I watched this in the theatre, but one thing's for sure; I will NOT rent/buy this DVD; the movie hits an all-time low from the very beginning. Why couldn't they dub this film in English????? It's not very realistic, seeing a bunch of ENGLISH people in ENGLAND speaking JAPANESE!!! The plot seems to wander aimlessly round and round so much my head spins just thinking about it...until we meet our alleged heroine, Scarlett O'Hara (what are they trying to point out here? Or was her naming just an uncanny coincidence?)who shamelessly displays animal cruelty on her poor, helpless little chihuahua. Needless to say, I loathed her from the very beginning. Being a rich, spoilt brat, she did not warm my heart, failing to play the part of a ""heroine"". Plus, the relationship between Ray Steam (like the pun?) and Scarlett did not build: there was one point where they seemed to be a bit 'different' so to speak, and that, apart from wowing at the graphics, was probably the best part of the movie. Other that that, I came out of the theatre very irritated and almost deaf: the volume was insanely high...I couldn't even catch up on some sleep! Plus the movie didn't even have any worthy morals; they seemed to promote greed and lust for power.

To cut a long story short: Don't buy this movie unless you like pretty graphics (though not at all corresponding with the setting). Save your money, time and sanity!",1120521600,5,1622,4.648083623693379
2307552,4,B0009P42S2,"Background:

Steamboy is the first movie directed by a giant from Japanese anime Katsuhiro Otomo since his ground breaking movie Akira from 16 years ago. Unlike most anime fans I saw Steamboy before seeing its more famous partner. If you are expecting another Akira you will be disappointed since Steamboy is a 180 degree opposite in ambiance although both movies explore similar themes. Instead of Akira's dsytopic nihilistic Neo-Toyko Otomo re-creates a romantic optimistic Victorian England. Steamboy has the feel of a more mainstream Hollywood style action/adventure movie. Steamboy presents a fascinating intersection of history and sci-fi as its backdrop. The DVD is the director's cut with your choice of having the dialogue in English, Japanese and various Romance languages. Also, one can have subtitles in English, and the other languages.

Non-spoiler Plot:

Steamboy takes place in Victorian England in 1866. Although Otomo rewrites history by throwing in many elements not yet existing in 1866 but are from that overall period including Tower Bridge and battleships not built till the last decade of the 19th century. The movie is centered on the ownership of a Steam Ball which can generate the power equivalent to a small nuclear reactor. The movie, as typical in many Japanese anime and fantasy movies, centers on the issue of what is the proper use of this new breakthrough technology. This conflict is represented as an intergenerational conflict within the Steam family. The elder Steam, Lloyd (voiced by Patrick Stewart) has become deranged seeing his invention being put to what he sees as evil uses, his son Eddie (voiced by Alfred Molina), who is half man/machine, in a Nietzschian view sees the Steam Ball as a showcase of the power of science for science sake to push humankind to new heights. Eddie's 13 year old son Ray (voiced by Anna Paquin) is caught in the middle trying to save his father and grandfather and London from the consequences of their invention. A nefarious corporation, the O'Hara Foundation wants the Steam Ball, and the British are interested in acquiring it too sending Robert Stephenson, a tribute to the namesake who with his father invented the railway locomotive and built the first rail line from Liverpool to Manchester in 1830, to gain control of the Steam Ball for the sake of national security.

The movie spends the first part in Manchester and the surrounding countryside, including a panorama showing to borrow Dickens ""satanic mills"" dominating the city spewing black smoke into the air. The movie shifts to London centered on a park on the bank of the Thames. Otomo accurately animates the atmospheric effects of London's fog and smog. The park is home to the Crystal Palace, magnificently recreated in this anime movie, housing the Great Exhibition and the O'Hara Foundation Pavilion, using the design of Royal Albert Hall. [In history, the Crystal Palace, one of the great architectural achievements of the Victorian era, was built in 1851 to house the Great Exhibition of that year. The Great Exhibition in what might be considered the first World's Fair organized by Queen Victoria's consort Prince Albert the Exhibition invited all the nations of the world to showcase the technologies and applications that came about from the Industrial Revolution.]  The O'Hara Foundation sponsors the research of Eddie and Lloyd Steam that resulted in the invention of the Steam Ball. As we learn in the film the O'Hara Foundation has darker purposes for attending the Great Exposition besides showcasing the latest benevolent inventions. The titular representative of the O'Hara foundation is Scarlett O'Hara (voiced by anime regular Kari Wahlgren), around the same age as Ray, who is the sole heir to the O'Hara fortune. We immediately get the idea the Scarlett is a spoiled brat who complains about the smell and soot of London and enjoys bossing around the head of marketing for the O'Hara Corporation Archibald Simon. (PETA members might not like what she does to her poor Chihuahua Columbus). Although Scarlett is the one character who undergoes the most change as she sees the consequences of the her family's firm inventions. The movie is filled with action and adventure including chase scenes, and battle that breaks out at the area around the Crystal Palace where Otomo introduces many of the ""futuristic"" elements of the movie, and the reveling of Eddie's vision of science in the Steam Castle (Steam Tower in the english subtitles).

Analysis:

The main strength of this film is the gorgeous combination of traditional hand drawn 2-D and 3-D CGI animation. From what I have read, Otomo and his creative design team spent time on England, visiting London, Manchester and York, and studying steam locomotives and machinery from the Victorian era to beautifully recapture Victorian England, the motifs of that era, and the mechanical designs of the machinery down to the last rivet. For example, the Royal Navy ships in the movie are accurate recreations of real warships from the Victorian era. This research paid off in the stunning detail of the movie. You are starring at the screen just to soak up the details of the machinery Otomo created. I enjoyed how the movie used real historic events and places, mentioned above, as the backdrop for the movie. They showed great imagination in designing the ""futuristic"" elements which retains a 19th century appearance and mechanical design. Unlike other Japanese anime with their convoluted plot lines this is a straight forward action/adventure movie. The movie is dominated by browns and has a sepia tone to it. There are some wonderful animation effects including how lenses distort images, from what I understand this is a very difficult effect, to scenes with tons of falling confetti, to a scene where glass is shattered and on each chard you see an imprinted moving image from an earlier scene.

There is not much character development in this movie except for perhaps Scarlett. Most of the characters are representations of the different uses of science and technology. Eddie is the personification of science for science sake without any moral/ethical considerations. Lloyd takes the opposite view that science must be looked at in terms of the moral/ethical impact and science should be restricted if it leads to a ""bad"" outcome. Ray is caught in the middle conflicted about what he should do and shows concern for both his father and grandfather. His actions and decisions are based on what he learns about the motives of the characters and his underlying desire to save his father and grandfather. Robert Stephenson sees science as being used for national security reasons. Scarlett espouses the economic rationale for scientific advancement. Although the characters are not quite so black and white. Eddie is perhaps misguided but he is not evil personified. When one sees Lloyd's vision of the uses of science for frivolity you might find yourself believing his view is just as extreme as Eddie's but in the opposite direction. Scarlett has the obvious rich girl spoiled brat attitude but Otomo shows underlying this faade is a sensitive, and intelligent girl. Otomo has these characters espouse their beliefs explicitly in their dialogue which often become monologues and lectures.

Otomo uses the several characters to present different philosophies on the use of science but leaves it up to the viewer to make their own decision. The plot could used some improvement and the action can get a bit overwhelming at times. The machinery tends to overwhelm the story Otomo is trying to tell.

I very much enjoyed the classical soundtrack by Steven Jablonsky. He developed wonderful themes for Ray and Scarlett and utilizes them throughout the movie.

Overall, Steamboy should appeal to a both anime fans and a more conventional audience. This movie is far superior to Hollywood's recent attempt at Steampunk with Will Smith's Wild Wild West and Sean Connery's The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Time magazines Richard Corliss listed Steamboy, along with Akira, as one of the top 5 anime movies available on DVD. A side benefit of this movie is the educational opportunities this movie provides in further explorations of the Victorian era and the Industrial Revolution.

The movie is rated PG-13 for the action. The PG-13 is more to the PG side than R side. There is one scene with blood but there is no objectionable language or suggestive sexual scenes.

DVD Features: The transfer to DVD is excellent with great sound and picture quality. The aspect ratio was 1.85:1 so the transfer does not take full advantage of widescreen TVs, the wide screen version of Star Wars has an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The DVD features are pretty bland. There is no director's commentary which is understandable give the language barrier. There is a 5 minute interview with director Katsuhiro Otomo. There is a 15 minute featurette about the challenges of re-dubbing the movie in English with Anna Paquin, Alfred Molina, and Patrick Stewart. The 20 minute multi-screen landscape study splits the screen three ways. First there are scenes from the movie mixed with real life shots of London. 15 minutes of this featurette are interviews with the creative team discussing how they made the movie. The ending montage shows the images from the end credits of the English dubbed theatrical release without the text. Although this ending was a condensed version of the director's cut ending, which is the ending for the movie on this DVD. The production drawings are still shots of paintings used to develop ideas in the movie, some of which are pretty interesting. The animation onion skins shows the process by which five scenes are built combining hand drawn and CGI techniques although there is no dialogue explaining the process.",1118880000,43,9839,5.096153846153846

2307556,4,B0009P42S2,"Steamboat is a great quality anime full feature film that shouldn't be ignored. It is visually exciting and is filled with action and fast paced moving parts and machinery. The animation is far from being lazy when it involves cinematic entertainment.
I felt as if witnessing a feature delivering the likewise action stress of Lethal Weapon combined with the heroic efforts and time period of Rocket Man.
The setting and backdrop is very convincing.
Although, there's a questionable logic behind the function of machinery and may have many mechanics and engineers scratching their heads, but this is not a reason to shut off the dynamics of the overall plot.
This movie is focused on a general concern for humanity and the morale use of scientific power during birth of an industrial revolution.
Character development and the fleshing out of protagonists is rather slow at the beginning. As the story develops and becomes more action packed, the true colors emit from the characters and their intentions are becoming more apparent.
Over all it is a visually exciting animation with excellent production quality. I was not disappointed at all. Steamboy is worth adding to any anime collection.",1490140800,,1192,5.1179487179487175

2307566,4,B0009P42S2,"Steamboy is an anime movie from Katsuhiro Otomo, the same guy who directed Akira.  While this movie doesn't come close to living up to Akira's reputation, it is still a spectacle to behold in terms of its animation quality and art direction.  Where Akira was a cyberpunk film, Steamboy is steampunk and set in England during the height of the industrial revolution.  In fact, if you are a steampunk fan at all, then you will defiantly like this movie.  It's designs of steampunk style weaponry and vehicles are very creative and neat to watch.  I am rather surprised that ""steamboy"" isn't brought up that much whenever people talk about anime movies.  And I say that it's underrated for that very reason.  For starters, this is one of the most expensive anime films ever made with a production length of 10 years!  With that said, the animation quality is top notch(although for a film this expensive, you would expect it to be top quality).  The amount of work and attention to detail is amazing and makes the movie a must have for any fan of animation.  The story focuses on a young boy who's grandpa(played by Patric Stewart) has just invented a sort of ""steam ball"" contraption that can compress enough steam to power an entire city( which I guess makes sense).  Basically, the movie is the boy and his grandpa trying to get this steam ball from falling into the wrong hands.  amongst all of this, the movie brings up some interesting  questions on how far we should take science and at what cost for doing so.  The action is well done and very entertaining, and the movie's finally is as epic as ever.  The problem with this movie is its story and characters.  They arnt really that bad, just not really that good either.  The characters are very well drawn and animated, but just not all that interesting, especially the main boy character who just sort of comes off as ""meh, he's ok"".  It didn't ruin the movie or anything, but you do wish that they would some more defined character traits to them.  There is this pretty interesting character dynamic between the Father and the Grandpa characters(one of whom wants to bring about a new age of scientific innovation even if it means bringing about war and destroying most of England, while the other wants to stop him in favor of the safety of others).  This was actually one of the better parts of the movie.  It feels like the people who made this movie had so much that they wanted to show and tell, that things ultimately ended up feeling either rushed, or underdeveloped.  With all of that said, I do still hold that this is a great movie, and a spectacle to watch with great animation quality and very good art direction and designs.  If you like animated movies or if you like steampunk stuff, then this is definitely a good one to own.  Also, it's worth mentioning that unlike Akira, this is more of a family friendly movie that anyone of any age can enjoy.",1469577600,,2922,4.575

Beautifully made movie and if you don't get the fantastic and VERY funny use of names and other social references (the  spoiled rich girl being named Ms. Scarlett O'Hara) then go out and see more movies, or better, buy more from reviews here...",1378080000,,540,5.067415730337078
2307665,5,B0009P42S2,"To be honest, I planned to watch this on my computer. However considering I am a bit of a collector and had a psp I said ""why not"" and got the thing. The product looked great and though the case was pretty barebones in terms of paper, everything was quite mint. The umd came with all the standard features one would expect from a piece of media but I was pleasantly suprised to see that the movie also had the original japanese voice acting if one wanted it.

The movie itself was pretty interesting considering that is based in England which is not a common place in anime but I must tell the reader right now to watch the movie in English first since it fits in with the setting a lot better even if the voice acting isn't best (I'm not saying it isn't as it was pretty decent to my heres but there's always those nitpickers). I don't want to spoil anything about the plot or anything but it was well worth the price of about $5 and got me thinking at times. Looking back now, I do recall the ending having less oomph than the rest of the film especially since the end credits/epilogue needed a stronger knowledge of the background of the series/comic/whatever the movie was based upon.",1374969600,,1188,4.351351351351352

2307668,5,B0009P42S2,"Having adored Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira, and being that I am currently exploring the realms of Steampunk fiction, I'm glad I finally had a chance to see this film.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steamboy-Director-s-Cut/dp/B0009P42S2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steamboy: Director's Cut</a>&nbsp;is set in a unique offshoot of that science fiction-slash-fantasy genre-mashup known as Steampunk, which features late-eighteenth-to-early-nineteenth century industrial age mechanics, powered by steam-based systems in some alternate universe where steam has been made as potent as dynamite, and engineers have proven capable of building anything, no matter how impossibly large or complex.  It's an odd mix of the Industrial Revolution and Victorian morals and ideals with impossibly complex mechanical technology and a complete disdain for the natural limitations of matter, a romantic before-physics-and-fossil-fuels-ruined-everything kind of notion.  And right now, there seems to be one of those technological backlashes going on in the entertainment industry, resulting in a lot of magic, fantasy, and, well, this.  Whatcha gonna do?  You put on your aviator's jacket and goggles, wind up your pocket watch and go with it!

A PG-rated story--mainly for violence, which is mostly comic-book harmless but does show a bit of blood--Steamboy is a boy's adventure romp from beginning to end, with plenty of chase scenes, on-the-fly inventions and cool gadgets to help Ray out of each jam.  Steamboy uses a mixture of traditional and computer animation to take full advantage of the Steampunk genre.  The colossal engines, Victorian-era zeppelins, cobbled-together garage inventions and hybrid machine-bastards are the eye-candy of Steampunk, and nowhere have have I seen them better presented than in this production.  Every frame is gorgeous: The backgrounds, machines and action are so beautifully rendered as to elicit oooohs and ahhhhs from those anime fans out there.  I do find myself wishing animators would put as much work into the character's faces as they did their incredible machines and backgrounds... they all tend to be the very basic of caricatures, as is unfortunately typical of anime.  This complaint aside, it's hard not to love the look of this production.

In many ways, the movie reminds you of Akira, with its massive scales, world-shattering technologies and themes that make individuals seem as insignificant as ants.  And the ending of Steamboy is Akira-like in its constant escalation of technology-gone-wrong that impacts the very atmosphere around the juggernaut  known as the Steam Castle, and threatens to destroy Manchester, the historic Crystal Palace (early symbol of the Industrial Era that inspires Steampunk), the Queen and, ultimately, the very British Empire.

Like Akira, the ending just seems to keep going beyond the point where a more practical director would have said, ""Okay, enough already.""  Still, if you can forgive the animators' over-zealous efforts at the end, you'll find yourself exultant at how much fun Steampunk can be, in the right hands--the hands of the Japanese, apparently.",1374278400,,3169,5.76824034334764

The filmmakers succeed in making us see the huge, overwrought machines of the day as artifacts of futuristic science fiction.

It is a true anime (very artistic, character-driven, & detailed), with a pseudo-futurism twist.  I was surprised at the great character development and detailed story.  On the front cover James looks like some kind of mass-produced anime hero, but he is actually just a regular but intelligent person put in a difficult situation.  I actually got this movie sooner than other anime I wanted to check out, partly because of the cheaper price of Steamboy--it is probably only the name & cover that makes it seem less desirable--but also because though I knew Patrick Stewart's voice was in the English audio track, I later learned it also has Alfred Molina and Anna Paquin (default is Japanese, but English is available on the disc).

So let me just zero in on my personal experience: I loved the animation, especially with all the mechanical parts moving in every direction, but thought the movie was a bit longer than it needed to be. The story line could have been shorter, and more things explained about the relationship between father and son. Character development was a bit lacking (I still don't really know who the good guy was, or if there even was a bad guy, and the girl who was so mean and stupid at the beginning never really redeemed herself). That being said, if you like the genre, it is pretty cool. Don't expect historical accuracy either, as there are many anachronistic elements.",1339718400,,779,4.6521739130434785

Alas, no such luck.  I'm forced to agree with the several reviewers who wrote that the story alluded to in the drawings over which the End Credits ran (called ""The Adventure Continues"") looked like a much better (and potentially more entertaining) story than the one Mr. Otomo insisted on telling us.

Steamboy is certainly chock full of ideas, but they are all ideas that have been repeatedly expressed before.  Among these are many that nobody would dispute and thus hardly needs reminding of:

War is terrible.
Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
Technological advances (like EVERYTHING ELSE) can be misused.
The conduct of the Great European Powers in the generation prior to World War I was suicidally stupid, almost as suicidally stupid as was the conduct of Japanese militarists prior to World War II.

In addition to these Mr. Otomo tosses out a couple other ideas more easily disputed:

Capitalism is bad.  As compared to what?  There is a reason capitalist countries have to build walls to keep people out, communist countries have to build walls to keep people in, and socialist countries have to tear down their walls in order to deal with the fact that their socialized-into-uselessness citizens have lost, along with all other ambitions, the ambition to breed a new generation capable of funding their continued uselessness.

Designing, manufacturing, and selling arms is wrong.  That rather obviously depends on who you are selling them to and what they will be used for.  People who see no difference between arming dictators for conquest and arming democracies for self-defense and liberation of the conquered and enslaved are probably delusional about lots of other things as well.  Of course arms manufacturers selling advanced weapons indiscriminately to the highest bidder is arguably a bad idea, but since outside of fiction (where it has become a clich&eacute;) this doesn't actually happen, it's a moot point.  Strong governments, without which advanced arm manufacturers cannot exist, will not tolerate this sort of thing; anytime something like this is alleged to have happened in real life, you will invariably find that the controlling government at least tacitly approved,...

or somebody's going to be executed.

Why have I ignored the plot in my review thus far?  Well, Mr. Otomo doesn't deem it very important, so I don't see why I should.  Briefly, Ray Steam's (Yeesh, what a name!) father and grandfather have a disagreement over the proper use of a great scientific advancement, the steampunk equivalent of nuclear power, and though they never truly resolve it, they do manage to trash a large part of London debating it.  In the process Ray Steam manages to save the rest of London (Yay!) and the thoroughly obnoxious Scarlett O'Hara (a considerably less obviously good result).

The end.

IMHO Katsuhiro Otomo's brilliant artistic vision deserved a lot better than Katsuhiro Otomo's thoroughly inept plotting.  What a waste!",1318723200,2,3471,5.66023166023166

The English voices fit the characters pretty well, although you can't beat the original Japanese voice and reading the subtitles. The storyline was great and although it did feel a bit slow for the first half, this only made the second half race forward at break neck speed and add to the drama and action, which I can only guess was the intention. I agree that this is probably the most visually stunning animation outside of Ghibli films and the level of detail is simply breathtaking. The extras disc is great, with well over an hour of interviews and featurettes that give a great view on the animators, directors and voice stars opinions on this film, as well as providing information on animation layering and other techniques.

2307695,4,B0009P42S2,"Katsuhiro Otomo decided to go from cyberpunk with Akira to steampunk in this adventurous epic. The movie had the mild cost of over 25 million dollars, and was in production for well over a decade. Even though it didn't really make the kind of impact that Otomo's previous works did, it is still a compelling film.

Set in the 1860s, Ray Steam(yes, his last name is Steam!)is the prodigal son of the steamologist, Edward. Edward and his genius father Lloyd have spent the last few years developing a highly compressed form of energy in a containment called a Steamball. Lloyd sends it to Ray for safe keeping from the conniving O'Hara Foundation, of which Edward has alligned himself with. Ray eventually gets kidnapped by the O'Hara thugs, and confront his father, along with the very bratty Scarlett O'Hara. He makes of with the Steamball, and tries to seek help from Edward's rival, Robert Stephenson(based on the actual scientist). However, Stephenson wants to use it to fight Edward and the O'Hara Foundation who have created a giant steam-powered flying fortress called the Steam Castle. The castle begins to assualt London during the Great Exhibition, which leads to some great battle sequences between the O'Hara and Stephenson forces, with steam-powered tanks, battlesuits, airplanes, and submarines. Ray uses the Steamball to create a portable rocket, and flies into the castle to stop his father, and rescue Lloyd and Scarlett. Ray gets Scarlett away before the castle eventually falls, although both Lloyd and Edward apparently surivived according to the montage during the closing credits.

Steamboy is one of the shining examples of steampunk's influence on anime, more so than some Miyazaki movies like Howl's Moving Castle. It incorporates some of the best from the genre including the outlandish 19th Century technology and the bounding spirit found in the works of Mark Twain and Jules Verne. Now, the major faults with that though are it spends too much time debating on the morals of science and what it should be used for. The time they waste showing Lloyd and Edward arguing over philosophy alone would've taken at least thirty minutes off the movie. The other problem is that it's a little longer than necessary, and seems like it seriously lost alot of its direction during the last act. It does however leave a bold mark in the annuals of animation, and worth checking out at least for some exhilirating visuals.

2307698,4,B0009P42S2,"""Steamboy"" is a well-dubbed, well-animated movie produced by Sunrise, the studio which contributed to the animation of ""Batman: the Animated Series,"" and directed by ""Akira"" (1988) creator Katsuhiro Otomo. With the reputation of the most expensive animated film in Japan, the attention to detail in regards to cultural accuracy in its storyboards as well as the animators depiction of Western characters are commendable. I watch and read many anime and manga enough  to give an opinion on those artforms, but I also try to be unbiased in what I've witnessed in order to judge its worth as a film studies student and what I've tried to view as art. Many people have many opinions on what they view, and in this case regarding anime, and I hope that in order to judge something, it might be a good idea to curb enthusiasm and look at what's presented rationally.

So ""Steamboy"" tells the tale of Ray Steam, a boy whose the next in the line of great scientists which includes his father, Edward Steam, and his grandfather, Lloyd Steam. The setting is Victorian era England, a common motif in the Steampunk genre, where steam technology has taken to exaggerated heights as a great source of power. The central conflict to the story is what role should science take: as a source of power in order to dominate or as a source of hope in order to make a better world.

The characters that represent both sides of the conflict are Ray's father Ed Steam, and his grandfather Lloyd Steam respectively. The two men once shared the same drive in their research in steam technology, but a tragic accident in the film has changed their outlook on science to the extremes. Ray, the protagonist, represents the uncertain future of technology, given his status as a child who is at the age where he is not quite certain on what to think of the future. This role is exemplified when he was swayed by both his father and grandfather to follow their ideals, but through the course of the film he was able to form his own opinions on what his role in the future should be. Although the film has a rather bipolar stance to the issue of ethics, that being that Ray's father represents the evils of science and Lloyd Steam being the idealistic and most agreeable form of science, the director has taken care to show that although there are two groups who represent those ideals, Ed Steam's O'Hara Foundation's weapon merchants and Lloyd Steam's English Government's representatives, both sides show that they are not completely dark characters nor are there completely righteous people. One, in fact, can only say that Ray's father and grandfather are the only pure characters in their stance of science than the people they represent. The difference between those two men and the protagonist Ray is that he cares about the immediate consequences of the actions of those two men. When the conflict eventually escalates into the possibility of London's destruction, he immediately voices the problem to the two men, driving them back into reality and trying to rectify the problem at hand. Thus, Ray not only exemplifies the possible future and attitude of science, but also as the down-to-earth reality of how science affects the present.

There have been some reviews stating that the plotline is contrived and/or that the characters are flat. In some ways it's somewhat true. To me, I compare the film to the stock characters of pulp fiction. Not the movie by Tarantino, but the nickel paperback sensational fiction that haunt newstands and drugstores back in the 1920s to 1950s. Before the heyday of Jack Kirby who gave fairly well-rounded characters like the Fantastic Four and Spider-man during 1950s, fictional characters in science fiction and fantasy weren't very 3 dimensional. Charles Dickens is a great writer, and even though he created sympathetic heroes and heroines capable of change, they all start off as stock people with its designated Cad and Plucky Waif. Famed science fiction writers Jules Verne is no exception, and ""1984"" writer H. G. Wells created complex protagonists but that doesn't extend to the lesser characters. In ""Steamboy"" there are characters who fit designated roles, but sometimes there are some scenes where the characters perform outside of their given roles. Ray's grandfather may fit the Altruistic Scientist role, but he at times display lucidity and far-sightedness, but I personally think that he could be a potential altruistic terrorist. Ray's father Ed Steam also fits the trope of Mad Scientist with the typical megalomania that befits the likes of Magneto, but I also think towards the end he has his own bit of redemption. What some viewers would feel as the egregious example of flat characters is Scarlett O'Hara, the admittedly vapid daughter of the O'Hara foundation, does show some three dimensionality in some scenes regarding her. Many would find her annoying, but consider: this is the 19th century. Women are still confined in traditional values and young girls aren't yet as independent as they would be as the decades roll by. Scarlet is a spoiled Southern Belle whose wealth commands her whim to be accomplished. In a historical perspective, it would realistic. It's only through the course of the film that she grows outside of her enclosed world into someone who is beginning to be aware of how actions affect the whole of the community.

In all, this is a film that pays homage to a respectable genre just as ""Batman: The Animated Series"" pays homage to the timelessness of the 1950s. Although it's anime that's mainstream in the fact that the film takes place in a Western world with decidedly Western values, which is admirable feat because any other anime series or film that attempts to take place in a western setting still maintains some of the mindset of a regular Japanese, it's still a bit of a niche film in that a person who is not familiar with  the Steampunk genre would feel a bit overwhelmed to not quite decide what sort of decisive opinion to give outside of whether it's entertaining or not. I think that it's a great film and I probably overanalyze these concepts a bit too much, but I do so because I really like it. Every dub has its highs and lows, but there is an overall naturalness that makes listening to it comfortable.

I do not wish to be demanding, but I feel that anyone who watches this shouldn't think that they are watching an Anime film. Although it's a rather stylized Anime, I think that the overall content is enough to be that of the traditional film made in America. Do not compare it to Miyazaki, who really extols the traditions of Japan in most of his films, or to Satoshi Kon of ""Paprika"" (2006) fame. This is a film that tries very hard to be true to its roots and to its setting to the point where the only things that are remotely Japanese are the people who work on this film and the character style of which this film uses.

Afterall, ""Anime"" came from ""Animation,"" and really, the root of all modern Anime, that being Osamu Tezuka and his ""Astroboy"" series, really was a homage to Disney.

2307699,3,B0009P42S2,"The visual art of this film are unquestionably excellent, but the film just seems to keep going on and on. Set in Victorian England the suspension of disbelief has to go into overdrive.

It was lacking in nearly every regard, but, most importantly, it was devoid of any semblance of a coherent plot.  The characters were painfully shallow, and not a single one of them could lay claim to any redeeming qualities.  Any and all tension felt was the result of constant obnoxious explosions amidst the chaotic ridiculousness someone tried to pass off as a film.

As the film transitions from one inane conversation to the next, perhaps the only thing worth taking note of is the excellent detail work that was put into making the backgrounds and crafting the environments.  Unfortunately, the backgrounds are relegated to inanity owing to the simple fact that valves and pipes are bursting endlessly from the opening minutes to the closing credits. The tension that should have been felt when key characters pulled what were described as important levers or turned similarly important valves was entirely negated since there seemed to be steam coming out of absolutely everything in the entire film.

Never has a film striven so greatly toward exhausting its credibility budget.

2307701,4,B0009P42S2,"Steamboy is a film directed and co-written by Katsuhiro Otomo.  The film was in production for ten years and utilized more than 180,000 drawings and 440 CG cuts.  With a production cost of $26,000,000, Steamboy is the most expensive full length Japanese animated movie produced to date.

The animation in Steamboy is very well done, and the viewer can tell that a lot of time was taken to produce the film.  As you watch, you can also see how torn Ray is when he's having to decide whether to help his father or his grandfather.  A viewer can also tell that an alternate history was utilized.  While steam is the main source of power, there are some elements of the technology utilized that either wouldn't have existed yet, or progressed faster than they did in our timeline.

This DVD release of Steamboy contains several special features, and on the special features menu, they are split out into: Featurettes, Animation Onion Skins, Production Drawings, and Previews.  Under ""Featurettes,"" there are a total of four items included.  The first is an almost nineteen-minute documentary about producing the English dub of Steamboy, which includes interviews with some of the voice actors and some of the crew members involved with the dub.  Next is a five-minute interview with director Katsuhiro Otomo.  Otomo is speaking in Japanese, but instead of putting subtitles on the bottom of the screen, an American voice-over is dubbed over Otomo's voice.  Personally, I found this rather annoying.  Next is a ""Multi-Screen Landscape Study,"" which is a nineteen-minute piece that aired on three screens at a Steamboy exhibition.  Here, subtitles are utilized to translate the spoken Japanese.  ""The Adventure Continues"" is a textless version of the ending credits, which serve as a kind of epilogue for the film.

The ""Animation Onion Skins"" runs for about four-and-a-half minutes, and shows the various developmental stages of five scenes (which shows everything from rough animation to final scenes).  ""Production Drawings"" runs for almost six minutes, and it shows paintings that had been done as the sets were developed.  The ""Previews"" menu includes several previews of both anime and non-anime releases from the studio that released Steamboy.

With Otomo, Everything is so apocalyptic and gargantuan that the characters are reduced to atoms. Therein lies the problem with his movies.

2307705,4,B0009P42S2,"The strangest thing about Steamboy is not that it's amazing, but that so much of the original was missed by european audiences.
I saw the original uncut japanese edition at a film festival when it first came out - I was astounded to hear how much shorter it was-
to explain simply, the english version (hitherto released as the standard on DVD) cuts twenty (yes, that's right) minutes off of the end. Twenty minutes which actually make it a decent ending, as opposed to a pathetically predictable one for persons so stupid they can't take an original twist on standard three-act structural narrative directions.
But, back to the film. In essense the film blends modern animation - both 3d and 2d - better than any previous film, making possibly the most visually stunning animation picture ever produced, to date- you never stop to think, oh, that bit's 3D, because it never is obvious.
A skillfully developed storyline means that unlike other anime blockbusters such as Akira, it never feels that the action is forced into too small a length of time, or that the storyline falls prey to a predictable and long setup, which seems to be the norm for hollywood cartoon films (bar pixar's work).
The story is a parable of science, the pursuit of power, and why americans shouldn't have access to the world's latest technologies (I don't think Japan's quite over Hiroshima yet). At the end of the day, don't listen to some fat manga-head who insists that the film isn't up to scratch in terms of their cultural preconceptions of what Japan is 'all about'. Like any film, this should be appreciated in it's own right, and in that, it is splendid. One of the few watchable manga films in the world.
Best on the largest screen you have.

Now to the release itself. The 'Directors Cut' is, in fact, the original Japanese version, replete with original 20 minutes missing from the ""standard edition"". If you watch it in english, be prepared for some of the worst voice-acting in the history of cinema, as americans laughably try to pass themselves off as cockney in typically terrible fashion. It doesn't work, and makes the film utterly ingratiating to watch. Ignore this. Listen to it in Japanese, you'll be fine. Nothing wrong with the Japanese voiceovers, as is usually the case. The quality of the sound is great, as it should be, and is one of the best aspects of this film, in my opinion. Image quality leaves a lot to be desired, but should be alright on a standard tv.
If you watch this on a lcd screen or computer monitor however, be prepared for a grainy, weak image quality. Why this should be is beyond me, but clearly the encoders haven't done their job particularly well. None of this matters during the later parts, which are usually fast-moving action sequences,
but it is fairly noticeable in the earlier sections.
Buy it. This film deserves to go down in recent history as one of the great modern cartoon films-

Lloyd and Edward Steam, father and son, have invented the ""steam ball,"" a soccer-ball-sized contraption that will contain and control steam pressure far greater than any boiler. (How it works and how you get the steam in there is brushed aside -- fortunately.) They use this fantastic new energy source, financed by the mysterious O'Hara Foundation, to construct and power the Steam Tower, now on display near the Crystal Palace at London's Great Exhibition. But the Foundation is really in the international arms business and the Steam Tower is their greatest weapon yet, including steam-powered-augmented armored solders (""steam troopers""), flying machines, submarines, and the Tower itself, which stomps around London like a gigantic metal godzilla. And who's to bring an end to this carnage? Why, Ray Steam, the adolescent scion of the Steam family and a genius inventor himself. It takes awhile before you figure out who are the Good Guys and who are the Baddies, and even then you're never quite sure. In fact, the moral of the whole story appears to be: Never trust anyone when it comes to corporate greed and weapons profits. There's lots of neat stuff here, including Ray's steam-powered omnicycle, and the enemy's huge iron waldoes, and especially Ray's makeshift quasi-rocket platform.

2307710,4,B0009P42S2,"Taken on its own, this is a dazzling film. Fans comparing various anime might find reason to cavil, but I probably like it for reasons others don't. It doesn't mix and match CGI effects or use up its bag of tricks. It's not given to constantly shifting camera angles merely because computerized cameras can do that, which still seems a novelty to live action producers. It stays largely to its color palette, the dark, forbidding tones of a Dicknesian Victorian England. By comparison I found the preview for Final Fantasy VII, which some fans probably consider state of the art, extremely boring.

Steamboy plays like a filmed book, very deftly showing more than it tells. When there is speaking, it rarely clears things up, but merely adds more red herrings to the story. The film obviously owes a lot to Sherlock Holmes, as well as the earlier mechanical (as opposed to later electronic) ingenuity of The Wild Wild West TV show. But it draws subtly from these inspirations. Steamboy ends as it has to, in the epic fashion of Jules Verne and all Victorian and Edwardian visionary novels. One scene is also quite similar to the visually arresting opening of Chesterton's 1905 novel, The Ball and The Cross, although the story line is entirely different. I expect that except for The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, the future visions of this era are largely unexplored as film territory. The ending also suggests that a sequel, or even a series could follow. But instead it does something else: depict the ""continuing adventure"" in poignant scenes behind the closing credits. Choosing one of the extra features runs this imaginative portrayl without the credits.

The main characters are all inventors, and all in the same lineage. The father and grandfather's long- winded speeches about Science are hard to take seriously, but the same optimistic view of a rosy future exists in numerous Victorian era books. The show also revolves around the London Exhibition and the famous Crystal Palace, then the showplace of British and world progress. But what else is the film? A parable? A puzzle? An exploration? Does the use of steam for military purposes echo other sorts of energy harnessed for destruction, as foreshadowed in the aeroplane sequences during the credits? Is the economic thralldom in which Britain was held in the nineteenth century meant to resonate in our own? If the denouement seems predictable and the ending somewhat forced, the issues that puzzle the characters nevertheless remain ""live"" questions in this visually spectacular and intriguing film.",1183161600,11,2573,5.051764705882353

This one didn't grab me. The animation is every bit as good as you would expect, but the story is just weak. I was really excited when I realized this was being released, but just ended up being disappointed. Some people love it, so DEFINITELY watch before you buy!!!

If you are new to Anime - this is not a good starting point and if you have already seen it and DID enjoy it there is a whole world of great movies waiting for you! Visually, my favorite is Appleseed (2004 - there are older un-enhanced anime series shows floating around). Storywise, pick up the Studio Ghibli movie pack. This contains Spirited Away and MANY more classics (I think mine has 12 movies and it cost me a whopping 15.00 on ebay plus shipping).",1181174400,,862,4.627450980392157
2307712,3,B0009P42S2,"The hand-drawn artwork combined with CGI is simply stunning in this movie, it's a treat to the eyes.

The setting is 1800's England, in an alternative Steampunk past where machinery powered by steam has advanced civilization to a new age of reason - the promise of steam that if it would've maintained dominance in lieu of combustion, would've reinforced England's dominance.  That's what steampunk is all about, after all, the investment that England made in infrastructure built for steam locked them into a future path that turned out to be weak and ill conceived in hindsight. It's a wonderful fantasy and when done well, it can be a rich alternate history.  Tim Powers and Bruce Sterling create interesting Steampunk tales, and I can imagine if they'd written a story for Katsuhiro Otomo to direct, the combination would be magnificent.  That said, the story just didn't work for me.

At first it was predictable, like stock parts off the fiction workshop shelf.  A boy gets a powerful item of technology and has to fight his own father for the rights to assert his own will, his own ingenuity, and strike out on his own.  There isn't enough background to allow the viewer to believe that this boy has the skills necessary to pull off his part in this story.  There also isn't enough plot to sustain the believability of the entire story.

Bad guys are comical and wooden, good guys are stereotyped and predictable.  If the movie hadn't been so pretty, I'd have given it a lower rating.  Fortunately, with the volume off, it's a beautiful show.

2307713,2,B0009P42S2,"I'd almost be willing to give five stars for the background animation alone.  The moody colors, amazing 3D drawn landscapes, and the detail in the steam machinery were incredible eye-candy, and will delight any fan of animation.

Unfortunately, the plot is nonsensical (even for anime), the characters are truly terrible, and the cell-style 2D character animation style jars horribly with the 3D backgrounds.  The characters in *Steamboy* look like amaturish paper cutouts laid over the background of a completely different movie.  Even the colors don't match.  (Imagine Inuyasha appearing in a scene from *Full Metal Alchemist*, and you'll get the picture).

I don't really know how to review this movie, because I'm so astonished by how good the background animation is.  It's some of the best I've seen anywhere, yet it has these horrible 2D characters that aren't even nearly as well animated and seem to be taken from a different movie.  The plot, such as it is, seems to have tacked on at the very last minute, and has already been ably evicerated by other reviewers.

Not recommended except for technical animation fans.  Too bad the DVD doesn't have a ""remove characters and dialog"" option.  I'd seriously rate it higher, since the Victorian diorama-style backgrounds are truly remarkable.",1174003200,3,1297,5.157894736842105
2307714,4,B0009P42S2,"As his follow-up to ""Akira,"" Katsuhiro tomo spent a staggering eight years producing ""Steamboy,"" a stellar example of anime steampunk. It's full of detailed animation, solid direction and some really inspired action scenes, although the final fourth is extremely bloated. Dark, detailed, gritty and full of smoke, steam and grime.

In the mid 1800s, Dr. Lloyd Steam (Patrick Stewart) and his son Eddie Steam (Alfred Molina) are involved in top secret experimentation for the O'Hara Corporation. There's a disaster which leaves only one machine intact -- the Steam Ball.

Then Eddie's son Ray (Anna Paquin), a budding inventer, gets the Steam Ball in the mail -- and some thuggish Foundation men destroying the house to get the valuable machine. Ray escapes with the Ball, barely eluding the men, and ends up captured by a rogue zeppelin that tears a train apart. Great scene.

But the man in charge of this is none other than Ray's father Eddie, who was terribly burned and is now part machin. Eddie, who is still working for the Foundation, is in charge of the powerful Steam Tower and all the war inventions inside. Now Ray's loyalties are divided, as his father and grandfather battle in a war that has no clear ""right"" or ""wrong"" -- but which may wreck London, then the world.

If you're going to spend almost a decade working on a movie, then people expect a masterpiece. And while ""Steamboy"" won't change anime the way ""Akira"" did, it's still a prime example of the steampunk genre -- Victorian English surroundings, but with steam-powered tanks, subs and other technology.

The main plot is basically about a family's conflict over different ideas about how technology should be used. But Katsuhiro tomo includes a deeper meaning to the conflict -- there's no clear-cut villain and hero here, since both Eddie and Lloyd have good intentions, though one believes in peace through power, and the other knows that power corrupts.

And the animation is amazingly detailed, so you can see every puff of steam and smear of grease. No big watery eyes here. It makes the action scenes -- including a zeppelin and train almost smashing into Victoria Station -- all the more compelling. In between, we have some solid character development, such as Ray getting to know the bratty O'Hara heiress, and experimenting with primitive subs and machinery.

But every movie has a flaw, and ""Steamboy's"" is that the last fourth is bloated. It's a brilliant battle -- especially the flying soldiers -- and the end itself is satisfying. But it's too slow and meandering, and has too many lingering shots of the bulbous tower over London. Fortunately it regains its footing in the last few minutes, especially when Ray takes control of the plot.

Ray himself is one of the most compelling child-heroes ever -- he's genuinely smart, resourceful and mature, but he's still young. He's only learning that not everything in life (even your family) is what it seems. And the supporting cast is also good, with a subdued Molina as Eddie and Stewart as the feisty Lloyd, who seems like an older version of Ray. And then there's Scarlett, a spoiled brat who is pretty annoying up until the final battle.

""Steamboy"" suffers from a rather slow finale, but the movie itself is a brilliantly-animated, solidly-plotted adventure. Definitely worth checking out.",1171497600,,3333,4.948121645796064

While there are plenty of interesting steam mechanisms, that's about all it has going for it-- any sophistication ends there.  The plot is simplistic, the ""science"" too laughable to even make decent fantasy, the character designs typical US stereotype-mannekin-formula and the personalities unengaging.  The whole thing seems designed by draftsmen or accountants rather than creative artists, just like recent US produced fare.  Would likely appeal only to the undiscerning youngest of kids.

But then I saw Steamboy. All I have to say about this movie is, well, it isn't Miyazaki. Sure the animation looks great, nothing Miyazaki has ever made looked quite this good, not even Spirited Away. But this movie lacks the fun and awe of Miyazaki's works. Miyazaki's movies have great, and I do mean GREAT, stories and some of the best characters ever made. Steamboy lacks both of these. The story here is pretty stupid overall. We are apparently supposed to sympathize with Ray's granddad, but he was crazy. I'm telling you he belonged in a loony vill, and Ray's dad seemed to care about him, instead of just using him like the grandpa did.

And I never found myself actually likening these people. Ray didn't know what he wanted to do, his dad was too, what's the word, Darth Vader like, and his grandpa was crazy and preachy. Who's left? Miss? She was a brat, and a stupid one at that. Unlike in any of Miyazaki's films, these people were just. . . there.

2307720,5,B0009P42S2,"I don't know anime but I know what I like. I liked ""Steamboy"", Katsuhiro Otomo's 2004 film, even though the idea of a sort of industrial revolution era sci-fi did seem a little odd at first.

Ray Steam is a boy growing up in 1860s Manchester. His grandfather and father are both engineers, and pioneers in steam based technology. On a trip to Iceland, these relatives discovered a liquid that could be transformed into a high density, high pressure steam, which could fuel machinery with a minimum loss of energy. With this liquid, bolted up inside black metal ""steam balls"", almost anything can be achieved. This is science at its most powerful, and has many international eyes turned toward Great Britain. Plot and counter-plot are uncovered, intentions are made known and the Steam Castle (a giant floating fortress, powered by steam) is revealed. Ray's father wants to world to see it, his grandfather wants it torn apart. Scarlett O'Hara, an American heiress to a businessman's fortune, is just there for the ride, and for Ray's company. Ray, however, is very confused. These are very confusing times? What will he do?

It's interesting seeing England (and London in particular) through Japanese eyes. The London of ""Steamboy"" is a little on the theoretical side, everything looks well researched and studied, but it does lack a bit of that charm, warmth and pomp that the English landscape, architecture and people have. The accents and the use of British slang in the English dub, for instance, feel a little bit pushed. Still, it is a very atmospheric backdrop, and suits the story well, I thought. The characters are fairly interesting to watch, which keeps the more philosophical dialogue (the nature of science, etc) from seeming over the top. There is action, but it is diluted a bit by the atmosphere, the colours and the slabs of dialogue between shots. I didn't really mind though, left me time to think about what was being explored.

Special features include several making of segments, original production drawings, original theatrical trailer, and some pre-visual bits and pieces.

Worth a look for fans of anime, fans of the Victorian era and maybe lovers of the older style of sci-fi (like Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, etc).",1161907200,,2241,4.952127659574468

I felt what the characters felt. The little boy having to choose sides in his own family-how heart breaking. In the end I believe the father and grandfather both prove to be nuts.

I was let down.  The animation flows well, but is rather bland. Unlike most anime', which is futuristic (even post-apocalyptic), this story is based around the turn-of-the century 1900.  Steam was the main form of power for many engines, and engineers were working on newer & better forms of steam technology.  How lame is it to have the main character's family name be ""Steam""?

There are some interesting concepts in the story, but over all, it's a snooze-fest for most anime' fans.  Akira this is not.  Rent the movie before you decide to buy it (unless you find it on clearance for $3 like my husband did...at least that was cheaper than a rental fee).

I think the other ""in depth"" reviews go over all the important points- my review is just a simple way of saying that this movie is quite a let-down. The very end of the movie is the only thing that salvages it and I give it two stars instead of one.  The end is an unexpected twist on what the grandfather had planned the steam-balls for.  That, and watching the snotty-little-girl's dream house in England go Ka-BOOM! are the best parts of the movie (you'll have to watch the movie to understand that part, so I don't think it's a spoiler).

The story itself was confusing, not because of complexity, yet because the film had too much in too little time, giving the viewer barely any time to sum up the information. In short: too much, too soon. The film focuses a little overboard on the animations and effects instead of the story and characters, resulting in a totally non-emotionally driven film at all.

2307731,5,B0009P42S2,"A movie that starts slow but good and builds to a massive scope of action and imagination, ""Steamboy"" is yet another example of how vast the field of anime has become.  Set in a London of 1866 just like the one in history books and set on the metaphorical eve of events that will change human history and cause the world to diverge from 'our' future.  Most of the movie's main characters are members of the Steam family (fourteenish-Ray Steam is the title character), and the father and grandfather of the family, away for years working in America, have discovered a method of harnessing steam power to far greater yields than anything ever seen in 'our' world.  This new technology puts the two against each other and starts the ball rolling toward the 1866 London Industrial Fair, and a sudden turning point in the world's history that occurs in a few hours of a single day.  Much of the movie is spent trying to decide which side one, as the viewer, wants to be on, what the true motivations of the various characters really are, and who is telling the truth about what.  As with the rest of the movie, this angle of uncertainty is very well done.  A tour-de-force of visual imagery and epic ideas, masterfully animated, this one in my opinion far outdoes director Katsuhiro Otomo's previous full-length anime ""Akira"".  One thing of special note: you'll want to stay for the full end credits and watch the background's changing stills-imagery for astonishing glimpses of the future world of ""Steamboy"", far more than enough to make a powerful case for a sequel as soon as possible.",1146009600,3,1584,4.696750902527076
2307732,4,B0009P42S2,"I am an animator myself and a fan of animation when it is good, but I am not an anime fanboy. I don't care to read subtitles. If something comes from Japan that does not automatically make it more special to me, but I know quality when I see it. This is a quality piece of work.

The artwork is smooth, the camera moves are brilliantly devised and the style and detail are appropriate to the subject. In fact, the attention to detail is stunning.

This is a story that could be classified under a recently recognised genre of speculative fiction, or science fiction called ""Steampunk."" This term probably derives from the novel, ""The Difference Engine"" co-authored by William Gibson, noted cyberpunk writer. In that novel, Babbage's Analytical Engine or Difference Engine, a mechanical computer which operated by a series of gears, more like an adding machine than today's electronic computers, came into common use much earlier than it in fact did. Another movie that might fall into this category is ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen."" Like ""The Difference Engine,"" this movie has technologies (robotics, powered flight and similar concepts) coming into existence much earlier than actually happened, but under the power of steam thanks to a revolutionary advance in containing great pressure.

19th century England is well-rendered here with fantastic attention to setting and detail. Amazingly, I believe that most of the cultural icons used are very well handled. Even the sermon by Steamboy's father about the awesome power of science fits very accurately into the period.

It is also true that to the western audience some of the conflict between the father and grandfather will come across as childish and grating. Particularly the obligatory platitudes about how bad and petty a thing earning money is. As if movies weren't made to make money. I would probably lose my lunch if I had to say some of the lines that Patric Stewart did. Though at least the warmongering state gets shown for what it is when it tries to take control of the source of steam power in its turn. The movie concludes with a very Japanese seeming melancholy and confusion about the effects of technological power rather than the unbridled triumph more common at the end of western adventure movies. But between Steamboy's hopeful attitude an excellent closing soundtrack and a sequence of images that I suppose is meant to hint at the future adventures of the characters it leaves you with an overall positive feeling.

The English dub is done extremely well. Far better than most of the foreign movies I've seen in the last two years. Anna Paquin does a fantastic job on the lead character and Patric Stewart adds believability (He is a native of the region his character is supposed to have come from.) to another very prominent character. So far as I could tell the exact same words were used in the dub as in the subtitles included in this version.

There are many elements that are handled well and the examination of the dawn of the 20th century in the west through the Japanese lens all help to make this a fresh and unique movie experience. The dub and the musical score are fantastic.",1145491200,2,3180,4.857933579335794
2307733,4,B0009P42S2,The movie was just as promised. Also the movie itself was very good. Excellent artistry and plot. Very enjoyable,1140652800,3,112,4.947368421052632
2307734,3,B0009P42S2,"It's a common law that only gets broken rarely: the more anticipated something is, the less likely chance it'll meet or exceed expectations. A new cd by a band you love might not be that great. The follow-up to a director's past masterpiece falls below expectations. Steamboy is one of those kind of films where there's an obvious enthusiasm and passion involved, it's just not what it should've been.

We're in the mid 1800's right smack in the middle of the Industrial Revolution in Europe. Steam is the big thing so when Ray Steam(very lazy name) gets his hands on an odd ""Steam ball"", he soon becomes a target for the O'Hara Foundation. They want to harness the power of the ball for their own needs(which obviously don't benefit anyone) so Ray has to keep the ball away from people who would want to use it.

One thing that made Akira enjoyable was that the story just seemed to unfold without any hiccups(even if you couldn't understand it). Steamboy's pacing is incredibly off since it feels so SLLOOOWWW. So much happened yet I was only 40 minutes in. It doesn't help that there's not much to the story either. The moral of the story it seems is that technology for personal use is bad while technology benefiting everyone is good. Granted you could say it's something else but the film is so black and white that you'd have to say it like that. Many technology we use we actually use on our own or for our own needs.

The characters aren't really that interesting either and don't go through much change. Ray is your typical hero that saves the day when he doesn't exactly possess the skills to do so, it's more through luck. There's Scarlett, your very typical spoiled brat who wants things her way and for us to answer everything or criticize when we don't know it. Usually in films they learn their lesson but here, she's still bossy and spoiled. The only one that really goes through any amount of change is our ""villain"" but he has a big change of heart incredibly quickly you're like ""gee that was fast"".

Now all those negatives and some positives? Of course and it's the animation. Using 3D, the animation looks very stylized and fluid without being a bit obvious. A lot of 2D/3D mixtures tend to be very noticeable to distinguish the 2 but here it's almost flawless. I say almost because certain characters in early scenes almost looked pasted onto the background.

Now I didn't watch the english dub but it's probably good since it has reliable Patrick Stewart and Alfred Molina and Anna Paquin...playing a boy. Yes, Rogue from X-Men is playing a teenage boy. She even mentions in the special features that the ADR people had to tell her to say things more lower register. Why they didn't just get a young guy actor or an older one with good range to do it is beyond me.

Is it a great film? No. Terrible film? No. In the middle? Most definately. If you're an anime fan, you should check it out but since this is a highly anticipated project from the man who brought you Akira, you'll probably find it won't live up to your expectations.",1140307200,8,3056,4.547272727272727
2307735,4,B0009P42S2,"I'm a fan of Akira (as most people reviewing here are) and I enjoyed Steamboy just slightly less.  I've gotten older since I saw Akira, my views on the world are different and animation has changed in that time too.  I thought the animation was gorgeous in this movie but as I was watching it I couldn't help but think it's just not ground breaking.  Of course that's not intended as a criticism.  It's almost impossible to be ground breaking today the way Akira was when it first came out and for several years after.  I love the hand drawn stuff but computer animation loses some of the ability to awe.  That's not a fair assessment however.  Steamboy is a work of art in it's own right.

The story moved along at a good pace in my opinion.  It wasn't any slower than Spirited Away or Royal Space Force - Wings of Honneamise.  The slow quiet moments allowed a better appreciation of the beautiful images and animation.  The problem with the story wasn't the pacing but the clich&eacute;d anti-capitalist rants.  It is too simplistic a world view.  The movie wants it both ways.  The overt message is violence and war are wrong while the action is fetishizing that violence.  The battle scenes have a how-cool-is-this look and feel to them.  The artists aren't necessarily trying to see how beautiful they can make war but that's the end result.

The underlying themes in this movie are certainly similar to Akira and while I've heard it said this film is more viewer friendly there are still some deeper things going on that are less obvious.  While I thought the anti-capitalist messages were almost niav&eacute; they were still thought provoking (but just a little).  It would be getting carried away to say there was anything more deep and meaningful going on here than comic book philosophy.

In the end the movie is gorgeous to look at with a lot of senses numbing action sequences and good entertainment",1137888000,,1911,4.664670658682635

2307739,5,B0009P42S2,"Steamboy is no Akira, and for many fans I think this will end up as a crime. Akira was a complex, violent, and disturbing film. Steamboy seems more akin to Walt Disney. Unfortunately for me, I bought this movie expecting Akira and I was obviously disappointed. But then I watched it a second time; I forced myself to, with a mindset that didn't include Akira. I told myself that I've seen and enjoyed anime of this type before (Spirited Away), so it couldn't be all that bad.

I was right. The film was excellent the second time (and the first time as well, only I was of the mind to hate it because of it's less-mature themes). In the end, I realized it was actually very close to Akira in that it was a story of a young boy trying to save his family and friends from a technological catastrophe, and has to do all this with very mixed emotions of what is right and wrong (no more spoilers, I promise). When I realized how good this movie actually was, I also realized that, like Akira, it's a groundbreaker. It proves what Studio Ghibli has been attempting to prove on its own: that anime does not have to be violent, strange, or downright macabre to be good.

Pick this film up if you want to see a new side to anime. And remember, it's no Akira, Ghost in the Shell, or Ninja Scroll, but it still deserves its name among these anime greats.",1129507200,2,1343,4.304347826086956
2307750,3,B0009P42S2,"I'm still learning the ropes when it comes to anime, which means I can't compare Steamboy to Katsuhiro Otomo's legendary Akira.  I can, however, say that I enjoyed Otomo's contribution to the film Memories more than I did Steamboy.  Both share the same kind of heavily industrial world of the past, cast in sepia-like tones reflecting an atmosphere of gloom.  That was more than okay for Memories' ""Cannon Fodder,"" but the world of Steamboy eventually grew tiresome to me.  The animation of this film is excellent, but it consisted of far too many scenes of exploding machinery, to the detriment of character development and storyline.  Frankly, I just didn't care about this plot all that much.

You've got a young, inventive boy who finds himself in the middle of a conflict over the nature of science.  It's an argument that will erupt in loud, frightening chaos over the city of London.  The boy's name is Ray Steam, and steam is definitely the key word in all of this.  Ray receives a parcel from his grandfather containing an ultra-powerful ""steamball,"" and almost at once he's forced to honor his grandfather's request to keep it out of the hands of ""the Foundation.""  His father, however, or at least a somewhat mechanized version of him, happens to be in cahoots with the Foundation, and he begins to win his son over to his own version of science.  He has used the vast power of steam to take his own father's vision of a Steam Castle and turn it into a well-armed weapon, complete with steam-powered flyers, subs, and mechanized fighters.  The grandfather, looking much the worse for wear, shows up to try and sabotage his evil son's efforts, and he confronts Ray with his own peaceful vision of science.  Fortunately for the audience, there's a spoiled little rich girl (by the name of Scarlett O'Hara - I kid you not) to add some life to all this philosophizing and artificiality.  The whole thing soon breaks down into a not-so-small war over London.  If you like explosions and scenes of utter destruction in your anime, you'll definitely want to check out Steamboy.  That's about all you'll find in the second half of the film.

To me, Steamboy is a case of style over substance.  None of the characters are as fully developed as I would have liked, and the whole story never manages to take on very much depth.  Motion pictures, even anime, cannot live on cinematography alone if they want to be truly successful.  With its underdeveloped storyline, Steamboy just didn't prove satisfying to me.",1129334400,4,2511,4.768518518518518
2307751,4,B0009P42S2,"After directing ""Akira"" in 1988, Katsuhiro tomo avoided making another feature length anime for years.  In 1991 he did a live action film, the horror-comedy ""Warudo apaatoment hora"" and then in 1995 he did the ""Cannon Fodder"" segment for ""Memories.""  He wrote the scripts for Hiroyuki Kitakubo's ""Rjin Z"" in 1991 and adopted Osamu Tezuka's manga for Rintaro's ""Metoroporisu"" in 2001.  But it was not until 2004 that tomo helmed  ""Steamboy"" and left himself open to the inevitable comparisons of this two-hour anime with the classics in the field in which he had a major hand.

On the one hand ""Steamboy"" is as visually stunning as you would expect, albeit in a decidedly different way from ""Akira"" and ""Metroporisu.""  This time around tomo is not telling a futuristic story, but one set in 1866 in the London of Victorian England, which mandates sepia toned colors rather than working with a palate of bright neon colors.  That alone justifies a different look to ""Steamboy,"" and the chief attraction for this anime are the hand-drawn animation, enhanced by computers, of the massive machines of gears and pistons.  But there is another interesting consequences to the setting of ""Steamboy,"" which is that for the first time with a Japanese anime I am recommending that you listen to the English audio track rather than the Japanese.  Since the characters are actually English, then for once it makes sense to go this route.  Besides, we are talking Patrick Stewart as grandfather Dr. Lloyd Steam, Alfred Molina as his son Dr. Eddie Steam, and Anna Panquin as James Ray Steam, who is the film's title figure.

The key idea behind ""Steamboy"" is to recast the Industrial Revolution of the 19th-century with steam now holding a power and promise akin to atomic energy after World War II, although I guess scientifically the power is more like a jet engine (but the implications for transforming the world strike me as being more in the realm of the idealized future represented by atomic power).  Ray Steam is a boy inventor who comes into possession of ""steam ball,"" and then finds himself in a struggle between his father, who has become part-machine and power mad, and his grandfather, who turns into a wild-eyed Cassandra of gloom and doom.  The evil Dr. Steam is building an army with steam-powered tanks, mechanical  armor suits, and even steam jet packs for aerial assaults.  If tomo did not read Jules Verne at some point in his life I would be really surprised, because ""Steamboy"" owes as much to Verne's writing as it does to James Bond spy films and Tom Swfit adventures.

However, the story is just not up to the grandeur of the animation, which involves not only the captivating combination of hand-drawn animation and computers, but also some great camera movement.  If this were a live-action film we would be talking about the impressive cinematography, especially since tomo seems to make a point of going for angles you are unlikely to get in the real world.  So there is more than just the retro look of ""Steamboy"" to recommend when it comes to the visuals of this 2004 film.  But tomo does not explore the steam technology as much as I would have liked, so that a promising idea becomes rather conventional and the substance behind the style ends up being disappointing.  Even the big debate behind the power play is childishly simplistic, so we are not dealing with a potent allegory either.  Besides, I was waiting for there to be more of a payoff to the character of Scarlett O'Hara (Kari Wahlgren).  Then again, it is entirely possible that tomo is never going to top ""Akira"" (what has James Cameron really done since ""Titanic""?) and even with its faults ""Steamboy"" is certainly worth watching.",1127692800,4,3715,4.835703001579779
2307752,3,B0009P42S2,"I have been on an anime kick for sometime. My latest anime pic I recently rented is Katsuhiro Otomo's ""Steamboy"". The story takes place during the industrial revolution. A young boy named James Ray Steam receives a package from his grandfather which contains a powerful ball that pretty much harnesses the power of steam. Just as the package gets to his home, two suspicious looking gentlemen arrives at his home and tries to take the ball from James. James doesn't allow the agents to take them when he sees the note from his grandfather that the men are not good. This quickly sets off a chase between these agents and James. Slowly but surely the premise of the film of the goodness of humanity vs. the evils and dangers of technology is revealed.

I loved the animation of the film. The combination of hand drawn animation and computer generated animation was gorgeous, especially towards the end of the film. The first hour of the film had me deeply engrossed but the last hour started to drag on for me. Sometimes I think director's cut versions of films are really not necessary 'cause they have a tendency to bog down the story of the film, and this is the case here on ""Steamboy"". I also was annoyed for most of the film by Miss Scarlett. I never understood her relationship to Dr. Eddie Steam. I only watched the Japanese version. America needs to stop ruining anime films with their dreadful English dubbing. It just takes so much away from the magic of what the Japanese created. All in all I did like ""Steamboy"" but the pace of the film was too slow for me at times.",1127347200,4,1579,4.540350877192982
2307753,3,B0009P42S2,"I, being a (self-proclaimed) animation oficionado, know somewhat of the reputation of Katsuhiro Otomo.  I, myself have never seen AKIRA (yes, I know I should), but after hearing how good this guy was, I wanted to see Steamboy.

  So, I rented it from Blockbuster and popped it into my DVD player.  I watched the beautiful steam effects and animation.  I will give him credit for the fact that his movie was visually beautiful.  However, I could see some definite things that needed fixing.

  In the first ""act"" of the movie, the pace was good, exciting; interesting things happened; the story moved along and kept you interested.  The characters were interesting and we didn't get bogged down TOO much in exposition.  The chases were superb, and that steam bike-wheel invention of Ray's was, I have to say, awesome.

I'm sad that I can't say the same for the rest of the movie.

  In the second ""act"", we are introduced to Scarlett and wonder why Otomo ditched Emma for this loser; Ray's dad and grandfather spout endless, stock philosophy; and Ray pretty much sits around and listens.  There was only character fattening here for the father and grandfather, not fleshing out.  And every time you think, ""Hey, Scarlett might be okay after all,"" she contradicts herself and makes you hate her even more.

  Finally, there's the third act of the movie, where things pick up again--not quite to the level of the first act, but SO much better in comparison to the second act that it looks like a gift from heaven.  Ray and the others  actually do some useful, good things (even Scarlett! *shock and amazement*), and (better yet) there's only minimal philosophy-spouting!  Yayness!  There are a couple of pretty annoying things there (like not getting to see Ray catch Scarlett), but overall it was good. Not great, but good.

Then there's the end credits--and I guess they're okay for some people, but I thought that they really didn't need any of them but seeing his house rebuilt and him coming home.  That would be the fairy tale moment to end it at.  I guess I'm just an old-fashioned romantic, but the rest of them seem unnessecary to me.

So, bottom line:
Rent it, don't buy it.",1126915200,2,2181,4.726063829787234
2307754,5,B0009P42S2,"This movie is unlike Otomo's ""Akira"" in evey way but one: excellence. Although the movie is set in Victorian England, it's thoroughly Japanese. For one thing, the metal monster tears up the city in the big finale - this time, the city is London. It's a good story, though, with an enticing bit of sequel-bait at the end.

The animation is all you could hope for. I'm convinced Otomo picked Victorian technology because it's so visually understandable, so easy to respond to. A silicon chip may have far more potential in it, but huge clashing gears, striking sparks as they engage, project a tangible sense of power. Voice commands to a computer could have consequences of any magnitude, but it means a lot more to see human muscle wrestling against a giant lever.

The good vs. bad technology issue is drawn without subtlety, but probably works at a level that kids can approach. It's kid-friendly in other ways, too: there's some violence, but bloodless, people keep their clothes on, and some ugly realities of steam technology have been tamed. Pipes and boilers burst a few times in the movie, but no one really gets hurt by it - when that happened in the real world, people died in horrific ways.

It's not Akira, but rises to Akira's standards in every way. Steamboy is a new requirement for any collection of anime.

2307758,5,B0009P42S2,"One reason for hating this movie would be the dub. It's one of the worst I've heard in a long time. DO NOT WATCH THE DUB! Especially for your first viewing. Roger Ebert gave this a negative review (after watching the dub) for having a nonsensical storyline. Well, the subbed version I saw in the theatre (Im lucky enough to live in a city where it played), made lots of sense and was actually quite simple. It's a story about science, more specifically energy, and how to use it. Different ideologies are represented by different characters. Eventually these opinions manifest into physical action, in a battle, and the film ends with what I can only describe as the opposite of a big explosion! Cool! Original!

Having said that, this film (like Akira) is not really about story and characters. This film is a singular, visual statement. Like Michelangelo's David. It amazes me how many people don't get this! Akira is a statement about the ""End of the World"" mentality many post WW2 young japanese men felt (and still do), as a result of the bomb, rapidly advancing technology and a long history of violent earthquakes. It's about the rebuilding of Tokyo. Steamboy is the same way. The story and the characters are just tools for Otomo to express his statement.

And finally the animation. I can say without a doubt that this is THE BEST ANIMATION I have ever seen! It is so clean, so technically perfect, so intricate, and so consistant I can't believe human hands achieved it. I think it is so flawless people accept it and begin to underappreciate it. If you claim to have respect for 2D animation there is simply no way to not like this film.",1124841600,,1648,4.640410958904109

The creativity and skill required to create such a visual masterpiece is beyond my imagining. And the idea to place the story in a slightly fantastic version of Victorian England was sheer genius. In visual terms, this movie is a Masterpiece with some of the most fantastic and beautiful imagery I've seen in a movie in a long, long time.

On the other hand the needlessly confusing, nearly non-existant plot cripples this movies' appeal from the very beginning. I could've dreamed up a better plot in five minutes, as could nearly anyone who watches this empty promise of a film.

Many Anime films suffer from weak or overly convoluted plots, yet still manage to be entertaining thanks to a cast of interesting characters. But the characters in ""Steamboy"" seem almost like afterthoughts. The main protagonist (Ray) spends the entire picture rushing about filled with exasperation and worry. His father has no personality to speak of, and his grandfather, much like Ray, is a character without depth, his only job in the film being to sabotage the work of his son. A philosophical conflict between the grandfather and the father is highlighted throughout the movie, but never goes anywhere.

In fact, among all the characters in ""Steamboy"" only ""Miss Scarlett"" has any potential, but her character is too contrived and implausible to be believable. Besides, her only job in the film is to hang around Ray, deliver the occasional cute line, and get in trouble. One keeps waiting for a single moment of character development to occur between her and Ray (Steamboy), especially since she starts inexplicably following him around from the moment they meet, but nothing ever develops.

For that matter, the only character development of any sort that happens at any time during the film is a last-minute reconciliation between the father and grandfather that occurs for no discernable reason.

As a huge Anime fan I can't say enough how disappointed I was in ""Steamboy"", especially since the incredible visuals and fascinating setting gave it such incredible potential. Rent it if you must, but whatever you do don't buy this DVD without seeing it first!",1124755200,4,2275,4.976315789473684

Lo bueno:

En Steamboy, uno puede poner pausa y sentir que en cada cuadro se contiene una obra de arte, despierta en nosotros una gran admiracin por el minuciosos y apasionado trabajo del equipo de produccin, quienes se comprometieron mas all de la norma y llenaron esta cinta de una vida y magia pocas veces alcanzaa en una cinta animada.

Lo malo:

Si bien la histora es buena y tiene una buena carga de emociones accin y suspenso, me paece que la premisa fundamental que est en disputa  y que motiva el actuar de los personajes (sobre el ideal del uso de la tecnologa)es poco profunda y carece de fuerza. Esto para m es la nica queja, es el punto que le resta esa estrella de la perfeccin.

Lo nuevo:

Una historia original y personajes realistas que son ms creibles que la mayora de los protagonistas de pelculas animadas debido a que no ecajan en los paradigmas tpicos del ""Malo y el Bueno"", sino que se perciben como seres humanos con distintas motivaciones, conflictos y deseos.

2307773,4,B0009P42S2,"Do you love steam? I mean do you REALLY love steam? Do you love pressure gauges and release valves and gears and pipes? If so ""Steamboy"" is the movie for you. The movie opens in a factory where the steam pressure has increased to a dangerous level. After the inevitable explosion the movie switches to its second scene, a factory with an uncontrolled buildup of steam. This is a movie that SERIOUSLY enjoys showing the effects of steam pressure. The knock against ""Steamboy"" is that it's visually stunning but lacking in story. For the first half of the movie I was ready to write a review disagreeing but at the half way mark the movie seemed to lose...steam?

""Steamboy"" takes place in Victorian era England featuring steam technology that never actually existed. At this point mythological industrial era technology has practically reached the level of genre having been used in more than a few movies and books most recently in ""The League of Extraordinary Gentleman"" and the unfortunate ""Wild Wild West"". The story revolves around the near magical steam ball, a bowling ball size object that contains enough pressure to power an entire building. This is the device that young Ray Steam uses to become the titular ""Steamboy"" although he doesn't don his flight suit and steam rocket until an hour and a half into the movie and even then only takes a few short flights. The last half hour of the movie seems to be an homage to steam pressure with expanding and exploding pipes and endless scenes of destruction and then the movie quickly ends.

The plot seems a bit threadbare which is a shame after the loving devotion spent on animation. Director Katsuhiro tomo seemed to be trying to make some kind of point about the place of science at the dawn of the industrial age but I wasn't sure what the point was. On one hand the Steam Castle was a technologic (if unfeasible) wonder but on the other hand the technology was used to create weapons which nearly destroy London. In the end the Steam Castle seemed to exist merely to demonstrate how much steel and glass could be lifted off the ground using steam.

""Steamboy"" has more than its fair share of powerful imagery including the re-introduction of Ray's father Eddie who, thanks to an explosion, seems to be practically steam powered himself. The movie is a step above the usual Japanese Anime but tomo still falls well short of the storytelling skills of a master like Hayao Miyazaki.",1124064000,2,2441,4.738823529411765
2307774,3,B0009P42S2,"Much has been made over the fact that the director of Steamboy is the same who directed the anime classic Akira.  As a fan of Akira from way back when I first saw it in '89, I was expecting first rate animation.  Steamboy didn't disappoint me, at least not there.

Ray Steam is the son and grandson of two of Victorian England's greatest living scientists and inventors.  One day some mysterious men from the O'Hara Corporation show up on his family's doorstep, asking for a package that has just arrived from Ray's grandfather who has been away on an expedition with his father.  Ray learns just in time however that these men are evil and that he must not let them have the contents; one ""steam ball"", which contains within itself enormous power.  Immediately the action ensues as Ray flees the Corporate men to deliver the steam ball back to his grandfather.  We follow along as Ray goes on a journey to find not only the answer the mystery of the steam ball, but also the answer to the question: what is the purpose of science - power, happiness, or something else?

This is a very realistic vision of Victorian England combined with some fantastically precocious machine technology which was intended to make for a very weird cinematic experience.  Too bad that this experience was thwarted time and again by a plot that was stretched too thin and dragged on too long.  The pacing alternated between long, lethargic stretches of dialog and frantic action sequences featuring steamy explosions, crashes and chases.  This story could have been --and should have been!-told in about 20 minutes less time.  It's as if nobody was editing this.

(Director's Cut, you say?  I respond:  there's a reason that God gave us editors.  Make better use of them!)

That it is a superb  technical achievement, I can't deny.  That it is one of the most elaborate animes ever made (as the dvd back cover trumpets) is without any doubt.  A visual feast, gorgeous cinematography (animaphotography?  Oh well...), incredible attention to details, genius of direction...yes, all of that and more.  But this film should be a lesson to directors everywhere; the best visuals in any medium cannot compensate for or transform an essentially boring story.

First, choose your script well!

2307775,5,B0009P42S2,"I really enjoyed this movie and I really can't add much that hasn't been covered in other positive reviews.  I found the movie to be entertaining and technically well done.  The animation and audio quality of the movie are pretty good.  I thought the music score was outstanding.  Perhaps more than any other animated film I have ever seen this movie feels like a live action film and not an animated film.  Some may see that as a problem.  I personally do not.  This is the kind of movie I could show to people not familiar with anime without feeling embarassed.  The movie does have its problems.  The story is perhaps average and there is little character development.  Don't expect this movie to be Akira II or Son of Akira.  This movie is more like the Rocketeer than anything.  This movie does have a message (or messages).  This is a ""message"" movie about the nature of technology and its use (or possible misuse).  Messages are subtle though.  Otomo doesn't feel the need in this movie beat you over the head with his point.  I personally like it that way.

I should mention that both the subtitled and english dubbed versions run the same length (126 minutes).  There are no cuts to the dubbed version.  That of course has been a worry to some since the theatrical dubbed version had a number of big cuts to its running time.  You do not have to worry about that with the R1 DVDs.  BTW, I found the dub to be pretty good.",1123113600,3,1430,4.444015444015444
2307776,4,B0009P42S2,"My biggest problem with this movie is the boy, Ray, is voiced by a woman. And it sounds like he's voiced by a woman. They should have gotten a child actor to do the voice if that's what they were going for. Not a female actress.

That said, the story is great but it drags on a bit long. The animation is just beautiful and everything is top notch.",1122768000,,348,4.043478260869565
2307777,2,B0009P42S2,"I will not repeat the details of the plot here. As the film starts, you're drawn into its alternate world where everything is powered by steam. The machines are fascinating!

There's no clear delineation of good and evil - apart, perhaps, from the armaments companies, who turn London into a disaster area for demo purposes. Unless, of course, you have the naive view that we'll all live in peace if people would just stop inventing and selling weapons ... which, unfortunately, might be the message some will take away from this movie, never having learned the lessons of history.

Anyway. The animation and scenery and creativity are superb. However, once the destruction starts, you lose all possibility of belief, since the scale of destruction is so vast. No arms dealers would dare put on such a show in such a location. It's supposed to show the destructive power of science in the wrong hands, but it reaches ridiculous proportions.

After about the halfway mark, you sense that it's gone on long enough, and you're just waiting for it to be over. Too many shots of steam pipes leaking and exploding, etc., too long to wrap up. If you have the patience, a lot of the imagery is awe-inspiring, though. But at the end you don't really care any more.",1122768000,6,1255,4.7214611872146115
