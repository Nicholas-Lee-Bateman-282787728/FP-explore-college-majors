8650627,2,B00JFXJZOA,"Dexter (Mark O'Neal) is a former special ops person who is now engaged to Lenka (Petra Bryant) a woman of Russian (?) origin. They have a pre-honeymoon in Turkey where she is abducted. The police treat Dexter as a murder suspect. Much of the film is told in flashbacks.

Yes, this is another ""Taken"" film as Dexter uses his  skills to find his future bride. Mark O'Neal is not convincing in his role. Even Simon Phillips, who I typically love, had trouble delivering his lines convincingly. The script didn't seem tight and lacked the promise  of the plot. The ending was a major WTF with a twist whose clues were sparse and ambiguous.  It lacks a decent scene to make the film.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Very brief nudity (Anais Alvarado?)",1427414400,,747,4.628787878787879
