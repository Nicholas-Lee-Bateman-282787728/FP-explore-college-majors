3091194,5,B0012KMFBO,"More of the best film comedy ever made by the best team from the best comedy movie company, Hal Roach. Indeed, this Volume contains their Academy Award Winner, The Music Box.

By 1932-34, they had successfuly transitioned from the faster-paced, more physical silents to sophisticated sound comedies, all worth owning.

Twice Two is really brilliant as the boys play the wives, retaining much of the male characterization. The editing is particularly brilliant here; also the voice overdubs, done by female actors. Funny that Stan's ""sister"" has the same ability to make a simple situation impossibly complex - she says crazy things at the Anniversary dinner while her ""brother"" totally messes up his task of buying strawberry ice-cream for dessert.

The Live Ghost has alot of Roach trouper-nemesis Walter Long, playing a Ship Captain who can't keep a crew because it's believed his vessel is haunted. For a while, he and Syan and Ollie are chums, as they are enlisted to trick seaman, from the local pub, into joining the ranks for a 10 port mission. A bit more rough stuff than usual, as Ollie brands a skillet to knock out men chasing Stan through the front door. Of all four entries here, let's say that this two-reeler is the only *near*-classic, as the violent slapstick is overdone.

County Hospital is perhaps not at the level of The Music Box, as a story, but every scene is xcellent leading up to the finale, a rather crude car-out-of-control sequence, as the back-drop footage is too far out of proportion. Billy Gilbert plays the Doctor who enters whispering and exits screaming at Laurel and Hardy - visitor Stan has struck again.",1274400000,4,1643,4.899280575539568

It's a very funny piece, but it is even worth a look just to see the steet scenes in 1930's Los Angeles.",1246406400,,306,4.186440677966102
3091198,5,B0012KMFBO,"Laurel and Hardy's best films were made at the Hal-Roach-Studios in the 1930's, because Stan Laurel wrote the scripts, directed the films, and Laurel & Hardy ad-libbed, created the comedy beyond the script as the cameras were rolling (50% was ad-libbed). This 10-volume set of talking-shorts (20-minute-films) is from the Hal-Roach-Studios. When L&H went to MGM, the big corporation, in the 1940's; other-people wrote the scripts, other-people directed, and L&H were not allowed to ad-lib.

L&H feature-films, their earliest full-length-talking-films (1-hour plus) made at the Hal-Roach-Studios are excellent too. I list these under the ""comment""-button below; noting which are Hal-Roach films.

There are L&H silent-films in the public-domain made before L&H came to the Hal-Roach-Studios, which are not good, because they were made before the two became friends and teamed-up. They play different characters, and some films only have Laurel and not Hardy, or vice-versa. There are some excellent, L&H silent-films, which are not in the public-domain, and which were made at the Hal-Roach-Studios. These are on the DVD-series ""The Lost Films of Laurel and Hardy""; about ten volumes. They are expensive on DVD. Many are on VHS cheap. You can find the titles on said DVD-series and then search VHS. Two excellent, L&H silent-short-films (20-min.) are ""Big Business"" and ""Soup to Nuts"" (Only a VHS search of ""Big Business"" brings it up).

On this DVD:

""The Music Box"", 1932
Laurel and Hardy attempt to carry a piano up the longest flight of stairs you have ever seen. Good.

""County Hospital"" 1932
Ollie is in the hospital. Stan tries to make him more comfortable with unexpected results. Later antics on their drive home from the hospital.
The comedy scenes in the hospital are excellent.

""The Live Ghost"" 1934
Laurel and Hardy are shanghaied (kidnapped) onto a ship set to sail for distant lands. The sailors believe the ship is haunted.

""Twice Two"", 1932
Laurel and Hardy marry each other's sister, who look like a female them.

I have also seen volume-10 of this talking-shorts-series, which also has 4-shorts. ""The Hoose-Gow"" was very good. ""They go Boom"" and ""Unaccustomed As We Are"" are pleasant. ""The Chimp"" is not believable for not using a real chimp.

Volume-5 has the short ""Helpmates"", which is my favorite.

All these talking-shorts are from the Hal-Roach-Studios; though all the shorts are not excellent. From the four volumes that I have purchased; it looks like they put at least one excellent short on each four-short DVD, two of the shorts will be pleasant, and one not good.

Check out the DVD: ""Laurel & Hardy: The Essential Collection"" here on Amazon, which I discovered in July 2011. This 10-disc set includes most of Laurel & Hardy's talkie shorts and features produced by Hal Roach between 1929 and 1940.
