8725771,5,B012AN1OS6,"Great transfer, good audio no complaints!

The film itself is very good. If you haven't gone through Tsui Hark's filmography this is probably a pretty good place to start as it has his unique blend of adventure, comedy, action, and political themes rolled into one cool Chinese graphic novel come to life as a true HK cinema confection. The entire cast did a great job, the sets are ambitious, and it's overall a fun ride worth watching.",1460592000,,437,4.675324675324675
8725772,3,B012AN1OS6,"Set in Manchuria in the early 1930's, a small army is controlled by an emperor in exile, forced to this far corner of China by invading Imperial Japan. Dr. Cho is a skilled medicine man who discovers a plot to manufacture poison gas, and is forced to help a group of rebels try and destroy the factory where it is produced.

 The movie is a comedy, with frequent action sequences involving furious gun battles and explosions. It is fun and exciting, even if it does almost resemble the Three Stooges at times.",994291200,3,509,4.521739130434782
