8257152,3,B00152M7YY,"One of the best comedies on TV. The only reason I gave it a 3 star is because it is going to the GOD/Jesus jokes a little to soon. How is it that there are many religon's out there, but they only make fun of the Christians? It really bothers me! Stay away from GOD/Jesus there has to be more in this world to make fun of or joke around with.

Also, be very carefull this is the same guy who makes Family Guy and sells in Volumes NOT seasons. Look on Amazon and you will see you are not getting all the episodes! Rip off!",1223510400,,520,3.9056603773584904
8257153,5,B00152M7YY,"While many would disagree STRONGLY with what I'm about to say, I believe American Dad is BETTER than Family Guy.  Yes that's right- while the style of comedy is more or less the same, it's in the *storytelling* where I believe American Dad surpasses Family Guy.  Every episode flows wonderfully with a creative, fun, and exciting story, which is something Family Guy doesn't do very often.

Family Guy is usually crammed with too many one-liners, that distract from the story and make me lose focus (ESPECIALLY when a joke carries on for several moments, practically ruining the joke right then and there!- there's none of that in American Dad).

While I'm very happy the show has produced 60 episodes so far, hopefully another batch of episodes is coming for the 2008-2009 season.  This show is way too good to miss out on.  People who dismiss American Dad as just another Family Guy with less interesting characters are WAY off.  The storylines are more focused in this show compared to Family Guy.

I honestly believe Family Guy has run its course.  Once that show reached 80 episodes or so, I started getting sick of it.  It's just the same thing every episode- try to tell a story, and stop midway through to say something really bizarre or unfunny.  Don't get me wrong, many of the jokes ARE funny, but it's not as consistently interesting and funny as American Dad.  Chris has a horrible high-pitched voice, Meg never changes, Peter says the dumbest things ever and has been doing so for years (not nearly as funny as Homer Simpson when he acts the same way).  Only Stewie and Brian are probably the two best characters in the show that continue to make me laugh.

So make the right choice and purchase the first three seasons of American Dad and laugh until your stomach hurts.",1222646400,5,1785,4.67948717948718

8257155,5,B00152M7YY,"Creator Seth McFarlane is a genius. After the brilliance of his ""Family Guy"", he gives us ""American Dad"" - which I can only call the twisted, darker, and more bizarre cousin of ""Family Guy"". Incidentally, this is all you need to know if at all you want to decide whether to buy this on DVD or not. You need to be a little 'out there' to appreciate it, and if you like ""Ren & Stimpy"" and ""Little Britain"", you will gravitate toward this almost immediately - such is the impact of its' hilarious one liners.

Of course, you probably know what American Dad is all about - an all-American conservative Republican father who harbors a very decidedly insane family - his petulant blonde wife who vacillates between political beliefs, his democratic liberal daughter, his annoyingly sweet son, their resident Roswell-Alien, and a talking German Goldfish called Klaus. Put these characters together and you have sheer magic.

The one-liners are what will get you - Roger the Alien has the BEST one-liners. There is so much the writers could do with this character, and they go all out - everytime you think they couldn't get stranger, Roger ups the ante and does something even more ludicrous (as an example : one episode has the entire family milking Roger the Alien, and using his breast-milk as the 'secret ingredient' in the mashed potatoes they serve their Church Congregation!). Its this sort of 'far out' humor that contributes to the magnetic appeal this show has.

Also, there is a lot of 'adult' humor - particularly in the episode where the lead character wants his son to stay away from ""the pleasures of the hand"", but instead becomes a masturbation-addict himself. Then there is controversial 2-part episode where the entire family is send to Saudi Arabia, and the novel take on Islam and terrorism might alienate you here, if you are at all 'sensitive'. For regular viewers of the show however, this is a breeze.

Note that the following subjects are all dealt with on the show, albeit in extremely honest & tongue-in-cheek ways : incest, homosexuality, abortion, pregnancy, inter-species relationships, the death penalty, Islam, terrorism, religious fanaticism, Christianity, Satan Worship, and alternative lifestyle propaganda. If any of this is ""not your bag"", then American Dad might shock you!

Five Stars. This is animation television at its' best, and at least three times as good as ""Family Guy"" (I find the dialog and writing on American Dad to be more fresh and inspired than Family Guy)",1211932800,2,2504,4.924170616113744
