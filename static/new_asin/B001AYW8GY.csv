3474381,5,B001AYW8GY,"Google me is the real fun movie, I loved it. When I saw it I was surprised to see the idea. I have googled my name tons of times and i am sure we all do it all the time. But only this director(Jim) can imagine and work on this idea and make a documentary out of it.

I would give it ***** for wonderful idea, ***** for superb story and 100% satisfaction.

3474385,3,B001AYW8GY,"Just about everyone I know has checked themselves out on Google now and then. And, just about everyone stumbles upon someone else with the same name. It's fun to check them out, perhaps on Facebook or see if they have their own web site for business. Google Me takes this a huge step further by traveling to other states or countries to find the Google-twin!

Jim Killeen found a look-alike, an Irish priest, a creepy swinger, and more. Some were more interesting than others, but this film was a worthy effort to explore human nature at random by meeting namesakes. Definitely worthy of your time.",1393459200,,598,4.695238095238095

3474387,5,B001AYW8GY,A slice of life.  It addresses on the diversity in people and still the commonality we share.  There is a 'realness' to it.,1392681600,,123,4.304347826086956
3474388,1,B001AYW8GY,I really didn't enjoy the movie. Just didn't seem like it was a believable move for me. Could be wrong!,1391817600,,103,4.2
3474389,4,B001AYW8GY,"Googling your own name is something, I feel, that most of us have done, so a movie about it has to be really good to pass muster.  This one does. There is humor, thoughtfulness, philosophy and a darn good story.  Jim Killeen probably is one of the few filmmakers who could have made this movie of googling ones own name to find others with exactly the same name on Google. His honesty and good humor came through enough to other Jim Killeens to convince them to be interviewed and filmed with no promises of fame or fortune.  Some surprisingly intimate details of the lives of the different Killeen families resulted. This a good movie and I recommend you watch.",1391817600,,662,4.546218487394958

3474391,1,B001AYW8GY,"Jim Killeen is a bored, failed actor who owns his own business and has a bunch of money. He decided to self-finance this pointless, ego-stroke of a documentary that portrays his self-appointed mission to meet some other people with the same name as him. No insight is gained into Google or even any of the other Jim Killeens. It's more of an excuse for the director to have done a film so that he doesn't feel like he's wasted his life, which he kind of admits to at the beginning. The irony of this vanity project is that all of the other Jim Killeens come off as much cooler and more genuine than ""our"" Jim Killeen. He just seems like an idiot with money. He makes awful jokes while mugging to the camera and sets up obvious comedic ""bits"" to pad out certain parts of the movie, like when he goes to visit the Scottish Jim Killeen and tries to figure out how to drive through a traffic circle.

But all that is not reason enough for the one star rating. He earned that through exploiting his family for his Scientologist agenda. His older brother and sister are both mentally ill, suffering from schizophrenia among other things. They take multiple medications to stabilize their moods and keep them from becoming delusional, but naturally they're never going to be normal. It's just the way it is.

But for Scientologist Jim, of course, it's all psychiatry's fault for screwing up his brother and sister's lives with their evil brain medicines. He thinks they'd be much better off without the medications keeping them from going off the deep end. I guess they just need to have their body thetans cleared with some Dianetics therapy or whatever. Ha, ha! Stupid psychiatrists and their drugs. They don't even realize that our bodies are infested with the souls of ancient aliens blown up by Xenu and whatever other horrible, science-fiction BS garbage Scientologists believe. Yeah, so when I got to the part of this doc in which ol' Jim puts his bro and sis in front of the camera just to try and make actual medical science look bad, that's when I knew this was one of the worst documentaries I'd ever seen.

Just don't waste your time. At best, you'll be bored. At worst, if you're sensitive to these sorts of things like me, you'll get angry at what a tool he is.",1389916800,8,2268,4.553921568627451
3474392,2,B001AYW8GY,Editing of interviews was weird.  Nothing revolutionary in the idea or how it was produced.  Wouldn't recommend for to someone,1389657600,,126,5.25
3474393,3,B001AYW8GY,"2008NR: Considering the advances in Google technology since Dave Gorman's ""Googlewhack Adventure"" in 2003, this story had LOTS of promise. However, even moderate expectations for this nothing-really-new-to-see-here documentary were too high. It's more of a biographical piece about how a guy with too much time on his hands rationalizes video recording his (uninteresting) travel adventure.

3474394,5,B001AYW8GY,"This was exceptionally well done and thought provoking. I really had not planned on watching the whole movie in one sitting, but after watching the first ten minutes, I was hooked. I loved the premise of this documentary and appreciated its authenticity from beginning to end. Well done, Jim Killeen.",1389398400,,300,5.02

3474400,3,B001AYW8GY,The subject matter was a little weak.  Kind of fun for the maker of the film but not as interesting for the masses to watch I would think.  At least not for me.  The film didn't make much of a point.,1386374400,,199,3.8048780487804876
3474401,4,B001AYW8GY,"I choose four stars because the movie was in part entertaining, from the perspective of the story teller and the way the story unfolded with out the high polish of Hollywood,  the storyline and people were down to earth.  A person (Jim) was trying to see how the his other name sakes were living, their lives and if they were related.
From a technical standpoint,  the concept is dated, and was more relevant when the movie was first released. By now everything we do and post on the internet - including this review is picked up by various search engines and searchable, including our selves.
I for one would never spend effort or money running down people who have my same name but it was interesting to see Jim busy doing it.",1384300800,,728,4.5

3474403,5,B001AYW8GY,"Really liked the Wrap Up. Especially enjoyed the narrative and film progression. The movie educated us about people, but also educated us on the process of making a film, and the struggle of getting through to people.

Apple Final Cut Pro & JVC H100 camera. Awesome insight on the eyes the world was being watched with.",1377907200,,319,4.696428571428571
3474404,1,B001AYW8GY,"This felt like watching a cheesy 1980's production made for classrooms. The idea is ingesting, just wish it wasn't so repeatative. It could  be very week summarized into a Ted talk.",1366416000,,181,4.838709677419355
3474405,3,B001AYW8GY,I would definitely watch this movie again.  It points out the best that society has to offer! Nice choice!! :),1364601600,,110,4.5
3474406,5,B001AYW8GY,"I google myself often, but there are not many of me. With Jim's film though he opens up a new perspective on googling's oneself: finding out his ancestry and making new friends with Google. Nice film, touching a nerve. I enjoyed it.",1364515200,,232,4.5476190476190474

3474408,3,B001AYW8GY,"I absolutely loved this movie... So why three stars?
I would have given it a five star if the film maker hadn't used the movie as a vehicle to promote his political and spiritual views.  To me it seemed like he only added the Q & A at the end so he could express his personal views; it turned me off.",1363910400,,300,3.918032786885246

Jim Killeen did, too, then he visited some of them, did some DNA testing, and then they had a reunion in Killeen, Texas.  That's the movie in a nutshell, and while it's mechanical in places, it opens up a new thought process for family research.  It's a fun adventure, and you'll enjoy it, while thinking you should google yourself.",1363478400,,424,4.626666666666667

3474411,5,B001AYW8GY,"Jim Killeen -

I really do hope you read this review as it is not often I write a review. I am not a social person. I am turning 26 next month with little social life as I work from home. However...

  Watching this film made a significant impact in my life that answered many questions for me regarding my thoughts on the meaning of life and what is important. I really enjoyed the glimpse into the lives of every one of the Jim's in the documentary.

Honestly, watch this video. It is exceptional, inspiring, uplifting, revealing & insightful.

Good job Jim, I hope to see more documentaries from you!",1361145600,10,603,4.4363636363636365
3474412,5,B001AYW8GY,Great documentary! It was very interesting to take such a simple concept and make a whole movie about it. Made me want to google my name and find out who shares it with me.,1360368000,,172,4.088235294117647
3474413,3,B001AYW8GY,"I know you can't choose who has your name, but you can choose, that after finding out they are a swinger, to not interview them. That Jim creeped me out big time. I am glad that there was the x-wife in an interview, to get her point of view. But, why choose a swinger that tells you that BEFORE the interview?

If you take the swinger out (I skipped over the whole section where the swingers started to describe swinging etc), it's quite a fun production to watch! Dynamic, and gets you wishing you could ask a few questions of all the Jims as well! :)",1358467200,,552,4.2075471698113205
3474414,5,B001AYW8GY,"This documentary is very interesting.  The cast of characters is entertaining, from a detective to a Catholic priest.  The film maker travels all over the world, telling the stories of people who share his name.

The thing I like most about the movie is when he asks each person, ""What is man's purpose?"".  The answers vary greatly, and it really reflects where they are in life and what their view of the world is.  It may not be a high budget documentary, but it is very entertaining and something you probably won't forget.",1358121600,,526,4.612903225806452
3474415,5,B001AYW8GY,A warm and funny movie full of rich stories about life. I highly recommended watching this movie when you are in need of feeling more connected to the world.,1341619200,,157,4.448275862068965
3474416,4,B001AYW8GY,"I'll admit that when I first stumbled across this film, I thought it'd be rather mundane and boring.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It's a really interesting concept.  Maybe it's been done before, but I think every person could make this film and it would still be special and enjoyable.  Who hasn't googled themselves before?  To think about other people sharing your name spread across the world is a pretty incredibly concept.  Never before have we had such technology at our fingertips.  It's a film about the universal human experience--we come from incredibly different walks of life, but we can still share so much.  It's a comment on the growth of and continuing work on technology and how it influences our lives.  I think it was a great film and I certainly enjoyed it.

Why four stars?  Well, I think when Jim (filmmaker) began to explore his siblings illness, he made his view incredibly apparent.  While I certainly respect his viewpoint, it came across as out of place in this film, at least to me.  Still, do not let that impact your opinion on this film.  It's definitely worth a view.",1340755200,,1100,4.721052631578948
3474417,5,B001AYW8GY,"A great movie that restores my faith in humanity to go beyond our tiny differences and to see the important things we all share in common.  The filmmaker provides a very honest appraisal of himself, his intentions and finds meaning in his search.  I only wonder about the few Killeens that refused to participate; would they change their minds after seeing the movie?  I would think so... I hope Jim has a long and successful career as a moviemaker.  He deserves it.",1321228800,,466,4.646341463414634
3474418,5,B001AYW8GY,"I was very moved by the filmmakers apt observation about how we become ""families"" with those whom we love regardless of our lineage. Well done Jim! :)",1266019200,,150,4.592592592592593
3474419,4,B001AYW8GY,"Think of the possibilities. If you were to track down people who share your name, people from all over the globe, and really get to know them...what would you learn? What would you experience?

This is not just a documentary. It is a biographical, educational, entertaining experience and a little bit wonderful and amazing.

Jim Killeen (you know, the one who made the movie) is not a professional film producer. He is an ""ordinary"" guy who set out to make a film. As it turns out, he produces an extraordinary cross section of interesting lives from around the world and packages it in a way that allows you to experience it as if you were in the room. It is exactly what the film industry needs...fresh, exciting ideas from minds like that of Jim Killeen.

This was quite a project. I'm glad I saw it.

If you're sitting here wondering if you should watch it...stop wondering, rent the movie, grab a snack and a drink and enjoy the show.

You made a pretty cool film, Jim!

3474420,5,B001AYW8GY,"It's real, interesting, and fun to watch.  Reminds you of the good in people and brings you to reality while getting you to think about the purpose of life.  It takes you to several different places around the world to reflect on others' perspectives and lives.  Very satisfying and as many critics seem to say, ""a breath of fresh air.""",1263427200,7,336,4.566666666666666
3474421,3,B001AYW8GY,"""Dave Gorman's Googlewhack Adventure"" was released in 2003. Here we are 6 years later, and someone takes the exact same idea and repeats it. I know Hollywood doesn't believe in originality, but do we have to have indie documentary remakes?",1247961600,12,239,5.0
8280279,5,B001AYW8GY,"Finally bought my own copy! Excellent story, engaging, makes you think in a ""good"" way. Wrote Jim Killeen after seeing this the first time, got e-mail back promptly. He makes some excellent points that may raise some personal questions for you as the viewer, but it also maintains the ""entertaining"" side of the serious quest and the sometimes serious segments of the movie. You'll like it. Not your typical documentary style movie! Something REAL for a change.",1460764800,,461,5.0
8280280,4,B001AYW8GY,"This was a fun and lighthearted documentary that I watched on a whim while flipping through the documentary choices here on Amazon.  I especially found the check-in scene at the hotel - while seemingly staged - funny and symbolic of the message of the majority of the film, that the purpose of life is human connection.

These seemingly disparate men scattered from the corners of the globe (if you don't count half of the populated continents), find that they can quickly and deeply discover a connection to another human being that most of us probably willingly choose to ignore at the first whiff of genuine interaction.  The fact that so many of the Jim's stated the purpose of life was to - in a nutshell - be kind, helpful, and loving to your fellow man is a wonderful focus LA Jim chooses to accentuate throughout the film.

The film lost me momentarily, however, when Killeen explores his own family to present the contrast he has been building toward: is family who you are related to, or who you are drawn to?  Jim shows us his oldest siblings, who are suffering mightily with a debilitating psychological disorder.  Killeen states that the real disorder is the medical community that is treating them.  It is no surprise then that he claims his ""religion"" is Scientology - a psuedoreligion at best - an organization seemingly dedicated to discrediting generations of sound medical research and history in an effort to bolster it's own shaky tenants.  There is even a guest appearance by Sky Dayton, Earthlink founder and noted Scientologist, early in the film that seems incongruous with Killeen's assertions that he was a very small fish in a very big ocean called Los Angeles.

Luckily, while that could have ruined an otherwise light and utterly watchable flick, it is quickly glossed over in the midst of what proves to be the best few minutes of the film: a smash cut of the various Jims answering questions both personal and generic.  This is the heart of the documentary, and it is presented for such a disappointingly brief amount of screen time.  This is a gold mine, and the surface is barely scratched.  It allows the viewer to see what Jim has discovered in a microcosm: that we are, at heart, basically good people trying to make the best choices we can, and living with the consequences of those choices.  It could have lasted 20 minutes, and still not been enough time to fully explore this idea.

Near the end of the film, while the various Jims are making chili and watching a rodeo, LA Jim eventually comes to an answer, one that is summed up in the following snippet:

""People are basically good... family is what you decide it is... I feel more connected in the world."" ~Jim Killeen, LA.

It is a sentiment that many of us undoubtedly long for as the world grows ever more connected digitally, while we paradoxically make ourselves more isolated via these connections.",1404518400,,2899,4.7335984095427435
8280281,3,B001AYW8GY,The social experiment started out somewhat interesting but I felt the documentary started to drag on after some time.
