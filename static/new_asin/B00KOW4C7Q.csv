8660517,5,B00KOW4C7Q,"I really enjoyed this adventure. I wasn't expecting so many twists and turns, as well as humor laced throughout the fast-paced story. Great cast as well, and I won't be surprised to see both the leads' stars ascend. Jonny Cruz is mega-sexy, and the blond is funny, cute and really great in the challenging role. I also appreciated the unique and creative ways that the villains -- not really a spoiler -- end up dying. One expects certain cliches from adventure movies, and this one is far more creative, and keeps you both smiling and on the edge of your seat. A great deal of fun!",1427760000,2,582,4.5
8660518,4,B00KOW4C7Q,"This action flick is a great Saturday afternoon guilty pleasure! The plot centers around a young urban explorer (Jonny Cruz) who is blackmailed into penetrating the secrets of a derelict old building just as it is scheduled to be imploded. The producers found an actual downtown Dallas demolition site and used the condemned old building as the primary set for the movie. If you enjoy spotting supporting actors from other movies and TV shows, you will find Gregory Jbara (Bluebloods) and Steve Railsback (Helter Skelter) in this one. Some fairly attractive young female stars grace the flick as well. Lots of action and explosions packed into a pretty confined space. Worth your time and $.",1412553600,2,691,5.017391304347826
