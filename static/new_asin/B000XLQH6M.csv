I decided to chance it since there were warnings that it might not but I love RBD and realized that if my DVD player didn't want to play it, I could just buy a universal DVD player.......didn't have that problem and it came in great condition. Like new and is one of their best performances after live in Rio. Really like dulce's performance of no pares and the poem she reads before it",1458950400,,413,4.2405063291139244
8228727,4,B000XLQH6M,"Finally, let me be the 1st and probably only to submit a review on this RBD Import DVD.  I had been dying for a long time for someone else to post a review, but now that I finally acquired my own copy for a resonable price, allow me to share my opinion.  And yes, this DVD plays just fine in the US and Region 1.

In case your curious, I have also posted some quite thorough reviews of the other recent RBD/Rebelde DVD releases of the last 2 or 3 years.

Now, Hecho En Espaa:

First of all, let me say, now that I have every RBD that you can get over here in the US, there is always 1 thing I personally hold my breath for every time I pop a disc in for the very 1st time.  Will it be anamorphic or won't it.  In other words, will the letterbox image take up my full 50"" HDTV screen or won't it. Well thank goodness Tour Celestial 2007 Hecho En Espaa is only the 2nd RBD DVD that does.  Live in Rio is the only other.  Actually, in many ways this DVD is best compared to the Live in Rio concert DVD, they are virtual cousins.

The last 2 most recent RBD DVDs had very atrocious subpar picture quality.  Greatest Hits and La Familia were such sloppy eyesores.  But Live in Rio (LIR) beats out Hecho En Espaa (HEE) and is the gold standard out of all the RBD releases to date.  Yes HEE is anmorphic, but it still has some issues.  The concert was very obviously filmed using some low budget, probably SD quality video cameras.  On are large TV images can be rather less than sharp practially always.  But the picture in HEE especially suffers during the very dark scenes.  During those parts you will notice some very obvious banding and other digital artifacting errors if you have a large HDTV.  It's really bad, but it doesn't necessary ruin the entire experience.

The sound is actually rather good.  It comes with both a 2.0 stereo as well as 5.1 audio track.  Listening with headphones I could very easily pick out every instrument in the band and notice the little improvisation and other quirks people tend to look for in a live performance to distinguise the music from the studio versions.  The members from RBD sing pretty good, but almost curiously too good!  If you have watched all of their previous live DVD's, some of the singing vocals could be rather lacking at times.  But I don't know what they did in post production, but much of the singing is notable better here.  Sure, every now and then it sounds like some backing vocal parts are pre-recorded, but that's that necessarily a deal breaker.

But 1 performance to stand out to me as rather poor though. This is sadly by far the worst of Dulce's 3 performances of ""No Pares"" on DVD.  She does 1 of the worst jobs of trying to play the guitar and sing at the same time I have ever seen by an artist.  I don't know who forced her to go on stage and attempt to play that instrument because it was soooo unnecessary and very distracting.  But then, after she (thank god) eventually puts down the guitar, you notice that mainly just for this song they add some kind of sonic reverb to her already naturally fine singing voice and it just mucks up the whole song.  But I'm just nitpicking 1 song of many otherwise fine songs on this DVD.

The choreography of the new numbers added to the set list look a little awkward and not rehearsed as much, surprise, surprise since this is most likely true.  Also, you can tell RBD has been doing this whole touring thing for quite a few years now.  There are times when it seems like different members aren't really that much into their job on stage any more.  I mean, I'm not upset or anything, I completely understand.  I'm just saying you can tell that in certain songs, certain members are only singing and dancing at about 60-70%.

1 thing that bothered me slightly with LIR is that since the concert obviously took place in Brazil, a few of the nubmers were altered into Portugese.  Well no offense to the country or that language, but I just prefer my RBD songs sung in Spanish the way I'm used to.  But while LIR had some excellent subtitles in Spanish, English, & Portugese, I guess it should be expected that this Import only DVD has no subtitles whatsoever.

1 thing that really distinguishes HEE from LIR is that the concert from Spain includes many of the English language songs off of the Rebels CD.  While not my favorite RBD CD, I actually really, really enjoyed seeing and hearing these particular songs live.  And the regular RBD band actually played some pretty good versions of these particular songs live.  The regeton song ""Money, Money"" was a very welcom change of pace from the typical RBD repertoire.

Now why I have to buy this CD as an import only is well beyond me.  It's differences are notable enough that any fan of RBD here in the states wouldn't mind picking this 1 up.  Another complaint I have is why in the world is this concert split onto 2 separate DVDs?  There's exactly 1 hour of footage on each disc.  Could we not just put the whole 2 hours on 1 disc and save me a little hassle?

If you're planning on getting this DVD, just be sure to monitor the price for a week or 2 and try to find it for about $20 and no more.

1 last note, what is up with Anahi and the fairy obsession?
