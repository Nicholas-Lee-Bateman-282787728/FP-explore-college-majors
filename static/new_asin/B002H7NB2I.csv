3926656,5,B002H7NB2I,I haven't see this movie for years. I always enjoyed it. I was thrilled when I found it on DVD. I ordered it right away. We loved it all over again.,1369785600,,148,3.806451612903226
3926657,5,B002H7NB2I,The story is great if you are in old race cars or the turbine car. I would recommend this to anyone who loves cars.,1366156800,,115,3.8333333333333335
3926658,4,B002H7NB2I,"Cars, girls, comedy and racing action in this oh-so-60's classic! It's like a beach movie for the racing set.
Featuring the famous Chrysler Turbine Car (and many other Chrysler products), this movie shows a different time and older values.
I'll grant that the master was slightly faded and VHS-quality at best, but the reproduction is reasonably clear and the sound is excellent. I saw one tiny video glitch about three-quarters the way through, that's nothing to complain about when you consider this is the only way you're going to find this movie on DVD.

Kudos to ACME-TV for making these rarities available!",1365638400,,612,5.0
3926659,4,B002H7NB2I,"All characters are young, good looking and do a credible acting job. I think it might appeal more to younger adults as opposed to middle aged or mature adults.",1365120000,,159,4.517241379310345
3926660,5,B002H7NB2I,It's set in the early 1960's so it's a reflection of an entirely different time - but the cars are great.  I'm a big fan of the Chrysler turbine car - have been since I was a kid and it was too - so that's the big draw for me on this movie.,1362614400,,240,3.5283018867924527
3926661,3,B002H7NB2I,"I liked the movie. It was just as I remebered it. However, the video was of poor quality. It looked as though it were copied from a bad VHS tape. To bad the video couldn't have been better. If it was digitally remastered they need someone else to do it.",1361491200,,253,4.08
3926662,5,B002H7NB2I,"Lots of fun and some great scenery in the final race.  Brings back memories,  wish I was a kid again.",1355270400,,101,4.0
3926663,4,B002H7NB2I,"This movie is not an Academy Award type film, but it is a good, family quality film that does what a good movie should.  I entertains.  It is a very nice period piece that brings back wonderful memories of the '60s for me.  There is a lot of clean, family humor, great classic cars and very good performances from solik actors like Doug McLure.  I have already watched it twice since I got it and look forward to watching it again and again.",1346889600,4,441,4.27710843373494
3926664,2,B002H7NB2I,"OK, let's hear it for us car guys. You know, the kind of men who like fast cars. This movie is very short on substance, but very enjoyable. The DVD transfer is not very good, but the manufacturer explains that this was the best they could do in the opening sequence. I have seen this movie on cable and I am sure I have seen better. Having said that, I like this movie because of the vehicles. The jet powered dragster, and the turbine car by Chrysler. James Darrin and Doug McClure are rivals then become friends. The comic banter between the characters are priceless. This a typical 60's movie, but I like it for the vintage technology presented. I gave it a low rating because the 40+ year old movie to DVD transfer is almost unwatchable. For true fans only.",1345075200,,761,4.404255319148936
3926665,5,B002H7NB2I,I saw this film in the 60's and subsequently the Chrysler Gas Turbine car featured in the film in Hollywood at the corner of Highland and Franklin.  My son and I were watching HBO one evening in the early 90's and the film was playing.  It was getting late and we couldn't finish watching to the end and went to bed.  It seems the premise of the gas turbine engine has tweaked a few noses and all information has been quieted.  This vehicle would solve the oil problems in this country as it was purported to be able run on anything from ethanol to vodka.  Where is it now and where is the movie that featured it?  The movie was entertaining with James Darren and Pamela Tiffin around the same era as the Beach Party genre of Frankie and Annette but with a solution to America's dependence on foreign oil. A slightly smaller version of the car would make a polluting (to manufacture and destroy) Prius seem like a gas guzzler!,1299542400,3,926,4.385964912280702
8370188,5,B002H7NB2I,"The Lively Set from 1964 is an entertaining film you can watch with anybody. James Darren, Joannie Sommers ,and Doug McClure are great together. This was made in the time when teen films were very innocent.",1391558400,2,206,4.75
8370189,4,B002H7NB2I,The Lively Set was pretty  good it was more about the cars  and I thought it needed a better plot to it.,1385856000,,104,3.6818181818181817
8370190,5,B002H7NB2I,"I remember watching this when I was a teenager and just loving it!  Because it is so old, the picture gets a little rough to view in places.  Just a fun movie to watch.",1382918400,,168,3.911764705882353
8370191,4,B002H7NB2I,"I had a vague memory of this film (or rather scenes from it) from when I watched it on the late show when I was about 6 years old. The scenes I recalled (Spoiler Alert!) were the Salt Flats spinout and the hood flying off! I had wondered for years what the name of this movie was that I had a vague, fond memory of. I had always thought the car was a white, 1969 Ford Galaxie (hey, it was a 6 year old's memory!).

One day, while researching the Chrysler Turbine car, I came across this movie. Wanting to see the car in action, I watched it via a poor quality, open source posting. While the quality of the download was questionable, the quality of production was acceptable considering the time.

While the story is your typical 1960's cliche, teenage, fast car type, the film is entertaining. James Darren and Doug McClure put out some fine acting and even the supporting actors aren't bad (with exception of Joanie Sommers, whose acting is weak and her singing leaves a little bit to be desired).

The true stars of the film are the Chrysler Gas Turbine Engine and the Turbine Car. This film was obviously produced to showcase the Gas Turbine Engine idea and to show what the Gas Turbine Car was capable of (or rather what Chrysler thought it was capable of). While some of the ""facts"" expressed by the ""designer"" Casey Owens, are a bit of a stretch, they are essentially correct.

For a 95 minute commercial for the Chrysler Gas Turbine Engine and Turbine Car, it is a pretty good film. I intend to buy a copy just to add it to my collection of 1960's, teenage, car/racing films.",1381968000,,1583,4.429553264604811
8370192,1,B002H7NB2I,The Quality of this movie is awful.  It is absolutely unwatchable.  Very disappointed as I have never had this problem before from any other movie I have ordered. I would suggest to anyone out there to find another source if you want this movie.,1381795200,,245,4.545454545454546
8370193,5,B002H7NB2I,theirs other boxed sets of movies I want but the last I got was smallVille three seasons and waited a couple years to view  was damaged so am afraid to buy more than one movie at a time .as cardboard scratches dvds. If you ever get stargate in plastic holders I would buy it.,1378512000,,275,4.092592592592593
8370194,3,B002H7NB2I,"Although I love this movie, the quality was not up to par with anything I have bought from Amazon. I will buy another copy from a different place where I have bought movies before and I know will get a better copy.",1376179200,,214,4.119047619047619
8370195,5,B002H7NB2I,I have been waiting to see the movie on cable for years and it never showed. Bought this and was exactly as expected. It is a digital version of a 60's movie so expect it to be not up to 2013 digital quality. But it was still worth it.,1375228800,,235,3.816326530612245
8370196,1,B002H7NB2I,I was very pleased with the early delivery. I had been looking for this movie for quite some time. I was very dissatisfied with the poor quality of the DVD.,1374710400,,156,4.233333333333333
8370197,3,B002H7NB2I,"Average storyline, boys and cars and girls (in that order !),  but fun to see different cars (like the few real shots of the Chryslar Turbine Car in action) and real racing over highways _ like they did back then, but could not really do now.  Fun with details, etc.",1373500800,,266,4.3
