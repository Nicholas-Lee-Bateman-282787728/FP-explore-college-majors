8037599,1,B00062IDVA,"This video was extremely basic and presented in a cheesy manner. Too much laughing and giggling and not enough substance. I guess I'd expected to learn something new. I believe the common public is aware of how to use a plunger and perform a utility hunt in order to label their breaker box. In addition, I'd expected real ""live"" repairs instead of phony simulations. Don't waste your money on this DVD.",1255737600,,403,4.690140845070423
8037600,4,B00062IDVA,"I agree with Lena and Zany about the corny, repetitive presentation.  Many PBS productions labor under the assumption that the topic is so boring that it needs to be spiced with amusing banter.

The DVD is geared toward those who know nothing about home repair or perhaps have never even seen a tool.  In that respect the instruction is good. The presentation is also notable because the principals are none other than wives of a CIA director and an FBI director!  They sure seem like down-to-earth gals for being married to captains of bureaucracy.

At the end they deliver an important message about women supporting each other and affordable housing for the masses.",1189382400,3,668,4.876106194690266
8037601,3,B00062IDVA,"Though I know a little less about basic home repairs, I did learn a few things. I agree with they were too chatty, making too many corny jokes & making a big to-do about every little thing & repeating themselves, such as ""If your window is stuck, you can use a pizza cutter... YES A PIZZA CUTTER!!!! Yes, the one you cut pizzas with...."" This made watching a bit tedious. Yes, they added some warm feeling by trying to sound like they are ad-libbing, but you can hear the script anyhow.
I'm sure there's better out there. I rented this at my library.",1143158400,5,550,4.349514563106796
8037602,1,B00062IDVA,"This video was a real disappointment to me.  I was hoping to learn some basic plumbing repairs, etc., but the two hosts spent most of the video chatting and repeating things they'd already said.  When they finally did get around to talking repairs, the topics were so basic that I think most people over the age of about 14 would either already know how to do them or could certainly figure out how to do them on their own.  How to plunge a toilet?  How to level a washing machine?  I thought I was pretty unhandy with a wrench, but these were hardly what I would call ""repair"" tips.",1120348800,15,583,4.3119266055045875
