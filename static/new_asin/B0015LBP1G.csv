8258981,2,B0015LBP1G,"The ""Tagged Classic"" series are old WWE PPV events that they package together & release as a set together for those who didn't catch them back when they originally were released. And to answer the big question surrounding every release of a PPV since July of last year is that Chris Benoit has not been edited out of the events. These are just re-releases of the original PPV DVD events.

Backlash:
Goldberg arrived in WWE the night after WrestleMania & made it clear that ""Who's Next"" was The Rock setting up their first ever encounter against each other here in The Rock being his usual entertaining self to the point that the crowd started to favor Rock & turn on Goldberg as the match went on. WWE Champion Brock Lesnar defended his champion against John Cena who was close to his hometown looking for revenge against the man who injured his leg & put him out of action for months in a competitive bout that played to both men's strengths at that time. Other matches include Triple H & Ric Flair & Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels & Booker T & Kevin Nash, Big Show vs. Rey Mysterio, Womens Champion Trish Stratus vs. Jazz, World Tag Team Champions Rob Van Dam & Kane vs. Dudley Boyz with Chief Morley as the special referee, Sean O'Haire with Roddy Piper vs. Rikishi, and WWE Tag Team Champions Team Angle vs. Los Guerreros.

Judgment Day:
WWE brought back a match for the first time in 15 years to finally settle the score between WWE Champion Brock Lesnar & Big Show in a Stretcher Match in what I felt was their best encounter ever & the best match using this stipulation. A feud that has been going on for close to 2 decades that went through two different promotions came ahead here as Hulk Hogan under his masked identity as Mr. America faced off against Roddy Piper in what would turn out to be their final encounter. The match that stole the show was the WWE Tag Team Champions Team Angle defending their titles in a Ladder Match against Eddie Guerrero & Tajiri (replacing injured Chavo Guerrero) where everyone gave a quality performance not only with the hits they took buy ways they used the ladder to deliver punishment when 3 out of the 4 men had no previous ladder match experience. Other matches include World Champion Triple H vs. Kevin Nash, the Intercontinental Championship battle royal, Womens Champion Jazz vs. Victoria vs. Jacqueline vs. Trish Stratus, Test & Scott Steiner vs. La Resistance, John Cena & F.B.I. vs. Rhyno & Spanky & Chris Benoit, and a bikini contest between Torrie Wilson & Sable in what would be the most watched ""match"" on WWE.com for years afterwords.

In the end, these are two really passable events so it's not something I would recommend for someone looking for great overall quality.",1217548800,3,2735,4.6234567901234565
8258982,2,B0015LBP1G,"Why is the WWE releasing this pair of PPVs?  Critics were indifferent to the events, fans don't write to highly of either one on this website, and I personally don't see the need for this re-release.  But, I'll try to stay positive, and maybe we can find the answers together:

First, the PPVs themselves:

BACKLASH 2003
---There's some good stuff here, but also some questionable decisions.  Both RAW and SMACKDOWN presented solid Tag Titles matches.  SMACKDOWN's, decent main event featured John Cena getting his first-ever shot at the WWE Championship against Brock Lesnar.  Sadly, the ""B Show"" also included Big Show squashing Rey Mysterio, which was a jip at best.  RAW headlined the PPV with the WWE in-ring debut of Goldberg; although he never matched his WCW success, it was nice to see him face The Rock in a match we never thought we'd see.  But throw in a racial-focused Women's Title Match, and World Heavyweight champion Triple H being stuck in a 6-Man Tag Match --- RAW too made some unusual decisions.  BACKLASH 2003 is a strange bird.  Overall, it's not bad, but you can live without seeing it.

JUDGMENT DAY 2003
---An inexplicable catastrophe.  The good news is that SMACKDOWN featured two solid title matches: a WWE Tag Titles Ladder Match, and a WWE Championship Stretcher Match.  The main event is a good one --- Big Show faces his greatest rival (WWE champion Brock Lesnar) in a contest with a few neat surprises.  Now for the bad...no, I should say ugly.
*  Roddy Piper and Hulk Hogan (in his Mr. America gimmick) compete in one of the worst matches you've ever seen.  When fans are quiet during a Hogan match, something is terribly wrong.
*  There's a pointless Bikini Contest between Sable and Torrie Wilson.  The women are gorgeous, but gimme a break.
*  John Cena & The FBI face Brian Kendrick, Rhyno, & Chris Benoit in a 4-minute opener.  Folks, I can't make that up.
*  Triple H defends his World Heavyweight Title against Kevin Nash in a match where the entrances last longer than the match itself.  Sorry to be a killjoy, but I'm gonna spoil the finish here.  IT ENDS IN A DISQUALIFICATION!
*  Throughout the evening from their box seats, Eric Bischoff and Stone Cold Steve Austin engage in drinking, spicy food, and vomit humor.  Cool, huh?
*  As if this isn't all bad enough, here's the worst offender.  The Intercontinental Title is reinstated into the WWE, via a Battle Royal only featuring former champions.  That sounds cool, doesn't it?  But wait until everyone is eliminated within 2 minutes, while the final 4 slow things down for an ungodly 10 more minutes!  What a disgrace to one of WWE's most prestigous belts!
In conclusion, JUDGMENT DAY 2003 is one of WWE's most embarassing presentations.  Take it from a longtime fan, this PPV is tough to stomach.

OVERALL
---To be fair, these are the original 2003 DVD releases.  All of the extras and menus remain on the discs.  Also, 13 bucks is a good price for 6 hours of WWE entertainment.  But these are the wrong 6 hours to package together.

If you're a fan like me who watches PPVs from start to finish, ""Tagged Classics"" is going to be a waste of time.  But even if you're a fan who just skips to the matches, there still won't be much to sink your teeth into.",1209686400,3,3253,4.632224168126094
