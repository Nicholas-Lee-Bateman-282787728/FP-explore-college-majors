8636071,5,B004VGGY0Y,"In the grand tradition of Dziga Vertov's Man With a Movie Camera, Huang Weikai has created one avant-garde masterpiece. Disorder shows the daily mayhem of urban China that cannot be shown on network television. Some of the more memorable images include a man dancing in front of traffic, pigs being walked across the highway, and the crazy flooding of streets. This urban documentary is a must see for people wanting to see another side of life in China, and can best be described as a ""city symphony of social dysfunction.""",1303084800,,524,4.833333333333333
