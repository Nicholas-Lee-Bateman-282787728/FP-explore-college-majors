8375931,3,B002OCTAKS,"Disappointed because the Bonus Extras  on Blu Ray Disc do not play on my Blu Ray player. The extra features of the DVD go to black screen and remain their for minutes until the menu key is pressed on remote control. The Spanish audio is somewhat annoying because I do not know Spanish, but the English subtitles make up for the lack of an English audio track.  The HD version of this film can be downloaded on Amazon Instant Video for much lesser price than the Blu Ray Disc and my bonus features on DVD don't play anyway!  However, I will probably keep the Blu Ray Disc as the film has  a very good picture quality and DTS sound option in audio menu!",1399939200,,651,4.2682926829268295
8375932,5,B002OCTAKS,"This is a well constructed and acted film about a young woman's journey through various encounters and a critical (attitude shaping) relationship. It is clear that her journey is one where her body is the instrument of both pleasure and communication. 'Why not?' one might ask. 'Why not!' indeed. Sensuality and eroticism are central to the human condition. Those that seek to understand, let alone experience it, are dealing with an important part of life itself. The film ends with an honest conclusion from the central character. It is worth watching.",1285027200,2,554,5.0989010989010985
