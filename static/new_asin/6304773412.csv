Men are loading crates on a truck. They dislike their working conditions. A wildcat strike leads to a promise of better conditions. [Campaign promises?] The next day there is a lockout of the workers who asked for better working conditions. The head of the local union asks Johnny to work as an organizer to sign up workers for the trucking union. It's not easy. An overworked driver can have an accident and become unable to work. A lawyer offers him money to work for the corporation; it is rejected. [Kovak was fooled once.] Anna tells Johnny about two girls who were fired and blacklisted. A gang of men attacks him for his union work. The head of the union warns against agitators. Johnny's friend is also beaten as a warning. The union wants medical insurance and paid overtime. The corporation offers nothing. There is a strike.

A gang attacks the striking workers with baseball bats. One man shoots Monahan, the local president. Johnny leads the men now. John L. Lewis supports them. The union will strike back. ""Its time."" [They don't tell who are the opponents of the union.] Its like urban warfare. The company settles with the union. Johnny travels to other cities to organize truckers. Then he makes a deal with a jukebox distributor. Is he on the take? Johnny goes to Washington and answers questions. Who owns the company that makes those toy trucks? This and other information is used to get the union president's resignation, and his replacement by Johnny Kovak. Kovak is a hard bargainer; he gets an 8% increase. But the corporations strike back with a Senate investigation. [Who owns the Washington Senators?] Does power corrupt? Were there ties to organized crime?

Mr. Milano is questioned by Senator Graham about his loans from the Trucking Pension Fund. Vinnie Doyle takes the Fifth Amendment when asked his name. [For legal reasons.] A convoy of trucks blocks the streets of Washington. Abe Belkin is called by Senator Graham; will he talk? He had to make deals. There is a hold-up at a grocery store, the robber shoots Abe Belkin and his guard. Kovak represents the 3 million members of his union. Kovak says he never took nothing. He once killed in self-defense in 1938. Senator Graham provokes him into leaving the hearing. [Background investigation?] One night Johnny comes home late. Two men greet him with a shotgun. [This is a fictionalized version based on actual history.]

The trucker's union started in the Mid-West and spread to other states with the same conditions. Around 1940 a new law was passed to eliminate the radical leaders. They were replaced by men who cooperated with organized crime. Corporations had long used gun men and organized crime to oppress workers since the 1870s until workers were unionized in the 1930s. The Establishment prefers corrupt union leaders who will make sweetheart deals with corporations. The Eastern Conference of truckers was forced to turn over their pension fund to Wall Street; they earned about 1% to 2%. The Western Conference of truckers kept control of their pension fund and earned about 3% to 4%. [These figures are not recent.] The Senate Investigations were a way to attack unions and allow Wall Street to get control of their pension funds. Does Wall Street control your pension funds? Would you want them to put your money into synthetic CDOs?",1428969600,,3356,4.903169014084507

7877084,4,6304773412,"F.I.S.T. has a lot of positive attributes, and it is hard to understand how the Academy completely snuffed it (and him). Despite it's mini-series length, the film commands your attention. Premeiring at a time when there was much labor strife, Stallone shows his range as an actor. And it is a range nobody imagined. More than the GREAT film ROCKY, F.I.S.T shows the development of a disgruntled poorly educated man who defies the odds, and rises to the top. In the process, he compromises himself and becomes the very person he so dearly hated. There is a high body count. The ending is worth a fortune. The first half of the film is loosely based on the early life of Governor (then Senator) Harold Hughes of Iowa, the only multiply convicted felon (he did 11 years), to occupy such offices.",1122854400,,792,4.664285714285715
7877085,4,6304773412,"This movie from the late 70s, loosely based on the life of Jimmy Hoffa, about a labor leader, Frank Kovak, who makes a Faustian bargain with the mob for which he ultimately pays the price, was done before Stallone became locked into the ironjawed superhero mode.  In the early scenes of the movie, he is still able to display the qualities of charm, humor and humanity that distinguished his performance in the orginal Rocky and, further back, in The Lords of Flatbush.
Moreover, the film is graced with strong supporting performances.  In particular, I would single out Tony Lo Bianco's performance as the mob boss, Babe Milano, to whom Stallone turns when the survival of his trucker's union is on the line, for its chillingly effective qualities of understated and insinuating menace, especially from an actor who I have found to be prone to overacting.
The main criticism that one could make of this effort if one references it to the life of Hoffa is that Kovak is treated as genuinely heroic instead of the corrupted person that Hoffa in fact became, for although Kovak made a deal with the mob, more specifically, Babe Milano, it is made clear that he did so only because he thought it was necessary to insure the continued existence of his union when its striking members were being beaten up by company goons, not for his personal aggrandizement.  Moreover, for what it is worth, I remember reading at the time of the film's release that Stallone insisted that the character be portrayed this way.  In spite of this caveat, I find Fist to be both dramatically compelling and strongly acted.",1066608000,19,1599,4.782608695652174

cast's him as a labor leader who  has to deal with

7877087,5,6304773412,"This is up there with The Sound Of Music. It should have won best picture, but was knocked out for the political sense of the movie. My father was a main part in making this movie possible. He was the director.",1041120000,,210,4.146341463414634
7877088,5,6304773412,"MGM needs to release this above-average drama on DVD. It is similar to the Jimmy Hoffa story and it's captivating. Sylvester Stallone gives one of his most heart-felt performances and is overshadowed by ""Rocky"". So, please MGM, release this and the missing ""Red Sonja"" with the other immortal deity. These are good movies and I would definitely buy at least ten copies on DVD of each movie. Thank you!",1022630400,2,401,4.826086956521739
7877089,5,6304773412,"First off, Sylvester Stallone is my favorite actor and secondly I believe this to be probably one of his best films (besides Rocky) and why it was not a hit is beyond me because it really is a great story and Stallone does a great job in the acting --- its 2 1/2 hours long but I throughly enjoyed every minute of it and can't wait til I can get my own copy and watch it again.
If you like Stallone this is a DEFINITE must.",1011657600,4,423,3.9302325581395348
7877090,4,6304773412,"This movie closely resembles the ""Jimmy Hoffa"" story. This story tells of a young labor icon who quickly climbs the ladder of labor leadership within his union. Along the way he falls into the hands of the Mafia. This movie has well photographed labor violence. Several times strikes erupt into riots. Stallone forgets where he came from in the ranks and becomes crooked. He
startins getting the attention of the legal authorities. His very
protectors,the Mafia soon grow disenchanted with him. The story
reaches a very predictable ending. This is by no means a ""Rocky""
or ""Rambo"" movie. Watch it anyway.",1009756800,,604,4.99009900990099
