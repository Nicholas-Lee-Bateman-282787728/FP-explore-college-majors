2593445,4,B000FZETI4,"This is SUCH a wonderful show with the beautiful settings, the Chinese writings, and the martial arts connected with the movement of bending of the 4 elements: air, water, earth, and fire. I especially love the connection between all of the characters (whether it's being friends, foes, or lovers) and each of their distinct personalities. The episodes has gains and losses as Aang, an air bender, Katara, a water bender, and Sokka, a warrior and comic relief, travel to the Northern Water Temple to find a master of water bending to teach Aang, who is the avatar(master of all 4 elements when he learns them). I personally adore Zuko, the guy hunting down the avatar. Anyway, the action, the death, the drama, and the battles are what makes this show my obsession for the time being(even when the comedy is pretty weak when they try too hard to be funny).",1155168000,16,856,4.713333333333333

THE AVATAR IS A MASTER OF FIE, ICE, EARTH, AND WATER. HE IS ALSO THE BRIGDE BEETWEEN THE SPERET WORLD AND PHYSICAL WORLD. GREAT MOVIE AND A MUST HAVE COLLECTION.

2593448,5,B000FZETI4,"I have not yet bought this item, although I intend to as soon as it is available.  I have, however, seen every episode of Avatar Book 1.  I recommend this show to anyone who appreciates smart writing, beutiful animation and an animated program that gives kids more than a few cheap laughs.  ""Avatar, the Last Airbender"" is by far one of the smartest, funniest and most worth while ""cartoons"" to be aired on Nick. It holds strong moral lessons and combines them with amazing animation and hilarous writing to teach kids the value of standing for something.  I highly recommend this show to any parent for their kids, and anyone of any age who loves animation and smart, witty and sharp writing.",1152230400,23,693,4.655737704918033

2593592,1,B000FZETI4,Disclaimer: Avatar is one of my favorite shows of all time. This rating reflects the product that Amazon provided. I paid for the 'HD' version of Avatar. It isn't in HD.,1517961600,2,169,4.483870967741935
2593593,5,B000FZETI4,"I absolutely love this show! I had the pleasure of watching it the first time around when it aired on TV when I was a kid. Now I have the great opportunity to relive, re-watch and remember every last action-packed smoothly paced detail of this incredible show. The adventures and lessons learned by Aang and company have been instrumental in developing my point of view and the way I go about life, you know sans awesome element-themed magic, and it's so great to find somewhere I can get back to that sense of wonder and adventure again.

The only downside was the overall cost. Where I got to watch it essentially for free the first time around (I was a kid so cable bills weren't a thing in my mind) in order to enjoy it all over again I had to shell out a total of around $90 for all three seasons, which is more than a tad ridiculous in my book, but I digress.

I absolutely 100% recommend this show for children, adults and anyone in-between. I'm sure you'll find something about it you'll come back to time and time again, just like I did. May you, the reader of this review, enjoy this show in all its wonder and fantasy and may it inspire you always.",1517788800,,1159,4.3119266055045875

2593597,5,B000FZETI4,"The creativity of the show and fairly strong animation leave little to be desired in this amazing series. The characters are well developed and although not entirely the traditional Japanese anime style, this cartoon is fun for everyone of any age. There are few if any plot holes that leave you wondering what is actually happening or questioning what is going on. It is also nice that this cartoon is in English and actually sounds like it should be unlike many cartoon/anime's similar. There are a couple of surprising plot twists that make the show a true work of art.

I would also like to address that most of the 1 star reviews are because Amazon recently took this off prime, and although I do not agree with their decision, I wouldn't like to give the show a bad rating because of it.

My favorite episodes include #1 for obvious reasons, the warriors of Kyoshi and The King of Omashu. In the other season, the headbands is also amazing. I don't recall the titles of others, but they all add earthier to the characters themselves or advance the plot in a nice fashion.

You are going to make a movie party with your friends tonight. You realize that your access to that movie is canceled. The result is, Prime Video is undependable in a casual occasion.

You are working in media business and you are in an important presentation on a specific film. You are sure that you have an access to the film via Amazon.

Infact, why would I want to pay twice for such a low quality version of anotherwise great show.

I'd give the show 5 stars but Amazon's butchery of the digital version gets 0. The only reason I don't give this review 0 is because the show deserves better. I know the show is old so I can understand the forced letterboxing. But the actual quality is very low res and easily noticed when it's a cartoon. Especially on all the hard lines that outline every character or animated object. I could pirate better versions of this for FREE and you want us to pay for this trash?

It's like playing a 10 year old game on a 10 year old resolution and turning the AA off.  It wasn't the TV which made it look bad either. The show looks great whenever I can catch it live on a rerun. Plus I watched the Amazon version on both the TV and my PC and both versions looked like trash. When it was streamed on Netflix I had none of these problems.

Well this is just added to a growing list of reasons to get rid of the Amazon prime sub. Keep making the choice easier on us. I'm sure you'll be very successful as a streaming service when you have nothing worth watching on it.",1504656000,14,1422,4.122743682310469

The storyline of the story is captivating beginning with a boy who has been trapped in an ice burg for a hundred years and comes back to war and chaos and his entire entire home completely obliterated by the fire nation. The dynamic character change throughout the seasons is absolutely phenomenal seeing as we get to see Aang grow stronger as the Avatar and learn water, earth, and finally fire as well as the big change in character for Zuko who finds himself and restores his own honor. The introduction of Toph was absolute genius and and overall developing love between, especially in season three, between Katara and Aang was beautiful. His love for her so great and their starting relationship as friends I believe only intensify this. The creations of Katara and Sokka was great mostly because of their sibling rivalry and Sokka's humor. Even Appa and Momo were amazing characters specially because Appa could fly and was Aang's best friend. I rave so much for this show and love it.",1500508800,,1219,4.520361990950226

This show is unlike any cartoon I have ever seen; it deals with deep issues  including genocide, redemption, grief, love, and a multitude of others  with a sense of wisdom and understanding that completely blew me away and captured my attention and emotions in every episode. The storytelling is phenomenal. It made me laugh until I hurt. It made me cry (which, to be honest, is the first time a TV show has ever managed to do that). It made me angry. It made me take a closer look at myself and the world around me. It inspired me to be better. And it did all of this while maintaining a wonderful sense of levity and being fantastically fun to watch. I have never been so captivated by the story of or cared more about the characters of a show than I did with Avatar: The Last Airbender. Do yourself a favor and watch it.

They did such a great job that I've watched this show from start to finish nearly 10 times. If you know you like action adventure cartoons about saving the world that have long overarching plots and hilarious characters and beautifully choreographed fight scenes, do yourself a favor and check it Aang, Katara, and Sokka's journey to the Northern Water Tribe at the north pole so that Aang can master waterbending and stop the mostly-evil Fire Nation from destroying everything from the Earth Kingdom to the Spirit World...",1495238400,3,859,5.006993006993007

Perhaps people with particular skills in anime, scripting and whatever might find technical flaws, but that is not my concern. As a literate watcher, I found this to be captivating, well-written, with unexpected depths of feeling. More than the blood and sex of the typical Western genre action series, I found this to have depths of mature reasoning, intelligent interpersonal relationships, genuine feelings and what might be called ""if it had happened, this is how it would have happened"" kind of realism, meaning internal logic (though nobody can fall that far and not get hurt, lol, but I'll forgive them that) that was sincerely moving. I almost never watch TV a second time, but I can't wait to watch this with meditating friends for this understood enlightenment and the need for meditation better than any other fiction thing I've seen.

You can really tell that the creators had a vision in mind from the get-go. The story is told so seamlessly that it seems like every episode is a progression of the plot and/or characters; you'll be hard-pressed to find any filler here. Speaking of the characters, I found myself quickly falling in love with them. Actions and motivations feel believable and the writing is so well done that the show can successfully be funny, thoughtful, and quite emotional.

It works far better when the episodes are watched in order. It draws for inspiration from rich, cultural sources, yet it manages to create a world all its own. It keeps its swords and sorcery grounded, not in Western culture, but in Eastern culture, and features martial arts infused-with-fantasy. The show is both delightful and moving, playful even when it somehow manages to confront issues that have major importance in our world. It's dramatic and humorous. It pulls at my heartstrings.

2593741,5,B000FZETI4,"I am so glad I bought this. This money well spent. I've never seen an animated show like this. I purchased the first season of Avatar on DVD due to a few reasons. One was most of my friends saw it and loved practically everything the series brought. The other reason was I was watching my favorite online movie critic, ""The Nostalgia Critic"", review the Shyamalan motion picture ""adaptation"" of the Avatar series.

First-things-first - I admit saw the movie before I saw the show not knowing what I was getting into. And holy crap was it awful! I mean awful! After watching 30 minutes I fell asleep. Then about an hour later I hear fight scenes and woke up and STILL bored out of my mind. I have never seen such a boring and dull film. Nearly nothing in the movie had me engaged with neither the story, nor characters. And while the visuals were impressive, the writing, directing, and acting was incredibly asinine . I know it's wrong to badly judge child actors, but I'm sorry they were just straight up terrible. Like Nostalgia Critic mentioned regarding the actors in his review; it was like ""watching a school play"". It's like the director told the actors to act with absolutely no emotion. Plus, the so-called ""plot"" is nothing but constant exposition with some fight scenes. This is me, knowing nothing about the show, feeling annoyed and confused on what was happening in the film.

After watching the Nostalgia Critic's review of The Last Airbender, that's what draw my curiosity to the series. I wanted to know what made this show so great. And that's when I bought the first season. Watching it all the way through, I knew without a doubt that I had to buy the rest of the series. The story is great. The characters feel real and developed. There's a perfect balance of drama, action, and a little comedy. And most of all - I now truly understand why fans of the show hated this film. In fact, I hate the movie even more due to the fact that Shyamalan put little to no thought or effort in writing/directing on a film based on this beloved series.

Final thoughts. For those of you who haven't seen this show and are curious to find out. I strongly recommend you buy this show; at least the first season to try it. Personally, I would recommend buying the whole series. But if you're unsure, try the first season and see if it sparks your interest and then buy the rest of the seasons.",1490572800,,2396,4.503448275862069

Before watching this, I thought Japanese anime was awesome as it was educational, teaching me all those merits like treasure the friendship and protect the environment. But now I think it is just superficial compared with the characters depicting in this show. Every character is so real, specially Zoku, he once became a good man and then turned bad again, before being a ""pure"" good man. I have never seen any wonderful depicting of characters like Zoku in Japanese anime. Even though many elements in the show are not so Chinese but it does not matter as the novel writer somehow gets the essence of traditional Chinese values and merits successfully. Such a great job!

2594354,5,B000FZETI4,"Avatar: The Last Airbender had me hooked from day one. Having watched the show several times, its pretty amazing that it gets me every time- the jokes don't get old, the compositions remain catchy, the art is sublime, and the plot doesnt become boring. Above all else, you can never stop falling in love with the characters and that is the reason why Avatar The Last Airbender is so successful and (Im sure) will remain as such for many years to come.
Strange as it may be, you cant help but grow attached to the characters, almost as if they are real. Theyre easy to understand, relate to, and find sheer pleasure in watching. One even wishes they were real every now and again, silly as that may seem. But the real hook is that you don't have to be a kid to like the show, in fact, Avatars ability to connect with a vast majority of people from all age groups is what sets it apart from most television series. Avatar isn't meant for one specific kind of person, it was a show intended to entertain everyone.
Not to mention, Avatar is full of life lessons anyone can apply to themselves here in the real world. It reminds us that in the end, were only human, and that we may have responsibilities as people but we should also learn to hang onto that inner child- using our imagination to go about life. The writers did such a superb job in relaying messages, inspiration, humor, and entertainment through mere characters that you want to be a part of their world. They remind us that there is a such thing as redemption through the complex character of Zuko. That goodness can be attained even in a fallen world through the always caring Katara. That just when things seem bleak, there is still hope and time to laugh through Sokka. That we are capable of overcoming anything through Toph. And that no matter who you are or how bad you think you might have messed up, there will always be someone who cares, like Uncle Iroh. More importantly the meaning of love, respect, and what it means to live rather than exist though the very Avatar himself, Aang. The script is so good that you don't just develop feelings of attachment toward the protagonist but the antagonists as well, another thing that makes ATLA stand out. This show is truly unique and spectacular, something I definitely recommend people to watch. My only complaint? That Avatar didn't continue; because you fall so in love with the characters you cant help but feel immense sadness when the series comes to an end- the worst part is you don't have anything to come back to after this phenomenal show because The Legend of Korra was a real let down. I think Avatar would be *THAT* much more successful had they gone on with these specific characters. Had the writers continued to develop the characters we initially fell so hard for, I know I would have remained a hard core fan.
In the end, I really do admire this show and will always stay a fan (albeit slightly disappointed that theres not more) no matter how old I might get. Avatar The Last Airbender is a truly amazing  series worth giving a shot even if it is just once. This show is more than what it seems and for that it deserves awards and attention. My wish: for the producers to round up the old gang and finish what they started with THIS series. The show that deserves more than 5 stars.",1484179200,,3320,4.478547854785479

2594491,3,B000FZETI4,"It was just good enough to get me to watch the next season.  I have had many people tell me to watch this show and with Amazon Prime I finally got the chance to check out the whole series.  As much as it was hyped, I thought it fell short of ""awesome.""  It's still very much an anime, and by that I mean they still use the same tropes and devices an anime would use.  Not bad, but definitely not standing heads above other anime in that respect.",1483574400,,445,4.0227272727272725

I can rarely watch today's cartoons with my son because I feel like I'm losing brain cells, but I can watch this with any aged child or adult and they all get into it. Even the ""no cartoon"" types manage a chuckle. The animation is both silly at times and absolutely beautiful at others, the voices aren't annoying, and every single character is well written.

For a cartoon kids show it tackles many topics such as love, fear, anger, sadness, family, friendship, war...just about everything. The writers manage to do it with laughter the whole way through while promoting very strong messages that young kids should hear along the way. Aang and Appa are the most lovable characters I've ever seen. Cannot wait to continue this story line through the comics and move on to The Legend of Korra next. My only gripe is that it ended in only 3 seasons :(",1483401600,,578,4.621359223300971

2594563,3,B000FZETI4,"Okay, before people hate me for giving Avatar a 3 Star review, let's clear this up: the show is amazing. 5 stars. I'm just giving this purchase 3 stars because at this point just about everyone has a semi-large HD tv, and the 480 resolution simply doesn't look good. The lines are jagged enough that it really detracted from the show for me.

This isn't Amazon's fault, Nickelodeon hasn't remastered the show to a higher resolution. I've heard whispers and rumors in forums of a 720 version floating around somewhere, but good luck finding it.

Anyway, great show, just be aware that if you buy this you may have to watch it on a smaller screen.",1482969600,7,645,4.551724137931035

2594565,5,B000FZETI4,"I'm the type of person who is instantly uninterested when new tv shows air and I remember when Avatar first came to Nickelodeon. I thought it would be another corny childrens show (even though I was a child myself) and ignored it. However, I still managed to come across episodes from time to time. Along with hearing all of the positive reviews from my friends, I decided to stop being stubborn and watch it, but it was nearing it's series finale. Almost a decade later, Amazon has given me the ability to catch up on such an amazing, action-filled story. I'm just happy that I can watch each episode back to back without that 'one week suspense'. Once I finish this, I'm going to stop being stubborn and watch Steven's Universe.",1482883200,2,730,4.580152671755725
2594566,5,B000FZETI4,"Dude. This show is great. It starts at a slow, and younger oriented pace. Get past that and you have earned yourself a ticket to a world filled with emotional tension, and wry humor. American-Anime elemental martial art fights, blended with great themes and a diverse world.

2594624,5,B000FZETI4,"This is one of my favorite shows ever aired, and is great for kids and adults alike. The writers composed the overarching story of all 3 seasons before they even started production, which means that the attention to detail is spot on, and the plot holes are very few. Animation and voice acting are excellently executed. I'd recommend it for just about anyone!

2594627,5,B000FZETI4,"I've been an Avatar the Last Airbender fan for a long time, and you really do need to start from the beginning to really appreciate the character development, hidden jokes and relational dynamics, grow to appreciate the characters as people (Iroh is deep enough you can totally get why he shows up again in Legend of Korra), etc.  With that in mind, I highly recommend ""The Blue Spirit"" episode.  Aang can no longer be overly cheeky (if this annoys you this is the changing episode) because he cannot overcome adversities alone.  His pride and smart-alic stiuff gets him in trouble and the most seemingly unlikely people arise to humble the avatar and build character in not only him.  This is one of the pivotal episodes for the whole series and introduces the archers that show up later in the comics (The Search trilogy).  Prep for ""The Blind Bandit"" in season 2.  It's another favorite (""It's My Life"" with Toph on YouTube is based on it, if you want a preview).",1482192000,11,966,4.652941176470589

2594667,5,B000FZETI4,"This is one of the classics: the first season of one of the most incredible animated series of all time. It is pretty rare that a gem like this comes along. Where to begin? The characters are unforgettable, the story well structured and compelling, the action stunning and the world entirely magical and unique.
The trio of protagonists have a rich chemistry, each one contributing something unique to team Avatar. Katara and Sokka are the quintessential brother and sister pair, loyal companions yet always getting on each other's nerves. Aang is the unwilling hero, loyal friend, kid yearning for an adventure coming of age while also fulfilling a higher destiny. There is a hint of romance, sibling rivalry and an over sense of true camaraderie with these three.
Then there is Zuko, Avatar Aang's nemesis. Zuko is the perfect foil for Aang, with mainly story lines being earlier parallel. Of course, the single best role model in the show, general Iroh seems like an odd fit for the Fire Nation who are the bad guys. In this first season, the mystery behind each character is well established, and it just begins to weave a deep epic story with layers upon layers of profound parallels.
The themes and subtext are powerful for a children's show: war, genocide, redemption, hope, and true friendship. And all of this just in the first season!
The bending arts are each based on a real world Chinese martial art, each fascinatingly fitting the element they belong to. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed and animated and every one of them counts- the stakes are high, and the action is always exciting.
This show should not be missed, it is a must watch for any animation connoisseur, any fan of martial arts in entertainment, any fan of fantasy, Asian culture or of good stories with awesome characters.",1481932800,4,1816,4.861290322580645

2594786,5,B000FZETI4,"This shiw is filled with actual culture from the real world, and layered with a deep mythology. This show premiered on Nickelodeon, but the concepts are very adult and heartfelt. The character development in the show is fantastic, and not just exclusive to the main characters. Doesn't get much better than this right here! The second half of season two makes it obvious that there was a budget increase. The style of animation is the same, but the clarity is greatly increased.",1481155200,,478,4.841463414634147
2594787,5,B000FZETI4,"This show is hands down one of my absolute favorites. With many high and lowbrow jokes, beautiful animation, interesting, multi-dimensional characters, it's wonderfully complex for a ""kids"" cartoon. Highly recommend.",1481155200,,216,6.233333333333333

2594810,5,B000FZETI4,"Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of my favorite shows. It's a truly great example of hybrid entertainment for both children and adults. It's cute and funny for children yet complex and deals with deep issues for adults. Of course, it has some flaws due to the nature of the audience targeting but overall it is an impressively quality show. The complexity of the main characters is a wonder to have when protagonists and antagonists alike are likable even with their flaws.",1480636800,,474,4.7926829268292686

We've watched every episode of this show 2-3 times, it's one of the only shows I'll watch with the kids. Avatar's next series, The Legend of Korra, is also great...though it is a continuation of this story and some characters are the same (next generation), it has a much different feel, so it's like new again.

2595145,5,B000FZETI4,"First of all, I wasn't sure if I'd like this show because I'm in my 20s and didn't have the nostalgic benefit of watching it as a kid, but I decided to check it out because I was bored. Best. Decision. Ever. There is so much to like about this show. The animation is beautiful,  the music is AHMAZING, and the storyline is wonderfully crafted. The characters are multi-faceted and complex, and we discover their stories slowly over the seasons even as the characters themselves develop and change. I can see how this would be a great show for kids too, but the themes explored are not what I think of as ""kids'"" themes: betrayal, genocide, war. Best of all, though, are the female characters. It is SO refreshing to find a show that unapologetically includes strong, incredible heroines. The girls aren't romantic objects, and they're not damsels in distress. They are absolutely crucial to the storyline and the success of the other characters, but not in a way that is clumsy or in-your-face. This cartoon has effortlessly succeeded in an area where so many ""adult"" shows have failed, and it is a delight. Overall, one of the best viewing experiences I've had in a long time.
And now, I'm going to go start the whole show over again.",1478217600,139,1235,4.639269406392694

No, seriously, this is more than a cartoon.  Don't let the Nickelodeon production unit confuse you.  This is a thoughtful, funny, and well-written story that engages both children and adult fans.

If I was a teacher for child or adult students, I would show this for my class as a series. I hope they make more! My favorite characters our Aang, always good and unflinching in his character and Zuko, strong but struggling with confusion and turmoil. I also have to say that separately, I enjoyed the movie as well. Noah Rider (Aang) was superb and a joy to watch with his talented beautiful movements. While the actors were cast perfectly for their characters, the writing and directing for the movie was done to be just like the animation which can be a challenging and somewhat quirky undertaking since well, real life isn't like animation. If you watched the animated series before the movie, I think you can appreciate that difference and really enjoy the movie. I get upset when I hear people bashing the movie because if you release your expectations and just go in to be entertained, it's great, and beautiful and such a fantastic story. I am sad that it wasn't a bigger success because I want more movies and more series and more books!",1475193600,,1172,4.6124401913875595

The only reason I gave this review 4 stars instead of 5 is because not all the episodes are here. It seems Amazon has left out a few episodes, whether that was intentional or accidental, I'm not sure. But I am disappointed that the series is a bit incomplete. The omitted episodes aren't absolutely crucial to the overarching plotline, but still, they do add more details to the story. But as I said earlier, the show itself is great.",1474243200,,527,4.739130434782608

It relies on a lot of anime tropes, and is targeted for adolescents, who feature strongly in the story; but even if you are not an anime fan, nor adolescent, this is a great show.  In addition to great visuals it features rich characters.  The protagonists are flawed, and the antagonists are often noble.  The conflict is nauanced and the hero is not trying to win...but bring peace.  The world it is built in is compelling with breathtaking backgrounds in city and countryside.

2595745,5,B000FZETI4,One of the best cartoons ever made. While season 1's story starts out light and funny it quickly develops into a deep and enthralling epic enjoyable by all ages. The topic matter of this show is no lightweight either; the characters have to deal with very deep issues on many occasions. And while this show is as deep as lake Baikal the humor therein is as light and well planned as can be. Season 1 has some particularly awkward moments but the later seasons improve on this greatly. All I can say is WATCH THIS SHOW. You won't regret it.,1473465600,,539,4.4

2595757,5,B000FZETI4,"I did not watch this show when it was on television.  I had no idea what I was missing all my life, because oh my god.  This is very likely the best animated television series I have EVER SEEN in my life.  I thought I'd just turn on one episode and give it a try, I enjoyed so I let it roll into the next episode, and then the next...  the next thing I knew, I'd marathoned the whole thing in one sitting and I was trying to water-bend my drink.

The story is both classic and fresh, the protagonist is at once relatable and awe-inspiring.  The supporting cast is complex and well developed...  even the ""villain"" has a sympathetic redemption arc that feels natural and well written.  Nothing is shoe-horned in, not even the filler episodes feel forced.

Since being made available digitally on Prime, I have rewatched this show more times than I can count.  It's just THAT GOOD.

Please never mention M. Night Shyamalan in my presence.",1473292800,3,936,4.447058823529412

I get it - a good story, some plot twists, unexpected happenings and (in some cases) deep characterizations that help explain why even the 'bad guys' feel 'they are dong the right thing'. Only one season in, so I hope it holds up to the end! Also having fun letting my kids re-watch with me. There's not that much that works for whole families anymore, and this one does.

The characters are as realistic and grey as can be in a fictional, magical world with element-bending people. They all grow and evolve. The storytelling is well-thought out and well-researched. The moves of each bending style follow a different martial art. They bring back elements from previous episodes through the series. The script could not be better and the storytellers have a great sense of humour, even about themselves.

2595929,5,B000FZETI4,"If you're like me, you probably grew up on Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon on weekends in the late 80s and most of the 90s. And, if you're like me, the shows you remember are light-hearted cartoons such as Hey Arnold!, Doug, Rugrats, Aaahh!!! Real Monsters and wacky game shows like Wild and Crazy Kids. So what do they have to offer adults? More banal, childish drivel? Dull, repetitive episodic adventures of cookie-cutter characters that remind you of your most hated subjects in middle school?

Not so. If you simply give their new offerings a chance and watch them with an open mind, youll probably be pleasantly surprised, if not wowed off your chair by the channels modern resurgence. Theyve diversified from their bread and butter titles and adventured into untested waters. It was a major shift for a channel that had never attempted to create long-running, coherent storylines that followed in the footsteps of the X-Men and Conan the Adventurer. But to me at least, the series was a resounding success. Ive seen it through once, and Im already rewatching it less than a month after its epic denouement.

Ill start with the storytelling. The first lesson usually taught to budding novelists and would-be movie directors and screenwriters is Show, don't Tell. This basically means that one should not be condescending to their audience. Instead of having characters ramble on for several minutes (or have endless paragraphs of tedious exposition in a novel), the characters should simply be themselves. The world should speak for itself. Young children aren't stupid. They can fill in the blanks and decide whether someone is good or evil. Whether they're willing to seek out new friends or lock themselves in a comfortable bubble. Sokka, though a young man, is immature and impulsive. He shows little interest in his tribe's culture and is more concerned with enjoying life in the present. His sister, Katara, is the mature tether that brings him back to reality and helps him grow. Although his creativity does pull them out of more than a few rough spots.

Aang appears happy-go-lucky at first, but it soon becomes apparent that this is merely a smokescreen he uses to avoid his mammoth responsibilities as an Avatar. And as a 12-year-old, who can honestly blame him? The responsibilities would suffocate most adults, and hes facing his ordeals and destiny almost by himself.

That ties in nicely to my next point: character development. This is a must in long-running shows, and this is displayed quite well in Lost (although definitely over-the-top there). After seeing what Prince Zuko, Aang, Katara and the rest went through as children, their actions, feelings and personalities as teenagers make perfect sense. Its rare that such a simple storyline can end up being so deep and profound when the surface is splashed and ripples reveal the more profound realities underneath. Any further details would spoil the adventure, so Ill restrain myself here.

The animation is stellar. Very smooth, with nothing I can really criticize here. The bending sequences are especially riveting and spectacular.",1470873600,,3113,5.084148727984345

As hence, I adore the series, despite it's being directed, predominately, at the adolescent audience.  It's extremely creative, the story line is masterful, and the fantasy world that exists in this program is immersive.  I say, ""Well done!,"" to it's creators.",1470182400,,366,5.275862068965517

2596038,5,B000FZETI4,"Avatar the Last Airbender is an incredibly well made animated series that follows the exploits of several children and their animal companions as they embark on a quest to save the world by mastering the powers of the four elements.

This show excels at creating little moments of hilarity that take it beyond the typical fare found in children's shows. The camera tends to linger on a scene just past its natural end and in those brief seconds, a character's final emotive gesture will ratchet up the humor and character-fullness to a new level.

It might not bring the most realistic examples of storytelling and character development and it often falls into the traps of on the nose dialogue and over simplification if complex issues, but if you're in it for the fun, you won't be disappointed.",1469923200,,797,4.810218978102189

Now, I didn't compare the digital HD vs SD (I didn't buy SD), and I don't have the Blu-ray version to compare further, but the digital HD version has been great for me!

If you want the convenience of digital (and you don't want the bad haloing effect found on some episodes in the DVDs), get the HD version!",1525651200,,537,4.213592233009709
