I remember the first time I heard the song that Scatman Crothers sings over the opening credits. ""I'm a N**** man, watch me dance!""  The way Mr. Crothers growls that line through his teeth, y'all know this is going to be different.

There is a mix of very low budget live action, and cartoons. My favorite funny bits are the crazy preacher (voiced by Bakshi himself) and The Godfather with the headless (!) bodyguard. The story of the woman and the cockroach can stand by itself as a short, but this is the serious part of the film.

I lived through the 60's and 70's. This is a satire and surreal view of the turmoil going on at the time.",1441756800,2,752,4.35

3882426,5,B0029Y5RA8,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Coonskin""

1. Animator/director Ralph Bakshi helped define alternative and independent film in the 1970's. He is probably most famous for ""Wizards"" and his version of ""The Lord of the Rings"". He made the first X-rated cartoon, ""Fritz the Cat"". But I think ""Coonskin"" could be his masterpiece. It's probably also his least seen movie.

2. ""Coonskin"" is harsh, vulgar, and challenging, especially (but not exclusively) in terms of race relations. Depending on your perspective, the movie is anti-black, anti-white, anti-gay, anti-woman, anti-religion, or anti-America. Or all of them. It offends everybody. It's an amazing piece of film-making and cultural commentary. And this movie would never be made today.

3. The movie mixes live-action and animation to tell several different stories. It has an all-black cast, and Bakshi made the rare decision to hire black animators and graffiti artists to make the cartoon sequences. The animation is in his usual crude, street-wise style (he calls it ""Ghetto Art) in an attempt to symbolize the way in which he and his friends grew up.

4. The movie is best appreciated if you have some knowledge of black history and urban culture. The main story is a cartoon about Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear, and Brother Fox (get the reference?) who move from the American South to Harlem after they lose their house. There, they run into a con man named Simple Savior, who claims to be the cousin of ""Black Jesus"". Simple Savior is a powerful man who makes a living by convincing the people of Harlem to give him money so he can buy them guns so they can go kill white people. Things happen, and Brother Rabbit ends up in charge of Simple Savior's operation.

5. There are several short stories interspersed in the main narrative. There is a series of vignettes in which a sexy woman symbolizing America seduces and then kills a black man.

6. Bakshi saves some of his harshest criticism for organized crime, and the way America has romanticized the Mafia. ""The Godfather"" is severely mocked in very disrespectful ways.

7. While the movie is crude in both subject matter and style, that doesn't mean it's dumb. Just the opposite: it's an intelligent, sophisticated satire. It carries both razor-wire and a club, sometimes sharply cutting through American hypocrisy and sometimes bludgeoning issues until there's nothing left to say.

8. When the film was finished, nobody knew what to do with it. The NAACP watched the movie and said that while the movie was ""difficult"", they supported the film. However, another civil rights organization, CORE, along with the Rev. Al Sharpton, condemned the film without seeing it. They protested and threw smoke bombs into movie theaters. Theater owners were intimidated, and the movie was pulled. It never received a proper theatrical release.

9. This is a hidden American gem that is just now being re-discovered by modern audiences. It sucks in all the racism, sexism, homophobia, and violence of America and furiously vomits it back in the audience's face, making no apologies. It should be seen by those that have the guts to admit that the movie is a mirror of ourselves - even 40 years after it was made.",1437350400,2,3211,4.964618249534451

The movie itself is a hell of a good movie. It had a great blend of live action backgrounds with animation going on in the foreground. And the animation is truly done in Bakshi's style. And his humor in the dialog is there as well.
Compared to Heavy Traffic and Fritz the Cat (which depict the life and culture of the 70's), Coonskin is definitely the best of the three.",1378080000,11,586,4.435185185185185

3882454,5,B0029Y5RA8,"I saw this on VHS  many years ago under the title ""Streetfight""  not to be confused with ""Streetfighter"".  The animation is a bit gritty but I realize this was made in the 1970s.  I DO like both Barry White and Scatman Crothers.  A bit of FYI:  Scatman Crothers voiced ""Hong Kong Phooey""  and ""Jazz"" in the orignal transformers series.  Any how this film DOES have A Lot of racial/sexual stereotypes  which is common for a Bakshi Film.  It basically is a parody, ghetto version of ""Song of the South"":  stories of Uncle Remus, Br'er Rabbit, Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear.  I also like how the put the movie's original title ""Coonskin"" on the cover.  Now if only Disney would wise up and release an offical ""Song of the South"" DVD the movie industry would make real progress.  This film is far more offensive in general than ""Song of the South"" ever was.  I know it's shunned because of racial stereotypes but three facts to consider:  1) SotS was made in the 1940s and these type of characters were perfectly acceptible. 2)Contrary to what many said about these stereotypes being bad they were actually portayed as positive role modles.  I feel ""South Park""'s ""Chef"" was inspired by ""Uncle Remus"".  3)The time period was set in the days of slavery which is certainly not a shining moment in US history which, like it or not, it DID happen.  Case in point as well ""Gone With the Wind""  and is not shunned.  I guess I did go all over the place here.  In conclusion if you enjoy the art of annimation and are not easily offended DO gives this movie a chance.  If you are then don't watch it and spoil it for everyone else.",1370304000,4,1614,4.4520547945205475
3882455,3,B0029Y5RA8,"The animation and sound was excellent if a little boisterous.  About par for 70s fare.  I imagine that some of the content was ""cutting-edge"" for the era, but I found it stereotypical and garish in color and pacing.

 I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film in view of one the reviews that panned it's video resolution, although it did not match the smoothness of ""Heavy Traffic"" or ""Cool World"" in either context or production value.",1369353600,,448,4.705128205128205
3882456,3,B0029Y5RA8,"when this film was first released, im sure it ruffled some feathers in the african american community, i guess that was the point. nowadays its not so shocking, in fact its a little noisey and confusing! it still stands as a bold animated feature, one that pushed animation to untold heights of relevancy, politics, and anger! some might still still find it offensive! but for me its a very bold, direct, experiment, i enjoyed it, just wish it weren't so ,loud!",1368057600,,461,4.703703703703703
3882457,5,B0029Y5RA8,"To start with, I'd like to say please don't let complaints of the quality of this film deter you from making a purchase. From what I know, Coonskin was never officially restored and released on DVD, but that's not to say this version is godawful. It may not be high-definition, but it's still perfectly clear, and honestly, I think the very vintage appearance just adds another level of grittiness to the film's already rough story. If you get offended easily, then you might want to skip over this film, as it's a pretty crude satire. Personally, I liked it. I've always had a bit of a soft spot for movies that mix live action and animation (save for Space Jam), and like all Bakshi's other works, this one's rather strange, but in a good way. So it seemed only natural I'd take a liking to this film.

Admittedly, the animation is not *gorgeous*, but again, I think this simply adds to the overall rough feel of the movie. There's no computer-generated imagery and I think the mood is really captured nicely with the art style, music, everything. Could you take a film about Harlem seriously if it had perfect, pretty animation? I love the spin Bakshi put on the classic Uncle Remus stories, re-telling them in a gritty, urban setting.

Definitely not a kids' film either. Coonskin is full of coarse language, nudity, sex, drug use and references, murder, blood, violence, possibly offensive caricatures. Coonskin's got it all. I don't really get offended by much because I've got a pretty sick, twisted sense of humor, so I was able to enjoy this movie through and through. However, I'm reviewing as a white 20-something atheist viewer, so I can't say for certain that religious viewers or anyone of any other ethnicity would find this film to be in bad taste.

I think my favorite characters had to be the Godfather's gay sons; I don't think they really served a huge purpose, but they just made me laugh because of they're over-the-top stereotypical behavior.

My only complaint - a minor one - just seems to me like the story really hops around a lot and segments of the film just do not flow very smoothly into one another. Part of me still tries to figure out the plot even though I've watched it a few times since I got it. Yes I know it's a satire and all, but there's so many conflicts going on and very few ever seem to be resolved. I still don't know what the purpose of the boxing match is at the end, or the lady in the bar that winds up marrying Brother Bear.

But in spite of everything, I still enjoyed the film, and if you'd like to see something radically different in terms of animation and won't get offended too easily, I recommend this classic title.

3882464,1,B0029Y5RA8,"It's with little irony that ""Song of the South"" hasn't been available for public viewing in this country since 1986 yet this travesty is.  Animator Ralph Bakshi cut his teeth with Paul Terry and Terrytoons but gained personal fame with commercial animated porn i.e. ""Fritz the Cat"".  In a word this film is an abomination.  It's a visual and aural assault to the senses.  The images are ugly to the extreme and the narrative is incoherent.  It purports to be a modern response to Joel Chandler Harris and Walt Disney but only reinforces what consummate artists those gentlemen were.  The Seventies were a watershed time for African-Americans in cinema.  This film makes a mockery of the positive inroads that Blacks made in the medium.  There is a distinction between blaxploitation and exploitation and this garbage falls in the latter category.",1341878400,3,846,4.992857142857143
3882465,4,B0029Y5RA8,"It's nice to see this classic film finally get a proper release on DVD.
For starters, the audio/video quality is a upgrade from the VHS releases. Not the best looking DVD release, but considering the film and it's notoriety, it's acceptable.
The animated segments show up wonderfully, allowing you to see some of the minor imperfections. The live-action shots, do look rather rough at times. Audio is always crisp.

Many other critics have noted the ""cropping"" method used in the film. Where it's essentially the fullscreen release, that's been zoomed in at a 16:9 aspect ratio (widescreen).
While this aspect is VERY obvious, it certainly doesn't ruin the film or it's visual aspect.

This is a no-thrills DVD release. You get the movie, and scene-seletion. No trailers, subtitles, commentary, etc...

Bottomline, if you want a good looking release of Coonskin, and to replace your VHS copy, this is an easy buy. Hopefully enough people will see the movie, to warrant a high-quality release down the road.",1337299200,,1006,5.048192771084337

When the animation begins, the characters feet are cut off. I would have preferred this to be released a full screen instead of having additional portions of the picture cut away. I'm happy that the film was finally released, but I hope this gets re-released in its original aspect ratio in the near future.

Another tragic release. Sad to say Coonskin is another casualty of recent ""widescreen"" releases of older movies. If one bothers to compare, most, if not all, DVD releases do this- from MGM to Warner Bros. I have yet to come across any company that releases in true widescreen. I'm speaking of only older movies, since most newer movies there's no fullscreen version release for comparison.
  This is really sad, considering the picture and sound quality are outstanding.

3882472,4,B0029Y5RA8,"I cannot judge what this movie would mean for viewers when it came out in 1975 (as I wasn't born yet); nor can I judge what it means to an African American viewer.  All I can tell you is what it means for a young white viewer in 2012, with what little exposure one like me has to African American culture and history.  So that's how this review will judge it.

PLOT:
The plot is extremely clever. But to really appreciate it, you need to know a bit about African American history--not just slavery and Civil Rights, but also the Harlem Renaissance, and the Black Power movement.
""Coonskin"" is a frame story.  In a live-action opening, two black convicts sneak out of jail and wait for friends to come rescue them.  While they wait, the older man tells the younger an updated version of the Uncle Remus tales, and the movie switches to animation.  Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear, and Preacher Fox are classic trickster heroes; but decades after slavery has been abolished, they are still struggling to survive in American society.  After a bad run-in with the law, Brother Rabbit declares, ""I'm sick of trying to segregate, and integrate, and masturbate, anymore!""  Turning their backs on the unfair American law, the Civil Rights movement, and the Black Power movement, Rabbit and his friends set out on a self-serving path to rise up in the ranks of Harlem organized crime.

CHARACTERS:
The characters are well-rounded and entertaining, and many are also metaphors.  The clever but impulsively violent Brother Rabbit acts both as the hero and the villain, making for one of the most interesting leading characters I've ever seen in a movie.
Brother Bear and Preacher Fox seem to symbolize the everyday people in the black community, who are both helped and hurt by extremists like Rabbit.  Fox is also, by far, the most fun and hilarious character in the movie.
American society is represented by Miss America, a beautiful white woman who lures black men to her with the promise of love, only to beat them violently when she has them in her grasp.  As a female viewer, I was offended by her character, but she didn't ruin the movie for me.

ANIMATION:
The visuals are one of the best things about ""Coonskin.""  It's nothing great in terms of special effects, but in terms of mood and cleverness it's through the roof.  The colorful cartoon characters are often shown walking against a gritty live-action Harlem, giving ""Coonskin"" a graffiti-like feeling.
There are several surreal scenes, but they all seem to have a purpose (even if it's difficult to decipher what that purpose is).  Most memorable is a scene in which Rabbit shoots at a giant rolling 8-ball and hits it right on the dot...only to watch it explode into hundreds of dice cubes, not knowing how any of them will land; whenever the heroes--and the black community--solve a problem in ""Coonskin,"" it opens up a new can of worms.
All of the characters are ethnic caricatures--blacks, whites, Italians, Jews, etc.  These stereotypes are used mainly for comedic affect and irony, so viewers won't necessarily be offended, as long as they understand the context.  What might put some people off though is that some characters are just gross to look at (the godfather, in particular).

OVERALL:
Be prepared for tons of R-rated material: politically incorrect caricatures, nudity, sex, violence, and cursing.  As long as you can get passed that, ""Coonskin"" is an exciting, moody, and hilarious movie.  An absolute MUST SEE for fans of Ralph Bakshi, or animation in general.",1328400000,29,3529,4.858096828046745

3882474,4,B0029Y5RA8,"Ralph Bakshi's controversial COONSKIN has always been something of a curiosity among cinephiles. The film was highly controversial when first released, and protesters lined the streets. The satirical element must have been lost on them. The film remains potent to this day, and as a result, it has not been able to garner a proper DVD release in the U.S. - if anywhere. Thankfully, we have this DVD-R release. Sure, it's VHS quality, but all things considered, it could have been much worse. It isn't bad at all. The VHS that was used to create this DVD must have been in pretty good shape. Color is washed out a bit, but that's the only real issue here, and it is to be expected, considering the age of the film. No problems with the sound, either. For now, I'd recommend this release until something better comes along - and hopefully, it will. This film deserves a proper release. It is culturally significant, and for the serious film buff, a real treat.",1311897600,,958,4.641176470588236
3882475,5,B0029Y5RA8,"Coonskin is a masterpiece of hard-hitting satire and adult animation. It has a few flaws, but it is a great film and a showcase for Ralph Bakshi's brand of storytelling. It blends live-action and animation in fascinating ways. Live-action and animated characters will sometimes The story is actually two stories. In the live-action story, two men, The Preacherman (Pulitzer-prize winning playwright and actor Charles Gordone) and Sampson (singer Barry White), are on their way to break their buddy Randy (Philip Michael Thomas) out of prison. As Randy awaits their coming, the old man who helped him break out, Pappy (the Uncle Remus stand-in played by Scatman Crothers) recants tales of their animated counterparts Brother Rabbit (Thomas), Brother Bear (White), and Preacher Fox (Gordone). The animated segments concern their escapades in harlem, as brother Rabbit rises to power by eliminating racist cops and even The Godfather himself (played by Al Lewis, otherwise known as Grandpa Munster).

The film's strengths are numerous. The film has scenes of beautiful animation and experimentation. A great scene would be the death of the corrupt cop Madigan (voiced by Frank DeKova, who played Angelo Corleone in Heavy Traffic). This scene was animated by Ambi Paliwada, a former Disney animator. The scene is both grotesque and beautiful at the same time. Its use of caricature makes it powerful and almost poignant. That is an example of what animation does best, and that is use the art of caricature and exaggeration to drive home an emotion. Also, Ralph Bakshi likes to experiment and use collage in his films. The best example of this is a scene in which a woman describes a relationship she had with a cockroach. The animation of the woman is done all in silhouette, and the story is told in a very limited animation form. This serves as both a description of conditions of relationships between black men and women at the time, as well as a tribute to the Mulatto cartoonist George Herriman (especially his illustrations for the archy and mehitabel stories by Don Marquis). It is a beautiful scene that, while it doesn't serve the story, it shows the condition of the area the characters are moving into. Animation is also good at making visual poetry,as is evidenced in the scene where after The Godfather's wife is shot, she goes through a beautiful transformation into a butterfly. The film is filled with moments like that.

As I've mentioned before, animation relies on caricature, which is used to perfection in this film. The designs of the characters are cartoony and exaggerated, but's used to visually describe the characters in the film. It gives each character a distinct look that makes them unique. However, it is the caricatured visual aspects that was the reason that the film faced controversy. You see, Ralph Bakshi used these designs to force America to confront the racist imagery of our cultural history (Aunt Jemima, Pickaninnies, Amos 'n Andy, etc.). However, Bakshi's most savage satire is aimed not at blacks, but at the Mafia. Angered at the hero worship the Mob received after the release of the Godfather films, Bakshi presents them here as a group of sadistic, hedonistic, incestuous clods with no moral compass of any type.

Despite these strengths, the film suffers from not just from its limited budget, but also Bakshi's weakness as a storyteller. The limited budget meant Bakshi couldn't afford pencil tests, which is a way for animators to test their work before it's inked and painted. Because of this, the film also has moments of weak animation, where the characters don't feel to have any weight or there are weak drawings. The films biggest fault is the story. Parts of it do not flow together, or they try to cram too much in one story, which wold be Bakshi's ultimate undoing in Wizards. With three main characters, certain characters fall into the background and will pop back up for no reason. Preacher Fox disappears for about a half hour without any real explanation. That, and the importance of the boxing match at the climax is never stated or shown, which kind of takes away the suspense. The topper is the ending of the film. It's never made clear on what exactly happens. It leaves you feeling a bit lost. One more small quibble with the film: sometimes the sexual imagery is carried a bit too far and seem excessive.

Ultimately though, that does not diminish my love of this film and my respect for Ralph Bakshi. While I feel it's not as good as Heavy Traffic, it is a brilliant film that should not be missed. However, be forewarned. This film requires more than one viewing in order for it to sink in. Also, this film will make people uncomfortable. I've had a friend ask me to stop the film. This is not for the weak of constitution. Happy Viewings.",1302220800,,4812,4.886168910648715

The original name of this amazing film, ""Coonskin,"" was changed without the director's permission to ""Street Fight"" for its (very) limited filmatic release back in 1975. It is a combination of live action film that bookends the animated feature, much like Bakshi's previous effort, the somewhat biographical ""Heavy Traffic"".

An unbelievably biting satire of 1970's society and Walt Disney's ""Song Of The South"", ""Street Fight"" was originally concieved and produced in 1975. Bookended by live action sequences starring R&B sensation Barry White, a pre-Miami Vice Phillip Micheal Thomas, Pulitzer Prize winner Charles Gordone, and the inimitable Scat Man Crothers, the film was intended to be a multi-leveled update of Br'er Rabbit gone to Harlem. An astonishing and ground-breaking attack on racism, on the surface this film appears to embody and embrace exactly sort of Stephen Fetchit/Uncle Tom/Uncle Remus stereotypes that it so successfully skewers, also satirizing ""The Godfather"", blaxploitation films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Caesar/dp/B000053VB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Caesar</a>, and New York Glam Rockers such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-York-Dolls/dp/B000001FMX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New York Dolls</a>",1284940800,25,1598,6.752427184466019

This... is Ralph Bakshi. This work deals with racism. It is not racist, but anti. The ones complaining didn't see the film.
