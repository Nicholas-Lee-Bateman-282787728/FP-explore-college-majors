6597963,3,B00MP2FHNG,The meaning if the movie is good but I was a little disappointed in the simple way the actors carried out the message.  It's a story about a wealthy family that suddenly is faced with tragic fatalities and how the living child reacts to their deaths by shutting everyone out that could bring him happiness.  The ending is good and very powerful and true as to what's important in this world.,1419292800,17,391,4.492957746478873

6598005,1,B00MP2FHNG,"Reviewed by my 13-year-old son: Do not watch this movie. Although this movie is clearly ""Christian"", with multiple phrases about prayer and Christ coming to earth as a human, its theology is utterly skewed. (Spoilers) This is a Christmas Carolesque story in which the main character is visited by the ghost of his dead sister in a dream. Throughout the story, many drastic and dangerous theological mistakes are made, like that you must follow your dreams beyond anything else and that good deeds outweigh bad deeds. These misconceptions are presented as important, life-changing truths. In the end, the main character has a drastic change in his life that in a Christian movie you would expect to be repentance and belief in Christ; Actually, it is just that life is worth living and that you should be nice all the time instead of angry all the time. (End spoilers) This movie all around is a poor representation of Christianity and you should watch it with caution if you choose to watch it at all.",1511049600,5,1001,4.791907514450867

6598107,5,B00MP2FHNG,"Very sweet story of a modern day Scrooge.  As in the traditional Scrooge story, the main character was self centered and mean spirited until events unfolded before him revealing the struggles and heartaches of friends, employees and acquaintances that he had hardened his heart towards.  When he sees the flashbacks and the future events, he has a change of heart and just as the old story goes, he makes amends. A very thought provoking movie.",1483747200,3,444,4.906666666666666

My birthday is on December 24th, and it's always been hard for me at Christmas, particularly since I grew up in a dysfunctional family, in which Christmas was a time of stress.  This movie inspired me to begin a new way of being at this time of year.  I have decided to be a Christmas angel from now on and give to others.  Watching the main character in the movie going through such a transition is eye opening.  This movie left me with a feeling of joy!",1483660800,3,524,4.3061224489795915
6598123,5,B00MP2FHNG,"Alright....I'm a little biased because this little film was shot in Jacksonville, OR. , with exteriors of downtown Jacksonville. I have to drive through this charming town every day to go to work in nearby Medford. If any of you readers venture to southern Oregon, Jacksonville is a must see attraction. As for the movie, no it's not the classic ""Scrooge"" with Alistar Simm, but it is charming in its own right. The evangelical or religious angle is very low key, but it is there, and you know...It's not a bad thing to have. Perhaps the acting or maybe the script could have been tweaked up a notch, but for those of you that can really ""suspend your disbelief"" and actually get into this film, I think you will agree it is time well spent, and will certainly help to give you a little bit of what Christmas should be.",1483574400,2,819,4.466666666666667

6598137,5,B00MP2FHNG,"A modern adaption of A Christmas Carol. Tracks the classic storyline but there are enough differences to keep you engaged.  I especially liked the twist of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future being played by a single character - a surprise I won't give away. The Scrooge character is much younger here, and it's a tragedy in his life that makes him so cranky. I actually found his descent a little more believable than the original Scrooge's because it was based on devastating grief. And his reconciliation with friends and coworker at the end is perhaps more downplayed, but more realistic. (You can tell people are going to take a while to believe his transformation, but they they will eventually.) Overall, an interesting work that honors its source material.",1483142400,5,778,4.938931297709924

6598388,5,B00MP2FHNG,"By God's Grace is a modern retelling the story of A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens
minus his animus against Puritans personified by Ebenezer Scourge.
Today's ""Scourge"" is a young, embittered executive plagued by inexperience that threatens
his suddenly inherited family business.
A juvenile, angelic Grace comes to conduct our modern Scourge through Christmas past, present &  an awful future.
The terrible Christmas future is rendered moot as repentant Scourge breaks free of obsessive bitterness and just in time
to set right his business blunders and celebrate the joy of Christmas present free of poisonous bitterness and resentment.",1479168000,3,641,5.540816326530612

6598638,4,B00MP2FHNG,"Chris lost both his parents and his sister that night. That Christmas eve night. Now he's running his father's business as best he can, ignoring all the advice anyone would want to give. Ignoring everyone who ever meant anything to him. Can he change before everything gets A LOT worse?

""By God's Grace"" is a modern retelling of the ""Christmas Carol."" The story is beautiful, with many openly Christian truths in it. It is a bit slow, but nonetheless worth telling. A story of change and a story of giving, ""By God's Grace"" is a movie you won't want to pass.",1459036800,,559,4.534653465346534

6598766,2,B00MP2FHNG,"Charles Dicken's Christmas Carol changed my perception of Christmas at 13 years old.  I am a Christian impart by that story.  It  I gave me a perception of what judgement is in real terms.  Charles Dicken's Christmas Carol defined good from evil in real terms. As a Christian I don't feel required to judge every Christian film as good.  I do not understand why the imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien,  C.S. Lewis, and George MacDonald never find their way to the screen apart from directors like Peter Jackson.  These authors dedicated their lives by unmasking the claims of the Gospel through the imagination.  I can't imagine a non-Christian even staying long enough to see this movie through. My spouse fell a sleep through most of it.  She is a Christian as well.  Drama is often a poor vehicle for evangelism.  It may entertain the Christian but never draws the very people we are trying to reach with the Gospel.",1449446400,22,914,4.7215189873417724

6599106,1,B00MP2FHNG,Could have been so much better.  Good story idea but so disappointed in the portrayal of the stereotypical foster home with the abusive father figure.  Why must movies and television shows stoop to that level when there are thousands of loving foster homes and parents in this country?  Please do not let this theatrical portrayal color your opinion of foster care in America!,1426550400,,376,4.936507936507937

6599112,3,B00MP2FHNG,"The protagonist seemed a bit too young to be going through the experience of looking back on all his past actions and future actions that would ultimately give him a change of heart on Christmas Day.  He was anywhere from around age 18 to age 21, I think.

The scenes of a possible future to come were kind of funny in that it seemed to imply that without this one person, who might have just reached the age of drinking, all the people he knew would live ruined lives (or at least, what the movie considers as being a ruined life).  I cannot exactly believe that he had that much impact on those people, but it is enough for him to believe he can make a change, so that's good for the movie.

For these kind of Scrooge stories, It's always fun to see the last few minutes of how the protagonist makes use of his new attitude to the people around him.  I especially liked the way he opened his heart again to his mom's best friend and how he helped the children's home in the movie, including his childhood friends.

Overall, it is a relaxing movie with a known ending, but the interest is in how the movie gets to that ending and what it does in between.",1425513600,5,1155,4.2272727272727275

Chris Taylor is the protagonist in this film, and he puts in a fine performance.  And the actress who plays his younger sister, Savannah McReynolds, is excellent.

I wasn't expecting a new favorite as the description made it clear this was not breaking any new ground. Got about 11 minutes in before calling it quits. The overacting was just too much. Couldn't get past it.,1514160000,,328,4.672413793103448
