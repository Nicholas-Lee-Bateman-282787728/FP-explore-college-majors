3555253,5,B001EJYCOG,"[Always consult a physician before starting any exercise routine]
Simply, it has been said that if you 'hate' your workout instructor by the end of the first week - it is a good workout.  By the end of the first week I 'hated' Ada.  As others noted this is an older 'from VHS' conversion.  That does not make it less effective.  My primary interest is a cardio/aerobic workout that is 'low impact'.
It is neatly divided into chapter sections.

Three weaknesses in this routine.
First, there is no pre-warm up stretching.
Second, the transition from aerobic to strength training is very short - I pause it here to take a moment to slow the heart rate a little more than she gives time for.
Third, some of the transitions in the stretching portion are quick and do not give time for an adequate stretch.  It seems like they were trying to get in a 'one-hour' workout so they sacrificed some time stretching to do it.

This is a good cardio/aerobic exercise video with some weight training - it won't make anyone 'Charles Atlas' but it does provide a decent cardio maintenance routine with the ability to challenge one's self and improve.

The best recommendation I can make is simply - by following the routine every other day [after consulting my physician] - it has lowered my blood pressure [taken daily] and increased everyday stamina.",1245196800,19,1337,4.683760683760684

3555257,5,B001EJYCOG,"This is an older workout, from the early 1990's, but it doesn't seem dated. I've had the VHS tape for years and was glad to finally get it on DVD. The DVD is chaptered. I like the aerobics section best, it has basic choreography and is low impact, but delivers a very solid workout. It's about 30 minutes long (including warm-up) and the time flies by. I wish Ada had made more workouts like this, it's one of my favorites that I always come back to.",1230768000,26,450,4.244186046511628

3555273,5,B001EJYCOG,"I'm 27 years old
5'4 and in between 164-3 pounds and was able to complete this 60-minute workout.

From the DVD menu the workout is broken down into sections if you do not wish to do all of them.

Ada and her partners are situated on some kind of airship base with idled helicopters stationed in the background. Her partner's bodies give excellent motivation for me to continue my toning and firmness. They are very disciplined, helping you keep count of the repetitions, which seem to be 16-count for a set of moves almost every time.

The first part is a lengthy warm-up, one that already made me fatigue a little, especially in my arms. This is about 7 minutes.

The next part is the low impact aerobics. Some of the moves will frustrate you becuase of the long 16-repetitions. There are lunges, squats, lots of arm movement, knee-lifts, which will be exaggerated. But there is no hopping, running, or jogging. It's low impact, but because it's low, she's going to make you make up for it. This is about 25 minutes. But stopping at this level, I burned a little over 200 calories.

The Strength training is dealing with weights of maybe 2 to 4 pounds. I would not go higher than that unless you're just a really big guy. You'll be standing for the dumbbell part. Then toward the end of the dumbbell, she work on the front and back squats, then some lunges. She'll then take you to the floor/mat where you'll work severely on the abdominal. Believe me, I FELT that workout, but it excited me becuase I knew it was working. She'll have you do tiny pulse sit ups and lots of them! She also aims at the buttocks as well. This is about 22 minutes.

The last part is the total body stretch and that is 7 minutes. This DVD is definitely worth the money. I'd highly recommend this.",1395792000,6,1776,4.449230769230769
3555274,5,B001EJYCOG,Even after all these years I still think that it is the best workout around along with Jane Fonda's original workout routine. Wish they would sell them in DVD. I had to transfer mine to DVD myself.,1376438400,,197,4.351351351351352
3555275,5,B001EJYCOG,"Though I like her brother Gilad and his training DVDs and TV shows, Ada has got to be the most instructive and fun trainers out there!  How I wish she would put out even more DVDs.  I used to record her Basic Training show back in the '80s and loved the way she helped my life!  You won't regret purchasing this DVD!",1376352000,,316,4.064516129032258

3555277,4,B001EJYCOG,"Lively tape that while dated and a little over the top with the circulating military helicopters, I don't get tired of the catchy music and the mostly clear instructions. I can increase my heartrate even with the 25 minute cardio section. I also like that she has a few women and men to look at for variety. There are a couple of sections where I take issue--part of the lunges seem to only work out one leg; Ada and her crew don't seem to change legs just for one small part. Also I find the strength training delightfully challenging and at my level really difficult enough. I just wish she hadn't put triceps in the middle. I had learned to end with triceps because once you tire these muscles you really can't work shoulders and biceps and back. And this is definitely true for me with this video. Then again, I have more training in store. This tape--along with some other supplemental exercise--has certainly been fun and active enough to get me through the winter at what I consider a moderately fit level.",1365897600,,1013,4.540983606557377

3555279,3,B001EJYCOG,"Always loved Basic Training Work Out and was happy to find it on Amazon. I Alos like Gil's Bodies in Motion. But I waas very unhappy with the quality of the dvd itself. It skips, making it impossible to stay with workout movements and freezes so really cant enjoy the workout. I haven't tried it in any players except my own so it could be a problem with my player. I haven't had any problems playing other dvd's so really don't think that's the case.",1363824000,3,451,4.317647058823529

3555285,5,B001EJYCOG,Actually my husband is the one that uses this work out DVD the most.  He had it on video and decided he wanted the DVD.  He loves it and says it's easy to follow and nothing over the top like some workout programs are.  I've done the workout myself a few times and totally agree with his assessment.,1356825600,,299,4.120689655172414

When you're watching it, it really doesn't look like an older video...The moves are easy but I'm telling you, you really work up a good sweat and raise your heart rate!  It is a SERIOUSLY GOOD overall workout!  I did the entire workout for 60 minutes but it has a menu that you can choose to do WU, either Floor Aerobic or Standing Floor Toning, and CD... I truly enjoyed it and the time went quickly.  I just KNOW this workout will be effective.  Ada gave great cueing and nothing was difficult to learn at all.  This will be in my regular exercise rotation.  The other thing that I liked is that you don't have to learn dancy routines...I have two left feet and don't enjoy those type of workouts.",1344556800,5,823,4.230769230769231

But I just don't get why she didn't put out more stuff.

Heck,

She even makes me want to join the army! LOL!

A beginner can't go wrong with this workout, and the intermediate can benefit from it as a backup to a vigorous weight training routine for the cardio.",1331424000,4,506,4.294736842105263

I first found this workout on VHS about 18 years ago when stationed in Hawaii [Husband is a 1st Sgt. US Army]  It was filmed on the airfield where he worked.  Absolutely brillant and addictive routine.  It is a Moderate to difficult workout, depending on your aerobic fitness level.  She uses repetitive reminders about the most important points in any workout, i.e... knees bent, go at your own pace, if you are having difficulty breathing or can't quite get the foot work, come back to the default marching position until you've recovered.

This is a low impact workout [one foot is always on the gorund] however, it should not be and is not ""too easy,"" especially when you first begin.  Some of the moves can be confusing, just don't get discouraged, she'll talk you through it.

The things that set this workout apart from others is what stays with you.  If you stick with this, the lessons go beyond fitness.  It will be ingrained and beocme second nature NEVER use your back, never lock your knees, always bend knees and use the strength from legs and arms when lifting heavy objects, walking on the treadmill, etc.

This is a routine that you'll reach for day after day.  I looked all over for it locally on DVD for the past ten years with no luck.  When I saw it on Amazon, I knew I had to have it but the cover was different so I held my breath until it arrived.  It is the same timeless workout I stumbled upon almost 20 years ago.  I was lucky to have found this, as so many work out videos get old fast, or you're distracted by personalities, too easy or is too ridiculously hard to follow.  This work out does not get old.  You will burn and learn!!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",1297036800,13,1922,4.95625
