Captain Troy Tempest leads his steadfast crew around the world under the sea in the miraculous ship, Stingray. The characters in this unusual production are all portrayed by marionettes  You will remember ""supermarionation"" from the way cool 1964 Stingray television series and from the ThunderBirds, another popular 1960's supermarionation series.  Stingray, Gerry Anderson's third SF supermarionation saga told the adventures of the WASPs (the World Aquanaut Security Patrol) as they explored the oceans and kept the world safe from a variety of perils. The WASP's main weapon was Stingray, a super-sub under the command of Troy Tempest. Troy's copilot was Phones, and they were often joined on missions by Marina, a princess of the undersea kingdom of Pacifica. Marina could breathe under water, but was unable to speak. In charge of the WASPs was gruff commander Shore, whose daughter Atlanta was both a member of his staff and Marina's rival for Troy's affection.  The spectacular special effects in this futuristic adventure were provided by movie magician Derek Meddings, world famous for the Superman and James Bond Films!",1182038400,,1261,5.358585858585859
