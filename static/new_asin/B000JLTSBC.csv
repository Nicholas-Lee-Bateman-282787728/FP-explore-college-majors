The lead character's a radical woman who takes what she wants from others rather than finding those elements within: mind, body and soul. I loved working with the people I worked with on this movie.",1213833600,,320,5.056603773584905
8290544,2,B000JLTSBC,"This was sexy and provocative psychological thriller, but it also had no point in it what so ever. She was crazy and depressed and needed help. And who was the little girl at the end. And what was the cause and effect in this movie. Yes there's nudity, hers only, and sexual acts. You really don't hear anything but see the visiuals. I'm still trying to figure what was the point into making a movie like this and what happened in her past that we don't see at all.. And yes she did help others see what was missing in thier lifes. The movie itself just plain stupid, and trying to feel sorry for her isn't the answer either. But my favorite part was the end were her best friend punches the sh---out of her.",1206489600,2,708,4.2518518518518515
8290545,1,B000JLTSBC,There is no plot.  No kind of ending.  Never comes together.  Title is the only good thing in this project.  Acting is worse than just bad.,1127865600,2,139,4.230769230769231
