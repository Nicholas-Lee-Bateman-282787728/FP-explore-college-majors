It's one of the few series that made me laugh out loud several times.  I did think Series 6 was disappointing but the other five were well worth the trouble. Stephen Tompkinson was hilarious as the corespondent named Damian.  If you have a way to view it, you won't be disappointed.",1240185600,,396,4.549295774647887
8265809,5,B0017DIL64,"It's been many, many years since I saw a handful of episodes on U. S. TV, but I've always remembered this series with great fondness.  I've searched for videos for a long time, and I'm glad they've finally released all six series on DVD in England.  Now, If they'd just release them in the U. S.  Until then, those of us with region-free DVD players can at least enjoy these long-missing gems.

The action takes place at Globelink Television News, beginning with a takeover by a notorious media mogul.  The new head honcho is unintelligible, the office manager is ineffective on a good day, and the entire team bickers, fights, teases, gambles and mocks their way through the day.  His deputy Alex, the lone sane voice, does her best to limit the damage.  One of the highlights of the series is Stephen Tompkinson who is brilliant as Damien the star reporter who would sell his grandmother for a story.

The Series 2 DVD contains all 13 episodes from the first season.",1218412800,,968,4.619883040935672
