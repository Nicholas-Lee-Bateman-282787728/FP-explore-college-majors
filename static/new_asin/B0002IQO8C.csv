I remember watching the 2001 airing of Bushnell's Secrets of the Hunt on the Nashville Network, or TNN for short, and I grew up watching Dave Watson on other shows like Bushnell Outdoors, Mathews TV, and his new show, The Journey, which all air on the Outdoor Channel. I know Bushnell's Secrets of the Hunt is obviously canceled after all this years, but I'm glad I found this DVD set showing some of the best hunting adventures they captured.",1491436800,,478,4.569767441860465
