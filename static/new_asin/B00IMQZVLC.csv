6281940,5,B00IMQZVLC,"I GREW UP WATCHING THIS SERIES, AND AS I GOT OLDER, I VERY MUCH WANTED TO OWN.  NOW THAT I DO, I REALIZE THE IMPACT IT HAD ON MY YOUNG LIFE.  BECAUSE , I ALWAYS ENJOYED WATCHING LLOYD BRIDGES IN ANYTHING HE WAS STARRING IN, AND THIS SERIES HELPED ME TO OVERCOME MY FEAR OF WATER AND SWIMMING.  I LEARNED TO SWIM AND LATER SKIN DIVE BECAUSE OF THE MANY FANYASTIC SIGHTS SEEN ON THIS SHOW.  PLUS WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT MR. BRIDGES IS ALSO THE FATHER OF ACTORS BEAU AND JEFF BRIDGES, THE NEXT GENERATION OF GREAT ACTORS.",1436918400,6,518,4.15

6281962,3,B00IMQZVLC,"People change as they get older, their taste as well as priorities. Sea hunt was a great show in its day. I still enjoy watching it but I don't view it today as I once did.",1453939200,,172,3.8055555555555554

I've got the original release which has 39 episodes and on disc 5 the last eposode is "" THE MANGANESE STORY"" and that episode is NOT listed on this release. If anyone has this please check and let us know if it is there.",1447027200,4,265,4.115384615384615
6281964,5,B00IMQZVLC,"I have been collecting retro tv shows from the 1950s and 1960s for nigh on five years now and purchase not only official releases but from friends on line from copies of old broadcasts etc and have amazed a massive collection of various series from many genres BUT when I have a half hour to kill this one show does blow the rest away. It is in my opinion overlooked today by this generation and certainly wouldn't have been had dear Lloyd been a rebel in his day. Its that good. I have never deep sea dived in my life but watching this in middle life I would dive tomorrow if someone was fool enough to take me out there. Joking aside honest guys this is up there in its own little genre like Gunsmoke, The fugitive, Outer Limits, Untouchables are in theirs. The narration throughout and the water sounds set a high level of suspense. I got my claws on grainy old copies  of season one several years ago and after viewing half a dozen shows in a row, I longed for the day I would own something as pristine as this and now I do. I pray before long I get the chance to own Casey Jones and especially Whirlybirds and 77 Sunset Strip. God Bless you Lloyd Bridges .I was too young to know of you while you were around but you should have received an award for this drama its better than many movies of the time that cost a lot more to make.",1444348800,9,1336,4.178294573643411
6281965,5,B00IMQZVLC,"Watched this as a kid and still enjoy seeing Mr. Bridges in this show.  Not a lot of wham, bam special effects...just good old clean and entertaining  TV.  So glad the studios are bringing out a lot of the old classic TV shows.  They are soooo much better than all the trashy shows now showing.",1443052800,5,294,4.290909090909091

8643471,5,B00IMQZVLC,"Very clear B/W remastered set.  I bought it because of a family rumor that our dad was in a scene and sure 'nuff he holds the perp at gunpoint while the INS (Immigration & Naturalization Service) makes the case against the human smugglers.  Series 1, episode 5, 'The Sea Sled'.  I was in kindergarten at the time (1957) and the producers asks for 3 volunteers to arrive in the Border Patrol boat and apprehend the bad guys.  My dad was in charge of the office in San Pedro, CA so off they went.  Ironically, I was a serious scuba diver for 40 years never knowing that my dad had met and worked with Lloyd Bridges.",1531008000,,613,4.2956521739130435
8643472,5,B00IMQZVLC,Awesome footage I started watching Sea Hunt when I was 10 years old in my later years this show got me and a few friends of mine into scuba diving back as a kid I did not understand all that scuba diving talk like the bends or rapture of the deep also known as nitrogen narcosis at certain a depth. I experienced nitrogen narcosis once on a wreck dive I quickly remembered what I learned while taking up scuba diving is to ascend 10 to 15 and it cleard up it was a weird feeling watching Sea Hunt on DVD bought back old memories I am nearly 70 years old now where has all the time I got into dry suit diving equipment really changed.,1521763200,,633,4.072
