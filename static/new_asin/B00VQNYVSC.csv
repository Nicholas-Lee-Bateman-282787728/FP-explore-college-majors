7101046,5,B00VQNYVSC,"realistic and believable tale which is very similar to the 1963 production of ""The Haunting"" with Julie Harris and Claire Bloom.

The only difference here is that the viewer is not convinced (at all) that the house is actually haunted.

It's a superb psychological drama which is actually more distressful than frightening. I say distressful rather than disturbing (although many people would prefer the latter) because nowadays we are so much more knowledgeable about various states of mental illness and PTSD related issues.

The genius in the writing reveals itself without a single flaw in terms of successfully making the viewer wonder whether or not the urban legend about the homes past is indeed the cause of the alleged manifestations or if it's completely hallucinatory or a combination of both.

Even the on and off relationship with the woman who is a Masters Degree candidate in psychology evokes a fully predictable and justifiably resentful response from the viewer. You know that she's attempting to manipulate him into a possible romance while being fully aware of his distraught condition. However, as his symptoms worsen, she simply dumps him rather than guide him to seek professional treatment.
I would love to hear the oral defense for her Masters thesis, however, according to the last scene she is murdered, he commits suicide and everybody is now living in the twilight zone.

One might question the purpose and importance of introducing such a character into the life of this man who loses his wife in a car accident.

I suspect that her character is an important catalyst that reinforces the doubt already embedded in the viewers minds and also serves to suggest that it is possibly she, rather than the house who is responsible for the worsening of his condition.
After all, his affair with her leaves him even more guilt ridden and conflicted and becomes increasingly unstable the more she attempts to manipulate his emotions  under the false pretense of trying to help him.

I hope there continues to be a bright future for Jody Quigley, who in my opinion is brilliant and writers Pete Cafaro and Andrew Kayros.",1431129600,4,2141,4.99438202247191

7101048,5,B00VQNYVSC,"Good acting - you can feel the three main characters' anguish.  It's rare for an horror films these days to capture emotions effectively.

Or else face the wrath of regret and a lighter wallet. But for those who just can't resist touching the stovetop after someone warns you that it's hot, seek help before watching this.

This was boring and NOT SCARY AT ALL. I am getting used to now no longer trusting the first 4 reviews here on Amazon when it comes to movies with Actors and Actresses I have never heard of. A typical movie of a jealous dead girlfriend. This movie is not scary at all and I would not even choose to watch it if it was free. You will regret it if you pay and watch this one. Rent out the Conjuring or even pull out one of the older scary movie to watch will make a better entertained night.",1433376000,,512,3.970873786407767
7101055,5,B00VQNYVSC,"As suggested by others, this film is more suspense than horror. It is well crafted and quite engaging. It builds very subtly, in fact so subtly, that it catches you by surprise.

7101062,5,B00VQNYVSC,"I thought i'd give this one a try and I was not disappointed. Very good psychological flick although I thought it was just another horror film. Well worth watching. If it was described as a psychological horror I would have watched it a lot sooner, but maybe that was the surprise that kept us interested.",1431993600,3,305,4.5636363636363635

7101064,5,B00VQNYVSC,"This one sneaks up on you. Just when you think you know where it's going, it takes a surprising turn that really draws you in. As stated by others, it's a psychological thriller, with enough horror elements to keep it creepy. One doesn't know where reality lies, even at the end of the movie, which is very interesting. I don't usually choose the horror genre, but watched it with my husband and was really hooked a few minutes in. The acting was also a cut above, especially by Jody Quigley, who gives a multi-layered, well-crafted performance.",1431820800,5,545,4.6875
7101065,4,B00VQNYVSC,"semi-spoiler alert.  The ending of this film was depressing.  The first hour of the film is inspired and subtle and believable.  I loved the main characters who were well developed.  The acting was quite good especially with the characters of Doug and Jaime.  The story starts out very successfully but the plot simply turns in ways that felt hollow to me: as the main character's descent in to madness is rather inexorable and even banal.  I expected a surprise or interesting plot twist, perhaps even something uplifting.  I'm often gratified when the powers of ""evil"" or the monster prevails or survives at the end of such films, but this film doesn't give me reason to relate to an anti-hero or the like.

The characters who were well developed in the first hour of the film suddenly became caricatures in the last half an hour, as two thirds of the primary cast then became figures of a deranged person's mind. The back third of the film is basically a nihilistic slasher film where as the first two thirds was really gripping, intriguing and promising.

Still it is another good and maturely conceived supernatural horror film, far better than the average production out these days. So if you like this genre, you may well appreciate the film as I did.",1431734400,3,1258,4.73394495412844

7101068,4,B00VQNYVSC,"This was an interesting, engaging movie. It has scary moments, for sure, but is really more of a surreal study on grief. While the acting is a bit soap opera stilted, the main characters were interesting enough to draw me in. The movie fooled me as it seemed to be going in one direction only to go in a completely opposite direction. I thought it was well filmed. The script could have used some punching up as at times things felt flat. For a b-movie horror film, this was far better than many I've seen. I enjoyed it, so I recommend it.",1431302400,7,539,4.294117647058823
8710890,4,B00VQNYVSC,"This was a relatively slow-paced horror film that was really more an exploration of psychological issues  in this case grief, loss, mourning, and moving on  than a ghost story, though it was definitely a ghost story mixed with the sub-genre (is it a sub-genre?) of films and stories in which there is an unreliable narrator and things aren't as they appear, with the revelation changing the entire plotline of the film in retrospect (_Fight Club_ anyone?). The closest examples I can think of that are similar is the 2005 Jennifer Connelly film _Dark Water_, a very well done grounded horror film that would have been quite good even without the horror elements, and the 2014 film _The Babadook_, a movie in which the horror and plot is thoroughly rooted in the personalities and personal histories of the main characters. _Apparition_ doesnt quite rise to the level of these two films but it does quite well I think.

_Apparition_ centers on three main character (with a couple of minor characters that come and go in the storyline). The central character is Doug, played by Jody Quigley, a man who is financially successful and was looking forward to essentially retiring quite young, renovating an old house and its associated out buildings out in the country, and also marrying the love of his life, Lori (played by Katrina Law).

Coming home from an engagement party with their friends  one in which a man neither wanted to show up crashed, a man that Lori might have had feelings for but never spent any time with, but a man Doug greatly disliked  Doug starts to drive too fast (over Loris objections) and there is a car accident. We never see the accident, nor the extent if any of Dougs physical injuries, but we know that Lori is dead.

We fast forward to Doug some time later, a man who is trying to decide what to do next in his life and is very obviously deeply depressed and truly mourns the loss of Lori, despite the fact that the night she died they were arguing and he was quite mad at her over the party crasher, with indications that maybe even their engagement was in jeopardy or otherwise on shaky ground. The argument to me felt like an issue they had argued about before and was more at that point about Doug holding a grudge then anything bad Lori actually did.

Doug tries to move on, helped a bit by a neighbor, a female grad student by the name of Jamie (played by Lili Bordan) and Dougs friend Connor (played by Dave Droxler) who lives farther away, both trying to help Doug and anchor him in the real world, both admirably allowing him to grieve and work out his problems himself, but often checking on him and reaching out to him. The story could have been one of a halting friendship and then romance between Doug and Jamie (especially, much more developed than the Doug-Connor friendship), with Doug trying to decide how to process Loris death, his role in it, whether or not getting out of the farmhouse would help him or if staying and completing the renovations would honor her memory, and we find that Jamie has a history of being drawn to psychologically damaged and sometimes quite abusive men. Though perhaps with my taste in movies not a film I would have sought out, it certainly had more than enough story potential to be a good film.

However, Doug has more to contend with then his complicated feelings and depression. This house is haunted. Super haunted. Complete with local legends, the crazy old man in town Who Knows, power that goes out every time it rains (remarked upon several times in the movie), and more and more strange sightings, Doug finds out that a woman lived there who used to lure servants from Ireland to work for her, used them for a bit, eventually trapping them, torturing them, and in the end killing them. Also by the way the last people who lived in the house all died in a mass axe slaying with the perpetrator committing suicided with a shotgun. So yesthe house was a place a lot of people died horribly.

It gets better! Doug starts to see not only the ghosts of past victims and the woman who murdered all her servants as well as the ghost of one servant, but also sees Lori and has long drawn out conversations and later fights with her. She mourns the life they could have had, is jealous of his current life, and is angry that he killed her (accident though it was).

As the story progresses, it becomes unclear how much of the ghosts from the previous inhabitants and Lori are real and how much are part of Dougs slow descent into madness.

I generally liked it. It had a few good jump scares, I liked the creepy house, I found Jamies character interesting and the actress playing her did a good job, and liked the somewhat twist, somewhat ambiguous ending. There was some good foreshadowing as to what Really Happened and how much of it was the fault of the ghosts and how much of the fault of, well, other things. I liked the strange opening, the meaning of which was revealed much later in the film.

Things I didn't care for included Doug himself. Fine actor, I get the character was depressed, but the people in his life that cared for him  Lori, Jamie, and Connor  must have been very charitable people who saw the goodness in others as Doug wasn't always sympathetic. He seemed prone to grudges, jealousy, rage, and could be a bit unpleasant, even allowing for his profound grief and living in a haunted house.

In addition, I think there was too much going on with the hauntings in the house and it got a bit tangled. The Lori ghost aspect was very well fleshed out, but the woman serial killer aspect seemed plopped down, was huge in a scene or two, and then fell away not to really be used again. The plot thread about the family that killed themselves there only briefly figured into the narrative and was even less developed. I would have just focused on the Lori ghost and left the other elements out, or when they were included tone them down so that the viewer doesnt feel they were just dropped when they don't really appear later.

The movie was definitely a slow burn much of the time, only really picking up in the last third or so. I don't think it dragged and it was never going to be a story that I think lent itself to a very fast pace, but at times it could perhaps have moved in a little bit faster pace.",1524355200,,6307,4.503937007874016
8710891,3,B00VQNYVSC,"well made ....good quality ...more than a horror story, it is a story of decent into madness through grief...it is so gradual that it feels slow moving and tedious ....also they don't work the angle that the house is malevolent and  driving him mad . The element of the malicious evil haunted house is rather bland.
