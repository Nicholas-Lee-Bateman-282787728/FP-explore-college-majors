8129529,5,B000G8NY0O,"Hare+Guu is a surrealistic masterpiece of never-ending antics. This show is less repetitive than a lot of other anime series out there, which allowed me to watch the entire thing in a weekend or so without wondering when it will end - which has happened to me before. Even though the show is not incredibly plot-heavy, I would not suggest watching it out of order. The addition of characters might really confuse one. The animation is smooth, the voice acting is quite good, and even the subtitles are fairly close to the dub. I heavily recommend watching it with subtitles anyway for when those rare conflicts in translation and dubbing occur - it will provide more insight to the situational comedy. The opening theme didn't even really ""get old"" for me, which was surprising. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys comedy!",1320364800,,824,4.809859154929577
8129530,5,B000G8NY0O,"Guu's purpose in life seems to consist of pulling Hare's chain! Even though somehow you know she cares about him, (whatever she is....an alien? an android?), she delights in causing him trouble. When he wishes his mom was different (she's an alcholic floozy), Guu, inspired by a magical girl anime decides that she has magic powers that allow her to change people's personalities, and she's not playing! Pretty soon she's zapping all the villagers with Hare's sensibilities dictating what is good and bad about each person. He soon finds out that wishes are not neccesarily a good thing and Guu is able to teach him a lesson about accepting people for who they are. And then there's weirdo doctor and supposed father of Hare, Dr. Clive, who unfortunately takes his role as physical examiner of the school's children a little too pervertedly so Guu knocks him out. She gets him back though as her and Hare sic the afro-coiffured Dama on his trail as she hunts him mercilessly, parodying Alien, the Exorcist, and the Grudge in the process, creating some real moments of terror. Hare's worst nightmare comes true when Marie convinces everyone to play house with her, Clive and Weda playing husband and wife, with Hare and Guu playing their pets! Oh, the humanity!

Hare+Guu has always reminded me more of an American type cartoon than most Japanese anime. A lot of Japanese comedies involve amphetamine humor that hits so fast it could possibly make your heart stop. I'm thinking of shows like Excel Saga and Kodocha as examples. The jokes are so rushed and the voice acting so annoying that little enjoyment is to be had. Hare+Guu is a bit more laidback than that, even though it can be just as bizarre and surreal. The aspect that makes the show work is Guu. If she had been some screaming hyperactive kid running all over the place I would have hated this show. But instead she reminds me of Snoopy from the Peanuts comic strip, with her half opened eyes and langourous movements. The artists don't even give her well-defined features like fingers and feet as though she could just ooze into a puddle at anytime because she's so relaxed. But when she does speak or do outrageous things, it makes it even more funny. Hare is left to be her own personal excitable fool to her straightman act. That's probably another thing I like about it. Hare+Guu make a great comedy team in an age where there are practically zero famous comedy teams in America and haven't been for decades. I'm very curious as to what or who Guu really is. Again, in this volume she transforms into a beautiful adult version of herself but with no explanation. Who is she really? This is a very very very funny show. Please check it out.",1168992000,,2706,4.684873949579832
