8385636,5,B0030BZN3K,More of an old Saturday morning favorite. And who doesn't love Mr. Magoo? Great nostalgic viewing. Antiques for your TV pleasure.,1375142400,,129,5.190476190476191
8385637,4,B0030BZN3K,"Rated this with 4 stars instead of 5 only because the DVD sticks and catches and skips in places.  Otherwise, it's perfect.  Really love seeing the originals in black and white.",1359072000,,177,4.67741935483871
8385638,4,B0030BZN3K,"This CD brings back a lot of memories.  This was a classic cartoon show with some great lines, even though the animation was pretty basic.  i thought there might have been some later colour episodes but I might be wrong.  I'd love to get hold of some more episodes.",1331683200,,265,4.36734693877551
8385639,4,B0030BZN3K,"Calvin and the Colonel is quire rare, which is why I give this burned DVD-R four stars.  The mastering is passable, made from used 16mm release prints.  Lines & splices are at a minimum & do not deter from the enjoyment.  The first episode runs only 22 minutes, the second (missing the titles) runs 25 minutes.  The last two are the complete shows with original commercials running 29 minutes.

Video compression, while not bad, is noticable even on a standard defenition television, especially on the last two episodes. I would have given up the bonus public domain cartoons that we already have on other pressed DVDs to reduce the compression on this burned DVD-R disc.

A nice bonus is the rarely seen UPA Mr. Magoo educational cartoon INSIDE MR. MAGOO.
The print suffers from more scratch lines that the other cartoons on this disc, but the colors are good.  The lines seem to clean up as the cartoon progresses.

The limited MENU does not allow you to access the other bonus cartoons individually, you can only select ""Bonus Cartoons"" & scan through all 35 minutes worth at once.

This is a ""Must-Have"" for cartoon & TV Show collectors until a pressed DVD is ever released by the owners of the master negatives.  The show was produced by KAY-RO productions who joined with Universal-TV to do ""The Munsters"", so maybe NBC-Universal has the originalnegatives.  Even if they released it, you would not get the original commercials or the Mr. Magoo short.",1274227200,,1456,4.784
8385640,5,B0030BZN3K,"This cartoon show from the early 1960s is sort of an animated version of Amos and Andy with a southern fox and bear. It's very reminiscent in style to Underdog and it's pretty funny. Each of the 4 episodes is patterned like a situation comedy. It's sort of like Amos and Andy reworked for animation, and it probably works better than Amos and Andy. As for -Inside Magoo- that must be seen to be believed. Imagine, Mr. Magoo worried about cancer of all things. Cartoon characters of Mr. Magoo's fame are never interested in such real human problems like cancer, but in this short film, there it is. It's actually done pretty tastefully, and Jim Backus, the voice of Magoo, shows us what a visit to the doctor is like. Weird! Also on the DVD is a collection of classic cartoons, including one of my favorites, Corny Concerto. I love the scene where Porky Pig pries Bugs Bunny's hands apart to reveal what looks like a bra! Wow!",1260489600,2,925,4.511904761904762
