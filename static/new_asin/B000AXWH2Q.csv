8080126,5,B000AXWH2Q,"There is subtle hints of yaoi throughout the series.  If you love a good monarchy, then this series is for you. There is tons of action and magic, but it also has a great story line.  Well worth adding to your collection!",1357171200,,221,4.238095238095238

I only have up to Vol. 5.",1351728000,,109,3.4
8080128,4,B000AXWH2Q,"I bought the first of this series while looking for something yaoish and funny, and was quite pleased with the results. I own the entire season 1, and season 2, vol. 1-3.

Yuri is a funny, engaging young man who is secretly the heir to the Demon Kingdom's throne, but he only finds out after being 'flushed' down a toilet while being harassed by some ruffians. Out he emerges into an alternative world where he is quickly the centre of attention by those who will be his subjects, advisors, friends and enemies.

Lots of endearing companions along the way with the 3 main ones being a trio of half brothers, Conrad (his protector), Gwendal (his lieutenant of sorts) and Wolfram, the youngest, whom he mistakingly becomes engaged to over a faux pas at the dinner table, and Yuri's advisor, Gnther, who is often a squealing, over emotional bishounin who is very beautiful and totally in love with his liege. Occasional silliness along the way as well as great battles, intrigue, and romantic situations while Yuri learns what it really means to be the Demon King.

If you are looking for explicit or direct yaoi references, you won't really find it here. Sure you'll see Yuri's unexpectedly male fiance rather often in his bed, occasionally in a negligee, or another man at arms totally tricked out in drag, but its mostly just in fun, since everyone but his enemies love Yuri in one way or another, but can't have him all to themselves.

Harmless fun, great anime. I am looking forward to getting all episodes before they become too expensive as I've heard Geneon has been bought out or otherwise won't be producing these in the US anymore, so they are going to be harder to find at average price.

The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that one can grow rather tired of some of the characters overbearing personalities (Wolfram especially)but hey, it makes them more memorable. I can't wait to see what happens in the final episodes and wish there would be a satisfying conclusion.",1198454400,4,1986,4.679083094555874
8080129,5,B000AXWH2Q,"KKM is one of the best animes I've ever had the pleasure of watching. It's funny, sad, heart-warming, and you really end up falling in love with it's characters. If you're looking for something really different, than this is the anime for you.",1142380800,8,243,4.674418604651163
