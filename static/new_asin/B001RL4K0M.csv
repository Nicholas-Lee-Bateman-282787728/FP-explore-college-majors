Unfortunately, this film tries to cash in on the poker craze and takes advantage of unsuspecting poker aficionados.

Don't waste your money (save it for the next session's chips), as this film very briefly touches on a poker game and is nothing like Rounders in brilliantly conveying what the game and lifestyle are all about.

I can't fathom why so many reviews of the movie are positive.  It's a boring, low budget, poorly-acted film that is definitely a B flick.

Fold this hand.  Right now!",1270166400,5,649,4.591304347826087
3777032,5,B001RL4K0M,"I had to watch this movie a few times, just to catch all the little clues that lead to the plot twist at the end. This movie has a good plot, but the real focus of the movie is on the acting. The behaviour, the eye-contact, the facial expressions. And it's all good.",1252972800,3,266,4.037735849056604
3777033,4,B001RL4K0M,"""The Poker Club"", which I saw at a film festival, examines the bad choices we make when we take our life for granted, and shows how they can come back to haunt us. It is a thriller that, for the most part, keeps a strong momentum going, and has a lively cast of characters (although it is an unrealistically good looking group). It's a lot of fun to watch, is not going to strain anyone's braincells, but is much more emotionally involving than most films of this kind. Judy Reyes, who is from the TV show Scrubs, plays a detective. It's a much different role for her, and she gives a standout performance. Also, Lori Huering is very impressive.",1242691200,,645,4.428571428571429
3777034,5,B001RL4K0M,"Effortless... Based on reading one preview article and Judy Reyes' involvement, I saw The Poker Club. I wasn't let down, for once. This story is of an accidental murder after an innocuous poker game (Hosted by Johnathon Schaech) among friends. Soon enough, it becomes clear that almost everyone who appears to be an innocent bystander to the homicide in the beginning, actually has MUCH deeper problems. I love how this story is told... every time a guilty party is approached by a cop (In most cases, Reyes, the lead detective), your stomach sinks. You really don't want anyone to be caught, even though you know what happened was horrible. In the end, everything is wrapped up nicely, and though no moment in the movie is happy, I'm glad I saw it. It portrays the guilt of all those involved better than most movies.",1241827200,5,818,4.7272727272727275
3777035,5,B001RL4K0M,"Poker Club is one of those smaller genre films that could easily get lost in the shuffle were it not for Tim McCann's tight, smart and stylish direction. This is not the first time we've seen this kind of film, where one mistake leads to a series of disasterous choices by the hero. McCann's first foray into genre filmmaking is informed by his more individual indie style. He captures his audience and moves the film at breakneck speed building to an unusal and unexpected ending. Entertaining and well worth seeing for the fine acting and directing.",1240099200,7,551,4.75
3777036,5,B001RL4K0M,"Not really a poker movie, but a character driven thriller. Tim McCann is an excellent, underrated director who always brings a gritty edge to his movies. Nice performances and snappy direction elevate this nifty crime drama.",1240012800,7,224,5.25
3777037,5,B001RL4K0M,"I saw this at a screening and liked it. It's a murder mystery thriller in the vein of a Hitchcock film, but with a contemporary spin to it. The direction was solid, the actors good and the script kept me guessing.",1240012800,6,213,4.219512195121951

8338161,4,B001RL4K0M,"This movie was very suspenseful from the start till the end and never got bored watching it.  The ending surprised me as well and had to think about it for a second to put it all together but am sure I have it correct.  If you like suspenseful thrillers then you should enjoy it.
