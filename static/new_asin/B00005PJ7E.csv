1642182,4,B00005PJ7E,"This flick is a strange mix of some slapstick/rediculous humor and very dark and violent events and people. There are several clever lines, some good music, some philosophizing about politics and human nature, a murder mystery, and a cat and mouse game that takes many absurd turns. The ""romantic"" aspects that are played up in the descriptions and trailer are really negligeable to the whole thing. It's so ambitious as to not be beleived but somehow you can allow them that. The humor is very silly, and the serious or sad aspects really are very pathetic. I'm not sure the term ""dark humor"" is really aplicable to this; while I think of that as being more of laughing at the rediculousness of an ugly and violent situation, in this movie, it's more like there are 2 planes, humore and drama, that merely co-exist. I couldn't give a logical reason why but it worked for me. It was probably a lot of the one liners and the performances of the entire cast which created very amusing characters. Our hero protagonist is a real loser who you can't help but like in spite of his being slime. I'm very easily swayed by a good laugh and this film was sooo much funnier than expected. I can see how it might not be for everyone. Hope you like it.",1189382400,,1240,4.491150442477876

1642184,5,B00005PJ7E,"A vastly underrated film that was practically ignored by both critics and viewers, Divorcing Jack is a highly enjoyable, and often powerful, film with a terrific cast and a very clever title that keeps you interested to the last minute. It's good to see David Thewlis, one of the finest British actors of his generation, play the lead in a British film - as he did in his prime, and not a side character in Hollywoodian films like Harry Potter. His performance in Divorcing Jack isn't quite as remarkable as the one he gave five years before in Naked but it's fantastic by its own right, and just like in Naked Thewlis creates an anti-hero that is egoistic, weak, detestable, and entirely believable; if you're looking for a noble hero to sacrifice himself for the greater good because that's the right thing to do, look elsewhere. Dan Starkey cares for himself and makes excuses for nobody; and that makes him a protagonist you can relate to.

There are some neat surprises in the supporting cast: Australian born Rachel Griffiths - AKA Brenda Chenowith of HBO's terrific Six Feet Under - who was practically anonymous in 1998, is terrific as Thewlis' stripper-in-nun's-clothing sidekick, and supplies some of the film's funniest moments. Jason Isaacs, who, like Thewlis, has recently familiarized himself with American audiences through the Harry Potter movies, in bone-chillingly excellent in the lead villain role. The beautiful Laura Fraser (who had recently made a career for herself in Hollywood with supporting roles in movies like Titus, Vanilla Sky, and A Knight's Tale; but anyone who happened to catch the excellent BBC mini-series Neverwhere will surely remember her as the charming Door) has a part that's brief but unforgettable. American TV regular Richard Grant is lovely and believable as the visiting reporter from the US who came to cover the upcoming elections but is more interested in learning about the difference between the different types of scotch. And experienced British actor Robert Lindsay steals the show as the dodgy candidate. Finally, a brief but hilarious cameo from the charming Bronagh Gallagher (The Commitments) as a taxi driver.

The film's messages about the horrors and idiocy of war and particularly the Irish civil war are familiar and would have been corny in a straight drama, but as in Catch-22 and other classic black comedies, the absurd humor of the film makes it powerful. If you take any of the two aspects of the film - comedic or political - and separate it from the other, maybe it really isn't all that good. Perhaps that's why it failed to find its audience in the US and most of Europe. Myself, I've lived my entire life in Israel, and am familiar with a war between two neighboring factions that always seems on the brink of resolution just before the situation explodes again, and that has its highest price in the innocent lives of people on both sides who just want to be left alone in peace, while the leaders of both peoples carry on their senseless warmongering. Divorcing Jack has a simplistic view of the situation but it's important to make it heard. The ending is inevitable and almost predictable, yet it's the only proper ending this story could possibly have. Divorcing Jack is highly recommended; it's neither a romantic comedy nor a straight thriller, but it's a good and powerful film to enjoy and to think about.",1155945600,,3390,4.90418118466899
1642185,5,B00005PJ7E,"I knew almost nothing about this movie when I bought it, other than the fact that David Thewlis and Jason Isaacs (both of Harry Potter fame) were in it.  So imagine my delight when it turned out to be an incredibly entertaining black comedy about the unrest in Ireland.  It has a seemingly serious premise--incriminating statements by an up-and-coming politician are hidden on a tape of Dvorak, which is given to a drunken Belfast reporter by a young woman who later dies to protect it--which is given an absolutely ridiculous execution.  The quirky and the malevolent and the monumentally incompetent exist side-by-side in this version of Belfast, and it makes for some seriously entertaining viewing.  The highlights?  The nun-o-gram (Rachel Griffiths) who repeatedly rides to the rescue of our hapless reporter, the menacing, but verra sexy IRA thug, ""Cow"" Pat Keegan (Jason Isaacs, gorgeous in a blue shirt and black pants), and the female taxi driver (Bronagh Gallagher) whose patter (replete with creative use of the F-word) is the funniest thing in the movie.

The DVD has no extras to speak of, but the movie's great.  Highly recommended.",1149292800,,1146,5.0638297872340425
1642186,4,B00005PJ7E,".... This movie is for you. Now, now one shouldn't make fun of the Northern Irish situation the way it was 10- 15 years ago, but the movie isn't all about it. Do not misunderstand me the whole Irish war thing plays a part in this movie but let's meet the main character....

Starkey.... A drink-a-lot -of- beer happy Irish guy who works for a news paper always on the edge of being kicked out if he doesn't deliver a good story soon!!! He happens to meet some high positioned politicians daughter who happened to be the ex girlfriend of a loony terrorist/ dealer named Cow Pat Keegan < I think I wrote the name right > . And even though Starkey is married and loves his wife he falls for the gal who is killed in the 1st third of the movie.

Starkey  now on the search for the gals killer meets a whole bunch of people along the way some of em funnier then others, realizing somewhere down the road that the last words of the dieing gal weren't Divorcing Jack but...... oh I almost  told you ... you going to have to find that one out for yourself.

Fact of the matter is one either likes this movie or hates it. I personally liked the dark humor. It's a change from the usual oh so happy bubbly comedies that we have come accustomed with. And even though some of the parts in this movie don't seem to make sense I believe that's the point making the movie even funnier.

Sadly there haven't been any extra's on the DVD; so if you are looking for interviews on the movie by cast and crew you are not going to get that. And it's a movie for grown ups only due to all the bad words in  it you know F and S words  which one shouldn't be surprised by since the movie is as Irish as it can be.  Some of you might have trouble to understand the sometimes thick accent but its still worth seeing this movie!!!!",1125014400,,1803,4.143266475644699
1642187,4,B00005PJ7E,"Divorcing Jack is a hilarious, preposterous romp that ain't gonna be up most folk's alley. It's got a top drawer cast that one wishes, perhaps, were in a slightly better film, but they make the most of the material and often take it up a notch or two beyond where one expects it to go.

David Thewlis is terrific as Starkey and he bumbles through plot twists that are almost dizzying.  Joining him is a terrific performance by Aussie actress, Rachel Griffiths, who at this point in her career seems capable of doing just about anything.  Her gun toting stripper nun bit is priceless.

Obviously, from so many negative reactions, Divorcing Jack is not a typical feel good film, but for those who enjoy figuring out the nearly indecipherable, double crossing agents, chase scenes, strippers in nun drag, symbolism, the ongoing situation in Northern Ireland tossed with some bitter, black and often delicious humour, check out Divorcing Jack.  You just might surprise yourself!",1123113600,,974,4.950920245398773
1642188,1,B00005PJ7E,"I realize that may sound a bit harsh, but trust me, this is the worst film ever made.  The main character is completely pathetic and unsympathetic.  He is drunk or hung over during most of the film; and trust me, David Thewlis (also known as the Man Who Killed Remus Lupin, for his absolute slaughter of one of the most beloved contemporary children's lit characters in HP3) is not a fun drunk.

There are portions of this film I think may have been intended to be funny, but have simply caused permenant psychological scarring to occur.  This man, Thewlis, should never be allowed to take his clothes off on film.  I have since had to learn to trust my new guide dog as I was forced to gouge out my own eyes.

The pinnacle of horror in this film came not from the actual killing of the young woman he was having an affair with, (she was obviously seriously disturbed), but from his sitting on the couch, covered in her blood, her dead body lying in the next room while he had a beer with her dog.

This was NOT darkly funny.  This was NOT British humor.  This was just a plain, bad movie.",1111795200,,1089,4.299019607843137
1642189,4,B00005PJ7E,"I loved this film. It's a cute comedy that is definatly a must have for any Thewlis fans. I agree with the fact that it's a dark comedy. I strangely found myself cracking up at the absurdness of the ""serious scenes."" I'm just upset that on my copy I didn't get any of the extra footage!",1106352000,,286,4.125
1642190,1,B00005PJ7E,"David Thewlis, why did you accept such a sucky script? The crappy acting, poor timing, and superficial characters totally detract from any underlying political message. This movie's main character is a philandering idiot and nothing more. His wife is even less believable and likable. There is a gratuitously violent and totally outlandish scene in which the only good character in this film is defenestrated, but of course the idiot gets away. What happens to his mistress should have happened to the script, before this ever made it to production. I love independent films, I love David Thewlis' acting, but even after two years I still have a yucky taste in my mouth from this piece of poo called a movie. If you want more David Thewlis, see ""Seven Years in Tibet"" or ""Life is Sweet"", instead.",1090454400,,796,4.860294117647059
1642191,4,B00005PJ7E,"This movie is an offbeat, dark comedy, which brings to light the corrupt political climate of Northern Ireland and the presence of the IRA.
David Thewlis plays his quirky character to the hilt and beatifully balances the seriousness of the IRA ex-con, Pat Keegan (Jason Isaacs).
I loved this movie, with all of it's wit and humor.  See it, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!",1057449600,,381,4.7727272727272725
1642192,4,B00005PJ7E,"""Divorcing Jack"", based on a novel by Colin Bateman, has a number of interesting characters including a nurse who moonlights as a stripping nun and an Afro-American CIA agent named Charlie Parker It takes place in the early 90s when the Peace Process was staggering forward. Fortunately, Bateman wrote the screenplay and chopped out enough of the inside political fol-de-rol for an outsider to follow the story without too much confusion. Its billed as a Comedy-Thriller and David Thewlis acts the part of besotted Protestant newspaper columnist Paul Starkey with enough world weariness to be believable. There are as many twists and turns as the road through the Glens of Antrim and the message, meant for those who are doomed to repeat history, comes through dynamically at the close.
 There are a number of interesting writers and films from and about the North, not the least of which is ""An Everlasting Piece"" though that seems to have been torpedoed by Stephen Speilberg. There are still clunkers of the terrorist/ /torturer type, but hopefully theyll fade out in the future; if we have learned from the past.",999475200,,1115,4.994623655913978

7949302,5,B00005PJ7E,"Popular Northern Irish novelist Colin Bateman wrote the screenplay for this 1998 film, based on his novel Divorcing Jack, an example of the dark romantic comedy/thriller that has become his trademark.

Dan Starkey, played by David Thewliss with dynamic, nearly accidental Northern charm, is a Belfast newspaper columnist who incurs wrath from his wife for his womanizing and from his editor for not toeing the newspaper's political line.

After his editor yells at him to ""find a real story!"" we next see him drinking copious amounts of beer on a bench in the Botanic Gardens, where he meets a young student, later ending up in bed with her and soon getting mixed up in murder and a political cover-up. Pursued alternately by IRA and loyalist thugs, the police, and the politician's henchmen, Starkey races to find the killer before the murder is pinned on him---and the thugs finish off his wife and best friend.

Along the way he meets a few helpmates---an American journalist (Richard Gant) and a beautiful nurse (and part-time stripper) dressed as a gun-wielding nun (Rachel Griffiths). Dan's own disguise includes a messy woman's blonde wig and a denim `70s ensemble a friend finds at a charity shop. (""These trousers are slightly flared!"" he objects loudly, right before the cops burst in.)

Directed by David McCaffrey at a fast comic pace, the film is full of dark and quick Northern wit, quirky character acting and an intelligent script that give it a style similar to Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction, but with a Northern Irish political reality rumbling in the background like a gathering storm. Similar to Pulp Fiction, this film also includes the fun presence of Bronagh Gallagher, here playing a very funny, slightly put-out Belfast cab driver.

Not suitable for children under 17. Very suitable for anyone wanting a funny and slightly dramatized glimpse into Belfast life before peace had been fully secured.
