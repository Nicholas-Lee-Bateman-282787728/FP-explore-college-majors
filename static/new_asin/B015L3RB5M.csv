8733902,5,B015L3RB5M,So cool. I wish they had more than 2 seasons.,1495324800,,45,3.6
8733903,3,B015L3RB5M,"Slightly dissapointed. I'm not sure why but this disc set will blur out some of the gore and occasionally runs Japanese text across the screen. The season 1 standalone disc I have does not. It seems ""bootleggy"" but legit at the same time. I'm not an expert on cartoons, that's just my take, there may be a valid reason to it all",1485561600,2,328,4.306451612903226

8733906,2,B015L3RB5M,the dvd i got started out ok but 3 episodes in i noticed it must be a bootleg every opening and closing sequence was either cut short or almost non existent and the more episodes i watched the worse the Quality towards the last 9 episodes it became increasingly pixilated and would start to skip and i would have to stop  and try again and this last episode i'm on that made me write this review took 47 min to watch a 20 somthing min long episode.... very disappointed!,1468022400,10,470,4.280898876404494
