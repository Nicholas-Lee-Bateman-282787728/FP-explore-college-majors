8168414,5,B000MG160K,"Krokus one of the first metal bands of the late 70's early 80's like UFO, Motorhead, Iron Maiden, Scorpions,
Blackfoot, Riot, Whitesnake, Saxon etc...and of course ACDC which the singer sounds a lot like Bon Scott
but there music was great rock and roll and their album No Vices is a 80's metal rock classic! Too bad they
lost it after Headhunter but never made a bad album. This is a mix of live songs and videos which I would
rather more live songs. They kicked butt live and it shows the great songs and live show they had. I believe
this show was filmed when they opened for KISS which I saw them many times always kicked butt. But
the best was in 1980 on their No Vices tour! Too bad that is not available anywhere. This will have to do.",1482019200,,742,4.232394366197183
8168415,5,B000MG160K,What a great show!!! There are not too many Krokus live video releases out there. This has 2 videos that are great but the best part is the live show. Just amazing. They were at their peak at this time. Enjoy!!!!!,1403481600,,213,4.219512195121951
