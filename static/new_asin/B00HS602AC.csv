8635358,4,B00HS602AC,This workout packs a lot of punch in 20 minutes.  It could benefit more from a better warm up and the back exercises could be better.  I find that it creates too much stress on my lower back.  I took a star away because of that and the very very short warm up.,1527897600,,260,3.8679245283018866
8635359,5,B00HS602AC,"I really enjoyed this workout! I generally will do it after my Daily Burn Anja Garcia Advanced Inferno or Inferno HR workouts. In my estimation, I believe it's an medium to high intermediate level. II have always enjoyed Cindy Whitmarsh's workouts, her training advice and her 'can-do' positive attitude. I have followed her since her workouts first appeared on Exercise TV.",1524528000,,374,5.147540983606557
