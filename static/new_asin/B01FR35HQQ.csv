7751370,4,B01FR35HQQ,"SPOILER ALERT:  This is an excellent documentary about a sad case; but more, it is a strong commentary on a huge social problem this country has -- its gun culture and the laws that enable fear-infested people to carry.  Unfortunately, those are the ones who DO carry, so it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.  The jury reached the right verdict, and I would have been livid if they had acquitted him, as I was livid over the George Zimmerman acquittal.  In both these cases, the shooters initiated contact without good reason to do so.  I don't know if it was ever brought up in the trial over this shooting, but why even confront teenagers over loud music at a gas station?  You're going to be leaving in a few minutes, so what's really the issue?  Teenagers love their music, and they like it loud.  When parents aren't present, even well-behaved teenagers will sometimes get lippy with a stranger who first makes a derogatory remark about them and then tries to tell them what to do.  And just so a reader doesn't jump to conclusions before reading what I have to say next, I will disclose that I am a white, middle-aged female.  I've gotten irritated by loud public music myself.  Honestly, I'd rather listen to rap than heavy metal.  And I have listened to quite a bit of rap as I like many kinds of music.  Does that make me a thug, even though I spent most of my life working in high-responsibility office jobs, mostly in law offices?  Michael Dunn was so difficult to believe, I was surprised the first jury was hung on the murder count.  He clearly lied about the things that were said and done; and then he took off, which indicates he knew he had crossed the line even before he heard about Jordan's death.  It also sounds like he probably had an alcohol level that was too high to be driving, and that may have also played into the several really bad decisions he made that day.  His fiancee's testimony revealed his lies, and the telephone conversations with his fiancee were very revealing.  The man has no insight into his own personality or his responsibility for the situation at all.  I thought the remark about people being too ""afraid to tell them to pull their pants up"" was his attitude in a nutshell.  No, I don't like the low pants, either, but it's none of my business -- and it's none of his.  Given that this grown man does not even understand social boundaries, I'm glad he's off the streets with his gun.  I hope that others like him sit up and take notice, and I hope the states tighten the definitions of the stand-your-ground standards.  That defense never should have come into play in this case.  My heart goes out to Jordan's parents, and I commend them for their strength in sharing their experience to bring about change.",1480982400,15,2754,4.539553752535497
7751371,5,B01FR35HQQ,"I came across this on HBO's documentary channel. I had heard of the incident though not to the extent of Trayvon Martin's murder earlier that year. It was shocking to me that Michael Dunn could actually believe he was being physically threatened, but even if he had, he continued shooting when the SUV tried to retreat. I was glad that Dunn' s fiancee did not lie for him, and while it  took two trials to get the job done, he received life without parole. I admire the strength and resolve of Jordan's parents, even through their intense grief.",1473638400,4,545,4.561224489795919
7751372,5,B01FR35HQQ,"This is a UK made documentary about a young black teen who was shot to death in the car he was in with three other dark skinned teens at a Florida petrol station by an old large white guy who took exception to loud rap music playing from their stereo. The man on trial drove off and upon being caught a few days later claimed the teen had a gun and that he shot him in self defence using the bizarre Florida stand your ground laws, which meant unlike under the old system, the fact you had plenty of time to flee from danger isn't taken into consideration. The documentary is quite good. I hadn't heard of this case so had no idea if the old white guy (Michael Dunn) would get off since even though it was apparent to everyone at the scene that there was no guns or other weapons with the teenagers, the ridiculous stand your ground laws don't seem to need there to have been one. Simply because this old white guy assumed all black teens are gang members out to kill white people if they anger them, assumed his life was in danger, gives him the right to shoot them. The documentary follows the trial and splices in phone calls from the prison to Dunn's fiance who was inside the petrol station paying for alcohol at the counter when he shot at the teens. There are interviews with the family, protesters in the street who saw the shooting as a race hate crime as well as the general public in vox pop interviews in the street. Besides the main hour and half long feature (on the region 4 DVD) there is also a 45 minute Q & A session with the father of the teen and the director of the documentary that took place after a screening of the film in the UK. There is also the full police interview (well probably just one of them, but the one after he was brought in) where (spoilers to how the trial turns out ) you are under no doubt whatsoever that Dunn is lying and the two police interviewing him rip apart his claims, pointing out things such as how small the victim and even his friends if they had all attacked him were in comparison to him so it's no real likely they would be telling him they are about to kill him. The police interview with his fiance where she contradicts the story Dunn used in both the police interview and as part of his defence in the trial is also quite interesting.

The Q & A session isn't edited at all and there's lots of wait until to the mike reaches you, and lots of stuff that could have been edited out without losing any actual question and answering content. It does raise stuff that wasn't in the documentary, such as those watching it assumed the fiance made a change of mind conscience bothering her decision to admit he never mentioned the teens having a weapon to her, when the victim's father thinks she just didn't want to perjure herself in court which would have sent her to jail since she admitted all that in her police interview (the one in the extras). There was also an interesting story about the guy who got the licence plate number who was wanted by the police himself so by reporting it to the police ended up in jail for seven years and was brought into the trial in chains when he testified. None of that was included in the documentary. The Q & A also talks about Americas gun laws which aren't tackled at all in the documentary for some reason.",1466899200,,3309,4.285942492012779

7751374,4,B01FR35HQQ,"This is a well constructed documentary concerning the highly publicized shooting and killing of teen Jordan Davis by Michael David Dunn. This took place November 23, 2012 in Jacksonville, Florida and had deep implications. Dunn claimed self defense under the stand your ground law as tensions ensued over the playing of loud rap music.

The themes included seeded racism and distrust. Stand Your Ground is the new Jim Crow which allows whites to shoot blacks because they feel threatened by them and how can a jury determine how one feels? This documentary pieced together actual statements and trial footage. I don't recall any re-enactment. The testimony is done in pieces in order to present a chronological order of events. Dunn's side of the issue is also presented, but keep in mind the intent of the film was not to exonerate him.

""In ""Race, law, and health: Examination of 'Stand Your Ground' and defendant convictions in Florida,"" researchers Nicole Ackermann, Melody S. Goodman, Keon Gilbert, Cassandra Arroyo-Johnson, and Marcello Pagano combed through data from a Tampa Bay Times investigation. They further examined the 204 cases in the state in which Stand Your Ground was cited as a defense against homicide or some other violent act and the results were, sadly, not surprising. The study found that in cases argued from 2005 to 2013, juries were twice as likely to convict the perpetrator of a crime against a white person than against a person of color. ""These results are similar to pre-civil rights era statistics, with strict enforcement for crimes when the victim was white and less-rigorous enforcement with the victim is non-white,"" the researchers report.""

8761238,5,B01FR35HQQ,"Thank you Marc for this documentary. We need to shed more light on the ""stand your ground law""  there is so much misconstrued statements concerning it.

8761241,5,B01FR35HQQ,"Great documentary of the tragedy happened in Jacksonville. I think all people should watch this and respect the humanity. There were days in history when people needed gun with them so they can stay alive and that was because they were at war with other countries.  Now we all live in 21st century and I am seeing people judge other with colors. All community has good and bad people weather its white, black or brown so instead  judge community by bad people try to judge by what good people did or do within the same community. In short, we all are human and as judge says, yes its nightmare to all parents loosing their children.... keep justice alive and have some humanity.... we all were passed that teen age where we all did some good and some bad... at last... stop judging people by their color or face and leave the place if you don't like to face them until you really have to deal with it.",1504828800,,901,4.389221556886228
