William Hartnell convinced to take the role and his rise to popular Icon as The Doctor and his fall due to his ill health. I am sure no one at the time would have ever dreamed over a half a century on what they were struggling to piece together  out of bits and bobs would become what it is today. Also included is the first Serial and the pilot episode that had to be reshot.

6080632,5,B00GJOXW1A,"Im a fairly recent fan of the Doctor Who series. I always knew the show existed, and as a huge science fiction fan, I shouldve been more familiar with it, but quite conversely the show lost me from the get-go with the whole idea of someone with an British accent traveling around in a spinning police call box. I was more X-Wing fighter than TARDIS in my youth. Now older, I can appreciate the imaginative magic that went into conceptualizing all of the iconic elements of what is now one of my favorite shows. Suffice it to say that when I stumbled across An Adventure in Space and Time while surfing the channel guide, I decided to take a chance and hit the record button.

If I were forced to sum up this movie with one word that word would be: Fantastic! I don't usually go for docu-dramas but this movie was flat out amazing. Actor David Bradley (Game of Thrones, The Strain) delivered an award winning performance. But it doesnt stop there. All of the performances were top-notch. This film is produced beautifully, and the direction is fantastic, especially with the opening scenes setting up the dramatic flourishes toward the end of the film. Brian Cox (Rushmore) isn't in front of the camera a lot, but he is electrifying when the spot-light is on him. The actress portraying Doctor Whos original producer Verity Graham was also absolutely terrific (I had to IMDB the actress who played her was surprised she wasn't more of a veteran). But if I had to pick a stand-out, it has to go to David Bradley. In portraying the original Doctor Who, he of course has to carry the movie and he succeeds in stellar fashion. I cant gush enough about his performance.

In summation, An Adventure in Space and Time is an absolute gem. The backstory involving the creative decisions like the conceptualizing the Daleks were very entertaining but equally interesting were the scenes involving the production problems early on and their struggles with BBC management. The real heart of the film is in how David Bradley so expertly depicts William Hartnells real personal struggles and subsequently, his declining health. This really is a wonderful film and I highly recommend it not just for DW fans, but any fan of good film. This is a must see for any DW fan.",1452902400,,2253,4.672544080604534
6080633,5,B00GJOXW1A,"Today, more than fifty years after it started, Doctor Who is a worldwide phenomenon. When it started though in 1963, no one was certain that the show would make it to the end of the year let alone run for decades. Indeed, the show faced troubles before it ever got to the screen. An Adventure In Space And Time presented viewers with a dramatization of those early years of the series ahead of the show's fiftieth anniversary in 2013. Even two years later, it remains a watchable and informative account of those early years of the show.

The script by Mark Gatiss, who has written episodes of the revived Doctor Who as well as numerous novels and audio dramas based on the series, does a superb job of condensing the events of over three years into a ninety minute production. For anyone who knows at least some of the early behind the scenes history of the series. While the running time means that the film can't give everyone their due but many of the people get their moment with references to theme tune arranger Delia Derbyshire and the series original associate producer Mervyn Pinfield. Gatiss wisely chooses to focus on a handful of people involved with the series including its original producer Verity Lambert and First Doctor actor William Hartnell. By choosing to focus the film's attention, it allows for a tight narrative that also gets to feature events such as the show's aborted first pilot, its near cancellation as well as presenting off told anecdotes about the early production of the series. While it does make sweeping generalizations at time, it remains true to events by and large to great success.

Along with Gatiss' script, a large part of the success of this production comes from the casting. David Bradley as Hartnell was a masterstroke of casting and while Bradley doesn't have his voice and might be just a tad bit taller than the real Hartnell, he captures the spirit of the man well such as in moments such as his first lunch meeting with Lambert and director Waris Hussein. Speaking of Lambert and Hussein, both are well cast with Jessica Raine (who was soon to guest star on Doctor Who itself in the episode Hide) in particular shining as Lambet who finds herself fighting tooth and claw to get her first series as a producer off the ground. Lambert finds an ally in Hussein, played by Sacha Dhawan who bares a strong resemblance to the real life director. A surprising addition to the cast is the noted actor Brian Cox who appears as Sydney Newman, the Canadian born head of BBC Drama who essentially created Doctor Who as part of a major shakeup that followed his coming to the BBC. Cox's Newman bares some resemblance to the real man though Cox doesn't seem to act much like the Newman who can glimpsed in a couple of the DVD documentaries but he certainly has a presence which benefits the production.

There's also a solid supporting cast as well. There's Lesley Manville as Hartnell's wife Heather who urges him to take the part and watches his rise to recognition before his health begins to suffer in a major supporting role which helps as well. Rounding off the original cast of the series are Jamie Glover as William Russell, Jemma Powell as Jacqueline Hill and Claudia Grant as Carole Ann Ford with a number of non-speaking actors and actresses playing the various companions from the remainder of the era. Doctor Who fans will spot a number of actors from the show's history in smaller roles such as the real life William Russell as a BBC security guard, companions actresses Anneke Wills and Jean Marsh as party guests, comedian and Doctor Who fan Toby Hadoke as a BBC bartender and modern day Dalek voice actor Nicholas Briggs playing his 1960s predecessor Peter Hawkins. While some of the casting is less than successful (such as Reece Shearsmith as Patrick Troughton who pales in comparison with Bradley's Hartnell), on the whole the cast is strong and does an admirable job of bringing their real life counterparts to life.

The other admirable aspect of the film is its production values, especially its sets and costumes. For Doctor Who fans, part of the thrill of watching the film is its recreation of the long lost but familiar sets of the show's early years including the original TARDIS console room set which is recreated in splendid detail. There's also recreations of sets, props and costumes from a number of stories from the show's early years including the first Dalek story, the lost historical adventure Marco Polo, The Web Planet with its Menoptra and the Cybermen from their debut story The Tenth Planet. Outside of the elements and sets from the series, the film does a good job recreating its 1960 settings from the Hartnell home to the offices at BBC TV Centre. The latter of which is helped in its verisimilitude by actually filming at and inside the real TV Centre, being the last in a long line of productions filmed and recorded there. The latter fact, while sad, also seems fitting given how much of a tribute it plays to the designers and people who worked there on Who and other programs.

Indeed, An Adventure In Space And Time is very much a tribute. It's a tribute to the people like Verity Lambert, William Hartnell and Sydney Newman who are among  many of the people who helped to launch what would become a worldwide phenomenon. It does so with much love and attention for detail that's clear throughout. It's also an impressive piece of docudrama that serves as an example of how to bring a sometimes complex story of real events and bring them to life on screen. What more can you ask of it?",1446940800,,5582,4.696629213483146

6080638,4,B00GJOXW1A,"This an enjoyable look at the early days of Dr Who. It is interesting to see that verity Lambert was the first female producer at the BBC and to watch the show's stuttering beginning under her guidance.

At first she seems to be the main character. her passionate defence of Dr Who reminds us that some popular culture has intelligence, integrity and meaning. However, the film changes direction and becomes the William Hartnell story. This focus has advantages and disadvantages. It emphasises his contribution to the show's success and is a poignant tale of a fine actor at last receiving the recognition and status he deserves, only to have it tragically taken away by encroaching age and ill health. The disadvantage is that other aspects of the story are missed. Lambert's decision to leave is dropped into the narrative as a given; there is no exploration of the creation of iconic elements such as Daleks and Cybermen, or the evolution of the show.

Ultimately, Whovians will enjoy this film, especially those of a vintage who remember William Hartnell as the only Doctor.",1442016000,,1079,4.923076923076923

6080641,5,B00GJOXW1A,"This film was very thought out and had great acting by people to actually looked like their early 1960's counterparts (with the exception of the Second Doctor.) A lot of it was based on the book William Hartnell's granddaughter Jessica Carney published back in 1992 called Who's There. David Bradley is brilliant as Willian Hartnell.

The extras are excellent too. They include the first Doctor Who episode and a nod to the genius herself Delia Derbyshire.",1431648000,,456,5.0
6080642,4,B00GJOXW1A,"Surprisingly good retelling of the birth of Doctor Who, the way it changed during the Hartnell years up to the (then) novel concept of regeneration.

Did Verity and Waris really have it so tough at the BBC? In this day and age, they'd have filed endless complaints with HR.

Nice to see (obscure) brief cameos by Bill Russell, Jean Marsh and Anneka Wills. Maybe casting could have done a better job with the actor playing Pat Troughton, but that was a small part. Casting for all the main roles (well, maybe not Barbara's) was excellent. David Bradley did a SUPERLATIVE job as Bill Hartnell.",1431561600,,591,4.673076923076923

Every part is so well cast and acted by those involved you start to think that your watching the real people. This was done I think for fans of Classic Who and is a real treat. I am a fan of all the Doctors classic and new not a dud in the bunch.
If you have followed Who for many years this is a treat if you watch only the new series give this a try and at least you get the idea of how it all started.",1430870400,,492,3.7864077669902914
6080645,5,B00GJOXW1A,"This is more than just a recreation of the events that created Doctor Who, probably one of the best things in sci-fi history. This is also an emotional tale, the one of William Hartnell and the character he was essential to creating. Through the story you watch as one man, after a lifetime of very similar roles, gets offered a rather strange part. At first he's wary, but then he becomes attached to the part, seeing what it means to his family and to children everywhere, as well as himself. And that makes the ending all the more sad and beautiful.

All you super-Whovians, you've got to check this out. It should be essential viewing, whether you've checked out Classic Who, New Who, or both. I tried to get my hands on it for over a year, and I'm glad I finally did, because it made me so happy and made my heart almost burst. Just shout ""Geronimo"" and pop it in. You won't regret it.",1430611200,,890,4.36144578313253

6080647,4,B00GJOXW1A,"This is the movie that every Whovian has waited for and the film that will make every academic historian cringe. But then again, how many Whovians are academic historians? Not too many. In honor of the 50th anniversary of the TV show Doctor Who, the BBC has released a made-for-TV film telling the story of the shows first three years in production. Although the movie makes for good storytelling and provides a solid basis of facts from the shows history, the manipulation of details in the narrative presents more sentimentality and modern politically correctness than the early series actually demonstrated.

This movie targets an audience who are not familiar with the more unsettling shades of Doctor Whos history. Over the years, when comparing the show to its American contemporary, Star Trek, Whovians have proudly celebrated the original series 27-season run as compared to Star Treks original 3-year run, which is sufficient as long as the content of these shows is ignored. From its 1964 premier, Star Trek boasted a racially diverse, gender-equal cast, which is something that Doctor Who did not achieve until 2007. Even today, the BBCs stubborn persistence in casting only white men as the Doctor has prompted the Internet slogan, Is Doctor Who is afraid of race? In the period that the BBCs new film discusses, many of the on-screen comments made about women would make the modern viewer squirm. Yet none of this is presented in the film. In fact, just the opposite is presented. True, the show started with a female producer/showrunner and one Indian director, but it was hardly the equality-pioneering enterprise that the film presents. The director feature in the film only directed two stories and the show has not had a female showrunner since Verity Lamberts 1965 resignation. Clearly, this BBC concoction was made in an effort to present a better past than reality.

On the other hand, Doctor Who has always messed with the past. This move binds the shows past to its present in an effort to form one cohesive whole. Beyond Matt Smiths cameo appearance at the end symbolizing the shows long, sentimental continuum, there are repeated callbacks to modern episodes written into the script. Toward the end, when the character of William Hartnel tells his wife that he does not want to quit the show, he uses the exact words, I don't want to go. Of the dozens of ways that seen could have been constructed, the chosen line just happens to be the exact last words of the Tenth Doctor before his regeneration in End of Time. Call outs like this threaten the historical integrity of the movie, but they do make for a great story, and in that respect, the movie is a success.

Even within the glamor, the basic facts, the backbone of the film, remain strong. The movie may not be perfect, but it does ensure that new Whovians will know a bit about the heart of the shows origins.",1429660800,,2892,4.826612903225806

6080682,4,B00GJOXW1A,"In reviewing AN ADVENTURE IN SPACE AND TIME, a reviewer inevitably runs the risk of incurring the wrath of the legions of Who fans who enjoyed it, especially when this reviewer has never been attracted to the program.

Having said that, I found Terry McDonough's production highly effective and affecting at the same time.  Some of the Sixties recreations are a little clichd: the sight of a Ford Anglia in the BBC studio parking lot; a red Routemaster bus passing by carrying Verity Lambert (Jessica Raine) to work: and the sight of flickering archive footage of the early soap COMPACT on a living-room television.  Brian Cox's performance as the drama producer Sydney Newman is a bit one-note; he comes across as bluff, talkative and overbearing, rather than the genius Newman actually was.

What lifts this production above the ordinary telly-bio are the central characterizations of William Hartnell (David Bradley) and Verity Lambert.  Bradley is perhaps a little too old for the role - Hartnell was only in his mid-fifties when he first essayed the part - but he communicates the actor's basic insecurities, especially when faced with the kind of role he had never played before.  Hartnell had spent many years as a reliable character-actor (notable for BRIGHTON ROCK as well as the sergeant in the very first Carry On comedy, CARRY ON SERGEANT (1958)), but was genuinely overawed by the prospect of a leading part, especially when there were so many lines to remember.  After three successful years as Dr. Who, Newman had to let him go: due to arterio-sclerosis, the actor was becoming less and less mobile, as well as suffering from a fading memory.  McDonough's production includes a heart-wrenching scene when Hsrtnell returns home and breaks down in tears as he realizes that his greatest role has come to an end, to be comforted by his daughter Heather (Lesley Manville).

Raine's Lambert comes across as a driven person, whose desire to succeed enables her to overcome all objections expressed by the staid old (male)  personnel working in the early Sixties BBC.  She brushes off the objections of Rex Tucker (Andrew Woodall) and manages to keep oleaginous  assistant Mervyn Pinfield (Jeff Rawle) quiet.  Together with director Waris Hussein (Sacha Dhawan) she forms an unbeatable partnership which ensures the success of the fledgling series.  Yet Lambert is not without her softer side; when she leaves the program, she encounters Hartnell on the studio set and tenderly kisses his cheek.

AN ADVENTURE IN SPACE AND TIME is full of surprises: Who alumni keep cropping up in small roles (William Russell as a security guard, Carole Ann Ford as a member of the public) and right at the end the eleventh doctor Matt Smith makes a cameo appearance to emphasize the series' continuity over five decades.  Writer Mark Gatiss has already suggested that he had to play fast and loose with events in order to meet the demands of the television movie format; quite simply, he has done a quite magnificent job.",1409443200,,3014,4.986027944111776

Whatever could be the commotion over a low budget, strange scenario, teckie talk scripted old geezer. Well, after some prodding by a dear fan/friend I decided to indulge the lad and give it a whirl with this fine docudrama.

I was flabbergasted by how endearing this show was to so many generations of fans, ala Star Trek in the States. This film captured so many interesting angles of production, casting, design challenges, and camaraderie on set that completely took me by surprise, completely! Turns out this program, so unique with serious entertainment and educational value, is developed by folks who put heart and soul into it's creation. Extremely impressive was the Doctor and his initial reluctance to becoming the most beloved character in BBC history and then migrating to dissolving into tears upon his last performance. So touching and very effective for the simpatico effect.

I was also impressed with the directing and multiple views of each set piece, intimate moments, wide angle shots and discriminating close-ups. Kudos to all involved in this production!

I now maintain an avid interest in this program, have watched a few previous episodes on Amazon Prime and look forward to the new season. Now that I have some background information on basic terminology and history I look forward to enjoying the series, well...forever!

6080690,5,B00GJOXW1A,"In 1963 The British Broadcasting Company gave a woman named Verity Lambert her first chance at producing a program with the green light from Sidney Newman who became the head of BBC programming.  That program would be titled ""Doctor Who"".  Not thrilled with the idea of producing a show that could in all likely hood be cancelled after the first series.  She embarks on a journey to find this ""Doctor"" who can bring him to life.
  William Hartnell was an old actor who had seen telvision work as well as film and was not looking forward to what few prospects he had left at his age.  That was until a woman named Verity Lambert gave him a call and asked to sit down with him and offer him a part in a new show called ""Doctor Who"".  William Hartnell see this as a chance to get away from playing the part of a gruff old army sargent or some kind of police office.  Instead he sees this as the chance for a trip of a life time as the engmatic old man known only as the ""Doctor"".
  Marred with production problems and not being able to film after ten p.m. somehow the show is produced and just as things seem to be finally on track the greatest single tragedy in history happens Preisdent John F. Kennedy is assianated in the United States.  Still with determination the show goes on and with creation of the Dcotor's newest foe ""Dalek"" it becomes a huge hit.
  Watch as the years go on for William Hartnell as he says goodbye to those he would call freinds on the show to other things and he reamains as the Doctor.  Witness the things Doctor Who fans never knew about what it took to create the TARDIS or the backdoor fighting Verity Lambert had to do to get this show on top as a producer, but as a woman in a postion that was held by men.  Get inside one of Britian longest running  shows early days and see how one man's performance cemented himself in television history.

This teleplay takes viewers back to the beginning, and tells the story of the first days of the show, how it came about, how it defied the critics, and how it continued when its star, the first man to play the Doctor, became incapable of continuing in the role. It also tells the behind-the-scenes story of the introduction of the Daleks, perhaps the most famous villainous race of creatures in the history of television, and how their popularity among the public helped the show win its current status as an icon of television.",1405728000,,799,4.714285714285714

The performances by all involved are top notch and special mention should be given to David Bradley who sensitively plays the tetchy and difficult, William Hartnell.
Jessica Raines is also excellent as Britain's first female drama producer, Verity Lambert. Who has to deal with creating a new television series in a very male dominated BBC of the early 1960's.

6080708,4,B00GJOXW1A,"""An Adventure in Space and Time"" was one of the highlights of Doctor Who's 50th anniversary celebrations, and it deservedly gets a very nice Blu Ray/DVD release.

I'm no technical genius, but to me the Blu Ray print is excellent. This is a very colorful production, with tons of 1960s period detail, so it's great to see it presented in crisp high-def. The special features, meanwhile, are pretty good; the highlights are a short making-of special, and a brief profile of William Hartnell featuring his original Doctor Who co-stars and his real-life granddaughter. Other features include a couple of deleted scenes and recreations of famous scenes from 1960s Who. It's a nice package overall, but none of the features is particularly long or deep, so you can blast through them all pretty quickly.

As an added bonus, you also get a DVD copy of ""An Unearthly Child,"" the first televised Doctor Who adventure. To be honest, it appears to be exactly the same DVD that was previously released in the ""Beginning"" collection, which disappointed me; I was hoping for a newly remastered copy, or a DVD with more appropriate special features than the weird comedy sketches that have always come with it. Oh well, I shouldn't really complain...it's a nice extra, obviously intended for people who don't already own the original DVD.

As for the program itself...well, Mark Gatiss is one of Doctor Who's super-fans, and he put a lot of love and effort into writing this. It's a great tribute to early Doctor Who, and the scenes of Hartnell struggling with his ill health are very poignant. That said, Gatiss does take some liberties with history and exaggerate a few things in order to enhance the drama. Also, while I like most of David Bradley's performance as William Hartnell, he really doesn't capture the charisma of Hartnell as the Doctor; indeed, the First Doctor was a much more funny, charismatic character than the stiff old man presented here.

Still, most of my complaints are minor. I love early Who, and I'm glad they made this cool tribute to it. The solid Blu Ray release is icing on the cake.",1404259200,,2100,4.825

6080714,4,B00GJOXW1A,"I've watched three or four seasons with the first two doctors of the series reboot, but found only about 1 episode in 3 held any interesting concepts. And then there's the cheesy costumes and cheap sets and strange British cinematography... which all relates to the history of the show, I guess. I couldn't get people's love for the character. This film does a great job of recreating the BBC of the early 60's, when Dr. Who was just a sketchy idea handed down to writers and producers and a young director who all had no clue what they were doing. Given virtually no budget, and a studio no bigger than a Tardis, they struggled through endless resistance from BBC higher-ups and minor production catastrophes that are comical, compared to the slick, big money industry TV is in the US. Perhaps the heart of the story is William Hartnell, the original Dr. Who; Verity Lambert, the producer who convinced him to take the role and the person most responsible for putting the show together; and Waris Hussein, the director who persevered through the initial adversities. The show's co-creator, Sydney Newman, played by one of the most talented and recognizable character actors working, Brian Cox, disagree's with the choice of Hartnell as the Doctor after watching the first episode, and gives him another chance by making them reshoot it. When the episode finally makes it to air, it has the misfortune of coinciding with the Kennedy assassination. The trials and eventual successes of the trio and their boss makes for a compelling drama, and it's even moving, at times. David Bradley (best known in the US as the hated Walder Frey, prime instigator of the Red Wedding, in HBO's 'Game of Thrones') is excellent as Hartnell, and bears a striking resemblance to the prematurely decrepit actor, who became the 1st Doctor when he was only 53, but looked as old or older than the 73 year-old Bradley who played him. His poor health and problems remembering lines would lead to Newman's decision to replace him, setting a precedent and plot twist that would open the Tardis door to multiple incarnations of the character and series.

6080718,5,B00GJOXW1A,"DOCTOR WHO is the most popular and one of the longest running shows from the BBC and since it's re-launch in 2005 is now a show followed the world over. However, DOCTOR WHO was a show that almost wasn't and AN ADVENTURE IN SPACE AND TIME is a television movie that illustrates why. The idea for DOCTOR WHO originated with Sydney Newman (Brian Cox) a Canadian who saw himself as the movie mogul of the BBC. Sydney creates the idea for the series and then picks his former assistant, Verity Lambert (Jessica Raine) to produce the show. This choice causes a huge row at the BBC because Verity is not only the youngest producer in the drama department, but the only female producer, too. She is joined in her task by the young director Waris Hussein (Sacha Dhawan). The brass is convinced that the lead in this new sci-fi, educational children's program should be played by a younger man, but Verity is convinced that Doctor Who should be played by an older actor and ends up choosing character actor William Hartnell (David Bradley) to play the part. What follows is the tumultuous journey of the show's first series and the time leading up to Hartnell's departure from the series because of health reasons. The movie clearly displays the struggles the initial episodes including the sexism at the BBC, the low budgets the show was given, and the death of American President John F. Kennedy.

The acting in AN ADVENTURE IN SPACE AND TIME is superb. Bradley is spot on as Hartnell and Raine and Dhawan give fine performances as well.

Except for the opening segment, AN ADVENTURE IN SPACE AND TIME appears to be the story of Verity Lambert and most of the first act of the film is told from her viewpoint. However, that begins to change after the casting of Hartnell and the movie clearly becomes a film about Hartnell, his time as Doctor Who, and how the role changed and influenced him. Initially, Hartnell was ambiguous about the role. However, he quickly grew into the part and it changed him allowing him a creative and artistic freedom he never experienced before as well as enriching his regular life. Had his health permitted it, he would have gone on playing the part for several more years.

Although it's clearly oriented towards fans of DOCTOR WHO, AN ADVENTURE IN SPACE AND TIME does offer something for those not familiar with the series. The movie provides a fine display of the backroom maneuvering of BBC-TV productions in the 1960s as well as showing how one man's life was clearly changed by one very prominent role.

Besides several extra features, also included with AN ADVENTURE IN SPACE AND TIME is a copy of the original DOCTOR WHO story: ""An Unearthly Child.""

I was lucky enough to see it when it aired, and now that my physical copy as arrived, I'm even more elated with what this has to offer.

The Blu-Ray edition is a 3 disc set, which has An Adventure In Space & Time as, of course, in Blu-Ray format, but it also includes this in DVD format, I supposed for those who may not yet have a Blu-Ray player, but intend to buy one soon, so they'll already have the best quality disc for that.  There is an additional disc which is An Unearthly Child on DVD.  If you already have An Unearthly Child on DVD, this is somewhat useless, since I compared it to my other, earlier released version, and found that they are exactly the same.  It would have been nice to offer this 3 disc set as a 1 or 2 disc set, and lower the price.

Since I am already on the topic of, An Unearthly Child, I will tell you that there are audio commentary tracks ONLY for episodes 1 and 4.  WHY?  There are also 4 parody sketches from the writer of AAIS&T, which are well worth watching.

In regards to the main attraction, I have to agree that is so beautifully done, it's almost unreal.  Although I have to say, my opinion on this can only be appreciated by a true Whovian.  I never go into the synopsis, since so many others do that it is redundant.  But I will tell you about the extras.

William Hartnell: The Original - Just over 5 minutes.  This shows a very rare interview with the 1st Doctor three months after he left the role.  Since there are so few of these, this is priceless.  In my humble opinion.  His granddaughter and other actors contribute to this.

The Making of an Adventure - Almost 11:30.  Self explanatory, and again, well worth watching.

Reconstructions - A 4 parter.  The first one shows, how much this docudrama really tried to recreate what happed in the early days.  If you have never seen the unaired pilot of An Unearthly Child, you may not get what they are doing here.  But said same pilot is on the 3rd disc.  The second one is a self glorification of the creator, Mark Gatiss regenerating into the 3rd doctor.  The third one is the recreated farewell speech of this 1st Doctor to Susan.  And the fourth one is a recreation of the closing scene of The Feast of Steven, which was one episode of The Dalek Materplan.  This was the first time that Doctor Who aired on Christmas day, and back then, it was thought that no one cared to watch it, so it was essentially a throw away episode.  HOW TIMES HAVE CHANGED.  The Doctor breaks the 4th wall by wishing a Merry Christmas at the end of the episode.

The Title Sequence - 1.24 - I believe this to be a promo for this special, or just a comparison of the original credits to what was done for this special as it shows the original title sequence morphing into the opening credit sequence was for this special.  Eh....

Deleted Scenes - Just a tad over 1:30 of... well, do I have to spell it out?

My only complaint is that there is no commentary track for this, which is why I titled this ""Well Worth The Wait - I hope.""  It took almost 6 months to make this available to the States, but at no point did anyone think to add a commentary track?  Considering how much went into making this, it is absolutely absurd that a commentary track was not recorded.  I swear that if this gets re-released in less than a year with this missing feature added, I'm going to be super duper psycho Dalek ticked off.  That is the only reason why I gave this 4 out or 5 stars.  I bring this up only due to the fact that the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Special, ""The Day of the Doctor,"" was announced to be RE-RELEASED later this year with additional bonus features.  The re-release date and pre-order date have not yet announced, but this announcement was just days after I received my, what will soon be, a less than complete version, if you're an extras hog like me.

MY BOTTOM LINE:  Any true Whovian would be remiss at not adding this to their collection.  And if you don't shed a tear near the end, then clearly, you are a Cyberman.",1401408000,7,4160,4.294344473007712

6080726,4,B00GJOXW1A,"In 2013, two side projects enhanced the celebration of Doctor Who's 50th anniversary. One is the 7-minute webisode, ""Night of the Doctor,"" that re-introduced Paul McGann to the mythos. The other is this remarkable biodrama, Doctor Who - An Adventure in Space & Time. While social media blew up over ""Night of the Doctor,"" I don't think An Adventure in Space Time received its just propers. This is a must-see picture for Doctor Who fans. And for those others who are too cool for school, the absorbing narrative may beckon to them as well.

It's a narrative presumed to be heavy on facts and figures, and it's so. What's unexpected is how it compels on an emotional level. The plot focuses sharply on a trio of misfits that banded together to launch Doctor Who. ""C.S. Lewis meets H.G. Wells meets Father Christmas - that's the Doctor,"" is how one character breaks down the show's peculiar protagonist. And also ""stern and scary but with a twinkle.""

Matt Gatiss wrote the thing, and he should be tremendously proud. The performances are spot-on. It's bananas how uncannily David Bradley channels William Hartnell, how closely Jessica Raine resembles Verity Lambert. Verity Lambert happens to be a trailblazer in British television. In 1963, when everyone smoked like chimney stacks, Verity Lambert was only 28 years old when she was tapped by the BBC's Head of Drama, Sydney Newman (Brian Cox), as the Beeb's first ever female producer and tasked with riding herd on this upcoming longshot of a sci-fi series. For Verity, it must've been harrowing being promptly thrown to the wolves, in dubious company with an insecure, aging actor for the series star and a young, untested Indian director. The movie doesn't shy away from documenting the obstacles these three faced. This was an era in which sexism and racial prejudice essayed no apologies, in which opinionated persons didn't scurry behind politically correct conduct. We see the contempt and dismissiveness with which Verity - that ""pushy Jewish bird"" - is treated. We see the Indian director, Waris Hussein (Sacha Dhawan), repeatedly fail to get the bartender's attention.

If I had my druthers, the film would've tracked more of Verity's and Waris's respective personal lives. Instead it fixates only on William Hartnell's. Maybe it's appropriate. Out of the three, Hartnell is the one who most requires the humanizing touch. The teleplay probes beneath the man's cantakerous surface to reveal his frailties and insecurities. David Bradley, whose part is so contemptible in Game of Thrones, shows us a warmer, more vulnerable side to William Hartnell. In the end, it's Hartnell's arc that gives the narrative its beating heart.

I'll take the word of those I know who were around in the '60s and who professed themselves impressed with the execution of the film, with how it captures the zeitgeist of that period, with how the sets and props and costumes all came together. Those steeped in Doctor Who lore can pick out this and that Easter egg (there is a bunch). One historical event locks down the time frame. Doctor Who was already an underdog series when the JFK assassination snatched away the headlines, commandeered Doctor Who's air time during its debut broadcast. We note Ms. Lambert's fight to keep the creepy Daleks in the show (despite complaints from the suits that they were ""cheapjack science-fiction drek""). Bradley provides the poignancy, but Jessica Raine as Verity Lambert is as equally accomplished, just as pivotal. More than anyone else, Lambert put herself on the line, fought for the show, tooth and nail, and she did this time and again. Thanks to her and to Hartnell and Hussein and, okay, to the Beeb's Head of Drama, Sydney Newman, there may be a future after all for a show about an alien gent what explores time and space in a blue police box. This movie is so good that, in a way, that it's about the genesis of Doctor Who becomes almost incidental to me. I was caught up in the struggles of the people behind the scene, with how hard they fought against the old guard and how they upended pre-conceptions and how, ultimately, they walked away and left their show to carry on. Pop culture's not been the same since.",1397174400,8,4205,4.893408134642356
6080727,5,B00GJOXW1A,"After the first time surprises of Day of the Doctor, you're left with a perfectly exciting story, but not necessarily one that stands the test of time.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but the highlight of the 50th Anniversary year was this docudrama.  I've been heavily involved in the Doctor Who fandom for years, and I was following the production of this since back in early 2012 when a want ad for the job of assistant producer (with a helpful knowledge of 1960s television history and Doctor Who) went up on the BBC website, and those of us who were already thinking ahead to the 50th started wondering if this meant a docudrama about the show's origins was a possibility. It literally was that fast, although plenty of us were aware that Mark Gatiss had been trying to get this story made for years beforehand.

Eventually, this was confirmed, and we all waited with bated breath because Gatiss isn't known for writing great Doctor Who on the show itself, but the early reviews were fantastic, and the early pictures of the TARDIS sets seemed to be spot-on accurate to those of us who spent too much time memorizing early TARDIS consoles.  Fun fact: some of the antique components found in the recreated TARDIS were actually from William Hartnell's original TARDIS.  Talk about period detail!

It's no secret that many people, including me, were disappointed with the split Series 7, and the poor quality of episodes during the celebratory 50th year, not to mention the overall secrecy of what was planned.  Leading up to this, it seemed like the 50th itself was bound to disappoint.  And then An Adventure in Space and Time aired.  And not only was it a faithful rendering of the early 1960s at the BBC, with the hardships faced by the show's producers (none of whom fit the typical description of a BBC producer at the time), it was a heartrending depiction of the devotion to the program shown by William Hartnell, and above all else, a love letter to the show that we all love so much.  Mark Gatiss may be on the writing staff, but this had the feeling of being made by a fan, for the fans, because nothing has ever shown the sheer love of Doctor Who the way this docudrama did.  It works as a period drama, as a quality piece of TV, and as a wonderful addition to the annals of Doctor Who itself.

Let's just say that by the end I was in absolute floods.  I actually haven't made it through yet without choking up, and fifty years from now, I probably will still be in tears as I watch it.  Just absolutely beautiful.

I don't know why it took them so long to release the DVD copy in the US, but now that it's here, get it, it is absolutely worth it.  And in fifty years, I'm looking forward to the docudrama about how they brought the show back in 2005.",1397174400,4,2768,4.462301587301587
6080728,2,B00GJOXW1A,"I want to make it clear that the docu-drama itself is a masterpiece of the genre and if I were rating this product on the content of the primary film alone it would get a full 5 stars. The extras which are listed in some of the other reviews are valuable as well.
My beef with this edition is first, I don't want or need a Blu-ray - I don't intend to switch anytime soon and, besides, it makes no difference to the quality of the classic episodes which were shot long before HD; second, I don't need another copy of ""An Unearthly Child"" or the original pilot as I already own them from a different DVD boxed set. I understand why they included it but many of us collecting the series probably bought the ""Beginnings"" boxed set. For my money, this set simply has more than I want to spend money on.
Having made my complaints, I want to add that for the new collector of Whoviana, this film is a must-have and ""An Unearthly Child"" is a nice companion piece so the curious can see why the show might have died if not for preemption by the JFK assassination. Actually, truth be told, it would probably have been a good idea to include the entire ""Beginnings"" collection which included ""The Daleks"" (which saved the show) and ""The Edge of Destruction"" (which is more like an episode of ""The Twilight Zone"" than a ""Doctor Who"". Together these would compliment ""An Adventure In Space And Time"". Other episodes depicted in the docu-drama and are available include ""The Reign of Terror"", ""The Aztecs"", ""The Web Planet"" and William Hartnell's last episode ""The Tenth Planet"" which has just been released this year on DVD.",1395619200,14,1611,4.52054794520548
6080729,4,B00GJOXW1A,"This docu-drama, released as part of the 50th Anniversary of Doctor Who last November, presented the origins of the series through the eyes of producer Verity Lambert and actor William Hartnell. Both characters are brilliantly played by Jessica Raine and David Bradley respectively. Bradley, in particular, acts with charm and grace to bring us an interpretation of a man whose life is more a series of anecdotes than actual history. While many people associated with DW's start are either still alive or are well-documented in interviews and archive footage, very little exists regarding Hartnell, and that left Bradley with a lot of research to do with few resources. He lives up to the challenge, though, portraying Hartnell as tough but kindly, a gruff man with a heart of gold and a fierce loyalty to the show. He becomes an endearing character whose immanent departure from the series will tug at your heart-strings. The best part of his performance is how he portrays Hartnell's embrace of change at the beginning and slowly eschews it over time. The concept of life-changes plays such a major part in this film and is wonderfully embodied by Bradley in the character of Hartnell, especially in his final scene playing the Doctor.

The movie is a lovely mixture of humor and drama, just what you would want from a tv dramatization of real life. Whether it will hold much appeal for non-DW fans, I cannot say, though it is a strong enough piece to be admired just for its construction. DW fans, however, should find much to intrigue them and perhaps they will learn a thing or two they didn't already know about the series. The story very closely resembles the facts about the creation of the series, as reflected in the commentary, text-track, and documentaries associated with ""An Unearthly Child."" After watching this movie when it aired last November, I read up as much as I could about the origin of the series and found that this film was surprisingly accurate in its portrayal of just about everything (though some events are conflated in order to keep the narrative moving).

I am glad this film is getting a release in America. I did not wait and bought a R2 copy from Britain. According to release details, the American release has all the same special features as the British version. Regarding those, this is where I removed a star. While the making-of featurette and the small discussion about Hartnell are fine viewing, they were far too short for my taste and left me feeling unsatisfied. The reconstructions of original episodes involve about 1 minute of actual reconstructions, most of which can be found in the film itself. The only truly unique reconstruction is the Doctor's breaking of the 4th wall during the Christmas special ""The Feast of Steven.""

The American release of this movie makes up a bit for the lack of special features by adding ""An Unearthly Child"" as a bonus disc. Judging by the fact that the entire ""10,000 BC"" serial is included, plus the unaired pilot, this is most likely the same as the release found in the ""Beginnings"" box set. If so, the special features are excellent and will only add to your appreciation of ""An Adventure in Space and Time.""

Overall, I highly recommend this to anyone who is interested in the origins of the Doctor Who televsion show. I would also recommend it for anyone who appreciates a well-developed docu-drama.",1395619200,56,3391,4.841379310344828
6080730,5,B00GJOXW1A,"1966 England, an elderly man is driving alone on a foggy night. It's a country road, a bare grassy plot on the left, a perimeter of trees barely showing through the haze. And ahead, a small blue box with a light showing through its window.  He stops the car and stares. It's a police box, a blue police box. A policeman exits the box and walks towards the stopped car. But the driver doesn't notice him.  He's lost in his memories. Memories starting only three years before.

That would have been 1963, and we're taken back, too.  Sydney Newman reigns as BBC's Head of Drama, brash, confident, waving his cigar like a baton.  They need a new show to fill a 25 minute time slot. Syd settles on science fiction. It's IN. It's BIG. Valentina Tereshkova has just orbited the Earth and the space race is in full swing.

Syd shocks the untested Verity Lambert by offering her the producer's slot. He selects a director, Waris Hussein, who equally has something to prove. And he recommends an actor for the protagonist, the irascible William Hartnell.

Verity and Waris take Hartnell for a drink to sell him on the show. Verity assures the prickly actor that Doctor Who is ""C.S. Lewis meets H.G. Wells meets Father Christmas. That's the Doctor.""

Hartnell replies:  ""Doctor who?""

You saw that coming!
And the rest is history.

This is an excellent special. David Bradley is superb as William Hartnell. There is comedy, there is tension. One of my favorite TV shows was THAT close to never happening.

If you check out the entry for this special on tardis.wikia.com, you'll see a great run-down of differences between the script and real life. For example, in the special, it's implied that Hartnell's inability to get companion Ian Chesterson's name correct is due to his failing health. Actually, it was scripted that way as a comic touch.

There are many insider touches in this show. Did you notice that Harry, the security guard, is played by William Russell, who played, of course, the original companion Ian Chesterson?  Watch Verity's party sequence and you'll see Anneke Wills (played companion Polly) and Jean Marsh in uncredited cameos. Toby Hadoke, who I think has done a great job moderating commentaries on classic Dr Who DVD releases, has a part as Cyril. Carol Ann Ford (played the Doctor's granddaughter, Susan = the original Unearthly Child) has a part as Joyce.

The BluRay/DVD set has 3 discs, with 1 Blu Ray and 2 DVD discs. I think it's great. This is how I have been purchasing new and re-issued Disney movies, for example. The idea is that you can pop the DVD in the computer while traveling with the kids (of any age).

Note: There is going to be a big ""Doctor Who 50th Anniversary Collection"" issued on BluRay/DVD sometime late 2014, and ""An Adventure in Space and Time"" will probably be included in that set.

The film's original broadcast in England was immediately followed by a rebroadcast of William Hartnell in the original 4-episode ""An Unearthly Child"" (1963). This 1st series is already available on DVD in the 3-episode set, ""Doctor Who: The Beginning"" as well as the older ""Lost in Time Collection of Rare Episodes - The William Hartnell Years and the Patrick Troughton Years"" (2004). I think it's neat to watch the special followed by the real show.

The 2013 TV special ""An Adventure in Space and Time"" is 85 minutes without commercials. English subtitles are available on the BluRay and DVDs. Here is what you'll get on the discs, and there's a LOT of extras:

DISC 1:  Blu Ray
1.  ""An Adventure in Space and Time"" (85 minutes) Presented in 1080p with DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround sound.
2.  ""William Hartnell: The Original"" (5 minutes, TV special 2013) Commentators include Jessica Carney (Hartnell's granddaughter), Mark Eden (plays Marco Polo in the original ""Marco Polo"" (1964) series), Waris Hussein (the 1st Dr Who director), William Russell (plays companion Ian Chesterson), Peter Purves (plays companion Steven Taylor), Terrence Dicks (script editor ""The Three Doctors"" with a Hartnell cameo), David Bradley (plays William Hartnell), Mark Gatiss (writer & executive producer), Carole Ann Ford (plays Susan, the 1st Doctor's granddaughter), Peter Davison (plays the 5th Doctor) and Matt Smith (plays the 11th Doctor and has a wonderful cameo in this TV special).
Hussein doesn't mention the discrimination he had to fight in the day, but instead says: ""I feel more like a dad than a director about this, ... because I was at the birth of this show, and it makes me very proud.""
3.  ""The Making of 'An Adventure in Space and Time'"" (10 minutes) This is narrated by Carol Ann Ford with commentators Mark Gatiss, Brian Cox (plays Sydney Newman), Jessica Raine (plays Verity Lambert), David Bradley, William Russell, Sacha Dhawan (plays Waris Hussein), Waris Hussein, Claudia Grant (plays Carole Ann Ford), James Glover (plays William Russell) and Jemma Powell (plays Jacqueline Hill).
Gatiss says, ""I still can't quite believe it, because I first sort of pitched this story about thirteen years ago. And then I tried very strongly to get it made for the 40th anniversary."" The 50th is better than never!
4.  ""Reconstruction: Four Sequences"" These show how careful the producers of ""An Adventure in Space and Time"" tried to be in recreating true life. The sequences shown here are basically unedited versions of scenes that do appear in the special:
...A. Scenes From An Unearthly Child: Pilot and Episode 4. These B&W reconstructions include the blooper where the TARDIS door accidentally opens and you can see the hunched-over tech closing them again from the other side.
...B. Regeneration. Bradley turns into Reece Shearsmith (playing Patrick Troughton) who turns into Mark Gatiss (playing Jon Pertwee in a hilarious wig).
...C. Farewell to Susan. A recreation of the Doctor's speech at the end of ""The Dalek Invasion of Earth"" (1964). Susan leaves the show, poignantly, and her Grandfather tells her goodbye.
[Trivia: At different times in her life, Susan is known as ""Susan Foreman"", ""Susan English"" and ""Susan Campbell"". All of these names are aliases, as her Gallifreyan birth name is Arkytior.]
...D. Festive Greeting. It was common for characters in popular TV shows to make short holiday greetings to the audience during the Christmas season. This is a recreation of Hartnell's greeting during the series ""The Dalek's Master Plan"" (1965).
5.  ""Title Sequences""
6.  ""Deleted Scenes"" There are two: an extended version of a scene at The Radiophonic Workshop, where Celia Derbyshire demonstrates the newly created Doctor Who theme music, and the appearance of a Monoid (from the series ""The Ark"") at Verity's farewell party.

DISC 2:  DVD
Items # 1 & 2 can most recently be found on the 3-series DVD set ""Doctor Who: The Beginning"" (2006).
1.  ""An Unearthly Child"" (100 minutes, 1963) This the original broadcast version of the very first Doctor Who series, in 4 episodes. You'll see two hallmarks of Dr Who in this very first series. 1) The TARDIS sometimes goes where she wants to go instead of where the Doctor wants to go. 2) On landing in a strange landscape, the Doctor exits the TARDIS and mutters, ""It's still a police box! Why hasn't it changed? Dear dear, how very disturbing.""
2.  ""An Unearthly Child Pilot"" (40 minutes, 1963) This rough version was shot a month before the ""real"" episode, and was the pilot used to convince the powers that be to go with this new TV show. It is unedited, with outtakes.
3.  Theme Music Videos. These are B&W 2-minute extended remixes of the Title Sequence. Three versions: Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound, Dolby Digital 2.0, and Mono.
4.  Comedy Sketches (18 minutes total):
...A. ""The Pitch of Fear"" Sydney Newman (David Williams) pitches a new science fiction show to Mr. Borusa (Mark Gatiss). This is funny with all kinds of inside references. Watch it twice to make sure you catch them all.
...B. ""The Corridor Sketch"" This B&W sketch dates from 1996. A reporter is in the corridor outside of Studio D, trying to get interviews from the participants of the first rehearsal of a new show, ""Doc' True"", episode ""An Unearthly Chill"". Lots of confusion, including the fellow who thinks the show will resemble ""Dr. Kildare"". At the end, the reporter wonders, ""But what of the future for this new series? I have with me the director general of the BBC. So, Horace, how long do you think this new series will last?""
Played by an elegant Nicholas Courtney, the director says, ""About 26 years, 1 week and 6 days.""
...C. ""The Web of Caves"" B&W mini-episode. The Doctor (played by Mark Gatiss in another wig) lands on a planet with a mildly confused alien menace. ""He's rather nice, isn't he?""
...D. ""The Kidnappers"" The teenaged Mark (Gatiss, of course!) is woken by his best friend bringing him a present. It's Peter Davison, who plays the 5th Doctor, with his hands bound and mouth taped. The two fans, no not fans, but ""enthusiasts"", are dying to ask him questions.
5.  Photo Gallery. These are B&W production and rehearsal stills of the real show and behind the scene and publicity shots of the real actors. Also a few color photographs of the commentary recording for this BluRay/DVD issue.
6.  Audio Options. You can listen to a Commentary track on the 40 minute pilot (unaired) of Episode 1, as well as on Episodes 1 and 4 of the originally aired ""An Unearthly Child"".
PILOT Episode 1: Moderated by Gary Russell, commentators are Verity Lambert and Waris Hussein. Lambert explains why they were given the luxury of shooting episode 1 twice: ""Dr Who was envisioned to last at least a year, which was incredibly unusual.""
Of course, as Russell notes, the first episode 1 was ""not really a pilot, because we didn't do pilots in England in the 1960's.""
Check out the differences between the pilot and the aired versions. Lambert says that the biggest changes were made to increase the pace. They also toned down the Doctor, as he was very ""austere and unpleasant"" in the pilot. (He remained pretty sinister in the aired version!) When the teachers get into the TARDIS, Susan is wearing a metallic-like tunic to look space-agey. They changed her into a simple top to make her seem more like a regular teenager.
AIRED SERIES, Episode 1: Moderated Gary Russell, commentators are Verity Lambert, Carole Ann Ford and William Russell. Russell comments on the team of Sydney Newman and Verity Lambert: ""The man [Newman] represented a new type of character coming in television.... The BBC television department, in a sense, reminded me of school. There was something about it that was like that. They were very nice people. Probably very talented people. But they were extremely cautious. I enjoyed this breath of Canadian fresh air [represented by Newman and Lambert].""
AIRED SERIES, Episode 4: Gary Russell moderates, with commentators Carole Ann Ford, William Russell and Waris Hussein. This first education series for kids, was meant to take them back to before ""civilization"", what it would have been like. The savage fight to the death between the two primitives was meant to be realistic. Waris comments: ""I wanted to put a sound effect of a crunched skull. We actually had one, by bringing down something hard onto a cabbage. Verity Lambert said to me, 'you cannot use that sound.'... We had a big argument in the control room.""
7.  Information Text. Always great tidbits of information, such as that blue police boxes were used in England from 1929 into the 70's, when radios took over.
The paleolithic (or palaeolithic, in British spelling) tribe was supposed to have one more female. The pretty woman hired for the part, however, was a model who thought she'd be modeling fur coats. She refused to remove her false eyelashes and left in a huff right before filming started when the make-up artists tried to blacken her teeth.

DISC 3: DVD
1.  ""An Adventure in Space and Time"" (85 minutes)
... And the same 5 bonus features shown above on the BluRay disc.

6080731,3,B00GJOXW1A,"When I heard about this film, I was very excited - mainly because it helps further legitimize a fantastic television series which was a real landmark in broadcasting history. The film itself is wonderful and After seeing it twice on BBC America, I was eager to add it to my DVD collection.
If you watch many of the extras which come with the published DVDs before seeing this film, you will be struck by just how well they were able to portray 1963 London in the modern era. Factually, this film may stumble here and there, but it was meant more as a drama to immortalize the birth of a television icon (Doctor Who) as well as to show that most of the rules and alien menaces (Daleks, Cybermen, the Doctor as a fugitive from Gallifrey and the regeneration process) were with the series from its very earliest incarnation. The fact that what saved the show was preemption of the story ""4,000,000 years BC"" for coverage of the JFK assassination followed by the story ""The Daleks"" the next week proves that both the series and the Daleks, young and low budget as they were, have had a lasting effect. And the portrayal of William Hartnell, the first Doctor (the actor's name escapes me for the moment, but he's brilliant) was spot on.
The only reason I give this product 3 stars instead of a full 5 is that it is not available in Region 1 (US/Canada) DVD format and there is no information when or if this will happen.",1394841600,,1415,4.467181467181467
6080732,5,B00GJOXW1A,"I don't know why Amazon is prompting me to review a product that I have not yet received, but I'll humor them.
Obviously, I can't say anything about the quality of the disc.
The product announcement listed exciting extras, which was a major reason I per-ordered it.
The DVD copy of the program is a complete waste of money. If I order a Blu-Ray disc, why would I want a duplicate in an inferior format? I always sell these.
As for the program itself, I watched it on TV when it was broadcast and enjoyed it for its nostalgia and dramatic value. I'm slightly too young to remember that period, but it seemed like a simpler time. Plus anything about Dr. Who is something I appreciate. I especially enjoyed the fact that a young woman and an Arabic man were in charge of the first broadcasts.

6080735,1,B00GJOXW1A,"Or, to put it another way, what good is a movie that no one can see?

I assume the creators of this movie loved their project. They spent the time, money, and effort to make it.

You'd think they, at least, would want their movie to be seen.

I know I'd love to see it.

So where is it?

Was this movie made, shown once, and then intentionally buried? Was it awful, a terrible film? If not, why isn't it available anywhere, especially in the U.S., a tremendous market for such a release?",1391731200,3,487,4.193548387096774
6080736,5,B00GJOXW1A,"Most reviews have noted, quite correctly, the outrageous price of the DVD in the US. I had intended to hold off for a Blu-Ray release but that doesn't appear to on the horizon. Both of these are inexplicable. I wound up buying mine for about $20 on Amazon UK.
All that aside, the film is a remarkable document of the trials and tribulations of an actor, hamstrung by tough man roles and illness, and a first-time producer who was obliged to fly by wire and sort things as they happened, and the glory they both found together.
Attention to detail is key when you make a period piece so I can't see how William Hartnell can sit home grumbling about being a legitimate character actor, watching an old Army Game, with a D reg car in the driveway. In 1963, it was an A reg.
Minor quibble because the rest, it soon becomes very apparent, is a labour of love. Mark Gatiss' script neatly compresses three years into 90 minutes of very intelligent film. Everyone involved works hard at this and it shows and kudos to the Beeb for pulling it off. It is an affectionate recounting of a well-known story and it seems to have the feel of a reminiscence. It has a sort of soft glow about it, as though you are lifting up the veil of years and simply remembering...
David Bradley's performance is exceptional and captures not just the cantankerous, crotchety old buffer but the softer, gentler side of Bill Hartnell. It is quite apparent how much love he had for the show and it could not have been a decision lightly made to let him go.
I now look at his performances in early Doctor Who in a completely new light. His was the first Doctor I remember and his will always be the best.
Buy this from Amazon UK. Go forward in your beliefs and prove to me I am not mistaken in mine...",1391558400,,1768,4.36060606060606
6080737,4,B00GJOXW1A,"In 2013, two side projects enhanced the celebration of Doctor Who's 50th anniversary. One is the 7-minute webisode, ""Night of the Doctor,"" that re-introduced Paul McGann to the mythos. The other is this remarkable biodrama, Doctor Who - An Adventure in Space & Time. While social media blew up over ""Night of the Doctor,"" I don't think An Adventure in Space Time received its just propers. This is a must-see picture for Doctor Who fans. And for those others who are too cool for school, the absorbing narrative may beckon to them as well.

It's a narrative presumed to be heavy on facts and figures, and it's so. What's unexpected is how it compels on an emotional level. The plot focuses sharply on a trio of misfits that banded together to launch Doctor Who. ""C.S. Lewis meets H.G. Wells meets Father Christmas - that's the Doctor,"" is how one character breaks down the show's peculiar protagonist. And also ""stern and scary but with a twinkle.""

Matt Gatiss wrote the thing, and he should be tremendously proud. The performances are spot-on. It's bananas how uncannily David Bradley channels William Hartnell, how closely Jessica Raine resembles Verity Lambert. Verity Lambert happens to be a trailblazer in British television. In 1963, when everyone smoked like chimney stacks, Verity Lambert was only 28 years old when she was tapped by the BBC's Head of Drama, Sydney Newman (Brian Cox), as the Beeb's first ever female producer and tasked with riding herd on this upcoming longshot of a sci-fi series. For Verity, it must've been harrowing being promptly thrown to the wolves, in dubious company with an insecure, aging actor for the series star and a young, untested Indian director. The movie doesn't shy away from documenting the obstacles these three faced. This was an era in which sexism and racial prejudice essayed no apologies, in which opinionated persons didn't scurry behind politically correct conduct. We see the contempt and dismissiveness with which Verity - that ""pushy Jewish bird"" - is treated. We see the Indian director, Waris Hussein (Sacha Dhawan), repeatedly fail to get the bartender's attention.

If I had my druthers, the film would've tracked more of Verity's and Waris's respective personal lives. Instead it fixates only on William Hartnell's. Maybe it's appropriate. Out of the three, Hartnell is the one who most requires the humanizing touch. The teleplay probes beneath the man's cantakerous surface to reveal his frailties and insecurities. David Bradley, whose part is so contemptible in Game of Thrones, shows us a warmer, more vulnerable side to William Hartnell. In the end, it's Hartnell's arc that gives the narrative its beating heart.

I'll take the word of those I know who were around in the '60s and who professed themselves impressed with the execution of the film, with how it captures the zeitgeist of that period, with how the sets and props and costumes all came together. Those steeped in Doctor Who lore can pick out this and that Easter egg (there is a bunch). One historical event locks down the time frame. Doctor Who was already an underdog series when the JFK assassination snatched away the headlines, commandeered Doctor Who's air time during its debut broadcast. We note Ms. Lambert's fight to keep the creepy Daleks in the show (despite complaints from the suits that they were ""cheapjack science-fiction drek""). Bradley provides the poignancy, but Jessica Raine as Verity Lambert is as equally accomplished, just as pivotal. More than anyone else, Lambert put herself on the line, fought for the show, tooth and nail, and she did this time and again. Thanks to her and to Hartnell and Hussein and, okay, to the Beeb's Head of Drama, Sydney Newman, there may be a future after all for a show about an alien gent what explores time and space in a blue police box. This movie is so good that, in a way, that it's about the genesis of Doctor Who becomes almost incidental to me. I was caught up in the struggles of the people behind the scene, with how hard they fought against the old guard and how they upended pre-conceptions and how, ultimately, they walked away and left their show to carry on. Pop culture's not been the same since.",1390867200,,4205,4.893408134642356
6080738,5,B00GJOXW1A,"An Adventure In Time & Space is a magnificent document about the birth of one of my favourite TV shows that I grew up with and have been watching for 40 years. What has been produced is a very well made, clever and at times very emotional story of how it all happened back in the early 1960s.
They have made a film that I enjoyed immensely and found the portrayal of the original actors as very accurate.
This film really is a beautiful tribute to William Hartnell and portrays him in a very respectful way as he deserves.
I found this film very emotional, and a few tears did flow as the story unfolded. The great love he (William) and his fans had for Doctor Who is very apparent in the film. A must get for any Doctor Who fans and fans of the history of TV from the BBC.",1390608000,,773,4.125827814569536
6080739,5,B00GJOXW1A,"I've only been watching Doctor Who for 6 months, but when I get into something, I get into it. This is a fantastic story, with wonderful performances from all the actors involved. I can't stress how well the actors did. You really feel for William Hartnell and what he did, how much of himself he put into a fledgling show that would become something huge. And of course, Verity Newman, making her way in a place that up until then, had been an ""Man's"" world, as well as Waris Hussein, who had to fight in his own way to gain the respect of his peers. And of course, the very poignant ending that tied things up. I highly suggest watching it. (Although, not for the price Amazon wants for it. Find it another way until a reasonable price comes along.)",1390521600,,751,4.371428571428571

6080741,5,B00GJOXW1A,"So where's the North American Blu-ray release of An Adventure in Space And Time. It's a great program especially if you are a longtime fan of Doctor Who or and especially the 1st Doctor era this is a muse have.
But I completely agree that the price is out of this world especially for a DVD release, even for Blu-ray which I am hoping for a release of it really shouldn't be any more than $30.00 American on Blu-ray at the extreme and about $19.99 on DVD.
So where's the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack? In all complete honesty I personally think this movie should have been included as a bonus disc with The Day of the Doctor or at least as a 'companion' piece all pun intended.",1389484800,5,670,4.325396825396825
6080742,5,B00GJOXW1A,"Im a very recent fan of the Doctor Who series.  I always knew the show existed, and as a huge science fiction fan, I shouldve been more familiar with it, but quite conversely the show lost me from the get-go with the whole idea of someone with an English accent traveling around in a spinning police call box.  I was more X-Wing fighter than TARDIS in my youth.  Now older, I can appreciate the imaginative magic that went into conceptualizing all of the iconic elements of what is now one of my favorite shows.  Suffice it to say that when I stumbled across An Adventure in Space and Time while surfing the channel guide, I decided to take a chance and hit record.

If I were forced to sum up this movie with one word that word would be:  Fantastic!  I don't usually go for docu-dramas but this movie was flat out amazing.  Actor David Bradley (Game of Thrones) delivered an award winning performance.  But it doesnt stop there.  All of the performances were top-notch.  This film is produced beautifully, and the direction is fantastic, especially with the opening scenes setting up the dramatic flourishes toward the end of the film.  Brian Cox (Rushmore) isn't in front of the camera a lot, but he is electrifying when the spot-light is on him.  The actress portraying Doctor Whos original producer Verity Graham was also absolutely terrific (I had to IMDB the actress who played her was surprised she wasn't more of a veteran).  But if I had to pick a stand-out, it has to go to David Bradley.  In portraying the original Doctor Who, he of course has to carry the movie and he succeeds in stellar fashion.  I cant gush enough about his performance.

In summation, An Adventure in Space and Time is an absolute gem.  The backstory involving the creative decisions like the conceptualizing the Daleks were very entertaining but equally interesting were the scenes involving the production problems early on and their struggles with management.  The real heart of the film is in how David Bradley so expertly depicts William Hartnells real personal struggles and subsequently, his declining health.  This really is a wonderful film and I highly recommend it not just for DW fans, but any fan of good film.  Its a shame with the pricing of the DVD being what it ishopefully itll come down but the rating of the movie shouldn't suffer because of the price.  This is a must see for any DW fan.",1388448000,7,2392,4.645238095238096

8623867,5,B00GJOXW1A,"""An Adventure in Space and Time"", written by Mark Gatiss tells of the making of the long-running BBC series ""Doctor Who"". This film was part of the 50th anniversary celebration for the franchise in 2013. In the film, David Bradley plays William Harntell (the First Doctor, a role Bradley himself would play in the the 2017 ""Doctor Who"" episodes ""The Doctor Falls"" and ""Twice Upon a Time""), Brian Cox plays Sydney Newman (the creator of ""Doctor Who""), Jessica Raine plays Verity Lambert (the original producer), and Sacha Dhawan plays Waris Hussein (original director). The story necessarily condenses certain events and focuses on certain people at the exception of others, but it admits to the sexism and racism that characterized television studios in the early 1960s and how business interests determined a great deal of the plot. As the lead, Bradley also delivers a phenomenal performance that can make you laugh or cry. There's even a nice nod to the producers' and fans' faith that the franchise will go on no matter what.
This multi-disc set includes the pilot story, ""An Unearthly Child"", as a bonus feature.",1515974400,,1117,5.010752688172043

It tells the story of how the show first started, and has a DVD of the original ""Unearthly Child"".  this will now be the precursor to my Dr Who collection and will watch it before I rewatch the classics again.  The cast do a fantastic job to show how the show came together, they give a quick overview of some of the issues, and how it sort of worked out.  To be fair, they are condensing months of story into under 2 hrs, so naturally they can't get into every detail. This could very well have been made into a miniseries just to cover the story.  It's also a good story for young women - Verity Lambert was given a chance as a Producer in 1935, which was unheard of to have a female television Producer.  And yet, thanks to her, this classic series came to fruition. She faced a lot of opposition yet she trusted her instinct and forged ahead proving the nay-sayers wrong.",1515110400,,925,4.257142857142857
