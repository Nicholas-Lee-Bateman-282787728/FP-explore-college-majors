People are being hit or kicked in the face, and being flug through parking lots.  Black women are taking their shoes off to smack one another crazy with, or pulling out each other's weaves.  When a fight breaks out in a neighborhood every nearest person and then some flock like ants to watch, in 40 seconds or less.  You will be truly amazed when watching this.  In some places a street fight is the highlight of the day.
Well worth to watch.",1084233600,2,588,4.4392523364485985
7977609,5,B00007K08S,"Yes, this DVD is one big stereotype, but that is the beauty of it.  It was shot by amateur photographers who managed to capture crazy ghetto fights, black people stabbing black people, drinkin' forties, smokin's blunts, getting arrested, causin' riots, and [stuff].  The flick is a roller coaster.  Some scenes involve heated arguments with the cops, while in another segment a man is killed with a shovel.  Perhaps my favorite parts are the cat fights (I think there were about 15), those broad go at it.  All in all great tape, but thank god for the suburbs.",1049155200,4,560,4.731958762886598
