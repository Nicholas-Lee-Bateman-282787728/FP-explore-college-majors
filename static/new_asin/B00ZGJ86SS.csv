I have been praying for 38 years for one family member, and lately have been dealing with heart-breaking circumstances, including the diagnosis of my daughter with leukemia.  I have known the Lord since I was 9 years old and have loved Him since then.  I am now in my 50s and facing crisis after crisis, currently on my own.  This music, David's voice, his obvious love for the Lord and His people, has served to refocus me and bring me much comfort.  He has chosen a wide selection of music that just seem so perfect together.  David's ""realness""  comes across loud and clear.  Having his children participate in the music was so wonderful to see.  David speaks of the song and words,"" I surrender all.""  I have done that with his encouragement.  I surrender all of my expectations, disappointments, my daughter fighting leukemia, the unexpected loss of my beloved father, even the frustration and deep hurt of having a husband (who claims to know the Lord, but has been abusive)....all of it, I surrender all to Jesus.  It's not a Pollyanna kind of surrender, but I recognize that
while I may not see my answers to prayer this side of Heaven, I know that He loves me and will guide me through these challenges in my life.  David's music helped me and comforted me at just the right time.  It will for you too.",1501459200,,1484,4.585551330798479

This DVD shows a wide range of music styles and he does every genre with such passion, that I can't help but be thrilled!",1500076800,,287,4.218181818181818
