7992096,3,B00009OWDR,I purchased this as a gift.  It looked like an amature copy without a cover.  I will not purchase anything else without a picture.,1362960000,,130,4.375
7992097,2,B00009OWDR,"I bought the DVD and was disappointed to find that the DVD is a copy from video tape and not of very good audio or video quality. My VHS copy is actually better than the source material used for this DVD.
The DVD is of suspect origin and not issued by the BBC or another professional film production company.  Having stated this, it's a nice addition to the collection of a Mathis fan because the video is very hard to find!",1324425600,,424,4.234567901234568
7992098,5,B00009OWDR,Anything Johnny Mathis is perfect and goes into my collection in my Johnny Mathis room; soon I have to move out and let the memoribilia take over.,1296691200,4,146,4.444444444444445
7992099,3,B00009OWDR,"Although there were a lot of areas in the dvd where the quality  could have been clearer and better, this was not too bad. For Johnny Mathis fans, it is enjoyable to see him perform, however, becaue of the quality I do think that the price could have been less.",1290038400,3,261,4.22
7992100,2,B00009OWDR,"I ordered this video because of the release date of December, 2002.  Little did I realize this is a video from 1963!  And that's where the disappointment comes from.  The dancers and Johnny were really from the 60's!!  Johnny's singing is wonderful as usual, but not from 2002!!",1059609600,8,278,4.729166666666667
