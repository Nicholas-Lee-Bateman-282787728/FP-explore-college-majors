2070144,3,B00029NLBY,"I had never seen Bob the Builder, but it seemed popular so I bought this for our son. I think the episodes are a little corny. Maybe other dvds are different but this one really doesn't concentrate on any construction. The first episode Bob is taking dance lessons and another he ends up delivering pizzas. I thought because he was Bob the BUILDER he would mostly be building things. Not sure we will be purchasing another Bob the Builder video.",1299715200,2,445,4.575
2070145,4,B00029NLBY,fun but for some reason did not appeal to our two and a half year old boy.,1264550400,,74,3.411764705882353
2070146,3,B00029NLBY,My son wanted to watch dvd with bob the builder so I bought this dvd.  but he wasn't too crazy about this dvd. He probably sat there for 5 minutes and that was it.  Maybe it is hard to follow every thing they say and do.  My son is more of the Thomas fun.  This dvd is just sitting on our shelves now.,1246665600,,301,3.7301587301587302
2070147,3,B00029NLBY,"My grandson enjoyed the video. I could have gotten it at the store just as cheaply, though. Just got it since I was already purchasing another toy for him.",1244160000,,155,4.379310344827586
2070148,5,B00029NLBY,"I was overwhelmed by the number of Bob the Builder titles available (it's a TV series in the US too). I figured ""Favorite Adventures"" would be my best bet. So far, after countless viewings, it's still great.

I laughed at Bob's mishaps fumbling with new technology, trying to impress a date, having unexpected company drop by, and best of all, learning how you should never EVER delegate anything to a scarecrow. My child in turn, realized the importance of batteries and started checking all his toys (oh no!), tried a few salsa dance steps, saw how fun ""clean up time"" was if everybody helped, and now asks for pizza every time he watches the episode with the scarecrow. Go figure!",1242864000,4,683,4.691666666666666
2070149,5,B00029NLBY,"I bought this for my three year old grandson and he has watched it on his little portable DVD player everytime he eats.  He loves it!  We don't get the TV show of Bob the Builder, but everyone he is around talks about it, so I decided to try this one.  I ordered three more, but just received them and he was so proud of them even though he hasn't got to watch them yet.  You can't go wrong with this one.",1233446400,2,405,3.902439024390244
2070150,5,B00029NLBY,My almost-3-year-old son loves this movie! He would watch it all day if you let him. Some of the stories are a litte goofy but he seems to love them all.,1229040000,,153,3.967741935483871
2070151,5,B00029NLBY,"Bob the builder is a major hit in the United Kingdom. Very good for younger children and the girls love it as much as the boys! My children started watching this aged about 2 and were soon hooked.

2070204,5,B00029NLBY,"My grandchildren love Bob the Builder. It has story lines that teach children good life lessons (sneaky.... ain't I) while being very entertaining. It is one of the better ""cartoons"" for children without all the violence that is infiltrating the media. Arrived on time and packaged well.",1326153600,,287,5.127659574468085
2070205,5,B00029NLBY,"An amazing set of story's about Bobs adventures and struggles

The collection features the episode where Bobs ""Construction"" site is shutdown by an I.C.E. Raid team. Unable to afford to stay in business without his team of illegal aliens and facing stiff penalties from the government. Bob decides to stage a protest on Washington. All goes well until a few of his close colleagues realize today must be a day to celebrate as is every other day in their cultural calendar so rowdiness soon ensues over packs of Cervezas. The riot squad shows up and end up violating Bobs and his peoples civil rights. The chants of ""Si Puede"" become drowned out by flash bang grenades and the sound of twirling tear gas canisters whizzing by. The ending scene is an absolutely stunning masterpiece from the director. Shot from a ground floor view it shows large crowds dispersing from a thick cloud of tear gas, the camera then pans higher and as it fades away we begin to make out our hero Bob lying face down embraced by a creeping fog, tragically trampled to death and abandoned by the very people he spoke out for.

Bravo! A+ Collection for children. Teaches counting, culture, foreign language and even has a nice dash of politics to plant a seed in minds of our future law-makers.
