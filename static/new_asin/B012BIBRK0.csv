8725810,3,B012BIBRK0,The first season was better.  Disappointed in story and character development.,1496361600,,78,6.090909090909091
8725811,5,B012BIBRK0,Excellent story would help if there were subtitles available as the accents are very thick and hard to understand for American viewers.,1491004800,,135,5.181818181818182
8725812,4,B012BIBRK0,"Not perfect, but I'm glad I bought and viewed Series 2. The Mills labor drama of 1833 England moves ahead to 1838 with continued struggles of the lower class that was so often shown in the filmed works of Dame Catherine Cookson. This is based on the real Quarry Bank Mill, of NW England. Activists continue their cause of getting a vote and better work conditions. Series One of The MILL dealt with British abolition of slavery and an attempt at a child 10-hour work day. This sequel series keeps most of the lead roles but adds some important characters as the mill town is invaded by out-of-work migrants. British industrial revolution spurns new union issues.

The Mill includes top acting stars. Teen orphan Esther (Kerrie Hayes Lilies) received a nomination for best actress. Loom mechanic/builder Daniel (Matthew McNulty The Paradise Lark Rise to Candleford) is now married to Susannah (Holly Lucas). Activist Doherty (Aidan McArdle Mr Selfridge Garrows Law). Greg & Sons Mill now directed by son William (Andrew Lee Potts) with matriarch Hannah (Barbara Marten Casualty) overseeing the gardens, and Windell (Justin Salinger) bookkeeper, and he has a son George (Morgan Watkins Suffragette). Mill floor foreman Boon (Ciaran Griffiths Shameless The Bill) gets demoted.

NO SUBTITLESSHAME ON BFS, and accents are too strong. I recommend watching the first episode to get used to the accents, then begin again. Thats a downside, plus several scenes darkened for ambiance, but so dark the scene is lost, a cinematography disaster, as the sets, costumes, and props are distinctly authentic. These 2 flaws may be the reason the series ended. A shame, as the writing & acting deserved many more years.
&nbsp;Migrants take mill jobs of locals. Wages are cut blamed on Poor Law. Daniels a new dad as migrant John Howlett (Mark Frost Poldark Hope Strings) takes the foreman job from Boon. Howletts wife Rebecca (Laura Main Call the Midwife), roomer shoe apprentice Will (Mark Strepan), his grandfather/cobbler Abe (Dave Hill) all do a great performance. Freed slave Peter (Sope Dirisu) holds a secret.
It is 1838 and whilst John and Daniel celebrate the reprieve of the Tolpuddle Martyrs the new
&nbsp;Over-seer Howletts machinery inexperience conflicts with Daniels job. Esther turns 18 ending her free-labor apprenticeship and she leaves the apprentice house for a cellar room, and flirts with cobbler Will. Susannahs apprentice/sister Miriam (Sacha Parkinson Mr Selfridge) teaches Peter to write.
&nbsp;A union meeting closes the mill after a secret ballot by workers. Equal rights rally a success. Bully apprentice Patience (Holly Kenny Waterloo Road) gets her due. Relationships ripen, conflict heightens.
&nbsp;After 6 months the unions petition is rejected by politicians. The economic slide results in non-union apprentice boys house closed and workers sent to the workhouse. Miriam is let go after her apprenticeship ends, as is brother George Cutterall. Both lodge with sister Susannah. Esthers taking on weight, in front, refuses help. Howletts grieve. Peters told a Grandpa talethen he tells Miriam a tale.
&nbsp;All British mill owners again reduce hours and pay by 25% as economy falters worse. With strike threat looming, the mill asks Howlett to head club-carrying constables. Will pawns cobbler tools for Esthers needs. Aging and ill Hannah confirms Peters grandfather brutal killing story via a letter. Labor walk-out followed by looting and workhouse assault.
&nbsp;Mill vs. labor; WAR. Week 1 food is low, mill economically sound enjoying a no-cost shutdown, few dare cross lines. Week 2 scabs called knobsticks, funerals on both sides. Week 3 violence, Howletts divided, bribery attempt, arrest, starvation, and an ending leaves many issues unresolved in cliff-hanger form, obviously set for the 3rd Series that never materialized.

Best try Series 1 first:

8725813,1,B012BIBRK0,"The Mill is an outstanding series, the one star is for the format. The discs were Canadian in origin  and had no subtitles and the women were just a blur of low volume unable to decipher anything that was said. A total waste of $ I will look into buying the second season from UK as the first season had subtitles.",1482192000,3,314,4.147540983606557
