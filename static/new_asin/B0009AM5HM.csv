2274628,5,B0009AM5HM,"A very early operatic masterpiece, with singers guided by a master film director. Rene Kollo was at his prime with a very convincing performance. Dagmar Koller is a joy to watch and hear. A very worthwhile tranfer to DVD",1209859200,4,220,4.666666666666667
2274629,4,B0009AM5HM,"I've been a fan of Lehar for many years; the beauties of many of his melodies are frequently with me in my mind. I finally decided to see what was available on DVD and found this recording. I've seen it once and look forward to seeing it again at some point.

The Land of Smiles has moments of surpassing melodic beauty; it's these moments that make the production worthwhile. The singers are generally pleasant to see and hear but there is no effort to try and make the ""Asian"" characters look Asian. That really doesn't bother me as the two ""Asian"" principals are pleasant enough looking on their own and they can sing.

If you enjoy Lehar this is probably a worthwhile addition to your library.",1209686400,3,697,4.523809523809524
2274630,5,B0009AM5HM,"Lehar's The Land of Smiles touches the heart as it provides unforgetable melodies from start to finish. There are no weak links in the cast. Too often, we think of operetta as musical fluff, tired cliches, and obligatory dance scenes when things start slowing down. Not so in this classic operetta. We feel the pain of loss suffered by the two main characters, who make their roles natural and believable. There is more to this work than ""Yours Is My Heart Alone."" There is dramatic consistency and people you find yourself caring about as much as the music, the costumes, and the colorful sets. Highly recommended.",1190073600,26,615,4.811320754716981
2274631,5,B0009AM5HM,"This is a lavish TV production of a delightful operetta. I am most impressed with the color print (42 years old) which doesn't look a bit ""shopworn"". The production and cast are excellent. I particularly liked the involvement of Korean Court Ballet. For probably the wrong reasons, I was intriged with Dagmar Kollor as Mi. She is not only beautiful and can sing but she is also a good dancer. When she pranced around the set, my blood pressure went way up! Enought said. Buy it! Enjoy it!",1153353600,24,488,4.556818181818182
2274632,4,B0009AM5HM,"A fine performance of a good operetta. The singing of Rene Kollo is especialy good, and he looks great, even in fake oriental makeup. His rendition of ""Dein ist mein Ganzes Herz"", the hit tune from the show, is far better than the version recorded by Giuseppe di Stefano. Dagmar Koller as Princess Mi is delightfuly athlethic, with some amusing and faintly erotic dance numbers. The rest of the cast is OK. Birgit Pitsch-Sarata looks fabulously Viennese as Lisa, but is not quite the singer she ought to be as the female lead.

The camera work is not quite up to the standards of US musical films of the era and the direction by Authur Maria Rabenault is occasionally awkward, but the photography is crisp and colorful and the setting in a pseudo-Siamese country is visually appealing, if not authentic either to the operetta or the period.

Lehar's story of the clash between oriental and western culture may have resonated with audiences of post-WWI Vienna, but today, it seems a bit dated. Still, much of the music is wonderful, and if you like this sort of thing, it is worthwhile just to hear Rene Kollo at his youthful best.",1140393600,40,1130,4.673366834170854
8058864,5,B0009AM5HM,"I love Rene Kollo in this operetta, he is great, and his co-star Dagmar Koller as well.  Deutsche Grammophon has done another outstanding production.  Radio-Sinfonieorchester Stuttgart performs flawlessly.  I did not like Birgit Pitsch-Sarat at all.  All in all, this is a must have in my Lehar operetta collection.  One of the rare Rene Kollo operettas available on DVD.",1484352000,,371,5.220338983050848
8058865,5,B0009AM5HM,"A beautiful DVD.  The tenors'voice is smooth and his expressions whilst singing ""You are my Hearts Delight "" brought tears to my eyes.",1445558400,,134,4.826086956521739

8058868,4,B0009AM5HM,I am glad to have this disc in my collection. Part of a series made for German TV. Video and sound are quite good as what you would expect from the seventies. A young Rene Kollo does a very good job and the rest of the cast are perform admirably. If you like operetta this is a worthwhile addition.,1421107200,2,298,4.067796610169491
8058869,4,B0009AM5HM,"As a light opera and operetta fan I am glad to add this DVD to my collection, but it will not be a favourite. I have a poor copy of a Morbisch Festival production but I prefer those singers to these ones.  Am especially disappointed in Lisa / Pitsch-Sarata who didn't always hit her top notes too well.

However, overall it is a worthwhile addition and Lehar fans need to have this popular operetta.",1342051200,2,399,4.378378378378378

Music and set up are very lovely.

It is much enjoyed at our house. Amazon does a great job.",1314576000,2,148,4.103448275862069
8058872,5,B0009AM5HM,"Always a delight to hear this, the only Lehar operetta with a tenor as leading character because it was written specifically for Richard Tauber by his close friend, Franz Lehar.  Tenor is excellent but not Tauber (who is??).  I had the pleasure of seeing the great Richard Tauber live on Broadway in his only-ever visit to America in the late 1940s. Idiot critics panned it because of stupid jokes, obviously oblivious of who Tauber was.  It closed after 5 days and Tauber died a year or so later.  He was forced to sing Yours Is My Heart Along 4 times and might have sang it more but it was a matinee and he moved to the footlights, explained to the audience that he was not well and still had another performance that evening and needed to rest.  We begrudgingly let him go.",1274140800,3,776,4.436619718309859
8058873,4,B0009AM5HM,"I remember seeing this type of program when I was living in Germany in the 1970's. It is a typically lavish German production- scenery and costumes no expense spared. What a pity no American TV channel has the courage  or the know how to put on a production like this. The voices were all excellent , the best that West Germany could produce in 1972.
Amazon should try to obtain more DVD's of this type and quality.",1255219200,6,415,4.3896103896103895
