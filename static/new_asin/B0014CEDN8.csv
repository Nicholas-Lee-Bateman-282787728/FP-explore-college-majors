8255097,5,B0014CEDN8,"This (B/W) Arabic classic version (1964) of Alexandre Dumas' The Conte De Monte Cristo is one of the best adaptation that I have ever seen. I even think it is better than many of the other English made version. I highly recommend this version for the fan of the original novel (Available subtitles: Arabic, English, French)
