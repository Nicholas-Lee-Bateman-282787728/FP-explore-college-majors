6248662,1,B00I40IBPO,"My Kids luv this DVD... They love anything that's Elmo, but they just love looking at this cover that this. I have 2 under 3 and they both want to know ""Why Elmo won't talk to them. After playing for ONE day, the DVD will no longer play. We tried on different DVD players as well as game systems and nothing. These Amazon's DVDS are by far the worst DVD purchased I have ever made. Its like buying a bootleg copy.  NEVER BUYING A DVD FROM U ALL AGAIN.",1434412800,,451,4.067415730337078
6248663,4,B00I40IBPO,Didn't show as much of Elmo as we had hoped.,1434326400,,44,3.5
6248664,5,B00I40IBPO,Delightful for my 19 month old and I enjoy watching it with him.,1427760000,,64,4.0
6248665,5,B00I40IBPO,"My toddler LOVES this dvd. She has the attention span of a fruit fly, so that really means something. Lol. As far as name calling, Oscar does call Chris Rock a Rock head. It really didn't bother me. The music was great and there were some really good morals about family, friends and to on keep trying. It is also funny enough to entertain the adults. Her favorite portion is Elmo's world. She yells, ""Singing one, singing one!"" Very satisfied!",1410307200,,444,4.5625
6248666,1,B00I40IBPO,"If I could, I would give this DVD 0 stars. It's terrible. The language is awful. Name calling, bullying, making fun of and laughing at each other in a mean spirited way. The most disappointing, ""How the heck?!"", is used in the movie. Is that necessary for the age of the audience?  It's the intention of the use of the word that's disturbing.  I don't like it when my 10 yo or 9 yo use the word. I don't need an Elmo movie reinforcing it! There is a lot of frustration and sadness throughout the movie. Not the typical happy, seasame street/Elmo movie.
Most of the songs are wonderful. Just the sound track would be great and not all of the other negativity in the movie.

*Update-I'm sorry to say I hadn't watched the movie before playing it for my 2 yo twins. Who has to preview an Elmo movie? I was putting them in their car seats as the movie was playing and I glanced up during one of the song and saw a woman in a tight, gold, mini skirt/dress dancing provocatively followed by others doing the same. I guess it's not any worse than dancing with the stars or other shows like that but this isn't dancing with the stars. It's Elmo!  They could have had energetic dancing with appropriately dressed people and the movie would have been better suited for the age group it is targeting.
I'm probably coming across as a prude during this review. Lol. I'm not. I'm just disappointed in this movie and it's content. Not what I expected from an Elmo movie that all.",1405987200,,1463,4.367647058823529
6248667,1,B00I40IBPO,"VERY disappointed!!!  The details  of this DVD did not specify that it consists of the DVD Elmopalooza and an
Elmo's World about singing and drawing.  I already owned both!!!  What a scam!  And how sad that my
Son was disappointed on his birthday!!!!!!!",1405900800,3,253,4.790697674418604

8638972,3,B00I40IBPO,"Elmopaloosa portion of the DVD is ok. It is just artists singing weird versions of their songs in different genres. My daughter will not watch 2 minutes of this crappy music. It's not like children's sing along which would be much better. Bring Alicia keys in to sing Mary had a little lamb (in a NORMAL rhythm).

The Elmo's world portions are cute & that is the only section my daughter will watch.",1473206400,,399,4.465753424657534
8638973,5,B00I40IBPO,Excellent early learning: vintage Elmo!,1470441600,,39,7.0
8638974,1,B00I40IBPO,My daughter LOVES Elmo!!!  She was so excited when she received this dvd as a gift for Valentine's Day and couldn't wait to watch it. This dvd only consists of Elmopalooza which she cares nothing for and Elmo's World. The Elmo's World option will not even play on the dvd. Waste of money because it will never be watched.,1455667200,,321,4.440677966101695
8638975,2,B00I40IBPO,"I'm not sure if I got what I paid for.  The DVD that we received was only a 40-minute program, clearly from the 90s.  It had musical acts from the Fugees, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Shawn Colvin, and my husbands favorite Rosie O'Donnell.  It was a nice memory throw-back for me and my toddler seems to like the music but what I got was not what was advertised.",1451779200,,358,4.313432835820896
