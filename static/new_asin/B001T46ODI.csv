8340437,3,B001T46ODI,"The DVD is a good documentary of the more exciting portions of the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service (executive protection and threat interdiction) and the job of the State Department's engineers.  As DSS is a fairly low profile agency, this is an excellent introductory film regarding the more interesting points of DSS.  My only complaint is the DVD-R that the documentary was written on degraded (as all video burned DVD-Rs are prone to) and is no longer watchable beyond a certain point as it stutters uncontrollably and hangs in DVD players.",1255824000,4,559,5.131868131868132
