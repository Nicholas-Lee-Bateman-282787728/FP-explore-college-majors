262775,5,6300218252,"i find it difficult to know if i would like to buy this video and  several others that may in fact be good because i have no idea what ballets are in them.  i know there's four tapes in this collection, but i don't know what's on them.  i don't know where else to write this, but i hope someone reads this.

262776,4,6300218252,"This VHS is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen of naval  aviation. It has nearly 60 minutes of footage most people have never seen,  and some really cool carrier footage. Quite a lot of it is outdated, many  from 1974 to 1990, and some of the aircraft displayed do not exist anymore.  Nevertheless, it gives accurate descriptions of US Navy aircraft, some  incredible Topgun training footage, and actual voice recordings and gun  camera footage from the 1989 Libyan MiG shoot-down. It is quite awesome to  listen to, although the footage it incorporates are all stock footage and  not of the real incident. In fact, the F-14 Tomcats shown flying are the of  the wrong squadron, which is VF-84 Jolly Rogers, when the actual shoot-down  involved Tomcats from VF-32! THe footage is in fact from the late 1970s. In  addition, there is an awesome Blue Angels sequence, showing them doing  their deomnstration. The soundtrack is, strangely enough, pretty cool,  especially the Blue Angels music. It is worth watching and collecting, even  if a little out-of-date.",968198400,,1069,4.966101694915254
262777,4,6300218252,"This is the fourth Denise Austin video I have tried and so far it one of my favorites.  I liked that the video was split into two sections and had a lot of variety in the moves. I don't know how effective the aerobics in the  first section were for me--I would have liked more intensity and a faster  pace, but the second half got me into a sweat!  The scenery was a nice  change from a usual gym, but I wish the camera had stayed focused entirely  on her rather than moving at strange angles.  Overall, it was still a good  workout and I think I will definitly try some more of her videos!",963705600,8,590,4.069565217391304
262778,2,6300218252,"As a beginner, I found this video difficult to keep up with - the pace is extremely fast and the movements are too advanced for someonme just starting out. I would recommend the fitness video ""Callenetics""  for beginners. By the way, the guy in the second part of the ""Fat  Burning"" video looks dazed and confused - that alone speaks volumes.",954979200,2,342,4.590163934426229
262779,1,6300218252,"My roommates and I saw this video and decided to give it a try... I could not believe that this was seriously a workout video and not a spoof!  The first half is a ridiculously monotonous set of endless cha-cha and  side-to-side moves that are boring and ineffective.
The second half works  you harder, but is still cheesy and consists of bad moves.  Denise Austin  says many motivating things, but the exercise just doesn't meet her level  of enthusiasm.
I have never written a review for Amazon before, but after  I did this ""workout"" I knew I had to write one for this video and  tell you to SAVE YOUR MONEY!",954547200,5,611,4.441441441441442
262780,5,6300218252,"Get fit quick with this efficent workout.  I have only used it about 7 times, and I can't get enough.  I love the variety and I love the length.  It's long enough to make you sweat, but not too long where you want to quit  before it's time to.  I have lupus, and I don't have a lot of energy, but  after I do this workout, I feel energized.  I love it.",954288000,,352,3.8055555555555554
262781,5,6300218252,"I just bought the tape, its pretty good.  Like everyone else I like the second one better.  If you don't have weights use a radio.  One of the boxes thats a little over a person in length.  It works pretty good.  If  you get confused at the movements, like the double punch, just do something  else.  The guy in the second workout proves that we should not be allowed  to do this in public.",948758400,,390,4.162162162162162

7806673,2,6300218252,"I was disappointed with this video.  I was all fired up to burn some fat, but this video just didn't get my heart rate up much.  There were way too many dance steps and little instruction. I felt like I was doing the cha-cha forever. Also, she didn't cue well from one move to the next.",1113264000,2,286,4.089285714285714
7806674,3,6300218252,"I have a few Denise Austin videos and this is definitely one of her worst.  Although Denise is her usually chipper-self (which is ok with me), she provides very little cueing and manages to make me feel lost in this one!  Granted, I'm not the most coordinated person but am usually able to follow moves in exercise videos.  The camera also keeps focusing on her upper body in various segments so you don't know what her legs are doing!  If you really like dancing, this video might appeal to you but the level of instruction is terrible.  I gave it 3 stars instead of two because she does get your heart rate up (esp. b/c you are scrambling to catch up), the scenery is pleasant, and she mangages to be enthusiastic no matter what.",1057881600,2,731,4.425373134328358
7806675,5,6300218252,"I just love DA! I have lost 25 pounds without dieting using her videos!! The first segment of this video is low impact, but if you give a little extra umph of your own it is easily raised and all of the dance steps are so much fun. The second segment with the interval traning is quite a bit tougher and very fun as well, with this tape I like to do both segments for a great aerobic workout, or on those days that I am just not feeling up to it I do segment one because it is a little easier and by the time it is over my mood is usually great, she is so motivating, and she is very easy to follow, it makes me wonder why all the bad reviews, it seems like a lot of people like to copy and paste a review just to knowck something. This is a great video if you like dancey moves.",1049241600,,779,3.814814814814815
