7909117,5,B00000GIA9,"The Venus Wars was a great movie.  Mainly because it didn't feature a mindless plot (a la Tenchi Muyo, Gundam Wing, Princess Mononoke) and stayed focused on its point.  It was about a war, and the people who got caught up in it.  There were no faries (A real problem in Anime), no magic, no super-powers.  It was Man & Machine fighting against Man & Machine, and was done in a wonderful manner.  Without bowing to some of the stereotypes of Japanime (Graphic nudity, sex, violence) The Venus Wars is, by far, my favorite Japanime of all time.  It manages to paint a vivid picture without getting preachy or becoming insipid.  Truly a great work.",976233600,5,645,4.556521739130435
7909118,5,B00000GIA9,"This movie just downright rocked.  It had good VAs, unlike most dubs, and the storyline and script seemed very realistic even though it's heavy sci-fi.  Characters have deep personalities and not just pretty-face gloss.  A classic, no doubt.",963532800,,241,5.2894736842105265
7909119,5,B00000GIA9,"Now i have seen alot of anime and magna videos.  I have seen everything in the many local video stores including Armitage III, Macross Plus, Macross 2, Battle Angel (another great story) and have to say this is one of my  definitive favorites of all time.  I saw the sub-Titled so not sure how  good the Dubbed is but the animation is stellar and far surpasses Akira  (classic).  Plus the bikes they ride are kick ass while the story flows and  has an amazing ending.  A must see for all Anime Fans.",955843200,,499,4.3478260869565215
7909120,5,B00000GIA9,"It took me only one viewing of this revolutionary feature to make me fall in love with Japanimation forever.  One night after staying up until 2 am to see the Sci-Fi Channel's mutilated version of ""VENUS WARS"", I  was totally blown away by the sheer realistic look of all the explosions in  this movie.
At first I had the original Jappanese version, which I have  found recently, still was not totally complete.  Just a couple of months  ago I got a hold of a complete dubbed version which I can enjoy watching  without missing all the action.  And action is the name of the game here.  A surprise attack on a Veusian settlement quickly turns into a victory for  the invaders because of their superrior firepower.  Their Octo Tanks seem  to be invincible.  All the fighting scenes with incredibly real animation  will take your breath away.  The characters are your typical restless  youngsters caught between an occupationary force and their own politicians  who are no better than cowardly collaborators.  So the fight must be taken  to the invaders and that's what these mono-cycle racers do.  The bulk of  the story revolves around The main character named ""Hero"" (hint,  hint!), and an Earth journalist named ""Suzane Sommers"" (uh-huh!)  and their various exploits and heartbreaks.
This movie is revolutionary  mainly because of the early attempt to integrate 3D cell animation into the  2D medium.  These animators should be applauded for their efforts even if  the end results do not look as seemless as in ""Ghost In The  Shell"".  Other than that this movie is one of the best in high octane  action anime movies out there.  DO NOT MISS IT.  In fact, do yourself a big  favor and buy it for your endless viewing pleasure.",949968000,10,1727,4.784982935153583
