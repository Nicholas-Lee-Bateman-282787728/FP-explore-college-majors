8126558,1,B000FTI1TS,"If you are a logical person with even 5% of Functional Brain Activity , You will find this movie a crap. This movie was a great success during its Era as it was shot in US and all seven wonders of the world was pictured. This movie was fabulous to watch  in 70 MM screen due to its Camera and Bright US background which was new for Tamil Audience.

Music was another big highlight scores from ARR with Aish and Nazar good acting.

Worst scene is the US Operation scene which was a third rated one and funny to watch !",1508716800,,517,4.099009900990099

8126560,1,B000FTI1TS,"I was excited to get this movie, but then greatly disappointed when the language was foriegn even with the subtitles in English, was not a good movie.  I hate spending money on a movie then it goes in the trash.  There was nothing to tell me the movie was not in English, it was like a  cheap, B rate one.  Would not recommend it to any one in this country unless you understand the language & like the misfit pictures.",1172620800,,419,4.2
8126561,2,B000FTI1TS,"Madhumita (Aishwarya Rai) and her brother Madesh bring their grandmother (Lakshmi) to have a brain tumor surgery in America (yes, it's a comedy). At the U.S. airport, they are stalled by security and it falls on Vishu (Prashanth) to rescue them. Later on, Vishu aids them again, this time with a decidedly more grave problem. By this time, his and Madhumita's relatives have gotten to know each other - Vishu's family consisting of a twin brother Ramu (also played by Prashanth) and their forceful dad Rajamani (Nasser), himself also a twin. Vishu and Madhu fall in love and want to be wed. But the fly in the ointment is provided by Rajamani, who insists that his twin sons will only marry twin sisters (he has his reasons). So what does Madhu's over-the-top grandma do but concoct a zany scheme wherein Madhu poses as her own fictional bespectacled twin sister Vaishnavi... Ah, but then what happens when Vishu's twin Ramu falls in love with Vaishnavi?

Wow! This is NOT a good movie. Let me be more clear: Jeans is a singularly awful movie. It's deserving of one and a half stars (but will show up as 2 stars on Amazon). Other than Aish dancing fabulously and looking indelibly lovely as ever (especially in her traditional Indian garb), I truly can't recommend much about the film. There's one particular scene showcasing two dueling dancing Aishwarya Rais (there's a holographic computer involved but - just don't ask) that is embarassingly worthy of thirteen and a thousand cringes from a pained viewer; that scene's not Aish's fault, it's just executed really poorly. I also have a beef with Eros, the distributing company of this flick: why aren't the songs subtitled? Granted, the musical numbers weren't much to speak of but I still would've appreciated the translation - and who knows, it might've elevated my low opinion of the songs. Also, there seems to be something amiss with the synchronicity of the actors' lip movements with the audio. My understanding is that this dvd version has Hindi language dubbing over the original Tamil. But I guess my biggest complaint is the ending. Man alive, I sat all agape at the screen as the closing credits rolled on, disbelieving the abrupt, discordant ending. I won't go into it (except to say that that infernal holographic computer is in the mix again) but I vehemently state that, except for Aish dancing like Michael Jackson at the end, the closing minutes alarmingly suck.

Now on to the acting, or lack of it. I feel Nasser is the only one who came to work here. Both of Nasser's twins have weight and frankly seem more real than the other characters. Prashanth's twin roles are acted blandly; Vishu and Ramu are woodenly interchangeable, with no distinguishing characteristics whatsoever (maybe that's what their dad Rajamani desired, that his sons dress alike, be so much alike and be so close to each other that they'll find it hard to part ways, but it's very inconvenient for the viewer). The grandmother, Madhu's brother and parents all take turns in being annoying and/or incomprehensible. And I really detest Sundaramba, the shrill, venomous wife of Rajamani's twin brother (which means, I guess, that the actress who plays her, Raadhika, actually does a good job). That a key part of the movie's resolution revolves around her having a change of heart is just not believable to me. Jeans came out in 1998 and is one of Aish's earlier films (only her fourth, I believe) and yes, she's at times stilted in her acting. But, don't fret, she makes up for it the next year with the incandescent  romance Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam.

I adore the ground Aish walks on so I do want to end on a positive note. Should you ever watch Jeans (and if you're a fan of Aish, you actually will want to), keep an eye out for the scene where Madhu is at the airport, about to go back home to India. Airport security is going thru her bag and finds in it an empty Coke can, dead batteries and candy wrappers. My reaction to the scene was ""Oh, c'mon now!"" But, really, it's a rather sweet moment.",1149897600,,4041,4.711456859971712
