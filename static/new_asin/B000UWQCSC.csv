8293677,5,B000UWQCSC,"With all the softer, more speculative contributions to the History of Sex series of late, and lots of scholars making up creative theories to explain their assumptions, I was delighted to catch a re-run of this early entry in the series from 2002.  WOW.  Fantastic documentary, interviews with vets who were there, copious footage and photos to take you back, and revelations about the military and police's unique relationship with a thriving community of prostitutes living and working on Hotel Street in Honolulu.  Has everything you could want for historians interested in the true, and untold, stories of WWII, and for anyone interested in the tale of how the US government administered and organized brothels for several years during WWII.  Facts, facts and more facts for the buff.  Rare to find so candid a portrait.  Only thing missing is interviews with some of the ladies (though understandable, as many presumably returned to tamer lives on the mainland).",1267401600,,967,5.127388535031847
