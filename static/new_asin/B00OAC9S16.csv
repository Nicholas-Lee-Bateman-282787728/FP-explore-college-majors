8682944,4,B00OAC9S16,"This is the 3rd CD I purchased thinking this was ALL Keli Roberts but it is a mixture of a few different trainers.  We really didn't use this as I prefer Keli.  Sometimes the other trainers make the exercises complicated.  for instance, put your arms up as you turn sideways and do a squat then lift your leg and bend down and then your lost.  Too many steps in one exercise gets you frustrated and makes it hard to workout. especially when you are older than 25!  Keli does great exercises and explains how to do them.  She makes them hard but you don't do them for too long.  You get the point where you say ""OMG I don't know if I can keep doing this...Oh she's done!!""  She does just enough and then moves to a different exercise. And I love her demeanor.",1461369600,2,758,4.215277777777778
