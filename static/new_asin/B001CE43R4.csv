3511167,5,B001CE43R4,This documentary is a rare look at a disappearing way of life that began some 300 years ago when soldiers accompanying the Jesuits into Baja California settled and established ranchos. It's a scenically beautiful movie done with great affection for the cowboys and remote lands of the mountainous interior of Baja California. In a mix of Spanish and English with subtitles when necessary this movie makes you want to book a long ride by horse or mule into the Sierras.,1243382400,4,468,4.8625
3511168,5,B001CE43R4,"We own mules and donkeys so this video really spoke to us. However, any one with an interest in history or learning more about the old way of life in the West will find this film fascinating. This is a glimpse into the lives of special people and one has to wonder as the modern world encroaches what will remain of their world as they know it now.",1223596800,8,348,4.132352941176471
3511169,5,B001CE43R4,"COWBOY MAGAZINE REVIEW by Darrell Arnold, Summer 2008

This incredible video may be the best documentary I have ever seen. After viewing it one time, I had the almost irresistible urge to saddle a mule and ride into the Sierra San Francisco, 500 miles south from San Diego, California.

Descanso, California, Saddlemaker Garry McClintock ventured into the remote mountain valleys of central Baja, California and recorded the lifestyle of the last remaining true Californios. 3,000 people who live so remotely that many of their ranchos can only be reached after many hours of riding mule back into deep and rugged canyons.

These are the descendants of the vaqueros who settled the ranch lands of California and they still live lives almost identical to that their ancestors experienced 300 years ago. Their only transportation is via mules, burros, and sometimes horses and their existence in the arid land depends on the scarce availability of water and the cattle and goats that provide the basis of their subsistence.

Their carefully husbanded gardens were built from earth hauled into the rocky canyons bottoms on the backs of burros and are carefully nurtured by ingeniously engineered water relocation projects.

Almost completely self-sufficient, the people still survive by making virtually all their own products, from food to clothing, boots and shoes, to homes, to saddles, to ropes, to bits, to spurs, and everything else tenders of livestock must have to accomplish their day-to-day tasks.

Their economic system is one of neighboring, sharing, and bartering; leather crafters trade with silver-smiths, gardeners trade with meat and cheese producers, home builders trade with animal traders. It has only been in recent times that actual money has entered the equation.

We don't have enough space in this review to say all that needs to be said about this beautiful documentary. It deserves five gold stars for sure.

You'll be doing yourself a giant favor purchasing and viewing this impressive production.",1222214400,13,2022,5.277258566978193

8287280,4,B001CE43R4,I'm still laughing at the improvised whoopie cushion they made out of that animal bladder.,1431129600,,90,5.066666666666666
8287281,5,B001CE43R4,"I was introduced to this movie several years ago at the Todos Santos Film Festival in Baja California Sur. Since I love Baja and the people this film really touches me. ""Corazon Vaquero - The Heart of the Cowboy"" is truly a journey back in time to the heart of the cowboy. The lives portrayed are those of a way of life that is much unchanged since the 1600's, a way of life being replaced with the modern world.
This movie is done in such an accessable manner that you are transported to the world of Baja off the highway, it's wild nature and heart and the peoople who live and work there. I urge you to take this trip. It is educational, entertaining and for me very emotional.",1356825600,,680,4.27906976744186
8287282,5,B001CE43R4,"The American cowboy, so famous in movies that were instrumental in the booming cattle industry of the old west, learned his skills and techniques from vaqueros like these.  This documentary was absolutely awesome!!! Many of these vaqueros were descendants of the Spanish colonial day, ""soldado de cuera"" who once escorted the catholic missionaries as they converted the native Americans to Catholicism, bringing their skills and talents with them. This is incredible, can't stop watching it.",1355184000,,491,5.546666666666667
8287283,5,B001CE43R4,"As one who has lived amongst the Rancheros of Baja California Sur for the last 30 years, I can say this is a very accurate portrayal . Never in my travels around the world have I met people of equal integrity, humor or ability to survive in a harsh environment. Their generosity while having so few possessions is humbling. I am honored to have known them. They have taught me so much.",1351296000,,385,4.361111111111111
8287284,5,B001CE43R4,"This documentary shows the way of life of the vaqueros in the Sierra de San Francisco in Baja California. This DVD entices you to go there and experience the scenery, the art of working with the animals in perfect harmony with the rather hostile surroundings. We highly recommend these film to learn more about these brave-hearted vaqueros who endure and enjoy life in this beautiful remote sierra. We were there in March 2012 and were absolutely amazed by these cowboys and the incredible countryside. A DVD worthwile to purchase and to see several times!
Last but not least: Plan a trip to the Sierra de San Francisco in Baja California for a close encounter with the real vaqueros!",1341792000,,684,4.805084745762712
8287285,5,B001CE43R4,"I was so moved by this authentic, original DVD.  Real people, history we can be proud.  The people in the USA could learn so much about values, integrity and community.  Strong, kind and loving people, no bully's in the Sierra de Gigante Mountains on the Baja.  I am going to explore the terrain and people in these mountains on mules.",1336262400,,335,4.533333333333333
8287286,4,B001CE43R4,Very interesting to know that in this day and age such a community of real cowboys are able to live such a life. I only hope the highway doesn't allow so many visitors as to change their life style. This was a great DVD.I gave it to a care home for a women who is crazy about Horses and Donkeys. She is having fun remembering the good old days.,1332201600,,344,4.0
8287287,5,B001CE43R4,This is a record of a life style which is both very old and traditional and in danger of disappearing.  Exceptionally well done with great care and great skill to bring the ancient ways of life to us in a beautiful and moving manner.  So important to have such a moving documentation of a special lifestyle.  If you care at all for Baja California you MUST see this!,1321833600,2,366,4.352941176470588
8287288,5,B001CE43R4,"My DVD came quickly. Corazon Vaqueo was in perfect shape. It give a real view of a working ranch in Baja that is still self-suffient. They are still doing things the same as they did hundreds of years ago. See how they tan leather using tree bark for curing. They make all their own riding equiptment, farm their own food, loom and sew their own clothes. See the very first whoopie cushion made from the insides of a steer. Very funny.",1254614400,5,435,4.382716049382716
