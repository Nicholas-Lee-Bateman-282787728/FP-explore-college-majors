8475749,5,B00150CED0,"The Phantom Ram is a wildlife documentary filmed inside Yellowstone National Park before the days of Nat Geo, Discovery, and Animal Planet. Eastman was really a Pioneer in Outdoor documentaries. This one appears to be mid 70's (guessing) and follows the life of a spectacular ram for 2.5 years of it's life. Eastman films and narrates the documentary and IMO it is very very well done considering the technology available. I saw this first in the late 90's and it made a indelible mark on me. Being able to find it again in a modern format (DVD) in 2016 allowed me to experience that memory that stayed with me for almost 20 years to come back to life. For me it was worth the $30; if you have no connection to it, or to classic ""outdoor"" films, or bighorns or Yellowstone - then stay way - you won't feel it's worth the money. For me - I LOVED IT.",1463097600,,848,4.339622641509434
