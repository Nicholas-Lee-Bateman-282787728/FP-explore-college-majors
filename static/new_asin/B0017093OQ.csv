8264287,1,B0017093OQ,"I so wish I'd read the other reviews before I bought this.  One of the reviewers said she felt bad all morning after doing this practice.  That was exactly my response.  It's simply infuriating for many reasons.

-  The music is way to loud for her voice.  And her voice is a mumble without the music!  So it's hard to understand what she's saying.
-  The she gives the name of the poses in whatever languge that was, and then the English version -- which she sometimes does not give.  How stupid is that?  Why should we be expected to learn the names of the poses in another language?  What's the point in giving the English version 2nd?  So even in the voice only version, it becomes useless unless you learn the foreign names of the poses.
-  From great yoga teachers like Rodney Yee and Barbara Benagh and Lilias, etc., you get the tiny tips of where to place your balance, focus . . . how to actually do the pose correctly.  Nothing like that here.  She couldn't even manage to say something simple like ""palms together.""  Instead it was hands up and then when you were finally up, you see everyone had their palms together.
-  And all the people in the video were doing their own thing and badly, as if they've just started doing yoga.

It's unusable.

What a shame.  The setting is really pretty.  But what an amateurish production in every way.  The worst thing about it is I could not trust the yoga teacher because she didn't seem to know much and obviously not able to teach much, either.

These days when anyone can throw anything out there to sell on Amazon, the quality of things is just ridiculously low in all kinds of products, this being one of them.  Boo!  So disappointing.",1434585600,,1693,4.401294498381877
8264288,1,B0017093OQ,I shopped a long time before deciding on this video.  I was very disappoited when I received this today to find that all four versions skip or momentarily stop.  Imagine trying to get through the meditation portion and having to be distracted with the constant stopping or skipping of the video.  I am sending this back right now for a refund.,1299456000,,343,4.590163934426229
8264289,5,B0017093OQ,I really like this DVD. It is not to hard at all. It is perfect when you really don't want to do a hard practice! It maybe for beginners but I think seasoned yogis will like it to! You will feel very refreshed and relaxed when done.,1234569600,,232,3.9574468085106385
8264290,3,B0017093OQ,"I was very much looking forward to this DVD.  I was expecting a gentle, flowing yoga practice that was relaxing and meditative.  It really wasn't that.  It was a hard yoga practice, that just moved slowly.  She holds the poses a long while, a little too slow for my taste.  I got bored, and found it very difficult, which made me frustrated.  Others may love this though.

It was beautifully shot, and beautifully done.  If you like to hold poses for quite a while, I would recommend trying this DVD.  I don't know that it's really appropriate for beginners though?  It was challenging to hold the poses for that long.  And some of the poses were pretty hard, although she often gave a modification.  I think a beginner would be frustrated.  I consider myself an intermediate and I was a bit frustrated.

A couple problems I saw:

1. There were a couple times I noticed when she would hold a pose on one side MUCH longer than on the other.  2-3 times longer in some cases.  This didn't seem to happen too often, but it happened.

2. Sometimes I could not hear her words over the music.  I was using the detailed instruction.  This was frustrating at times.  Turning up the volume wouldn't help, because it would just make the music louder too.  Dubbing problem I guess.

All in all, I do think this is a very nice yoga DVD.  The choice of music is nice as well.  The instructor's voice is soothing.  The practice just was not for me.",1219104000,8,1433,4.415384615384616
8264291,2,B0017093OQ,"I loved the beginning of this practice but as it moved on, I discovered that it was not for me. There was too much forward folding for my personality, I was in a pretty bad mood for most of the morning after this practice. I don't think there was enough heart opening to counteract all of the forward folding. So, I would not recommend this for someone who has a tendency towards depression or feeling low. Vinyasa normally puts me in a fantastic frame of mind and this practice did just the opposite. I also felt that some of the poses were not balanced. Like in warrior, it seemed that we were on the left side much longer than on the right and this happened with a few of the poses. I also felt that there was a lack of twisting asanas.

I did like the scenery and felt that the people in the video were inspiring. I have another DVD by Jennifer that I have not tried and am hoping for better results.

And one last thing, I would not recommend this to someone just starting out in yoga for a couple of reasons. There is heavy use of Sanskrit without much explanation and secondly, I don't feel that some of the poses are for beginners. Mainly, shoulder stand which can cause very serious injury if you don't know what you are doing or if you don't have a live human there to help you.",1214265600,4,1288,4.2317073170731705
8264292,5,B0017093OQ,This is such a cleansing and inspiring practice.  The pacing is just right for a sunrise practice and the tone of Jyl's voice is reassuring.  The asana sequence is very well thought out and all the models were inspiring with their perfect poses.,1208908800,2,245,4.674418604651163
