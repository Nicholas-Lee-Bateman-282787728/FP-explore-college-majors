4013627,5,B002YMWQ2M,"The title More Than a Game is more than a little clich, and the most basic summary of this documentary's premise does little to refute that initial impression: the story of five inner city youths who forge something beyond friendship while pursuing their high school hoop dreams. But the journey of the ""Fab Five"" who made up the core of the St. Vincent-St. Mary basketball team in Akron, Ohio earlier in the decade is not exactly your average sports saga, filled with extraordinary characters and equally extraordinary circumstances that Hollywood could craft no better in any feature script. Any filmmaker blessed with such serendipitous narrative riches would be content to simply recount the not-so-tall tale, but director Kristopher Belman takes it an added step: bringing the larger-than-life back down to a universally relatable scale.

Figures hardly come more larger-than-life than LeBron James, the Fighting Irish alum who (as the world over has come to know) first caught national sports media attention during his high school stint and has since become one of most celebrated and recognizable stars in all of sports, let alone in basketball. With the knowledge of James's ultimate NBA fairy tale fate, the temptation would be to focus the film solely on his rise, but his story is duly treated as but one of the threads borne out of what was originally the ""Fab Four""--James, ""Little"" Dru Joyce III, Willie McGee, and Sian Cotton, whom we see in some rare home video honing their individual skills and team chemistry from way back when they were pre-teens. Playing in the Amateur Athletic Union, the quartet lived up to the ""Shooting Stars"" team name, building on their local Ohio successes to shock observers in a national tournament down in Florida; however, the four's first taste of national success will turn out to be just shy of complete victory.

And, like most lives, that bittersweet experience reflects the greater journeys followed in More Than a Game. Given the presence of James, one expects this to be a film full of triumphs, but what make those resonate even more strongly in the end are the relatable setbacks, obstacles, and shake-ups that occur along the way. In fact, falling into that last category are two people who will come to complete the ""fab"" family and help lift the entire unit to new heights, Romeo Travis and ""Little Dru""'s father, Dru Joyce II. But long before those heights, each initially enters the basketball picture under less than ideal circumstances: Travis in sophomore year at St. Vincent-St. Mary's, where his surly demeanor quickly clashes with the core quartet, who had just led the school to a championship the previous season; Joyce II in junior year, who takes over the head coaching position from a decorated predecessor despite minimal experience. How the four manage to evolve into a ""Fab Five"" and, above all else, a family of six headed by Coach Dru proves not so much a result of their hard work on the hardwood than of the growth they each must undergo as people.

The film's structure reinforces that latter point. Instead of going the standard route of going through each person's background at the top, Belman gives the individual histories at appropriate, organic moments within the overall narrative. While this approach does mean that some events early in the film unfold without a complete familiarity with or understanding of all of the players, spreading the stories out pays off in a couple of respects. Instead of blurring into a muddle, it allows each person to have their time to shine and their respective stories breathe and remain clear to the viewer. But even more effectively, the backstories are used beyond mere exposition to illuminate certain key events that affect the group as a whole--further underscoring the greater idea of how various circumstances seemingly centered on one person can cause repercussions for the collective. Chief among these developments, of course, is the hysteria and hype that arises around James after he is featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated, suddenly catapulting midwestern high school hoops into a nationally televised arena. The film admirably does not downplay any of the well-documented dramas and tensions that then sprung forth from James's literally overnight fame, but instead of wallowing in sensational celebrity scandal, Belman keeps these developments in their proper perspective in regards to the bigger picture: how they affected the entire group and what they all aimed to accomplish.

That is an example of how and why More Than a Game works--showing the grounded, real-life terms and consequences of an increasingly surreal chain of events. Only a select few people can completely relate to being blessed with natural athletic ability and talent at such a young age; even fewer still would relate to being suddenly thrust into the media spotlight and scrutiny. But underneath that gloss and glamour is the classic tale of boys growing into men, of people learning the importance of the greater group glory over the individual shine, with the distinctly drawn personalities of each of the five offering a fairly diverse set of entry points for the viewer to understand and relate. Ironically enough, in balancing his attention between everyone on the team, Belman offers deeper, uncommonly intimate insight into the film's marquee name; one is a witness what is perhaps James's most critical, formative period through the eyes of those who not only knew him best, but had a huge hand in shaping the superstar ""King James"" so familiar to sports fans today. But if lifting-oneself-from-a-hard-knock-childhood-through-big-dreams is fairly commonplace film fodder, More Than a Game's trump card comes in an arc that is not as commonly told and even more empowering: the story of Coach Dru, as the film is just as much about him coming into his own. If James's story confirms the prevailing contemporary notion that one's opportunity for success comes--and then passes--only while one is young, that of the elder Dru counters that, rather poignantly proving that one does not have to settle for comfort and complacency, for one's true calling and self-actualization may not arrive until later in life.

That statement may make More Than a Game sound pretentious, but such weightier ideas are delivered in a very accessible and entertaining package. The Fab Five make an affable and appealing, funny and fun group, and Belman accordingly has fun, fighting the trap of talking head-and-news-clip documentary monotony and keeping the film visually dynamic. Beyond some snazzy (but not overdone) graphic work that gives the documentary staples of old photos and newspaper headlines some motion and flair, Belman also manages to lend some variety to the basketball footage, with each pivotal game edited and presented in their own subtly distinct way; for instance, some visual repetitiveness is avoided by simply not shooting scoreboards in the same way. Belman even has a little fun with the standard closing ""where are they now"" text cards without resorting to overwrought editorializing or labored stabs at profundity.

While it certainly helps to be familiar with the game of basketball and a fan of the sport to enjoy More Than a Game, it is far from necessary. Basketball is what brought the Fab Five and Coach Dru together and was and remains a shared passion, but the game is almost incidental to the larger idea: not only that those from not exactly the most privileged of backgrounds can indeed dream and succeed, but that one doesn't necessarily do it by oneself. Not looking out for number one but instead always looking out for each other is what made Coach Dru and the Fab Five what they were as a team, who they have become as people today--and why their story and this film are so richly moving and inspirational.",1260835200,46,7866,5.065586419753086
4013628,4,B002YMWQ2M,"This documentary is about five talented basketball players. The main character LeBron James leads the team. Their goal is to make it to the State Championship, then win the championship game. The school LeBron James went to was St. Vincent Mary High School in Ohio. I liked the ending when Lebron James and his team won the championship. More than a Game was released on October 2nd in select theaters. I would rate this movie four stars because it is interesting for me to see LeBron play basketball as a teenager. I would recommend this flim to anyone who enjoys watching sports or NBA Basketball.

4013739,5,B002YMWQ2M,"More Than a Game is a sports documentary film that follows NBA superstar LeBron James and four of his teammates through the trials and tribulations of high school basketball in Akron, Ohio, and James's journey to fame. The film trailer was released in April featuring the single ""Stronger"" by Mary J. Blige, which she released in support of the film.

It is a documentary that focuses in on 5 young basketball players - LeBron James, Dru Joyce III, Romeo Travis, Sian Cotton, Willie McGee - and their coach, Dru Joyce II, performing on an AAU team with the growing stardom of the future NBA superstar, LeBron James. Taking them through their pre-teens to high school, the film follows their incredible journey as the unknown Ohio team rises to the top of youth athletics. The moral really suggests that to win, a team has to fight until the end to achieve a goal, even if the challenge seems easy.

Director Kristopher Belman examines the way that bonds are formed and tested with this profile of four high school basketball players who formed a remarkable chemistry over the years, eventually going on to play for St. Vincent-St. Mary in Akron, OH -- with one of them realizing their common dream of becoming an NBA superstar. LeBron James was still in high school when Sports Illustrated dubbed him ""The Chosen One"" and all-eyes turned toward the St. Mary-St. Vincent team. But while most cameras focused on the court, only Belman managed to capture the remarkably personal exchanges that occurred in the locker room as the team prepared for their games and celebrated their victories. And while James may have been the breakout star of the group, Belman still takes the time to offer detailed profiles of diminutive shot-sinker Little Dru, stocky Sian, and wise-beyond-his-years Willie -- the other players who formed the so-called ""Fab Four."" The subsequent addition of Romeo Travis necessitated the expansion of their nickname to the ""Fab Five."" As the adversity rises and James enters into his senior year, he faces the resentment of outsiders who would attempt to capitalize on his talent, and endures pressures that most teenagers will never know.

Though the film may not delve as deep as some would prefer, More Than a Game is an inspiring documentary featuring likable youngsters, a positive message, and some exciting in-game footage",1418256000,,2345,4.961832061068702

Am I a local resident of Ohio or a fan of the Cavs? HELL NO
Have I followed the career of LBJ since 2001? YES I HAVE

I was not going to pick up this movie, at all, but something told me to see it. Yes, Im glad that I did....it is very well done. I first heard of LBJ back in 2001, and I never thought this guy would live up to the hype, but this movie covers the behind the scenes of the hype.

It is a story not of just Lebron but of all his friends and team-mates over a course of 4 yrs throughout high school. It shows the good the bad, the ups and downs...and the brotherly love that these 6 guys (Including coach Drew) had for each other from the time they hit 8th grade until 12th. What a good story. Its not the best documentary on hoops that I have seen (that would be Hoop Dreams) but it is very well done! I was impressed, and it really doesn't leave a whole lot out.

I do wish this movie would have shown a lot more games, or released a special edition that had some of his full games...but overall it is a great buy. You don't have to like Lebron to enjoy this film, cause this film is about more than just Lebron, its about life, love, team work, hard work, and 5 brothers. Enjoy, I give it 4 stars....the soundtrack is even pretty good as well!",1377820800,3,1316,3.9213483146067416

I give credit to the filmmakers who do a nice job of focusing on the 4 or 5 friends as a group rather than taking the easy way out and just focusing on James and his career.  At the same time I was a bit disappointed that everyone else on the team was not ever in the picture, even if clearly they contributed to the success of the team.  It would have been interesting to see how the 5 black stars of the team adjusted to the nearly all white Catholic high school they attended.  This was never addressed or even hinted at.  Still, the film is very interesting and probably better than any Hollywood drama that may come down the road in the future.  In the end, the primary hero seems to be the coach who dealt with all the issues.",1334534400,,885,4.238095238095238

I wound up watching this film because it received excellent reviews and my students are always talking about Lebron James, so I took it as an excellent opportunity to learn more about this young man at the center of all the hype.  Having watched the dvd, I am just amazed at not only the skill and athleticism displayed by Mr. James, but the caliber of the character demonstrated by him, his teammates and his coaches.  This is more than a basketball documentary , it's a life-lesson documentary that provides the added bonus of amazing footage of someone whose skills as a youngster clearly out-ranked many who play the sport professionally (to say the least, Mr. James is clearly most worthy of the praise heaped upon him).  If you have kids, get More than a Game and use it as a sounding board for honest discussions with your kids.  If you just love sports, get it because the footage is spectacular.",1275004800,16,1014,4.549450549450549

It's nice to learn more about Lebron James, but this isn't the Lebron James Story; it's about friendship, family, faith, teamwork, and sacrifice. It's about a group of inner city kids who play basketball, but it doesn't rely on sex, drugs, gangs, murder, or even profanity. It's just great storytelling, without embellishment or added ""spice.""

I coach tennis at an exclusive private school in California and I'm actually going to show this movie to my girls. Even though the settings are worlds apart, the movie's message is universal and I know my players will love the story and they'll learn from it. Meanwhile, More Than A Game has shown me how to be a better coach, and I'll have an excuse to watch it again, too.

The highlight and pivotal point of this film, ""More Than A Game,"" was when the team (St. Vincent-St. Mary) coach gave a serious speech to his young men and devout his faith in prayers (along with them) in a call to the Almighty Saviour.  Both messages developed a strength of character to the young men whose lives are expectedly in a vacuum filled with wild excitements (promiscuity, alcohol and more).  This to me was a turnaround for the young men.  Although it was the coach's last and final year to train them (in their last year of high school), Coach Dru Joyce and the team thought they would win the championship.  They didn't!  BUT, because of their hardwork, faith, character (thanks to Coach Dru Joyce), friendship and love, these young men pulled it off and TODAY we still see the excitement some of them display.  What an incredible film.  I'm happy to have attain it as a gift; a gift my son will (and has said) will treasure forever.  He's inspired by this great documentary.  Great work!

4013827,5,B002YMWQ2M,"A huge Cavaliers fan, I saw this film to learn more about LeBron James.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that this touching documentary is less about him, than about a group of close childhood friends that developed into a hugely successful high school basketball team due in large part to their fondness and respect for each other, as well as the dedication of a caring coach.

Not only did I thoroughly enjoy the movie (with eyes tearing up over the boys' triumphs and defeats), I also gained some unexpected insight into why ""my Cavs"" are currently the most successful team in the NBA - the players' camaraderie off the court and unselfishness on the court make them a team in the truest sense of the word.

4013832,3,B002YMWQ2M,"i liked this movie. it is entertaining. the main thrust of the movie is footage that demonstrates that lebron was a human highlight reel in high school. emphasis is also placed on the fact that he and his teammates were very close, having played together since their childhoods. lebron's father was not around and many of his friends came from broken families. his coaches and friends were his stable family. i'm very happy that the kids were successful but kids definitely pay a price when constant competition takes away from other important developmental experiences. the father's overbearing coaching style: insisting that his son be perfect really seemed to border on sadism but i understand that this is a byproduct of fierce competitive activities. i'm glad lebtron has become wealthy playing basketball. i hope that he has the wisdom and insight to use his  wealth and influence to have a positive effect on the struggling black community. i hope black children understand that there are much better role models for them. you really wonder whether athletic super-stars understand that much of the source of their greatness comes from the one who gave them size and strength. i worry that many athletes fall into the trap of worshiping the work of their own hands. the coach said at one point in the movie that he realized that he was failing to teach his players character. nevertheless there isn't any evidence that he did this. just because they won a national high school title isn't evidence that they were shown the big picture and were given time to reflect on more important values that would help them be successful and fulfilled in the real world outside of the gym.",1267833600,3,1683,4.884615384615385

4013834,5,B002YMWQ2M,Awesome documentary on arguably one of the best high school b-ball teams ever.  It was cool seeing Lebron James as a youngster as well as the other players.  Great video for any b-ball fan.,1267488000,,189,4.529411764705882
4013835,5,B002YMWQ2M,"Very good story about 4 kids from different backgrounds growing up together in Akron, Ohio and how basketball brought them together and taught them about teamwork and about values.  Even though the hype is about Lebron James, this story is as much about the others as about him (although there are some great basketball scenes).

The movie really lets you know what is in the kids, the coaches and the fans minds and it puts them together well.  After the end of the movie you realize the roles all the people
played in making a champion.

Being an avid basketball fan and following Lebron James though his high school career, I found it entertaining but I think my wife liked the movie even more than I did and she's never watched a basketball game in her life.",1265241600,2,762,4.54014598540146
