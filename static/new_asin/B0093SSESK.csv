8535384,3,B0093SSESK,"Paul Henreid will always be best known for playing the third wheel in CASABLANCA and for simultaneously lighting up those two cigarettes in NOW, VOYAGER. But in the back end of his acting career, when he struggled to find good work - maybe because he'd been blacklisted as a ""Communist sympathiser"" by the House Committee of Un-American Activities - he launched into a series of B-movie swashbucklers. I don't know if Henreid welcomed such a change-of-pace or if it was just something he had to do to not fall into obscurity, but I find myself liking him better when he's not playing a martyr or a dramatic stick in the mud. In Columbia Pictures' SIREN OF BAGDAD (1953), he's very much far from being both of those things.

Is it ever cool to quote oneself? I'll do it anyway. A quote from stuff I said about a tongue-in-cheek swashbuckler titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Thousand-and-One-Nights-1945/dp/B001OB5EWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Thousand and One Nights (1945)</a>: ""Someday, there'll be an Arabian Nights movie in which the Grand Wazir is this benevolent soul, but that's not this movie."" SIREN OF BAGDAD paints a familiar picture. In an ancient, mythical Arabian backdrop, the Grand Wazir Soradin (George Keymas) is the schemer behind the throne, pulling the strings of the randy, dim-witted Sultan El Malid (Charlie Lung). But they're both about to get their comeuppance.

Kazah the Great (Henreid) performs in a traveling magic act that tours the hot spots of the Arabian desert. And he would've steered clear of the despot and his puppeteer. But what's a stand-up guy to do when his troupe of beautiful belly dancers is abducted by bandits and sold to slavery? Kazah the Great, wielding his arsenal of magic tricks, goes off in pursuit. Except that he ends up rubbing elbows with Bagdad's deposed rightful sultan  (Michael Fox) and his fiery, mud-faced daughter Zendi (Patricia Medina). Kazah teases her: ""Has the sultan confiscated all the soap, too?"" But, of course, Zendi was only packing dirt on her mug to disguise herself. Now, can Kazah the Great help the usurped sultan regain his throne? And, more importantly, can he get his dancing girls back? And when Kazah falls for Princess Zendi, do those goals suddenly reverse in priority?

Henreid is properly dashing and droll, and there's even the suggestion of a twinkle in his eye. When it's time to swing into action he comports himself decently, although the routine fight choreography won't get your pulse racing. Henreid and Patricia Medina generate low-key chemistry, something they replicate in their 1955 reteaming, PIRATES OF TRIPOLI, another swashbuckler in which Medina again plays a deposed princess.

SIREN OF BAGDAD tries to balance the Arabian intrigue with some laughs and giggles, except the genuine real laughs come few and far between. The best comic bit is orchestrated by Henreid himself, as he sends up that immortal scene from NOW, VOYAGER. Here, he simultaneously lights up two hookahs and makes me grin. You may (or may not) get the giggles when comic sidekick Hans Conreid (as ""Ben Ali"") has his character momentarily transformed into a luscious harem girl, only with Conreid's voice. I wasn't into Phil Silvers' tired anachronistic one-liners in A THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS. I wasn't digging Hans Conreid's act, as well. I don't think wisecracks like ""I beg your pardon. I realize they haven't been invented yet, but have you got a match?"" are all that funny. But that's me. If you like your sand-and-sandal adventure to be this campy and riddled with dated gags, then SIREN OF BAGDAD should be a hoot for you. Medina is lovely. The sets are colorful. Henreid makes a decent hero and frames his magic acts with fun vaudevilian fanfare. His vanishing chest is ubiquitous. I guess it's better than sand in your shorts.
