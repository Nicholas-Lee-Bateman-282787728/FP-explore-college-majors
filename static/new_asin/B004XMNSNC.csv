4496547,5,B004XMNSNC,"Is there any other profession that is more underappreciated and undercompensated and yet more invaluable than the teaching profession? I love movies about teachers, love the uplifting elements inherent in them. BEYOND THE BLACKBOARD aired on the Hallmark Channel and rooted me to my couch. And when the film was done, I went and bought the book on which it was based,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nobody-Don-t-Love-Nobody-Lessons-on-Love-from-the-School-With-No-Name/dp/1882723104/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nobody Don't Love Nobody: Lessons on Love from the School With No Name</a>, written by Stacey Bess. The book and the film recount Stacey's extraordinary first teaching assignment.

I don't remember the film covering this, but Stacey Bess was a bride at 16, a cancer survivor before she was 30. So she's been thru stuff. BEYOND THE BLACKBOARD opens with a flashback sequence that gives the viewer background material on Stacey Bess' childhood. We learn that, as a child of a tumultuous household, Stacey came to regard school as her haven. She dreamt of pursuing a career in education, except that an unexpected pregnancy at 16 took her on a detour.

Cut to the present - the year 1987, Salt Lake City - as a 24-year-old Stacey (Emily VanCamp) interviews for a teaching position. She speaks of having earned her GED, attending college, and completing her degree. Imagine her excitement when she lands a teaching assignment in the school district's homeless children initiative. Now imagine the panic and dismay when she arrives at her new post - a ""classroom"" in a community homeless shelter - and takes in the squalor and the reek of desperation all around her. You can't blame her for being repulsed. But she stays.

A 1995 L.A. Times article describes the classroom - dubbed the ""School With No Name"" - as a ""metal Quonset hut under a freeway viaduct."" The film informs us that the classroom is run-down and rat-infested and without textbooks or other school supplies. Stacey Bess, in those early days, had no support from the school board. Her efforts to procure funding and supplies were stymied at each turn by the school district's very bureaucratic HR facilitator (Timothy Busfield). She was still some time away from meeting the kindly district superintendant Dr. Warren (Treat Williams) who would step in and champion her cause. The inexperienced teacher was forced to make do for herself.

It never fails that a story about a good teacher would move me. Sure, this is a Hallmark picture, and, certainly, what we get is the more sanitized version of the story. For one thing, the homeless students aren't as unruly and disruptive as they probably had been in real life. But the kid actors deliver some very good performances, and specially Liam McKanna as the cowboy hat-wearing class leader ""Danny"" and Paola Nicole Andino as the sweet scholar ""Maria."" Emily VanCamp is fine as Stacey and at her best when making those connections with her pupils. I find it extremely touching that these homeless kids, who had nothing, still repaid their teacher with things that are more precious than any lavish gift: their trust and their love and lots of Valentine cards.

One quibble: I wish that more focus were on her husband, Greg (Steve Talley), who seems to be the person to have positively impacted her above all others. As it is, he comes off as a saint which, to me, is bland and, worse than bland, one-dimensional.

If you get a chance, see this movie and read the book. It packs an emotional punch; it's definitely got a bittersweet edge. But, in the end, it reaffirms to the jaded soul that there's still compassion out there, and quiet strength and selfless dedication. And that, to achieve something extraordinary, sometimes all it takes is a kind heart and a willing mind. And maybe Treat Williams.",1369094400,11,3865,5.117274167987322
