8241124,1,B00119ULY4,"Okay, first the positive: The video footage was semi-professional and the video editing was very professional. The planes were beautiful and some of the interviews were interesting. Now for the reality check: The music editing was pathetic, it was mixed so loud that it overwhelmed the footage. To make matters worse,the song selections really stunk and did not add to the footage, in fact it detracted from it. The only way I can explain this is that in the 70's and early 80's there were documentaries and sales pitch videos that were designed to add excitement to the viewer, this type of music was used for this and it just didn't work. Here's an analogy: A John Phillips Sousa March used as the title track to the movie Men In Black. Both are great, but not together. The DVD was also not long enough, they spent way too much time interviewing individual pilots (way too long on each one), I would have much preferred to have more footage of the planes on the flight line. There was a broad shot of all the planes on the flight line but you didn't get to see anything for about 80% of them which is a disappointment. Better luck next time. Don't spend over $5-$10 for this or you will be disapppointed.",1222214400,,1207,4.5159817351598175
