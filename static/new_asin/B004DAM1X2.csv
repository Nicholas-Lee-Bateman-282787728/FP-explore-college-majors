The listing for this did not indicate what it was rated, so I thought I was buying what I had seen, bu this is not what I saw in the theater, so I will give this version a 1 star review.  It could be so much better.",1512172800,,368,3.6
8425061,4,B004DAM1X2,"A very underrated movie. Janet Lynn is superb as Carol as is Robin Askwith as her boyfriend. Janet unfortunately didn't make too many movies and this was her only starring role, she also had a small role in the Lesley-Anne Down movie ' Assault'. Relive the 60's or just take a look back at how things used to be in England whatever you reason for watching this movie, it really is a must watch movie. HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!!!",1218153600,4,423,4.5064935064935066
