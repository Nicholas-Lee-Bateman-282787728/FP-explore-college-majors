8123398,5,B000FIMG5O,"My 2 year old daughter is obsessed with Winnie the Pooh so we are always on the look out for more movies to add to our collection.  Wonderful Word Adventure has a cute storyline and a nice moral lesson at the end, but isn't exactly what I expected it would be about based on the title.  My impression (based on the title) was that the movie would be teaching basic word recognition, but instead it focuses on opposites.  I didn't read the synopsis at all so that fact may have been clear to me if I had, but I feel like once again a Learning Adventures title is misleading (the Pooh ABC's movie focused on rhyming more than the alphabet).  Overall, the educational content being a bit too advanced for my daughter doesn't damper her enjoyment of the movie at all since her real interest is just in seeing Pooh and his friends go on an adventure.",1405382400,4,845,4.3630573248407645
