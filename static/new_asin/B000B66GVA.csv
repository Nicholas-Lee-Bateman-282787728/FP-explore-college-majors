2402532,1,B000B66GVA,"This is not a Christian movie. Profanity and sexual theme are the climax of this movie.  Please be forewarned again.  Do not consider buying this movie. This movie certainly does not promote what it claims to promote; purity, holiness and reverance for God's house.  Instead, it promotes profanity, debauchery, adultery, fratenization between pastor and member of the opposite sex.  I was highly disappointed when I brought the video home.  My daughter stated we should donate it.  I told her that I would not dare share this film with someone else. Instead, it went into the trash",1153440000,13,581,5.0
2402533,1,B000B66GVA,"A co-worker loaned this movie to me to watch over the weekend.  She thought it would be a movie that would be enjoyable with a supposedly Christian theme.  After only a few minutes into the movie I turned it off.  There was very strong language.  The language was inappropriate for the theme of the movie.  The production was very low budget.  The volume was hard to regulate.  If I could have, I would have given this movie no star.",1150675200,13,433,4.405063291139241
2402534,2,B000B66GVA,"i expected this movie to be a bit better&it had some moments. it was about a Preacher helping people out dealing with all kinds of situations. the movie lasts a bit too long,but there are some funny moments that bring it back,but it's just aight in the end. this film is like a Low Budget Tyler Perry film in alot of ways,but it's aight.",1146355200,8,337,4.28125
8082138,1,B000B66GVA,Very disappointed in this movie. I wanted a Christian movie. I can't believe this was conceded religious with all the foul language. I wouldn't recommend this movie to any one trying to further their relationship with God,1524182400,,221,5.0
8082139,4,B000B66GVA,This shouldn't be considered a Christian movie. The language was very foul and sexually explicit. Other than that I like the movie and loved the end. It was refreshing to see a good hearted pastor who really was committed to the word of God.,1513296000,,241,4.5
8082140,1,B000B66GVA,Please don't write any more movies about marriage!! The cussing was ridiculous. The acting was poor and full of stereotypes. A flamboyant chior director and EXTRA loud background music. I was completely done.,1510531200,3,208,5.333333333333333
8082141,1,B000B66GVA,"Use of the ""F"" word and  ""sh.."" in the beginning of the movie. This isn't a movie made with Christian values.  It's a world's view of christian churches from the non-believer's eyes.",1505174400,3,182,4.65625
8082142,5,B000B66GVA,I have not watched this movie yet. I bought it for my church's celebrate recovery program which we have movie the last Tuesday every other month. I was package well and everything looks good,1362441600,,190,4.617647058823529
8082143,5,B000B66GVA,"I really enjoyed the movie, even if its low budget as many would say, it has many messages that speaks to me. The movie uses real problems and issues not everything gonna be sugar coated. Its showing you that God can accept you and change you if you let him in da mist of your stuggles and behavior ways thats not christ like. not every body has the perfect speech, background and structure. Every body has strong holds. no, you may not let kids watch it but as adults we can look pass it cause it has a deeper meaning.",1358985600,3,519,4.2
8082144,1,B000B66GVA,This movie was a waist of my money.  How is a gospel movie going to have that much strong sex and strong cursing.  This is for sure not for kids.  I was really disappointed.  It almost made me mad.  It could have been the same movie and point with out the cursing and sexual content that it had.  It is for sure not for young people and new christian.  As a child of God I believe in holiness.  There is alot of point I can disagree with in this movie and Im sorry I ever got it.,1245196800,3,479,3.865979381443299
8082145,5,B000B66GVA,I really liked this movie. It shows how god and with the help of the pastor things can change in life. I would recommend anyone to see it and in my opinion the best part of the movie was the end...,1203206400,2,197,3.8292682926829267
8082146,4,B000B66GVA,"I bought this dvd and I thought it was wonderful.  Although the pastor knew he was taking a chance letting her stay with him, he was a man of god who kept his place and never once tried to disrespect her.  I really enjoyed the ending when her husband came to the lord and they got back together.",1193788800,3,295,4.068965517241379
8082147,5,B000B66GVA,"This movie was great.  It showed forgiveness, and patience.  Great one to see if you like religious movies.",1153785600,7,107,4.888888888888889
