8081050,4,B000AYWNX8,"I LIKE IT. THE PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY WAS GREAT FOR HOME MADE DVD. THE ONLY THING I HATE IS THE HEADBANGER MUSIC THEY USE TO ANOY ME. BUT I AM OLD, OVER 45. EASY RIDER, NOW THAT WAS A GREAT SOUNDTRACK! IF YOU LIKE THE MUSIC,YOU WILL LOVE IT! CLOSE TO 3 HOURS LONG! I EVEN BOUGHT THE SECOND ONE. WHICH IS ALSO GREAT! DISPITE MY DISLIKE FOR THIS KIND OF MUSIC! THEY DID A VERY GOOD JOB! I LIKE IT TOO! GREAT FOR BIKERS OF ANY AGE!",1192406400,,431,3.853932584269663

8081052,1,B000AYWNX8,"It is a little difficult to rate because I have not received it yet. There are many products I have not received  but have paid for them as Choppertown dvd also. Please contact me because I have stopped to buy due to poor delivery. I think it is outrageous that Amazon.com can not deliver products!!!!! See for your selves; purchased Aug. 2006! It is not to believe. I have sent you e-mail about this before, still no answer???

8081053,5,B000AYWNX8,"FINALLY! A DVD that gets at the heart of the chopper scene. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of the discovery shows, but that's not the world I live in. This is all about choppers for and by the working man. This is the real deal! Great music and bonus videos, too! I've watched this DVD 10 times already and have only had it for 3 days!",1126483200,7,334,3.926470588235294
