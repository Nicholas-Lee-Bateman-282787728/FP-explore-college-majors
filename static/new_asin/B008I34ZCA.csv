8528388,5,B008I34ZCA,If you are a big fan of classic horror/creature features then you will love these movies. The ending of Rats: Night of Terror is famous or infamous depending on your perspective. Rats is a great post apocalyptic horror film even if some of the humans seem to be bereft of brains. In an old lab a group of waste land survivors decide to stay for the night and become the victim of a horde or rats. Venom is a silly movie and the weaker title but it is still a fun watch. In Venom crime doesn't pay if a venomous snake happens to be around to foil your criminal plans.,1471564800,,566,4.154545454545454
8528389,4,B008I34ZCA,"While the Venom movie is pretty weak, the Rats one is over the top funny and scary and weird all at the same time, especially if you don't like rats (or guinea pigs pretending to be rats).  Decent special features too with an amusing interview with the Rats director.  Overall, pretty decent DVD for the coin.",1464652800,,309,4.5
