4892626,3,B005TTEFUI,"This DVD would be appealing to anyone who likes basketball, likes the Harlem Renaissance, or likes African American history.  The only thing I found unenjoyable about it pertained to the artwork.  I didn't like the cartoonish figures with the bobbing heads.  However, that's a fairly minor criticism.",1334361600,,300,5.340425531914893
4892627,5,B005TTEFUI,"I found this movie to be very entertaining, but more importantly educational.  Kareem did and outstanding job with the story line utilizing interviews, still photos, film footage and of course the musical score.  The movie is well worth the watch If your a fan of basketball or just a fan of history.",1329955200,,300,4.75
4892628,5,B005TTEFUI,"Wow!  The entire family was spellbound by the story and the entertaining way it is told.  Kareem is brilliant to share this.  A great film to watch again and again!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kareem-Abdul-Jabbar-Presents-On-The-Shoulders-Of-Giants/dp/B005TTEFUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Presents: On The Shoulders Of Giants</a>",1329177600,,391,8.725
4892629,5,B005TTEFUI,"Immediately you are enveloped into this basketball world of years gone by. Kareem does a wonderful job of weaving the sweet sounds of jazz and great historical elements in to an epic tail of the best basketball team you never heard of.

This is a must have for the true basketball fan!",1329091200,,285,4.480769230769231
4892630,5,B005TTEFUI,"This was truly a great film.  The story is so compelling and the music was great.  I shared it with my kids who are basketball fanatics, so they would know about this important time in the history of the game.  We all just loved it",1329004800,,231,4.088888888888889
4892631,5,B005TTEFUI,"We thoroughly enjoyed watching this documentary about the amazing accomplishments and historical significance of The Harlem Rems. I suspect that too few New Yorkers are aware that the Renaissance team were the world champions.  The fact that they actually beat the more commonly known Globe Trotters, in addition to every other team in a then segregated league must have presented challenges that modern day teams would likely struggle to appreciate in our highly televised, highly advertised and highly compensated 21st Century league. Kudos to Kareem Abdul Jabbar and the numerous other participants in their efforts to bring such a highly informative and quality production to television, particularly during Black History Month.",1329004800,2,732,5.594594594594595
4892632,5,B005TTEFUI,The movie was inspiring.  I am 69yrs old and never knew there was a black professional basketball team.  Our country is now diverse. I first was the movie on Netflix and enjoyed the movie.,1375488000,,188,4.5

4892635,5,B005TTEFUI,Wonderful story about a basketball that I knew nothing about. This would be great for anyone who is interested in basketball.,1370476800,,125,5.0
4892636,5,B005TTEFUI,"A marvelous documentary, even if you are not a sport enthusiast.  The story of the Harlem Rennaisance Negro Basketball team is an under shared historical event in this nations evolution.  I really liked that some of the original team players were able to share their experiences.  Kareem Abdul Jabbar absolutely deserves high praise for bridging the gap between today's basketball greats and the evolution of Basketball from the time of the Harlem Rennaisance.  Who knew that the ever popular Harlem Globetrotters were not from Harlem,but from Chicago Illinois?  This documentary also interweaves some great jazz music from the 1930s Harlem Rennaisance period.  Bravo!",1365897600,,668,5.436893203883495
4892637,5,B005TTEFUI,"Not only a great story on the origins of blacks in basketball, but a great historical lesson as well. It's great how they mixed the old school with new school and had commentary from current ball players.",1363737600,2,204,4.54054054054054

4892639,5,B005TTEFUI,Great history of the greatest team I never heard of and I follow basketball. I saw the origianl story on HBO and had to own my own copy. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar did a great job.,1356998400,,173,4.117647058823529
4892640,5,B005TTEFUI,DVD arrived in time as the perfect Christmas gift to my 11 year old twin god grandsons.  This piece is creative and compelling.  Mr. Abdul-Jabbar's presentation of this obscure slice of history is thoroughly engaging for any age.,1355875200,,229,5.0
4892641,5,B005TTEFUI,"This DVD should be a must see for every NBA player! We often forget the people who paved the way for one of the world's most entertaining sports, professional basketball. It's hard to believe that a group of people were not allowed to compete in the NBA because of their race.  This DVD tells the story of some of these men and their struggle to participate in the Association. The DVD does not ""preach"", it lets the events tell the story.  Totally enjoyable.  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar does a magnificant job as story teller and narrator.",1350086400,2,533,4.648936170212766

8486545,5,B005TTEFUI,"As someone who was born and raised in NYC (and continues to have a love affair with all things related to NY sports), I loved watching this documentary.  I was particularly taken with the historical aspects.  As a side note, prior to my departure from NYC, I actually worked with Mr. John Isaacs (who is prominently featured in this documentary) at the Madison Square Boys & Girls Club in the Bronx.  He had a quiet calm about him that had many vying for his time and attention as he recounted stories of the Rens.  While it has been more than fifteen years since last I visited that Boys & Girls Club, I'm certain that his presence was felt and will always be missed...",1409184000,,670,4.4227642276422765
8486546,4,B005TTEFUI,I purchased this movie for viewing with my high school students. I think that it may be a bit too academic for them.,1405296000,,116,4.086956521739131
8486547,5,B005TTEFUI,"I just saw this documentary on the tv and it really was excellent. Not only is the story a fascinating and important one, but visually it also was really well done. Colorful,with creative use of animation, and an excellent soundtrack. The interviews with current and past basketball stars were both informative and humorous. The segment at the very beginning that included  Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Bill Russell, and Jerry West had me laughing out loud. Russell was so funny. Now I know about the Rens, a black basketball team I had never heard fo yesterday. This should be shown in schools as it teaches history in an entertaining fashion. hats off to Kareem for a job well done!!",1392163200,,677,4.786324786324786
8486548,5,B005TTEFUI,This DVD  has become part of Black History Month. It has shown the that a lot of our students donot know about Black History .,1391817600,,126,4.04
