8598117,5,B00DV1MUS0,"This DVD has amazing sights and views!  The climb was very tough, but rewarding and the music was a good match to the scenery.  It was nice to ""get away"" with this adventure and follow the lead of the coaches rather than trying to motivate myself!

Great Ride!",1385510400,,260,4.375
8598118,5,B00DV1MUS0,If you're looking for a tough spin workout this one is it.  I've have done other tough ones but really enjoy Gene's and crew.  He makes you feel like you are part of the ride.,1376611200,,175,3.9714285714285715
