252266,4,6300216497,I also think this is a very good movie... I'd like to give an extra special mention to the audio visual experience that is the psychometric test which Beatty undergoes. It is an example of wonderful film-making - still images and text being manipulated by a great director - perfectly pitched with the soundtrack. A must-see for students of Film and Graphic Design because it reminds people that low-tech film making in the hands of someone with an idea can be more effective that a mega budget piece of rubbish - it could be seen as a brilliant technique to exploit storytelling on the net while we still have to put up with low band width streaming. ...,969926400,5,655,4.559322033898305

252268,5,6300216497,"This film is one of my personal favourites so I had to have it when I saw it was available on DVD. For those of you who are put off by political thrillers and their plethora of names that you can't attach to faces, then  don't be, this isn't what ""The Parallax View"" is all about. The  message of this film isn't who done it and why, but simply that they CAN  and WILL. Criticism of Warren Beatty's acting is a little harsh, he just  plays Warren Beatty. That's because he's a film star first and an actor  second (don't knock it, plenty of people have got away with it over the  years). A fine supporting cast help make the implausible story believable  and the sparse music score adds tension at just the right moments.  Certainly the late director's best film in my opinion (I always find  ""All the Presidents Men"" just a little too wordy). The anamorphic  2.35 to 1 picture on the DVD is excellent, but I would agree that the  soundtrack varies between barely audible and ear shattering. No commentary  or making of documentary but I still give this DVD 10 out of 10.",957398400,5,1071,4.380710659898477
252269,5,6300216497,"The Parallax View (1974) came out before Hollywood began to produce slicker, more over-rated political thrillers. In this film, a senator is shot and killed but no one saw the killer. Warren Beatty plays a journalist  who goes undercover to find out who killed the senator and a number of  other witnesses to the crime. Pakula's directing is excellent with many  memorable scenes. This was a different role for Beatty and he does well in  a political thriller. The story is interesting and original with a thought  provoking ending.

252270,4,6300216497,"Although a little dated and visually uneven in certain parts of the film, ""The Parallax View"" is solid thriller that trys to blend mind control and assassination ala ""The Manchurian Candidate"" (the later being a far  superior film).  Beatty is fine as the reporter trying to untangle the web  of political assassinations and corporate subterfuge.  Beatty is supported  by a solid cast and a tight script.  This film gets the viewer involved  immediately and never lets go, and for most people, the ending will be a  surprise.  This taught thriller is well worth the rental or purchase price.  Between 1 and 10, ""The Parallax View"" gets a very solid 8.
For those who  think this is Beatty's only good film, or those who think Beatty can't act,  obviously haven't seen Robert Altman's mesmerizing ""McCabe & Mrs.  Miller"", one of the finest, most richly textured films of the era.",930614400,2,877,4.844594594594595

I've always been a fan of the conspiracy movies made in this era (Marathon Man, Three Days of the Condor, The Conversation among the best) and The Parallax View does not disappoint.  While the scene where Beatty pays for a plane ticket while actually seated on the plane certainly reflects a different time, the race to determine the source of the conspiracy and underlying tension of the scenes is palpable.  A young Beatty without all the mannerisms of his future self carries the film with a strong supporting cast including Hume Cronyn.

252330,4,6300216497,"This was quite a good film for its time (1974) dealing with political assassinations and the conspiracies that led to them.

The nature of the film helps me to realize how aware people were even in that time, that the Warren Commission (of the JFK assassination) was a complete fraud and that politicians daring to challenge the power structure in any way/shape/form were dealt with harshly... and publicly.

The film is overall structured very effectively. The writing and dialogue are slick and the pacing of the film is fast, so you can't miss a second of it and hope to understand later scenes. I suppose Beatty was some casting director's idea of an attractive lead male, as he certainly wasn't chosen for his dramatic abilities. Beatty's character is a troubled, yet aggressive investigative reporter whose friend is a witness to the assassination of a US senator at the beginning of the film. We become a bit more familiar with this friend when she approaches Beatty in desperation and we find out that six close bystanders to the killing have also been killed/died suspiciously within months of each other.

From this point, Beatty's character engages in a somewhat reckless investigative odyssey which is -- for the most part -- believable since he doesn't have a whole lot to lose in the first place. There are a few far-fetched close calls, but these are forgivable when (about 3/4 through the film) an added side-plot is revealed having to do with the shadowy Parallax Corporation and their interest in Beatty himself. This was a shift I was not expecting and I found it to be quite brilliant on the part of the writers of the film and original book.",1467590400,,1662,4.804195804195804

252332,4,6300216497,"This slow-moving but intense, stylish, visually sumptuous political thriller directed by Alan Pakula (best known for Klute, All the Presients Men, and and Sophie's Choice) somehow combines a preternatural clarity with a misty dissonance: it's like someone shattered the 1960s political assassinations and jumbled them together into a dream. Warren Beatty is great as the callow but dedicated reporter whose curiosity gets him in waters farther over his head (on some occasions literally) than he could have imagined. Several of the film's aspects are, and are probably intended to be, reminiscent of Hitchcock: the way things and people are not as they seem, and a final explosion of menace in the cheerful public environment of a political rally. One of the key films in the political conspiracy theory genre. The Paramount standard DVD is of good quality, but this film really should be remastered and put on Blu-Ray.",1464912000,,919,5.216216216216216

This film grabs you right from the beginning and doesn't let up.  Great ending too.  The only part that is out of date is the airplane scene.

Back in the denial era when The Parallax View was made, the general public wasn't as jaded and cynical as they are now, so the movie tried to make this one point - that there are shady players and patsies and manipulation going on - but stretches it out WAY too long and WAY too thinly.

The film covers a journalist who is determined to learn about a mysterious corporation which seems to appear and disappear just as political events are occurring.  To penetrate the company, he joins the company as a potential 'operator' for them.  From there, the paranoia ensues.  He must take a psychological test, which is one of the most intense and penetrating series of images conceivable, both Freudian and powerful.  After that, his loyalty is tested...through it all, you start to suspect that he hasn't fooled anyone and is going to be used instead by that mysterious corporation.
At the end, we all get an education.  Whether, as with the film 'JFK', it's a revelation or only an illusion is beyond the scope of this brief piece.

252633,3,6300216497,"""The Parallax View"" is a low-key thriller from 1974, based on the novel by Loren Singer and directed by Alan J. Pakula, in the mold of paranoid political thrillers of the era. Senator Charles Carroll (Bill Joyce) is assassinated by a gun-toting waiter at an Independence Day celebration in Seattle, as his aid Austin Tucker (William Daniels) and a bevy of reporters look on in horror. One of those reporters is Joe Frady (Warren Beatty), a recovering alcoholic often in hot water with editor Bill Rintels (Hume Cronyn) for his maverick methodology and short temper. Weeks later, fellow journalist and former lover Lee Carter (Paula Prentiss) shows up on Joe's doorstep begging for his help. Six of the 18 people who witnessed Sen. Carroll's murder have died accidental deaths, and Lee is afraid for her life. Joe doesn't take her seriously at first, but evidence of a murderous conspiracy is piling up, and it seems to have something to do with a mysterious Parallax Corporation.

Generally, ""The Parallax View"" is long and boring. I was impressed by the initial assassination scene, which is presented more realistically and less frenetically than it would be today. It's effective. Beatty is good in the role of the casually chic, misfit-rebel, crusading journalist, in the mold of all post-Watergate crusading journalists. It's too bad he didn't have a better script. There is an awful lot of filler making the film longer and more ponderous than a fluff thriller has any right to be. The conspiracy is not convincing nor interesting in the least. It is interesting, though, that a for-profit corporation is the villain, while the government seems simply ignorant and impotent, comprised mainly of pawns whom more savvy parties either manipulate or murder. I associate the 1970s with anti-government sentiment more than anti-business. Chalk it up to 1970s malaise, I suppose, which also explains this film's profound pessimism. The DVD (Paramount 1999) offers optional French dubbing and a theatrical trailer.",1402617600,,2012,5.152905198776758
252634,1,6300216497,"Other reviewers have given details of the actual plot, so I'll stick only to my impressions. The first 10 minutes are set in Seattle at the Needle Tower, and are fantastic. After that, everything is downhill and keeps getting worse and worse. This is supposed to be a political thriller with lots of suspense, but the director fails to capitalize when something can be built up. Examples: (1) there is an airplane explosion at the airport, but the camera focuses on a cyclone fence and we viewers hear, but don't see, the explosion. (2) There are 2-3 instances where a character is going up an escalator, and, incredibly, the camera follows him from the bottom all the way to the top. THERE IS NOTHING HAPPENING BUT A MAN STANDING STILL ON THE ESCALATOR! (3) At another point a large hangar door is closing, and the camera follows the door from beginning to end! Isn't that exciting? (4) The newspaper where Beatty works consists of him and the manager---there's no one else there! No action, no movement. Pretty dull. Beatty gets into a fistfight. Ok, but what for? That was totally unrelated to the ""plot."" Even though this is a ""suspense"" movie, there really is NO suspense. The scene in a very large gym or meeting hall, where a political rally will take place later, was terribly done. The director overly depended on shadows and characters in almost total darkness to try to create suspense, but all it created was confusion, for we were never really sure who was what and who went where. Maybe that director uses that trick all the time because he doesn't know any better.  We don't really get to connect to the characters, so they can all die for all we care. As if all that were not bad enough, there was a section where Beatty is being shown photographs on a large screen, and we get to see the LONG sequence of essentially boring photos, over and over and over without a break.  Why? Because HE was being shown those photos! What a stupid directorial decision to have taken that step. This poorly-made movie is a total waste of time, and it puzzles me why some folks gave it high reviews. (They must be diehard Warren Beatty fans.) Watching paint dry might be more exciting than watching this terrible film. Skip it!",1402444800,6,2227,4.607052896725441

In an era where Blackwater has had a license to kill with impunity, US government agencies are guilty of systematic torture with no consequences, and the NSA is spying on everything we type online, it's almost quaint to see this movie from a more innocent time.

The script is not great, and Warren Beatty is not at his best, but the story is a curious period piece.

This movie came out at a time when Americans had gotten a wakeup call about their government and it's secret antics. The public was open to the idea that maybe things were not what they seemed. This movie feeds on that premise and does a fair job of it. But I found it to be rather slow.  Lots of long distance shots of  people and murky rooms. Long scenes of people walking up stairs and down hallways. I imagine all of it can be chalked up to a sense of style and camera work that was popular in the 1970's but it doesn't completely hold the modern viewer's attention. We are used to faster paced movies and more twists and turns than movies like this offer.

There are several standout sequences, but the ""Main Title"" music in the opening and end are especially chilling, with Michael taking a patriotic trumpet theme and twisting and turning it into dissonant moments that represent the twisting of values portrayed in the film.

Parallax View opens with a political assassination that is clearly inspired by Bobby Kennedy's. Beatty's character investigates and uncovers a shadowy company that trains assassins, and also creates patsies to be set up to take the blame.

252888,4,6300216497,"I've followed conspiracies ever since they began popping up in regard to the JFK assassination. Of the few Hollywood movies overtly dealing with the subject this might be the best of them.

Here's the scoop. Joe Frady (Warren Beatty) is a reporter for a Seattle Newspaper. He's had past with the bottle and his editor accuses him of making more news than he reports. He's on hand when an up-and-coming, liberal politician is assassinated. ""The official panel"" rules it the work of a lone nut assassin. Three years later a woman who was at the event contacts him with her fears that she's being targeted for death like six other people who were present at the assassination. He's not buying because she's had a troubled past. When she shows up dead he re-thinks things and launches an investigation of his own.

This is a heck of a movie with some smart writing. You start with a reporter that is predisposed toward this sort of thing, but his friend's claims are even too much for him. When she takes a dirt nap and he starts his own investigation, things proceed in a very logical, albeit paranoid, fashion. But his up-front work makes a lot of sense given where he thinks things might be headed. Then, when he runs into trouble first hand, he kicks things up to the next level in trying to find where the center of the assassination hive is. Beatty is his usual good self. Paula Prentiss (as the doomed friend) is good in a small role. Hume Cronyn is outstanding as Beatty's editor. Alan Pakula is the Academy Award winning director of ""All the President's Men"" which he made immediately after this. Both films are similar but this one is a lot more creepy because it gets the viewer to question the official line. It's shot well and has a good musical score. He also makes good use of the landscapes in the Pacific Northwest. Though not a flashy looking film, the images contain a lot of power.

This was obviously made in response to the Warren Report and the other 60s assassinations. It does a good job of cranking up the paranoia machine and examining the work of those trying to get to the bottom of the myriad conspiracies extant today. Some scenes, particularly the climax, are a bit heavy handed, and the final scene is no less so, but this is still right up there with the best movies ever made.",1374105600,,2307,4.540865384615385

If I'm not mistaken, it was released after or around the time Senator Frank Church (D-IA) was holding oversight hearings that began with the attempted cover-up of the Watergate break-in.  A short time later, the CIA would release the files they called ""The Family Jewels"": CIA activities from the 1950's until that time (mid-1970s).  Some of the highlights would have been Kermit Roosevelt's overthrown of Iran's democratically elected President Mossadegh and re-installation of the Pahlavi family, namely Shah Reza Pahlavi. The CIA also trained his secret police force, SAVAK.  Another early jewel would have been the overthrow of the Guatemala's democratically elected President, Jacobo Arbenz.  The had to lie to Eisenhower to convince him to give the CIA permission for these coups.  They told President Eisenhower that these leaders were communists - a political system Eisenhower vehemently opposed.

This film also took a poke at the Warren Commission.  There are brief scenes of men sitting behind a long wooden dais, like the Supreme Court, while the man in the center announces the committee's ""findings"".  Always a lone nut, always a distraught lone individual, etc.

The cast is good:  Paula Prentiss as the ""crazy ex-girlfriend""; Hume Cronyn as the crotchety old newspaper editor.

The set scenes scream to be admired for cinematography, but they are episodic and add little to the flow of the film -- they're superficial. Towards the end a gate is closing and it takes...frickin...forever...for...it...to...close.  Any astute viewer (who is still awake) would get the point in a few seconds.  Another problem is Beatty, an actor who always seems to be mugging, so you never really lose yourself in his character's dilemma.

On the plus side there are some great scenes in the Northwest, and the plot raises some interesting points about assassination theory in the USA -- even though these too are drawn out needlessly.  And there's that classic mind control sequence of images that manages to mash-up apple pie, Nixon, Nazis, gay boys, hippies, the Pope, druggies, and homeless people...and then repeat it several times in case you weren't impressed the first time.

Of course the ending makes it the somewhat powerful piece that it is, but in terms of excitement the film slows way down in its last 20 minutes.  People walking down hallways and hiding in the darkness seem to go on interminably.  Couldn't tell if it was nail-biting tension or boredom that had set in.  Other small flaws may be the occasional illogical strokes that give Frady (Beatty) entrance into the Parallax club of hired assassins. In a nutshell, it may not overly impress movie-goers richly fed on a modern movies diet, but fans of early 70s cinema and 70s political thrillers may find it worth watching.  A somewhat more exciting (though not necessarily more important) film of comparable genre and time vibe might be ""Black Sunday"".  The Parallax View is decent but not excellent in terms of entertainment value.  Message-wise however it could be comparable to literary classics such as 1984 for its warning value.  I think there were a lot of people who felt a particular distrust of the government (or the CIA) at the time Parallax was made (1974).",1301184000,2,1210,4.6745283018867925

Although I've seen a lot of political thrillers in the years since, this film stills holds its appeal, although -- naturally -- its impact is much less than it was back then.  It's decently plotted (although see below), well shot, and has Warren Beatty at the height of his stardom.  It's also kind of fun to see those '70s hairstyles, clothes, and cars.

Through the perspective of the years, I can now certainly see the film's flaws.  In the wake of the assassinations in the 1960s, the film had a certain resonance that, at least for me, disguised some of the implausibility of its plot. [BIG-TIME SPOILER ALERT] If you were a super-secret organization that had knocked off a Senator -- and presidential candidate -- would you call attention to the possibility of a conspiracy by knocking off all of the witnesses?  None of the witnesses -- with the possible exception of the William Daniels character -- seem to suspect that anything was amiss in the original investigation of the case, so why go to the enormous trouble and risk of bumping them off?  I suppose it's part of the ambience of the film that the goals and motives of the Parallax organization, or those who hire it, is never spelled out, but somehow I found that approach more unsatisfying this time around.  The ending remains quite a stunner.

All in all, a film that certainly deserves a DVD reissue with a commentary track or a ""making of"" feature.",1273276800,,1502,4.616541353383458
252949,5,6300216497,"I probably would have had more trouble with this movie had I not had my dad helping me through some of the finer plot points (was that really the same guy as before?).  This movie is a real test for the younger generation of today that have been saturated with action no-brainers such as 'Die Hard 4' and 'The Bourne Supremacy'.  Current movies tend to blow out of proportion what the average man is capable of and by presenting a contrary reality 'The Parallax View' shines.

'The Parallax View' is an older movie, 1974, that is obviously lacking in the hi-tech department.  The basic plot revolves around a reporter, Joe Frady, and his investigations into nefarious characters after an assassination of a senator.  Any director of a conspiracy movie of today would take a plot such as this and infuse it with high-action car chases, cool gadgets and a minimum of 3 near-death escapes by the protagonist.

Here we are treated instead with a slower and more realistically paced movie.  We follow Joe as his is presented with a reason to suspect certain people and how he goes about investigating them.  He simply acts like any normal person would and does not show any 'superman' abilities in the scraps he gets in.

As far as the plot goes, I actually had trouble following some things because everything wasn't labeled in exposition.  If Joe had to go somewhere he didn't shout his plans to the audience or a well-placed friend.  People went about their actions like normal people.

Visually 'The Parallax View' forces the viewer (or at least a viewer from my generation) to slow down and take in the scene.  The shots are long and expansive with very little music.  Even the objects are not embellished like the spy gadgets of today.  The movie didn't pretend to be some technically advanced version of the 70's.  What was seen in terms of clothes and habits was almost like something out of a documentary.

What does all this amount to you ask?  The movie is straight-forward.  There is not superman protagonist with his specialized gadgets.  You simply get a man trying to figure out what is going on.  I loved this movie but if you are the person who needs everything explained with high-action scenes than I suggest a different choice.",1261094400,9,2242,4.712082262210797

I imagine that when The Parallax View was released the post-Watergate sense of paranoia obscured the film's many flaws, but viewed today it's a boring thriller with a dull Beatty in the lead that's chockablock with plot holes and contrivances leading up to an ending that's supposed to be poignant but comes across as ludicrous; skip this dated thriller and watch The Manchurian Candidate instead.

Beatty plays a journalist who goes undercover, allowing himself to be recruited by the Parallax Corporation, presumably a CIA front that trains assassins.

Pakula is simply a lousy storyteller.  His sense of pacing is terrible--scenes go on for far too long, often while we don't really understand what is happening in them, and then cut abruptly to something new.  Parts of the film that are intended to be suspenseful register as dull and confusing.  This does have its compensations; Pakula and the great DP Gordon Willis create some striking visual compositions, Warren Beatty does a nice job with his underwritten role, and the famous brainwashing montage is terrific.  But the story is too incoherent to deliver the goods as a thriller, and the movie never recovers from Pakula's narrative indifference.",1208304000,11,811,5.1603053435114505
252995,5,6300216497,"From the moment reporter Frady (Beatty) decides to investigate, he's caught in an anonymous web whose only face is that of the sinister Jack Younger (McGinn). How far does the web extend-- we can only guess. For Frady, it stretches from a tiny hamlet in the Pacific Northwest to a soaring glass monolith somewhere in urban America.

Probably no film captures the paranoid unease of the years between the JFK assassination and the Nixon resignation better than this one. Apprehension flowed like a dark undercurrent throughout the land. Something had happened in Dallas, Memphis, and LA's Ambassador Hotel, but no one could be sure what. And every night on TV screens, were the gathering horrors of Vietnam. It was like the country had suddenly woken up to a different America, one whose destiny was no longer in familiar hands. You didn't have to be a liberal or an activist to feel a gnawing sense of dislocation.

Frady's complascent little world of ""third-rate"" journalism, is also interrupted the moment his jilted lover Lee Carter (Prentiss) is wheeled into the autopsy room, dead by her own forecast. From then on it's a Kafkaesque pursuit of diabolical forces only dimly perceived. Conversations become muted. We hear only tantalizing bits and pieces, such as the senator aboard the flight to Denver.

Note how often telling scenes are filmed elliptically, either through glass panes, gauzy curtains, or at a distance, all of which impart not only a conspiratorial air, but a sense of viewer powerlessness much the way larger national events had suddenly escaped public grasp. This is not a movie to look away from for even a moment. The story is conveyed as much by camera as by dialogue, as when editor Rintels' (Hume Cronyn) lock-box disappears in a flash. Note also the expert use of  silent intervals when characters such as Austin Tucker (William Daniels) simply stare off into space. Suddenly, events are thrown back on us to confront the tensions that have been mounting.

The sense of dislocation-- of things being not quite what they seem-- is pervasive, and is no better conveyed than in the justly celebrated test sequence. There stark images follow one another in rapid-fire succession like an on-rushing train. At first the images unfold logically after the title cards, pictures of mother, wife, etc. following upon the word ""Love"". But then the images begin to jumble-- love with hate, war with peace-- and the sense of normality begins to crumble, collapsing finally into a chaos of contradictions until a blond hero figure returns the associations to proper balance. Nonetheless, the world has been turned upside down, if only for a few moments, yet the impression of dislocation remains. It's a powerfully disturbing sequence.

The metaphor for what Frady faces lies in the massive slab of glass  from whose bowels tiny figures emerge. It's a blank wall devoid of any identity of its own. Try to see inside and only an outside image is cast back. It's a giant mirror. Thus the public ends up seeing nothing beyond a reflection of itself. Yet the power of the shrouded interior is as undeniable as that gushing force of nature loosed upon the channel beneath the Salmon Creek dam.

Beatty underplays throughout, at times barely registering at all. But that's how it should be, since the story carries the film. It's really McGinn as the sinister Jack Younger who makes the impression. His voice and manner convey just the right edge, a subtle hint of concealed networks lurking in the background. The movie really turns on his performance, and he brings it off beautifully. My one complaint is the barroom brawl. It seems unduly melodramatic for a movie whose style appears deliberately understated.

Thirty years later and most Americans have only textbook knowledge of that explosive period and a world turned upside down. Parallax View may be a work of fiction, but it remains a telling insight into what much of the public was feeling. At movie's end, Frady rushes from the darkness toward the light of an open doorway only to be gunned down before he can reach the source. In 1978, the House Committee on Assassinations issued its findings. Contrary to the hurried Warren Report, the Committee found that  JFK ""was probably assassinated as the result of a conspiracy"". But there was never any follow-up to that finding. It was as if committee members suddenly saw a light from an opening door but were unwilling to pass through. One doesn't have to agree to appreciate the historical or entertainment value of the movie. Parallax View remains a testament to its makers and to a period that in many ways is still with us.

My copy is a new tape which is fine. However, the movie has enough merit to look into an expanded DVD version if such is available.",1208131200,9,4783,4.892592592592592

Watch the propagandizing ""recruitment"" film at the film's centerpiece, and try not to think of Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" psychic realignment scene.

For me, it's a little too much suspense but I do tend to gravitate to older films with a more straightforward story.

Perhaps this is meant on some level to evoke the titular ""parallax.""  Regardless, it's impressive.

It's a 70s movie, so there are action scenes.  One jawdropping scene involves a fight on top of the Space Needle, which looks like it was actually shot on top of the Space Needle and not in front of a backdrop.  I am still wondering how they did that.  Of course, you take the good with the bad, where the bad includes a 70s style car chase complete with the obligatory hillbilly music to start it off.

Beatty turns in a fine performance, and the script delivers some surprises.  All in all, a decent movie with some amazing cinematography that shows well on DVD.  So why just three stars?

Joe Brady (Warren Beatty) is a second rate reporter for a third rate Seattle newspaper.  A prominent Senator is making his bid for President at the Seattle Spaceneedle but is murdered by a pair of gunmen.  One by one everyone at the event dies.  The deaths are reasonable but the coincidence is not.  When a friend of Joe's comes up dead, Joe decides to look into her conspiracy theory.

Joe goes to a remote fishing village where a Judge drowned.  It was obvious that there was something more to the drowning than meets the eye.  When the Sheriff tries to kill Joe, it becomes evident that he killed the judge.  Joe goes to the sheriff's home and discovers documents lead him to the Parallax Corporation.

Next Joe goes to find one of the few living witnesses to the assassination, Austin Tucker (William Daniels).  Austin takes Joe out on his yacht.  During the trip a bomb explodes and kills all on board.  Well that's what everyone thinks.  Joe was blown off the boat and survived.

Joe now focuses on the Parallax Corp.  He figures out that they are recruiting assassins and tries to get recruited by them.  While out at their offices he sees a familiar face and follows him to the airport.  The only thing is that the man does not get on the plane but another political candidate is on the plane.  Joe realizes that the man planted a bomb on the plane.

Upon Joe's return, he is given his first Parallax mission.  Joe sabotages his mission and goes back to the Parallax Corp where he sees the man again and follows him to the convention center.  Another political figure is holding a rehearsal for his fundraiser.  Joe sees a rifle.  He realizes that another assassination is going to happen but it is too late.

This is an interesting film but fairly unrealistic.  The interesting thing about the film is how to interpret what happens with Joe.  Is he a good reporter or was he set up from the beginning?  This and other questions are deliberately not answered.

This is the first of Alan J Pakula's political films that include Three Days of the Condor and the Oscar winning All the President's Men.  The cast is top rate mostly up and coming or established character actors.  Hume Cronyn gives a great performance as Joe's editor.

This is a good watch and would recommend either of Pakula's other two films mentioned to make it a double feature or another film that looks at the Kennedy assassination, Executive Action.

253046,5,6300216497,"""The Parallax View,"" Alan J Pakula's classic 70's paranoid conpiracy thriller, gets the shortest of DVD shrifts from Paramount Home Video.

Save for a well done trailer, there are NO extras, not even English subtitles for us dialouge freaks.

Warren Beatty, in one of his coolest movie star turns, plays Joe Frady, a ""third rate journalist from Oregon"" who stumbles onto a massive conspiracy run by the shadowy Parallax Organization who represented in the film by the late, great character actor Walter Mc Ginn, is ""in the business of recruiting assasssins.""

What makes ""Parallax"" even more menacing is that the screenplay gives this assassination bureau no particular political bent...both liberal and conservative presidential hopefuls are targeted.

It may be interesting to note that two screenplays for ""Parallax"" were commissioned (the first by Lorenzo Semple Jr, the second by David Giler) and rejected.

The material that was actually shot was heavily re written by Pakula, Beatty and allegedly by an uncredited Robert Towne during a Hollywood writer's strike in the spring of 1974.

Hence the Beatty character, originally written as a small town cop, becomes a rogue investigative reporter with a talent for ""creative irresponsibility,""-- according to a new biogrpahy of Pakula, much of the screenplay was still being written as the film was shot.

Aside from Pakula's remarkable contributions, much of the impact of ""Parallax"" comes from Gordon Willis' cinematography (Beatty's character is dwarfed by the large glass and steel high rise that houses Parallax's ""Division of Human Engineering), and by the late Michael Small's minimilast score--the Parallax murders are heralded by a creepy, recurring anthem.

""Parallax View"" released in June of 1974, two months before the Nixon resignation, was a box office failure, owing to the fact perhaps that Paramount put all its promotional efforts into ""Chinatown,"" a personal production of then studio head Robert Evans.

It's lack of commercial success was probably due in larger part that the film was a slice of unrelenting paranoid perversity--Beatty's reporter hero is defeated by the conspiracy and his character is both killed and framed 'Oswald-like' for the film's last assassination--Beatty would return to the screen, more truee to type, a few months later as a Beverly Hills hairdresser who beds every woman on the West Coast.

""Parallax View"" cries out for a 2 disc special edition, such as Warner Brothers is giving another Pakula conspiracy film, ""All The President's Men"" in late February.

Pakula's gone but perhaps Beatty could be coaxed out of his mountain hideaway to do a commentary and some of those researchers who put together the material for the Parallax employment test (one of the great moments in movie history)might make themselves available.  Pakula reportedly spent four months putting together this powerful and divertingly amazing sequence.

I agree with previous reviews about the chilling and eerie feel of this film, from the cold sterile corporation settings, to the Parallax Corp ""test film"", to the  authoritarian commission handing down ridiculous decisions to  a  public powerless to challenge them.

While the story itself was intriguing, I felt some parts were a bit slow, some of the editing could have been better to move the film along. The acting and writing are both pretty solid. I noticed a couple of the scenes are practically homages to other films, especially the bar brawl which was quite similar to that of the excellent Western ""Shane"".

There isn't an ounce of cinematic fat on it; no extraneous scenes, no unnecessary dialogue, no gratuitous violence (outside of a bar fight), and no distracting love interest. It's 102 minutes of tight storytelling that builds all of its suspense from the quiet accumulation of detail. Note the scene on the airplane, when the tension mounts from the simple act of a flight attendant lifting napkins off a pile. Note the central 20 minutes of the film around the justly touted brainwashing sequence, which features almost no traditional dialogue whatsoever. And note how little music there is in the film, yet how effectively it haunts you and communicates a sense of foreboding. Historians can also note the plot's not-so-thinly veiled resemblances to the Kennedy assassination.

Beatty's character goes to a sort-of character screening as he attempts to join Parallax Corp., and as part of the 'audition' he must watch a bizarre 3-4 minute film of images and sounds while his vital signs are monitored.  It is a brilliant concept, brilliantly executed.

For anyone who loves a tragic underdog fighting a war that you just know the poor guy can't win, this movie would make a welcome addition to your collection.",1106697600,5,907,5.142857142857143
253084,3,6300216497,"On this Amazon website The Parallax View is linked to Three Days of the Condor, another classic conspiracy thriller from 1975, also produced by Paramount. But I contend that Paramount's 1974 The Conversation fits with The Parallax View. I say this because there is between them both a harsh violence and an atmosphere created that doesn't bathe the characters in safety or a belief that everything will be alright. As was the case in this era of films, including Chinatown, Night Moves, Three Days of the Condor, Serpico, The Last Detail, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Nashville, Z, Taxi Driver, Dog Day Afternoon, etc., things are not alright.
What I appreciated about The Parallax View though, was the anger and fear it engendered. The suspense was palpable and the reasoning unclear. All you know is that Beatty is on the hunt, oblivious to his place in the game, and his opponent's true nature.
The Parallax View is a very effective thriller, though it includes a ridiculous bar fight, and a somewhat standard car chase. It does though, feature an ominous beginning and ending, creepy music, and acting that moves it all along fine.",1098144000,7,1138,4.871134020618556
253085,3,6300216497,"""The Parallax View"" was big liberal Warren Beatty's attempt to describe a conspiracy involving shadowy government agencies. It is entertaining and worth watching, but misses the mark. Beatty seems to be trying to piece together an explanation on how, or even who, killed Kennedy. ""The Manchurian Candidate"" may have inspired him. Beatty plays a journalist who goes undercover, allowing himself to be recruited by the Parallax Corporation, presumably a CIA front that trains assassins. His psychological profile is determined in part by watching a disturbing montage of scenes, ranging from love, sex and patriotism to war, gore and devil worship, mixed with the juxtaposition of wealth vs. need. The point seems to be that people go hungry while rich America has sex and kills people?

253117,4,6300216497,"SPOILER ALERT
Reminds me very much of THE WICKER MAN (released that same year of '74) in that both films chart the nightmarish progress of men who are seeking to uncover a mystery and right a great wrong, who must plunge into disorienting environments where none of the rules they adhered to back in the 'normal world' apply; they can't get their footing, and quickly become controlled by events. By the time they realize their every step has been not just watched but directed from the beginning...it's too late.
Warren Beatty's Joe Frady, a minor reporter in the Northwest, begins investigating the deaths of witnesses to a political assassination he'd covered three years before. He stumbles upon literature from The Parallax Corporation, an outfit he comes to believe are clandestinely recruiting & training assassins; he decides to penetrate the group as a 'job applicant', armed with a mass-murderer's psych-test responses and a false identity. He has made a slight but fatal error in judgment, however, for Parallax are in the business of identifying and grooming fall guys - custom-built, designer patsies to draw attention from their trained cadre of actual assassins during the deed, then to be killed in the ensuing melee. Ingeniously, Parallax carefully select appropriate moody-loner backgrounds that will satisfy official inquiries into the murder that the killer was a certified strange-o, thus acting alone.
The first half of PARALLAX plays like a standard macho action picture: barroom brawls, car chases, grouchy editors, redneck cops, sexually forthright women swarming over the studly maverick hero. Stay with it, however. The second half is obviously the movie Beatty, Pakula and Gordon Willis were after - stark, overwhelmingly visual, mountingly claustrophobic yet set in vastness (every interior set is like an aircraft hangar; even the catwalk goes on forever). The car chase bravado of the first hour is long forgotten by this point, with Beatty assuming the holy-fool status of Edward Woodward's stiff-necked policeman in THE WICKER MAN. While it's true the two halves of this film never do fit together comfortably, the nightcap of this double feature ranks among the best moviemaking of the 1970s.",1023667200,61,2226,5.273239436619718
253118,5,6300216497,"Beatty plays journalist investigating mysterious deaths of witnesses to a political assassination.
Pakula's dark and paranoid masterpiece was origninally shot by Gordon Willis (Godfathers I II and III, Klute, Zeilig, etc.) in 2.35 aspect.  Willis, a master of light and composition, developed frames for this film that are practically abstract.  His sense of composition (I'm sure Pakula was part of this) is brilliant: the static formalistic compositions; the use of long lenses to flatten each image into an (almost) isometric projection.
Now, maybe I'm getting carried away here, but ""parallax"" and ""isometric""...?  Hmmm... Both are terms related to geometry the ""perception"" of reality -- which is more-or-less the subtext of this film.
Anyway, after its dissapearance from theater screens this film made numerous appearances on TV (mainly late at night) in a pan-and-scan version.  Same with the VHS version.  So until the DVD was released, this was the only way I (and most other people) had seen it.
Well twice the frame is twice as good -- now entire sequences can be re-examined and reinterpreted (the ending has elements which appeared seperated in the VHS version).
I found the picture and sound to be good, but I'd hoped for more additional material (a documentary, a making of, an interview or two -- anything).  This is certainly one film that deserves the extra attention.  However I'm grateful for the 2.35 version.
Bottom line: a real treat for cinephiles, and a great movie for everyone else.",1011225600,72,1510,5.163934426229508

From the opening on the Space Needle, it is obvious this movie isn't going to be run of the mill.  From there, every plot line just gets bigger and bigger, until everything envelops Warren Beatty to form the film's stunning conclusion.

253122,4,6300216497,"In my humble opinion the late Alan J. Pakula was the finest suspense director of all time and the think man's answer to Alfred Hitchcock.  Now I don't mean to put down the ""Master of Suspense,"" but his movies were made with the sole intention of being entertaining, reguardless of how shallow they may be.  Pakula, on the other hand, interweaved with his nail-biting tension meaningful substance-based stories that only added to my appreciation of his films.  In fact in most instances it was the political ramifications that spawned from his movies that made them more terrifying than any shower scene or telescopic lens could ever think of being.  Take for example All the President's Men.  He allowed the picture to slowly build until your stomach's in knots and you leave the theatre more unsettled than you went in.
The Parallax View is much the same way.  It starts with a political assassination and ends with a twist that even M. Night Shyamalan couldn't have written any better.  Warren Beatty stars as a Washington reporter who's witness to the assassination and, like everybody else, doesn't question the government's findings when they rule it was the act of a lone gunman (where have we heard that before?).  That is until other witnesses start dying off under mysterious circumstances.  But it's not before six of the eighteen, including his ex-girlfriend, die that he is moved to action.  He starts prying around, as reporters have a tendancy to do, seeing what he can uncover.
Joe (Beatty) follows a lead to the small town of Salmontail where a seventh witness has gone missing and is now presumed dead.  He is, of course, having fallen victim to a fishing accident that drowned him.  And it's not long after discovering this that the first attempt on Joe's life is made.  This only serves to strengthen his resolve, which he puts to work by applying to a mysterious corporation that may be a front for finding and hiring potential assassins.  If this isn't frightening enough for you waiting until you discover the bizarre truth, it's more chilling than anything you can imagine.
Now I don't pretend to be pretentious enough to suggest that everyone's going to be as engaged by this film as I was.  It's a very intricate and complex thriller that doesn't allow you to breeze through without being made to think.  If you're looking to put your brain on cruise control and relax after a long day's work, and there's nothing wrong with that, than you're looking in the wrong place.  This is not the kind of movie you can simply wander in and out of, because it flows at a very particular pace that to break it up would only be doing yourself a disservice.
Beatty is superb in his performance and, being as he's the only notable name in front of the camera, is asked to carry much of the movie.  There's seldom a scene that goes without him being in it, and by doing this we see the proceedings through his eyes.  It's a very effect and absorbing technique that makes the audience a part of the story rather than merely observing it.  We're never allowed to get ahead of our protagnoist, putting us on the same rollercoast ride of revelations that he's on.
I hate to overemphasize the impact of the film's conclusion, but if you lose patience just remember, the ending changes the tone of everything that proceeded it.  This is a classic thriller.",985564800,4,3360,4.7094017094017095
253123,4,6300216497,"""The Parallax View"" remains one of the classic paranoid conspiracy thrillers of the 1970's.
Released during the height of the Watergate revelations and just a few years after the assassinations of the sixties, ""Parallax""  played on the general public mistrust of the government, politicians and big monolithic corporations.
Director Alan Pakula (""All The President's Men"") gives the film a stunning visual style (the reporter hero (Warren Beatty) is continually shown being dwarfed by the large Parallax steel and glass headquarters)and the short film Beatty is told to watch as he attempts to infiltrate the Parallax conspiracy remains one of the best moments ever in a feature film.
The quality of the DVD is superb (especially considering the film is almost 30 years old), images are sharp and clear.
However,considering the film's dense subject matter, one would have hoped Paramount would have included some additional special features (interviews with political activist Beatty, screenwriters Lorenzo Semple Jr. and David Giler; making of featurette etc).
Example: the final shooting script of ""Parallax"" is completely different from the original screenplay that was written by Semple; Beatty changed the character of the hero from a small town cop to an investigative reporter.
The only special feature included on the DVD is an well produced 1974 theatrical trailer.
However, the widescreen version of the film is a far improvement over the pan and scan version available on VHS.

253124,5,6300216497,"Warren Beatty is great in this movie.  So is Hume Cronyn and a host of others you'll recognize from the 1970's TV and Film.  But the real star of this movie is the story ... a mystery inside an enigma wrapped up in a riddle.  Born from the investigations into the assassinations of JFK, Martin Luther King Jr. and RFK and the investigations into each this story is all too plausible ... and frightenly believable.  1960's were turbulent times, with great movements and events all over the nation and the world.  It's not unthinkable that some wanted to control the outcome of these events.
Towards this theory, ""The Parallax View"" demonstrates how bogus corporations recruit certain profiled individuals to carry out their objectives using trickery and deceit to ""compartmentalize"" the actor and eliminate the ""target"".  This movie requires close attention to see all the subtle elements.  If you ever thought the assassinations of America's leaders in the 1960's were ""glossed over"" then this movie is for you.  It's a paranoia storyline to be sure, but perhaps a little skepticism is healthy from time to time.
The only thing I'm not crazy about in the film is its 1974 production.  So the clothes and cars are so out of date as to be distracting from the storyline.  I think this film is an excellent candidate for remake and I'l like to see a director like Ridley Scott or James Cameron look at this script.

It is hard to know when a cliche begins. I'm not sure if ""The Parallax View"" is the first to do the things it does or is ""in line"" so to speak. I suppose that's the point of these reviews, to see if the ideas have held up well or if my later perspective yields an interesting insight/POV. As a member of generation X I have to say that I have seen this movie, that is this type of movie, many, many times. What I didn't know going into this is that I have seen this director's work several times before. Pakula has done this movie many times just with different names such as ""The Pelican Brief (gag!)."" There were many obligatory scenes: betrayal, car chases, explosions, bar fights, shoot outs, and CONSPIRACY! Yes, delicious CONSPIRACY! Wow,  is this director a one trick pony or what? ""The Parallax View"" is a mixed bag from a technical standpoint. There are some terrible gaffer sounds like really loud ham sandwiches and poorly framed shots to very creepy and interesting sounds and the final seconds of the movie with its fascinating scamper toward the light, or was it truth? It was a parallax I suppose. The film is aptly titled because the duel perspectives are repleat. Sometimes the dialogue was clever, even thought provoking, sometimes it was contrived. As the movie went on it began to ""wear on,"" then ""drag on,"" until the final act and it crawled to its conclusion. It had its moments but in the end it was just a rank conspiracy/political thriller. The way I have approached this retrospective project is to select around 10 films from each year. I cannot have seen them. I would like at least one from each year be one I have never heard of. Why have I never heard of ""The Parallax View?"" My guess is that it got lost in the shuffle with the many other films that are just like it that may or may not even be in the same genre. My conclusion is that I am really no better off having seen this.

[The typewriters date this film.] The editor doesn't want creative reporting. [But what about their readers?] Later another reporter visits Joe; somebody is trying to kill her! [Does she know too much?] Other witnesses to the assassination have died in accidents. Lately two more have died.

Reporter Lee died of an accidental overdose of barbiturates and alcohol while driving her car. [Overkill?] Joe meets a source, an ex-FBI agent, at an amusement park to ask questions.

Joe visits a College Professor to ask about that test; what answers show a violent character? Joe sees Ernie. Then Joe goes to meet Austin Tucker (after being searched). Tucker wants his privacy and is willing to pay cash. This meeting takes place on a boat for privacy. There is a photograph of a waiter. The others in the photos are gone. What are those two men up too? There is an explosive surprise.

Joe returns to see his editor Bill. A corporation that recruits assassins? Joe will go undercover since he is reported dead. A man from Parallax visits Joe, who shows a short fuse. It's the other people who have the problem. Joe is given tests to gauge his personality from his reactions to the pictures. [Recognize any?] He recognizes a man and follows him to an airport. [No inspection of baggage then.] Joe boards a Boeing 707 at the last minute. A Senator rides in First Class. [The ticket price dates this film.] Joe leaves a warning message, the Boeing 707 returns to Los Angeles. You later hear a loud noise. A visitor awaits Joe and asks ""who are you?"" Joe explains his past. He doesn't remember what happened after a couple of beers. A new man delivers coffee and a sandwich to editor Bill. A massive coronary?

When Joe begins his new job he sees the other man and quickly acts to send him away. [Is he being watched?] There is a large auditorium for a political meeting. A school band practices their music. Senator Hammond arrives for this rehearsal. Joe inspects the top of the stage. Three shots are fired, Hammond is hit! Joe sees a rifle with a telescopic sight. ""There he is!"" Guards search the top of the stage. Can Joe get away? There is a man by the door.

This is based on the novel by Loren Singer. Companies do hire private agencies for operatives that can act as ""ropers"" (people who will try to make trouble for a co-worker).

If you think that's all they do, learn about Karen Silkwood. The word ""assassin"" was derived from killers trained for political murders.
