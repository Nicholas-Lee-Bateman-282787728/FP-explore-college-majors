8099876,5,B000COHN68,"I started backcountry skiing (Cat) with professionally certified guides a couple of years ago. I have read a couple of avalanche and backcountry books, as well as watched one video. This is the finest book yet. I now understand what the guides were doing and the reasons for the instructions they gave us. This is a clear and well organized guide to avalanche awareness. I like how the material is reinforced with examples. I especially like the action plans on what to look for and avoid, and the ""Ten commandments"" section. I feel that this book will help me the next time I am in the backcountry.",1246838400,,599,4.607476635514018

No other video has as many esteemed experts with real world experience. This is just the best.",1137110400,,237,4.266666666666667
