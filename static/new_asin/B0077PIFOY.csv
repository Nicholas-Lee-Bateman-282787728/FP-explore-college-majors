8511914,4,B0077PIFOY,"This is a great idea by Mill Creek Entertainment, putting two documentary Series together on one DVD Set. This collection features the following Series: BLACK HISTORY-A RETROSPECTIVE and UP FROM SLAVERY. This 5-Disc collection contains 20 Hours of interesting documentaries celebrating the life, culture and accomplishments of the most influential African Americans. I think this is one of the best collection ever released by Mill Creek, History buffs will have a great time watching these 48 programs. I've learned a lot while watching these documentaries and I have discovered a lot of fascinating people. The series UP FROM SLAVERY is particularly great.

-- Documentary 2: UP FROM SLAVERY ( 2 DVD, 5 Hours, 7 Episodes )
Up From Slavery is a powerful, compelling and haunting 7-part documentary series that examines the history of slavery in America, from the arrival of the first African slaves through Nat Turner's Rebellion to the Civil War and beyond. When slavery was first brought to America's shores, the war, and even the nation it tore apart, was centuries in the future. With incredibly detailed historical reenactments, expert commentary and the stories of slavery told through first-hand accounts, this is an epic struggle 400 years in the making. A journey into the past like none other. This is the story of these men and women who by their hands laid the foundation of what would become the most powerful nation on Earth.

8511915,5,B0077PIFOY,"This review is focused more on the 2nd title in this two-DVD set (""UP FROM SLAVERY""), but it is clear to all that there was great care taken in the writing of this documentary, and in the shooting of the original recreations for the film series. Care was also taken to give a balanced portrayal of events -- highlighting the more far-reaching and important events that either represented slavery on the whole or affected later history in their importance -- but condensing nearly 400 years of history into a few hours would be a difficult task for anyone taking on that challenge. I do not believe that there are any errors of fact in these 7 films, but if there were omissions, it was not an intention to hide anything, simply a matter of condensing so much history into a prescribed and artificial time parameter, the approximately 45 minute running time for each episode as is the industry norm. I believe strongly that this series, at such a fantastic price, is ideal for educators and students of all levels and appropriate for all ages.  The 2nd Disc is also very good, a great collection of older documentaries and museum films telling the long story of black history in the United States.",1332979200,18,1196,4.668246445497631
