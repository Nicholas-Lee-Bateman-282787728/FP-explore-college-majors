5114791,4,B007Y6CSSA,"Greta Gerwig's characters are weirdos. Not self deprecatingly hilarious like writer creator director twitter twatter Lena Dunham. Lister Jones is the Lena Dunham. Her lines were the killers. Gerwig is not easily lovable. She's cute and awkwardly sexy, but off enough to scare most folks. I like her. I like this movie. I doubt I would get along well with the character, and I honestly can't tell what kind of friend Gerwig would be in person. I like the mystery. I'm going to keep watching her. And this Wein/Lister Jones work. No, I'm not tired of New York movies yet. No, I'm not tired of irritatingly well off and well educated bohemian New Yorkers.  Their privilege allows them to self wallow in ways the rest of us don't have time for. It's interesting and the architecture is lovely.",1349049600,,789,4.717391304347826
5114792,4,B007Y6CSSA,"I love, love, loved it. It is not simple or straightforward being an almost 30-something or 30-something woman today. So many options, so many expectations, and so much ambiguity. This movie captures it all in a really simple, honest way that is just enjoyable. And you wrap it up feeling completely alright even if all the loose ends are still loose.",1348876800,,351,4.770491803278689
5114793,1,B007Y6CSSA,"Still another example of the psychologically distorted lives of NY writers both in book and movie script formats. Is it environmental damage to their collective genomes or are they attracted like moths toward a romantic flaming self-immolation? Ninety percent of what comes out of that region of the country is the same, repeatedly redux, self-absorbed, romantic misadventures with low level comedic interludes to keep from getting bored to death.
Story:
Guy gets cold feet just before wedding and girl gets depressed. Looks for alternative feel good activities and parents are a comedic lack of help. Usual male friend whom we (viewer) can't quite decide if he's the substitute she needs.

Help! NY - secede from Earth. Please!",1348272000,5,728,5.222222222222222
5114794,4,B007Y6CSSA,"This is definitely a movie geared toward women, but more than that, it is a story of love, loss, renewal, friendship and so much more. I had no idea what to expect in this movie, but came to find it to be a fun, enjoyable film with good acting by the whole cast and a strong plot that kept me engaged throughout. One of the other things that made this movie unique were the relationships between the characters, as the actors in the film did a great job at developing these relationships and you could tangibly see this throughout the movie. I have to say that if you like a movie that is edgy and engaging, as well as a bit effeminate, this is definitely the movie for you!",1347408000,,674,4.232558139534884

The fianc reemerges and she must decide whether or not to get back together with him. The underappreciated Greta Gerwig carries this one well, as the jilted woman who is trying to find her way in world of love and relationships. There is a solid combination of laughs and emotion here as the film touches on s subject many of us are familiar with. Big Screen portrayals of the pursuit of companionship are as old as film itself, but when done in a quality manner, they are always enjoyable.",1340841600,,655,4.655172413793103
5114798,4,B007Y6CSSA,"""Lola Versus"" (87 min.) is the second feature film for real-life partners Daryl Wein (co-writer and director) and Zoe Lister Jones (co-writer and co-star), after the promising 2009 feature ""Breaking Upwards"". I caught ""Lola Versus"" just recently at the Esquire, the Cincinnati indie-movies theatre.

""Lola Versus"" brings the story of Lola (played by Greta Gerwig), who is in a seemingly perfect relationship with boyfriend Like (played by Joel Kinnaman), as it is portrayed in the first 5 min. of the movie. In fact Luke proposes to Lola, who happily says yes. But alas, with only weeks before the wedding date, Luke breaks up with Lola. In the rest of the movie we see Lola struggling to cope with this devastating news, counting on her close friends to help her, including best girl pal Alice (played by Lister Jones) and best guy pal Henry (played by Hamish Linklater). It would ruin your viewing experience if I spelled out how it all unfolds, you'll just have to see it for yourself.

Several comments: first, the script is loosely based on the real life experience of Lister Jones and Wein breaking up for about a year and how Lister Jones coped as a newly single woman in her mid/late 20s. Second, I first noticed Greata Gerwig in ""Greenberg"" some 3-4 years ago, and in ""Lola Versus"" Gerwig again oozes charm (and talent) and she easily carries the movie on her shoulders. Her performance just transfixed me. Third, keep an eye out for Debra WInger and Bill Pullman as Lola's parents, in particular Pullman delivers some memorable lines. In all, I can't emphasize enough how charmed I was by the movie. This is way off the radar screenfrom your mainstream Hollywood fare. One of those ""little movies that could"", and then did. I was amazed when the end credits started rolling as I had no idea an hour and a half had come and gone. If you like a smart, engaging, delightful indie movie about ""relationships"", ""Lola Versus"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1340755200,11,1952,4.789317507418398

5114803,2,B007Y6CSSA,"This is the movie that turned me off of Greta Gerwig. I've been a fan of hers since the Mumblecore days of ""Hannah Takes the Stairs"" -- I even forgave her for selling out and doing the remake of ""Arthur."" But I think I'm done with her now, facing serious Greta Gerwig burnout. ""Lola Versus"" is the reason -- watching (enduring?) this movie, I was reminded that I've seen this character before. It's Frances Ha meets _________(take the Gerwig character from any other New York indie film where she's the single, slightly ditzy, but lovable young woman). Every. Single. Movie. It's the same character with only a slight variation. Everyone compares her to Diane Keaton, but Keaton moved on and pushed herself in new directions after ""Annie Hall."" Greg keeps playing the same character over and over. I'm done.

Though nice to see any movie with Debra Winger.",1464480000,,856,4.783783783783784

This a very honest  depiction of a girl in her 20's dealing with life and figuring out who she is and what she wants. Its funny and witty and has some parts that are so funny that you will feel compelled to attempt to retell these parts to friends. I adore the cast so much more after seeing this film and would say that this has me waiting for more from Greta, Hamish and Zoe Lister Jones.

5114825,1,B007Y6CSSA,"Rented this one night, the trailer looked ok. The acting was SO bad, this was probably the worst amateur hour acting I have ever seen in a movie. Star ""Lola"" Greta Gerwig was completely unbelievable, boring, monotone, unemotional.

I watched it the whole way through, it was pretty much about a girl that got dumped who was -rediscovering?- or attempting to herself through new dates with her friends/others. I didn't get the title ""Lola vs. sex, love, the world"" there was no ""world"" besides her group of 2 friends in the movie, and there was certainly no ""sex."" The only reason why I kept watching was because her best friend in the movie was cute and entertaining.

Disappointing. I'm sorry I actually paid the $2.99 to watch this.",1399766400,2,734,4.7265625
5114826,5,B007Y6CSSA,"I really enjoyed the witty portrayal of the main character, and how many of the scenes seemed to reflect more realistically (with slight exaggeration) how life ends up turning out than most movies in this genre.  It was very funny and I liked watching Lola grow as a person.

5114830,4,B007Y6CSSA,"Any time the movie is about a quirky twentysomthing, I often find them self-indulgent and unconvincing.  Lola Versus is an exception.  Yes, she has the usual battery of problems (her love life, for the most part) and is ill-equipped to deal with them, but we're still given an entertaining story and some good performances.  I didn't expect to care much for this movie, but it's not without its charm.",1389312000,,401,4.782608695652174
5114831,4,B007Y6CSSA,"I wasn't sorry i purchased this DVD. It was entertaining and Greta Gerwig is always charming and fun to watch. Basically, she is in love and engaged one moment and the next, not so much. Her character has a hard time coming to terms with her newfound single life and makes a few mistakes along the way of finding herself. This is an independent film that I found quirky and cute. Definitely a chick flick.",1382313600,,405,4.413333333333333
5114832,2,B007Y6CSSA,"I guess I was looking for a ""pick me up"" kind of movie, but this one just didn't seem to fit my style. The delivery and Amazon was great - I just didn't care so much for the movie itself after watching it",1373414400,,204,3.7674418604651163
5114833,5,B007Y6CSSA,"Lola Verus starring the always delightful Greta Gerwig is a smart and funny romantic drama about a woman who gets dumped 3 weeks before her wedding. The writing is strong, the acting is solid, and the whole premise of the film is so refreshing. Lola is afraid to be alone, she will do anything to feel wanted and desired again by men, even if that means sleeping with those men way too soon. Lola is 29 and the love of her life calls off the wedding because he's scared. Lola is shocked and reeling from the break-up, she sort of has a mini-breakdown along the way. During the course of a year, Lola learns that being single is not a bad thing. Lola is a relatable woman, she has insecurities and hang-ups, but she still keeps going and living her life on her own terms. I like the ending because Lola ends up saving herself instead of a man saving her. Excellent and realistic indie film, give it a try! Enjoy.",1372118400,,911,4.333333333333333
5114834,4,B007Y6CSSA,Greta Gerwig is superb as usual.  The story is engaging.  I would recommend this film to anyone who is following Greta's career which includes The Dish and the Spoon.,1369440000,,166,4.689655172413793

5114836,3,B007Y6CSSA,"Pretty standard stuff, mid-20's ""who am I, what is it all about, love, life....."" Gerwig is wonderfully off center and odd and give a wonderful performance, but you have seen this film before. Perhaps it is a reinventioin of the tale for a younger generation. Worth seeing for $4.",1368576000,2,280,4.73469387755102
5114837,4,B007Y6CSSA,"I,like this movie I think this young lady was a very caring person,in a relationship with young man who was not ready to be serious with her.

5114838,3,B007Y6CSSA,"This was an enjoyable film, showcasing Greta Gerwig's talent and offering up a story that seemed convoluted at times. There is little question of Ms. Gerwig's talent. She appears to be the quintessential Woody proscribed heroine. This was so much more than earlier appearance in 'Greenberg.'",1368489600,,291,5.3478260869565215
5114839,3,B007Y6CSSA,I'm not sure how I feel about this movie.  I didn't hate it but I wasn't bowled over either.  The acting was solid but there was not enough depth for the movie to really make an impact.  It was just OK for me.,1363478400,,209,3.813953488372093

5114841,3,B007Y6CSSA,The movie was average. It was about a woman who goes off on a trip of her own after she gets dumped by her fiance. Could have been better.,1360454400,,138,3.793103448275862
5114842,5,B007Y6CSSA,great romantic movie . especially because it's about learning to love yourself before being able to love others . funny and heartwarming .,1358294400,,138,5.043478260869565
5114843,3,B007Y6CSSA,"The preview immediately speaks to the cute, awkward girl who's just had a crap of a time in her love life. A girl (or guy) can see this and think ""hell, I've been there"" and you want to identify with the character and movie immediately. So I was stoked to rent it.

Then...I couldn't figure out if parts were really sad, or funny, or awkward/funny, and the plot bounced you around. There are parts of the movie you laugh at, and that's what I wish the director would've concentrated on. The parts of the movie every person identifies with.
You want to be happy for the character at the end, but you think, this is the most unrealistic ending EVER.

that's my two cents.",1357862400,,669,4.387096774193548

5114849,1,B007Y6CSSA,"Promising cast, forgettable result.  Greta Gerwig was delightful in ""Greenberg"", but here she plays a boring, self-absorbed 29-er (oooooh, big dilemma!!!!), whose ""problems"" are less than engrossing. She is surrounded by a bunch of cliche males, all
of whom are also pretty annoying.  Her parents are played (written and acted dismally) by the usually great Bill Pullman and Debra Winger.  The poor writing and directing seem to have gotten the better of these fine actors.
  This is another in a slew of ""hip"", ""how-it-is-now"", pretentiously wry bits of fluff. A slightly edgier ""Sex and the City""... deep as  a postage stamp.

5114852,5,B007Y6CSSA,"I can't believe none of the reviewers talked about Joel Kinnaman (Luke the dumper) in this fantastic movie. While the movie centered around Lola, all the scenes that Joel came onto the screen, he eschewed them, hands down, and charmed the viewers with his unbelievable tenderness, sorrow, and real panic when he realized that he was making a big mistake and wanted to make it right. Yes he was drop dead gorgeous, all skinny long loose limbs, the occassional shy smiles that instantly lit up the screen and those tattoos on his arms, oh, you gotta see them to believe them. Joel first got my attention in the criminally underrated tv series The Killing, highly recommended to anyone who appreciate genuinely good shows. He was truly amazing in that one too.",1353888000,,757,4.786259541984733

5114854,4,B007Y6CSSA,"After reading some pretty bad reviews for this movie, I finally decided to watch it myself. Being in my late 20's, I found Greta Gerwig's character relatable and not as spoiled as other reviewer's have mentioned. I actually felt empathetic toward Lola and imagined myself making the same silly choices she was making had I been in a similar situation.

Zoe Lister-Jones was my absolute favorite person in this movie, I loved her role as the quirky/weird best friend. I wish I had a best friend like that! Her lines were hilarious, perhaps borderline offensive for those who are sensitive, but her character was one of those who actually says the things we usually keep to ourselves.

The movie is pretty funny, especially if you are a female. I don't think my husband would have liked this movie, but it is definitely geared more towards young women. Lola Vs. is a great movie to watch with girlfriends and a bottle of wine.",1351468800,,924,4.697530864197531
5114855,3,B007Y6CSSA,"My first experience watching Greta Gerwig was in a small movie from 2010 called ""Greenberg.""  By my count she now has 6 films that have or will come out in 2012 including this one.  Here she plays a 29 year old part time waitress trying to get her Ph. D. by explaining great literary pieces.  Many will compare this ""relationship"" film to ""Sex in the City"" or Lena Dunham's ""Tiny Furniture/Girls"" and like those films/TV series, New York City is a central character.

The film opens with Lola about to get married to Luke (Joel Kinnaman, ""Safe House""), a hunky dude she lives with.  He gets cold feet a few weeks before the wedding, which is catastrophic for Lola.  Propped up by her former hippie parents (Debra Winger and Bill Pullman) and a couple clichd friends (co-writer Zoe Lister Jones and Hamish Linklater), the story follows Lola's attempt to regain her footing.  She's confused and convinced that no one wants her, so begins a series of one night stands that includes her friend Henry (Linklater).  I'm surprised she didn't try Alice (Jones).  Now that would have been interesting.

After dipping her toe again with Luke and several all night drunken binges, Lola finally realizes she must confront her own self doubt before moving on.  I don't mean to be a spoiler but the general story here is nothing new and nothing most haven't seen before.  What is interesting is Greta Gerwig in her first lead performance.  There's something about her.  Her charisma, her quirky charm, her below-the-radar attractiveness that allows the brief (89 minutes) film to be worthwhile.",1349827200,8,1580,4.847014925373134
5114856,5,B007Y6CSSA,"Greta Gerwig has become a bit of the indie it-girl lately, and Lola Versus is a perfect example of why. Her girl-next-door sexiness and quirky sense of humor make her characters lovable and relatable. Lola Versus is a fun film about a young woman in the big city facing the tribulations of love, sex, and life in general. It's an honest and heartfelt film that is as fun as it is emotional. The Blu-ray looks fantastic as well.

8523126,2,B007Y6CSSA,"Ehhhh...it was just OK. Mostly boring, and wasn't much of a comedy. The main actress is pretty dull, and her character wasn't interesting. I only watched it to pass time. I wouldn't recommend, or, watch it again. The best part of the movie was her best friend Alice.",1526515200,,266,4.5625
8523127,2,B007Y6CSSA,"No 'year long adventure' like the write-up says. She was around the same friends in the same town back and forth or all wrapped up in the same guy. Disappointing maybe as much for the 'adventure' word which made me expect a 'start over, go someplace new, find a better version of yourself than the jilted fiance' .........., as much that as the juvenile characters playing at relationship and the weirdness of the girlfriend, etc. Just didn't 'take' for me to finish it.",1524268800,,470,4.674698795180723
