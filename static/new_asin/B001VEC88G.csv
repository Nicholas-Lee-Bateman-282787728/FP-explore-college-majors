3821468,5,B001VEC88G,The artists and curators gave good insight into the drawings of James castle .  Seemed to be a compulsion to make his beautiful art giving us a doorway into his mind.  His family seemed to love and respect him which allowed him to be so prolific.  I was amazed at the sophisticated abstractions. I wonder if his deafness allowed him to see his world more acutely had he not been deaf.,1385596800,2,384,4.380281690140845
3821469,5,B001VEC88G,A well done documentary about a unique and talented individual that showed the world what art can do.  He made use of materials that we usually.throw out. Mr. Castle used this trash as his canvas. Using soot as his medium painted and drew images that told of his wonderful life.,1438300800,,278,4.56
3821470,5,B001VEC88G,"I very much enjoyed this documentary about a little know untrained artist who worked with basic tools and every day trash as his media. It was fascinating to see how his art evolved over the course of his life and how it was very much shaped by his childhood exposure to his parents occupation and his years in the school for the deaf. His recurring themes through different media, repetition of shape, and formation of his own letter-like objects are just amazing. You don't have to be an art snob to enjoy this, in fact, I could see art snobs turning up their art snob noses at this topic. It was refreshing to see how a deaf artist who never mastered speech and was, in many ways, shut in his own world choose to express himself. Watch it now!",1438214400,,746,4.374100719424461

3821473,5,B001VEC88G,"Fascinating look at an amazing artist, self-taught and deaf, he observed and drew his world.  He used any surface, even labels removed from cans and other cast off paper.

8346156,4,B001VEC88G,Very little coldly academic and overly cerebral deconstruction of the art; but rather a clear-sighted and honest look at a unique person doing unique work. The family members were given as much on-screen time as the collectors and were very helpful in understanding what I saw. I very much enjoyed this film.,1439683200,,308,4.9423076923076925
