2417465,3,B000BI5YYI,The permanent Spanish sub-titles override the English making it hard and in some cases impossible to read.  I did not know the Spanish could not be removed.,1372636800,5,156,4.777777777777778
2417466,5,B000BI5YYI,"This is terrific and I show it to my students in full every year. The volcanologists providing commentary, as well as the reenacted scenes, maintain the interest of even middle-schoolers!",1368576000,,187,5.266666666666667
2417467,5,B000BI5YYI,I consider this an exceptional movie. Draws entirely on the diaries and eyewitness accounts of those who survived the violent eruption of Krakatoa. This is a recommended addition to the studies and cold facts one hears or reads most about the eruption. .,1357171200,3,254,4.930232558139535
2417468,5,B000BI5YYI,"I've been interested in Krakatoa and vulcanology in general for decades, and this is the best DVD I've found on the subject.  Forget the bad movie that placed the volcano at the wrong end of Java.  In 1883 virtually the entire island west of Java exploded, creating the loudest sound in recorded history.  Thousands were killed, mostly by the tsunami that was created.  Weather around the globe was affected for years.  Sunsets were spectacular for a decade.  This DVD realistically re-creates the event, to the point that the viewer will be on the edge of his chair watching it.

The volcano has exploded before, centuries ago, geologists have determined.  Now it is rebuilding and will explode again when the presure has built up sufficiently.  We will all be gone by then, likely, and the generation that experiences it will probably not have learned a lesson from the 1883 tragedy.

I would also recommend the Simon Winchester book on the subject.  It is a detailed account, focusing on the history of the Dutch in the region and the effect the catastrophe had on commerce.",1317513600,4,1077,4.830601092896175
2417469,5,B000BI5YYI,"Imagine that you're standing on the beach of a beautiful island; suddenly, the ground starts shaking, the beach splits open, and fire comes shooting up out of it! This isn't fiction, it's real. The special effects of this movie/documentary, are stunning! The Aug. 27th, 1883 eruption(s) of Krakatoa created giant tsunamis: waves of up to 135 ft. high according to one reputable source. The four eruptions on that morning were ""truly cataclysmic,"" and when you see this movie, you'll understand why. One of the eruptions was, to this day, the ""loudest sound ever heard in recorded history""... anyone within 10 miles of the Aug. 27th eruptions had their ear drums burst instantly.

The producers, directors, writers, actors... everyone who put this thing together did a masterful job, in my opinion. The scientific and historic aspects of the ""Great Eruption"" are presented clearly, and very effectively. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in volcanoes in general, or anyone who has heard of Krakatoa but knows little or nothing about it.",1308873600,6,1059,5.121387283236994
2417470,5,B000BI5YYI,"Advertised as simply ""Krakatoa"" this DVD is actually ""Krakatoa: los ultimos dias.""  The packaging and the DVD menus are in Spanish.  The program on the DVD is the English-language NTSC version of the BBC docudrama ""Krakatoa: The Final Days"" with yellow Spanish subtitles.  The final days are the days leading up to the eruption of Krakatoa on August 26, 1883.  The story is historically accurate and the volcano/tsunami effects are first rate.  Like most of the BBC's better offerings, this is a slightly dramatized retelling of actual events from the viewpoint of the participants.  That approach works well here.  An excellent product.",1308355200,10,637,5.186274509803922
2417471,5,B000BI5YYI,"The documentary ""Krakatoa"" produced by the PBS network really delivers an amazingly realistic and thorough re-creation of this most massive 1883 volcanic event.  This DVD is 90 minutes long, and unlike some releases of docs that were originally made for TV it does not feature the rather annoying tendency to 're-cap' the story elements after every 'commercial' break - the story moves smoothly along following the time line of events leading up to and including the eruption & its' aftermath.  As the film explains, the Krakatoa event was one of the first major volcanic eruptions to be widely recorded and studied by the technologies available in the Victorian age, as well as eye witness accounts.  The documentary focuses a bit on some modern vulcanologists who are studying the vestigial remains of Krakatoa and they bring insights into the latest theories of the geologic mechanisms at work behind the explosian, but the majority of the program is devoted to excellent re-creations of the actual period of the eruption.  Based on the notes of several individuals who actually experienced the eruption virtually every aspect of the event is reproduced with high quality digital special fx, archival photos, and historic dramatizations.  Thanks to the advances in CGI  spfx technology the awesome natural forces unleashed by Krakatoa have been very realistically portrayed in this doc - this includes scenes of the progessive set of eruptions leading to the ultimate big blow and the resultant 150 foot high tidal wave that devastated the surrounding coastal towns (and the steamship that rode out the tsunami!) - with a quality equal to the biggest budget Hollywood block-busters. After the dramatic portrayal of the eruption the film winds down with a description of the the far ranging effects of the event around the world & a look at how the decimated island of Krakatoa is again being re-built by geologic forces toward a potential similar future explosion. For people who are fascinated by historic volcanic cataclysms this documentary should be completely satisfying!",1304640000,6,2079,5.209580838323354
2417472,4,B000BI5YYI,"For most people nowadays, the word ""Krakatoa"" may bring a vague impression of a volcano erupting a long time ago. That's true as far as it goes -- Krakatoa erupted in 1883 -- but it was much more than a simple eruption. The island, part of the archipelago now known as Indonesia -- blasted itself out of existence in a series of cataclysmic explosions that are the largest in recorded history.

This 90-minute documentary combines re-enactment with contemporary interviews of experts on volcanos and the mighty underground forces that cause them to erupt. The video follows several characters who lived near the island, from Dutch officials and their families to natives of the area. Many of the latter believed that the volcanic eruptions that plagued the island chain from time to time were the result of angry gods. Western officials understood some of the geographical forces that caused the eruptions, but the science was considerably less advanced than it is now.

One point the video does make plain is that, while the falling ash and pumice from the volcano did cause damage, the huge tsunamis generated by the eruptions cause the most death and destruction. While the tsunamis in Southeast Asia and Japan were not caused by volcanic eruptions, the similarities to Krakatoa are all too plain.

I found this an educational, easy-to-digest lesson in the unpredictability of what we generally choose to see as ""solid ground.""",1302912000,6,1430,5.025316455696203
2417473,4,B000BI5YYI,"The special effects in this movie will blow you away.  I agree with the first reviewer on that.  However the rest comes across a little bit like a Nova show by the PBS.  Unlike the DVD by the BBC which is only available in region 2, it does not develop the stories of the individual characters and have you live through the events.  In this movie they jump around a lot and the stories never seem to leave you caring.  There is heavy emphasis on the geology and modern geologists as well as historical geologists and vulcanologists and the story in the movie is interrupted so much by this that it can be frustrating.  You will have the feeling afterwards that you understand what happened and will experience some of the horror of the Dutch and native peoples as a 100 foot tidal wave crashes ashore followed hours later by an even bigger one. However, the actual volcanic explosion at the end is done with such simple graphics that you get no personal feeling of the destruction. Some actual footages I had never seen before on the tidal wave destruction from the earthquake in 2003 were stunning.  A twenty foot wave did all that and you wonder if the movie makers couldn't have shown what a 100 foot one had done in 1883.",1198972800,12,1225,4.466367713004484
2417474,5,B000BI5YYI,"This is a re-enactment as well as a documentary.  The combination of actual footage of natural disasters with CGI imagery, along with the very well re-created people and scenery of the 19th century is superb.  The scope of destruction that was unleashed by this volcano is unbelievable.  Watch it on a big screen TV with surround sound.  You'll feel like the world is coming to an end.  It's as exciting and jaw-dropping as any effects-laden blockbuster movie, but without being corny, because as over-the-top as it might be were it fiction, this actually happened.",1179446400,31,565,4.968085106382978
8086966,5,B000BI5YYI,"I watch this video every so often because it is such an awesome true story.  It is done very well, the acting and effects are superb.",1472515200,,133,4.115384615384615
8086967,4,B000BI5YYI,I love this film but not the quality of this DVD.  Whoever recorded it added huge red lettered Spanish captions that be turned off.  No extra features at all.  The captions remain the entire film.  There are no options at all.  The quality of this DVD is lacking as well.  The picture is a little blurry and the caption thing distracting.  But it is the only DVD out there.  I give this DVD 4*s because I like the acting & storyline; and because of the poor quality of this rerecording.,1464912000,,486,4.322222222222222
8086968,4,B000BI5YYI,Enjoyed the video.,1442966400,,18,5.333333333333333
8086969,5,B000BI5YYI,"I like the mixture of documentary and dramatization. It's an amazing history, although a tragic one in places.",1437436800,,110,5.166666666666667
8086970,5,B000BI5YYI,So glad I was finally able to find this.  I like the fact that it's a blend of documentary and drama.,1418774400,,101,3.8095238095238093
8086971,5,B000BI5YYI,"Wasn't expecting a film with Spanish titles, but (in English) it was actually better than the film I'd taped from TV years ago.
And since I inadvertently loused up the latter with experimental taping, I decided I'd better keep this.  Also, while watching,
I was looking at the Spanish subtitles trying to see how much I could understand.",1414281600,,337,4.810344827586207
8086972,5,B000BI5YYI,The scariest thought is that it WILL OCCUR AGAIN! This documentary certainly shows how unprepared the majority of the people on the surrounding islands were. Hopefully  they learned a terrible lesson.,1399766400,,200,5.451612903225806
8086973,5,B000BI5YYI,"Well done story based on diaries from the time.  The dialogue is in English but there are white Spanish subtitles (not closed captioning) added during the DVD production.  But this is a standard Region 1 DVD designed for US and Canadian players, not one designed for foreign countries.  On occasion when the dialogue is in Dutch, there are yellow English subtitles from the movie and White Soanish ones added during the DVD manufacture.  But the story comes through loud and clear once you get used to them and seeing the Spanish translations can actually be interesting.",1395878400,2,571,4.916666666666667
8086974,5,B000BI5YYI,This documentary was great. The computer animation was excellent and the build up to the eruption was very well done. I highly recommend this film.,1392336000,,147,4.92
8086975,2,B000BI5YYI,This was a disappointment... they blatantly changed the story and the facts from the PBS original version - that was a surprise!,1391904000,,128,4.863636363636363
