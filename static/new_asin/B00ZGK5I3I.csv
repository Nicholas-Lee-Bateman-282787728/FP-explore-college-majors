7282207,5,B00ZGK5I3I,"Solid Fred Olen Ray.  The blu-ray transfer is superlative.  The interviews in the extras are full of interesting tidbits.  The commentary is the star of the whole package.  Tons of info and fun stories.  The movie itself is probably a 3/5, though it's more entertaining than most would give it credit for. Ultimate Collector's item.  Way better than the movie Scalps.",1435968000,4,367,4.934426229508197
7282208,5,B00ZGK5I3I,"Many of you who have seen this movie already know what it's about, to those new or curious, its a low budget gore fest science fiction horror about an alien creature that has landed on Earth. The creature is using a psychic , the lovely Angelique Pettyjohn to assist in the creatures hostile takeover. Its pretty gory with tons of blood and frothing from the mouth. Is it a good movie ? Judge for yourself, as we all have different tastes
The presentation of the blu ray is excellent - sharp colors, good contrast, grain structure intact. Audio is good too. And it has a few cool extras as well to enjoy - overall its a great release.",1435363200,10,634,4.38135593220339

8720215,3,B00ZGK5I3I,"I saw an episode of Star Trek with one of the female stars of this movie, and I was curious about it, so I ordered it from Amazon.  Well, it's not quite the type of movie I care for, having a horror vibe combined with other strange things that don't really make much sense.  It's almost as if they changed the type of movie they were trying to make in the middle of it all, changed their minds again, and then again, etc.  If they were trying for weird, they nailed it, so to speak.",1479600000,3,482,4.052631578947368
8720216,1,B00ZGK5I3I,"Terrible film, certainly not got the same joy as Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers by same dude.",1472515200,,89,5.0
8720217,1,B00ZGK5I3I,"Soooo stupid, horrible special effects and the alien is clearly a little boy wearing a tight spandex type outfit with rober gloves and mask.. Everything about this movie is terrible, story, effects, acting, EVERYTHING!!",1441152000,,219,5.470588235294118
8720218,5,B00ZGK5I3I,"This was a blind buy for me, and it was sure worth it. I was previously familiar with Angelique Pettyjohn through her work on Star Trek, and I'm a huge sucker for 70s and 80s sci-fi and horror films.

Biohazard delivered on all levels, offering an interesting premise and enough suspense and action to keep you interested. This is the sort of film that fits right in with movies like Galaxy of Terror, Forbidden World, Contamination, etc. If stuff like that is up your alley, then so will this be.

The BluRay presentation itself is excellent, offering a crisp, clean video image with lots of color and plenty of image depth. There has been no discernible DNR or image cleanup applied, so you will still see the occasional piece of dirt or white speck. On the flipside, that means the image remains sharp and well defined. The audio is offered in a robust Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo track that is well balanced and sounds great.

Highly recommended.",1438041600,3,947,4.658682634730539
