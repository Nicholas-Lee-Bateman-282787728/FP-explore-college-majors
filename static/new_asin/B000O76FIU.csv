8183316,3,B000O76FIU,"The ""Shock Cinema Collection"" is a four DVD set loosely categorized by subject. I have always enjoyed B-movies, and was interested to see this video because of some of the people interviewed and techniques illustrated. The first two discs are superior to volumes three and four by a significant margin. Disc one features interesting interviews with influential B-movie directors such as J. R. Bookwalter (who was heavily involved with the production and direction of this set) and the always interesting Fred Olen Ray. Disc two features interviews with B-movie stars, editors, cinematographers, etc., and is also moderately interesting.

Disc three focuses on bloopers, gore, and the women of the B-movie world, and features clips from some truly dreadful movies, the worst of which is ""Robot Ninja,"" which I have seen in its entirety, and disliked even more when excerpted here. The bloopers were the lamest I have ever seen: they weren't entertaining or amusing; they were, however, repetitive and boring. Disc three was a letdown by any standard.

Disc four focused on makeup and special effects, and was interesting from a technical standpoint, although the interviews tended to be monotonous.

This is a low budget DVD set which seems appropriate given the subject matter. People who are interested in B-movies and the technical aspects of filmmaking may like the set, but even the presence of host Brinke Stevens won't save it for non-enthusiasts.

The bottom line? The concept here was better than the execution.",1192579200,12,1519,5.213114754098361
