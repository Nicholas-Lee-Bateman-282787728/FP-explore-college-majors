8071210,4,B000A0GXUG,"Hard to find sequel to ""Rock 'n' Roll Nightmare"". The film was not as good as the original but the soundtrack helps make up for that. Was reasonably priced.",1489190400,,156,4.413793103448276
8071211,1,B000A0GXUG,"I love a good bad movie. Rock n Roll Nightmare was a great one, I was excited to see a sequel and while some of the reviews were questionable. I knew the first one's reviews would've been bad too. Bit OMG there's barely a plot and it's not clear. Thor isn't utilized enough, come on he's the star of the first one. I swear some of the graphics are worse then the first movie and they were bad n a funny way. These were just bad n a cheap way. Save the $5",1483056000,,454,3.89247311827957
8071212,1,B000A0GXUG,"What an atrocious mess.

Like the other reviewer stated, I have a high tolerance for bad b-movies.  The original was a bad movie - but it was entertaining nonetheless.  I try to seek these movies out to watch with friends.  This movie does not fall into that category.  This is just indescribably bad.  I do not know how everyone involved could watch the final product and not want to burn any existing hard-copies as well as all the original footage.  If you walked up to the line at a methadone clinic and handed them a camera and said ""Go!"" I bet they would come up with something more enjoyable and professional than this.  I did not know it was possible to be this inept at every level of film, but yet here we are.  Now I am just left to ponder what resource I wasted more - the time I spent watching this or the $6 I spent on it...",1452211200,,838,4.1875
8071213,5,B000A0GXUG,What a mess this movie is. Cheaply made and terribly acted. The plot makes no sense at all and I bet even Stephen Hawking and Neil DeGrasse Tyson working together couldn't figure it out. Still an enjoyable bad movie for bad movie night.,1420243200,,236,4.511627906976744
8071214,1,B000A0GXUG,"As has been noted, ""Rock N Roll Nightmare"" is one of those so-bad-it's-good films, a lot of fun to watch.  This sequel is simply God-awful, shot on cheap video with thrift-store costumes on the worst actors I've ever seen.  Five writers are credited, I can only assume they weren't allowed to show their work to each other.  There's some vague plot about a comic-drawing kid who fights zombies, but that gets abandoned halfway through (except for the tomato-surprise ending) so we can watch Jon Mikl Thor fight to save a little girl's dreams.  At one point, the little girl kicks the Demon Lord in the shin and you can see the actor wasn't expecting that at all--probably the film's highlight.

The only thing of any entertainment value is in the behind-the-scenes footage.  As we see several actors try to say their lines in front of a green screen, someone animated a little crown of flame over the studio's cat.  The cat walks around with this flame and it's so much more entertaining than anything else on the DVD.  If you're a really big fan of cats with animated flames, well...this DVD still isn't worth it.  Anything else positive?  Well, the case is made of very nice plastic, it might make a good booster under some plants or something.

I tried to bring this DVD to the local used video store, and they wouldn't take it.  They didn't even want to touch it, and I can't say I blame them.",1273190400,3,1397,4.566265060240964
8071215,1,B000A0GXUG,"This movie is woeful.
The first movie was a bad movie, but so bad, it was good. This is just bad.
Boring and with no charm. I would give this 0/10 if possible.",1260403200,3,159,3.8484848484848486
8071216,1,B000A0GXUG,"As the second reviewer here, let me just state that Anthony's review is SPOT-ON!! I read his review before purchasing, but failed to heed the warning. The bad movie lover in me just couldn't resist the latest Jon Mikl Thor offering....and I paid dearly, not only am I out a couple of bucks for the flick itself, but I've also lost eighty minutes of my life I'll never get back, and this flick may have done some permanent damage to my health and well being.

First of all, let me say that ""Rock n' Roll Nightmare"", Jon Mikl Thor's 80's hair metal band vs. satanic sock puppets flick is a personal favorite. It's awful for sure, but enjoyably awful in a ""Hard Rock Zombies"" kind of way. ""Intercessor: Another Rock n' Roll Nightmare"" is simply awful. Shot on someone's camcorder with rejects from the community dinner theater, I was truly embarassed watching this film. Jon Mikl Thor sporting a goofy costume rummaged from your local Halloween Costume shop sets out to save a little girl from Mephisto, and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, as well as some girls representing the elements?! Seeing a 50 something Jon Mikl Thor running around with his gut pooched out, donning a rubber gladiator mask did tickle my funny bone initially, and watching the truly laughable fight scenes with digital effects slapped on in post-production was also worth a giggle...initially. But after an hour or so, it just got repetitive and extremely dull.
I will say the soundtrack isn't bad. Say what you will about Thor's acting and fight choreography, he can still rock out. But do yourself a favor, if interested in the tunes, run down the soundtrack as it's available...don't buy this flick, it will cause you too much pain and humiliation. Take it from someone who had to learn it the hard way.",1234224000,5,1783,4.714743589743589
8071217,1,B000A0GXUG,"If you are a fan of ""Rock and Roll Nightmare,"" avoid this title like the plague.  I have a very high tolerance for bad B movies, but this movie disappointed me.  Yep, compared to the schlockfest that was ""Rock and Roll Nightmare,"" this was terrible.  How do you make a sequel to a bad movie shot in a week with the producers friends for $50,000 and turn out a grossly inferrior product?  I love B movies, but this made me want to sue to get the 90 minutes of my life back.  I had low expectations for ""Rock and Roll Nightmare,"" but it was very enjoyable in a ""Plan 9"" kind of way.  I did not expect ""Citizen Cain,"" but this movie had me longing for the production values of ""Manos"" or ""Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-a-Rama,"" or even ""Rock and Roll Nightmare.""  Even if you are a fan of B movies, please avoid this.  It really hurts.",1229040000,7,839,4.232704402515723
