8310101,3,B001HYSXRU,"I like the fact that the movie is funny because of the situational irony portrayed in it. The movie is a romantic comedy. My favorite character is the one played by the child actor Octavio Ca~nas. However, I give the movie a score of 3 for its unnecessary use of bad language.",1403827200,,276,4.326923076923077
