8297438,5,B001EAWMBK,"This movie is more than worth a look. If you've ever struggled with loss or addiction this is a must see film. If your simply a fan of Martin Cummins then this film is a must see that gives you a unique insight unto the man behind the camera. It's a very powerfully moving peice of art that does not glamorize addiction at all but shows the cold hard truth about addicts. A very human film done with alot of love,respect and passion and i'm glad I got to see the labor of their love.",1245369600,4,483,4.094736842105263
