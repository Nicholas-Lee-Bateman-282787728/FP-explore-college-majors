8299123,5,B001EOJI9U,"My only complaint is that I was not warned in the sellers description that the video I would receive is PAL and in Italian and French only.  I watched it anyway on my computer in Italian.  The scenery and the villa where this is filmed is spectacular and the movie story follows the short story it's based on, pretty closely, it appears.  It was fun to see the characters in the story brought to life onscreen.  I would love to see this in German or English.  I was kind of expecting Ehrengard to be more Germanic.",1518307200,,514,4.3125
8299124,4,B001EOJI9U,"I read ""Ehrengard"" partly because I was on my way to Denmark, for the 20-somethingth time in 20 years, to lead a group of women on a tour of the country. One stop was the home of Karen Blixen/Izak Dinesen. I also reread ""Babette's Feast"" in the same volume. I knew ""Babette"" from the film and previous reading. I had no notion of ""Ehrengard."" The former is a more realistic tale. The latter is clearly a form of fairy tale, all the more interesting as it is purportedly the last work Dinesen ever wrote and was published after her death. It is a statement of the triumph of a strong woman over a conniving man. And, that is, in many ways, the story of Dinesen's life. Some say she was a seducer, not sexual but spiritual. I cannot judge. The Italian movie attempted to capture the spirit of the story. That's all I can say.",1414454400,,823,4.316129032258065
8299125,5,B001EOJI9U,"Poetic touch on everything. Persons are archtypes, olympic gods projected in humans. Beautiful, unforgettable. Direction better than Gabriel Axel's oscarwinning ""Babette."" (Even though this film is wonderfull too!) Please get Ehrengard back in stock. :-)",1323216000,,254,6.285714285714286
