7873979,5,6304551053,"Look - my kids and nephews dug it. Its a nice break from the disney stuff they watch over and over and over. kids love planes and this video has a bunch of technical stuff for older kids to dig. lot of good plane shots. some stupid animation, but so what- shrek it aint. kept the kids happy and they learned a bunch. give it a thumbs up.",1094342400,,337,3.9705882352941178
7873980,5,6304551053,"I completely disagree with the last reviewer. Both my 3 year old and my 5 year old love this video... we've worn out one copy already. I hope they release it on DVD.

First off, the last reviewer had a problem with the fact that the host is wacky and tries to fly around like a plane. Guess what -- the kids love it when he does. He's actually pretty funny for us adults -- a welcome change from so many of the super-sweet kid's show hosts.

I personally learned a lot about planes watching this video. I know my kids did. One great thing is the video didn't talk down to them -- it actually gave them information they could both understand and remember.

Sure the production values aren't Disney, but hey, neither is the Crocodile Hunter (which also has a wacky host). Bottom line, my kids -- and their friends love the video and have actually learned a few things about the ""life"" of a plane.",1092873600,,894,4.309523809523809
7873981,2,6304551053,"This video may have some toddler appeal, but that doesn't change the fact that it appears to have been made by a couple of community college film students with access to an aircraft carrier and military base. Surely, none of the people interviewed could have anticipated how goofy and unprofessional the whole thing would be. There is actually some very badly lit footage of two people tossing a frisbee inside an arena in this video. Yipee.

 The premise is that the host wants to find out where planes sleep and goes around asking people. He also asks about other things he sees on the way and is pretty irreverent. Seeing the guy running around with his arms out like an airplane as pilots on the tarmack watch on wondering if he's mentally stable is amusing exactly once. I'm not even sure my 3 year old really liked the antics either. Perhaps children have to be a bit older to get it.

 (...)
 I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because there are actually some good shots of planes, and some interesting info about hand signals used on aircraft carriers. If you can get this for free, it might be good for 30 minutes of distraction, but there are many, many better choices.",1091750400,,1179,4.516431924882629
