6095074,3,B00GOC75XI,These didn't turn out to be my favorites but all in all they are a really good deal and they get me through my work outs.,1422748800,2,121,3.6923076923076925
6095075,2,B00GOC75XI,"4 movies on each disk. Too much compression. Bought it for widescreen copy of Moscow on Hudson. It is widescreen, but picture quality is not awful but definitely below expectations.",1421798400,7,181,5.066666666666666

6095079,2,B00GOC75XI,"If you want to witness degradation of young people and casual sexual encounters, you will not be disappointed. Coarse language, young people with no self esteem, reflection of our missing moral compass. What kind of writers do we have now? Are they on drugs? Nothing entertaining and senseless plots.",1406246400,7,300,5.142857142857143
6095080,2,B00GOC75XI,"I bought these  ""chick flicks"" to watch on my treadmill. As of now I have seen half the movies. I thought the quality was expected with price, I cannot use subtitles (which come in handy on treadmill) and so far I have thought all four movies were a little strange and depressing. Not your average happy Hollywood movies. They seem to be B movie story-lines.",1406160000,5,358,4.507692307692308
6095081,5,B00GOC75XI,"Don't know a single thing about any of the other movies in this collection, but if you have been searching high and low for Moscow on the Hudson IN WIDESCREEN, this is how you get it- it has not been released to date (2014) as such. I bought this collection at a Love's truck stop in Oklahoma, just for MOH because it said it was widescreen on the label, popped it into my laptop in the parking lot, and am now writing this review to confirm that we can now see one of the best lesser known movies of the 80's in its full glory.",1396742400,31,528,4.038095238095238
6095082,4,B00GOC75XI,I love to unwind with good movies sometimes on the weekends. My husband does not like chick flicks so I have a TV/DVD player in a spare bedroom all women should have one. :),1394841600,7,173,4.117647058823529

6095084,5,B00GOC75XI,"I originally bought this just for the movie ""Moscow on the Hudson"", which is one of my favorite movies, but the other movies on the disc are all very funny and entertaining. They are great movies for date night with the wife. The product arrived on time and in great condition. I would definitely order from the seller again.",1467072000,2,325,4.52542372881356
6095085,5,B00GOC75XI,"I got this for Moscow on the Hudson and Sweethearts Dance.  Both are great.  In Moscow on the Hudson, Robin Williams defects from Russia to the U.S. It's funny and poignant and a great movie.  Sweethearts Dance is a great chick flick about new relationships and damaged ones that have the potential to heal (thank God -- we throw them away so easily it seems).",1466985600,2,360,4.507692307692308

6095099,1,B00GOC75XI,"These are grade  B movies.  I've watched 2 so far, and they were AWFUL.  Do not bother with this collection unless you want a collection of second rate, 1970s movies--the ones that would never survive as individual discs.",1439078400,4,221,4.7631578947368425

8625456,1,B00GOC75XI,"Purchased for Moscow on the Hudson, which I like.  Unfortunately the picture quality is just awful due to the manufacturer compressing 4 movies onto a single side of a disc.  In addition, the case itself arrived damaged.  Disappointing - due to the poor image quality, I will not even attempt watching the other 7 movies.",1497225600,2,321,4.8
