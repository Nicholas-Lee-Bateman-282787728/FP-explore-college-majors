4460807,5,B004RE4HRW,The video is broken into era's so you can watch one era at a time. At over 4 hours you get a very comprehensive account of this historic race. Should be high on anyone's list of must see films about racing.,1328572800,3,206,4.048780487804878

8439020,5,B004RE4HRW,"Since I was a little boy I know of the Isle of Man! I was born in 1958 to English parents... and growing up in northern California I'd try to tell my motorcycle crazy friends about ""the Island."" They thought I was goofy! I know far more about the place that I can write, I know too as much as I wanted to race there (and I'm an accomplished road racer & motocrosser) it was impossible to get US motorcycle sponsors to hand me the cash to go to the Island. A bit of Island history has sat in my dads garage in Calif since 1966 when he brought home a 1929 Sunbeam 500 road racer (which was later ID'ed by Charlie Dodson who won the Senior TT in 1929!).
My dad was on the Island a number of times, with 4 wheels though, as in Aston Martin, where they won the TT in '54. Dad knew Geoff Duke too, an Island LEGEND, and in '53 dad went to the Manx GP with Geoff and rode as a course marshal, falling off at Ramsey hairpin! Many don't know cars raced at the Island... Q: Know what make won the first TT race in 1907? A ROVER!
When this first came out on VHS I bought it for dad, we watched the bikes and riders, some of whom dad knew personally, like Stanley Woods he boyhood Idol. The course is an eye opener and not for the faint hearted, but the racing, even today, it's awesome and like no other in the world! I too met Geoff Duke while racing my Ducati's in Canada in 1990, and rec'd from him after the 500cc race the best compliment ever; ""I've never in all my days of racing witnessed a start like that!"" I started 64th on the grid (last minute entry that Geoff himself convinced the promoters at Westwood to let me and my 350cc Ducati compete in the 500c race); From 64th on the start to 8th by turn-2 on opening lap! At race end I was up alongside the leader as we crossed the line! Lost by the width of a tyre!
Enough of me, watch the old boys go at it... The lap record in 1929 was an amazing 73.55 mph (if memory serves), in 1929!!!! That's over 100mph coming down the Mtn!. Then watch Geoff, Surtees, and of course Hailwood & Ago! What an era! Now the madness of the speeds of the modern bikes is mindblowing. It's must see film for any motorcycle racer.",1363305600,,2160,4.060889929742388
8439021,5,B004RE4HRW,Starts way back with hand cranked film. Amazing to see the track in the old days with the same turns only dirt instead of road. A great overview of the Isle of Mann. Funky old bikes and crazy riders.,1362441600,,199,4.128205128205129
8439022,4,B004RE4HRW,I was disappointed that the story does not even mention the Britten effort from New Zealand on one of the most innovative machines ever built it also leaves out the crash that took the life of Mark Farmer.  It is as if the team from NZ did not even exist.,1362355200,,255,4.1
8439023,3,B004RE4HRW,"It got so many stellar reviews, so I was expecting riveting commentary, deep production values, and amazing play-by-play commentaries.  While the research and entirety of Isle of Man TT was exhaustive, it was quite honestly exhausting.  There's a large bulk of the history which only a devoted fan would enjoy, but at some point it traverses from historical review of this rare and dangerous race to simply a narrated almanac of sorts.

The TT can truly be broken down into 3 eras (as alluded to by the cover art) and from which they could have explored a more cohesive story-telling instead of the snores-ville in some sections.

Pros:  Some great footage, rare vintage bikes, in-depth research
Cons:  Some truly boring parts, feels like it could have been shortened considerably without losing punch",1360800000,,801,5.03030303030303
8439024,5,B004RE4HRW,Watched every thing I ever wanted to know about the TT worth the money you won't be disappointed will be bying others just like it,1360454400,,130,4.24
8439025,5,B004RE4HRW,"This is a great film showing you the evolution of the TT, the motorcycles and their riders. A long film to be enjoyed and appreciated by any motorcycle enthusiast.",1357344000,,163,4.655172413793103
8439026,5,B004RE4HRW,The Isle of Man TT is the most historic and difficult race around with great races dating back to 1907.  This is a great compilation of info about the races.,1355443200,,157,4.233333333333333
