In the near future books are outlawed so there is a war fought at the public library to protect freedom of thought. This film has lost of police shootouts, explosions, some romance, some comedy and plenty of fun.",1426464000,,303,4.333333333333333
8635583,4,B00HSSXXQK,"I enjoyed the movie very much!  The casting is excellent, and it brought to life my favorite characters from the manga.  The film adaptation is more action-oriented.  There are a couple of intense gun battles.  There is less emphasis on the politics of the MBC,  and less emphasis on the training and social aspects of the Library Defense Force.

The only big down-side to this film is the truly awful sub.  In one scene the sub literally read, ""XXX"" ""XXX"".  The translator just gave up on this bit of dialog!  In a few other places, the Japanese-to-English was grammatically incorrect.  Still, I love the story, and know it well, so it didn't stop me from enjoying the film",1414454400,2,674,4.635593220338983
