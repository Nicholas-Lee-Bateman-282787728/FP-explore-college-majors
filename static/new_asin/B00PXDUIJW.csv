8689704,3,B00PXDUIJW,"Disappointed in the sense that my ""illusion"" of what the nuns were up to in the monasteries was broken. Grateful to see the truth..... but like I said disappointed... to find out that nuns are actually on facebook? and actually carrying cellphones? who supplies the monies for the cellphones and treats they buy? seems like a contradiction to monastic life....and ""attachment"" to some of the thing that hold most in the the modern world hostage....",1426118400,,448,4.986666666666666

8689708,5,B00PXDUIJW,"A touching documentary! Daughters of Dolma presents us the monastic life of Tibetan nuns without forgetting how deeply human such experience is. Instead of portraying their lives as a straightforward path towards spiritual enlightenment, the film shows us how such journey is deeply interlaced with social issues, such as the co-existence of traditional and modern ways of living and thinking, the expected roles of children within family life, and the position of women within patriarchal societies. The interviewees are much fun and very inspiring women. By showing how the nuns are, after all, human beings (!) leading their life journeys with challenges familiar to all of us, the film made me have a different view of spirituality, and actually made me more open to the idea and encouraged me to learn more about Buddhist teachings.",1424131200,,837,5.207407407407407
