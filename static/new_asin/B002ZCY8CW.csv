4015328,4,B002ZCY8CW,"With Season 2 of ""Nurse Jackie,"" Jackie Peyton has officially eclipsed Nancy Botwin as the most fascinating and complex lead female character on a current cable show. Before ""Weeds"" started floundering, the show was about a complicated, more or less ordinary woman with both good intentions and some nasty secrets. Nurse Jackie's character (fleshed out by Edie Falco's superb, nuanced performance) offers all that and then some.

If the ending of Season 1 had it looking like Jackie's drug abuse and infidelity were going to finally come out in the open, well, not so much. After all, drug addicts are slippery and manipulative people, and in the beginning of the season, Jackie is able to keep leading her double life without disastrous consequences. But as the Season goes on, and Jackie's actions become more and more desperate and reckless, it looks like at least a few of the people around her are, at the very least, onto her.

While Jackie's storyline keep progressing, Season Two did a very good job of making all of the supporting characters much more interesting and fleshed-out. Miss Acolytes, a wasted character in the first season, comes into her own as the hospital's thick-skinned, yet good- hearted, administrator. Nurse MoMo's role as token gay and male nurse has been replaced by two much more interesting characters: Teddy Bear-ish Thor and recovering addict Sam. Idealistic Zo continues to grow professionally, and her romance with a sweet paramedic is probably the most endearing pairing on the show. And Dr. Cooper continues to flail about in his narcissistic, yet strangely endearing, way.

The characters closest to Jackie, husband Kevin, BFF Dr. O'Hara, and lover Eddie, all go down darker and more complicated roads this season. The cracks in Kevin and Jackie's marriage start showing dramatically, and Kevin starts to reveal he's not the doormat he seemed to be in the first season. Eddie's obsession with Jackie leads him to befriend her husband, and insert himself into Jackie's life in a, frankly, creepy way. And Dr. O'Hara, the consummate professional, seems lost in her personal life, dallying with both Nurse Sam and a female journalist, all the while living in a hotel.

In addition to all the drama of the hospital staff, some of the best moments of the series belonged to the guest stars playing patients and family. Although the focus of the series is usually the personal lives of Jackie and those closest to her, the show often works best when it takes time to focus on the kinds of situations intrinsic to working in a hospital ER. Jackie's strong, efficient, and compassionate handling of patients reminds the audience why, despite her many flaws and secrets; she's still a woman worth spending time with.

Overall, a strong second season to a strong series.",1282089600,30,2800,5.0
4015329,4,B002ZCY8CW,"Will there actually ever be any main plots within Nurse Jackie that are actually completed? So far it's looking like the answer to that question is a resounding ""No"".

At the end of season one (spoiler alert) we are left with Jackie Peyton unconscious on the floor after swallowing enough meds to tranq an elephant. You would think that there *might* be a little bit of fallout from that in the beginning of season two - but you'd be wrong. Not only is Jackie back at work on episode 1 of season 2, but apparently no one noticed the two missing vials of narcotics - or it's attributed to ""spillage"". While some may argue that it was shown later on that Jackie had access to the other Nurses' PINs for the Pill-o-matic, at the season finale of season one, we clearly saw that she logged into the machine as herself. Continuing on the ""zero resolution"" train, Dr. O'Hara's loss of her mother is completely glossed over in a single episode, and Eddie has now become the resident creepy stalker type.

Season two also lost Haaz Sleiman (Nurse MoMo) but gained Arjun Gupta (as the recovering drug addict, Nurse Sam); an unfortunate swap in my eyes, as MoMo was a much more interesting character than the one-dimensional Nurse Sam. Luckily Thor, Miss Akalitus, Dr. O'Hara, Dr. Cooper and Nurse Zoey have all stuck around.

The plot and character development in Season Two is all over the place with no apparent focus or relation to Season One. For instance whereas Dr. Cooper in Season One was a bright-faced young rookie of a Doctor who was wanting to make friends with everyone on staff, suddenly in season two he is the snitch, the whiner, and a backstabber. Pharmacist Eddie went from being the nice guy who was suckered by Jackie into a pseudo-stalker/psychopath and 100% jerk. While you felt some twinge of emotion for Eddie being the sucker in season one, in season two he's willing to destroy not only Jackie's life, but her husband and children's lives as well - at which point you wonder if he has any redeeming characteristics left.

By the time the season finale comes around, it once again feels like the entire house of cards is about to come crashing down around Jackie; but even this build up falls short when compared to season one. Unfortunately the ""shock and awe"" of the suspense looses some of its value when there's zero plot resolution in the storyline. When you're always wondering what's going to happen but never find out, well... it starts feeling like not even the show's producers actually know what's going on or where they want to go.

While my main review thus far has been pretty negative, I have to say that the show is still entertaining at its heart. There were quite a few moments in the series where I was laughing out loud or uttering a ""d'oh!' when something particularly bad happened to one of the characters. Also, the mini-plots encapsulated within a single episode are generally enjoyable and well executed (the episode with Harvey Fierstein pulled at your heartstrings and your funnybone just like it was supposed to). I believe that the main problem with season two is that the writers suddenly decided to give everyone a story, but with only 12 episodes in a season, there wasn't enough time to conclude any of them.",1276128000,25,3257,4.677137870855148
4015330,5,B002ZCY8CW,"I wasn't a big fan of this show after the first season, but ""Nurse Jackie"" really founds its mojo in Season 2. The series has a better overall rhythm the second time around. I found all of the characters to be much more likable than they were in Season 1, and I also think the show is a heck of a lot funnier now.

Season 2 picks up right where the first season left off. Jackie (brilliantly portrayed by Edie Falco) has to deal with the ramifications of her jealous lover, Eddie (Paul Schulze), discovering her little secret: that she is married with two children. Eddie has a very interesting way of dealing with the situation, which absolutely infuriated Jackie. Meanwhile, Jackie and Kevin's (Dominic Fumusa) oldest daughter, Grace, continues to struggle with her compulsion disorder this year. Over at the hospital, Dr. Cooper becomes ""The Face of All Saints"" as part of a hilarious advertising campaign. Zoey (Merritt Weaver) faces a pregnancy scare and explores several romantic options. O'Hara (Eve Best) reveals some interesting aspects of her personal life, and a new nurse (Arjun Gupta) clashes with Jackie in the worst possible way.

Overall, Season 2 was fantastic, and the finale was pretty climactic, so I'm very excited for Season 3.",1275955200,15,1249,4.886792452830188
4015331,4,B002ZCY8CW,"This time the show is a 4 or a 4.5.  With some work on the script regarding Jackie's motivation, it could easily go to a perfect 5.

I still have no inkling why Nurse Jackie is a drug addict.  I still view that as a flaw in the script.  I think there should be SOME inkling as to why she has gone off the deep end.  However, this season is much, much better straight across the board than season one.  Even if we don't know the why of her addiction, the show does an excellent job of showing HOW Nurse Jackie's life is coming apart as a result of her drug addiction. She gets trapped in all of her different lies to all the different people in her life. Since drug addiction is progressive, she cannot make it for even a short while now without a fix.  Her addiction is also costing her a fortune and she even steals drugs from a guy who is flat out with a seizure, who ends up being a dealer and comes after her.

The series is also quite good at depicting the mess and morass that is our present health care system.  By the time you finish watching season two, your most urgent hope will be that you don't get sick and need care.

I really hated Eddie in season one but even Eddie tries to help her this season as she spirals out of control.  He even rescues her husband one night.  Plus her husband and the woman doctor best friend are forced to get along and get together as Jackie worsens.

If you think Jackie is about to enter rehab, think again.  She finds it ludicrous that anyone could even think she is a drug addict. However, things are so serious that if I were her family member, with season three we would be opening in probate court for a commitment hearing for mandatory treatment. Plus no way would I let her near her kids and would get the court's backing to restrain contact with them.

I am looking forward to season three and Edie Falco is a wonderful actress who may well walk away with an Emmy this year.

4015443,5,B002ZCY8CW,"This show is very funny.  I've seen all seasons, but I don't want to share the ending with you.  Like I said the series has a lot of really humorous parts to it.  The subject of her addiction starts out slowly.  I don't know if any of you have experienced addiction either for yourself or someone close to you.  As the show continues, the seriousness of addiction finally comes into play.  The character is a genius at protecting the fact of her addiction and continuing it despite interventions.  I am a recovering addict myself, so this show really hit home for me and was very sobering as the series progressed.  I have to say though that it did give me a ton of laughs.  Nurse Jackie is an opportunity to have some laughs, but also learn something about life.",1483315200,,763,4.431654676258993

That scene would have made more sense if she did say Jesus was God because she was trying to convince a crazy person he was the nephew of God and therefore still God.
Other scenes push politics surrounding hot button issues in America, which would be fine if they showed both sides. But of course one side is designed to look like the idiot.",1458432000,,525,4.36734693877551

But one thing bothers me. Nurse Jackie and her husband went to high school together; they are supposed to be the same age. But actor Dominic Fumusa is 6 years younger than Edie Falco and looks more like 12-15 years younger. This bit of miscasting ruins the believability factor. They should have cast an older man in the husband role. But I suspect Edie Falco had a vote in the casting decisions, and she decided this is the guy she wanted to kiss and hug.

4016150,4,B002ZCY8CW,"The series still has the edgy quality of Season I, and Edie Falco is still absolutely amazing.  Her eyes are incredibly expressive.  The scene where she confronts Eddie in the pharmacy is remarkable; her eyes are burning with anger and resentment.  Still the plot suggests that the writers are getting a little desperate to keep the series going with something shocking.  Jackie keeps getting deeper and deeper into her addiction and we hope for her rehabilitation.  Coop shows moments of adult responsibility.  Kevin continues to play the angelic husband and father.  His only visible ""defect"" so far is that he is willing to drink while on the job, not a good idea for a bartender.  He is all too easily taken in by Eddie, not the typical behavior of a New York bartender.  All in all, well worth watching but not as good as Season I.",1404172800,,836,4.671232876712328

We buy it by the season and watch it when we are camping in our RV.",1385856000,,383,4.565217391304348
4016562,5,B002ZCY8CW,I love nurse Jackie ackie Rules Edie Falco plays the perfect drug addled nurse. The show gives you a different perspective of how drug addictions can easily take place in the medical field and how just because someone might have a drug issue it doesn't necessarily make them a useless drooling mess. Many addicts blend in and this show is an example of how.,1385078400,,357,4.59375

4016619,5,B002ZCY8CW,This is the best show on TV... point blank... This season is no different. There is not a single character that I don't enjoy on this show. From the drug abusing Jackie to the cute but crazy Zoey. The dialogue is brilliant and the stories compelling. This show never gets stale nor does it ever feel like it is trying too hard.,1375920000,,327,4.290322580645161
4016620,4,B002ZCY8CW,"No, the show's not particularly weird.  the weird part is seeing the glamorous and beautiful Carmella Soprano playing a decidedly middle class nurse who wears frumpy brown clothes and doesn't wear eye make up.  The show is really amusing largely because Falco is so engaging.  the other roles were well cast and they work well together.  it's not ER, or even MASH or St. Elsewhere but in all it's a pretty engaging show and good for a distraction.",1374969600,,447,4.6923076923076925
4016621,5,B002ZCY8CW,I started watching Nurse Jackie as soon as the First season came on DVD and I've gotten them all so far. I really do enjoy them. Might not be to the liking of many but I find them fun and I laugh a lot.,1374796800,,202,3.6136363636363638

4016668,5,B002ZCY8CW,"Really enjoyable series.  I wouldn't want to be living Jackie's life and I suspect it isn't all that realistic, but this is good escapism.",1372636800,,138,4.75
4016669,3,B002ZCY8CW,"Ok.  This show is pretty good, but not because there is much realistic nursing or because Jackie is that great of a nurse.  She consistently breaks the nursing code of ethics and acts like she is the above everyone when really her behavior is very suspect.  And the men in nursing stereotypes are tired and unrealistic.  The only two male nurses are gay men, one of whom is trying to sleep with the other?  Come on.  Men are especially prevalent in the ED and ICU settings.  There would be way more men in the setting of this show and there would be plenty of straight men.

But the drama isn't bad and it's easy to go on a bender watching this show.  It's nothing groundbreaking, but worth watching for sure.",1372291200,,709,4.392307692307693
4016670,3,B002ZCY8CW,"Ok, so Nurse Jackie is great, it's funny, dramatic, like nothing the world has ever seen before, or whatever. But they got rid of Momo? Not only was he one of the main characters, I felt that he contributed quite a bit to Jackie's character development and to the show's personality as a whole. The fact that they threw out a main character with no explanation whatsoever feels very sitcom to me. The producers say that they simply 'ran out of storyline' for Momo, but anyone who buys that isn't as addicted to TV as I am. Something shady went down. Maybe a little bit of oxycodone.... just saying.",1371686400,,598,4.495412844036697

4016692,5,B002ZCY8CW,This season Jackie is embroiled in more troubles.  Lies upon lies.  And thus she is confronted for her drug use by the two people who love her the most.  The last episode is quite compelling.,1370822400,,191,4.4

4016728,5,B002ZCY8CW,"Season 2 of ""Nurse Jackie"" is an excellent 3-DVD set.  Edie Falco is an amazing leading actress.  The character of Jackie Peyton becomes even more real as we see her wonderful qualities of fighting for the little guy who tries hard vs. her own internal demons.  Usually, a character who is an adulterer is hard for me to like.  With pathos, when Jackie says, ""It is possible to love two people at the same time,"" it breaks off a piece of my heart.  In the episode ""Apple Bong,"" she suggests that a cancer patient try marijuana when no prescription drugs are relieving his pain.  Dr. Cooper goes on a great moral crusade against Jackie for the recommendation, who nods and as usual just goes around him, showing him how to smoke from carving an apple.  Similarly, in ""Caregiver,"" she is infuriated when an elderly patient shows up and the caregiver who is paid to be with her every day is obviously committing fraud and neglect.  As the season comes to an end, we see her husband bring in Dr. O'Hara to confront Jackie's drug addiction that is financially ruining their family.  Part of what I take away from the series with each of the characters is how everyone in a position of responsibility is also a person with stresses and demands on them that they at times meet and at times buckle under.

Arjun Gupta plays the nurse Sam who has had a drug problem and in season two freaks out as Dr. Cooper steals his girlfriend.  He does an excellent job with so many levels.  Peter Fascinelli is amazing when you look at his work in the Twilight series as the serious elder of the vampire clan vs. his lighthearted turn as the emotionally stunted Fitch Cooper.  While both characters are doctors, their temperaments are so different that it is a wonder the same actor has such range.  Eve Best as Dr. O'Hara is riveting.  The DVD extra where she reviews her career from London to New York is fascinating, but her breezy self-involved turn as O'Hara has an amazing range.  In season two, we see her brief affair with nurse Sam in the chapel and her love affair with Julia Ormand who plays a television reporter.  Merritt Wever as Zoey also keeps smiles on our faces through the most dire of circumstances.

This series is well-written; and Season 2 keeps up the pace.  One of the reasons I buy the DVDs is because this show makes me want to watch it again from time to time.  The characters tick each other off routinely, but also care about each other.  In the end, it is the very fragile but very real humanity that makes this riveting television.  Enjoy!",1362355200,3,2551,4.5119825708061

4016854,5,B002ZCY8CW,"Jackie has so many dual roles in her life that she is forced into playing games at both ends.

* Married wife or single woman having sex with coworkers
* Mother of two daughters or single woman
* The best nurse in ER or a drug addict out of control

The second season is one where Jackie tries to get back into normal life after breaking up with her pharmacist boyfriend Eddie.  She is also in constant battles with Doctor Cooper whose ego is out of control.  Eddie finds out Jackie is married and connects to closely with her family and Jackie wonders what is up with his game plan...

This whole season is full of emotions as Jackie has so many double lives that she is having trouble surviving on a day to day basis.  She goes from being the best lifesaving nurse you could ever hope to have to faking medical records in order to get drugs for her habit.

This is one of the best TV series around and it is worth watching.  Edie Falco and the other costars in this series is just the best crew together on one show.  This show varies from a comedy in one episode to a drama that can bring tears to your eyes in the next.  Sadly though, Nurse Jackie is really a troubled woman who needs help but every day she digs a deeper hole to have to crawl out of.

I wish it were an hour show rather than a half hour. Just when the episode starts to pick up, it's over! The writers incorporate comedy and drama into the show to keep you interested. Some episodes are pretty slow, whereas others make you jump right into the next episode - just like any show, of course. I also watched OZ and this is a very different role for Edie Falco, compared to being a prison guard in OZ - but this is a great role for her...very entertaining overall!",1328054400,,608,4.205128205128205

I was quite reluctant to even consider another medical show (after all, what could compare to House?), but I kept hearing great things about Nurse Jackie, and kept seeing Edie Falco at the Emmys! I decided to try one disc from Season One, and was hooed from the get-go. The show is an entire set of real flesh and blood characters with much more humor than House (he frankly scares me at times), and  I really care about them much more than I anticipated. The supporting cast is an excellent group of contrasting real life kind of people who I have actually began to really care about, especially the young Nurse Zooey. We have begun watching each disc in it's entirety when it arrives and send it back the next morning. We enjoy watching entire seasons of a show at a few sittings. If you enjoy House, you will liely enjoy Nurse Jackie, but even if House is a bit off-putting for you, give this one a try...I thin you will enjoy it!",1313020800,2,1056,4.471502590673575

My one annoyance with the program is that the nurses never change out of their scrubs. They go home, play with their kids, go out to dinner, ect... in their work clothes. Being a nurse myself, it is disgusting. You go home, shower or at least change before you hug your kids.

She is constantly in back pain, due to lifting people off gurneys and onto beds. She has a friend who is a Pharmacist, who supplies her with powerful pain drugs, and every day at noon they have sex in the back of his office.  He loves her and he doesn't know she is married. The big Uh Oh comes when the husband comes to her work and asks for her and when he is asked who he is, he says, ""I am her husband"".  Because no one knows she is married.  Everyday she takes off her weeding ring before she goes into work.  I like the duality of this character. This is well written, and paced correctly.  The other characters in the show are great supporting actors and there is always something going on that blends into the action. I can't wait till season 3. This actress, Edie Falco, is perfect for the part. I can tell this subject matter has been well researched.  ;)

I know that this is a humourous way to look at a drug addicated nurse that's hiding her addiction to pain pills but it's also a very scary fact.

4016919,3,B002ZCY8CW,"A couple of the long reviews here are obviously from fans who like this show.  I feel there is too much over analyzing leading to poor conclusions. So I will hop on board and do the same thing in search of a better, more logical conclusion. From the perspective of a traditional male. I like the show but I do not love it. I watch it for the excellent acting and writing which I find rare, particularly in combination.  But I find parts of the show not plausible and frankly from the perspective of a liberal fantasy land.  For instance I do not buy into nor like the lead character.  While Falco is a great actor, she is also middle aged and average looking.  Both her husband and lover are far, far too attractive (in different ways)to be so head over heels for ""nurse jackie"".  They also have the hansome, rich heel of a doc in love with our hero.  Not plausible.  This is what happens when you take your mind off the acting and writing and decide to ""enlighten"" your audience rather than entertain.  It is the reason this is 3 stars and not 5.  It is true that in real life fairly attractive or even very average looking middle aged men, who are successful and charismatic could have two or more younger, beautiful women pinning away for them.  But middle aged women are almost never in this fantasy position.  This show makes it's mark off very gritty, realistic storylines in an emergency hospital setting with blood and death. I was hoping the beautiful husband who runs the bar and plays house husband would turn out to have a dark side, past, secret -
something to justify his attraction to (i say setteling for) Jackie.  The lover and the uptown doc? Nope, I don't buy their attraction to Jackie.  If this is simply the producers way of drawing an audience of middle aged liberal women then they are not really doing the show for the show or the art. If it is just to get the older gals to beleive they can have the ""hunks"" fighting over them....like the muscular wolf man and the sensitive vampire.......then this is not a cutting edge show, it is simply a bodice ripper.  The drug story line is very realistic.  Someone wanted to know why they did not explain the end of season one at the beginning of two.  Here is the answer.  She got away with it.  Why?  Because she can do the hardest to fill job in the country.  Womens liberation has led to smart young ladies dreaming of being doctors, not nurses.  4 year nurses? BSN's?  With the experience of Jackie.  The obvious leadership and team building qualities.  It would take more than eating a bunch of pills to put her out of work.  I buy that.  The real world is like that.  As far as the updown doc suddenly turning out to be the heel, you saw a different show than I did.  He was a good looking, rich, incompetent boob (no pun intended) from the beginning(probably also a symbol of us awful republicans).  He is a doc strictly because of his money.  The english doc who is a lesbian (don't give me bisexual, female bisexuals are lesbians with car trouble) is also the greatest doc who ever lived.  She has been saving the patients the boob was trying to kill since day one.  Conclusion - socialist english lisbian doc good.  Republican doc - Bad.  The tough boss lady does a great job of making it more than a Mr Grant to Mary Richards crusty but benign boss cliche'. Thor is cool.  The best actor among many may be the rookie nurse.  She is excellent and very believable.  So I will continue to watch this show for the great dialog and acting.  But there is far too much liberal ""enlightenment"" for us non blue koolaid drinkers.",1288051200,7,3598,4.418569254185693
4016920,1,B002ZCY8CW,What is going on with these horrific shows. They are all alike I swear. They have a character with at wicked biotchy attitude and no real story behind it. I have no idea where Showtime thinks they are getting premium shows. Maybe it was a premium channel at one point but lately it has just hit the rocks!,1286409600,2,305,4.275862068965517
