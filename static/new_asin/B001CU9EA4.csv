8289857,3,B001CU9EA4,"Not much is known about the Ancient Maya, so I always worry that any documentary on that group will just say the same stuff.  Luckily, I was wrong here.  The series about architecture, so that's the (informative) angle here.

One expert said the Maya knew about wheels, but culuturally like things that involved lots of human labor.  This work mention a golden mean device: it has nothing to do with mediocrity; it was more like pi, a 1 to 1.618 ratio.  The Maya had underground aqueducts; they compared to the Romans.

The CGI here is great; the reenactments are strong too.  They didn't translate that one  king's crypt like was done in ""Breaking the Maya Code.""  I would have liked that, but again the focus was engineering.  Astonomy is given a lot of emphasis here as well.  Not only where the sun and moon important to that culture, but the planet Venus was too.

I kinda wonder would this be a great doc to see alongside Gibson's ""Apocalypto.""",1324771200,2,950,4.589285714285714
