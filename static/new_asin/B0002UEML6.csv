8031996,3,B0002UEML6,"The editorial review for this movie is waaaay off.  Prince Kynd to marry Dorothy?  When does she reach the age of eighteen?  Snowball a human?  Uncle Henry not Dorothy's uncle and a jerk?  From the cover picture, it looks like an older black and white version.  From the editorial review, I would guess the screenwriter read all the Oz books years before and only vaguely remembered bits from the different books and winged it when he wrote the screenplay.  It might be fun to own.  I am tempted.  Two and a half stars for uniqueness.",1343347200,,534,4.536842105263158
