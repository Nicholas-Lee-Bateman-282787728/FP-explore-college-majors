7856348,3,6303948944,"This is not a bad movie, but is far from a good one. It is about a young doctor being summoned to a cult property to help an ex-girlfriend. The movie moves slowly, the acting is not too bad, but the script is totally uninspired. The mostly young cast is attractive and unknown. There is incidental female nudity. There is not much real violence until, what, the last 10-15 minutes. No blood gore fest, at all. Nothing satanic. One gets the feel of a regionally made (1994) movie (Gulf coast/ Texas?) with unknowns, to deliver a message. The message is ""cults are bad, --bad"". The movie ends in a somewhat pat paroxism of violence, where all the bad people get it, the property erupts in a massive cleansing fire, --and the heroic couple walk off to a job ""at a small hospital in Oregon"". Oh, and the male hero is probably the most miscast role of a doctor that I have seen in a film. He would be perfect in roles as a quarterback or any character hanging around a western corral, or doing anything with horses. But it is not for lack of effort on his part. Actually, this movie is oddly very attractive to women. Maybe it is the moody music, and the abundance of strong female roles, working on their agendas, or the sensitive, handsome male lead. Men may be bored to death, or disappointed in a lack of hard action throughout.
This movie is hard to find, available on vhs, but not dvd. The vhs cover is pretty cool.",1381795200,,1416,4.387832699619772
