6486496,5,B00LH5IT3C,Great movie for the family!  Very timely for what kids are dealing with these days.  Awesome to see a movie addressing real topics in an entertaining way.,1415145600,11,154,4.666666666666667
6486497,5,B00LH5IT3C,It's an entertaining movie with a powerful message. All parents of teens need to see this. It made our whole family both laugh and cry on several occasions. I would totally watch this again!!!,1414972800,13,192,4.676470588235294
6486498,5,B00LH5IT3C,"As the Mother of 7 Children..  5 of which are  teens and ""tweens""  I can recommend this as a Family MUST SEE.  It takes on a topic that is so timely in the social media culture of today and is still appropriate for all ages.  Every high school student should see this movie, and consider the consequences of what they choose to do and say in the ""cyber-world"".  I love this movie and the impact it has had on my family.  Definitely a new family favorite. See this movie and prepare to be entertained and uplifted.",1414972800,14,513,4.28125
6486499,5,B00LH5IT3C,"I watched this movie with my teenage kids.  They were glued to the screen the entire time, waiting to find out what happens next.  One of the best parts about watching this movie with my family was the positive message it carries.  It is pretty rare nowadays that you can sit down and watch a movie appropriate for the whole family that keeps their attention the entire time, and that not only entertains but also inspires.  This movie does both.

6486500,5,B00LH5IT3C,"A perfect example of what Hollywood ought to be - yes, entertaining, but also encouraging and uplifting to our nation's young people.  This is a film that is suitable for the entire family.  We need more movies like this!",1414540800,9,221,4.641025641025641
6486501,5,B00LH5IT3C,"This movie should be seen by all teenagers.  If you have ever been accused of something you did not do this movie  will touch you and bring back memories.  As a adult I was accused of something I did not do and was called horrible names because a couple of people had to have a reason for their lives falling apart so I became their escape goat.  I stayed and tried to forgive them and I was able to achieve my goal.  However, 30 years later I'm still their escape goat.  My life goes on and my heart is pure.  I just hope they never do again to someone what they did to me. A good life lesson.  Sometimes no matter how innocent you are someone will ruin your name just to make themselves avoid seeing themselves for who they truly are.",1518220800,,736,4.133802816901408
6486502,5,B00LH5IT3C,"This was an incredibly well-acted and well-directed movie about high school and bullying.  Danielle Chuchran was phenomenal as she portrayed the bullied teenager. It is horrific what some students will do when they are jealous, insecure, immature and cruel just to get attention and to make themselves feel better by someone else's suffering. They need to be accountable for their actions. So many bullied students commit suicide and many times nothing happens to the perpetrators. They need to ask themselves what kind of souls they have. What makes people so cruel and sadistic.  I highly recommend this movie as the message is extremely important.",1518134400,2,650,5.240384615384615
6486503,5,B00LH5IT3C,"A+ Two thumbs up. I really like Natasha Henstridge (Species,Ghosts Of Mars), she is really cute, she had the greatest role. Great performance. Haven't seen Jamie Kennedy (Scream) for a long time but it's good to see him again. It just shows you how terrible bullies can get away with anything. But it's a great story and great acting. I love this movie.",1516579200,,353,4.619047619047619

6486507,4,B00LH5IT3C,"I find this haunting and scary knowing to is possible in today's society. It shows just how farmsome people have to go to,protect themselves despite being innocent and how quickly things can get out of hand.

6486508,5,B00LH5IT3C,"So while I try to write product reviews as often as I can (they're a huge selling point for online items!), I've never written a movie or tv show review. Why start now, you ask? WELL. There I was, minding my own business after a loooong day... I had just gotten home from my workout classes and sat on my couch for the first time in what felt like forever. And then it hit me. The little voice in my head said, ""let's not do anything else tonight that requires any energy whatsoever. Let's find a LifeTimey movie to watch and focus on someone else's problems/drama."" Sounds great! So I sat and I searched, and I searched and I sat (I am QUITE the indecisive person, even when looking for a sub-par movie to watch). When I read the description for Nowhere Safe, I was pretty ""meh"" about it. Didn't sound super interesting, but not terrible. The reviews were fairly high, which pretty much drew me to press ""Watch Now."" And here I am. I watched, and I was satisfied. The Amazon move summary/description and the movie title itself DO NOT do this movie justice in acting as a representation for what you will watch. I found the cast (for the most part) surprisingly well-acted, the plot fairly interesting, and the execution of the premise successful overall. There's humor, some romance, a bit of drama, and I actually felt something for a few of the characters. So if this review does what other reviews do for me, I hope you choose this movie on a night you just want to get lost in your blankets and veg out. There are better movies in the world, for sure, but this one's pretty good for what it is (a non-LifeTime LifeTimey movie).",1513814400,2,1632,4.443333333333333
6486509,5,B00LH5IT3C,I feel every teen and even adults being bullied or is the bully should see this movie! Some of these awful events even happen in the workplace. I know first hand.

6486514,5,B00LH5IT3C,"Here I am once again, peeps!! As always, here are my methods of rating: 1. Adult Movies, Family Movies, and Child Movies. 2. Five stars means good and safe and a one star means the movie will clog your moral compass or ruin the trust in your marriage or children. I studied Criminal Psychology at Liberty University; I have a method. I do not rate by how I feel, feelings are shallow and not a way to live at all. Feelings merely tell you there is a flaw (for example - pain is a feeling. Feelings are necessary, but I'd rather have the answer, than you explaining your feelings in this context. No doctor is here, leave the feeling descriptions at home with your dogs, cats, and doctors); the flaw could be in you. Stop living by feelings, speed runners. Chemicals are infused with substances, natural ingredients in your life are not lab/culture infused.

Anywho: This movie gets a 5-Star Family Rating! Woohoo! Not many of these juggernauts around, which tells you how many good people this country has, because that is a reflection. What are your negative comments????? Let's go, let's do this. What negative thing do you have to say to a movie that actually can teach a child and teenager to not be sprinkled cupcake? This movie, in the beginning demonstrated how boys like a challenge (a woman with morals is a real fight to get); not talking down to him, but calling out his immaturity that runs rampant in a co-ed environment, is attractive. That is what I want my future children to know. WE ALL like people who stand up (hence the American freedom I helped give you), or we are jealous of the other person, because our courage stops at Call of Duty, which is why we let our children play zombie video games and watch vampire movies - we have not the audacity to rear them healthy, for the betterment of our society. Watch this movie with your children and grow up. You are raising the next soldiers, congressmen, fathers, and mothers. Do not regret being a feather that was too weak to be rooted very strong in something that has value and life in it. Be blessed. Blessings do not come by magic, they come by fruit in your life and times of testing. Peace be with you. J.J. Lyon - I have short-story eBooks and Print copies.",1498262400,2,2234,4.502463054187192
6486515,5,B00LH5IT3C,This was a well-written and well-acted movie that dealt with an all-too-common topic. This is definitely a must-see for any child who has had to endure bullying tactics of their peers. It is an inspiring story of strength and resilience.,1491004800,,237,4.95
6486516,5,B00LH5IT3C,Loved this movie! Great movie with great lessons. A little cheesy at times but I liked it haha. Sends out a wonderful message. I'd recommend watching.,1489104000,,150,4.8076923076923075

6486522,5,B00LH5IT3C,"A little uneven & Jaime Kennedy babbled on incessantly. But the message about bullying in school rings true. The reverse online bully tactics resonates. I don't think it exaggerated what happens when jealous, mean spirited teens target one student to punish & make her life a living hell. Both psychically & mentally. Danielle Chuchran played tortured girl Ashley very realistically. In real life people have committed suicide over this horrific type of experience.",1485820800,,465,5.383561643835616
6486523,5,B00LH5IT3C,"I give it 5 stars because cyber billing and stolen identities on the Internet happen in reality. The law and us do little about the issues, the ones that suffer just run away, so the movie gives us an option to dealing with the issue. Instead of running, we should stay strong and face our wrong doing or defend ourselves no matter who is against you.",1485820800,,351,4.333333333333333

6486529,5,B00LH5IT3C,"To much of this has been going on for years and years and this movie is very much like some of what is happening in our schools. Bullying is not prejudice at any age or any school.  All it takes is that 1 person to start it and then it becomes many. Children need to be taught right when starting school cause it happens in kindergarten and all the way up. I know cause I lived it every year of my life. It could be for you food and your money your parents give you for lunch or you're threatened to bring money so a girl can eat or cause you came from another town or jealousy and I can keep going cause this all happened to me. This movie is great but it only touches 1 subject on bullying. I don't understand why kids do this and why they need to hurt. We need to get rid of this altogether so no child fears school cause it's their future that's at risk and believe me it can ruin your child's life. Kids commit suicide over this and it changes them for the bad. It starts at home and kindergarten, 1st grade , 2nd grade 3rd grade and on there are bullies and they're bad. I'll never forget what happened but I hope I can come to understand it through others stories like this 1. I'm 45 years old and I still live with that pain. If you don't want your child to live a lifetime of pain then start teaching them young. It's all races, rich, poor and so much more. Every child needs to learn. There's always the bully and the victim, if it happens to your child which side will he or she be on?? Stop bullying now. It's very real. God bless you all. Thank you Cheri Jordan.",1484352000,2,1575,4.048076923076923

The ending is powerful and offers hope for all those who go through such false accusations or misunderstandings. The film is well acted, features a solid story, and will reel you in.

There is a powerful statement on the effects of bullying on victim and family with this movie. The movie, inspired by true events tells the story of two teen girls, who victimize their target by pretending to be her. Using her name and online ID, they use social media to write awful and cruel comments about people in their town. The girls reputation is destroyed. She and her mother are forced to leave the town and start a new life in a new place.

The actors do a great job depicting their roles in this movie. Jamie Kennedy also plays a great role as a history teacher. The actors are natural and make this movie relatable to teens.

When i was growing up the kid whom was getting the brunt end was labeled the problem not who started the problem. Seems to be a very good incite to this movie to me.
Like what im saying or not, this is how i see it.  Been on the end in a matter of speaking, the end i was on wasn't a fun one either.
This is a good movie to see, and it does show some good lessons.  The way media has made things become, isn't right by far. It's fueled by instigators, and show offs. Media in the way it was created wasn't meant on computer to be this way. It only became this way due to those people whom seem to want attention one way or another.",1468627200,,885,3.830601092896175

It didn't touch on the bullying that was done to her at her prior school but went into the fact that her & her mother had to uproot from their home for safety reasons and move to a  new small town and high school where the girl would be unknown. She had hardly any problems there other than getting used to a brand new high school which is never easy.  She fit in well as she was cute and had a nice personality.

6486666,5,B00LH5IT3C,"This film provoked such a visceral response in me because it was my life in junior high and high school many years ago.  'Mean girls' with personality disorders.  The trouble with today's teens is that social media is a hot bed for cyber-bullying and clicks on YouTube keep 'the pot stirred'.  Unlike the movie, where the former 'bad' guy turns from his wayward ways and stays nice, I didn't have a happy ending.  No one in my story heard the truth.  I think the overall message of this film is a positive one and one that everyone should see.  This film and others like it should be shown at school assemblies.  Kids actually commit suicide because the negative pressure of bullying can be overwhelming and intense for a developing brain.  Back when I was bullied no one knew how to handle it so they blamed the victim for being the problem (I mean, what is wrong with you that you have no friends?).  The relationship between mother and daughter (and/or parents) should not be underscored.  A loving, supportive home is where confidence and self-esteem grows.  Integrity and character start with good parenting.  If a child is being bullied at school and his/her parents are uninvolved at home, that child is at risk for significant physical, psychological, and social problems into adulthood.  Parents, watch this film with your child. Please.",1468108800,3,1346,4.82532751091703

6486707,5,B00LH5IT3C,"Awesome movie! There are many people today that were victimized when younger and had to live through it. I hope they gone on to have a better life and the villain has not won. Very timely movie for today with all the bullying going on. Great acting and great story showing how some are so pathetic in their own life that they have to knock someone down to make themselves feel better. I like the ending where the 2 original girls were confronted by their next target. The story's victim stood up for herself and was no longer a victim, but a heroine.",1466380800,6,550,4.349514563106796

Bullying is real and it needs to stop and needs to be taken care of the FIRST time!  Schools CAN do something about, they just need to be creative.  A must see by all teens, even 5th graders.",1519344000,,369,3.88
