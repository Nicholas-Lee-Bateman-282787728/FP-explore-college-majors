  Stangers... I was trying to get my seventh-grade history class to understand how the Indians must have felt when they first encountered the Spanish explorers.
""How would you feel,"" I asked, ""if someone showed up on your doorstep who
looked very different, spoke a strange language and wore unusual clothes?
Wouldn't you be a bit scared?""

""Nah,"" one boy answered, ""I'd just figure it was my sister's date.""",1328400000,,496,4.67816091954023
7987201,4,B00008VFCB,"Go go gadget resolution!  After spending dozens of episodes embroiled in a seemingly endless game of cat and also cat, Inspector Gadget's deadly rivalry with the sinister Dr. Claw comes to its logical and thrilling conclusion.  The case begins with a mystery worthy of the great Inspector as a new hero emerges on the scene.  The first act wrings out a great deal of pathos as Inspecter Gadget realizes that, like all technology, he is on the cusp of becoming obsolete.  This is not only true to the character and story arcs, but also provides a rather meta commentary on the state of the series as a hole.  The writers themselves knew that their own great adventure was coming to an end, and one gets the feeling that they shared Gadget's despair at his own obsolescence.

However, the great detective does not get to contemplate his navel for long, as it soon becomes apparent that this upstart hero is not all that he seems.  Worse, a string a grisly murders bring Gadget to a horrible realization: the day he hoped would never come has arisen as Dr. Claw begins to put his endgame into action.  Bodies pile up and blood flows freely as the Inspector Gadget is dragged into an increasingly complicated chain of mysteries that ultimately lead him into the lair of Dr. Claw himself.

There are so many scenes that raise this story to the level of high art, on par with Citizen Kane or such animated classics as Snow White and Cars 2, yet to describe them to you would spoil your pleasure of viewing it for the first time.  Let me instead say that the story is just as brooding, psychological, and grim as one would expect from this series.  This is the story that the writers have been building up to from the very first episode, with all the gruesome dismemberments and fifteen minute long gang rapes one would expect.  It isn't all shock and horror, of course (though yes, there is plenty of that), as, in true Inspector Gadget fashion, the story weaves these titillating if terrifying elements into a compelling and thoughtful tale.  You will not help shedding tears at Penny and Brain's glorious final stand against a legion of the M.A.D. henchmen, and the final fight between Gadget and Dr. Claw is a tense, frenetic, and action packed climax rendered in the most breath-takingly expressive animation ever wrung from human hands - in fact, it is so wondrous in its detail that I almost wonder if it had been drawn by the gods themselves.

This is it, my friends.  This is the Inspector Gadget story to end all Inspector Gadget stories, and the absolute apex of animation and, indeed, film itself as an art form.  I have gazed upon perfection, and it is Inspector Gadget's Last Case.",1317859200,5,2688,4.627368421052632
7987202,5,B00008VFCB,I ordered this video for my 9 year old son for Christmas. Although Inspector Gadget is a cartoon from a previous generation its good clean humor transcends to amuse children still today.,1231200000,,186,4.84375
7987203,2,B00008VFCB,"Inspector Gadget's Last Case - Claw's Revenge is almost as bad as the both of the live action Gadget movie. Instead of an anti-gadget as in the first movie, you have a so-called crimefighter who tries his best to best Gadget at his crimefighting

A few things make this Gadget incomplete. As much as I love Maurice LaMarche (from Pinky & The Brian) trying to step into Don Adams's Gadget shoes..,THERE is NO ONE else that can do Gadget like Adams! The script seems disjointed and disappointing. And Penny is giving too little to do in this movie to save it all !

So don't get this and get the Original Gadget TV stuff with Adams

7987204,2,B00008VFCB,"I got this DVD well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday. I don't know why it took me so long as I do like the Inspector Gadget show and even the new Gadget and the Gadgetinis. While it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie, there are some old things missing that bog this Gadget right down the toilet.

First of all the classic Inspector Gadget theme song and music is completely absent. The composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it's still just no good enough. The Gadget-mobile is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. Plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool. Penny no longer has her computer book and she and Brain hardly make an appearance at all.

The plot is non-existent. There's something about a transformation formula and Doctor Claw using for some never revealed evil but that's all I got. What the deal was with the short/giant Italian guy I will never know. It had nothing to do with anything.

And if the title is anything to go by, his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever. And he stays on the force so why it's called 'last case' is a mystery also.

I wasn't impressed at all. This is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on DVD, but don't let that prompt you into buying whatever Inspector Gadget DVDs you can. I sold this mere seconds after finally watching it. No kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it.",1128643200,6,1544,4.29553264604811
7987205,1,B00008VFCB,"Inspector Gadget was probably my all-time favorite 80's cartoon.  I enjoyed both the first and second seasons of the series as well as 1992's Christmas special ""Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas"".  Some Gadget fans are quick to criticize the second season (1985) of the show, but they need to compare it to DiC's 2002 release of ""Inspector Gadget's Last Case: Claw's Revenge"" for then, they will find the second season to be absolute gold.

Being a Gadget fan, I couldn't resist the opportunity to see the animated Inspector Gadget in something that wasn't Gadget Boy-related.  I purchased the film, and I swore to myself that I'd be objective; I knew that sometimes artistic liberties would be taken from the original series.  I was not even prepared for what I was about to watch.

There was barely a shred of the original show still intact.

Here is a short list of just some of the cons for this movie:

*The humor is non-existant from the original series.

*Penny and Brain (originally having a nearly equal part in the series as Gadget) are missing from the action for fifteen to twenty minute intervals.

*The original music by Saban & Levy is not there, and the score that exists is subpar.  (Understood that Saban has his own production company now, but at least ""Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas"" had good music, even without Saban.)

*Don't expect to see any of Gadget's gadgets which made the show so endearing, such as gadget-copter, gadget-brella, gadget-mallot,gadget-coat (which actually was used but it was not even called the same thing), as well as his standard other hat and hand gadgets.  In this movie, his gadget legs were telescopic instead of springs. That kind of stuff annoys true fans of the show, and simply aren't necessary to change.

*The gadgetmobile from the original series is now a fast-talking, supposedly ""hip"" convertible.  All the fans from the original series enjoyed the gadgetmobile transforming into the gadget van and vice versa.

*Chief Quimby is now very short-tempered and even mean to Gadget.  He was always grumpy in the original series, but this pushes the situation a bit much.

*Penny no longer has a computer book.

Are there any positives to this movie? Ok, here goes...

*Maurice LaMarche does a good job of taking over for the great Don Adams as Inspector Gadget.

*In one scene, Chief Quimby alludes to an actual villain from the cartoon series: the Great Wambini (classic ""Gadget"" villain from the second season, voiced by Louis Nye).

Looking for more redeeming factors for this movie?  Well, you're out of luck.  Life is about making choices and living by those choices.  Most situations in life have a purpose even if it is to teach a lesson.  The lesson learned here: keep to the original formula!  ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it.""  True Gadget fans should steer clear from this movie; you will surely be disappointed.

Hopefully, DiC will continue to release more of the original series on DVD.  So far, Volume 1 of ""The Gadget Files"" has been released as well as ""Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas"".  As a true Gadget fan, lover of 80's animation and many of DiC's programs, I urge you the viewer to purchase these two DVD's which are excellent and sure to bring back good memories.",1106611200,14,3247,4.838475499092559
