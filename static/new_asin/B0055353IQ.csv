My first impressions of this programme were that it was another Aussie programme that needs those underlying soapstyle storylines to keep the series flowing. However after a couple of episodes, I was very impressed with the many and varied locations used around Sydney in the series.
Rescue Special Ops ran on the Nine Network in Australia for three series with a total of 48 episodes. The first series of 13 episodes had a series average of just over a million viewers. Filled with regular cast and recurring cast members who have usually had some sort of role in Home and Away, the series also features one of Australia's most popular actors from the 80s, Peter Phelps, who rose to fame in the nightly serial Sons and Daughters. Gary Sweet (Police Rescue) also appears as the father of two of the guys employed as part of the rescue team.
Maybe some of the characters get far too involved with the people they are rescuing. But having it happen fairly frequently brings me to the conclusion that these characters are not true to life as they probably wouldn't be employed in such a role if they cannot avoid a personal entanglement with their rescue victims.
All in all I'll give this 5 stars as each story is genuinely different, the locastions are fantastic, there's a good range of guest stars - Damian Walshe-Howling (Blue Heelers) plays his role particularly well. I've yet to see the second and third series, but am slightly annoyed that there won't be any further series made.
Enjoy.",1332892800,2,1632,4.75
