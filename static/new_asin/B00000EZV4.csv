1200652,5,B00000EZV4,"I knew very little about the Korean conflict (as well as most of my generation, I'm sure) and this documentary gave me a very comprehensive look into it.",1355788800,2,153,4.5
1200653,5,B00000EZV4,"Many historical war documentaries are just old newsreels, and not much more.  This documentary not only shows footage I've not seen before, but it also has individuals (vets) that were there give personal commentary, which enhances the the program.  It is carefully put together to give the entire story of how the Koren War started to the truce that finally came of if.  Loaded with facts, this is an important documentary to add to any individual that loves history.",1333152000,20,468,4.89873417721519
1200654,4,B00000EZV4,"This was a savage war and few really good docos have appeared on it. This was first released on DVD and I assumed the Blu-ray would just be a technical upgrade. Not a bit of it, it has been substantially re-done with maps and much additional information. This must now be the best available doco on this war and I enjoyed it very much. The sound and picture are excellent considering the age of the material.",1329782400,34,408,4.381578947368421
1200655,5,B00000EZV4,bought as a gift.  they say its the best dvd on korea they have ever seen. i would buy it again.,1328659200,13,96,3.5714285714285716
1200656,1,B00000EZV4,"A bad documentary, no logic, no deep insights, just a surface look on this dramatic history.....",1014163200,6,96,5.0625
7906425,2,B00000EZV4,I was looking for an objective history of the Korean War.  This was anything but.  It was all fluff to convince the people back home that everything was fine.  I couldn't get rid of it soon enough.  It was not objective and not realistic at all.,1520985600,,245,4.260869565217392
7906426,4,B00000EZV4,A very well done video of this long forgotten war,1478908800,,49,4.0
7906427,3,B00000EZV4,The main issue I have with this is the volume it was recorded at.  I had to turn the TV  way up to even get it to an acceptable level and when I went back to normal TV I forgot and about blew the speakers on the TV o. O,1463270400,,219,3.36
7906428,4,B00000EZV4,"Acting is good, with lots of war torn backgrounds. No doubt when one sees this kind of war movie, it is hardly expected such significant backdrop. So, they put in a lot of works to make this a great war movie. In between, there were lots of past moments and conversations. One has to pay great attention to it since the language in Korean. But it is worth it for the price.",1448064000,2,373,4.194444444444445
7906429,5,B00000EZV4,Very informative,1437955200,,16,7.5
7906430,5,B00000EZV4,Very satisfied.,1407456000,,15,7.0
7906431,3,B00000EZV4,"Very old documentary converted to DVD. It is in 4:3 ratio, which is to be expected of old footage. The interviews with the Vets is quite interesting and informative. The knowledge gleaned from these folks and the stock footage, is well worth the cost of the video of this forgotten conflict. The veterans explain exactly how the firing commenced to begin the conflict and detail many engagements in the fight.",1407196800,4,409,4.857142857142857
7906432,5,B00000EZV4,"More should watch movies like this, the forgotten war!",1405296000,,54,5.111111111111111
7906433,5,B00000EZV4,nice item,1387065600,,9,4.0
7906434,4,B00000EZV4,"Content is good, though could use more combat footage.  A lot of personal interviews, coupled with black-white footage. Really no need for Blu-Ray since this is a documentary and the footage are quite old.",1358985600,,205,5.029411764705882
