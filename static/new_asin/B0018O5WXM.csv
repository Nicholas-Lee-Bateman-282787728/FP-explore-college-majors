8270295,5,B0018O5WXM,"Excellent tutorial.  I've been playing badly for 40 years, and most of these Hal Leonard ""play along"" DVDs are excellent.  Lesson before each song, multiple views of the song being played; the fretting hand closeup with tab at the bottom of the screen is my favorite.  The Hal Leonard DVDs with tab (not all have it!) are great learning resources, highly recommended.",1433635200,4,367,4.887096774193548
