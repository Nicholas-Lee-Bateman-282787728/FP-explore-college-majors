4849415,5,B005NQ5LN2,"This certainly was not an extremely popular series when it came out. However it was really good. What you are actually getting is two seasons of 13 episodes. The first season was good. The second season was much better.

The initial set-up of Tsutomu and Birdy sharing a body is frankly a bit strange, but once you get past that you have a really excellent series that you will not be disappointed with.",1333584000,17,403,4.52054794520548

4849418,5,B005NQ5LN2,"The plot may sound like a joke, but it weaves together so well. I found myself watching a entire season in one sitting twice!  It sneaks up on you in that way, with the characters growing on you with every episode. I just wish there was more of the series. The only suggestion I have is Blu-ray pretty please.",1328918400,10,309,4.237288135593221
4849419,5,B005NQ5LN2,"This is a series is a cross between Cowboy Bebop, Tenchi, and Bleach.  A wonderful blended story that has appeal in many genres.  The only drawback is that when you watch the last episode, you leave wanting so much more.  It is refreshing to see such good writing in an anime.  I highly recommend this series.  It is a great romp!",1327881600,2,330,4.344262295081967

4849425,5,B005NQ5LN2,"Got the right one this time,  last time I tried to get the first half and ended up with a dbz disk lol.  Anyway its is a good action series.  The series covers about two arc haven't read the source material because it was never licenses here, but I had the opportunity to watch the original  OVA.  Here the story is much more developed, but lighter in tone, only thing in common is that they both have the same premise.  it is worth a look, if you like action.",1473811200,,460,4.112359550561798

4849438,4,B005NQ5LN2,"Good, entertaining story. Nice twists. There was some totally unexpected, over-the-top, and too graphic gore. The ending sucked though, as it seemed that maybe like some US TV, they have had their show cancelled and so they did a quick and not-to-clean story wrap-up. Maybe it's just me. This could have been excellent.",1438905600,,319,5.037735849056604
4849439,3,B005NQ5LN2,Not like the original Birdy,1437177600,,27,4.6
4849440,4,B005NQ5LN2,"Let me begin by saying I have some complaints about this anime:

1) My biggest complaint is that there are stories that should be here that are not.  You're waiting all series for certain things to come to a head and be resolved, and they just never deal with it.

2) A number of poorly directed scenes, some of which weaken big moments.  Example: someone is trapped in a corridor with gunmen in front and behind trying to kill them.  Birdy jumps in front of the bullets from the front gunmen and dispatches them, while the gunmen in back just watch.

3) Not the tightest plot overall.

4) The final episode is complete filler and makes no sense.  (I think it was done after the series and is intended to go between seasons one and two.)

5) The inclusion of the lecherous-high-school-boy slapstick from Tsutomu's friends.  Really guys, this is so old, the last time I laughed at it I fell of my pet dinosaur.

It is a testament to strengths of this show that I nevertheless found myself burning my way through this series.  The characters are likable and you feel for them.  The action is exciting, and the show is visually attractive and fun despite the paste colors and not-too-scary monster designs that suggest that the show is intended for a younger audience.  Many episodes have real emotional gravitas.

As for the stories they don't tell, you can get some satisfaction by reading the manga (the rewrite that began in 2003 which appears to be the basis for this video, not the original).  As of this writing, English versions are not available commercially, but fan translations are up on mangafox.me.  It won't come up on the PC web page.  Scroll to the bottom, select the ""Mobile Version"" of the site, and then search for the title.",1436918400,,1742,4.60064935064935
4849441,5,B005NQ5LN2,"This show was a pleasant surprise.  I wasn't expecting too much given the silly name of Birdy, the goofy drawing of her on the pre-SAVE release and the cliched description of the show on the back of the box (""Birdy's got the moves to stop them dead in their tracks"").  Instead the show turned out to be very good and it dispensed with a lot of the usual anime cliches.  A teenage boy and girl actually go on a date and kiss without the boy developing a nosebleed, going into convulsions, or anything silly like that.  Teenage boy shares body with adult woman and there are no voyeuristic scenes, crude remarks, or really anything inappropriate.

Characters, their back stories, and their motivations are well developed and believable.  The plots and subplots of the two seasons are slowly unveiled and although you can see some revelations coming, others are surprises.  I really enjoyed this series and wish there were more like it.",1431302400,,933,4.75776397515528

4849449,5,B005NQ5LN2,"I'm not huge into anime, usually because, in my opinion, most of the stuff out today just sucks.  This one was different.  I can tell the animator(s) and line artist(s) are really talented, and that quality of work never started to slouch throughout the two part series.  What I mean by that is, for example, if you compare the quality of work in the very first Pokemon anime season to say... IDK... when that May chick became a main character, the quality had plummeted by then.  If I can tell that the people in charge of the anime didn't care or were rushed to push it out, it puts me off and keeps me away.  I also hate anime that is 90% ""fan service,"" of which, Decode is not--yes it has scantily clad women and children, which is naturally attractive (as in, we were born to be attracted to completely unclothed, fit humans, usually of the opposite gender (and near our age, to clarify)) and appealing to look at; however, it's not the main reason I kept watching until the end.  Other traits of the show that I liked:

1) SPAAAAAACCCCEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
2) Other intelligent beings (aliens of all kinds, but usually relative enough to be understood)
3) Sci-Fi technology
4) Interesting designs and ideas
5) Love and romance stuff smartly paced throughout, as well as the young crush scenarios that get me all giddy inside (like, ""ooooooOOOOOooooo!"" you know? xD)
6) Action and high speed stuff smartly paced throughout
7) A little bit of investigation
8) HUMOR!
9) Time travel and complexities in the story littered throughout because of it
10) INTRIGUING CHARACTERS, not just boobs, upskirts, and ""kawaii"" s***
11) Questions, questions, questions! that are generally answered (although, since there has been no part 3 sadly, there are still many questions attached to their end of series ""To be continued..."")
12) The conscience and its many mysteries
13) The daily concerns of a high school male and those of a bad ass universe police woman
14) Terrorism and what is ""right""
15) Dealing with loss and with guilt...
16) What is truth?
17) The fantastic opening and exiting songs, especially the second part's opening--I originally saw this series a few years ago, and when I reheard the second opening just the other day when rewatching the series, I got those nostalgia goosebumps and teared up a bit (I'm emotional like that when it comes to really deep stuff and powerful music)

Things I didn't like?  When I look back and try to decide if there was anything I didn't enjoy consuming, I can't think of anything.  Obviously, this series just clicked with me, but even when I try to think outside the box and critique it... it just has so much good going for it, I can't think of anything I would change; it's like a masterpiece in my eyes.  Of course, you could redo all of the art and try to perfect it or get it as close to movie quality as possible, but when I praise the quality of work, I mean it.  Sometimes the English voiceovers got cringe worthy (and, I'm really reaching here), but after a few episodes I just stopped being bothered by it, probably because it became part of those character's personalities, and it was consistent.

I really have no idea why this series went so unnoticed... and that bums me out, because after all of this passed time, I'm not sure they're going to revisit it and start up a part 3.  It was THAT good, so good that I crave MOAR!  Here's to hoping if they do decide to reboot it, those in charge aren't just hungry for cash, and hopefully they commission the original artists.

BUY IT!",1418688000,6,3548,4.634768740031898

Its about an alien who comes to earth as a peace officer with amazing powers and befriends an earthling who watches her back while she does her job.  When she is not doing her job she works as an entertainer to gain some side change and some intelligence.  I'm not going to say anymore so that I don't give too much away, but if you like this kind of anime buy it, sit back, and enjoy it.",1410566400,2,560,4.0636363636363635

The story has a way of going in unexpected directions, so that it is really impossible for the viewer to know how things are going to turn out.

4849498,5,B005NQ5LN2,"In an age where everything seems to be going all CG, it's refreshing to see a few studios still doing more traditional animation in an excellent fashion.

The series is super condensed if you've read the manga, with lots of changes to the plot, but the essentials of the manga still come through.  Romance, war, heartbreak, friendship, tragedy, and more.  It's rare that a television cartoon can have you empathizing for the characters as people, but Birdy, Tsutomu and his friends, and others really come out as believable individuals.  I'm really disappointed that they didn't produce the 3rd season (characters are hinted at or seen irregularly who are big people in the manga), but it still was good enough I had to have a copy.

DVD transition, given that this was an HD broadcast in Japan, was done well without unnecessary smoothing or distortion, and our Sony BR player produces a near perfect HD output from these discs.  I would have picked this up on Bluray, but it was only produced that way in region 2 with only the original Japanese audio.  I can handle watching a Japanese broadcast, but my children also loved Birdy the Mighty and it is simpler to sacrifice definition to get the English audio, plus Luci Christian and the other crew produced a very good dubbing.

Very worth it!",1361491200,3,1296,4.754464285714286
4849499,4,B005NQ5LN2,"Where, oh where, should I start with this review? It's been so long since I've been driven so emotionally and personally driven by an Anime such as this...However, I find that I am now forced once again to pick up the pen and write a review for this awesome product that is Birdy the Mighty. (Oh yeah by the way, I should say this right off the bat-This show is quite superb overall. You should literally order it, like, right now. Then go ahead and read this review to get all excited about how awesome it is.) That's right, this product is, I believe, quite awesome and definitely worthy of a purchase. Anyways, I suppose I should start off how I always do- with my normal speech about why it is important to buy and support the anime you love in this turbulent economic times. (I'll keep this short and sweet.) For those that think they already know this information, I'm going to throw a curve ball at you...

Before I actually go any further; it's important to understand how I'm actually going about writing this review and how it's structured. I'm doing this because I believe if I don't you, the reader, will likely be quite lost and perhaps lose some of the critical ideas and messages I wish to share with you. (Which would be a shame because I'm going to be trying quite hard to share some of these amazing ideas and experiences I received from this show to you without spoiling anything.) I'm going to give it to you straight up, though. This, ""review"" is less of a review and more of a personal commentary about this product is so good and what I loved so much about it. I will be going over specifically what makes it such a memorable entry compared to other shows, and how it fits into what I'm looking for in an anime in general.  Right now, though, you are likely thinking the inevitable follow-up question to this paragraph, ""What the heck does that other sentence regarding personal commentaries mean?"" Well, let me quickly explain right now...

First off in this, ""personal commentary,"" there is admittedly some bias. I don't look at this product objectively in this review. (Because no matter what I actually think of it, ""review"" is still what it's labeled regardless.) Some (*Cough*Many*Cough) readers may perceive this as a bad thing. However it's important to realize and understand that I went into this show with absolutely no bias against or towards it whatsoever. (Just like how many of you readers are right now.) Looking back on it, my expectations regarding this show where pretty close to zero. In fact it may be safe to say that my expectations for this show may have been negative simply because I had just gotten through an intense marathon of Cowboy Bebop. (For those unaware, Cowboy Bebop is my absolute favorite show of all time. Period) Least to say... I was pumped. I was on the prowl looking for something to sate the burning desire I had to fill the void caused by finishing such a great show. But this begs the question: How, then, was I lead to Birdy the Mighty- A show that's seems to be flying very much under the radar? A show that hand't sold well at all in Japan... A show that is three years old and made during a very low point in Anime/Manga society... A show that, quite bluntly, has perhaps the dumbest and most irrelevant name I have ever seen put on a show of this caliber. I mean, common, this name looks like something that would be put on a bumper sticker. (Seriously.)

Regardless of the name, having seen the show though I can tell you with absolute certainty that this name couldn't be a worse representation of what this show actually is. (Thank goodness) The only thing relevant about the name of the show is that it states the name of the primary protagonist, Birdy. ""The Mighty,"" from what I can recall, isn't even stated once in the show. Regardless, this then leads me the second major difference. (Which should also be quite obvious by now...) Unlike a typical review, I don't review this from a third person perspective. I want to talk to you as if I where sitting in front of you. Because of this, my review won't actually be divided up into ""sections"" as it where. Rather, my review will basically be my line of thinking, having seen this show, translated into words which you can read at your leisure. Rather then breaking this review into sections, it will be one big block looking which will explain what I look for in Anime overall, and how this show delivers.

Starting from the top, I suppose I should come out and say that this show is GOOD overall. ('Meh' first season and fantastic second season) I want more of it...Which is why I'm writing this review. My explicit goal in writing this review is because I hope that you will buy this show, thus increasing the chances a third season will be made. Though I hope a third season will be created please do not misunderstand me. I am not a salesman. I will not mislead you or exaggerate to you certain information of this review to trick you into buying this show. This show, admittedly, does have some serious faults with it. (Nearly all of them in the first season.) However, I felt that the strengths of this show vastly overcame its faults to make one of my new favorite shows and provide a very entertaining experience. (Again, ESPECIALLY in the second season but more on that a bit later.) Speaking of loose ends, to be honest there are quite a few of them in this show. I will let you find them out for yourself what they are, but don't be deterred! Every single major plot line is actually resolved in this show. A show that actually has some kind of plausible resolution seems to sadly be becoming more and more of a rarity these days, but this show DOES have a resolution...Which may make some think there is no need for a sequel. Depending on the person, that view may have merit. But in this case I strongly disagree. When talking about this show it's important to realize that, regardless of having an actual resolution, there are still quite a few loose ends and PLENTY of more material to draw from the Manga. This isn't Cowboy Bebop or Neon Genesis Evangelion, people. This was made from a Manga which is STILL ongoing. In fact, if this show weren't made in 2009 amid all the economic turmoil, I feel that a third season would have DEFINITELY been created. However it was created in 2009 and I can't change that. The only thing that can get this show a third season now, two years later, is sales. Lately sales are really the bottom line for ANY show. That's why it is SO important to BUY and SUPPORT the shows you love. (This goes for any Anime.) These days, any show is at the mercy of sales. Don't let your favorite show be one of them. EVERY sale counts. In this industry, a mere few hundred sales can be what decides if a sequel/continuation will be made or not. Your purchase matters...more so then perhaps any other entertainment industry. I apologize for throwing this activism bulls*** at you, but it's important you realize that.  If you can't purchase this show, then make an effort and support it in other ways. Watch what is available legally online through the Funi youtube channel or Hulu. Write reviews. Recommend it to your friends, acquaintances, or people online and try to get them to buy it. If you or your friends decide to buy it; then make an effort to buy it new. Write an email to Funimation or A-1 pictures that you'd love to see another season.

Anyways, now that we got we got that information let's move on to the actual review.

I'll start with one huge question. HOW DOES someone whom is looking for something GREAT show to sate the now empty hole which was left by finishing a show like Cowboy Bebop, a major classic in its own right, come to love such a show as this? I mean, this show is flying so far under the radar it's a wonder that I even came across it, let alone loved it. The simple answer is that the premise of this show is one of the most unique ones in any anime I've ever watched. (Please don't confuse the 'premise' with the 'setting'. The actual setting of this show is pretty mediocre in terms originality. It's the PREMISE I'm talking about here.) What exactly is the premise of this show? (Or introduction rather.)  Well, to put it bluntly, this premise is that of a galactic police officer named Birdy. Birdy, according to the description on the back of this case, is described as a, ""Jaw-Dropping, pinup [beautiful] sensation with a secret....[She] hits the street as a lethal, interstellar federation agent charged with nailing the most dangerous criminals in the galaxy."" Well, I can safely say that that description is a rather misleading one. It should have said, ""This is the emotional drama of a galatic kickass agent named Birdy and a normal boy named Tsutomu Senkawa. Whom, through a cruel twist in fate, must come together to save the world and come to terms with their pasts, presents, and futures"" as it is MUCH more accurate.

In addition to that, we also have a front cover featuring Birdy, midair, holding onto the rail on the side of an apartment building, (Like Spiderman) seemingly half naked, while there are multiple explosions going on in the background... It would almost seem like Funimation is trying to advertise this show as an action anime of sorts... perhaps along the lines of Black Lagoon. This, to me, is the totally WRONG approach to this show. The, ""action,"" being advertised on the cover is, in reality, not the main focus of the show at all. If it's action you are looking for in this show, you will very likely be very disappointed. What action there actually is in this show is mostly in the early episodes of the first season...and that action PALES in comparison to other action shows such as Hellsing: Ultimate, Code Geass, and Black Lagoon's. Rather the action scenes are more a plot device if anything...They are there within this show to make it much more believable and in-line with the fact that Birdy is actually Galactic Federation's Police Officer who goes after alien criminals on Earth. Personally, I think it would be much more accurate to think of this show is more of a coming of age drama and a thriller. (Because there are two primary plot lines; That of Tsutomu and that of Birdy.) The first half/season of the series obviously focuses on the first plot line, that of a high schooler Tsutomu, while the second half/season of the show focuses primarily on the latter, Birdy. The first season was mediocre while the second season was spectacular. (Giving the show a ""good to excellent"" rating overall.) I believe that, had the show continued in that direction, it could have been considered one of the greatest anime ever, or at least one hell of a great anime. (I think it can STILL BE one of the greatest shows ever...Or at least right up there with other great shows. Had it continued in the direction in was going before ending, and improving upon the animation.)

Also, there's something else I want to discuss regarding this show. (Which is actually in this case a big downside/flaw with this show...Especially in the first season.) While I can't really explain why the suit Birdy wears in combat was made the way it was. It's an obvious dead fanservice giveaway. (I don't think I need to explain why as you can simply look at the cover.) Not only that...It doesn't even look cool nor believable. (Sometimes female uniforms can be pretty badass, as seen in Black Lagoon.)  I mean, we have a police officer that works for a futuristic galactic organization...and their armor leaves females half naked?!? This fanservice literally just KILLS many serious moments at first. It doesn't even match the tone this series sets much at all. In addition to this, Birdy's cover job while working on Earth is working as a bikini model. Let me just say this right now...That whole sub plot is just flat out bad, and doesn't fit in at all with the whole show altogether. The idea behind this was that it'd let a certain character put dots together while giving fanservice at the same time...However, the previous statement could have quite as easily been accomplished without all the fan service; keeping the tone that is prevalent in this series.  After doing a bit more research I learned that these things was not even up to A-1 studio, but the material was actually like this in the original manga before the animators got their hands on it. So the studio gets a pass on this one. The good news it that there are certain things done by the studio to minimize the damage from this forced fanservice, and over time the initial effect of this initial fanservice is reduced to a point that it doesn't have an negative effect on the plot. (Again, this is season 2.)

I believe I mentioned earlier that the action and animation isn't all that great in this show. I wish to expand on this some more, because that statement may be misleading. The animation isn't bad (Not at all.) but is simply different. I found the animation was actually quite good for the emotional yet suspenseful tone that this show attempts to set and for those scenes and whatnot...I simply found that the animation was simply not the greatest type animation for the action scenes. However, even though the animation isn't the greatest...The way the action scenes are choreographed (Especially in the latter parts of the series) are superb, thus somewhat balancing out that aspect of the show. (Once again, the second season's action scenes are a drastic improvement over the first season's.) You'll really see what I'm talking about in the inevitable flashback parts of the series. (Which you will see if you watch the show. Though, again, this is in the second season.) The parts I'm talking about are very emotionally driven, the action scenes choreographed perfectly.

Okay, so now that we've gone over the primary flaws of this show. I wish to quickly transition to the show's great strengths.

To quickly sum up everything I said before this point. There are pretty much two major plot lines in this show. (Which are about the two primary protagonists) That of Birdy (The super-hot model slash Galactic Police Officer.) and that of Tsutomu. (Average High Schooler.) The series primarily focuses on one character in one season and the other character in the other.  I found the part regarding Birdy to evolve into something great while the part regarding Tsutomu to be very lacking. (Tsutomu's plot line is primarily in the first season.) Now, you've heard me state about ten times that the second season is much, much better then the first season. However, even though there are a ton of faults with the first season it does still have its moments. (It was entertaining enough where I kept watching it.) Particularly in the beginning. The PLOT LINE of Tsutomu is very lacking...but the show doesn't start out like that at all. It's after the amazingly unique premise and beginning that the show then begins to devolve into your standard high school melodrama.  The ending of the first season is also pretty good as well. (It tricks you into thinking it will be a predictable one...yet ends pretty decently.)

Look at me... Stating how certain parts of the show are great and lacking while you have no clue what the heck I'm talking about. Let me give you an iota of information so you actually understand just why this plot of this show is so unique. For reasons I will not divulge in this review, Birdy and Tsutomu must share a body. However, unlike nearly every single other case of a male/female sharing or swapping bodies in a show. This is not a romantic comedy. (For the most part...) and this happens for a logical purpose. I genuinely felt bad at the start of the show for what happened to the title character. (No joke) The beginning of the series was very strong.  It's only AFTER the beginning, when the love interest and cliche end-of-the-world plot is introduced, that the show begins to drag (That is...until the second season!) After the first season ends, the first part of the second season consists of flashbacks into Birdy's past. After that...the series adopts a very dark revenge plot to it. (Which I found to be spectacular!) The love interest in the second season isn't NEARLY as bland as the first season's, either. Being an avid reader, the second season reminded me somewhat of The Count of Monte Cristo (Arguably the most powerful and famous revenge story of all time.) by no other then the famous Alexandre Dumas. To give you a specific idea of the difference in tone...It's almost as if in the second season the rating jumped from PG straight to R.

This show really delves into a theme I really think is the strongest theme in all of storytelling. That theme is Fate vs. Free Will. This theme has been around for just about ever. (First made famous by the great poet Homer in The Iliad and Odyssey.) I strongly believe this theme is the most universal of all themes as it can tie into just about any conflict. In fact, just about all of the world's strongest stories incorporate this theme into it. This theme usually consists of a struggle of the primary characters going against a pre determined fate of what they're supposed to do versus what they actually want to do. Typically, the more subtly this theme is incorporated the better the theme is executed. (This would best be described as a cliche plot versus an original plot.) For example, the arguably most famous and highly regarded anime of all time, Cowboy Bebop, takes an original spin on this theme by providing a story of a bunch of characters that have already somewhat escaped their fates yet shows how their ""fates"" catch up to them in the end anyways.

This may be a confusing idea, so I'll give you a few more blatant examples: Black Lagoon, Phantom:Requiem for the Phantom, Hellsing: Ultimate, and Deadman Wonderland. Every single one of those shows (Especially Black Lagoon and Hellsing: Ultimate.) where popular in the NA last I checked. All these shows feature a normal character whom fate has chewed, spit out, and left for the dogs. All the protagonists in all these series should have all failed. Yet the characters in all these shows transform and overcome, rather then succumb, to their fates. We can really relate to these characters because, since they are depicted as normal, (at first) the events that happen to them tend to be much more believable in their given universes. Birdy the Mighty is more in line with the way these other shows portray this theme. (Yet is still unique enough to stand on its own.) One of Birdy the Mighty's protagonists, Tsutomu, a very normal person, gets chewed up and spit out by a strange accidental twist of fate. He should of died. Instead, we see him end up in a body of a galactic police officer. It's through this relationship that we are drawn into Birdy's world. It's through this relationship that we can see a normal cliche relationships as much more unique ones. (Though in Tsutomu's case the relationship is so cliche that it only ends up as mildly entertaining, rather then memorable.) However, it was seeing these characters overcome their basic challenges in their uniquely given environment that makes these shows so entertaining. (When talking about Birdy the Mighty...) Sure, there was out of place Fanservice.  Sure, the plot dragged at times. Sure, just about every side character and one protagonist was mediocre and forgettable. However, in the second season we become accustomed to the fan service. (Because there is no more introduced.) We move are introduced to a much better plot and characters, and show's tone and feeling becomes much more dark and mature. (A perfect analogy would be to say it's as if the show jumped from a PG straight to R rating. )

All in all, I felt this show had potential. Massive, massive potential. It gets really exciting once the second season comes around, and you start to realize that this series ACTUALLY starts to show just how great everyone thought it could be all along. The beginning of the first season and the second season of the show where both awesome. I felt that, had the show CONTINUED in the direction it was headed...Perhaps by expanding the given conflict of the second season to an even greater one. (Which was hinted at throughout the entire course of the show.) And had it CONTINUED to improve it's animation and action scenes...We could have had something Phenomenal. In fact, I STILL am holding onto that hope some two years after the fact that this could happen. Whatever the case, I feel that this show currently stands close enough to the edge of greatness that it is still a very entertaining show overall. I stated earlier that I thought you should buy this show and forget the rest. However, I'm going to change that and say to still buy this show- but just go ahead and watch the entire thing online immediately. This is a hidden gem, folks. (From 2009 nonetheless....a year that was considered a dark age of sorts for anime.)  You will NOT regret (In the end!) the time spent experiencing this show. In terms of emotional drive, I felt this show was right up there with Ga Rei Zero and Cowboy Bebop. I give this show a...

6.5/10 for the First season.

9.5/10 for the Second Season. (Including the bonus episode that is The Cipher.)

So a final score of 8/10 overall.

Thank you for reading and Best Regards,

Blitzkrieger Man.

P.S. If you liked this review then check out my other reviews as well! I spend a lot of time on them because these shows all mean a lot to me and I feel obligated to support them. I typically spend what time I have available writing reviews for less popular shows, as I feel those shows usually need the support more. However I still plan on writing reviews for a few more popular shows. (Namely, Black Lagoon and Hellsing: Ultimate.) Don't be afraid to thumbs up and comment!",1357948800,4,21859,4.640568475452197

This anime is very well done. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all excellent. It took a few episodesto get into it, but a very serious and emotional story unfolds. Love and loss are major themes in this series. The characters have depth and are very likable. There is a lot of action, drama, suspense, romance, and a little comedy. It's a very well rounded show. The animation style reminds me a bit of K-On; at least in the character designs. It's rated TV MA. I assume it's for violence. The violence can get pretty heavy. There is nothing that I would consider nudity in this series. There is an occasional bare rear end scene in the bath tub, but that's it. There is a lot to love about this series.

4849504,5,B005NQ5LN2,"This is a hidden gem among all the big budget anime titles. I will admit it lacks the flashy CG of all the big budget films, but what it has is solid substance. The plot is well constructed through out the entire series; it did not leave major questions unanswered, nor dropping the balls at the end like so many seemingly great titles did. (Remember Evangelion? 15 years and it still doesn't have a proper ending to the series. I really hope Evangelioin 3.3 does not disappoint.) It has in-depth character development which mainly focuses on the two central protagonists. You will see that the wimpy guy is not so wimpy after all, and the seemingly happy-go-lucky bubble head actually has a very complicated past. In short, everyone got their own side of the story which clearly gives the central characters tangible emotions. The animation is solid in terms of 2D graphic; though it could really benefit from a larger budget on the visual side.

Overall, this is a lesser known great animate.",1336089600,21,994,4.745664739884393

8480704,4,B005NQ5LN2,"Anime just crossed the half century mark; therefore it should not be that much of a surprise that over the years a lot of anime has been remade.  Sometimes it was as obvious as making color versions to replace black and white; other times it has been replacing shows that were famously never finished, but Birdy the Mighty is a little unique: it is the first anime I know of in which the manga was also rewritten by the original author, resulting in fairly significant and noticeable changes in the anime based upon it.

The first version of the anime, based on the first version of the manga, resulted in four OVA episodes telling the first adventure:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Double-Trouble/dp/B00015HUUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty - Double Trouble</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Birdy-the-Mighty-Final-Force/dp/B0001KNHU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Birdy the Mighty - Final Force</a>, but going no further.  The second version of the anime, based on the second version of the manga, resulted in this show, having no connection with and showing considerable differences from (and improvements to IMHO) the first one, presumably based upon the differences in the manga.

The biggest change is in the character of the human high school student who must share Birdy's body while his is being regrown after federation police officer Birdy recklessly blasted it to pieces while pursuing alien criminals attempting to hide out from interplanetary law on a blissfully ignorant planet Earth.  In the first series he is a cowardly, gutless, whiny pain to listen to, even when he has valid points against shoot first, ask questions later Birdy.  However, in this second series Tsutomu Senkawa is a much more quiet and serious fellow, which makes his advice to Birdy a lot more important.

Another big change is Birdy's brand new false identity (and necessary income source) on Earth as rising idol singer Shion Arita, something she absolutely HATES doing but which gives creators endless opportunities to lampoon the heck out of.  The stories are a lot more complicated, too.  Season 1 primarily concentrates on a mysterious weapon of mass destruction that goes missing on Earth, which various people are seeking in various places for various reasons and which horrifically surfaces in a surprising place towards the end.  Season 2 primarily concentrates on a group of alien prison escapees, connected with the theft of the infamous weapon of mass destruction of the first season, who are disguised on Earth but while hiding from Birdy and the law, learn that someone (or something) else is hunting them down in order to brutally kill them.  In both cases it gets and stays serious, despite lots of comical antics.

Note: The DVD arrangement is a little confusing.  You've got the 13 episodes of Season 1, followed by the 12 episodes of Season 2, followed by an OVA episode; however, since the OVA episode belongs (and makes the most sense) BETWEEN the two seasons, you should watch it like this: episodes 1-13 on discs 1 and 2, episode 26 on disc 4, and episodes 14-25 on discs 3 and 4.",1488931200,5,3220,5.3777335984095425

Quickly came to start watching this, I couldn't understand how I've never heard this show till now.  I was glad to have watched and purchased this when I had the chance because it's out of print now and not avaible( in eBay some copied are around). The only warning would be the animation, it would dip here and there and I didn't notice a difference till the last ep of the second season. I am proud to own Birdy the Mighty Decoded. Just wish it would have been longer..",1487376000,,649,4.319672131147541
