189231,5,1572522410,"Ming-Liang Tsai has never failed to deliver the goods when it comes to describing our postmodern existence in an Asian city. Vive L'amour tells a story of three persons in an empty studio apartment in Taipei. It is a  manage-a-trois that never happened. This movie is not for the  faint-hearted. Its poetry lies in its sparseness. Imagine, there's only  about 30 mins of dialogue in the 150-min movie! Watch the pivotal 10-min  scene at the end of the movie where the female protagonist walks round a  park, sits down and cry, all in one take. Vive L'amour shows us all the  things a good movie should be, what Hollywood films have consistently  failed to do.",951091200,15,659,4.678260869565217

La copia editada por Zafra es aceptable, pero celebro poder ver esta gran obra del director taiwans.",1411948800,,333,5.072727272727272
189356,1,1572522410,"I enjoy a good, slow-moving drama. Christmas In August, Chungking Express, Virgin Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors, The Way Home, Springtime in a Small Town, Hana bi, Eat Drink Man Woman, Dolls, In the Mood for Love, and Spring Summer Fall Winter Spring are all enjoyable films - just to name a few.

Unfortunately, there is a subset of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the coattails of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves. These are what I call IAN films - ""Incomprehensible Artistic Nonsense."" Tsai Ming-liang is the king of this subgenre, and Vive L'Amour is his ""masterpiece."" In fact, this is the crme de la crme of crap-infested garbage under the guise of ""art."" People walk around in their apartments, drink water, stroll back and forth waiting for pay phones to become vacant, hang posters, staple papers together, go to the bathroom, eat, do pushups, have sex, slap at mosquitoes, etc. I'm not joking when I say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film, which is the quintessential posterchild for pointless art-house trash. There is no plot, no storyline, no interesting or noteworthy events, no emotion, no meaningful dialogue, and most importantly - no drama.

The most eventful scene has two people ""banging"" on a bed with a person masturbating underneath the mattress - ironic that it's also totally tasteless and gratuitous. The relationship of the characters on the bed is practically non-existent. Tsai apparently didn't feel like communicating anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to ""bang."" The person under the bed is just as one-dimensional and uninteresting. He likes to drink water, makeout with melons, and stroke himself. This is Tsai's idea of ""character development."" A truly misguided ""entertainer"" indeed.

Tsai's true contribution in Vive L'Amour is perhaps the most atrocious scene in art-house film history. He first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for 285 consecutive seconds, only to then show her cry hysterically - for absolutely no reason whatsoever - for another 356 consecutive seconds. The film then abruptly ends. No point. No entertainment. Just pure, concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer.

In an effort to beat a dead horse. The underlying theme of loneliness is mishandled so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom. In fact, Kiyoshi Kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film Kairo. And guess what? It's actually INTERESTING! That film moved as slow as molasses in January, but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as Vive L'Amour. Kairo is a perfect example of that.

Fans of cinema may thank Tsai Ming-liang for directing this film, as he has provided irrefutable evidence that art-house cinema can be just as poorly made as B-grade, made-for-television horror flicks.",1280966400,3,2975,5.05091649694501
189357,4,1572522410,"One of the best of Tsai Ming-liang's glacial case studies of contemporary isolation and alienation in Taipei/the world, VIVE L'AMOUR is gripping in spite of it's extreme minimalism (his work shares this quality with Tarkovsky or Antonioni). Tsai's work is superficially very chilly and ultimately heartbreaking - though Tsai also (as always) manages to also sneak in a little deadpan humor, which in this case includes the rather ironic translated title.

Three young, outwardly successful Taiwanese happen to cross paths - unknowingly at first - in the empty Taipei condominium one (a real estate agent) is attempting to sell. Through a bare minimum in dialogue - VIVE L'AMOUR is essentially a silent film until about 20-30 minutes in - Tsai charts their isolation and fumbling attempts at various kinds of human connection and finding some personal sort of peace. Tsai's scenario and characters are globalized, stripped of most marks of identity, and very much adrift, and their growth (or lack of it) is communicated through sparse forms of acting, direction and cinematography that reinvents seemingly antiquated forms of film-making (again, silent film) into a new-millennial era. In this, Tsai crafts a sort of haunted, elegaic drama that slides around the limitations of language, inhabiting a dreamlike, if also very dark, psychological territory.

Typically Tsai uses no musical score, and the dialog is very sparse, with the film favoring the natural sound of whatever environment the characters find themselves in, so the many memorable scenes do tend to sneak up on you. The finale is unforgettable.

189358,4,1572522410,"This three-person character study--a straight man, a straight woman, and a gay man--has for its title a bitterly ironic homage to love, using a phrase in French (that most romantic of languages) to convey a story, if it could be called that, which focuses sharply on two of its three characters, using the third as a foil for the other two.

The popular translation of the title is ""Here's to love"", or ""Long live love""; it's a phrase that's used as much (if not more) in American circles as in French. But this is really a drama with sadness and loneliness as its two companion muses or driving forces. The gay man makes a semi-real attempt to kill himself; the woman, in one scene, cries alone, long and hard. They do these things because, it is clear, they cannot really express what love is, they cannot feel what love is, they cannot really connect to another person to give and receive love.

The third person, the straight man, blithely carried on his trade as an illegal street vendor, engaging in liaisons with the woman in the same unrented space in which the gay man himself hangs out. In one powerful scene, the two straights make love on a bed, directly underneath which the gay man engages in autoerotic behavior. It is clear that the gay man wants the straight man as much as the woman does.

The irony of the film transcends the title as well. The woman is a real estate agent, but has trouble finding paying customers; thus, her space is not valued. The gay man sells ""columbaria"" which are urns to house the ashes of the cremated dead; thus he is, in effect, a real estate agent for the dead while the straight woman is a real estate agent for the living. The gay man has no shortage of paying customers; the straight woman can't find one. Space reserved for the dead is more valuable than that for the living.

Tsai Ming-liang, the director, has to be counted as one of the most interesting contemporary working directors. Having now seen The Hole, Vive L'Amour, and Goodbye Dragon Inn, I can say without any doubt that he is a truly unique filmmaker, one to definitely keep an eye on.

Highly recommended. I will definitely see Tsai's other film The River as soon as I can.",1118880000,6,2193,4.513853904282116
189359,5,1572522410,"I've watched Vive L'amour three times now, and like it more each time. The film's slow pace is especially effective at drawing us into sympathy and compassion for these characters, making the ending so devastating. The use of visual space to suggest isolation, loneliness, and the difficulty of connecting with others is powerful too (it reminds me of Todd Haynes' excellent SAFE in this way, and in others). Even though modern/postmodern life mostly offers a dehumanizing set of changes, there is hope in the filmmakers' use of cinematic magic to encourage affection and compassion for these three lonely people. Not a happy-go-lucky viewing experience, but one that effectively challenges the shiny lies of modernization.",1111276800,4,723,5.350877192982456
189360,3,1572522410,"This movie intrigued me when I saw part of it on a few years ago.  I recently purchased it and timed the film at 23 minutes before any character dialogue begins.  It is a film about the feeling of isolation in a changing world.  The people are making their way in life without a feeling of community, family, and direction.  You see and feel their sense of despair and yearning to connect with someone even if it is under peculiar circumstances.  I give it three stars only because it lacked some elements that would have made me feel something for the characters.  I realize the director probably did that purposefully to drive home the point of being disconnected from community in a large city.  It was like a voyeuristic look into the lives of people who are on the edge emotionally.",1094774400,4,787,4.539007092198582

189362,5,1572522410,"Just adding to other people's comments. Briefly, one ""well-adjusted"" man (Chen Chao-Jung) enters the life of two lonely individuals (Yang Kuei-Mei and Lee Kang-Sheng) in urban Taiwan. One of the ideas I like most is that one makes physical contact but experiences only one brief moment of emotional comfort; one experiences emotional comfort but only one brief moment of physical contact.
The acting from the 3 stars is totally natural and convincing. The long periods of ""silence"" is beautiful and effective.
Mandarin with English subtitles that you can't turn off. But this is not a problem since there is little dialogue. No Chinese

189363,4,1572522410,"Director Tsai Ming-Liang handles the character of Hsiao-kang (Kang-sheng Lee), a young gay man full of loneliness, uncertainty, restlessness and shyness, with a great deal of tenderness, gentleness, mercy and parental affection. We don't know a lot about our character Hsiao-kang going in, except that he's ostensibly an educated, white-collar professional in sales; he's gay and he's suicidally depressed at the opening of the film. As the movie unfolds (like a quiet flower) however, we begin to realize that Hsiao-kang's depressed because he's unfulfilled, because he's lonelier than hell; he needs to find love; he's desperate and going a little nuts -- he doesn't seem to have a friend in the world. Luckily our director is so compassionate; instead of allowing his protagonist to get away with killing himself, he instead offers Hsiao-kang a second chance at life, and there is evidence by the end of the movie -- Hsiao-kang is no longer quite so suicidal, but is indeed endeavoring to work through his feelings more constructively, and struggling to connect better with others, especially with another man he's deeply interested in. Yet the struggle ahead of Hsiao is enormous, and director Tsai is not a sentimentalist. ""Life is hard"" could be the mantra for everything that goes on in ""Vive L'amour"" (ironically titled). Or as James Joyce put it, ""life is a wonderful, wonderful opera, except that it hurts!"" Life does hurt; for all of us. Bottom line: We care about what happens to poor Hsiao-kang. We want him to heal, to be okay with himself, to come to grips with who he is and what he wants, to get over his seemingly insurmountable obstacles (interpersonal as well as intrapersonal), and to find fulfillment(s) in life. Director Tsai Ming-Liang makes us like him. We yearn for Hsiao-kang's happiness, and we cheer him on... We would like to see a sequel to ""Vive L'amour"" in which Hsiao-kang continues his life's heroic journey, and hangs onto life's balance-beam courageously. And come to possess the man of his dreams too! We want that for him. Everybody needs to love and to be loved in this universe. In Buddhism we are taught that ""the meaning of life is to be happy and to make others happy."" This movie is a very effective ""Part 1"" or prequel to that much-wished-for denoument for this very brave young character. Our heart goes out to him, and to his creator.",998956800,7,2382,4.913151364764268

Slowly, quietly they  affect the others' lives.  Elliptical, dreamy, with spare dialogue and a  rigorous, deliberate pace, Tsai-Ming Liang captures a palpable sense of  unrest and disquiet in a lanscape of skyscrapers and industrial ooze.  The  setting's Taipei, but the characters could be in any big city; alienated,  desperate for connection and unable or unsure of how to reach the other  souls.  There are moments of hilarity and disconcerting emotion, but  ultimately the film creates a sense of quiet horror; in Liang's mirror, we  are just ghosts taking up space in the concrete.",959299200,21,792,5.198412698412699

This movie is beautiful, full of emotion, and masterfully shot. We are forced to confront the three protagonists' loneliness through precise long shots (most notably the final scene in the film).  Tsai is a master of creating mood and feeling through a minimalist approach to dialogue.

I gave this film 4 stars after reading some of the critical reviews saying that the film was unrealistic & about people who were not normal. This film is about loneliness and sexual need. I find it easy to believe that there are a lot of people who live lonely unfulfilled lives.

I liked the way the characters were presented -- unsentimental, but sympathetic & non-judgmental. I basically know nothing about Taiwanese film history & maybe my ignorance is showing, but my impression of what Tsai was doing here was presenting three people without traditional intimate relationships seeking connection with a partner as best they can.

This is a very honest film about loneliness and unfulfilled need.",1501027200,4,764,4.9147286821705425

But it is also the film that established Tsai Ming-liang as a cinematic voice to be reckoned with in the Taiwanese New Wave, and in world cinema more generally. His trademark long, static shots, inscrutable gazes, eroticization of loneliness, and obvious growing love for his lead actor Lee Kang-sheng, are among the elements that would soon make up his distinctive and celebrated aesthetic in films like WHAT TIME IS IT THERE?, THE HOLE, and GOODBYE, DRAGON INN.
