8461180,4,B0057XETKC,A real person I recall from my many years in NYC and in The Village. The man featured and documented in this film has unfortunately died within the past few months. I read about it in The NY Times online and that led me to the link to this video.  He is and remains an inspiration to anyone who's lucky enough to view this hard to find dvd. Seet this titile out. You'll be well rewarded.,1361836800,,387,4.092105263157895
