8450435,5,B004ZQYZCE,"I love the game of golf and its history; this book furthers my knowledge; Tiger lends his name to the introduction of a great book detailing the frustrations and determination of African-American golfers who all they wanted to do was to play the game and compete at the highest level they could achieve.  Compared to the same aims of ""white America"", it was ""no comparison""-- they were denied that opportunity at every frustrating turn.
Tiger came through, Lee Trevino came through, Seve came through from the sands of Spain, they all exhibited determination, hard work, will to win, and we loved them all. Many others lost their way, but greatness does not come easy. Excellent book on the subject, read and learn. Enjoy",1449705600,2,721,4.861788617886178

8450439,5,B004ZQYZCE,"The story line was historic the movie was very informing. And in my opinion all of the records pre 1965 when the Caucasian only rule was in effect in the PGA they should have and asterisk by their names because they are only Caucasian records NOT World Records. And the fact that that Ben Hogans and Charlie Sneads and the Byron Nelson's the Arnold Palmers and Jack ""The Golden Bear"" Nicklaus's that were winning all the tournaments back in that era weren't man enough to stand up for the Black players says a lot... And let's not leave out Mr Bobby Jones I'm sure Mr Teddy Rhodes would have given him a run for his money as well. But just like the title says in order to win they had to kept it "" UNEVEN""",1371859200,,705,4.229629629629629

8450441,5,B004ZQYZCE,"This DVD is excellent.  However , like golf , it must be for the elite because it is ridiculously too high a price for the average person, especially a "" poor ""  black or caucasian, etc, to afford.  It's analogous to the very true story that the DVD is telling .",1322956800,,262,4.098039215686274
