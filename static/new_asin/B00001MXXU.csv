1245339,5,B00001MXXU,"Volume 4 of Paramount's reissue and refurbishment of Classic Trek contains two outstanding stories which provide continuous entertainment and enlightenment.
Charlie X is a remarkably frank and moving study of adolescence, with a supernatural twist.  Robert Walker, Jr's. awkward Charlie Evans may well be the most sympathetic ""villain"" in the Trek canon.  Anyone who has ever embarrassed himself during adolescence (who among us hasn't?) will feel for Charlie and the agonizing loneliness he endures.  William Shatner has some surprisingly subtle moments as Kirk tries to explain the facts of life to Charlie.  This episode also contains a glaring continuity error:  When Kirk enters the turbolift en route to the bridge, he's wearing his standard gold tunic, but when the turbolift doors on the bridge open, he's wearing his green v-necked pullover!
Balance of Terror consistently winds up on nearly every Trekker's top ten list.  This story gets a lot of its flavor from the classic submarine film Run Silent, Run Deep.  Viewers who have also seen the recent U-571 can also see the influence of this episode on that movie:  Both stories contain an ""enemy alien,"" Spock in this episode, Wentz in U-571.  Kirk's forthright confrontation with prejudice (""Leave any bigotry in your quarters.  There's no room for it on my bridge."") should be part of a training manual for company managers.  Mark Lenard's scenes aboard the Romulan ship have an almost Shakespearean gravitas.
The picture is remarkably clean, considering the source elements are over 35 years old.  The sound has been enhanced with stereo effects, although this has not been overdone.",990576000,6,1647,5.244274809160306
1245340,4,B00001MXXU,"In Charlie X, one of the two episdoes on this DVD, puberty and other ""forbidden"" social issues are explored and discussed. Nature vs. Nuture is a largely posed question - role models and thier importance  another. (Big notice: Uhura sings in this episdoe, worth the price  alone! )
The second episode, Balance of Terror, the Federation is  finally ""tainted"" with an enemy. The Romulan Empire, while never  really explored again until TNG, plants a very powerul seed of dread and  ""terror"".
Both episdoes are very entertaining, and enjoyable.  A fun addition to any collection.",962928000,,576,5.074468085106383
1245341,5,B00001MXXU,"BALANCE OF TERROR is one of the best Trek episodesever...definitely within my top five Trek stories across all itsvarious incarnations.

1245343,4,B00001MXXU,"Being a huge Trek fan, I'm glad to see that Paramount is releasing all of the classic episodes on DVD.  And they are all digitally enhanced and remastered from their ""Special Edition"" showing on the Sci-Fi  channel.  Which brings up the biggest problem I've got with them so far.  The Sci-Fi channel changed the opening credits on several of the earliest  episodes before a massive outcry caused them to restore the credits to the  way they SHOULD be.  I figured when the DVDs came out, Paramount would see  the error of their ways and restore the original credits. Not so here.  Charlie X features the new credits sequence as a different version of the  classic theme. (If you listen closely you can tell). Thankfully, this error  is corrected on later releases, but surely Paramount should have known that  if anything, we Trekkers are meticulous about details concerning our  favorite show.
Not that this should turn you off of these magnificent  DVDs.  The digitally enhancement and super sound more than make-up for any  minor defects. And Charlie X and Balance of Terror are two of the finer  early entries from the Star Trek universe. Charlie is a study in tragedy,  the first work from the great D.C. Fontana and Balance features the first  appearance of the Romulans as well as a superb chess match between Kirk and  the Romulan commander.  The episodes stand up well, even after over 30  years of repeat viewings--they are still fresh, entertaining and original  (something I doubt will be said about Voyager in 30 years)
All in all,  two Treks well worth taking.",952387200,5,1573,4.805243445692884
1245344,4,B00001MXXU,I loved re-discovering it again.  But I gave the DVD 4 stars for the lack of Spanish in the dubbed/subtitled options.

The transfers are gorgeous, though the audio does drop out here and there  (problem of remixing mono to stereo...and certainly harder to make mono  surround).
I think the Sci-Fi channel interviews would have been cool to  add to these episodes, but I also understand that licensing doesn't always  go smoothly.  Perhaps we can get some DVD's at the end of the series  release that has all the interviews on a single disc?  (maybe even with a  coupon in the last few discs that will give you the interview disc(s) free  with proofs of purchase of several of the episodes?)

1245346,4,B00001MXXU,"I hadn't seen Balance of Terror before, and I must say, it's one of the best episode. It's sort of Das 'Boot in space and the introduction of the  Federations first space-bound enemies, the Romulans. Charlie X was ok, I  liked the scenes where Kirk is being a father figure, and it was kind of  creepy that you didn't want to make the kid mad because of his powers.  Think ""Twilight Zone: The Movie"". Some behind the scenes stuff  would be cool, but why include it when they can sell it seperately right?",940896000,2,504,4.376344086021505

1245348,5,B00001MXXU,"In ""Charlie X,"" Robert Walker plays another of Gene Roddenberry's mad omnipotent beings, in this case a young man who was given incredible power by benevolent aliens to enable him to survive on a barren planet.  Rescued by humans, he lacks the social skills, maturity, and self-control to use his abilities responsibly and soon endangers the crew of the Enterprise.  This is an excellent episode with several chilling moments; a brief shot of a faceless young woman groping along the wall really freaked me out as a kid and remains effective today.  The theme of ""power corrupts"" had not yet become the Trek clich that it would, but coming so soon on the heels of ""Where No Man Has Gone Before,"" one can definitely see a pattern developing.

""Balance of Terror"" introduces the Romulans and features a cat-and-mouse game between the Enterprise and a new generation of Romulan warship that has been sent across the Neutral Zone to probe the Federation for weaknesses.  This was the first episode to place the Federation of Planets within a geopolitical (spacial-political?) context that would set the stage for the many stories and arcs concerning the confrontations of galactic superpowers that is a particular strength of the various Trek series.  Mark Lenard gives a commanding performance as the Romulan captain.",1123286400,2,1314,5.060185185185185
1245349,5,B00001MXXU,"Charlie X

Conducting a rendezvous with the transport ship Antares the Starship Enterprise takes onboard a seventeen year old passenger named Charlie Evans for transport to Colony Alpha Five. Charlie who was the sole survivor of a transport ship crash fourteen years prior on the planet Thasus was orphaned yet still he somehow managed to survive, learning how to speak by using the ships library tapes, and after the ship's supply of food concentrates had run out found other things to eat just growing around. Having had no human contact all that time proves to be tough on the young man, who desperately wants to be accepted by the people he comes into contact with on the Enterprise. Charlie finds his first experience dealing with women, especially Yeoman Janice Rand extremely awkward. Charlie has more than a passing infatuation with Yeoman Rand, and this infatuation leads Charlie into an embarrassing encounter. Imitating some friendly interaction between two male crew members that Charlie witnessed earlier the eager young man gives Yeoman Rand a friendly pat on her bottom in response to being asked to meet her in the recreation room after she's off duty. Flustered Yeoman Rand suggested that Charlie talk to Captain Kirk or Dr. McCoy and ask one of them what he did wrong.

Upon taking Yeoman Rand's advice Charlie seeks out Captain Kirk with whom Charlie starts to look up to for an etiquette lesson in regards to dealing with women. Jim Kirk who feels commanding a starship with a crew of 428 easier than giving advice about women to a teenage boy finds the experience new and confusing and is saved from further awkwardness by having to respond to an urgent call from Captain Ramart, commander of the Antares. Kirk heads to the bridge with Charlie tagging along and upon arrival the duo find Lt Uhura desperately trying to establish communications with the Antares which was transmitting at full output, Captain Ramart started to give Captain Kirk a warning when suddenly the channel went dead, Uhura attempts to reestablish contact with the Antares when Charlie makes a comment about the ""poor"" construction of the cargo ship arousing some suspicion from Kirk. Conducting a sweep with probe scanners Spock verifies that the Antares has been destroyed.

Kirk, lamenting the destruction of the Antares and the twenty crew on board while engaging in a ""friendly"" game of chess with Mr. Spock discusses what happened to the Antares and how Charlie seemed to know what happened before they did they did. Charlie who has developed a ""crush"" on Yeoman Rand experiences feelings that frustrate and confuse the young man which in turn make life uncomfortable and awkward for Yeoman Rand who enlists the aid of Captain Kirk for some ""fatherly advice"". Kirk lays it all out for the seventeen year old with raging hormones prompting Kirk to not only bust Charlie's bubble concerning Janice but also that life isn't always fun or fair.

Kirk in an attempt to help Charlie try and forget about Rand and relieve some stress takes Charlie to the ship's gym for a little workout and a lesson in self defense. Kirk attempts to teach Charlie a throwing technique which Charlie doesn't perform so well proves disastrous as one of Kirk's crewman who is also working out in the gym as well playfully laughs at the frustrated young man. Charlie who is embarrassed at not being able to get the throw right and is livid at the fact that the crewman is laughing at him makes him ""go away"". Shocked at witnessing his crewman disappear and even more shocked at the fact that Charlie was responsible for making it happen orders security to come for Charlie and escort him to his quarters. Resisting the security guards with his powers Charlie forces Kirk to threaten him with punitive measures if Charlie doesn't comply. Charlie relents and reluctantly goes with the security guards who are weaponless thanks to him.

Meeting with Spock and McCoy in the briefing room Kirk and the two senior officers discuss what happened in the gym and the danger the awkward teenager with the powerful weapon within him poses not only to the Enterprise but to the population of Colony Alpha Five as well. Theorizing that Charlie caused the destruction of the Antares, a theory which proves to be true the trio realizes that they are in the hands of a dangerously immature and unpredictable adolescent. Charlie starts to exert his control over the Enterprise by locking it on a course for Colony Five and cutting off communications despite Kirk's attempts to change the course of the ship away from the colony so they can buy some time and warn the colony's governor about Charlie. Charlie who punishes Kirk and Spock for not being nice and who makes Janice Rand the women he is obsessed over ""go away"" for slapping him across the face is in full control of the ship and crew and uses his power to get even with those who annoy him or get in his way. Kirk who must stop Charlie at all costs sees a window of opportunity in stopping the ""boy"" who lives in a man's body, realizing that Charlie may have over stretched himself in controlling the whole ship decides to tax him further by turning on every device, light and anything else in hopes that Charlie can be distracted so he can be tranquilized until the ship reaches Colony Five. Kirk takes the chance and plays the dangerous game with the powerful teenager.

The plan proves be successful and just as Kirk is about to deliver the knockout blow to the boy, a ship from Thasus arrives to take Charlie home. The Thasians who were supposedly only a legend taught him the power of molecular transformation which allowed him to survive those fourteen years on Thasus. Remorseful at the destruction of the Antares which the alien beings cannot change the Thasians undo all the harm Charlie caused the Enterprise and her crew. Charlie who desperately wants to stay with the Enterprise and who desperately pleas for Kirk to let him stay shows some kind of remorse at what he's done. The Thasians reject Kirk's offer to let the boy stay with the Enterprise and his own kind take the fearful, panicking yet dangerous remorseful young man away.

This episode gives Kirk a chance at being a father figure and there are some humorous results.",1110499200,2,6258,4.799628942486085
1245350,4,B00001MXXU,"Star Trek: The Original Series Volume 4 presents two episodes originally aired in 1966:
""Charlie X:"" A troubled adolescent with powerful telekinetic abilites comes aboard the Enterprise and horrifyingly subjects the crew to his undisciplined, torturous powers. Writers Gene Roddenberry and Dorthy Fontana serve up a mature and utterly captivating yarn of space horror that further explores the ""power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely"" theme, which was well presented in the (second) pilot ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"" (episode #2). Highly memorable. GRADE A+
""Balance of Terror:"" The Enterprise plays cat and mouse with a cloaked (i.e. invisible) Romulan ship in this space version of ""The Enemy Below."" This is Mark Lenard's first role for Star Trek as the Romulan commander. He is much better known as Spock's Vulcan father Sarek, who first appears in the second season episode ""Journey to Babel"" (episode #44). Interestingly, Lenard would also go on to play a klingon in ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture."" He thus holds the distinction for being the only actor to play a Romulan, a Vulcan and a Klingon on Star Trek. Bottom Line: Okay, but generally boring; ridiculously overrated by some. Grade: B- (I'm being generous)",1069977600,2,1238,5.226130653266332
1245351,3,B00001MXXU,"Two good early episodes of classic Trek, though ""Balance of Terror"" is by far the better.  The other episode is not bad, but I always hated when they used little kids as the terror of the week on ""Star Trek"".  Having said that, ""Charlie X"" is not nearly so terrible as the unwatchable ""And the Children Shall Lead"" from the third season.

Notable Historical Milestone(s): First holiday (Thanksgiving) ever celebrated on a Star Trek episode
Expendable Enterprise Crewmember (`Red Shirt') Confirmed Casualty List: 0 Dead, 1 Rendered Temporarily Nonexistent
REVIEW/COMMENTARY: One of the earliest examples of the oft-overused `Kirk Openly Defiant Against A Malevolent Entity Possessing Superior Powers And Abilities' format, our beloved captain tries to be a father figure to the nigh-omnipotent teenage menace, Charlie Evans, resulting in quite a few weird and awkward moments. As the show goes on, however, these moments become less awkward and significantly more uncomfortable & dangerously life-threatening. Although I disliked how Chuck-o misused his powers, he did score a bit of sympathy (and not a bit of envy) from me when he made Uhura go mute in the middle of a little ditty she was singing in honor of the lad. Boy, I wish I had that ability whenever Uhura starts to croon one of her tin-eared standards. Hey, wait a minute-- I DO have that ability: it's called a Mute button!
Smart-Aleck remarks aside, another notable moment in this show is the galley chief's intercom message to Captain Kirk on the bridge. The man doing the voice-over is none other than Star Trek creator/writer/producer/what-have-you Gene Roddenberry! And all you ladies out there will really appreciate seeing Jimmers' manly pecs as he shows Charles a few defensive maneuvers in the ship's gymnasium!

Notable Historical Milestone(s): First appearance of the Romulans; first vessel equipped with a cloaking device
Expendable Enterprise Crewmember (`Red Shirt') Confirmed Casualty List: 1 Dead, 1 Incapacitated
REVIEW/COMMENTARY: Somewhat resembling a space-bound Run Silent, Run Deep, Balance of Terror pits our gallant Starfleet stalwarts against a Romulan foe whose vessel can be rendered practically invisible. Fortunately, our Enterprise stalwarts use all the resources they can muster as they outduel this military threat to their Neutral Zone monitor outposts. Throw in a little pinch of trouble between Spock and a distrusting helmsman, and a dash of Kirk starting to second-guess himself out loud to a sympathetic Dr. McCoy, and you've got a decent bit of tension to make the situation even more dire and suspenseful!
Mark Lenard-- best known in Star Trek lore as Sarek, father of Spock-- achieves the honor of playing the first Romulan ever seen by the Federation, and by TV audiences. A Romulan who, perhaps a bit too bound by his duty for his own good, seemed almost too sympathetic a character to deserve and accept the unfortunate fate that he simply was unable to escape. Them's the breaks...

1245354,5,B00001MXXU,"Volume 4 is one of the better pair of episodes that The Star Trek Original Series DVD collection has to offer.  Both are classics and have been considered some of the series better Trek stories.
The first one here is ""CHARLIE X"" which was one of the first Trek episodes I ever saw.  It is a rather tragic tale about a bizarre young teenage boy with extra ordinary powers.  Charlie (played by Robert Walker Jr.) was the only survivor in a ship crash when he was a little baby.  Somehow he survived for 17 years until he was rescued by The Antaris another space ship.  However when he is brought aboard the Enterprise, a misunderstood Charlie tries to fit in and if he is unsuccessful the crewmen feel the rath of his powers.
Pretty soon the crew feels fairly threatend by the teenager especialy Yeoman Janis Rand who Charlie has began to show a liking to.  It is up to Capt. Kirk to stop Charlie from destroying the enitre Enterprise crew.  It turns out the Charlie was raised by a group of bizarre aliens who gave him those powers however because he was not taught the human way of life, Charlie is considered extraordinarily dangerous and is not allowed to lead a normal huan life.  Therefore the tragic thing is a misunderstood human boy must spend the rest of his life with a group of aliens who have no feelings or emotions.  Somewhat of a sad end if you ask me.
The second episode is ""THE BALANCE OF TERROR"" which remains a favourite among many fans of the show including me.  Capt. Kirk is sent to investigate and help earth outposts that have been attack by a mysterious vessel.  It turns out to be the Romulans ,whose star system is close by.  As the Romulan ship begins to head for home, the Enterprise begins to pursue it.  For if it reaches the neutral zone between the Federation and Romulan star empires it could lead to an intergalactic war.  This episode is like a submarine movie almost which pits the strategic mind of Kirk against The Romulan Commander (Mark Lenard whom would later play Spock's dad!).

7914453,5,B00001MXXU,"The well-acted 'Balance of Terror' needs no introduction.

I must say, the title 'Balance of Terror' has sometimes confused me. The phrase, 'Balance of Terror' would accurately describe the episode 'A Taste of Armageddon' as well. The reverse may also be true.

I was surprised how much I like 'Charlie X'. I remember it as being a kind of flakey episode where Charlie, a normal kid, becomes a super-human. Does he become husband to a super-human girl as they lead out across the Galaxy? Reading a synopsis of the story, I must say, it doesn't sound interesting at all. in retrospect, I do like these episodes, perhaps reminiscent of Q, that feature near omnipotent aliens. I've seen most every Star Trek episode, shown as a rerun on TV (most of them three times or more), or should I say, I've seen parts of them (perhaps missing the first few minutes or missing something while in the kitchen). Watching Charlie X was almost like watching a brand new episode or watching the episode for the first time (thinking it was a dumb episode has its benefits).

What we have here is adolescence condensed into a 60-minute episode. The episode is wonderfully acted by the guest star, Robert Walker Jr. Having been marooned on a distant planet as a young child, Charlie interacts with humans (the crew of the Enterprise) for the first time. He's now 17 years old or so. Adding to his difficulties as an adolescence, Charlie is a bit odd looking. He does give a great performance. Charlie falls in love with Janice Rand, or Yeoman Rand.

Charlie asks Captain Kirk for help on the matter. James Kirk, the man, has little to tell him. Mr. Kirk is not the expert on relationships. His answer reminds me of the 'Mirror Mirror' episode what Kirk tells his girlfriend, from the mirror universe, 'You're the captain's woman until he says you're not"". A wise man knows there is much he does not know. At the same time, William Shatner has more to say as an actor, saying nothing, than most actors can through an extended dialogue. It is clear the two will have to spend more time together. There's much, much, more to captain Kirk than what appears on the surface. William Shatner turned the role of Captain Kirk into an iconic one.

It is quite interesting, after Janice Rand spurns Charlie, James Kirk invites Charlie to the ship's gym. Kirk shows Charlie some fighting and training moves, as if, if this is not the male answer to the confusion of adolescence, then it is certainly the answer to being loveless and spurned by a woman.

There's something more going on here than Charley's desires and confusions. It doesn't take too long for the crew to realize what the audience watching at home has already been clued in to, that aside from being confused and anxious, Charlie also has superhuman powers. His powers are similar to what would be shown later by the 'Q'.

This episode suggests that power does indeed corrupt. If any of us had unlimited power, we would act without care toward the rest of the world. At the same time, Charlie is trying to fit in. Giving Charlie so much power, perhaps, allows us to view the period of adolescence with greater sympathy.

In the end, those who have given Charlie these powers (who can't even take on physical form, and given Charlie these powers so that he could survive as a marooned child), arrive to take Charlie away with them, back to where he was.

It was kind of interesting or sad, that the crew's response to Charlie, is always a military one. As the episode progresses to the end it becomes more of an open conflict. They are 'at war' with Charlie till the end. Leonard Nimoy portrays Mr. Spock once again as being incredibly loyal or portrays him as exhibiting incredible loyalty. There is a scene where Mr. Spock is unintentionally cruel to Charlie. If this is intended to show no hard feelings are meant (that Spock isn't really trying to hurt him, or if the scene is intended to warn the audience against being unnecessarily cruel, is hard to say).

Charlie, being given superhuman powers, would have to remind one a little bit of the Twilight Zone episodes like, 'It's a Good life'.",1492560000,,4129,4.6438356164383565

STAR TREK is the fore runner, the original, the first, everything else that followed are simply copies.  Even STAR WARS (with all caps just like STAR TREK) is a copy.  George Lucas copped all of his material from Gene Roddenberry.  If there had been no STAR TREK, there would have been no STAR WARS.

The special effects were 1967 TV effects, STAR TREK was top-notch for its day, nothing like it had been done before.  I'm still enthralled when I watch my DVD's.  The acting also top-shelf, all of the actors in the original series were and are excellent at their craft, completely respectable.

The series had no gratuitous sex scenes, no f-word, no graphic guts spilling, unlike the garbage put out by the Hollywierd miscreants of today.  The STAR TREK movie that came out a few years ago was absolutely stupid and worthless.  The movie could have been a great tribute to STAR TREK, but instead it was a modern Hollywood crap disappointment.

Using the frozen ions from comet magnitude 7, he hopes to discover the Romulan ship and destroy it, ""a big gamble"".  The Romulan commander realizes the tactic and order full evasions orders.  Stiles thinks that a Romulan spy has reveal the commanders tactic and eyes Spock suspiciously. Kirk orders blanket phaser fire which damages the Romulan ship and kills a centurion. The Romulans shoot their plasma weapon, but the enterprise retreats and escapes because the weapon has a limited range. The Romulans return on course to the neutral zone, ""once inside they can claim we violated the neutral zone"", says Kirk.  Captain Kirk needs permission to enter the neutral zone, but proceeds without it.  The Romulan captain tells his officers, that Kirk wants them to waste their energy and it ""will take all his experience to get home"". ""We have lost them"". ""Don't destroy the one named Kirk"".  Spock accidently touches a control which gives the Romulans their position.  Kirk responds with fire phaser bursts. ""We are beaten"".  The Romulan ejects debrie into space and his centurion friend. ""Glorious"" ""Now we go home"" ""They are at your mercy"".  This is the fatal mistake for the Romulans. Uhura takes navigation, stiles to weaponry.  A phaser bank overloads and releases toxic gas, stiles passes out, Spock enters, fires the phrasers, and rescues Stiles.  The Romulan commander appears on screen and tells Kirk, ""In a different reality I could have called you friend"" and presses the self-destruction button while saying, ""One more duty to perform"".

7914461,4,B00001MXXU,"2 more additions to the continuing episodes of the first season: ""Charlie X"" which is strikingly similar in storyline albeit different in setting to a very memorable ""Twilight Zone"" episode and ""Balance of Terror"" where we are introduced to the Romulans, that cousin race to the Vulcans which evolved in a very different direction.

""Charlie X"" echoes a theme from the first episode in this series, ""Where No Man Has Gone Before"", by asking the question, can man given great powers suddenly be able to act responsibly and for the good of all or will he eventually end up destroying all around him?  A young boy is given incredible powers, ""Q-like"" using TNG lingo by a bunch of well-meaning aliens who are simply trying to save the sole crash survivor from certain death on a desolate planet.  Charlie is finally rescued by a Federation vessel which is extremely happy at being able to pass him over to the Enterprise.  The final scene is touching as the painful and difficult decision about how to deal with this troublesome teen is made.

""Balance of Terror"" is a little less complicated plot-wise but very importantly introduces us to the Romulans who play continuing and recurring roles throughout the entire Trek-dom.  Curiously, the Romulan commander here eventually is re-cast as Spock's father Sarek in later episodes although none of the crew seems to notice.  This episode is one of the better space battle episodes where we see Kirk and his counterpart pit their wits against each other in a winner take all contest.

Gene Roddenberry's ideas are also represented here in a very interesting element where the clear anti-bigotry stance shown by Kirk when he tells a crewman who is prejudiced against Spock and his resemblance to the Romulans to ""keep your bigotry in your quarters as there is no room for it on the bridge"".

2 of the better episodes in the series and a keeper.",1147564800,,1887,4.817337461300309
7914462,5,B00001MXXU,"Balance of Terror illustrates a moral dillemma of a DMZ.  DMZ represent a stalemate and the pride and arrogance of two nation engaged in a conflict with nether nation willing to admit defeat and end the useless conflict.

The Romulans ended a 70 year war with the Federation.  Undoubtable the Federation make numerous errors; the Federation had superior military power and the Romulan territory should have fallen as a Federation domain.

The peace treaty establishing the Neutral Zone could not be enforced because Federation Ships could enter intentional or accidentally into the zone.  The Romulans using cloaking technology had the distinct advantage with the capability too move through the neutral zone into Federation space undetected.

The Romulan empire was impoverished.  The Romulan empire was not a Roman empire of great power.  The Roman empire continually extended its power through constant conflicts throughout the middle east and Europe with many nations becoming subject to Roman rule.  The Romulan empire does have an Roman like form of government, a military ruling class, and a warlike society.  However, the society is N Korean pour.  They have no industry, they are a constant threat too the federation, and historical silent for the last 70 years, in the activity of the world.  The Romulans are desparate for Federation technology, education, and help.

Kirk defeats the Romulan cloak ship, but fails to understand the Romulan crisis.  The Romulan ruling class arrogantly ignore the suffering of their people.  The Romulan people are arouse to militant hatred of the federation, the only people who can liberate them from their improvishment.  The Romulan empire never built industry, thriving and prosperous societies, nor prevail militarily against the Federations, Western Warfare - democratic way.  Only Spock, a distance relative to the Romulans would understand their desparation.  However, one could see Spock's cowboy diplomacy would be ignored by the Federation for another 100 years and the Romulans would continue in their peril.  Some Romulans want free trade, new idealogy, and freedom; the Romulan empire will not die immediate and just as the Roman empire last 20 decades in decay, so will the Romulan empire continue its slow descent down.

The Vulcan hold the best hope for the Romulans.  The Vulcans are skilled educationally, prize peace, and possess technology; Romulans have a false sense of superiority and pride, but they are increasing impoverishing the people from long military campaigns against the Federation.

The Romulan empire does not value free trade and the Vulcans are not wanted by the ruling elite.  However, some of the Romulan elite want a trade agreement between Romula and Vulcan and hope for reunification between the two peoples.  Eventually Romula will begin too break down and look to Vulcan for support.",1133049600,2,2874,5.307522123893805
