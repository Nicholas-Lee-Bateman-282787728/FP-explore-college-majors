7947991,3,B00005NX1G,"After learning of her origin, Meifon is distraught and seems inconsolable. Kosei takes her away with him to a small village on a distant planet. Together they begin a new and peaceful life. Before very long, Goryu sends yayoi to them with a deadly virus. He threatens to unleash it on the planet if Meifon doesn't come to face him. Defeating him is also the only way to get the antidote for Yayoi. Meifon and the crew of Angel Links go into battle one last time.

This was shaping up to be a great ending. I loved the idea of Meifon and Kosei running away together. The final battle was a bit anti climactic, and the ending was disappointing. I must say, that even though the end wasn't what I had hoped for, it was a bit touching. Overall, this series is pretty average. I think that most of us have checked this one out b/c it is an Outlaw Star spinoff. There are some very small similarities like Duuz and Valeria; but Angel Links may as well be it's own unrelated show. Unfortunately, it's not all that impressive. I think that I'm glad I watched it, but I'm still a little let down.",1359417600,,1087,4.328431372549019
