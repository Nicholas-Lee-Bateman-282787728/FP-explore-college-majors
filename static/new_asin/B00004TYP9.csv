7923270,5,B00004TYP9,"This is a delightful collection of independently-made film shorts by budding African-American directors, and some of them will definitely become household names in a few years, if these are any indication.

I'm looking for Volume 2, which I will definitely purchase.

These folks are nothing less than talented geniuses, and I feel lucky to own some of their ""before"" works.",1417651200,,374,5.216666666666667
7923271,5,B00004TYP9,"I can't add much to what has already been said about this DVD, but I am glad that I stumbled upon it in the video store. I'm not sure why it's titled ""Afrocenticity,""--because it's not really about that, but the focus of Black filmmakers and their work definitely fills a void in the filmmaking industry. For what we get with this DVD is a collection of work by artists who are serious about their craft and are not making up something for a quick buck.
One of my favorite pieces is ""Kings,"" a short film about young successful attorney who is forced to confront where he has come from and where he's going. It's conveys a prevelant theme amongst many African people who have been successful in White mainstream corporate America, but who also are struggling to understand how they keep ties with the community in which they grew up. The directing and cinamatagraphy of this piece are very well done. A warm, soulful mood is set throughout the piece that make for a compelling short story.
Muhammida El Muhajir's ""Hip Hop: The New World Order,"" may be lacking in her camera work, but she makes up for it with her international travels to document the impact of Hip-Hop in places like Japan, France, and Cuba. I hope this piece is made into a full production.
And finally, I liked ""Breakdown,"" which to me has sort of a Hitchkock influence. I won't say anymore about the plot, because it would give it way. In the end, though, the story is not oringinal, it's a fine piece of storytelling that is directed, shot, and edited with serious attention to the craft of filmmaking.
I really look forward to future volumes of short films like ""Afrocentricity."" These type of collections serve to expose the work of young or unknown artists who are trying to work within and beyond the mainstream.",1006473600,3,1787,4.622641509433962
7923272,5,B00004TYP9,"This is an OUTSTANDING COLLECTION of INNOVATIVE SHORT FILMS that feature some of the most promising young AFRICAN-AMERICAN DIRECTORS!  CHARLES STONE III offers ""True,"" the hilarious short that introduced the now infamous ""Whazzup"" guys from the Budweiser commercials!  JEFF BYRD manages to get VANESSA WILLIAMS to star as the only survivor of a shoot-out at a bus station in ""Breakdown.""  LEE DAVIS directs ""A Gut Feeling,"" which follows two cops on a routine call that goes very, very wrong.  CHUCK WILSON's ""Breakfast as Ben's (my personal favorite), is a moving story of a young man who works his way out of the ghetto and tries to give something back to the community.  NIVA DORRELL offers ""Kings,"" where a successful attorney has to make some very tough choices when his past catches up with him.  TANYA BOYD, from ""Days of Our Lives,"" presents ""The Gift,"" based on a true story about a blind sculptor who is offered the chance for surgery that can restore his sight.  MUHAMMIDA EL MUHAJIR's documentary ""Hip Hop: The New World Order,"" which looks at how that particular musical form has gone world wide.  Each of these films is accompanied by an INTERVIEW with the DIRECTOR, some of whom provide AUDIO COMMENTARY.  This is a WONDERFUL COLLECTION of short films by directors we will be hearing a lot about in the FUTURE!  More importantly, VOLUME 1 suggests there will be more volumes to come, which is great news indeed!",1002758400,2,1426,4.855371900826446
