7967554,3,B00006FDC3,The quality of music videos are of 3.5 out of 5. Definitely were taken from a VHS and once in a while you'll see VHS spots across the screen. The sound and image are decent but not DVD remastered quality. Every other video you'll notice the logo of make it or break it.com appear at the bottom of screen to advertise the former music video distributing company.,1484006400,,361,4.402985074626866
