6446031,1,B00KTFJ7SW,The content of the tape and the art work was awful. I was very diasppointed with the animation of this movie. It looked as it it was made in the 18th century.,1414022400,,158,3.96875
6446032,4,B00KTFJ7SW,"What if a stranger who seemed to know everything about you appeared one day and told you that both of you were gods that had lived for millions of years... had been worshipped and feared in the past as rulers of civilizations?

That question is the spark that starts ""The Eternals"", a motion comic derived from a Neil Gaiman comic book of the same name. I'm not a comic book fan, but I was enamored with this story--warts and all--as the story of these super-human gods, their monolithic creators, and their grotesque rivals. The main storyline is interesting with the characters rediscovering their identities; however, the back story detailing the origins of the Deviants and the influence of the Celestials is the real star of this 88 minute feature.

For those looking for a self-contained story, this will be a disappointment since several loose ends exist at the end of the story; there really isn't a climax to this story at all! At the same time, other stories like the Civil War and Druig's tyranical rule as a dictator are introduced and never resolved. That's not a knock against the writing, though. It's just a precaution for those who aren't familiar with comic book storytelling.

Otherwise, the art is decent and the voice-acting is really good. I much prefer other artists over Romita, but there's no denying he's talented.

I've never read the comic series nor did I have any knowledge of the story going forward, but I've seen all of these motion comics and they do a good job of making sure anyone can pick these DVDs up and be able to follow the story. There's one special feature with artist, but not much else. Worth picking up, but I wouldn't put it anywhere near the best of these Marvel Knights products (I still think ""Inhumans""  and ""The Astonishing X-Men"" quadrilogy are the best).",1411689600,12,1810,4.733333333333333

6446036,5,B00KTFJ7SW,"Gosh! Huge pressure, first review.....but I loved it! Preorodered it & watched the day it arrived straight through. I enjoyed the Marvel Knights titles to varying degrees, & I don't really remember the Eternals from the '70's that well, but John Romita Jr's reboot is simply awesome. I felt like a little kid reading comic books again. This is almost my favorite of the Knights series, the exception being the X-Men.",1411084800,,416,4.873239436619718

6446041,1,B00KTFJ7SW,"I just got ripped off. I ordered Eternal and InHumans, both came in really fast and packages looked fine. Neither DVD will play in blue ray, ps3, HD DVD player or regular DVD play. It's like they are all scratched up, though visually you can't see any scratches.  I realize this is a low budget order but it's very upsetting when I'm a customer who has spent over 4,000.00 just this year alone.",1435190400,,394,4.397260273972603

6446047,2,B00KTFJ7SW,"The label of ""Animation"" on this DVD is misleading. Most of the DVD is like looking at comic book scenes with voice-overs. A great storyline, but after purchasing a couple of DVD's like this, I am not going to continue doing so. I'll simply buy the comic somewhere.",1423180800,,265,4.541666666666667
6446048,5,B00KTFJ7SW,"Love this stuff I want more. It would be even better in true animated style with no continuous re-threading of the intro. All in all great stuff. and REMEMBER this is stop art animation. Some folks get this confused with television animation, this is different. ENJOY!!",1423094400,5,269,4.869565217391305
6446049,3,B00KTFJ7SW,"First you must understand that this is NOT traditional animation. It is called a Motion Comic. Basically what it is is the comic book- which is the source material- has been scanned and manipulated to appear to move. They then add sound effects, lighting effects and special effects as well as voices and music. Having said all that, I love this format. I look forward to seeing more comics brought to life like this. Doing traditional animation is very expensive and takes a lot of time so this is the next best way of bringing great stories to life.
Now to review Eternals. The story is where this movie somewhat fails. It has a great start. It will hold your interest for the first half easily. However the last half gets bogged down with really complex plot twists, even confusing at times.
This is my first Motion Comic and it hopefully is a good start to better ones coming soon.",1422921600,5,885,4.5375
6446050,3,B00KTFJ7SW,"its ok, which  it had better animation. love the eternals but the animation was like reading a comic book on line. did not expect that.",1421020800,2,135,4.4
6446051,3,B00KTFJ7SW,"Very disappointed!
I was first introduced to the Eternals many many years ago in a Thor comic series. Back then I was intrigued and impressed with the story line and how the writers incorporated them into the Asgard origins. I also seem to remember a TV series or comic book series many years ago that I was able to follow with reasonable clarity as to what was going on. So when I ordered this Marvel Knights Eternals DVD, I was hoping for at least something I could sink my intellectual teeth into. In stead, what I saw was a strange and extremely confusing series of episodes that so poorly told a story that I eventually stopped caring if I ever understood it.
I don't know who is responsible for the script but they really blow it. They have simply forgot that if people can't understand what they are watching, they lose interest. Even if there is some kind of sense to the story, figuring it out is far to much trouble than it is worth. But in spite of this, at least it has interesting features that make it watchable. Interesting characters, who have interesting powers and all that stuff.  And while the art stinks there are a few segments that you will be able to follow for a little while. So be warned, if you don't like confusion,don't bother with this one. Only die-hard Eternals fans could possibly like this.",1419379200,2,1325,4.4979253112033195

6446053,3,B00KTFJ7SW,"While not so enjoyable as any of the other Marvel Knights comics, it's premise is very intriguing, even if not fully flushed out and realised. I was left disappointed that its end was so wide open and unresolved. If there won't be another season, this will leave you unfulfilled.",1417564800,4,279,4.714285714285714
6446054,5,B00KTFJ7SW,"This is a motion comic, which means it is not traditional animation but the actual comic panels themselves manipulated to move.

I really enjoyed this one.  It's interesting when Marvel Knights decides to do a storyline that otherwise might not get adapted.  I had never even heard of these characters so it was a lot of fun for me.  The writing is really solid though I feel like there were some details that could have been explained a little better.  None of it was enough to stop me from enjoying it though.  A part two might have easily solved this minor issue.  Sadly I don't believe one was ever written.  Regardless I think the animation is getting better and so is the voice acting.

Can't wait to see what they give us next!",1417478400,3,734,4.458646616541353

8661342,1,B00KTFJ7SW,"Being a Marvel fan, I had not heard of this series. Ok the illustration is tacky but its Marvel - it should have something personal, redeeming, adventurous...something - right? The story was VERY slow to develop (and I typically like a good setup). More of the issue was my shock at how nasty the content was. Graphically nothing foul, but the content of dialogue is rotten and displays the worst of how people speak. I was confused how this even came out. Big Thumbs down.",1502496000,,473,4.576470588235294

8661346,2,B00KTFJ7SW,"This is an excellent Eternals story. The art is excellent, the story is outstanding, the music is great, but the presentation is awful. This story is broken down into a series of too short segments. To watch each segment, you have to sit through this ridiculously long title sequence that is okay the first time you see it, but then you want to make it go away and you can't. So you have to sit through nearly a third of the time spent on each segment watching this stupid sequence that you have memorized by the second viewing. Poor planning. They need to have  a viewing option that allows you to watch the whole thing uninterrupted by the annoyingly redundant credit sequence. Someone needs to get this whole series turned around because all the other Marvel Knights animated features have the same problem. Incidentally,, I have no problem whatsoever with the animation methods uses here. They essentially take some detail of the printed page and make it move with relatively simple animation techniques. I assume this is way less expensive than animating the whole story from scratch. I not only don't mind that but I enjoy it as it gives a very interesting, arty feel to the presentation that is terrific. I just can't get past the repetitive titles micro segment problem. Mine is going to the yard sale!",1461974400,7,1310,4.720524017467249
