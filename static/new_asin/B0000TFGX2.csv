1942885,5,B0000TFGX2,"After watching this DVD, I have chosen to share its story with everyone I meet.
The Journey gives us a glimpse of the side of ourselves we normally hide away.
As a to-be college student, this film provided me with so much inspiration.  After showing it to my family, they were amazed at how much insight into their life they had gained.
This film is good for students, families, grandparents, educators, and basically anyone who needs assurance life is okay or needs a goal for their life.",1075766400,2,489,4.620689655172414
1942886,5,B0000TFGX2,"I came across this film 2 1/2 years ago in Atlanta in one of the first showings. I laughed, I cried and I thought. By turning the camera on themselves and showing their positive and negative sides, it allows the viewer to let their guard down and accept the awesome lessons, that this film has to offer. I've seen it
9 times on the big screen, have taken countless friends, who all went back to bring others, and have bought 10 copies to give to friends. This is one film you won't regret buying.",1072915200,5,496,4.287234042553192
1942887,5,B0000TFGX2,"I first saw this extraordinary movie at its Atlanta premier.  That time I laughed, cried, giggled, and was so touched that I've seen it in theatres 5 other times and now own the DVD.  It is real, honest and a terrific learning experience - for us all.  The stories that Eric captures are real and heartwarming - as well as occasionally heartwrenching, and every person I've shown this to has connected with the movie on some level.  It reconfirms my belief that we all have stories to tell to share with one another - we just need people like Eric to capture them.",1069372800,2,564,4.446601941747573
1942888,5,B0000TFGX2,"The first time I saw the Journey in Atlanta, I started looking at life through a different lens.  This movie is truly the most inspirational and uplifting movie I have ever seen!  Getting the DVD is the best purchase I have ever made.  BUY THIS MOVIE!",1069372800,3,251,4.413043478260869
1942889,4,B0000TFGX2,I saw a screening of this movie in Manhattan I believe 2 years ago - roughly October 2001.  It was a very unexpected ride through their journey meeting with Henry Winkler(I won't say too much else)a few barriers and alot of interesting steps along their way.  This movie is definitley worth picking up and watching with a few friends.  Everyone will get something out of this film.,1067472000,3,381,4.656716417910448
1942890,5,B0000TFGX2,"This movie is absolutely amazing. I have never been effected by a movie like I was after viewing this. I laughed, I cried, I thought long and hard about myself and where I was going in my life. There is such a strong message in this, I recommend this to everyone I talk to. But to attempt to describe it to anyone diminishes the film. It means something different to everyone and it is truly something you need to see. Buy this movie, you will not regret the time you spend with Eric on his journey, nor will you will regret the time you spend after watching it thinking about your own journey in your life and exactly where you want to go. I cannot wait to see what Eric does next.",1067472000,3,682,4.174242424242424

8002506,4,B0000TFGX2,"This documentary is inspirational and funny at the same time. It encourages you to just ask for help whenever needed. At worst, you can be ignored, at best you will receive the help you asked for - and more.",1157328000,,207,4.333333333333333
8002507,2,B0000TFGX2,"Hey... I bought this hoping to see interviews with Jerry Garcia, and other prominent and famous people yet was disappointed when such footage was not in the film.

From the description it seems like such content is on the dvd but no it is not.

Interesting people are on for seconds, and I only felt an emotion to this film maybe once or twice.

The whole film is about ""what do I do with my life, yada, yada""... meanwhile!...!..... the guy who made this film- the main dude in the movie- is makin money off the film. So thanks man, make money off the people (who bought your movie) who really need direction in their life.

And also, thanks for having such a decieving description of your film, on the back of the DVD and on the product description on amazon.",1142294400,4,760,4.368794326241135
