3904479,1,B002C6VMKC,One expects a higher priced Blu-ray Edition to be an improvement over the DVD Release. This release omits the Raymond Burr Godzilla King Of the Monsters version. Now instead of passing thew DVD on to a youngster I'll HAVE to keep both. I will not get tripled dipped on this one. Classic Media dropped the ball with this release. They've tarnished their impressive record of Kaiju releases,1254528000,8,388,4.8059701492537314
3904480,3,B002C6VMKC,"I bought the 2 disc dvd of Gojira that was released a few years ago. I definitely prefer the original Japanese version of the film versus the U.S. cut. I was very excited to find out that this monster movie/horror classic was coming to blu-ray. I eagerly awaited getting this disc home and watching it. BE WARNED: this blu-ray only displays up to 1080i. The picture is not that bad but it could have been better. This film is in dire need of a full restoration; if it is possible. The video is a notch better than the dvd; but not breathtaking by any means. In Japan, Godzilla movies are coming out on blu-ray. Let's hope that some of them come out on blu-ray over here: preferably ""GMK-Giant Monsters All-Out Attack"", ""Godzilla Final Wars"", ""Mothra vs. Godzilla"" (1964), ""Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla"" (1974), ""Destroy All Monsters"", ""Godzilla vs. Hedorah"", ""Godzilla vs. Biollante"", ""Ghidorah The Three-Headed Monster"" and other Toho mammoth hits like: ""Frankenstein vs, Baragon"", ""War Of The Gargantuas"" and ""Rodan"". And hopefully they will be full restorations. After all the money we pay for blu-ray discs, we should not accept half-done, half-job upgrades. If anyone does not believe old films can not be totally digitally restored, watch ""Live And Let Die"" (1973), ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" (1951) and ""In The Realm Of The Senses"" (1976) Criterion Collection.",1254096000,17,1370,4.986899563318778
3904481,5,B002C6VMKC,"As with many here I have several versions of Godzilla on different media. I could not resist the Blu-ray offer. It is the original with an English subtitle option and a few DVD extras. But there was no effort to clean up the scratches from the old film. The scratches are clearer and sharper.  There is the obligatory overlaid commentary.

""He wanted us to be happy...""

We get a full Godzilla with the warning about what happens if you didle around with the bomb. The anticipation of the big lizard is lots of fun but if you have not seem the film before you will have to read the subtitles fast. Then you will need to re-watch the film to see the acting.

If you watch many Japanese movies you will notice that many of the actors are majors in other movies. Emiko Yamane is played by Momoko Kchi one of my favorite from ""The Mysterians"" (1957). The paleontologist is played by Takashi Shimura from ""The Seven Samurai"" (1954).

3904482,3,B002C6VMKC,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of Gojira.  Which Amazon, in its infinite wisdom, has not only bunched the reviews, but the contents of the regular DVD into the description.

I'm torn between liking this and hating this Blu-Ray version.  The picture is tight.  And I mean real tight.  The images on my Sony XBR 34 HD are practically 3D. The lighting, except for some natural blemish, is gorgeous just like the night scenes are beautifully hellish.  It's also cool seeing all the wires (FX) and folds of the G-suit in Blu-Ray tightness.  My complaints are the following:  This print should have been restored.  To have all the lines and scratches on a Blu-Ray transfer just doesn't make sense and makes you feel like you've wasted some cash.  I also believe that even in this ""original"" Japanese"" version there was a scene cut out.  I remember Ogata and crew travelling on a train and Emiko talking about how she survived Nagasaki.  At least I think I saw this in the Realto version when they had a limited release a few years ago in NYC.  I would have also like to have seen some sort of interview, whether made for the DVD or old newsreel clips, of the people who took part in creating the film.  Such as Ishiro Honda, Akira Ifukube and so on.  The extras provided by American fans are actually interesting but it would have been a nice accompaniment to have the real players involved.

That is all.",1253664000,10,1407,4.5458167330677295
3904483,5,B002C6VMKC,"Gojira BD has a great picture of scratchy lines, dirt and speckles covering good and not very good prints of what must have been a great cinema shoot. But, please have HD fun with my favorite monster and love the scratches. Aside from that, it looks and sounds better than the DVD. The disc is tuned for your system, the DVD isn't.
This Blu-ray is close to the print used on the DVD, adjusted a bit more than you can do on your TV;... and get it for that. But also/or buy the the DVD with the US Version with the Mythical Raymond Burr, who did a sequel!
Is it budget or creativity; this BD gives you a true 'retro' picture.",1253664000,,623,4.1570247933884295
3904484,5,B002C6VMKC,"There's a bunch of people saying that this is just the Americanized version of the film, but this is completely false.  The Japanese version of the film is included on one disc.  The original 98 minute Japanese version without Raymond Burr.  Everything from Classic Media's 2006 2 DVD release is being included on one disc here, except for the disappointing omission of the American version and the great commentary that went with it.

If I have on disappointment with this release it's that the disc appears like it won't feature any upgrades from the 2006 DVD version.  So you will get two documentary's, the creation of the Godzilla suit and story development, one audio commentary (which is outstanding), and the original trailer.  These are good extras, particularly the commentary, which is one of the best for any DVD, or Blu-Ray release that I have ever heard, but if you own the DVD you already have this plus the American version of the film and a commentary to go along with it.

Personally I was hoping that Classic media would wait until they could get Toho's brand new remastered print for this film.  That print is being released along with the rest of the Godzilla catalog starting now in Japan for about 68$ apiece.  In fact Japan's release of this film comes out this month as well.  The print used here is the same one that was used for the DVD release.  Which means it is serviceable, but there is a lot of print damage throughout.  Perhaps Classic Media is planning on re releasing this film in the future with the new remastered print.  We'll have to see what they do.

Regardless, if you already have the 2006 release all that your getting here is the same print with the same extras minus the American version of the film and the commentary that went with it, which seems like a waste of money to me.  If you don't own the DVD release or this Blu-Ray yet then I recommend sticking with the 2006 DVD release for now.",1253232000,4,1939,4.563583815028902
3904485,5,B002C6VMKC,"The only version of this film that I have see is with Raymond Burr. Going by the title, this may be the original Japanese version without Burr.

Quote from Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide: ""Originally released in Japan in 1954 as GOJIRA (a far superior film), at 98m; over 20m. were eliminated and inserts with Burr were added.""

Going by the title on the cover and the 98mins in the discription, this is more than likely the first release without Burr, that I have never seen. I hope this is the original Japanese version.",1252454400,,520,4.580645161290323

But I don't need to see it to rate it 5 stars, unless the studio does something really stupid with the transfer.
EDIT: I still give the original Japanese version 5 stars, but I have learned from the comments, and after reading
the review of the Blu-ray release compared to the Sony and BFI versions at DVDBeaver, the Blu-ray transfer is sadly lacking.
What a downer!!! I canceled my Blu-ray pre-order. I guess I will just stick with my Sony version which has the
original and the ""Americanized"" chopped up version with Raymond Burr on a seperate disc.

And the subtext of this version is so powerful that it hits home in a way the new one does not.  Don't get me wrong after seeing the new one in a regular theater I was impressed except for the ending and a few other things like a monster following our boats and not attacking them deliberately but only through unintended accident...but it was visually stunning to watch so I went back and saw it in a true IMAX theater and I can honestly say without a doubt it was the most visually stunning movie I have ever seen...and I'm convinced without a shadow of a doubt that hollywood can now create any movie they want and the audience won't be able to tell whether it is digital or real...I could tell...even watching it in IMAX...now if only they start getting back to telling great stories again...",1402099200,,1147,4.4523809523809526

3904524,5,B002C6VMKC,"I see a lot of grousing about the Raymond Burr version of Gojira (Godzilla) and feel compelled to explain why it was done. In 1956 there was still much anti-Japanese sentiment in the West. After all, the West had been involved in the most devastating war in history, a war perpetrated mainly by Germany and Japan. In order to make the movie acceptable for a theater release it simply had to be recut for western audiences. While in continuity and quality the Burr version is inferior it is still a superior scifi movie of that era. It also retains a majority of the original story line. The popularity of Godzilla led to the successful release of other Japanese sci-fi movies. So, I look at Godzilla with some affection because without the success we may never have had the opportunity to complain about its inferior quality to the original Gojira. Godzilla stands up well on its own, made a ton of money and began the invasion of Japanese movies into the USA. It doesn't deserve the opprobrium.",1339632000,,995,4.659090909090909
3904525,1,B002C6VMKC,"This is not a critique of the artistic or entertainment merits of the film itself.  I am restricting this review to the quality of the blu-ray release alone.

After watching blu-ray releases of black-and-white Japanese films such as the Seven Samurai and Yojimbo produced by Criterion, my expections were high for the quality of these release.  I was extremely disappointed.  Unlike the Criterion releases, there has been absolutely no attempt to re-master this film.  The film is full of scenes that are murky, grainy, washed-out and/or full of scratches to the film element.

This is not a nit-picky critcism of an extreme video/audiophile.  I don't know anything about technical specifications for home electronics such as dpi, compressions rates, etc.  I am simply reacting to what I see on the screen.  If someone as uneducated as myself can see the shortcomings of this release, it must be pretty bad.

It boggles my mind why this company would even bother to release this film in high definition blu-ray when they obviously have such poor source material to work with and have no intention of doing any restoration.

I sincerely hope Criterion, Studio Canal or some other company with a better track record for quality will aquire to the rights to this film so we can get a better release.",1318464000,6,1296,4.926267281105991

However Gojira actually contains a cautionary tale about the effects and use of nuclear weapons, since the radioactive monster could be seen as an allegory for atomic weaponry (the images of a Tokyo reduced to rubble are haunting to this day). The monster is created by the use of nuclear weapons and spews atomic breath. It is invincible to every form of weapon and the plan that ultimately destroys it is still wrought with sacrifice. The only real knock against this movie is the acting can be a little over the top and the special effects can reduce the impact of some of the dramatic scenes (the helicopter falling over made it all too obvious it was a cheap tiny prop).

3904529,5,B002C6VMKC,"Honda's Gojira is a landmark for contemporary sci-fi drama. This film resonates to this day with the Japanese people and with audiences all around the world. One cannot view this film without seeing the anguish and torment the Japanese people endured during the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August of 1945. Honda does well to respond and to collectively identify the Japanese people as a whole. Gojira, the monster, represents all the pain, suffering and turmoil that the Japanese people were afflicted with in the aftermath of the bombing. By showing a monster raging the city with nothing affecting him/her establishes the fear of future use of atomic/nuclear weapons. Honda does well to incorporate a sincere emotion towards the monster and towards the decision to drop the atomic bombs. In the film, the Dr. has to make the decision to use his Oxygen Destroyer or not. This is perhaps the film's most poignant illustration and response to the horrible and traumatic affects of the atomic bombs. In doing so, Honda establishes a human, intimate and deeply personal reflection. The Dr. kills himself after he kills the monster implicitly so that the instructions to make the bomb die with him and so that future scientists/countries won't ever be able to create or use the weapon again. This is a fantastic and deeply stirring film. Those who have an affinity for Japanese film, this film cannot be missed. Knowing the background of Japanese film and the inclination/obsession of Japanese filmmakers to constantly repeat the trauma their country has gone through is showcased in this film. The country finds a collective identity in this film as does the viewer. This is a great film.

It's a R2 PAL DVD but one of the few DVD's that actually looks better than its Blu-Ray counterpart.,1281916800,7,290,4.490566037735849
3904533,1,B002C6VMKC,"No matter how much you may want to see this film, DON'T BUY IT.  This transfer was made from a beat up, soft, poor-contrast 16mm print, and to release it on Blu-ray was nothing short of thievery on the part of Toho or whoever was responsible.  The film is worthwhile, but unless they issue a new Blu-ray transfer from good 35mm source material save your money.",1264291200,11,360,4.4393939393939394

3904535,3,B002C6VMKC,"This review is for the Blu-ray edition, and I am going to focus on the technical aspects of the release, not the movie itself, the movie is a great classic and should be seen in its Japanese original form, whether through this BD or the previous Classic Media DVD, that's your choice.

First of all, the movie is not 1080p is 1080i, which might be because it's not comming from a direct filmscan, but through an HDCAM tape, since it's a film, not TV, the fields show half and half of the frame and when a projector or the TV does the conversion to progressive you have the original frame, if you have your BD and TV/Projector properly set up you won't see any interlaced images.

The film is not presented in it's original 1.33 aspect ratio, the width is perfect but there is a slight loss in the upper and lower parts of the image (it is clearly seen in the original GODZILLA title, look at the lower right logo), therefore the aspect ratio might be around 1.45, still and improvement from the previous DVD release, it was 1.33 but because it lost both width and height.

There is also another HUGE problem: the Noise Reduction. Since it's a pretty old film, film stocks from the original movie are in pretty bad shape, and CM instead of performing a full restoration (a-la Criterion), simply applied an inmense quantity of automatic Noise Reduction, resulting in lots of jittering and screen tearing. To tell you the truth, when checking the DVD versus the BD, I found hard to decide wich was poorer in Image quality, but I guess that MPEG-2 is quite an old codec now, and the Standard Definition makes everything look slightly blury, so all in all I prefer the BluRay since it's coded in AVC. The sound only includes the original Japanese audio in PCM linear, wich is fine in my book (I hate dubs), and the subs are more than ok.

The extras are the same that on the DVD, nothing new, and they are presented in their original MPEG-2 codification.

I would never recommend this BD to any Godzilla fan if already own the CM DVD, since I truly believe that this movie will eventualy get a proper release. However if you have never seen the original Godzilla, and don't care about the american version... Hey! It's a Blu-Ray and IT'S REGION FREE! (tested on a PS3 region ""B"")",1259712000,31,2274,4.49636803874092
3904536,1,B002C6VMKC,"If you pick this up expecting blu-ray quality like I did, save your money. Whoever transfered this to blu-ray did so without ""cleaning up"" the film's imperfections first. It's full of scratches. I had the standard DVD release of this and was disappointed when i put on the blu-ray version and saw all the flaws still in it. They didn't even have the courtesy of English-dubbing it. If you don't understand Japanese, sitting through 2 hours hearing all the screaming in a language unknown, it grates on your last nerve. Why couldn't they English-dub it like Criterion did to Salo? In a nutshell, I think the manufacturers of this blu-ray release are in it purely for the money. The bonus features are pretty decent, including the making of the Godzilla suit, which was interesting but other than that, I'd say don't waste your money. You can get the standard dvd of this at a fraction of the cost with the same quality.

*****UPDATE*****

Criterion has released this on bluray and did a magnificent job, although there are still some blemishes in some scenes.....the Criterion version includes the American Raymond Burr release as well as Gojira.....My guess is this is probably the best version of the original Godzilla you will ever find, considering the age and the poor condition of the film itself",1257292800,7,1301,4.8558558558558556
3904537,4,B002C6VMKC,"There is so much that I like about this film that's its hard to begin. The plot of this film is really good, and has a dark tone to it. The love triangle between Emiko, Ogata, and Serizawa was very well done. The character of Dr. Yamane is probably the best character of the humans anyway. Yamane wants to study Godzilla, and find out why it was able to survive and absorb the radiation, while the others want to kill it. The soundtrack for this film is amazing, and is some of the greatest work of composer Akira Ifukube. The title monster is really iconic(it has 28 films don't you know), and is an allegory to the nuclear bomb. The destruction the creature causes was an allusion to the destruction caused by the atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The whole message that Yamane gave at the end about using nuclear weapons, and the possibility of another Godzilla appearing was really wonderful. The scene where Dr. Serizawa chose to kill himself so the oxygen destroyer won't end up in the wrong hands was GREAT.This film is so great that there hasn't been any Giant Monster movie that comes close to how great this is.....until 1999 when ""Gamera 3: Revenge of Iris"" was released. The best thing about this film is that you really get a sense of the power of Nuclear destruction in Godzilla's rampage.

There is a noticeable difference between the puppet version of Godzilla's head and that of the actual suit, but to it didn't take away from my enjoyment at all.

Certainly at the time many were still wounded over the emotional and physical scars of WWII. It is understandable why they chose an American actor to add scenes for the US release.
