8133987,5,B000GRUMZA,"This interesting, accomplished movie is set in what is today Bangladesh in the late 1960s, just before it gained independence from Pakistan in a bloody war. The film is mostly about how a family living in a village is affected by the political changes coming.

Kazi, the father, is a strict Muslim who does not want his children to be tainted by secular ideas. He sends his son Anu to a Madrassa and is angry when his brother, the bespectacled, open minded Milon brings Anu to watch a Hindu festival. His obedient though doubtful wife, Ayesha, quietly expresses her concerns and feels more and more at odds with Kazi's religious fervor (the movie is quite critical of Islamic fundamentalism, and because of that it was released in Bangladesh only several years after it was filmed) Kazi's is loyal to Pakistan, and is devastated when he learns of the war coming in which the Muslim Pakistani army attacks and massacre Muslim Bengalis. His brother Milon, on the other hand, favors the Bengalis and decide to fight the Pakistani army.

The director has sympathy for all his characters -even the harsh father is given a reason for his actions. This is indicative of a humanist approach to cinema. In that sense, it's easy to relate this movie to the Asian tradition of social realist cinema to people like Satyajit Ray (especially his Apu trilogy), Ritwik Ghattak or the earlier films of Abbas Kiarostami.

Is there a flaw in this movie? At times, their characters express too directly their political views. If it would have been just a little more subtle and less didactic in that regard, it might have been a perfect film. Bengali folk songs are nicely intercalated during the movie, mostly explaining the religious and political situation.",1434240000,,1740,4.851851851851852
8133988,5,B000GRUMZA,I wish there were more movie coming out of Bangladesh like this one! Did I mention that I love this movie! I have a friend who has turned me into everything Bangladeshi because he's Bangladeshi himself and the sweetest person I know. I thought I'd give this movie a try and I'm happy I did. It's a great story based on the life of the director. There are great points made out throughout the movie. Come to find out the most of the actors in the movie were not actors at all which makes it extra special cos it's like the characters are having regular conversations and you just happen to drop in and experience it. The scenery is beautiful! The storyline is very sad but done graciously. I highly recommend!,1404000000,,708,4.412213740458015
8133989,5,B000GRUMZA,"I watched this film with my parents, who lived through the 1971 war between Pakistan and Bangladesh. I was struck by the beauty, imagination, and intense development of the characters. My mother and I both cried at moments, as if we were ourselves in the shoes of the little boy, Anu.  I had no idea what madrasas were like, but even in these types of schools, there is some beauty that children hold onto. The director also depicts the superstition that permeates small villages, where people are accused of madness for erratic behavior.  For me, the clay bird is both faith and a symbol of the arts, a thing that is often squashed when there is violence. When the Nazis persecuted the Jews, they seized their books, their literature, their music, along with property. There was an annihilation of the spirit and the heart of culture, which again flourished after the war. I remember when I first read Ann Frank in school, I considered what totalitarian thought really accomplishes--maybe self-hatred and cultural amnesia.  That's what happens when extremism of any kind is made to dictate every thought and control every behavior--which is what the film reproaches. Strangely, The Clay Bird reminded me of the Pianist, with Adrian Brody.

This was one of the most beautiful films I have seen. I will find a way to watch it with others. I highly recommend this film.",1387929600,,1367,4.829059829059829
8133990,5,B000GRUMZA,"`Clay Bird' (Matir Moyna) depicts the story of a young boy as he struggles to come to terms with his new life as an inmate in a religious school (Madrasah). Anu is never at home in the staid and gloomy atmosphere of the monastic academy, where he has been sent by his deeply religious father, Kazi, against the wishes of Anu's mother and little sister. Anu's transfer to the religious school in the town is apparently disapproved by Milon, Kazi's level-headed younger brother too, for whom the sights and sounds of the village, rather than rigours of religious pedagogy, are crucial for blossoming of a young mind. The difference of opinion between the father and the other family members is a microcosm of the many discordant `isms' that characterised the East Pakistani society during the years leading up to its liberation as a new nation, Bangladesh.

In a society in turmoil, the arguments mostly revolved around what form of Islam to follow, the liberal, tolerant and the indigenous type--propagated by the sufi saints or the strict tenets of Arabic variety, not in harmony with that particular society. Questions emanating from this polemics suffuse the narrative of the movie--in the fraught relationships at Anu's home; between the headmaster and the liberal minded teacher, Ibrahim at the Madrasah; in the many folk songs and in the belligerent politics of Pakistan, ominously looming in the background. Things come to a head with Pakistan's military action, which in turn opens doors for a new identity for the beleaguered people.

The strength of the movie lies in succinctly depicting the malady and the dilemma of a nation in a simple story of children's psychology, unfolding amid Bangladesh's stunning landscape and its earthy folk culture.

Tareque Masud's narrative skills bring to mind the magical touch of Satyajit Ray, who in his `Distant Thunder' (Asani Sanket) portrays the growing edginess of another rural community, so much a part of the pristine nature, in the background of Second World War. Ray's characters think that the war will never affect their lives in the distant village. In `Clay Bird' too, Kazi argues with Anu's mother in a similar vein, ""The military has come, it will fight, but how are we affected?""

8133991,3,B000GRUMZA,"From 1947 till 1971 Pakistan was split into two wings on either side of India, the Western wing being what is currently Pakistan and the Eastern one being what is now Bangladesh.  Both wings were predominantly Muslim but the political power rested in the Western wing despite Bangladesh being the more populous of the two areas. The tension between the two regions culminated in riots and ultimately a civil war that led to the countries being the separate nations they are today.  ""The Clay Bird"" is set in the late sixties in the Eastern wing when this tension was growing and the struggle against military rule was building.  The film presents the political upheaval within the country by showing it in microcosm through the struggles of one family: the patriarch, a kind of born-again-Muslim, standing in for the oppressive forces of the military, the rest of the family, led by the mother's brother representing the growing impulse to break free.  The plot is constructed around the family's young son as he is sent to a madrasah (in this case a strict Muslim school) where, unable to connect with most of the other boys, he befriends the outcast of the class - a young boy who escapes the tormenting of his classmates by living in an imaginary world.

The film exoticizes the world it portrays by showing many of the folk traditions of the culture from a tourist's point of view, probably to maximize its appeal to a western audience.  It is also fairly heavy-handed in presenting its message through dialogue rather than action and occasionally lapses into melodrama.  The characters often come across more as types than real human beings.  Yet, despite these flaws, it somehow pulls you into its world through the sheer beauty of its imagery. It's a tourist's point of view but the view is of a tourist with a good eye.  The film can also be lauded for attempting to present a more balanced and complex view of Islam than the simplistic one typically promoted in the west.

Not a great film but worth checking out if you're interested in learning more about this region of the world.",1173916800,12,2091,4.751381215469613
8133992,5,B000GRUMZA,"This is a very powerful, moving, and visually beautiful film.  I agree with Elvis Mitchell of ""New York Times"" when he writes, ""One of the finest films of this year or any other.""  I wish there were more movies of this quality.",1169078400,3,227,4.380952380952381
8133993,5,B000GRUMZA,"Bangladesh is a country of idyllic beauty, sublime culture, and unceasing, often violent struggle.  Matir Moyna is a beautiful ode to director Tareque Masud's home and the the identity crisis that continues to throw the nation into tumult.

Matir Moyna, however, is not simply a film about Bangladesh.  Intentionally or not, Masud's film speaks to struggles not unique to the subcontinent.  While the impact of communalism, of language, of borders may be particularly stark in Sonar Bangladesh, these struggles are found around the world.

There is something particularly amazing about watching a film that takes place in a time and place about which most of us know nothing, yet seeing in the struggles not only Bengalis and Pakistanis, not only Hindus and Muslims - but all people, from the dispossessed in urban ghettoes, to the families fighting to survive in the rural countryside; men and women not in control of their government, their society, their nation, but determined to fight, to survive.

Matir Moyna is a beautiful film, and can be enjoyed as such.  But it also speaks to us at a deeper level, one in which we recognize not only our faults, our mistakes, but our hopes and dreams for a better life.",1168300800,14,1214,4.921568627450981
