Every one of the others was bad in the same way and at the exact same place on the tape.  Once they got to that spot, the tapes would not fast forward, play or rewind.  I am more than glad that I kept searching for a playable copy because some of Janet's best music is on it, made during her time with the Jimmy Swaggart Ministries before he screwed things up so badly with his sexual escapades.  If you can find a playable copy, you'll really enjoy hearing Janet at this point in her career.  She went on to become a regular on the Gaither Homecoming Videos.",1507593600,,654,4.158730158730159

i bowed on my knees and cried holy
he will deliver me
make my heart your home
jesus is alive and well
he died of a broken heart
i never shall forget the day
jesus, lord to me
move me with compassion
god rides on the wings of love
i call him lord",1227744000,,266,3.6842105263157894
