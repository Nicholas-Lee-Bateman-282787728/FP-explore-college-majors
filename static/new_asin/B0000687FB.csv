 The story goes as such:  a really, really sleazy theatre chain operator, he bootlegs copies of the movies that he shows, and who shows movies like ""Amputee Prostitutes"", has come up with a brilliant new idea.  Open up a long abandoned theatre as a singleplex, and steal from that one too.  The trouble is that the theatre has a shady past, people died there, although we never learn the particulars.

 So he sends his three most capable employees, which ain't saying much, over to his new property to clean it up and to get it ready for its grand opening.  This movie then splits into two as the movie details the plot (?) from two important viewpoints; the home office and the new property.  And then both murders and supernatural events happen.

 The movie proceeds down its road of predictability, as it is populated with a cast of characters that are all scheming and who are dumber than dirt.  Maybe I was just in a forgiving mood, or maybe I got its tongue-in-cheek snarkiness as the whole movie came across as a Saturday Night Live, or National Lampoon parody of a horror slasher.

 This is a movie chock filled with murder, bad music, bad acting, bad special effects, bad dubbing, a cheesy soundtrack, college girls in cheerleader outfits, a homicidal ghost, slapstick, a cast whose careers were ended by this movie, a decent body count, a mugging, a dead rat, an out-of-control fog machine, Jamie Foxx in too tight golden spandex pants, a topless Jamie Foxx in a catfight, a death by popcorn machine, a plot that makes absolutely no damn sense, and Mary Woranov who looks like she's having a blast stealing every single scene shes in.  And don't miss how she quits her job.  Go Mary!!!

 I mean, whats not to like here?  I found myself laughing continuously, in a movie richly deserving of cult status.  Why hasn't this movie been released on Blue Ray already?  Bad movie mavens everywhere should see this movie if they can.  Be prepared though, Mary Woranov does NOT brandish any knives in this movie.",1515283200,,2132,4.5552631578947365
7963769,4,B0000687FB,"I have to admit I'm a sucker when it comes to bad b-movie horror , and this happens to be one that I actually enjoy and have watched twice so far. I first came across this on amazon when going in to a search for horror movies and found it listed as "" MOVIE HOUSE MASSACRE"" on VHS  and than "" THEATER OF BLOOD "" on DVD and is kind of odd that the movie lists two different directors and really no facts on when it was made or any of the characters , but the plot is fairly simple when a movie theatre owner becomes upset that movie sales are down and kills the usher than burns down the theatre with everyone trapped in. Many years later a whole chain of theatres open with young people hired as employees , and the acting throughout is amateurish but somewhat humorous which is what I enjoyed most about the movie , and would have to recommend this only for b- movie horror enthusiast like myself.",1176595200,3,897,4.155172413793103
7963770,4,B0000687FB,"According to the DVD this 1984 film was directed by Rick Sloane (Vice Academy series, Hobgoblins). The acting is mostly horrible, the plot is quite lame, the killings are laughable, and the ending is pretty pathetic. Yet...it still has a certain charm to it. It's more of a comedy spoof (i.e. ""Student Bodies"") than a straight horror film, so don't expect much blood or guts. Not everyone will like it, and many might even say this is a truly terrible film. I wouldn't disagree with that statement.
I like the 70's sounding electronica music throughout the film, it's mostly repetitive, but very effective. It's similar to the music score in the first ""Slumber Party Massacre"" movie. If the killings would have been more effective and unique, and if the ending would have made more sense I think this movie would have been viewed as much better. Also,  the film should have been about 10 minutes longer in length. There are no DVD special features except for Scene Selections and a short Still Gallery. The picture and sound are both fairly clear (with some minor dust and age scratches throughout the film).",1029974400,2,1108,4.801047120418848
