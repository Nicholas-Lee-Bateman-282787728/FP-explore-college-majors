7167052,5,B00XBL0JTW,GREAT documentary on the great barrier reef. 180 minutes.,1439424000,2,57,5.444444444444445
7167053,5,B00XBL0JTW,"I have done shark feeding in Hawaii but the ones that you will get to witness in Barrier Reef is a world apart. The same goes for Raine Island, a protected island from the public, the largest nesting site in the world for turtles where you will witness thousands of turtles nesting and some becoming pray after dropping their eggs. Only 5% of the eggs are currently producing hatchlings and out of those only 1 in 1,000 will survive to adulthood. Three hours of spectacular ocean living in the heart of the vast, beautiful 2,900 individual coral reefs, with 900 islands that stretch some 1,400 miles on the North East corner of Australia that can be seen from outer space as the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms called The Great Barrier Reef. Home to a stunning array of animals, from microscopic plankton to 100-ton whales. Over the last decade, destructive storms have accounted about 48% of decline in the coral cover. With the global warming and the increase in the intensity of storm, cyclones dump some 20 inches of rain in 24 hours which changes the environment noticeably. Four and half thousand ship transit in those water every year, transiting coal from Australia and with the booming business, ship numbers are set to double next 20 years.

It real is not important even if you get the chance to visit the true majestic Barrier Reef in person since what you will witness in this documentary is so out of this world that it takes years to capture what mother nature does in different times of the year, in different islands of the Barrier Reef where many are not open to the public. Australia insured to keep and protect their Mangrove forest that provides an important Eco-system to Barrier Reef and the whole environment while unfortunately in the US, they destroyed the Mangrove forest of Louisiana which could have been protected the wet lands and the Eco-system of the south. Australia's dedication in this part of the world is truly a human achievement. A must see documentary with such a beautiful colors, cinematography and superb narration, that I had to rewind and replay time after time especially for an ocean lover. Watch it before you get to visit this colorful spectrum of life in blue waters of the Southern Pacific Ocean. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1437609600,10,2295,4.795454545454546

Since I ordered the DVD from Germany and play it here, I assume that the DVD is provided with a country code. Since I was working in Vietnam, I took the DVD with me to play it there, the same result - not playable.",1506211200,,305,3.857142857142857
