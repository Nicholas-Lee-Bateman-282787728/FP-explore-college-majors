Charlie Chaplin entered the film industry in 1914. By 1916 he was the highest-paid entertainer in the world after signing a contract with the Mutual Film Corporation for a salary of $670,000. Mutual Film Corporation built Charlie Chaplin his very own studio and allowed him total freedom to make 12 two-reel films during a 12-month period, which brought together for the first time in this newly remastered limited-edition Blu-ray two-disc box set release. With music by the acclaimed silent-film composer Carl Davis, demonstrate the breadth of Charlie Chaplins abilities as both a physical entertainer and a subtle, endearing character actor and subsequently recognised over this period of film-making as the most inventive and liberating of Charlie Chaplins career.

These twelve films demonstrate the breadth of Charlie Chaplin's abilities as both a physical slapstick actor and a subtle, endearing character actor. The collection includes the slapstick custard pie fights of Behind the Screen and his first minor masterpiece, The Vagabond, where he successfully combines pathos and comedy to create a lyrical love story. But also among the classics is included here The Immigrant, which endures as a comic masterpiece, and Easy Street, a watershed moment in the career of Charlie Chaplin.

This limited edition Blu-ray collection of Charlie Chaplin films has been fully restored and features music by acclaimed silent film composer Carl Davis, and alternative film score arranged by Neil Brand, Antonio Coppola and Stephen Horne.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: A true rarity this, and an absolute treasure to behold! The great little man entered the film industry in 1914, and just two years later Charlie Chaplin was the highest paid actor in the world thanks to a contract with the Mutual Film Corporation which allowed him complete artistic freedom. The resulted in 12 two-reel films made between 1916-1917, and for the first time they are available as a Limited Edition 2 Disc Blu-ray Edition set, and fully restored at that!

The films that he made during that year display Charlie Chaplins genius for combining comedy with pathos. Furthermore they allow us to marvel at his unparalleled physical artistry and his perfect timing for slapstick routines. Charlie Chaplins then leading lady, Edna Purviance, and buddy Eric Campbell also play big parts in almost all of the featured comedy shorts. It is hard to believe that these films are almost 100 years old and the quality and Charlie Chaplins comedic genius are truly timeless!

Blu-ray Disc One contains the following films: The Floorwalker; The Fireman; The Vagabond; One A.M.; The Count and The Pawnshop.

THE FLOORWALKER [1916] This film takes place in a New York department store, our hapless hero changes identities with a lookalike floorwalker and utter chaos, ensues? Unfortunately for Charlie, the lookalike is involved in dirty tricks and theft of store money, so it is innocent Charlie Chaplin who soon falls under the watching eye of store detectives. The Floorwalker is particularly memorable for Charlie Chaplins use of ballet-like slapstick antics and the fight with his double in which he performs splits and pirouettes is simply priceless! The Floorwalker, although the film contains a stronger plot than most of his previous films, and the moving-staircase chase was novel for 1916. Audiences were amazed and delighted by Charlie Chaplins brilliant antics. Running Time: 29:20. Play with composed music by Carl Davis. Play with composed music by Gabriel Thibaudeau. Play with composed improvisational piano by Antonio Coppola. Play with audio commentary by Frank Scheide.

THE FIREMAN [1916] Charlie Chaplin is a fireman who always does everything wrong. A man [Lloyd Bacon] talks the Fire Chief [Eric Campbell] into ignoring his burning home and he wants the insurance money, but is unaware that his daughter, the love of the Fire Chief, is upstairs in the house. When the house next door catches fire its owner rouses Charlie Chaplin who rouses the force. Meanwhile the father set up a fire in the basement of his own house before realising that his daughter is still inside in the upper floor. The fireman [Charlie Chaplin] who is in love with the daughter [Edna Purviance] abandons the first house in fire to rush and heroically climbs the outside of the building to save her. Running Time: 26:26. Play with composed music by Carl Davis. Play Original Fotoplayer Music and Sound Effects Played and Adapted by Robert Israel. Play with composed music by Neil Brand. Play with audio commentary by Glenn Mitchell.

THE VAGABOND [1916] Here we see Charlie Chaplin in the title role playing a violinist who, by default, rescues a poor girl [Edna Purviance] from abusing gypsies by literally knocking them out one by one with a heavy wooden stick and in true Charlie Chaplin style! After the pair escape in a caravan romance lurks in the air, but a chance encounter with an artist who is fascinated by the girls shamrock-birthmark soon puts an end to his dreams. Thanks to the artists finished painting exhibited in a gallery, the girls estranged mother recognises her long lost daughter and with artist and family members in tow aids to her rescue. But along the drive in the car the girl realises her true love is for the little vagabond and the car returns to pick him up, too. The Vagabond clearly shows Charlie Chaplins development of the film elements that Charlie Chaplin would use throughout his career, particularly the blending of comedy and drama. Running Time: 26:48. Play with composed music by Carl Davis. Play with composed Musical Score compiled and performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. Play with composed improvisational piano by Antonio Coppola. Play with audio commentary by Glenn Mitchell.

ONE A.M [1916] This is one of the most hilarious shorts on this particular Blu-ray Disc. It differs from the other films not only because it does not have a plot as such but is a mere solo effort by Charlie Chaplin. No, it is one of those rare gems in which he sports an elegant top hat instead of his trademark bowler. The story is simple enough: Charlie Chaplin here plays an elegant and wealthy gentleman who returns home after a night out on the town. However, it is his drunken state which confronts him with all sorts of obstacles, from trying to get into the house to trying to make it up to the bedroom. Sliding across carpets and getting stuck on tables, the highlight are his manifold unsuccessful efforts to make it up the stairs and into his bedchamber. When, after numerous hair-raising manoeuvres, he finally succeeds in making it to the top of the stairs he is knocked down again by the swinging pendulum of a grandfather clock. I personally found this not one of his best and I wanted it to finish much earlier. Running Time: 27:26. Play with composed music by Carl Davis. Play with composed improvisational piano by Gabriel Thibaudeau. Play with audio commentary by Dan Kamin.

THE COUNT [1916] The tailor's handyman [Charlie Chaplin] burns Count Broko [Leo White] trousers while ironing them and is then fired. His superior [Eric Campbell] discovers a note explaining the count can't attend a  party, and dresses up like one to take his place. The tailor finds an invitation to dinner at Miss Moneybags [Edna Purviance] and goes in place of the count. Charlie Chaplin goes to the kitchen of the same house; he is attracted to the cook, and so are the butler and a policeman. Once discovered by the tailor-count, Charlie Chaplin must pretend to be the count's secretary. Then the real Count Broko shows up. Soon, Charlie Chaplin is distracted by a gypsy girl and the tailor must fend off other suitors. The real Count finally arrives, learns of the imposters and calls the police. Charlie Chaplin makes a mad dash through the party and scampers away to safety. Running Time: 25:14. Play with composed music by Carl Davis. Play with composed music by Donald Sosin, Peter Breiner, and Richard A. Whiting. Play with composed improvisational piano by Neil Brand. Play with audio commentary by Frank Scheide.

THE PAWNSHOP [1916] The Pawnshop was Charlie Chaplin's sixth film for Mutual Film Corporation. Released on 2nd October, 1916, it stars Charlie Chaplin in the role of assistant to the Pawnbroker owner, played by Henry Bergman. Charlie Chaplin competes with his fellow shop assistant, played by John Rand. Charlie Chaplin is fired by the Pawnbroker owner and then rehired. Charlie Chaplin nearly destroys everything in the shop and himself. Charlie Chaplin destroys a client's clock while examining it in detail. Charlie Chaplin helps capture a burglar. The imagination is accurate. The acting is restrained and naturalistic. The result is a scream and do not believe that such acting is a matter of crude and simple means. It is as subtle in its naturalness as the shades of intonation in a really tragic speech. Running Time: 26:40. Play with composed music by Carl Davis. Play with Original Score Van Beuren Music Score by Winston Sharp and Gene Rodemich. Play with composed improvisational piano by Donald Sosin. Play with audio commentary by Dan Kamin

Blu-ray Disc Two contains the following films: Behind the Screen; The Rink; Easy Street; The Cure; The Immigrant and The Adventurer.

BEHIND THE SCREEN [1916] The film takes place in a movie studio. A stagehand named David [Charlie Chaplin] has a supervisor, Goliath [Eric Campbell]. Much of the film is slapstick comedy involving Charlie Chaplin manhandling large props, but the other plotlines include the stagehands strike against the tyrannical boss, and The Girl [Edna Purviance], who is unable to become an actress, starts dressing as a man and becoming a stagehand. Charlie Chaplin, discovering that the new stagehand is in fact a girl, and gently kisses her just as Goliath returns and Goliath remarks in a very offhand way, but then turns around and dances off in an effeminate manner before offering his backside to Charlie, which Charlie promptly kicks. This curious scene representing a homosexual situation is highly unusual in American commercial cinema for its time. But all in all this a very funny hilarious knock about comedy film. Running Time: 25:22. Play with composed music by Carl Davis. Play with composed music by Robert Israel. Play with composed improvisational piano by Antonio Coppola. Play with audio commentary by Hooman Mehran.

THE RINK [1916] Here we find Charlie Chaplin working as a waiter in a restaurant. After causing restaurant chaos at work, Charlie Chaplin a bumbling waiter tears up the local roller rink with his skating and so Charlie Chaplin uses his lunch break to go roller skating and Charlie Chaplin catches the eye of a socialite Edna Purviance. Charlie Chaplin did all of the skating himself, and he was occasionally aided by wires for shots which required Charlie Chaplin to appear as if he were about to fall backward or forward while on skates, causing pandemonium in the rink. Charlie Chaplins agility and grace make The Rink one of his most memorable early comedies. Charlie Chaplin is an inept waiter who prepares the bill of Mr. Stout [Eric Campbell] by examining the soup, spaghetti, melon stains and other remnants on the sloppy eaters shirt front, tie, and ear. Running Time: 25:54. Play with composed music by Carl Davis. Play with composed music by Antonio Coppola. Play with composed improvisational piano by Maud Nelissen. Play with audio commentary by Hooman Mehran.

EASY STREET [1917] One of the most famous of Charlie Chaplins films from that period is  in which tramp Charlie Chaplin vows to mend his ways and become a better person, if only to impress the pretty mission hall assistant. Responding to an ad calling for new police officers, Charlie Chaplin gets the job but his first assignment is a tough one and he is to patrol and restore order in Easy Street, one of the most impoverished and most dangerous local thoroughfares shunned by most of the police force. But Charlie Chaplin is not one for being intimidated easily and manages to knock out the leader of a local gang by pushing his head into a gas lamp, thus anaesthetizing him. Hell-bent on revenge, the thug kidnaps the pretty mission hall assistant but once again, Charlie Chaplin kicks and jumps his way to the rescue. Does he get the girl? You bet! Running Time: 27:06. Play with composed music by Carl Davis. Play with composed music by Neil Brand. Play with composed improvisational piano by Donal Sosin. Play with audio commentary by Bryony Dixon.

THE CURE [1917] This is the tenth film in the series, and is perhaps the funniest of the Mutual Film Company films. Charlie Chaplin is depicted as an alcoholic who checks into a health spa and his antics promptly throw the establishment into chaos. There is a delightful scene in the changing room where Charlie Chaplin assumes several poses in his swimsuit as the curtains open and close before he dances along to the pool. The scene was inspired by the tableaux, a popular feature of many British music-hall programmes. The little tramp, an alcoholic, arrives in a quiet resort with suitcases filled with alcohol. The next morning there are plenty of hangovers, but Chalie Chaplin turns sober, walks out and finds the lady. Realising what had happened, she forgives him. They walk ahead, just then he accidentally steps into the liquor-laden well. One introduction which has since been added to the film explains that in 1917 drunkenness was a serious problem in the working class, so to keep it funny Charlie Chaplin changed from his ""Little Tramp"" character to an upper-class fop. Running Time: 26:26. Play with composed music by Carl Davis. Play with composed musical score by Stephen Horne. Play with composed improvisational piano by Maud Nelissen. Play with audio commentary by Glenn Mitchell.

THE IMMIGRANT [1917] This is another classic Mutual Film Corporation film in which Charlie Chaplin is on a ship bound for the land of liberty, the United States. Aboard Charlie Chaplin briefly makes the acquaintance of a sickly widow, played by Kitty Bradbury and her pretty daughter, played by Edna Purviance and helps them out when it transpires that the mother had money stolen from her. After the ship enters Ellis Island, mother and daughter once again thank Charlie Chaplin for his kindness and then part ways. Weeks later, a downtrodden Charlie Chaplin wanders the streets of New York and, finding a dollar on the pavement, enters a restaurant without realizing the coin had slipped out of his pocket. During his meal Charlie Chaplin spots the very girl from the ship sitting at another table, and all her own. Upon hearing that her mother has died and the girl is just as impoverished, he invites her over and orders her a meal. It is only when the bullying waiter asks for payment that Charlie Chaplin realises he lost his dollar and in panic orders more food and more coffee! Charlie Chaplin then spots another dollar coin on the floor which the waiter dropped and his efforts to pick up the coin without the waiter realising is a real scream. Charlie Chaplin succeeds just as good luck arrives in the shape of an artist, who pays Charlie Chaplin and the girl upfront for modelling for him. With a proud gesture Charlie Chaplin pays the bill from the money the waiter dropped and uses the money the artist pays him to wed the girl in the marriage office. Running Time: 25:08. Play with composed music by Carl Davis. Play with composed music and conducted by Timothy Brock. Play with composed improvisational piano by Donald Sosin. Play with audio commentary by Michael Hayde.

THE ADVENTURER [1917] Charlie Chaplin The Little Tramp escapes from prison; saves a girl, played by Edna Purviance and her  mother, played by Marta Golden from drowning; but her suitor, played by Eric Campbell does everything he can to have Charlie  Chaplin apprehended by the officials. But creates havoc at a swank party he eventually is able to attend through circumstances. The Adventurer, was released as the longest interval between films for Charlie Chaplin in his entire career up to that time. This is the most popular of the Mutual Film Company films. The Adventurer begins and ends with a chase. Other highlights from the film include Charlie Chaplin donning a lampshade and freezing in position as the guards run past him and a chase in which he dodges a prison guard and the rival by using sliding double doors which become, in turn, a head-stock, a moveable wall, and an escape route. It is totally ironic that this is Charlie Chaplins last film of the demanding Mutual Film Corporation film series. Running Time: 26:54. Play with composed music by Carl Davis. Play with composed music by Robert Israel. Play with composed improvisational piano by Neil Brand. Play with audio commentary by Carl Davis.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The British Film Industry Blu-ray release of these Mutual Film Corporation Charlie Chaplin films, have been presented in their original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.33:1 and is beautifully reproduced in a stunning 1080p Black-and-White image, which each film has been scanned at 2K resolution using the best surviving 35mm elements by Fondazione Cineteca di Bologna and in two instances, Technicolor Burbank. Image restoration was undertaken in 2013 by LImmagine Ritrovata and Lobster Films. The surviving 35mm elements are derived from two different negatives. Elements sourced from Negative A (domestic version) were used wherever possible, while elements sourced from negative B (export version) were used to reconstruct missing or severely damaged shots. The resulting shorts look as good as its possible for films that are a hundred years old to look. Of course within each short is a variance of picture quality from sharp and clean to faded, scratched, and duped. At their best, the greyscales of the films produce very good whites and rich black levels, but due to the ravages of time and the unavailability of always quality elements, blacks can just as easily be milky and contrast light and unappealing. We are all most fortunate there are as close to complete versions of these films as these transfers are. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications. Definitely gets a five star rating.

Again this British Film Institute luxurious Limited Edition 2 Disc Blu-ray Edition is far superior to the rubbish Flicker Alley Blu-ray release, as with the American Blu-ray you only get two alternative film music score presentations. This definitely gets a five star rating.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

All Charlie Chaplin films have been fully restored in 1080p High definition. The restoration was made possible, thanks to the generous support of The Film Foundation, the George Lucas Family Foundation and The Material World Charitable Foundation. All intertitles have been reconstructed according to the original Mutual Film Corporation title cards, which the original title cards are held by the Library of Congress.

All 12 films [1916-1917] have been given a film score music has been arranged by acclaimed silent film composer Carl Davis, and all presented in full 1080p High Definition, which includes: The Floorwalker; The Fireman; The Vagabond; One AM; The Count; The Pawnshop; Behind the Screen; The Rink; Easy Street; The Cure; The Immigrant and The Adventurer. I found these Carl Davis film compositions for all 12 films a truly wonderful delightful experience, and Carl Davis gave great depth and warmth to each score for each film in a special way and I felt as though the Carl Davis music scores felt like it was played when the films were originally seen in the cinema, that is how brilliant the Carl Davis music scores are and with some random sound effects, it gives the films a totally new perspective and a great joy to view and made each Charlie Chaplin Mutual comedy films a new lease of life. To really understand Carl Davis and his technique in producing these music score, you should view his special feature: An interview with Carl Davis [2003] where Carl Davis goes into great detail on why he was so passionate in doing the musical compositions and the technique he used to enhance these Charlie Chaplin films.

All 12 films [1916-1917] have been given an alternative film score for each film that have been arranged by composers, Gabriel Thibaudeau, Antonio Coppola, Robert Israel, Neil Brand, Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra, Gabriel Thibaudeau, Donald Sosin, Peter Breiner, Richard A. Whiting, Winston Sharp, Gene Rodemich, Robert Israel, Maud Nelissen, Stephen Horne and Timothy Brock. I have viewed all these alternative music compositions for all 12 Mutual Film Corporation films and found some of them quite nice, but not so keen on the piano accompany to the Charlie Chaplin films, I felt they lacked any depth, but as I have already stated the Carl Davis film scores are to me the best and preferred alternative film score for each Charlie Chaplin film.

Audio Commentaries for all 12 films [1916-1917] by Frank Scheide, Glenn Mitchell, Dan Kamin, Hooman Mehran, Bryony Dixon, Michael J. Hayde and Carl Davis. These audio commentaries were really enjoyable to listen to and really enhanced the enjoyment of watching the Charlie Chaplin films and you also get lots of info about the techniques Charlie Chaplin used to make the films the classic hits they became to audiences around the world. The only thing some of the audio commentaries that didn't help is how some of them tended to ramble on about outtakes, that can be viewed in the UNKNOWN CHAPLIN DVD, and if you have never seen this Title, then you might find their comments very confusing. But out of all these audio commentaries I found the Bryony Dixon audio commentary absolutely totally boring and was totally unsuitable to do an audio commentary, whereas everyone elses audio commentaries were totally fascinating.

Special Feature: Documentary Newsreel Short: Chaplin signs the Mutual Record Film Contract [1916] [480i] [1.33:1] [00:33] The following clip we get to view shows John R. Freuler, who is the President of the Mutual Film Corporation, with Sidney Chaplin and Charlie Chaplin signing his record-breaking $10,000 a week contract, making him the highest paid filmmaker in America at that time, which happened One hundred years ago on this day on the 26th February, 1916. This bonus Documentary Newsreel Short relates to Charlie Chaplins departure from Essanay Studios at the end of 1915 and celebrates his arrival at Mutual Film Company, of which Charlie Chaplin said: Fulfilling my contract with the Mutual Film Company l was, I suppose, the happiest period of my life. This Documentary Newsreel Short has been scanned at 2K resolution from 35mm preservation elements held at the BFI Nation Archive and has been adjusted to run at the correct frame rates. Despite the work done on this short film, unfortunately the quality of this rare film is of a totally atrocious quality.

Here we see Charlie Chaplin says Au revoir and receives a send-off from Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks. We see Charlie Chaplin waves goodbye to New York; which only a few years ago Charlie Chaplin landed as a poor and unknown lad. Here you also see Charlie Chaplin is then warmly greeted by his fellow passengers and the crew of the liner and carry him on their shoulders around the deck. Charlie Chaplin helps them organise a circus and a ""Charlie Walk"" contest. Original music score composed and performed by Matthew John Marshall. This Topical Budget Newsreel Short has been scanned at 2K resolution from 35mm preservation elements held at the BFI Nation Archive and has been adjusted to run at the correct frame rates.

Special Feature: An interview with Carl Davis [2003] [1080p] [1.78:1] [9:19] Carl Davis the composer discusses all about Charlie Chaplin. From conducting to composing music for films, television, or silent films from the 20s, ballets, musicals as well as an Oratorio, Carl Davis versatility is very impressive. For Carl Davis the combination of silent film and orchestra is a magical mixture. Carl Davis found the concept of composing a score to fit the Silent Films that Carl Davis feels like pure exhilaration. But we hear Carl Davis [Composer] talking about how he was going to approach the project of composing all the music score for the CHARLIE CHAPLIN: THE MUTUAL FILMS COLLECTION film. Carl Davis was pleased to be involved with the British Film Institute and also developing his enthusiasm towards putting music towards the 12 classic Mutual Film Corporation films. Carl Davis in his early career in 1980 had collaboration with David Gill [Screenwriter] and Keven Brownlow [Director] with the HOLLYWOOD documentary series produced by Thames Television, about the history of the Silent Film era. Then in 1983 Carl Davis was involved in scoring the music for the Thames Television series UNKNOWN CHAPLIN, which was the British documentary series about the career and methods of the silent film luminary Charles Chaplin. But Carl Davis tells us that he was keen to do the music score for the Mutual Film Corporation and was set in motion when he contacted David Shepard of Film Preservation Associates, who is a true collector of Charlie Chaplin films. Carl Davis had a particular interest in doing the music score for the THE IMMIGRANT [1917], as Carl Davis is third generation of immigrants, but most of all Carl Davis goes into great detail about he went about doing the orchestration on the 12 Mutual Film Corporation films. Carl Davis talks about how Charlie Chaplin felt when people saw his silent films with a piano accompany, he felt it represented poverty, that is why in his later films he had composed special big orchestrations when his films were shown in the cinema, and that is why Carl Davis decided to give the same music orchestration genre for the 12 Mutual Film Corporation films, but with a much smaller orchestra where Carl Davis had only 16 musicians. With the particular film EASY STREET [1917], Carl Davis felt that he had to give it a special musical composition in homage to Gilbert & Sullivan by using the music from A Policeman's Lot is not a Happy One and it works really well. But overall with this special interview, Carl Davis felt he achieved something special and a pinnacle in his musical film scoring orchestration for all of the 12 Mutual Film Corporation films and was also a joy in and a great honour towards the genius of Charlie Chaplin. In May 2003, Carl Davis received a special award for his contribution to film, television and theatre by The British Academy Film and Television Arts. The first award from BAFTA designated to a composer. Carl Davis now lives in London. He is married to actress Jean Boht and they have two daughters, Hannah and Jessie.

BONUS: A fully beautiful illustrated designed 38 page extensive booklet entitled THE MUTUAL COMEDIES: CHARLIE CHAPLIN.

PLUS: Here we have a beautiful designed printed reversible Blu-ray cover. As usual with the professional British Film Institute, they produce something really special and it is far superior to what has been produced in America by Flicker Alleys Blu-ray release, that is a load of crap and a total embarrassment design and so glad it is not in my Blu-ray Collection.

Finally, this is a totally brilliant and fantastic release from the British Film Institute, so I recommend you clear your schedules and dust off your credit card.  Charlie Chaplin films and the BFI have done a brilliant professional job in getting these restored classic films into the hands of the fans and also having added some interesting features into the mix. Highly Recommended!
