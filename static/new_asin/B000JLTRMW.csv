2676766,5,B000JLTRMW,"The Backyardigans are a very, very funny and intelligent show about four young people(creatures) who have adventures in their back yard. They incorporate history, culture and diverse music to provide painfully funny stories that adults as well as children can enjoy.

For instance, in the Volcano Sisters episode, the girls who are Hawaiian volcano goddesses, sing that they want something, but they are not going to tell the boys what it is. They have to guess. Aside from being a great song that moves the plot along it sets up a male/female difference piece that the adults will laugh their heads off at.

All the stories are funny, but ""Horsing Around"", done to really catchy cowboy/klezmer music, is special. A variation on ""The Tortoise and the Hare"" two hyper-competitive characters take on each other in a horse race, only to be beaten by a slow but steady burro. After the loss, one says, ""I was really surprised"". The other looks at him and says, ""No. I was more surprised than you""...and the conflict begins again.

Believe me, both you and your children will love this DVD and the entire series. My seven year old watches them over and over again. Our four year old neighbor loves them too.",1173657600,3,1202,4.769230769230769

2676772,5,B000JLTRMW,"The Backyardigans are back with more exciting adventures from Season Two of their television series, and as usual there are four wildly imaginative episodes, each with four catchy songs set to the beat of a special music genre.

This DVD contains the following episodes:

The Legend of the Volcano Sisters - The Volcano Sisters (Uniqua and Tasha) demand a gift from the Luau Brothers (Tyrone, Pablo and Austin), failing which they will literally blow their top, thereby ruining the Brothers' party.  The Brothers use their strength, speed and wisdom to make sure the Sisters get exactly what they want.
(Music genre: Tarantella)

The Swamp Creature - Uniqua and Pablo are tour guides in an icky, smelly swamp, and convince tourists Austin and Tasha to take the tour, under the pretext of showing them the swamp monster. Unbeknownst to the sneaky entrepreneurs, there really is a swamp monster, who eventually manages to track them down.
(Music genre: Sixties guitar)

Horsing Around - A big race is on between a cowgirl (Uniqua) and a jockey (Pablo) to find the fastest horse rider in the west.  Austin announces the race, which also includes a most unlikely racer (Tyrone) on a most unlikely steed named Molasses.
(Music genre: Klezmer)

Special Delivery - A tough group of bikers (Tasha, Uniqua and Pablo) known as the Do-Gooders, come into contact with a nervous mailman (Tyrone) who thinks that they're after the mail. The stakes are high, as there are Valentine's Day cards that need delivering.
(Music genre: Norteno)

The best episode is ""The Legend of the Volcano Sisters"", and there are also some fun special features, including a dance-along number.

Fans should note that the next DVD ""Movers and Shakers"" is due out in May 2007.

2676773,5,B000JLTRMW,"""The Backyardigans"" at at it again with another DVD filled with wonderful episodes, including a special DVD-premiere episode.

We've reached the second season of the show and it's just as entertaining and fun as ever, if not more so. Plus, it has something to teach you, if that strikes your fancy. The ""flagship"" episode for this DVD is ""The Legend of the Volcano Sisters."" The Volcano Sisters are Uniqua and Tasha. They live inside a Hawaiian volcano and they are mad! They want something, but won't tell what it is. They've summoned the Luau Brothers (Pablo, Tyrone and Austin) to get it and if those three can't find it in time --- huka pele! The Volcano Sisters declare that they'll cause the volcano to erupt, spoiling the luau that the Luau Brothers had planned. But just what could they get that would be awesome enough to satisfy these two? Austin thinks he knows, but Tyrone and Pablo have other, grander ideas.[

""Horsing Around"" is exclusive to this DVD, at least for the time being. Uniqua and Pablo are racing horses, trying to outdo each other and prove who's the better rider. They decide to have a race to the Mississippi River, which Austin will announce. To their surprise, Tyrone joins the race, riding a tired, old donkey named Burro.

Also on this DVD are ""The Swamp Creature"" and ""Special Delivery."" ""Special Delivery"" aired on Valentine's Day on Nick Jr., around the same time as the release of this DVD. This one is a lot of fun --- it features ""The Do-Gooders,"" a rough, tough, good motorcycle gang. And in ""The Swamp Creature,"" Uniqua and Pablo are tour guides who try to trick Tasha and Austin into believing that there's a swamp creature, not realizing there really is one.

This DVD comes with two special features. Uniqua does a dance-along to an instrumental version of the song ""Secret Agent,"" from a first-season episode. Also included is a two-minute sneak-peek at the ""Wonder Pets!"" (wonderful show) episode ""Save the Blowfish!""",1172275200,4,1964,4.8017751479289945

We first watched it through our netflix subscription, but eventually I sent it back so that we could get new movies; however, my oldest asked to watch it constantly and told me to have the mailman bring it back.  Both my four-year-old son and two-year-old daughter regularly sing songs from this dvd (the volcano sisters episode is their favorite).  It's wholesome entertainment with singing and dancing.  Nobody calls anybody ugly names and there is always something learned by the characters in each story.  I recommend this for little ones and it's not too bad for the parents who have to watch and listen to the movies that their kids watch all the time.",1343520000,,699,4.69672131147541

2676854,5,B000JLTRMW,"In my opinion, Horsing Around is one of the best Backyardigans episodes ever, and not just because I continually whistle the catchy klezmer tunes.  The episode is a reprise of the tortoise and the hare, and features continuous bragging and boasting between Uniqua and Pablo who share the role of the hare.  The concept of bragging can be a tricky one for a 3 year old but this show illustrates it well.

And the music is great.  I put this episode in a three way tie for best tunes with the Yeti and Super Secret Super Spy.",1205193600,2,523,4.360824742268041

The characters speak clearly, using proper english.  I think that sets a good example.  The singing and dancing are high quality.  The songs themselves can be a little inane, but it is a childrens show after all.",1197849600,,361,4.393939393939394

2676861,1,B000JLTRMW,"We have all the the backyardigans DVDs and I cannot praise the other ones enough - five star rating on all of them.  However the messages picked up from this one has caused us to remove this video from our children's collection.  Throwing tantrums and insisting on your own way are habits we are trying to break our children from not encourage.  If you want a excellent DVD for your children try any of the other Backyardigans, my kids love them and the over all messages the kids pick up from them are much better.",1177200000,13,515,4.4
2676862,5,B000JLTRMW,"My mother once told me that whatever name I give my child should better be one I love because I'd be saying it often!  Well, the same good motherly advice goes for the TV shows your children watch.  I watch the Backyardigans numerous times a day, on DVD, on TIVO, and on live TV and all since my son was 5 months old!

The Backyardigans have my vote for entertainment.  Now that my 2 yr old son thinks I am his personal MP3 player, I have to admit, I enjoy singing the songs from the shows.  I even have my favorites, but if I were forced to watch a marathon I think I could do it!  Invest in the Backyardigans from DVDs to CDs to toys and games and party supplies.  They are not just entertaining, but they model how children should socially interact and resolve conflict.  No inuendos here- I love them!",1175472000,,805,4.215686274509804
2676863,4,B000JLTRMW,"My 3 year old and 18 month old love the Backyardigans.  It's one of the few shows out there I can watch over and over with them and not be worn down like other kids shows.  We own most of the DVD's and catch the rest every day on Nick Jr & Noggin.  The series is great at teaching social behavior with others.  I wish these were around when my 9 year old was younger.  I think he would have benefitted from viewing these.

About The Legend of The Volcano Sisters: I really didn't think the episodes were as good as some of the others, but after I've watched the DVD about 20 times since I've bought it 3 weeks ago, it has grown on me.  I haven't seen any of these episodes prior to purchase.  None of these episodes stand up against prior episodes.  I'd have to say this particular DVD is just average.  Usually the songs are great.  Each episode has 3 or 4 good songs that will stick in your head.  Not so much here.  Still entertaining, but if you haven't been exposed to the Backyardigans, try one of the earlier DVD's before getting this one.  That being said, I don't regret the purchase and it's the one my kids ask for constantly.

One thing I like on the Backyardigans DVD's is that all 4 episodes play over and over.  At the end of the 4th episode, it'll go back to the main menu and restart after a minute.

There are extras I haven't watched: A Wonder Pets! Sneak Peek and a ""Secret Agent"" dance along (earlier Episode not on this DVD).",1173744000,4,1447,4.203636363636364
