That's right, I said bums. The NBA, NFL et al are ego-ball today. There was a time when top ability was put together with manners under pressure and team-over-me performance. WHo knows what was going through their minds, but what they put on the courts and on TV was the best 7 years of professional basketball I have seen. And I've seen about 51 years of it. This video, whilst only VHS, has the footage we missed from not setting our VCR timer (remember those) or simply turning the VCR to record the wrong channel... oops! The video is obviously a highlight reel. Nothing substitutes for watching the full-length games that some of us still have on tape, but compare the talent in this video to anything out today, and you will wonder why the NBA has allowed ego to take over the sport. Kareem, Worthy, Magic and Scott were real entertainers, without being visibly egocentric. I don't think Pat Riley would have allowed that.",1227398400,,1159,4.714285714285714

In 1985, it was about heart and hustle; pride, passion, and yes, even a  little prejudice.  Carrying the weight of dozens of Laker teams and the  expectations and hopes of decades of other league teams, the Los Angeles  Lakers battled history as well as a great Celtic team on the parquet floor  of intimidatingly haunted Boston Garden.  Through it all they found a path  back to glory and established a new era of dominance.  After being  humiliated the year before by tanking the Finals series against a lesser,  but not much, Boston team, the Lakers discovered a new purpose behind their  wins that they now shared with the doomed Laker teams of the sixties:  redemption.  These playoffs were not about winning a championship; they  were about beating Boston.  It wasn't about attaining fame and stardom but  instead about resurrecting their pride and character.  Along the way they  produced some of the greatest basketball ever played, before or since.  Today's teams and specifically their stat-happy, money-grubbing,  self-indulged players could take a lesson from.",963792000,,1222,5.260416666666667
