5647257,5,B00BMIVK4E,"This is based on a true story of a notorious mafia contract killer, who is believed to have murdered more than a hundred people. He married a woman and had kids with her, his family having no idea what he was doing. Michael Shannon is terrific as the intimidating killer, who is good at what he does. The film maintains intensity throughout, is not overlong, and appears to be a realistic look at the life of a low-level mafia figure. If you are a fan of quality tough-guy films, this one is certainly for you.",1370822400,4,510,4.378947368421053
5647258,3,B00BMIVK4E,"Michael Shannon, Winona Ryder, Ray Liotta, Stephen Dorff, and David Schwimmer like you've never seen him before, lead a first-rate cast in this dark attempt to bring the true story of Jersey City-bred mob contract killer Richard ""Iceman"" Kuklinski to the big screen and almost succeeds. Yeah, there's a few minor flaws here. The first mistake is one that I would consider to be debatable - using Anthony Bruno's book as a key reference instead of the late Philip Carlo's. IMO Carlo's was superior to the former. The second being a somewhat sketchy plot. For those who don't know, Kuklinski (Shannon) was a killer living in Bergen County and worked in the porn business before doing contract killings for Roy Demeo (Liotta) of a Brooklyn faction in the Gambino Family. An awesome cameo from Stephen Dorff as Richard's deranged child rapist/murderer brother Joe Kuklinski is spot-on, and Shannon's dead-on impersonation of Kuklinski's HBO interviews is chilling. Schwimmer is hilariously sleazy as Josh Rosenthal (character's real name was Chris Rosenberg, Demeo's ""adopted son"") Oh, and there's a terrific scene in a disco, involving John Ventimiglia (Artie Bucco from Sopranos), with Blondie's 'Heart of Glass' blasting in the backround, that you have to see to believe.

5647259,4,B00BMIVK4E,"This is one of those gnarly stories based on real life; Richard Kuklinski's story has to be true, no one could make it up. In this R-rated thriller written and directed by Ariel Vromen, we see what shapes a contract killer, what is important to him and whether or not he holds any values. It's awkward for an audience when we find ourselves in a position to be rooting for a cold-blooded killer, and yet we really do NOT want to see his sweet family jeopardized, so we want him to survive.

The cast:
  * Michael Shannon (""Premium Rush"" and ""Boardwalk Empire"") is Richard Kuklinski, our contract killer; he is a limited man with limited options: no education, no charm and no skills (other than lethal ones), so he does the best he can with what he has. Shannon is one of the finest actors working today and this difficult role is worthy of him.
  * Winona Ryder (""The Dilemma"") is Deborah Pellicotti, the shy Catholic girl who wouldn't even do any heavy petting until she was married. Her devoted husband respected and adored her.
  * Chris Evans (""What's Your Number?"") is Mr. Freezy, whose ubiquitous ice cream truck moves invisibly through the city. This scraggly haired thug bears NO resemblance to ""Captain America"" let me tell you!
  * Ray Liotta (""The Details"") is Roy Demeo, a pornographer/crime lord who tested and then exploited the ice water which ran through Kuklinski's veins.

Because this takes place over a time span of nearly 20 years, you will get a kick out of the different cars, clothes, hair styles and mustaches that enjoyed passing popularity. Also, it's refreshing to see pagers and pay phones instead of the ever-present cell phones in today's world. If you are anything like me, you will appreciate ""the rest of the story"" which appears during the final credits. You can't like a film like this, but you can be impressed by it. Amazon will notify me when this is available.",1368921600,38,1901,4.681681681681682
5647260,4,B00BMIVK4E,"""The Iceman"" (2013 release; 106 min.; not to be confused with the 1984 movie ""Iceman"" with Timothy Hutton) brings the true-life story of Richard Kuklinski, the notorious New Jersey contract killer with a double life as devoted husband and father. As the movie opens, there is a very short glimpse of a very old Kuklinksi, saying ""I don't regret anything"", after which we are transported back in time to 1964 when Kuklinski (played by Michael Shannon) is on a date with Debbie (played by Winona Ryder). Debbie asks him what he does and he answers ""I do Disney movies"" (when in reality we later find out he works as a porn movie manufacturer). It is the beginning of a long double-life. Kuklinski and Debbie get married and soon have two young daughters. Meanwhile, Kuklinski gets involved in dubious dealings that lead him to become a contract killer. To tell you much more of the plot would surely ruin your viewing pleasure, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out,

Several comments: this movie (which in the end credits is shown to be based on the book of the same name, as well as the infamous ""Iceman Tapes: Interviews With a Killer"") is chilling and hard-as-nails, but ultimately riveting and yes, entertaining. There isn't so much surprise as to the story (since we all pretty much know how it's going to end), but in the circumstances of the story. How was Kuklinski able to have parallel lives in which his family had no idea about his ""other life""? Director Ariel Vromen does a great job in giving us clues. About midway into the movie there is a pivotal scene in which we see Kuklinski visiting his younger brother, who it turns out is in jail for murdering a 12 yr. girl. When Kuklinski tells him he now has a wife and 2 daughters, his brother goes ballistic, telling him ""you're no better than me, we're screwed up in the head"". There is another clutch scene in the movie: Kuklinski, with his family in the car, gets involved in a fender bender, and the other driver insults/threatens his wife, which send Kuklinski over the top (I won't reveal what exactly happens).

The performances in the movie are mostly outstanding, none more so than Michael Shannon, bringing a tour-de-force as we watch him in the role of Kuklinski over a 20 year period (mid-60s to mid-80s). But I was also quite impressed by Winona Ryder, whom I hadn't seen on screen in quite a while. Her role as the clueless but devoted wife and mother is top-notch. Check out also David ""Friends"" Schwimmer in a smaller role as Josh (another mobster) and James Franco in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo (less than 5 min. screen time). Please note that I did not mention Ray Liotta, I mean, how many more mobster characters can the guy still bring? There was some nice music placement, we hear ELO's ""Livin' Thing"" during a roller-skating outing of Kuklinski and his family, and later we also get Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"" in a disco scene where a hit is planned.

Bottom line: this movie flew by in no time for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it, more so for the performances than for anything else. There are quite a bit of violent scenes, so this is probably not for anyone faint of heart. This movie showed up this weekend on a single screen for all of Greater Cincinnati, but I must say that, given the subject matter of the movie, I was quite surprised how well attended the screening was when I saw this. If you are in the mood for something gritty and dark with outstanding performances, you cannot go wrong with this. ""The Iceman"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1368748800,61,3555,4.612954186413902

5647270,3,B00BMIVK4E,"I can see why critics panned this film since it's workmanlike at best and whitewashes what a monster Kuklinsky was. Still, Michael Shannon is a hell of an actor and extremely impressive in this film as the Polish hitman who regularly carried out the most vicious murders to maintain his loving family in suburban New Jersey. Ray Liotta also gives a stock, but nonetheless good performance as his Mafia boss, Roy DeMeo. I also spotted at least one Sopranos alumni, John Ventimiglia, in a turn as DeMeo's hotheaded underling.

If you really want to get scared, however, watch the interviews Kuklinsky did with UVA law professor, Park Dietz. Just watching the guy on TV terrified the living bejesus out of me. The calm, low key, deep voice and the absolutely dead eyes as he recounts one horrid crime after another really are disturbing.

Michael Shannon does one hell of a job in character. He pulls off facial expressions, attitudes, and lines perfectly in my opinion. I also really enjoyed Chris Evans and am generally a fan of his no matter what he's in, but after watching the movie ""Gifted"", it was a pretty stark contrast, though he played his role well. The one complaint I have is the fact that they made the person that Michael Shannon played out to be a genuine pretty good guy when he wasn't killing people, but from online websites and biographic interviews, he was in fact a pretty abusive guy to his wife and kids at times, described as being bipolar with displays of physical and emotional abuse towards them.

Exceptional performances from the entire cast makes this assassin for hire type movie better than most. IF you are a James Franco fan, he is only in it for a minute. Winona Ryder as the assassins clueless wife is terrific too. Ray Liotta barks way too much but I guess his part called for it and Chris Evans is out of this world great as a rival assassin.

With a heavyweight cast that also includes Ray Liotta, Winona Ryder, Chris Evans, James Franco, and David Schwimmer (enough talent to fill three films), it's actually Stephen Dorff, in a cameo appearance as the killer's brother, who steals his scenes from the lead, Shannon.  That all would seem to bode well for the film's chances, though, with more grisly violence than some well-known horror films, some viewers may find the film's dark subject matter overbearing (and that's without mentioning unpleasant subplots).  In other words, you may want to limit your popcorn intake while watching!

5647293,3,B00BMIVK4E,"After watching the two HBO specials in ""A Night With the Iceman,"" and learning quite a bit about Richard Kuklinski, I decided to view this movie.  I THINK I was disappointed! The movie seemed to really rush through his years as a killer too quickly.  I feel if I didn't know what I learned about him through the HBO shows, I may have been confused. Actually, I still am somewhat confused by this movie as it didn't go into much depth.  It was true to the interviews ""Richie"" did for HBO, but too superficial.
Michael Shannon did a great job learning the mannerisms of Kuklinski; he was well prepared for the roll. I was NOT impressed with Ray Liotta but not because he didn't act well, but because he just didn't seem to fit the part.  He reminded me of Rick from Magnum PI! I wasn't very impressed with Winona Ryder, either.  Just a so-so performance.
All in all, the movie jumped ahead too quickly and too often like a Cliff Note version of the Iceman's persona.

TITLE: The Iceman (2012)  R  1:45:27
  Michael Shannon, Winona Ryder, Chris Evans, James Franco
  Ariel Vromen (Director)

  ""The Iceman"" is a movie that I had heard very little about before Amazon put it on sale for one of its ""Black Friday"" events. Because of the LOW price, I took the plunge and bought it sight-unseen (which, for me, is HIGHLY unusual). I am VERY happy that I did, as this movie is an underrated gem; with a very interesting story and with very good to excellent performances by the cast. Highly recommended. See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO: 1.78:1  Color  1080p  MPEG-4 AVC (20.2 Mbps)

  While the images in this presentation of the ""The Iceman"" are mostly (but, not always) sharp, it has poor contrast (which, admittedly, may be a conscious decision by the director/cinematographer because of the dark gritty nature of the source material  which, by the way, is why I ""generously"" scored it a 3.6 for VIDEO quality; however, if the film's look was NOT intentional, then it deserves a 2.5 VIDEO quality score). However, because of this lack of contrast there are absolutely NO truly dark (i.e.black) shadows anywhere in this picture (with the darkest of them looking like a not-very-dark hazy gray); and, since the vast majority of the movie takes place in dark indoor settings and at night, this makes for an image that, on the whole, appears to be washed-out and not very dimensional. Mercifully, there were no additional major picture anomalies (such as: specks, hair-lines, white dots, excessive banding, color fluctuations, etc.) to further mar this movie's image. Overall, I think that most of this movie's picture quality issues could be solved by placing it on a BD-50 disc (instead of its current DB-25 disc) and significantly increasing its bit-rate. In the end, because of all of its issues, I rate this movie's picture quality as barely adequate: meaning, that while it may satisfy the casual viewer (particularly on 40-inch or smaller TV's, with out-of-the-box picture settings), most serious viewers and videophiles will find it very, to severely, lacking.

AUDIO: Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (48KHz, 24-bit)

  The audio quality exhibited by the Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack on this disc is, particularly when contrasted (pun intended) with its visual presentation, a revelation! The surround channels were very active and very directional, dialog was cleanly recorded and is natural sounding and is well-placed, and ambient sounds (which were used to convey the location of the on-screen settings and actions) were very effectively integrated into the soundtrack. Plus, surprisingly, there are plenty of occasions where deep, energetic bass is evident; and, not just in the subwoofer channel, but in ALL of the other channels as well. This is a very fine example of cinematic sound design, that while it is NOT a Dolby Atmos / DTS:X / 7.1 presentation, is still an excellent 5.1 soundtrack, which should satisfy all but the very pickiest of listeners.

5647316,5,B00BMIVK4E,"Based on actual accounts along with the book ""THE ICEMAN: The True Story of a Cold Blooded Killer"" by Anthony Bruno, in addition too, the documentary ""THE ICEMAN Tapes: Conversations with a Killer"" by James Theraut and a compelling screenplay by Morgan Land & Ariel Vromen, Millennium Films presents an Ehud Bleiberg/Millennium Films Production of: THE ICEMAN. Talk about a riveting Mafia movie that focuses on the life of their legendary hit-man, the brutally sadistic, non-stop killer: THE ICEMAN. Murder for hire is bad, enough! But, the notorious ICEMAN was so good at it, that he took it to a whole new level and was incredibly barbarous in his methods of human liquidation. Which is why, the true-life, ICEMAN - Richard Kuklinski, was sentenced to two ""Life Sentences"" for his needless, killing spree. What makes matters worse is, that this is not just another mesmerizing 'make believe', Hollywood motion picture. No. It is a very graphic, big-screen depiction of a hit-man and his actual Mafia ""hired"" killings, as well as, his own savage, murderous rampage, when he went rogue. And also, with ""Mr. Freezy"" (as portrayed by Actor: Chris Evans) who, was his part-time, human body, dismembering partner. Believe it! So too say, that this movie is both shocking and disturbing, is an understatement. To think..., that one man can be so ruthless, cold-blooded and utterly deranged in his human elimination 'process' and subsequent disposal thereof..., send's a frightening chill, down ones spine. Outside of defending oneself (or a loved one) and in a time of war, whether it's a Mafia Hit or any other type of murder, is a devastating and heinous crime. One murder..., for the simple sake of murder, is one murder, too many. Especially, if it involves a member of Law Enforcement. Such as: A Police Officer, a Detective or a County Deputy. Then, Capital Punishment is absolutely appropriate, if not mandatory. But, having single-handily killed 100 men (that we know of) for money to support his unsuspecting family, too THE ICEMAN..., it was 'business as usual.' Seriously, can you imagine your loving husband or father, doing such an inconceivable thing?? This powerful film - THE ICEMAN, is Directed by: Ariel Vromen and stars, Actor: Michael Shannon in the title role. He brilliantly and very convincingly, portrays Richard Kuklinski - the true life killer, who murdered 100 men (that he admitted too killing), in bone chilling, cold-blood and then went on too dismember several of them. All the while, he was a happily married, one woman - man, who truly adored his wife and two daughters. By all accounts, he was a devoted husband, a doting father and a true, family man. Having deceived his wife Deborah (as played by the beautiful Actress: Winona Ryder) into thinking that he was into ""...currency exchange..."", he was actually very generous and provisional in attending to the needs and desires of his wife, daughters and even, towards friends. And, was enjoying the upper class, American Dream in Dumont, New Jersey, in a very picturesque home while tooling around in a Lincoln Town Car. Living comfortably with his wife and children in a quiet, affluent, suburban neighborhood. And, all was well. Or, so it seemed. In that, appearances can be deceiving. How did it all start? Long ago, when he and his brother Joey (who was sitting within a New Jersey prison for having killed a 12-year old girl), were both severely abused, as children. Whereas in his youth, Richard (THE ICEMAN), did terrible things to both humans and animals, but was never caught. In April 1964 in New Jersey City, as a young, unmarried, adult on his first date with his future wife, although he was quiet shy, he was already an accomplished pathological liar from the word ""go!"" In that, when she asked him about his employment, he stated that he was dubbing Disney cartoons. When in fact, he was dubbing pornography for a local Mob Boss, named: Roy Demeo. And, it was the Mafia Mobster - Roy Demeo (as portrayed by Actor: Ray Liotta), who closed down the pornography dubbing ""job"" and offered and elevated Kuklinski to a ""career"" opportunity, as a hit man for hire. Hence, THE ICEMAN, emerges. The truth of the matter was, that THE ICEMAN was psychotic and a real socio-path with a hair trigger temper. Who made murder a secret career, so that he could support his family and live the 'good life.' Some would argue that he did, what he did... (continuously murder), because he was terribly abused, as a child. Specifically, because those within the professional ""social field's"" of: Psychiatry, sociology, human behavior and analysis and so forth, say that ""...those who were abused, grow up to be abuser's."" Or at some point, ""act out"" negative, learned behavior. But, with 7-billion people in the world, a third or one-half of which were abused in some form or fashion, not all grow up to be greedy liars, mafia hit men or rogue murderer's. Those who were abused mentally, emotionally, physically or even sexually as children, have a choice to forgive (not forget...), and move on with their lives. Whereas others, establish programs or foundations for those that have also suffered through and been subject too, the same fate. They persevere through the negative and supplement good..., for evil that was done to them. It's a matter of choice (which THE ICEMAN, had...), and a matter of getting past those horrific memories and forgiving ones, abuser. In that, they realize that the person who abused them, be it parent or guardian, was sick... mentally or emotionally or both, and that someone has to stop that terrible cycle of abuse. With that said, this mesmerizing, big-screen depiction of actual events, comes to it's viewing audience in color, on a single-disc, DVD in full frame format and shows for approximately 105-minutes. Dear Reader, this is one really spellbinding movie, complete with plenty of action and drama. But, it is very bloody and graphic. And definitely not, for the kiddies. Even some adults, may be sickened by it. If not physically, then psychologically. Because besides the multitude of murders that he committed, he actually butchered dead bodies, stuffed them into a freezer within an ice-cream truck or a warehouse freezer and then, went home to his loving wife and daughters, as if nothing unusual had happened. And kept up this hypocrisy and duality of personality and poker faced lies, for literally..., years. And further used his inhumane debauchery and the proceeds thereof, too send his daughters to a private Catholic School, complete with priests and nuns. Because, get this..., in his own youth, he was an alter boy. Talk about an extremely dangerous and mixed up man. But, for THE ICEMAN, it was ""just another day"", at the office. So, with that in mind, might I suggest that you don't eat your family dinner while watching this disturbing, yet captivating film?! Because again, there is a total disregard for human life at the hands of a 'killing machine' in human form, such as, THE ICEMAN, was. And, there is a surplus of violence, blood and graphic, human carnage. In addition too, strong language and some sexual content. This true-life, murderous, pathological liar was such a master of deception, that his family and friends were truly broad-sided when..., while celebrating his daughters' birthday within their home, the Mafia Boss - Roy Demeo and company, paid him an unwelcome visit. And for THE ICEMAN and his family, it was downhill from, there. This enthralling depiction comes in spoken English with subtitles in English and Spanish. And, the Special Features, include: ""The Making of THE ICEMAN"" and ""The ICEMAN:Behind the Scenes."" This shock, biographical, illustration of a killer... seemingly without a conscience, is absolutely riveting. His one murderous stipulation - if you will, was that he doesn't kill women or children. But other than that, his conscience was most definitely, seared. Because it's inconceivable, the heinous things that he actually did... to a human body, even months after, they were dead. This movie is entertaining, in the sense that it vividly depicts actual facts and not fiction, that took place, not so very long ago. And not, in some imaginary book or creative, movie studio. This guy was for real! In every sense of the word. He actually, did these things! So, if you're a student of human behavior or any of the social sciences and/or criminal justice, then you need to see this film, if you haven't already. Because if anything, it is very educational from a human study or criminal profile perspective, and a keeper for your DVD collection. So, what happened to THE ICEMAN? Well, he was finally arrested and ironically, placed into the same cell block as his brother Joey, and he never saw his family, again. He died in 2006, within the Trenton State Prison in the State of New Jersey, and yes... he may have been murdered. Especially since, he was going to testify against an Underboss within the Gambino Mafia Family. This is an absolutely unbelievable movie that was ""for real!""

The kind of people that will ruin other people's lives for years on end so that they can basically buy a nice home and expensive furniture, other material possessions.

But that's the kind of world we're living in. Not an entirely terrible world,but one where danger lurks very near at all times.
  This is the story of a man that was a contract-killer for the mob between the 60's through the 80's.

5647346,4,B00BMIVK4E,"Michael Shannon is simply terrific at playing the ""creepy"" guy...the one with perhaps a normal exterior, but whose inner life is deeply troubled.  Usually, he delivers these shadings in the service of relatively nice guys (REVOLUTION ROAD, TAKING SHELTER [maybe his best role] and BUG, for example).  These are all nice guys with issues.  Shannon lets us see the surface and also the anguish just below.  Whether it's a gaze that doesn't quite meet your eyes, or a furrowed brow or just a turn of phrase...he's never less than riveting and just a little scary.

In THE ICEMAN, he has found the perfect character...one that no one but him could have played as well.  While his lead role in the remarkable TAKING SHELTER is perhaps his most layered performance; his role in this true story is perhaps the most tailor-made for him.  Which IS ironic, since it's a true story.  Shannon plays a cold-blooded killer for the Jersey mob.  Over the decades, it is estimated he killed over 100 people.  In all manners of death and without remorse or pity.  And without any seeming enjoyment.  His face is a blank stare.  When he is threatened with death, he has virtually no reaction beyond mild curiosity...and when he kills, there is even less going on.  But when he is temporarily sidelined, he becomes like a caged animal, literally pacing and on edge and ready to explode.  Killing clearly is his way of exorcising some kind of personal demon.

At the same time, Shannon is married and has a lovely family he cherishes above all else.  His feelings, though a bit tightly contained, seem genuine.  He loves his wife (Wynona Ryder) and never strays from her.  His daughters are the light of his life.  He keeps them sheltered from what he really does, and provides for them well.  He is a bit of an odd-bird, even to his wife...but certainly no one would suspect what he really does.

This is a dark and low-budget film.  There is little sunshine to be found, and given that much of it takes place in the '70s, it has an extra sheen of grime that comes with all the polyester.  And the plot itself is pretty straightforward.  We know (because the first scene shows us) that Shannon will be caught, but because he is surrounded by other low-life thugs who seem even more petty than him, we actually sort of root for the guy.  The story is told through his eyes almost entirely, and we cannot help but side with him just a bit.  There is, I reluctantly admit, something a bit gripping about seeing someone who is a master at what he does at work.

Shannon is the main reason, by far, to see this film.  He is mesmerizing throughout.  Ray Liotta  has a significant role as the mob boss...doing the exact same character he's been doing for about 20 years.  Ryder is fine...the role is hardly one that would revive her career, but it's good to see her in something where she isn't making fun of herself too.  Best of all is Chris Evans as another hit man, who embarks on a years long collaboration of sorts with Shannon.  His personality is all flash and sparkle...and Evans, normally such a straight-laced good guy (CAPTAIN AMERICA, anyone?) looks great in the '70s garb and hair.  He's busting out with energy, creating a stark contrast with Shannon's contained rage.

We find out very little about this true to life character.  We get a tiny glimpse at what may have broken in him, but no sense of what makes him so casual about killing.  His love for his family seems genuine and shows real emotion.  Yet he appears to be a sociopath of the first order.  The two sides of him make for an uneasy reconciliation for the viewer, which I feel only adds to the power of the film.

The climax of the film comes fast and surprising.  And Shannon finally gets a chance to let loose...and it's a thing of power and rawness.  And unlike with his silly character in MAN OF STEEL, when this guy sees his life instantly collapsing, his outcry of rage and horror is chilling.

I highly recommend this film, although it does have a bleak outlook on life and humanity.  I didn't feel depressed at its conclusion (not at all, it is so well done), but I wasn't exactly uplifted!  [By the way, James Franco receives pretty high billing in the film and is on the cover of the disk.  He is in exactly one brief scene.  Just to warn ya.]",1439078400,,4306,4.523994811932555

That was totally uncalled for. The real Richard Kuklinski was a serial killer who killed numerous people for no good reason including many homeless people whom he killed for sport. Despite being presented as a loving family man he in fact physically abused his wife on numerous occasions, once stabbing her and on another occasion breaking her nose. Many of his victims were his business partners and in fact he commented that there was only one friend of his whom he didn't kill. Richard Kuklinski wasn't a loving family man who reluctantly murdered people who probably deserved it to support his family. He was a sadistic vicious paranoid serial killer who should not have been portrayed as anything other than the monster he absolutely was.

5647366,4,B00BMIVK4E,"I watched the film with Academy Award nominee Michael Shannon portraying the title character, Richard Kuklinski also known as the Iceman. Shannon deserved accolades for his performance of this very dark human being. Kuklinski was a hit man for the mob and anybody who paid him to off a man. He drew the line at killing women or children. He was also a husband and father to his two daughters living in suburban New Jersey. Winona Ryder does a fabulous job playing his wife, Debra.  Other cast members include New Jersey native and Goodfellas actor, Ray Liotta; Chris Evans as Mr. Freezy; Friends' David Schwimmer as Josh Rosenthal; and Robert Davi. Stephen Dorff is unrecognizable as Richard's brother Joey.

The film shows the brutality and violence of his crimes but his commitment to his family as well. From the film, we see Richie's dark side seep into his family life as well. He could be abusive as well to his wife and children. The film may have been told from his point of view.

The film made it seem like he did the killing as a job but he was brutal, cruel, merciless, unforgiving, and cold to his victims. To the audience, we don't know much about his childhood but we do learn about his brother, Joey, who raped and killed a twelve year old girl. The audience doesn't see their upbringing as abusive except for one scene in the film.

However, in the scene that depicts his first killing (early 60s) he reaches in and shuts off the ignition, which is in the steering column. Unfortunately for the editors, those steering column ignitions did not make their debut until 1969. Big, hefty faux pas.

5647380,4,B00BMIVK4E,"the acting carries this based on a true story film.  The roy demao crew was one of histories most bloody murder groups the blood stained mafia ever had.  Although the original murder inc. wiped out over a thousand people. they tried never to kill the families of their victims.  This group could have cared less. And all of them ended up dead and murdered by the people they served.  Which was typical for the mafia in any era.  This basically tells the story of the iceman , not the ancient one of course. Who was also murdered 5,000 years ago.  Anyways, there are two other movies called 'iceman'  one from the 1980's starring tim hutton, and one from a few years ago from china. (that one is 3d and about martial arts). This one is a decent enough film about the horrendous life of the iceman.  I think they capture him in spirit here.  How he was a psychopath that at least loved his family and who tried to do right by them.  But I do wish Hollywood would stick closer to the real story. It's even more bloody and interesting than this version. But the acting here is fantastic from the lead and winona ryder as his wife.  The supporting cast is very good too. You could make several movies about the bloody de mao crew so lets hope they do that.  This should be on blu ray.

5647410,3,B00BMIVK4E,"First, I'd like to say that Mr. Kuklinski is a very intriguing man.  I first learned about him from reading Anthony Bruno's The Ice Man: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer.  I followed that up, eventually, purchasing The Iceman Interviews DVD, which I have watched several times over.  When I learned about this movie, I couldn't wait to see it, but...as time would have it, I wouldn't see it until yesterday. When I finally got to see this movie, after reading the top reviews, I was even more excited about the movie, the way Michael Shannon was praised for his acting, and Winona Ryder, whom I love and want to have babies with...I couldn't wait to see this movie!  The opening scene was ok, because I don't recall previously knowing any facts about Richie meeting Barbara, so that scene was cool with me...But so many other scenes were WRONG. I'd rather go by words straight from the horse's mouth than by some book written by whomever.  In other words, so many scenes in the movie are just wrong, if you go by the HBO Iceman Interviews.  I think Winona Ryder is the best in this movie...Michael was ok.  Liotta looked nothing like the real Demeo and Mr. Frosty (Mr. Softy in real-life) was so so wrong.  It made me angry, so say the least, that this movie strayed so far from the facts, according to Mr. Kuklinski's interviews with HBO.

It's a great movie if you don't know anything about the man, but I'm getting angry just thinking about how much they strayed from real life facts.",1406851200,,1494,4.544776119402985

5647413,2,B00BMIVK4E,"In real life Kuklinski beat his wife all the time and his children and wife hated him, but I enjoyed this film and it has some good performances.  I would've given it 4 stars if it wasn't for the note that comes up after the film is done which I will explain later.

The film makes you feel some empathy for the Iceman who is portrayed as a saint when it comes to his family- but the truth is very different.  In reality, he often beat his wife so badly that she suffered miscarriages and broken bones.  His wife tried breaking up with him when they were just dating, but he cut her in the back of the neck with a hunting knife and threatened to kill her if she dared leave him... and that's why she ended up marrying him.  Not out of love, but out of fear.  His daughters hated him so much that at least one of them plotted to poison him by putting something in his food.  The only people who wanted this man dead more than the mafia bosses was his own family.  In an interview his former wife said: ""I will regret for the rest of my life, that I didn't just tell him the bastard he is and how much I hate him. I wish the last words he'd heard had been how much I hated his guts.""  Some loving family man, huh?  But none of this really bothers me because these based on true story films are often full of misrepresentations and making the lead character someone to empathize with makes the experience more engaging for the viewer.  As long as you keep these expectations you can enjoy these types of films as simply good movies without holding them up to any standard of truth.

But here is the thing that I do think is a big deal:  After the movie ends the director flashes a note on screen stating that Kuklinski never saw his family again.  This is a flat out lie.  Kuklinski's wife continued to visit him in jail for almost a decade after his incarceration.  According to her out of fear for her children since she thought that despite him being imprisoned he could still have someone on the outside cause harm to her.  And she secretly recorded (with the help of a film production office) many of the phone conversations between he and she after he had gone to prison where the recordings show that he did he theaten her over the phone.  When he was dying his wife took one of their daughters to visit him in the prison hospital also.  I can excuse the director attempting to make the audience feel sorry for the lead CHARACTER, but I cannot excuse the director's blatant attempt to make the audience feel sorry for the REAL man, by printing the lie that he never saw his family again at the end of the film.  Creating false scenes in a movie to make a good story are one thing, but the statements written at the end of a film are definitely meant to make the viewer believe something that occurred in reality.  The statement that flashes across the screen stating that he never saw his family again was a flat out deception meant to evoke sympathy and I do not support it.  If you ever meet director Ariel Vromen, don't take him at his word for anything.

For a final note I have cut and pasted the following from an article on the final hours of the iceman.

""as Richard Kuklinski's life finally slipped away, he became conscious long enough to ask doctors to make sure they revived him if he flatlined. But before she left, Barbara had signed a ""do not resuscitate"" order. A week before his death, in the early hours of March 5 2006, the hospital called Barbara to ask if she wished to rescind the instruction. She did not.""",1405555200,6,3533,4.294117647058823

While the script is a bit threadbare and the story is loose, the acting is compelling.  An A-list cast of actors turns this film from a generic movie about a real life killer to a groundbreaking in depth look at character.  You watch the brooding anger in Michael Shannon's performance and his love for his family truly comes across the screen. The duality of taking care of his family by any means necessary is never more clear than in this film. I could only compare it to the reluctance and seething anger of Al Pacino in the original godfather.  I truly felt compelled by his performance. Chris Evans was a nice surprise as well and he seemed to enjoy his self and have fun with the role. I saw his ability in a whole new light and i am impressed. Ray Liotta always delivers an intense performance and this is no exception.  Kuklinsky was a complicated man and yet very simple.

5647427,4,B00BMIVK4E,"This movie is not one I would generally watch although sometimes I like to see a  film like; ""Good Fellas"", ""The Departed"", ""The Godfather"", you get the idea.  These are not the usual 'go to' movies for me, but most of them are my favorites, it just depends on the mood.  Watching ""The Iceman"" sent chills down my spine and scared me to death more than anything else, actually because the cast was excellent.  The acting of Michael Shannon was over-the-top brilliant, even more so as it is based on someone real. The movie itself is very dark, thematically and also visually. Just Frightening.

Ariel Vromen wrote the part then directed a perfectly steely and unfeeling Michael Shannon as ""The Iceman"", Richard Kuklinski. I was entirely enthralled with his flat-affect facial manner.  No visible emotion on his face, one couldn't tell what was going to necessarily happen.  He didn't seem to have any marketable skills for working, and didn't appear to care, he also lacked any social ability or prowess.  The one thing that Kuklinski could do with precision is take away a life without batting an eye. He works as a vicious contract killer, nobody is off limits.  Kuklinski works for Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) who is a criminal himself and higher on the food-chain, calling all the shots for him.  The Iceman is involved in all types of felonious behavior, at first, before Demeo has him prove himself loyal for his use. He then starts his horrific murderous lifestyle.

When he begins dating his wife, Deborah Pellicotti (Wynona Ryder), it's curious to watch the off-key sweetness involved in their romance, if this is what one would call it.  It is as if he is a completely different person with her.  Deborah is an all around good girl type, so unlike him.  The Catholic girl that will not be with a man before marriage.  In contrast, Kuklinski is a hard-hearted killer, cold and calculating, but then entirely respectful and loving with his girlfriend then wife; this, of course, is according to the movie. She appears to remain oblivious to her husband's job and what he is up to.  The dichotomy of Kuklinski is altogether fascinating to view, it felt like I was watching two different people throughout the two decades this encompasses.  The surroundings change from the story's beginning in 1964.  The way people dress, what properties and housing look like, the cars, right down to every detail has to move on with the times.  I enjoyed these changes and also was intrigued with the subsequent dramatic legalities.

The movie is definitely not for everyone as it is extremely violent.  To really enjoy this type of movie would be a personal subjective choice according to your ability to tolerate violence. As for myself, watching this movie was so frightening, then again, it was impossible to look away from. I was told there are documentaries made previous to this which include interviews with Kuklinski if you are so inclined. Possibly seeing them as a compliment to this movie could help explain the psychology involving such an antagonist.  That is what would interest me the most.  I don't understand what drives a person such as Richard Kuklinski; Why he did what he did.  Did he have any respect or thoughts about a human life in any regard?  I don't care whatsoever about him personally, I just wish to know why, and during this story, this question is definitely asked of the viewer.",1393545600,3,3401,4.812392426850258

So, I decide to rent it with the wife to joke with her about lets see what your dad see's so fascinating about this guy.(I knew a little though). We were both like wow. The acting across the board was great. Michael Shannon was the perfect cast for this movie. Through three time periods, wardrobe and set pieces were spot on. Seeing him trying to balance home life to his murder life was quite interesting. To think this all really happened is just insane.

based on the historical facts.  We learn that there are two ways in which
the nickname attaches to him.

Probably because psychopaths are not very introspective and because
whatever they say about themselves is as likely to be a lie as the truth,
we never feel like we are really connected to the main character.  We
are simply watching what he does.  His inner workings are almost a black
box at the end of the movie as at the beginning.  When he is finally caught
and convicted, he talks with some tearfulness about how he has hurt his
family (nothing about the victims or their families) and even then, it's not
clear that he cares as much about THEM, as about how he has been
permanently deprived of being with them.  Michael Shannon is great at

5647443,1,B00BMIVK4E,"This movie is really terrible. It can't even compare with the book on which it is based, and it has got a lot of details wrong about the life and the crimes of Richard Kuklinski. Even his family is not portrayed correctly since he also had a son and his wife's name was not Debora but Barbara! Kuklinski used to be extremely violent towards his family and he abused systematically his wife, driving his children desperate. The film also does not even mention some of the most atrocious murders that Kuklinski did (like feeding  men alive to rats, or torturing others with knives and salt for hours before feeding them to sharks), it doesn't show anything about his murderous trips to Switzerland and Brazil, but it wastes time to show trivial things like a car pursuit which in fact never happened! Also the killing of a random person which Kuklinski did in order to pass the test set to him by De Meo is pictured in a totally wrong way. The way the police tracked down this madman is also totally omitted, as is the role that certain people played in order to find evidence and make a clue out of all the random killings that Kuklinski left in his wake. So don't waste your time watching this disappointing and poor movie which has almost nothing to do with the real story but if you are really interested to that maniac serial killer read the book instead, which is terrific and a real page turner.",1390176000,2,1400,4.490196078431373

In ""The Iceman"", I thought the role or the way he played the roll was too one-dimensional.  He needs to seek out roles that allow him to show more depth...Frankenstein's Monster would be great....He could bring the sympathetic side that Boris Karloff brought to the role; he could bring much of the subtle gag material that Mel Brooks brought to the ""Young Frankenstein"".

I know I have wandered off track here because I want to see this actor succeed.

Download this movie; Watch this guy in ""Boardwalk Empire"".  He is incredible as a scary, creepy guy with one dimension.  You can't look away when he's on the screen. But, I believe he has many dimensions and should be encouraged to seek those types of roles.

5647458,3,B00BMIVK4E,"Ariel Vromenands crime drama The Iceman chronicles the criminal career of Richard Kuklinski (played by Michael Shannon), a real-life professional killer. He married and had two daughters, but he kept what he had been doing for a living a secret from his family members for more than twenty years.

The Iceman begins strongly, depicting how Kuklinski was hired by a gangster Roy DeMeo (Liotta) as a contract killer. Up to the one-hour mark the film manages to grab your attention, portraying the man with convincing details. The impressive cast includes Winona Ryder (as Richards wife Deborah), Robert Davi, Stephen Dorff, Chris Evans, James Franco, Ray Liotta and David Schwimmer, and they all did great jobs.

But after Kuklinski meets Robert 'Mr. Freezy' Pronge (Chris Evans), contract killer disguised as ice cream truck driver, the film loses its way, leaving some intriguing questions unanswered. (How rich was he? How did he get caught?)

The Iceman is based on Anthony Bruno's book The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer and I know there are HBO documentaries featuring the interviews with Richard Kuklinski himself. I have not read or seen either of them. Perhaps I should have.

The greatest asset of the film is, not surprisingly, Michael Shannons brilliant (and chilling) performance as the merciless contract killer. Another merit is the nice production values that recreate the tone and ambiance of the 1960s and 70s. The Iceman is deeply flawed, but is still worth watching for his acting.",1388275200,,1516,5.125506072874494
5647459,5,B00BMIVK4E,"I thought the book on repellant human behavior was closed with ""Goodfellas"" and ""The Sopranos"" but ""The Iceman"" dispels that notion.  Michael Shannon's Richard Kuklinski is what you would call a different breed of evil one of the blue collar stripe.  What is fascinating about Shannon's portrayal is how he demonstrates Kuklinski's ability to compartmentalize.  When he's on the job he's as cold and efficient as his handlers want him to be.  Off the job he's a warm and doting husband and father.  Initially Kuklinski works at a porn manufacturer run by mob underboss Roy DiMeo(Ray Liotta) until it's shut down.  DiMeo keeps Kuklinski in his employ after he ruthlessly kills a street person.  All is fine until DiMeo lets him go and Kuklinski gets contract work and things get complicated. Good supporting work from Winona Ryder as Kulinski's clueless wife and particularly Chris Evans as an ice cream truckdriving  killer.  James Franco, who seems to have been everywhere this year, does a bit as a sleazeball.

5647464,4,B00BMIVK4E,"Michael Shannon seems on a rise with no stopping him. Even in movies he's been in that might not have been the best movie, he's always been good. This is one of his better films.

Here's the scoop. Shannon plays Richard Kuklinski. He works at a lab finishing adult movies. The big guy who owns said lab and adult film distributor (Ray Liotta) is closing the lab but sees something in Kuklinski and wants to bring him on as a hit man. Kuklinski is just now getting married (to Winona Ryder) and can use the dough. He accepts and does the job while dabbling in various markets on the side. Things begin to go south and the law starts closing in on him.

This is a heck of a flick. The writing, acting, directing and music are all on par with the content. Shannon does an outstanding job. When he visits his brother in prison you realize he's a man on the edge. To him, killing is a job. If someone wants someone dead ""who am I to argue"" is his rationale. But he loves his wife and two daughters, so when their safety is compromised, his ""job"" gives way to his true nature. He is one sick dude and will kill anyone he needs to to hold on to that tiny thread of sanity.

Robert Davi, Ray Liotta all do a good job. The real surprise is David Schwimmer as Liotta's underling. This has been his best effort in breaking away form his Ross persona.

This is an good examination of a man who has reportedly killed more than 100 people. It's a good story with a great performance at its core.",1387411200,2,1481,4.222614840989399

5647469,4,B00BMIVK4E,"For over two decades, Richie Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) lived a double life: loving father/husband and cold-blooded killer.  He starts as a nobody in a porn lab, but gets promoted when his small-time crime boss Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) recognizes the ice in Richie's veins.  Things eventually escalate, on part because of a no-account friend of Demeo's (David Schwimmer), and Richie is forced to take action to protect his wife and daughters.

THE ICEMAN is largely an actor's piece, though its plot, although starting slow, builds up to a decent pace about halfway through.  Shannon is fantastic in the central role; he always brings the same intensity to his performances, which sometimes helps (TAKE SHELTER) and sometimes doesn't (MAN OF STEEL).  The supporting cast is surprisingly strong; aside from the above (all great, especially Liotta), we get marvelous turns from Winona Ryder (who's having something of a career rebirth as a quality supporting actress), Robert Davi, Stephen Dorff, and an amazing (and unrecognizable) Chris Evans.  James Franco is also in there for about a minute, for some reason, although he's got nothing to do except make Shannon look cool.

The story (a true one) is captivating, as it actually does a decent effort of contrasting Richie's personal life against his professional life.  Ariel Vromen's direction is solid and steady, and the film looks fantastic, as it moves through the decades.  But again, this is mostly an actor's piece, a chance for Shannon to shine, and for for great actors to do great work in smaller roles for little reward.  Like the great gangster films it obviously takes inspiration from, THE ICEMAN doesn't glorify, it merely portrays.  It's effectively viscous in spots (some of the violence is sudden and unsettling), and yet the family scenes are decidedly sentimental.

As an author and ex p.i. I was interested in Kuklinski when I first saw him in a series of actual, long interviews on documentary TV when they first came out, and went on to research him thoroughly. I also reviewed the interviews on Youtube.

This film plays fast and loose with the truth, and is not really well put together or revealing of the sequence of events or the true character of Kuklinski. I am tired of seeing Ray Liota as a gangster. I am surprised they didn't bring in the old standard, Vincent Gardenia to play the godfather---oh...wait...he died, so OK. I always thought he was weak anyway; nothing like the people I knew in South Philly. Also, this film got just plain cartoonish and hokey in places.

Anyways...

Terrific acting all around, except for the rat-informant actor who just screamed all over ""I AM A RAT INFORMER!"" In actuality, the informer was deeply planted for other reasons, and Kuklinski knew the informer a long time. I thought this ending made Kuklinski look dumb, which he was not.

At the very end, Michael Shannon delivers one of the greatest monologues of acting I've ever seen, in that he captures almost perfectly the living Kuklinski anyone can see in the taped interviews. It was astonishing. I just wish the director had allowed Shannon to show his range throughout the film, instead of restricting him to (truly) lethal and scary stares.

We get to hear what Winona Ryder might sound like in bed and see hints of her big, smooth-looking...never mind. I thought she brought zero to the role and was just there as finance-bait.

I gave this one star because it's a true story that Hollywood (once again) felt it had to change. For instance, Kuklinski didn't shoot a homeless man to prove he was a killer to the mob; he shot a total stranger who was just out walking a dog. But, see, we have to have SOME sympathy or admiration for a character or the story loses the viewer, so, I guess, Hollywood felt the homeless thing was still bad but ""not THAT bad."" My son is a film exec' with Universal.

You can watch this and be enthralled, and I recommend it. See it! :)

 But for the true story check out wikipedia and Youtube.

CHOW! (yes, I know....)

5647476,1,B00BMIVK4E,"Michael Shannon as Richard Kuklinski is very one-dimensional, simple and a downright 'base' human being. I won't argue that it's likely exactly how the real Kuklinski was.
Get this, the only thing that ever propelled Kuklinski into celebrity status in this media induced society is the amount of people he killed. Think about it all you want, but, that is all there is to Richard Kuklinski.
That said, this film and the story of this man's life was an unjustifiable waste of time: book or movie format.
There is no depth or reason behind Kuklinski's crimes which are nothing but barbaric reactions to paranoia and later opportunism until he gets caught and sentenced.",1386028800,,667,4.911504424778761
5647477,4,B00BMIVK4E,"Between 1964 and 1986, Richard Kuklinski killed as many as 250 people for the mafia. His cold, callous style and willingness to do anything, earned him the nickname, The Iceman. In 1992, The Iceman granted HBO an exclusive interview, where he talked about his life and described his crimes, the way someone would describe their job. This film is the dramatization of Kuklinski's story, based entirely on what he said during his interview. Boardwalk Empire's Michael Shannon stars as Kuklinski and was absolutely the perfect choice to play him. Some actors, even ones like Shannon,  seem to be destine to play certain characters, it's how they make a name for themselves. Shannon is often knocked for being too cold and emotionless in his other roles, so he was essentially the perfect choice to play the Iceman. Shannon is paired with Winona Ryder and all these years later, she still manages to annoy the hell out of me. I really don't get what people see in her. The cast of this film is rounded out by some terrific cameos, by the likes of Ray Liotta, James Franco, and David Schwimmer, all of whom are terrific and add to the mystique of this film. I really did enjoy this film, but it is confusing and somewhat slow at times, slower than you wouldn't expect a film about a mafia hit-man to be. This films throws so many names at you and jumps from scene to scene and time to time so quickly, that it is a little difficult to keep track of who's who. Other than that, the performances are terrific and it's amazing how they were able to piece together a film from a simple interview, definitely worth checking out.",1385942400,,1618,4.598615916955017
5647478,5,B00BMIVK4E,"The Iceman is a 2012 film by director, Ariel Vromen. It is a 105 minutes of nothing but tension and suspense. Based on the true story of  Richie Kuklinski (portrayed by Michael Shannon), a polish hit-man contracted by the Mafia. In his career it is said that Kuklinski killed over 100 people for the mob.

It showcases a great cast. To me, unrecognizable, is Winona Ryder (who portrays Deborah, Kuklinski's wife), Ray Liotta (mob boss Roy DaMeo), Chris Evans as Mr. Freeze, and get this ... David Schwimmer from Friends (Ross) as Josh Rosenthal.

Dubbing porno films for a living, Kuklinski meets Deborah, and begins their relationship on a lie, claiming to dub animated films for Disney. A man of few words, once he is married the porno business comes to an end. Roy DaMeo likes Kuklinski's cool, calm and fearless attitude. He hires him to do mob hits. The condition is Kuklinski is only to work for Roy.

As in any organized crime syndicate, times are not always lucrative. In an attempt to continue to support is wife and daughters, Kuklinski teams up with Mr. Freeze taking on hits as a contractor. Once Roy finds out, things spin quickly out of control.

The story plot is not much more complex than. It is a movie about a hit-man. Double crossings, mistrust and paranoia. The Iceman, Richard Kuklinski,  made a name for himself in the '70's.

Rated R for obvious reasons, the movie is filled with violent deaths, disassembled bodies and some bad language and nudity. The acting was outstanding. I felt that Shannon did an exceptional job. And I will state again, I did not recognize Ryder at all. She doesn't look old, but neither does she look like herself. Maybe it's just me. Schwimmer will always be Ross, even if he wears a ponytail. His drug sales are almost humorous in this film, because I couldn't help anticipating the arrival of Joey and Chandler. Can you say, Typecast?

But I digress -- so let me get to it. I give the Iceman 9 out of 10 Stars!

The movie is NOT factual at all and it tries to portray the Iceman as being not that bad in some ways with him visiting his brother who was a pedo and murdered a girl as if to suggest that this is horrible (which it is) but how the iceman killed and tortured his victims was OK since some were criminals.

The film also portrays the iceman as being a family man when in reality he beat his wife very badly many times and she thought she was going to die, and he psychologically abused his children for decades.  There is another part in the movie where they try to make the viewer feel bad for the iceman or someone in his family but I will not spoil it.

I would have given this movie 2.5 stars since if it's on TV and you catch part of it, or you want to watch Hollywood's version of the iceman it's entertaining for those reasons; but if you want the facts look elsewhere.",1384905600,,920,4.094444444444444

My response to the reviewer who gave it a single star and tries to justify it by saying that the movie flopped at the
box office is just this:  many great films like Thief with James Caan and Rolling Thunder with William Devane
(among others)  initially flopped at the box office. All that means is that sometimes it takes audiences
years to wake up and appreciate the good films and/or great books.

My opinion? See it. Yes, the Iceman greases people left and right...(and believe you me, he did a lot
more than they were able to show in this film) and yet, seeing how he was raised, the violent environment he
grew up in, it's no real surprise at the way he turned out.

Final thought, as mentally skewed as he was, the guy still loved his immediate family.
I wouldn't sit in judgement, which is always easy to do, just watch the thing.
Shannon and Liotta excellent, as usual.",1383523200,2,980,4.4525139664804465

5647504,4,B00BMIVK4E,"This was a good movie,with great acting and an OK story. The problem I have with it is the glaring inaccuracy to the real story of Richard Kuklinski.
For instance:
1. Richard had a son (which isn't even mentioned in the movie) who his wife was worried Richard was going to kill because he didn't like his wife giving any attention to another man, even if it was his own son.
2. Richard wasn't a happy family man ,full of hugs and kisses. He did LOVE them ,and ONLY them, but the best he could muster in the treatment of his loved ones was to terrorize and abuse them in violent fits of rage.
3. When Richards wife left him due to his abusive nature he found her and let her know... I love you, so you need to come home. If you don't I will kill your entire family. Needless to say she came home...The movie makes her out to be completely oblivious to him as a person and what he was capable of.
4. One of the most bewildering things that Hollywood missed, or excluded to follow their ridiculous story, was the fact that when Kuklinski was asked to make a victim suffer he would tie them up and drive them to caves in Pennsylvania. He then would set up video equipment in the small cave, lay the bound and gagged live person in the cave and leave. Over the course of a few days the victim would be eaten alive by rats, all while being video taped. He then would take this tape to the person who ordered the hit for viewing...The likes of John Gotti and Sammy ""The Bull"" Gravano were unable to watch these films but applauded his methods and just how twisted Richard was. He did this style of hit many times and actually sat at home himself and watched the tapes numerous times. I guess it would be hard to push the loving family man bit AND show Richard watching ""home movies"" of people being eaten alive by rats.

The stories go on and on about this monster,none of which are in the movie.

 In conclusion, I still think this was a good movie. An interesting story about some obscure mid level mob hit man...But certainly not a story about the real Richard Kuklinski. If you would like the real scoop on Richard Kuklinski read the book The Ice Man: Confessions of a Mafia Contract Killer by Philip Carlo...The Amazon Link is below. It is an amazing story.

5647508,4,B00BMIVK4E,"There may be spoilers.

This is a factually based film which follows the adult crime life of notorious hit-man Richard Kuklinski.  Set in New Jersey, the story follows Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) from his early (1950's) introduction to crime boss Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) to his capture in the mid-1980's.

Kuklinski, a hulking figure, keeps an internal rage always in check, thus his nickname.  But make no mistake, he is a cold blooded assassin and only cares about 3 people.  His wife Deborah (Winona Ryder) and his 2 daughters.  Kuklinski dispatches friends with the same coolness as he does a stranger or an enemy.  Although I had a hard time understanding the attraction Deborah had for the mealy-mouthed thug, Kuklinski somehow manages to keep her and the girls happy and in the dark about his craft.  Instead they think he is a bond and currency-trader.  OK, if you say so.

Chris Evans (""Captain America"") is nearly unrecognizable as a fellow killer, as is David Schwimmer as an assistant to Demeo.  The acting is excellent, especially Shannon as the deeply dark and vicious Kuklinski.  While the film moves along briskly, it is mostly due to a mounting body count, which includes a character played by James Franco.

The film is hardly perfect, which is mostly due to Ariel Vromen's sometimes clumsy direction.  He seems much more interested in dispatching victims in unnecessarily unique ways than with providing more depth as to Kuklinski's motives or history.  There is also some confusion about who is who in the crime hierarchy.  And in one scene we see a newspaper headline that mentions the killing of Roy when in fact, he hadn't been killed at that point in the story.  But then, I was a bit confused as I said.

The film is dark, sinister and registers a high body count.  I have to admit however I was mesmerized by Shannon's depiction of Kuklinski.  I never felt sorry for the lug.  He got what he deserved, but his unknowing family didn't.

The Blu ray transfer comes in a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  I don't think this film will make anyone's demo list.  It is about as dank and dingy as the story itself.  And I suspect that is the idea.  So while the film is a bit fuzzy, pale and bleak it is well represented in the transfer.  Grain exists but it is moderate and consistent throughout.  I thought the Dolby TruHD 5.1 audio track was excellent.  The film has plenty of environmental sounds that play to the surrounds (traffic, cats, trains, etc.) There is a club scene with a Blondie song that sounds very authentic to the setting.  Dialog is very clear and easy to understand, even with Kuklinski's mumbling through most of the film.  Extras are minimal with a ""making-of"" featurette and a behind the scenes piece about casting the film.  Subtitles are available in Spanish and English SDH.",1382572800,,2831,4.737704918032787

You see, Richard Kuklinski has fascinated me since I saw the HBO Specials and read the Phillip Carlo book. The detached way he approaches the most gruesome murders -- he doesn't particularly enjoy it, but he also thinks absolutely nothing of doing it.

This was totally lost in this movie. The horribly gruesome deaths -- feeding them to feral rats in the caves, throwing victims from balconies, emasculating them while they are tied up -- make The Iceman such a horrific killer. But its completely missing here. In fact, you could just swap out ANY generic mafia hitman that has been in any gangster movie with Shannon's character and it really wouldn't make any difference. The result is such a bland movie -- nothing you haven't seen before.

Furthermore, Ray Liotta's role as Roy DeMeo -- who was also a very vicious, odd and unique killer -- omits so much, and again, he's just any generic high-ranking wiseguy. There's not even any mention of the Gemini Lounge (the Gemini Method is incorrectly attributed to Pronge, who also was completely mis-characterized in the blandest, boring way).

Carlo's book (based on Kuklinski's recounting before he died) is highly suspect in areas, especially Richard's involvement in virtually all of the major mafia hits (Galante, Castellano, etc)... but it DID make for a backdrop of Mafia history that The Iceman carved his own bloody niche into.

But this movie just ignores 90% of the book and relies instead of old, tired gangster cliches, and takes away the graphic nature of the Iceman's handiwork in favor of the same, tame, tired and relatively boring conventional gun murders you see in any other gangster movie.

In short, it's lazy, it's by-the-numbers, and completely misses the whole Iceman's story. Without exception, every character in this movie misses the mark of their real-life inspirations to the point that I wonder if the screenwriter even READ the book or even saw any of the HBO interviews.",1381881600,2,2142,4.854794520547945

5647532,3,B00BMIVK4E,"The trouble with biographical films is most people's lives make for unsatisfying stories. Such films usually feel incomplete. A story requires a beginning, middle, and end -- with the protagonist's story arc unified by some ""life lesson"" or theme. But real people's lives are not stories, but a series of disjointed and messy episodes.

With&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Doors/dp/B00005NB8K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Doors</a>, Oliver Stone tried to ""explain"" Jim Morrison's life by depicting it as Morrison's quest for death, sparked by his witnessing a car accident in his youth. It was an unsatisfactory explanation in a fascinating film.

Director Ariel Vromen's THE ICEMAN likewise fails to find a unifying theme for contract killer Richard Kuklinski's life. What lesson is to be learned from this film? Who was the Kuklinski? Why did he become a cold-blooded killer? There's a brief flashback showing him beaten by his father, but most victims of child abuse do not go on to murder over 100 people, so it's an unsatisfying explanation. I guess the best explanation is that Kuklinski was a psychopath. Which is a label rather than a cinematic story arc.

Ultimately, films like THE ICEMAN exist to satisfy the morbid curiosity of those wishing a safe peak at ""true crime."" It's also a painless way to get a brief history lesson, though filmmakers always alter the facts.

THE ICEMAN is an artfully made film. The 1960s, 1970s period sets and clothes look accurate. It's well acted. Michael Shannon comes across as, well, icy. The other gangsters are well portrayed. Winona Ryder is sympathetic in a smallish role as Kuklinski's wife.

I can't say I enjoyed THE ICEMAN, but it held my attention, the way a car accident might. Yet it left me emotionally unsatisfied, as biographical films often do.

5647545,3,B00BMIVK4E,"A few years ago I watched the HBO series that included the Iceman confessions of a killer (or something like that).

This guy was a monster, but an interesting monster, if that is possible.  There was 3 of those Iceman ""confessions on HBO and I always thought to myself this would probably make a good movie.

It turned out to make an ""OK"" movie.  I just don't think the movie captured the true personality of Kuklinski (sic).

In the HBO series Richard seemed more flippant....if I may.  He used some very interesting phrasing in his answers.  The kind of phrasing that movie people are looking for all the time to make their stories have more impact.

Anyway....it was worth the money.  I like Michael Shannon and the acting was great.  I do recomend this movie.  It was kinda fun.

P.S. I saw Shannon in person at Wrigley Field this year.  He was chosen to sing ""Take me out to the Ballgame"" during the seventh inning stretch.  He is nowhere as big as they make him look in the movies.  He sang pretty good, like he had singing lessons before.",1380758400,,1046,4.4603174603174605
5647546,4,B00BMIVK4E,"""Whilst seen as too simplistic and bland for a crime drama, The Iceman, I thought, was a fine starter in this genre and the film had an excellent performance from the new-and-upcoming Michael Shannon playing Richard Kuklinski and another from Winona Ryder playing his not-knowing wife. The film left a very cold and unsettling impression especially knowing that his secrecy and his lack of control only made matters worse for him when he got with the mob and after an abusive childhood.

Kuklinski, or known as Polack by the mob, was never really caring as he so claimed for his family and his actions dramatised on screen are shocking, sustained, and ultimately unsuccessful when people turned against him. There are so many scenes in the film that are equally gripping, disturbingly violent, and surprising to watch especially when his brother played by Stephen Dorff is in prison and calls out on Richard that he shouldn't make the same mistake. Much of his violent, impulsive temper translates to many scenes that involve him destroying property in his house, killing his enemies when present, and driving with anger against a car he crashed in due to being distracted. His actions almost show that there is no escape and the cinematography, performances (including a surprise cameo from James Franco), and televisual editing remind you of a 90s film complements it.

While a tough watch by all means (definitely not suitable for a BBFC 15 certificate) and an ambiguous ending, The Iceman is one of the most well-performed crime dramas you'll see this year and its acknowledgment from Toronto and Venice film festivals are supportive of that. While never on my radar but under recommendation from some friends, I'm glad I've seen it.""",1380672000,,1738,5.010380622837371
5647547,4,B00BMIVK4E,I enjoyed the movie did not like that they changed things like he had two children when he actually had three but they were very spot on with his actual character,1380672000,,162,4.258064516129032
5647548,4,B00BMIVK4E,"Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.

In every actor's career there comes a role that becomes a defining moment for them. Regardless of whether or not the film is good, their performance shows just how well they can act in any situation. After watching The Iceman, I believe wholeheartedly that this is that role for Michael Shannon. Now Shannon's always been a solid actor in my book. With the exception of Premium Rush, every performance I've seen from him has felt really smooth and natural. Not all of them were groundbreaking, but you could tell that he really gets into character. And that's exactly what he did in The Iceman as he stepped into the shoes of Richard Kuklinski and ran with it.

For those of you uninformed -- I know I was -- Richard Kuklinski (aka The Iceman) was a contract killer. Before that, though, Kuklinski worked in the porn business. More specifically, he dubbed porn tapes which were then distributed by the Gambino crime family. However, one day Roy DeMeo (Ray Liotta) informs Kuklinski that they were shutting the place down, leaving him without a job. Roy then offers him the job of killer-for-hire and Richard, worried about his future with his wife Deborah (Winona Ryder), accepts.

As the story progresses we see glimpses of Richard doing his dirty work -- stabbing people in the parking lot, choking them on rooftops, etc. This is where The Iceman earns its R rating. However, these brutal killings never seem tacked on or out of place. On the contrary, they were almost essential in that it showed just how crazy this man's life really was. He would go to ""work"" like anyone else, kill someone, and come home to dinner with his family. It doesn't stop there, though. This double life is illustrated even more when he goes out to dinner with his friends. He not only has his wife convinced, but he has a huge lie prepared when asked about his occupation. It was all very eerie to witness.

Now one of The Iceman's biggest shortcomings comes in the storytelling department. Upon being introduced to Richard, it didn't take long before I became fascinated with him. Unfortunately, while the movie has an intriguing story to tell, it doesn't tell it extremely well. Because of this, at times it felt like I was limited to the information I was receiving. In the first act of the film we see that Richard has a temper, but beyond one or two quick flashbacks later on they don't do much to explain why. We're supposed to assume it was due to childhood abuse, but I would have liked to see his past fleshed out a little more.

Another thing that irritated me was the portrayal of Kuklinski's family. In reality his family is said to have been oblivious to what he did, but everyone -- especially Deborah -- always seemed on edge. They were always quick to think the worst even when they had no idea what was going on. For example, there's a point in the story where one of his daughters ends up in the hospital. As Richard goes to put his hand over hers, his wife goes ballistic and screams at him. Almost as if she knows it's the result of his lifestyle. It just didn't add up to me given the knowledge that they were unaware of what he was really doing.

What really held this film together, though, was the performance given by Michael Shannon. Very early on we get a glimpse of Richard's temper and, aside from a few standout roles, I have never been more convinced by an actor's performance in my life. The only word I can use to describe it is menacing. There were times where I literally found myself intimidated by Richard as a human being. Part of it was because I knew this story was based on reality, but a bigger part of it was the result of how real Michael Shannon made him feel. It was almost as if I could reach through the screen and physically touch him. It was just a very gripping performance that's bound to leave an impression on anyone who watches the movie.

Unfortunately, none of the other performers were able to replicate that sense of reality. Chris Evans was ok as Mr. Freezy and Ray Liotta was decent as well. My only complaint with Liotta is that we've seen this character from him before. I would really like to see him expand beyond this mobster corner he's painted himself into. Everyone else, on the other hand, felt really flat in comparison to Shannon. To some extent I think it's partially due to the fact that everyone else seemed more like an extra when all the spotlight was, understandably, put on Richard Kuklinski. Either way, that's no excuse for the rest of the cast to give unengaging performances.

Overall Score: 7.25/10 - I'll admit that I was expecting something slightly different, but The Iceman didn't fail to entertain. Richard Kuklinski is a very interesting character and, if anything, you'll definitely be left intrigued by his life. If they would have allowed themselves a longer running time I think they could have fleshed out the story a little more, but it's still very enjoyable and most of that is due to Shannon's jaw dropping performance.",1380499200,,5052,4.618040089086859

THE ICEMAN was one of those films where, seeing the preview, I thought, ""I HAVE to see that, ASAP!"" I was not disappointed in the film itself. The acting is good --Ryder in particular really shines--and the filming is even better. THE ICEMAN captures the 60s and 70s very well. It's tense and gripping, with a number of small twists and surprises (even though there are not a lot of really big ones).

Still, this film seems to be missing a piece or two, and something more is needed. That something is probably more in the way of a beginning: THE ICEMAN is mostly middle and end. More back-story on Richard Kuklinski's early life would have provided more complete development of his character.

Another issue may simply be the true story on which this film is based. It's interesting to learn the story of a less-publicized mass murderer, but, crass as it may sound, the fact that Kuklinski was a contract killer whose victims were mostly violent criminals themselves takes away a lot of the morbid fascination we find in serial killers such as Henry Lee Lucas or Ted Bundy, who murdered just for the thrill of it.

I dunno, but some other reviewers have stated that the real-life Richard Kuklinski, unlike the one shown in this film, could not have cared less about his own family, would kill ANYone that got in his way, etc. Assuming that's the case, it might have made for a better film if they'd not tried to make such a noble villain out of the man and shown him as the psychopathic monster that he actually was.",1379894400,,1531,4.556363636363637

The film makes credible the notion that the wife and children had no idea what this guy did for a living.  Family talk avoided business discussions even more than sub prime mortgage lenders probably do.
One way to humanize a character is to find a redeeming quality.  Viewers might decide that the iceman's family life is such a quality, or whether he engineered for himself a living arrangement that was the best he could do.

My sense is that while petty criminals and Mafiosi cleanups were tolerated by the police, this law enforcement officer's assassination rightly brought down greater scrutiny upon Richard Kuklinski. Anyway, truth IS stranger than fiction, and, in this depiction of Kuklinski's murderous side, his actions become almost tedious. There is also too much of an emphasis upon Kuklinski's supposed Jekyll and Hyde personas. Apparently, in real life, the Ice Man was often a difficult, if not abusive, husband and parent, not a tender, lighthearted, doting spouse and father.

5647602,3,B00BMIVK4E,"Biographical movies have always provided entertainment to film going fans for years. At the same time more often than not their portrayals of those their stories are about rarely reflects the reality of the person. While this is the case with the new release THE ICEMAN perhaps it's best to write about it as a film rather than history. That being said, this is a dynamite crime drama for fans of the genre.

Michael Shannon stars as Richard ""Richie"" Kuklinski, a low level criminal making film copies of porno flicks back in the 60s whose life changes when he meets Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta). Married with one child, Kuklinski's lack of fear in the face of a danger makes Demeo consider him a possibility for an enforcer's position. When he has Richie kill a bum just to show him he can kill without conscience, the position becomes his.

What follows is three decades of Richie doing what he's best at which is killing people. When Demeo has someone who needs to be reminded to pay his debts, he sends Richie. If they don't follow through, Richie returns and the problem is erased. Soon people have good reason to make sure they pay on time.

While doing one hit for Demeo, Richie runs into ""Mr. Freezy"" (Chris Evans), another hit man so named because he also drives an ice cream truck from neighborhood to neighborhood. Not only does this make for a great cover but the freezer inside the truck is a convenient place to store a dead body.

As the story progresses problems come up and Demeo tells Richie to take a break, stop killing people and not to take any work on the side. With bills piling up Richie finds himself forced to break that promise, contacts Mr. Freezy and the duo begin piling up bodies and cash for contracts.

When Demeo discovers this he threatens Richie and things begin to unwind for the hired gun. A combination of paranoia, real threats and a violent rage fueled temper that Richie always tries to keep in check will not result in anything positive. But just what happens and who it happens to is yet to be seen.

Michael Shannon has become a force to behold in films these days. It's not just his physical presence that exudes danger here but the performance offers a depth of character movies like this usually don't possess. Liotta seems to have calmed down in recent films as he does here but one can't help but see the same intensity in Shannon that Liotta once brought to similar roles. Winona Ryder, long missing from movies, turns in a great performance as well as Deborah, Richie's wife and true love.

What is depicted here is the tale of a man who wants what's best for his family, to provide for them as much as possible and who is willing to do anything to insure that their every dream is fulfilled. The movie presents Kuklinski as a sympathetic character that we wish could find an escape from the world he has chosen to be with his family. Unfortunately that wasn't the reality of the Richard Kuklinski. The movie may make for a great story and well made film, but it does so by changing most of the true story into something else.

While an afterward mentions that Kuklinski is estimated to have killed 100 people before the ending presented here it rarely discusses his victims. I could be wrong but I also don't think most of us would decide that the best way to provide for our families would be to begin killing people which here is presented as Kuklinski's best option. More changes between his real story as told in the book THE ICEMAN: THE TRUE STORY OF A COLD BLOODED KILL by Anthony Bruno and what we're presented with here are best left to those interested in the book. If all you see is the film you will be entertained. But the real story is just as interesting.",1378944000,,3717,4.512630014858841
5647603,4,B00BMIVK4E,"The film is based on the true life story of hitman Richard Kuklinski (Michael Shannon). Richard starts out making copies of porno films for the mob when Roy Demeo (Ray Liotta) recognizes his talent and turns him into a hitman. The story goes that his family didn't know anything about his hitman life, most likely made up by their attorney. It is said he killed over 100 men, although we only get the main hits. A montage of hits done to some good background music would have given us a better feel for his notoriety. One story is that Kuklinski killed Hoffa. The film avoids that controversy.

The film is gritty, but doesn't offer the action of a fictional production. Richard lived a quiet life and didn't flaunt his wealth, a simple requirement for someone to be a long term hitman. By the end of the film, you start to sympathize with the Iceman. On the negative side, I was really expecting accents from the folks in New Jersey. Winona Ryder sounded more like she was from Ohio, as did most of the cast.

5647621,3,B00BMIVK4E,"My review is a bit bias I must admit first and foremost.  I have watched the interviews with the real Richard Kuklinski multiple times.  I have a fascination with psychological conditions and a cold blooded killer is one that is worth exploring for my own personal interests.  To see what drives the person to do what they do is very intriguing to me.  Having watched the Kuklinski interviews I figured the movie would be a great way to see what he talks about in action rather than just using your imagination.

The movie itself is quite good.  The only major problem I had with it was the fact that it would have been better off as a mini series or a multi part movie like ""Che.""  This would be able to separate the decades when Kuklinski was active far better than 105 minutes total.  However, I do feel this is the best adaptation of the life of Kuklinski during this time frame.  Its very difficult I would imagine as a director to compress that much data into the time frame allotted.  The problem you are running into is the same with the film adaptation of ""Akira.""  Six graphic novels reduced to approximately 2+ hours of film won't give you the complete experience.  The film does a good job of keeping track of the time until about half way through the flick where it suddenly stops listing what time frame you are in which can jar you a bit.  You have to decide based on the way Michael Shannon looks to determine the approximate time frame.

The Good:
-Excellent Casting.  Michael Shannon is pitch perfect as Kuklinski.  If they ever make another movie based on the ""Hitman"" game franchise they should get him to play Agent 47.  The supporting cast is quite good as well.  James Franco has the oddest part as he is only in it for a few minutes.  Chris Evans is fantastic.
-The soundtrack fits well with the time and makes sense.
-The weapons and methods Kukliski used are almost perfect save the fact that he would use cyanide in drinks and drop them on people rather than in spray bottle.
-Very accurate cars and clothing really match the time frames in the movie.  Its very good to see no modern items in the scenes which definitely helps with the historical accuracy of the film.

The Bad:
-The blu-ray transfer has a filter on it that makes the blacks not appear as black as they should be and this is not due to contrast adjustments on my set.  This is basic quality control that wasn't quite up to par.
-If you know the interviews then you know some of the facts are a bit different from what actually happened.
-9/9 Update.  After watching the movie a second time its quite disturbing the writers didn't include much on his motivation. If you don't know his history, you have to speculate on why he is doing what he is doing.  They did make reference to some of his abusive past but not enough to even begin to explain how bad he had it and how his childhood affected his psychological make up.
-The worst of it as I mentioned was the running time of the film.  There are a lot of kills that don't make sense because they are in a montage fashion.  You have no idea why he is killing certain folks and it can be really confusing.  You don't need to know every detail of why he is killing someone but a montage is not what I was looking for.  This also causes a problem because you don't feel sorry for any of the characters by the film's end.

Conclusion:
Its a good flick.  Don't get me wrong.  Just remember that they do pay a lot of homage to the person that inspired the flick and its seen everywhere.  Time constraints must have put the strain on the overall experience.  I was personally hoping this would usurp my favorite hitman flick which is ""Collateral.""  It didn't and its kind of sad given that this person actually lived.",1378512000,3,3755,4.402031930333817

5647623,5,B00BMIVK4E,I have been in Law Enforcement for almost 20 years and have studied a lot on Richard Kuklinski and I was excited to see that they had made a movie about this subject. First of all Michael Shannon was excellent as The Iceman you could tell that he did his homework when it came to the portrayal of this man. The movie is seasoned with a all star cast and all of the actors and actresses are outstanding in there roles. The story covers the story of Richard Kuklinski a hired killer for over 30 years in the Mob world and he was believed to have murdered over 100 people for money. If you really want to see the real thing when it comes to Mafia crime related movies you cant do wrong with this picture . The fact that its is based on a true story and actual criminal activities makes this a must see for all crime buffs. ENJOY!!,1378425600,3,827,4.142857142857143
5647624,3,B00BMIVK4E,"There are some lives that don't require reflection in the form of film and surely the true life of professional murderer (100 killings) Richard Kuklinski is one of them. But because biographies have been written about him (Anthony Bruno's ""The Iceman: The True Story of a Cold-Blooded Killer"" and James Thebaut's documentary ""The Iceman Tapes: Conversations with a Killer""), it became a sure thing that we would have to actually watch this life on the screen (as written by Morgan Land  and director Ariel Vromen). It is disconcerting to view except for the actors who take on these rather unrewarding parts.

The film opens and closes with the imprisoned Kuklinski (Michael Shannon) starring at us but quick jumps back in time to the1960s with a very different Kuklinski trying to make coffee conversation with the sweet Deborah (Winona Ryder) who eventually becomes his wife and the mother of their children - a life that is sacrosanct to Kuklinski. Kuklinski is working as a porn film lab tech until his mob bosses (Ray Liotta, David Schwimmer et al) persuade him to change his career into that of a contract killer. For years, Kuklinski gains a reputation for cold-blooded professionalism who tends to freeze his murdered victims even as he raises a family who are kept in the dark about his true career. Unfortunately, mob politics ultimately forces him to secretly work independently with the psychopathic Robert 'Mr. Freezy' Pronge (Chris Evans). As much as Kuklinski tries to keep his lives separate, circumstances and his own weaknesses threaten a terrible collision as the consequences of his choices finally catch up to him. Among those actors who get killed almost as soon as they get on the screen is James Franco. Kuklinski is finally caught by the police (through a double cross maneuver) and is sentence to life in prison in the same cell with his brother Joey (Stephen Dorff).

It is a strong cast but a very plodding script that burns out after about 45 minutes. Were it not for the cast, the final judgment of the film would be dyspeptic. Grady Harp, September 13",1378425600,,2082,4.8923512747875355

5647629,5,B00BMIVK4E,"Ever since people have been telling stories, audiences have been interested in bad guys, but it seems like the past decade or so has shown a really strong increase in the amount of entertainment that seems centered on what might be called Bad Guys. It started with the Sopranos, and has exploded into everything from Breaking Bad to Dexter to even, arguably, Mad Men and It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. Granted, those are just the ones I like. But even with the high-caliber hitters in that list, very rarely has a full-on dead stare at a Bad Guy been as engaging and as disturbing as this film.

Perhaps that's because it's based on a true story about Richard Kuklinski, a (generally) free-lanced contract killer from New Jersey who not only had a death toll north of 100, but also lived a placid family life with a young wife and two beautiful daughters. The dichotomy of those two worlds never feels forced or contrived, and a lot of it has to do with both the script and Michael Shannon's incredible performance. There is the very tangible sense that Richard was born (perhaps bred) with a gaping void inside of him; that the crystalline part that makes us all empathetic to other humans was somehow shattered very early on and lost ... except for one, tiny shard. Michael Shannon, at first, doesn't appear to do a lot of actual acting. He lets the weight of his face hang in one cold, stony, inscrutable slab for the first third of the film. But when he is with his family and when that world begins to become precarious, Shannon somehow allows us just the briefest of flashes from that deeply buried shard of crystal, and the moments are powerful for their rarity, brevity, and hopelessness.

For a film that deals with mobsters, you have some experienced talent (Robert Davi, and Liotta can't seem NOT to be in a mob/dirty cop movie these days), as well as some surprises (Schwimmer, Franco, and I had no clue I was looking at Chris Evans until the credits rolled). The pacing may be slow for some, but only for as long as it takes for you to invest yourself in our lead. Some might also find the movie disturbing, although there's less graphic violence here than I've seen in many other movies of this ilk. Perhaps what might be most disturbing to people is the idea that such a subtle division between evil and love could be hidden for so long from so many, but that's a very clear reality. And if modern entertainments have found ways to make us root for or even sympathize with and enjoy watching the Ways and Whys of Bad Guys, this movie takes a far starker approach and -- without ever giving us a good reason to love or sympathize with Richard -- it shows us just how desperate, fascinating and unknowable true, real-life bad guys can be.",1378339200,,2755,4.55241935483871

5647637,5,B00BMIVK4E,"When you watch a film that has David Schwimmer in it, and his performance is really good, there are only two possibilities:  you are dreaming, or you're watching a really good movie that has a really good director.  And I don't think that I was dreaming this morning since I woke up pretty early.

Oh, I've always thought that he was a really good director though; catch ""Trust"" if you disagree with me.  But I've always thought that he was a subpar actor, at least until now; I hated his character on ""Friends.""  But I think that maybe I've changed my mind, as his performance here -- granted, only a little bit more than a cameo -- is pretty terrific.  I'm actually looking forward to more of his performances now to see if this was simply a one-off, or if he's truly onto something at this point in his career.

But this film is really strong because of its cast.  Everyone's really good, especially the male lead, Michael Shannon.  He just nails it here as ""The Iceman,"" as he's always cooler than a cucumber but still oddly a sympathetic character, especially for being a total anti-hero.  In my opinion, he's better than James Gandolfini in ""The Sopranos,"" and no, it's not too soon, even though Mr. Gandolfini was very good.  It's just that Mr. Shannon is far more believable to me as a bad guy than most that I've ever seen on screen.

The one misfire:  Winona Ryder.  Now, I've always been at least a mild fan of her work, and I think that she's a very nice actress.  But her ""Joysey accent"" just didn't work in this film, and I believe that it was a requirement that it did.  Too bad, because she plays the part well, other than that.  And Ray Liotta, who was borderline lame in ""River Murders,"" seems to even return to his old acting form here.  He's pretty terrific too.

But while acting is important, I believe that movies like this live or die by the screenplay.  If the writing is bad, it will be put out of it's misery quickly with one gunshot to the head.  But the dialog here is really believable; people say things that you would expect them to say, under the circumstances, and so it was allowed to live another day.

I've been watching the show ""Evil, I"" lately on the ID network, and right now, it's one of my favorite shows.  It approaches killers from their first person perspectives, and I think that it almost always works.  While I'd heard of ""The Iceman"" before that show, I saw an episode that featured him, and it really made me want to see this film.  And I am glad that I followed through.  While it's hard to call ""The Iceman"" a serial killer per se -- serial killers usually kill for simply their own ""pleasure"" while Richard Kuklinski killed because, as he would probably say, ""I was just taking care of business"" -- he was definitely one of the worst contract killers ever.

This film is probably more of a 4.5 to me, but I'm rounding up today.  After all, I don't want any of these bad guys to read my review, get mad, and come after my family.  To them I would say, ""Yeah, I really liked it!  You were great!""  But then again I wouldn't be lying to save my skin.",1378166400,,3101,4.368881118881119
5647638,4,B00BMIVK4E,"Richard Leonard Kuklinski was the kind of guy you don't mess with.

With a 6'5 frame, wide as well as tall, and a terrifying Fu Manchu mustache, Kuklinski cut a damn imposing figure. He had an explosive, horrific temper, prone to devastating violent outbursts. If Kuklinski was to be believed, then he killed almost 125 people, often at the behest of ruthless and dangerous Mafioso crime lords. He shot them, stabbed them, left them to be eaten by rats, strangled them, poisoned them, and according to one of his most chilling recollections, ""beat them to death just for the exercise."" But he was also a doting father and family man, and a loving, devoted, if somewhat obsessive husband.

...

Truth is infinitely stranger than fiction, and Richard Kuklinski's sad, dark story is one of the strangest stories out there. He himself was a compelling, impressive character, far more dangerous and chilling than anything Thomas Harris or Mo Hayder could hope to invent. So who better to portray him than one of the most talented and electrifying actors of his generation,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Michael-Shannon/dp/B006PGL7OQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Michael Shannon</a>?

Shannon's performance is indeed the high point of the film. No blood flows through his veins, just cold ice water. Hard and chillingly removed, Shannon masters the hitman side of him that was of such great use to the DeCavalcante family and numerous loan sharks in the 70's and 80's. He is also believable as the devoted father of three. Shannon's performance as Richard Kuklinski is hardhitting and absolutely riveting. His performance alone is enough to recommend The Iceman to fans of crime drama and gritty, dark, violent character pieces.

When you add to that Winona Ryder's subtle performance as Kuklinski's wife Deborah, Chris Evans unrecognizable role as fellow hitman Mr. Freezy, Ray Liotta being threatening and going all Goodfellas on us as crime lord Roy Demeo, and James Franco and David Schwimmer's short but scene-stealing roles, you have a fine cast that elevates the sub-quality material they are given.

Because the saddest thing about The Iceman is it's squandered potential. The screenplay has a lack of focus, deserving something more fully formed that would do justice to the strange dark tale of crime's most prolific hitman. The direction should be stronger and more confident, but the film's cinematography, costumes, and makeup are all excellent. On the whole, I reccomend The Iceman mainly because of Michael Shannon's astonishing performance in the title role, and the standout performances of the supporting cast. While Kuklinski deserved better treatment, this is a riveting, gritty, dark, and compelling look at one of history's most disturbing and electrifying criminals. My rating?

He is a devoted husband and father who would do anything for him family. As far as his family knows he went from making Disney movies to currency exchange. He is a great provider and great person. The truth is something Richard hides from him family. He is one of the most notorious contract killer's in history and kills with no remorse or feeling toward his victim. He is the Iceman. I am a huge fan of mafia type movies. While this isn't really a mafia type movie it has the feel of a Goodfellas-esque movie. The movie is violent and shows killings but it's not really that graphic which helps the movie by not taking you out of the emotion by showing someones head explode. While I wouldn't call this a modern classic that should be watched over and over like Goodfellas or Scarface I do think that it very much worth watching and I did enjoy it.

This is an intense film shot against the backdrop of polyester-suited 1970's-1980's New York. It's about a soft-spoken family man who took his job, which happened to be contract killing, very, very seriously.

This a man to fear, and this movie makes you feel it. Especially how easy he switches from family man to Grim Reaper faster than you can pull a trigger. It takes you through his killings, step by step, by gun, knife, poison, strangling, crossbow, among others, while showing the life he led as a husband and loving father. It is this contrast that makes you feel just how cold-blooded he was.

Also, there is a scene in a disco that is just wild. A must see.

8570825,2,B00BMIVK4E,"I watched the 3 HBO interviews with Richard Kuklinski right before watching this film, so I was extremely disappointed to see that the script gave the usual Hollywood spin to a story, rather than presenting the real story.  Kuklinski, by his own admission, started killing at an early age, long before he did it for money, in that he was a stone-cold psychopath, killing anyone who insulted him, dissed him, or otherwise made him angry.  There is no way that Kuklinski would have been pushed around as depicted in the film, or had his family threatened by Demeo and not taken immediate action.  In the HBO interviews he tells of killing a man just for making a threat to his family.  Nobody ever came to his house to threaten him  or ran down his daughter. If they had, the person responsible certainly would not have lived long.  Pure Hollywood bunk.  Although I liked Michael Shannon's work, when I saw the HBO interviews, the actor I thought of to best play the part was Vincent D'Onofrio.  Kuklinski sounded so much like D'Onofrio in the first interview, that it could have been him.  Granted it would have taken a long movie to depict all of Kuklinski's killings, but the movie seems to miss entirely his psychopathic nature, i.e. not the ordinary hit man for the mafia.",1525478400,,1275,4.65625

8570828,2,B00BMIVK4E,"I feel this was one of those ultra disturbing documentaries that i really seem to miss the significance leading it to the campy category. The accounts are interesting in that the family life vs killer life is a good example of the split personality psychopath. Even though he was a hired killer he is still a psychopath in my eyes.
After a while it just becomes pointless violence. Just like endless sequels to Saw it makes you wonder what the artistic point is after awhile.",1522454400,,475,4.6
8570829,5,B00BMIVK4E,"This is a great movie if you like the mobster kind of thing.  I have read the book and watched the TV documentary/interviews as well.  Not that I condone or want to glamorize killing, but Richard Kuklinski is one of the most interesting people I have ever seen.  The movie was well acted and written and I found it entertaining from start to finish.",1520985600,,349,4.421875
8570830,5,B00BMIVK4E,"This is a superbly done movie.

Michael Shannon does an amazing job as the lead.

The movie is violent. and Michael's character, is unapologetic in his job as a mob enforcer.  As he admits, it is what he is good at.",1519948800,3,215,4.195121951219512
