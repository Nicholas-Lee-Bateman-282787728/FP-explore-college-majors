I have quit smoking due to Tae-Bo and feel 1000% better than  I ever have in my entire life.  The infomercial's talk isn't even half way  what Tae-Bo really is.  It's the best pound for pound workout that I've  ever done.,918518400,,380,3.973333333333333

1001770,5,6305242143,"I bought this vhs originally in 1998 and used it religiously for 7 years, 3 times a week along with jogging, yoga and Pilates. I was in the best shape of my life and in my 40's.

i moved on to other billy blanks workouts like ""celebrity"", ""bootcamp"" ""cardio"" etc, (feeding my need for speed), had an injury in  2008, and got quite soft in the core. i have not used the basic tape in years.
With injury finally healed (5 years later), i dusted off the vhr player this morning and popped it in and guess what? WHAT A GREAT WORKOUT!  it's good cardio for those who haven't worked out in years and a good fat burner tape for those in better shape. not too extreme and not too mild. even the 90's workout music is good on it- a little campy to be honest. back to the basics. one caveat: if you're really into moving fast, this tape is not for you. try the celebrity sculpt (the music is jammin' on that one).",1390521600,2,903,4.148571428571429

1001840,5,6305242143,"Honestly these videos work great and will really help you get in shape.

The first VHS, the blue one is just an instructional.  You only watch it once, or again if you haven't done your Tae Bo in a long time.

The second VHS is the work out.  It's about 28 minutes long, eases you in from easy to challenging, and just when you think you can't do any more it ends.  It is very engaging and Billy, the lead man, has done a great job selling his production as if he is actually talking to you personally, as well as giving you options to continue the workout but take it a little slower.

I did this VHS about 5 days in a row, and by day 3 I felt as if I had been lifting weights at the gym.  I saw my legs become more toned and began to see abdominal muscles and its totally crazy because theirs no resistance, just aerobic exercise!

I would strongly recommend these VHS to anyone, from someone who has indulged too much and needs to thin up or to a honed athlete who is looking for a small daily challenge.",1365120000,6,1007,4.0761421319796955

1001842,5,6305242143,"This a an OLD Tae-Bo workout I did years ago.  The instructional video teaches each move separately.  The workout puts all the moves together.

I've tried Biggest loser, Jillian, Denise, and multiple other workouts but I never get that satisfied feeling like I do with this VHS. This Workout still kicks my butt and I'm 22 now lol.

1001845,5,6305242143,"I am 58. From the ages of 44 through 47 I taeboed six days a week. I was doing the advanced for the last year... then I faded. Then I stopped. Then I got up to 300+ pounds. Then I worked off 140 pounds of excess fat with strength training, treadmill, bicycle, brain reprogramming.... weather gets bad and I gave the regular taebo a try, thrilled that I remembered it so well, felt great, but a little too easy.  The next day I did the advanced, felt a healthy soreness all over the next morning, but nothing pulled or strained anywhere. So I'm doing that and I decide it's time for a black Friday kinect game and work out.  I got the ""Your Shape Fitness Evolved....."" and that's when I got hurt.  There's no boiling the frog slowly with it. If you don't squat absolutely deep as the trainer does first time and every time, it doesn't count the move and you keep going.  ""Your shape Fitness Evolved"" literally hurt me, I'm now stove up for at least three days with a swollen knee and a nearly immobile shoulder.  And here's the funny part, taebo works up a sweat... unlike the painful Your shape kinect game. It was slower than Moses.... it was boring and damaging, where as taebo is exciting, strengthening, can be kinda hard and yet is not hard on  your joints at all.

One more thing, no matter how well  you do if it's not perfect she says things like ""that's not quite what we were looking for was it"" and before I quit using the game, I pretty much hated her.  I see her as an inexpensive alternative to getting married to a nagging wife... no matter what you do, she's gotta give you a dig about how it coulda been better.  I was like ""shut up! This is my first day! If I'm perfect the first day the work out is never going to challenge me.

So I'm hoping Billy Blanks will read this review and consider making a Billy Blanks Kinect game.  Because I know HIS Kinect game won't hurt me and it will get my heart rate up and keep it up for the workout. Oh Hurry! And please, let it keep track of our calories burned for each day and a running total. Please, Billy, play the other kinect work out games, see what they're doing wrong and then you come in and obliterate the competition. My body's response to Billy Blanks workouts and to ""Your Shape Fitness Evolved"" (Amazingly approved by both Men's Health and Women's Health magazines) has proven to me beyond a shadow of a doubt - you, Billy - are the master.",1322956800,,2413,4.290748898678414
1001846,5,6305242143,"I love this dvd. I use it almost daily. The workout is short and has a good warm up and cool down. The video itself is a bit grainy, but i think it was converted from vhs to dvd. I still like it a lot.",1320883200,,201,3.488888888888889

I did Tae-Bo many, many years ago and I bought this video to try and get back into it. This is exactly what I needed. Billy is such a good instructor. He shows you exactly what muscles you need to be working and where to position yourself for each punch or kick. This video will never go out of style as long as people want to lose weight or stay in shape! Excellent video!! :-)",1314316800,,545,4.102803738317757
1001848,5,6305242143,"I've had this collection for years and always turn to it when I need to get back into shape.  Which, with my will-power is quite often.  But, this is a great set.  My advice to anyone who is new to it - 1st - sit down and watch the tapes.  Pay attention to what you can and can not do at this time.  Make a note of where you might need to adjust things to suit you.
Then, the 1st few times you run through them....make any needed adjustments, keep a pace that is a good for you and just allow yourself to settle into it.  Focus on quality, not quantity.
The very first time I did these, I got a little overwhelmed until a friend made that suggestion.  You will find in no time that you pick up as you go.  Things will get easier.  Now, I love them and find myself able to jump back fairly quickly no matter how long it has been since I worked out before.
The only things I'd wish for - a DVD copy and some kind of magic pill that will provide constant will power to keep on working out.
If you purchase these and give it a chance - you will enjoy them.  Then, if and when you are ready to push further, you can explore other tae bo collections or other types of workouts and vary things up.  It's a great starter collection for anyone whose never done tae bo or is new to working out and wants to do it in the privacy of their own home.",1308528000,2,1336,3.9477611940298507
1001849,3,6305242143,the basic tape goes dark and sometimes freeze up.  I will keep it because I can use the workouts to firm up my arms and so far that part of the tape works.,1308441600,,155,3.696969696969697
1001952,4,6305242143,I like this workout because it doesn't have alot of spinning around complicated manuevers like alot of womens workouts do. It gets you burning fat quickly and keeps you up there and doesn't have alot of annoying music and complicated steps like alot of tapes out there. The one thing that i wish they could have left out was the screaming blonde in the front. She does get on your nerves a bit. Try to focus on Billy and tune her out.,1298678400,,434,4.304878048780488

All the bar does is strain your shoulders and it takes the ""marshall arts"" out of Tae Bo.  The workouts are good but I do them without the bar and insert the boxing.  Other reviews said that their bar broke after a couple of uses.  Mine hasn't broken but it is worthless as far as I am concerned.

I think that it is a great workout for beginners like myself.  I do think that Billy Blanks probably should have done this video by himself.  The camera focused too much on the other people in the tape and not enough on him, so it is hard to see where he places his foot and how he twists his knees during jabs.  I hated that the camera was on one of the girls in particular that kept screaming, oh yeah.  After a couple of times, it drove me crazy.  All in all it was a good tape, even though I have to keep the volume turned down and look away from the tape.  oh yea!",1215216000,3,730,3.9115646258503403

1002067,5,6305242143,"I've been doing Yoga, Pilates and Weight Training for years. Tae Bo NEVER interested me at all!

My wife came home with a bunch of old Tae Bo's that she got at a garage sale. I thought that I'd never have any use for them.

Well, currently I've been preparing to do Tony Horton's DVD Bootcamp P90X. While I've been waiting for my shipment to come I've been preparing myself for it by doing different disciplines.

Knowing that Kenpo is one of the types of programs on P90X I figured that maybe Tae Bo would at least give me a ballpark idea of what a martial arts based workout might be like so I pulled out those Tae Bo Tapes.

Last Friday I did the ""Instructional"" program and found it really well done. Billy Blanks does a great job of explaining not only the moves but where you should be feeling them throughout your body. There is a definite overall emphasis on safely doing them as not to hurt the joints. Also, I had a really great time doing it which really surprised me!

Today (a week later) I did the ""Basic"" program and definitely found the ""Instructional"", even just one time doing it, prepared me for this actual workout (the instructional isn't a workout but is a great place to start if like me, you've never done anything like this).

The ""Basic"" program was a lot more intense that I thought it would be, I worked up quite a sweat and felt great after.

The only things I'd say to maybe be cautious of is that in the beginning warmups he does some neck movements a bit rapidly so for someone like myself with neck issues I would still do the warmups but move at a slower pace so you don't get hurt.

The other thing I wanted to mention is that in the ""Instructional"" program, it's not designed as a workout so not everything done on one side is done on the other. I started doing them on both side on my own so I'd at least get the feel for those.

 All in all, I was very impressed with Billy Blanks as a teacher and for how much of a real workout this was.",1169164800,9,1976,4.2175066312997345

I kept with the routine and after a couple of weeks was able to do all the reps. It still kicked my butt! I highly recommend this routine to tae bo first timers. I lost 15 pounds using this 20 minute workout (that's not including some of the stuff before the actual workout and after the workout) and simply watching what I ate. If I can do it, you can do it too. Warning: you may look like a frog kicking around when you're doing the alternating side kicks! ""laugh."" I so liked this routine I am now purchasing it on DVD.

Anyway, I started doing the basic Monday through Friday and let me tell you, within 3 weeks I changed my squishy [back] and thighs into sculpted thighs with NO cellulite and a beautiful [back] (not one line or lump or bump, smooth booty)it was a wonderful feeling to put on shorts or a bikini with so much pride and confidence.  My abs were like a washboard...I recently decided to start working out again and I was looking through old photos and came across a pic of myself in a bikini shot that I took on that island and then I said to myself TAE-BO!!!!  I have to laugh because I always refer to those days as my glory days and when people would ask how I did it I would say ""tae-bo basic"" and low carbs...anyway the point is that I know it works...trust me.  Needless to say, the tapes were borrowed and never returned to me and so after googling them, I found them on amazon and I purchased the basic tape and I am eagerly awaiting its arrival (I mean literally twiddling thumbs in excitement).  If you want a sculpted body and a relatively manageable (you can get throught it) workout tai-bo basic is for you.  I had bought the tae-bo live a couple years ago to get the same effect but I couldn't follow through it was too hard, I felt drained after, that's why I am endorsing the BASIC ORIGINAL tape because I was able to stick to it.  Anyway sorry for the long review but I just had to add my 2 cents.  For all the people out there, especially the ladies that are fighting to get back muscle tone and are not afraid of a sculpted cellulite free body, do tae-bo ORIGINAL BASIC workout and eat healhty meals limiting the food you know is crap and you will see results, well I did so it's worth a try.",1137110400,23,2033,4.168367346938775

Just recently I have been looking everywhere for this particular DVD and can only find his newer ones.  I bought a few and didn't really like them.  To many moves and steps.  I just wanted a DVD that was basic and gave me a good workout without me having to follow a whole buch of choreography.  I LUV THE BASIC!  In order for any of Billy Blanks DVDs to work for you, you have to get your whole body involved not just turning your legs and flipping your arms.

The workout is about the right length for a beginner (27 minutes). One thing that really bothers me is Billys odd, revealing and embarrassing outfit.

I've had back problems since 1992, and I'm fairly young, but 12 years later, I still have re-occuring back issues that occasionally temporarily disable me to the point that I have trouble moving around. I gain a lot of weight during these short periods, and a combination of Slim Fast, a temporary elimination of take-out, and Tae Bo, takes it right off.

The instrutional video is good - any time the people in the video are sweating as much as you are, it's a good sign. But I have to take a star off from Billy for bundling this as a legitimate exercise tape - the instructional doesn't have a real work out. You need the instructional, sure, but you're better off buying a four pack that includes the instructional, the 8 minute, the basic and the advanced. You'll barely use the initial video - though I think it could be used effectively as a teaser to get people to buy.

He counts off his moves at arbitrary times that have nothing to do with the beat or the phrasing, which is distracting and annoying if you have any rhythmic understanding.  If you don't care about music, then the moves do provide a tough workout, but if you're like me, you definitely need a rockin' beat to help push through.

I don't like being sweaty, I don't like being worn out, and I don't like being around people who do like those things.  Plus, I am just not the most physically coordinated person on earth.  I remember a soccer game in gym class, my sophomore year in high school, in which I tripped over my own feet four times.  Part of that was probably nervousness, but even now, nearly ten years later, I occasionally stumble into a doorway as I'm walking through it, even alone in my own apartment.  I could fall down and somehow miss the floor, I'm so clumsy.
You won't believe this--I can do Tae-Bo.
The moves are easy.  I mean, E A S Y.  It's an incredibly efficient system of very basic punches and kicks that truly do work the entire body.  I've been doing the Basic workout now for just under a month, and I can see muscle pairs developing that I have never seen on myself.  Not only that, but I can do this workout, every day, in my living room, without tripping myself up.  Or knocking anything over.  Or even stepping on my cat.

First, the  first rule in doing any exercise leading, is knowing your relative left and  right, by realizing the students are mirroring you. He uses the my left is  your left, which is confusing, since in a mirror, it is the oposite. So in  that sence, a beginner would have trouble.
I also notice he uses the  wrong phrasing for some punching moves. And there is not enough time spent  on cool down. The moves are not smooth in transition and not every body  part is used....my suggestion is to try the Kathy Smith Kick Boxing video,  and then watch this one...Kathy Smith is much more slower in developing the  moves,and spends more time in cool down and muscle toning. It is actually a  more demanding work out.
There are many Kick boxing videos on the market,  invest in one of those first before investing in this one and be your own  judge. Do not buy this one just because it had a slick marketing campaign,  this is not a video set for any beginner, and for that matter any seasoned  exercise video collector.

As for the  smoking, well, I was weak and used food as a crutch for the smokes.  I am  now paying the price but at least I'm not smoking.  So, this Tae Bo tape is  making a huge difference in my life.
I will agree that the music can  sometimes be irritating and it's difficult to hear Billy once in a while,  but over all I am very pleased.  I didn't buy the video to listen to the  music.  I purchased it to get the most out of the workout.
Buy this tape  if you really want to improve yourself from the ground up!  It's well worth  the money.",957312000,6,1263,4.032520325203252

Another thing I love is that billy tells you evreything and  he repeats the same thing over again in case you missed it or did not  understand it.

Two months after delivering, I pulled them out and popped them  into the VCR...WOW! I have done just about every exercise video out there,  Jane Fonda, Susan Powter, Reebok, you name it and I have probably tried it.  Taebo is terrific, and these tapes were a good introduction to taebo. I  used them for 3 weeks to help me get back into the exercise groove.  However, I really feel like they do not fully represent the taebo  technique. I learned a lot more about correct form when I purchased the  ""Live"" tapes and then started doing taebo tv through my dish. I  wouldn't recommend that you buy these particular tapes, but I give taebo  and Billy Blanks 5 stars. I have lost 10 pounds and 4 inches since  beginning in February.  Billy Blanks  inspires me to reach within myself  and put all my spirit and focus into my workouts. Please, please, do an  instructional video first before trying to do the regular workout. If you  pay attention and listen to what Billy says, this will keep you from  hurting yourself. I have a bad knee that precludes me from doing step  aerobics or Jazzercise, but I have never had any trouble with taebo. I am  sold on this workout folks!",956793600,48,1331,4.407407407407407

I could ""feel the burn"" better with this set of tapes than  with other typical workout tapes (which are honestly not my favorite way to  work out-which says a lot for these videos), and by various means of  kicking and arm punching, it is quite thorough.  It took me a little while  to be able to do all of the workout at one setting, which is a positive  asset--you will not tire of it quickly, and it will give you a goal to work  upon.  It is NOT hard whatsoever, if anything is is a highly enjoyable  workout that will not bore you with monotony, and Mr. Blanks is a very  encouraging, motivational instructor.",956361600,4,837,4.363636363636363

But the  first time we did Tae Bo, we must of kicked each other soo many times! lol  but you do get the hang of it, and it was fun too. It's a good work out..  but if you really want to benefit from it.. it's good to be by yourself..  because it's really easier to concentrate more..

This causes the class to stop when he stops and start again  when they realize the sequence is not done...not very flowing. He breaks a  cardinal rule of aerobic tapes...He doesn't allow the audience to mirror  his movements.  They watch him go to their right but he says left.  This  really messes up those right leg, left hand stretches that some students  never correct.  The music is not only poor but it is too loud.  In the  basic tape,it actually drowns out his instruction. One of the other things,  I found him to leave out a sequence of punches.  Rather than recut the tape  to streamline it, he adds it at the end...that's just tacky.  I've never  been one who embraced the idea of the teacher throwing in a tape and  letting the kids go , but I do see the potential for a lot of fun once I  have been through the tape with them several times.

He would teach everyone how to do a move or two, do the moves for a few beats, then tell us to keep going as he would start groping the on-screen female participants while describing their muscles.  I did not find it ""inspiring"" to watch Billy tell us to keep doing exercises while he stopped and took a moment to molest the on-screen women.

I am now approaching my seventh month of  doing Tae Bo an average of 3-4 times a week, and, at 36, I look better than  I ever have before.

After doing the Basic for a few weeks, I have the moves down and am better  able to concentrate on doing them correctly, rather than concentrate on  keeping up. Now, I really sweat.

I am not saying that it is a bad workout (anything other than sitting on your butt is good exercise), I just felt that the workout is not intense enough and the moves  are watered down from the fundamental of Muay Thai kickboxing.
 Many  moves that Billy showed lack the coordination that is required to throw  good, powerful punches and kicks (Billy should be very aware of this but he  understands that most of his potential students  don't have a background in  martial arts and its easier to teach them a watered-down version so they  won't get frustrated with their posture, and so they could concentration on  just punching and kicking as a workout).
 Without resistance of a  punching bag or pads and with limited moves, it is hard to get a full  workout that I was used to get in a boxing gym.  Many new boxing gyms have  a diverse group of students (some of these gyms have more women than men!)  and classes that is very similar to Billy's Tae Bo, but twice as  intense.
 For those of you who love Tae Bo and started to get in shape,  please do not stop there.  Head for more advanced kickboxing classes and  work harder.",924998400,2,1184,4.4392523364485985

I believe going fast can cause injury when the technique  is not mastered. I am a nurse and I also feel that there is not enough  attention on the pulse check and breathing technique - I often fear that  some people may push themselves too much just to keep up. My last negative  comment is that some of the instructors seem to socialize too much during  the class and as they are observing, they laugh! For those of us who are  struggling to improve our bodies, it is already a big step to go to the  class - we need all the support we can get. Billy is the expert at  motivating everyone. You truly feel empowered and motivated - as long as  you don't dwell on the perfection of the instructors. Watching them master  their bodies with movements of pure strength can frustrate those who are  weak and out of shape. As long as you stay focused on your own improvement  at your own pace, then you will be able to draw from Tae Bo the physical  and spiritual advantages made available by Billy. When ego gets in the way  - it all fails. Even those who are fit can become consumed in themselves.  This is seen as you wait in the long lines for each class (they are all  full) and watch the people fighting their way to the front of the line.  Personally, I prefer to be in the back of the class - near the water and  not surrounded by people. I have told so many about Tae Bo as I think Billy  has not only the right idea about physical strengthening, but, he also  knows from where the true strength comes. That is why people are drawn to  him and his gift. He reflects the results of drawing on a Higher Power and  that is something that the world truly needs.

I just wish all the  women who are using this tape and taking martial arts based aerobics would  try the real thing. Most cities and towns have some very good martial arts  instructors that can give you a workout equivalent to any  ""Tae-Bo"" tape and teach you the correct way to perform the kicks  and punches. I've been teaching martial arts for 20 years and believe me it  takes more than one simple lesson to teach a beginner to do a side kick  correctly and safely. BTW, a lot of aerobic instructors have no clue either  when teaching martial arts kicks. And I'm really disappointed in the  informercial at the women who claim that the techniques they learn in a Tae  Bo class will enable them to defend themselves. Well maybe they'll be in  better shape than their attackers and run faster.

I find that it motivates much  more when the music is active and, again, on count.  A major improvement  would be to remember that an instructor on video is like a mirror: when  Billy is teaching something that deals with the left leg, he should say  ""right leg"" to the audience.  When an aerobics instructor faces  the class, she (he) reverses the calls for this very reason. If everyone is  facing a mirror in class, this is unnecessary. Last, the intense movement  at the end of the Tai-Bo video abruptly ends.  Billy might consider easing  the class into the warm-up instead of so suddenly stopping.  All in all, he  has a great idea.

There is a sense of  reality, many different colors, shapes, and body types...all working hard  and they all seem to have great stomachs! Some of his instructors are are  also in the group and they're amazing to watch. You'll find yourself  feeling VERY GOOD, physically and mentally.

This is exercize for the Real World...you don't need the coordination  (or knees) of aerobics. You don't have to be in shape to start but you'll  improve FASTER than you can imagine. If you don't mind getting addicted to  something healthy, try Tae-Bo! (P.S.--The ""8-min."" tape is GREAT)",919296000,5,1582,5.125490196078432

If you want to get in shape take a real Kung Fu class and learn something useful while developing power, strength and  discipline. Tae-Bo, what a joke.",919123200,,249,4.413043478260869

7886478,5,6305242143,This is the only exercise program you need or will ever want. Billy Blanks did an awesome job when he invented this. It is fun and challenging and has everything. There have been many imitations through the years but this is still the best.  Combining moves from Tae Kwon Do and Kickboxing it will not only be great exercise but will also show you moves that will be effective in a self defense situation.,1484524800,2,405,4.472972972972973
