Fairly interesting story, with an unsatisfying ending. (Well...then what happened?)

Best part was imagining that meeting at Bills Gun Shop about filming (and we want use Bill as a character in it. He won't be all that nice and beats his wife...sound good?
Bill- ""SURE!""",1442793600,,361,4.73015873015873
8119837,4,B000FAOBZ0,"There is a reason that I am purchasing FOUR copies of this movie after watching it a few times.  It is a great movie for something that is lower budgeted and independent.  There was some good story writing in it as well as satisfactory acting. This movie does well to reveal more about the ""nice guy"" curse.",1320364800,2,307,4.368421052631579
8119838,1,B000FAOBZ0,"I can not belive a film like this was made. The writing was horrible and all of the characters fall into the the most blatant sterotypes. Gun hating libs will love this movie because it portrays EVERY gun owner as a loser, criminal or loaner. It is a dishonest movie...PERIOD. I hated it and I wish HOLLYWOOD would have the guts to make a movie about gun owners without falling back on the tired, untrue sterotypes.",1205280000,4,415,4.473684210526316
8119839,4,B000FAOBZ0,"Every time I take a chance on an independent film, I prepare for the worst, but this movie was a very pleasant surprise. First time director, Dean Hyers, delivers a very well made, entertaining tale of an isolated, needy, nerdy young man named Dillon McCarthy who seeks power and validation through gun ownership. As the story progresses, Dillon does indeed develop a stronger, more dynamic personality, but (unlike Travis Bickle  in Taxi Driver) never ceases to be a ""nice guy"". The metamorphosis is quite well presented and credible, as is the dramatic ending in which his ""crutch"" becomes a dangerous impediment that must be discarded.

Other than John Ashton, the cast was totally unfamiliar to me yet they all delivered excellent performances. The women are attractive and compelling in unconventional ways, the gang members and thugs are very convincing, and the situations depicted are completely plausible and at times quite scary. The music is truly excellent (particularly the opening and closing themes by Chan Poling), as is the photography (digital I believe) and direction. The DVD features a director's commentary that is quite illuminating and well done. It is impressive to see what truly talented people can produce on a limited budget, especially when compared to the hundred-million dollar flops from Hollywood ""biggies"".

I appreciated the fact that guns are neither demonized nor glorified in this movie. Unlike the simplistic pap that mainline Hollywood generally offers on this subject, the crimes and triumphs depicted are the product of individuals, not an inanimate tool. The producers and director do not use the movie to present their personal biases, but choose instead to let the viewer draw their own conclusions....a pleasant and welcome change (please see my review of ""Runaway Jury"" for an example of the opposite extreme).

Give this DVD a try. It is infinitely better than many other independent films I have viewed and I'm convinced that the director and some of the actors will move on to bigger things. I recall when Robert Rodriguez first released The Mariachi....you KNEW that the guy had talent. The same can be said about all involved in this surprisingly good movie.",1153008000,16,2211,5.167597765363128
8119840,5,B000FAOBZ0,"This is worth seeing if you like unique stories. It's about guns and the fantasy we all have with them. I wasn't sure what to think when we rented this, but we were pleasantly surprised. The characters were interesting and the story and subject matter were unexpected and compelling. I'd recommend it.",1152144000,7,301,4.8076923076923075
