3436588,5,B0019F02VW,"I was concerned that the series would run out of story lines and lose its ability to hold our interest and entertain.  Not to worry.  Season Two has been just as enjoyable to watch as the first season.  The story's are good.  The acting is first class.  We didn't wait to finish this set before ordering the next season.  In my opinion, this is one of the best programs from this period of television.",1396569600,,401,4.351351351351352

3436601,5,B0019F02VW,"I was two years old during Season 1, and in first grade for Season 4.  I wanted to see what I've been missing.  Talk about an all-star cast!!!  Robert Duvall, James Caan, Robert Marley(The guy who woke up with a horse's head in his bed in GF 1), Donna Douglas (Before Ellie Mae Clampett), Ed Asner, Liz Montgomery, Dick York, Lee Marvin, Robert Redford, Danno in Hawaii 5-0, Henry Silva, Peter Faulk, all the other Hollywood Icons got their start on the Untouchables!",1379548800,,467,4.602409638554217
3436602,5,B0019F02VW,The untouchables is something I grew up with on late night television. I thought it was gone for good but now I have the opportunity to have the entire collection. So once I've seen each episode from season 2 (I like to watch 1 episode a week. The way it was originally showed on television.) it's on to season 3.,1374451200,,313,4.233333333333333
3436603,5,B0019F02VW,"The one series that demonstrate a boundary-breaking vision on the design and build of crime-TV-drama. As such an example for all producers who are challenged to innovate.
I could not find an aspect I did not appreciate. From the cast to the haunting, unforgettable voice of the narrator it represents stunning quality.

I hope all seasons will be re-released",1361577600,,358,5.067796610169491
3436604,5,B0019F02VW,"Once again, Elliot Ness and his crimefighters manage to thwart (most) of the schemes of the Mob. One of things I liked about this set was the episode which looked at the power struggle within the organization following Capone's prison sentence and how the Mob began to turn to drugs following the end of Prohibition. This set is definitely more expensive but still worth it (although I would pay less if I could). Good acting by all concerned and the black and white format makes it better somehow. More appropriate, maybe.",1360713600,,523,4.758241758241758
3436605,5,B0019F02VW,I loved the show and have always been interested in the crime sprees and criminals of the 20's and 30's. I would recommend it to all cop show fans. I have the first four complete series and if more released plan to purchase them also.,1360368000,,234,4.222222222222222

3436610,4,B0019F02VW,"Have not seen all episodes yet, but the ones I have seen I have enjoyed the storylines, action, and actors. Well written. Will order a series at a time. Place it up against similiar modern series. Glad these DVDs were made available so younger audiences can view. My Dad requested that I get all of the volumes.",1296777600,,311,4.473684210526316
3436631,1,B0019F02VW,"Let me make this plain and simple. I refuse to buy half seasons of anything. I will wait and buy someones collection on Ebay for a REASONABLE price. Until then, I can live without half seasons. It's like buying a hot dog without the bun. If everyone thought like me they wouldn't pull this crap. Don't be an enabler.",1262908800,,316,4.372881355932203

3436634,5,B0019F02VW,"This series captures the whole feeling of this era. It shows a no nonsense to those who flout the law I just love the way Robert Stack looks with contempt at those he obviously despises. No actor can (or has been able) to do this. A series that is believable using the narration of Walter Winchell. A time in America's history,where this is so wonderfully portrayed",1233878400,,365,4.545454545454546

3436639,5,B0019F02VW,"The rest of the second season of ""The Untouchables"" is now out. The bloodbath continues. Check out ""The Lily Dallas Story"", about a fictional female mastermind who started out with real-life lowlife Legs Diamond (who got it earlier in the series). Over the top even for this show. Wonder if it drew complaints at the time.
--If anyone knows the name and/or composer of the eerie Oriental music used in the ""Mr. Moon"" episode, please respond.",1222732800,,441,4.815789473684211
3436640,5,B0019F02VW,"I have purchased all four of the DVD's for seasons 1 and 2 and they are all I'd hoped for and more. They bring back all the excitement from when they were first shown. A real fun part is seeing all of the future stars when they were much younger, using the show as a springboard for their careers (Lee Marvin, Telly Savales, Peter Falk, Charles Bronson, Elizabeth Montgomery etc.). The quality is excellent. If you liked the original series, I guarantee you'll love the DVDs. Worth every cent.",1222473600,,493,4.550561797752809
3436671,5,B0019F02VW,"I've collected all four collections so far, I know they are expensive but to me I think they are worth paying for. Robert Stack in particular is a delight. His portayal of the character is just right. He is electrifying. One thing I am desperately hoping for on a future DVD is the inclusion of 'This Is Your Life' episode of Robert Stack, they included his appearance in the Lucy show on the back of Season two Volume 1. so I think it would be a great and fitting tribute to him as the star of the show.",1221091200,,504,4.153061224489796
3436672,4,B0019F02VW,"I was very pleasantly surprised when I bought the first DVD disc a couple of years ago.  I had forgotten just how good of a series The Untouchables was when I saw it on repeats in the 70s and 80s.  Now I eagerly await the newest release every few months after watching each episode at least a couple of times.  After the first full two seasons, I have yet to watch one that I can call a bad episode.  There are just some episodes that are not as good as the others.  Which one is the best so far?  Hard to say, but if you like hard-core, tough-guy gangsterism, The Purple Gang is your best bet.

That being said, however, I have been perplexed by the sloppy restoration of the second season on DVD.  Whereas the first season had a crisp, even video quality in each episode, the second season has a very uneven video quality in most of the episodes.  Some of the scenes, especially the closeups, are crystal clear, while the more distant shots usually have some graininess and less focus.  This is bearable, but every so often, some of the scenes (usually brief reaction shots) are horrible quality, and they look like they were taken from tapes made on someone's video recorder in the 1980s. Some of the other reviewers have also mentioned that they think a minute or two are missing from the episodes this season.  What gives, Paramount?  Give a great show the great restoration on DVD that it deserves as you did for the first season.  Here's hoping that the next two seasons of The Untouchables on DVD are given the total loving care that they deserve.  Don't force us to call Frank Nitti.",1220572800,,1592,4.444827586206896
3436673,5,B0019F02VW,Come on all you whiners who love the show but complain about splitting it up into two seasons.  Forgetabboutit!!!  Stop your whining and enjoy the show.  This season is great.,1220486400,,175,4.766666666666667
3436674,5,B0019F02VW,"Soy un fiel fanatico a LOS INTOCABLES. Felicito a los productores y creadores de la serie. El consejo que sugiero es que salgan mas a menudo las temporadas. Ejemplo Se que faltan 2 temporadas para que termine la serie. Seria fabuloso que las 2 temporadas salgan el proximo ao. De ser asi seria el primero en encargarlas.
Que pena que los actores Robert Stack, Bruce Gordon, Neville Brand y muchos mas, algunos hayan dejado de existir.",1219190400,,434,4.723684210526316
3436675,1,B0019F02VW,"The Program is first rate but Paramount's performance rates a ""F"".
We as fans of the Untouchable Series showned our loyalty by buying the first  season in half season sets at inflated prices.
I will continue to purchase other series such as Mission Impossible where Paramount issues complete seasons for less than $35.
However for the Untouchables I'm through.
I will buy no more Untouchable programs at nearly $60 a season.
If the execs at Paramount think this plan is good marketing just watch them drive loyal Untouchable fans away.
In my case they have already succeeded.
In the end Paramount will lose revenues, fans will lose the programs and Paramount will blame their mistakened greed on ""lack of buyer interest"".",1214179200,,721,4.958677685950414
3436676,5,B0019F02VW,"Retro television shows have never done particularly well unless they were set in the Old West. Shows set in the 20's, 30's, 40's, etc, any era outside of the one in which they aired have never lasted long except in three major exceptions - Happy Days, Laverne & Shirley, and The Untouchables.

The Untouchables succeeded for a number of reasons. First, the veil that had been on the Mafia for a number of years was slowly but surely being peeled off due to gangland killings and the fame of gangsters such as Al Capone, Bugsy Siegel, Dutch Schultz, Lucky Luciano, and others. Even before the Godfather and its outstanding first sequel, the public had a fascination and curiosity with the mob. So take some true events, ture characters, heavily fictionalize them with Hollywood gloss and pathos, and you get a very successful show that made a star out of Robert Stack and brought new fame to a Treasury agent named Eliot Ness.

The Untouchables' collection should not have been split up into multiple sections. That's greed, pure and simple. But the lure of this show - its great characters, performances, grit and intelligence will draw buyers even though they know they're being ripped off. Stack's Ness is one of the best alltime detectives - fearless, relentless, and absolutely ruthless with the bad guys. The supporting casts were always excellent, and Bruce Gordon brough the right amount of humor and menace to Frank Nitti, Capone's chief lieutenant.

The Untouchables - Season Two, Volume 2 is not untouchable, but it is irresistable.",1211587200,,1542,4.923076923076923

8273815,5,B0019F02VW,"These stories encompass a wide variety of schemes, locations, and different personalities. I enjoyed these DVDs more than the previous ones. There is still action and gunplay but there is more substance to the stories.

The best thing about this faux history of organized crime is to get you to look up the real history of the characters and events. Hollywood took real license to make the series more dramatic and action-oriented. But it is enjoyable entertainment if you are not one of the anti-gun crowd. If anything, the series shows that when guns are banned, only criminals will have guns. And not the type that you register.

The character of the individuals portrayed span the spectrum from evil to good. From that perspective, the whole gauntlet of human relations and motivations are laid bare. That may come as a big shock to those who think that rhetoric solves problems.",1452384000,,883,4.88
