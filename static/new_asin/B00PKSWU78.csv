6815992,5,B00PKSWU78,"I'm not usually scared by horror movies, so I look for the ones that are realistically creepy and give me that ""thrill.""  This one does the trick!  If you like suspense, you'll love this.  I won't spoil the ending for you, but it looks like there should be a sequel... can't wait!  It's like a TV show that you just want to see the next episode of, but it gets 5 Stars from me, just the way it is.  Scary with just the right amount of funny parts to keep things interesting and set you up for surprises.  The scariest thing is that this could really happen.",1416441600,,557,4.158878504672897
6815993,5,B00PKSWU78,"This is an independent horror movie, just like the good 'ole days!  Really good story telling and a fresh new take on paranormal stuff.  Waaaaay better than the ""Blair Witch"" and it gave me nightmares for a couple of days. I recommend it!",1416441600,2,238,4.511627906976744

8688508,4,B00PKSWU78,I really enjoyed this clever independent film. Its not your typical blood-n-guts slasher movie like so many out there on the market. This film plants the seed of fear that these spirits can actually exist out there and can take possession of people! It makes you think twice about going hiking in the woods!,1427068800,2,307,4.703703703703703
8688509,5,B00PKSWU78,"This is a film worth watching, here's why;
I heard about the making of the film in one of the digital film journals- basically a couple of guys from American University's film program made it as their first feature film.  They were students so literally had no budget... they got aspiring actors / actresses for free, pulled together gear from anyone and anywhere, and shot it at the Director's family's land in KY and also some public parks et al, oh and they only had about 10 days to shoot the whole thing!!!
Then they edited, mixed, color corrected, sfx'ed, etc everything themselves (reach pretty much just the director- I know how that goes) into a final feature film... Knowing a thing or two about the industry, let me tell you, what they accomplished is unreal!!  A typical independent film would have several hundred thousand dollars to several million to just do the editing, mixing, color timing, etc... I can only imagine the man hours the director put in during post!
Look at this thing- it looks great, sounds great and flows seamlessly... You don't watch this and say, 'this was some junk someone shot on their home video camera and posted to YouTube...""  It looks and feels pro... They shot it on a Canon 5d DSLR and recorded sound on a Sound Design 424 recorder with a Sennheiser MKE 600 shotgun mic... basically, the bare minimum of professional equipment, but in the right hands it can make hollywood looking stuff... if you are interested in getting into the business- you should watch this film and study it... I tip my hat to these guys-

I also commend the acting... When you have a 10 day shoot where everyone shows up for the first day and starts... read that last part again, 'and starts'... there is no time to rehearse!  No time to find someone else if the chemistry is not there... no time for 20 takes... these talented folks had to jump in and hit the ground running.... for reference, put yourselves in their shoes and imagine you on the screen- not easy!... For that reason, I think they did a great job-
As far as the story line- it feels to me that it is teeing up some interesting plot angles for a follow up or even remake- sort of the El Mariachi to become the Desperado... I was entertained to say the least... were some parts cliches?  Sure, but show me a horror slasher film that is devoid of them...  Let me tell you this... Mr. Barrios (Director) has good chops!  I don't want to put any spoilers in this review, I will bet a dollar there will be more than one occasion where he is going to make your heart skip a beat!

So, long story short, approach it with the understanding that a skeleton crew of half-starved students from American set off on a ridiculously ambitious journey to create a feature film in 10 days = and this is the result... in my opinion, pretty darn amazing!!  If this is their first step, then I can only hope they get the backing to take a second step!",1427068800,3,2921,4.473684210526316
8688510,1,B00PKSWU78,"Unbelievably bad.  I rented the movie without reading the reviews.  OMG!  The acting in a high school play is 100 times better than the acting in this movie.  The script is convoluted and bad.  The dialog is cheesy.

If you value your sanity, SKIP THIS MOVIE.",1426377600,2,259,4.521739130434782

8688512,2,B00PKSWU78,"Just another c-movie microbudget flick with poor acting, filming goofs, enticing DVD artwork... the usual stuff you'd expect from a bad weekend-shoot video.

This is NOT a horror film by any stretch of the imagination (literally). If anything, it's a supernatural thriller-type video... with no thrills.

I did like that someone seems to have actually served in the military and got some of those aspects right (it's always amusing in these c-movies to see the blatantly obvious mistakes on uniforms, salutes with the wrong hand, etc etc). Some of the lingo and the like were more accurate than most of these kinds of no-budget flicks.

Though, I did find it funny one of the leads, who makes a big deal about being the ""top pistol shooter in the 101st Airborne"" go to the trouble of buying ammo from a bartender, flashing his ""357"", citing the Ranger rules, etc etc - then, after all that, the one thing he ""forgets"" to take on their hike... is the very first thing any soldier with think of: ammo? Oh, and the non-smoking smoking pararescueman was pretty funny with the ""non-inhaling"" - why bother to include that in the video if he's not even going to inhale?

The plot reminded me a bit of the cult classic horror movie ""Dog Soldiers,"" though they're not remotely in the same ballpark as far as any other aspect other than plot similarities.

But, anyway... it is what it is. I didn't ""hate"" it, just didn't care for it. My advice: definitely just take a pass on it, save yourself a couple bucks and get yourself a good cup of coffee instead.",1425686400,2,1546,4.627737226277373
8688513,1,B00PKSWU78,"This is the result of what would happen if Rambo and Schizo hooked up smoked crack mated and and had a love child. dumb as **** movie. 1 Starts off with two military guys and two girls who go to a cabin in the woods, thought okay nice start. 2 One tells the tale of an Indian legend about black spirits who look like shadows and can take on any form they want. 3 Hardly any supernatural or ghost stuff. 4 Lots if not to much of falling down while running away, boobs and cleavage. 5 Homicidal lunatic dressed in military garb with a weapon going all commando hunting and chasing them through the woods. Sadly kiddies it turns into just another slasher story, yawn

.................................................Warning. Major Spoiler Alert...................................................

This atrocities ending is the 4 of them get killed by a psychotic homicidal maniac dressed in military clothes being thrown into a hole and buried then a couple of flashes of a black shadow Indian spirit. There were no survivors in this one, gee why am I not surprised?",1425081600,2,1064,4.93854748603352
8688514,1,B00PKSWU78,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

Having read praises in Amazon about this movie, I purchased it instead
of renting it, thinking ""If so many people are saying good things, I'm
sure I'll watch this multiple times"".

I couldn't delete this movie from my hard-drive fast enough once I
finished watching it - $15 completely wasted!

The only reason I've rated this movie two stars instead of one is, from
a technical standpoint (audio, visuals, editing) it was sound.

HOWEVER (here there be spoilers).....

Acting - with the exception of one actor (Kevin Kingmaker), it was
abysmal (and the exception was not good, he simply wasn't as bad as the
others).

Plot - this was one of the most schizophrenic movies I've ever watched.
One moment, it was a supernatural horror, and then suddenly shifted to
a Rambo-wanna-be, except the Rambo character was the BAD guy. And then
suddenly, in the last shot, it jumps back to the supernatural again.

Throughout most of the film, we are shown glimpses of Indian spirits,
flitting around, but they play no part in the plot at all! Consider if
the movie The Ring showed the ghost of that girl throughout the movie,
but Noah is killed at the end by some random drive-by shooting and we
never see the ghost again. IT MAKES NO FREAKIN' SENSE!!!!

And I'm completely sick and tired of having ALL the ""good"" characters,
characters who I've invested time on, DIE AT THE END, without ANY sort
of payoff! I might as well just watch the news, where I can be
depressed for free.

I rarely get so agitated with a movie as I did with this one. I only
wish there was some way to remove any trace that I wasted money on it
from my Amazon account.

I will never trust Amazon reviews of unknown movies again, and I WILL
NEVER PURCHASE SAID MOVIES WITHOUT FIRST RENTING THEM!!!",1424822400,9,1791,4.586206896551724
8688515,2,B00PKSWU78,"I watched this, hoping it would get better, plot-wise, but, it didn't. This movie is for those who want to see young women with large bosoms running through a jungle. Not my cup of tea. I wish I had missed this one!",1424736000,,215,4.142857142857143
