8394406,1,B003CP1SQA,"Bloodbore - If you like a gabfest movie with no special effects, no violence or gore then you might like this. I watched it for the first half hour and said this is not going anywhere. Some gal trying to unlock a vault door in the basement of the house she and her husband, a cop, just bought. When they bought the place did no one tell them about the door? And why are the neighbors introducing themselves, why do they walk away saying ""I hate cops""? Dumb. Then it gets even dumber. A complete and total waste of 30 minutes of my life. Live and learn.",1438387200,,552,4.168224299065421
8394407,2,B003CP1SQA,"The plot of ""Bloodlock"" (2008) revolves around vampire locked in the basement of a house for decades and is unleashed when a couple purchases the home. The story is complicated by a love triangle wherein the husband wants to gaslight his wife for her sister who thinks she's hotter than she is, as well as a subplot involving an occultic old couple who will do anything to attain the immortality the imprisoned vampire offers.

I knew this was a no-budget independent movie before viewing and, with this in mind, the opening is promising, but it quickly devolves from there due to a lousy script, bad acting, bad flow (in certain sequences) and effects that are anything but special. It's more like a student movie than a legitimate independent film and, overall, is bottom-of-the-barrel filmmaking.
.

That said, there are quite a few things I appreciate. For one, I enjoy seeing the work of amateur filmmakers and I think the director has what it takes but, in this case, he needed to hire a real writer, better actors and an FX technician, not to mention cut out filler material that pads the runtime. I also enjoyed the Youngstown, Ohio, area locations of which the director doesn't really take advantage. As it's filmed, it could've been shot in any big town in the Northern USA or Canada.

A couple of the actors are actually decent despite the lousy script, particularly the main protagonist, Christine played by the distinctive Ashley Gallo, and, less so, the guy who plays Luke the locksmith. Ashley could go on to better things if she plays her cards right.

The movie runs 89 Minutes.

8394409,1,B003CP1SQA,"Barry and Christine move into a new house with Christine's sister, Lisa, until she gets back on her feet. Want more character development? Well, there isn't really any. Except that Barry is a flaming a-hole. He's cheating on his wife with flirtatious Lisa, and has no problem wasting his neighbors, who walk into his house to try and open the locked door in their basement. Did I mention The Door? The one with the titanium ""Bloodlock?!"" The previous tenant locked a vampire inside and sealed it so that no one could ever let it loose. Neighbors Foster and Edwina are after immortality that the vampire can apparently provide. I'm not sure he wouldn't just rip their heads off, like he does Barry's. What makes them think they can trust this creature? Later in the movie, they attempt to present Christine as a kick-ass vampire hunter. This does not work at all. She chugs garlic and holy water, which, laughably, comes in handy late in the flick. Foster survived and joins the vampire hunting squad with Christine and Luke the locksmith. Oh yeah, Foster survived?! His arm is in a sling. They repeatedly refer to Foster's damaged arm as a ""busted wing."" He got shot in the gut, I'm not exactly sure what happened to his ""wing."" They all cruise around in her 1992 Chrysler minivan. Not exactly the Mystery Machine. The ending was a real groaner. Maybe even an eye-roller.",1365897600,,1371,4.716666666666667
8394410,5,B003CP1SQA,I love low budget monster flicks.  This had a decent plot and was watchable.  Considering the budget level it had good camera work too.,1354060800,,135,4.583333333333333
8394411,2,B003CP1SQA,"William V. Schotten is a prolific indie filmmaker who has quite a diverse portfolio of horror films he's created. There's Dead Life, the grindhouse homage, which is really quite good, if you have a nostalgic love of 1970s exploitation cinema. There's Silver Cell, an experimental horror film that's quite interesting. But Bloodlock is just not up to par.

The basic storyline is that a ghost hunter imprisoned a centuries-old vampire in a basement vault in sleepy-town Ohio. When two Satan-worshippers in search of immortality release the ""Master,"" bloodshed and carnage follow. It's not a terrible premise, though a little hard to buy. But what really kills the film is that the story just isn't well-realized in the script. The characters are flat, and their motives are hard to swallow because there isn't enough setup to make them believable or to make us care about them. The acting isn't great, but I've seen these actors in other Schotten films and they've done much better, so I really think the blame has to be placed on the script.

Check out one of Schotten's other films and give this one a pass.",1300320000,,1108,4.857142857142857
