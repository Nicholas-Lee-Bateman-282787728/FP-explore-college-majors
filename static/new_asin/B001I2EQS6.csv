3646427,5,B001I2EQS6,"It was a cute show - the movies (Boris Karloff and Brenden Fraiser) are pretty good. Its quasi-historical and its a whimsical show for youngsters - considering I was 12 when the show came on the air. So, all - in - all its pretty good. Also, the disc was in great condition too. Have all 3 volumes - fantastic.",1383350400,3,310,4.183333333333334

8310348,5,B001I2EQS6,"This is a cartoon version of the Mummy of Branden Frasher, love it, mysteries of the Egyptian courses.",1513900800,,102,4.722222222222222
8310349,5,B001I2EQS6,"Instead of following the events of ""The Mummy"" and ""The Mummy Returns"", this animated series takes characters and ideas from those two films and retells events as a Saturday morning cartoon. Imhotep was not mummified alive for sleeping with the Pharoah's wife, but for plotting to steal the manacle of Osiris, and Evie did not use the Book of the Dead to resurrect Imhotep but instead gave it to the Museum of Antiquities, and instead of Alex getting the bracelet of Anubis stuck on his wrist, he gets the manacle of Osiris stuck on his wrist. And instead of Benny, there's a new character Colin Weasley. Despite these changes, however, it very much keeps the spirit of the movies alive. The films are family friendly action pictures, so an animated series makes sense. Plus in the 90's every film spawned a cartoon. Anck Su Namun eventually features into the story, and there are a lot of Easter eggs/callbacks to the movies for fans, so I would definitely recommend this series to fans of the franchise. It's much more faithful and in spirit than ""Tomb of the Dragon Emperor""",1497398400,,1077,4.73404255319149
