4392401,5,B004K4FUUM,"We have these videos at the library where I'm the children's librarian.  As soon as they go missing or get damaged I replace them because preschoolers love them.  These DVDs are part of Scholastic's series of DVDs based on quality children's books.  I Stink contains, I Stink, an award winning book  about a trash truck eating things in alphabetical order; Mike Mulligan's Steam Shovel, a classic about a man and his steam shovel; Trashy Town, a super video about a garbage truck with a very catchy repeated rhyme; The Remarkable Riderless Runaway Tricycle, about a tricycle magically escaping the garbage collectors so it can get back to its owner.  Even adults love the tricycle story; Beast of Monsieur Racine; and Arnie the Doughnut, a donught who doesn't want to be eaten.  I'm Dirty contains, I'm Dirty, learning to count at a construction sight; Burt Dow Deep Water Man, a classic about how a New England fisherman who finds a way to escape from a whale; The Paperboy, getting up while the town sleeps to deliver the news; Stars, Stars, Stars; Fletcher and the Falling Leaves' and Johnny Appleseed.  These are high quality videos that children will enjoy.  The text is exactly the same as the books.  The narrators do an excellent job of making the stories come alive.  This set is perfect for little people who are obsessed with trucks, like my little toddler nephews.  Highly recommended from someone who knows which DVDs kids love, and which sit on the shelf.",1388448000,7,1469,4.812749003984064
4392402,5,B004K4FUUM,"All three of my kids who are currently 6.5, 5, and 2 love these DVDs. They are nice, calm stories read and animated in interesting ways.",1371168000,2,136,4.269230769230769
4392403,5,B004K4FUUM,"Got this as a present for my almost 2 yr. old son (he is now 3) who was/is obsessed with garbage trucks and he LOVES it! It has a nice read-a-long feature that shows the words as the story is being told. If your child watches this as often as mine (lol) then I think that there is a good chance of getting a ""head start"" on some reading. Even my 6 yr.old likes this! I think that it is good for both genders, as not all the stories are so gender specific. Entertaining and educational at the same time.",1363824000,4,502,4.03
4392404,5,B004K4FUUM,great videos-  you can add the words for the children to read along with or at least watch the words of the words they are hearing,1358380800,2,130,4.0

4392441,1,B004K4FUUM,I thought I was getting 12 Dirty & Stinky stories like the one we watched on Amazon Prime. This is a collection of stories about things that move.,1438041600,,146,4.25

4392444,1,B004K4FUUM,"This may be the worst thing I've ever watched! Absolutely terrible. Boring, slow-paced and just plain bad.  I'd rather throw my money in the trash and get punched in the face by a kangaroo!",1435708800,,189,4.5588235294117645
4392445,3,B004K4FUUM,"My kids LOVE the stinky and dirty books and the one episode show on Amazon instant video. We ordered this in hopes it would be more of that, but it's just a dvd of someone reading these books to pictures. It was disappointing for us, but the kids didn't mind. I think it was more my husbands fault for not reading the description before ordering.",1433635200,6,346,4.338461538461538

4392450,5,B004K4FUUM,We love 4 out of 5 scholastic videos yet this one is our favorite! The voice...the music..the stories. You'll hear the voice and wonder where you've heard it before. Its a nice celeb cameo.,1389398400,,189,4.588235294117647
8432237,1,B004K4FUUM,"To begin with, I was disappointed with this video.  I was under the impression that it was like the I'm Dirty series that our grandson has seen on Netflix.  So that alone was disappointing.  I decided to return it, which I did.  Upon doing the return process, I was told by Amazon that my refund would be $6.03.  So I decided to go with the return.  Upon completion on the return, I got a confirmation email stating that my refund to my account would be $.83.  83 Cents!!!!!!!!!  That was just today.  If I had known that I would literally be throwing money way to return the video, I would have just kept it and donated it to charity.  I am disgusted that Amazon told me one thing and did something totally different.  We have been PRIME users for years and in my opinion, this is totally unacceptable.  DO NOT buy this product unless you plan on keeping it.",1525910400,,859,4.333333333333333
8432238,5,B004K4FUUM,Grandson loved it,1509235200,,17,5.0
8432239,5,B004K4FUUM,"We originally saw ""I stink"" on netflix or something and my son fell in love with it. Then they took it off. That doesn't really make a 4 year old very happy. So, I purchased it instead. It came with lots of other shows also, and he loves several of them. They are easy to follow as they are all made in reference to the books themselves. Great episodes and a lot of fun for learning.",1497312000,,383,4.052631578947368

8432242,1,B004K4FUUM,Very disappointed. Thought we were hitting something similar to the stinky and dirty show on prime. Nope. One 10 minute show that is the same story as the book. Other shows on the DVD absolutely suck. My daughter hates them.,1490486400,,224,4.625

8432246,5,B004K4FUUM,"This is so great! No, it's not the same thing as the animated cartoon on prime video. It's more like an animated version of the book. Great for any toddler into garbage trucks.",1467072000,,176,4.363636363636363
