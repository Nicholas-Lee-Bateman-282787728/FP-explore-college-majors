Benjamin Bratt stars as Arno, a down-on-his-luck knock-about who runs an errand for a rich woman who lives on a luxury yacht.  He's set up, though, and only help from friends saves him from the crooked authorities.

His love interest is Conquina, played by the stunning Mili Avital.  He finds a sunken boat he had a connection with, and, with Conquina, plans to salvage the vessel before it can be found by the authorities.  They're ill-equipped, though, and help (in a way) comes from the shady Jean-Pierre (Armand Assante) with his partner Janine (Simone-Elise Girard).

The sultry sun, the warm ocean, sunken treasure (and a hungry shark) makes for some back-and-forth intrigue that keeps you guessing.  There are several twists and turns, including the reappearance of characters we thought were gone.

The sexy undertones of the film, combined with the beautiful Caribbean sunsets, islands and lapping waves make this an above-average film.

Recommended, especially those susceptable to tales of treasure, the moody life before World War II, and scheming lovers, supposed lovers, and relationships of convenience.

Look for Jennifer Beals of ""Flashdance"" fame in a small role of Mrs. Gavotte

Three-and-one half to four stars.",1151193600,8,1334,5.186915887850467
1418657,4,B00005AW00,"For a film few people probably have heard about, this was pretty good. It is a suspense tale of greed as Benjamin Bratt, Armand Assante and their respective girlfriend and wife go after jewels and gold from a sunken ship near the Bahamas.

Paranoia helps make this a guessing game on who and why things are happening, with a bunch of twists and turns popping up late in the story. It's a tame movie, language-wise, and features some nice photography.

It's not worth buying but you could do a whole lot worse renting something else.",1146009600,3,532,4.589473684210526
1418658,5,B00005AW00,"This movie starring Benjamin Bratt has something for lovers of action, drama, and suspense movies. Based on a short story by Hemingway, the screenplay is written (updated and improved) by one of his main friends and biographers A.E. Hotchner. This is a rare case where the movie is actually much better than the literature it is based on. The basic plot hook is two couples working together to uncover the treasure on a recently sunken ship. Greed and mixed affinities between the couples lead to all kinds of plot twists that make the ending an unpredictable surprise. Of course getting there is all the fun. This film is little known about because it was an independent film released a few years back. Don't be put off though, this movie is definitely worth it! A true ""diamond in the rough.""",1126483200,12,794,4.719424460431655

7935902,2,B00005AW00,"This movie isn't that good. It's barely watchable and almost predictable. The beginning of this movie is so horribly directed, you really have to be patient....as it eventually becomes clear what is going on. And even then it's a dull, boring adventure/thriller.

7935907,4,B00005AW00,"This story by Ernest Hemingway has all the male dominance and passion like most of his work.  There are two latin men vying for sunken treasure and a woman.  Who will win the battle for supremacy?  It has a great little twist at the end.
