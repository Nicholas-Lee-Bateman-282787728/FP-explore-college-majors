2672602,3,B000JJR0RI,"Standard documentary quality.  Good montage sequence in the beginning introducing you to the key players in the conference.  The music on during the question and answer portion was a little loud, but okay.  Secret society information was interesting and well explained by Gardiner.  Worth your time to view.",1204243200,,307,5.333333333333333
2672603,3,B000JJR0RI,"This DVD is a chance for those interested in the paranormal, secret societies, UFOs and such to travel to a conference and hear from many experts in the field, with live interviews and lectures from Gardiner's Forbidden Knowledge UK 06 event. Includes music by Reality Films favorite, Soul Path.",1201219200,2,295,5.040816326530612
2672604,2,B000JJR0RI,"I got this DVD along with the Secret of the Serpent DVD...both equally good information with a really really bad background music. The music was so poorly put together, was so loud and very poor choice of music that I did not want to watch anymore. Do your consumer a favor and either let them know that the background music may be disturbing to their nervous system or take it out all together.",1200614400,3,395,4.424657534246576
2672605,1,B000JJR0RI,"Guys, if your reading this review you most have interest in this dvd. Bad idea. Ok, first you can berely understand anything that is discossed, because the echo and the band in the back ground sound. Sure this could be of a big interest if your investigeting ancent civilizations, but you will defenely waist your $$. Good luck!",1195603200,7,328,4.672413793103448
2672606,1,B000JJR0RI,"""Forbidden Knowledge"".... a joke,period. Presented authors who were not there,audio gave 2 words out of 4,could not see what the speakers were showing on the screen,played ""stupid"" music  LOUDLY while people were talking, and gave no answers at all. A stupid,stupid joke.",1193961600,3,271,5.4523809523809526
2672607,1,B000JJR0RI,"While the content of the speakers is good, two of the speakers advertised on it weren't included and the production quality is atrocious. It was filmed from the back of the hall from a single fixed camera with no close ups, camera angle change nor direct audio feed so you can barely see the speaker and the sound quality is hollow and echoes. Also, the sound track laid under the vocal content is heavy metal which isn't appropriate and too loud so it makes it very difficult to hear what the speakers are saying - and that's what the DVD is all about! Top this off with the fact that the audio is out of sinc with the video so their lips don't match up with what they're saying like a cheap Chinese matial art movie and I can only comment that this is the poorest quality of anything I've ever purchased from Amazon by a long stretch. The producer, Phillip Gardiner needs to employ some professionals if he intends to sell product, instead of using all his family members for production as is indicated in the titles at the end. (There are at least 5 Gardiners shown.)",1185235200,16,1070,4.409090909090909
2672608,2,B000JJR0RI,"Once again a lot of hype for a very poorly mixed and edited film.  I don't know what it is about these films that always falls short with the music/voice mixing.  The music is way too loud and the voices are too faint.  Not to mention, the music sucks.  And, what's up with the reverb?  These idiots used a mic on a camera about 50 feet away for the primary voice track in a large hall, so you get all this heavy natural reverb making it even more difficult to hear what the presenter is saying.  Maybe a mic a little closer?  Idiots.  If there is any 'hidden' knowledge being presented, you'll have to wear headphones or constantly adjust the volume for the crappy music interludes to hear anything - or watch it several times and take notes.  Why can't they pan the music to one side, the voice to the other, and hire an experienced mixing engineer for appropriate levels?  My suggestion to this production company: Stick to the information and tone it down a bit on the unnecessary bells and whistles, and, consider mic placement next time.  Frankly, most of us just want to hear the presenter, not be subjected to a bunch of annoying heavy metal music and cheap transition effects.  Are these guys trying to promote their friends bands?  Just doesn't mesh.

This kind of low quality 'could' be forgivable 20 years ago, but with access to average technology - pre-installed on most computers today - it is criminal.",1182124800,,1418,4.553359683794467
2672609,5,B000JJR0RI,"I am so glad that Gardiner brought this out because I was furious I couldn't get to the UK to see it. Now I bought this and sat down with a beer and watched. I only wish that DVD's were longer so that I could see all the speakers whole lectures, but to be honest I might have got bored. As it is, this is just the right length and we get tales from all of them, with extras. I loved Crichton Miller, Hamish Miller's music of the crickets and Andrew Collins was shown fully explaining his new Cygnus Mystery. Tim Wallace-Murphy is like a modern day Gandalf and Gardiner is a great stand up comedian (as the outtakes show!)

Buy it, better than most for sure.",1163203200,6,657,4.173228346456693

8150959,4,B000JJR0RI,"To be a fly on the wall at this conference would be a dream come true!  A wellspring of knowledge, a coming together of incredibly forces.  The energy alone at such a place must be overwhelming.  The experts that come together are such natural teachers, you can't help but feel their knowledge seep into your very essence.

8150960,4,B000JJR0RI,"Rarely do you get to see a presentation where so many great minds converge to share their thoughts on a variety of subjects. This was like getting to attend a really cool, forward thinking conference without all the hassles of getting there.",1374883200,,241,4.761904761904762
8150961,1,B000JJR0RI,"The sound was so bad you couldn't understand a single word said in any of the lecture sections, the they made it worse still by dubbing music over the top of it, so what you might have been able to actually hear, you couldn't anymore. What a total waste of time, save your money, watch a different version on youtube.",1298937600,,317,4.3

8150963,1,B000JJR0RI,"What might have been interesting lectures and power-point presentations are absolutely sabotaged by having the camera/sound recorder at the back of a lecture hall caputuring the ambient sound of amplified voices.  For whatever reason, the microphones were not tied into the recording, so what you get is a dismally low grade recording of amplified voices as they are dispersed throughout the hall.  Then, to compound that problem, an insipid ""new age"" vocal soundtrack has been laid over the lectures rendering them essentially inaudible. I wholeheartedly agree with every reviewer who lambasted this DVD for it's amateurish, defective and inexcusably crummy production values.",1210032000,,677,5.627450980392157
8150964,2,B000JJR0RI,The sound quality was poor.  Music was added throughout the program.  The music was pleasant but made it very difficult to hear the speeches.  I wish I could have made out enough to know if the subjects were well covered.,1208563200,,221,4.475
8150965,1,B000JJR0RI,"Horrendous sound quality with annoying background music makes this DVD almost unintelligible. Amatuerish, low quality production of probably interesting speakers, echoing blandly in a large room. I only hope I can get a refund for this money-waster.",1207872000,,249,5.756756756756757
8150966,1,B000JJR0RI,I would not even give this a rating of 1 star for I could not even watch the DVD that was sent to me it was of such poor quality.....I am disgusted with the amount of money that I have wasted on such an item...And would not recommend it to anyone.,1204588800,,247,3.8627450980392157
