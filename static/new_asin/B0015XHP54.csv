The best in mexican comedy television.",1238716800,2,284,4.916666666666667

8260408,3,B0015XHP54,"PROS

1) It's an affordable purchase.
2) The DVD disc and case are well-made. I did not expect them this nice-looking.

CONS

1) Not all episodes are funny. I found about half of the episodes to be funny and the other half were not so much. I expected the episodes to be more funny as I recall watching some episodes on TV and considering them to be very funny. Maybe they did not select their best-rated episodes for this disc.",1378166400,,428,4.325

8260410,5,B0015XHP54,The familia peluche was great.  The masterful use of double meanings is just great.  Derbez is excellent in this series. I laughed through out all of the episodes.,1243555200,3,163,4.785714285714286
