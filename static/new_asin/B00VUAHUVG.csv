8711313,1,B00VUAHUVG,From the people that brought you the orange brick dvd sets.. We bring you another polished turd. The first thing I noticed was the frame was shaking like a unbalanced washer. There were scenes that were either refiltered or just completely made up. There were times that Goku and Frieza were as big as Imperfect Cell stage 2 about to blow up the earth then all of a sudden back to normal size. I could go on all day. I've only watched one episode I'm on the 2nd as I type and its only getting worse.,1532908800,,499,4.208333333333333
8711314,5,B00VUAHUVG,Great dvd. Good fights and Uncut. Ill recommend dbz fans to buy this dvd because is rare and out of print.,1432166400,,106,4.095238095238095
8711315,1,B00VUAHUVG,"one star isn't low enough,
the voices are the same as what I grew up hearing on the show,
but the soundtrack is crap,
and the whole fights aren't even there,
all you get to see are small portions of the fights,
don't waste your money!",1429401600,,234,4.108695652173913
