7983383,5,B00008G8SS,"Bullet, Bombs and Babes. This B-Movie has them all. I was so sad to see Ava Cadell's character get killed off. I hate to see a pretty girl get killed off in any genre--even if she's a bad gal.

This is the story of a man named Kane (Played By The Late Great Pat Morita) who sends a succession of teams out to kill Dona Speir and Roberta Vasquez. One by one each and everyone of them are killed (With The Exception Of Two Bumbling Cajun Idiots In Louisiana) or imprisoned. If I'd been Kane I would have sued for peace after my first three teams had been destroyed. It would have saved time and lives. But Carolyn Liu was smart! She jumped ship when the end was near and brokered a deal for herself where she'd become a spy for Dona Speir's team in exchange for her life. Poor Kane had no idea his lovely, sexy assistant was turning coat on him. It's always a beautiful woman that does a powerful man in.

I taped this from cable in the 1990's. I enjoyed it so much that I even bought the DVD combo pack that contains all of Sidaris's films with Speir and Vasquez. I give this Five Stars for what it is. A cheesy B-Movie that more than holds its own.

7983384,2,B00008G8SS,"""Do or Die"" is yet another Andy Sidaris movie following his favorite starlet Dona Speir (as undercover agent Donna) and sidekick Roberta Vasquez (as Nicole). This time they have been targeted for death by evil Asian crime boss Pat Morita (!) as Kane, but since he has a sense of honor and sense of humor, he gives the girls formal notice that he's going to send six teams of assassins to kill them starting at noon the next day.

The girls go up against this bevy of evildoers with the help of a ragtag band of agents and Air Force officers. Erik Estrada is back, but unlike in ""Guns"" where he was the evil boss, here he is an Air Force Colonel months from retirement who takes on one last dangerous mission. (Hey, it's a paycheck!) The film plays out in a series of encounters, each less sensible than the previous, all of which culminate in an action scene of some sort. The first duel, for instance, is a standard Sidaris jeep versus helicopter affair. Thank goodness Nicole had an air to air rocket in her boot. (I am not kidding. Even a little.) There's the obligatory scene in the Cessna 172 that SIdaris uses in so many films before the cast goes off to Las Vegas, another formulaic Sidaris development. Oddly, while everyone is enroute to sin city, the editing takes us to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana where we meet Colonel Rico Estevez (Estrada) who is a suave lady's man. Why Barksdale? Because it gives the film a tenuous reason to detour to New Orleans, of course, where we see some no-good chefs cook up some fish that kills a cat. This is a shame, as the tabby gave by far the best performance in the film in a sad scene that paves the way for some banjo chase music.

There's tons of overacting, improbable modes of transportation in odd circumstances (the Volkswagen Beetle of death, the amphibious aircraft with a pusher propeller, skidoos, and of course lots of speedboats and motorcycles) and plenty of ridiculous plot twists (e.g. when an hour into the film Kane declares it's all about manipulating the American stock market.) My personal favorite scene is when Rico throws baseballs at a guy with a shotgun: this wouldn't seem to be a fair duel until the last baseball is revealed to actually be a grenade disguised as a baseball.

After the assassin team of Hotdog and Sledge (really) fails, there's a bit of a martial arts interlude before the good guys discover they've been being tracked by a ""laser microchip"" in Donna's wristwatch. This proves to be Kane's ultimate undoing, but instead of a gigantic finale, the film just withers away with the most anticlimactic ending possible where they decide to just let Kane keep doing what he is doing and watch him. (What?)

""Do or Die"" has some good entertainment value for lovers of cinematic cheese, but the best parts are seeing Morita as a bad guy and Estrada as an Air Force Colonel with everyone spouting inane dialogue and turning in hammy performances (don't miss Chu Chu Malave as Bodreaux). This isn't as bad as ""Guns"", but it's nowhere near ""Picasso Trigger"" on the Sidaris quality scale.",1469491200,,3077,4.640366972477064

7983389,4,B00008G8SS,"DO OR DIE is another sunshiny, laugh out loud installment in the ongoing Andy Sidaris magnum opus of Bullets, Bombs and Babes.

This time around, the babes, aka super secret agents Donna Hamilton (Playmate Dona Speir) and Nicole Justin (Playmate Roberta Vasquez who has an endearing habit of staring wide-eyed directly into the camera) are hanging out in Hawaii when they are targeted for assassination by the not-quite inscrutable Oriental mystery man Kane (who else, ha ha?) played with very un-Arnold-like glee by Pat Morita. This movie is sort of like ""Dial Mr. Myagi For Murder."" Get it?

After capturing the girls, Kane advises them that he has hired six death teams to kill them. Then he lets them go. Kind of a dopey thing to do if you think about it, but who ever had a thought in a Sidaris movie, anyway?

After being released, our lovely ladies immediately return to base, shed their shirts and skirts, and climb into a nearby hot tub. After several bubbly minutes of increasing blood flow to their brains and other more interesting anatomical regions, they decide to disguise themselves in fright wigs, cats'-eye sunglasses, and thrift shop clothing so they don't attract unwanted attention. They then head for Louisiana in late autumn, mostly I guess because that's Andy's home turf and he probably wanted to visit a few relatives while on location.

While on their way to the airport, the first death team shows up, and as per their description, quickly dies, courtesy of Erik Estrada, who is playing a fairly good guy in this movie (even though Donna keeps kicking him out of her personal space). He blows up a helicopter, which is de rigeur for a Sidaris production.

Everybody then makes tracks to the Bayou, where a very pretty redheaded Playmate Cynthia Brimhall is putting Clifton Chenille and the whole Zydeco motif to shame by dancing around in her lacy white undies and singing a really bad song at some tacky cowboy bar.

Lingerie and all, the good guys decide to go for real down home Cajun food at Big Pine Lodge. The gumbo, shock of shocks, turns out to be poisoned, courtesy of another death team made up of the two cooks from that old Bugs Bunny ""Antoine of New Orleans"" cartoon. At least they act like those guys.

It's good product placement in theory, but I don't know if the owners of Big Pine Lodge should be thanking Andy or not for his culinary endorsement.

An Oscar-losing but incredibly stupid chase scene follows, wherein the good guys and bad guys are running around through the woods detonating explosives, uttering assorted ""Ohs,"" ""Nos"" and ""Get 'ems,"" and trying to avoid each other on camera. There's a tremendous amount of pointless shooting and yelling. It's a classic moment in film history. If you believe DELIVERANCE to be the non plus ultra of cinema, that is.

Considering this is supposed to be a battle between secret agents and contract killers, nobody hits a thing. No wait. I'm wrong. Somebody dispatches a duck. Whoops.

An interesting sequence then follows. New agent Atlanta Lee (played by actress Stephanie Schick whose nom de plume is Pandora Peaks and certainly deserves it) and some man not wearing pants have a soft core love scene together under what appears to be either the world's smallest waterfall or a leaky pipe. The scene is irrelevant to the rest of the picture, but then again, the picture is irrelevant to the rest of reality anyway, so you might as well sit back and take it all in.

In the end the good guys win and Pat Morita hangs his head in shame, which is what he should have done after THE NEXT KARATE KID. And to think Hilary Swank was in that one. Score one for Darwin.

Besides the entertaining and mindless main feature, the DVD has several installments of ""Film School,"" where the Sidaris family proves that despite the two bit acting, cruddy dialogue, and nonexistent plotlines of their films they are deadly serious about quality production values. If you are interested in how movies are made, and made well for that matter, don't miss the extras here.

Utterly chaotic and enjoyable comedy!",1118534400,4,4084,4.767705382436261
