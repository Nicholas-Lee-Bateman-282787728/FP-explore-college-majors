This is a must see movie for any fan of independent film. I really enjoyed this film, the story, the realism...this was a brave movie to make...and a creative genius behind the story...Kudos mr. garcia for making a movie like this. Hopefully someone in hollywood watches this movie, and realizes films like this need to made for the mainstream...not just for the arthouse cinema.",1130976000,,619,4.895238095238096
8078685,4,B000AKIVJC,"Well I too caught this at a friend's house.  It had already been on for about 10 minutes when I started watching.  I just kept asking, ""Holy Crap, do you guys remember hearing about this?""  It will just suck you in.

I just bought my own copy because I want to show it to my friends back home.  The end of the movie will blow you away when you realize the twist.  Really a great Indie flick.",1124668800,,391,4.012987012987013
8078686,5,B000AKIVJC,"I was captivated by this film. The true story of a young prostitute trying her hardest to reach for a life of which she can only dream- and then she is murdered. This documentary is truly fascinating. What makes it all the more incredible is that it is all fiction- not in the sense that this never happens, but that this story did. The filmmakers did an outstanding job of making a film that is sharp, different and simply brilliant. There is no room in this film for campy one-liners and staged computer effects- this film is intrepid independent filmmaking- the best type of film you can watch. It draws you in with its feel and dialog. The writing was so good, you think it is all ad-libbed documentary. A whole new way to tell a story.

If you do not have this film in your DVD library, you do not like independent film.",1123545600,,825,4.357142857142857
8078687,4,B000AKIVJC,I caught this movie at a friend's house. I hadn't ever heard of it and I was a bit shocked by its content. I had absolutely no idea that this was a fictional movie. It seemed so real. The acting is quite amazing. You just get swept up in the story and sucked in to what was going on. There are no bonus materials other than the trailer on the disk and it would have been nice to listen to an audio commentary by the director and some of the actors. It was still a very good movie and not really like anything I've ever seen before.,1122940800,,531,3.97196261682243
