7938499,4,B00005J75H,"Of Human Bondage, 1934 film

The movie begins with a view of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. A man studies painting and wonders if he should continue? No, he is mediocre. He decides to study medicine in London. We see ""St. Bartholomew's Hospital"" (Barts?). One doctor has a brusque attitude. A boy has a club foot. Philip Carey shows his deformity to the students. One student asks another for advice on love. Philip diagnoses a young woman as anemic. Is she ill-natured? Philip says she has a nice smile. Philip sketches her portrait and makes a date with her. He orders champagne for their meal. Is she cold to him? Philip dreams of her. Is he in love with her? ""I don't mind."" Emil Miller talks to Philip and offers advice. Mildred can't go to the theater. Does she have a cruel streak? Philip reads a thick book while other students party. He keeps thinking of Mildred, and fails his exam. They meet again.

The other students say Mildred isn't a good match for him (her social class). Mildred says she will marry another man (she is 24 and getting old). A fellow student advises Philip to find another woman. He meets Norah, who writes romantic stories for a pulp magazine; it's a good living with these fantasies for young woman. She insists that Philip study for his exams. Is he too sensitive about his foot? One day he finds a visitor - Mildred. Emil has left her, she is with child. Mildred has her pride. [Pride is one of the seven deadly sins.] Philip gives her money. He talks to Emil, who has a wife and child! Does Philip still love her? Mildred will do anything for him. Then Norah comes to visit him to learn why Philip hasn't seen her. ""How could you?"" Mildred delivers in a hospital. She has another boyfriend, Harry. Mildred means nothing to him, he tells Philip. They quarrel and break off their friendship when Mildred tells about a trip to Paris with Harry.

But Harry rejects Mildred too! Philip meets a man in the Charity Hospital. Why is he poor? ""Fast women and slow horses."" While testing a patient he meets his daughter Sally, and later visits this large family. This man offers his opinions on life! Sally invites him back. The days pass. Philip returns, and learns about Mildred's problems. He invites her to stay with him, she has no place to go. Mildred complains about his paintings. Philip's uncle sends him money. Mildred speaks out and insults him! She slashes his paintings and burns the securities meant to pay for his education! He must leave medical school. But first they operate on his club foot. Philip can't find work. His landlady wants the past due rent and puts him out.

Sally's father wants him to stay there, and finds a job for Philip. Mildred visits Philip, she is coughing all the time. Its her lungs. [TB was a fatal disease until they developed antibiotics. Note the dark make-up on Mildred's eyes.] Mildred pleads with him. A letter tells Philip his uncle has died, he will get a small inheritance. Philip now passes his exams. Philip accepts a job on a steamship line. He visits Sally, she tells of her love. When he returns he will marry Sally. Mildred is in the Charity Hospital and dying. Philip won't take that job but asks Sally to marry him.

This is an educational drama that warns against using emotions as a guide to behavior. Should you love someone when this is against your best interests? Would Norah have been a better match than Sally? It depends. The comedy ""Blind Date"" has a similar warning about basing your love on looks alone.",1466121600,,3500,4.575757575757576
7938500,4,B00005J75H,"This version of ""Of Human Bondage"" is hampered by the early 1930's puritanical production code.
Nevertheless, Bette Davis turns in a fantastic performance as the sluttish Mildred.
Leslie Howard is also effective as the masochistic Philip.
All in all this is a 5 ""star"" film.
So why did I only give it 4 ""stars""?
The quality of the video is mediocre, the digital transfer is not good, the print used was scratched and the sound at times muddy.",1219104000,,442,4.67948717948718
7938501,5,B00005J75H,"I purchased this DVD for rental at my store and not only was i pleased with the price and the film transfer but I was thrilled at the amount of extras on this edition.  This DVD contains about 20 minutes of ""bloopers"" from early Warner Brother films.  Granted, these ""blopers have shown up on ""Hollywood Outake"" tapes but it was a nice addition to this DVD. The ""newsreel"" section was interesting as well, even though historically out of context with the film.  . This DVD package is one of the best I've seen of  older Warner Brothers films.  Wouldn't it have been nice if ""Jezebel"" and ""Now Voyager"" had such extras?  Take notice Warner.
