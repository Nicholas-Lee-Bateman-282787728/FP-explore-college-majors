8050601,4,B0007QS284,"I love the British series Cold Feet.  I started watching it when it was being shown on Bravo! a few years back.  All of the seasons (or series)are well-written and acted, and the second one is no exception. Infidelity, crushes on friends, pregnancy, rekindlings of romance, job loss and serious illness are just a few of the topics that are tackled in the second series of this witty, smart and sexy drama.  I can't wait until the rest of the seasons are released on DVD here in the US!",1113782400,,486,4.438202247191011
