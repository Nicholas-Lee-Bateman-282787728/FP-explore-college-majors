459348,5,6302413737,"In this coming of age tale set in 1957 rural Lousiana, Dani is a character you will love forever as you watch and re-watch this movie just to revisit her poignant tale of youth, including first love and loss.  (Definately a  sentimental story if you have sisters, as I do!)  This movie is... richly  haunting... in a heartwarming way that is portrayed with a purity that  makes it a simply beautiful piece of work.  (Reese Whitherspoon is stunning  as the young actress playing 14-year-old Dani in this film!)  Buy it today  and enjoy it forever!",923529600,,546,4.663157894736842

459555,5,6302413737,"I remember seeing this movie long ago when it was first released to video. Yes, its that old. At the time I remember thinking it was a good movie but it never really stuck with me for some reason. I always recalled the name and that of the young actor in the lead role but it wasn't until revisiting it just now that I was dumbstruck by the talents of this young woman. She was just 14 at the time and this was her first film. Her name is Reese Witherspoon.

The movie tells the story of two sisters in 1957 farm country. Growing up together they are the best of friends with Maureen Trant (Emily Warfield) the older of the two and about to go off to college at Duke. Dani Trant (Witherspoon) is only 14 and coming out of her tomboy phase, in love with Elvis and about to become a young woman.

The summer the story takes place in changes everything about the two girls. In the case of Maureen shes unsure of what her future holds, not quite certain if she should get her education or simply marry a young man and become a housewife like her mother. She has a steady beau but his constant need for something more physical than she wants to offer is a block for the two of them.

Dani on the other hand still loves to jump in the nearby watering hole and spend her summer having fun when she can get away with it. Her father Matthew (Sam Waterston) wants her to start taking responsibility but her mother Abigail (Tess Harper) tells him that he must have missed that age when she was too young to run off and now is suddenly too old to have fun.

The catalyst for change comes in the form of new neighbors. Mother Marie (Gail Strickland) is an old friend of the Trants. A single mother raising three boys two are at that age of being unmanageable. Her eldest Court (Jason London) at 16 is the man of the family and on his shoulders lies the farm that theyve just returned to.

Dani meets Court by accident before being formally introduced while swimming. The two are combative but beneath it all you can tell that shes attracted to him, something shes not quite used to and doesnt know how to deal with. An attraction between the two develops but Court knows full well he is too old for Dani. But he might be just the right age for Maureen.

In the middle of this possible romantic triangle are a few other issues to deal with. First off is Abigails pregnancy which comes into question after she trips outside in a storm trying to find Dani who ran off for a midnight swim. Its an event that nearly causes a few rifts in the family. Then there is Court trying to take on the responsibilities of a man while still in high school.

Before the end of the film all issues are resolved. Those resolutions are not easy ones and much pain is involved. What is left to discover before the credits role is just who will come out unscathed?

The movie is a marvel to watch on so many levels. Director Robert Mulligan draws some amazing performances from all involved. His experiences making movies like TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and SUMMER OF 42 show how capable he is and this film just proves that even more. Freddie Francis is the director of photography and he brings to life the slow buzz of bugs in the trees and the slow soft hear of summer to life with each image.

All of the actors involved do a fantastic job. But most impressive is that done by Witherspoon. This is not to slight the other actors involved but the fact that this was her first film, that she went to a casting call hoping to get a minor supporting role and came away with the lead makes her performance all that more amazing. There are moments watching the film when subtle nuances in the look on her face would make you think shed been doing this for ages. Why she was overlooked for an Oscar nomination for this performance is beyond me.

Released in 1991 this movie has never found itself in heavy rotation on movie channels or talked about much. Thats a shame. I found it to be one of the most touching and enjoyable films Ive watched in some time. Hopefully word of mouth will help others to find this film. It deserves more attention than its received. Witherspoon has grown to show what a formidable presence she is and this is the movie that started it all.",1510185600,3,4228,4.31360201511335

459558,3,6302413737,"Review for The Man in the Moon
Hot Toasty Rag, October 24, 2017

If theres any director in Hollywood who deserves a crown for conquering the coming-of-age genre, its Robert Mulligan, director of To Kill a Mockingbird and Summer of 42. His last film was The Man in the Moon, one of the most revered modern coming-of-age films. It takes place in 1957, during the summer a teenaged Reese Witherspoons life changes forever.

In Reeses first movie, shes a tomboy, but shes still adorable in her transition out of adolescence, and as shes done in almost every other film since, she melts the hearts of the audience. She stomps around in overalls and smacks her gum as if it never occurred to her to care about her appearance, but shes just as cute in those scenes as she is when she finally dolls up and tries to act like a regular teenage girl.

Fourteen-year-old Reese is very close to her older sister, Emily Warfield, but clashes at times with her parents, Sam Waterston and Tess Harper, who don't seem to understand her difficult age. When a new family moves in next door, complete with three teenage boys, everything changes. Reese gets to know one of the boys, Jason London, but as time passes, her feelings grow into more than just friendship.

Theres a lot more to the plot, but Id rather not spoil anything. Needless to say, there are all the classic elements to a poignant coming-of-age story, including domestic troubles, love triangles, self-discovery, tragedy, and the bonds of family. Just as in classics like My Girl, you're going to need your Kleenexes during this one. It doesnt matter whether you have issues with your dad, mom, sister, or remember a bittersweet time before you grew up, there are several scenes that will inspire tears. Reese has great chemistry with her onscreen family, and I guarantee the parents in the audience will identify with Sam Waterstons protectiveness and wisdom.

This one isn't for the faint of heart, but if you're in the mood for a good cry this weekend, or if you're craving a nostalgia movie with lots of Elvis Presley songs, rent The Man in the Moon.

Kiddy Warning: I'd probably let my kids watch this one, but I just wanted to warn you, because everyone has different tastes, that there are some upsetting scenes and violence involving children.",1508803200,,2298,4.7325

459560,3,6302413737,"This is as good of a coming of age movie as I can think of.  I think that this is Reese Witherspoon's first movie.  And when I saw this for the first time I was thinking she is going to win an Oscar someday.  She is so good she could have won for this.  She plays a thirteen year old who would rather swim then eat.  And spends most of her time swimming in a creek that runs through the family farm.
An oler boy who is 17 moves into the next farm.  And she soon falls in love.  After a very awkward first encounter.  He meets her older sister and they fall in love.  Which then develops into a rivalry between her and her sister.  This more of a girly move probably but one that everybody can get into.",1505865600,,702,3.95
459648,5,6302413737,"This is probably one of my favorite ""older"" movies. There's quite a few actors/actresses that are in this that are now semi-big in the movie industrial now. So it's always neat to see some of their firsts. It's sad at points, it makes you think. Definitely worth watching at least once, but I'm 25 now, and remember watching this as a child so I just had to buy it for myself to watch again.",1505260800,,391,4.297297297297297

I am so happy I picked this movie out of so many others to purchase that day. Jason London was amazing in it as well. I give this movie a 5 star rating.

When I recommended this movie on Facebook, many 20- and 30-something friends said they had loved this movie as teens. I'm guessing that at that age, they would have seen it as a romance. As a mother, I enjoy the plot more as a coming-of-age movie, where the young love is less of a focus than the relationship between the 14-year-old girl and her 17-year-old sister. Also of interest is the girls' relationships with their mom and their dad. Each character in the movie has a nuanced role, and each actor handles the role sensitively and believably. What's more, the setting is lovely but is not too romanticized (the home looks realistic). I highly recommend this film for most ages.",1485993600,5,788,4.717391304347826

460105,5,6302413737,"A very good script and a very good movie, albeit a tear-jerker.  Director Robert Mulligan obviously recognized star-quality in Reese Witherspoon, because he provides plenty of close-ups.  I've watched this movie several times, and she never fails to keep my attention.  She is truly a fresh and lively presence in this movie.  There was no doubt in my mind that she would become a Star.  Sam Waterston does an excellent job.  I'm not a big fan of Tess Harper, but she was okay in this role.  Emily Warfield as the older sister, a beautiful young actress, also did an excellent job, but frankly fades in scenes with Reese.  Finally, Jason London is great as Court.  Apparently, Sam Waterston liked him, too, because they get paired up later in ""I'll Fly Away-Then and Now"", the made-for-TV sequel to the TV series ""I'll Fly Away"", in which his twin brother, Jeremy, played the role of Waterston's son.",1485129600,3,900,4.754838709677419

460233,5,6302413737,"Quite a good coming of age story, the movie in the opening credits has ""Introducing Reece Witherspoon"" who plays Dani, a 14 year old girl.  For a first film her acting is really good.  Throw in the fact she has to do a partial nude scene at that age adding to the pressure. Interesting the older characters who take their clothes off at times never nude up so you've got to wonder why she had to.  Not that you see anything, but still that's pretty brave for a fourteen year old or however close to that she was in real life.

This is a coming of age film, of a farm girl in the 1950s, who is a tomboy, but really into Elvis in a liking him type of way, who then has a run in with a 17 year old (Jason London) when she's trespassing and skinny dipping on his farm.  Of course she doesn't like him at first but that of course changes pretty quickly.  But being 14, the 17 year old doesn't want to go places beyond friendship she not only wants to but dreams and talks about what it will be like with her older sister.  The sister who has had to fend of a creepy father of her date who wants to visit her when she moves away to school, as well as a date who expects certain things, will further complicate matters.  As will her father and his belt (Sam Waterston a couple of years later would become instantly recognisable as one of Law and Order's two equally important groups).  Her mother is also heavily pregnant with another sibling.

The storyline seemed to forget about the creepy father and his son parts which is a shame as I would have liked to have seen Sam Waterston bring out the belt on those that deserved it, rather than just a 14 year old who didn't do anything other than get caught out in the rain with her mother overreacting and getting into peril.",1483401600,,1767,4.201183431952662

This film is a nostalgic return to an innocent time of running through open fields, swimming holes, picnics, Sundays when you ""go to church"" followed by chicken dinners with relatives, and dreams shared between sisters on the screened in porch while gazing at the moon. Yes, as said before, it is a ""coming of age"" film, introducing Reese Witherspoon with an excellent cast including Sam Waterston, and directed by Robert Mulligan of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" fame. Two sisters have their dreams, share heartbreak and tragedy,  and grow just a little bit older in the process. The story is both bittersweet and lovely with a score that sets a perfect tone. All of a sudden, I have the urge to return to those days...to visit with relatives long gone..to catch fireflies in a jar,  and drink sweet tea on the porch while gazing at the moon.",1464220800,,953,4.734939759036145

460313,5,6302413737,"The Man in the Moon is a very special movie that I've held close to my heart.  I remember seeing it in the theater when I was only 12.  The movie perfectly captures the human experience between 2 sisters who whose love for each other is temporarily compromised by the passion they share for a boy.  The boy inevitably falls for the older sister who's similar in age and the younger is left heartbroken and betrayed.  Yet there was so much more.  The transcending quality of this movie is that it captures so many perspectives and experiences from other characters who share in this summertime drama.  It captures the loving father who's must help his daughters reconcile after the boys tragic death. The older mother who in her youth also experienced what it was like to be 1 of 2 girls that a boy had to choose whom to love.  Her historical perspective from this past experience proved that 2 women can still be good friends after the choice is made, and this message foreshadows her daughters experience too.  And lastly it captures the experience for a teenage boy who must take care if his mother, and younger brothers after his father suddenly dies.  As he juggles his overwhelming adult responsibilities he tries to maintain a mere friendship with a younger girl who personally feels much more.  The overwhelming love he feels for the older sister is conflicted by his guilt in knowing that his friend will ultimately feel betrayed.

There are many aspects of this movie that one can appreciate.  The movie wasn't predictable and I was surprised by several turns that it took.  Best of all, I personally think that what makes this movie magical is how at the ending there is no clear antagonist, or protagonist.  In real life one is loved by many and also hated by others.  A simple minded movie would lead one to believe that a villain always remains a bad person forever.  However, real life is much more complex. When a story patiently captures each characters perspective it transcends at that point to more closely resembling real-life.  I think each person who watches this movie will take away something a little different from it.  In my youth I identified best with the young girl because I too was not chosen by someone who I cared deeply for.  Later as an adult I identify much more with the father.  I only wish more people gave this timeless work the attention it truly deserves.",1462320000,,2398,4.664285714285715

It presents a culture with a strong father and family oriented mother, polite children, and a favorite swimming hole. Reese was a young girl when this movie was filmed and steals your heart with her first experience at falling in love. The entire cast was very well picked for their roles giving the viewer an overall picture of what life was like during that time.

It's an old school text for a bygone era that sends ripples forever into the future. As Breton said of Cesaire: It bears that unmistakable major tone that separates greater from lesser.

TMITM is simple and beautiful, and also a throwback, perhaps an ode, to a Hollywood that has also given way to something else. Its filmmaking is so pure, that at times I felt like someone standing there, observing life flow.

Perhaps the best thing about Mulligan's triumph is that you feel better for having seen it. A door opens within yourself as you watch the river of life flow by; you walk through and the universe opens up.

This movie is magnificent.",1442707200,,770,4.647058823529412

Her Dani is young, slovenly, natural, uncouth, and a tomboy, and she totally enraptures.  She falls in love (apparently for the first time) with a neighbor's boy.

Dani's first kiss is worthy of memory.  Court/Jason London kisses her to be nice, and though Danni is smitten, he falls in love with Dani's older sister, Maureen/Emily Warfield.

This film is a tragedy but it is Dani who will grow.

The performances are gentle and perfect.  Aided by Sam Waterston and Tess Harper.  Great film.",1439942400,,638,4.943396226415095

461102,5,6302413737,"The Man In the Moon really IS a classic like everyone says!  While honestly this film isn't intended for people like me (mid 30's male) what the film does accurately capture is the seriousness of a relationship, the emotional rollercoaster rides when things don't go smoothly, learning about love by way of figuring out the best kissing/making out techniques and knowing how to be intimate with another person, and loving and supporting your family and siblings no matter what happens.  The Man In the Moon is indeed a classic.  I'm totally surprised the younger daughter, the star of the movie, is played by Reese Witherspoon.  I didn't even realize it was her until the movie was over and I went online to read some reviews, lol.

Sam Waterston, who I know from his lengthy and successful Law & Order career, does a wonderful job playing the role of a strict father since he always knows what's best for his family (especially concerning his mischievous daughter who likes to venture off late at night by the lake to go swimming with a 17-year old boy played by Jason London).  He eventually loosens up and shows a compassionate side when the situation calls for it.  I'm so used to seeing him in a courtroom however, that watching him portray a demanding father in a small Louisiana country house by the fields is rather different.

I actually agree with the people who think the Man In the Moon is a perfect counterpart to Stand By Me, but this time involving teenage girls and their struggles instead of boys.  The two movies need to be watched back to back in my opinion, to really understand how teenage behavior functions.

Anyway the acting is absolutely awesome.  If the storyline doesn't grab you (which is crazy in itself since it most certainly should) the phenomenal acting jobs of the two daughters (the other daughter played by the attractive Emily Warfield), the father, the mother, the teenage boy that both daughters fall in love with WILL totally blow your mind.  The way the two sisters bond throughout the movie and go through several different types of emotions such as jealousy, hatred, love and compassion is really realistic I think, though I don't have any daughters nor have any experience in that area so I could be wrong.  The two sisters bond and contemplate/daydream quite often while learning what it's like to figure out how to deal with the crushes they develop.  The story gets heated when they both fall in love with the same boy, and I can't reveal what happens after this.  The final 20 minutes shouldn't be spoiled for any reason.

Overall, just an amazing movie on so many levels.  Once again a movie like the Man in the Moon proves that all you need in order to tell a story is a simple well-written plot.",1406937600,,2747,4.6777546777546775
461103,5,6302413737,"Necessarily one of the great ones. It's a professionally-woven screenplay of simpler (?) times with classic complicating matters of the family and of the heart.

461199,4,6302413737,"Fourteen-year-old Dani Trant (Reese Witherspoon) is at that awkward age that every female must go through. Part of Dani still savors the joys she's always known, such as running around the family's rural Louisiana farm in ragged shorts and t-shirts, and going swimming in the old quarry. But there's another part of her that longs to be grown up, to wear makeup and have boys stare at her admiringly -- just the way they do at Dani's 17-year-old sister Maureen (Emily Warfield).

Then a new boy comes to town and changes everything. Court Foster (Jason London) is quickly befriended by both Trant sisters. Yet it's Maureen that's closer to Court in age, and thus the one he'd seriously consider as girlfriend.

Naturally, Dani is furious -- and beneath that, hurt and jealous. Why does Maureen get *everything*?! She gets along well with their parents, she's so beautiful, and she's about to go off to college (not so common for a rural Southern girl in 1957). For all that anyone cares about Dani, she may as well be an equal of their toddler sister Marie.

Yet as the summer progresses -- and tragedy rocks their quiet complacent life -- that Dani truly begins to understand a little about life. No matter what may appear on the surface, there is no one without questions or suffering on the inside, and the further into adulthood she goes, the worse it will get. But, as Dani also begins to see, the true hallmark of adulthood is how a person chooses to react to what happens in her life, and how she supports those around her as they experience their own hardships.

Tess Harper and Sam Waterston also star as the girls' parents, Abigail and Sam Trant.

While the story being told here is simple and in no way extraordinary, it somehow manages to become complex for just those reasons. Like real life, this quiet summer of 1957 has the power to change a family's lives forever, just by a single event and the ripples of the events that churn out from it. Whether viewers are currently struggling with the transition from child to young adult like Dani, or reminiscing on years past, all are guaranteed to enjoy this thought-provoking film.",1390694400,,2143,4.6888297872340425

I rented again when I was ten (Once again, on VHS) and I have to admit, I have seen alot that I have missed. Then I had rented (For the third time) with free movies on demand while babysitting for my next door neighbor's dog. And last year, I had finally bought the DVD for my mom, and as far as I know, she is really enjoying it. A Tearjerker? Yes it is. The ending had me in tears, and I think it is a great coming of age movie. I don't even remember this movie being played in the theaters when it came out. It is a keeper. Peter Smith

461232,5,6302413737,"Director Robert Mulligan sure has a gift when it comes to capturing emotional realism on film. He demonstrated this with previous films like ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" and ""Summer of 42."" Of course there are many talents behind a successful story that's told with film, but ultimately it all falls on the director to combine all the elements and make it work, and this man is extraordinary in that capacity.
As with ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" Mulligan has extracted an exceptional ""ensemble performance"" from a gifted cast. The small roles are just as important as the larger ones, and every word in every scene really counts. The cast in ""The Man in the Moon"" clearly understood this, so every character here matters. This particular cast had amazing chemistry, and were utterly believable and convincing from first scene to the last. Five minutes into the film and you, the viewer, have been pulled into this family's world and are invited to stay for awhile and experience life with them. This is not an easy task to accomplish, yet Mulligan makes it all so seem so effortless. This film rolls along at such a perfect pace, and every scene is so immaculately shot, that it literally puts you there and you truly become emotionally involved.
The entire cast are incredibly splendid, but I really must single out Reese Witherspoon. Just as Mary Badham became 'Scout' in To Kill a Mockingbird, here Reese becomes Dani Trant. This child's performance is simply natural, believable and hugely impressive.
Mulligan must have supernatural gifts when it comes to directing children and teens,  because his resume boasts some of the best young performances ever committed to film.
Also of note are the small nuances of the characters and the painfully accurate attention paid to the smallest details all throughout the film.
The actual story here is a true slice-of-life tale. It's fun, funny, warm, sad, heartbreaking, inspiring .... again, it's about life, and it's beautifully served to you on a platter by a wonderful director who keeps it real.
If you like believable cinema about life, then I would highly recommend this gentle masterpiece. I refuse to call it a ""hidden gem"" or an ""over-looked good film,"" because it is truly a flat-out masterpiece of realism in cinema. These type of films are rare, especially at this level of perfection, so do give it a try.
If you enjoy this type of film, which concerns strong and realistic stories about family and friends, then I would also highly recommend ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape,"" ""The Station Agent,"" ""Stand By Me,"" ""The Sandlot,"" ""Sling Blade,"" and ""Raggedy Man"" for starters.",1375833600,2,2624,4.950113378684807

Never have I been able to actually convince myself that I could smell the coolness of summer skin after a swim in the pond, or taste iced water in a hot field from more than just my memory.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough not only for adults but especially for those in the young bloom of life.  Reese Witherspoon is perfectly cast as the coltish 14 year old just on the verge of young womanhood.  And who cannot love Sam Waterston?

461266,5,6302413737,"This was Reese Witherspoon's first movie role, she was 14 and already shows remarkable talent.  I have always loved both Tess Harper and Sam Waterston and their roles in this movie are wonderful as was Emily Warfield and newcomer Jason London.  This is a beautiful movie set in an era when times were simpler.

The story is set in 1957 in rural Louisiana, in a time where family values were prevalent and children were brought up with manners.  The Trant's are loving parents, but they expect their children to follow their rules, which include doing chores and using words like, mam and sir when addressing them or other adults and saying please and thank you.  At 14, Dani is on the cusp of being a young woman, but she has a tendency to run to the pond on hot summer days instead of helping with more of the chores.  Mother, Abigail is pregnant with what her husband prays is his long awaited son to join their three daughters. Maureen the eldest daughter is 17 and she is both beautiful and smart.  This is her last summer at home, as she has an academic scholarship to attend Duke in the fall.

One of my favorite scenes occurs early in the movie.  Maureen is going to a dance, her father wants her to put a sweater over her dress, and she tells him, ""I don't have anything that goes with my dress.""  He then tells her to change dresses, but lets her wear the dress when he sees his wife shaking her head and mouthing the word no.  He then proceeds to tell her date that he is responsible for his daughter for the time they are out, he expects her home on time, and no excuses will be acceptable.  Neither teen makes any objections, plead to be allowed to stay out later or act unhappy of disapproving about the restrictions placed on their date.  Parents were obeyed without questions or arguments.  Dating was a privilege and young men were expected to follow the rules your parents set and to treat you with respect.

When the Foster family moves back to their farm after their father dies they resume the friendship that started when the adults were teenagers.  Court is the oldest at 17 and the 2 other twin boys are 9 (I think).  Court is struggling trying to work the farm while his mother works in a factory to support the family.  The pond that Dani swims in is part of the Foster family's property and they first meet when Court jumps in and surprises Dani, who is skinny-dipping.  They immediately start fighting and Dani leaves after making Cort turn around so he will not see her as she retrieves her clothes.  She has no idea that he is part of the family that will be joining them for dinner later that evening.  What follows is a beautiful, heart-warming story of a young girl experiencing her first love only to find that not only does he not feel the same way but he has fallen in love with her sister.  Maureen has not just been a sister to Dani; she has been her best friend. Both girls will have their first experience with both love and broken hearts.  In the end, it is their strong sense of family and its love that allows Dani to forgive what she feels as Maureens's betrayal as they comfort and support each other.

I am not sure why this movie wasn't better received when it was released but I am happy that we can buy it to watch and enjoy.  I first saw this film when it appeared on one of the cable channels and loved the movie.  The next time I convinced my teenage daughter to watch it with me and she loved it as much as I did.  It became one of our favorite movies.  It was the only movie besides Titanic that she watched more than once.  Miranda did not like watching TV she considered it a waste of time and would rather have been doing things with her friends instead.  Watching this movie with her is one of my cherished memories.",1359590400,,3773,4.348571428571429

The clothes, cars and setting were very realistic and brought me back to a time/era where life was much simpler and children were respectful because that was how they were raised.  One thing I kept wondering was how it was so hot outside and there were never any mosquitos. Otherwise, it was very believable and brought you into to the 50's as though you had lived it.  It was a very touching story and the ending was quite unexpected. This made it more real because as we all know life isn't always a fairytale.

461321,5,6302413737,"Everyone can remember that one moment in time from which we despised the opposite sex and viewed them as ""gross"" or ""disgusting"" to the moment when we fall hopelessly in love.  Often, this occurs so quickly that we don't realize or even understand what has just happened.  There is no rational explanation for a young teenager who suddenly finds him/herself in love.  The body reacts in new ways that are foreign, exciting, and confusing.  Young teens often resist these feelings at first because they are now in completely new territory.

Dani is a 14-year-old girl (brilliantly played in her debut role by Reese Witherspoon) who lies in bed listening to the man of her dreams on a record player: Elvis.  She has posters of Elvis all over her side of the bedroom.  She is at that viable age when she's asked to take on more responsibilities around the house, but runs off to her favorite swimming hole on hot summer days.  It is at this age that Dani is in the transition of moving from a young girl to a young woman.  It is a confusing time that brings more questions than answers.

Dani looks up to her older sister, Maureen, who is seventeen.  She often asks Maureen about the future.  Maureen is an attractive young woman who is planning to take her academic talents to Duke.  Maureen is also confused, but she is more worried about the unknowns that loom in the future.  Maureen is a romantic.  She has had limited experience with boys, who all have eyes for her, but she is waiting for that one boy to come in and sweep her off of her feet.  She views life and love through her windows of idealism.

The irony with both girls is that while Maureen tries her best to explain to Dani what being in love is like, what the strange feelings are, how to kiss a boy, etc., she, herself, has never really been in love either.  It is likely she has had infatuations and crushes, but with boys who just never live up to her expectations.  Billy Sanders, her current date, is borderline despicable in the way he treats her, or rather, mistreats her.

Enter Court Foster, a young boy who is Maureen's age, who moves into a neighboring farm with his widowed mother and two little brothers.  He is a hard-working boy who has more or less assumed the fatherly role.  He works at the run-down farm all day trying to get it repaired and up-and-running.  Court inadvertently runs into Dani while she is skinny-dipping at her swimming hole.  At first, they don't like each other much, but it isn't long before Dani can't think of anyone else.  However, the three-year gap is more than enough for the viewer to realize that, while Court is very fond of Dani, it is hard to conceive of anything ever growing from it.

Dani suffers from being nave and inexperienced, which is natural for her age.  Court finally meets Maureen, and from the get-go, it is clear much to Dani's dismay, that they are attracted to each other.  Dani doesn't take it well, and she views it more of a betrayal on Maureen's part than Court's.  After all, Maureen knew of Dani's feelings toward Court, even though Court explains to Maureen that he just doesn't feel the same way, even though he is very fond of Dani.  Before long Maureen and Court are falling deeply in love.

The story takes place in the late 50s, when minding and obeying your parents was the way of life.  Matthew and Abigail Trant are strict but loving parents.  Matthew does not tolerate any kind of back-talk or questioning from his children.  The kids have jobs and chores to do, and they are expected to do them without complaint.  Even communication holds a strict d&eacute;cor as the kids are expected to always address their parents as ""sir"" or ""ma'am.""

Sam Waterston is simply magnificent as Matthew Trant.  This is my favorite role of his.  He portrayed Matthew as a complex, discipline-minded father who also loves his children.  Tess Harper is equally effective as Abigail.

Robert Mulligan, the director, is known for taking on realistic projects, often involving some kind of teen angst in which a teen is growing and experiencing new feelings for the first time.  He also directed ""Summer of `42"" which was also a story about a young boy falling in love with a woman who was older than he was.  As with that film, we find that as a teen, there is no explanation for these feelings.  They happen, and it doesn't matter how illogical or irrational those feelings may be.  Most people, I have found, have experienced this at some point.  Dani also falls into this category.  She is too young to date, as her father points out, and she often has no idea how to effectively express her feelings toward Court, but she tries nonetheless.

Something occurs within the realm of the story that I will not divulge here for anyone who has not seen this film.  It is important that the viewer's reaction be genuine.  While the story may appear to be about young love (and much of the story is about that), the heart is actually in the power and the bond between sisters.  Matthew Trant points out to Dani, ""You and Maureen are going to be sisters for a long time.""  Young love can often test the bonds of any other relationship because within the eyes of the beholder, nothing else matters, and no one else matters as much as the object of your affection.  Remember those high school days when a friend began a relationship with someone and you hardly ever heard from the person again?  Young love, especially first-time love, is often so overwhelming that you cannot think of anyone else.

The Man in the Moon handles the relationships aspects with frightening realism and accuracy.  Perhaps that is why so many people can relate to the characters in this film because most of us have been there and experienced what these two sisters experience from the standpoint of first love.",1342483200,,5813,4.596695821185617
461322,5,6302413737,"I bought this movie as a VHS years ago to watch with my daughter and just had to have it in DVD format. It's one of Reese Witherspoon's first movies and she's adorable in it. A great cast which includes Sam Waterston who plays her stern but loving father, and Tess Harper as her sympathetic mother.

For all the women out there. . . remember your first crush. The one that made your heart beat fast and your head feel so light that sometimes you thought you might faint. You waited and waited for that first kiss, and when it finally happened you were so-o-o sure that it was true love and would last forever. This movie will take you back to that time and you'll feel your face flush and your heart beat fast again. But keep a hankie close by. Trust me, you'll need it.",1340755200,2,770,4.238095238095238
461323,4,6302413737,"When I was dating my now wife, she made me watch this movie.  I was not thrilled.  I was sixteen.  This looked like a chick flick, and even more so, this looked like a little girl's movie.  I will admit, I spaced out through most of it anyways.  It held no interest with me.

Years later, I have a very different reaction to this film.

`The Man in the Moon' tells the coming of age story of a young fourteen year old girl named Dani, living in Louisiana during the 1950's.  Dani has an older sister, Maureen, who has captured the eye of Court, a young man who Dani happens to have a severe crush on.  As Dani makes herself a `friend' of Court, she becomes supremely jealous of his affections toward her sister, but it isn't as easy has `first crush syndrome'.  No, `The Man in the Moon' gets a little deeper than that.

Watching this as an adult, I am drawn to the beautiful way in which Dani is fleshed out as a real, true, complete character.  Reese Witherspoon delivers quite possibly her finest performance to date (seriously, she is outstanding here).  The way she pulls out of Dani so much passion is remarkable.  The rest of the cast, from Sam Waterston to Jason London is exception in their roles, but it is Witherspoon that carries this film on her shoulders and does so with such commanding ferocity.

This is not a mere kid's movie (in fact, certain scenes take this out of that `genre' entirely) and this is not just for the girls.  Young boys may not appreciate this, but this is certainly a film that stands on its own and deserves to be seen.",1340236800,,1558,4.357638888888889
461324,5,6302413737,"The Man in the Moon is one gem of a movie. The cover picture suggests that it is a merely a teen romance story, but it is much, much more than that.
It is the story of true family bonds made and broken; of gracefulness, loss, gain, loyalty, truth, growth and genuine love in every sense of the word. Reese Witherspoon, who was just a young girl when this was filmed, dazzles with an acting range that is genuinely amazing. The rest of the cast is stellar as well and the natural scenery, costumes, automobiles and aura of this movie all make one yearn for the gentle but long lost, simpler, more innocent days gone by.

Don't miss ""The Man in the Moon"". It is a classic, emotional film that will stay with you long after the final credits roll. You'll want to see it again and again.",1339459200,3,783,4.29054054054054

How close the movie follows her real life experiences, I cannot say, but I think perhaps very similiar. I knew the farm family portrayed in the film and the most dramatic event of the movie was based on a real life event.

I love Sam Waterston as the father (actually, in everything he does) and Tess Harper is wonderful as the mom (and very believable).  The story is set on a farm, and it reminds me of simpler times, like those spent at a summer cottage.

Court then meets Dani's older sister Maureen who has been longing for a love that is real. The sisters experience betrayal, tragedy and rapprochement in the course of the story and the message of forgiveness and love is affecting.

Other reviewers have aptly explained the endearing and tender quality of the movie and its players.  No need to cover that ground again; it is all true.  The only thing I would like to suggest is that you treat yourself to a Saturday evening on the sofa with someone that understands and appreciates a quiet story of the heart.

It's not like when she was a kid and could tell her problems to the Man in the Moon and he'd solve them.  Things change forever for Dani when a handsome boy moves in next door; she falls for him completely, but he has eyes for her big sister.

Reese Witherspoon made her film debut in this movie and she gives a wonderfully self-assured performance.  She's part tomboy and all hormones and the combination is adorable and pure star quality.  The movie is ably directed by Robert Mulligan who brought us ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" and like it, this tender coming-of-age story is honest, spirited, and quite touching.

Her talent and screen presence are obvious, even at her young age in this one. Reese plays Dani, the younger of two teenage sisters who both fall in love with the same boy. He likes the imaginative, dreamy little girl, but only as a friend -- especially after he meets her pretty, popular, and capable older sister, who is about his age. Dani is heartbroken, but her mother's difficult pregnancy, a new baby, and then, a horrible tragedy overshadow her own feelings and unltimately help bring her closer to her sister.

It's unusual these days to find a film that you could feel good about watching with your kids. The accident scene in this one would be too disturbing for small children (though it's not at all sensationalized, thank goodness). But kids 10 and older would enjoy this film, and so would their parents.

Not even the grisly shockers could save this film. The dialogue clunks along, so obvious and pedestrian. A young Reese Witherspoon does a nice job of playing a young girl trying out what it means to be a woman. However, her character never gets very far beyond a caricature of Precocious Tomboyish 14-year-old Little Sister. It's not the fault of the acting. It's the dialogue. It's so saccharine and false it's a parody of itself. I paraphrase:

""O Maureen, I cant wait to grow up! and O Maureen, you're the smartest, prettiest girl in school! ALL the boys fall all over themselves when you walk by!""

It's an older generation's fantasy of their own childhood sentiments.

OK, so the plot: she has a perfect older sister, and theres a strapping young farming lad who lives close by...etc. etc. Sound familiar? It should. Despite a cheap plot twist, the movie ends pretty much where you think it will.

461460,5,6302413737,"I saw this movie as a teenager and immediately identified with Reese Witherspoon's portrayal of Dani Trant, a 14-year-old tomboy in rural Louisiana circa 1957. She feels that she will never be as beautiful as her older sister, Maureen (a now rarely seen Emily Warfield), and feeling out of place in terms of her conservative Baptist upbringing. Then seventeen year old Court Foster (Jason London), the son of her mother's close friend (Gail Strickland) moves in next door, Dani experiences her first crush, while Court enjoys her company, and willful spirit. Dani succeeds in getting her first kiss from him, but as soon as he sees Maureen, he falls head over heels for her, leaving Dani behind. The sisters' close bond is fractured severely by the rivalry that erupts, which only deepens when Court dies in a tragic accident. The girls then are made to realize how much they need each other.

Sam Waterson and Tess Harper are just perfect as the loving parents, trying to balance their daughters' individuality, at the same time trying to keep the family together. The beautiful cinematography, and the wonderful soundtrack featuring Elvis Presley, The Platters and many more contribute wonderfully to the film's atmosphere of a simpler time.

A touching coming-of-age film with a timeless message.",1145059200,6,1299,5.093896713615023
461461,3,6302413737,"Sam Waterston is wonderful, and Reese Witherspoon foreshadows her later brilliant film career. The best scene in the film is one between the two of them, when she apologizes to him for his ""taking the strap"" to her and he, her father, comes around to the other side of the car and takes her in his arms even though he cannot make eye contact. Wow -- only an iceberg would not have a tissue in hand here.

Unfortunately, the film milks the melodrama a little too vigorously. The first half is interesting, restrained if sentimental, but it raises serious questions about the loyalty to family in the arena of passion. In the second half, the film-makers simply pull out all the stops and to a fault. I don't want to spoil the plot, but let me just say that the final scene -- which ""unites"" two estranged characters prone over a grave -- is simply too much.

The film has potential, but gives it over to emotionalism. Hey, even we chicks have our standards!

461462,3,6302413737,"Sam Waterston plays a father that is a dying breed.  He actually disciplines his 1957 teen daughters with the strap if necessary.  And he'll decide if it's necessary.  Not that dad isn't a softy inside for his daughters; he is.  Loving your young daughters is sweet and The Man In the Moon captures these timeless moments and delivers a nice coming of age film with 14 year-old Reese Witherspoon showing some early sass.

Being alone with a handsome neighbor at the old watering hole can make a young girl's heart flutter.  She may take chances.  Older sister Maureen is taking some chances too of a more adult kind.  The town is a white version of 50's Southern shtick, and we wished we could see more of the folks that inhabit this Louisiana backwater, but the film mainly stays focused on the melodrama of mom's pregnancy, the dad's anger around the boyfriends, and the girl's single-minded yearnings for true love.

Directors like Ford, Hawks, Lubitsch or Vidor and Capra are long gone, and so is cinema as art, but a few movies like this one seem to resurrect it, although it may only last a blink of an eye.

Lovable little gem.",1121817600,3,536,4.174757281553398
461465,5,6302413737,"This poignant and tender coming of age story is a small but beautiful film many have not had the opportunity to see. It is set in rural Louisiana during the 1950's and is beautifully photographed and filled with love and tenderness. The focal point of director Robert Mulligan's fine film is a very young Reese Witherspoon. The story of first love and the tragedy that follows will touch you in a way you'll remember for a long time.

Sam Waterson is the kind and gentle husband and father who knows his two daughters are growing up faster than he can blink and has one more on the way. Tess Harper has another fine turn as his loving wife Abigail. There is a very human and peaceful feel to this film that works its way into your heart slowly and remains there long after the closing credits.

Dani (Reese Witherspoon) is the spunky but tender-hearted 14 year old younger sister who is beginning to cross the waters from child to young womanhood. Her adolescent crush on Elvis Presley changes to something real when 17 year old Court Foster (Jason London) enters the picture. They both like to swim in the lake and become something more than friends but something less than a couple. Their relationship is handled in such a sweet and thoughtful manner you find youself embracing this film with your heart early on.

But as much as Court cares about her she is too young for him and when chance brings he and her older sister Maureen (Emily Wakefield) together nature takes its course and someone's heart is bound to break. This is a good and loving family and Dani and her older sister Maureen are close. They bicker as sisters do but Dani secretly worships Maureen and wants to be like her. Maureen loves Dani just as much but can't pass up the love of her life no matter how hard she might try.

Court is also portrayed as a very decent kid with the weight of the world on his shoulders who is trying to do the right thing and still be happy. Everthing about this feels real, as there are no good guys and bad guys, just a truthful portrait of young love and growing up. Witherspoon is amazing and you can truly feel her heart breaking as she begins to disappear, only her memories of the lake and her first kiss to comfort her.

It will take even more than a tragedy to bring Dani and Maureen back together and it is the wise and gentle father who takes Dani fishing and talks to her in a way every father hopes he will talk to his daughter under similar circumstances. Everyone is wonderful in this fine film and I am amazed it is not more widely known. It is truly something special.

I will not reveal what happens in the last part of this film but at the beginning we find Dani and Maureen talking on their front porch about ""The Man in the Moon."" Their mother always told them when they were young to tell their troubles to him and just keep talking untill they were all gone. Both Dani and Maureen discover when things are bleakest that ""The Man in the Moon"" is truly each other.

This film is bittersweet and heartrending. It is a wonderful find and different from just about anything else you will see on the subject matter. It is a film you'll want to own and watch over and over.",1116806400,59,3193,4.392554991539763
461466,5,6302413737,"This pastoral study of life and love in the rural South in the late 1950s isn't totally fresh and it lacks dramatic punch in certain spots, but the young Reese Witherspoon, in her first acting role, yanks the movie into the heavens with her performance. All this talented Louisiana/Tennesee girl lacks is a noticable Southern accent.

Special mention should also go to director Robert Mulligan and his crew for the beautiful visuals, and actors Sam Waterston, Gail Strickland and Ernie Lively.",1102809600,4,493,5.08641975308642
461490,4,6302413737,"This much admired 1991 sleeper is noteworthy for several reasons.  It introduced the remarkable young actress Reese Witherspoon to the viewing public--or at least that portion of the viewing public that bothered to see it.  It also made a for a successful (de facto) ""coming of age"" trilogy for director Robert Mulligan, among whose previous successes were TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD and THE SUMMER OF '42.  It also had beautiful, evocative cinematography by Freddie Francis.

And it gets its 1950s feel just about right (although I did find myself asking, ""Did 14 year olds really say 'WHATEVER' in 1957?"")

The story is simple and sweet.  Young girl meets slightly older boy, who in turn falls for her older sister.  Sibling rivalry for the affections of a third party is a tale older than Childe Ballads, but the intelligent script and sensitive direction makes MAN IN THE MOON something special.  For the first hour or so, the film hits nary a false note.

And then it did--at least for me.  I don't like to second guess any narrative development, but I found the film's ending a bit of a let-down.  (SPOILER WARNING!)  The fact that the girls' heated rivalry for their neighbor's affection is interrupted by tragedy, a tragedy that ultimately leads to their reconciliation, seems almost too easy dramatically.  Or maybe it's just too rushed.  Fourteen year old Dani's flirtation with the older neighbor Court proceeds almost languidly, but his torrid romance with older sister Maureen takes up maybe 15 minutes of screen time.  Court's demise is premature in more ways than one.

I would have preferred to see the older teens' relationship detailed more.  Maureen's loss might have ultimately have seemed more profound then.  One can argue of course that at 17, a brief relationship can have all the force and drama of longstanding affair.  Agreed, but how long did the two star crossed lovers actually have.  A day and a half?  The dramatic possibilities of their love and the sisters' rivalry are ultimately curbed.

It's an arguable point, and knowing me, should I re-view this film in a month or so, I'll likely find that it flows perfectly and wonder what the heck I was complaining about.  Still I hope other admirers of this movie will understand when I say that I probably just a bit frustrated because I wanted the movie to be a little longer.  I think they might agree that it would be nice to get to know these wonderful characters a little better.

While Reese Witherspoon deserves the attention her debut role brought her, it should probably be mentioned that ALL the performances are spot on.  You expect as much from veterans Tess Harper and Sam Waterston, but the other young actors are also remarkable.  Jason London projects both the ease and the awkwardness of a seventeen year old just growing into his own body.  Emily Warfield, who unfortunately seems to have no screen credits since 1995, is equally good as the remarkably self-aware and poised Maureen.

And if they ever wanted to make a sequel, I'd recommend following up with the story of Court's mom played beautifully by Gail Strickland.  She's one character I wanted to know more about.  Losing both her husband and her son in separate farm accidents within a short span of time would, of course, be devastating.  But Strickland projects such strength and steely reserve that one can only imagine that her continuing story would be fascinating.",1099440000,16,3423,4.868512110726644
461491,5,6302413737,"This is my favourite film of all time and I don't think any film can compete with this masterpeice.
As a fourteen year old myself, I understood right off where Dani's character was coming from and how she was feeling. At the same time I also understood how Maureen was feeling as well (but not as much as I felt for dani).
The story takes place in a beautiful setting in 1957 in louisiana in the country during the summer. When a neighbour, court foster moves near dani and maureen's house the two sisters both awfully close at the start of the movie, start riviling over a boy and aren't close at all afterwards.
Then after something very terrible happens and brings me to tears each time I watch it during the last half hour, the two sisters realize no mater what happens they still are sisters and must love each other.
My favourite scene in the entire film and makes me break down and cry each time and I watch this movie a lot, is the graveyard scene.
[it's REALLY hard not to contain spoilers for this scene and I'm going to tell a few]
The scene is where dani is walking from the pond to go to  ____'s grave and she sees from a distance, maureen holding flowers about to put them down near the gravestone and as just as she reaches over to place them she starts sobbing and coallapses onto the dirt and we see dani forming tears into her eyes. Then she walks over to maureen and despite saying she will never forgive her she sits down near maureen lifts her head onto her lap and starts rubbing her back saying ""it's okay"" and tears are falling off of her face. Maureen bawls into dani's lap.
That scene does it for me and is the emotional trigger for the entire film.",1090022400,2,1675,4.300632911392405
461492,5,6302413737,"As of this review this film has 75 reviews and a 4.9 cummulative rating.  If that is not enough to make somebody at least rent this film...  This is the style of film that harkens back to the days when a good script, solid acting, and inspired direction was all any studio needed to have a great film.  This film has a fantastic coming-of-age tale set in 1950s Louisiana and is so often absolutely believable that I felt transported, even nostalgic for a time in which I was never even alive.  Director Robert Mulligan, most famous for directing ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" has such a light, fluid touch with camera angles and complex panning sequences that it feels almost organic.  The movie practically flows through you as you watch it.  Then there are the splendid acting performances.  Sam Waterston, a favorite actor of mine since ""The Killing Fields,"" gives the whole package here from wit and strength to fear and being at a total loss for words when intense situations occur.  Tess Harper has a more limited role, serving as a strong foundation as the mother and wife, but when the scene calls for it she shines accordingly.  Jason London has some splendid scenes, particularly with both Reese Witherspoon and Emily Warfield who play sisters who both fall in love with the young man.  Reese Witherspoon is very impressive here for being so young.  Oftentimes, young actors are so mature for their ages that they have forgotten how to behave like a kid.  Reese is exceptional here!  Then there is Emily Warfield.  Let me just quote Reese's character by saying, ""You're so pretty that it hurts!""  She is amazingly beautiful and uses so much subtlety in her performance that when she has to completely breakdown near the end it is truly visceral.  There is so much said by all these character actors with exceptional facial expression and outstanding emotional rapport with one another, that by the time the story takes a tragic turn leaving the viewer stunned and wiping away tears, one cannot help but care about every character that remains.  Most of the scenes leading up to the emotional ending are light-hearted and endearing, which in turn adds to the impact of an incredibly sad ending.  Have some tissues handy.  I've seen this film four times and even though I am prepared in mind for what I know will happen, I am blinking away tears and wiping my face repeatedly every time.  But no ending in any character film I've ever seen can be sad if the viewer doesn't care about the characters and what they are doing througout the story.  The price for this sparkling gem is spectacular!  If you have a penchant for great acting and all around solid filmmaking then look no further than this endearing and ultimately heartwrenching film.

The acting is top notch, but I think the more subtle elements such as cinematography, lighting, settings, and music also helped to make it a hit as well.  This movie is one of the few that seems to really pay attention to small details.  There were a few scenes where things were absolutely quiet except for the subtle sound of bugs in the background....reminisent of a hot summer day/evening in the deep  south.

(We all have wasted hours of our lives watching absolute dogs because some overpaid windbag was in it.)  But this is a great story and you won't care who the ""stars"" are.  If we never heard from any of these actors again this would still be a great movie.
The plotline is very simple and in many ways predictable.  But the real art is how the story is told from beginning to end.  You end up caring about all the characters and how your sympathy moves from one to another.
Buy this DVD and buy some additional copies to give to your friends.  I have found myself thinking about this movie years after I first watched it.  Its that good.
(OK.  I'm glad little Reese W. went on to become a big star making other films.  But I watched those films and forgot them the next day.  It would be ironic if at the end of her career her best film was made before anyone cared about who she was.)",1075420800,,1054,4.1683168316831685

Having said all of that you could probably guess I was about the same age as Dani in the movie.  By the end of the movie, I forgot where I was and that I was trying to impress this boy that I was on a date with.  I let myself get so wrapped up in the movie I was crying like a baby.  I looked away long enough to make eye contact with my best friend and realize she was crying too.  The guys we were with didn't know what to do with us.
I loved this movie from the first time I saw it and every time I see it, it nevers looses its effect on me.  A few less tears nowadays but still the same heart wrenching emotion of growing up, falling in love, losing your first love, and realizing your sister will be the one there for you 'til the end.  Just as powerful now at 24 as it was at 12.
I highly recommend this movie!!  It is still one of my faves twelve years, many boyfriends, and a happy marriage later.  It takes you right back to your first kiss!  Hoepfully yours was worth remembering!",1059523200,5,1144,3.8836206896551726

I was expecting a charming story of coming to age and unrequited love. It turned out to be one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. I don't know why I never heard it, but it seems that I am not alone it that regard. A movie this good should have had a lot coverage when released. I guess I misssed it.

However, Cort is much more interested in Dani's older sister than he is in Dani, which causes real drama later on.  I guess I would reccomend this film to any Witherspoon fan because it is her first movie, but I wouldn't reccomend to most guys because it is really a chickflick.

461568,5,6302413737,"Okay, I'm going to say this straight out.  This is a family film (although it is rated PG-13).  And yes, it will bring tears to your eyes.  For those who are already heading for the hills, you'll be making a huge mistake.  After all, it's directed by the same man (Robert Mulligan) who gave us ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""The Summer of 42"".
""The Man in the Moon"" is a small film that came out in 1991 and I, among millions of others, missed its theatrical release.  Heck, most missed its video release.  This is really a shame because these movie treasures come far too infrequently.  They get pigeon-holed and lumped together with all the other Hollywood-style attempts to depict family drama (which runs from the banal to okay, and even to pretty good).  So I'm here to ""unlump"" it.
This marvelous story centers around two teenage sisters, Dani and Maureen (age 14 and 17 respectively) and their attraction and love for the same boy (Court Foster, played nicely by Jason London).  Set in the 1950s on a rural Louisiana farm, this film richly depicts the setting and ambience of this era.  Much like ""Stand by Me"", it shows us the unfettered freedom that children had in a small, rural community in those days...a freedom sadly lacking today.
Wonderfully acted throughout, special attention should go to Sam Waterston (the father), Tess Harper (the mother), and Reese Witherspoon (Dani).  This is not, let me repeat, not an overblown melodrama.  This movie knows exactly where it is going and it pin-points the target at every turn.  Today, where ""coming of age"" films mean boy gets girl, this film takes a fresh and absolutely honest approach, catapulting it far above the others of this genre.  Between 1 and 10, ""The Man in the Moon"" gets the highest mark, a 10.  When one looks at the jacket, you'll see over-used words such as ""poignant"" and ""bittersweet"".  All I can say is, believe it, for it is true.  This one is a classic in the truest sense of the word.",992044800,155,1966,4.635838150289017

I've been a fan of Reese Witherspoon forever, and it's hard to believe that this was her debut, she's so wonderful in this roll.

After she meets Court, a seventeen-year-old enigmatic boy, she falls deeply in love with him, and she starts to become responsible and think for herself. This movie comprises of two parts: first love and a family's ability to love each other despite the odds. The relationship between Dani and her father is one that some of us can familiarize with, and the relatiobship between the sisters. Youth, innocence, awkwardness, and heartbreak-could a movie be more beautifully merged? The heat of the South can be felt even in the wintertime, and the tangibility of our first loves reoccurs.

This film takes you by surprise, and engages you in a candid, fresh and  charming way.  Reese Witherspoon is guileless, and perfect as the heroine;  Sam Waterston, in his usual well-crafted way, gives the father a gravity,  dignity and grace that Atticus Finch, the lawyer father in Mockingbird,  would be proud of.  The love story, which provides the film its core plot,  tenderly examines from nearly every viewpoint -- familial and otherwise --  the joys and heartaches of that first rush of emotion that overtakes us all  at some point in our youth.  The watering-hole sequences have such a simple  yet intense quality that you are transported back to your own fumblings  with affection and those crushes that crippled your vision of the world for  as long as they lasted.  This movie deserved a much wider audience when it  first appeared, but I have kind of loved the fact that it remains one of  those special gifts you can give that will continue to give once its viewer  takes the time to unlock its secrets.
