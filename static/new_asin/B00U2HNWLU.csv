7027517,5,B00U2HNWLU,"Code of a Killer.  This three-part British crime miniseries comes to us from the director of BROADCHURCH and the producer of LINE OF DUTY.  It is a gritty suspenseful telling of the remarkable true story of scientist Alec Jeffreys discovery of DNA fingerprinting nearby its first use in the world of crime solution by Detective Chief Superintendent David Baker, a progressive tenacious detective who was hunting a double murderer. The two actors who portray the heroes of this story that captures a real-life Eureka moment do a heroic job of carrying its nonstop action.
 The EMMY nominated  BAFTA winner David Threlfall, ( MIDWINTER OF THE SPIRIT, RIPPER STREET) takes the role of David Baker, who between 1983 and 1987 headed up the investigation into the brutal murders of two Leicestershire schoolgirls, Lynda Mann and Dawn Ashworth.  John Simm (LIFE ON MARS, DOCTOR WHO, STATE OF PLAY), portrays the brilliant Dr. Alec Jeffreys,  a scientist at Leicester University, only a few miles away, who, on September 10, 1984, invented a remarkable technique to read each individuals genetic fingerprints.  Together, facing public opposition and lack of funding, these two outstanding men attempt to do what has never been done before:  solve a crime through DNA profiling.  They conduct the worlds first DNA manhunt  to find the girls murderer, stop a serial killer.

The box set, of which I received an advance copy in expectation of an honest review, consists  of three episodes running approximately 140 minutes, on one disc.  It has a 29 minute behind the scenes featurette with the cast, crew and real-life Dr. Alec Jeffreys and Detective David Baker.  And subtitles, thank goodness, for those not up on their Leicester lingo.  Plus, as it clearly must, violence and strong language.  Mind you, this is such a  well-told inspiring story: the Daily Mirror (UK) says it ""Combines gripping drama with the remarkable history of DNA fingerprinting;"" that I would urge even family viewers  to catch it.  It shows that, for once, even seemingly intractable problems can be solved if smart people work long enough and hard enough.  I wouldnt have missed it.",1495497600,2,2151,5.074074074074074

This DVD is based on a true story, but with drama-license infused, a crime needs the revolutionary DNA research to solve a dastardly deed. Some names altered, but not the victims, the killer, police chief, Jefferys and wife Sue, bonus material validates. A powerfully written true story presented with esteemed seasoned actors. UK aired it in 2 90-min parts.

[1] ==Nov 1983, Narborough teen is murdered and accosted but clues to the perp are few. DCS Baker backs off the investigation to cold case status. Can Leicester Uni Prof Jeffreys save his marriage while engrossed in DNA research?
[2] ==1986 2nd attack/murder-copycat or serial? Reading DNA code creates viable evidence thanks to Jeffreys break through. Hes asked to assist in the 2 murder cases by DSC Baker. Forensic science hits a milestone.
[3] ==Mass DNA testing in Leichestershire area; the worlds 1st manhunt via DNA. Thousands volunteer to blood testing in the desperate search for a serial killer. Costs escalate, threatening shut-down. Sep 1987 produces a break. A satisfying conclusion-dramatically and in reality. A must own DVD.

Used actual original participants as advisors. Tells the story of the first use of DNA in criminal forensics in the '80s where a British town's males were asked to provide blood samples to match against those found at the two victims' homicide sites.",1504137600,,439,5.111111111111111

8703973,5,B00U2HNWLU,"If youve read my other DVD reviews on Amazon you will know that I really hate spoilers in reviews of mysteries and crime dramas. Its honestly unfair to spoil the discovery by the next viewer. So Ill try to present the basics here and provide no spoilers.

The 140-minute film (it is not a series) was produced for the commercial UK network, ITV, in 2015 and was originally a two episode series. It was apparently re-edited (if that is the correct word) for US TV to become THREE parts, running between 45 and 47 minutes each. On the DVD you can play the whole film, which is what I did.

About 10 years ago Director James Strong made a documentary about the Leicester scientist, Dr. Alec Jeffreys, who discovered DNA fingerprinting in 1984 and how his landmark discovery was used for the first time to capture a criminal. This new film uses those actual events and adds some drama to tell the story. Strong is also the Director of the wonderful BBC series Broadchurch and had previously worked with scriptwriter Michael Compton on the Silent Witness series.

While I plan to seek out the documentary film (of which I wasn't aware), I found that the excellent script explains what DNA is in a very easy to understand manner. Most people think DNA was discovered in the 1950s (and probably in the US  rather than a small community of England).

There is some mystery here as to who the person was, who raped and killed two 15-year-old girls (two years apart) just a few miles away from each other in the Leistershire town, but thats not the main purpose of the film; its about how the killer was discovered.

Because both the homicide detective and the scientist are still alive, and actually came to the film set, there is a sense that this is as it happened. The DVD version has an excellent 28-minute behind the scenes featurette (one of the best of these Ive seen lately) which includes lots of comments by the two real life characters as well as the actors who play them. The writer and director are both here too.

As I noted above, Im not a fan of spoilers. Each of the three episodes has a :synopsis on the screen if you choose to play by episode. At least two of these give a spoiler, so I highly recommend that you skip reading these. And do not watch the bonus feature until after watching the film. Spoilers abound there.

There is some violence - minimally shown, and one use of graphic language. No nudity. The subtitles were easy to read, thought I found the accents easy to understand and didn't use them.

I don't remember seeing this series playing on PBS, so I can easily recommend the DVD (again, because of the bonuses).  Another fine release from Acorn.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
