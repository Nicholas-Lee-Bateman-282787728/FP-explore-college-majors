8413437,5,B0042B50NU,"I love this series. I started watching it because Amanda Burton was the star. Emilia Fox replaced her in Series 9 I believe and she has done an excellent job. All of the actors are really (although I must admit I did not know any of them besides Amanda) good. The writing is sharp - the stories are current and usually catch your interest pretty quick. Think of this show as a cross of CSI - Bones and maybe Crossing Jordan. You really do not have to watch this series from the very beginning as I highly recommend you do with New Tricks and Waking the Dead. You do though have to have an all region dvd player. It will not play on USA machines, If you love a good English mystery with forensics playing the major role - this is it. These 3 doctors are a little moody - they have their quirks but you will care about them and their cases pretty quick.",1402790400,,851,4.163636363636364
