2827750,1,B000PR08SM,"I was very displeased with the condition of the DVD. I had waited with much anticipation to see this movie only to have the DVD be in very poor condition. It didn't appear like it was scratch but when I was in the second chapter the whole movie was ruined with constant pauses and delayed motion. It didn't better untill the third chapter. Also, I like to have the captions on for my daughter to practice  her reading and even the captions were all messed up. I was very disapointed over witht ehquality of the video. I wished I had the sellers address to ask him for a replacement or a refund.",1272499200,,594,4.303571428571429
2827751,5,B000PR08SM,This is a good series.  I wish they would do the rest of the books in the series.  I have enjoyed the first three a lot.  It hits your heart even though it was over a century and a half ago.  The things these people endured are a sad statement to part of our history and their courage and enduring is a statement to faith.,1268697600,,322,3.9076923076923076
2827752,4,B000PR08SM,Not quite as good as the 1st two in the series but enjoyable just the same.,1252108800,,75,3.75

2827754,5,B000PR08SM,"The books were big, intruiging, historical fiction.  The videos brought the books to life very remarkably.  I purchased this one for a friend who couldn't find the video elsewhere.",1240012800,,180,5.172413793103448
2827755,5,B000PR08SM,"As it says, this is part three of three well done movies.

If you want to get out of this movie all that there is in it, before you watch part three, go out and get part One and Two and watch them first.

I am hard pressed to see where they could have improved on what was done in telling a very important part of America's history in it's context of the early 1800's.

When I first heard of this movie I thought. OK, another stylistic caricature of ""The Mormons"". Like some horrible B&W movie I saw many years ago with some horror movie star (Can't remember his name. Boris Karloff of someone like him.)

Anyway this guy who portrays Joseph Smith is truly believable as God's Prophet. He is truly the kind of man I would love to sit down and share a beer with and even follow to the Rocky Mountains.

Brigham Young, although not much time spent on him, was shown as a man wholly devoted to who he truly believed to be God's Prophet.

This movie helps you to understand why a few renegade Mormons would even want to get even with a few travelers from the Missouri area coming through Utah's Mountain Meadows. Not the kind of behavior Christians should take part in but people sometimes do carry a grudge, Christian or not, when loved ones have been persecuted and murdered as a matter of political convenience.

This is no reason for the attack at Mountain Meadows just the way it was.

People traveled through Utah all the time unmolested and the story is totally false that says the reason for the attack on them was that they did not like strangers passing through their country.

This movie is informative and fun for the whole family.

Even young people need to know that just like chickens in the chicken yard or children on the school ground, we are many times not much different we we ""grow up"".

Watch and enjoy Parts One through Three of this movie and then write every one you can who can see to it that Part 4, Across the River to Nauvoo, (or some title like it) gets into production as soon as possible.",1179619200,15,2016,4.349333333333333
2827756,3,B000PR08SM,"This movie is actually very well done (for it's budget at least). The problem with the movie is the source material. The time in LDS church history that this covers is a very difficult time. It covers the problems in Kirtland, with the bank, the attempted overthrow of Joseph Smith by Warren Parrish and the gang and some of the Missouri issues as well. The romantic storyline between Joshua and Carolyn was okay but nothing special.

If you are looking for a fun movie that will entertain you then this isn't it. However, if you are looking for a movie that can give you some detail about church history during the Kirtland and Missouri eras (minus the Steed fictional characters) then this is a well done movie.

This movie desperately needed something to lighten it up... the ending was nice but it wasn't enough.",1177632000,6,816,4.659722222222222

2827788,4,B000PR08SM,"An enjoyable movie. It does a good job getting the facts straight in Mormon history. The movies do a good job of following the story line of the first few books in the series. Still, the books are better.",1443657600,,204,4.256410256410256

2827808,4,B000PR08SM,"Being LDS these movies hit a soft spot for me. There are almost no movies to hit the mainstream that shows the darker side of U.S. history and the persecutions of the Mormons. While much of this is fiction, it hit on some key areas that often gets omitted in American history 101. to this day people are still appalled when they discover things like the ""extermination Act"" was real and on the books, even until the 1970's. For me, of all the actors I have seen in various film portray Joseph Smith, The actor in the Work and the Glory is my favorite. I feel he does an amazing job balancing this controversial historical figure.

It does have some cheesy aspects about it, however this is one series that I think is good enough that even non mormons can appreciate it and enjoy the series. Often church oriented movies are too heavily geared toward that of the member, which really isolates a great potential for outreach and education.",1410393600,2,937,4.544378698224852
