8275728,4,B001A0C7VY,"Really the title should be more 'oddities' as they aren't grotesque images for the modern person but usually charming, old-fashioned morality takes and even goofy. A great deal of variety and it's very hard to find this kind of footage and want to support those doing it. The little book with descriptions of the individual films is extremely helpful. It would have been nice to have some kind of short about the pieces and their context from the producers in the package as well. I wouldn't recommend attempting to watch too many at a time as I did, and there is no reason. They stand alone and can be taken in individually.",1349481600,,625,4.589285714285714
8275729,5,B001A0C7VY,"As co-producer of this DVD, I'd like to share the following reviews of ""Grotesqueries"" from our friends at the fabulous `Monster Mania' and 'Land Of Cerpts & Honey websites.  The first is from 'Monster Mania' :

  If you are looking for something unique and spooky for Halloween, than this DVD comes highly reccomended. ""Grotesqueries"" is a ghoulish compilation of very vintage short subjects from the dawn of cinema through the 1930s. Many  of the films presented are rare and real delights for the dyed in the wool film fan, like myself,  who has a taste for the macabre. The usual assortment of cartoons litter the compilation, including those starring Felix the Cat and Tom and Jerry (not that Tom and Jerry) and are appropiately bizarre. However, the best stuff are the real rarities like Le Spectre Rouge (1907), which has a skeleton/devil magician who keeps homunculi in a jar, like Dr. Pratorious in The Bride of Frankenstein (1935).

  The DVD is divided into three parts, the first focusing on cartoons and an abridged version of ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" (1928), that very atmospheric arthouse film from the silent era. The second part takes place in a graveyard that doubles as a drive-in theater where various comical previews are played (including a trailer for Maniac (1934), that is pretty funny) and an abridged live orchestral version of Lon Chaney's ""The Phantom of the Opera"" (1925), which I could only wish was full length.

  The final part focuses on some lovely obscurities such as a really cool expressionist pin-screen animation,  ""A Night on Bald Mountain"" (1933) and a wonderful send-off with a section from the opera, Ruddigore, and the great spooky song, ""The Ghosts' High Noon"", which is actually very addictive and fun to sing!

 Everything on this DVD is exceptional and it's refreshing to look into the past and explore a holiday that's cornerstone was always old-fashioned fun and innocent charm. Even the special features are cute, including items from Halloween's past and humorous epitaphs on real gravestones! This is an independent release and is not as widely available as it should be. This is the kind of DVD that ought to be a seasonal perennial. What really makes the entire thing so special is that it is clearly a labor of love for those involved and it makes for an excellent diversion for the curious, morbid or otherwise.

#1:

 As co-producer of GROTESQUERIES I am delighted to be able to share the following comments on the DVD from Walter von Bosau of the Film Department at Boston University:

 I just wanted to drop you a note, telling you how delighted and thrilledI am with the DVD of
 GROTESQUERIES. I had originally heard about it through the Creepy Classics website, and ordered it.
 I'v e just finished it, and it is a treat from beginning to end. It' s the best DVD I have purchased this year.
 My thanks to all involved for putting this together. ""

 Title: Gilbert & Sullivan's `Ghosts' High Noon'

 A highlight of this DVD, the Final to Act Three, is an animated visualization of `The Ghosts' High Noon' from Gilbert and Sullivan's Comique-Opera, ""Ruddigore' or `The Witche's Curse'.

 The `curse' is upon the descendants of Ruddigore. They must commit one crime a day or perish.

 In the sequence depicted, the picture gallery of Ruddigore Castle, the heir apparent, Robin Oakapple, is confronted by his ghostly ancestors led by Sir Roderic Murgatroyd, who warns the youthful lad that `they fate thou canst not now avoid.'

 But Roderic and his spirited relations are a jolly crew, and they sing about their revel-making on `The Ghosts' High Noon.'

 The song is repeated with viewers invited to sing-a-long to lyrics at the bottom of the screen. Sir Roderic is sung by Darrell Fancourt with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Chorus under Maestro Malcolm Sargent -from a 1931 HMV pressing through the courtesy of Chris Webster.

 And if you feel like polishing-off yet another Gilbert and Sullivan tongue-twisting tune try warbling `The Sorcerer's Song' from `The Sorcerer' offered in Haunted Melodies, one of 13 wicked bonus features.

 An image from `The Ghosts' High Noon' is now available on this site.",1211328000,13,2935,5.180645161290323
