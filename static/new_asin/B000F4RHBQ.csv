2552700,3,B000F4RHBQ,"Luckily, I was there to tape it, but if you didn't see this when it came on PBS in 1992, you missed it for 14 years.  I've been letting many a bisexual female friend borrow my copy, so I'm glad this is finally on DVD.  As popular as the topic of female bisexuality is now, I'm really surprised the producers didn't make this decision sooner.

There have been many films where one spouse comes out as gay (""Brokeback Mountain,"" ""Making Love,"" and ""Lianna"" are examples).  However, this was a rare description of a ""lavender marriage"" where both spouses are gay.  This film may be revolutionary to see for couples that fit that description.

This work was quite pioneering for its time.  Cinema fans who love seeing women's narratives in Europe during the first half of the 20th Century will love this.  Works such as ""Tipping the Velvet"", ""Henry and June"", and ""Paris Was a Woman"" came after this movie and may have copied elements of it.

Just like ""Brokeback Mountain,"" this film has a tragic conclusion (I haven't given up the plot, you'll have to see it to know what I mean).  Since it portrays facts that really happened, I can't fault it much for the ending.  Still, be prepared for a downer!

Though Sackville-West had a romantic relationship with Virginia Woolf,  it does not come up in this work.",1147910400,25,1304,4.6173913043478265
2552701,5,B000F4RHBQ,"I saw Part I of this series when it originally aired on PBS many years ago.  I bought this to see the remaining episodes.  It was a worthwhile purchase!  I honestly think my area PBS stations only aired this one time, which wouldn't surprise me, given that it really is about--as its description says clearly--the lesbian relationship between these two women and its impact on ALL of those, but especially their husbands, around them.  Everyone in this production is a fine actor.  The story is inherently interesting, in part because it involved at least one famous person, Vita Sackville-West.  And these women, even without one another's dynamic relationship, were interesting people by themselves.  I must admit, to me, this production is driven by character and conflict.  If you want typical action-packed, fast-paced American viewing, this is NOT for you.  If you abhor lesbianism (for whatever reasons), this is not for you.  I did find myself splitting up these episodes, watching each on a different night, over three nights.  Much of this story is, at least I think, depressing.  I simply couldn't watch more than one episode a night without having it make ME feel down, but I'm very glad I have this production. It was worth investing in.",1247184000,3,1250,4.956730769230769
2552702,2,B000F4RHBQ,"I'm appalled by all the positive reviews of this rather tired and maudlin film which is said to be based on the altogether wonderful book ""Portrait of a Marriage"" by Nigel Nicolson.  As far as adapatations go, this is one of the least faithful I've ever encountered.  Either the writer of the film used various sources other than Nicolson's book, or she made things up (which is not likely).  Gone is the rich history of her mother and grandfather, of growing up, of her later years and relationship with Virginia Woolf.  Only a brief line or two mentions Vita's first romance with Rosamond.  This is not a portrait of a marriage, but rather the portrait of an affair.  Vita is portrayed as a spoiled malcontent trapped in a loveless marriage (which is the opposite of the portrait in the book).  The cast is not at fault; indeed they are all to be praised (especially McTeer).  Likewise, the production elements are all first rate.  It is the direction, teleplay and dramatic pacing which are at odds with the source material.  The characters are poorly drawn, and their motivations not well articulated.  What about Violet has captured and possessed Vita, is it her personality,her sexual magnatism, is she thrilling and vibrant?  Not here.  We have no ""real"" clue as to what has brought these two women together in such an all consuming passion.  These characters - as depicted - are spoiled rich brats; and it was hard for me to give a damn about them and their ""classy"" problems.  The book is so rich is detail, history and atmosphere which this film doesn't even attempt to capture.  It is a one note affair (pardon the pun) and one I can not in good faith recommend.  Please, please, please, read the book and skip the film.",1246060800,7,1731,4.66006600660066
2552703,5,B000F4RHBQ,"I too watched this PBS special, but was out of town for the last installment and never did see the ending. I was heartbroken and have been searching for it ever since! The story captivates me and the acting was superb. I am now reading the book by Vita and Harold's son and cannot wait, truly, cannot wait to see the movie again! I am thrilled to find it at Amazon!",1230940800,,365,4.154929577464789
2552704,5,B000F4RHBQ,"The story of Sissinghurst and the people that gardened it.  The time was so hard for anyone that didn't fit the norm.  But a woman to marry a man when the man loved her but was attracted to his own gender.  And a wife who learned to love another woman.  And a house and garden that kept them together over a life time of turmoiul, love and just wanting. I loved this tale and it will always live on my favourite list.  old by a child of the marriage the story is honest and so painful times.  But like the garden this couple tend can send a beautiful rose at times even if it only lives for such a short time before showing it's thorns.
A beautiful tale but care, careful it just might break your heart.",1227398400,,703,4.094890510948905
2552705,5,B000F4RHBQ,"I remember seeing this series when it first came out in England many years ago.  I recently bought the DVD's issued here in the US.  Seeing it again, so many years later, did not diminish the effect it had on me.  I was quite surprised by this and I think that fact alone says something about the quality of this production.  It is really an examination of the conflict between stable family life and the wild passions of youth.  Many people might contemplate the kind of marriage/relationship that Vita had, but very few would actually go through with it.  There are some very violent scenes so this is not for the faint of heart, and some heartbreaking ones when you see the effect the turmoil is having on her children.  It superbly acted by all parties especially the husbands- they are very hard parts to play.  Janet McTeer is absolutely perfect as Vita.  Many people know of Vita Sackville-West because of her later relationship with Virginia Woolf.  But it is vital to understand her first major extramarital affair with Violet to understand the context of her later relationships with other women.
For gardeners out there thinking that this might show Sissinghurst, a word of caution, most of the action takes place while Vita and Harold were creating their Long Barn garden, not Sissinghurst.  But there are some divine shots of Sissinghurst (especially the White garden) at the very end.",1209168000,2,1398,4.807531380753138
2552706,5,B000F4RHBQ,"I thoroughly enjoy this movie.  In the same genre as ""Maurice"", ""Wilde"", and ""Tipping the Velvet"", this timeless classic is truly rivoting and heartwretching to watch. The age of innocence was a period many seek to keep prime and proper, full of myths on social morality, when in fact, most educated, well travelled and sophisticated people (especially in the Arts)knew that this so-called benign period was the beginning of greater freedom of expression if one only dared challenged societal myths. This film is definitely one fit for the classical library collections, gay or straight. I am sure others customers will be as delighted with this film as I was. Bravo to you Amazon, for your brilliant selection of film!",1191974400,2,719,5.042016806722689
2552707,5,B000F4RHBQ,"If you enjoy period dramas or bios, check this one out..also a true story written by the couple's son, Nigel",1187308800,,108,4.45
2552708,5,B000F4RHBQ,"This is a superb BBC production. High production values. It's a TV luxury. Based on Vita's memoire of her love affair with Violet Keppel Trefusis which can be found in Nigel Nicolson's 'Portrait of a Marriage' as well as Violet's letters and Vita's biography, it is intelligently scripted by Penelope Mortimer and acted excellently by a high calibre cast. The drama is gut wrenchingly effective in parts. There is a violent scene between Vita and Violet that made me want to jump into the TV and put an end to it. Of note for me is the acting of Cathryn Harrison especially in the first 2 episodes; she is a perfect Violet awesomely in love with Vita. The blood from Violet's face would drain when she caught sight of Vita; she wanted to give all of herself to Vita. Cathryn transmits this intensity of feeling with great skill - this is marvelous acting (watch for her reactions especially in the love scenes). Peter Birch/Denys Trefusis also has a similar quality. Only David Haig as Harold grates because the direction has him play the part too passively as a kind of neutered man- still we get the point of the dynamics. Janet McTeer is excellent and conveys the idea of Vita's so called dual nature well.

In the final 2 episodes disenchantment sets in as it did in real life and the story ends in Amiens, France (early 1920) in a fevered destructive climax. At the end the sheen has come off all the characters. I no longer cared much about Vita and Harold but was concerned about Violet especially and Denys who are left with a ruined future - we are not told what happened to them and they are not contextualised in the drama.  The absence of Violet's powerful and famous mother Alice Keppel is a flaw as she was instrumental in the ending of the affair. The DVD includes a very short note about Vita but nothing about the others.

The post script is that Vita and Violet continued their relationship as far as they could until Spring 1921. Denys Trefusis sought a formal separation which would have brought the whole affair into the public domain (he was penniless and would need alimony I suppose but he was also seething from humiliation). Lawyers and matriarchs came onto the scene and Vita agreed, through lawyers, to give Violet up. Violet became bereft, lost and declassee or ostracised from high society - a great humiliation for her mother (Edward VII's discreet, clever mistress). She was confined and banned from contacting Vita. Violet and Denys eventually reached an agreement and went to live in Paris - the spoiled marriage turned into a fragile companionship funded by Mrs Keppel. Denys introduced the lonely Violet to the high priestess of arts and music, Princess Polignac and that love affair was tolerated because of its discretion. This enabled the brilliantly intelligent Violet (we don't see much of this in the TV series) to become classee in Paris's high society and in Florence where she inherited her parents' villa. She never married again but, after poor Denys died of consumption, she went back to her flirting girlish ways -even as a grande dame in Paris and Florence -and had many a male suitor as she did before she met Vita. Not many in France and Italy knew about her true past. There must have been a buried sadness - she knew that her ideal of love had failed; she lived the artificial facile life, albeit with an ironic eye, she had once so hated and became quite eccentric. But she lived in her beloved France. Her heart was French, she said. She once prophesied that her life would be one of waste. Maybe it was but she  gave a lot of pleasure to her many friends. She wrote published books. And I take my hat off to her for getting through it all.

Vita and Harold lived in companionship and never had intimate relations again. Vita continued to have affairs and wrecked a couple of marriages on the way but managed to have an enduring mostly platonic, passionate friendship with Virginia Woolf. There is evidence that Violet and Vita felt the flame again in their middle age but desisted. The friendship was worn down by disappointment - both represented fallen ideals and wasted potential. Harold had his liaisons but they were never grand affairs. Vita became quite reclusive at Sissinghurst and her biography politely implies she may have liked the alcohol a bit too much in older age.  She was ambivalent towards her children. She and Harold lived apart most of the time but their affectionate companionship endured to the end and Harold - a man of real substance with a raft of books to his name as does Vita - was left desolate when Vita died in 1962.  The beautiful garden at Sissinghurst is the best portrait of their marriage. Violet was the last to leave this earth in 1972 -

""My heart was more disgraceful, more alone
And more courageous than the world has known,
O passer by my heart was like your own.""

Shortly after Nigel Nicolson's book was published. London (and Paris and Florence for the 1st time) was aghast all over again. And now, here we are. Buy this DVD. It's honestly one of the best BBC dramas ever. Then, if still interested, buy the biographies by Glendinning and Souhami.",1185321600,18,5152,4.652747252747253
2552709,5,B000F4RHBQ,"First saw this on Masterpiece Theater with Alistair Cooke. Excellent autobiography and story of a gay woman poet/writer, Vita Sackville-West, living in the WWI era 1920's and 30's, gay life in Paris!  What you did in those days was marry and hide your homosexuality and lesbianism. Sackville-West and her diplomat homosexual husband do just that.  But, as women, sex does not come without love as emotions, passions, and trust broil to a fantastic climax.  Most intriguing!!  Personnel favorite of all time.",1183507200,2,507,5.222222222222222
2552710,4,B000F4RHBQ,"It all sounds terribly thrilling at first: a marriage between two homosexuals of opposite sexes, enjoying married life while engaging in same-sex affairs. It's almost too good to be true, which is exactly what is shown in this engrossing dramatization. The acting is flawless, but the characters seem hardly attractive. Vita Sackville-West plays a terribly selfish, destructive person who talks a good game of devotion to husband and children, but loses herself so much in her passing lusts that she not only can't see why she should spend Christmas with her family, but can't see why the British should defeat Hitler. She's giddy with her new-found sexual liberation but becomes a stranger to reason and, finally, almost wholly unsympathetic. Her horsey bad looks and fabulous wealth evidently made her irresistible to some, but as acted this is a woman who verges on the detestable. Husband Harold is oddly weak and ordinary. Vita's girlfriend seems merely vulgar.",1182470400,,966,5.198717948717949
2552711,5,B000F4RHBQ,"This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. They did an excellent job distilling the long and detailed book to bring out the crucial themes--Vita as a person with two different natures, the complex relationship between Vita and Harold, his diplomacy in their relationship, the deep resistance to lesbianism in this era, Violet's complex personality. The acting was tremendous--utterly believable. High production standards. I'm watching for the second time and enjoying as much as the first.",1178496000,3,503,5.222222222222222
2552712,3,B000F4RHBQ,"Nigel Nicholson's book is a biographical gem and I expected a lot from the TV series. I was let down. It's prettily filmed, well acted and evokes the period well, but there was a petulant, downbeat feel to the screenplay that wasn't present in the book. Neither Vita Sackville West nor Violet Trefussis was presented sympathetically, which I felt belied the fact that both were sufficiently attractive in real life to interest many suitors of both sexes. The only character who came off well was Nigel Nicholson. Subliminal anti-gay bias in the production team? Despite this, I liked it enough to buy the DVD.",1178496000,4,609,4.865384615384615
2552713,5,B000F4RHBQ,"The brilliant telling of the real-life love affair between feminist writer Vita Sackville-West and novelist Violet Keppel, women lovers in post WWI England, is devastating and exquisite. The amazing and intriguing story of the intertwining real lives of the main characters is riveting and surprising; the characters are completely compelling and irresistable.  The drama of passion and the devastating jealousy between the women, combined simultaneously with real love and devotion between Vita and her bi-sexual husband, Harold Nicholson, fills every sense. The love scenes between the women are refreshingly realistic and passionate; with every liaison, Vita becomes more and more torn between her two loves.  Excellent cinimatography.  The period details are perfect.  A true experience to enjoy over a couple of evenings.

Based on the book completed by Nigel Nicholson about his parents based on letters and journals left by Vita, this mini-series is absolutely wonderful!",1170633600,6,978,5.671232876712328
2552714,5,B000F4RHBQ,"I had almost given up hope that this great series would ever appear on video or DVD. Ever since I first saw it on television in the early 1990's it has been on my 'want' list. Great acting, great costumes and settings and a wonderful if tragic story. Based on the book by Nigel Nicholson it is the story of his parents marriage. The 'film' particularly deals with the relationship his mother (Vita Sackville-west) had with Violet Keppel (later Trefusis). I would also suggest ""Mrs. Keppel and Her Daughter ""by Diana Souhami as followup reading. Souhami's biography is beautifully put-together with a wonderful 'spread' of photos. Her obvious sympathy for Violet is refreshing.",1169942400,5,676,4.991150442477876

This film gave me pause to reflect on the true nature of making a life long partnership work.  For me , money well spent .

2552716,5,B000F4RHBQ,"I first watched this series when it came out in much anticipated weekly installments on Masterpiece Theater in 1992.  My rapture lasted from Sunday to Sunday and having now the full serving at one sitting allows me to recapture small nuances that had fallen into the abyss of forgetfulness (it was fourteen years ago!)  The story of the Nicolsons and of Vita and Violet is the story of a longing that exhilarates and crushes, as Janet McTeer's face and actions vividly capture.  Her longing for Violet, as compared to her true longing for her husband, makes one believe that loving only one person is perhaps unnatural and unhealthy.  Harold comes across as truly ""male"" in that he expects Vita to return to him even though he continues to pursue his same-sex relationships.  One sometimes wonders if his love for her is truly deep or whether his awareness of social convention is stronger than Vita's, as she continuously lives on the edges of her passions.  Vita is striking as portrayed by Ms McTeer, both as a woman and disguised as a man.  Violet is a striking beauty but comes off as more needy and less insightful.  Mr. Trefusis is portrayed as a prig, lost in a vortex of passion that he cannot feel, much less comprehend.  This is a most thoughtful and detailed ""portrait"" of relationships--male/female and female/female--without condescension or judgment.  Watch it carefully and come to your own conclusion to be sure: I suspect your thoughts about sexual relations will be profoundly shaken.",1154822400,19,1503,4.905138339920948

2552718,4,B000F4RHBQ,"If you are a dedicated gardener then no doubt you have heard of  Sissinghurst. Designed and executed by Vita Sackville-West and her husband Harold Nicolson their gardens are still considered world class. If you are watching this film for gardening tips, I suggest you look elsewhere. As the title of the film hints this is a rather myoptic look at their love lives rather then a how-to gardening primer.  The performances are excellent; full of passion and compassion; a worthy tale that stands on it's own merits. However, had they explored more of their accomplishments outside the bedroom then those unfamiliar with the beauty of their creation may have wondered (as I did) when did they find the time for gardening?",1154044800,5,719,4.933884297520661
2552719,5,B000F4RHBQ,"I've only seen the edited version on the US LOGO network and I'm in the process of reading the book right now, but let me tell you, this story is gripping and really pulls you in emotionally. The adaptation from book, which is part autobiographical by Vita Sackville-West (written only days after the climax of her relationship with Violet Trefusis) and part biographical by Vita and Harold's son Nigel, is simply wonderful. Janet McTeer who captivated me in films like ""Songcatcher"" and ""Tumbleweeds"" is stunning as Vita. Her ability to shift from Vita's fierce desire for Violet to Harold's gentle wife is amazing.  I know I'm ignoring the other actors in the film, not to say that they weren't wonderful as well(particulary David Haig as Harold) but the reason watch this film really is Janet McTeer.

Very seldom do I see films that grip me emotionally as much as this one has. The fact that this film as well as the book were ever made fulfills a prophecy of Vita's which she expresses so heartfeltly in the book. Which (to summerize)is that society will one day progress enough that stories like her's, Harold's and Violet's can be told and not looked upon with disgust and shame but rather by that of an open mind and perhaps educate others.",1150243200,15,1248,4.720183486238532

8117737,5,B000F4RHBQ,"This BBC adaptation provides a forthright look at the torrid love affair between Vita Sackville-West (Janet McTeer) and Violet Trefusis/Keppel (Cathryn Harrison). Set during post-World War I England, their affair continued for many years despite their husband's disapproval and attempts to separate the women.

The intensity of their affair knew no bounds as the women abandoned their families to run away together for weeks at a time. Vita avoided suspicion when they were traveling by often dressing as her alter ego, Julian.

Directed by Stephen Whittaker, the film was adapted from Nigel Nicholson's book A Portrait of a Marriage, based on Vita Sackville-West's journals and letters. Whittaker has captured the intensity of this affair along with the incredible excitement that must have come from dressing as man and wife traveling through Europe in the early part of 1900s.

Janet McTeer and Cathryn Harrison are phenomenal as Violet and Vita; their acting is superb. The women's ardent relationship is portrayed through numerous extremely passionate love scenes, which were quite daring for the time.

lesbian at a time when being gay was not accepted at all, and people were forced into relationships that was not in their core. Vita is
lucky to find Harol Nicolson who was also living a double life.  Their marriage though full of side affairs was strong and tender, Though
they had  two children and Vita neglected both at times, she loved her family and their marriage endure.  Her affair with her childhood
