8105147,5,B000E37272,"Three words - Just Buy It.  It is a fab DVD.  It features interviews with people who were around Jan & Dean when they began.  It is informative as well as fun.  Dean tells his side of things and Jan talks as well.  There aren't many of their DVD's around and I have managed to get hold of 3 so far.  The music is great.  They should be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the special niche market they filled (followed up by the Beach Boys)- another fab group.  And, man they are easy on the eyes!",1347321600,2,499,3.92
