2772234,5,B000NLA9TS,"The editorial is wrong, this has 20 episodes (2 DVDs) and is put together better than the $1 DVDs that Digiview released. Since this title is out of print, it is very unlikely that the final 20 episodes will be released on a second volume (though I am hoping they will release it once times are better). Hopefully this will happen, as Digiview did release the complete series of U.B.O.S. earlier this year (quite unexpected). With the lead voice of Scott McNeil as Nick Logan, this is a very good series to own.",1277942400,12,511,4.505376344086022

The shows play back quality is about as good as you would expect for such an old show.
The ending of the show as the official BKN logo so if you are a nostalgic person like I am then it's a nice touch.",1502150400,,220,3.702127659574468

8179201,4,B000NLA9TS,This is a just-a-tad delayed but received in great condition and the overall was thrilling and adventure to follow this guy that everyone seems to know even the aliens and this rogue Banshee woman that cares so much for rainbows and unicorns (She's overly peace-loving).,1361318400,,270,5.022222222222222

8179203,5,B000NLA9TS,"I adore this cartoon. It's one of my top favorites from now on. ''Roswell conspiracies'' is a very well written cartoon. I feel tempted and attracted to some of the characters. There are many good characters in the cartoon, and the animation is good. It's not bad, considering it was done in 1999. And what I like most is that it keeps me wanting more and more. I believe the story didn't go so well because of the plot or animation. And I do not understand it. The cartoon is really, really good.

What disappoints me most: is that the project was closed and there will be no more episodes. I wish I am wrong. The cartoon has a great potential. It is it's characters, and it's plot. It has this balance of everything that I like. I am very upset, because every time I look at the dvds, I keep wishing that they would start on the project again.",1307836800,4,845,4.28125
8179204,5,B000NLA9TS,"This DVD set has 20 episodes from the original animated series. it is a fun series, and the characters and story are interesting. There is a running subplot thru the whole series about a secret war between two factions of alien vampires, and a leader of the good guys who can't be trusted. The ultrasecret Global Alliance is a group formed to protect the earth from aliens that have lived on Earth for hundreds of years, while trying to keep it all a secret. In the meantime earthbased creatures such as banshees, the Abominable Snowman, and other all have a role to play. Great animation in the stories, it is a shame it did not last long. I recommend checking out the series, in style it is like a cross between Justice League and X-Files.",1295395200,5,741,4.496296296296296

8179206,5,B000NLA9TS,"THis series is great - it's drawn well with tightly written scripts and excellent actors.  The only problem is the lack of the second volume.  Perhaps that can be corrected with a future release.  My only complaint, a minor one, is that many of the aliens look like the characters on Generator Rex but this series was the first one out so I guess imitation is the sincerest form of flattery!",1292284800,,391,4.47887323943662
