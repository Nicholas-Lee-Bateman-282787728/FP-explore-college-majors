They are universalist tales about ordinary life. For my money, this is the best miniseries ever made. (Plus, it includes 2! great films. I prefer theDekalog V to A Short Film About Killing, and A Short Film About Love is surpasses Dekalog VI, and perhaps even the film it owes its inspiration from, Rear Window).",1470096000,6,456,4.858974358974359
2764088,1,8393884969,"All chapters are based on a Commandment. First is No God Shall Be Above Me.
The first chapter focuses on a genius boy. Fantastic- the kid does math for fun, beats chess champs, calculates the temperature outside for days in advance. Great kid, loving and thoughtful. So he calculates the freezing point for the day, and plays on the frozen lake. And dies, falling through the ice. Punishment, you see, for holding supreme the God of science above the God that would drown a genius kid for being able to calculate the freezing point. A sadistic lesson from a director who lost sight of humanity for one feature. Trois Coulors was remarkable, but this was vile. Nothing is more sacred than revelations from curiosity from the human mind. Ham fisted at best.",1467763200,4,755,4.7272727272727275

2764091,5,8393884969,"Machines will have personalities, a father tells his students and his young son who's peeping out from behind the lecture hall projector with wide enquiring eyes.
Indeed projectors, cameras, computers are the missing characters in this subtle short film by cult Polish filmmaker Kryzstof Kieslowski, in which technology seems capable of taking on the most essential of human roles: a computerised formula measures what's safe for a father to tell his child, a communications system conveys an absent mother's words in plain text, a camera holds on to what's essential to remember about the dead, like ""The way they moved and whether or not they were kind.""

The boy's aunt uses technology as a starting point, but is always clear in her mind about what it may deliver and what it can't: she praises the boy's accomplishments in using tech as a tool but encourages him to interpret blunt words on a computer screen in a way he can handle, possibly at the expense of The Truth, but she fills in what's missing, she comforts. The boy, like many children his age, is interested in death but his father, a scientist, and his religious aunt give different answers to his naive and insightful questions. The boy's aunt has her own teaching methods, not reliant on lecture halls and projectors, measuring instruments, she simply pulls the child in close and holds him, asking, 'What do you feel?'
'Love.' The boy answers simply.
At this point there seems to be less a disjuncture between cool science and human intuition in this child's life as there is a small ideological difference between a father and aunt who are, between them, more or less the yin and yang of good parenting.

Spoiler alert:
Kieslowski is one of those film-makers who can invest a single gesture with several chapters of back story: A hand slicking cologne behind an ear discretely, a homeless man's soft, bleak gaze direct to camera. The filmmaker's signs and portents come thick and fast in this short film and you'll need to be feeling strong to face the father's sleepwalk toward suffering: an infant's innocent question, ink spilling, siren sounds. A helicopter whirring at a distance, smoke unfurling from a fire's embers, the way that corridors shrink, doors close with a clipped sound. The doors keep on closing and we watch the father struggle to not see the evidence gathering for what he already knows to be true but can't face.

'There is no god but God' is the first in a series of ten interlinked films, named collectively Dekalog, or Ten Commandments. But, in spite of the title, if you're looking for straightforward religious fare then this film may not be for you. Each Short in the series is capable of holding several different interpretations simultaneously, and this film is no exception: God is love, in the shape of the boy's warm and intuitive aunt, but also love's opposite in the man who makes nightly fires by the lake where the children will skate later, and who stares coldly and knowingly at the viewer, wiping away a fake tear in a sinister fashion. Equally the very same film can lend itself to the interpretation that the real meaning of it lies not in 'technology versus God' or some polemic about the limits of science itself but only in the father's very singular failure as a scientist (he notes the fire, but fails to recheck his safety calculations about the thinness of the ice his child will skate on). Indeed you might feel that there is no act of God here at all, but only the very human failing of a parent (the father jumps on the ice to test it for his child, but fails to listen to his own unease, ignores his own intuition of approaching danger).

Throughout the film there is the very human need for comfort, ritual, and the drawing of collective strength from something other, simultaneously a kind of cold rage gathering. It feels just right, somehow, that when Kieslowski's father finally approaches the altar it is with the aim to just tear it down, which he does, but he also finds solace at the place which he has just broken with his own hands.

Kieslowski hasn't constructed a religious allegory here so much as told a very human tale, filled with all the complexity and nuance of bereavement and loss. In many ways this short film is ahead of its time in its consideration of how technology and humans may interact. Machines, in this telling, seem possessed of almost magical, dare I say god-like, properties. But it will be the humans in the end, with their weakness, love and broken connections, their attachments and their need for meaning, who'll drive and interpret the machines, and thereby define what the machine is, what we'll do with it, how we'll think of it. What we will remember.",1407024000,14,4718,4.748780487804878
2764092,5,8393884969,"This is the beginning of TROIS COLOURS, for Polish TV. Many of the themes and characterisations developing for later work. A lot of the actors will be reapear in the directors later works.  Color is muted, production minimal, has an opressive quality to it .. which fits. Not a work of joy but tragedy. If one understands NOIR, this would be GRAY. Later  similar themes appear within the polished and elegant opus of Colours, Dec provides an almost sketch book qualtity as a sort of Notebook for Trois Colours. Structurally  about the 10 commandments  they appear as observatons by someone who has thought and  correspondes in a way  requiring thought from its recipient. Certainly further along than tired work dangling Christainity as a weapon or a curse. Seinfield with being. More, a moralist view of the validity of the 10 points of the major religon of Poland.

And perhaps a notation that a little more thought into what they mean might be helpful to society. There is a sense of loss. Dogs, spouses, family, innocence ... leaving one a little bruised. Many of the themes redemed or accomodated in COLOURS where bad circumstances seem to find some balance in a world of misfortune, minor for some and folks, monumental for other standing beside.

Each story has many levels and I found them very engaging. On the surface, there is a very simple story and it is very well told, but there are other levels of depth and complexity that are suggested and left to the viewer. The visual style changes in each episode. There are moments when it appears there is very little occurring on screen, but the stories are dense in their content. Each story occurs in the same place and revolves around the same characters. The major characters from one episode might have been bit players in a previous episode.",1480723200,,718,4.653543307086614

2764104,5,8393884969,"This set of the ten Dekalog films dating from 1988 has for many years enjoyed something of a cult status. It explores the ways the behaviour of the wide range of typical inhabitants of a high rise of city flats relate to the Ten Commandments. Throughout the series the issues confronting the inhabitants are issues that will be familiar to the majority of viewers.

The cast per film is very small in number, maybe just two, but that often comes into fleeting contact with other previously encountered members of the flats. The issues faced by those also resonate and overlap with the immediate plot. In this way conflicting responses to circumstances gradually build up so that by the end of the sequence it becomes evident that many of the Commandments apply to many of the various situations in conflicting ways making it difficult to work out which specific Commandment might mostly apply to any one set of circumstances and at what cost.

That conundrum even applies to the first Dekalog which does not have the added complication of cast overlapping from previous plots. As none of the plots specifies a specific Commandment being illustrated it becomes increasingly likely that the central idea of the films is to explore the conflicts that arise in normal life that make strict adherence to all the Commandments practically impossible. The best that can be done, illustrated plot by plot, is to attempt a workable resolution with the best compromise that can be achieved.

The acting throughout is of the highest quality and commitment and all of the plots are able to develop in a natural and convincing manner within their hour's duration. No corners are cut for timing expediency.

This is a completely engrossing series and has justly acquired a considerable following across many nationalities and nations. However, this review is not intended to discuss the actual films in any further depth as by now they will have both supporters and detractors. Entering into those responses is not the purpose of the review which is aimed squarely at the many supporters of this film.

Essentially, for all of those who are keen supporters of this film sequence and who have bought the previous DVD version of this series, the only issue of vital importance will be whether the Blu-ray option offers an improvement technically sufficient to justify the considerable additional expense.

For this reviewer the answer is a clear affirmative. The upgrade offers a clear and striking advance on both wide-screen image and mono audio quality with the imaging being a marked improvement. The colours are firmer even within the limited chosen palette and there is an increase to the perceived depth of the imaging. The whole film simply becomes more 'real.' The film, which is so concerned with close characterisation, benefits considerably from this enhancement of reality.

The degree of improvement experienced from this BD set will also inevitably depend on the replay equipment used. The following technical information is intended to be a guide to aid in assessment.

The screen used for this review is only of moderate dimensions being a 40 inch television screen. However, the television is a high performing 4K unit which delivers a compensating positive effect. The moderate screen size lacks the impact of larger screens but is less critical of film faults.

However, the contributing player is, unusually, able to separate the audio and visual HDMI signals before they leave separately to the television and pre-amp. That feature enhances both the visual and audio elements of the output. The audio, not so critical in the case, delivers an unusually wide-ranging and revealing performance. Its precision is equally revealing of film scores.

Readers with alternative equipment will have to interpret this review bearing in mind their own equipment and its comparative advantages and disadvantages.

These discs offer purchasers with suitable replay equipment a substantial improvement over the previous DVDs.

In summary this BD set of the Dekalog is a transfer from good quality 1988 film stock and has responded very well to the upgrade and well worth considering. The bonus film is also well worth watching but it is likely that it will be the Dekalog that most purchasers will focus on for repeat viewing.",1474156800,16,4317,5.09052333804809

8176510,4,8393884969,"Very loosely based upon the 10 Commandments this made for television series is a challenge to get through at one go clocking in at almost 10 hours!  Still this Kieslowski classic fully deserves its lofty status among lists of greatest films of all time.  For me some episodes are great while others are less so but taken together as a whole this wonderful Criterion release deserves a place in any serious film buff's video library.  Also included is a 72-page booklet containing essays on each of the 10 episodes.  Every episode though covers aspects of life that move us to laughter, horror and sadness among other emotions all of which make for compelling and irresistible viewing.  There are also expanded versions on the fifth and sixth commandments corresponding to the Catholic divisions of thou shalt not kill and thou shalt not commit adultery.  Picture and sound quality wise there is little if anything to complain about in the release.

Highly recommended!",1511395200,,968,4.975155279503106
8176511,5,8393884969,"Dekalog (1988) is one of Kieslowski's masterworks; then again, what ISN'T a masterwork by the Polish director? Dekalog loosely explores the Ten Commandments, delving into the souls of volatile individuals, and yielding a thought-provoking outcome. The ten films draw the viewer into European culture, and in typical Kieslowski fashion, they depict real-life situations. When watching, I felt like the characters were doing things that are common everyday routine things, rather than exaggerated Hollywood stuff. Another Kieslowski trademark depicted in these films is a melancholy feeling, whether it's the character's struggles, the music, or even the cloudy or overcast weather. Kieslowski is a master of painting a darker portrait of life, which makes his films truly organic and real. As for favorite films in the series, I like 1, 4, and 6. All of the films are excellent, with some that actually have abrupt, frustrating endings that initially seem too simple, but nonetheless powerful. This Criterion set also contains two bonus feature films, so the entertainment goes even further. The fourth disc contains special features. Overall, this Dekalog blu ray set is top-notch, and the picture and sound quality are good for being a very low-budget series ($10,000 budget per film, $100,000 total). I highly recommend seeing this series as a primer for the subsequent four films, The Double Life of Veronique, and the Three Colors Trilogy (Blue, White, Red).",1505174400,,1462,5.388646288209607

8176513,5,8393884969,"Brilliant in concept, directing and cinematography. The acting in general is exceptionally fine. Each segment explores a difficult moral issue with intelligence and complexity. For Kieslowski moral wisdom is never simplistic, almost always ambiguous, and fate often upends the assumptions his characters make about how to live their lives.

8176514,5,8393884969,"A series that approaches the ten commandments could easily be wiitten off by the non-religious viewer, that would be a a grave mistake for the film fanatic in us all. I approached the films with a knowledge of the ten commandments as a person raised Christian that chose Buddhism, yet these films ( Originally episodic television segments) were not proselytizing in the least. In fact each commandment is approached with such a deft and subtitle hand as to be viewed without knowledge of the subject matter whatsoever. As per usual Criterion lovingly restores a classic and gives it a fresh coat of respect and polish. (Included in the set is a detailed booklet explaining each feature and more, as well as the extended theatrical versions of A Brief Film About Killing and A Brief Film About Love.) As to wether you the viewer will find these films to inspire both laughter and heartache as I did is dependent on your tastes. I rated it the highest I could and could not recommend the journey more to any person regardless of religious affiliation. They are slices of life that we feel almost voyeuristic in being able to participate in. Most are sad ended affairs, so if you're prone to melancholy perhaps that is the only reason I'd steer you away. Past that it's an amazing set of films with Criterion's signature polish.
