7764933,1,B01GP4HSNQ,"This show is a monument to the sins of Neo-Saban, and is an insult to not only the franchise it is 'honoring', but the series it is based on.

Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger, which 'Super' Megaforce straight-up rips off, is actually one of the best Anniversary Events Toei Company has ever produced, and one of Super Sentai's High-watermark series; during it's television run and related movies succeeding in honoring the legacy of every Sentai show that came before it, while also telling a defined tale own tale of the heroes, each of whom are defined, developed, Likable characters.  It is a series I cannot recommend enough, as it is an excellent jumping on point that can make you become interested in the older shows by being representative of everything good in the franchise; several of which the company shout Factory has made available and are continuing to Import.

Megaforce does not ever manage any of that.  It actively insults other entries, applies numerous retcons it never even bothers to explain that shows it's disrespect to prior material, and doesn't even bother to really tells it's own story or write competently; just ripping off the plots of Gokaiger and other sentai even though they are not coherent to the narrative of Megaforce.  The editing is terrible, and the acting is easily some of the worst Power rangers has ever showcased.  Andrew Gray shows himself as more of a robot, than the robot he spends all season searching for.  It reshoots a lot of unusable footage, but in ways that are entirely asinine; including pre-zyuranger Sentai teams in original footage they made, when the entire point of redoing such footage was to exclude them entirely; and never explains the suits nor their origins.  They are just 'there' now, but nothing in the show permits them their existence.  It's a complete wasting of their budget, which is rumored to have gotten producer Jonathan Tzachor fired.
To not even address the behind-the-scenes atrocities committed by the production staff and them insulting the actors they wanted to cameo in their 'legendary' battle; a battle that shows how pathetic this team is as they can't even defeat the enemy they've been fighting on their own.
Gokaiger showed by it's end it's team as having gone through the journey of misfit space pirates learning to be Heroes, the merits of those they succeeded, and coming to stand among The Sentai world's protectors as equals and comrades.
Megaforce by it's end showed how unworthy it's cast were...to actually be power rangers.",1468454400,3,2522,4.957345971563981
7764934,1,B01GP4HSNQ,"First off, I'm only getting this & Megaforce for completionist's sake because I'm a big fan of the franchise.
Second, let me tell you not to buy this for your kids, or Megaforce. Let them stream it on Netflix if they really wanna see it, but do not buy this season set, or Megaforce's. This season is the single worst in the franchise & will not hold up, unlike In Space, Time Force, or RPM.
It has: 1. Terrible writing. This season adapts a Japanese TV show season called Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger. Kaizoku translates to pirates, hence the suits & zords in the footage. Is this even at least lampshaded in a joke anywhere? Nope. That would be expecting the producers or writers to actually take the audience seriously, which they obviously don't. In adapting the Japanese Sentai series into this mess, it has absolutely horrible writing that translates the original Sentai scripts without trying to put clever spins, or changes to fit PR. You might see several teams that were NEVER Power Rangers teams through the use of the Sentai footage that they were too lazy to write out. You might be wondering what they're doing there, who the original owners of the powers were, & why the powers are on Earth despite them never being seen before. Good for you.
2. Horrible acting. While the main cast aren't terrible on the whole, Andrew Gray, who plays Troy the red ranger, has all of the enthusiasm of Tommy Wiseau, except the show isn't even laughably bad like The Room. He's just a weak link only there to look pretty for the camera. Nothing more. This is fueled by the fact that he was a model before this season & he had no prior acting experience beforehand.
3. Terrible editing. As I've said before, they kept in some Sentai teams in the stock footage, yet edited some others out. This is so inconsistent, it's not even funny. They don't even go into ANY detail on anything introduced. They just expect those watching to just go along with it & not question anything that's going on. Even kids can tell there's some stupidity at play with this nonsense. I have proof from when The Onyx Tavern on YouTube discussed the season in one of their videos where Raptor, one of the commentators, said a kid his friend was watching was pointing out continuity mistakes when watching Megaforce, I believe, though it couldve easily been this season.
4. Little, if any, respect for the viewers. Like I've said before, even kids can tell there's stupidity in this season. It has so little expectations of people seeing it despite the circumstances of it being the 20th anniversary season, that it just served the purpose of being filler on Nickelodeon's airtime. Seriously, it only expected kids to be watching & no one else, despite the peripheral demographic of older fans & Bandai doing the Legacy toyline during the year this was airing. It thinks kids are stupid & adult fans don't exist, despite the many instances that prove that mentality wrong.
I, honestly, don't get how anyone can like this series. Gokaiger & Go-Busters are worth more of a watch. Gokaiger for the anniversary stuff & Go-Busters for paying homage to Power Rangers for some reason, since it aired in 2013 concurrently with Megaforce.

Pre-release:
As for the DVD, it'll most likely be a repackaging of the 5 volume DVDs like Super Samurai, which is what you'd expect. Maybe they could do that with Samurai & not just be an Amazon-exclusive DVD-R piece of crap that costs almost $60, which is every bit as wrong as it sounds.

Post-realease:
Again, for the packaging, it IS a repackaging of the original discs from the volumes, so at least you'll be spending around $10 for these rather than the $50 for the individual volumes, which is slightly more than what this show's worth. The only reason I bought the season passes on iTunes was because they were $9 each for a bit, discounted. Unfortunately, Lionsgate gives so little of a crap about this franchise, that when it arrived, & this goes for Megaforce as well, the discs were so haphazardly put into the cases, being out of order in the strangest of ways, like they hired some people to put left over volume DVDs in the cases without making sure they did a decent job of it. I feel sorry for those that might get more than one disc of a particular volume due to this obvious negligence. Someone's already not gotten a digital copy code, so I imagine there's other problems with other peoples orders as well.
Then there's something that utterly baffles me, which NO other company in the history of the world has done before & I hope will NEVER do EVER again. They put tape on the tops & bottoms of the slipcovers for both, which I feel was to aid in the shipping, but when you put tape, on a slipcover, that's very sticky, if you're not too careful when taking it off, you can easily rip the printing off of the slipcover &, in turn, ruin it for collectors at least. The closest I've ever seen with a company doing this is FUNimation putting ""Discs made in Mexico"" clear stickers on the slipcovers for the DBZ Kai season sets, which they haven't done before, or since as far as I can tell. Same kind of tape, but way more potentially damaging because they were always put on the outside of the slipcovers in the most horrible of places, so they covered certain things, or disrupted parts of the images, but if you were to remove them, you'd have to peel with care so the detailing wouldn't get pulled off with it. Seriously, Lionsgate, NEVER do this AGAIN if you people plan on doing the same thing with Samurai, a rerelease of Super Samurai, Dino Charge, Dino Supercharge, &/or any other future season.
My god, Saban. Why couldn't you have given the rights to seasons after RPM to Shout! Factory? They actually care about what they get subcontracted to release. Lionsgate just doesn't. Not only that, but you're letting them release DVD sets of Super Sentai, PRs source material. You're not helping out outside of negotiations, I believe, but you ARE not afraid to let them do it after all these years, unlike Disney. I would gladly give up the UV codes just to have them release the seasons rather than Lionsgate. At least then, the sets would all match on my shelf in aesthetics.

Heed these warnings if you think of buying this for some kid, its a VERY disappointing rerelease & so unnecessarily frustrating like the season it contains on the discs.",1468368000,7,6369,4.619593998234775
7764935,1,B01GP4HSNQ,"Even if this product is not released yet, I can say don't bother buying this series. I hate the fact they messed up the 20 anniversary because the bad writing and bad acting. I would not even pay a dollar for this season and Megaforce as well. Don't say because its Power Rangers or its a kid show, that is no excuse at all. I wish for the series to be redone properly and effectively for all fans not just kids. Now I was still excited to see the veteran rangers and action scenes, but where is the story? Why is it not explained? And why are unadapted super sentai teams in the background? Why not create new footage? Don't give me it was too expensive or not time. We created new footage for power rangers before and we can't even do that. I bet that we fans could create something much better. If you want a good story then see Gokaiger that it was adapted from. I enjoy that series better than what the USA came up with. Oh wait! Its still filmed in New Zealand. And the name Super Megaforce what a laugh. I am sorry but there is no point in buying this. If other fans want to buy this product, then go ahead. I have nothing against any fan who wants to purchase the season. I would only stream it not buy it. I an a big fan too but I don't want to own this. But I am glad for the improvement in Dino (super) Charge and thank Saban for that season.",1467763200,11,1353,4.071161048689139

7764988,3,B01GP4HSNQ,"First this doesn't have the original episodes 19 and 20. Instead they are replaced with the extended Legendary Battle DVD which combined those episodes with more footage. This isn't missing any other episodes like people are saying because there were no specials in Super Megaforce, aside from the extended one. They were thinking of original Megaforce. Second, this is basically a repackaging of the other DVD Lionsgate released. Not sure about others but the inside of my case was broken. On the last disk holder half the push button broke. Not that big a deal for me since I put all my DVDs in a DVD binder. And the DVDs weren't in the proper order. I had to go by the back of the case to put them in the proper order as they aren't numbered but named after episodes of this season. Again, repackaging from the original DVD releases. Overall I have to say I'm disappointed that Shout Factory no longer makes new Power Rangers DVDs but it makes sense.

I didn't really care for this Megaforce season as it was a dissapointment as an anniversary to the series and as a whole in general. At least Dino Charge gets it right though.  Only got it to have a complete Powers DVD collection.",1485475200,4,1185,4.5327102803738315

7764995,4,B01GP4HSNQ,"Thank you Lionsgate for sending us this DVD set to review!

This is the first time my kids have watched Power Rangers and they enjoyed this series.  My son more so than my daughters, though they related with the female rangers.  This collection ends in a cliff-hanger and is missing the holiday episodes so I wouldnt really consider it complete.  However, the less than $10 asking price is still pretty reasonable for twenty episodes and seven hours of entertainment.

The first episode introduces the high school students soon to be the next generation of Power Rangers.  Troy, who becomes the red ranger, is good at handling adversity and is a martial arts expert.  Gia, with her calm demeanor, morphs into the yellow ranger.  Emma is Gias best friend and appreciates nature; she transforms into the pink ranger.  The nerdy, but likable Noah becomes the blue ranger.  Last but not least is Jake, who is strong, has a crush on Gia, and turns into the black ranger.

The character development is decent and held the interest of my daughters while my son likes the battle scenes with the insect-like alien invaders.  The special effects are cheesy and make Sharknado look like Avatar.  Each episode features a new insect-like invader with a different method to thwart the Power Rangers and to take over the world.  Thankfully, their plans get squashed every time until the final episode.  I won't know the result of the epic battle until the next season of the Super Megaforce Power Rangers.

One thing I can count on is that the battle formula doesnt change much.  At first the Power Rangers try to subdue the invader with hand to hand combat.  If that doesnt work they start to use their weapons and then switch to their mega weapons.  If more force is necessary then the Zords come out and ultimately combine into the Mega Zord to finish off the attacker.

While this show has a lot of tacky special effects and violence, it does teach some good moral lessons as well.  The value of friendship and team work is shown as crucial to a successful outcome.  Believing in yourself is also expounded upon along with the value of honesty.

There is much to like in this DVD set for current and future Power Ranger fans. I know my kids enjoy the show and that the epic theme song gets stuck in my head shorty after hearing it.  My children are looking forward watching the next season.",1477785600,,2379,4.649880095923262

7765010,3,B01GP4HSNQ,"I am staying away from reviewing the seasons themselves, the less that I say about them, the more I can say about these DVDs. These DVD sets are about as lazy as the seasons themselves, though.

Each disc is just a copy of the same DVD as released individually in volume style releases. They still have the volume titles on them. Megaforce doesn't contain either of the holiday specials, despite the included digital code allowing access to those episodes through Vudu. Super Megaforce contains the ""extended movie"" version of The Legendary Battle, which removes The Wrath from being a standalone to just the first half of this disc's ""movie."" This is particularly interesting as the Vudu digital library has the episodes separate, and as originally broadcast.

These DVDs are made particularly more infuriating compared to the archival season releases from Shout! Factory as they are single layer DVDs, only allowing four or five episodes a disc as opposed to dual-layer DVDs that allow six to eight episodes a disc. With those dual layer discs, these sets could have easily been three discs each, including the holiday specials, and fit into one six disc case. The only reason I don't take any more stars off for that is they are so cheap. An archival season from Shout! is about the same as both of these sets together. The missing episodes on disc, however, mean I have to spend extra to get those episodes on a DVD.

Bottom line: Only buy these if you haven't bought any other Megaforce or Super Megaforce DVD release, as you'll get nothing new here except for a digital code that only grants SD access on Vudu.",1475798400,,1616,4.764285714285714

And that just the tip of issues.

8763281,5,B01GP4HSNQ,"Power Rangers Super Megaforce is the 21st season of the ""Power Rangers"" franchise and continues the 20th anniversary celebration of the series by having the rangers earn a new upgrade to not only their suits but also weapons and zords. The Japanese source footage for this season is called ""Kaizoku Sentai Gokaiger"" which for the ""Super Sentai"" series was their 35th anniversary. ""Super Megaforce"" begins with the invasion of the Armada  that turns out to be the ""main invasion"" of Earth that was suppose to happen after Warstar attempts to take over Earth. The overwhelming attack leads the rangers to gain new powers by using ranger keys to unlock ""Super Mega Mode"". While their initial suit from last season ""Power Rangers Megaforce"" where it's footage from that season came from ""Tensou Sentai Goseiger"" remains as the main suit ""Super Mega Mode"" allows to upgrade their suits to pirate like outfits (despite the fact that not only is pirates not a motif of this season but is not even mentioned by anyone over their pirate themed suits and zords) and even morph again into ""Legendary Mode"" where they can use powers from past rangers from the past 20 years!

While this is a great way to honor past rangers and there ranger powers this also becomes flawed due to the fact that up to five Pre-Zyuranger suits (the source footage of the very first season of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers) have been used that has never been adapted into the Power Ranger series at all with it's only explanation being they are powers ""never before seen on Earth"". The pre-zyu suits used came from Dairanger (although the white ranger suit was used for Power Rangers in seasons 2 and 3), Maskman, Flashman, Changeman, and Fiveman all Super Sentai series that were never adapted into a Power Ranger series only leaving a huge confusion for the viewers not to mention major continuity errors.

Despite ""Super Megaforce"" unwilling to stick to ideas formed by Power Rangers almost making it like a ""Super Sentai 2"" that has no place in a Power Rangers franchise leading to writing and editing issues I still love this season for it's action packed sequences, occasional originality such as Orion's backstory (the silver and sixth ranger), and of course when the rangers use ranger suits and powers from actual Power Ranger seasons. It seems while this season lacks in story depth it's more then talented for it's action scenes and yes despite how Sentai heavy this season is there are still plenty of new footage involving out of suit and Goseiger suit fighting scenes that I just love! Power Rangers Super Megaforce is a season of many flaws but out of those flaws comes a generally great season with Emma and Orion being my personal favorites! So being a minority in this I still consider this season a ""Super Mega win""",1520640000,,2801,4.8070539419087135
8763282,5,B01GP4HSNQ,"I love all of my Power Rangers seasons, this one included. I was very happy with this purchase. The one thing that does bother me is that this so-called ""Complete Season"" is missing the two holiday specials: ""Raising Spirits"" & ""The Robo Knight Before Christmas."" It doesn't make sense why they have to be purchased separately from the Complete Seasons.",1517961600,,353,4.9
