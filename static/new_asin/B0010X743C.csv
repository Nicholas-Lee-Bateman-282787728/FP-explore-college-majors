8239139,5,B0010X743C,"My toddler is OBSESSED with this series & the few dvds that are available are treasures in our house. I only wish there were more available, especially since the show has been removed from all networks & Netflix as of 1-2016. I would be willing to pay a lot of $ for any of these episodes not available on mass produced DVD!",1464480000,,324,4.241935483870968

This is what educational programming should be all about.  Thanks for keeping the bar set high Sesame Street!  (-:",1363564800,2,261,4.586956521739131
8239144,5,B0010X743C,My daughter LOVES this dvd and it automatically starts so she was able to play in her room with it in the background and she was free to stop to pay attention to all her favorite parts,1298764800,,184,4.0
8239145,5,B0010X743C,"I love watching Play with me Sesame. It has some of the familiar Sesame Street muppets. Not only is it very educational, it can also make learing fun. I especailly love to sing a lot of the songs they present in the series. I even dance to some of the songs, too. At least not everything about being a kid has to die even though you grow up.",1282867200,2,341,4.029411764705882

8239147,4,B0010X743C,"This is a nice 2-disc set that includes one DVD of imagination-and-fantasy oriented films, and a second CD-ROM of interactive games.  Much of it will be familiar to ""Sesame"" fans who have watched the  TV show or other DVD collections, or visited the ""Sesame Street"" CTW website. The CD-ROM disc mostly recycles material from the website... This approach has its plusses and minuses.  Kids who haven't already plugged into the online Street site may enjoy the various games, although kids who have already been online will have probably already explored most of this material.  The CD-ROM versions have the advantages of better sound and sharper graphics, and not being dependent on Internet connectivity to function properly.  One odd detail is that many of the game that loop endlessly on the website often end abruptly here (especially if you don't engage the program)  Although kids may want them to go on longer, parents may find themselves thankful that they don't... especially the ones that feature Elmo's sweet little voice... This collection's theme is based on imagination -- the video portion includes a lot of material that previously was gathered on an earlier ""Let's Pretend"" video... which makes the added games a nice bonus feature.  Like all ""Sesame"" material, it's great for little kids.  (ReadThatAgain kid-related web reviews)",1205971200,3,1346,5.199074074074074
