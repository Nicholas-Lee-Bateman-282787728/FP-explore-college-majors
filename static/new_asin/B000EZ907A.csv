8115993,5,B000EZ907A,"This DVD is a wonderful exposition of the beauty and breadth of fireworks. It gives an overview of the history of fireworks beginning with the Chinese and up to fairly recent days including such firework families as the Zambelli family. For those of us who are in states that limit the sale and or the display of fireworks, this DVD will fill a need to see them at home and to fulfill
your curiosity of how they are made. Many people do not realize that fireworks is an ""art"", the
art of ""pyrotechny"" which is the more technical term attached to fireworks. We often tend to
think of fireworks as just  firecrackers for kids. This DVD gives a great overview of the art and
practice of fireworks - pyrotechny. The truly great aerial displays that are professionally produced are just one example of this art. Anyone who has viewed a NOVA production will appreciate this DVD.",1356048000,,872,4.589743589743589
8115994,5,B000EZ907A,"Product:  This is an entertaining yet educational video about the history of fireworks.  The balance between the history and explosions of fireworks was just right to keep my middle school rocketry class engaged.

Vendor:  The product arrived promptly.  The product arrived in the exact condition as described by the vendor.  I would buy from this vendor again.",1338768000,,361,5.245614035087719
8115995,5,B000EZ907A,"The other reviewers are all right on about this dvd. We loved it.  I'm only going to add that I was enticed by Amazon to order Kaboom with this DVD and I found out that Kaboom is a double DVD with Fireworks included.  So, now i have two dvds with Fireworks (its the same show). Tried to return fireworks and Amazon whacked me $9 + shipping for the return. Only got $6 back. RIP! Don't fall for Amazon's enticements. Order Kaboom instead of this dvd and get both Dvd's which are great.",1262995200,,484,4.25
8115996,4,B000EZ907A,"It has great content for people who would like to get to know the fireworks industry.  But if you only like to view the beautiful fireworks, and would like to keep it as a collection in your 'be loved' library, you might feel uncomfortable of the part that show the accident with carrying bodies. I think it would be nice if they just used newspaper title without those uncomfortable images. Other than that, it's a great film.",1200614400,6,427,4.545454545454546
8115997,5,B000EZ907A,"If you like fireworks, this DVD is perfect for you! This is full of fun, facts, history past, and history present.  It tells how fireworks are created, the chemical's used, the different types and styles of fireworks, the chemical compounds and salts used, and even the dangers of the manufacturing processes. It speaks of the Zambelli family and other firework makers.

This DVD from NOVA is put together exceptionally well and is very educational. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is interested in this genre of pyrotechnic entertainment!&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/NOVA-Fireworks/dp/B000EZ907A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">NOVA - Fireworks!</a>",1198886400,3,701,6.368421052631579
