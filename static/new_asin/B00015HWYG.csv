1972034,5,B00015HWYG,"I am a 24 year old who grew up on these stories as a child.  I loved the cartoon and would have my mother tape them on Saturday mornings.  I was quite young when the Care Bears came out and I was never scared by them.  In fact, I have re-watched this DVD and find no reason for a child to be frightened unless they have been sheltered.  These stories present consequences and show that while the Care Bears live in a soft, colorful world, even they have their share of problems.  Give your child a chance to experience stories that portray cause and effect on their level.",1115596800,14,572,4.2592592592592595
1972035,2,B00015HWYG,"I suppose this is a little scary but less so then Wonka or Oz and my daughter loves it.  So as much as I hate it, it isn't for me but her.  All of these ""scary"" DVDs teach them lessons that they should listen to their parents or adult authority and if they don't, bad things happen.",1110326400,2,282,3.9298245614035086
8006734,3,B00015HWYG,"The Care Bears deliver a great message to children, and their voices are probably very soothing for children to listen to, but I don't talk baby talk to my grand kids, so I find some of the voices a little more like a whine and somewhat irritating. I give the content and B plus for positive behavior, but the video quality quality is just not up to par, at least in my opinion. With all the new technology available, I would think the sound and special effects would be better in these videos. It's hard to hold a toddler's attention with such a basic video, but I do love the idea behind the lessons!",1470096000,,602,4.2894736842105265
8006735,5,B00015HWYG,Care Bears just as you remember them from the 1980s. Children today sill love watching these episodes and they help to teach younger children life lessons.,1404172800,,155,5.0
8006736,1,B00015HWYG,"Yes, there are villains in Care Bears including demons and other villains who clearly want to feed on fear. My preschool-age daughter was not scared when she watched these cartoons, and as her parent, I will be teaching her the reality of good and evil in this world. But, we will not be watching any more Care Bears. There are so many better ways to do that, and there are SO many better choices out there. Veggie Tales does a great job of handling many difficult topics in their videos such as facing fears, having courage, being unfairly treated, and facing life's troubles. Kipper and Pocoyo are both simple and clear in their messages regarding friendship and caring. Caillou demonstrates a lot of that as well, along with showing strong, positive roles from Caillou's parents and grandparents. I know many think Care Bears is no big deal, but young children are ""walking sponges"". What they view is a big deal, so don't settle for all the visual ""junk food"" out there.",1365206400,,974,4.701754385964913
8006737,3,B00015HWYG,"My daughter and I love the original Care Bear Series. She was a little startled by ""No Heart"" but that didn't last long.",1311033600,,120,4.260869565217392
8006738,5,B00015HWYG,Both of my daughters love this dvd.  They have already watched it about 10 in the past few days.,1262476800,,96,4.052631578947368
8006739,4,B00015HWYG,Great for the pre-school age and early school age child.  The Care Bears are definitely popular again and this is a great little video for the money.  It keeps her thrilled with the little stories and she doesn't even notice any lessons attached!,1236211200,,246,4.6976744186046515
8006740,5,B00015HWYG,"Compared to all the cartoons out for children these days, these cartoons are like a breath of fresh air. The Care Bears are gentle and loving, and each cartoon teaches a lesson. What impressed me the most is they gently touched on the topic of death of a loved one. In one of the episodes, a giant, who is a minor character, falls into a deep sleep, and the Care Bear cubs, Hugs and Tugs, are unable to wake him up. This saddens them, and then Baby Tugs becomes angry, because he thinks it's not fair. Tenderheart Bear explains to the cubs that the giant would not want them to be sad or angry, he would want them to remember the love that they shared, and the good times that they had. I was so surprised to see a children's cartoon touch on this in such a gentle way. I think it leaves an open door for parents to discuss serious matters such as the death of a loved one with their children after this episode.

As far as some of the reviews stating that the villain ""No-Heart"" is too scary for their child, unfortunately I can't give an informed opinion on that topic. When I was 2-3 years old, the only villain the Care Bears had to face was Professor Coldheart. By the time No-Heart came out, I was around 7, so he was obviously not scary to me. My nephew is 2, and when he watched it with me, he thought No Heart, Beastly and Shreeky were funny, so I think it all depends on the child.",1190332800,2,1391,4.171003717472119
8006741,5,B00015HWYG,"When I was little, I loved watching the Care Bears on t.v.! It was my favorite show. I even had a couple of stuffed Care Bears and some kind of Care Bear Play-do toy. Watching the Care Bears now as a twenty-two-year-old college kid sure brings back happy memories! I think it's great that they're bringing back those terrific cartoons of the eighties, like Care Bears, Smurfs, Fraggle Rock, and others!

I can understand why some younger kids might get scared by some of the bad guys in The Care Bears, because one of them used to spook me a bit, too! But those little bears always made me laugh when I was little and I absolutely loved them! Bedtime Bear is my favorite, and for Christmas last year, my best friend gave one to me! Again, it's great that they're bringing back these great toys from the eighties!

Care Bears may be a little lovey-dovey, but it was my favorite show as a kid, and I think kids today would love it too!",1122508800,5,933,4.35632183908046
8006742,5,B00015HWYG,"What is the deal with all of these people who find the ""Care Bears"" too scary for their children to watch?? Yes- they always have a ""villain/bad guy"" in the episodes- what cartoon, or any other type of show, for that matter- does not?  If you are searching for entertainment for your kids that does not portray any sort of conflict or negativity, maybe you should discard your TV set and stick to singing lullabies to your kids.  The ""Care Bears"" cartoons are full of conflict resolution in a peaceful manner, and by trying your best, working hard, etc.- plenty of good values and kid-friendly stuff, if you ask me. If your kids are frightened by every scene in a ""Care Bears"" cartoon, I would suggest the problem lies with parents are who are bent on sheltering their children from every possible moment that is not sunshine, roses and eternal bliss; and not with the ""Care Bears"" or any other cartoon series aimed at young children.  These cartoons are great- my three-year-old daughter loves them, and pretends that she is a Care Bear all the time!!!",1116806400,12,1053,4.650537634408602
