7149020,1,B00WR531SY,"Four Blood Moons combines reenactments with interviews with religious experts such as John Hagee and Mark Biltz who popularized the Four blood moons phenomenon, as well as political historians like David Barton, Dinesh D'Souza and Erick Stakelbeck. The production values for the reenactment scenes (set in 1493, 1948 and 1967) are surprisingly high but they're not very interesting and there's no coherent plot so it got boring pretty quickly. Most of the time it feels like a commercial about Israel. And as for the ""experts"", we now know the four blood moons came and went and nothing happened ,except that John Hagee became even richer from his Four Blood Moons book. I believe the blood moon theory has been pretty much debunked; the previous ""feast tetrads"" didn't actually coincide with the things Biltz and Hagee claim they did.",1448150400,3,835,5.057971014492754

7149070,5,B00WR531SY,"I agree with D. Kennedy's review on August 10, 2015.  I didn't want to watch this DVD because of previous information I had been given on the subject.  It wasn't the facts of the Four Blood Moons over the past 500 years that pushed me away, but the way people presented these historical occurrences.

Last week someone loaned me this DVD, and I watched it.  Because it is such an impressive professional production, and because it is so factual and scientific (without preaching), I was able to watch it with a friend who is not a Christian.  She was enthralled and wants her own copy to share with her husband and with other people.  She is a scientist, and loves it because it is not preachy and shares actual science and history.  She learned many things that she hadn't known before about the Blood Moons, their connection with Israel, and events and miracles surrounding them.  Her question to me was, ""Why haven't people been reporting these events and miracles?""  She is investigating further.

Like Mr. Kennedy, I too would have given it more than 5 stars if more had been available.",1441152000,6,1091,4.664921465968586

7149078,5,B00WR531SY,"I bought this video from Walmart - sorry Amazon. Same price and got it instantly. For the vast majority of this movie Hagee sticks to the historical facts and keeps his misleading teaching out of this movie. It is accurate. with perhaps a little poetic licence concerning the yellow Jewish star given to Columbus by the young Jewish girl. When watching the portion concerning the miraculous war events in Israel it reminded me much of the video of the many miracles  during the American revolution. I saw that one back 93 and I wish I knew the name of it.  However this one is on target, if you like history and are tired of seeing God's hand expunged from the pages of history by the rabid secularists you will like this video.",1440460800,5,728,4.507575757575758

Pastor John Hagee spearheads this  enlightening yet controversial topic within this dramatic, movie-style documentary on this color, educational, single-disc, DVD. Through the centuries, the age-old divide even among the learned minds of theologians and Christian scholars, centers around the planets. Specifically: Does the Sun, the Moon, the Planets and the Stars, and whatever else is out there in the celestial body and the rest of the vast universe, can and do they in anyway, shape or form, influence human beings and their behavior? Is astrology, which is also known as: Astral Science, credible? Can Christians be affected by and utilize a BLOOD MOON and the rest of the planets, and still remain God-fearing Christians? Because the truth of the matter is: That the Sun (a planet and a light), heats us all. Whether Christian or not. And when another planet and reflective light of the Sun - the Moon, is full... it not only effects the tides of the oceans but the whole of mankind, who are comprised of three quarters water. Again, whether Christian or not. And what about the three Magi/Kings from the East who were Astrologers from the Orient? Who correctly predicted the birth of a King? That being, Jesus. The Risen Christ! Who... mind you, was not just any King, but the ""King of kings?!"" They accurately calculated that He would be born in Judaea, Israel and then they themselves, travelled a great distance following the Star of Bethlehem, to worship at the feet of Jesus. And presented Him - not the star or planetary conjunction, with gifts that were fit for a King: Gold, frankincense and myrrh. ""Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea, in the days of Herod the king, and behold, there came WISE MEN from the East to Jerusalem, saying: 'Where is He (Jesus) that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen HIS STAR in the East, and are COME TO WORSHIP HIM' (and not the star, the planets or the conjunction). When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all of Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born. And they said unto him, 'In Bethlehem of Judaea: For thus it is written by the Prophet,... and thou, Bethlehem, in the Land of Judaea, art not the least among the princes of Judaea. For out of thee shall come a Governor, that shall rule My People, Israel. Then Herod, when he had privily called the WISE MEN, inquired of them diligently what time THE STAR, appeared. And he (Herod) sent them (the Magi/Kings) to Bethlehem, and said, 'Go and search diligently for the Young Child (Jesus); And when ye have found Him, bring me word again, that I may come and worship Him, also.' When they had heard the king, they departed; And lo, THE STAR which they saw in the East, went before them, till it came and stood over where the Young Child, was. When they saw THE STAR, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy. And when they were come into the house, they (the ""WISE MEN""...who were Magi/Kings and Astrologers) saw the Young Child (Jesus) with Mary His Mother, and FELL DOWN AND WORSHIPPED HIM (not THE STAR); And when they had opened their treasures, THEY PRESENTED UNTO HIM GIFTS: Gold and frankincense and myrrh"" (Matthew 2:1-11 KJV). So  again: Is astrology credible? What about astronomy? How does it tie into all of this? Can Christians utilize the planets, the moon and the stars (which the Lord Himself, created = Genesis 1:14-18 KJV), as a navigational overview, as a blueprint guide as corresponding to their natal chart (personal horoscope), and still remain good Christians? Keep in mind, that prior to the advent of the computer, ship captains and their crew members many of whom were staunch Christians, utilized the stars as a navigational compass to sail the Seven Seas. And whether Christian or not, the stars and the planets, do influence humanity in more ways then one, whether one chooses to believe it or not. And time and again, personal and historical events such as births, deaths, marriages, the outbreak of war and the time of subsequent peace, have all  been correctly predicted by planetary aspects, as calculated by reputable astrologers. For as history will attest..., when the Lord Jesus Christ was born, there was a Jupiter/Saturn planetary conjunction - a NEW STAR in the heavens, which symbolized and heralded the birth of a King, like none other. Jesus. The Promised, Manifested and Risen, MESSIAH! The placement of the conjunction was so specific, that the three Magi/Kings who were not Jewish nor Christians but rather Astrologers from the Far East, were able to pinpoint that the birth of the Messiah would be in the Province of Judaea, within the Land of Israel. Mere coincidence? No! Not hardly! Like it or not, it was all planetary specifics as predicted, noted and acted upon by the ""WISE MEN"" (Magi/Kings), who happened to be proficient Astrologers. And, that is why, some Christians say ""yes"" to astrology and planetary influence, while others adamantly say ""no"", too any celestial influence of any kind. But in reality, one can not simply ignore the sun, the moon and the stars and pretend, that the planets and their impact on mankind, don't exist. Or that the 12 constellations within the nightly sky, the star formations which comprise and are referred too as: The 12 Signs of the Zodiac, aren't there. Throwing out the baby with the  bath water and harsh, needless and excessive legalism, can be constricting and taken to the extreme, can cause unnecessary mental and spiritual bondage. Fear and idolatrous ignorance are contributing factors, as well. These types of Christians say that according to the Holy Bible, any sort of planetary guidance or belief in the celestial bodies - the Sun, the Planets, the Moon and the Stars, is absolutely forbidden. Never mind the fact, that the Lord made them and put them there, for a reason. Namely: For our benefit. They also cite the Book of Daniel within the Old Testament and also, the scripture which states: ""There shall not be found among you anyone that maketh his son or daughter to pass through the fire (a pagan practice based on superstition), or that useth divination or an observer of times or an enchanter, or a witch. Or a charmer or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard or a necromancer. For all that do these things are an abomination unto the Lord"" (v. 10-12); ""For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened onto observers of times and unto diviners: But as for thee, the Lord my God hath not suffered thee to do so"" (Deuteronomy 18:10-12 & 14 KJV). ""For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness, is as iniquity and idolatry..."" (I Samuel 15:23 KJV). With that having been said, how then, do God-fearing Christians who adhere to the FOUR BLOOD MOONS, reconcile and get around the fact, that they are guilty of being ""observers of times"" and ""diviners"", according to planetary alignments and conjunctions? Now, keep in mind, that this is the same Moon that shines every night for both Christians and non, all over the world. And, how do the FOUR BLOOD MOONS make sense, as relating to Bible Prophecy? Pastor John Hagee, who wrote the book with the same title: FOUR BLOOD MOONS, answered that question and more, this way: ""Astrology is a false science that leads to the worship of the stars, which is considered witchcraft and is forbidden within the Holy Bible. Astronomy is a true science that measures size and motion of the stars and planets. And the FOUR BLOOD MOONS is a combination of the true science and the Bible, specifically Bible Prophecy. For example in Joel 3; Acts 2; the Four Gospels and the Book of Revelation. In that, only God can cause the Sun, the Moon and the Earth, in a direct alignment to produce a BLOOD MOON. Secondly, these FOUR BLOOD MOONS are occurring on certain set dates that are set within the Holy Bible, thousands of years ago and on the Holy Days, such as Passover and the Feast of Tabernacles, which is no coincidence."" So answered, Pastor John Hagee - Founder and Senior Pastor of the Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas. From a four-man panel discussion and debate which is included on this interesting FOUR BLOOD MOON visual presentation. This color, single-disc, DVD which studies this unique planetary alignment down through the Ages and how it affects humanity today, is approximately 124-minutes long and comes complete with numerous examples of how biblical prophecy, mankind and the formation of planetary alignments are intertwined. Hagee however, fails to mention that astrology can also pinpoint dates, places and prophetic occurrences, using the very same moon, stars, planets and universe which the Holy Bible lists, as well. Neither does he mention that Astral Science (more commonly known as: Astrology), which is the concentrated study of the celestial bodies known as the 12 Signs of the Zodiac, are consistently calculated and definitively computed by exact mathematics as per ones birth date, birth time, the longitude and latitude of where one was born, in what city, state and country. It is all very precise. The charts are printed out from a computer printer and are very specific in their geographic and mathematical calculations and outlook. And astrology can and consistently has..., accurately predicted historical events, as relating to presidents of nations and royalty all over the world. And, when the Lord was crucified on the Cross of Golgotha which in Hebrew, means: Place of the Skull, and shed His atoning, cleansing and delivering Blood for the whole of mankind, there was also an: Eclipse of the Sun. ""Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour"" (Matthew 27:45 KJV), ""and the sun was darkened"" (Luke 23:45 KJV; See also Mark 15:33 KJV). An Eclipse - is the overshadowing or passing of one heavenly body in front of another for a certain period of time, which results in an unusual darkness during the course of the eclipse. And since, the Lord was crucified at ""...the third hour"" (Mark 15:25 KJV), darkness engulfed the terrified witnesses until the light of the sun had returned, and the eclipse had passed. And, when the pagan worshipping, superstititous, seekers of signs who believed that their Emperor was divine - the Roman People, the Roman Soldiers and a certain Roman Centurion, who stood at the base of the Cross and witnessed this planetary ""darkness"" phenomenon... suddenly!, ""saw the light"" spiritually and physically, after a simultaneous earthquake had subsided. The Bible records this event, stating: ""And the people feared greatly, saying 'Truly this was the Son of God'"" (Matthew 27:54 KJV). And referring to Jesus, ""...when the (Roman) Centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, 'Certainly this was a Righteous Man...'"" (Luke 23:47 KJV). So, are people reading that portion of the New Testament, just supposed to ignore that reference? Because they don't want to be known as ""observers of time"", ""diviners"" or ""consulters"" of any sort? Dear Reader, are you beginning to see the harshness of legalism, fear and ignorance? In that, the sun, moon, the planets and the stars, are good for the one (biblical predictions and prophecies), but not good for the other (navigational & mathematical astrology charts). So, suffice it to say, that there is no hocus-pocus or witchcraft involved in astrology. And no, it does not lead to witchcraft, either. The Holy Bible does not record any witchcraft, divination or demonic consultation, when the ""WISE MEN"" - the three Magi/Kings using accurate astrological calculations, predicted the Birth of Jesus! And then, packed up and followed THE STAR, so that they could get to Jesus and worship Him, and Him alone! And the Lord, being that HE IS the Creator of every one and every thing, has the right to use His creation - Mankind, or any of His created elements: The Sun, the Moon, the Planets and the Stars, and is free to utilize whoever or whatever celestial body or single planet, alignment or conjunction that He wants too, in order to navigate and guide His people in their destiny, as per His will for their lives. Again, He used THE STAR to successfully bring the three Magi/Kings unto Himself. And He used an Eclipse of the Sun, to show the Roman Centurion along with other witnesses, that He indeed was, is and forever will be, Jesus the Messiah. The True and Risen, Son of God. And that, even in death... by power of the Holy Spirit, He has the ability too draw men unto Himself. Which at the time, were predominantly pagan worshipping Romans and Greeks. So, who are we - the created dust of the earth, a mere vapor in the scope of eternity, to dare tell the Lord our Creator... who or what, He can and cannot use? (See Romans 1 KJV). For, it must be remembered, that for His own reasons, ""God hath chosen the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise"" (1 Corinthians 1:27 KJV). And, if the Lord can make the Sun stand still and hold the Moon at bay for a whole day for Joshua and the Ancient Israelites, ""...until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies"" (v. 13) while conquering the Land of Canaan, He... in His infinite wisdom, is most certainly not opposed too using planets and planetary aspects to communicate and shape Mankind, to His desired will (Joshua 10:13-14 KJV). And although I obviously don't agree with all of Pastor Hagee's opinions, none the less this FOUR BLOOD MOON documentary film depiction is unique, prophetic, informative, educational and interesting. ""...In those days (ours), I (the Lord) will pour out My Spirit (The Holy Spirit). And I will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood and fire and pillars of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord, come"" (Joel 2:29-31 KJV). Nina Kish",1440374400,,14283,4.859253180139516

7149086,1,B00WR531SY,"First off, this film was lent to us by a friend. I already knew before going into this film that John Hagee is a false teacher. Now, before anyone gets offended by me saying that, please allow me to prove my point. In John Hagee's book, ""In Defense of Israel,"" he claims that Jesus didn't come to be the Messiah and also claims that Jesus refused in word and deed to be the Messiah. If you want proof of this, go to Youtube and search ""John Hagee denies Jesus as Messiah"" and you will hear this from his own mouth. Now let's see what the Bible says about this: ""The woman said unto Him, I know well that Messiah shall come, which is called Christ: when He is come, He will tell us all things. Jesus said unto her, I AM HE, that speak unto thee.""- John 4:25-26. Here, Jesus clearly claimed to be the Messiah. As for the deeds, just read through the Gospels and you will find many times that Jesus performed miracles in front of crowds.

Now I will focus on the film itself. One of the biggest problems I have with it is that it doesn't really deal with the subject matter. The blood moons are really only talked about for a few minutes at the beginning and a quick mention at the middle, but that's basically it. In the few minutes they actually do talk about it, they treat it like it's this big warning sign to Israel that something big is coming. The only problem with this is that Israel isn't even able to see the whole first three blood moons of the tetrad, and the fourth they'll only be able to see the beginning of, unless they watch it online. Some warning that is. And the events throughout history that they say lined up with the blood moons tetrads, such as the Spanish Inquisition and the Jewish Independence, actually didn't line up. In those cases the tetrads didn't come until one to two years afterwords. Why would God signal that a major event was coming years after the event took place? It doesn't make sense.

Overall, I would highly warn against this film and John Hagee",1439856000,4,1992,4.337801608579088

7149091,3,B00WR531SY,"Simple point:  A series of Blood moons coinciding with Jewish holidays happened four times (not as surprising as one may think because the Jewish calendar is a lunar calendar).  However every time this happened, something significant happened pertaining to Israel.  First around Columbus leaving for the new world and Jews being saved from the Spanish Inquisition. Second, when Israel became a nation.  Third, during the Six Day war when Israel took in the Old city. Fourth now culminating in September 2015 (next month).  The point is this:  Maybe something will happen around Israel around next month or in this general time period.

It was nice to hear some speakers.  Loved seeing Hugh Ross, Dennis Prager, etc.  It was nice to hear about the miracles that happened int he Six Day war.  However, it was presented in a disjointed way that was difficult to follow and bottom line.",1439596800,10,882,4.938775510204081
7149092,5,B00WR531SY,"I did not think I would like this because of the controversy surrounding Hagee and Mark Biltz. It seemed to many that Hagee had taken credit for Biltz's discovery of the blood moon tetrad on Jewish Feast Days -- which has been underway since last year and ends with the final blood moon on the 28th of September, 2015.

I first learned of Biltz's discovery in 2008 when Biltz was on Prophecy in the News. He did an interview shortly after that with Pastor Ray Bentley. I've been interested in this since that time. However, when Hagee wrote his book in late 2013, after meeting Biltz and learning of Biltz's discovery, there were many who claimed Hagee was not giving enough credit to Biltz. Biltz is in the DVD, but he is not credited with the discovery. Hagee does seem to say he discovered this, but his comment can be interpreted as meaning when he discovered this for himself after going to NASA's website. Still, I was uncomfortable with Hagee's statement. However, I've watched both DVDs now, and this is by far the better of the two.

I was very touched by the re-enactments of miraculous events that surrounded Israel's War of Independence in 1948 and the Six Day War of 1967. I feel sorry for those who consider this religious propaganda and don't believe in miracles. There are miracles, and these miracles are mighty demonstrations of the hand of God.

The four blood moons were not center stage in this DVD. The history of the Jewish people, the miraculous events in Israel's history, and various evidences for God's existence - the God of the Bible - are what take center stage in this DVD.

This DVD is professionally done, and I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could. I rented it, watched half of it, and decided I wanted to own this. I've now purchased the DVD, and I plan to show it to my whole family.",1439164800,40,1821,4.509090909090909
