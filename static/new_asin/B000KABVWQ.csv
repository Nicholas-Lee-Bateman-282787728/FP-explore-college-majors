2686857,3,B000KABVWQ,this movie is as good as George segal can make it,1417219200,,49,3.5454545454545454
2686858,4,B000KABVWQ,Reminds me of a movie seen back in the 60's called Repulsion one of the first done by Polanski!  Flash backs and strange inter-blended scenes of the past and present.  A foray into the timelessness of experience as an excursion into reincarnation and the soul;s undying thirst for justice and completion!,1406073600,,304,4.9411764705882355
2686859,5,B000KABVWQ,this was an excellent movie. It kept me in suspense from beginning to end.. One of the best movies I have watched in a long time.,1396656000,,129,4.0
2686860,1,B000KABVWQ,The basic storyline would seem to be intended as a portrayal of events during the Nazi era. Another reviewer expressed a 'family interest in odd movies.' Perhaps I was expecting some reasonable rational in the plot to emerge . . . it didn't! There was no redeeming feature in the acting or the storyline. Analogy? Worse than the worst 'Twilight Zone' wannabe. It is unusual for me to not appreciate at least some aspect of a plot that I understand. Recommended?  Viewer discretion is definitely advised!,1389484800,2,503,4.848837209302325
2686861,4,B000KABVWQ,"This movie has a great story line and I feel today if they remade it they could really sell this as it has a good mix of not only history and suspense, but it spinkles in a love story.",1361404800,,184,3.7435897435897436
2686862,5,B000KABVWQ,"I saw this movie when it was first released in the '80s.  Have been looking for it for years, first on VHS, then DVD.  A great movie, in the same vein as Devil's Arithmatic"". Believable characters -if you excuse George Segal's lousy performance--Amanda Payes is great. Glad to finally find it.",1230076800,5,293,4.7254901960784315
2686863,4,B000KABVWQ,"The cold room is an original & outstanding piece of work. Our family thought it was a most enjoyable movie, however, it wouldn't be for the average, everyday normal family, no, this movie is for people who indulge in unique movies. There isn't anything like this elsewhere. I'ts a rare abnormal treasure!",1197763200,3,304,4.865384615384615
2686864,2,B000KABVWQ,"The idea was interesting.  A 16 year old girl who is visiting East Germany with her father is drawn into the past, to the Nazi era. The idea is the only good aspect to the movie, however.  First you have a bad script. Throughout the entire movie George Segal mostly just repeats himself - ""I'm ashamed of you, Carla."" ""I expected better of you, Carla"".  ""I'm disappointed in you, Carla"".  That's about it. Amanda Pays, who showed great acting potential, is wasted with similar banal lines.  The lighting is dark and dreary - if it were not for the one red car, the viewer would think the film was Black and White. The music is awful - from the opening credits it grates on the nerves and does not set the mood in various scenes. Finally - the film is flat out boring.  In the first hour nothing happens other than the viewer grasping the fact that this teenage girl resents her father and they do not have a close relationship. There are three quick flashes into the past - so brief that the girl seems to dismiss them immediately afterwards and so do those who are watching. During the remainder of the movie, the character moves back and forth in time, and its confusing which time period she is actually in.  I really wanted to like this movie - I REALLY liked the possibilities.. but after the climax and resolution it turned out to be one of those movies that is forgotten by the next day.",1193529600,2,1394,4.400778210116732
2686885,1,B000KABVWQ,Awful!,1462406400,,6,6.0
2686886,4,B000KABVWQ,"This is a movie you have to pay attention, to understand what is going on.  The daughter keeps going back and forth from the present to the Nazi past.  kind of a ending that makes you wonder what really happened to the girl and the guy  (jew) and how it got mixed up with the present.",1461024000,,284,4.035714285714286

2686890,1,B000KABVWQ,It was boring!,1440115200,,14,4.0
2686891,4,B000KABVWQ,This is a very unusual film. The time is post World War II in what was then East Germany. George Segal plays a father who is some what estranged from his teenage daughter. While in East Germany the daughter starts to believe she is the woman who lived in that room during the war. it is interesting and well acted.,1431734400,,314,4.25

2686894,1,B000KABVWQ,"I had high expectations for this film, hoping to catch a glimpse of East Germany during the Cold War. Moreover, the story was reputed to include an element of time travel, which is a genre that I enjoy. But The Cold Room is an unmitigated mess. Never does director James Dearden make an effort to clarify what is happening on screen. Is Carla Martin the same person as Christa Bruckner, or is she a lookalike or distant relative? Does she actually return to the days of Nazi Germany, or is this simply a dream sequence? Who rapes her, if indeed she is raped at all, and why does Carla stab her own father instead of Christa stabbing Wilhelm, the butcher? And why does Carla's father, Hugh Martin, arrange for a father-daughter reunion in East Germany, of all places? Nothing is explained by final curtain, so the audience is left to wonder why they have invested an hour and a half of their lives in watching this dismal, boring story slowly unfold upon itself. It is difficult to sympathize with any of the characters. George Segal is a smiling, long-suffering wimp, hardly changing expression or attitude - - even after being stabbed in the chest by his own daughter. He has learned nothing about her, except that she might be a tad mentally unbalanced. Amanda Pays seems to be a good actress, but her character is hopelessly self-centered and spoiled. Who can really blame her for being confused about what is happening around her? Even reading ahead in the script would provide not a clue!",1418688000,,1493,4.659090909090909

The characters are one dimensional and not likeable, bratty teenager, weak and selfish father and blond silent girlfriend for father. There is some paranormal in here but  did not grab me.

You might think that the whole movie is given away at the beginning when they post the definition of POSSESSION!  This DOES NOT SPOIL ANYTHING!  In FACT it makes you WONDER ""WHAT IS REAL""?  Is she really going CRAZY?  I do not want to SPOIL THE BULK of the movie!  Suffice it to say  GEORGE SEGAL & AMANDA PAYS ARE FABULOUS in this movie!  For her first outing AMANDA PAYS looked like a ""TROOPER"" and was totally Believable!  THANKS to MILL CREEK and the 250 MOVIE HORROR PACK!!  WATCH THIS MOVIE!  I will watch this one again!  Buy it now!",1466812800,,715,4.351145038167939
