1385351,3,B000050IL8,"I am a newer fan of this series and I enjoy it very much.  That's all I'm going to say about the content/storyline of this dvd.
Now the technical side of this DVD definitely has issues.  I do agree that it is a much better quality (though still not exceptional) transfer than the first DVD of this series.  But what kills me is how it ""jumps"" at LITERALLY every cut and edit.  I haven't been able to make it though more than half of episode 5 yet because of it.  I'll try to describe the problem better:
Basically what happens is at every cut the entire picture shifts or scoots down.  It only happens for the first 1 or 2 frames of each cut and then stays until the next cut.  (What I mean by cut is basically a ""camera"" change.  cut- to headshot of someone talking; cut - to headshot of person listening; cut - back to headshot of person talking etc.)  So obviously a cut will happen an infinite amount of times during each episode.  So for the entire picture to shift or drop down at every cut is going to be quite obvious and VERY ANNOYING.  I popped in the the Neon Genesis volume 1 DVD to see if maybe I was on crack but it plays fine.
I have a JVC XV-M65 dvd player and it plays every other dvd in the world just fine so I'm pretty sure it's not me.  The problem is not in any of the menus or previews as far as I can tell - just the episodes themselves.
SO - if you can get past this (which hopefully I eventually will) I'm sure you will enjoy the dvd.  But for those of you are more serious dvd watchers or have large TV's - it just might drive you nuts - so be warned.",978048000,3,1578,4.003194888178914
1385352,5,B000050IL8,"Okay, I hope you didn't get to comfy with the first disc because this ones different. First off, the previews are at the beggining of the DVD (just like Gasaraki). Plus, for all those who hate replacing the Kanji with subtitles, yours prayers have been answered. The original Kanji is back with subtitles. For some, this is good, but for me, its not. The only reason I gave this DVD 5 stars is because the subtitles are easier to read now. That, and the fact that I can still watch my favorite anime in Spanish and French. Bio include Rei, Gendo, Kaji, Auska, Angel 5 and Angel 6. This new DVD will make those familiar with the VHS version feel right at home. And the episodes? Seeing that little fashing moment on the ship in episode 8 was the most hilarious gag I have ever seen in Evangelion. Definetely get this DVD for sure.",977788800,5,829,4.3896103896103895
1385353,5,B000050IL8,"This second Neon Genesis Evangelion disc is a marked improvement over the first one in my opinion, in terms of both DVD quality and the entertainment value of the episodes themselves.  The image quality here is WAY better than the first disc--sure, it's still not as gorgeous as some of the newer anime shows that are turning up on DVD, but considering what ADV had to work with this picture is simply beautiful.  Even better, it doesn't have the ""overlays"" that plagued the earlier disc (where signs and notes that were originally in Japanese were jarringly covered with English language text).  It causes a number of problems with overlapping subtitles in episode 6 if you watch it subbed, but it's always easy to tell what's going on.  The disc automatically plays a few trailers for other ADV shows when you first put it in, but (unlike the annoying automatic trailers on most of Disney's releases) they can easily be skipped by pressing the menu button on your remote.  Like the first disc, there are no extras other than a few character biographies.  As for the episodes themselves, you'll find a couple of really tense action sequences, some foreshadowing of future plot developments, and most importantly the introduction of female leads Asuka and Rei (well, Rei was sort of introduced in the first collection of episodes, but this is where she becomes a major character).  Aside from the occasionally annoying comic relief, this is first-rate anime viewing.  Highly recommended.",976147200,10,1487,4.967741935483871
1385354,5,B000050IL8,"I think Eva on DVD is a great idea. For collectors, it's perfect, especially if you like to watch them once and a while. DVDs are a heck of a lot tougher than the VHS tapes and you don't have to worry about them wearing out. If you are an Eva/anime fan and own a DVD player, you should definetly buy the Eva DVDs. By the way, for those people who put down Evangelion claiming it has no real ending blah blah. Wake up! If you were truly interested in the series, you would know about ""Death and Rebirth"" and ""End of Evangelion"" the two final movies (soon to be released) that sum up all the secrects and give final end to the story. Eva is the best anime I've seen. It explores the depths of human origin and makes you think a little differently about life.",974764800,3,756,4.149659863945578
1385355,4,B000050IL8,"After returning to NERV and resuming his pilot duties, Shinji and his friends meet the Second Child, Asuka Langley Soryu on a battleship carrying her Evangelion Unit to NERV. Their peaceful afternoon on the ship is interrupted by the arrival of Gaghiel, who attempts to destroy Asuka's Evangelion Unit and thus hinder NERV. This episode also shows viewers one of NERV's many terrible secrets.
The following episode introduces my favorite particular angel, Ramiel, whose ultra-dense Absolute Terror Field can only be pierced by a blast from the experimental prototype SDF Positron Cannon. The only problem with this: the Positron Cannon requires an extremely large amount of energy, meaning that all of Asia must go without power while the Cannon is active. Worse still, Ramiel's powerful blasts and dense A.T. Field mean that whoever has the Cannon had better fire before Ramiel does and score a direct hit on the beast . This episode also offers more information on Rei Ayanami's true nature and origins.
This DVD marks the beginning of EVA's shift from mecha/angel battles to introspective psychological discussion. The angels continue to get tougher, the pilots continue to slowly slide into insanity, and Anno's dark themes become ever more visible.",972000000,10,1253,5.2388059701492535

1385369,3,B000050IL8,"The anime series Evangelion is a true master piece. Its brilliant in almost every sense; the plot, the characters, the sidestories, the theme. It's a great work. And for any anime fan, this series should be respected and watched AS a series. Please, buy the Platinum edition with all the episodes.

This Death and Rebirth tries in the first part to provide a summary of the series  It fails miserably; some scenes that work perfectly in an episode are truly awkward in a full feature; the five minutes interval is truly insultingthat time could help explain the story far better and every DVD player has a pause button if you want an interval. The main characters become caricatures and it even doesnt help you to recall most secondary characters names or backgrounds.

The second part (Rebirth) is the prequel to The End of Evangelion  Which is very good, but you will get it if you buyThe End of Evangelion!!! Making this product slightly less than great. Of course, before the launch of the second film, the rebirth part was fabulous. But for nowadays this product might interest only collectors.

If you haven't seen the series DONT BUY THIS FILM. You will have severe difficulties understanding the plot and youll miss one of the greatest anime series ever made. The purpose of the Death part is for fans to remember some main events.",1423180800,,1339,4.754310344827586

1385371,5,B000050IL8,"Love this series! The original far surpasses the Rebuild movies. Sure the animation shines better and some of the CG is fun to watch, but for in depth storytelling Neon Genesis is the way to go.",1416096000,,194,4.416666666666667

One good thing is this version has at least 4 languages including spanish which is good for me. It has no remastered sound nor remastered frames. I also have the platinum collection which I love, it does have remastered audio and enhanced frames!

I'm an evangelion fan so I really like it just a little dissapointed on the false statement ""new"" when its not!",1406592000,,509,4.473118279569892

1385376,5,B000050IL8,"I watched the entire television series, prior to watching End of Evangelion, just so that I would have the context for everything. My advice is, if you don't have time to watch the entire television series, watch End of Evangelion anyway. It is AWWEEESSOME! There is no way to understand all of it, but if you don't have time to watch the tv series, you can watch Death & Rebirth for a brief overview of what the saga is all about.

End of Evangelion will melt your brain and possibly cause you to freak out. I like End of Evangelion even better than the Rebuild films. The end sequence is surreal, beautiful, shocking, calming, disheartening, spiritual, horrifying, and delightful, all at the same time. Same goes for the rest of the film. This is a masterpiece.",1401753600,2,763,4.610294117647059

1385378,1,B000050IL8,"I ended up watching some reviews and clips of Neon Genesis Evangelion and had been told that if you were a fan of anime you had seen this series. Well this series is messed up. It was terrible to sit through it because everyone has some mental problems and Shinji, the main character, has absolutely no courage which for a series where he tries to save the world doesn't fit and by the end of several episodes will have had a mental breakdown. Overall the series may have had fight scenes which were top notch, but way too often the animators saved money by having the same scene too long because nothing happens in it or constantly covering the person's mouth who is talking. The final episodes were a joke, nearly all animation goes away to be replaced by second rate abstract like drawing and in the end while all the characters get this happy moment ending. The story which drove the plot about the attacking angels is left unanswered. So it was a waste of my money and the only good thing about this is that i got most of the money back i spent on this thing selling it to someone else.",1399420800,2,1091,4.352941176470588
1385379,5,B000050IL8,Huge fan of the series and I would recommend it to anyone of my friends! Though I wouldn't consider this the movie but more of a recap on all the episodes and a little bit of the movie!,1397347200,,185,3.8947368421052633
1385380,5,B000050IL8,"While death and rebirth really has no purpose in this day and age it's still a well edited nostalgic trip that's worth your time as ""Hey it's more evangelion"". End however is another beast, it's a cinematic master and my favorite art movie, heck even my favorite movie in general. It just needs to be seen to be believed because it'll either change your life or severely piss you off as expectations should be left at the door for this movie will love subverting them.",1391299200,,468,4.517647058823529
1385381,4,B000050IL8,"Watching the series was amazing, it was exactly as I remembered. My only issue is that opening the package showed damages to the box and, as a collector, this really irks me in all the wrong ways.",1389571200,,196,4.324324324324325
1385382,4,B000050IL8,This is not the end. This film shows the relationship perspective of the creator between each charachter. People seem confused when they watch this. It's a self dedication to the human spirit at odd times auspicious curiousity.,1388707200,,227,5.162162162162162
1385383,1,B000050IL8,"A couple of years ago after a long research I ordered from USA two collections. Trigun and evangelion. Trigun was and is one of the best anime I have seen.
Now about evangelion...there is no way you are above 18, mentally healthy and able to like this anime, for the reason being that the characters are so screwed up that you cannot attach to them. So i don't understand how people like it. I disliked it so much that i sold it on the 1/3 of the price I had bought it. The story did't make sense, there was no humor and the characters where neither heroes nor anti heroes but rather bunch a psychos wandering around. Even in my most troubled &@d up years I could never sympathize with these characters. So keep this in mind, and don't trust the positive reviews like I did back then.

Just because I state how bad it is and you like this anime ( I couldn't care less) doesn't mean that you my review wasn't helpful.
So grendizer, mazinger, geta robo and even voltron ( and robotech in smaller sizes) feels even after almost 30 years classic. They still seem as good as they seemed when I watched them as a kid. I can still watch them and take all the silliness of some of the characters or whatever. But this....I understand the concept of an antihero and I like a lot of those guys (deadpool, lobo, darthvader even the joker) but here we talk about abused, psychotic characters. How can you attach?",1386547200,,1400,4.363984674329502
1385384,5,B000050IL8,"End of Evangelion is honestly a masterpiece. There are no anime films that I've watched as many times as this one and Evangelion isn't even my favorite anime, it's not even in my top 5. Even so, everything about this film is just so good, the script, the animation, the pacing, the music, the plot twists, the first half, the second half, the beginning, the ending, the action, the blood, the gore... I could go on forever. The ending and the last line of dialogue by themselves are both pinnacles in the history of anime. Though, a lot of people may and will be turned off by the 2deep4you and confusing aspects of the second half. I suppose it sometimes gets a little too pretentious, just like the TV series, but after countless re-watches I mostly understand most of what's going on so I can enjoy it. But obviously it's not for everyone and being turned off by it is a valid criticism. Of course the film is enhanced by the fact that at least it's confusing psycho-babble is a lot more understandable and enjoyable than the TV ending, which was atrocious in my opinion. It's just amazing, and as an ending to a popular and ground-breaking series it's unmatched by anything else.

Regarding Death & Rebirth...  I only watched it once and it was very bleh, whatever.",1386460800,,1269,4.56140350877193
1385385,5,B000050IL8,"Evagelion. No words can describe this series, you either love it or hate it, admire it or loathe it, it's one of those animes that is highly talked about for it's religious icongraphy or just for it's sheer animation. The pros and cons depending on how you view it are a mile long. Into mechs, future storys and monsters, this is for you with a mix of psychology and twists left and right.

1385394,4,B000050IL8,Well what hasn't been said about this anime I cannot do justice. This is more so a quick recap of the events that transpired through the series - END of Eva is the 'final' part to the Eva series.

1385397,1,B000050IL8,"I really hate to do this since I really enjoyed the Evangelion series and recommend th series as a must watch for any anime fan. Evangelion Death and Rebirth is absolutely pointless. The first half is just recap for the series (which you should have already watched) and the second half is literally the first half hour of End of Evangelion (which I do recommend watching) To insult us even further, they add a 5 minute intermission for no reason. In short, please, don't waist your time with this movie. If you want to own Evangelion, purchase the Platinum Collection, and the End  of Evangelion movie. Then, if you want, go watch Eva 1.11 and 2.22. They are all much better.",1374796800,3,676,4.586776859504132
1385398,4,B000050IL8,"While the first half, Death, is a clip show of the all 24 episodes I did enjoy it because it brought me back to what the series was about. There are original scenes, in Death, of the characters Shinji, Rei, Kaworu, and Asuka in a high school auditorium practicing their music lessons. Those scenes, I guess, are supposed to be intros into each of the four characters clip show scenes.

The second half, Rebirth, is basically the first third of The End of Evangelion. So once it ended right away it made want to watch it.

In all I did enjoy it. I can see how many people will feel Death and Rebirth is redundant, if you are doing an Evangelion marathon. Prabably best to skip and go to The End of Evangelion. I would personally watch it just for the experience, and only if you are tolerant of clip shows in the first half. And I do recommand this because there is a commentary by Amanda Winn-Lee, her husband Jason C. Lee, and Taliesin Jaffe, which really entertaining.",1373587200,3,970,4.41340782122905

1385400,4,B000050IL8,"I purchased this because I bought the first two discs years ago but never finished buying the series, and this ended up being cheaper than buying them individually. I must say I have always loved this series, despite the many many complaints I have heard about the ending over the years. I won't say I loved that part, but I do appreciate the actual story. One thing that really stood out to me however is that despite being groundbreaking for it's time, the animation for the original series is, at least in places, a bit crude compared to more modern anime.

However, those unfamiliar with the original series should not let that be a deterrent in the slightest. While I personally think the series was a bit odd with the extreme contrasts in comedy and serious subject matter, it is still absolutely worth watching at least once. The overall story is pretty amazing, but it takes quite a while into the series for the true nature of things to really be apparent, and I think it is still rock-solid despite it's age.

For new viewers or repeat, this series was pretty amazing back in the day and still definitely worth a watch.

Apart from the product, I must say the seller was excellent. The discs were all in good condition and the outer cardboard sleeve just had a little bit of edgewear.",1372377600,,1294,4.568965517241379

1385411,5,B000050IL8,"Episode #15 is the start of the latter half of the Evangelion series. This episode is filled with soap drama elements such as ""reunited couple"" , 14-year-old boy and girl kiss for the first time. Some Eva fans love it or others hate it. I love this particular episode a lot even though lacking fighting action scenes. Reunited couple Ryoji and Misato try to find out the truth about the second impact and Eva project as a whole. While triple-agent Ryoji knows a lot about the secrets Misato is not aware of, he seems to know a bit better than Misato. One of the secrets Ryoji told to Misato is the students of the school Shinji, Asuka and Rei goes to actually are made up of candidates of Eva pilots. On episode #17 the fourth pilot was chosen from one of Shinji's friends. Latter half of Eva stories swing to grimmer direction and Angels often prey on Eva pilots' traumatic past experiences just as the characters of Star Gate SG-1 might have had as psychological tortures.

Verdict: The start of bitter latter half of the series.

1385412,5,B000050IL8,"The second volume(epi#5-8) of Neon Genesis Evangelion, Japanese animation series originally aired in 1995 focuses on two main heroines of the drama, Rei(ep. 5-6) and Asuka(ep. 8). And it unravels some of the answers to the mysteries about the setting of post-apocalyptic Japan where Metropolitan Tokyo areas have long been submerged, and Hakone areas function as new capital that is equipped with possible Angel's attack. Rei Ayanami as far as I have seen from episode 5 and 6 seems to be born warrior, so committed to Eva project, nothing else matters to her except for Shinji and his father Genzo Ikari. She is enigmatic as ever. Contrasting to Rei is Asuka Soryu Langley, 14-year-old German-Japanese girl who was chosen as the second child(first Rei, and Shinji is the third chosen one) who pilot Eva Unit Two, most advanced type of Eva machine according to Asuka. While Rei is introvert most of the time, Asuka is outspoken and a bit bratty sometimes. But Asuka's joining the drama is relieving for the viewers partly because Asuka is supposed to have the leading role in this drama. Will Evangelion follow the long-established formula similarly-styled dramas had? Well, let's find out about it in the rest of the series.

Verdict: Asuka and Eve Unit 02 finally join the drama.

1385413,5,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is a series that really means a lot of different things to a lot of people, and I think for this reason alone, you'll hear many go on in lengthy details about how excellent it is, while others will simply watch it and not be moved at all by it.  The show starts in a way that seems fairly straight forward in comparison to other anime titles that are ""giant robot-centric"", but maybe eight episodes in a dramatic shift starts to occur, which for me is when the series turns into something unique and interesting.  Basically the show starts to get much more cerebral, conspiracies and major plots are only hinted at, while parts are intentionally left out, to leave it to you as an audience member to interpret.  Toward the end, the show takes an even deeper turn down into philosophy in a way that even exceeds in my opinion what the Wachowski siblings did with ""The Matrix"".  Even then, the show still leaves several pieces that aren't entirely wrapped up, and you're left to your own conclusions about the show.

That being said, there are many that will not like the show because it leaves a lot open without a solid ending.  There are moments in the show where you watch and be amazed that some of this can be passed off as anime (for instance the ridiculously long elevator scene with Rei and Asuka where there is almost no movement), along with the later episodes flashing in and out with black backgrounds and white messages to read.  The show faced some financial problems and the director was also going through some difficult times, but in consideration of this, sometimes the best work one produces comes out of turmoil, you have to experience the blues to sing it.  There are points where the show may feel a bit pretentious, incomplete, or just not done right, but I believe these elements are what solidifies in my mind the place in this show being my favorite anime.

In considering whether or not to get this, I would really assess your interest in anime, this will not appeal to everyone - but if you enjoy anime that gets you thinking with a mix of some science fiction, I think you'll very much enjoy it.  My suggestion would be to strongly consider watching it subtitled though, as many are off-put by the English dub.  I have seen it through with both the dub and sub, and feel that the sub was a much better experience.

Pros:
* Great science fiction anime - action, giant robots, and a mix of philosophy and conspiracy theory
* This is the original North American release (if this matters to your or not)

Cons:
* Price - this particular bundle is expensive, it is the same version I have, but they have since re-released it in a platinum version for much cheaper!
* Transfer - The platinum version, besides being cheaper also had a better transfer and some touch ups to the video quality.
* Features - I believe the platinum version also had some additional features which are absent from this version (the only additional feature is previews)",1334188800,,2991,4.56822429906542

1385415,3,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion Collection 0:5 is a single DVD that contains episodes fifteen through seventeen of the series.  With the episodes on this disc, it seems that Neon Genesis Evangelion is finally hitting its stride.  By the time I finished the last episode, I wanted to see more to find out what happens next.  The audience is starting to learn that things aren't entirely what they seem, and we also learn that there is a new Eva and a new pilot has been chosen for the Eva.  The episodes on this disc also have some more character development for Shinji and Misato.  There was also a little more religious imagery and ideas brought up in these episodes.

When I first put this disc into the player, a trailer started.  For this disc, ADV only put on two-and-a-half minutes of trailers before the main menu instead of the nine to ten minutes of trailers included at the beginning of some of the previous discs.  Luckily, the disc was authored in such a way that you can skip ahead to the menu.

There are four extras on this disc.  The first is labeled as ""Character Bios""; the bios include a picture of the character and a brief text write-up.  The characters included in this feature are: Toji Suzuhara, Hikari Horaki, Twelfth Angel, and Nerv 02.  The next extra is ""ADV Website.""  All this selection does is to take you to a screen that has ADV's website featured on it; however, since ADV no longer exists, this link is rather irrelevant.  The third extra is the DVD credits.  The final extra is ""ADV Previews.""  With this disc, it was nice to see ADV return to having a menu to choose from, instead of automatically starting a long collection of trailers.  The previews included are for Shadow-Raiders, Generator Gawl, Spriggan, ReBoot, Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040, and Nadeisco.

This disc, like the previous three discs, only contained three episodes of the series.  However, I'm happy to see that the authoring of the disc is more like discs one, three, and four.  I was also glad to see a return to a menu for the ADV Previews.

If you're a fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion and haven't either already picked up this DVD release or one of the DVD box sets that were released for the series, this could be worth adding to your DVD library if you can find it for a reasonable price.

1385416,3,B000050IL8,"This DVD contains episodes five through eight of Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Episode five is still establishing the Neon Genesis Evangelion universe, and focuses on the character of Rei.  After this, though, the remaining three episodes started to put a little more emphasis on the action.  The final episode on this disc introduced a new Eva unit, along with its hot-tempered red-headed pilot, Asuka.

When I first put the disc in the player, a trailer started.  At first, this was no big deal.  However, as the previews kept coming, my husband took a look at the time on the counter and saw that these previews lasted for ten minutes.  Needless to say, my husband and I were not pleased, because ten minutes worth of trailers at the start of a DVD is obnoxious.  This felt almost as bad as the number of trailers that Disney puts at the beginning of their DVDs.

On the disc, you can select from four menu options; the options are ""Scene Access,"" ""Communications,"" ""Extras,"" and ""ADV Previews.""  For ""Scene Access,"" you can choose which episode you want to watch on the disc.  ""Communications"" is the option for subtitle and language selections.  For subtitles, you can choose to either have them on or off.  For language, you can choose from English, Spanish, French, and Japanese.

The ""Extras"" menu contains three options.  The first is labeled as ""Character Bios""; the bios include a picture of the character and a brief text write-up.  The characters included in this feature are: Asuka, Gendi Ikari, Ryoji, Eva Unit 02, Angel #5, and Angel #6.  The next feature is ""ADV Website""; all this selection does is to take you to a screen that has ADV's website featured on it.  However, since ADV no longer exists, this link is rather irrelevant.  The final extra in this menu is the DVD credits.  The final selection on the main menu is labeled as, ""ADV Previews.""  Unlike the previous disc, there is no menu to choose which previews to see.  Instead, it goes straight into the ten minutes of previews that are at the beginning of the disc.

There were a couple of issues with the DVD mastering that really bugged me.  First, the next episode previews on this disc were not put into their own chapter like the previous disc; instead, you had to fast forward through the ending credits in order to see them if you didn't want to watch the credits.  Also, it seemed that the text being used for the English subtitles on this disc were bigger than on the previous one.  Personally, I thought the larger subtitle text distracted me from the visuals more.

If you're a fan of Neon Genesis Evangelion and haven't either already picked up this DVD release or one of the DVD box sets that were released for the series, this could be worth adding to your DVD library if you can find it for a reasonable price.  Just beware of some of the mastering quirks on this particular release.

1385417,3,B000050IL8,"I am a huge fan of the Evangelion series, I currently own the entire series as well as the Rebuild Movies and the End of Evangelion movie. I bought this DVD with HUGE hesitation, but I'm glad I did because I feel I had to buy this if just to prove myself that I am actually a fan. This movie is generally a Re-Cap of the entire TV series jam packed into a 90 minute movie which makes up the DEATH segment of the film. The overall execution of trying to cram the entire series into a feature film is a very hard task so I have to give props to the team that did; they tried there best but in my personal opninion it was an impossible mission to do it successfully and satisfyingly. The DEATH portion takes place in a ""Music"" class where the main characters all individually enter and have their back story told. So there is a about probably 1 full minute all together of enirely new footage especially made for this film which is extremely dissapointing but not unexpected while this is just a re-cap. The REBIRTH portion of this film is the first 30 minutes of the ""End of Evangelion"" movie. The purpose of this is because during the creation of this film, the creators had a budget and a due date and weren't able to complete product in time. While i believe that they should stick to the original Japanese release, the REBIRTH section is VERY unnecessary because it is ONLY the first 30 minutes of the ""End of Evangelion"" film.

The only thing I find this DVD worth of any value is the Commentary included on this DVD. While the DVD lacks any real special featurs material, the commentary is actually worth checking out. I would actually give this DVD a 1 star but I actually found the Commentary to be very informative so I ultimately gave the DVD 3 stars. The commentary is provided by directors and screen writers of the English dubbed version of the film, and its nice to hear from people that are very closely associated with the Evangelion series. One person in particular provides the religious and mythological insight of the series while the others provide more information about the series and the characters. I will admit that they do mess around quite ofrten during their commentary so they do joke around from time to time but its still informative, and it does lighten up the mood to an already depressing series. I would suggest to everybody that you do not need this DVD in your collection unless you are a commited fan of the Evangelion series, if not however it is perfectly fine that you skip this DVD, it is not needed in your collection.

1385418,5,B000050IL8,"As a long time lover and collector of anime, I always try to get the best bang for my buck but also get the very best of the best even if it seems a little bit frivolous. This boxset is the perfect example of that.

Both movies ""The End of Evangelion"" and ""Death & Rebirth"" were released by MANGA entertainment (MANGA was able to swipe the rights from ADV for these)

This boxset includes Both movies, a mouse pad, and what looks like a small poster (Since my copy was used and under $60, I didn't receive the latter 2, so make sure if you want these you either buy it new OR ask the dealer selling used if the set they are selling has these included)

The 2 reasons I gave this set 5 stars are
1. It contains ""The End of Evangelion"" which is arguably the best anime film ever made
2. The box itself looks awesome, shiny, and is harder to find then both movies combined

My only gripes about both movies are that they were dubbed by MANGA and not ADV, While all of the main cast return, Toji Suzuhara,Fuyutsuki, Maya, and most notably Makoto Hyuga (Who goes from Matt Greenfield to essentially Shaquille o' Neal (Not really Shaq but thats the best way to describe it)these characters do not and it is an annoyance.

The main character is a pussy.  A big one.  He cries on a regular basis.

The fan service is shameless and childish. And I usually like fan service.

The religious references are crowded and unrealized. And yes I know my religion stories. He touches on certain aspects of major religions but never expands on his themes and leaves the viewer as confused as he is.

The characters are cookie cutter. The storyline starts off smart and then drags the audience through the dirt with filler episodes and plot lines that are picked up and then dropped as fast as they come.

And the worst part about this series is the fans. They get so up in arms about the multiple political and religious aspects of the series they don't realize that THEY DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE. Sorry to call a spade a spade, but Eva is not the series your thirteen year old minds thought it was.

The animation is awesome. Sorry it just is. It's the only saving grace this series has.

All in all, what a miserable series. Boring, philosophically inept, and (as an english speaker) flat dialogue. Watch Berserk or Bebop, or even Trigun for some inspiring direction. If you haven't seen this series yet don't waste your time.",1291507200,6,1447,4.552123552123552

1385421,3,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is by far one of the most stand out animes out there. It's legendary for a reason. Concealed behind the exterior of giant robots, hot women, world peril, and explosions is a deep thinking, emotional story, but not a story for everyone. If you want an anime that's 'straight to the point' don't pick this one, later on it becomes an immensely psychological babble, yet one I thouroughly enjoy.
 The pakaging is all I have to complain about. The box itself isn't bad, black with the grey mask of adam, a metallic red Nerv logo on the side, grey unit 01 with metallic red eyes on the back, but for a one season anime they strech it out into eight DVD's (only three episodes a piece) which makes it big and bulky to store. These episodes are not uncut, so those of you who want to see the extra eye-candy will be dissapointed. There are very few extra's on these DVDs as well (only character bio's), and they are rather difficult to get out of the case due to the lack of a good button in the middle to 'pop' them out. Also the cover art on the DVD's is rather dissapointing; no beautiful pieces by Sadamoto here.

1385429,1,B000050IL8,"This review is for both the series and two movies.

This overall is the worst anime series I've seen, and I've seen a lot of them.  There are many things wrong with the series and movies.

First is the story.  It begins in the year 2000 when a disaster nearly destroys Antarctica and kills billions of people.  It's first thought to be a natural disaster, but was actually a experiment sponsored by a organization called SEELE and carried out by GEHIRN.  Fast forward to the year 2010 GEHIRN has changed into NERV a military organization.  NERV's primary mission is to locate creatures called Angles and destroy them.  The primary story follows Shinji Ikari who decides to join NERV and his father is the head of NERV.

Now onto all the problems with this show.

First is the story:  I'm not sure what the creators of this series/movies were trying to do, but they failed miserably.  The story as it went on from episode to episode and movie to movie just got worse and worse as it went a long.  The story was incoherent and didn't make any sense.  I don't mind series that try to have a hight meaning, but at least make some kind of sense at the end, express something even if it's that everyone dies.

Second the characters:  I think this might have been my biggest problem with the series.  The characters brought nothing to the series.  The main character Shinji has to be one of the worst if not the worst anime character ever.  He had no depth, emotion, and didn't try me in.  He was just annyoing, and I wanted him to die almost from the beginning, the same with most of the other ones.  I can't think of on character I actually liked.

Third the animation:  The animation done by GAINAX is terrible it looks like something done by in the 60s or 70s.  Hell I think Speed Racer looks better than this series.

Overall this is the worst anime series ever and most overrated series I've seen.  I really don't understand why people like it.  If they want to see a great anime series with meaning then you should check out series like Saikano, RahXephon, and Now and Then, Here and There just for example.

1385431,5,B000050IL8,"This third DVD in the Platinum Collection marks the halfway point in the original 26-episode series; as well as being the point from which it inexorably veers away from its apparent inception as ""just another"" Giant Robot Show with an inevetable monster-of-the-week format.  The recap episode 14, Weaving a Story, both brings to an end the first half of the series, while effectively foreshadowing what will come in the second half.  The trio of Eva pilots each experience additional character development in these four episodes: Askua, though still brash and demanding attention, tones down a little and learns better to perform as a member of a team; Rei emerges a bit from her shell, showing good sense and a touch of decisiveness while nonetheless questioning her real purpose; and Shinji comes as close as he ever will to finding the approval which is really what drives him on.

But it is probably the characters supporting the pilots who recieve the best expansion here:  Misato's background is particularly revealing, both about herself as well as what motovates her ( wrongly, it turns out ) to seek vengence on the Angels; Ritsuko becomes important to the story for the first time as the genius technician behind the MAGI super-computers so necessary to NERV operations; and we see a bit more of the past between Misato and Kaji while the two are unavoidably stuck on an elevator during a major power failure.  The three will be a trio to watch in the future, as their entwined story continues to unfold.

But who knew?  I paid for it and didn't get the money's worth, so at the moment I still have to warn potential viewers.  Without knowing how the work is meant to be appreciated, I must say the story is totally incomprehensible.  I picked the DVD up solely based on the reputation and curiosity, when I had time to finally watch it.  Only after reading Wikipedia, I learned how to appreciate this movie.

I only wish that point is made very clear on the DVD package!!

I hope to come back to this DVD, once I have chance to watch the original TV series hopefully in Japanese; that really seems to be the only way to enjoy this one.

If the entire series had worked this way, it would be a 5 star series, but it starts off slow and takes a while to get where it's going.

The final two episodes are fine - weird, but nothing incomprehensible - but I felt I would have gotten the point anyway if it was all condensed into one episode.  The ending was a let down, and I understand that the movies complete it, but the movies were not included with this set, so as a series it is incomplete.

Because NGE was a catalyst for the emergence of anime out of pop fun and into visual art, it is an important set for anime buffs to watch.  Much like Citizen Cane may not be the most exciting film for film buffs to watch, it is significant because of what it contributed to the film industry and film as art.  NGE could be considered the Citizen Cane of Japanese Animation.",1212451200,,977,4.248648648648649
1385435,4,B000050IL8,"One theme among the low-scoring reviewers (apart from bad spelling) is that you can see a lot of this material elsewhere. That seems like an odd premise to base a low score on.

But another theme (its incomprehensibility) I agree with. I feel that there are serious and inexcusable problems with much of the opening of this movie. Anyone who hasn't seen the TV series is going to have a tough time following it and that's a real shame and a waste of media. Most of the movie is short bits of the TV series cut up and pasted together in apparently random order with slightly different dialog and unhelpful captions. Imagine trying to watch any digest of a large body of work under those conditions. However, even for that fault, it is incredibly entertaining. And then there's the Rebirth section which is just excellent.

So, this piece of art is probably not worth 4 stars but the point of personal reviews is to express one's opinion. For me, this deeply flawed splinter of genius is 4 stars' worth of goodness. And I never once said 'your' when I meant 'you're'. How many stars do I get for that?

And by the way if you like this movie and you haven't seen the TV series then try and erase your memory of this and go watch the TV series (with the original episodes or the director's cuts, it doesn't make much difference). It's put together in a very sane way. The Platinum box set is a good bet.",1208995200,,1399,4.4147286821705425
1385436,1,B000050IL8,"If you are a fan of the Evangelion series, do NOT waste your money on this movie.  It's incomplete and was rushed to release.

Death and Rebirth is, as the title indicates, split into two parts.  The first part, Death, is simply an accelerated recap of the TV Series Neon Genesis Evangelion.  It's about as informative as a powerpoint presentation and aside from a few small extended scenes that aren't seen in the regular series, watching the whole thing is a practice in resisting the lure of the fast-forward button especially if you have seen the series in its entirety.

The second half of the movie, called Rebirth, is much more interesting and shows an alternative sequence of events that replace the last two episodes of the television series (which are pretty universally hated).  It's new material but it is incomplete and ends abruptly without any resolution leaving the viewer wondering what they did to deserve getting ripped off so magnificently.

The movie The End of Evangelion is Rebirth in all it's glory.  Completed and with a very high production value.  So if you are interested in Evangelion, skip this feature length teaser and just buy End of Evangelion.  You'll save some money, and avoid considerable frustration.

1385439,1,B000050IL8,"When people say ""skip this and go straight to End of Evangelion"", they actually mean it.

I love Evangelion but this movie is a waste of time and money. I bought it at HMV in the summer and bought it because I owned the series on DVD and TEoE.

I was excited and I nearly shat myself because it said ""107 Minutes"", and I thought it was a movie, and it had an 18A rating (I'm from Canada, mind you). I bought it and rushed home with the DVD, taking it out of the silver slipcase and frantically taking it out of the package and putting it in the DVD player.

What a waste of time!!!!! This is basically The series recapped in 45 minutes, followed by the first 20 minutes of TEoE. The minute I saw the opening scene from TEoE, I went ""wait... are you sure I bought the right movie?"". 20 minutes into that part, I just turned it off.

Either way I find this negativity sad, because I really did like the series. I really did. I also saw The End of Evangelion and loved it to death, and I think if I had seen The End of Evangelion before this I would have liked it more, however that does NOT change a thing.

I dunno about you, but right now I'm halfway into REALLY getting sick of the whole story. I mean, The creepy ""Angels"", the forgettable protagonist, the girl he's after and all that other stuff... aren't they beginning to get a little... erm... boring ? I mean, really, the only original part of the movie is in the ""Rebirth"" section, which can easily be found in TEoE.

This is a waste of time and money, and the only reason to see is is for the ""Director's Cut"" stuff (But not like there's a whole lot, there's only 2 seconds of it in total).

So this is basically my first Spoiler-free review, because really there's nothing at all to spoil. NO, this will NOT help if you haven't seen the show, and NO, the 45-minute flashback (snarl) will not help, either.

Anime typically does not win me over, but this is one of the good ones that I could watch again and again. I ran out to buy this movie, eager to see more, I was so impressed with the series. I spent money I couldn't afford to spend. That said, this movie is the Antichrist of the series. Before I even get to why it was bad, you should know that Death & Rebirth, unless my disc was broken, is no more than a recap of the series. You're essentially buying what you already own.

The first scene in this movie is absolutely symbolic of what the entire movie is. Asuka, laying in a coma, is completely helpless as Shinji masturbates on her. Shinji reprents Hideaki Anno, the director who is ejaculating on you, the helpless viewing audience. Take this imagery in mind as you watch the next two hours; it's essentially an abstract representation of the rape you experience in the first five minutes. Everything you love about the series is systematically bastardized and/or destroyed. I've read that Anno did not make this snuff film of an anime as revenge; I cannot imagine that being true. I want to believe that it simply came from simple rage and is not actually considered by him to be an actual work of art. It is brutally cold in its efficiency. I would urge anyone who reads this and enjoyed the series, or just saw portions of it, or values their own sanity to not open this Pandora's Box, because it is filled with more human agony than the namesake.",1183593600,4,1538,4.473309608540926
1385442,5,B000050IL8,"*OVERVIEW and EPISODE REVIEWS:

Neon Genesis Evangelion (NGE) starts out simple enough. A story about a boy named Shinji Ikari coming to a futuristic city and using giant robot-like Evas (Unit-01 himself) to fend off the invading enemies called Angels. Along the way he meets a mysterious girl and pilot of Unit-00, Rei Ayanami, the fiery pilot of Unit-02 Asuka Langley Soryu, Director of Nerv Operations Misato Katsuragi, the brilliant scientist, Ritsuko Akagi and his estranged father and Nerv's Commander, Gendo Ikari. There's also an intriguing cast of minor characters including friends from his school, Toji and Kensuke and Nerv's Vice Commander Fuyutsuki. But it ends in a completely different place than where it began, with so much filling its creamy center that it's hard to know what to cover in a review.

Yes, it indeed starts out simple enough: Through the first 8 episodes you probably couldn't distinguish NGE from any other giant robot anime ever made. These episodes, while entertaining, are as straight forward as anime gets. Then, slowly but surely from episodes 9-13, the characters are given to more detailing. We get to know them better as more of their stories and histories are revealed. A beautiful example of this is in episode 9 when Asuka falls down, asleep, next to Shinji, who is then tempted to kiss her before something makes him stop. The story is expanded upon as more secrets are revealed, which leads to more questions.

But then, during episode 14, which starts out as a boring ""recap"", half way through we get the first glimpse of what this series is really about. After the title card we hear the voice of Rei, giving a surreal and beautiful monologue with similar images following on the screen. This bit is practically visual/audio poetry working together, and gives the first hints of what's to come. The psychological and philosophical leanings of this episode would start to become more prominent throughout the series.

Episode 15 is really where the gears shift. The story has slowly built our interest in the characters and the many secrets up to this point, with as much humor and light heartedness as seriousness. In 15 though things takes a more mature, complex, and somber turn - with the end being the catalyst for the brilliant episodes to come. Indeed, episodes 16 and 18 are two of the most dramatic works of fiction I've ever experienced, with 17 being the calm interlude between them.

But then 19 comes along and trumps them all. If I could describe the chills I had when watching that episode for the first time... simply put, I don't think dramatic storytelling gets any better. Episode 20 is one of the deepest and complex, further diving into the psychology and symbolism behind the show. 21's back stories are woven so intricately you forget that you're watching an anime as the breadth given to the characters are incredible. 21's finale also serves as one of the most emotional in the series.

22 is one of the most disturbing episodes, diving into the psychology of Asuka this time in a way that will leave you feeling a bit shocked. 23 does what 22 did for Asuka and applies it to Rei. It also has the biggest, most stunning revelation in the series at the end of the episode, as one of Nerv's big secrets is revealed. These episodes also bring much of the ""bigger"" picture between Nerv, Seele, and the secrets behind the Angels and 2nd Impact into focus, which leads to the climax. That climax hits with episode 24, with the introduction of the last angel Kaworu. While one of the most perplexing episodes (due to its cryptic plot and dialogue), its magnificent finale - played out appropriately to Beethoven's final movement of his monumental 9th Symphony - serves as an outstanding closure to the main series before the final two episodes.

The final two episodes completely forego the story that's been building up, and focuses instead on the psychology and philosophy behind the show and its characters. These two episodes are brilliant in their own right. Episode 26 in particular, with its deconstructing of the meanings of reality and freedom, and examining of so many psychological hot points in the show (one's self worth, for instance) is an artistic high point in anime. They are not completely un-story related though, as the ""melding of minds"" in these episodes are a major plot element. But this works out great for the director Hideaki Anno who probably loved being able to get many of these feelings out through this series and these two episodes in particular.

For those wanting a closure to the story of NGE, ""The End of Evangelion"" is the grand finale to end all grand finales. While it won't answer everything in a nice, neat way (this is not a show that hands you answers on a silver platter), it provides an astonishingly powerful and poignant conclusion to the story and to the NGE series. I can understand the frustration of fans after watching the series and then the final two ""series"" episodes, thinking this was the end. In reality, the movie was MEANT to be the conclusion, but because of budget and time problems it couldn't be completed in time. The ""series"" finale will still stand on their own as the alternate take, but they're an essential alternate take as this is an anime whose meanings stretch far beyond the mecha-sci-fi, boy-saves-world genre. But the film sets a new standard in the art of closing a series on the perfect note.

*SERIES REVIEW

While the layers of psychology, philosophy, and symbolism would crush most shows under their own weight and seeming pretentiousness, Anno handles them with adeptness and acute direction. He skillfully weaves them into the story to the point where everything makes complete sense in relation to the characters and storyline. In fact, if you really take time to analyze the story, the characters, and the relationship between the dialogue and visuals with the psychological, philosophical, and symbolic meanings, you'll see this series does indeed have more depth than almost all others that have attempted to tackle similar subjects. In fact, this is a series which almost has to be viewed several times, as there are recurring motifs (both visually and in the dialogue) which link important thematic elements strung throughout. And if you're not watching carefully, you'll miss them the first and maybe even second time around.

I think the reason these ideas become so important is very simple, and that's because of the characters. Anno doesn't just create a random bunch of soulless, mindless, anime characters. He creates characters that everyone can relate to on some level. Because these characters have such range and depth, we begin to really care about them and their struggles. In the end their struggles become our own and they literally become mirrors of our own psychological profiles and problems. We begin to grieve as we watch them deal with such (self) destructive behavior caused by their circumstances and consequential frames of mind. It's because of this that the viewer actually cares about the more portentous moments, no matter how grandiose they become. I think it's very important for those out there to understand that all the elaborate complexities of NGE wouldn't matter without the characters that carry the weight and meaning of it all.

NGE is a show of extremes. Ranging from scenes of palpable, viseral power that inspire shock and awe, to the most quietly surene, surreal, and beautifully touching moments. These scenes are woven together as fine and eloquently as the Beethoven Symphony they play in episode 24 itself. And like that symphony, even though the parts are outstanding, the whole is much greater than the sum.

I believe this is a work of resounding artistic depth. I'd go as far as to say it's one of the absolute greatest pieces of fiction ever made in any medium. This may sound like hyperbole, but there have been few - if any - fictional works that have effected me both emotionally and psychologically like NGE has. If you put in the time and effort to actively watch this series, it will reward as many repeat viewings as you care to give it, as new layers and meanings will be uncovered each time. And I think that is, if nothing else, the first sign of a work of artistic genius.

*DVD REVIEW:

The Platinum Edition is far and away better than the Perfect Collection. The remastered visuals and audio are extraordinary. It doesn't get better than watching the big explosions in 5.1 Surround Sound! The remastered visuals are equally as striking. The reduced frame shake and jitter is a phenomenal improvement from the previous edition. It seems like they almost went back and re-animated parts of the show, making almost every scene look more vivid, life-like and alive. The Subtitled translations is another thing worth noting, as these translations are, by and large, more accurate. Even though I now hate the English translation of the song doesn't match the melody (always found it funny why it did on the Perfect Collection), this is a more accurate translation. The packaging is the only disappointment. The box is nothing special, the DVD cases themselves contain no booklets or notes, and there's no extras on the DVDs. But you get what you pay for as the price is a bargain. If you want all the other stuff you have to buy the Platinum Collection 1+Box and the rest of the collection separately.",1182729600,5,9418,4.873828856964397
1385443,3,B000050IL8,"[NOTE: every thing said here refers to the dub version and not the sub, as i have only seen the dub version].

I almost bought this set, but when I saw the entire series at my local rental store I decided to rent it first and see if it's any good. It took me about two weeks to get though the whole thing because I rented them 1 at a time, but I have finally come to the end. I just have to say right now that those that say this are the best anime ever have got to be smoking something. Best ever? No way, not ever. Doesn't even come close. This series can be VERY good at times, so good in fact that it rivals any anime I've ever seen. But at other times it's just a silly mech series. We are introduced in volume one to Sinji, probably the wimpiest character you will EVER see in ANY movie, series, book, whatever. I found myself absolutely hating him because he wasn't able to put aside his hatred for his creepy dad in order to save humanity. I mean really, he is the only one who can save the world and he's whining about his dad. What the hell?
And it's not just him I end up hating. Captain Katsoagi (sp), who is Sinji's guardian, is nothing but a drunken whore the entire first half the show, and is a sober whore for the second half. That's when she's off work, when she's at work however she's a no nonsense commander who yells a lot. And since when is it okay for military personnel to look like sluts in their military uniform? Gahh, shoot me.

Okay, I'll try now to make sense of this series.

---The Good---
Pretty much everything good that happens in this series happens in volumes 2, 6, and 7. Volume 2 is okay, not great, but okay. But volumes 6 and 7 are amazing. They are so full of drama and emotion that I was literally left in shock. They were GREAT, and this coming from a guy who was starting to hate the series before this point. These volumes are pretty much long in-depth background histories on some of the main characters, and they are great. Especially the one for Auska. before seeing her past I just thought of her as a whiny little brat who hated everyone, but afterwards I thought she was a whiny little brat who hated everyone, but with a good reason. I finally had a character who I could sympathize with. Her depression at the end of the series was so well done that I started shaking. Wow, what a story, what a powerful scene. Too bad none of the other characters were any good.
I tried to sympathize with Rei earlier but she never opened up, never changed, never really did anything at all. She reminded me a lot of Lala Ru from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Now-and-Then-Here-and-There-Complete-Collector-s-Boxed-Set/dp/B000063K2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Now and Then, Here and There (Complete Collector's Boxed Set)</a>&nbsp;but Lala Ru was ten times more interesting than Rei.

One more thing though, nobody told me this series was so darn funny. I mean really, some parts were so funny I busted out laughing and rolling on the floor. A lost is perverted hummer, but it's still funny.
Here's an example. Sinji, Auska and Katsoagi go over to a hot spring after a long mech battle to relax. Sinji is separated from the girls by a large wooden wall. When Auska asks him for some soap or something he throws it over and hits her in the face. Then Katsoagi comes over to Auska (we can only hear them) and then we hear this.
""Here, let me see that""
""No, don't' touch me there, ha-ha""
""Oh, come here you...""
""Ha, no, don't put anything in there. Ha-ha""
""No wait, let me show you something""
The whole time Sinji is hearing all of this. Either you find this funny or you don't, but I found it hilarious.

---The Bad---
Characters. Oh God, where to begin. As I've said before, almost all the characters are either whinny little pieces of (need to keep it G rated, sorry), stupid fools, drunken whores, or insane nuts. All of them fall into one of these categories. It's insane; did the directors of this show WANT us to hate these people? If so than they succeeded.

Repetition. The entire first half of this series is just one cheesy mech battle after another and they always follow the same formula. People going though crises of varies degrees, idiotic looking angle with unbeatable power shows up, angle beats initial defense, people yell, everything breaks down at exactly the wrong time. More yelling. Then everyone takes a 2 hour coffee break as the angle just sits around and the humans come up with an impossible plan that ALWAYS has a 0.002% chance of working. Of course they execute the plan flawlessly and kill the angle, only for the same exact thing to happen the nest episode. I just have to ask, why doesn't anything ever work? Every time an angle shows up the EVA's break down and nothing on them seem to work. This gets old after, oh say, the SIXTH TIME!!!!!!

Ending. Yes, I know, EVERYONE hates the ending. Well so did I. the last three episodes are so bad I almost fell asleep. It wasn't QUITE as bad as I was expecting, but it was still terrible. But there was a really funny sequence in the last episode were we get to see all out main characters in different roles. Sinji has all the self confidence he could ever want, Auska is his childhood friend, Rei is a fun loving loud mouth who doesn't like people looking at her skirt, and Katsoagi is a hot school teacher. Other than these REALLY funny 5 minutes though, the ending sucked.

Unanswered Questions. There are too many questions that are never answered here, like WHY THE HECK WERE THEY FIGHTING ANGLES IN THE FIRST PLACE? What were the angles? Why did they only come to Japan? What exactly was second impact? What was that spear thing? How did a drunken whore get be commander of the most important weapons on earth? I would have settled with knowing why the angles wanted to wipe out mankind, but I didn't even get that.

Naked People Everywhere. Yes, this is a classic example of adult only anime. There are so many shots of naked people its embarrassing. Do these people have any sense of modesty? Their all a bunch of sex freaks who don't own any cloths. Yuck.

Soundtrack. its the same song every time an angle shows up, the same song every time something sad happens, and that's about it. the opening song, although a little annoying at first, does kind of grow on you after a few listens, but the ending song, as is normal in anime series, is less than noteworthy.

i really wanted to like this series but I just couldn't do it.

1385445,5,B000050IL8,The two part movies Death and Rebirth and End of Evangelion sum up the television series well. Not visually and intellectually disappointing.

The End of Evangelion is the ending the series, in many ways, needed to have: while the original ending was adequate, Evangelion was never just a story about Shinji and, with all the talk about Adam and Third Impact, it needed something bigger than complete introspection.  That said, both this ""film"" ending and the one occuring in the series do compliment each other and aren't entirely at odds.  The difference between Third Impact and Human Instrumentality isn't quite so clear...as maybe it shouldn't be.  Nonetheless, we get both.  Oh, and Asuka gets a finale worthy of her character.  I rate End of Evangelion a 5 star flick;  Death & Rebirth, basically the entire series edited into an hour with the idea that Asuka, Shinji, and Rei are ""performing/dreaming"" this collectively, is beside the point.

1385447,1,B000050IL8,"How so many people give this anime series anything beyond 1 star is mind bottling.  yes, i said mind bottling as opposed to mind boggling which it is that too.  i have so much frustration and pent up anger with this freakishly over-hyped series that when I hear of anyone who liked it let alone loved it, my mind feels like its trapped in a bottle because there is so much emotion that wants to break out and punch the individual in the gonads.  Be that as it may, I consider myself an anime nerd and to prove my worth, the following are some of my favorite anime series in no particular order...

1) Cowboy Bebop

2) Trigun

3) Rurouni Kenshin

4) Ghost in the Shell S.A.C.

5) Gundam Wing + SEED

6) Outlaw Star

7) Full Metal Panic (especially Fumoffu and T.S.R.)

As you can see, some on the list consist of mecha type anime which NGE could be considered as.  So I am not foreign to this genre but the crap that came out of NGE becoming a cult classic is beyond my understanding when there were better animes even at that time like Gundam Wing or the Macross Plus OVAs.  Here's the review breakdown...

Story/plot:  Horrible and purposely filled with plot holes by the director/creator.  But before I go on any further, I must note that I am a Judeo-Christian, why?  Because the story attempts to put a twist in the old Adam and Eve biblical story and of the end times.  And let me say, as a Christian, I felt offended by the undertone of the storylines ending.  The message the drunken creator portrays is very un-Christian like, but I'll let you decide that one IF you decide to embark on this hellish ride.  Anyway, moving on, like others have mentioned before, the story *seemingly* develops until you reach what I can only describe as an incoherent psychadelic cesspool of flabbergast starting in episode 24 and onward.  I have no desire to see the movie which I've read is supposed to fill in the gaps for the ending so no comment on that one.  The story is basically about the end of the world and the godzilla-esque angels who bring it about and the human struggle to survive by fighting them with organic mechs.  where, why or how these angels come about is a mystery, just another plot hole amongst many others.  Assistant Director Kazuya Tsurumaki said of the series, ""If a person who can already live and communicate normally watches it, they won't learn anything.""  I take that to mean, ""only retarded individuals will get something out of watching this.""  Hey, he said it not me.

Characters:  There are plenty, none of which you can relate to (at least I hope not) cuz they're all crazy granted the main characters are 14 year olds but my goodness, I would not wish any kid to be anything like any one of those characters.  Even so, the adults are crazy too.  But the thing that gritted my teeth throughout the series was the lack of character development.  I hated Shinji's character in the beginning and I hated him in the end.  He's the main character but there's nothing to like about him.  He's a whinny, cowardly, cry baby and he stays that way all the way to the end.  Rei is emotionless but ironically undergoes the most development but her character is riddled with plot holes and is boring anyway to care.  Asuka is an annoying loud mouth who likes to show-off her sub-par abilities but suffers from an inferiority complex since she is apparently not as good as either Shinji or Rei in the Evas (mechs).  Which reminds me, the story likes to blurt out snych ratios throughout the series refering to the characters connection with their evas that always seem to be in the 0.00XXX range and they always say it as ""zero point zero zero blah blah blah and this connection is at zero point zero zero blah blah blah"" and so on... it gets annoying real fast.

Animation: This is really the only redeeming factor in NGE.  The animation is great and probably the best anime had to offer for a TV series of that time making it unprecedented.  This is the only reason why I gave it a 1 star rating.  I would have given it a half star but amazon doesn't work that way.

So folks, it is this reviewers angry opinion that you will not only waste, but gain a negative experience by watching this series.  If by chance you happen to like the series, then im sure you hate my guts but if I saved many people from wasting away by watching this series, then i've done them a service.",1175990400,12,4393,4.433208489388265

1385450,5,B000050IL8,"For those turning to this film to answer all the questions that the last two episodes of the Evangelion (NGE) series didn't answer, I suggest you look elsewhere. If anything, this film will provide you with precious few answers but a multitude of new questions. For those wanting a highly provocative, thought-provoking, intelligent and most poignant conclusion to the NGE series, then have no fear. I will try to explain some of the more perplexing elements in this film, without giving too much away, as well giving my thoughts and opinions at the same time.

The film is structured to be the final two episodes of the series. So the first half, Ep. 25 ""Air/Love is Destructive"" is concurrent with the series episode 25 ""The World Ending/Do You Love Me?"". The second half, Ep. 26. ""My Purest Heart for You/One More Final: I Need You"" is concurrent with the series episode 26 ""The Beast that Shouted Love at the Heart of the World/Take Care of Yourself.""

Much like the NGE series, the End of Evangelion (EoE) weaves a complex story where images and dialogue are closely related to the philosophy and symbolism. These themes are played out through the psychology of each characters' own mind. It is essentially a microcosm of the entire series. The opening scenes before the ""Air"" title card of Ep. 25 of Shinji overlooking the ruins of the city, and then entering Asuka's hospital room and, (I'll leave it there) set the mood and atmosphere. Showing effectively and very disturbingly that this is NOT going to be an easy film. As the first half roars out of the gates at breakneck speed, we see the hostile takeover of Nerv by the Seele organization and each Nerv member's desperate attempt to hold it at bay.

We also see the mental states that the two main Eva pilots - Shinji and Asuka - have been reduced too. Shinji is severely depressed after killing the last angel, Kaworu, whom he had formed a close bond with. Asuka is in the same mental boat as Shinji as she sits at the bottom of the lake in her Eva, which she feels she can't pilot anymore. What's interesting is the paths that have driven these two characters to this point. The ideas of finding one's self-worth (examined perfectly in the final two series episodes), and what happens to a person when that is taken away.

At the same time Seele is trying to initiate their plans for Third Impact using Unit-01 and the downright creepy looking Mass-Produced Eva Series, Gendo has his own plans involving Rei and Lilith. As Asuka, (with a little help and inspiration from her Mama) rages an extremely violent battle with the Evil Evas, Gendo takes Rei down to Lilith. He does this to unite the souls and bodies of Adam and Lilith only to find his scorned lover, Ritsuko there. It's interesting that two of the most shocking and violent scenes (the Asuka/Eva battle and the Gendo/Ritsuko confrontation) are played out to Bach's beautiful ""Air"". The infusion of the music in this film is truly brilliant and a major reason why many scenes are so effective.

However, this is the point in the film where most people will start to become completely lost. Without a really good understanding of the NGE story (and perhaps even with one), it's hard not to. It's very difficult to make the extremely complex simple, however I'll try without many spoilers.

Suffice it to say that Seele were trying to initiate Third Impact and reduce humankind back to its original form - the Primordial Soup of Life where all souls and beings are one. Gendo had different plans and just wanted to see his 'dead' wife, Yui again. Neither Seele's or Gendo's plans go exactly as they were meant to. Unit-01, along with Shinji, ends up becoming the Tree of Life, and the ark in which all souls are ushered through and into Lilith's Egg. Understanding the idea that in NGE, humans - Lilim, as we're called - were born from Lilith, and Rei is essentially Lilith helps make this clearer. What's happening near this point is 3rd Impact is occurring because of the Unit-01 and the Mass Produced Eva encounter. This returns the Geo-Front (the sphere like cavern where Nerv HQ sits) to its original form, the Egg of Lilith (we see this during the ""Eye""-like explosion). After the Giant Rei/Lilith forms, Shinji is essentially given reign over the future of the human race by Rei/Lilith herself.

At this point, the tempo of the film slows to a crawl and the most surreal images and scenes begin creeping in. Even the most seemingly simple scenes such as a young Shinji playing in a sandbox with a swing, mountains, and a setting sun in the background is just rife with symbolism (hint: try to relate everything in this scene with something in the show, be it scenes, characters, or themes). Here, the psychological interplay between the main characters is crucial, as Shinji's wishes are played out in the real world. When he feels that everyone has deserted him and essentially says 'everyone can just die' is when the Instrumentality and joining of all souls through Lilith really begins.

What's important to note is Shinji's thoughts after his 'choice' has been made. The place he escapes to - the world of Instrumentality where all souls are one - and his questioning of this choice and all his choices is what we see here. More than just his questioning of the choice, we also hear him questioning the meaning of reality and dreams. This is not just random philosophical ramblings. It's a study of a character's, as well as the creator's, thoughts and feelings. Shinji holds all of humanity's future in his hands or, more accurately, his own mind. When you consider how psychologically scarred Shinji is, the idea that he can completely shape the future of Earth and all of humankind is what makes this so interesting.

Once he is allowed to be in the world he escapes to, he's faced with another choice of whether to stay or come back. As he discusses these things with Rei and Kaworu (Lilith and Adam), we hear his final choice and reasons why. The ending of EoE, titled ""One More Final: I Need You"" is rightfully confusing to almost everyone who sees it. However, it's also the perfect note to end the series with. Not only does it leave us as uncertain as the characters are about the future, but it also expresses the frustration and realization of Shinji's choice and the culmination of all the struggles that has lead them there.

This film is simply a divine marvel. Much like the series it has to be watched multiple times for one to uncover all of its hidden layers and meanings. But it doesn't lose its ability to invoke emotions and thoughts even after several viewings. There are scenes of immense power and drama in the film - many that match the best of most films I've seen. But I think it's the quiet moments that make this film so moving and memorable. The Sandbox scene is one I've mentioned. Another is the live action shots with the monologue and Bach's magnificent ""Jesus Bleibet Meine Freude"" (Jesus, Joy of Man's Desiring) playing along on piano with it. Even more subtle moments, such as Shinji's SDAT (walkman type) player out of batteries (more significant than many would think), and Gendo's broken glasses in Rei's place. With the vivid beginning of Instrumentality played out to the appropriate sad-song-with-a-pop-beat ""Komm Susser Tod"" (Come Sweet Death), it's these scenes that never fail to give me chills.

There's a great quote that goes something like ""A truly wise man always has more questions than answers."" This is a series and film that asks more questions than it provides answers. What it tries to do is make you think about those questions, rather than provide an easily digestible story. Some may call the story incoherent and disjointed, but what many don't realize is that the deep psychological and philosophical leanings behind the show are inextricably linked with the storyline itself. So to distinguish one from the other is impossible without realizing how the two intertwine and effect the other. If you merely try to breakdown the sci-fi storyline, then you will be confused by much of it. This is because the story is so big and so encompassing that many finer details can't be uncovered without diving deep into the inner workings of the series.

In the end, I can only speak for myself when I say NGE did a superlative job of doing everything a great work of art should do. It made me laugh, it made me cry, it gave me chills on more than one occasion.... but most of all it made me THINK. Anyone who wants to enjoy this show as just a meaningless work of science fiction can do so, but will be baffled as they're crushed by the multiple layers of extra contextual meanings. So, if you want to understand NGE, you have to not only pay close attention to the small details within the show (small scenes from many episodes back play a role in the film), you have to really open your mind up to the ideas being presented, and how they effect the story.

However, taken as a film, and the conclusion to the NGE series, End of Evangelion is a staggering achievement and powerful last testament to what is, in my opinion, the greatest visual series of all time.

*DVD NOTES:

Those considering whether to buy just the EoE or the EoE/Death & Rebirth 2-pack, I suggest you go with the EoE unless you don't own the director's cuts of the last several episodes (available in the Platinum Collection). 'Death' is mostly a muddled re-crap of the entire series, while 'Rebirth' is merely the first 30 minutes of EoE. Death also doesn't contain remastered visuals or audio like the Platinum Collection does, so you'll be getting a low quality re-cap at that. Death really doesn't even work as an introduction to NGE, because most everyone not aquainted with previous episodes would be confused by the structure of the recap. The only thing worthwile in 'Death' is something called ""The Magi Archives"" which provides great information about key people, places, events, and thing in the series. This is very helpful to those who feel completely lost by all the jargon in the series and will help clear some things up, even if it won't answer any of the bigger questions. So just stick with EoE unless you feel the need for completeness to get Death & Rebirth as well.",1172793600,44,10246,4.690767519466074
1385451,5,B000050IL8,"""...I think that this is the great untold story to the world. It is sublime. It is arguably some of the most beautiful and poignant animation ever created...""

- Richard Taylor, Weta Workshop.

There is not much that I could mention here which has not been said many times before, but the TV series and movies combined are among the best on offer in any genre.  A masterpiece, albeit flawed.

Hauntingly beautiful, disturbing, thought-provoking and terrifying, all at the same time.  Definitely not for younger viewers.

That being said, I am sad to report that the English release of the films ""Death and Rebirth"" and ""The End of Evangelion"" were so poorly done that I do not believe there is yet a definitive English translation to be had (unless you count the original ""fan subs"" by Bochan Bird).

It is clear listening to the commentaries that these films were not taken at all seriously or treated with the respect they deserved.  The English director admits to adding campy sound-effects and alternative (incorrect) ""humorous"" dialog for her ""own personal amusement"".  Parts of the translation sound as if they were made by an immature teenager with a childish sense of humour rather than a professional translator.  One might suspect that an attempt was made to turn this mature art-piece into a more stereotypical cartoon aimed at a younger and less discriminating audience.

The commentary offers little in the way of real insight, having very little to say about the underlying philosophies or symbolism.  Ignorance abounds, and catch phrases such as ""that's Freudian"" substitute for real understanding.  The producers took little care to spell check the subtitles and even invented words at times (""resonation"" instead of ""resonance"").  If you have any understanding of, or fondness for this series at all, the commentary is beyond immaturity, it is infuriating.

Serious fans of this work will be tempted to purchase the newly remastered and magnificently restored versions from Japan and subtitle their own (the English releases are not the remastered versions and are not high quality video transfers).  For everyone else, this release is ""better than nothing"", but it should be remembered that it is a poor translation in parts, and that anything that seems childish, stereotypical or clich are artifacts of translation.

I rate this product 5 stars solely on the basis of the quality of the original films, and without regard to the production standards of the English translation.",1172707200,2,2497,5.110837438423645

1385457,5,B000050IL8,"Death and Rebirth was a great remix of the series. It shed some light on things not discused or shown in the series and really gets you psyhed up to see EoE. A great movie in my book.

It seems unlike most people I did like the ""original"" ending that was part of the series but I must say that EoE has taken its place of episodes 19 and 23 as my all time favorites. Its hard to put EoE into words. It is simply mind blowing. If you consider yourself a fan of Evangelion you owe it to yourself to see this. Even if you thought the ""original"" ending was good, you should at the very least rent this. From the fighting to the always wonderfully deep story line, this truly is the best ending to the best anime saga EVER!

I also must state that I am not normally a fan of commentaries but the commentary done by Amanda Winn Lee (voice of Ayanami, Pen-Pen and english dubb producer), her husband Jason C. Lee (voice of Aoba and the Eva's and english dubb producer), and general Eva Nutt and voice actor Talison Jaffe really sheds some light on the greater mysteries of Evangelion and adds a hilarious tough to it as well. After you get done watchign the movies through the first time I recommend you go through with the commentary on.

The extras included beside the commmentary are excellent as well. It comes with a complete dictionary of all the terms used, every Angel, and in depth Character profiles as well. It comes with a photo gallery and much more. All in all this two movie set has some very great extras.",1156377600,,1513,4.301754385964912
1385458,3,B000050IL8,"While Evangelion was creative and interesting in concept, the ending was severely flawed, so much so that they tried in two succeeding movies to repair the ending and make it work.  But neither repair effort took.  The time investment of watching this anime story is great enough that it makes the disappointment all the deeper.  In my opinion, there is no excuse to abandon a fairly good story to the extent that the storymakers did at what proved a fairly decent story up until the ending was ruined and the viewer totally let down.
  Evangelion begins flying high on almost magic wings of imagination and conjures a world quite different from our own, yet very human and dramatic.  The characters are engaging and remind us of the best and worst within ourselves.  They are totally sympathetic and winsome.
  The story unfolds in such a way as to reveal the characters little by little and keeps us guessing enough that the suspense and plot tension work to keep the viewer wanting more--at least, this is true right up until the very end, where, for some inexplicable reason, the makers of this story decided to crash land Evangelion and cut it off abruptly, without warning and without explaining satisfactorily any of what they had it in mind to do.
  I cannot, in good conscience, give Evangelion lower than a three.  It was flying so high initially, and my approval of the overall concept was so favorable, that I cannot but give the first 50% to 60% of the story five stars.  It rates anywhere from four to five right up until the totally vexing and inappropriate conclusion, wherein the crash achieves BOMB status and must needs pull the average way down.
  If I could give it a 2 1/2, I would, but I have to round to a whole number in the five star system available to me here.
  If you are a real anime fan, you might want to view this one just so you might have the opportunity to witness the better aspects of the storytelling and also learn a lesson on what not to do to an ending.
  But I must end with a warning: Caveat emptor!  Let the buyer beware!",1155427200,2,2067,4.505376344086022

And although I've watched countless titles in-between, Neon Genesis Evangelion remains one of the most thought-provoking, beautifully executed science fiction series (anime or otherwise).

Perhaps the only thing that spoils the entire ""Perfect Collection"" experience is the rather washed-out colors, similar to a VHS tape.  That said, the sound is well-mixed and the voice acting well done (despite what other people may say).  However, if you'll spend your hard-earned money on an Evangelion box set, I'll point you towards the recently released ""Platinum Collection"" with enhanced audio and visual transfer.

1385461,5,B000050IL8,"Take an established genre, with strong cultural meaning, and turn it on its head. Then add a ghostly, dream-like quality and some of the most powerful, resonant imagery you can imagine. Mix in ancient mysteries and classic myths of unfiltered religion. Then tie up all the loose ends with characters you have grown to understand and love. Then end the world.

Its Anno's love letter to humanity and also his middle finger to convention. Its is one of the most important pieces of animation ever made and one of the most important pieces of art created in the last twenty years.

That being said, its sort of useless unless you've watched the series, subtitled and well translated. Its also sort of useless if you do not watch it with a caring, keen eye and an open mind. Dont expect to understand it conventionally. Its the punchline in a joke that you may never get.

Also, the american ""direction"" is absolutely nightmarish and the new translation questionable. Listening to the ""director"" commentary is like listening to some horrible person misinterperet your family photo albums. Amanda Winn Lee is simply not capable of acting, directing or producing something of this magantude, despite her gumption or opinions on the matter. do not, i repeat DO NOT watch this series or the film dubbed.

But no manner of nerdy american translation can ruin the raw genius at work in this film. Anno can still be felt and heard, and the quality of the images sure beats your best friend's cousin's fan-subbed bootleg. Take two weeks, watch the series, fall in love.

Is that it is Emotionally intense. never found a series so constructed over the raw emotiones of the charactor. Example: Opening scene.

After Shinji does something that most would seem messed up, I am not going to say what he Does but after he bluntly says ""I am So F***** Up"". normally you can find alot of other scenes such as when Auska is in here Eva near the end She Repeats I don't want to die for About 30 Seconds. thats when she goes randomly nuts. and before the other Evas Kill he she Repeats im going to kill you. Of course after that She dies.

my advice, watch the series, end of EVA, then you will understand what happened and the background of it.

My take on the End of Evangelion is that this movie explains gaps in the story and awnsers alot of the Questions from earlyer on in the series. hope you enjoy it, I did.",1141689600,3,1019,4.296875

So when I found the Evangelion Perfect Collection boxset and the the movies on sale at a rather cheap price I instantly bought them.

Just like when I saw the original series nigh ten years ago this series remains one of the best animes I have ever had the pleasure to see.

At the start of the series it seems to be the typical giant robot anime (Gundam, etc.), with its giant creatures, robots and explosions. However near the end of the first episode when the higher-ups at NERV are about to make a barely-conscious (and heavily injured) Rei pilot Eva Unit-01 I soon realized that this would not be like a typical anime. Around the mid-point in the series that is especially true.

The art-style used in this anime series is truly remarkable. The characters look nice and the Evas and Angels are very cool looking. The voice-acting is positevly great. This is definitely a highly recommended anime series for those that want something that's different. The ending to the series is pretty good too, though I much prefer the ending depicted in the EVA movies. Despite that this series is definitely worth picking up, I give it my highest recommendation.

The problem is that most of these screens are flashed so quickly that they are not readable.

1385476,3,B000050IL8,"This series has some good points and some bad points.

Good points:

- Stunning battles.  There is a good buildup to most of the battle sequences, adding to the excitement when the moment finally does come.  This could have been just another series with the standard big robot fight at the end of every episode, but it accomplishes a lot more than that making each and every battle unique and emotionally gut wrenching.

- Good animation.

- Great and involved plot.  The mystery gets deeper and deeper as the series progresses, and it left me hanging on the edge of my seat most of the way through.

- Fantastic music score.

Bad points:

- Unlikeable characters.  None of the characters are actually really likeable.  Misfits all round in this series.

- The characters don't grow.  Just when it seems they are going to develop a bit, they go back to the way they were.  No progression of characters personally (though the overall plot is still good).

- The ending has to be one of the worst endings in history.  Don't even watch the last two episodes of the series.  They've been remade into a movie which you should watch instead.  Even then, with the new ending, it still is not brilliant.  But thats for another review.

- The story takes a turn for the worst in episode 24.  It really does.  Ok, its more like a leap.  I had to go back to disc 7 to check that I hadn't missed an episode or something.

Overall it is a pretty good series.  It left me completely glued to the TV for the last 2 days straight.  It was a riveting experience.  Then on episodes 24-26 it all got thrown away.  Ended up leaving me with a foul taste in my mouth.  I'd say that you shouldn't bother with this one, if only the ride up to the end hadn't been so good.  As it is, my recommendation is to buy this set if you have the cash to spare.  Whatever you do, don't go blowing the next months worth of entertainment allowance to get this though.

1385477,1,B000050IL8,"Why people give this series anything above 3 stars is completely beyond me.  Personally, I give it a  star.  Luckily for NGE, Amazon only allows full star increments.  So, NGE:  you get 1 star.

I love anime: the art form, the nostalgia, the quirkiness.  Most of all, I love it when all that is coupled with a compelling storyline that not only engages you, but helps you ultimately learn something about yourself in the process.

NGE accomplishes none of those things.  Also, NGE fails in the following categories.

Characters:  I could spend hours complaining about the characters in NGE, but I'll spare you the misery.  Everyone is a failure.  Everyone is a complainer.  Everyone is annoying.  There is not a single character in NGE that I can identify with or a single character I feel compassion for.  I kept waiting for things to develop, to get better, to move on and progress, but things never did.  The character development just plateaus, and to my horror, gets worse.

Storyline:  I like mecha.  I like Godzilla-ish monster fights.  I like anime.  Then why do I dislike NGE so much?  The lack of a compelling or coherent storyline has much to do with that.  I like to be challenged by a storyline, but this is just lame writing.  The story was, in fact, written by a depressed Anno as he went along bending his vision to the whim of others (rumor has it he drank ""a bit"" also).  It shows.  The storyline left me asking, ""Why do I care about this?""  Ultimately, I don't.

Animation:  The animation is ok.  It's probably the thing that keeps people devoted to this series.  It's not the best animation.  Nor is it the worst.  Where it really fails is really where the entire series fails.  You just don't care about the background.  It's bland.  It's status quo.  This, of course, is interrupted by brief moments of anime nudity (woo hoo!?), gore, and epilepsy inducing flashbacks.

Save yourself a few dollars and pass on NGE.  Yes it has potential.  But, potential doesn't earn you 5 stars.  It just has too many failures and it ends up leaving you feel cheated.",1135123200,21,2073,4.613259668508287
1385478,4,B000050IL8,"A great series that explores the psychological aspects of its characters like no other, and yet supplies engaging action that expands on the Mech cliches of other series. This series evolves itself dramatically by the time it finishes - mostly due to the fact that it's creator, as I understand, had a nervous breakdown some way through the series (unknown reasons).

Whilst I respect the evolution, some of the enjoyment was lost due to the characters.

For example: the main trio at the beginning of the series: Shinji, who's a spineless nevrous wreck; Rei, who's emotionless; and Asuka who's arrogant - you'd expect them to overcome their weaknesses by the end of the series... but NO. They somehow get worse - not only psychologically (how they're supposed to perhaps), but also less likeable cos they just can't get a grip.

With that said, all the other aspects of the characters are great - they are richly detailed and unique.

The visuals are superb - the techniques and artwork and general direction are expertly crafted. The sound too, is powerful and yet subtle, and the musical score is enjoyable.

Since the series can get a little slow moving, I wouldn't consider hurrying to watch it all over again as quickly as I would a few other series'. But I definately will more than others since it's atmosphere is so rich and memorable.",1134086400,7,1344,4.800865800865801
1385479,2,B000050IL8,"I heard many good things about NGE but after finishing the entire series a few months ago, I was greatly disappointed. The plot began interestingly enough but there really wasn't much character development beyond the two-dimensional surface of each of the characters. There were several cool sub-plots introduced throughout the series, such as some kind of conspiracy behind the Angel project, an ulterior motive on the part of the project's creator, and a possible clone of his wife with the pilot of the original Eva. Ultimately however the viewer is left with more loose ends than not, and to make matters worse the final 3 episodes confused things beyond any type of coherence.

The final volume was actually very interesting in its own right but it felt out of place and like an entirely different series, having little to nothing to do with the first 7 volumes. Some thought provoking philosophical ideas were introduced akin to those of 'Ghost In the Shell 2', but nothing really ground breaking and definitely incongruent with the flow and feel of the previous episodes.

As for Shinji's character, I definitely see the correlation between him and most other teenagers with their angst and so on, but I've seen it a million times and it really isn't something that piques my interest. Him and that red haired German girl were essentially the same, problems with their parents and they rebelled in their own way. Both characters seemed like stereotypes of a dozen other similar characters that I've seen in numerous other anime series. I guess the main difference between NGE and other series is that they were both far more annoying than most. I forget the name of the grey haired chick, pilot of Eva 00, but she was about as deep as William Shatner's interpretation of Cpt. Kirk. For a series to be involving the characters have to posess some redeeming qualities, something to pull the audience in, and I never saw that with any of the characters.

NGE was a series with a unique premise that held great promise but unfortunately it failed miserably in execution. It is the most over-hyped anime series ever and I honestly think that all the fans of the series aren't looking at the story and characters objectively. Not only that but the main protagonist was extremely annoying, even up until the very end. In fact there were very few likeable characters if any. None of them struck me as anything memorable. I read recently that the director/creator of NGE admitted that he made up some of the diverging plot elements such as the conspiracy angles as he went along, and it certainly shows. As it stands it has an unfinished feel and overall it just seemed unprofessional, except for the animations, sound and music. A bold yet overly ambitious idea and subsequent realization.

I give it 2/5 stars for a promising concept and the impressive animation, but the story lacks any noteworthy character development, lack of memorable and unique characters and primarily a weak plot that is dragged down by its gaping plot holes.",1131840000,16,3034,4.862669245647969

The story is definately one in which you have to pay close attention, and I'd even recommend a little college level education, because somewhere along the line you'll get lost and you'll need to find your way back again. But oh, when you start watching and catching some of the symbolism in the story, you begin to feel the satisfaction that comes with realizing that you are of the human species, the speaking species, the thumb species.

Okay, seriously--such a great word for this anime, ""serious""--this anime is definately not for kids, but if you're older (I'd recommend fourteen, at least) and have a love of literature, watch this!

1385482,5,B000050IL8,"""I don't know much about Animes, but this one is just unique and extraordinary. the plot is apocalyptic and there are abstractly profound scenes, such as Sinji's instable psychological state occasionally gets into. NGE places Biblical metaphors, Jewish myths, as characters and the whole plot's symbolism throughout. and there is Kierkegaard's notion about 'three stages of the human existence', similar with 'three impacts on the earth'. even the episode 16 has a Japanese title that exactly means one of his writing, 'the sickness unto death'.

Kierkegaard, who is Danish solifidian existential philosopher, said every human unconsciously have the anxiety and the despair because we don't know what we should do, where we came from, where we were meant to be gone, in the middle of the world, with plenty of other lives, the losing the purpose of the life and God(liken to Sinji's father, Asuka's mother)'s love. and after all, we suffer the despair, the same thing that Sinji undergoes. and K' refers to the human existence in the form of three stages, composed with the aesthetic, the ethical and the religious, also similar with 'three impacts' or 'three cases' in the episode 25, 26.

He argues, that most important other than anything, all of these ego-improvement process, is have to be done only by the an individual's free will, not by others', deep awakening in frond of God by the own will is needed to do overcome the sickness unto death as Sinji finally completes.

Meanwhile, an individual never can't understand perfectly the others as the ego and the other self, the other's view on an individual's ego, are totally different. so Sinji and Rei suffer the loneliness from this, which makes us to got conflicts, killings, wars all over the world endlessly. but if our bodies and spirits put together, we could evolve to understand every the other's thing in the state, can't possibly define whether it's 'we' or just alone. Seele want humanity to be one under the 'human completion plan'. this kind of notion is associated with Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre's philosophical theory.

Anyway, I won't enumerate it more. overall, this animation doesn't explain/clear a thing. the scenario is hard to follow if you didn't see it very carefully. only I can say about this Anime is surely odd, exquisite as well. and I'm sure the director is someone like Japanese Stanley Kubrick. he gave me a serious headache.""

yes, this anime has it's typical anime characteristics, pretty chicks, decent boobage, funny side characters(ie pen-pen the penguin), and some serious ass kicking fight scenes, but that's where the commonalities end.  this series takes anime to a different level on the thought processing of viewers.

each episode slowly sets you up for the grand finale, no, not the final episodes of the series but for the one that is sold seperately, the end of evangelion.  as each episode unlocks the mental workings of each of the different characters, it also introduces certain events that progresses your understanding of how their own psyche deals with such things.  all of this reaches a culmination in the final movie where all mental hell breaks loose and it all needs to be sorted back together by those very characters (or that one character, rather), the one which you were able to watch grow throughout the series.  very intriguing.

but honestly, this is one of those series where you can't watch them out of sequence.  i mean, you could, but then you wouldn't get the complete appreciation out of it.  no way in hell am i going to let any of my friends watch the dvd set unless they watch each and every episode, in order.  but then again, not all of my friends are really curious about the inner workings of the human psyche and how raw and simple we are no matter how complex we make things to be.

1385486,2,B000050IL8,"That about sums up my reaction to Neon Genesis Evangelion. I watched this show because, like many others here, I got caught in the hype surrounding it. It's hard to not be curious about something that's hailed as ""the greatest anime of all time!"" With a reputation like that, I was expecting something with an exciting and tight plot, deep and well-developed characters that I could relate to and root for, and basically, something loaded with the kind of action and intrigue that keeps you glued to the screen until it's over and makes you want to turn around and watch it all over again.

Unfortunately, Evangelion did not, in my opinion, provide any of this. The beginning was slow and dull, which isn't really a big deal by itself as long as things pick up later...but it never really did. As many other viewers here have already said, I kept waiting for the show to happen, for something, anything, that would grab me and pull me in, but it never did. There were a few points in the middle where things began to look up and I thought ""All right, here we go!"" only to find myself disappointed.

The plot was so vague that it was almost non-existent. Maybe that's the point, I don't know, but it's very difficult to watch something that doesn't really feel like it's going anywhere. A favorite author of mine once said that a story without a plot is nothing more than a bunch of stuff that happened. That's the feeling I get from watching Evangelion: nothing but a bunch of stuff that happened to some people.

Speaking of which, there are no real heroes here, just a lot of psychologically screwed up individuals who don't get along with each other. They are developed pretty thoroughly, which is a good thing, and a good deal of the show is devoted to exploring the minds, personalities, and desires of the characters. In fact, the last two episodes of the series are devoted entirely to exploring the mind of the main character, Shinji Ikari.

The dialogue is pretty bland. Half the time, it's boring conversation about day-to-day stuff, sometimes it's funny, but most of the time its filled with vague references to past events that are never fully explained or consists of technical jargon and people shouting orders...not very interesting.

Also, if you're looking for something packed with amazing mecha battles, you might want to look somewhere else. Compared to shows like Escaflowne and Full Metal Panic...well...this just doesn't even compare. Go watch those other two instead. The characters are more interesting and less screwed up, there's loads more action, and the battles are awesome.

The best advice I could give anyone who is thinking about watching Evangelion is to borrow or rent before you buy. That way, if you hate it, you won't be out $120 bucks. That's what I did.

If you like shows that are heavily focused on character interaction and development, don't have good dialogue, and have practically no plot and no exciting action, then this is the show for you. On other hand, if you like action, interesting characters, and a show with a good story, you might want to check out Full Metal Panic, Escaflowne, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Fullmetal Alchemist, and basically anything else that ISN'T Neon Genesis Evangelion.

Two stars, because the animation was boring but good.",1125964800,13,3299,4.795774647887324
1385487,5,B000050IL8,"I purchased these dvds a long time ago. Since then I believe this is my 4th time watching this dvd. The series makes a huge change in tone with this dvd. The first four dvds are more light-hearted, yet this one is very somber.

The first episode is an interesting story between Kaji and Misato. It is a pretty good love story now that I think about it. There are some new revelations brought about here that shed more light on the evas.

The second episode is my favorite of the whole series. Shinji has to fight one of the more unique angels, and the ending is classic.

The third episode sheds some light on some other characters that you haven't heard alot about so far. They make it pretty obvious who the fourth child is, but it is still fun to watch.

1385488,2,B000050IL8,"I remember while peeling off the shrinkwrap on my boxed set, there was a sticker, ""One of the Greatest Anime Series of All Time!""  This one little sticker almost provided as much unsubstantiated hype as the marketing engine that tried to launch Star Wars: Episodes I & II.

I must admit to being an older anime ""watcher"".  I suppose, for perhaps one year, I might have actually been considered a diehard ""fan"" of anime.  This was back in the Kimagure Orange Road / Ranma 1/2 days.

After years of not watching any anime, I was pretty pumped to have Evangelion take my breath away, give me something to anticipate going home to after work on the rare days I have to simply sit back and chill.  All because of that one little white sticker on the shrinkwrap.

Well, I tolerated Episode I.  Was it an episode that was edited incorrectly?  Was it cut short?  How come I didn't get that brow-raising, gimme-more feeling that the end of an episode within ""One of the Greatest Anime Series of All Time"" should reasonably provide me?

Then I sat through Episodes 2... 3... 4... if I remember correctly, I don't believe I was emotionally touched until, perhaps, Episode 8.  But even that was fleeting.  But still, pretty much nothing made any sense.  Pilot requirements of being 14 years of age?  Should we simply assume they're just ""ripe"" for piloting an Eva?  What's so deep about the characters anyway?  Even with all of the psychological tribulations the pilots encountered, I found nothing shocking or, conversely, nothing even rational to add any weight or relevance to the plot.  The same messages about humanity that are conveyed here are just about as strong as, say, in Akira-- that man's ultimate destiny is one of hopelessness, self-eradication, and greed.  The questions posed, that the other reviews touch upon are the same ones I can find in countless other movies, books, series, preachers... so what's new?  What's so ""Greatest"" about this concept, or even the integration of all the philosophical and psychological concepts discussed?

The only time I actually found myself really wanting more was after... was it Episode 18?  When ... the main character's... father (yeah, they're that memorable to me right now...) nearly killed off the main character's classmate as he was piloting... I think.

Unfortunately, I was morbidly disappointed.  The artwork isn't evolutionary, let alone revolutionary.  At face value, I see none of the purported ""artistic value"" that so many reviewers claim.  Even Lain, Cowboy Bebop seem more visually captivating than anything out of Evangelion.  The characters were flatter than cardboard cut-outs at anime conventions, with absolutely no depth.  True mecha fans (or even fans of the essence of mechanical design) will find nothing redeeming here.

I must admit I'm not expert theologist of Judeo-Christianity, so maybe I simply wasn't clued into any of the ""complex layers"" that others refer to in the plotline.  If anything, I feel the plot transitions extremely abrupt, with many contrasting themes thrown together like rocks in a blender.  It really didn't work for me.  But if this is a uniting vehicle of extremely devout Judeo-Christianity believers, then a sinner am I.

I don't mind the psychological pitfalls that rack the three Evangelion pilots.  But so many things just didn't seem very rational or natural to me, such as the Angels only performing attacks one by one, the obvious plot predictability in the earlier episodes, ""only 14-year old pilot candidates need apply"", the boxcutter armament of the Eva's.

I don't think Evangelion is equivalent to dog food.  I feel it has its merits, but not without its faults that should be recognized.  But I don't believe its loftiness being hailed as ""One of the Greatest Anime of All Time"" applied to my experience watching it.  I don't disagree what other reviewers see in it, but know that you, as an interested party of this item, there's a good chance that you may end up being disappointed.

Or perhaps, simply ignore the hype (which might be hopeless now) so that it doesn't taint your expectations, and end the series with a far more enjoyable experience than I had.

I really need to see what others see in this anime series.  Reviewers, post some URL's of discussions about this anime.

1385496,5,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is indubitably the best anime ever to grace this earth, and one of the best and most impressive visual presentations I have encountered in my life thus far.

Hideaki Anno is a genius. That is a clear fact that one gains after watching this series. I could go write page after page on why this presentation almost attains perfection.

Evangelion focuses on intense anime mech battles, as well as battles of the inner psyche of the characters. The psychological aspect shines through a lot more brightly than the mecha. However, the mecha is enough to draw anyone interested in this concept to the anime because all thematic objects are precisely woven together.

One of the best parts of this anime is the character development and characters in general. I found the characters were extremely fascinating, and many times could relate to their life situations. The characters and their thoughts are so well developed and portrayed, that one may question his/her own existence after watching this series.

The plot is very deep and engaging. It is not recommended for people who prefer simplicity and easy transition. Evangelion is not an easy presentation to comprehend; it takes critical thinking. Those who hate philosophy and the image of life's problems should most likely avoid this anime, though I am convinced that it can touch any person.

The mood in the series is one of depression, though it starts out a lot brighter than it ends up. The world is in deep disarray after the ""Second Impact"" and certain beings known as ""angels"" attack. The only way to stop these angels is through the use of the Evangelion mechs. In my opinion, the depressed environment in Neon Genesis creates an incredibly powerful work of art that can deeply affect a person if taken seriously.

There's a great amount of symbolism and openness in interpretation on this series. It will definetly challange the mind. However, the last two episodes, while I liked them, did not provide an actual plot resolution. There was an epiphany in these last two episodes, but it somewhat leaves viewers longing for more material and the true conclusion. This can be found in the ""End of Evangelion"" DVD which is a must buy for this series. Overall, everything in this series adds up, and the main reason I liked it so much because of the characters. They are real and lifelike, and their situation can draw people in deeply. Spend your money, you will not be disappointed.",1116028800,5,2466,4.873508353221957
1385497,5,B000050IL8,"As a boy whose life revolves around heavy metal music and Japanese animation, I certainly have very acquired taste. And I will say, as a deep, enthusiastic viewer of anime, I will have to say that Neon Genesis Evangelion is the absolute best of the best! So many things about it are great! At a first glance, it looks like nothing more than a mere clone of Gundam with a completely different style of art. But when you really watch the show, you see something different. At first, it seems like a silly series with some serious battles. But eventually, the series shifts into perhaps one of the most disturbing and depressing science fiction dramas that Japan has ever spawned! The art is stunning, and the character design is highly unique. Every character has some importance in the story. The cast of characters includes:

I. The Pilots (5 children chosen to pilot the Evangelions)

Rei Ayanami

Asuka Langley Sohryu

Shinji Ikari

Toji Suzuhara

Kaworu Nagisa

II. NERV Headquarters staff

Commander Gendo Ikari

Professor Kouzou Fuyutsuki

Captain Misato Katsuragi

Doctor Ritsuko Akagi

Makoto Hyuga

Maya Ibuki

Kensuke Aida (Touji's BFFL)

Pen-Pen (Misato's pet penguin)

Hikari Horaki (class rep)

SEELE

Keel Lorenz (Chairman of SEELE)

The plot is as such:

In the year 2001, Adam, the first of 17 supernatural human beings called Angels, causes Second Impact to occur, killing half of the world's population. During this time, 5 children are given birth. Only they can save third impact from occurring.

I could try to explain the series to you in this single review, but I'd probably run out of text space. So, I'll review the series episode by episode by reviewing the individual discs. The bottom line: a true fan of Japanese animation can't miss it!",1115769600,5,2269,5.134986225895317
1385498,4,B000050IL8,"This review is directed mainly at fans and followers of the series:

Given the release of the new-and-improved Platinum Collection (with booklets and commentary), the term ""Perfect Collection"" probably wasn't the best choice in retrospect for this box set.  There are almost no notable extras on these discs, meaning that, other than a few trailers and poorly-designed bios, you get the series - subbed and dubbed - and nothing else.  It really comes down to whether or not you want to pay more for the extras; the Perfect Collection can go as low as $75 at a major retailer ($127 - the price as of this post - is way too high for this), while the Platinum can cost almost double, spanning anywhere from $150 to $200+ at some retailers ($194.86 directly from Amazon as of this post...also way too high).  Of course, it's all in how you play your cards...though if you're not all that interested in extras, the Perfect Collection is going to be the better choice...just don't expect the perfect experience.",1114732800,4,1005,4.758620689655173
1385499,5,B000050IL8,"NOTE: This review will not attempt to review the series in any specific detail. There are most likely plenty of other past reviews which can do that.

I've been watching anime for almost 2 decades. I've seen quite a few over time from the classic mecha based anime such as Macross (Robotech) and Gundam to more surreal type of movies like Akira. None of these anime had quite the affect on me like NGE.

I've been holding off from watching this series for over 5 years now. I've always heard about it but was turned off from all the hype. I figured I'd wait a while until I could find some time to watch another long mecha series. I hail from the Gundam Universe where I believed the balance of characters and mecha was perfect.

It was quite the surprise when I realized it was more of a philosophical argument cleverly disguised in a mecha-like anime series. The anime itself can draw in the casual enthusiast through the nicely drawn characters and unique mecha designs. What sets it apart is the tight hold it puts on you once you have started to watch. The character development and plot twists hit you from the first episode. Each episode always had me asking what happened in the past that caused this and what will happen in the future?

The complexity and well sculptured character personalities is another high point. Even the least focused character is given enough background detail to merit some uniqueness and purpose to the series. I believe any fan will have a specific character they can identify with in one form or another. Each character has such a unique personality that you can't help but become fond of.

On another note, I have only seen the TV Boxed set series and am awaiting my copy of End of Evangelion to arrive. This supposedly offers more background as well as an alternate ending to the already existing ""open-for-interpretation"" ending in the box set.

Most people say the ending is sad and depressing. I believe the ending ""is what it is"". It can be interpreted in any way the viewer wishes. I know many of us would want a solid answer (whether it be bad or not) but I think the creators did not really intend for any clear cut definition. Instead, I find myself watching specific episodes (which mainly ends with me watching the whole series again) to further solidify or dissolve my current theories.

I must say once again that I've never seen such an anime that was as thought provoking as this one. In contrast, many people can simply watch it superficially and enjoy the subtle humor, explosive action and occasional ""fan service"". However, I do feel that the way the story is presented will eventually cause the mind of the viewer to stir and want to analyze the series in more depth.

This series is highly recommended! I am also recommending End of Evangelion as well since it supposedly ties up more loose ends from the boxed set. I've also read that the Director Cut DVD for episodes 21-23 is also recommended. I plan on getting that as well.",1113436800,8,2988,4.603383458646617
1385500,5,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion does things American animated series can't. It touches on subjects American animation studios wouldn't (or if they did it would be only in a poor attempt at humor). From sexuality to religion to the fundamental beliefs that make us who we are, Neon Genesis Evangelion tests the minds of its viewers, culminating in the final two psyche-cracking episodes. If written as a novel, one could only describe Neon Genesis Evangelion as literature at its very best.

It starts out simply enough as a above average mech with outstanding characters, but then you start to get confused, most things like this keep the the characters in the dark while the audience knows everything, this will confuse the audience as well, for most the the series you'r not even sure what the mystery is. This is outstanding, the only flaw I can possibly think of is you are still confuses after the last episode, so I highly recomend getting the movie also, it is called The End of Evangalion, otherwise you will never know much of the story unless you are really observant.

1385503,5,B000050IL8,"Well, as a great fan of EVA, I have researched many possibilities as to what Anno means with this series (I'm still finding new ones!).

1) If one wants to fully enjoy Neon Genesis, one must be familiar with both the Kabbalistic and Christian religions along with basic Jewish mythology.

2) One must also continually ask questions and observe every last detail during the show. Then one must go back and re-watch EVA in order to fully grasp many key points.

3) Many more questions and answers are provided in the movie ""End of Evangelion,"" (not contained in this set) which, contrary to popular belief, should be watched *with* episodes 25 and 26. One who watches both, the show and the movie, repeatedly, will better come to terms with the reality of the situations presented.

4) In order to fully understand every detail of Anno's masterpiece, one must review every aspect of confrontation between characters. There in lies the secret to uncovering the many secrets involving Neon Genesis Evangelion!

1385504,4,B000050IL8,"Before I saw Neon Genesis Evangelion my appreciation of Anime as a genre had been brief. Now I doubt I'll ever witness something as well written, shocking and genuinely fascinating again. First off, I'd like to say the '12' rating is probably a little too lenient, though the minor swearing is nonetheless effective and never gratuitous. If you're looking for an overview of the story you're probably better served elsewhere, and these overviews will most likely emphasise the importance of robots in the storyline; the Evangelions themselves. What really struck me, however, was the character interaction, suspense, and philosophical debate; the main character, Shinji Ikari, provides a likable, realistic protagonist, paired alongside the enigmatic Rei and boisterous Asuka; all pilots of these machines in a battle against a race of strange space-monsters known as the 'Angels'. Many have rubbished the series on its content aside from these battles, as it may prove too complex for the perceived majority of the target audience; 11-15 year-olds and, more cynically, its popular and critical acclaim. After all, what lies beneath is not purely a satire or series of metaphors but a fully-fledged philosophical debate over what it means to be human, one's perceived worth, and coming to terms with our fears. At times neurotic and cringe-worthy, but almost always compelling, the series inside the Neon Genesis Evangelion box set is not, in fact, the Perfect (read: entire) collection because it does not contain 4 other parts of the epic saga, 2 of which are pretty much essential:- Death and rebirth and The End of evangelion. Whilst the final 2 episodes on this box set focus entirely on the characters' mental states, the films lengthen the storyline to a more fulfilling conclusion.",1104883200,,1789,5.215277777777778
1385505,3,B000050IL8,"Yes, you may have heard that it was a phenominon in mecha anime, but NO! It isn't all that great. To say Neon Genesis Evangelion is popular would be an understatement. Many feel that with its great cast of characters, awesome art and animation, a deep, evolving story, a great soundtrack, and direction by one of the greatest anime directors of all time, it's the greatest anime ever.

Problem #1: The Cast. Nearly everyone in the series angsts over their dark pasts. The main character, Ikari Shinji, does nothing but angst literally two-thirds of the series. Although I didn't hate him, I did find him to be a spineless [...] who failed to realize that some people actually care about him. But he's too busy angsting over his dad, the creepy Ikari Gendou the man who wants to be GOD??? And when the characters are not angsting, they're yelling. Asuka is a prime example of this, always yelling at everyone being an idiot as she hypes herself above all others as being the greatest of the pilots of the EVA units, when she's probably the most useless. Two episodes after her debut, I began to shrug whenever Asuka appeared on the screen.

I careless if the characters angsted or complained so much, only if they developed over time. Shinji opens up a little, and that's about it. Besides, everyone's too busy being weighed down by childhood trauma to cheer up. While the early episodes of the series are cute and funny, the later episodes are unfunny and boring. No one develops, and no one opens up!

Problem #2: The Script. The story is definitely stronger than the weak characters that are in it. I have to note that you actually have to use your head in this series. SIGH. I was asking questions like Why is NERV attacking the Angels? Why is Gendou so cold to his son? Who created the EVA units? All these questions, and many more, are answered as the series progresses, and some may never be answered at all. Plus, every character's past, at one point or another, is looked upon, giving us insight into that person's life. And the surprises in the final episodes will surprise you, such as that ... well, you have to see them for yourself.

Although the story itself is deep, engrossing, and well-done, I wish the dialogue between characters was of the same caliber. Most of the dialogue between characters consists of either references to religions you'd have to look up in an encyclopedia or online to fully understand.

Problem #3: The animation. The art design of this series is nice, whether it be the well-drawn characters, or the very realistic landscape. Animation is of a surprisingly decent, considering that GAINAX is a low-budget animation company.

Unfortunately, GAINAX's status as a low-budget animation company shows in the later episodes. Later episodes consist almost entirely of still shots, whether it be of mountains, trains, or alarm clocks, and characters barely even move their mouths. Clip shows, flashback footage, recycled animation, etc., are all used in the second half of the series. But if a series is going to be 26 episodes long, shouldn't all the episodes be of the same animation level? I mean, GAINAX did a great job animating Nadia only five years earlier, and that was 39 episodes long.

Problem #4: Music. Music can make or break a series. The theme is good and the background music is sparse with few music pieces, and yet there are at least 2 CDs.

Problem #5: Voice Actors. With a mediocre directing job by Anno Hideaki, and then throw in a mediocre English dub, its decent. Yet, we also have a problem w/ the Jap. dub. The females sound like ill, high-tempured brats.

It's said that Anno Hideaki was depressed when he worked on Evangelion, and after watching this series, I was depressed as well. Depressed about how much better the show could have been if it only had character development and better dialogue between characters.

It had a LOT of potential to really be the best ever, but lost track along the way. Those who don't mind angst, or those who like mecha may like this series, yet I do not reecommend this. Go watch Love Hina or Excel Saga...its entertaining compared to the boring, dull Neon Genesis Evangelion.",1102809600,4,4175,4.722527472527473
1385506,2,B000050IL8,"Interesting series of kids being mentally tied to thier robot. But the robot is thier own being too. So when the pilot blacks out the robot takes over at times.

The only thing I disliked about the series is the trauma. Father doesn't love me. He would rather work than do anything with me, love me, say anything encouraging to me. It's so full of woe is me stuff.

As long as there were enemies to fight. The woe is me stuff wasn't too bad when mixed with hope and understanding. But once all was done and the last 2 dvd's were full of disappointing woe is me stuff. That's what made this box set very disappointing.

 I was hoping for more of an up beat ending. A new hope. All the angles (enemy creatures) are dead and the boy would take his favorate girl or girls and escape from his father. The father that didn't show that he cared.",1102723200,3,838,4.21875
1385507,5,B000050IL8,"The world is being attacked by Angels.  Whether sent by God or some other force, mankind refuses to just lay down and die.  They fight back with Evangelions. Bio-engineered weapons born from one of the first Angels, these are the last hope for Earth.  But the anime is not just about fighting mecha, or alien invasion, it is also a series of questions.  What do people want?  What do we fear?  What is our self?  What is truth?  What is reality?

These questions are as important to the plot as the Angels.  Because unless the pilots, the children to who are the minds of the Evangelions, can find the answers, the final fate of humanity might be to meet its end at the hands of the Angels.  Or, if they can reach victory and find their way, a new genesis for man.

Nice music, real problems, gitty characters, lots of blood, lots of pain.  Mature in the questions it asks and the answers it finds.",1102118400,4,898,4.36969696969697
1385508,5,B000050IL8,"At first I was skeptical because I had heard that Evangelion was some sort of draining emotional saga full of controversy. Well that isn't entirely the case. Neon Genesis Evangelion is an absolute smash hit, from the characters to the animation to the soundtrack to the plot. The show's spotlight characters are Shinji, Rei, Asuka, Misato, and obviously Misato's pet penguin Pen Pen. They all face their own challenges and obstacles even though their physical goal - defeating the onslaught of the Angels - is the same.

Some fans say Shinji Ikari is a tough character to bond to, and that may be true if you enjoy action-crazy animes that lack emotion. Evangelion busts with emotion, and no character adds more drama than Shinji. He is young and vulnerable and yet still a good genuine soul. For him, piloting the Eva is a terror he comes to realize that he must face against his will for the good of those around him, those same people who have often mistreated or misjudged him.

Rei Ayanami is a mysterious and sketchy character. She sports the fashionable blue hair and soft voice, although she rarely speaks at all. She is very determined and loyal; she willingly agrees to pilot Unit 01 in the first episode even when her body is injured and healing. Thankfully Shinji smartens up and she doesn't have to. All in all, Rei is the composed and gentle one who puts work before emotion...if she even feels emotion at all.

And then there is the third major Eva pilot, Asuka Langley. She is wild and moody, very different from Rei. She strives to put Rei down and sees both of the other pilots as her competition. She refuses to warm up to Shinji as well, even though she winds up moving in with him and Misato. Asuka can be tough to like or connect with, but she provides a much-needed balance from the intensity of Shinji and Rei.

As the pilots struggle through their adventures with each other, with their Evas, with the Angels, and ultimately with themselves, all three hit hurdles which they must triumph over. Fans of character-based animes will adore the character development and the conflicts between the contrasting personalities.

Ultimately, Neon Genesis Evangelion is possibly the best example of an anime that curbs the competiton and reigns supreme in utilizing finely-crafted characters, a unique or abnormal plot line, and commendable animation and music to mold a simply fantastic series.",1101859200,5,2409,4.823244552058111
1385509,3,B000050IL8,"My girlfriend and I are big fans of anime and really enjoyed this series up until the end.  As many people have already written, you're hoping that many questions will be answered in the final 2 episodes, but most aren't.  Or maybe they are and you just have to suffer through those 2 episodes 10 times to figure out what the 'acid trip on film' is really trying to say.  It's unfortunate that such a great series could fail so miserably at the end.  We also rented the alternate ending and found the first 45 minutes of it to be good and then the last 45 minutes were just more of the same nonsense in the original ending.  My girlfriend and I consider ourselves to be fairly intelligent folks, but we sat there watching it saying, ""What kind of crackhead would put this crap together?""  It was very disappointing.  Some pseudo-intellectuals will call both endings 'artistic' and 'thought-provoking', but they're really just a bunch of nonsense.

So, in summary, if you're going to watch the series, just watch the first 24 episodes and then stop.  Despite all the whining and complaining from the characters throughout the series, it still is a wonderfully written and rendered anime series.  And very original.  Just don't bother with episodes 25 and 26 or renting the alternate ending.  They kill the whole thing.  And this series isn't for kids.",1101772800,3,1350,4.717948717948718
1385510,3,B000050IL8,"This is the third DVD in the Platinum Series and it offers all the things we've grown to be used to from the previous 2 releases. One thing which is immediatly noticable is that this DVD doesn't contain 5 but 4 episodes (11 to 14). Whats also different is that they started using the episode names which are displayed in the 2nd half of the episodes. The ""original"" name is still displayed first in the series and used in the ending trailers, but I guess they're using the official names on the DVD box and in the menu now. The episodes on this DVD are: ""The day Tokyo-3 stood still"" (former name / also known as: ""In the still darkness""), ""She said: Don't make others suffer for your personal hatred"" (aka ""The value of a miracle is...""), ""Lilliputian Hitcher"" (aka ""Angel invasion"") and ""Weaving a story"" (aka ""Seele, throne of souls""). So don't let the names fool you if they sound unfamiliar ;-)

Before I continue with the extra contents let me first do a quick re-run for readers who are not yet familiar with this release: The Platinum series is a re-release of the Neon Genesis Evangelion anime serie. It features enhanced picture quality (so that it will give out a very clear and sharp picture on (modern) installations) and its sound dubs have also been improved. You'll quickly discover (in comparison with the original release) that some of the enhancements really add up to the experience. Like, for example, the sound which fades to the right when a talking person walks out of the screen to the right side. The sound dubs (both English and Japanese) should be in 5.1 surround but I can't verify that since I still use stereo. Perhaps its good to know that even on stereo the new dubs sound very nice in the overall.

Rounding up the re-run: they have also added some new material to the serie in some episodes but on this DVD it is only clearly noticable in the ""preview"" section at the end of an episode (which is simply different from the original). Most extra's in the serie are very hard to spot (so I may be offtrack here) but this DVD has no extra scenes (note that I'm considering 2 - 3 seconds of new material an extra scene as well) in comparison with the original release. Because Amazon has caught up with the pictures I'll skip that description. Just keep in mind that you're seeing the picture of the silver ""slip over"" box which contains the real DVD box. Don't let the sharp picture on this site fool you; the original is a little more vague due to light transperancy. The DVD box itself features the same picture more clearly but partly since it also has a title printed on it. The back sums up the several episodes with the original airdate and the names written out in Kanjii.

So on with the extra's... The first (usual) extra is the 12 page booklet, excellent material. It features some very nice pictures (some scenes from the series on the DVD), a short story about the new 5.1 sound dub, a quick commentary on the episodes (quick storyline) and ofcourse a description of the 3 Angels which are encountered on this DVD. Rounding up is a nice (short / 1 page) description of Evangelion Unit 1 (Shinji's unit). Note that it may be wise to keep the booklet outside the DVD case. I noticed that it fits, but that about says it all.

Onto the extras on the disc: First it has the clear opening & ending, like all of them do. And I discovered the first little goof-up in the series so far... It almost seems as if Amazon made a deliberate one in their editorial description as well (sorry guys but Shinji doesn't get praised in the episode with the ""Spidery angel"" (Episode 11) but in the one after it (Episode 12). Don't let the original series fool you ;-)). This DVD features 2 audio commentary tracks: Tiffany Grant (English voice actress for Asuka) is back again and gives us some comments during episode 11 (""The day Tokyo-3 stood still"") and the pair of Matt Greenfield (ADR director) and Wade Shemwell (The 5.1 sound supervisor for the English track) give their comments during episode 13 (""Lilliputian hitcher""). What the menu and booklets and such don't tell you is that Tiffany brought along her husband as well. But thats all I'm telling about the commentary in order not to spoil anything for ""non die-hard fans"" and others for which this may still come as a surprise.

Last but certainly not least they have a video about the English remix process. In here both Matt Greenfield and Wade Shemwell give some insight information about the (re)creation / remastering of the English sound dubs.

All in all very interesting but I didn't consider it as exciting as the extra's on the previous disc, hence my comment about it being slightly dull. Please keep in mind that I don't like audio commentaries very much, so while I might consider things a bit dull others maybe very excited about them. Apart from that I have to admit that Tiffany's commentaries are very interesting and amusing to listen to. I'd like to advice all others who feel like me about commentaries in the overall to give the ones with Tiffany in it a fair chance; you may be very amused and surprised.

Well, that about rounds it up. Is it worth it? I think it is, both for fans (this is a very informative release) and new comers (the extra episode in comparison with the original release and the enhancements makes it worth the money IMO).

One last personal comment though: I'm very curious as to what artwork will be used on the rest of the DVD boxes. So far we've seen Shinji, Rei and Asuka. If you'll skim Amazon you'll notice that Misato will be on the next release. All of these characters are also displayed on the big ""silver colored"" box which was optional with the first DVD (to house all 7 releases). The pictures of Asuka and Misato are printed on the box just as you see them on the DVD boxes. Shinji and Rei are featured as a pair on the back (from the 1st episode where Shinji holds Rei in his arms) so one can only wonder if the rest of the prints will be used as well...  One way to find out :-)",1101686400,14,6025,4.489963503649635

1385514,5,B000050IL8,"( As a warning, sorry if I get anything wrong for all you hardcore fans) I was introduced to Evangelion merely through all the talk I heard from people. It pissed me off, because it psyched me up for something that I expected to be perfect. This show though didn't make me feel that way at first leaving me to say it was ok; until the first battle Shinji had with an Angel. The method they executed it, although used in other works, was simply deep; and having Misato walk in and say "" You did a very good thing Shinji. You should be proud,"" was perfect. This show is full of plenty of things like this: so deep and full of meaning. Also it's intricate way of incorporating life, death, love, hate, fear, and joy were amazing. At points you'd say go for it Shinji in regards for his growing relationships with either, Misato, Asuka, and of course, Rei. Personally I hoped it would be Asuka. In this series you get a true view of all the problems that we all face in life in a slightly larger scale. We are all afraid of failure, afraid of being viewed as useless, afraid of death and killing, wish not to risk our emotions, and afraid of being alone. The writers and director traverse these aspects of life with unimaginable grace. As I write this I'm being overwhelmed with emotion from my memories of this series. Most would say watching a cartoon would be boring and would have no real meaning has not experience the unbridled passion which animes can carry; and Evangelion is the embodiment of this ideal. So if you're a person who enjoys mystery, love, despair, comedy, and revelation wrapped up into one neat package then you've just found what you've been searching for.",1099440000,5,1677,4.483660130718954

1385524,5,B000050IL8,"If you are only interested in watching how the series is meant to end, just get End of Evangelion.

Ok Death is a recaps the series.  Rebirth sort of leaves us with a disgusted feeling for Shinji, but he's pretty screwed up psychologically.  He's 14 and he's been the pilot of an enormous, powerful, killing machine, and he hates to kill, and more importantly, he hates himself.  So this is kind of understandable, but still.  The first few scenes are kind of...well...a little disturbing.

The original ending left on a positive light.  But this was not how it was ""meant"" to end, I guess mostly because there were many unanswered questions; what happened to the other evas, what did they look like, what about Lilith, what about Adam, what happens to Seele?  So I guess that's why the ending was redone.  You do get to partially see the finished Evas, as they ominously loom over Unit 02 and Asuka, but of course, without End of Evangelion, you are left wondering ""what the hell happens next?""  You don't get to see Asuka fight unless you have End of Evangelion...so get it, otherwise it makes no sense.

This ""movie"" was really meant to replace episodes 25-26 of the original, so if you have the series and you've watched it, you'll understand why the initial ending felt as if it really didn't fit, because it didn't.  So Rebirth really just opens it back up for the ending that was initially envisioned.",1096588800,3,1408,4.633064516129032
1385525,4,B000050IL8,"Ok first off if you want the 8 disc set make sure you email the supplier first...if you are only paying $30 then you will not get the 8 disc set.  BUT HAVE NO FEAR!  I have recently purchased the 3 disc set and am 100% happy with it.  It has all the episodes that the 8 disc has it just doesn't have some of the additional extra features.

  3 disc has decent character bios, English or Japanese audio, English subtitles.

  Ok now my review of the series itself.  I won't spoil it for you...but as long as you are watching the show when they are discussing the characters and how they came to be who they are...then you can completely skip episode 25.  As far as episode 26 you can safely skip ahead a bit and still follow the story line 95%.

  26 contains a rather wierd ending, it doesn't fit either.  Of course if you get End of Evangelion, then you get to see the REAL end and the FINAL CONCLUSION!.  To ease your feelings about the end of the series...keep this in mind...is about the Angels and humanity, episodes 25-26 however only deal with Shinji's view of life, and that of the others also.

  Other than that VERY wierd ending, the rest of the series is AWESOME...little sexual jokes throughout are hilarious and to me appropriate.  They give the show the feeling of real life.  Many times they make a comment that is meant a ""certain"" way and it was EXACTLY what I would have thought of to fit that situation.  Then there are the things where the creativity of it completely blows me away!  But this is not a comedic series; the humor in it is real to the situations and VERY few are comic relief.

If you do get that ""what the hell"" feeling after watching the series, then you will want to get End of Evangelion, this movie/final episdoe contains all the answers you were looking for...with one new question.",1096243200,7,1823,4.357142857142857
1385526,5,B000050IL8,"its not secrets of the ""MAG!"" its the MAGI, if you're gonna type a summary of the dvd you should make sure you're information is correct",1096156800,,136,4.269230769230769
1385527,4,B000050IL8,"Death and Rebirth is basicly the movie version of the whole NGE series, a sort of ""quick re-run"" which was intended to be an easy way for the fans to get into the whole story line again. One could wonder how fans would forget about a serie with the impact of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Or one could also wonder what good a re-run would do while you can quickly see for yourself that details are of high importance in the whole experience (just check web forums, usenet groups, etc.). That is; if you want to dive into the story instead of focussing on action scenes. So chances are high that fans would easier grab the VHS or DVD's with the original serie to relive the moment than grab this DVD.

In this aspect I really wouldn't recommend this DVD; the 're-run' isn't going into much details, just the most important ones are included. And the story on this DVD isn't going in a very synchronized order; you basicly start with scenes from episode 24 and end with them. Not very easy for any newcomer.

However; if you are a fan of the series then its also not easy to simply ignore this DVD. Despite of the fact that in the end things are basicly a ""quick and dirty re-run"" it *does* give you some very nice extra's. For example some scenes which are viewed from a totally different perspective. Maybe not very special, but an interesting experience nevertheless where animation is concerned. And then there is the issue that some scenes are new when looking back at the original series. These scenes even got used in the Director Cut DVD's, so also not something which is easily discarded.

Naturally there are also downsides to this DVD for fans. Because they have made a whole new movie the whole voice actor cast (I'm focussing on the English voice actors) wasn't available. So some characters have completely different voices. While they managed to keep most of them decently close to the original, some are simply awfull when compared with the original serie (for example Professor Fiyutski, the voice really doesn't match the character profile at all).

So summing up I think this DVD will be best experienced by fans. Its absolutely not a substitute for the entire series and the story line is nearly impossible to follow for anyone not closely familiar with the original serie.

However, even if you are a fan I'd seriously consider if you want this DVD since it mostly focusses on summarizing the serie. The End of Evangelion might be something you're really after.",1095724800,4,2475,4.654462242562929

1385529,5,B000050IL8,"Hello.  I would like to make an observation.  When someone speaks of a TV series that confused its viewers and caused them to make threats of physical violence against the creator of the show, we naturally think of Evangelion...true.  But we must also remember the same thing happened to Patrick McGoohan when he completed his 17-episode run of The Prisoner in 1967.  I believe both shows are similar in that both creators, McGoohan and Anno, were not trying to tell a straight narrative tale, but rather were trying to create something that would cause the viewers of their respective shows to discuss what they had seen and experienced.  They used genres each was familiar with.  McGoohan used the Spy genre from his experience on ""DangerMan"" and Anno used the Mecha Anime genre.  Loving or hating their shows does not seen to matter to them, just as long as the shows bring about discussion, even heated discussion, about the themes and views presented in their shows.

So, to those reviewers who said watching Evangelion or The Prisoner was a confusing waste of time, if it got you to think about something other than downloading porn, then you just justified the existence of both shows.

After spending the money I really tried to convince my self I was enjoying the series, but I just couldn't do it. Better to get Bubblegum Crisis, even with  some faults is a much better series than this.",1093132800,5,561,4.78125
1385540,5,B000050IL8,"Ask any anime fan about their five all time favorite TV series, and Neon Genesis Evangelion will almost certainly be somewhere on the list.  It is one series that truly lives up to and deserves all of the hype surrounding it, and nearly ten years later it is still as entrancing as when it was first made.

The story centers on Shinji Ikari, a fifteen-year-old boy in the near future who lives in a world under attack by mysterious beings known as Angels.  One day, he his picked up by a woman named Misato and taken to the mysterious NERV organization, where he is asked by his estranged father to pilot a giant machine called an Evangelion.  From that point onward, Shinji becomes ever more deeply involved in a web of lies and deceit that could eventually culminate in the end of the world.

If the show sounds heady, it certainly is, which is one of the reasons why the show is so great.  It demands the audience think about what's going on, constantly providing you with new information that causes you to reevaluate everything's that gone on before.  As layer upon layer of complexity is added, the series grows ever more entrancing to the point where you simply have to see ""one more episode.""  Even better is that Evangelion proves to be a totally different experience the second time around, with previously confusing scenes suddenly making perfect sense and so many hints about the eventual plot twists you won't believe you missed them.  Better still is that the show is full of important plot points and relationships that are never overtly stated, merely implied, as if direct Hideaki Anno were leaving puzzle pieces behind for the audience to put together.

The world of Evangelion is populated with an assortment of memorable characters, and if none of them wind up being wholly likable they all end up being decidedly human.  The characters of Evangelion are flawed and simply trying to do their best in extreme situations, and if they seem annoying at times there is never a lack of justification for their actions.  Yes, I wanted to smack whining Shinji or bitchy Asuka more than a few times, but by the end of the series you come to understand these people and why they are the way they are.  In fact, to me Evangelion is actually a character study in the guise of a sci-fi epic, with the relationships between these flawed individuals proving the be the real backbone of the show.

But there are also all those mech battles and techno babble to hold your interest, and the mythology of Evangelion is one of the richest and most inventive I've seen in a mecha anime.  Like the plot and characters, not everything is directly stated, but once you piece things together everything makes perfect sense.

A note on the ending:  many a fan hates it, claiming it was a cop out on Anno's part due to lack of money.  While the show did run out of money before its finale, I find the ending to be extremely compelling and a perfect cap for this character-driven epic.  Once you get past the initial shock of the ending defying all expectations, you can begin to enjoy it on its own terms.

Neon Genesis Evangelion is a must have for any anime fan.  The show can be violent and disturbing and definitely isn't for kids, but adults and older teens will find a wealth of things to love about the show.  For making us think and messing with your head in a way few shows can, I give Evangelion five stars.  Highly recommended.",1092268800,9,3431,4.5793780687397705
1385541,5,B000050IL8,"I'm only 15, and somewhat new to anime and manga, and this was actually my first anime purchase (about a year ago, actually.) This show is not for anyone who just wants a simple giant robots smash everything, scantilly-clad large-breasted women running around everywhere, and other generally brainless and testosterone pumped anime features. (Man, that was horribly put.)

While the show does feature its huge mecha battles, that really is only the gloss on the surface. The characters are deep, each have their own history, all meshed to eachother and the plot(s). I don't want to rant on very much in this, but I have seen quite a few recommendations to ""watch the movie and skip the last two episodes.""

Well, I do recommend the movie, but I don't recommend overlooking those final episodes. While they aren't too appealing, they do answer a lot of questions, you just have to take the time to understand what is being said. Actually, I prefer the series ending to watching the movie, but many people don't, so you can't just take my word for it.

The voice acting in both the English and Japanese versions I find to be outstanding. I can't say the same for the movies however, but that's not what I'm reviewing here right?

Well, in an attempt to keep this relatively short, and yes, I'm sorry for the awful attempt at a review (I'm new to reviews, but I'm trying.) I highly recommend this series for anyone looking for an anime with a twisting plot. It's much deeper than you'll originally think it is, trust me. You may need to watch it several times to get a grasp on everything that's happening (I've watched it about 4 times over, and I'm still trying to grasp the ending.)

1385544,5,B000050IL8,"Not necessarily the most enjoyable or the best, but certainly the greatest.
I first picked this series up when I was just getting into anime. Browsing through various titles at the library, I found the first volume. It looked interesting, so I borrowed it.
Cool, interesting, but nothing special.
That's what I thought, anyways...
I was interested enough to pick up the next volume, but trailed off after that.
Months later, I stumbled upon the next tape in the series and figured, ""Eh, why not.""
I took it home and watched it, and from that moment on, I was devoted. I reserved the next volumes so that I could borrow them as soon as they arrived, sometimes on lists with over 100 people preceding me. Slowly, surely, I finished the series.
Admittedly, I was a bit irritated at the last two episodes, but that was okay, because the movie takes care of that. More on that later.
This is, in case you don't know already, the story of a future where Antarctica has been melted by a massive explosion governments claim was a meteor. I'm not sure about the rest of the world, but at least in Japan, where the story takes place (of course), there are no longer any seasons. There is only summer, with occasional rain.
Over two decades after the explosion in 2001, strange, massive aliens called Angels come down from space and attack the HQ of NERV, the organization created to battle the Angels. NERV has built a few giant robots called Evangelions, the only things capable of truly fighting the Angels. In the first episode, you see the true invulnerability of Angels to conventional weapons as one is bombarded by a barrage of missiles, bombs, and, eventually, nuclear mines.
Shinji Ikari is a boy whose mother is dead and father is distant. His father, Gendou Ikari, is the head of NERV and summons him one day to pilot an Evangelion (Eva Unit 01). From here, we meet a whole cast of deeply messed up characters:
Rei Ayanami - The mostly emotionless pilot of Unit 00. She's the blue-haired one.
Misato Katsuragi - An alcoholic and sex fiend by night, powerful commander of the Evas by day! One of the few truly good people in the series.
Ritsuko Akagi - Daughter of the designer of the MAGI, the NERV mainframe. A bit heartless and screwed up in her own way.
Asuka Langley Sohryu - An attention-grubbing, mean-spirited redhead with more than enough attitude for the whole cast. We find that she has an EXTREMELY troubled past, however...
That's just a few, but there is an immense cast of realistic characters, and the plot is insane, weaving all of their stories and motives together into one hell of a tapestry.
One tip of advice, however, before I go any further: by the sixth DVD, you should be watching the series in its original Japanese with subtitles. There is a very specific episode where the English dubbed version pales in comparison to the original haunting screams of the Japanese voice actors.
This series is not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach. It seems tame enough ""giant robot"" battle at first, but later in the series, things just keep getting darker and harsher. The characters are forced to endure horrific mental and physical tests, and there are points in the series when blood is literally gushing everywhere.
The characters are neurally connected to their Evas, and hence feel everything that happens to the Unit they are piloting. They cut neural connections or fade them to dull the pain, but this results in some pretty heavy material. I'll never forget when an Angel begins infecting an Evas arm and Ikari orders it severed. The operator insists that the neural connections need to be cut first, but he sternly tells her that they have no time. The film cuts to the Eva's shoulder as the arm blows off. You are then taken to a shot of the pilot inside, in shock and clutching at a shoulder that her mind is convinced is nothing more than a stump.
And that's minor for this show, kids!
In any case, it's very well made in terms of plot and action, and has more than its share of disturbing moments. However, the main merit of this series is its psychological aspect.
Each character, as mentioned before, has their own personal issues. There are entire ten minute spans devoted to analyzation of a character's problems, and there's such a diverse cast with such a diverse set of problems that there's no way that anyone with any issues can't relate.
This comes into play in the movie, but more on that later.
Now, about the last two episodes. Extremely controversial, simply because the people in charge of the series basically said, ""Hmmm... You know what? Viewers don't need to know how the plot turns out! Let's just look at Shinji's issues in philosophical discussion for the last two episodes!""
That's right. The plot is abandoned for the sake of some deep discussion time.
However, that's okay.
The series was intended to end with the movie, ""End of Evangelion.""
That's where the true payoff lies. However incredible the series is, the movie is exponentially greater.
But I'll save that for the movie review.",1089849600,6,5050,4.688063063063063

Pros:
-Great animation; vibrant colors and scenery
-Plot is deep and original (a big plus with me. You are literally sucked into the plot.
-Character design and look overall is great, but...
-I like to opening theme ^^ hehe
-Good voice acting
-Battle scenes are fun to watch
Cons:
-Sometimes plot is too complicated; either my mind can't comprehend some of this stuff or they really didn't explain well what was going on
-Sometimes reuse previous clips to fit in dialogue (true for eng version not sure bout jap....) This got on my nerves SO BAD at the end, cuz they pretty much used the same scene for the whole last 2 friggin episodes.
-Ending SUCKS...made me so mad that I had to rack my brain to get to this
-The characters personalities are somewhat boring. Rei with her monotone voice, shinji with his always-on-the-brink-of-insanity personality, etc.
Overall:
 I like it okay. I enjoyed it enough to say this, but not enough to declare myself obsessed with it like most people are. If you want a nice, deep story, then give this a try. If big plots scare you but you like pretty colors, this one's a maybe. Or you can just watch it under peer pressure like I did. Your choice ^_^",1089763200,3,1432,4.507692307692308

Well in my opinion, anime is not like music where you have the commercial scene and the underground scene. I highly doubt any anime gets more complex then NGE and there is no classifying this as a beginners or an advanced anime - it is something you watch if you have a deep interest in psychology, philosophy, our purpose in life, human conditions - it is about the characters and it's about mysteries, intrigues of life and consipiracies - just as much as it is about the cool giant mecha. It is more then a story - it is a work of art, a representation of Hideako Anno's troubled mind. Anyone with emotions can appreciate that there's more the NGE then just an anime. For those of you who cannot see much beyond Ninja Scroll-type hack and slash or SailorMoon-cutsie characters may be a bit frustrated with it at times, but it still offers many surprises and action for those types too. One thing's for sure - you won't ever forget NGE, and you will be left hungry trying to comprehend what you've just seen.",1085788800,7,1158,4.466981132075472
1385559,4,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is an amazing anime series. At first it may seem like just another kids mecha anime but in reality there is much more depth in the storyline than any other anime series that I have watched. As it progresses you will see there are layers upon layers of political deceit and hidden agendas. Even the true nature of the Evas, the robots piloted by the children, are not fully revealed until near the end.
Ultimately the series is actually intended to explore the very existence and meaning of life.  Many religious elements such as ""the dead sea scrolls"", Adam & Eve, the cross etc are brought into play. The creator of this series was very ambitious in what he wanted to do and like an artist that cannot get the perfect vision in his head onto canvas, he was only able to get a flawed version of his vision into this anime.
Some of the flaws are in my opinion somewhat unrealistic behaviour of some of the main characters and lack of early explanation of key elements. For example, why are certain 14 year old children the only ones that can pilot the Evas.
As many have said, this anime finishes with many loose ends. In fact the last 2 episodes are simply crudely put together slides with a vocal overdub. Although some fans claim to read a lot of meaning into these episodes, the real truth is that this ending was because they ran out of money to do it right. Anyone buying this should be warned that they will probably feel very unsatisfied with the ending. Fortunately, the last 2 episodes 25 and 26 were re-made in the DVD ""the End of Evangelion"" which will almost be a must buy if you buy this collection. However, be warned that even this remake of the ending although much better, is not completely satisfying.
Despite these flaws, Evangelion has been the most thought provoking anime I have ever watched and it begs to be watched many times as each viewing often reveals another hidden layer of meaning.  If you like thought provoking animes and can deal with lack of closure, buy it.",1085616000,6,2018,4.526027397260274
1385560,2,B000050IL8,"One of the most popular anime of all time, Neon Genesis Evangelion has a rather large fan base in the Anime Community, I personally do not like it to much, the last two episodes, a long with a few other perks like the Kawrou episode and Magma Diver were preety much it, the animation is standard. While I do not put much stock into animation, I do put a lot of stock into mech desing, of which the series is lacking really good ones, Eva 03 and 02 were the best, at least the movie had the Mp evas. Evangelion begins with a standard story, which I have no problem with, I have seen plenty of standard stories, and peopl will argue with me when I say the story is standard, how ever they give out summaries rather then stories, the Story is its the year 20something, and strange monster aliens attack tokyo and it is up to some crazy drugged out kid to stop them using a robot that for some reason only lets him pilot. I know they explain that last part latter but if I invested stock into explaining that here this would be more of a summary then a story, so thats the story, it sounds a lot like a standard Super Robot show, but in the end Evangelion is just a bad mix of an old SR show and every religous document in the world thrown together. The characters are also bad, none of them seem to have a real chemistry, Shinji is the angsty whiny teenager, Asuka is the red headed demon woman, Rei is the quiet pale type, Shinji's dad is sooo much like other ""Ahahah I am a bad dad, behold as I make you pilot this robot!"" characters its funny, none of these characters seem to mingle and get a long, because they are all closed off to interaction with other characters so they do not allow a chemistry to be made. Every one will hate me for saying this, but there are a lot better Mech animes, and a lot better ""thinker"" animes out there, pass this, and its 120 dollar price tag up.",1084320000,8,1882,4.173076923076923
1385561,4,B000050IL8,"This is the first of the two-part ending movies that are supposed to finish the complex and interesting Neon Genesis Evangelion Series. I must note before anything that this disk has TWO SIDES. If you find yourself on a side with a starting menu containing: End of Evangelion Preview, Death and Rebirth Trailers, and Magi Archives, you've found yourself into the Omega side of the disk. Unless you've watched the movie before and wish to activate the interactive extras special (you watch the movie and have options to select information when they appear), I suggest you turn over to Alpha Side.
In the first hour of this movie (Death) we recap the entire series in a way I was impressed by. Yes, I did say: ""Hey, why's this repeating the last 11-hours I've spent at my TV?"" but this is a great way to refresh yourself on the series and I quite enjoyed it. After Death ends, a 4 and a half minute Intermission is activated with a neat timer (I can only imagine how it would look on the big screen), but after we hit 0:00, it's on to Rebirth
We start out in the hospital where Shinji is visiting Asuka, currently schizophrenic and unconcious, and he desperately tries to wake her. Meanwhile, SEELE, the evil organization that rules over NERV, is angry at Commander Ikari's victory over Kaworu (yes, that's how they spelt/pronounced it in the movie), their 17th Angel/Fifth Child agent sent to initiate Third Impact and completely destroy humanity by means of the Human Instrumentality Project. So, they pull strings with the UN and JSSDF to launch a strike upon NERV HQ and Tokyo-3. This mission is very cold hearted (they kill unarmed personel, even women) and they only keep on advancing. Asuka is placed into Unit-02 and sent to the bottom of the lake for safety and Shinji is saved by Misato from termination by UN SpecOps. The movie ends with Asuka realizing her mother's spirit is protecting her from inside the EVA and is the protecting force of the AT Field. But her early destruction of the conventional UN/JSSDF forces is nothing when the NINE FULLY OPERATIONAL EVAS are dropped into the area to kill Unit-02 and Asuka as well as initiate Third Impact with Unit-01. Oh the tension rises, and my mother won't let me watch the End of Evangelion Movie becuase it's rated 17+!
All in all: Watch this, watch End of Evangelion (don't tell me about it though), and you'll mostlikely understand the entire Evangelion Series (or at least you won't be as confused). I give it 4 stars because of disk problems and the very short length of Rebirth.",1083801600,,2545,4.6703786191536745
1385562,5,B000050IL8,"I have to admit, I agree with all the people who criticize this series' philosophical pretenstions. Still, in light of what's been accomplished, it's more than forgiveable. The series isn't about giant robots. They're just sort of there, the same way it happens to be set in Japan.
Evangelion is about the incredible skill and attention that went into making it. My favorite scene in the series isn't any of the disturbing revelations near the end, like the tank full of bodies, or any of the fights, or any of the emotionally-loaded exchanges; it's Misato's promotion party in one of the early episodes. It's pure class. The dialogue is flawless. And in the episode where Asuka first appears - when Misato and the Admiral are talking on the bridge, watch Kensuke running around in the background. When most of the cast is jammed in an elevator, pause the DVD and take a look at the expression on everyone's face. Pay attention to the tempo of the dialogue. The grander aspects, also, like explosions and limbs rending, are perfectly timed and pictured. You could watch this series with the sound and subtitles turned completley off and it would still be an edifying experience.
Also the characters. It's difficult to believe that a single person as convincing and interesting as Misato could have been the result of so many different minds; the series creator, the character design guy, the animator, and the voice actor. What you have here is four or more minds working in perfect synchrony. It's more convicing than live action somehow, at times.
This is one of those works of art that makes any discussion of medium or genre ridiculous; it's just pure art. No home should be without it.",1083715200,2,1690,4.810996563573883
1385563,5,B000050IL8,"In this second part of the eight DVD collection, we get a little closer to Rei, to say a LOT closer. One reason why I can pity Shinji so much (unlike other anime characters) is that he tries to do good but ends up messing everying up. In this volume, we have Shinji try to bring Rei her new ID card. He ends up walking into her house, uninvited, into her room (where we see freaky looking bloodstained clothes and pillows), and picks up a pair of glasses we've been told were Commander Ikari's. Rei walks in, Shinji turns and sees she just got out of a shower, she walks over, takes the glasses, Shinji slips on the water, falls onto Rei, drawers go flying, and before we know it, he on top of her and her towel's completely off.
This scene has a very artful way of covering nudity with objects (...).
The next on the list of people who are introduced is Asuka Langley Sohryu, the Second Child and pilot of the German-made Unit-02. She's a real sassy girl, when Toji is crawling on the floor to retrieve his wind-taken hat on the aircraft carrier they meet her on, she steps on it. A gust of wind blows up her skirt (...) and Toji gets smacked.
I don't like revealing TOO much of the story but like my others, I give an overview of the episode, a review, and a closing overall statement.
This is the next chapter and still as good as the first, yet better. The series doesn't really reach the full swing of tension, drama, and action until around Neon Genesis Evangelion 0:5 Inner Sanctums. But that doesn't mean just give up now! Keep watching if you like it!
Overall: I love the DVD, the extras (like all the other DVDs) really are bone-dry (only a few previews but some are good ie: Gasaraki, Spraggain, Samurai X The Movie, etc), but overall, if you just want the episodes, you've got the right DVD!",1083369600,2,1803,4.337278106508876
1385564,5,B000050IL8,"For the record, I am not a huge fan of Anime. Maybe I am looking in the wrong places, but everytime I start to watch a series it ends up as mindless action or mindless comedy. I've only seen 2 that can truly be called intellectual. Serial Experiment: Lain was one. Neon Genesis Evangelion is the other.
I cannot say enough good about this series. It it quite simply the best piece of work to ever have been broadcast. Anywhere. Nothing to come out of America, nothing to come out of Japan, nothing anywhere can meet the sheer brilliance of the 26 episodes of this most disturbing, heartwarming, and beautiful anime.
Evangelion starts out simply enough. Ikari Shinji is a 14-year old boy who gets called upon to pilot a giant mecha, called an Evangelion. He, Rei, and Asuka are the three children that have the ability to pilot these machines. Simple enough, right? The first 3/4's of the series deals with the relationship between these 3 and the various leaders of NERV, the organization they work with. It is highly entertaining, beautifully drawn, and very engaging. Alot of the middle episodes are very light hearted, and nothing too fantastic, but enjoyable in their own right.
It is in the last quater of the series that it becomes brilliant. Shinji, Asuka, Rei, and Misato (one of the leaders of NERV) become very introspective. By this point their back stories and personalities are developed beyond any rational expectation. I don't want to spoil the moving experience of this anime, but let me just say that it is incredibly philosophical, psychological, and depressing.
Oh, and for the love of all that is holy, DO NOT listen to anyone who tells you not to watch the last 2 episodes. They are, simply put, fools. The last 2 episodes are jarring, disturbing and very hard to watch. They do not give perfect closer to the whole series (don't worry Plot [enthusiasts], End of Evangelion, due out in September ties up all the loose ends). But they made the series for me. You have to see it to believe it and I am not going to spoil it by saying anything more. Just trust that it is simply breathtaking...",1081728000,5,2112,4.649732620320855
1385565,2,B000050IL8,"The story is ok(when compared to other great anime like ""cowboy beebop"") and so is the little action scenes they do have(which is only 10% of the sereis). But character personalites and dialoge scenes (which constitutes 90% of the sereis) are so BORRING and repetative. they keep asking the same melow dramatic question answeard with the same melow dramatic, cheesy lines. THE FIRST FOUR DVD'S OF THE SERIES WERE UTERLY BORRING AND USELESS, ID NEVER WATCH THEM EVER AGAIN! the animation is pretty WEAK except for the actions scenes which are rare.

1385566,2,B000050IL8,"One of the most popular anime of all time, Neon Genesis Evangelion has a rather large fan base in the Anime Community, I personally do not like it to much, the last two episodes, a long with a few other perks like the Kawrou episode and Magma Diver were preety much it, the animation is standard. While I do not put much stock into animation, I do put a lot of stock into mech desing, of which the series is lacking really good ones, Eva 03 and 02 were the best, at least the movie had the Mp evas. Evangelion begins with a standard story, which I have no problem with, I have seen plenty of standard stories, and peopl will argue with me when I say the story is standard, how ever they give out summaries rather then stories, the Story is its the year 20something, and strange monster aliens attack tokyo and it is up to some crazy drugged out kid to stop them using a robot that for some reason only lets him pilot. I know they explain that last part latter but if I invested stock into explaining that here this would be more of a summary then a story, so thats the story, it sounds a lot like a standard Super Robot show, but in the end Evangelion is just a bad mix of an old SR show and every religous document in the world thrown together.

1385567,3,B000050IL8,"The Death and Rebirth is kind of an odd recommendation. The cover and the little that I knew about it was misleading.
The first part of the DVD is Death or basically a recap of the show. It tells the basic events of what happens to each character through the first 24 episodes of the original series. The flashback clips are done up in a nice interesting way as each child tries out for an orchestra. As they play their instruments the memories come flooding. It's a fun interesting way to remember all the things that happened through out the series. But if you are buying this then you probably already have the first eight DVDs and probably don't need much of in the way of a refresher course.
The second part or Rebirth is the new content for this disc. Rebirth however is the very beginning of the end of Evangelion, which is included in said End of Eva. Since you are going to have to get that one too to get the full ending a lot of people I know probably want to bypass this DVD altogether.
The extras are nice a few designed to get newcomers up to speed with what happened earlier. And I liked the audio commentary, something for some reason lacking in a lot of Anime.
Death And Rebirth is really only for two groups of people. Those who haven't seen the original episodes in awhile and needed a refresher course, and those who are Eva fanatics and snatch up pretty much everything they can find. I was kind of in both these groups so D and R worked well for me for what it was. Newbies to the series will find just way too much info to absorb in the short amount of time, and others will probably feel gypped for getting this and End of Eva.",1080518400,2,1651,4.261146496815287
1385598,5,B000050IL8,"Evangelion is my personal favorite anime series of all time. It's a deep series that combines action, drama, and a healthy dose of comedy ( penpen :D ). Giant mecha called the evangelions are piloted by 3 young teenagers fight the angels - giant lifeforms that seek to destroy humanity ( in a short non-storyline revealing manner of speaking ). If you haven't seen it, buy it, or see it with a friend and then buy it. It's good.",1079481600,,428,4.430379746835443
1385599,4,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is probably one of the best anime series out there.  An incredibly complex storyline and superbly developed characters get you much more involved with this show than with many other anime series around.  I gave the DVD set a 4/5 Stars because of the technical issues and lack of any real amount of extras included in the package.  While these were dissapointments, the show itself is more than worth the money you'll spend to get the box.
  One word of warning however, if you don't like to think when you're watching a show, i.e. you think Dragonaball Z or Yu-Gi-Oh will always be the pinnacle of anime excellence, this show probably isn't for you, but if you're looking for something that will actually get you're brain working and actually make you notice how much can be done in 26 episodes, this is definitely where you'll find it.
  On a side note, try checking out the fanfiction communtiy for Evangelion.  Since it hasn't yet (and hopefully won't) been aired on Cartoon Network, the Fanfiction.net's archive hasn't yet been watered down with terrible fics.",1079481600,,1088,4.8432432432432435
1385600,5,B000050IL8,"I missed the entire TV broadcast of this series and the debate that ensued mainly because I was in the United States during that time period. When I came back to Japan in the spring of 1999, Neon Genesis Evangelion was already a thing of the past, and everyone was talking about the Princess Mononoke by Miyazaki Hayao.
 I have just recently seen the entire series and the two theater versions and now wish that I had seen them all much earlier. As is often pinted out, this series is rather wretched largely due to the puzzling last two episodes, and I frankly do not care so much for all the psuedo-Christian icons that the work carries with it. What is of greater importance is that this series seems to delve into the ever-pervasive sense of insecurity and nihilism lurking underneath the subconsious of modern man. I also belive that this only could have come out in the aftermath of the mayhem caused by the Kobe Great Earthquake and the Tokyo subway gas attack perpetrated by the Aum Doomsday Cult.
 One thing that striks me is the lifelessness of the futuristic Tokyo, the home of NERV. It is a fortress replete with all the defence mechanism. An evacuation order is issued everytime an Angel comes to attack the city, but not a soul is seen to be running on the street or anything. And then it is this series of Angels that puzzle the viewers. We are never told where they are actually coming from; they just show up out of nowhere only to be annihilated by the Evas and NERV. It is not until after the twentieth episode or so that we learn that those Angels are actually the externalized forms of the fear and insecurity that the NERV personnel carry deep inside themselves as the traumatic past that each one of them has becomes gradually apparent.
 And of course the series abounds in various feminine symbols, the Evas themselves being female figures with the umbilical cable and whatnot. It is in this context that Rei Ayanami plays a pivotal role as she shows up in numerous guises: as a mother before Shinji; as an direct antithesis before Asuka; as a wife-daughter figure before Gendo Ikari; and as an archrival before Ritsuko and her mother.
 All in all, this is an anime that ends all other animes as there is so much in it that goes against the traditional notion of what the anime should be like. Although I am relatively a newcomer to this series, I must admit that watching the whole series was a deeply moving experience. And I urge you all to see it as Neon Genesis Evangelion has definitely something important to tell us.",1078963200,22,2548,4.544662309368192
1385601,3,B000050IL8,"With ""Evangelion"", anime fans seem to be split into two camps--those who really, really like it, and those who don't.  (An apparently small but occasionally vocal minority.)  Many of the reviews here (I can't say most, since frankly I haven't read all 228 evaluations of this item) seem to be from the former group.  I'm here to present a dissenting, though hopefully level-headed, opinion.
The series starts out with a lot of promise.  A potentially very interesting plot and cast of characters, boosted by some very intriguing foreshadowing.  Unfortnately, this holding of the proverbial carrot in front of viewers' noses goes on for the entire first half of the series, with far more questions than answers being dispensed.  In the second half of the series, the story itself begins to short-circuit--ANNO Hideaki, the director, wrote this more or less as it came to him, and it shows in the way that the actual plot never quite comes together.  (The last time I watched this series, I tried very, very hard to make sense of all the divergent plot points we're given, and although in several episodes everything comes really close to making complete sense, it ultimately dissolves again each time.  The only thought I have on this is that Anno himself didn't really know what was going on while he created the series, and it hurt the plot badly.)
While the comprehensibility quotient of the story goes down during the series' second half, the strange symbolism quotient rockets up, compounding the issue severely.  This is really the deciding factor:  many fans seem to love the apparently random barrage of symbolism (which in an interview, Tsurumaki, the co-director, admitted was largely a meaningless lark), and mind-boggling amounts of literature has been written about this show.  (It also plays this symbolism very straight and serious, which makes occasionally feels odd.)  If you're the kind of person who is okay with that, or even enjoys it, then by all means, buy this show.  If you're like me--someone who doesn't really appreciate symbolism where the creators didn't seem to have any intentions at all and it's up to viewer to impart any meaning at all to it--you may want to be careful.
As an aside, I also don't feel that the characters are advanced at all over the course of the series.  I think the manga remedies this immensely and recommend trying Sadamoto Yoshiyuki's ambitious reinterpretation of the series even if you didn't like the show.  That said, Eva is also home to some very impressive mecha battles--the climax of episode 24 is, in my opinion, one of the most thrilling battle sequences to come along in quite a while.
Nonetheless, I urge everyone to see this show at least once, whether you buy it or borrow it from a friend.  Why?  Well, whatever you or I may think of ""Evangelion"", it is inarguably one of the most influential anime shows of its era--I can't bring to mind another series that has been more widely or more passionately discussed and debated by this generation of fans.  If you are an anime enthusiast, it beehoves you to see this show if for no reason other than to know what people are talking about with it and so you can know where you stand when the issue comes up.
I'm hard-pressed to say that ""Evangelion"" is an unequivocally bad show, because it does have good points.  But amidst all the fan-love usually directed at this series, newcomers may want to take it with a grain of salt.",1078012800,24,3443,4.795262267343485

1385603,5,B000050IL8,"This is not a show about the Massive monsters (called Angels) that come to town and the giant robots that fight them. Those things are simply the backdrops. The fight scenes are glorious to see and take up a large portion of each episode, But Ultimately this is a show about the three young pilots who defeat the Angels and how emotionally fragile and broken they are.
The story starts off simple. A young boy named Shinji is tapped by his estranged father to become a pilot for an Eva. Shinji eventually settles into this routine with the other two pilots A quiet sometimes eerie girl named Rei, And a fiery egotistical girl name Asuka. The young pilots try to lead a semi-normal life while saving the world. However at some point the story spins off into wildly confusing directions.
Every character in the show is dealing with their past and emotional demons. It's very interesting to learn what makes all these people tick. You do have to work a bit to see the core of all the characters since many would be much happier to simply crawl into a dark cave and hide crying then to really deal with what is going on around them. Shinji the main character spends a lot of time unhappy and does complain a lot.
The Angel battles are very well thought out with some great effects. Each of the angels attack in a different fashion so all the battles are unique. And the battle music is some of the best I have every heard. The music falls sometimes on the dramatic Armageddon variety, but sometimes switches towards a classical vein or even a hymn that works beautifully.
There's a good deal of mythology and symbolism that at times is really obscure and hard to understand. References are drawn from Judeo-Christian beliefs but even delve in to the realms of psychology and philosophy. Some of the symbolism may be offensive to some and confusing to others, but I really enjoyed a lot of the references. I didn't understand them as I saw them but after hours scouring the Internet for explanations to a lot of the imagery the answers and explanations made me appreciate just how deep and complex this show is.
Evangelion is eight years old but the show has held up reasonable well through out the years. At times I was bothered by the softness of colors but nothing major to detract from the overall enjoyment.
A couple other points worth mentioning though is the final two episodes. While I won't give any spoilers it's actually because there aren't any to give. The last episodes buck the story completely to present more of a psychological portrayal of inside of the character's minds. The back cover of the DVD calls the ending controversial but I'm guessing it's because a lot of people hated it. I really liked the last two episodes and thought they made a lot of good points about how we can live our lives better. But my perspective was that as soon as I finished those two final episodes I had the special ending movies that were recently released to find out what happened. If I had to be content with a philosophical essay as the ending for a few years I might have been a little pissed too.
The other point is the special ending movies. The movies while I guess a fitting end take the story too some truly psychotic and sick places. And in the end open up some new questions that I'm guessing may never be truly answered.
I love so much about the Evangelion series that it stands as one of my favorite pieces of work. The story is an elusive puzzle that isn't for everyone, and as much as we hypotheses few will ever truly understand its nuances. But Evangelion does get under your skin and make you think. And I believe it's worthy of the controversy and fame it has received",1077667200,,3685,4.517964071856287
1385604,5,B000050IL8,"It's difficult to describe Evangelion. There's much to be praised, much to be explained, and much left to the imagination. Now, I read reviews and see how people claim that this series lacked too much to be considered a classic, how the characters were too flawed, and how the story itself was too confusing and difficult to follow. Let me clarify a few of these misconceptions; 1) Evangelion is one of the greatest series ever created, whether or not it lacked the mindless action you craved. If that really is the case, go back to DBZ. 2) The characters were not flawed, they were unique. So Shinji was a whiner? So Asuka was a brat? So Misato was slightly irresponsible? So what? The characters personality broke free from the shackles of your conventional anime (1 main charcter who was perfect in every aspect). What you call flaws, I call realism, because the truth is, nobody's perfect. 3) The story wasn't supposed to be some repetitive drek that could be resolved in 2 episodes. The story had enough allusion to make it throughly complex. Sorry that you had to think when you watch TV, but God knows you probably don't do it enough anyway. Now, I can understand some people being displeased with the comic relief, but in this kind of story, it's neccesary so that the viewer doesn't lose themself in depression or thought. You see, the series is not your typical anime where there's happiness and flowers and sunshine and skipping and the whole world joining hands in song. The series is a dark epic into both the relationship between man and God and the interior of the human personality itself. The character development is superbly done in Shinji, and Asuka's is done well also, even though her development is rather negative. There is a very good amount of action in this series, but be warned: there is much blood, and some of the scenes can be disturbing depending on your constitution. The artwork is very nice (at least until the later episodes when Gainax's budget was cut. The animation is still good, but there is a slightly noticable decline in quality to the trained eye). The story is well done, though I would have preferred the series to go on longer,  because not only were there a couple unresolved conflicts, but the Human Instrumentality Project could have used a bit more explaining. The music was excellent as well, especially the opening theme (A Cruel Angel's Bloody Thesis). If your looking for a dark, well done robot anime with a perplexing plot that makes you think, then Evangelion is for you! But if your not in to something so depressing, I recommend two other nearly perfect giant robot animes: Gundam Wing and Escaflowne.",1077580800,2,2663,4.739224137931035

1385616,5,B000050IL8,"I once and a while watch some old animes. I got this series a while ago and waited long times before getting each dvd. Once I finished the series I realized that I was watching a truly breath-taking expeirience.
We see Shinji's slow decline downwards, and his relationships. He gets to the point of insanity. There are a lot of tragic moments though. The series is all dramatic. Think about it. The best thing about the series in my opinion are the battles. There are a few battles in the series that are spectacular. DVD 6 is really awesome. Throughout the series you learn more about nerve, and the people.
You will probably become emotionally attatched to everyone. I did. Misato and Kaji walking down a street. That was kind of a sad speech ;however, the series, to me, is uplifting in the end.
Now, the only problem is the fact that the end becomes gibberish. The last DVD is pure nonsence. There are few new clips of animation, and Shinji starts to whine, a lot. A movie was created but it didn't actually provide an end(Death and Rebirth). Then the End of Evangelion was made. Shinji, Masato, Asuka, and Rei all had their stories cleared up. Gainax fixed the problem. Wait, they didn't. The end is once again retarded. It is a ""make your own conclusions!"" ending. Those are stupid because they don't even tell you what happens.
Now, I watched the series in Japanese. The English though is kind of bad on this anime. It is bad in some animes, but it is almost horrendous on here. Who casted Shinji? Did the dude in charge give it to his 10 year old son?
Good stuff though. Sad in the end, but good stuff.
Also, there are no real good features on any of the DVDs. You can buy them all seperate but on here you get a deal.",1074643200,,1726,4.396875
1385617,5,B000050IL8,"Eva is supposedly this milestone in dramatic anime. And anyone watching it cannot argue that it is reasonably well animated, full of intriguing characters and melodrama that is placed in a setting so bizarre that you can't help but be interested.
At a glance, however, this series is really mecha-blandness.
Just as truly, though, to glance at this series is like to buy one grape... completely and utterly impractical. This show demands your time! Here's how I recommend going about this show.
1) Watch it once, and try to understand it as best you can.
2) Obtain the two alternate movies. Watch them.
3) Take a breather, and think! A lot!
4) Watch it again, you'll absorb and comprehend a lot more.
5) To fully understand this show, go online and find a good website that has Stephen Chung's essays relating this show to the Kaballah, a mystical aspect of Judaism. I won't give away too much, but you'll soon see the incredible amount of research that went into this show. The abstract personalities of all the characters will be explained. Also, you may realize just how the events in the show are meaningful, such as how Rei and some other characters does in fact free herself from the binding human condition.
In short, do not watch this show if you're a casual viewer.
Also, what I personally loved most is just how INTENSE this series is... so intense that when I heard one of the songs from End of Evangelion on a CD, I felt this wrenching in my stomach. This show is so extremely emotional, and all the characters so real and all so tragically flawed... absolutely beautiful.",1073001600,3,1584,4.660714285714286
1385618,5,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangleion is a benchmark in the history of animation, not because of the style or rate of animation(which is artful), but because of the story and characters. Hideaki Anno questions God, the afterlife and the human psyche in this series set in an apocalyptic 2015. The Series is basically about the end of the world, with constant biblical references mostly from revelations with references to judgement day.
However, Evangelions true brilliance is not in its apocalyptic world, biblical worth or giant robot designs and architecture. Evangelion really comes into its own through it's excellently realized characters. The series explores all of its characters secrets and desires through subtext and monologues toward the end. The characters are explored so well in the series that you know why they act and do the things they do, even when they do not. All the characters are brilliantly flawed and explores the pain of adolesence, depression and love.
The DVD features aren't that great but the series alone is easily worth the price. If you want interesting dialogue, designs, characters and are interested in filmaking at all, evangelion is one to see (just bear with the giant robots).",1072483200,,1204,5.1479591836734695

  After I completed this series, I asked myself what I just watched.  It has promising characters, but they all seem phychologically insane.  Buy the two movies that follow these.  The last movie doesn't help you understand the series, but it does offer one sl=mall explanation for one factor in the story.
  In essence, if you want a series that is big on story, DO NOT buy this.  If you are a psychologists in training,buy this.",1072396800,11,703,4.492063492063492
1385620,5,B000050IL8,"My favorite RPG is Xenogears, and when I saw NGEvangelion, I was amazed! I couldn't beleive there was an anime that even compared to Xenogears. The plot twists, the hidden agendas, the much needed religious knowledge, amazing characters and perfect balance between comedy, action, drama and mystery, Neon Genesis Evangelion is a masterpiece, and resembles Xenogears a lot! The mech battles may be short, but are a pleasure to watch, using originality and clever plans to complete succesfully each mission. The animation is nothing but great, and the soundtrack never fails to impress me. The plot is one of the best I've ever seen, and the characters are all developed well, giving us the character's views of themselves and of others, and how others think of them and also the extremly cool plot-twits. I've watched it a total of six times now, and not one episode has bored me. Also, this box set has been dubbed in english, french and spanish, and of course it has the original japanese with subtitles, giving it more value and more people can understand this masterpiece. It is best to be watched on original japanese with subs, because it has the emotional impact on the voices better done than in the dubbings. I'd recommend watching the movies also, to complemet and understand the series better. Many people argue about the last two episodes, I think they were very well done. They make you think about life like you haven't ever. The thing is that you need to think those two episodes aren't the ending of the series, consider the movies to be the ""true"" ending, and you'll have a much better understanding and enjoyment of this unique, special and amazing anime masterpiece. Thanks to Anno-sama for doing this, and I can't wait for the live-action movie. If you liked Xenogears (but make sure you finish it completely, and I'm NOT talking about that failure Xenosaga) I guarantee you'll like Neon Genesis Evangelion, and if you liked Evangelion and haven't played(can't even imagine why) Xenogears, I'd reccomend playing it, the best RPG created.

1385621,2,B000050IL8,"OK, before I start, let me just say that I thoroughly enjoyed Evangelion. I fell in love with its mech action and dramatic character development.
But I have to draw the line somewhere.
This DVD was a waste of time. It simply consisted of a lame recap of the original series with the first half of EoE tacked on the end. In other words, it serves no purpose. If you have the complete series and EoE (the ""real"" ending), then you might as well set flame to $30 if you plan on purchasing this little farce.
And that's why I disliked D&R so much; I loved the Eva series. In fact, I even liked the original ending! But this DVD was a huge dissapointment. It's an obvious insult to the fans... just more filler for the sake of profit.
However, it does have a few redeeming features. If you're one of those anime elitist types that wants to know a little about Eva without buying the entire series, you will enjoy the story summation at the beginning of D&R. Also, to spite all of my gripes with the ""movie,"" it's a must-have for all you Eva fanboys out there.

1385622,5,B000050IL8,"I can't begin to say how much I regret the fact that my opinion is ultimately biased, how I'd love to review this series objectively, observing what it is for its faults and strong point, but I can't anymore.  It's something that's important to me on a level that's deeper than mere objective observation.  ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" is... well... it's my favorite piece of art (and I use art in the most general way possible) to ever enter my line of sight.  I can hardly explain why, but I shall attempt to through this review (which is, truly, less of a review, and more of a great paragraph of admiration).
""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" is a chronicle of life slowly descending into unfathomable waters.  It's also an anime, with giant robots and lots of explosions.  Herein lies the genius the animation studio GAINAX imbedded within the series.  At first, you may think, ""Wow... what a nicely animated series.  Ah, it's a mecha-anime.  I bet it'll play out like Gundam, as they all do.""  Halfway through the series, what you thought (or what you didn't think) isn't reality at all.  What you thought was an entertaining mecha-anime is actually a terribly serious dissertation on the boundaries between attempts at human communication.  And it's nothing like you've ever seen before.
The story goes as such: Around the year 2000, a gigantic meteorite supposedly met with the South Pole, causing half the human population to suddenly die off.  This event is called the Second Impact.  15 years later, we are presented with the character of Shinji Ikari, a fourteen-year old who is seriously disenfranchised with his father (and vice versa).  Of course, he's forced to reunite with the said father in an attempt to prevent a Second Impact from ever happening again.  This time the threat is on the part of the Angels, who, for some unknown reason, are attacking Tokyo-3.  The best defense against these Angels lies within the Evangelion, which Shinji must pilot, whether or not he's happy in doing so.
Of course, he's not happy while he's piloting the Eva, and his attitude pretty much sets the course for the entirety of the 26 episodes.  Most people (that I've asked at least) would consider Shinji both whiny and pathetic.  I do as well, but this is merely a defense mechanism of mine, for I see a great deal of myself within the character of Shinji.  I see exactly where he fails, and I cannot deny that.  And perhaps that is why this series is so precious to me.
The final two episodes are only controversial because they reject all expectations.  If I were a prospective viewer wishing to purchase this series, I would ignore the detrimental statements concerning these episodes, for, it being 6 years since the series was first aired, it has come to the attention of many that these episodes are, in fact, BRILLIANT.  It is only a matter of opinion.  I'll warn you, though, that if you find no satisfaction in the series ending, you'll find even less satisfaction in the movie ""End of Evangelion.""
Watching ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" in sequence is like pulling mass amounts of masking tape off your arm.  At first, you look at the tape on your arm and think nothing of it.  When you begin to pull it off to see beyond the surface, however, you find it is much more painful and deep than you first perceived.  All cliches are presented and then ripped to shreds.  This is the essence of the series.  And this is why I love ""Evangelion.""  It is more than a 26-episode fling on television.  It has amazing personal meaning as well as complex outward meaning.
And it continues to be the most accomplished art-piece I've ever seen in my life.",1071446400,,3642,4.707740916271722
1385623,5,B000050IL8,"Anime is over and under exploited at times for what it truly is. Some is not worth being even downloaded and keeping space on your computer, and others are worth spending almost $200 to own it and watch it at your own pleasure. Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the series that you would go and pay the $200 to own, and doing whatever it takes to get you there. Highly controversial, deep and imaginative, Evangelion has been in high regard since its release to the world. Anime fans and non-anime fans alike rejoice in the philosophical rupture that is Evangelion.
Shinji Ikari is a teenager, fourteen years old, and has felt the pain of almost being an orphan: his mother is dead, and his father has almost no communication with him, nor wants any. Shinji knows nothing of his father's work or why his father never wants to see him or fulfill his role as a father. All of that changes when Shinji recieves a retreaval letter from his father to visit his secret organization. Shock and bewilderment and are widly felt as Shinji reluctantly awaits his escort to meet his father. Explosions are heard like thunder, and none to soon, the infamous Misato Katsuragi shows up in her car to take Shinji to his father, where he awaits whatever life (and Misato!) has to throw at him...
Taking you from the slums of Tokyo 3 to the technologically-advanced geo-front, Neon Genesis Evangelion shows you the greatness and weakness of mankind. Introducing you to rememberable characters such as Rei Ayanami, Ritsuko Akagi, and the firy female whose personality matches the fire-red of her hair, Asuka Langley Souryu, this ground-breaking anime is sure to be a thrill to anyone who has the passion to ponder further on the human race. What is NERV, and what connection does it have to the Angels? What are the Angels, and what do they want with earth? and what are Evangelions, exactly? All of these questions and more will be answered as you are glued to your seat, watching episode after episode as the series unfolds to an unforgettable and almost disturbing climax. Neon Genesis Evangelion will not let anyone down!",1070928000,,2106,4.741144414168938
1385624,2,B000050IL8,"Started off great, finished up with lots of still-shot anime (did the budget run low?).  The final episodes were horrible!",1070668800,3,122,5.1
1385635,5,B000050IL8,"I don't watch much in the way of anime. A friend who's currently in animation school and shares my affinity for science fiction introduced me to it. Since then, I have discovered many, many different anime movies and series that disgust or annoy me, and a few that I find genuinely enjoyable as well-executed sci-fi and fantasy. Things like Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Gundam, and the oft-maligned Record of Lodoss War.
Evangelion, however, is something entirely different.
To summarize the plot, 15-year-old Shinji Ikari shares his birthyear with the apocolyptic meteor strike known as the Second Impact, a cataclysm which killed half of Earth's population. Shinji's mother is dead and his father abandoned him for his work as a scientist when Shinji was a small child. The hapless boy lives with his schoolteacher until his native city of Tokyo-3 comes under attack from an hostile alian known only as an ""Angel."" Shinji is conscripted as a pilot for the mysterious bio-mechanical weapon system known as the Evangelion - a weapon built in secrecy by NERV, a UN subcommittee commanded by Shinji's estranged father.
Over the course of the series, Shinji, his fellow Eva pilots Rei Ayanami and Asuka Langley-Soryu, NERV operations director Misato Katsuragi, and Japanese intelligence agent Ryoji Kaji all find themselves enmeshed in the shadowy machinations of NERV and discover shocking secrets about the Evangelions, the Angels, Second Impact, and humanity itself?
Sound grandiose? That's because it is. While a bit convoluted, the story is handled with remarkable tactfulness. While some have criticized its occasionally uneven pacing, I find that it works well. The plot is initially doled out in small but important chunks shrouded in wacky anime-isms. However, by its halway point, the series has gradually and seamlessly metamorphosed into something much more serious and dark (there's also some more odd Judeo-Christian iconography used to add a veneer of mysticism to the Japanese audience, similar to uses of Eastern religion in the American media). The plot gradually increases in both scope and complexity at a greater and greater rate, rather akin to a musical crescendo.
In my opinion, the understated ending makes a brilliant finale, much like a soft and beautiful string coda after a thundering symphony. The plot itself reaches its inevitable breaking point - a major event occurs, and its largely metaphysical effects are explored throught the viewpoints of the main characters. This is simply the natural next step of the series' constant focus on character development and substitutes for now-irrelevent literal plot treatment; all relevent elements of the plot are still within easy reach as subtext and inferences.
The movies based upon this series merely elucidate upon the same themes found in the final episodes with a literal representation that similarly evaporates about halfway in. The abstractions aren't as coherent as those found in the television ending, and the religious imagery is even more random and nonsensical. In my opinion, this boxed set is all that you need.",1070409600,2,3095,5.279918864097363
1385636,5,B000050IL8,"This is more a review OF the reviews for this series. It is an excellent series, with lifelike and personally deep characters, which you will either love or hate. The thing is, the story just plays out, and does not attempt to explain itself to the watcher. You're SUPPOSED to watch the ending and go ""What?"". You have to watch it and then THINK about it. Yes. THINK. Something anime series rarely call for you to do. Admittably, the last two episdoes suck because the TV nets told the makers to end it. now. End of Eva  was planned all along and is simply released separately because there's no other way to do it. It is most useful if you see the last two eps and EoE as an internal and external telling out of the same events.",1069718400,,729,4.282608695652174
1385637,2,B000050IL8,"This is wildly overrated.  Other people have said that the last disc of the series resolved nothing.  This shouldn't have come as much of a surprise to them -- it wasn't until the end of disc 4 that there was actually a tangible plot, and that plot wasn't developed further until disc 7.  By this time, they've changed half of their world-building to fit their evolving philosophical exploration (which never gets beyond the middle-school characters).  And after all of this, they've got several sequences where they leave the viewers staring at the same cel and listening to script plod slowly along.
Neon Genesis Evangelion, like the Matrix trilogy, isn't abominable -- but I wouldn't do it again, and can't therefore recommend that other people spend money to watch it for themselves.
If you want incomprehensible philosophizing, watch Lain -- it's more interesting.
If you want philosophizing dramatic action, watch Trigun -- it's much more powerful.
If you want useful existentialism, watch Slayers Next -- it's infinitely more enjoyable.",1068940800,13,1043,5.190476190476191

Its not awful, and its not god's gift to man, that would be me!
Theres alot of potential for a truly brilliant piece of art here, but i think laziness and reality set in at some point and things didn't go quite as planned.
1st major complaint is that the series isn't particularly well put together, it seems like its made by 3 different creative minds, which would be fine but the pieces don't tie together as acts of an overall story line even. for about the first 10-15 episodes plot development is a little on the infantile side, the creators seem much more facinated with showing how cool Evas destroying strange looking angels can be, then The plot develops.  Theres tons of political intrigue, philisophical and religious overtones, and the ground work for some very deep character interaction and relationships.  But all this is abandoned for the final 2 episodes of mindless philosophical rambling.
now i know this will get me in troule but let me explain why the last 2 episodes destroy the entire series.  1st off they threw away all plot and character development to focus on shinji's mental problems.  2nd Beating people over the head with your philosophical ramblings is not good art.  this is why the 2nd matrix film failed.  To subtly and with in the confines of the plot adress philisophical issues is all well and good and an important facet of most art, but to just have characters ramble on the nature of man while flashing abstract images for an hour is not entertainment it pretentious
I think that this could have been briliant but poor execution prevented it, and its a shame, but its not the worst thing ever, and its not the greatest anime ever... im not sure what that would be but this is not it",1067731200,7,1811,4.591331269349845

You will find religious references, sexual references and finally the development of the human soul.  Another important aspect of the story is the continous references to the psycoanalysis.  Hideaki Anno is an excelent anime creator and this is his masterpiece.  When you buy it remember there is a lot of heart, hatred, love, character development and a lot of story for those not afraid to think of the possibilities.",1066953600,,732,5.041666666666667
1385641,4,B000050IL8,"From the first time I saw this series on TV I loved it. I was to young at the time to get all the philosophical connotations. Now that I have watched it again, I understand a lot more.
  There are so many reasons to love this series. Interesting and deep characters, that are thoroughly developed and explored through the series, philosophical thoughts about life death and the future of humankind, interspaced with some exciting fight sequences. The story also alludes to aspects of religion and mythology that makes the viewer compelled to find out more. What is frustrating is that not all of these questions are answered in the series.
  Lovers of the series should watch ""The End of Evangellion"" just for the sake of seeing how it ends and to clear up some of the questions that the series leaves you with, even though it is a bit harrowing watching it and it spawns even more questions.
  Watch this series. It's well worth the confusion",1066867200,,943,4.650602409638554
1385642,2,B000050IL8,"There is only one reason to watch this movie: there are maybe 2 minutes worth of cut scenes that you CANNOT watch anywhere eles scattered throughout the ""Death"" segment of the film that take place within the T.V. series. The rest of the movie is scattered scenes from the T.V. series, (the ""Death"" segment) and the first 26 minutes of ""End Of Evangelion"" (the ""Rebirth"" segment).
The scenes that can only be found on ""Death & Rebirth"" are: Asuka talking to Kaji just before we meet them for the first time in the series, Shinji playing the string quartet at school and later being joined by the other three children who pilot the Evas (including Shinji's guy friend, whose name I have forgotten, as it's been quite some time since I watched the series, who pilots the fourth Eva only once when it is possessed by an angle and must be destroyed,) and they come in one at a time and play violins, and there is minimal dialoge spoken by Shinji and Asuka. Then there is Kaji's death scene. Actually we don't exactly see him die. He is shown standing outside by a huge fan, and then he looks at us and says,""You're late."" We don't see who comes to meet him. Fade to black, and in the English version we hear him shot, and then Shinji tells Asuka Kaji is dead. In the Japanese version we hear him slapped, and then Shinji tells Asuka Kaji is gone. This to me would seem to suggest that Kaji met Misato one last time, and then she slaps him and he leaves for good, while in the English version he meets an undercover contact who kills him. In both versions we then see Asuka call Shinji a liar.
These scenes are the only reason to buy the VHS version of this film, and that's only depending on how badly you want to see the few minutes of new footage you can't see anywhere eles, and only if you don't have a DVD player. Rent it if you can find it at any video store, unless they don't have the language version of your choice. On the DVD there is a commentary option where you can listen to the thoughts of Amanda Winn, English voice actor of Rei, and two other guys who worked on it. The commentary is insightful and funny, (they apologize for using levity and say it is only to relive the depression of working on such a heavy series,) and the part of the commentary that runs through the ""Death"" segment can only be heard on the
""Death & Rebirth"" disk. However, the commentary that runs through the ""Rebirth"" segment is the same commentary that plays over the beginning of ""End Of Evangelion"". Also there is an option only on the ""D&R"" disk that lets you access infromation while you watch the film for anyone still confused about anything.
If the scant new footage that can only be found here, ""Death"" commentary, and information menu aren't enough to spark your interest, watch the T.V. series, (the first 24 episodes, anyway,) then skip this and go directly to ""End Of Evangelion"".",1066176000,,2881,4.427495291902072

And, in fact alienation is one of the central topics of a story of the personal, often daily armageddons of its central characters. This series was meant to be ambiguous.
 One can argue the show's focus is on exploring the limitations of being human , and that the subplot is in fact the Mecha story of the androids (Evangellions) battles to defeat the Angels.

But there's only SO much the first four episodes can do! I then saw ""Death and Rebirth"" and ""End of Evangelion"" I was blown away, but confused as heck...
This series takes you for a wild ride through human emotions and the vague line of good in evil, you'll find out later on that every character has their own secret plan. So why are you reading my review? Go out and by Neon Genesis Evangelion!
Anyway... back to this... the characters for me is what sets this series apart, it offers a spineless hero, named Shinji Ikari, who has to pilot his fathers creation, a giant biomechanical monster named Evangelion Unit 01. There more Evas too, including Unit 00 whose pilot is a quiet girl named Rei Ayanami. And of course I can't forget about Asuka Langley Sorhyu, the pilot of Unit 02.

To be blunt, Neon Genesis is about humans fighting creatures called angels using biomechs called Evangelions. The catch is the Evas can only be piloted by children, and it seems children with deep pyscological issues. As the series gets further along, a hidden agenda is revealed and the children get more issues that surface. The last 4 episodes are deep, and for some a let down for the major build up. But not for me, that is why it is 5 stars. This is on my top 5 list of anime a person should buy and watch. great stuff.",1064793600,,749,4.319148936170213
1385666,5,B000050IL8,"The plot is very powerful and gripping. I couldn't stop watching as soon as I popped the first DVD in the player. In the face of a whole lot of technological impossibilities, the whole scenario exudes a very realistic feel that is almost frightening.
Three 14-year old kids are assigned as the main pilots for the Eva units -- Shinji Ikari, Rei Ayanami, and Asuka Langley Sohryu. Each one has his/her own personal issues to contend with while being burdened with the task of saving humanity. Shinji is plagued by insecurities, torn between his resentment for his father and the desire to gain his approval. Rei does not value her own life. Asuka hides her true self behind a mask of arrogance and bravado. The three complement each other perfectly -- Asuka is the fire to Rei's ice... and Shinji is somewhere in between. Even as they are forced to mature quickly, the fact that they are still kids manage to shine through. There are funny instances that occur as a result, which provides some much needed comic relief to the dark and depressing overall tone.
If there is a flaw anywhere in the series, I'd say it would have to be the last two episodes. For starters they don't do anything except show a lot of flashbacks and text, while trying to get into the whole existential philosophy deal. You don't know what happens to everybody after all that either. Methinks you have to watch the Eva movies ""Death and Rebirth"" and ""End of Evangelion"" for any sense of closure. A five-star anime series nonetheless, Evangelion gets you thinking about a lot of what if's... and if you ponder long enough you may just feel a little shiver down your spine.",1064793600,,1646,4.640410958904109
1385667,1,B000050IL8,"I thought I check this out cause of all the hype, everybody saying how it's the best anime ever.  I just don't get it.  The story starts off slow and kind of hard to understand sometimes.  When you keep on watching, the story gets deeper and deeper.  So it gets interesting and it makes you think a lot.  Troughout the whole series, the story and the characters start developing, then it gets fun and more action packed, later the series gets more darker and the characters get so personal about themselves and others.  I didn't like some of the characters.  I didn't like the main character Shinji.  Man, He has to be one of the most annoying main anime character ever.  He just whines to much about how he can't do this or that.  He was brave n' light-hearted sometimes, but he's still an annoying cry baby most of the time.  I also didn't like how the series turned out.  I was so disappointed of the last few episodes and I was also disappointed of ""The End of Evangelion"".  This anime isn't for everyone, that's for sure.  I can't own it no more, so I sold it all.  It's not my style, I mostly like fun anime comedy like GTO, Love Hina, Excel Saga, Golden Boy, etc. and other thrillers like Ninja Scroll or KITE.  Neon Genesis?

1385671,5,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis IS and always will be a rewarding and interesting experience for anyone who watches it. Whether you hate it or love it, if u watch the ENTIRE series you be consumed with lingering thoughts about who you are, are you happy and what is your place in the world.
As mentioned, on a basic level the story is about a group of 14 year old children working for an organsation that uses large mech-like robots to fend or the ever looming danger of an organsims called Angels.
But when i say basic i MEAN basic !!!
Around the half way mark the overall content goes from light heart/action series to a devasting disection of all the main characters, (primarly Shinji). You have heard that this series creates emotions and heavy thinking for those that watch it, some even saying they were in a depression for days after the series. Have to say at the end of the day this is just a tv show and i certainly didn't feel depressed but if you sit down to watch the series you can't help but get involved with the characters and lets say, without any spoliers, these character go through hell and back near the end. From the first episode Director Hideaki Anno has no problem is getting yah attention and it very easy to watch one episode and go straight into another with out needing a break. The director has made some of the most intriguing and watchable characters ever. I mean there is one character, (very bossy and angry) who i hated but in one single episode i actually felt for this character and cried (and i don't cry). Yes that's just how powerful this is. Too make a character unlikeable and then to manage to get you to sympathsis with her in a 20 min episode is sheer talent and is only one fraction of how this series unfolds.
Infact as the series progresses you won't be able to leave it. There are really some amazing and tense scenes in this show that will have you sitting on the edge of yah seat waiting for the climax.
I found that, as mentioned, the series starts of action, moves towards light-hearted character build up and them WHAM!!!!
Around Episode 18 you can't help but feel those shivers that run up yah spine when u know your excitied about something good or plain and simply shocked. Furthermore, as the characters on the screen are torn emotionally apart and anaylised cognitaviley and behaviourally you will begin to question yourself. Yes the series is just that powerful, maybe even life changing. I found myself thinking about things for days after and still hold the ideology of my own percepetion of things in comparasion with other perceptions of me as a on-going exploration of my own meaning. In other words this series empowered me not depressing me. Either way if you watch the entire series you will get something out of it.
Visually the animation is quite good with some scenes looking remarkable. Rain and water especially. I found the english dub to be fine and really didn't detract from my experience. Could have been alot worse. However hearing Shinji Jap vocie adds more emotion to his anguish for some reason. Can't quite pick why though.
So in conclusion if you are looking here then you are seeking information about the series and thinking of getting it. All i can say is DO IT. Even if you don't enjoy the cartoon aspects, mech organsims,or action (which i bet you will - this aint pokemon or robotech ladies), you will get something more from this. This is like a therpay session that afterwards will have you questioning purpose, meaning and contexts.
Be warned though, the story as it unfolds becomes more and more convuleted with complextity.
You have to watch this story with interest and probabely seek more information on the web or guides to get a better understanding of the outcomes of this series. As others have said don't watch parts of this series. You need to start from the beggining and move to the end in a linear fashion or you won't get it.
Finally, the infamous last two episodes of the series are quite good and do completment the series. Infact the final two episodes are the most analaytical and really induce you to think hard about yahself and the characters. Have so say though that the last 1 min is just plain stupid but move on to EOE to seek closure. Another reviewer stated that he saw the final two episodes in the series as occurring in Shinji's mind while EOE was what happened to NERV and the others outside of his mind. Viewing it this way is a big help and makes sense, which assists you to fully enjoy everything about NGE.
So, buy it ok. I had my doubts, read some reviews and through good luck managed to get the money to buy it and i have never looked back. I have watched the series right through twice now and picked up more the second time. So for value for money you get:
- a possible life changing experience
- to become engrossed with characters that have excellent depth and emotion
- a strong story line that will have you thinking for years
- a series that u can and really must watch more than once
- a therpay session
- 26 excellent episodes (not one ep failed to bore me)
- tense action that will leave you squirming and open mouthed (some of the final battles are bloody as)
- a series for the mind as well as the eyes
So whats yah waiting for. If you can buy it. Do it now!!!
Thank You Hideaki for NGE. Thank You Thank You Thank You :)",1062460800,4,5345,4.46067415730337

Animation was really good and the sound quality was good too.  The only thing that would really help with this anime is that you know your biblical facts like the back of your hand because this anime is loaded with biblical mentions.
The basic synopsis:  The year is 2015 and some continents in the world are completely submerged in water including tokyo one and tokyo 2 (Both takin out in the First and second impacts) where tokyo 3 was built and where the story takes place.  A series of ""Impacts"" have hit the Earth cause by beings known as ""Angels"".  The Angels only purpose is to crush the remaining survivors of the first and second impact by creating the third impact.  The remnants of the human race decide to fight back using huge mechs known as Evas.  The only humans on Earth that can pilot these mechs are a select few that have to be fifteen years old with a couple of other things in common (You'll catch the ""common"" things when you watch the video. No spoilers here (:  Shinji Ikari and some fellow classmates are the pilots of these evas to save the human race and destroy the angels once and for all.... if they can overcome some obstacles that surface from their past.
I would highly recommend this anime to anyone and everyone.  Get the 2 ending movies too because they were supposed to take place of episodes 25 and 26 due to disgruntled evangelion fans.  Enjoy!!!",1062374400,,1552,4.4522968197879855
1385683,5,B000050IL8,"Matrix, Princess Mononoke,and Neon Genesis Evangelion are my favorites of all time.  Charactors are very alive, that I can't help myself liking them (especially, Rei Ayanami, she is awesome.  She is very quiet, but philosophical, warm hearted, and mysterious).  This anime has a sci-fi component, great charactor development, a lot of bloody action, comical component, sexuality, romance, phylosophy, and great epic story.  You may already heard about the last 2 episodes. To me, it's not that bad.  Compared to the End of Evangelion, the ending is somewhat lighter, at the same time, very philosophical.  These are some of reasons why I think the ending is not that bad.  However, the ending left me with some questions, such as,  What is Rei Ayanami?  What is Lilith, and other angeles? The movie - End of Evangelion explains a lot of facts that were not shown in the TV series, however the movie is extremely depressing.  I wished original episodes had contained those explanations, becasue the movie requires some courage to watch.  If you are looking for a great story, this anime is the one.",1062201600,,1097,4.972527472527473
1385684,5,B000050IL8,"I was a bit nervous to dish out such a large sum of money for this one.
It was worth it, however. :) I did what some said was ""impossible"" and watched the whole series in one sitting- it was so good, I couldn't tear myself away! Though I've since watched it through a second time to get all the finer points of it, Evangelion is by far the most intellectual anime series I've ever seen.
Not only that, but the characters are 3-dimensional beings that continually develop throughout the series. While at the beginning it was somewhat comical and light, starting around episode 14 it began to turn darker, and deeper sides of all the characters are showns; sides that they all tried to hide.
I also empathized with the characters more than is normal: this is one of the few animes that has actually made me cry. I was tearing up when Misato broke down crying (the end of episode 21- don't want to give anything away!), and my heart was really going out toward the characters.
Once you get into the last 8 episodes, the series takes an ever darker turn, and becomes rather jarring, confusing, and philosophical. By the time you reach the end, you will find yourself rather depressed, and be in need of many answers. Some find the ending disappointing, but personally I enjoyed it. I still saw End of Evangelion, for there *were* some answers that I thought needed answering... but the ending to Evangelion was actually a rather optomistic one, suggesting many new possibilities.
So I guess what I'm trying to say is- definitly invest in this anime, especially if you're in the mood to do some deeper thinking. ^_^",1061424000,,1610,4.59375
1385685,5,B000050IL8,"For the Past 2 years I heard this and that about Neon Genesis Evangelion, how it was so good and such, I just blew em all off. But I was in an anime slum one day, so I checked out the series to see what it was all about.
The Anime itself is like one never before ever done, its on a new level of character designs and story complexity. You'll end up watching the series over and over and over again just for the story and the battles. If you've played Xenogears and Final Fantasy 7 for Playstation, mix the complexity of both games together, and thats what the story is like for Evangelion. Its bad all, because the how the story line is, you'll pay more close attention to what is going on.
The main character is Shinji Ikari. His dad is involed in a government organization known as ""Nerv"". Their job is to dispose of giant creatures called ""Angels"". 15 years ago or so the first angel exploded and caused the Antartica to melt, this was known as ""First Impact"", there was a 2nd one to happen, and it was said that a third one will happen to kill all people on Planet Earth. Neon Gensis Evangelion is the struggle Shinji has to prevent this third impact, this is one non stop anime you sure as heck won't want to miss",1061337600,,1219,4.213675213675214
1385686,4,B000050IL8,"Now iam new to all the anime stuff and every tells me i should watch the Neon Genesis Evangelion series they say its the best. I've read all the reviews on the series and i got the basic idea for the show so i ended up buying it. It wasn't excatly what i thought it was the characters voice acting was kinda cheesey but it got better farther in the series. One of the things about this show i never heard or read about was all the sex appeal, skimpy clothing, and naked people. I was really suprised (this isn't a complaint) even though you don't see any of the goods. This shows fight scenes weren't very long but they were very dramatic and some times very gruesome and violent. The story is very confusing at times but it usually explains later on in the show and the ending is horrible and adds more to the confusion. The reason i only give it four stars is because the last two episodes they are intersting for awhile but get very tedious towards the end. If you like mecha type anime and strange monsters this is a must to own but if you like a completed story i suggest you buy the two movies with the box set otherwise you might be disappointed with the ending to such a great series.",1060819200,2,1192,4.209606986899563
1385687,5,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is a bit more dark than some anime series but this should certainly not stop you from buying it.  I have to say that this series is probably the most thought provoking anime series that I have ever seen.  Also, this has the perfect mix of action and drama.  Character development is done fairly well in my opinion but the characters seem to be mere representatives of people in general.
I consider myself to be relatively new to the realm of anime and at the same time pretty ""old school"" at the same time.  I grew up watching things like Voltron, Transformers, Thundercats, etc.  However it is only recently that I've come to appreciate the more serious side of anime.  Evangelion is a great buy and well worth the money.
One final note, I wouldn't buy this for younger children due to some graphic scenes.",1059350400,,831,4.581081081081081

1385689,5,B000050IL8,"The first time I'd ever seen this series was on the Sci-Fi channel, and from that moment on I wanted more. If you're planning on watching the entire Neon Genesis Evangelion series, you might as well start with the box set and save some money. The whole struggle between the Eva pilots and the Angels was quite disturbing, especially when it nears the latter part of the series. Soon the different characters' problems start to haunt them and cause them to become mentally unstable. Evangelion isn't one of those happy-sunshine series, and most of the episodes end on a depressing note, so be warned. Only a few episodes are devoid of any philosophical moments(for example, episode 8 is possibly the most light-hearted.). I personally thought the dubbing was alright. It could've been far worse, and at least most of the characters here actually sound human. Speaking of which, the characters present in Evangelion are possibly some of the most human characters I've ever seen in an anime. Another thing to note is, the final two episodes just don't feel that complete, leaving alot of plotholes. Even though I liked the ending, which actually is a happy one, there was just way too many things that had to be answered. If you see the whole series, you may have to also see the End of Evangelion as well if you end up being too confused.",1056499200,,1336,4.713675213675214
1385690,5,B000050IL8,"The most basic of Evangelion's numerous layers of plots goes as follows: as a gigantic, indestructible creature, later dubbed an ""Angel,"" wreaks havoc on Earth, adolescent Shinji Ikari is sent for by his father Gendo, head of the supersecret underground organization NERV. With no prior training, Shinji is reluctantly able to pilot a giant robot called Eva Unit 01, destroying the creature. As the series goes on, Shinji's reluctance to pilot 01 grows as he battles more of the evil ""Angels,"" along with fiery German import Asuka and silent, unnerving Rei Ayanami and their Eva units.
The questions will fly fast and furious. What are Evas and how were they created? What and where are the Angels from? What is their link to the ""Second Impact"" that put the Earth in its current state? Who and what is Rei? Why does Unit 01 respond the way it does to Shinji, who becomes NERV's best pilot despite his reluctance and lack of training?
The other plot layers weave a complicated but intriguing web that you will understand better with more viewings. There are secret organizations who can predict the arrival of Angels and the outcomes of battles. There are double agents, faked histories, cover-ups and painful betrayals. Mix this in with the heavy theology: the idea of Angels as the bad guys, and the giant light crosses that erupt at their demise; the naming of objects--Adam, The Spear of Longinus (Longinus being the centurion who speared Jesus on the cross), man as a creator of something that will bring about his destruction, Shinji as Gendo Ikari's forced sacrificial lamb...and on and on. Read into everything the series gives you to gain a full appreciation of how deep the creators wanted you to ponder.
This is, Cowboy Bebop in mind, a terrific accomplishment in terms of music and sound. The orchestra plays majestically in a very ""Empire Strikes Back"" way during scenes when 01 goes berserk or into battle, or rings lightly during the more comedic moments. At times the creators are content to have nothing more than the sound of dripping water, the hum of generators or music from headphones serve as the soundtrack. Shinji's pained cries scratch your soul, as much as Rei and Gendo's coldhearted replies chill you to the bone. Background noise from the radio or the television often play some role in the foreground conversation between characters, who speak in mumbled whispers or echoing one-on-one conversations in cavernous settings.
The art is very realistic. Bodies, vehicles and water wakes move exactly as they're supposed to; computer screens move with Matrix-like speeed; reflections, gusts of wind, the display on a minidisc player--it's all very real. The Eva designs are spectacular, very detailed, but at the same time presenting a very primal, brutal image. Themes are well emphasized through the art, be it a plain white ceiling or a pair of broken glasses.
Character development is a must and Evangelion steps up to the challenge. Plenty of time is spent what drives each character, be it something from the past, or something in the present: Misato's traumatic childhood, Ritsuko and Asuka's respective mother complexes, and Shinji's tenuous relationship with Gendo. In the same way Rurouni Kenshin looked at the backgrounds of its Soujiro, Shishio or Aoshi characters, Evangelion doesn't mind deviating just to be able to flesh out a character better.
The biggest criticism or praise (mostly criticism) will be regarding the ending. It's extremely ambitious and very ""artsy"" and philosophical, relying heavily on words, flashbacks and image montages. I certainly had a lot on my mind after that, thinking this or that. Good thing they came out with the Evangelion movies that gave this series a better, but still ambitious ending. If you don't want to sit and ponder, the movies are a must.
The series is indeed the greatest because it gives the viewer credit. It assumes that we can handle deep plots, that we can pick up subtle messages, and complete loose ends. Studying symbolism and metaphors in English or film class is gonna pay off immensely; if not, you can sit back and watch the fulfilling visual feast Evangelion offers. Subtitles will help, especially since they usually also show what is being said on the radio or television.
It's definitely a thinker and multiple-watch series. You've seen the crazy fights, bouncy girls, blazing guns and power ups. It's time to see them again, through the lens of maturity. Highly recommended for those needing a good brain stir.",1055980800,,4515,5.00531914893617
1385691,5,B000050IL8,"Since other reviews have discussed the series in detail (plots, characters, etc.) I will only add that this series should be experienced as a whole, and not piecemeal.  Watching the series out of order or only getting a few of the episodes will only lead to a disappointing experience (as well as confuse the hell out of the viewer).  If you are truly interested I would recommend getting the entire series as well as the two movies, Death & Rebirth (2 hour recap with some new footage that leads into the final act) and The End of Evangelion.  Actually, the series won't make as much sense without watching End of Evangelion (which is incredibly surreal--big mindtrip!!). This series is less of a shoot-em-up then some preview footage may lead you to believe.  If mature anime is your thing, I would highly recommend this series.  If you don't like to think about metaphysical and psychological topics and have a short attention span (i.e. you don't want to have to think about the possible meanings of the show) then you might want to save you money.

Cons :
- There is no single decent person in this story. The characters who are presented in detail are either mentally ill or morally depreived. The only character I could like is the pet penguin.
- The plot starts too simple, than has a sharp turn to complexity all in a sudden. I wondered if it will always be the basic formula of ""eliminating a new angel in a different way"". I even get excited in the middle of the series for two or three episodes, than the excitement faded. The story throws out too much without giving enough details and background. The best example are the final two episodes. Something like this is told in white text with black background, nothing more : ""The instrumentation project took ... years to complete. We can't tell you the details, we can only give you one instance, Shinji Ikari"". Well, the instrumentation project is the cause of all this struggle, but how it's actually achieved is not shown! It's an anime tradition to keep some ends open, but Evangelion keeps all important points open and blurry. Even the directors didn't like its ending and produced two longer episodes, which also deserves only one star.
Pros :
There are only a few interesting ideas such as entry plugs, limited power, eating an enemy to gain its strength, etc.

1385707,2,B000050IL8,"Why this is such a well received anime?
Often seen as a ""benchmark"" in anime, it is nothing of the sort. The majority of the stories are highly simplistic, taking from the sci-fi genre in general (and japanese culture in particular) and the characters are ONE AND ALL single dimensional puppets.  The only character in the entire series that was remotely human was Akagi Ritsuko.
It seems that everyone was characterized as having a single type of feeling, or a single state of mind. The lead character was driven almost entirely by a single event involving praise from his father.
Get real for a minute, people don't act like this, even larger than life anime characters. I was disappointed that these characters were presented as being deep (One episode is taken up by an insipid poem), while they were nothing of the sort.
The conflation of christianity with japanese culture also is a strike against this movie.  Hideaki Anno decides to present a world of entirely Christian mythology, but without really bothering to care about Christianity.  The last episode left fans of the series with a bad taste in their mouths, so Hideaki Anno decided to do another episode (End of Eva) specifically to anger his fans.
This is inexcusable.  Making a film people don't like is one thing, but rubbing it in our face with something even worse when we disapprove is tantamount to professional suicide.
I keep this collection because it represents a clear picture of what anime really should not be. It presents every cliche.  Every b-grade contrivance. Everything wrong with anime as cinema.

1385709,3,B000050IL8,"Death & Rebirth is basically a jumble of things from the Neon Genesis Evangelion series. Mostly it's just a huge trip into the psyche's of the Eva characters. We get to see a lot of scenes from the TV series, so if you've never seen it, this isn't exactly a good way to start. Its not exactly a summary of the series either, for it's VERY non-linear; for example, the beginning of the movie starts off with Misato as a child during the 2nd Impact, then as an adult, then later shows her as a child again, and then as an adult at the start of the TV series, and so on and so forth. Additionally, we get treated to some new scenes that were never shown in the TV series, and some that WERE shown, but are newly animated. Like the rest of the series, Death and Rebirth is very psychological, dealing with the different character's troubled lives. It wasn't made for those who want mindless action, but there ARE some action-packed scenes of the Evangelions fighting the 'Angels' from the TV series.
The DVD includes both the English and Japanese language tracks. The japanese audio is superb, as usual, but the English one is a different story. Most of the TV series' voice actors returned to their familiar roles, but some haven't. Of particular interest is Fuyutski's new voice actor; He doesn't sound much like the TV series' Fuyutski. Maya Ibuki has a new voice actress as well, and she has a better, more softer voice than the previous one(IMO). Tiffany Grant returns as Asuka's, and I really didn't like her voice that much. She didn't sound like a teenager, but she did get Asuka to sound annoying, which is one small part of her character.
Gendo Ikari's voice was great, and I'm glad it was the same voice actor doing his voice.
The music is the same classic stuff we've heard on the TV series, but there's about one or two new ones added, including Canon in D Minor.
The English version does have one thing over the japanese version; the sound is louder, and gets the bass to rumble even more than the japanese version.
The DVD has few extras, just trailers and a commentary(which is quite insightful and funny). The picture quality isn't that good though, which is a shame for those with Widescreen TVs(its not anamorphic either).
Anyway, Death & Rebirth isn't necessary to watch if you're trying to decide whether to get this before End of Evangelion. And it's not a good idea to introduce anyone to Neon Genesis Evangelion with this movie. But for those who have the extra cash and want to see a bit more things that you haven't seen in the TV series, you'd probably want to rent this at the least.",1052611200,,2607,4.513742071881607
1385710,5,B000050IL8,"This item was at a deal price, as I managed to get practically the whole series (the final two episodes were missing but this was okay).  The version was Region 2, but I managed to find out a great deal both about Japanese (I learned the word gomen), and also about apocalyptic literature.  In addition, they managed to supply me with the Eva movie which was an added bonus.  Overall, I would say that this is not recommended for small children, but if you are into either religion or mechas, you might stand a high chance of enjoyment from this masterpiece.",1052179200,,558,4.5049504950495045

(Using the term extremely loosely in this case).  In fact, for anyone who has ever seen the trailer for the series, I joke that they must have culled mecha images from at least 5 episodes to create that trailer.
The story is FAR more about the characters and how the characters interact with what is going on, and with each other.  The character development in this series is simply one of the most superbly done I have ever seen.  There are whole sequences in the series whose sole purpose is to establish mood - and it is very well done.  I won't reiterate what others have said about the plot or details though, as they have already done a great job.

1. Neon Genesis the perfect collection (Episodes 1-24)
2. Then watch Neon Genesis Evangelion - The End of Evangelion
There is no point watching Episodes 25 and 26 or Death and Rebirth for the following reasons:
EPISODE 25 -- Crude images, Philosophical, no connection to series.
EPISODE 26 -- Nothing but random scenes from previous episodes.
DEATH -- Nothing but random scenes from previous episodes.
REBIRTH -- This is the first part of End of Evangelion, thus no point watching it.
I do NOT know what happened, but my theory is that they ran out of time or money at the end of the series and needed to release something. End of Evangelion is what episodes 25 and 26 should have been.",1051142400,4,727,4.732283464566929

Unlike many other animes Eva is not a story of some little romance, it is dramatic and interesting. If you don't want to watch the whole series, then watch the movie Neon Genesis Evagelion: Death and Rebirth. The majority of Death is a synopsis of the series.

1385726,5,B000050IL8,"Sure, I had heard about anime before, mainly from my friend,Brad, but I wasn't jumping for joy.  That is until I began watching Neon Genesis Evangelion.  After watching the first episode I was hooked and new where my money was going.  While it may seem a bit expensive, I paid a lot more buying individually for 27.50 each, it is well worth it.  It starts out with Shinji the main character having some family issues.  The setting is Tokyo 3, a very futuristic city that shelters NERV Headquarters.  NERV is a secret organization against the angels, huge monstrocities that little is known about.  While NERV's goal seems simple, destroy an angel when it comes, there is something much deeper going on that only the higher ups know about.  Gendo Ikari who is Commander of NERV is Shinji's father and is in on the strange things happening in NERV.  Shinji and Gendo are not your typical father-son duo.  Shinji with no other choice has to help his dad achive goals he doesn't even know about.  This is Neon Genesis Evangelion, the series that is perfect in everyway, both animation, PLOT, music, and characters that you actually get to know(GENDO is the best.)  Don't make a mistake and not get this series.",1050019200,,1206,4.690476190476191
1385727,3,B000050IL8,"I watched this movie mainly because it was Evangelion. Should you? Probably not. If you've seen the tv series then you've basically seen Evangelion: Death. Death simply recaps the tv series in a framework built around introducing the Eva pilots. Except for a couple of new scenes there is nothing fresh. On top of that, they had to re-dub the english dialogue and in some cases couldn't get the original voice actors back. It's pretty weird to hear the characters you've spent twenty+ episodes with now sounding completely different. And for some reason they've changed the pronunciation of Eva. Not a big thing but grating. Evangelion: Death is followed by Evangelion: Rebirth, which is really the first part of what becomes the next movie, End of Evangelion. There is really no reason to watch Evangelion Death & Rebirth, not even if you've never seen Evangelion in any form and are hoping for a quick intro. This is not the way to do it. You'll only end up confused and thinking Evangelion is crap, which it most assuredly is not. Go ahead. Borrow, rent, buy, whatever, but watch the original tv series. Then if you're interested you can check this out as a curiosity.
Having said all that, this movie is not totally without merit. You could argue that it's worth seeing what the creator thought was 'important' to take from the tv series. What scenes were really integral to understanding Evangelion? Presumably they would be the ones included here. The real value though is the audio commentary. It's actually worth listening to. Yeah, it's not the creator of Evangelion or any of the Japanese staff which obviously would be preferable. But Amanda Winn Lee (English Language Director, and voice of Rei Ayanami)and two other guys from the English production staff do an alright job. They might be a little too flippant for some tastes. I thought Evangelion was very intense and very psychological, but that doesn't mean just because they were having fun recording the commentary that they weren't respectful of the work. After all, they've spent a good chunk of their time working with the material so it's interesting to hear their thoughts on what some of the symbolism might mean. They pointed out several things I missed, and their insights, while not canon, were nonetheless thought-provoking and made my viewing experience richer. Also, if you like South Park there is a hilarious bit w/ Kaji you might enjoy ; )
Whatever you decide to do, definately watch the tv series. Evangelion is really amazing and you'll be glad you did.",1048636800,5,2538,4.877314814814815

Not one for the non thinkers though. Definitely not a boppy kind of ""Pokmon"" anime. Although it's quite serious it does have its humour, but it's intellectual humour, not the ""fall over and everyone laughs"" kind.
I seriously recommend this to any giant robot fan (Macross/Robotech, Transformers, Nadesico etc) and anyone with a need to expand their mind and views on the world and humanity as a whole.",1047340800,,680,4.82051282051282
1385731,4,B000050IL8,"First let me state that Neon Genisis Evangelion is one of the best animes I have seen. Though its plot is slightly hard to follow, and the last two episodes, however highly thought provoking, do not *fully* resolve the storyline, that's what you get for watching an intelligent, witty, character-driven anime. If you want to turn your brain off for 13 hours (26 half-hour episodes) I suggest you watch DragonballZ or Pokemon - this one's not for you.
My problem with this DVD collection isn't with the content, but how it's presented. I think Hideaki Anno should be insulted at how ADV has treated his work of art. Unlike the Cowboy Bebop DVDs, no two DVDs of this collection are exactly alike (at least in the box set I got). The first few DVDs fit four episodes each, while the others only fit three. However, it seems as if the DVDs could have held at least five each because of the complete lack of any extra content, or even decent menus.
The only extra content on the DVDs are ads for other animes (and Farscape, go figure). On the first few DVDs, these ads are located in their own menu off of the main menu. On the rest of the DVDs the ads are played automatically after the FBI warning, and that's annoying.
Another problem I had was the fact that the chapter positions were illogical on several of the discs. I like to skip an episode's opening animation (no need to see it more than once); however on a few of the discs the chapter after the opening is placed *after* the episode title. In a nutshell, that means you've skipped both the opening animation and the first five minutes of the anime. Urg.
My last gripe is the fact that some of the DVDs had the Japanese text digitally replaced with Engilsh while on others the English was merely typed over the Japanese. This is true from DVD to DVD within one box set as well as from box set to box set. My 1st DVD has the text typed over, while my friend's 1st DVD has it digitally replaced.
Does this mean this anime isn't worth buying? If you think that then I personally hate you with all of my being. Don't let my complaining about inconsequential flaws in the DVD deter you from enjoying this brillant masterpiece. Evangelion is definately worth owning, despite ADV's blunders. Believe me, once you see it you'll be glad you ignored this review.",1046649600,3,2309,4.4739336492890995
1385732,3,B000050IL8,"As you have no doubt deduced by now, this disk contains two episodes of the finale of Hideaki Anno's Masterpiece ""Evangelion"".  You have also surely discovered that this is the first part of a two part movie series.  However there is very little point to buying this volume unless you are a hardcore Evangelion fan because there truly is no reason to buy it except to fill a hole on your shelf between your perfect collection and the End of Evangelion.
The first episode is a condensed version of the television series jammed into a 60-minute episode.  It is comprised entirely of scenes cut from the television show.  However this will serve no use to either the experienced Evangelion Fan nor to someone who has never seen the show.  The purpose of this episode was back at Japanese theaters in 1997 when the Evangelion fans hadn't seen the show for two years and were beginning to forget key facts (I.E. Anno didn't want the Eva Fans going to see the ending only to shout out in the theatre, ""Who's Toji-kun again?"").  I did fail to mention that there are a few new scenes put into here from the cutting floor (one of the second impact, another of a conversation with Yuki and stuff like this; nothing that earth shattering.)  Overall it is useful to see once just to say you saw them all.  The Second episode is the first part of the ""End of Evangelion"" saga.  It is a awesome end!!...  However, this episode is also shown on the ""End of Evangelion"" DVD in its entirety so it isn't a reason to buy the disk now that both are for sale.
Many fans point out the extras on this disk which include some trailers for Death and Rebirth and E.O.E., a very long, un-segmented preview trailer for other Manga works, a collection of screen text files that give info on different aspects of the NGE Saga, and a very over rated (Double underline, triple exclamation point in a bold red marker) commentary.  Would it have killed them to get a subtitled version by some of the real cast or even Hideaki himself?! What you get is a American Dubbing-""Actress"" and English language director explaining it to you.
Overall the special features are interesting to look at every now and then, it's interesting to see what they consider the show's important points are in the first episode and the second episode is just a tack on.  If you're new, go check out the perfect collection, if you've already seen it just don't drop End of Evangelion for this disk, if you want to buy both that's fine.

I would say that this is the greatest anime I have ever layed my eyes upon, and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience something great.",1045267200,,426,3.852272727272727
1385734,4,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is one of the few landmarks of anime. First released in Japan in 1996, it was introduced to the west in 1997, and became the first anime blockbuster series.
The story follows a young boy who was abandoned by his father in favor of a military career. However, his father calls him back to do his bidding. This is because a dangerous force has returned; monstrocities called Angels (that look like demons, to be honst) that are intent on destroying about everything. Huge fighting robots are the only thing that seems to be able to do any serious damage on them, and these Evas can only be piloted by gifted teenagers.
The story is very emotional. In Japan, character personality usually is more important then the story itself (contrary to US cartoons, Samurai Jack being the exception) and it shines through. The story is VERY confusing at the end, however, so you should probably watch the movies that were released after to get the ""real"" ending.
Why 4 stars? It isn't the best of the best. It is a great series, but in all honesty I prefered Cowboy Bebop and Trigun over it. However, it is much higher quality then anything currently being released from Japan, and it is the first (and best) mecha anime. It started the trend.
Overall? Rent it first. But after that, you'll probably be totally convinced to buy it. And if you enjoyed it, I highly recommend the Playstation Game Xenogears as a companion; it has similar robot-fighting themes(some say Xenogears was inspired by NGE)
Overall? Every otoku should own this. Any anime fan should watch it. It is truely a work of art.",1044835200,2,1604,4.691489361702128
1385735,4,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death & Rebirth is not a must have for those who are fans of the series. I suspect that a lot of the confusion around this DVD has to do with Manga Entertainments production of it.
""Death"" is essentially the first half of the DVD which is a fairly fast paced review of the entire series, but put to a very compelling setting. ""Death"" from what it seems is intended to ""refresh"" your memory of the series before taking on ""Rebirth"". Oddly though, ""Rebirth"" is the 40 minutes of ""End of Evangelion"".
So if you purchase both DVDs you will realize that there is this very large overlap between them. I'm not certain what Manga Entertainment was doing, however their production of Death & Rebirth seems to be sub-par, though the title screen on the DVD is haunting with the flashes of imagery and sound from the series.
Manga's bizarre production values aside, the story presented in ""Death"" seems intended to set you up for ""End of Evangelion"". ""Death"" is a whirlwind of plot moments from the TV series along with additional moments that seem to at detail and heighten your understanding of the TV series. ""Death"" is a good refresher. After watching it, it leaves you of that sense of ""What's next?"" and wanting more.
This DVD is really for Evangelion fans who want to round out their collection, and is only recommended for such people. If money is a bit short, I recommend that you get ""End of Evangelion"" instead as ""Death & Rebirth"" are not necessary in order to appreciate ""End of Evangelion"".",1043452800,4,1519,4.650557620817844
1385736,5,B000050IL8,"A friend of mine introduced me to this series almost two years ago. He was pretty emphatic in saying that, ""It's not like other anime at all."" He was right. I am not a big anime fan, my friend though is. I find a good bit of anime to be too ""campy"", silly, or just not worth the time. Neon Genesis Evangelion is far from that however.
Much like other people told by friends or reviewers that this series was different, I devoted all my attention when I started watching it in hopes that it would not take long to find out why it was ""different"". I was hooked quickly. When seeing the first battle and the explosion in the shape of a giant glowing cross I was immediately intrigued, and I was hooked too.
The series moves overall at this medium pace to keep you in the story, but at the same time not tire you too quick by drowning you in too much plot at once. I can 99.9999% guarantee that you will not get all of the story in the first past even if you pay 100% attention. The series is filled with a lot of imagery. There are important details in what is said, and what is NOT said.
One will quickly notice that the biblical themes are very strong in the series. They in fact provide for a very powerful vehicle in which the message of the series is carried to it's amazing conclusion. Let me point out here that the ending is very unconventional. You must be open minded and not rely on your expectations. The creator of the series is in fact giving the viewer a gift of sorts.
After watching this series I immediately wanted to get it for myself, but was not able to until a few months ago. I purchased this box set, which includes the re-dubbed volume 1 DVD. The initial Volume 1 had some audio errors. This box set also included a very nice slip case that holds the DVDs. I suggest that those interested in this series shop around. I purchased my box set new at [...] for under [$$$] dollars.
So  if you are not a big fan of anime because you found it too be too shallow, silly, or just not that interesting I highly suggest you give Evangelion an honest try.",1043452800,,2066,4.204030226700252
1385737,3,B000050IL8,"As an avid viewer of anime and a fan of the sci-fi/action/drama genre. I had high expectations for Neon Genesis Evangelion. I read the reviews and everyone gave it 5/5 stars. I bought into such claims like, ""..BEST ANIME EVER.."" and ""..A MUST SEE FOR ANY ANIME FAN.."".
Well, after watching the entire series from the boxed collection set, I must say, NEON GENESIS EVANGELION DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE. Without spoiling the movie for readers, I will just say that the movie has way too many loose-ends for you to appreciate the storyline. Do not buy into all of these positive reviews from other readers, save your money and buy a -good- anime movie, such as Princess Monoke.
I consider myself an intelligent person and like I said earlier, I appreciate the sci-fi/anime/drama/action genre, but there is just way too much psychological [stuff] in this movie. Most people after watching the series will ask themselves, ""What the hell did I just see?""
If you MUST see this series, go rent it, or borrow it from a friend. Its not worth owning in my book. I give it 3 stars, because it does shine in the artistic department and character development is pretty well done. Oh, and the music is kinda catchy too. The video quality is not the best and expect to see some reused/recycled footage. For parents, the anime is not rated, but expect to see some nudity and sexual ennuendos. There is also 1 sex scene in the movie, but its just audio.

Also recommend Ghost in the Shell.",1043280000,,315,5.5
1385739,5,B000050IL8,"For those of you who just like to watch things blow up with great fights, well, you'll like this anime only to an extent. Yes, 14 year old children do pilot giant ""Evangelions"" to destroy Angels. But one absolutely MUST realize that this show isn't about great fights, it's about the characters developing through strange experiences and how they interact with each other.
There are a lot of references to different things in this series. The most obvious of course, is the Bible. While the most religiously devout might not appreciate this series, if you love to think, then there is no way you can hate this series. It raises questions to some of the most philosophical questions in existance, which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen it.
The story is full of plot twists and secrets, some so good that you won't even figure it out the first time they tell you. I have watched this series in it's entirity 5 times, and I learn something new every time. This series is easily worth what you'll spend on it, and more. Comic relief is also readily available, so those of you who can't take hours of straight seriousness will also be able to enjoy this show. For those of you who like straight seriousness, you'll be glad to know that the relief is done in a way masterful enough that it only furthers the development of character.
It is hard writing a good review on something like this without spoiling anything, but if you like drama, fighting, or thinking in your animes, this will be an enjoyable show. If you can sit through the ever-confusing beginning and make it to the second DVD or so, you'll begin to understand. Half way through the series, you'll not want to stop until it's over. Even if I already had seen the series without owning it, I would still buy it.",1043020800,2,1777,4.538940809968848
1385740,3,B000050IL8,"This is a really confusing film to write a review for. It is divided into two halves, Death and Rebirth. Death is simply a collage of images that seem to be taken from the TV series (which I havn't seen, I was hoping this was like the Gundam I, II, and III compelation movies). There isn't really a plot, it's like animated cliff notes. Rebirth, however, follows a coherint storyline which is quite good.
  I'm not a fan of anime in general, I wathed this because I read the entire contents of a web site (yes, I do have a life, I'm just not living it) and it fits the dictionary definition of science fiction. So, I will compare it to other works in that genre.
  On an intellectual and moral issues scale, it strikes right below Star Trek and Gundam (the original, not the Wing stuff) and right above Star Wars. The characters are right up with the greats, although you can probably imagine Shinji going to the Toshi station to pick up some power converters. As for the fight scenes, they don't quite match the battles of Hoth or A Bau Qu.
  I'd say 14 and up, you'll like it if you enjoy anime or Sci-Fi/Fantasy. But if you want real jems from those geners check out Gundam III, The Two Towers, and Nemisis!

1385748,3,B000050IL8,"Gainax's NEON GENESIS EVANGELION has captured a large size of the Anime market in terms of sales and fans, but the last two episodes of the 26-part apocalyptic tale caused controversy from both critics and audiences alike.  Apparently director and creator Hideaki Anno (GUNBUSTER, NADIA:  THE SECRET OF BLUE WATER, HIS & HER CIRCUMSTANCES) wasn't so thrilled either, so he decided to remake the ending as a movie -- two movies to be exact.
 The first of these movies, entitled DEATH AND REBIRTH, is actually two movies in one.  The first section of the ""feature"", DEATH (running for about three-quarters of the 110 minute film), is basically a recap of the first 24 episodes-- all out of order and interspersed with additional footage and/or scenes of the protagonists (including lonely Shinji Ikari, enigmatic Rei Ayanami, and bitchy Asuka Langley Sohryu) at violin lessons.  I did find this somewhat interesting, poetic, and artistic to look at -- the tricks they performed with the credits in particular are really impressive -- but what ""new"" scenes included are scattered and few, and the material isn't really much more than stuff that we've already seen.
 Following the ""movie"", which concludes with the death of the ""final"" angel, Kaworu, (yes, the infamous one-minute pause in-between his final sentence to Shinji and his death is included), is a brief intermission which eventually leads into the second ""part"" of the movie.  REBIRTH is the first 20 or so minutes of the ""remakes"" of the last two episodes.  I could talk about them here, but these 20 minutes are actually identical to those of the second EVANGELION movie, END OF EVANGELION, the supposedly ""final"" entry in this confusing, labyrinthian tale.
 In other words, DEATH & REBIRTH doesn't really feel like a great purchase if you've already seen the show.  I should have listened to those who warned me in advance.  EVANGELION completists may find it to be rewarding, but I was a little disappointed with it, especially since I was expecting more.
 On an even more ironic note, the DVD presentation feels uneven.  The video quality is decent throughout, and the interactive menus are beautifully constructed.  The MOKUJI interactive feature is also said to be helpful, but I haven't checked it out yet.
 The audio seems to be one of the unfortunately weaker aspects of the DVD.  The English dub can be heard in either 5.1 or 2.0 sound, but the Japanese track is in 2.0.  And the dub feels unpolished.  It benefits strongly from having most (if not all) of the actors from the original EVA dub return to once again lend their voices to this dysfunctional cast of characters, but at the beginning, they sound a little out of it, and the new actors, although decent for the most part, don't seem to suit the characters well.  In addition, the pronunciations are slightly different from ADV's release of the series -- mainly that of EVA.  On top of that, the dub feels poorly mixed -- the music, dialogue, and sound effects are not as vibrant or equalized as on the Japanese language track.
 There is an audio commentary track by Amanda Winn Lee (the dub director and voice of Rei Ayanami) for people who are interested, me included.  I have yet to hear the entire track, but what I heard so far did sound interesting, especially since I'm a bit more of a dub enthusiast.
 The only real drawback of the DVD, however, is the mere fact that it's DOUBLE-SIDED.  I hate it when DVDs are presented like this; it makes it easier to lay fingermarks or scratches on it when you don't want to.  Plus, you have to FLIP the disk (thankfully not to see the entire movie) to get to the other features that ""SIDE A"" doesn't have.  MANGA ENTERTAINMENT has received a lot of flak about their DVD releases lately, and it's unfortunate that this DVD suffered as a part of that trend.  I will not go so far to slam-dunk this release, but I think it could have been much better.
 All in all, DEATH & REBIRTH appears to be restricted for diehard EVA fans, enthusiasts, and completists only.  For others, I wouldn't suggest this as a good introduction, as it will feel disjointed and confusing -- as if the show isn't already enough of that.  I don't know what to think about my choice to purchase it, but I fall in the middle of regretting it and being glad that I did.  I guess I'll never know what to think.  Still, the cinematography is interesting and the music is beautiful.",1042588800,,4425,4.713914174252276

1385750,2,B000050IL8,"I have only watched the first four episodes in the Neon Genesis Evangelion series. I remembered them being pretty interesting so I bought this movie hopeing to understand it better, and I have to say it was freaky and confusing! I realized that it was an intire review of the series and some parts look really awsome but when they show those ""awsome"" parts for ten seconds it ...! They show parts of really awsome mecha battles then they bust out with these interuptions of words like ""anger, battles, hurt, fear"" and all kinds of other stuff and they flash them so fast that you can bearly read them! They get really annoying when they show like fifteen of them for a ten second battle clip!! I don't recomend this movie because its just not worth your money and trouble. You should just buy the series! This movie skips back too fast and a movie isn't a movie when its made up of a bunch of clips that go back and fourth! The only good thing about this ""movie"" is the fact that they have all kinds of review clips from the series, but thats it and its not that great when its put all together!",1041552000,,1095,4.320388349514563
1385751,5,B000050IL8,"I am a huge anime fan. I have been for about 3 or 4 years. This is definatly one of the most deep, confusing, and streight-up awesome animes I have seen. It starts out normal enough. A gient explosion in antartica (second impact)caused the destruction of the human race. After that a group called ""nerv"" is formed to make sure it never happens again. This agency uses robots called ""Evas"" to destroy the ""angels"" that caused second impact.
In the beggining is action packed, funny, and a lot like the older Gient robot animes, like gundam. When it starts it's all about exterminating the angels and the interaction between the 3 eva children. the beggining also has a lot to do with the main character, shnji, and how he deals with living whith 2 beutiful women that he has no cance with. But near the end it gets very confusing, desturbing, and very well done. This seires is defenatly not for kids. It is violent, and it also has some breif nudity. If you are a fan of anime, This is an awsome buy.",1041552000,,1000,4.440217391304348
1385752,4,B000050IL8,"NEon Genesis Evangelion has the reputation of being the absolute best in the field of anime, and it is very well done.  However the reputation that I have heard is that the characters are almost lifelike personality wise and that the story is rich and engrossing. Well I don't know about those details but the story is good, but the characters are on many occasions like cartoon characters that you would see on some stuff like G.I. Joe, or Ranma 1/2.
The story is that these creatures known as Angels are thretening earth. There are these three mechs known as Evas that can only be piloted by a select few kids.  As it happens the kids are in their teens and must deal with awkwardness of puberty. Some on many occasions the three pilots are caught in awkward sexual inuendo like situations that are funny at first but can get dull after a while.
OVerall it may not seem like I know what I am talking about at first but if you look at it from my perspective you may see why I find some it dull. The characters don't resemble believable personalities and the battles, although cool, do lose some flair.  Overall this is a good series, but by far not the best out there.",1041379200,,1169,4.402777777777778
1385753,5,B000050IL8,"Wow, ok let's analyze this series. Let us ignore the fact that it is an Anime for the start of it. It keeps it simple that way. Ok, it's about a boy, he has problems like many kids in the U.S. today, seriously, Mother's dead, Father's [mean]. He's completely self-sufficient and therefore has trouble coping with reality. It's a kid that you would see a lot of in the world today. That eliminates all the people complaining in reviews that Shinji (main charecter) is some kind of mindless ""weirdo"" and that everyone in this series is insane. Sorry to disappoint you but the world is not puppies and butterflies. Next, onto the Anime part of this. It's plot is beautifully woven and there were parts where I had goosebumps man. It seems wierd ""Yeh he got goosebumps from a cartoon what a loser"" But, its just that touching, the problems are very real despite the mechanical and alienated creatures that this story spits out at you. The people have real lives, real problems, realy accomplishments.
 Also, if you aren't a big fan of plots. That means you absolutely love stories like DragonBall Z and the like. Where someone repeatedly saves the world from countless alien creatures without much of real people problems. Then no don't bother watching this series. Don't get me wrong I love DragonBall Z but, as far as plots and stories go. Neon Genesis is the best. The last two episodes, before End of Evangelion that is. Confused me, and just extremely bothered me. I watched End of Evangelion, lol well let's just say I think the creator had some problems putting this story to rest because it still bothered me but, I'm happy now. It did explain all of the problems with the humans instead of the Angels (alien creatures). Which was a lot better than expected, but ... the last scene, I just don't get it. But, that ok the story is stunning, graphics and fight sequences are the best. Don't listen to anyone until you've watched the first few episodes and really picked up on the story. Then you can tell me I'm wrong.
I have edited in this part.  I have a 12-year-old brother, who believes DragonBall Z is the best Anime and they only one worth watching.  I forced him through the process of beating him senselessly and throwing him on the couch, to watch the first episode.  I was bewildered when we both spent the rest of our Winter Break watching the series and movies and talking about the series and getting all of our friends hooked on it.  So I say... IT IS FUN FOR ALL AGES!!!  Just watch the first two epsiodes and do yourself a favor.",1041292800,,2547,4.550218340611353
1385754,5,B000050IL8,"This is, by far and away the BEST anime series EVER!! I got into watching anime about 4 years ago, and when I saw this series, it blew me away. Ignore those who put it down because this is a work of geneius and they are just too stupid to see it.
Although from the outside it looks like a typical giant-robo anime, after watching the first episode anyone in thier right mind should be able to see that it is not. Evangelion gives an original view of the future, with great city and mecha designs and the even more original forms of the angels.
However, the best thing about Evangelion is the characters. They are far more complex and realistic then any other characters I've seen in anything before, with even minor characters being interesting and different.

Now 4 years late almost to the day i'm a huge anime fan and i have to say that this anime changed the way i think about enterainment.

1385756,5,B000050IL8,"I have reviewed all the individual DVD's in this series, so this won't be a review that focuses on plot details.  Whether you like it or hate it, there is no denying that Evangelion looms large in any investigation of anime as an art form.  In truth, there is very little to dislike, but director Hideaki Anno has put so much into it that the story is prone to take sudden changes in direction.  Usually right after the viewers think that they have everything figured out.  This is intentional, but sometimes it is a source of temporary discontent.
Put simply this is the story of three fourteen year old children - Shinji Ikari, Rei Ayanami, and Asuka Langley - who have been bred to be able to merge with giant bioengineered creatures called Evangelions, EVA's for short.  Their task is to protect a post apocalypse world from the invasions of giant angels.  These are creatures much like the EVA's, whose agenda is not completely clear.  Of course, the truth is that this is perhaps 30% of the story, which is a combination of psychodrama, metaphysical mystery play, and an investigation into the potential of the human race.  In fact, nothing is ever exactly what it seems.
As an example of the many layers to the story, there is a tremendous amount of Judeo-Christian symbolism worked into the story.  The Sephiroth, the Kabalah's tree of life, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Lance of Longinus, and cruciform images abound.  All of this adds up to an impending sense of apocalypse, but the truth us far stranger.  Hideaki Anno has intentionally used this symbolism to create an atmosphere that is 'mysterious' to his Japanese audiences.  Yet there is a whole other spiritual layer that is uniquely Japanese, drawing deeply from the Kojiki, an ancient creation legend.  This is something many non-Japanese viewers will miss.
This is one of many cases of the subtle undercurrents that make this series far more than an action oriented mecha story.  Characters are complex, and develop rather than stay single sided.  Anno's artistic control creates a visual layering that is just as right as the ploy.  Careful attention to details will reward the viewer with all manner of hints and indicators of what is to come and what is happening.  All production values are excellent and Anno shows he is willing to take real creative risks in his efforts to communicate.
Of course, if you are considering buying the series, this collection really is the only sensible way to buy it.  Despite the alarming price ticket, it is still much better priced than the one at a time charge.  Whether you buy, rent, or borrow, this is one of the anime series that must be seen.  You will not be disappointed.",1039824000,195,2686,4.760259179265659
1385757,4,B000050IL8,"The English voices were cast appropriately for the characters, however the English voice acting for the most part is just plain *horrid* and the translation is often weak. You'll most certainly want to hear the original Japanese actors and watch the English subtitles where the translation is clear.
The DVD video and audio quality is itself very good, but as others have pointed out there are issues with the transfer. The video was not de-interlaced properly, so unbraided image scan-lines become briefly but painfully obvious during high action sequences, especially during freeze-frame, and the credits just disintegrate. I did not notice these interlace problems in the Japanese VCDs of these four episodes. It's disappointing but livable; there are few other visual artifacts but they are hardly noticeable.
Otherwise I agree with the reviews given by ""confuse_a_cat"" and Josh Leman.
This is my first DVD purchase from the EVA series and I plan to buy others. I already own a few NTSC tapes and have watched many of the episodes in VCD format.",1039046400,,1049,5.104651162790698

1385759,4,B000050IL8,"Fans of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" will most likely want to get this DVD though it is not needed.  The ""Death"" part of this movie is a recap of the first 24 episodes of the TV series.  Only the bare highlights are given in order to cram that much information into such a short amount of time that I don't think this would be helpful to those who have not already watched the series.  However, the recap can be helpful to possibly answer a couple of questions or bring a small amount of clarity to what you've seen before.  Some of the animation has been redone to make it better and some previously unseen footage from the show has been placed here.
The second part of the movie is called ""Rebirth"" and is simply the first part of ""End of Evangelion"" movie.  So in a way, it's almost a waste and certainly is a tease of what's coming up.
There are two big reasons to own this DVD.  First, fans of the series will want it to fill out their collection.  Second (and the biggest reason) is the audio commentary from the director of the English dub (and English voice of Rei) as well as Jason Lee and one other guy involved in anime.  Since they worked a long time getting the translation right, they are very familiar with the story and what is going on.  So they are able to provide insights into the story as well as pointing out things you might miss.  Jason Lee is very helpful since he knows a ton about Catholic dogma/beliefs/stories (which is the basis for the ""Christian"" themes in this movie) as well as other mythos.  His comments help a ton in explaining things.
The original Japanese audio is included as well as English subtitles if you need that.  There are other extras as well, but I haven't taken the time to examine them all.
Bottom line:  Neon Genesis Evangelion is a great series, but this DVD is not a required purchase.  However, I am happy with this DVD.",1037923200,26,1873,4.375722543352601
1385760,5,B000050IL8,"If the previous DVD's story was a hint that nothing is quite what it seems, in the three episodes here, the scales begin to fall away, almost without warning.  We will only encounter one Angel, but the interplay of the characters is so intense that one hardly notices.  In addition, the steady pace of revelations about, NERV, SEELE, and the Human Instrumentality Project leave the viewer as unnerved as the characters.
The first episode, ""Lie and Silence,"" has Misato trying to deal with her own interior loneliness and her ambivalent feelings about Ryoji Kaji, would be lothario and suspicious character.  Confronted by a series of unnerving discoveries that includes the remains of the first Angel secreted in the chambers below NERV headquarters, Misato finds herself questioning NERV's true agenda.
In the next episode, ""Sickness unto Death, and...,"" is one of the most terrifying episodes thus far.  Shinji and Unit 01 are trapped in the interior field of an Angel that does not seem to exist and the boy's hallucinations strip him down to a fragile core.  When this triggers impulsive action on the part of the EVA, everyone, pilots and staff, suddenly realizes that the EVA's are much more than robot slaves.  And that their true nature may be just as dangerous to man as the angels.
This episode lays the groundwork for the tragedies to come.  In an inexplicable event EVA 04 and the entire secondary NERV site vanish without a trace.  Gendo Ikari's bleak ruminations leave us with little doubt that he has his own priorities, and even Misato becomes suspicious of the speed at which the fourth child, Toji Suzuhara, is identified.
In a stream of small betrayals, the tension between the characters mounts.  It becomes clear that the destruction of the angels has a timetable of its own, and is being used to mask both SEELE's expectations and Gendo Ikari's own intentions.  In the middle are the pilots, victims of the ambitions of others.  The more human they become, the stronger grows the sense of some impending inexorable fate.",1037577600,2,2042,4.924198250728863

1385762,4,B000050IL8,"I am writing as a great fan of ""Neon Genesis:Evangelion"" who likes both the series ending and the move ending! My focus here is to provide a little guidence. This movie is essentially a great recap of Eva episodes and an intro to the main feature ""The End of Evangelion"". For those who have watched the entire series, it provides no new information.  These are my recomendations:
Buy this if: 1)You must posess the whole series for any reason  2) You have the whole series but don't understand the ending. 3) You just feel that you couldn't focus on the theme of the series. 4)You are buying the series and want to capture a bargain.
DON'T buy this if: 1) You never heard of it before. Start from Episode One, you will never get it fron this. Believe me, you will enjoy it well!  2)You saw a couple of early episodes and want to catch up (it won't work) 3) You have the series memorized or at least well undertood and don't need additional focus.
My bottom line is that there is nothing *wrong* with this, but there is nothing new here either.  ""The End of Evangelion"" is the definitive end of the series, this movie only serves to get you up to speed if you need it and contributes nothing new in it's own right.",1037059200,5,1213,4.353982300884955

On the good side of things this would be a good idea to view before the DVD ""End of Evangellion"" which for all extensive purposes will make that one more entertaining without having to purchase the series in it's entirty.

1385765,5,B000050IL8,"Now that we have met Shinji Ikari, the second child, it is only fair that we follow his encounters with the other children, Rei Ayanami, the first child, and Asuka Langley Sohryu, who is the third.  All of these fourteen year olds are destined (perhaps doomed) to save the world of the Second Impact from the attack of Angels - bioengineered creatures determined to destroy the human population.
We know from some idle conversation that Rei has no memories of a time before her training to merge with one of the gigantic Evangelion built to stop the angels.  Badly injured in the testing of the prototype unit, it is only in episode 5 that she finally takes an active role.  Rei is withdrawn and unemotional, so it is only because of a wildly embarrassing incident that Shinji penetrates her exterior.  Then Ramiel, Angel 5, attacks NERV headquarters and Rei and Shinji must work together to face the threat.  Then later (episode 7), Shinji and Misato confront a berserk robot created as competition for NERV's EVAs.
In episode 8 we finally meet Asuka, who is the exact opposite of Rei.  Loud, egotistical, and intensely competitive, she is the pilot of EVA 02, the first 'production EVA.  Shinji and Misato fly out to meet with the fleet that is transporting the new EVA from Germany to Japan.  Asuka is only distracted from making Shinji miserable by the arrival of Gaghiel, the horrific sea angel.  As Gaghiel starts tearing the fleet apart Shinji and Asuka must pilot the untested EVA 02 while Misato tries to come up with a scheme to stop the angel and keep the two young pilots alive.
One of the things that is notable about this series is that the pilots, Shinji, Rei, and Asuka, are all too human.  Shinji's underlying cowardice, Rei's distance from her emotions, and Asuka total lack of distance from some inner source of anger grant this story a sense of reality that something like 'Power Rangers' is totally lacking.  I also have to commend the acting of the English voice cast for the color and accuracy of their readings.",1036108800,5,2035,4.704225352112676

  Character development here is paramount and is done masterfully!  This show has some of the most human characters of any series (American, Japanese or otherwise) I've ever encontered.  This is the series that got me hooked on anime.  It's got it all:  Believable characters (with more issues than National Geographic), great action, futuristic technology, religous symbolism out the wazoo, and an ending that will astound/puzzle/provoke you!
  I also really liked the English Dub.  In fact, I slightly prefer it to the Japanese. (I'm no purist!!)
  As an amature philospher, the existentalism present in the series was intriguing.  As a Christian, I would disagree with the warped theology presented, however this does nothing to lessen the profound impact (no pun intended) this series' message will have upon you.  As a sci-fi fan, this simply raised my personal bar for eschatological (end-times) fiction.

1385767,5,B000050IL8,"I've been a fan of Evangelion since it was originally brought into North America back in 1996.  As probably a lot of fans are, I really didn't understand what most of the series was trying to say.  So when I heard that the 'real' ending to the series would be released this year, I was overjoyed.
The first portion of the DVD, titled 'death' is basically a recap of the original 24 episodes (we won't include the 13th volume as it's 'purpose' is to also recap the first 24).  It is mainly flashbacks of the series, using animation already seen plus new footage.  It chronicles everything from the origin of the Second Impact to every major character in the series.  It's nice the way it was done as it's not done in chronological order but rather broken up into pieces and each 'episode' relates to a song played by Shinji, Asuka, Rei, and Kaworu in the school's auditorium.
Following a portion titled 'Intermission', we get 'Rebirth', which is the beginning part of the next movie titled ""End of Evangelion"".  This is the beginning of the official ending to Neon Genesis Evangelion.  In it, NERV is issued an order to surrender the Evas, Adam, Lilith and the Magi to SEELE.  They refuse, which promotes an attack on NERV HQ by the JSSDF.  This portion of the movie is basically non-stop action all the way to the end, which ends in... well... you'll have to buy it and find out...
The 'Mokuji Interactive Feature' is pretty cool as it is the regular movie but when it comes to certain important parts you are able to select key choices from a menu about characters, events, items, etc. that relate to the scene(s).  It's a very nice feature as even long-time fans of the series can learn from it (I did, for one).
Other nice features include the usual image gallaries, an audio commentary, and a comprehensive dictionary including files for all the characters, organizations, equipment, the angels, and events that are in the Neon Genesis Evangelion series.
One of the original concerns was that because of the fact that this movie is published by Manga Entertainment, many fans were concerned if the English dubbed version would retain it's ADVision (it's North American original publishers) version voice actors.  Don't be alarmed, all the original dubbed voice actors are still here.
If you have not seen the original series, SEE IT FIRST!  You will probably be completey lost if you buy this one first.  Otherwise, fans of Eva shouldn't have this missing from their DVD library.",1035849600,,2483,4.7331786542923435

The first episode (Death) is nothing but a clip reel recapping the first 24 episodes of the series.  The second (Rebirth) appears at first to be original content, but it's nothing more than the first half-hour or so of the End of Evangelion.  The only content here you won't be finding more completely in either the series or End of Eva is the original song that plays at the end of Rebirth...

1385769,4,B000050IL8,"I'm a casual anime fan who wishes to expand his Japanese animation video library beyond just a couple of feature movies such as Akira and Princess Mononoke. I made the decision to purchase this pricey DVD set after reading quite a few reviews. They were lavish with praise over Neon Genesis Evangelion. According to most of the reviews everything about this anime is fantastic.
Well, after watching every single episode of the show, I was left thinking, 'goodness, it wasn't THAT great!'
The story/premise is interesting. It's the year 2015. Half of humanity has been wiped out due to a cataclysm in the Antarctic caused by a being called an ""Angel."" More Angels appear and begin to threaten the rest of the human race. Man-made giant bio-mechanical creatures called Evangelions (Evas for short) are the only means of fighting the Angels, and only a small handful of teens are capable of driving the Evas. Somehow these events are foretold in the Dead Sea Scrolls and, with a few obscure Biblical/historical references, play out though the series.
The story was hard to follow at times but I was able to understand enough of it to get by. I just wished the plot congealed more effectively. By the end I was left hanging. When the credits rolled at the end of the last episode I remember saying out loud, ""THAT'S IT?!"" There is a true ending to Evangelion that's NOT included in this set. It was released later as a movie, I believe. For full understanding and possible satisfaction, you MUST see that movie after watching this series. It's called, simply, The End of Evangelion. I've seen it and I'll review it later.
The designs of the Eva units are original and stylish, as is most of the technology featured in this series. But the greatest thing about Neon Genesis Evangelion is the characters. I didn't expect them to be so realistic, entertaining and varied. It's amusing to see them interact. Most viewers will be able to identify with at least one character during the course of the show. I felt for Shinji. Asuka, the redhead, had me hating her in the beginning but by the end I was actually feeling sorry for her! Bottom line: the characters are DEEP, and that scores high marks for anything animated.
The action disappointed me a little. From the reviews I was expecting the battles to be long and frequent. They are neither. Fortunately, when they do occur, the action scenes are intense and keep you quite engaged until it's over. There's a healthy feeling of menace during these moments which I found to be fitting.
The animation quality was a bit lower than I expected. But I forgot, this was originally broadcast in Japan on TV, not released as a big-budget saga in U.S. theaters. Once I realized this is a TV show, not a major movie series I appreciated Evangelion more.
I'll say this for the show, it keeps you hooked! It was very hard to turn my DVD player and TV off without going to the next disk to see what happens next. I arrived at work drowsy a couple times because of late nights watching this program. Evangelion is addicting! Just be prepared for a radical change in the plot by the last two episodes of the series! It takes a patient, keen mind to understand what's going on at that point.
Overall, I'd say Neon Genesis Evangelion is just barely worth the $$$ or so needed to own it. Just barely. When the last episode is done you're left with an urge to go back and watch it all over again to try to understand everything. If you think of it that way you're at least getting you're money's worth. It's entertaining, I'll give it that.",1035504000,5,3565,4.6069182389937104

Like the nearly infinite number of Gundam's, the Lodoss series, and, of course, Evangelion.  The latter has such universal popularity that I finally decided to try it.  Put off by the price of the episodes I was attracted to this DVD, because of its two features, 'Death' was a recap of the series, and 'Rebirth' would provide some insight into its ending and meaning.
As usual, I was being optimistic.  My first viewing of 'Death' left me feeling that I had just experienced one of those shorts that were titled '26,000 Years of Art in 60 Seconds.'  It does indeed recap the high points of the series, but as a crazed rollercoaster ride - with flashbacks.  Don't get me wrong, I liked it.  However, I felt that I had watched something incredibly momentous yet utterly inexplicable.  Certainly, Evangelion is quite a bit more than the sci-fi, kid-in-a-robot series that I thought it was.  In fact, it deals with a surprising breadth of issues.  From emotional trauma to the future evolution of the human race.
What I did not realize until I read some reviews is that 'Rebirth' is actually the starting episode of 'The End of Evangelion.'  As such, I was unprepared for an apocalyptic vision of the attack on NERV headquarters, complete with the new EVA circling above like vultures.  The action and emotional pitch are intense, really a step beyond most of the films I had seen before.  Lacking any guideposts though, I found it difficult to piece together the story behind the action.  And, as in the companion piece, creator Hideaki Anno shows no mercy to the viewer.
However, the DVD includes an entire encyclopedia of Evangelion knowledge called the 'Mokuji Interactive Feature.'  This ingeniously flashes the names of people and things that I might want to know about, and provides a great deal of background data about them.  Another useful tool was an excellent running commentary on 'Rebirth' by Amanda Winn Lee (the English language Director) and friends.  I'm not a great fan of commentaries, but this was excellent, and pointed out many things I would otherwise have missed.
What this DVD did was whet my appetite and draw me into the Evangelion world.  It impressed me with both the fine artwork and characters that are far more than cardboard heroes.  It convinced me that I wanted to see the rest of 'The End of Evangelion' and all the previous episodes as well.  So for me this DVD was a great success, although I will tell anyone who asks that they would be a lot less confused if they just broke down and bought the series DVD's.  This production is probably better suited to those who are already fans of the series and are willing to keep freezing the action to examine the plentiful little details.",1035331200,26,2841,4.72210953346856
1385771,3,B000050IL8,"I think this movie is too fragmented and interrupted for someone who (like me) is a complete neophyte to the Evangelion TV series. It seems to be an ambitious summary, made by cutting/pasting small and sparse fragments of relevant chapters or events of the long series into the much more limited movie time frame.  I haven't seen the series, but just judging this movie on its own, it is way too fragmented and over-compressed.  It gave me an impression of too many omissions of important developments, and I found it somewhat frustrating to try to follow.  Obviously the makers assumed the viewers would know some things about Evangelion that I didn't know at all.  Some examples of the weak points I found: at some times the movie suddenly starts explaining (e.g. resolving) some issues as if it was perfectly clear to the viewer that those were pending issues in the plot, when I didn't even had a clue about the existence of those issues in the movie.  Also some characters are just shown in one scene, and in the next their true nature is suddenly revealed, with no development in between.  On the good side, I was particularly impressed with the musical fragments in the movie, absolutely beautiful, particularly the Bach one.  If I ever have the opportunity, I'll try to watch the first chapters of the series to get into it, instead of (or before) trying to follow this movie. I would recommend the same to anyone that is not initiated in the series.",1034899200,2,1458,4.694117647058824
1385772,5,B000050IL8,"awesome animation. the best i saw. ive watched tons of animetion. but this one is the best. i don't want to explain anything cause its hard to explain. one thing i will say is first watch THE END OF EVANGELION then youll think wut the hell is this? then watch all the rest of the series then watch THE END OF EVANGELION again then youll get the whole point. but when you watch THE END OF EVANGELION, NEVER TURN THE LIGHTS OFF!! IT WILL CAUSE SERIOUSE DAMAGE TO YOUR EYES!!
at this one part the thing flashes like mad!! it just hurts your eyes.
problem with this animetion is that sometimes it repeats the same thing over and over like 20billion times. and in episode ?? eva 01 kills this last angel but theres moment of silence for like 5minutesm, nothing happens, also when asuka and rei was in the elevator nothing happens for like 5minutes and its so boring, but never skip it. still this animetion is the best, just so good...

And to add insult to injury for all the hard-core fans (who obviously are the ones buying this DVD) they have added new speech to the re-cap section... Which in my opinion is like re-writing the bible so that the ""simple"" folk can understand it.",1034640000,,418,4.371794871794871
1385774,5,B000050IL8,"Before my friend loaned me his box set, I had thought that the best Anime ever was either Serial Experiments Lain, or perhaps Akira...  Then I saw Neon Genesis Evangelion.  I won't bother with ""Yet Another Synopsis and Review"", but instead I want to share with you why this series is so dear to me now, and ranks in my book as the best yet.
First, the Story.  The story is biblical in proportions, and hits on a number of very important philosophical, moral, ethical, and current ideals.  Who is God?  Can man become God?  Will true Armageddon be brought about by Man himself?  Is it right to do what you are told, even if what you are told is not the right thing?  The NGE Story unfolds over 24 episodes, and brings up these and many more questions.
Then the scenery.  Set almost exclusively in a futureistic Japan metropolis called Tokyo-3, the architecture, landscaping, Eva Designs, Character designs, are all done extremely well.  There is a certain flair that almost reminds me of ""My Youth in Arcadia"", or perhaps AD Police, but the picture painted is quite astonishing in its complexity and scale.  The crew of NGE created an entire, complete world, and to be honest, I could get lost in that world.
The characters.  Probably the single thing that endeared Neon Genesis Evangelion to me, are the Characters.  From the Enigmatic Ayanami Rei, to the dark, mysterious Ikari Gendo, the characters are very well thought out, very well developed, and lend a certain quality of life that you wouldnt always find in Anime, or for that matter most live action movies today...
The enigmatic Rei, so beautiful, so fragile, constantly questions her own existance, especially after she begins to realize that she is the third (see the series for an explanation.)
Hot headed Asuka comes off as being a royal pain in the butt, but as the series progresses, you find yourself caring for her deeply, as her past is revealed in snippets, showing a lifetime of pain that most people will never even be able to conceive of.  Her air of self assuredness and brash and bold style hide the true Asuka, who is in reality, on the virge of shattering, as the weight of the war with the Angels, the realization that she is NOT the best eva pilot, and the memories from her past come crashing forward to batter at the wall she has erected around her  heart.
Shinji comes early on and is the central character, although the story does give equal time to all the main characters.  He represents children everywhere who are born to parents who do not love.  Shinji's father has no real love for him, or so it seems, and only has him brought to NERV when Eva Unit 01 is ready for a pilot.  Shinji is awash in self doubt, and self loathing, having spent his entire life without a spark of self reliance.  Shinji does whatever people tell him, all to be the ""Good Boy"" living his entire life in the hopes that his father will notice him, and finally give him the praise and love that he so desperately wants.
I could go on, but since the story is about the three main children, I will leave it at that.  But trust me.  Sit down, and watch all 26 episodes, and then watch Death and Rebirth, and End of Evangelion.  You will find a world so complex, and characters so real that you will be drawn in to it.
And for the record, I did rather enjoy the original series ending  in episodes 25 and 26, althouh it left more questions than answers, and frustrated me that there was no real closure for Misato, Rei, Asuka and Touji, and I was disappointed that there was no real conclusion for Gendo Ikari...  but the movies fixed that for me...",1033776000,,3608,4.506912442396313
1385775,3,B000050IL8,"Death is a very quick recap of the series.  I didn't really care for this half of the movie.  I can watch the series over and over again and still be completely captivated by it.  I thought the ""Death"" recap was too fast and distant.  I was actually quite bored by it and found it very hard to sit through it.
Rebirth is the first 30 minutes or so of the movie.  When I ordered this I wasn't sure or not if this footage was also included on the End of Evangelion DVD or not.
*The entire ""Rebirth"" section on this disc is also on the End of Evangelion DVD.*
Before I received my copy of End of Evangeion I was extremely impressed with the ""Rebirth"" part of this movie.  I also loved the special features.  Now that I have the End of Evangelion DVD I'm pretty sure this disc will never find it's way back in my DVD player.
If you are on a tight budget and you already have or have seen the eva series this dvd is pretty pointless now that End of Evangelion has been released.  If you are a collector you should definatly get it to help complete your collection and you will probably enjoy the special features.",1033603200,11,1108,4.169014084507042
1385776,5,B000050IL8,"Death and Rebirth is, in my opinion, not the movie of the set of two you need to own.  But you should have it anyway.
The first half is mostly re-hash of the entire series, to remind people what's going on and to bring up important points.
The second is the first bit of the next movie, End of Evangelion.
Why should you get this?  Well, I don't recall for certain because I haven't watched this movie by itself recently, but I believe some of the scenes that are clips from previous episodes in the series have somewhat alternate dialogue or added effects that are worth seeing.  It also does a good job of explaining what is going to happen next and who the major players are (and why).
You should have the Evangelion series.  Or know someone who does.  And watch it.  Then you're really ready for the movies.
Anyway, this is the start of the end of everything.  17 Angels have made their moves.  SEELE is poised to fulfill their plan, and NERV, under Gendo Ikari, is the focal point.

1385777,5,B000050IL8,"... Anno's portayal of a futuristic society that deals with both physical and mental enemies is incredible.  Though it seems to focus mainly on Shinji Ikari, there is a whole cast of characters with their own points of view and importance and impact on events.  Each and every character (to a point) has some sort of story and background that makes them more than what they appear.  Above that, the show itself touches on issues of faith, beliefs, relationships, life, religion, and so forth ...
The DVD set itself isn't bad.  The image quality is superb, as is the sound quality.  And, on a major plus side, ADV does an excellent job of translation and subtitling.  It is way better than trying to figure out why the Angles are attacking and who Akura Largrey is (reference to Hong Kong DVDs and their bad subs).  The benefit of import DVDs is they have scenes included in a few episodes that really help fill in some of the holes/are extremely important, but Gainax didn't release portions of these scenes to ADV ...",1032998400,2,1018,4.622222222222222
1385778,5,B000050IL8,"I just can't believe anyone would write a bad review about Neon Genisis Evangelion! To any anime fan, this is an absloute must-see. In fact, to anyone who knows that life isn't all hunky-dory, I very strongly reccomend this. NGE starts out a little cliched, I admit. A ""normal"" boy is thrown into a life and death battle to save the world in a giant mecha, nothing new, right? The mecha, called Evangelions or Eva for short (and for a reason) HAVE FINGERNAILS!!! Does this give you an idea of how abnormal NGE is? But Eva battles are definitly NOT all of the story. It delves deep into the minds and insecurities of the human race in general, it tries to explain the inexplicable, to put it simply. I myself own almost the whole series, VHS and DVD, I wish sooooo much that I had bought the complete boxed set!
Please watch this subbed, the dubbing is just really annoying. I am almost crying because I haven't seen ""The End of Evangelion"" yet! I've seen everything else, but episodes 25 and 26 just don't sum it up well enough for me. On a more straight-forward level, NGE is rather disturbing, and not for the weak at heart. Evangelion is one of those series that, after you've watched the end, you sit around wondering what the heck they were talking about, and then you decide to watch them all over to see if you've missed some hidden meaning or something. And in fact, there are many hidden meanings to miss, there are multiple religious references that I missed and still miss even after seeing each episode at least 3 times. It is just so hard to explain what is so beautiful about Evangelion. It's just so... unrealisticly real...",1032480000,,1639,4.521885521885522
1385779,5,B000050IL8,I must admit that I bought this based solely on the rave reviews that I had read on the internet. I am glad to say that I was not dissapointed at all with this series. This is a great DVD set though I wished that they could have included more extras into the DVDs.,1032393600,,264,3.9074074074074074
1385780,5,B000050IL8,"This disc contains Death (a 60 min. recap of the characters, events, and themes of the first 24 episodes), and Rebirth (30 min. of the End of Evangelion movie).
Death is a very dramatic overview of the first 24 episodes, with a combination of music, certain dialog from the script over certain events that occurred in the series to show and explain what happened. I find it very effective and is an easy way to remind yourself of all the events instead of watching the whole series again.
Rebirth is a short introduction to the next Eva film called End of Evangelion. It starts of heated, and jumps right into the conflict and suspense. This 30 min. intro reveals some insight into Eva Unit 02, we learn of Seele and Nerv's plans for 3rd impact, and we see Shinji totally devastated now that he has killed Kawru. This is a good short for getting Eva fans siked up for the next film.
The extras on this disc are amazing! It contains a good Image gallery with pics of the characters in the most dramatic scenes. Also contains the previews for Death and Rebirth (which were very fun to watch) and End of Evangelion. One of the best features here is an encyclopedia explaining key ideas, characters, angels, and Eva's, which is very informative. There's a commentary track and an interactive feature where you watch the film, and at certain scenes you click on an item that comes on screen and it gives you detail and explanation for that scene.
Overall, I really enjoyed this DVD and would recommended it for any serious Eva fan. If you find the recaps that were in the series boring you will probably find this boring, and I would recommend you just wait until End of Eva comes out, for that new story. But, any fan with a slight interest in Evangelion will enjoy these extras, so I would say at least rent 1st if not buy, if you enjoy Eva. My only complaint is that they used different English voice actors, which didn't sound as good as the ones in the series, but overall you get used to it very quickly, and can still enjoy the film. 5 stars, enjoy.",1032048000,4,2051,4.457446808510638

If you buy the Perfect Collection and End of Evangelion, then there is no reason whatsoever to get this disc.
If you're really that desperate for Director's Cut footage, buy the Japanese DVDs. Then you get ALL of the Director's Cut footage, not just 30 seconds of it.",1031702400,20,596,4.378378378378378
1385782,4,B000050IL8,"As you all probably know or have already read in the reviews here, Death & Rebirth is only a recap of the series up to episode 24, and 20 minutes or so into End of Evangelion (Rebirth). I do not suggest viewing D&R instead of the series (it lacks alot of details, particularly many angels), but it is still recommended to watch it before End of Evangelion. Not only is it a recap, but it still is a theatrical release. It is composed and directed in such a way to create an experience all in it's own. It's also a great thing for those who wanna have a friend check it out and have him jump-started into End of Evangelion.
As to the DVD itself, i've never really been a fan of Manga's releases since they so successfully manage to take a great piece of work and make it seem like something out of the bargain bin.
I can't complain enough about the things i disliked about this release, so let me try and bullet list it for space's sake.
-No 5.1 Japanese audio track. Manga fails to realize the majority of (hardcore) anime fans prefer japanese tracks with english subtitles. Stereo just isn't enough for home theatre enthusiasts.
-Lousy video transfer. Many blurred spots throughout. If it weren't for the better quality subtitles, alot of people might think it's the unlicensed dvd (MI release for those who know what i'm talking about).
-Double-sided. Same thing on either side except for the features and audio/sub tracks. A dual-layer would've been way nicer, particularly with a good disc print.
-It wouldn't have hurt Manga to include the corresponding pictures in the character and angel profiles.
-Some mistakes in names and terms, like Kaoru on subs, Kaworu on the profile and chapter title.
-Picture Gallery is just a handful of stills from the movie itself, but apparently taken from a movie that was dragged a mile or so under a truck tire.
-Audio commentary by the English Language Director. C'mon. I would've rather had a five minute interview with Hideaki Anno.
With all the time Manga has had the license to produce this, you would've expected them to release an S.E. flooded with features. After all, it was theatrically released in Japan in '97, and this is the first time it makes it's way to the US. None the less, it's still up to DVD standards and it's the only R1 release. I just hope Manga allow themselves to break a sweat with End of Evangelion and give us something worthy of it's magnitude.",1031529600,6,2418,4.599537037037037
1385783,5,B000050IL8,"this series is just plain awesome. BE FOREWARN, YOU MUST UNDERSTAND BOTH THE VERBAL AND VISUAL RELGIOUS REFERENCES AND ANALOGIES TO TRULY ENJOY THIS AMAZING SERIES. it is not just about three 14 year old kids piloting their EVAs so as to prevent the third impact. deep down, it is way more complicated.
if you're the type who doesn't like to think and have everything explained at the end when watching a movie DO NOT get this series. however, if you're the type that can figure out what the Systema Sephiroticum painting (on the ceiling of gendo ikari's office), The Seven Eyes of Jehovah (on gendo's palm), the crazy crayon-like drawings, etc. etc. and what they symbolize than this series is definitely for you. this is the greatest anime series out now but only if you can figure out what is really going on and why the EVAs can only be piloted by the three children. if you can't see past the fighting, between the EVAs and Angels, than this series can get quite boring and isn't worth your time. i had to watch the entire series twice and four or five episodes three times in order to truly understand the series. however, it is not so complicated that one can't understand it but, at the same time, a broad knowledge of religion, an open mind, and maybe a dictionary/thesaurus will come in handy.
in my opinion, this is the second greatest anime series ever created. only barely beaten by the wonderful and unsung MAISON IKKOKU series (96 episodes) and the extremely, extremely, extremely, rare as hell movies (MAISON IKKOKU THE MOVIE, which i have [albeit of poor quality], and MAISON IKKOKU SIDE STORY, which i have yet to see or track down).",1031443200,5,1651,4.638225255972697

It revolves on the workers of a Secret Organization known as Nerv, in an apocalyptic age, that protect the Earth from surreal invaders known as Angels. In this story Nerv develops bio-machine robots that 3 children operate to defeat the 17 Angels that come to Earth, based on the prophecies in the Dead Sea Scrolls. It starts out simple enough, kill one Angel move to the next etc etc. But each new Angel is more harder to kill, and not everything at Nerv is as it seems.
This series presents many religious and philosophical questions, dealing with God, Man, his place in the world, and explores many psychological issues of modern man. It goes into an in depth look into its characters, what makes them who they are, why they are, why do they do things, what purpose do they serve, what is the meaning of their lives, and how to improve their lives and find happiness. The dialogue and questions raised can be debated many times. This is just the themes, and ideas being presented, I haven't even mentioned the intriguing story that unravels as you get further and further into the series. There is a lot of conspiracy and secrets, and things that are not as they seem. I won't spoil it here and give any of the secrets away, that would not be fair. If you enjoy Anime that makes you think, and that you can come back to, and analyze and go over many times, this is for you. The animation, battle sequences, music, all add to the quality of the story, themes, questions, and answers brought out in this series. This is a great piece of art that rewards upon multiple viewings. Bring your friends, watch, and when its all over, you'll have lots of things to talk about. 5 stars.

true gem this anime series really is. It's
all hidden and revealed only till the end of

The series relates to some theological analogies,
but that's not the real message of the series.
The true work of art lies not only in the great
animation and drawings, but in the way the author
has of making an extremely complex point across:
""Who am I and where am I going?"".
The only downsides are:
1) Characters in my opinion are a bit under-developed,
although they all have very serious mental issues! ;)
2) One or two of the episodes are *SO* boring that
you might actually stop watching the series... but don't!

1385787,4,B000050IL8,"Ok, I'm a reasonable guy. NGE is a good series, and I enjoyed watching it. But best series ever made anywhere? Hardly. The charectors in the end are barely changed from what they were at the start of the series; emotionally scared. The action is few and far between, with the battles with the angels barely taking up any plot time, and most of those battles are merely vehicles for the continued emotional problems from the main charectors social lives. The charectors are at least memorable, and the plot is certainly deep, if not too much so.
The only way I could see NGE getting 5 stars is if someone could really connect with the charectors, such as if they were going through an emotional upheval or if they felt depressed. Otherwise, the laughs are rare, the action is sparse, and the plot is more confusing than a computer manuel. But still see it; people seem to feel moved no matter what the reality is.",1031184000,2,912,4.533333333333333
1385788,5,B000050IL8,"This movie is divided in two parts - ""Death"" and ""Rebirth."" Death is a 70 minute summary of the first 24 episodes of the series - with a few new bits added in. (The running time is based on what my DVD player showed.) The movie opens with second impact about to take place. The events that follow are not shown in chronological order. They are organized by character for the most part. The events are presented as Shinji, Rei, and Asuka get ready for a strings rehearsal. (string instruments) If you're reading the manga, some events may be a little different (like what recently happened to Toji), but the main elements are the same so far. (The manga version is not completed yet - even in Japan.)
""Rebirth"" is the first 30 minutes of End of Evangelion. I guess it acts as a type of teaser for the next movie. The main fight at the end of ""Rebirth"" has some of the best animation I've seen in the series. However, after seeing this, I disagree with the use of the word ""angel"" here - except as a creative name. The series suggests it's not simply creativity. The creators of the series insisted the word ""angel"" be used in the translation even though the Japanese word has other meanings.
Even within ""Death,"" more secrets are revealed or confirmed than what was in the TV series. Truths about Eva-01 and Rei are more obvious, and we learn some interesting details about Eva-02 in ""Rebirth."" If there are any doubts, the text-based information on the Omega side of the DVD spells it all out. This is also a DVD to use the still-frame function on. There are many one second flashs of some interesting items. Near the end of ""Rebirth,"" take a close look at the entry plug on the Eva as the plane is carrying it.
This is the first DVD commentary I've listened to completely. It's three members of the English production team who appeared to have no contact with the Japanese team. They discuss some of the headaches involved with the dubbing process. The different symbols in the series are somewhat explained like how the Evas are based on Babylonian gods. Because of how serious and intense the show can be, there is some joking around. ...with Amanda Winn Lee commenting on how much hate mail they're going to get after certain comments. Amanda does the voice of Rei, and has also done voice acting for the dubbed versions of Gunsmith Cats and Blue Seed.
Most of the original English cast is here. They were unable to get some actors because they simply could not locate them. The substitutes do a very good job - even for Kaworu.
At the beginning, there is about a minute's worth of logos connected with the release of this movie. There is not a chapter stop at the end of them so if you want to skip them, you have to scan forward unless you want to miss part of the movie.
The DVD has the original Japanese with subtitles and English. For the English track, some sound effects were redone or enhanced. There is an English 5.1 track. There are no English titles during the credits. That kinda bugged me at first because I didn't know they were credits. All story related text has been translated. Even though parts have been dubbed before, everything has been redone here. For ""Death,"" they didn't simply borrow from the English track from the TV series. The pronounciation of the word ""Eva"" changed in the English version. In the TV series, they said ""ay-va,"" now it's more like ""eh-va.""
Unlike the TV series DVDs, there are no French or Spanish tracks here.
Essentially, you can get the entire story by watching the series and End of Evangelion. This DVD is not required. For a true fan, this is still a nice DVD. There is commentary on ""Death"" which the TV series does not have. Plus, Second Impact events are actually shown - not just the wings extending from the explosion. The actual experiments are not shown, but you get voices on a radio talking about it as it's happening. You also have a radio or phone conversation between Asuka and Kaji before she arrives. Most of the new items are before the opening titles. There are a few other items scattered throughout. There should be no major surprises for anyone who has seen the series, but you do get a few additional details.",1030924800,2,4188,4.533685601056803
1385789,4,B000050IL8,"Death is just a recap of the entire series. It can be skipped. Rebirth, on the other hand, is a 23 minute necessary set up for the End of Eva. It's a tall price to pay for 23 minutes of new footage, but worth it if you are a fan of the series.
As most people reading this will probably know, the t.v. series ending of Evangelion so enraged both fans and creators, that this direct to video alternate ending was produced. I really enjoy the alternate ending to the series, but it is only properly enjoyed in one sitting with ""End of Eva"" (I've had a fan sub of it for quite some time). After watching the entire series about 8 times with both endings, I can't really say which ending I like better. The original one does sit well after viewing a few times. Each ending leaves the viewer with very distinct things to think about.
As a die hard Eva fan, you won't be able to resist buying this in order to see the other ending; but I strongly urge you to restrain from actually watching it until you can see the entire ending in one sitting, when you have both a copy of this and ""End of Eva"" in your hands.
As far as the story of Rebirth: Messed Up! Violent. Nasty. Mean. No pulled punches. Psychological torment. Basically, what you've come to expect from the creators of this series. Unfortunately, you MUST see Rebirth. It sets up an incredible cliff hanger for the next disc.",1030838400,,1377,4.3
1385790,2,B000050IL8,"Everyone rants and raves about how great Neon Genesis Evangelion is .  Well chances are they haven't seen the series as a whole.  It's not great.  Hell , it's barely watchable.  The plot is semi-interesting , but falls into that ... stereotypical japanese teens-pilot-big-giant-robots genre.  It's gets pretty tiresome.  At least in Gundam Wing , there were SANE people piloting the suits. Shinji is a disturbed little boy who is given the chance to pilot the EVA because a certain generation of teens (that he is part of) are the only ones with the right type of minds to pilot the suits.  Viewers will instantly hate Shinji for his inept and childish actions. Wait , let's check that genre checklist again.  ""Reluctant"" teen pilot ? Check. Pilot is prone to beserker ""rages"" which make him super-powerful? Check.
Thank god , the other supporting characters are there to save the series.  Shinji's caretaker , Misato,  a blue-haired beauty , is easy on the eyes and Shinji's male friends are a bunch of perverted teens who are only concerned with scoring.
The EVA pilots themselves are generally quite messed up in the head and only start piloting with some degree of expertise well into the series.  The character developement in the series is non-existent, Shinji is still his same old cowardly , fear-ridden , mentally-disturbed self  by the end.
Onto the DVD's .  The discs have four languages on each , which is pretty fun to listen to the VA's differences. The Japanese VA's are obviously the best , but prepare yourself , there are some genuinely aggravating parts where characters repeat the same word 20 times in a row , more and more louder. The audio and video quality is quite acceptable.  Buy the box set only if you don't want to waste the money on buying several DVD's seperately.
Fine , I admit , it's ones of those you should probabely watch just for the hellava it.  It's one of those good-old benchmarks for anime series, so watch it so you can compare to the numerous other far superior anime series.",1030665600,4,2021,4.717948717948718
1385791,2,B000050IL8,"The first section of this movie is merely a recap of the TV series. There's some new footage of Shinji, Rei, Asuka, and Kaworu at a quartet rehearsal sprinkled in here and there... but there's no dialogue during these segments and it isn't important in terms of the narrative. I can see why this was released theatrically in Japan; The TV series had originally been broadcast in late 1995 and early 1996. By the time the End of Evangelion movie was to hit theaters in 1997, many TV viewers would have been in need of a quick refresher course on the series. But for those of us in the US who had to buy and own the series and can watch it at will, it just doesn't seem neccessary.

The second section is actually the first 20 minutes of End of Evangelion, which will be released in the US this fall.

The bottom line is, if you already own the series, you can skip this D&R and save your money, and spend it on EoE instead. You won't be missing anything crucial.",1030320000,,961,4.274725274725275
1385792,5,B000050IL8,"First off, no, this is not a 'new' movie. The vast, vast majority of it is clips from the first 24 episodes. So right away, if you didn't like the original episodes, you won't like this movie. Second, this movie is erratic and is done in such away that it is more a collage of images rather then a plot driven movie. So be prepared for that (if you didn't like the last 2 episodes, you won't like this movie).
But for those of us who did like those episodes, who recognized them for the artistic, philosophical, psychological genius that they were, this movie is a god send. It is pure anno. He juxtaposes harsh images together, and ties them together with the universal themes he developed in the show. All set to the most beautiful baroque music you'll hear (I've had an obsession with Bach since I watched it).
The DVD itself is, quiet simply, the best I've ever seen from an Anime publisher. There is a commentrary track that is pretty good (it illuminates much of the religious symbolism I missed), an extremely helpful Eva Encyclopedia, and menus to die for. It would be worth the full $$$, frankly.
To reinerate: If you didn't like the series, you'll hate this movie (and most likely End of Evangelion, really). If you did like the show, there's only a chance you'll like this movie. But for those of us that left NGE a little changed, this movie is perfect.",1029888000,,1365,4.485943775100401
1385793,5,B000050IL8,"This is a good movie! Wanna know why? Read on.
If you've seen the first 24 episodes of Evangelion then you've seen MANY shots from Death, the first portion of this release. Yes, that's right, this film is mostly a recap of the TV series, but you have not experienced a recap like this! Believe me! The reason: the order of the scenes is non-linear, so what you get is a retelling that is out of chronological order; instead, certain characters and themes develope one at a time through related scenes that were once episodes apart. On top of that, you get a number of sequences that WERE NOT in the ADV release of the show, scenes which are available in Japan in the fabled Evangelion Director's Cut Episodes (Episodes 21-24 with some redone scenes and other completely new shots. These were commisioned AFTER the completion of the show; they are not outtakes. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise). If you can't get a fansub of the Director's Cut, or are intrigued by the idea of a non-linear recap, GET THIS MOVIE!
Additionally, there is an awesome 30 minute preview of the finalw of the show, End Of Evangelion (this section of the movie is called Rebirth). If you hated the infamous first ending, you should be blown away by this one. If you loved the original closing (like I did), be sure to give the new one a whirl. It's just as good as those original episodes. If you can't wait until the End Of Evangelion release, then Death & Rebirth is a must have (just for Rebirth).
All in all, there is but one flaw in this amazing package and it's a minor one. Despite the fact that Death is a recap, do not think that it can be used as an introduction to the show. It is completely unintelligable to anyone who doesn't know what's going on! To these people, it would be like reading the pages of a novel in random order. Not fun (or so I imagine... really!). But, like I said, it's a minor flaw to anyone who's seen the entire show.",1029715200,,1932,4.399441340782123

Heres the lay of the land the year is 2015, 15 years earlier a catastrophic event known as the ""second-impact"" obliterated a good portian of the human race. what caused the seconf impact? well the public was told it was an asteroid hitting the pole causing the ocean to rise. However, the government actually covered up what happened and released that story to the public. what really caused it was a being called an ""Angel,"" named Adam exploding. after this happened Nerv a government organizatti0on was formed, here a they created machines to fight the angels called evangelions. they can be piloted by 14 year old children. after the second impact more angels appear and start to try to get into NERV. then they recruit Shinji the ""Third Child"" who pilots unit 1 and stops the angels. he starts off with 1 other girl who pilots an evangelion, and three mnore children join eventually. the series has great depth and drama, its not another Gundam copy. this thing has a quality that most animes lack.

1385797,5,B000050IL8,"Since I was a kid, I've always been a fan of anime.  From watching the old episodes of Robotech in the early 80's, being blown away by the mastery of Akira, to almost suffering a heart attack when I first set my eyes on Ghost and the Shell.  But with all my love for anime, I never really collected it (mostly cause I was broke).  But when I got a little older I began to collect as many anime tapes as possible. Going from series to series, cluttering my shelves with so many tapes.  But within my collection, I've never really dove into the giant robot fighting genre.  It wasn't until searching in the AnimeFan section of my GameFan magazine (mind you this was a long time ago since that mag doesn't exist anymore) I would always see a series that, above all other anime titles reviewed this month, would get scores like: A, A, A, B+, A, A-, B, consecutively.  And that series was Evangelion.  So out of curiosity I picked up the first tape.  People, within the first 30 minutes a tear slowly fell from my eyes.  If you've read any of my other reviews you'll know I'm not a big fan of writing spoilers in my reviews so read on freely.
Story:  The basic overview of Evangelion is this:  The earth has been desolated by attacks my creatures known as Angels.  An organization known as NERV located in Toyko-3 has been given the task of defeating them when they appear.  The weapons of choice are large mechanical suits known as Eva's, where the Eva-pilots are young children.  That overview simply those no justice to what Evangelion touches on.  The story is the BEST out there even today.  I've seen no other anime series (in this genre) that has rivaled the story aspects of Evangelion, not even Gundam (yes I said it).  Evangelion goes and ask the question: who are humans? What are our limitations?  And who are the Angels?  Why are they here?  And you would be asking this question no doubt throughout the entire series until the very last episode.  But it is in that very last episode that you will be highly disappointed.  I will explain what I mean in my conclusion.
Characters:  The characters of Evangelion are superb.  The English voice dubbing (whatever anyone else tells you) is good.  They fit the characters perfectly.  Shinji, the lead character, is sort of a distorted young boy trying to please everyone else around him. Why?  No, no, no, not letting that slip: WATCH THE SERIES!!!.  Asuka will have you rolling with the way her characters treats Shinji and all the others with her Texas accent and wild charm.  But it is one character, one that steals the show easily, is Rei.  Now, I won't go into her.  Won't give you a glimpse into her character.  You simply have to watch her and see how she evolves in this series.  You will be HIGHLY impressed and that tear will go rolling down your eye as it did mine when I seen her for the first time.  Trust me on this.
Animation: SUPERB!!!!!! This is the what has pulled so many people into Evangelion because the animation sooooooo beautiful.  The fight scenes are fantastic.  You will not see better fight scenes than this anywhere else.  The animation was so detailed it was too real to be true.  It rivaled Akira in everyway, and Evangelion is a series not a theatrical movie like Akira (though to be fair, Akira was released in 1988 and Evangelion came to us in 1995).  You will NEVER be disappointed by what you see. It is simply masterful.
Conclusion:  Evangelion has many things going for it except for one thing.  It was the way the series concluded that had many fans who spent 25 episodes being blown away to get an ending that was so out of place and simply weird. BUT FEAR NOT.  By the time you read this Evangelion: Death & Rebirth would have already been released on DVD.  The movie takes place in two parts.  Death retells the story of the series where Rebirth is a redone ending of the series giving us Evangelion fans the ending we deserved.  But it doesn't end there.  On September 25th of this year, Evangelion: End of Evangelion will be released.  What this is, is another ending, well, more like an extended ending of the Rebirth continuing where it left off. The movies main purpose is to give Evangelion a chance to conclude on the right note, I'm proud to give it  all 5 that it deserves.  You will NOT find an anime series out there like this.  Do yourself a favor:  Look up, then a little  to the right and click on that BUY button.  You'd be doing yourself a grand favor.  Evangelion will impress you in every respect.  It is simply a masterpiece.",1029283200,5,4540,4.470731707317073

1385801,4,B000050IL8,"Now, I love this series, I don't watch much anime, if any, at all. But I enjoyed this confusing series quite alot. But the problem here isn't the series, no, not at all. The problem is here is with the company that made this box-set possible, ADV. I am not saying I am not happy about having this series brought into America, I am complaining that ADV put little to no features on these discs. The video quality is sub-par and could have been better, as well.
In my opinion ""menu selections"" are not special features and should NOT be included on the back of the tape to look like there's more features than there really are. The only features here are character profiles (about 4-5 per disc) and trailers for other animes. Those trailers are nice... Well some of them, but it's still advertising. We wanted, no, we NEEDED other features! Commentary would be nice. I also wish they added more episodes per disc, the first 2 discs have 4 episodes each... While the other 6 have 3 each! COME ON! I could understand this if you made the video quality like the Cowboy Bebop discs! But these are mediocre DVD's! ADV are greedy, ignorant people. Advertising for themselves, being lazy when manufactoring the discs, and now: ONLY PUTTING 3 EPISODES ON A DISC THAT COSTS 25 DOLLARS?! That's robbery.
Anyway, let's talk about the actual discs. If you haven't bought any of the discs yet... Then get this package, if you're like me and have already bought 3 discs when this box-set came out, then find a website which only sells the box, if you can (I don't remember where I got mine: but it was like 15 dollars.) The box-art is pretty nice, nothing like the ""End of Evangelion"" or ""Death and Rebirth"" boxes, though, (those weren't supplied and manufactored by ADV).
One thing I wish they put more effort in would be the linear note (the booklet). It's just a thin sheet of paper with the an alternative box-art design drawn on it. On the other side of the paper it has the chapters... I wish they put more effort into this, just calling all episodes the same chapter title. The opening of the show is called ""Opening"". The very beginning is called ""Beginning of show"". The halfway point in the video is called ""Midpoint"". Get the idea? There are no original names for any of the chapters.
The series is great in the original Japanese dialogue, watch it that way. The English dialogue isn't horrible like other dubs... I prefer watching things the way they were meant to be broadcasted in. Oh well, I can't complain, it's a great anime. I just wish it had better treatment. Go ahead and buy this set, it's a great series and it needs more American fans.
It could have been worse, it could have been manufactored by Funimation... Meaning that all of it would be edited and you wouldn't be able to watch it in Japanese! So I say we work with what we got. Buy this box-set today! Or whenever you can afford it!

1385802,3,B000050IL8,"Death and Rebirth is simply a recap of the whole Neon Genesis: Evangelion series followed by the first 15 minutes of End of Evangelion, an alternate ending to the series. You don't exactly need this DVD, as it doesn't really contain anything new, and the 15 minutes of End of Evangelion contained in Rebirth is also included in End of Evangelion. Most of the footage in Death is included in the series also. It's pretty cool, just an unnecessary addition to the series. I got it for collector's sake. It is a good thing to have if you can't remember everything that happened in the series and want to refresh your memory. The music is good too.",1028851200,,644,4.512820512820513

 All in all, Evangelion is a masterpice at work both with music and its controversal story lines that makes this series the best in show. and with the DVD which gives you a certain feature that you can get more info on the characters and the Angels that attack during the previous series this is something worth getting for the true fan at heart or just for someone who is starting out in the series..I say its better than buying the entire collection that is very expensive cause it IS the entire collection and recap all in one but its a suggestion that you should get the entire series to understand the gist of it.
 But I must warn you..teh final series is one of the most saddest and graphic of them...cause it deal with alot of sad events all at once and it leaves you in a cliffhanger for the next movie ""The End of Evangelion"" which I hope will explain more and I would suggest for any body who feels the same way but all in all this IS a worth while get!!",1028678400,,1538,4.123333333333333
1385804,3,B000050IL8,"I purchased this DVD today, and frankly, I am disappointed. I have been waiting a long time for a North American release of the Evangelion movie(s), and had hoped that such a behemoth title would demand a quality release. Manga has, on the other hand, produced a sub-par product; although many will agree that this is not an uncommon occurrance with Manga DVD releases, this is Evangelion, people; do it right!
What made it so dismal, you ask?
1) Video transfer was never above average, and at some points poor, during 'Death' portion of the film.
2) A 5.1 audio track is included, but only in dubbed English; for those of us who like to enjoy our anime in its original Japanese form, we are relegated to a simple stereo audio track.
3) Instead of opting for a multilayer disc, Manga has released this as a double-sided disc -- no label, people. Film is on one side, ""Extras"" reside on the other. This causes two problems:
i) It becomes difficult to handle the disc without fingerprinting a data layer, and
ii) It has forced Manga to label the sides using a small ring on the interior of the disc, bordering the ""hole"", in dark letters on a black background; this, of course, makes it even more difficult than it already is to spot the small text. One more note on the labeling: the sides are labeled ""alpha"" and ""omega"" -- why? Why not label them as ""Film"" and ""Extras"", or anything less obscure than ""alpha"" and ""omega""?
4) This will more than likely not be a problem for most of you, but it definitely was for me; my old, first generation RCA DVD player cannot play the ""Extras"" (omega?) side of the disc. It loads, displays the Manga logo, and dumps me back to the DVD Player Menu with an error stating that the disc ""May Contain Bad Data"". This side does, however, play correctly in 2 other DVD solutions I have tested, which causes me to wonder about this problem. (Side note: there have been issues with other Manga DVDs performing in this fashion -- the Street Fighter movie, for example.)
There are, of course, positive aspects of this disc too. Though it may seem trivial, the cover art is beautiful. The video transfer for the 'Rebirth' section of the film is excellent, and the subtitles are fairly unobtrusive. (Note: the subtitles do, however, contain some typographical and grammatical errors; watch for ""it's"" instead of the correct ""its"" in some places.)
Overall, this disc is not terrible, but does not live up to the standards that I, and I believe many other fans of Evangelion, expected it to. Buy it, and enjoy it -- the film itself is fantastic -- but don't expect stellar quality from this Manga release; it's just not there.
(PS: I apologize for not being able to review the ""Extras"" section of this release; as you have read, it just was not feasible. I am sure that there are useful reviews right here on Amazon that will contain detailed information regarding the extras.)",1028678400,,2900,4.600386100386101

I've seen the whole movie and the only thing interesting was the 4.23 minute intermission and the string quartet! This is definately NOT a movie for avid eva watchers. The only thing it does is shows the characters information and large events from the series but not in chronological order. Also, it gives the first 20 minutes of the movie that comes out in teh US in mid september. DEfinately, if you're an eva fan watch the series and then watch ""The End of Evangelion"".... Death and Rebirth is ridiculous and a waste of money for true fans.",1028592000,2,828,4.280254777070064
1385806,5,B000050IL8,"Besides being a more lucid and a more entertaining ending than the last TV episode was, it made the previous Evangelion episodes tie together into a much better finale.
The movie is divided into two stories ""Death"", and ""Rebirth"". ""Death"" is a recap of all of the Evangelion episodes defining the characters, the situations, and the events that got them there. ""Rebirth"" is what happens after the last ""Angel"" is defeated.
""Rebirth"" is very violent and is not for children. The violence is there as a plot device rether than for entertainment value.
The circumstance that brings on the violence is that NERV headquarters is under attack because the body politic of planet earth now fears the potential abject power that Nerv has with the EVA units. Hence, all NERV personel are targets, especially the EVA pilots. And subsequently these children are targeted to be killed.
No spoilers here, but during the melee, a particular EVA pilot has a wonderful epiphany and just shreds her foes hardware into ""razor blades"".  I also liked the scene whereas Misato rescues a particular EVA pilot in a dramatic shoot out!
The English voice acting has greatly improved.  Perhaps it was the budget, maybe the fan criticism of the previous episodes made the actors take note, or maybe it's the way it is edited together, I can't figure it out. Nonetheless it is a great improvement.
The musical score is beautiful. Thumbs up to Sagisu Shiro who oversaw Bethoven's 9th, Pachabel's Canon and I think a Bach concerto.
The movie ends with a cliff hanger and I am looking forward to next one.
""Death and Rebirth"" is a double sided DVD. (Something I have never seen before since DVDs are new to me.) The user interface, though stylish, was a bit ""clunky"" for me but it does have this really neat option called ""MOKUJI INTERACTIVE"". Mokuji is Japanese for 'contents' and if you activate it, pop-ups will appear on screen to define concepts or plot points in finer detail.  So when a character says ""Instrumentality Project"", a pop up appears and you can get all of the info about it and then seamessly jump back into the film where you left off.
I hope this review was helpful.

1385807,5,B000050IL8,"Evangelion is undoubtably one of the most original mecha series to come out of Japan in a while. With that in mind, Evangelion became immensily popular, despite it's very disturbing imagery and storytelling. Therefore, when this double-feature arrived in theaters, it obviously drew a huge crowd.
Death and Rebirth is sort of a look back and forward at the Evangelion saga. Evangelion Death is not really a compilation of the series, but more of musical montage. It starts out with new footage of the Second Impact and eventually goes through a couple of scenes that were deleted from the TV series. Evangelion Rebirth is actually the first third of the End of Evangelion film. The point of this is so that the audiance can get a taste of what to come. And if this doesn't entice you to see the End of Evangelion film, nothing will.
What was a little surprising for me was that Manga entertainment kept everything of this title in tact. Everything from the original film is here. Even the 5 minute intermission sequence is kept in. But what really surprised me was they kept one of the most contriversial scenes in the film. Which is obviously the scene where Shinji is in Auska's hospital room (nuff said).
The English dub of Death and Rebirth is really a mixed bag. Some of the voices are from the original series and some are not. Even more, the roars of the Evangelion had to be dubbed cause they were on the Japanese language track only. I am still pretty impressed at how great a job Spike Spencer does with Shinji in Death and Rebirth.
Manga Entertainment pulled out all the stops on this DVD. First of all, the disc is double sided. The first side features the feature film and the second side has the extras. The extras include Maji Files, which has everything you want to know on Evangelion in there, Audio Commentary by the English cast (pretty funny), original trailers (makes it worth buying) and the End of Evangelion trailer. What more could you possibly want a DVD?
Overall, Evangelion Death and Rebirth is one of Manga's best DVD features ever. If you can't wait for End of Evangelion (who can?) then get this now. Even if you already have seen it, go out and buy it still. It's worth it.",1028332800,3,2205,4.598984771573604
1385808,5,B000050IL8,"This movie is a great homage to the Evangelion series.  A lot of the scenes are redrawn and look amazing.  You almost take it for granted it looks so much like the original scenes.  While, you only see a little bit of new footage, it's really cool to see all your favorite scenes put together all fancy.  If you only want the 15 minutes of End of Eva you should probably wait till End of Eva comes out because it will most likely be included on it.  Thank god Manga got a hold of this instead of ADV.",1028246400,,500,4.061224489795919
1385809,2,B000050IL8,"Ok, I'll cut to the chase: this disk is about 70% recycled content. Basically, they have taken the series and boiled it down to an hour and 30 minutes or so. Mind you, it is the better parts of the series, all brought together, but really, do we need to pay to see that after we've bought the whole series?
My take is that they sought to break up the real movie (End of Evangelion) on to two disks in order to jack the price. The last 30-40 minutes is new stuff that tells of the story after the Angels are all defeated (read the synopsis). It IS fantastic stuff, probably best action in the series. The problem is that it ends at a completely arbitrary point that can hardly be called a cliff-hanger. Manga entertainment should have just added this to the End of Evangelion and called that the moive.
One final gripe: the movie is in wide-screen, but it is not anamorphic.

I'd recommend this DVD to all Evangelion Fans but I won't be recommending End of evangelion as I believe this to be a total waste of time, deep evangelion fans my disagree but I personally find the deep meaning religious overload of an ending a bit well...totally OTT and a mess of what was going on in the directors head at the time.

Be warned, if all you're after in an anime is action and a quick buzz of coolness, this show probably isn't for you.  I've watched the entire series from front to back almost five times, and I still don't understand the whole thing.  However, if you're willing to accept EVA in its entirety, this is one awesome show!

1385813,5,B000050IL8,"For the record, I am not a huge fan of Anime. Maybe I am looking in the wrong places, but everytime I start to watch a series it ends up as mindless action or mindless comedy. I've only seen 2 that can truly be called intellectual. Serial Experiment: Lain was one. Neon Genesis Evangelion is the other.
I cannot say enough good about this series. It it quite simply the best piece of work to ever have been broadcast. Anywhere. Nothing to come out of America, nothing to come out of Japan, nothing anywhere can meet the sheer brilliance of the 26 episodes of this most disturbing, heartwarming, and beautiful anime.
Evangelion starts out simply enough. Ikari Shinji is a 14-year old boy who gets called upon to pilot a giant mecha, called an Evangelion. He, Rei, and Asuka are the three children that have the ability to pilot these machines. Simple enough, right? The first 3/4's of the series deals with the relationship between these 3 and the various leaders of NERV, the organization they work with. It is highly entertaining, beautifully drawn, and very engaging. Alot of the middle episodes are very light hearted, and nothing too fantastic, but enjoyable in their own right.
It is in the last quater of the series that it becomes brilliant. Shinji, Asuka, Rei, and Misato (one of the leaders of NERV) become very introspective. By this point their back stories and personalities are developed beyond any rational expectation. I don't want to spoil the moving experience of this anime, but let me just say that it is incredibly philosophical, psychological, and depressing.
Oh, and for the love of all that is holy, DO NOT listen to anyone who tells you not to watch the last 2 episodes. They are, simply put, fools. The last 2 episodes are jarring, disturbing and very hard to watch. They do not give perfect closer to the whole series (don't worry Plot [enthusiasts], End of Evangelion, due out in September ties up all the loose ends). But they made the series for me. You have to see it to believe it and I am not going to spoil it by saying anything more. Just trust that it is simply breathtaking...",1027209600,125,2112,4.649732620320855
1385814,2,B000050IL8,"I enjoyed the Evangelion series, but was sorely disappointed by the ending.  Not only is it disjointed and largely incomprehensible, but it is a profound anticlimax, the series deserves better.  As the plot becomes less involved in external events (which rapidly begin to leave behind the strictures of even the most basic logic anyway) and more in the minds of the characters (always my lease favorite part of the series) we are forced to deal with more of the least attractive parts of the series, Shinji's whiny self-absorption, Rei's withdrawl from reality, and Asuka's bipolar depression and rage.  If you liked the series up to this point, stop before watching this ""ending"" - whatever you may imagine as the end has to be better than what they came out with.",1027209600,,765,4.869230769230769
1385815,3,B000050IL8,"With the controversial ending of Neon Genesis Evangelion, it is easy to see why no one liked it. It doesn't quite end on a cliffhanger, but instead of answering questions, it simply asks more questions without really answering any of them. For this same reason, I expect many people to not enjoy Death and Rebirth. Very few questions are answered, and what's more, very little of the animation is original. The one department which this excels is in the editing. Death and Rebirth is to Evangelion as uncut heroin is to the heroin that is actually injected. It concentrates the essential parts of the twenty-six episodes in the series into a couple hours. If you don't want to watch the entire twenty-six episode series in order to understand The End of Evangelion, then this will be a great primer. If, however, you have already have your suspicions on how Shinji, the Human Instrumentality Project, SEELE, and the Angels fit together, I recommend waiting until The End of Evangelion comes out so it can warp your thinking even more.",1027036800,4,1034,4.814606741573034
1385816,5,B000050IL8,"One of the most popular Japanese animation's of all time, ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" is given star treatment from Manga Entertainment who own the rights of the first half to the conclusion of the series.
When I say star treatment, Manga Entertainment delivers because this is perhaps one of the most beautiful anime on DVD at this time. Not only is it packed with special features galore (which is surely lacking in anime DVD's), it also features a Mokuji Interactive feature for the seasoned Evangelion fans eager to know more about the series. Also, it features an awesome menu screen that makes you just want to kick back and just watch. Beautifully designed!
Before I go on to the special features, a little background on this film. In 1997, Gainax released ""Death & Rebirth"" which are two films and the first half of the conclusion to ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" (the second and final conclusion is the ""The End of Evangelion"" film).
Originally, fans were not to happy with the final episodes of Evangelion and the truth is, how can a series like Eva be completed in a 30-minute episode. Thus, ""Death & Rebirth"" was first released.
The first half of the film starts out with ""Death""; an orchestrated retelling of episodes 1 through 24 which includes new animated sequences and insight into the personal worlds of the characters conceived by the series' director Hideki Anno.
The second half of the film is ""Rebirth""; where we see an alternate vision of episode 25 of the original series. In this version, SEELE (the secret international organization behind the development of both the Evangelion project and the Human Complementation Project) is concerned about how the projects' director, Ikari Gendo, is proceeding. Convinced that Gendo is implementing his own plans, they decide to wrest control of the projects, capture EVA Unit-01 and to undertake a full-scale invasion of Central Dogma and to literally destroy NERV using the nine-production model Evangelions.
For followers of the television series, the films are a must and ""Death & Rebirth"" is a wonderful first half which many Evangelion fans will be proud of.
But even more, Evangelion fans will be proud of the DVD. This DVD should set a high standard for anime DVD's with simply the most beautiful menu I have ever seen on an anime DVD and also packed with features which include, the English and Japanese trailers for the film, audio commentary by the English language director and voice actress of Rei Ayanami, Amanda Win Lee. An indepth index of characters, Angels, Evas and Terms, photo gallery, the End of Evangelion preview and much more.
The DVD is featured in 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Sound (English only) and is in letterbox format. The film sounds beautiful with its awesome soundtrack and action scenes. The Japanese stereo track is available as well as English subtitles for dialogue and on-screen text.
As for those who worry that their favorite English dub actors may be different with this Manga Entertainment release, they shouldn't because all key roles in the English language version of ""Death and Rebirth"" are reprised by the voice-actors from the ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" series.
The true gem is the Mokuji Interactive Feature which allows the viewer to select from an on-screen, chapter specific index of Eva-related terms, character descriptions and other valuable information while viewing the film.
This DVD in our mind is worthy of an A+ and should set a standard in showing the anime industry how anime DVD's should be. A beautiful film and a high quality DVD. Highly recommended!

strange, yet truly mindblowing.",1026172800,,525,4.9772727272727275
1385820,4,B000050IL8,"Outside of DBZ, Tenchi, and other cartoon network-popularized anime shows, Evangelion is probably the biggest thing out there. Any anime fan, casual or obsessive, knows about it, and it's one of the most greatly loved (and occasionally hated) shows there is.
 The plot centers around the organization Nerv and its efforts to eradicate the mysterious and seemingly hostile ""Angels"" using the Evas (giant robots at first glance) and their fourteen-year old pilots. The necessity of fourteen-year olds is never explained, but it's through the eyes of one such pilot, Shinji Ikari, that we're introduced to the show. Shinji is joined by the ultra-quiet Rei Ayanami and the arrogant and dominating Asukah Langley Sohryu in piloting the Evas. Their guardian Misato, the scientist Ritsuko, Misato's ex-boyfriend Kaji, and Shinji's father Gendo round out the main characters.

 Evangelion's cast is one of its strongest points. Some criticize Shinji for his total lack of toughness and resolve, but he occupies an important place in the cast's emotional layout. He's balanced by his father, as Gendo is incredibly cold, calculating and decisive. Rei and Asukah are also polar opposites, and their interaction is well done. Asukah loves to be bossy but is annoyed by Rei's apparent indifference. The legendarily sexy Misato is possibly the show's most memorable character. She's carefree, messy, and irresponsible, and when Kaji enters the picture sparks immediately fly. Ritsuko is quiet but intense and she knows a lot, but often seems to play the role of a major background character.
 Put together, this is an incredibly memorable lot, and the show throws them in interesting and conflicting situations frequently. They're also very well acted with Megumi Hayashibara contributing a little star power as Rei. Evangelion also has the best dub I've ever heard. It's probably the only show that I might actually prefer to watch in English. Character rating: 5/5.
 It's in terms of plot Evangelion starts to slide. There are basically two sides to this show. First is the fairly light-hearted and character-driven side. The episodes typically include an Angel attack and a fight (the fight scenes are excelently done), but they also come with healthy doses of humor. None of this is terribly complex, but it's very fun. It makes up about the first three-fifths of the show. But from there, the show changes. It becomes more heavy and atmospheric and while this is handled well from the emotional side, the plot becomes somewhat aimless. The angels are still there, but there are increasing references to events and things that were never really well defined in the first place (the creator made a good deal of this up as he went along). We also start getting plenty of somewhat obscure and probably meaningless religious references and symbolism, which only makes matters worse. So Evangelion winds up sort of tapering off at the end, and it doesn't help that we get virtually no character closure at all (most characters are in some stage of psychological crisis by this point). Finally, there are the last two episodes. You've probably already heard something about these. They really don't seem connected to the main show at all. They primarily consist of one of the characters sitting in a chair in a darkened room being asked questions to the tone of: ""who are you?"" and ""how do you know you're you?"". A few people really like these episodes, but I consider them mainly off the subject and fairly interminable. I've heard that Hideaki Ano was having some psychological problems of his own at the time, so much of this was his attempts at working out his own problems. I don't know how accurate this is, but it makes sense. It's too bad the series had to end this way.
 All in all though, Evangelion is pretty good. My long-winded assessment of the last several episodes in all likelihood made the series sound worse than it is. I love the characters, and I like much of the plot. This series is a fine buy, although it's mainstream enough that you might be able to rent a few tapes to start. I don't really like the format of these DVD's, but you do get French and Spanish language versions in addition to the standard English and Japanese.
Evangelion is a pretty good series if not a great one, and if you don't go in expecting a brilliant plot build-up and climax you probably won't be dissapointed.",1026000000,6,4397,4.9271255060728745
1385821,5,B000050IL8,"Anyone who is a huge fan of Eva has found some way or another to see death and rebirth and or end of evangelion. Around a year ago (I forget exactly) I rented an import (fan sub) death and rebirth and then a couple months later I got end of Eva. Even though I've seen both movies, I won't be held back from getting both movies when they come out (July 30 and September 24 respectively). These are two of the best anime releases to date along side of princess mononoke. To like this movie you need to have liked the series. If you didn't like the series, don't except your feelings to change and if you haven't seen the series don't bother watching the movie cause you'll just get lost or you'll find yourself not caring about the characters as much as you should.
The movies were created because fans of the series complained about the two final episodes of the series (I personally liked them). To give the fans what they wanted, the creators of the series began the framework of a movie. The movie would be made up of two 45-minute episodes, which would take place at the same time as episodes 25 and 26. Sadly after the completion of the first episode, gainax ran out of money (again), so the movie was split into two parts: death and rebirth, which is a half hour series recap with a couple of deleted scenes along with the first half of the movie. The second have is end of Eva, which is the whole movie.
The rebirth part of death and rebirth begins with a broken shinji and an auska whose mind had been raped in an earlier episode. After one of the most talked about Eva moments takes place, we move on to see the nerv invasion by seele. The invasion was an attempt by seele to speed of the process of causing the third impact.
What you see in the first (and for that matter the second) movie is far harsher then what you've seen in the series. There is a ton of violence and gore done onto both humans and angels. There is also a lot of (non sexual) nudity and a scene of masturbation. The rating has a very strong chance of being R or 17+. Does this mean younger Eva fans shouldn't see the movie? No, it doesn't. I think all Eva fans should see these movies. It just means that younger fans may have a slightly harder time getting their hands on the movies then on the TV series.",1025654400,4,2287,4.247706422018348
1385822,3,B000050IL8,"Evangelion series has undeniably gained a lot of fans throughout the world, but I wonder whether different features of the series has won differet kind of fans.  Through seeing the DVD edition from ADV I reaffirm myself among the fans who were attracted by the visual artistry depicted in the series.  OK, it is great and visually outstanding mecha action scenes.  But I deplore the slowness of the two last chapters.
As for the plot, this series doesn't fail to arise immediate interest from the audience from the very beginning,  but it all the same fails to round up comfortably the ideas exposed about myth and religion (orthodox christianity,gnosticism and babylonic religions all mixed up!!)
As far as the animation features are involved I would recommend this DVD set as a see-again series (subtitled seen you got the feelings better,I don't recommend the English-dubbed version).  On the contrary, if you are the insight-seeker type, you might not feel as satisfied.",1025568000,2,974,5.0625
1385828,2,B000050IL8,"There are those that prasie this series very highly. Well it's time for something different. Haveing watched the series, I can only say I found the characters very unlikeable with very few exceptions. As well as a old and used story premisis of the hero and his giant robo verses the monster of the day with a twist. The monsters are called ""Angels"" which is strange when they look nothing like the usuall depiction of an Angel, more demonic look to them really. And the storys atempt to mix Christian sysmbolism with Babylonian mythology doesn't exactly work well here either.
If still want to watch it, watch it for what it is, the darker side of being the hero. It's not that great of a series but it's an ok one.",1025308800,5,716,4.473282442748092
1385829,3,B000050IL8,"I may be the only one who thinks this, but I just plain didn't like Evangelion.  I watched the whole, but by the end, I was just watching it so I could say I finished it.
Admittedly, the action sequences and animation quality are top notch and the angel designs were unique, but the themes and plot left a lot to be desired.  Although it wants to be an intelligent anime by discussing theology and philosophy; if you really pay attention you'll see that those discussions are extremely shallow.  They only touch the brink of what they could.
The characters also had very little depth.  The main characters - Shinji, Asuka, Rei - were all static.  They were the same people at the end as they were at the beginning.
Also, two of the 26 episodes in the series are FILLER.  That's right, nothing but recap of what's happened before.
So if I don't like it, why 3 stars?  It's not BAD anime, it's just not the be-all end-all like many people seem to say.  If you're looking for a truly outstanding Anime series, might I recommend The Vision of Escaflowne instead.",1024963200,17,1058,4.473958333333333
1385830,5,B000050IL8,"It's true! I never really liked the genre at all until I saw clips of the first episode on the internet. I was amazed with the animation and the deep storyline that made you really feel for the characters. I knew this was definitely not your typical ""mech"" anime.
So I went to my local EB and purchased the first DVD which included the first 4 episodes, and it was AMAZING! I was so impressed with it I went back and purchased the remaining 7 DVD's in the series.
Soon after I completed the set is when they came out with the ""Neon Genesis Evangelion Perfect Collection"" and I kick myself to this day knowing I could have gotten the complete set for less.
Here is the basic run down of the series:
""The year is 2015. As the remnants of the human race cower in subterranean cities, a deadly war is being waged for what is left of the planet. On one side are the Mysterious beings known only as the Angels; on the other, the secret agency NERV with mankind's last hope, the awe inspiring Evangelions. Piloted by a team of young warriors, theses giant bio-mechanical humanoids are the only thing that can withstand the force of the Angels' defense fields long enough for the pilots to tackle the massive invaders in brutal hand-to-hand combat! At the same time, NERV struggles to pierce the veil of mystery surround the enigmatic Angels.""
Let me say it one more time. This is definitely not your typical ""mech"" anime, and if I could give 10 stars... I would! It's that good.",1024617600,3,1471,4.451851851851852
1385831,4,B000050IL8,"Watched the first dvd when a co-worker said ""you gotta watch this"" and have been hooked since then. It has just the right mixture between character dev and action. There is an underlying ""conspiracy"" theme where not everything is known and each dvd gives you just enough info to feel satisfied as well has wanting to know more. That is until you come to the ending episodes, the it is like whatthehell?? I some how felt as though they were trying to instill hope into kids in Japan. Sometimes found the the bilical references disturbing, but at the same time found it to be an interesting element to put into an anime.
Given the popularity of the series as well as some of the more feature packed dvds out there, I was a bit disappointed additional ""behind the scenes"" were left out. Nonetheless a great series and price you can not beat.",1024531200,,838,4.519736842105263
1385832,5,B000050IL8,"I've also hear the rumor about suicides in Japan. And jus wait for the next movie, it's a realy tour de force just watching the images.
The important part is this: Death & Rebirth is indeed a sumary of the series, but it's done completly focused on the characters. This movie was the very first thing I ever saw of Evangelion and I was hooked. The complexity on the relations is so condensed that are percieved in a more intense way than in the series.
The second part of this movie: Rebirth becomes the first part of the second movie but with a lttle more scenes. This is only the entrance to the terrorific ending of the series.
Evangelion is one of the more important anime ever made simply because it's a great plot. Remember, after all all the mecha element is a pretext to tell a very human story. Shinji, the protagonist, goes from the total image of a hero, to the total resemblence of cowardy and human weakness.",1024185600,6,921,4.423529411764706

I'm not going to give away the ending of the series, that would be crude and unjust. But I must say that everyone is complaining about ""psycho babble"" as though as if it were a bad thing (lol). It just takes a person who can relax through a series without having too high of expectations.
Neon Genesis Evangelion is absolutely the best anime that has been produced from Gainax and rates first to my personal opinion out of all anime. The characters are loveable and you can relate to (even Shinji and his psycho babble). The storyline is quite incredible and makes sense to me throughout the whole series.
The animation was absolutely astounding. But I must agree that in many scenes, the english voice acting is terrible. When I first watched through the series, I had to turn on the english subtitles just to understand what was being said (yes, at times it is THAT horrible).
Anno's (the genius behind Neon Genesis Evangelion) vision was totally misunderstood at the ending of the series. Nobody really cared that Anno put so much work and personal feelings and emotions into the series itself. Almost every dense Evangelion fan out there sent Anno an e-mail or letter DEMANDING more to the series so that the answers that they were not open enough to grasp themselves would be answered. Thus the reason to the ""Death & Rebirth"" and ""End of Evangelion"" movies.
I give a full 5 stars to Anno and his creation (Evangelion) as it's an anime that will have you sitting in your chair speechless from the depth. Don't mind those that state that there is no depth to it, their problem is that they looked TOO much into it through the literal sense.",1023667200,,1846,4.546546546546547

The last third of the series(after episode 19)takes a very serious tone. I don't mind this but the quality of the earlier episodes seems to be lacking animation wise. There a lot of stock footage and still picks. Even the eva fights aren't as good as earlier episodes. Episode 20 seems completely unnecassary. Then there are the final two episodes which i won't even go in too. Many people say that the ending was a psychological trip that only patient people and the series creator could understand and those same people have the fortitude to tell us what the creator ment when in actuallity there just as clueless as anybody else to what the creator wanted. Well here's my opinion of what happened. I think that the series ran low on bugit so the creator got ticked off at Gainax for not giving them more money and made the ending convuluted and stupid because he couldn't show what he really wanted to show. Seriously the last episodes use so much stock footage that it seems they only had $20 dollars left and just winged it. But what about the real ending End of Evangelion, well it seems that the creator got angry for people not understanding the ""original"" that he decided to use all the money he got for the movie and make an even more convuluted ending in spite, kinda of like a artist who's works aren't understood. It really is a shame because you never get the true true ending that was initialy ment for the series.

The focus of the first movie death is a recap of key scenes, which have been reanimated using theater quality cell designs, of the series as well as a few scenes which were never in the series such as a monolog from Gendo and Keel the two conspirators, or how Asuka tries to seduce Kaji on the way to Tokyo 3. This is true eye candy for fans and it is essential for those whom have not seen the entire series.
The second movie Rebirth takes place after episode 24. The sevententh angel now is dead and the orginization known as Seele moves to bring about the biblical armagedon they have been planning ""Third Impact"". The young boy Shinji must over come his self loathing and hatered of the world as Tokyo 3 and the HQ of NERV come under attack by the UN and SEELE's new Evangelion units. The young piolet Asuka also must over come her own self distructive thoughts and the angst of her past in order to piolt her Evangelion. This film is beautifully animated and the music is incredible. Rebirth is by far the most violent of the three Evangelion films and the characters do not always act as they did in the series. The epic battle Unit 2 wages against the Evangelions of SEELE is by far one of the most breathtaking scenes in the movie. As are the presonal confrontations of the whole cast. This is a film for those whom like both action and a unforgettable story. For those whom were dissapointed with the ending of the series this is the way the series was ment to end, yet you will need to wait a little longer for ""Neon Genesis Evangelion: End"" to find out the conclusion to the cliffhanger ending of Rebirth. WARNING ""Neon Genesis Evangelion: Death and Rebirth"" contains scenes of Graphic Violence, Gore, Language, Nudity, Sexuality, and Strong Thematic Elements.

It does contain some scenes that were removed from the US release of the show, otherwise there is little reason to watch it - the series explains things much more deeply, and there is more character introspection.
The second half, ""Rebirth"", is the first half of ""The End of Evangelion"".  I'd just get the whole series and the other movie, but this movie is still good in itself.",1023062400,5,522,4.531914893617022

(Sorry, I don't know the other two) Lots of people says it's ending is terrible but I think it is the coolest ending I ever saw. Well, it's boring but when you watch is and watch it again, you will fall in to the real world of Evangelion. The last episodes are about the human completment project and it is the true meaning of the Evangelion. And of course, this is not the REAL ending, you have to watch other movies - Death and Rebirth. Evangelion is one of the hardest animation to understand. It is not just hard, it is very, very philosophic anime. Even you just understand 10%, your characteristic will change. Evangelion tells you the real life you never realized during your life. You must watch this animation, and, don't just watch one time. Watch it as many time as you can and every times the story will look different. And you will completely understand what evangelion wants to say. The best animation ever!

As being one of the first to view the US version I can tell you that it is really good, but leaves you open and confused at the end. Though evangelion fans will expect this, the lesser hard core evangelion fans won't, giving slight disappointment to the casual viewer (however the conclusion is coming this fall so don't worry).
The movie is very action packed (and very violent), very thought prokvoking, and still attacks at your subconsious. Although it doesn't really have an ending, it still leaves you satisfied. 4.7/5
Warning, this movie is not suitable for childern because it contains nudity, violence, and extreme physcological pressures.(actually, a rumor is that when this movie came out in japan, a few kids commeted suicide after viewing this movie, so it is really not suitable for childern)",1022976000,5,1004,4.982142857142857
1385841,5,B000050IL8,"Having only ever seen this movie in its fan-subbed version, I found it difficult to understand what was being implied by the characters and following the story was a little tricky too.
The evangelion movies are a recap of the episodes and a brief explanation of whats been going on, the main purpose of these movies was to make an alternative ending for the series, as the ending in episode 26 left much to be desired.
Death and Rebirth and Evangelion the Movie are much darker and enriched with deep, complicated notions, so you may need to expend a bit more patience than you usually would in following the story.
My main concern is that the new english language dialogue will faithfully recreate the intended storyline.
If you have collected the series on dvd or vhs BUY THIS. (and the next DVD too)
If you don't know of evangelion or you haven't seen all of the series, don't watch this. It will make no sense to you at all.",1022803200,5,928,4.497041420118343

The last series of the Neon Genesis Evangalion, or the Movie is consists of 'Evangelion Death & Birth' and 'The end of Evangalion'.  This very DVD, Death & Rebirth will show you the highlight of all the previous 26 episodes.  You might ask what's the purpose of rewatching this then?  Well, in my humble opinion, you really need to recapture all the highlights, all the essence, all the significant part of all 26 previous episode.  Trust me, you will be grateful since the next DVD, 'The end of Evangelion' will confuse you big time.
Not only this 'Death & Rebirth' series will recapture all the previous highlights, but also it shows you what really happened at the end.  Of course, it will only show tip of iceberg, in terms of what's really going to happen, nevertheless, it is crucial to see this last part in order to get connected to next episode, which will be THE last episode.
You might ask why then separate this episode apart from all 8DVD series, why not make this whole thing as 10DVD collection?  Well, to be honest, I was really anxious to watch this 'the Movie' part, and now I've seen it, I understand why.  They really needed to separate this and forth coming episode in order to differtiate them from previous episode.  They needed to differentiate from previsou episodes because it will really show you what really happened, the truth behind NERV, SEELE, EVA series, Rei, and more, of course, this DVD will show you only part of it.
They changed everything in terms of ending music (no more 'Fly me to the Moon' I know, but you will appreciate this new music scores) and graphic is as you know the best you can find.

1385843,5,B000050IL8,"Some years ago the TV series Neon Genesis Evangelion took the animation market by surprise due to it's overwelming success both in Japan as in the US and Europe.
In Japan the LD's, Video's and DVD's sold like hot cakes even outselling the traditional top bestsellers from Disney.
Spinning off loads of merchandise and two extra movies as a result.
The two films are: Death, which is part 1 and Rebirth which is part 2.
At first, in Japan, they were sold seperatly but luckily for us they have now been merged into one long movie.
""Death"" is basicly the same story as the series episodes 1 through 24, but compacted into a movie.
""Rebirth"" can be considered a reworked edition of Tv episodes 25 and 26 but now stretched out in big-screen movie style.
The Tv series started off as something older children could watch and enjoy, there's comedy, giant robots and spectacular battles.
But half way the Tv series the story turns serious and ventures off into all kinds of religious, psychological and phylosofical subjects and starts asking some very existencialistic questions.
The movies are even more adult orientated because it does away with all the light entertainment and goes directly into the deep and complex storyline which is simply to dificult to follow for children.
Besides making the story seem even more dramatic and intens the quality of the animations and music is considerably better too.
Especialy Rebirth turns out to be very artistic and abstract.
Either you love it or you hate it... most people I know loved it to death!
I will not give a review of the story line for two reasons, firstly because it's a very complex storyline which is hard to explain in a short review and secondly because I don't wish to give away spoilers.
Besides, EVA D&R has to be experienced... you'll understand what I mean if you see it.
If you are looking for a high quality anime movie then look no further... this one became an instant clasic the moment it was released.
long lastng entertainment is guaranteed since you'll probably have to watch the movie several times in order to completely understand the entire plot.

1385844,4,B000050IL8,"I hate MECHA genre's, and still do (that's why 4, not 5, stars), but I loved this series. After staying up all night, only stopping because I had to leave for work, I found myself wanting to finish the series.
Besides the Mecha battles, which probably draws most people to the series, it has a very serieous sub-plots. Every character is defenatly an individual, with their own motivations, but come to find they have more in common then just NERV.
While episodes 1-24 deal with mecha against the Angels, they are just build up for eisodes 25 and 26, where the real heart of the story plays fourth.
Keeping it's origional soundtrack, I find myself in histarics when I hear ""Fly Me To The Moon"" sang in English by the Japanese female cast. If you listen to classical music, you will find some ""Canon"", by Johann Pachelbel, and ""Air on a G String"", by Bach, played here and there.
This is no Kawaii (cute) ""Magic Knight Rayearth"", and contains suggestive scenes, as well as language, moderate violance and blood, so viewers under 13 should be cautioned.",1022544000,,1051,4.655913978494624

1385846,5,B000050IL8,"PLEASE WATCH EVA IN JAPANESE!!
  Not long ago, my friend who was a fanatic Dragon Ballz fan told me about Neon Genesis Evangelion.  I looked it up on the internet and thought it might be interesting to take a peak because of the postive buzz.  The only anime I had seen up to this point were the undeniable classics(Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Ninja Scroll, etc.) and I was not really prepared for what was in store for me.  Now, I can say that Evangelion is the best anime and the best movie that has ever been made.  The first DVD began like any other story but by the 5th DVD I fell completely in love with the characters and story.  The 2nd epidsode on the 5th DVD is my favorite sequence of events in a story ever.  Of course, Evangelion is my favorite movie ever.  Yet, I am only giving Evangelion 5 stars, not ADV.  I was stupid buying anime when I started buying Evangelion.  You can get the entire series on DVD for like 60 bucks now(...), you just won't get the AWFUL TERRIBLE UNLISTENABLE English version.  I cannot put in words how terrible the English voice acting is.  I've seen high school and church plays done with people with no acting experience who have done better jobs.  I honestly don't think the voice acting could get any worse, it' on the level of say the first Resident Evil video game.  I can't believe ADV would use such horrible voice actors.  Here's a list from completely unbearable to god-awful.
1. Asuka 2. Kaji 3. Gendo 4. Misato 5. Ritsuko
I now hate ADV because I got up to the 4th DVD and heard about the box set being sold for much less than all 8 DVD's combined.  Plus, it seems the video quality could be alot better.  Sometimes it's clarity is questionable and it jumps around.
  The Japanese voice acting is very well done, from Shinji's screams to Asuka's tantrums.  I've walked around the house yelling ""Anta baka!"" because her voice is so cute.  One of the greatest accomplishments of Eva is the music, I don't think anyone could disagree.  The composer obviously loved the use of strings and the result makes Eva that much more memorable.  By the end of the series, Anno will be using Beethoven's opera over explosions and screams, it is simply wondrous.  I have downloaded almost 30 songs from the series.  I like rock music but I'll listen to the classic and opera music because it's beautiful and it reminds me of the various episodes and moments.
  With these points aside, Evangelion is the best story ever written.  The characters are so real I have dreams that they exist in.  Shinji is fascinating.  He represents rejection and the hatred that is created from it.  Rei symbolizes fear, and is constantly questioning her existence.  Asuka symbolizes anger, at first you will probably hate her as well, but she eventually develops into a great character.  I think most dudes just like Rei because she's an attractive girl who they think they could get with if she existed(pathetic isn't it).  The character and Eva designs are spectacular.  Each of the Evangelion units have drastically different and stunning appearances.
  One of the words that is seemingly attached to Evangelion is controversial.  However, I find little in the story to be controversial.  Finally, a beautiful story is created that is original and thought provoking and the only thing people can call it is controversial.  I would agree that Evangelion is for young adults and up because of the dark themes but I do not find it religously offensive.  As of the ending, I would lie if I said I wasn't dissapointed but it was an original ending.  I can say that I wanted in my heart to see a certain kind of ending but I'm glad it ended the way it did instead of giving me what I wanted.
P.S.  Hey reviewers, stop putting so many spoilers in your reviews.  I would also like to say one more time that I hated the English voice acting.",1021939200,13,3855,4.539244186046512
1385847,5,B000050IL8,"The topic, which you will encounter when you get this set, says it all in my very humble opinion. This is truly _the_ best series to get if you're into the Anime genre. Be prepared to get your mind blazed by the very hard action, the humour and (personal) drama in the series. This series is very unlike any other I've seen because it not only focuses on the action, but in between also truly focuses on the persons in it and the way they are developing (and believe me; some persons truly evolve and are growing).
This series isn't rated but although I'm not some ""violence on TV is bad zealot"" I would strongly advice people not to let 12 year olds and younger people watch this (alone). Although the pictures itself aren't as brutal / violent all the time sometimes the storyline and the way its performed can be quite brutal IMO. Real life, in a way, but some issues make you think, think hard. And I really wonder if some of these ""adult issues"" are suitable for minors.
Finally... I am not sure if this is the case for all boxed sets (I think it is) but: Amazon says the discs are Region 1 only, this was not the case with mine. The discs in all of my box were suitable for regions 1, 2 and 4. Which means very good news for most people in Europe since this box is either unavailable or much more expensive (at least that was the case for me in Holland).
To summarize; this box is money well worth spend.",1021852800,3,1410,4.245353159851301

It is the year 2013 and the end is upon us. the fate of the world is hanging after a soilder of God crashed into the earth distroying most of life on it. Now 3 (later, 4) 14 year old kids must stop God from continuing Armageddon, but is it right?
One of the most controversial series of all times is a now in a LIMITED EDITION box set! Not a series sutible for childern (because it has intense physcological issues that may be too intense, violence, and a small bit of nudity (at the end))
It is an excellent series that actually fallows the Book of Revolations quite accurately with a original and unique interpertaiton. However I do not believe it is for everyone. Usually you have two levels of anime:
- Simple (which is a pretty much basic, but still quite enjoyable series)
which is basically like Dragon Ball Z and Pokemon
-and Complex (a series that requires a lot of thought to understand)
which is like Serial Experiments: Lain, Ghost in a Shell, and...
...Neon Genesis Evangelion
Seriously not everyone will understand this series, and it is very rare for people to see it the first time and understand it. This makes it an excellent choice for buying, but as I stated eariler it is a very complex series especially in the end where it seems incomplete. (though it is not)

1385869,5,B000050IL8,"If a masterpiece is something which makes you accept its flaws, Evangelion must be a masterpiece.
In the past decades, the greatest post-modern works are ones which take a genre with very set conventions (cliches), then create a piece which simultaneously dissects those conventions while somehow remaining true to the heart of that genre. What Watchmen did for superhero comic books, what Dancer in the Dark did for Broadway musicals, what Name of the Rose did for the Whodunit, Evangelion does for the ""giant robot anime.""
No anime before or since has been so warts-and-all personal as Anno Hideaki's Evangelion, yet while Anno deserves most of the credit, his colleagues also brought true _art_ to their endeavors-- the character designs by Yoshiyuki Sadamoto are as stylish as they are original.
Evangelion also continues a proud tradition of taking a mindless Sinatra-era song and injecting it with previously unknown depth and meaning; what Gilliam did for the song Brazil, Anno did for Fly Me To The Moon.
While Princess Mononoke is an excellent work, Evangelion remains the only true 'classic' the medium of anime has yet to produce, and one of the 1990s' most original and important works, in any medium.",1021075200,,1213,5.07
1385870,5,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion: Widely acknowledged as one of the most complex, philisohpical, and intelligent animes ever created, it is distinct in many ways. While series that involves various forms of mecha are a dime a dozen when it comes to anime, the wonderfully designed EVAs is only one part of what makes the series so great. The complex story, with the widespread use of symbolism, is very well written and scripted: it doesn't always make everything completely clear, but rather asks the viewer to think and infer on the true happenings.
Beyond the story, the art direction is very well done, though nothing that elevates the series a postion of being the best. The sound is good as well, but like the graphics, not special. They are there to present the series, and they do a capable job of it, but never detracts attention away from the focus on the storyline.
EVA is not without it's faults. Ironcailly, the strongest aspect is also the source of the problem: the storyline is so deep that it may even seem illogical, disconnected, and incomprehensible to some.

People who complain that the series had no ending are wrong.  They have forgotten that Hideaki Anno was only using the giant robot aspect as a vechicle for his psycho-analysis of the human soul.  He is clearly very much in love with technology (look also at Gunbuster) and Christianity.  NGE is like a series version of Akira-you have to watch it again and again to understand what happened.  The last two episodes are very disconnected from the rest of the series, but that is deliberate as Anno was trying to make the viewer feel as discombobulated as Shinji.  This series was better than any reality TV show-it explored a whole human mind.  The only complaints I have about the series is that the 5th child should have appeared four or five episodes before he did, so the viewer could have become emotionally attached to him.  And also the fact that you never get to see Evangelion fully de-armoured.  Apart from that this is a great TV series, and the idea of the A.T. field is pure genius!

1385872,5,B000050IL8,"To begin, I must state that this is truly the most magnificent anime ever created.  This statement, of course, has a natural bias, as every review does, but I digress.
This series begins on an abnormal bent, which is always favorable, particularly considering the proliferation of mediocre anime that satisfies those who are considered 'anime newbies (a term utilized to describe those who have little or no experience with anime).  Though it begins as seemingly a simple 'giant mecha' anime, after the first episode (and even towards the end of the first) you'll become aware of a very complicated and subtle plot development.  This grows throughout the 26 episodes, concluding with perhaps the most wonderful conclusion any anime should have (I preferred it to the 'End of Evangelion' alternate conclusion).  In between the beginning and delightful finale, a complicated and thought provoking plot develops concerning the attacks of the 'Angel' beings against earth, the fate of the planet, and life itself.  With a theological basis, this anime takes an extremely philosophical standpoint on every aspect of life and thought via the trials and tribulations of the complicated, multi-dimensional cast, as well as the 'Evangelions' themselves.  I consider this anime, Neon Genesis Evangelion, to be the greatest anime ever created, and reccomend this ultimate collection to anyone, regardless of whether or not they are an anime fan.",1020556800,2,1434,5.323008849557522

I thought this was going to be some sort of a Macross or Gundam Wing spinoff, but no it is unique and original unto itself. It lures you in with it's giant robot battles, makes you think with it's interesting perspectives on God vs science, and it makes you fall in love with all of its interesting characters. The animation is beautiful, the music is harmonious albeit overplayed throughout the series (it is supposed to be a television series however). Definetly a must have in any sane anime lovers collection. There are two reasons for me giving it only 4 stars however. One is that ADV did a pretty bad job putting this out. 8 DVDs? Give me a break. They could have fit this on less easily. Also the video is a bit shaky but it's easy to ignore. The second reason is that the movie delves straight into the depths of philosophy towards the end. The robot battles stop coming, and the plot starts unraveling, leaving you and your brain to process it all. I didn't like how they played out the last two episodes and left the series off.

1385875,2,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion starts out as a very promising series: nice animation (as one expects from Gainax Studios), a driving soundtrack, and some interesting concepts. This is what gets it two stars instead of one.
By the time it ends, however, it has descended into a morass of psychobabble, pretentious and overblown imagery, and acquainted us with characters that simply cannot carry the weight of what's being placed upon them.
According to some sources, Hideki Anno's psychologist recommended that he work out some of his psychological problems in his art. If that's true, it's unfortunate. Evangelion, while possibly an interesting psychological study, fails as a series. It tries to do too many things, and ends up failing at all of them.
On one level, Evangelion seems to be a mecha show -- earth against the aliens. On another, it appears to be a parody of these things. On yet another, it tries to be a philosophical investigation. But it never completes any of these attempts. It's too serious and focused on its technology to be a parody or deconstruction of the super-mecha genre; the characters are too weak and ineffective to be a serious mecha show; the philosophical/religious material comes too late, and is too fuzzily explicated, to be an anime of ideas.
Evangelion's only true claims-to-fame come as side issues. The limitation of the ""Eva"" units for power is an interesting, and fairly realistic, problem (one of the major ""real life"" problems for such personal combat machines has always been ""where can they get that much power?""). Eva has the dubious distinction of having the single most ineffective ""protagonist"" ever. Shinji Ikari makes Tenchi (of Tenchi Muyo) look assertive and decisive. He has the decision-making capacity of a jellyfish, and the spine of one as well. He bounces passively from one situation to the next, and even his few attempts at making a decision are abortive and useless. Of course, he isn't deliberately offensive, either, which at least puts him ahead of his father, Ikari Gendo -- possibly the single most evil man in anime, and certainly all-time champion in the ""Worst Father Ever"" sweepstakes. Evangelion ALMOST makes sense if you view Gendo as the Antichrist and everyone else as his poor puppets.
The female characters are just as bad. All of them are basically screwed over by the male figures in their lives. Shinji avoids being put into the abuser category only by being ineffective. The most effective of the characters is Misato -- and she's a hard-drinking woman whose personal life is in shambles. Ayanami Rei is a flat-affect, staring blow-up doll for much of the series, and what little emotion she's allowed to express demonstrates that she is, if anything, even more screwed up by Gendo than Shinji is. Asuka, the classic Gainax redhead, manages to get all the objectionable characteristics of a Gainax Girl without any of the good ones; she's hot-tempered, obsessive, arrogant, and impulsive.
All in all, a tremendous disappointment; Gainax created some of the great classics of anime (Gunbuster, Nadia, Wings of Honneamise, and Otaku no Video), but here they kept only their animation skill, and left any decent characters and storytelling behind.",1020211200,14,3223,5.071563088512241

I think it is a good series to buy but it is imperitive that you STOP AT EPISODE 22! I know what you're thinking ""what is this lunatic ranting about now?"" Well I am serious. I bought this and I really liked. I watched the first two episodes long before the rest of it, which promted me to buy the series, but once I got to the third volume I was hooked. It was kind of a lazy Sunday and I intended to watch just volume 3 and possibly four, but after finishing 3 I went to 4 with good enthusiasm then I went to 5 seriosly interested then I went to 6 totaly enthrolled in the story then I went on to 7 as a full blown adict. It was good, really, really good! But there was a problem. I was involved in a very thick and tangled plot for which I craved answers to so many questions that were presented but as I finished episode 24 (and none of my questions had benn answered) I wondered how they could make two more episodes after what transpired in that. The answer to my question was this, they didn't! Episodes 25 and 26 the supposed conclusion answered nothing and I mean NOTHING!!! They even went as far to have a five minute alternate universe, it was all just a dream thing and all the charecters are just normal people, but that wasn't the worst of it, no they weren't done yet. There were five more minutes that had nothing to do with anything like the rest of episodes 25 and 26. They were just siliquies and randon intervers in some void that had nothing to do with anything, and it was so bad that you wished it had all been a dream like they had started to say, and maybe it was. You just don't know!
So you have come to except why you should not watch episodes 25 and 26 but why not 23 and 24 you ask. Well, they begin the downward spiral. Have you ever encountered an unexcusable break in charecter that just made you mad? In episode 23 and 24 that happens to every charecter! I actually had trouble sleeping after this, not because it was scary or deeply disturbing (on a psycological level anyway) but because I was so mad. So for one last time let me re-iterate STOP AT EPISODE 22 OR YOU WILL REGRET IT. Now there is hope and I do encourage you to buy the series. The ending was so bad that they made a movie with an alternate one so you can watch that instead. I haven't seen it on amazon yet but it is out there and I know someone who has it so you should be able to find it. In the meantime, I am going to find the movie so I can get some closure.",1020038400,5,2564,4.059171597633136

The first couple episodes you may find to be a bit boring, but once you get to the second DVD it is great. The series starts out being funny and lighthearted, and progresses to reveal unexpected secrets about each of the well-developed characters. Love, hate, humor, jealousy, sadness, and startling revelations are all prevalent in this series. It will keep you guessing until the end...which is the only part I didn't like.

1385893,4,B000050IL8,"What can I say that hasn't been said about the Evangelion series?  I'll spare you the rant and just tell you about the dvd collection.  First of all, I really dislike ADV Films, and one of the main reasons is for what this set could have been if they had only spent a little more money.  Gainax, the studio that created eva, gave ADV films the chance to get the digital masters of the series complete with the directors cuts of episodes 21-24 (the directors cuts were extra footage added into episodes 21-24 when the box set was released in Japan), but instead they opted(more than likely to save money) to just buy the rights to what was broadcasted on television.  They didn't even do the transfer right as the picture in some points in the series was very jumpy(they somewhat coorected this later on, and in the box set there was a very noticible fix on DVD 1).  Then they claim that DVD 1 was ""re-mastered"", and by re-mastered they mean they fixed the spine to match up with the other ones and got rid of the annoying layover which they never should have put in to begin with.  Finally, the fact that the series spawns 8 discs just shows where their main concern is, their pocketbook.  Bandai has released many great 26 show anime series on a mere 6 discs(not to mention with many more extras and much better production quality).  Overall, I still recommend you pick up this great series at a VERY reasonable(thank you amazon.com) price!  Just write letters to ADV!  (And by the way, appearently I'm not the only one ADV is upsetting, GAINAX recently cut all ties with them, so no more ADV distributed GAINAX anime!  Hooray!)",1019001600,39,1629,4.525597269624574
1385894,4,B000050IL8,"The first thing I noticed critically, was that the transition from shot to shot was a bit wobbly. I thought it was just the first few episodes originally, but on closer inspection I found I had just not noticed it thereafter (it's very slight). There is a tad bit of noise in the picture as well, but these two related things weren't enough to justify the removal of one star.
  The reason I gave it four stars is the ending. The last two episodes were a psych-trip into the minds and thoughts of the characters. While I think it was a good addition, it didn't satisify the story-line. The finale is supposedly to be told in the film ""End of Evangelion,"" to be released this summer on DVD. If the set included this film, or at least this part of the story, then it would have recieved five stars.
  As for praise. At times the emotion in the story is brought forth in the most vivid detail I've seen in an anime. Each character is well developed and unique. The action is great and the technical aspects are quite realistic to actual physics (I applaud the inclusion of abstract mathematics, which aren't fully explained but revealed as present and active). I follow and critique the scientific aspects of films and anime often. The religious tie-ins are quite a bit inconsistent with Christian mythology, but in many ways parrallel to it as well. The very conservative Christian WILL be offended, but I was quite comfortable.
  While the seriousness of the first episodes is abrupt, and doesn't let you identify with or really understand any of the characters, the draw-in of the characters' development later on is quite good.
  This actually may not be a GREAT choice for the casual viewer, it will, however, fit in the die-hard otaku's collection quite well. I will definitely be purchasing the End of Evangelion DVD to follow-up!",1018915200,,1834,4.673913043478261

I liked it, but it's story is a little confusing. Then I saw Gundam Wing, another canidate for best mecha series in all time.  Great story in it, but the pilots are a bit unrealistic, and it's mostly about blowing people up. I'm not saying that's bad, but not much else going on. Then i saw Gundam, which had some horrible animation, but it's from 1980. Good story, places you in a war like situation that seems a bit less far fetched then the others, But 8th MS Team is even more realistic than that. Then I Saw Evangelion. I was stunned with the mecha design, the story is one of the deepest i have ever seen, there is plenty of comidy, and a Lot, and i mean a LOT of religios backround. Some might be offended, but it is a great story. I wouldn't recomend the last DVD, because it's something you should rent, because it's not exactly a thriller. Then I saw Patlabor, which is very much like NGE because the story has more to do with the charicters then the fight scenes. Very funny, Most Realistic, but not too good of a story so far. however, I have not seen all of the episodes yet. Just a note. If You like midevil type shows and Japaneese animation, Record Of Lodoss War. Space Type futur animation, Star Blazers and Harlock Saga. Evangelion a 5 out of 5.",1018828800,,1435,4.237226277372263
1385908,5,B000050IL8,"The Eva series, My first taste of animation.  This series has everything... action, (mostly prominent in the first 3 DVD's) plot (very prominent in the last 5 DVD's) and character development (DVD's 1-8...especially number 8)  I herd all lot of you who say ""Well I watched the first dvd and I don't see that quote un quote best plot in the world.""  Take my advice and rent DVD #4.  You may be confused. (That's why I don't recommend it) That's when I think the plot starts becoming really interesting. What I think makes this series stand out from the rest, other then the plot, is the blending of the plot, action and character development.  It's easy to have the plot and action develop the over all story line, but in EVA character development is treated just as important as the plot and action. All three of these characteristics are blended perfectly through out the series..
  My only gripe is the last DVD (I know, I know what all you Eva fans are thinking as you read this and I understand.)  But my gripe isn't with the lack of action because that's the way the Director wanted it, not to mention that the movie is the real ending.  But anyway I really didn't like the very, very end I'm saying the last 5 minutes I think the best ending to this series should have given you a sick filling in your stomach it shouldn't have ended on a happy note.  I cheated and watched the End of EVA and I can say that they rectify the mistake made in the series, not to mention it answers some of the Q's not answer in the series. (On the topic of Q's if I hear any of you guys say ""Eva has too many holes in the plot and doesn't answer half of them."" I will hurt the next person who say's that!  It's not called a HOLE if the director meant to leave it out.  EVA doesn't  have  a spoon fed plot. (If you want one of those watch Dark wing Duck or ...gasp... Duck Tales!!!!)

1385909,5,B000050IL8,"I had first heard of Neon Genesis Evangelion sometime in 1997 when I was flipping through a magazine. At first it didn't really catch my attention but 5 years later I was dying to see the thing in its entirety. I loved everything about the series: the action, the comedy, the drama, EVERYTHING. The only flaw I can see in this series is the exception of the 2 movies, Death and Rebirth and End of Evangelion. I had heard these would be released sometime in the summertime of 2002 and I pray that they are. I'm sure you've all heard that the ending is very unique and somewhat vague but its really not its just...different. I can honestly say that I'd prefer a different ending but this one answers a few questions about the characters especially my personal favorite, Shinji.
  This is definately one collection that every anime fan should own. I don't know what I'd do without it. As far as the 2 movies go, PLEASE PLEASE be released because Fansubs are so weird. CAUTION: this anime will give you a feeling of emptyness and questions as to what YOU REALLY Are and WHY YOU Are HERE And WHETER MAN is fit to control so many things.

1385910,5,B000050IL8,"On this site, you'll find about 5 reviews saying how amazing Eva is, then one that says it's awful.  If you notice, often the person that says it's awful was either looking for the anime equivalent of an action movie - superficial, weak, and held together only on the strength of how much money is poured in (and time wasted) on eye candy... Or they say things like ""Nothing is explained, the characters are unrealistic"", etc.  But you'll notice a lot more people that say the character development is wonderfully done.  So I'm forced to conclude that they probably weren't really looking.  Or, they were looking for something that Eva never promised and isn't about...  Either way, they weren't letting the show speak for itself.
Just wanted to clear that up - I don't think I particularly need to review the series - it's amazing - I'm starting to collect anime and this series is at the top of my priority list (I've seen it all, just don't own it yet).

From the beginning to the end Evangelion remains underdeveloped and uninteresting. The dull characters all have the some problem, the creators couldn't even develop unique ideas for the individual characters instead they opted to give the the same cause to all their disfunctions, they all hate their parents(how uncreative). It's hard to get excited when a character tell us their surprise revelation, that they hate their parents; this gets boring after the fifth time. Couple that with an underdeveloped story about the agency NERV and their improbable defense against the never explained angels. The story never bothers to explain anything, it just meanders forward at its own slow boring pace. This isn't even mentioning the pathetic, whiny Shinji(Who unlike popular belief is nothing like a real human being) and the ending that will make you cry in shear pain and torture (its so bad that the shows creators even go back to redue it). I suggest those looking for a good mecha anime or even an anime in general look elsewhere. I suggest those looking for interesting disfunctional characters try the suppremely more enjoyable Revolutionary Girl Utena and those looking for a mecha anime check out the varies Gundam shows, Gasariki and Big O. I'd also suggest Nadesico, Dual, and Cowboy Bebop.",1018396800,16,1399,5.140350877192983
1385913,5,B000050IL8,"...I started watching EVA sometime in 1997. I had seen some tapes on the shelf at Suncoast, I suppose I thought the title was intriguing but knew nothing about the show. I was curious but not to the point where I was going to jump in cold. However it was around this time that I asked someone who was more hardcore about anime than I was if there was anything new I should check out. Sure enough, he said ""Neon Genesis Evangelion. It's @#$% awesome."" That was how I came to start watching it. There was no hype, no controversy at the time. I'm thankful for this, I think these things tend to have a very negative effect on people who get into a series later, when it's weighed down with tons of baggage.

I enjoyed the first few volumes a lot. It seemed to have it all: action, drama, comedy, interesting characters, great art direction, excellent script, and overall high production value. But somewhere after the middle, the series took a HARD left turn into some major psychological and philosophical territory. It really threw me for a loop, at first. But I knew that this was easily the richest, heaviest anime I'd ever seen. My respect for the series increased ten fold. Then I saw the last two episodes, and I just didn't know what to think. The ending was pretty disappointing, that's all I can say. And I'm a little suspect of anyone who claims that they weren't disappointed in the ending. Then, well over a year after finishing the series, I was finally able to get my hands on a fansub copy of the theatrical movie ""End of Evangelion,"" which is more or less an alternate to the original TV series ending. To this day I still consider EoE to be the one greatest work of anime that I've ever seen. Furthermore, it made the TV series ending easier to take, and I was able to appreciate that more than I originally did.

All I really want to say is please, PLEASE disregard anyone who tells you that it ""starts out good and then just gets weird"" or ""loses focus"" etc. These are very shallow and dismissive views. I know fawning fanboys are annoying, but I think it's a fact that there is a lot going on this series, it's up to the viewer to appreciate it if they can.

The first action scene was on par with some of the better Anime movies out there, such as Akira. However, I'm afraid that that's what they spent their entire budget on, since after the next few episodes, the story got boring, and WEIRD. They couldn't afford to do any more interesting action scenes, so they resorted to weirdness. Two words: BAD MOVE. Each episode made it more and more obviouse that their budget was gone. And, there are often long pauses with no animation, and you wonder if your DVD player froze. I knew this wasn't the case, since my first encounter with the series was on VHS. This show is definately not for the kids either. It has ""barbie doll esque"" nudity, and also there is a sex scene in there. The latter though happens to be one of those long pauses, and the camera is fixed on a table, and all we see is an arm. But, there are some very suggestive sounds in there. And, there is an episode with a gay kid, and some parents obviousely wouldn't want their kids to see that. And the ending of the series BITES MONKEYS. Basically, I give this show 2 stars instead of 1 because at the start of the series there are some good action scenes. Watch those, and then leave the rest on the shelf.

Now for what I have to say about this show: The characters are very cool and likeable even though the main character at the begining can be a pain with his whining.
The battles are totaly awesome.
And the ending...don't want to ruin it, but it'll make you think thats all I have to say.

  However, I am not happy at all with the way ADV approached releasing this DVD set. For the first two DVDs, 4 episodes came on each disk. Once they hit DVD 3 however, only 3 episodes came on each disk for the same cost. Several months later, ADV then decides to sell a complete box set of the entire series for probably 40-50% less than what I paid to buy each DVD separately. I applaud ADV for releasing this amazing series to DVD but now feel betrayed by the way they went about this. Hopefully enough people will let ADV know that such behavior is not appreciated, especially by those who waited for months just to get a complete set.",1016755200,10,929,4.297142857142857

1385963,5,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion is a must-have for the true otaku.
The story revolves around Shinji Ikari, an insecure 14-year old boy who is chosen to pilot a living weapon known as Evangelion to save the world from the mysterious beings known as Angels.
Shinji is not alone in this endeavor. Fellow pilots Asuka Sohryu and Rei Ayanami battle alongside him, trying to save humanity from a relentless menace.
But each of these pilots holds secret pains and sorrows deep inside that could jeapordize the mission and endanger the world. For Shinji, it is the hidden memory of his mother's death and the sinister secret hidden by his estranged father.
For Asuka, it is the memory of seeing her mother driven slowly insane and abandoning her before committing suicide.
And Rei holds the final secret, the answer to the Evangelions, the Angels, and the Fate of the world.
If the Evangelions are defeated, humanity will be destroyed. Should the Evangelions prove successful, then the world as we know it will cease to exist.
All hope rests on the shoulders of these three children, and the machinations of Shinji's estranged father, who just might be the Devil himself.
Animation that's top notch, with a superb cast in both the Japanese and English language tracks. The story is exciting and engaging, with a controversial and surreal ending that will keep you guessing long after it's over. A series that has spawned countless imitators.
Evangelion does have some nudity and adult themes, and it requires the viewer to have an ability to reason things out as the clues to mankind's destiny are laid out slowly over the episodes.
But this is one of the finest series out there. Definitely on my must own list.",1016496000,14,1696,4.8517241379310345

I must admit, the first ten episodes are almost completely about the mecha fighting.  If you don't like that sort of thing, skip ahead to around episode 11 or so.  Around then, it delves into a LOT of Judeo-Christian mythology.  It talks about the relationships between Adam, God, and mankind.  It also gets into psychology and how people think.  Sounds confusing, I know.  It is.  Until you buy the series on DVD and the movies too.  In fact, ""whatthehellness"" increases tenfold with each episode after 11.  So, by the end of the series, you will have some clue what is going on, but not much.  To understand Evangelion, you have to buy the series and the ""End of Evangelion"" movie.  Because the movie clarifies almost everything.  Any residual whatthehellness should be eliminated by watching the series again.  Then going to [the web site] and looking at the information section.  Bottom line is, you will like Evangelion even if you hate anime.  Even if you hate everything.  So buy it.",1016323200,6,1091,4.805405405405406

Shinji Ikari is just a normal kid, except his mom is dead, he now lives with his guardian Misato Katsuragi, he pilots a giant mech called an  Evangelion, he works for NERV which is in the process of trying to protect the planet, and his dad Gendo, is the head of this organization.  It seems that in 2000, a giant explosion at the southpole, 2nd impact, has flooded much of the world and killed like 1/3rd the human race.  On top of that, huge indestructable creatures called Angels are starting to attack.
The series is so incredable cool, even near the end were the sereis goes all psycological.  As the title states, if you haven't seen Eva, you haven't seen anime.

2. You will then buy the movie ""Death and Rebirth"" which will still dissapoint you.
3. Then you will buy the second movie ""End of Evangelion"" and you will be blown away.
So as a stand-alone series without the movies Evangelion is pretty good. The ending is very ""origional"" and often disliked. You would pay [$$$] buying them all separatly.

It is even better the second time around because once you know what is going on, you can pick up conversations that had you scratching you head the first time.

1385969,5,B000050IL8,"Neon Genesis Evangelion.  After first hearing the title most people wonder what the heck it could possibly mean.  I did too.  In fact, I started watching the show not really knowing much about it, only knowing that it came from Studio Gainax, one of the most respected of all anime studios.  What I found was one of the most deep stories I ever witnessed in anime or for any TV show/movie for that matter.
At a glance, Evangelion is a show about kids piloting giant robots to fight strange invading aliens.  Upon watching the show further, nothing could be further from the truth.  Yes, the kids are there, the mecha is there (sort of), and it sounds like it has all been done before.
  It is not that though.  Religous references, scientific technology, drama, the question of who we are, what we are, why we are here, are all brought up.  Not to mention, glorious music and anime's finest opening theme song ever (Thesis of the Cruel Angel).  Also, what other show lets you listen to over twenty different versions of the old song, ""Fly Me to The Moon"" as it's ending theme?
Evangelion is a fine anime and well worth picking up as a box set.  Whether you think it is the greatest anime is your opinion, but a show that has at least been the subject of that debate deserves a place on anyone's shelf, don't you think?",1015545600,20,1318,4.445833333333334

This show is about  Shinji Ikari who is chosen to pilot a mecha called an Evangelion to save Tokyo-3 from the ""angels"". The show has some excellent mecha battles and a couple of funny scenes as well.  You should know that this anime starts out fairly friendly and makes you get real comfortable with the characters.  However at the 5th disk things start to get dark.  The series is 26 episodes long with two movies that followed it.  You get all 26 episodes in the box set, but you don't get the movies.  The movies will be released this summer though.  Be forewarned that there is a lot of religious symbolism in NGE, which might offend some.  However it doesn't really offend me and I've been a Christian since I was 8.  Although there may be a lot of religious symbolism in NGE it is not really about religion, it's about human beings and how we relate to one another.  Some say this series is overated, and I agree that it is not the greatest thing in the world.  However it is very good.

That being said this is the DVD where the series takes a turn. It is still very good. But the mecha action that prevailed in the early episodes starts to drop off.
  What replaces it is a hell of alot of weridness. Some of it is very cool. Ideas about what the angels are and what is really going on, as well alot that Nerv has been hiding.
  But it also the beginning of some serious soul searching by Shinji. That would not be so bad if he wasn't such a whiner. Overall I still think the series is good and this DVD is well worth the buy.

The DVD, like the first, is spectacular. Everything about it is great, except for the ADV previews but those are another matter.

This DVD overall is much improved over the first.  Due to it being just a single-layer DVD (whereas the first was dual-layered) makes for much improved image quality, because the compression of video is lessened.  Although the image tends to ""shift"" or ""jump"" on the first frame when cutting to another scene, this is of little annoyance to me.  I've seen many other anime titles where this kind of thing is noticeable, even on VHS tapes, so this is not a fault of the DVD disc or DVD playing hardware/software.
The sound quality, as with the first DVD, is top notch.  All 3 dubs (English, French & Spanish) as well as the original Japanese audio track, as with the first DVD, are all present as well.

But for the younger viewers I will say this, it is the freakin best scene to watch when Eva 01 beats the Angel.

The series makes a drastic turn for the serious in these episodes (and from then on,) so get ready to discover a few new things, and raise a LOT more questions.

Also, at first I was really skeptic about it, but when fans of the ""Cowboy Bebop"" series started talking about which series was the all time best(note:these two series are nothing alike, except the fact they're both masterpieces) . I only have one regret to owe this series, I wish I could buy the entire series on DVD and not have to wait for upcomming releases. This series is so good, I'm almost tempted to buy episodes #20-26 on VHS...
In my opinion nothing sounds or looks better than DVD, especially with an HDTV and 5 speakers(2 front, 2 surround, 1 center channel) and a powered sub on 5:1 Dolby Digital audio.
Disc 5's continuation of the story is awesome, I became depressed knowing that I would have to wait for Disc 6 on April 17th.  Anyways, Shinji is congratulated by his dad and scores high on his sync test.  So when all three Evas and their pilots fight the next Angel, Shinji gets worked up and too ambitious, while not following orders something goes awry.  You'll also learn some of the secrets of NERV and understand why Kaji has been acting so suspicious.  If you thought three Eva pilots wasn't enough, then you'll be happy, seems as if a 4th child is on the way and you'll never guess who it is.  The thing I liked about this and the rest of the series is the wild and zainy antics of the characters while they are not in action, it makes for a compelling yet wild drama.  So expect some more suprises out of your favorite characters in Disc 5 when they're off the set of NERV...

The main issue here is the VIDEO. I don't know how these details got past ADV's eyes, but it seems that each time there is a cut or camera angla change, the screens in random directions, the cut occurs, and then it restabilizes.

Plus, there are many typing errors in the english subtitles.
As a DVD, I'd give it only ONE star. But, because it's Evangelion, the content is still very awesome. Thus it BARELY deserves 3 stars.

Its a two part episode, but just by watching the first part, you already know who it is. For Angel fighting, there isn't much of it in here. Most of the DVD is just charcter development and inteligent plot twists, but its a very good volume. I really enjoy watching the Spanish and French language ADV included (thank you, DVD). Bio will most definetly include Angel #12, but thats about all I know right now. Stay tuned. The next volume is where the story really picks up and has an impressive fight scene. More fun to come!",982972800,7,1475,4.446494464944649
1386007,5,B000050IL8,"That's right-- contrary to popular belief and rumor, Evangelion is not superb, but merely very good.  It's plagued by a number of serious problems (besides hype) which prevent it from achieving absolute greatness, but those are problems which arise in future episodes (and reviews).
This second volume presents the next four episodes of the hugely popular sci-fi series, and introduces a new character in episode 8: Asuka Langley, a German girl who seems outwardly brash and obnoxious, but has underlying issues which rarely come to surface.  With this new addition, Shinji & Co. battle the next series of deadly ""Angels,"" but what are the underlying motives of NERV and its shadowy administrative organization, SEELE?
Naturally, none of the answers are fleshed out (if they ever are) in these early episodes, which still present a lighter approach to the issues involved. In other words, Evangelion hasn't taken itself completely seriously yet (moments of humor abound as Asuka ""takes over""!), which is how I prefer it.  Even so, time is taken to further develop the characters, particularly the mysterious Rei Ayanami in episode 7.
Evangelion is a great series, though perhaps not as outstanding as others would (vocally) have you believe.  Definitely worth taking a look at, even for non-fans of the genre, Evangelion is always thought-provoking, entertaining, and occasionally a bit confusing (find answers to all your questions on the Web!).  These earlier episodes are among the best in the series, before it takes a darker, more angsty tone in the latter half of the episodes.",982540800,,1583,5.192156862745098

It has large unique mecca, nifty technology, emotional byplay, philosophical questions, great characters, unique music, great artwork... you name it it's got it. If you love anime watch it! If you hate anime watch it! Be warned though it looks deceptively simple at first. To get its full effect you must be willing to watch the entire series.",982022400,,423,4.808219178082192
1386009,4,B000050IL8,"Evangelion is one of the finest series out there - perhaps my favourite. I was overjoyed when ADV decided to go full speed ahead after the excruciating wait for the 2nd volume. The episodes on this disc are very good. Lots of character delelopment on the mysterious Rei, and lots of action, including the very cool episode where EVA02 and Asuka are introduced.
People should try to see all of the series, because, having seen it on video, it gets a lot more intense and involving, with some incredible fights and animation later on.  My only gripe about the disc is that the overall picture quality lacks compared to other DVDs like Trigun and Ghost in the shell. Occasionally blurry and washed out, the picture is not as bad if played on an expensive player and TV, as opposed to a DVDrom.
Still, the average picture quality should not put anyone off this superb series. Having the English and Jap languages is real bonus. The definitive verion of Evangelion to get.",980553600,2,967,4.654970760233918

7928958,2,B000050IL8,"""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" is a double oddity: a weird, obscure work that's extremely popular, and also a critical darling that's frankly not all that good. There's a huge amount of potential in the series, I admit -- an unnervingly resonant premise, some engaging characters, uncommonly sophisticated monster designs, a general sense of creative fearlessness. But the series as a whole is such a careening, hacked-together mess that very little of that potential gets realized.

After a promising start, it first goes off the rails into a silly, sometimes creepy sex-comedy for a while. Then, as soon as it pulls itself back to more serious, thoughtful territory, it immediately collapses into self-indulgent pop psychology. There are plenty of intriguing, complex ideas floating around in the show's soupiness. But rather than exploring those themes through the setting and characters that the early episodes established, the later episodes just create thin excuses for montage-cum-therapy sessions that tell too much and show too little.

I've read that the show's creator, Hideaki Anno, developed the series while working through a deep depression, and that the show struggled both with budget constraints and with Anno's constantly shifting vision. All of that shows a little too much, and in the end I can see why Anno keeps returning to remake parts of the series -- it feels like a good idea never properly realized, the kind of thing that can eat at you until you figure out how to do it right.

If you want to see a more successful synthesis of a lot of the elements of this series -- like slapstick comedy, adolescent sexuality, sci-fi action, and psychedelic montages, among others -- I highly recommend FLCL instead. It doesn't have the same epic sweep or high seriousness, but given that both shows ultimately deal with pubescent psychology through the medium of giant robot fights, that's not a bad thing.",1465776000,3,1919,5.1050955414012735
