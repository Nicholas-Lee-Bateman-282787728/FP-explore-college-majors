8562389,5,B00B4JYJRQ,"Angel is legend both on and off the screen/stage. One of the biggest personalities I have had the pleasure of knowing and an exceptionally talented and original artist. Her story is not only fun to watch but it is an honest look at a living legend . They don't make women like this anymore! A must see.

8562392,5,B00B4JYJRQ,"I'm a fan of burlesque and queer cinema.  I really enjoyed this slice of history, much of which occurred right in my backyard (San Francisco).  It's a great documentary and Angel is an incredible human being.  I fell in love with her and Vic watching this movie.",1364947200,3,262,4.531914893617022
8562393,5,B00B4JYJRQ,"This documentary is great.  It's about burlesque, classic and neo, queerness, age, history.  I would definitely recommend it.  Additionally, anyone who likes this should also check out Exotic World and the Burlesque Revival ([...]).  They are very different, but include many of the same people.",1364515200,4,295,5.488888888888889
8562394,5,B00B4JYJRQ,"This was a very well made documentary of a famous burlesque performer's life.  I enjoyed seeing Angel's story told from her childhood in the 50's and her career path taking hold in the more liberated 60's to the present time.  I really liked seeing clips of her past performances and how she has evolved over the years.  She is very honest and open about her life, and she doesn't hold anything back.  It was fascinating to see how she has championed the art of burlesque and continues to inspire younger generations of burlesque performers today.",1364083200,4,547,4.726315789473684
8562395,5,B00B4JYJRQ,Well done. A raw and honest peek into the life of women in the burlesque circle. I love Satan's Angel - the movie and the legend! This was an enlightening and entertaining movie. -Jenny,1363996800,2,185,4.470588235294118
