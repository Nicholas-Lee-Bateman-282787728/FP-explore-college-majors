4699246,5,B005HE4TPQ,"This is one of my favorite workouts ever and I'm so glad to have found it here to replace the one I loaned to a friend and never saw again! (Worth it to me, though, if it helps her!)
I have to say that some of the other reviews got me a little riled up. The title of the listing is ""Turbo Jam 5 Rockin Workouts"" -- NOT ""Get the 6 dvds in the picture."" If you look at the picture of the 6 lined up the first one is clearly ""Turbo Jam 5 Rockin' Workouts"" -- which is a two dvd set with five workouts in one case. Obviously the reviewers didn't look at the picture clearly or bother asking if there was any confusion in their minds as to what they would be getting. I feel badly for the sellers who refunded the complainers.",1404691200,4,721,3.9452054794520546
4699247,5,B005HE4TPQ,"This set is great. The only thing that would be better is if it were all on one disk so you weren't cooling down from one workout as you waited for another to load disc. But, lots of fun and definitely doing the trick.",1400630400,,218,3.977272727272727
4699248,1,B005HE4TPQ,"I have been ripped off, like many of the other reviewers I see now.  I purchased the 6 DVD set for $28 from Miamisburg_Buybacks, and only recieved 1 DVD: the 5 rockin workouts double disc, and NONE of the other 5!!!
I have emailed the seller and am waiting to see what they intend to do about my order. If they think im Paying almost $30 for 1 USED dvd set their insane.  I think im geting that you should just buy Beachbody products directly from their website, and never on Amazon.  Save the hassles, frustration, and even get a new product!
AMAZON:  this is fraud and you need to take care of this.  obviously this is an ongoing issue and its ridiculous you let this continure to happen!!!!",1400025600,3,693,4.341085271317829
4699249,2,B005HE4TPQ,In the description it lists 5 different dvd's that complete the order. I already own 5 Rockin Workouts which is a great introduction to the Turbo Jam workouts. This is the only dvd that I received. I thought from the photo and description that it would be 5 separate dvd's like the description  mentions. I did not read the other reviews before buying and if I did I probably would not have bought this item. The other reviews mention only receiving one dvd too. If the other dvd's don't come I will be returning this item since I already own it. It is a great bundle price if ALL of the dvd's are received. If they are not all included maybe the photo and description should be modified to reflect the item actually sold.,1399507200,,722,4.388059701492537
4699250,1,B005HE4TPQ,"Lo and behold, I received the 5 rockin workouts double disc, but NONE of the others!!!

I am missing fat blaster, cardio party mix 3, punch, kick and jam, and the 3T dvd's....",1396051200,6,361,4.171428571428572
4699251,1,B005HE4TPQ,Ok so I read the previous review before I purchased these dvds and figured hey there was probably a mix up somewhere along the line. I decided to place my order anyway paid extra shipping to get my items in 2 to 6 days on day 5 I received my order. I said to myself this package feels light opened it up and only got 1 dvd the others never came! I contacted the seller/amazon and they apologized and I got a full refund. I was a little disappointed but got my money back and they said I could keep the dvd I received or disguard so I got over it quick,1395792000,8,551,3.9285714285714284

4699273,5,B005HE4TPQ,This is an amazing workout. I immediately felt results!  I don't diet and i only do the 20 minute video for now and I love how I feel. Charlene Johnson is so positive and fun. I got the video earlier then expected so I am very pleased with the vender.,1452384000,,251,4.02
4699274,5,B005HE4TPQ,"I bought this DVD set in 2005 after seeing an infomercial for it and it turned out to be the best fitness DVD set I've ever used.  Within six months, I had lost over 30 lbs and I got into the best shape of my life.  Recently, I got back into using them again and they are just as good now as they were over a decade ago.

First of all, Chalene Johnson is a terrific trainer and teacher.  She is very good at motivating you to keep pushing yourself and keep exercising.  She also has a really goofy and silly personality that really removes the intimidation factor from getting fit.  She's the kind of person you would want to hang out with in real life and you can easily see just how much she loves what she does and cares about helping people get results.

The exercises are a very effective combination of kickboxing, dancing, capoeira, and muscle toning with a great soundtrack of high-energy hip-hop remixes that Chalene developed herself.  I really appreciate that the exercises are perfectly synced with the music.  She also includes ""turbo"" sessions in each video, which is basically a form of interval training.  You get your heartrate up really high when the turbo siren goes off and then you bring it back down again after a 30 second water break with the next exercises.

When I was starting out with the videos, I found it very helpful that Anna Rita and Mindy demonstrated the lower-intensity versions of the exercises, so I could work my way up to the more intense versions.  The videos include a Learn & Burn set, where you can practice the ""Elite 11"" exercises and then use them for a beginner 15 minute workout.  From there, you move up to the 20 minute workout, 20 minute workout & Ab Jam, Cardio Party 1 (a longer and more intense cardio workout), and the Turbo Sculpting video for muscle toning.

You don't need much equipment for doing Turbo Jam.  I mostly just use the yoga mat and dumbbells I already owned before I got the videos.  If you get the other videos in the series, then you can also get some resistance bands and a balance ball, but I already owned those already too.

Overall, I highly recommend buying Turbo Jam if you are looking for an effective home workout DVD set.  It's pretty inexpensive to purchase these days and I got great results from it.  It's definitely worth it.",1452038400,2,2314,4.492822966507177

4699304,4,B005HE4TPQ,"This 5 workout set (on two DVDs) is the original Turbo Jam release from fitness producer Beachbody. Although I had tried some Turbo Jam workouts in the past, I recently had the opportunity to acquire the entire set, so I decided to go for it.

Turbo Jam is led by energetic instructor Chalene Johnson. She teaches live in front of a large class that always includes two modifiers, Mindy and Anna-Rita. No equipment is required for most of the workouts, although a light set of dumbbells is used for the strength routine (Turbo Sculpt), and a mat is helpful as well. Because I am a more experienced exercise (I work out daily), I also used my 1-lb. weighted gloves for these routines.

I have broken down each of the five included routines below.

LEARN & BURN
Learn & Burn provides both a 12-minute Tutorial plus a short (17-minute) beginners-level Turbo Jam workout. In the Tutorial, Johnson goes through the ""Elite 11"" Turbo Jam moves, breaking each one down step by step and then practicing the exercise several times before moving on. The exercises are as follows: 1) Turbo Tuck, 2) Pump, 3) Zig Zag, 4) Strike, 5) Twist, 6) Row, 7) ""W"", 8) 7 Step, 9) Shake & Shed, 10) Capoiera Step, and 11) Wheel. The workout covers virtually all of the moves introduced in the Tutorial. It also includes practice of all four punches (jab, cross, hook, upper) as well as side push, back push, and roundhouse kicks; there is a quick cool down to finish.

20-MINUTE WORKOUT
In the warm-up, Johnson introduces the jab and cross punches, plus she does a dynamic stretch combo which includes speedbags, arm circles, and a hamstring stretch. She then moves into several combinations. The first sequence starts with front-corner uppercut, front-corner hook, add a pump with jab, and then a high-low elbow. The next sequence has jab-cross-speedbags, then adds in a back kick-front knee. This is followed by the ""Turbo,"" a short higher energy, higher impact sequence with football drills, high jogs, and low blocks. Finally, the dance recovery includes uppercuts, quick jab-crosses, and a jab-knee-back kick, repeated on both sides. The 2-minute final stretch starts by going through some slow punches and then moves through a few quick stretches.

AB JAM
Although the DVD case says that Ab Jam is 40 minutes, this is the running time with extras (Jam'd, Meet the Cast); the actual workout time is approximately 18 minutes. The first half of the routine is performed standing. Johnson starts with a pelvic tilt/side crunch. She continues to weave in classic Turbo Jam moves such as wheel, emphasizing the core. Other exercises in the standing portion include a punch with hip lift, shake and shed, and side leg kick. At the 9-minute mark, the workout moves to the floor. Here Johnson mainly performs crunch-type moves, but often with a bit of a kickboxing twist. She starts with a simple pelvic tilt, adding a crunch, and then moves into a double leg stretch. Next is a side dip with reach, another crunch, and a brief stretch. This is followed by a partial roll-up with a knee lift, a side crunch, a cross-punch-crunch, a side-to-side crunch, a crunch with alternating legs, and finally, seated knee drops. A very brief (30 seconds) stretch concludes the workout.

CARDIO PARTY
This is the most intense workout in the set; it's about 43 minutes long. In the warm-up, Johnson again moves through the four basic punches (jab, cross, hook, upper) and performs several dynamic stretches. The first cardio combo combines the wheel with hook/cross punches, then adds in the strike and knee lifts. The next combination focuses more on kicks: starting with squat/side kick and then moving into knee/front push kick. Adding on, the sequence finishes with jab-cross-jab knee. There is one more cardio sequence that includes speed bag, upper cut, knee/back kick, and punches front. Then it's right into the ""Turbo,"" a higher energy segment with jogs and balancing knee lifts. Following this is the recovery dance party which includes cross-hook-upper punches to the corner and then zig-zag-knee. To finish the workout, there is finale (punches and other moves performed entirely in horse stance), an aerobic cool-down, and a quick stretch.

TURBO SCULPT
This is the one strength-based workout included in the set. Although Johnson suggests that you can use heavier weights, she and everyone except Mindy and Anna-Rita (who do not use weights) are using what appear to be 5-lb. dumbbells throughout; there isn't really time to switch weights between exercises. There is a short warm-up in which the weights are used for some lunge and overhead press work. Johnson then moves into several series of standing exercises. The first series is a lunge-focused sequence that includes lunges with bicep curls, lateral raises with leg abduction, curtsy with bicep curl, plie with lateral raise, and bicep curl with both rear leg curl and rear leg lift. The second series focus on squats, starting with narrow, medium, wide, and plie squats, taking these into pulses. These are followed by triceps kickbacks, bent over rows, additional plies with lateral raises, and additional lateral/front raises with one leg balance work. The next sequence is traveling lunges which move forward, back, and then a tapping version. Additional standing exercises include a one-arm row with a posterior delt row, VERY brief standing core work with a single weight, a pulsing lunge to center/either side, and some inner thigh work (plies and one-leg squat variations). The workout concludes on the floor with a short sequence of chest flies followed by abs work (plank, side crunches). Johnson concludes with a quick 2-minute stretch, bringing in the total time for the workout at just under 40 minutes.

Overall, this is a good set, especially for beginning to intermediate exercisers who enjoy kickboxing with a dancey flavor. I do feel that Johnson's instruction is a bit lacking--although she mirror cues and offers frequent form pointers, she often fails to cue movement changes, and some of the moves that she does aren't covered in the ""Learn & Burn"" Tutorial. Furthermore, whereas some enjoy her high-energy personality, I find her a bit over-the-top, and she can be quite annoying to me if I spend too much time with her. Still, in small doses, I enjoy these workouts, and I would recommend this set.",1430611200,14,6352,4.991501416430595
