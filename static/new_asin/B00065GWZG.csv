8038938,5,B00065GWZG,Goodness knows this isn't a western. It's a totally brill comedy about a mutant goat and a thoroughly disgusting U.K. family! The DVD quality is absolutely amazing given the film's very small budget - picture and sound are first-rate! Check it out.,1111708800,,248,4.928571428571429
