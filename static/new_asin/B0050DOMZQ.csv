4513983,2,B0050DOMZQ,"DMa Chris Hazenberg film

stars: Benjamin Barton.

A World Wide Multi Media release.

So,One of the worst examples of Bait/Switch on a movie poster in decades !

The actual Dark Measures has some good qualities ( lead victim turned vigilante, her father coming back to her after 25 years,The son character of our heroine,The detective and gorgeous Washington woods as a locale).

The Bad is pretty in viewers face,Lots of violence to women-children and old people,Some acting is just PITUUUU ! The Gang has no remorse,appears to really be drinking and physically violent when even not called for by script or director.

So, to sum this critique,Movie was okay and even had some elements of TAKEN movies with Liam Neeson.",1405296000,,720,4.958333333333333

4513985,5,B0050DOMZQ,Recently I have seen a few indie movies that production values are just at another level. Really good to see movies like this pushing the envelope. Going to watch it again soon.,1374710400,,177,4.5625
4513986,1,B0050DOMZQ,"Sheer garbage movie , pathetic acting and s****y camerawork , its a flat plot , fails to build up climax because of its dullness , not even B grade worthy , just made by some one talentless who didn't know what else to do other than wasting viewers time and money",1364083200,2,263,4.176470588235294
4513987,4,B0050DOMZQ,I really dig action movies and this is definitely a good one. Hot chick to boot. Can't go wrong there. Check it out you won't regret it.,1362528000,,136,4.074074074074074

8451099,2,B0050DOMZQ,"I am not sure what movie this DVD cover if for, but that doesn't look like anything in the film. In fact I would have liked to have watched whatever film that was to the one I just saw. None of those people are in the film. This review is based on the US Amazon description of the film and not the DVD cover photo.

The opening scene we see a girl set on fire by a gang of four, very punk looking guys driving an antique 48 Oldsmobile in a small town and the police have trouble finding them. Following that incident we see a ""Day 1"" sign which means what? Day 1 after the incident? Is this a flashback leading up to the fire? It is after the incident which later was described as being 3 weeks ago, 6 days later. So anyway, the gang rape Molly (Michelle L. Ruiz) and leave her for dead along side of the road. Some guy films it and...he just films it in super 8 or something. The cops go after the guys (they drive the same roads everyday) and you can write the rest.

The film was rather boring. It is supposed to let us know about violence to women with a light version of ""I Spit on Your Grave.""  It didn't make it. Acting was bad too.

Guide: F-bomb, rape. No nudity.",1441584000,3,1172,4.038793103448276
