1920222,4,B0000D0YWQ,"If you're a certain age, remember those gory films in ""Driver's Ed"" classes? HELL'S HIGHWAY (Kino International) is the true story of highway safety films. Two discs document the filmmakers and their grisly anecdotes, with clips from numerous flicks. Includes three uncut classics with lots of mangled teen bodies. Campy, informative and authentically horrifying.",1066953600,18,363,5.7407407407407405

1920224,5,B0000D0YWQ,"HELL'S HIGHWAY is a documentary about those educational / safety films that flickered in many a darkened classroom in the 1950s-60s. Of course, the best of these films were the Drivers Ed. movies. Hyper-dramatic, preachy, and, in retrospect, extremely entertaining, these moralistic tales are very watchable today. The concept of ""TEENICIDE"" , the idea that teenagers are an accident waiting to happen, is as hilarious now as it was serious then. The switch from the early, choreographed films, to those containing actual accident footage is also chronicled. The shocking images are discussed, as well as the impact and reasoning behind them. Even the ghoulish nature of the films and the moviemakers -and those creepy narrators!- themselves are examined. Though the films are exploitative and manipulative, HELL'S HIGHWAY itself is quite informative. It even explores the Highway Safety Foundation, and its alleged connections to pornography, and an actual murder mystery involving one of its photographers, and an interesting segment w/ Jimmy Hoffa! Plus, the company's most controversial films about homosexual encounters and child molestation. The latter film traumatized many an elementary school student! Yikes! Highly recommended...",1409702400,2,1239,5.702702702702703
1920225,5,B0000D0YWQ,I was in drivers training in 1972.  It brought back fond memories.  I told my parents I would be safe as long as I never drove in Ohio.  I personally thought they were effective.,1408924800,,178,4.176470588235294

1920227,3,B0000D0YWQ,"I love documentaries, but this one isn't going to be on my top 10 list.  This was an unusual subject and I recalled seeing ""For want of a seatbelt"" in high school (not mentioned in this film, oddly).  There is something nostalgic about this film, but then it started drifting into possible adult movie tie-ins to the company that made the crash movies.  I just kinda lost interest about halfway through.",1402876800,,403,4.647887323943662
1920228,5,B0000D0YWQ,"I thought that this doc might be at least somewhat intriguing as it pertains to those driver's education movies that have become sort of legendary for those of us who weren't subjected to them as teenagers.  It definitely delivers in that regard, but it also probes deeper into the individuals who created them and how their brand of safety films began branching out into other areas of human behavior.  So I was pleasantly surprised to see it was even better than I'd expected.  Sweet!!  (Oh, and I have no clue what anti-christian sentiment one could have possibly taken away from watching this.  I guess it might have been common sense??  Honesty??  I think the underlying message was that those films were created with the intent to protect people. but they essentially failed to do so in the end.  Oh, that's it!!  Admitting that they might have been wrong was very un-christian of them.)  So please be careful behind the wheel.  You can start by skipping church.",1400889600,,968,4.771084337349397
1920229,5,B0000D0YWQ,"Whatever your views on these low budget, by-gone era safety films may be, there is a fascinating story behind how it all came about and the men and women who made it happen. Personally, i saw very few of these films in school as they had been replaced by more current ones in the 80's, but I have seen most on VHS/DVD and YouTube since. Like many other cult-film fanatics I love the old Coronet Instructional Films and all the Highway Safety films as well. There are plenty of the grisly scenes from the films to make the most squeamish run for cover! A fun look back at a by-gone era.",1400371200,,585,4.2792792792792795
1920230,5,B0000D0YWQ,"Reality film making before reality TV. Graphic scenes and 50's style dry matter-of-fact narration makes this a creepy watch.

1920243,2,B0000D0YWQ,"I was interested in this because I was doing a  post on this topic on a car site. However, this video seemed to be a mix of the history of driving safety films and a suggestion of nefarious deeds by the company that pioneered them. That dubious dual focus, plus the guy in the tee-shirt doing commentary, left me thinking this film did not have much to offer.",1394928000,,359,4.279411764705882
1920244,1,B0000D0YWQ,"The old black and white traffic death scenes were, as anticipated, intrusive and disturbing. One wonders how the family members of the (usually) clearly recognizable victims would feel! However, what really was unwanted and disturbing, not to mention totally out of context with no warnings listed, was the footage shown from surveillance of a public men's restroom which showed several men engaged in homosexual sex.

1920245,3,B0000D0YWQ,"It was well worth at least a partial watch. I feared that it might be just a parade of gore, but instead it was a well-documented look at the films and the filmmakers that contributed so vividly to our shared high-school experience.",1393632000,,232,4.5476190476190474

1920265,4,B0000D0YWQ,"This documentary about the Highway Safety Foundation brought back memories. I saw ""The Child Molester"" in grammar school in the late 1960s.  We had a special evening assembly to watch it but the principal shut off the film projector as soon as the film cut to the bloody scenes.  I never saw the end with the crime scene photos of the murdered children until now.  And I saw ""Signal 30"" in driver's ed class a few years later.  Seeing ""Signal 30"" was a rite of passage in those days, at least in our high school.  Compared to what most kids have seen on TV, in movies, and on the internet these days, ""Signal 30"" seems a little tame today.  The scenes of butchered children in ""The Child Molester"" are a little hard to take even now.
I'm not sure that the filmmakers were certain what they were trying to accomplish with ""Hell's Highway.""  It's part history, part expose, and part examination of a social phenomenon that showed graphic violent imagery to a captive audience that otherwise might never have seen it, all under the guise of education.
If you saw any of these movies and wonder where they came from, you'll want to see ""Hell's Highway.""  If you only heard about them and wonder what all the fuss was about, then you'll probably still want to see it.  If you're under 40 and were raised on slasher films and violent video games, you're likely to be mystified as to why the ""educational films"" from the Highway Safety Foundation would have ever been considered controversial.",1374969600,2,1486,4.598484848484849
1920266,5,B0000D0YWQ,"Interesting to look back on these old films and how they tried to  scare people into driving safely.some of the pictures a pretty graphic and gruesome but that is what they had in mind to make people especially young drivers aware of the consequences of recklessness driving..interesting to remember how the cars of yesteryear had no safety equipment as today's cars do I,m sure a lot of them would have survived with seat belts and air bags. All in all  a great film well done and definitely worth seeing",1373328000,,505,4.662921348314606
1920267,4,B0000D0YWQ,I gave this documentary 4 stars. The film manages to put Highway Safety Films into context with other kinds of industrial and public service movies. I'm one of the few who didn't actually see any films like this in school or in drivers education so the mythology of their shock factor hit home for me. The idea of waiting throughout a film for the required tragedy you know could happen at ANY TIME seems a strange formula. I wonder how effective these films really were in preventing fatal accidents. If you enjoy weird documentaries and industrial film this is a good film fix.,1371427200,,579,4.631067961165049
1920268,4,B0000D0YWQ,"the cynical documentary crap from the ""oh too kewl"" jerks isn't.

I wonder why it is that they always have to try to make something out of stuff that just isn't there. The Highway Safety footage is meant to scare the bejesus out of teen drivers. From what I remember, it worked! I certainly drove a lot more carefully after seeing these movies!

What's interesting, I found, is that so much of this footage is from one town in Ohio. How the films got started is interesting. I can live without Prelinger trying to say that pretty much no human being is responsible for anything that happens to them (from car crashes to industrial accidents.)

If you look at this being what it is - and ignore the glib post-modern crap of which there is thankfully little - it's pretty (horribly) fascinating.",1371081600,,793,4.570422535211268
1920269,3,B0000D0YWQ,a window into the past allowing us to view how much simpler times were and how we were influenced by the government and other agency's. with the advance of time and society I can see how these have evolved into popcorn flicks,1366329600,,225,4.380952380952381
1920270,4,B0000D0YWQ,"I don't even know where to go with this movie. It's not the type of movie I would normally watch. I'm not a blood, guts or ghoulish person. I can't stand horror, slasher and scary movies of any type. Yet, I started watching this movie, for God knows what reason, and I found it interesting and eye opening. It wasn't the fact that it was about accident films. It was enlightening as a social commentary on where the United States was during the decades they made these types of films. For example, they discussed how WWII children were somewhat unsupervised. The fathers were off to war and their mothers were working outside the home. Daycare and after school programs really didn't exist as they do now. There was a faction of children that ran free, which in turn created a perception that instructional movies on life were needed. The generational factors that influenced highway crash, police training, morality and cultural indoctrination films was, for me, utterly fascinating.

When my husband came home that evening I found myself talking about this film, relaying all that I had seen (some which was rather gross) and about how these films portrayed a slice of American life on many levels.  My husband thought the movie sounded horrible and couldn't perceive any value in watching the film.  I can completely understand how someone could think that. Maybe I'm an undercover weirdo. All I know is that I liked this film.  It made me a bit uncomfortable, caused me think outside my regular box and it sated a twisted curiosity.

*This film is NOT FOR CHILDREN - AT ALL. There are several graphic accident scenes with limbs severed, blood, dead bodies etc. There is also a brief scene of homosexual acts - quite blurred out but graphic enough to shock me a bit.",1364688000,4,1769,4.749185667752443
1920271,2,B0000D0YWQ,"Why oh WHY did I watch this?!  I should have known better, but NOOOO, I had to act cavalier in front of my husband who asked me several times, ""Are you sure you should be watching this?""  Me: ""Pah! Big deal! I can handle this just fine!""

I was wrong.

I've seen several violent, scary, and gory movies in my time. I even watched autopsies and operations in grad school. This was different. I guess my psyche can't handle ""real"" suffering and death, and I admire people who have to deal with it all the time. Thank God for all you cops, nurses, doctors, and EMTs.  Funeral staff too.  Four days later, and the images are still seared in to my mind.

As another reviewer said, most of us seem to be drawn to stuff like this, but if I could go back in time, there's NO WAY I would have watched this disturbing documentary.

Having said this, I can understand the impact and effectiveness films like this must have had on teenage drivers - on ALL drivers.  If I had seen this when I was a teen, I wouldn't have left the house!  Granted, we had seat belts and air bags when I was a teenager, but those didn't always prevent serious injuries and death of course.  Still don't.

If you have a sensitivity to true-life images and videos of suffering and death (a child in one scene), then be forewarned.  I wish I had known how bad it would be.  Now I feel I should watch Finding Nemo or The Sound of Music to help erase these horrifying images from my mind.",1364083200,3,1451,4.248175182481752
1920272,4,B0000D0YWQ,"I thought it was really interesting to discover the origin of those gory driver's ed movies we had to watch back in the day (Do they still do that?)
It was a little disturbing that the company also thought taking the camera into the men's restrooms were a good idea but supposedly it was for law enforcement education...
It seems a little creepy though that they rushed to the accident scenes and staged a few to make them MORE horrible",1363824000,2,436,4.4625
1920288,2,B0000D0YWQ,"This film documents an interesting part of American culture, but it was too intense for me. The music was depressing and so was the subject matter. I'm sure it's an accurate and informative representation of the events but it was just too much for me. But I'm rather sensitive to horrifying death and gore. I'm not one  of those people who stops to look at bad car accidents hoping to catch a glimpse of carnage. But if you are, then you will love this!  :-)",1363046400,,458,4.376470588235295
1920289,4,B0000D0YWQ,"This video provides an interesting and balanced view of the development of highway safety films. Some of the video is difficult to watch, but the video delivers what it promises.",1260662400,,178,4.966666666666667
1920290,3,B0000D0YWQ,"I liked seeing the footage itself and the premise was supposed to be how driver's ed films evolved.  I loved seeing the footage of old ambulances and the ""emergency care"" and transport of the injured.  I think anyone going into EMS or police work should be required to watch. It escapes a bit from its primary goal. In fact the highway safety films remind me of a primordial version of the TV series, ""Emergency!""

There is some CYA pertaining to the Highway Safety Foundation's alleged ties to criminals and pornography.  Martin Yant wrote a book, ""Rotten To The Core"" and a sequel (came out after this documentary.) The latter book talks about Mansfield, OH's corruption- including the Highway Safety Foundation.  The filmmaker tries to not get into accusing the HSF of corruption but is sucked into mentioning the accusations.  He tries to be a gracious host to all those shown in this video.",1231372800,3,895,4.816993464052287
1920291,3,B0000D0YWQ,"Like driving by a bad car crash, it's hard to avert your eyes from this one (especially if you took driver's ed in the Sixties). . .even though you may wish you did.

It's ostensibly a documentary about the Ohio company that produced those legendary high school driving class gore-a-thons of the Sixties (complete with blood-drenched film clips and what are initially fascinating interviews with the company's few surviving associates). But formula soon becomes repetitive with same talking heads appearing again and again (admittedly unavoidable; few of the company's principals are still alive today) and eventually even the sameness of glut of gruesome wreck footage loses its impact.

Evidently realizing they're running out of gas, filmmakers flesh out last quarter of picture with interesting but unrelated tales of the company's downfall and film output unrelated to driving safety. There are unsubstaniated interviews suggesting that company was also producing porn, bizarre clips from a police shoplifting video in which women walk out of a store with meat and a shoe-polishing buffer tucked between their legs (!), animated excerpts of a 1960 educational child molestor film produced by a totally different company, a notorious clip of a stoned-looking Sonny Bono warning of the dangers of marijuana (again, not produced by Ohio company) and, even brief but shockingly graphic hidden-camera footage of actual homosexual trysts in a public toilet in Ohio. (Oh, yes, even Sammy Davis Jr. gets dragged into this mess. . . via reports of a doomed highway safety telethon doomed in part by his allegedly huge ego.)

More of a mondo hodge-podge than a straight drivers-ed movie history, this one is all over the road. But for some viewers of outre taste, getting there will be half the fun.",1220659200,4,1794,5.200692041522491
1920292,5,B0000D0YWQ,"I have to say that I have a warm spot for these films. Before you think I am a gore hound or nutcase, allow me to explain. First as a native Ohioan, I found it very interesting that Ohio was ground zero for these movies. It also brought back memories of when I took drivers ed. at John Marshall High in 1974. I remember sitting next to this girl that I wanted to impress. During the real bloody scenes, I would pull a Three Musketers out of my lunch and make comments. I never got a date with her, wonder why? I loved the segment on the history of the company, its growth and downfall. Again, great transfer. Well worth the money.",1213315200,4,630,4.172131147540983
1920293,4,B0000D0YWQ,"Oh, the days of driver's education! What a fun experience that was, eh? A bunch of kids packed into a classroom to study the ins and outs of stop signs, speed limits, and turn signals. Those were the days. For many of us, the most memorable part of the class was the day Officer Friendly came into the classroom, set up the film/slide projector, and proceeded to show twenty or thirty minutes of good old fashioned highway carnage. Long before I sat down to enjoy such gorefests as George Romero's Dead Trilogy or any of the Friday the 13th films, I saw scenes of stomach churning violence in driver's education class. It's sort of sad to say that my class didn't watch any of the films on display in the documentary ""Hell's Highway."" What we did see was a state trooper come into class with a series of slides far worse than anything witnessed in this two disc DVD set dedicated to the history of safety films. Moreover, the cop in our class stood at the front of the room and fairly screamed at all of us about how we'd end up ground into pudding in a car wreck if we ever broke a traffic law. What a guy!

When I learned about Bret Wood's documentary, I knew I had to see it if only to discover the same scenes of human misery I witnessed back then made an appearance here. No such luck. We never watched ""Signal 30,"" ""Mechanized Death,"" or any of the other atrocities released by the Highway Safety Foundation (HSF) of Mansfield, Ohio. That's the organization behind the vast majority of traffic safety films and the focus of ""Hell's Highway."" According to the film, an accountant with an obsession for police work, Richard Wayman, started down the path to forming the organization way back in the 1950s. A fan of photography, Wayman arrived on the scene of a particularly destructive crash one night and offered to take pictures of the accident in order to help the police. The officer on the scene agreed, and it wasn't too long before Wayman began compiling a photographic record of horrific car wrecks. He convinced a couple of other people to help him, one of them a journalist by the name of John Dohmer, and the media picked up on their preoccupation. It was only a hop, skip, and a screech of metal on metal to throwing a film camera into the mix. Their first film, ""Signal 30,"" came out in a few years later. Soon, the newly formed Highway Safety Foundation began sending out the film to schools across the country.

The organization grew by leaps and bounds into the 1970s with a number of new car crash films: ""Mechanized Death,"" ""Carrier or Killer,"" ""Highways of Agony""--you get the idea. Maybe you've seen a few of these films. Death sells, and business was good in the 1950s and 1960s. To capitalize on their success, Wayman's organization began branching out into other avenues of human misery. They started making films for training police officers; films like ""The Shoplifter,"" a really sick one about a pair of killings in Mansfield involving children, and ""A Great and Honorable Duty."" They also started encountering serious problems. When the Mansfield police department discovered that highly objectionable behavior was occurring in a local public restroom, the authorities brought in the HSF to capture the shenanigans with a hidden camera. Unfortunately, we see some of that footage in the documentary. More problems occurred, some of them sinister enough to catch the attention of a journalist named Martin Yant. He wrote a series of stories about financial irregularities at the Highway Safety Foundation, their failed attempt to earn money through a national telethon, and other behaviors best left unmentioned here. The organization eventually folded in the 1970s but was briefly resurrected by Earle J. Deems for a few years before disappearing forever.

An interesting and intriguing documentary, this ""Hell's Highway."" While I agree with the myriad claims that the structure of the presentation is a bit on the slipshod side, I don't think that takes anything away from the underlying intrigue of the whole thing. After living through the experience of watching absolutely soul shattering car wrecks, in school no less, several questions should have went through all those impressionable minds. Who the heck made these things? Why? And who thought trying to scare the living daylights out of new drivers was a good idea? ""Hell's Highway"" adequately addresses all of those questions. The men behind the Highway Safety Foundation genuinely seemed to care about their fellow human beings, and they cared about stopping the massive numbers of individuals dying each day on the nation's roads. It soon becomes apparent that these are not gorehounds out engaging in cheap thrills by filming bloody disasters. They believe, and that belief comes through crystal clear in the documentary, that the ""scared straight"" approach to traffic safety prevented deaths. And perhaps it did. We'll never know because there isn't a way to measure lives saved due to the films' influence.

Extras on the disc are well worth watching, if you can stomach them. We get outtakes and trailers on disc number one, but number two contains the real goods. ""Signal 30,"" ""Highways of Agony,"" and ""Options to Live"" appear here in their full color gory...er, I mean glory. Also included are many excerpts--most running a minute or two in length--of the other Highway Safety Foundation's films. We also get a text interview with director Bret Wood and a text history of the HSF. Many of the things you'll see on this disc are mind blasting in their brutality, but you'll gaze on this mayhem with fascination if you've sat through something similar in a driver's education class. I wonder if they're still showing this stuff today?",1122681600,55,5730,4.867827868852459
1920294,4,B0000D0YWQ,I found the narration on this to be the best part. Very creepy. It is too bad most 16 year olds are too busy drinking and driving to stop and take the time to be horrified by this.,1112400000,9,180,3.763157894736842
1920295,3,B0000D0YWQ,"I agree with the other reviewers that the concept behind doing this DVD was great, but the actual end product leaves a lot to be desired.  Yes, the clips from the films are presented in a disjointed fashion, and the background information on the folks that pioneered Highway Safety Films was a snoozer.  After I received this DVD through an online rental service I eagerly popped it into my DVD player and was initially very impressed.  The menus are slickly done, and the film gets off to a good start.  But about 15 minutes into it I realized that I wasn't enjoying it - and was becoming frustrated by it - for the very reasons mentioned above and in other reviews.  Namely, no sooner than they started showing scenes from a film and I started getting into it they would cut back to the stodgy characters.  Very bad flow and editings indeed.  A much better approach in my opinion would have been to feature the uncut films as the main course, and condense all the background stories as one or more of the extras featured on disc 2.  That way we could have still gotten the stories about how the Highway Safety Films got started and the background of those involved without it interfering with the enjoyment of the films themselves.",1108080000,16,1233,4.547511312217194
1920296,3,B0000D0YWQ,"wanted to watch this film a lot, but very disillusioned last night after doing so. the safety films themselves are gory and super interesting to watch, especially when you consider teenagers were subjected to viewing such bloody carnage, in the classroom no less....
but like another reviewer mentioned, the clips seem scattered all over the place, somewhat randomly. the interviews done with the relevant (older) characters are slow, often tedious, with unnecessary, very uninteresting info (i think a 1/3 of the film deals with where the characters came from and how they knew each other) that seems to drag on at times. the younger people interviewed were clearly more articulate and informative, but you don't feel it all clicks together in the end.
the cool bonus is disc 2 which includes 3 uncut original safety films, and other items. but the movie itself... well, i felt i was watching a classroom education film with the click click click of the projector behind me.",1089244800,10,975,4.987730061349693
1920297,2,B0000D0YWQ,"This video documents the heyday of the gruesome driver's safety films that used to be shown to students in many schools.  Renowned for their use of actual footage of dead and injured people from traffic accidents, they have become the stuff of urban legend over the years.  This film chronicles how a small group of Ohio volunteers began recording the aftermaths of accidents, the evolution of the films, and how they were received by their audiences.
I'm sure that there is an interesting film to be made here, but this one misses the mark.  I wanted to know more about those people who began shooting these pictures and what motivated them to do it.  After all, it's a very strange hobby to take up: dragging oneself out of bed at a moment's notice to rush out to an accident site and take a gruesome photo or film.  Once their Highway Safety Films business was a going concern, there was a profit motive, but the filmmakers never push hard enough to find out what had them out there in the first place, before the first film or safety presentation had ever been made.
The film is unfocused as well.  It wastes time on sketchy allegations of mob connections and illegal porno production, passing up the opportunity to spend more time with a small-time video dealer who packages those films for the current generation as gory freak-shows along the lines of the ""Faces of Death"" series.  It would have been interesting to know what the makers of the original films think about how they are being received today.  Other aspects of the topic, such as the essentially hostile and abusive nature of showing this material to young kids is touched on, but not examined adequately.",1088208000,4,1674,4.689419795221843

Well done documentary and was interesting to see went on behind the scenes.  More disturbing however was the traffic carnage that came from a town of only 42,000 people.  I shudder to think what traffic accidents were like in larger metropolitan areas.",1417996800,,364,5.033333333333333
