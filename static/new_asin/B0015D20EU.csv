8258061,2,B0015D20EU,"I try to have faith in low-budget horror movies, but ""Sight"" was simply a let down for several reasons.

Sight follows the story of Jeffrey, a young man tormented by constant visions of dead people. He meets a beautiful young woman who shares his visions, but things take a turn for the worse after she mysteriously goes missing. Still haunted by visions of angry spirits, Jeffrey searches for clues that will provide answers to the woman's disappearance.

There's not much good news about the film. It's a bit of a neo-noir, with cool opening credits, and an interesting movie score. Allison Persaud is drop-dead gorgeous as the mysterious young woman, though she gets far too little screen time.

As far as the downsides, there are plenty. First and foremost, the audio for the movie was mixed down horribly. You can barely make out spoken dialogue unless your volume is totally raised. But the sound effects and jump cut sounds are so incredibly loud, it's downright annoying, and enough to wake the neighbors.

The film's visual style borrows too heavily from Japanese horror flicks a la The Grudge. The lead actor (also the film's producer) has virtually no acting experience. Most of the cast has only appeared in movies as uncredited extras, so you can't expect much in the way of acting. The story itself is fairly confusing, and the inevitable twist just isn't exciting. Normally I would say that you should watch a movie once through Netflix before you consider buying the DVD. In this case, I'd say pass on even watching it online, you won't be missing out on much.",1310860800,,1576,4.804428044280443
