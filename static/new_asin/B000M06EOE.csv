8165495,5,B000M06EOE,"This set contains all the episodes from the hit series plus the CGI movie Kong: Return To The Jungle. Each DVD volumes of the series contain 10 episodes per dics. Though the series is good, I still feel they humanized Kong a little bit too much.

The villians of the series include De La Porta who steals the primal stones and uses their powers to get what he wants. But, the best villian of the series is Chiros. He is a powerful being that wants to cover the world in darkness. To me, De La Porta is just a pest, while Chiros and his minions are the real threat. It is a shame the series didn't focus on Chiros as much. He truelly is a cool villian.

While the set is great, there is no bonus features. This is a slight disappointment but you get your moneys worth. The best episodes are those that envolve Chiros and his minions Harpy and Ominous (he is to Kong as Abomination is to The Hulk). It's a shame that a live action movie has not came out. If it were, it should be about Chiros' return.

Anyways, buy this set. It's cheap and you'll get your moneys worth out of it. So, what are you waiting for? Buy now and enjoy Kong: The Animated Series!",1231632000,4,2229,4.292857142857143
