2009256,5,B0001KNDTE,"A friend of mine bought this DVD thinking it was finally the famous George Cukor version of DAVID COPPERFIELD, and when he found out it was not (it's not even on DVD yet) he was, well, disappointed is a good word for it.  But when I heard of his mistake, the only thing I could think of was, don't sent it back to Amazon, let me have it!  For David Copperfield fans, we have long ago forgiven him for using such a stupid pseudonym, we don't even think any more about how he got his name.  No one asks Siegfried and Roy if their real names are Siegfried and Roy, and yet David Copperfield gets flack about this constantly, not to mention dissed in the press for his relationship with Claudia Schiffer.

Some say that their engagement was just for show, and when Tom Cruise proposed to Katie Holmes recently, some commentators cast back to the famous Schiffer-Copperfield liaison which was widely thought of to be a contract.  On this DVD you can see that the love that they shared was no ""ILLUSION.""  There's a lot of Claudia here and I hope that her fans all have a copy of this magic disk, which truly has the best of both worlds, eye-popping stunts, and eye-popping high fashion beauty.  They both dress in stylish outfits that the late Gianni Versace made especially for them!  Copperfield has special cutaway clothes that allow him to make the dangerous escapes a la Houdini.  DC fans know that if anyone in the world had access to any of the magician's secrets, it was Versace, but he was often called in for the planning and the surprises.  Since his tragic death, Donatella has sometimes worked with DC, but not often, the two just don't care for each other.

You will find so much commentary on this disk you wonder how he can keep his secrets to himself.  But he does!  Watch him walk right through the ""forbidden passage"" of the Great Wall.  Watch him make the Statue of Liberty disappear from its perch in New York harbor.  You'll be rubbing your eyes wondering how in the world he did it.  Magic at its best, or my name ain't Houdini.",1121299200,12,2046,4.445040214477212
2009257,5,B0001KNDTE,"This is art of magic and illusion at its very best - unparalleled - creative, daring, heartwarming.  The majority of this DVD presents 15 years of David's stunning grand illusion - disappearing Statue of Libery, vanishing a train, vanishing an airplane, walking through a Great Wall in China, levitating, flying, and much more ... even the viewers disappear and reappear.  There is also some sleight-of-hand magic and a lot of extras - including a brief visit to David's Museum of Magic.

Among his many brilliant ideas and hard work, I was delighted that he has also initiated a ""Project Magic"" - intended to teach simple magic tricks and help develop dexterity in people who are disabled as adjunct to their treatments not only to help with their therapy, but also to help enhance their self-esteem.",1102118400,21,801,4.9185185185185185
2009258,5,B0001KNDTE,"For all fans: You must have this DVD!
For everyone that does not know who is the best magician of our time: You must have this DVD!
I enjoy every time I watch it. Just unbelivable! The worst thing about this DVD is that it's the only one of its kind. If they release anything new I would buy them all. You must too. Well - not the same as seeing him at live show but still the best.
Enjoy!",1093046400,5,389,3.875

2009260,5,B0001KNDTE,"David Copperfield is one of the best magicians in the world today. His showmanship and presentation skills are brilliant. He performs everything from close up to grand illusions.
If I'm in a bad mood, I will watch Copperfield perform and I feel so much better. I cant recommend this enough. Its the best magic DVD out there. Buy it, you won't regret it.",1084665600,8,353,4.619047619047619

A must have for all magic lovers, magicians, and other students and fans of magic & illusion.",1285891200,,306,4.903846153846154
2009274,4,B0001KNDTE,"This DVD is always entertaining to watch.  David Copperfield is more than just a good looking magician.  He knows how to tease and entice his audience.  He picks the right music for stimulation, the right costumes for dramatic flare, and of course, very good looking girls to work with while he performs his tricks on stage.

His stage shows are very colorful and artistic.  Mystifying as well as dark and sensual. And is always entertaining to watch even through we know what's going to happen because we've already watched these performances several times by now.  But, even though, this was just a collection of his past performances put together for a ""made for TV"" special, I really do believe that it is worthy of a high Definition re-mastering and made available as a Blu-Ray release.  Who knows when we'll ever see a more entertaining magician in our lifetime.  These episodes of dramatic, as well as sensual performances of magic should go down as a documented means of history as David Copperfield is probably the most celebrated magician since Houdini.

If you agree, let's hear your two cents worth.",1280620800,3,1111,4.867021276595745
2009275,4,B0001KNDTE,"He starts by showing you 15 objects in a circle.  He tells you to pick a number between 1 and 15 and count each number as one object.  Then he takes away the 3 objects and tell you to go back the same number of objects you just counted.  Then he takes away some more objects one of them being the rainbow and tells you to go back or forward four spaces.  Any moron would see that once he tells you to go back the same number of spaces and takes away the more objects there are only eight objects left.  Than he tells you to go forward or backward 4 objects.  Well since there are only 8 object left the one in the middle will be the one you chose.  I got this after watching it only one time.  There are 15 objects he tells you to count.  He takes away 3 leaving 12 objects.  Tell you to count back what ever number you choice takes away 4 objects leaving 8.  Than tells you to go forward or backward 4 spaces.  The answer any moron knows will always be the moon.  I am paying 35.00 dollars for a tape at least don't show we tricks that a 5th grader could figure out.

Because of this trick I gave the DVD 4 stars instead of 5.  The rest of the DVD was great except for the Saw of Death.  If you recall the Mask Magician showed in one of his episodes how this trick was done.  I am a state worker and have no knowledge of magic so 95 percent of the tricks I had no idea how they were done.  However if you happen to be an amater magician you might get some of them.  However I doubt that you will get the statue of Liberty Disapearing or him making an airplane and a train dissapear.  Over all a great DVD just a few stupid tricks that any body could figure out.",1237075200,,1662,3.933933933933934
