4525419,4,B0051O0NCA,"I thoroughly enjoyed this trilogy.  It is so much better than Volume 1.  Great acting, editing and sound...a true testament to horror creativity.  Of the three, I enjoyed ""On Sabbath Hill"" the most, followed by ""Dust"".  George Romero has made amends for his disappointing first volume.  This one was designed for mature adults...volume 1 was more for the younger set.  Good job.  Four stars.  When is Volume 3 coming out?",1396396800,2,421,4.914285714285715
4525420,3,B0051O0NCA,"Romero's second volume of Deadtime Stories, like the first, comes as a disappointment with, once again, two out of three being uninspiring. Give this one a miss unless you've got plenty of time to spare.",1387238400,,203,4.828571428571428

4525422,4,B0051O0NCA,"See other reviews for content. if you enjoy films like paranormal activity, Ring-O, a haunting in connecticut (which i do not) you'll certainly like this. this is top shelf modern horror. If you accept modern horror than don't hesitate to purchase this. if you like your horror oldschool, this will still appeal to you. I tend to avoid any horror past the turn of the century.i just don't find it scarry and don't appreaciate the way its filmed; lightning editing, CGI, etc...  i enjoy mostly silver age horror from the mid 70's - throught the late 80's/early 90's. ... i decided to give this a chance since its george romero and an anthology. i would describe this as modern horror done in classic fashion. both the stories and acting are much better than average. for 5 bucks this isn't a bad investment. take the plunge, you won't be dissapointed.",1346284800,2,850,4.704697986577181
4525423,3,B0051O0NCA,"Okay, why can't I find the first one?  Number two is filled with three gory horror stories, one about three people trapped in a gorge and getting desperate, one about a professor whose vengeful student gets back at him posthumously, and another about the healing yet deadly effects of Martian dust.

Fun times if you are into this.",1338681600,,331,4.689655172413793
4525424,4,B0051O0NCA,This purchase is for a secret santa request.  The DVD was in the shape that was described. The recipient was very pleased and happy with the gift.,1325635200,,146,4.407407407407407
4525425,3,B0051O0NCA,"George Romero introduces the tales similar to Creepshow. I was expecting something light with a twist, but that was not the case. In the first tale, 3 spelunkers go into a cave only to get trapped...and one is injured. We know what happens here. The unexpected part, the part that should make the story a hit or miss, comes after the rescue. In this story, it was pretty much a miss unless you watch strictly for blood and gore.

In the second episode a college history professor (married, 2 children) is sleeping with one of his students, Alison. He is a stickler for being on time to his class and not missing it. As it turns out Alison is ""late"" and is pregnant with his child. She comes to class with a gun, points it to her head, and she doesn't ""miss."" The interesting part is the expected haunting. As expected it starts out slow and takes some twists. Perhaps the best of the three.

The third episode is more akin to the Creepshow variety. A security guard steals Mars dust from NASA to cure his terminal wife of cancer. She becomes a human sexual dynamo (nudity). Unfortunately the effects wear off and the guard must get more.

The plots weren't overly exciting. Romero uses his special gore/make-up effects as a substitute for a good story. If you keep your expectations low, you won't be disappointed.",1316822400,5,1314,4.559322033898305
