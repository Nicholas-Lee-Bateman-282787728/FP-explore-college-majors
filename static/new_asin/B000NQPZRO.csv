8181146,4,B000NQPZRO,"I didn't realize how short these stories are, ten minutes or so.  So, that was a bit disappointing, but my fault as I did not read the fine print.",1359763200,,146,4.0344827586206895
8181147,2,B000NQPZRO,"The animation of these videos are okay. A bit confusing and muddled at times, and the stories are only very barely based on any actual events in the artists' lives. I'm an art teacher at a public school and bought this to show my students, but I can't because the real message underneath these stories is religion. Monet's garden is saved by a mysterious boy who turns out to be Jesus who invites him to paint in the Gardens of Paradise. Van Gogh tells the little girl he doesn't mind his pain because it will go away when he gets to Heaven. It's subtly done, but still obvious enough that I'm not comfortable showing these movies in school. The artistic license about the artists' lives is one thing, but the secret religious morality lessons is another.",1277078400,12,755,4.5588235294117645

Who could ask for more!?  Both of these animations of beautiful imagery are replicated from the artists' impressionist and post-impressionist styles!  It is a child's dream come true of watching a painting come to life! ""Painted Tales: Vol 1"" is perfect to introduce your children to two of our most famous and influential painters, Van Gogh and Monet.",1257379200,5,767,8.807692307692308
