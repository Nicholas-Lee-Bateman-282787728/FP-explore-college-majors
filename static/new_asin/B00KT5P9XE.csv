The soundtrack alternates from decent symphonic to distracting synthesizer--these excellent images deserve better! Plus the soundtrack is in notably poor condition compared to the film itself, another disappointment, as the final credits roll in silence. Still, recommended!",1445904000,,339,6.083333333333333
8661254,4,B00KT5P9XE,"Here we finally have a decent transfer of Director Augusto Caminito's 'PRINCE OF THE NIGHT' aka 'NOSFERATU IN VENICE' aka 'VAMPIRE IN VENICE- 1988.  Available over the years in foggy ,scratchy bootleg copies in both VHS and DVD, One 7 Movies finally shows the film in its original 1.85 transfer where the cinematography by Tonino Nardi can be fully appreciated.  Unfairly trounced over the years by critics, the film emerges as an ethereal take on vampire love over the ages.  The film had a very troubled shoot with a very disgruntled actor who basically wanted perfection.  Actor Klaus Kinski had the original Director Maurizio Lucidi tossed off the set and started directing some scenes himself with Caminito arriving and refining the script .  Some sources list Director Luigi Cozzi as completing some sequences.  As the other reviews have stated, this film has nothing to do with Director Werner Herzog's 'NOSFERATU THE VAMPIRE' aka 'NOSFERATU,PHANTOM DER NACHT'-1979 and if you approach it this way, you'll appreciate it even more.  When an heiress played by Barbara De Rossi summons a Van Helsing like professor played somberly by Christopher Plummer to investigate her mansions haunted past , things start getting worse after a seance when the 200 year old vampire is summoned  on the eve of Carnival time in Venice. For the modern day Horror fan , Beware!  This is not a fast paced exercise that you're used to.  The film relies on the visual aspects and does not give the viewer easy answers to the set pieces which will cause frustration to some.  The power of the film lies in its subtlety. The film has a cameo by actor Donald Pleasence as the holier than thou pastor of the mansion who's presence is castrated by the power of the Vampire.  It is Kinski's show all the way as he overpowers every frame of the film and makes it the underrated nightmare that it is.  The film's only flaw is a hodge podge keyboard symphonic score by Luigi Ceccarelli and pop composer Vangelis which does not fit the film at all.  One 7 Movies has both the Italian and English dubbed versions and a photo gallery its only extra.  Recommended to serious Vampire film and Euro Horror  fans, it deserves to have a better reputation and kudos to One 7 Movies for releasing this nice transfer for American audiences.",1441497600,,2304,4.78030303030303
8661255,3,B00KT5P9XE,"NOSFERATU IN VENICE (aka: VAMPIRE IN VENICE, aka: PRINCE OF THE NIGHT) concerns vampire expert, Professor Paris Catalano (Christopher Plummer- THE PYX) and his quest to find the infamous, fang-y blood-drinker of the title (Klaus Kinski- VENOM, CRAWLSPACE, CREATURE). When he discovers a strange family in Venice, originally from Transylvania, he believes he's hit the jackpot. This leads to the back-story being told, while Don Alvise (Donald Pleasence- HALLOWEEN 1 and 2) looks on, grimly. Soon, a medium is called in, resulting in a seance, and the return of the ""High Priest Of Putridity"". Death and doom ensue. Kinski is quite convincing and very threatening in his undead role. His interesting facial features have always made him a stand-out villain. He pulls off pure eeevil w/ ease. Plummer is stolidly heroic as the Von Helsing-esque Catalano. Unfortunately, Pleasence is mostly wasted. Still, a fairly decent movie overall, though it does drag on interminably in spots...",1429401600,,981,5.335483870967742
8661256,3,B00KT5P9XE,"3 1/2 STARS FOR A STYLIZED VAMPIRE TALE ORIGINALLY CALLED ""NOSFERATU IN VENICE"" WITH AN OBSCURE PRODUCTION PAST

This unofficial (read unsanctioned) sequel to Herzog's Nosferatu was released in 1988, but kind of has that late 1970's weekend horror theater feel that is probably one of it's saving graces.  Occasional odd synthesizer music gives the movie away as an 80's entry.  The direction is a bit of a mystery with numerous names attached (that definitely DO NOT include Herzog!) and even Kinsky himself may have tried to direct it at some point.  There are lots of stylized scenes of Kinsky haunting Venice's foggy cobblestone wharfs in glowing street lamps or traveling the narrow canals.  All this adds a great deal of atmosphere.

THE STORY: Set in modern Venice, beautiful Helietta Canins (Barbara de Rossi) and her mother invite Professor Catalano (Christopher Plummer) to their Venetian Palazzo to help dispel rumors surrounding their house and family regarding the famous vampire Nosferatu.  Legend tells that the vampire abducted Helietta's grandmother.  Professor Catalano is a sort of Van Helsing character to Kinski's vampire.  Unfortunately, Catalano finds more truth than legend in the tales and identifies a mysterious coffin in the catacombs under the house as the crypt of a vampire.  Meanwhile, a new string of murders has plagued Venice.  Helietta is also being drawn into the clutch of the returned Nosferatu along with others.  Though the tale is formulaic, it does not always follow the expected patterns.  It is a race to thwart Nosferatu before he captures his objects of interest.

Kinski is a decidedly more human looking Nosferatu in this movie with pinker skin and a somewhat odd kabuki looking silver wig for hair.  You will recall he was pasty white and bald in the first movie.  A lot of time is consumed showing him wandering Venice and he speaks in just a few instances.  Otherwise he pretty much grimaces his way through while occasionally having awkward sex with impossibly beautiful women.  The strong atmosphere and a few actors are really what save this show.  There is always that terrific old time horror theater feel.  Even when Christopher Plummer is dialing it in, he still adds substance to this movie and is one of the elements tying the film to the atmosphere I mentioned.  Barbara de Rossi and another young woman of interest to the vampire are quite frankly stunning, and one of the other reasons people will watch this film.

Video and audio quality are passible with the audio taking the biggest hit to my ears.  It had some jumbled background at times.  This version is unrated and has full frontal nudity that would have been a bigger deal for an 80's flick.  The main track is English with the original Italian available.  There are no subtitles with the Italian track.  The DVD case is marked all region 0, so it should work on more than just U.S. players (provided you don't get a country specific version from a secondary seller).  I recommend the movie if you are really into the genre and can rent or buy very cheep.",1416182400,2,3079,4.891891891891892
