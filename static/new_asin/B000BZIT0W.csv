2450033,2,B000BZIT0W,"I just watched Strawberry Shortcake dvd World of Friends and what I throught of the cartoon was so-so !
I grew up watching Strawberry Shortcake cartoon as a little girl in the 1980 ! I know this cartoon is very suitable for little girls at any age !
The dvd contains : Strawberry Shortcake commerical and games , A specail of the friendship club on dvd !",1190678400,,354,4.298507462686567
2450034,4,B000BZIT0W,We love Strawberry Shortcake in this house and this movie doesn't fall short of our expectations.  Strawberry and friends go around the world to meet new people from other countries.  Very cute.,1168473600,,194,5.03125
2450035,4,B000BZIT0W,"I just wasn't as crazy with this DVD as with some of the others.  And, unfortunately, my daughter agreed.  She has every SS movie released (although she hasn't received 3 of them as we are holding them for Christmas) and this one just didn't keep her attention as much as the others.  Perhaps b/c in this movie the ""regular"" friends (Orange Blossom, Ginger Snap, Angel Cake and Huck) do not play as big of a part as in the other movies.  This can be a big deal to a 2-5 yr. old toddler who likes things to be the way they are ""supposed"" to be.  And my daughter is very much like that.  She likes the ""regular"" friends and I think she missed them a bit in this movie.  Perhaps if they were featured a bit more she would have taken to it quicker.

She eventually warmed up to this one, but it took several times of playing it before she got used to the new characters and started to like them.  Even now, she will ask to watch others over this one.

This DVD highlights making friends with those who are different from yourself (from different places, those who like different things than you do).  A lesson I feel is is an important one to convey.  But when I watched this with my daughter for the first time, I kind of felt that the movie was one big advertisement for the SS Friendship Club.  Maybe not, but I know there is a freindship club online and there is a line of SS merchandise geared towards this premise.  It just didn't sit right with me.

I like the others better, but I still gave this 4 stars b/c the storyline was cute, the lesson is valuable and although it is not her favorite, my daughter still enjoys it.  And that's what really counts :)",1159660800,2,1659,4.235668789808917
2450036,3,B000BZIT0W,"Perhaps my expectations were unreasonable, but I bought this to introduce my daughter to some other cultures in preparation for a trip around the world, and was very disappointed.  It is extremely ""cute,"" and the characters are very ""hip,"" there is some interesting content on dealing with conflict in groups of friends, and my daughter did sit enraptured through the whole thing.  All in all, if you're looking for pure entertainment, it's a fun piece, but there's little educational value.",1153872000,,491,5.125
2450037,4,B000BZIT0W,"Kept the attention of my 19 month old and me! Messages about friendship, working together, being honest, being aware of differences but to not let that stop you from being a friend. Cute DVD, will probably buy more SS DVDs",1146873600,,222,4.575
2450038,5,B000BZIT0W,"My kids love it, although I'm getting a little tired of watching it over and over again.  Great DVD for a 2-4 year old.",1142467200,,119,3.9583333333333335
2450039,4,B000BZIT0W,It's a cute movie about making friends even if they are different.,1142208000,,66,4.583333333333333
2450040,4,B000BZIT0W,"We bought this DVD for our almost 29 month old granddaughter. I feel that it is just not as good as some of the other SS episodes. This 44 minute DVD has 2 episodes both pertaining to friendship. There are 4 new characters introduced. Their names are Crepes Suzette,Tea Blossom,Frosty Puff and Tangerina Torta. Only Crepes Suzette and Tea Blossom are featured. Brief glimpses of the other two are shown. However,Kiersten likes this DVD alot so if you have a child who likes Strawberry,they will probably like it.",1139875200,3,512,4.829545454545454
8094793,5,B000BZIT0W,Make ing referring to a episode on this product here even when the episode was on television strawberry shortcake pet cat kitten custard said Crepes suzette  is okay I guess but I am not sure about that dog of her was a insalt to Crepes suzette poodle Eclaire because Crepes suzette said out loud enough that her Eclaire was a poodle now I had a great experience with this product here,1485648000,,385,4.422535211267606
8094794,5,B000BZIT0W,Loved it...,1457049600,,11,5.0
8094795,5,B000BZIT0W,"Yes, everything was fine",1406592000,,24,5.25
8094796,5,B000BZIT0W,I gave the rating that I did because of the smile on my kid's face and the speed in which it took to arrive.  Based on that I would recommend it to others.,1400630400,,155,3.696969696969697
8094797,5,B000BZIT0W,"The Frank Capra-esque stylings of the camera work, put together with the visionary production, which I can only assume was the work of the great George Lucas, makes this, dare I say, the greatest piece of film of our generation. With the subtle nuisances, reminiscent of the early era of film, the cinematography alone creates a genius work. Add to that, the acting of the greatest actors in the business today, this movie goes from genius, to masterpiece... Oh wait, nevermind... IT'S STRAWBERRY-FU##ING-SHORTCAKE. It keeps my 4 year old from making me go out in the hot Arkansas summer for an hour.",1307923200,,600,4.892156862745098
8094798,4,B000BZIT0W,"My three year old loves this show, but we enjoyed ""Spring for Strawberry Shortcake"" and ""Meet Strawberry Shortcake"" a little bit more.  If your child is a fan, you should probably buy it for their collection, but I would try the other ones I mentioned first.",1274400000,,258,4.608695652173913
8094799,4,B000BZIT0W,"""World of Friends"" explores other parts of the world where SS makes new friends, namely Crepe Suzette and Tea Blossom [there are also others like Tangerina Torte but they don't get much screen time]. In ""A Trip to Pearis, France"", SS becomes good friends with Crepe Suzette and her poodle Eclaire. Both SS and CS cooperate to look for Pupcake and Eclaire when the two pets gets lost. In ""The Great Friendship Festival"", Angel Cake learns a valuable lesson, i.e. that she needs to ask for assistance when she needs it. SS makes a great new friend named Tea Blossom with an adorable pet panda [guess where she's from:)]. The pair learn the valuable lesson that friends do not have to have similar interests or like the same things.

All in all, another great edition of SS, but my preschooler missed SS's other good friends, the familiar characters that she has seen in other DVDs and missed having them in this instalment. But, it was a good introduction to new and interesting characters!",1252195200,,988,4.710982658959537
8094800,4,B000BZIT0W,My 3 year old daughter loves this DVD ... and so do I. It's really cute and sweet.,1215993600,,82,3.611111111111111
8094801,4,B000BZIT0W,"We got this for our 3 yr. old this Christmas. She loves it and wants to see it almost everyday. It's friendly and happy. No violence, no inappropriate words that I hear sometimes in many of todays, ""children,"" shows. I recommend it for any girl 2 to 12 yrs. old.",1199750400,,262,4.26
8094802,5,B000BZIT0W,"Honestly, we love World of Friends.  I find it a lot less annoying than many of the other SS DVDs we have--the song is very cute and my daughter loves this movie about friendship.  I don't know why you wouldn't consider this educational--at least it teaches values, which is something a lot of the junk on TV doesn't do.  And kids have to have fun sometimes too anyway--lighten up.",1196035200,,381,4.492753623188406
