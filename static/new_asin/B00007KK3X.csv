1818391,4,B00007KK3X,"This is a movie about working class Brits who speak such cockney I had to view with subtitles in order not to miss the mumbling dialogue.  It was worth the time, because it had a very unusual feel.  It was very slice of life, as I am told most of Leigh's films are.
A London cab driver and his supermarket clerk wife raise two fat kids.  The daughter works in an old folks home, the son refuses to do anything but watch TV and eat.  The parents are numb.  The cabbie is depressed and hardly says anything as the son sasses the mother.  Other characters include a girl that is pregnant by a violent boyfriend, her mother who had a similar experience, the neighborhood slut that goes after the violent boyfriend next, and her alcoholic parents.  Nobody knows who they are or what they want.  Finally, the young boy winds up in the hospital with a heart attack and that sort-of brings the family together.
You could call most of the film downbeat.  After much worry and tragedy, the film ends on a higher note than it starts, but you don't really feel that their lives have improved.  Even though there is a lot of negative emotion, the movie is still compelling like a train wreck.  On the strength of this, I would watch any Mike Leigh movie that comes out on DVD.",1050796800,3,1263,4.377682403433476
1818392,4,B00007KK3X,"Mitch Leigh is a filmmaker to watch.  He can explode a screen like Baz Luhrman with color and music as in TOPSY TURVY, explore delicate regions of human behavior as in SECRETS AND LIES and can still retain the ability to seek out the slender thread of simply living day to day as is ALL OR NOTHING. For a two hour plus film, Leigh is able to hold our attention like a biologist with a microscope while he slowly follows the impossibly boring vacuum of life that his characters live in this wan, bleak look at life in the working class Brits.  Everyone seems alienated from relating to people except on the most raw basis of despair and struggle. The family of focus is four sad creatures with utterly no future until a sudden disruption in their meaningless lives turns on the light of recognition that hppiness occurs only if you find/make it yourself.
Leigh has a cast of favorites he continues to use because they are such very fine actors.  Timothy Spall finds all the accepted despair and acceptance of a world gone sour in the character of a cab driver who lacks the esteem to support himself in the face of clients who can't pay and a family who can't function beyond minimal requirements of being alive.  Lesley Manville as his beleagured wife has internalized any hope that the world in which she is drowning can be any better. Their obese kids are incredibly well defined by James Corden and Alison Garland, and their co-tennants/mates in one of the most depressing housing projects every photographed are cast to a fare-thee-well as families who hold onto life by their own fingernails.
There is a degree of psychological salvation offered at the end of the story which, given the arid desert of lives the characters inhabit, springs like a brief mirage of a transitory oasis.  This is not a light movie and it does require a lot from an audience to persevere.  But then Mitch Leigh is an honest observor and whether we like the slice of life he exposes or not, he does make us look inward to re-evaluate our own priorities. And that is certainly one criterion for films that remain meaningful past the initial viewing.",1046476800,7,2130,4.621693121693122

1818401,1,B00007KK3X,Really.  I tried to watch it.  I don't think I made it past the 10 minute mark. Boring British characters moping about.  Unintelligible and/or unintelligent dialog.  Skip it....

We all live one day at a time and no one really rich or poor do we know what goes on within the home of those we meet along the way. This is a lovely look into a story of nothing but I loved the way the writer made nothing into a study of the human condition with all it's good - bad etc.

1818404,2,B00007KK3X,"The production values were not bad but the movie itself was painted in gigantic swishes of deep dark despair and existential angst. I personally enjoy movies that nurture hope and find some kind of value in living. These characters were either hopelessly despondent or unremittingly bad with no way out.

1818405,5,B00007KK3X,"Mike Leigh is one of the few remaining masters of neo-realism, in the old Italian style of Open City, La Terra Trema, and The Bicycle Thief. He takes working class culture as his subject and looks it square in the face, allowing us to put aside conventional judgments and discover the humanity in seemingly grotesque situations. There is a deeply positive feeling in his depictions of these British housing project residents who cope with their quotidian problems in characteristic ways, but there is no sentimentality at the bottom, only appreciation for their capacity to change and grow.",1365811200,2,590,5.092783505154639

1818410,5,B00007KK3X,The movie does a good job of bringing you into their life and understanding the feelings from each persons perspective.

1818411,5,B00007KK3X,"Brutally honest film about life and times for those living on the fringes at the lower levels of society in the UK. A serious film, nonetheless there are moments of ironical humor in it. A great Timothy Spall flick.",1361491200,,215,4.538461538461538
1818412,5,B00007KK3X,"Grim, at times depressing and even harrowing, this study of working class lives in the poorest part of London, nevertheless reveals that even in the midst of depression and despair there beats at the heart of the human soul something inextinguishable. Part Ingmar berman, part Dostoevesky this film also contains two of the most searing performnces in cinema, Timothy Spall and Lesley Manville. A few lighter moments.",1346716800,2,417,5.2388059701492535
1818433,4,B00007KK3X,"This is a film about broken people, without skills, without options, without any apparent talent.  They live in a London tenement that is exceedingly depressing with idle youths milling around and drunks with no hope.  The main characters are a family with 2 obese children, one a shy girl who is a cleaner in an old folks home, and the son an enraged unemployed layabout.  Unlike the wife and son,  the obsequious father and inhibited daughter try to keep things together more out of toleration than trying to address the issues that the family faces.  The mother blames her partner for the dismal state of their life, taking him for granted and despising rather than loving him as she once did.  The neighbors are a sorry lot, one an alcoholic couple whose pretty daughter has no prospects and the other a single mother whose daughter is pregnant,  about to repeat the basic family pattern.  They do not have the tools to grow much, they lack education and skills, and with the declining economy they cannot rise above their circumstances.  It is truly depressing and not at all funny.  As they blunder ahead, a crisis forces them to look at themselves.  The result is moving and believable, however much it means that the real work is still ahead.

There are lots of indie films like this.  I think what makes this exceptional is the acting, starting with Timothy Spall, one of the greatest actors working today.  But the others, whom I had never seen before, are equally convincing.

Recommended.  This is better than most in the genre.",1304640000,2,1540,4.7330827067669174
1818434,3,B00007KK3X,"Everything about this movie is depressing of the lowest order.  The background is set in a housing project of three main families.  Timothy Spall's character is a taxi driver whilst his partner is a counter lady for Safeway.  Both of them have a dejected daughter who works as a cleaner in a retirement home whose work colleague is a lonely & sad old man who suggests to go out with her, a lazy & obese son who only cares to eat, watch TV & fighting with other children whole day long.  Timothy is an disillusioned taxi driver who himself is less than motivated to work long hours.  One of their neighbours happen to be Timothy's character's colleague whose wife is an alcoholic & a horny daughter.  Another neighbour happens to be a cheery mother whose angry daughter has to come to terms with pregnancy.  A tragedy would befallen one of them and aid would come from the least expected source.  All of caricatures here are too busy minding their day to day life that they lack the perspective of cherishing what truly matters in their lives.  An honest, gritty and well-made movie with superb casting.  Commendable watching.",1184976000,6,1125,4.66497461928934
1818435,4,B00007KK3X,"Many of have complained about the sheer, utter, inescapable bleakness of ALL OF NOTHING's working-class world, but there is no denying the emotional force of the pitch-perfect performances here.  I wish American films took the time to stop, look, and listen, patiently observing real life as it carefully unfolds.  I defy anyone not to cry at the film's climax, as the culminative effect is devastating.  I don't know of any other director who is so good at drawing rich, detailed, nuanced performances from all of his actors - this time including Leigh regulars RUTH SHEEN, TIMOTHY SPALL, etc.  This is truly ""ensemble"" acting at its best!  Another Mike Leigh winner - not as good as SECRETS & LIES or LIFE IS SWEET, but certainly among his best.",1125187200,3,747,4.850393700787402
1818436,4,B00007KK3X,"Like many films from Leigh, you probably don't want to watch if you're feeling down.  It's not a light film or an uplifting one.  But, I thought it was very well done and acted and believable.  Is it an accurage reflection of working-class life in the UK?  I don't know.  But, it's worth watching as a well-done film.",1115164800,2,317,4.396551724137931
1818437,5,B00007KK3X,"It is hard to think of another more consistently powerful film director than England's Mike Leigh and ""All or Nothing"" is yet another example of his exemplary work.

Many here have used the word ""depressing"" to describe this movie and, if you don't look very far from the surface, that is understandable.  Look a little deeper and you see redemption at play in the lives of these characters whose lives seem stuck in permanent reverse.

""All or Nothing"" features some mainstays of Mike Leigh films in its cast, including Timothy Spall (""Secrets and Lies,"" ""Life is Sweet"") Lesley Manville (""Secrets and Lies,"" ""High Hopes"") and Ruth Sheen (""High Hopes"") and each are superb here.",1112313600,3,679,4.93859649122807
1818438,2,B00007KK3X,"I think that Mr. Leigh is a truly good director. His work is honest, not common in cinema show.
But, ""All or Nothing"" is really depress movie. From the begginning to the end. All is full of problems. It's like a clich: poor people, weak people, unsmart people, unhappy people, unsane people, violent people, fat people, ugly people.
C'mon Mr. Leigh: life's not too good, but on the other hand, it's not too bad. Please put your great gift in the other side of life and you give us a smile You can do this",1076716800,3,504,4.315789473684211
1818439,4,B00007KK3X,"Just like all of Leigh's films, you commit to them and want to own them.  This one however, has no real comic relief and frankly I couldn't shake the mild depression I developed while watching.  Be careful, this a great movie but a real downer.",1076371200,5,244,4.4
1818440,4,B00007KK3X,"'All or Nothing' is a fascinating but disturbing portrayal of the lives of struggling working class people in a London tenement. It is a very thought provoking film and may lead to reflecting on your own life and on life in general. As with Mike Leigh's other films this is not very upbeat stuff, in fact this movie is probably more of a downer than the usual from him. The superbly acted characters are real hard luck cases and their lives seem utterly hopeless, so much so that I was expecting someone commit suicide at any moment. But at the same time their story is gripping and so realistic that you feel like a voyeur looking in on them. The ending while not exactly a happy ending provides a slight glimmer of hope but in keeping with the reality of the movie is not overly optimistic. If you like Leigh's other films you will not be disappointed by this one.",1074729600,19,866,4.41875
1818441,4,B00007KK3X,"After hearing the director's commentary (sadly available only on the British DVD release, it seems), I appreciated Mike Leigh in a new way. He is, at heart, a simple storyteller who delights in letting us see real human beings in real situations, inviting us along on the journey as their lives and characters are shaped. As expected, we meet a number of struggling (and uniformly depressed) characters, all of whom have hidden depths which are revealed as the central events of the film transpire. Leigh elicits believable and affecting performances all round. Admittedly, this is even bleaker than Secrets and Lies, although there is an undercurrent of redemption as the tensions begin to resolve. As usual, this vintage Leigh offering is compelling stuff.",1051660800,5,758,5.170731707317073

7977653,5,B00007KK3X,"As the title of my review states, this bleak look at a terribly dysfunctional and unhappy British family in Northern England is strangely compelling. Like an awful car wreck, one finds it difficult to look away. And yet the movie itself is no car wreck! It is a finely crafted tale, though simple in its construction, and the acting is top notch, if a bit morose at times. It reminded me of the Kitchen Sink movies of the '50 and '60s. Made in the same part of England if I'm not mistaken. The Naturalistic Film movement, showing the lives of the poorer set of the British Isles. Movies like Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner, and my favorite of the genre Kes. Of course these types of films aren't for everybody. You have to be a patient and attentive cinephile to appreciate this kind of drama. No mucking about with your cell phone or Kindle while watching the movie! Pay attention or you'll likely miss the point of the film. Those who do will find themselves achieving a sort of cinematic Zen. An understanding that movies can be so much more than explosions.",1422316800,,1104,4.58080808080808
7977654,5,B00007KK3X,"I wanted to give this movie five stars for the admittedly reactionary purpose of raising its average rating. This is a 4-to-4.5-star movie, not a 3.5 star movie.

I think that a huge thing that a lot of raters fail to understand is that this film (along with Mike Leigh's other work), is fairly comedic. Yes, the characters in this film are whiny, their lives are completely miserable, and in a fairly hackneyed way. Nonetheless, it is a very good film, but perhaps only if you know how to laugh at it.

The problem is that most viewers (perhaps especially in the U.S.) are not accustomed to laughing at the sort of things depicted in this movie. We're so full of guilt and shame at the a priori cruelty of our lifestyle that we cannot any longer laugh at the cruelty of fate itself. To some extent, all of Leigh's films take a similar angle, i.e., we are forced to watch various fates play out in ways that they never ""should"" have. In this sense, they are ""tragicomedies"" in the fullest meaning of the term.

Here, we watch loving and enlightened mothers being manipulated by emotionally-stunted daughters, we see a misplaced poet malfunction as a proletarian father, a family of profoundly unhappy people consume itself and more. But, all things considered, the most troubling, but perhaps also the most hilarious element in this film, along with Leigh's other work, is the presence of peripheral characters who are never ""explained"" or justified. Such characters in Leigh's films are not quite ""props"" for the ""main story"", but neither are they supposed to play an ""important"" part, they show up as simply ""problematic"". These are the apathetically hopeless people that we encounter all the time, and (disturbingly), we often become ourselves in the course of our oft-meaningless lives. As Martin Heidegger would remind us, proximally and for the most part, we live in the background of things. That's a hard, but important thing to accept.

If you feel like you're being forced to cry while watching this film, try laughing at it. You just might ""get"" it. And no, I'm not encouraging you, dear reader, to be a cold, heartless shell of a person, I'm rather encouraging you to see this movie as an opportunity to learn how to unconditionally love fate (""amor fati""), no matter what turns it may take.",1418860800,4,2303,4.778894472361809
