7921117,5,B00004RFG6,"Yui pauses at the brink of summoning the god Seiryu, suddenly aware that she may get more than she bargained for.  Her subsequent decisions and their dramatic effects have decisive consequences -- both individually and  corporately -- for the Suzaku and Seiryu Seven, as well as their respective  nations.  Action-packed, with twists and turns (OK, Miaka makes some  bonehead moves, we all knew those were coming) and some surprising  developments.  ""Those episodes were too short!"" said my wife, and  she was right -- we're looking forward eagerly to the next volume.",958348800,3,568,5.164835164835165
