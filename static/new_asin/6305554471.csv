All in all, I figure it's still better to watch a so-so Sci Fi/Horror movie than ""Dances With Wolves"" or ""Evita"".  This movie will end up being non-memorable, but it's preferable to being in a coma.",1127001600,,380,4.463768115942029

My dad was a radio announcer for many years, and went into video/commercials etc. near his retirement. This was his most prominent role, and it was fun to see his 15 minutes of fame. I also helped him rehearse his lines in our living room. So bad it is good!",1107388800,7,535,4.36

The laughs are few and far between, the acting is horrendous (even for an independent film), and there are only about 5 minutes in the whole 82 minute movie that contain actual TV Terrorism !
The story is about this teenage guy who's mother forces him to move to New York to work for his Dad. His girl comes along and they get a spot in the company so low that ""we made it up last night"". They get a horribly cruel boss, and a very poor-quality apartment.
One day, the teenage guy starts selling used parts he finds in the basement in the company to make money. The supervisor sees this and threatens to send him to jail if he doesn't give her 70% of the profit.
So he gives in and theres all this crap about ""white glove terrorism"" all leading up to a remarkibly boring ""hostile takeover"" of a TV station.
To be honest, I bought this movie for two reasons. 1) I am a hardcore Troma fan to the soul and 2) The producer Susan Kaufman is the sister of two of my all time favorite directors: Lloyd Kaufman and Charles Kaufman. Givin this was a no-budgit independent movie, there is next to nothing good about this movie.
The only things that are decent about this movie are 1)The Title (which was originally Amatuer Hour) and 2) The previews beforehand (Terror Firmer, Stendahl Syndrome, and Toxie 4). No gore, no sex, are you sure this is Troma ? My best advice: skip this.",976406400,2,1495,4.3428571428571425
