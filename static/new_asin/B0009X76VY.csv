I discovered A Miss Mallard Mystery online, and my 3- and 5-year-old daughters couldn't get enough of watching the episodes.  I've recently replaced this 2-disk set and my children were overjoyed.  The children are 5 and 7 years old now and still enjoy watching the series.

The plot is easy to follow, but interesting enough to entertain adults as well.  We all love a good mystery!  The comedy appeals to our collective sense of humor.  It's fun to pause between scenes to discuss clues and let the children guess the outcome.  Many characters are named after species of ducks; my husband and I enjoy researching the different ducks with our children after we watch an episode.

We plan to purchase the books by Robert Quackenbush from the Miss Mallard Mystery series.",1294790400,,952,5.742857142857143

8069014,5,B0009X76VY,I'm so glad I ran across Miss Mallard on Netflix Watch Now.  My 6 year old daughter loves mysteries and Miss Mallard is the perfect show for the future Agatha Christie fan.  The shows are all homages to classic mysteries and is quite wonderfully done- great quality.  I can't recommend this enough!,1223596800,,298,4.6923076923076925
8069015,5,B0009X76VY,"Miss Mallard Rides to the Rescue DVD contains six fun and intriguing mysteries for young minds.  For any fans of the Miss Mallard books, these episodes do not disappoint.  My son (age 5) and I have enjoyed watching them.  I love the music, which reminds me a bit of the theme from the PBS Mystery Theatre.  I also enjoy the subtle references to Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, though they might be apparent only to die hard mystery fans who have read the Miss Mallard books and Agatha Christie.

The stories included in this DVD set are Taxi to Intrigue, Cable Car to Catastrophe, Express Train to Trouble, Whistle Stop to Fear, Footbridge to Jitters, and Snowmobile to Panic.  For those who have read the stories, know that the DVD versions have been slightly changed to be lengthy enough for about a 23 minute show each.  I think they did a great job.  Also, all the shows can be watched in either English, French, or Spanish (dubbed, not subtitled).  We love Miss Mallard and wish they would make more shows.  We look forward to getting the other DVD set called Miss Mallard Meets the Masters of Mischief.  We hope you enjoy the famous ducktective as much as we do!",1200700800,7,1167,4.5625
