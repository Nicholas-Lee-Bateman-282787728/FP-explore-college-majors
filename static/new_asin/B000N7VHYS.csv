And since he died several years ago, I can watch the movie and remember the friendship we had before his sudden death.",1358467200,,254,4.291666666666667
8175502,5,B000N7VHYS,"Before William Lustig brought the world the classic Maniac in 1980 there were others filmmakers testing the same formula. One of these films was 1979's Delirium, an interesting and obscure slasher film that really does deserve a nice dvd release.
The plot is rather original and refreshing for it's time. A man is hired by a group of right winged nuts to clean up all the scum on the streets (killers, rapists etc) but the same man was also in the Vietnam war and has terrible flashbacks. Soon enough he goes on a killing rampage and nobody is safe, guilty or innocent.
Despite my plot desciption the film isn't a full blown slasher film at all. Sure it has it's stalk and kill sequences much more akin to Maniac and Don't Answer The Phone then Halloween but Delirium is just as much a cop thriller as it is a slasher. A solid 60 percent of the running time features our leading officers trying to figure out exactly who's the killer and who's the cause of all these criminals being found dead. We as the audience know all the answers and watching them trying to catch on is fun as it really does seem the officers don't have much collective brain power to solve any crime.
Thankfully the officers do have some help! And it comes in the shape of a pretty blonde secretary. Working for one of the men involved in this organization she wanders around the film quite like Daphne from Scooby Doo finding clues and getting into trouble along the way. As you can guess she is soon enough a target of the organazation for just knowing too much.
Delirium was also an infamous video nasty in the early 80's but to be honest there isn't a whole lot of gore in this one. Sure there is a whole lot of violence packed in but none of it is overly bloody really. And it's all pretty tame nowadays.

Delirium really doesn't deserve to be as obscure as it is. I found myself quite involved in the plot and was surprised to see it was also fairly original.
Sure the acting wasn't flawless nor was anything about it but I enjoyed it so much that I can easily overlook these flaws.
Give it watch if you can find a copy :)",1336953600,,2101,4.35969387755102
