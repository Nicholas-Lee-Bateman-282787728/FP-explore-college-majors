8421103,4,B004AXJA2W,"Following in the footsteps of the popular ""Emmanuelle"" franchise (PARTICULARLY ""Emanuelle Around the World AKA 'The Degredation of Emanuelle"") - the Swedish production of ""Around the World With Fanny Hill"" (Jorden Runt Med Fanny Hill"") follows a similar globe trotting scenario, but has a markedly different (lighter) tone to its' plot-line.

Updating the venerable pleasure seeking heroine 'Fanny Hill' to 'modern' 1970's times the film begins in Sweden where Fanny (played by the gorgeous blond Shirley Corrigan) is having a hard time in her marriage with her husband's philandering ways - he produces commercials and is constantly surrounded by beautiful models - not the least of which is the lovely Swedish sexpot, Christina Lindberg. Fanny orchestrates an act of infidelity for her hubby and uses that as an excuse to file for divorce and head off (accompanied by her best GF - played by Gaby Fuchs) to Hollywood. Once in tinsel-town Fanny is 'discovered' by an adult film production company and is hired to star in their next film - which gives the rational, via a series of 'location shoots', for the fun loving duo to travel to several picturesque cities around the world - including Hong Kong, Venice, & Munich.  Hot on her trail, however, is her 'husband' who is hoping for a reconciliation, and many sexy & comedic adventures ensue.

As previously noted - the general tone of this movie is light-hearted - even in some of the steamy sex scenes - and it moves right along mixing equal doses of 'travelogue' and soft core adult fare. The principal female leads are very attractive and display a lot of flesh throughout (tho the over-all vibe is decidedly soft core) - BUT - there are a few bits of actual XXX action in some of the 'orgy' sequences - for those with really sharp eyes to detect!  A bit misleading is the prominent promotion of Christina Lindberg - she appears in only a couple of scenes as one of the 'models' that Fanny's husband is photographing - these ARE nude scenes, but her total screen time is only about 60 seconds!

The version of the film that I was able to purchase (and review) is the Swedish release: ""Jorden Runt Med F.H."".  This disk offers an excellent quality widescreen image and English language option.  The 'extras' on the disk contain some major extra sex action.  The film 'feature' sorta 'climaxes' w/ a big orgy sequence in Munich - but - the extras section offers 'deleted scenes' comprised of 3 additional lengthy orgy sequences! AND there is XXX action contained there-in! One must assume that the 'cuts' were made for either 'rating' or 'timing' purposes -  as they present almost an additional 15 minutes of wall to wall skin. There's also a generous helping of 'trailers' included for other adult Swedish features... some of which look pretty crazed!

I found this flik to be very enjoyable - with an engaging cast - good production values - lotsa skin - and even a few chuckles - as Fanny hops from bed to bed on her way around the globe. Good wholesome sexy fun -  Highly recommended for adult viewing - by both sexes.",1377820800,3,3077,4.765037593984962
8421104,4,B004AXJA2W,"This DVD quality looks good on my HDTV considering the age of the film. The sound is okay as well. Be warned: I was unable to get the disk to play in my Samsung Blu-Ray player or in my Magnavox DVD player. My computer, running Windows 7, plays the disk without issue.

There's lots of skin in this flick, and the story is tongue and cheek. I enjoyed watching the movie.",1366416000,2,369,4.197183098591549
