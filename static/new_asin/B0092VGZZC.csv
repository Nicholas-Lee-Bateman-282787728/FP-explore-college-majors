8534904,5,B0092VGZZC,"It's always a delight to ""discover"" young, talented, beautiful actors and this production introduced me to many, primarily Yoon Si-yoon.  This role was a gift to him so that he could show his range, and he didn't disappoint. You will want to see more of his work.  He was supported by many established actors the viewer will easily recognize.  At times, this DVD is difficult to watch because of the constant hardships and obstacles the character must face, but it leaves the viewer with the hope that good people do come out on top and there is some justice in life.  As to the DVD, the quality is good and sub-titles are adequate and not distracting.",1362528000,,652,4.594827586206897
