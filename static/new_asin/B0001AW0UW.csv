1985876,5,B0001AW0UW,"Eighteen, 19, 20 years ago, I first saw this film.  I loved it, my teenaged kids loved it.  I had no idea Sam Shepard had written the play, or even that there was a play, though it seems obvious now.  We watched this over and over.  I still play the sound track, sung, I found out somewhere recently, by Sam's sister, Sandy Rogers--talk about alternative country!  I still watch this film from time to time.  It's enchanting, it's funny, it's mysterious, and there's that kick-ass soundtrack.  It never gets old for me.",1118448000,16,519,4.576086956521739
1985877,2,B0001AW0UW,"This is Sam Sheppard's (he wrote and stars in it) incestuous love story, told at a fever pitch. Eddie (Sheppard) and May (Kim Basinger) have been lovers since high school; only later do they find out they have the same father. Their relationship becomes one of frustration and rage as they dance around each other in a seedy motel somewhere in the West, yelling and socking each other over a passion that cannot be. It goes on too long and the flashbacks that reveal the root of the problem come too late and too fleetingly. The principles do their drag-'em out best, but in the end it's much ado about very little. The movie is not very entertaining or enlightening, and it has a strong egocentric feeling about it for Sheppard. Randy Quaid also appears.",1110585600,8,755,4.6
1985898,3,B0001AW0UW,"This movie is fine, excellent acting for Sam Shepard, it is based out of his play. Great songs from Sandy Rogers. Nice ending. The only downside is Kim Basinger, her only actions during this film is screaming and kicking.",1363478400,,221,4.6923076923076925
1985899,4,B0001AW0UW,I enjoyed this dvd and found the style similar to TW's.  I always enjoy Sam Shepard.  Would recommend this - what I would call little known - character study.,1363392000,,158,4.413793103448276
1985900,4,B0001AW0UW,"Interesting, laid back version of the Shepherd play. On stage, with Ed Harris in the lead, it was all frenetic energy and danger. Here the piece is more moody and dreamlike. At times that works tremendously well, and it is visually beautiful. The play has been opened up in a way that feels natural and not forced. And the use of narration is very interesting and productively unsettling, since the memories we see do not quite match the words we hear.

On the other hand, the slower pace makes the writing feel more melodramatic and almost old-fashioned in its twists. And Shepherd is nowhere near as interesting as Harris was on stage. We never feel that he is really dangerous. He comes off more as a love-struck kid than obsessed man. And it ends with a whimper, not a kick. Still, there are plenty of less interesting theater to film adaptations out there.",1343865600,2,861,4.627450980392157
1985901,1,B0001AW0UW,"My first Altman was Nashville (1975), until today a five star, like some of his later hits - The Player (1992), Short Cuts (1993) and Prt--porter (1994). Fool for Love is like a poor country version of Tennessee Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Richard Brooks, 1958), only that the main characters are not played by Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman and Burl Ives. Kim Basinger tries hard to get some logic into her part, but literally collapses against an incoherent, rather empty script. Lots of unmotivated violence. Nothing to write home about!",1316217600,,544,4.860215053763441
1985902,4,B0001AW0UW,"""Fool for Love"" (1985) is directed by Robert Altman (Mash, The Player, Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean). The film takes place in the desert, in the Southwest, where an old motel is located. Eddie (Sam Shepard) and May (Kim Basinger) are old flames, and Eddie has arrived after driving thousands of miles to drag May back with him. The venom, and love, and frustration, is all laid out as these two work out their issues with one another. The movie is somewhat reminiscent of the film ""Paris Texas"", which came out one year earlier, in its slow delivery of facts. When a friend (Randy Quaid) of May's comes by we begin to learn what is really behind the relationship of the two lovers. What is also interesting about the film is the mix of past events with present events as time and space are allowed to overlap, and memories take on a concrete quality. This adds a haunting, and somewhat dreamlike quality to the story, and we begin to wonder what is real, just as we begin to wonder if the stories Eddie and May are telling are true or not.

This dvd looks quite good, and it appears to be cleaned up and remastered when compared with images from the movie seen in the twenty minute special feature (Robert Altman: ""Art and Soul""), which has Robert Altman discussing the film. The special features also include some notes Altman wrote about the film.",1315353600,,1375,4.522088353413655
1985903,1,B0001AW0UW,Fool for Love was so slow and tedious I could not get through a half hour of it. The only redeeming part for was seeing Kim Basinger in her underwear for a few minutes. That was not nearly enough to justify watching this movie.,1306713600,,227,4.181818181818182

1985905,3,B0001AW0UW,"The problem with Fool for Love is that it is based on a wonderful, emotional play.  And if you HAVE READ the entire play, it is very difficult to see the work on film.  So much gets lost in translation, so much emotion is lost, especially in this film.  And naturally, for film, we need more dramatics, action, more scenery changes, and of course shortened dialogue.

When you see the movie version, you cannot ""feel"" the depth of love, loss, pain, co-dependency that May and Eddie have with one another.  In the book, we understand how the relationship between May and Eddie is recycled from the parents.  Life does repeat itself.  However, in the movie, much of that doesn't come across.

If you have NEVER READ the play, and are new to the story, you may like it, the theatrics, dramatics, backflash, acting.  Although Sam Shepherd did the screenplay from his own play, we get some reassurance on its production.  How could the writer of his own play screw it up for film.  The film was directed well, by the hugely popular and very successful TV and movie director, Robert Altman.

Sam Shepherd and Kim Basinger were cast well for their roles, however we experience visually who Eddie is rather  learn who he is through dialogue.  Randy Quaid's character Martin does not come across as the shy, simple and innocent man, and you miss the great written dialogue exchange that Eddie and Martin have in the book.

Eddie has come to take May back.  While Martin arrives for an evening with May, Eddie divulges to Martin,  the past, the sordid secret and through a few flashbacks, we learn how the incestual affair happened and how the parents life influenced May and Eddie's relationship.

If you are not into reading dramatic plays, go ahead and see the film.  But if you wish to appreciate the complete emotional story, read the book first.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fool-for-Love-and-Other-Plays/dp/0553345907/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fool for Love and Other Plays</a>.....Rizzo",1263254400,2,2031,5.11854103343465

1985907,4,B0001AW0UW,"I love Sam Shepard, so I'll see or read just about anything he's done. This one's a little hard to watch, though, partly because of pace, partly because of a slight bit of over-dramatizing from actors and director, and partly because of subject matter. Despite all this, it's still worth watching.",1171497600,2,297,4.8431372549019605

8009540,4,B0001AW0UW,"Altman's more magical realism take on Shepard's play, which, with the exception of the presence of the old man, is essentially straightforward. Great performances in a work that initially strikes one as more significant than it really is. Big themes, strong characters but meandering soliloquies that on retrospect, don't add anything to the narrative and are not brilliant writing. Still, worth a look.",1489968000,,403,5.412698412698413

8009545,4,B0001AW0UW,"This film is more a symbolic work of art than a story.  Narrative elements are certainly important, although they are presented in a disjointed way, largely by means of flashbacks and memories, some of which are strangely blurred by the director or embellished by the characters recounting them, but the real substance of the film transcends the story.  It is a work in which the director literally confronts the viewer with rampant obsessive passion, but in a style that communicates a sense of disembodiment.  The imagery and music transport the film into a realm that does not rely on rational perception for its searing effect.  It the end, the viewer is engulfed in the destructive flames of ungoverned passion and in the rage and frustration it engenders, but the characters remain phantoms.",1395273600,2,797,5.015151515151516
