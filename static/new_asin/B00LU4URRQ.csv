8668156,5,B00LU4URRQ,An excellent film,1518393600,,17,5.0
8668157,1,B00LU4URRQ,"This was one of the absolute worst recantations of the history of slavery that I've ever heard...I got 1/2 way through the first episode and was totally disgusted. In what world is...""sexual contact with the women on the slave ship was determined by the captain""...not considered RAPE? If you aren't going to be truthful about America's shameful history of slavery, then don't say anything at all. Amazon you need to remove this from your video catalog. And this author needs a different day job.",1516752000,2,496,4.916666666666667
8668158,2,B00LU4URRQ,"Although the series chronicles major icons of the struggle for equality for Blacks in America... and evens adds info on some icons who were new to me, overall, I was offended by some of the verbiage used by the narrator, i.e., ""she was a hero to her kind""... Her kind of what? On a petty note, the background music on the Jackie Robinson piece was constant, annoying and eerie. It belongs in a horror flick, not a documentary. While I'm at it, why was there so much background music throughout the series? I understand the need for a few sound effects or climactic endings, but some of the music choices were creepy, distracting and incessant. Also, the role of the KKK in inciting hatred and violence in black communities is portrayed as  more of a menace than actual terrorism. Likewise, the subject of lynching of blacks was spotty. The subject of mass rape and terrorism of black women seems to have been avoided altogether.

Lastly, I found the Mississippi Burning segment shallow and missing crucial information on how it divided the LOCAL community of Philadelphia, Mississippi for almost two decades. They even went so far as to show the memorial at the church with no mention of when or how the monument was funded and erected. And six year old Ruby Bridges is portrayed as having ""a little trouble adjusting"" to being subjected to hatred and threats as the first to integrate schools in New Orleans... the fact is that she was severely traumatized, what we would call now PTSD. The story stops there.

This is a good piece for giving background to children, non-Americans or whites who may not fully understand how Africans came to America and the systematic disenfranchising of people of color in America. However, the tone of the series does not evoke empathy for the ongoing need for healing of race relations in America, but rather tends to laud accomplishments and give a false sense of progress.

Between the background music and the watered-down narration, I could barely watch the last episode. I was surprised to see that this was released in 2014. The lack of p/c by the narrator and the toned down story gives more of a feel of a production about race relations made in the early 80's.",1513123200,6,2206,4.722077922077922

8668161,2,B00LU4URRQ,Seems to gloss over how hard the struggle for our brothers and sisters has been and continues to be. Hardly any mention at all regarding the violence and hatred facing African Americans before emancipation and since reconstruction began. I wonder if these folks even spoke to a black historian.,1507420800,4,294,5.020408163265306

8668164,4,B00LU4URRQ,This was a very informative documentary on the struggles of African Americans throughout history which chronicled the very beginnings of slavery when the Europeans were the primary benefactors of the slave trade.,1426377600,,212,5.65625
