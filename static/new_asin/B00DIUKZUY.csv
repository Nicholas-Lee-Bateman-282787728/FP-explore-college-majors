5819217,4,B00DIUKZUY,"Made in 1966, starring Michael Rennie (The Day the Earth Stood Still) as a time traveler who comes back to the year 1966 to
prevent a ""Radio Telepathy"" experiment from taking place. He is on a mission to prevent a world catastrophe by thwarting the
experiment which in his time frame (2087) allows the government to control all thoughts and actions.
I remember watching this as a teenager sometime in the late 60's. It's an enjoyable science fiction movie, far from a classic but
still pretty good! The transfer to DVD is a bit grainy but not bad.",1393027200,6,547,4.591836734693878
8593611,3,B00DIUKZUY,"I bought this DVD as part of Kino-Lorber's summer 2018 sale, mostly owing to the fact that I remembered the movie well from showings on WCBS-TV in the 1970s (the network apparently licensed a big chunk of United Pictures Corporation's output, and some of it ended up on the network owned-and-operated station's Sunday night late movie at 11:45, while at least one, PANIC IN THE CITY, was shown in prime-time during one of the summer months). And it looks and sounds fine -- the HD transfer is the best this movie has looked probably since the year it went into release. The correct aspect ratio is used, framing the action just right, and if that were all there were to this release, it would be a three-star item, worth $10 for fans of the genre.

But that isn't all there is. The makers have included an audio commentary by Chris Alexander, a filmmaker and writer. And with all due respect, it adds little to the value of the package. Recording without any real preparation or research -- which he freely admits -- Alexander rambles off a bunch of personal observations about the way these inexpensive movies were made, and the talent involved, some on their way down (Michael Rennie, Wendell Corey, Karen Steel, Harry Carey Jr. et al) and on their way up (the special effects team), or just coasting (the editor, Frank Keller). But he keeps harping on thematic connections between this movie and TERMINATOR, before conceding at the end that it is closer to TERMINATOR 2 in some ways. And he keeps going back to two OUTER LIMITS episodes that seem to have influenced the plot here, ""Soldier"" and ""Demon With A Glass Hand,"" both authored by Harlan Ellison, while never mentioning the OUTER LIMITS show with the most obvious plot connection, ""The Man Who Was Never Born."" And we never hear about such matters as the connections between United Pictures Corporation, National Telefilm Associates and Republic Pictures, despite the fact that Franklin Adreon, who directed this picture (and whose last picture it was), was a veteran of Republic's serials (and was employing longtime stuntman -- at Republic and elsewhere -- Dale Van Sickel as one of the ""Tracers"" in this movie). There are so many missed opportunities for discussion while Alexander keeps harping on TERMINATOR, that it ultimately becomes slightly frustrating as well as comical listening to the track. This is one that Tim Lucas should have taken.",1530748800,,2411,4.866180048661801
8593612,4,B00DIUKZUY,"This was s childhood favorite repeated frequently on late 60s local tv stations. Originally made for tv but ultimately had theatrical release first. Corny, dated, but fun and resembles a possible plot from Time Tunnel.  Kudos to KL for releasing with a great transfer that is sharp and consistent throughout.",1528675200,,308,5.16
8593613,5,B00DIUKZUY,"Saw this when I was about 9, and I have looked for it for a long time.  No matter what anyone says, this is where the idea for the terminator series came from.",1525046400,,159,3.8181818181818183
8593614,4,B00DIUKZUY,"I like bad B-Movies, and Cyborg 2087 is a great new addition to my collection.  It's a fun watch. My wife and I laughed a lot at the cheapo props and sets, and especially the goofy fight scenes. The blu-ray is beautiful with clear image and audio. The directing isn't at a ""Plan 9"" level of ineptitude, but it's pretty flat and feels a little like a mediocre TV episode. The star, Michael Rennie, who was so awesome in the original, ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"",  is overqualified in this silly sci-fi romp and I felt a little sorry for him.  Cyborg 2087 is almost a real movie and so I couldn't give it 5-stars in the bad B-Movie category.  I'm very happy to own it.",1515801600,,670,4.251968503937008
8593615,3,B00DIUKZUY,"I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE YET THOUGH, MICHAEL RENNIE  WAS AN EXCELLENT ACTOR IN THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, I AM BETTING THIS SCI-FI IS AT LEAST GOOD...STAY TUNED.",1510358400,,167,4.387096774193548
8593616,4,B00DIUKZUY,"BOTTOM LINE: An interesting diversion that may hold your attention IF you enjoy low budget old school sci-fi with more emphasis on script & plot than action and visual pizzaz (though, in all honesty, it's kinda lacking in all these areas. LOL). Originally a made-for-TV flick, which should give you a heads-up on what to expect from a technical and F/X standpoint. Film scholars may enjoy it for its many similarities to the James Cameron/Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi action classic TERMINATOR 2. I quite enjoy CYBORG 2087, and combined with the nice quality of this snazzy new hi-def transfer it makes this obscure old sci-fier even more fun. 4 STARS

THE STORY: In the future, mankind is enslaved by an electronic device which allows the cruel totalitarian government to completely control its helpless citizens telepathically . A resistance group manages to send a lone cyborg back to the year 1966 in order to prevent the scientist who created the mind control device from delivering it to our military, thereby derailing that dark future history. But the evil leaders of 2087 teleport two cyborg soldiers of their own back in time to thwart the plan. Which faction will succeed in its goal??

THOUGHTS: I bought this fun little film years ago from Sinister Cinema, in a faded, less-than-stellar PD-quality version. I never could have imagined that it would ever see the light of day on legit home video, and in beautiful hi-definition Blu-ray, no less! Uber-classy Michael Rennie, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILLs dapper alien Klattu himself, stars here as man machine Garth A7. Genre thesps Warren Stevens, Eduard Franz and Karen Steele co-star, along with some unsteady assistance from a tipsy Wendell Corey, an amusing bit part from Harry Carey Jr. as a frustrated newspaper reporter (who drives an impossibly cute 1964 Simca 1000 sub-subcompact), and a blink-and-youll-miss-it appearance at the beginning of the film by Jo Ann Pflug.

CYBORG 2087 was made as part of a nine-picture deal with United Pictures Corporation, though several of the films actually saw theatrical release first. The surprisingly high-concept script (by Arthur C. Pierce), is ultimately undermined by the films shoestring budget and pedestrian direction from Franklin Adreon. Interesting notably for its many T2 parallels; which are perhaps the primary reason to seek this obscurity out, along with the nice turn by the always professional Rennie. The opening and closing sections of CYBORG 2087 were shot in an abandoned old west town, which helps make this odd little film all the more off kilter and memorable. The visual style of the movie is interesting in that it is so flatly lit that, at times, the action could have been duplicated by animating some Colorforms cut-outs. And the whole look of the film is amazingly antiseptic. Look closely and you'll see that every outfit is perfectly laundered and pressed; no lint, dirt, wrinkles or other flaws to be seen on the clothing of ANY of the cast members. Likewise, the cars are impeccably washed, waxed and buffed, with nary a speck of mud nor scratch to be found. In fact, the entire film would seem to have been double dry-cleaned & completely sanitized prior to release. LOL.

THE BLU-RAY: This hi-def offering from Kino Lorber is minimal, but a real winner nonetheless. The transfer of this 1970's late late night TV staple is, quite frankly, nothing short of amazing. The crisp picture is a visual delight for the eyes and the mono soundtrack is likewise clear and clean. Soundmix is level. (You may recognize many of the musical cues from the soundtrack, courtesy of composer Paul Dunlap, which were immortalized later in the original 1968 NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD). The title-specific bonus content for CYBORG 2087 is limited to a full-length audio commentary from Chris Alexander that wanders a tad, but overall is surprisingly informative and fun. Theres also a gallery of trailers from other recent genre releases from Kino Lorber.

K-L has also released DIMENSION 5, another of the flicks in the 9-picture roster. Lets hope they will eventually offer the intriguing CASTLE OF EVIL and the immortally awful DESTINATION INNER SPACE, as well. *Fingers crossed!*",1508544000,7,4208,5.057636887608069
8593617,5,B00DIUKZUY,It was great just like I first saw it on TV Along time ago Imean parts are A bit dated but Michael Rennie was always A good actor especially in SCI FI  and Horror films  the special effects simple the cast great action parts alright. In the future an agent that's half human half machine he travels back in time to 1966 to stop A mistake at the same time being chased by to other cyborgs trying to stop him and at the same time some locals are after him and the other two not knowing what they are I don't think anyone can come up with A better plot.,1506729600,3,550,3.9909090909090907
8593618,4,B00DIUKZUY,"This review is for the film, not any VHS or DVD.  Mid 60's sci-fi flick starring the always welcome Michael Rennie.  He plays the title cyborg from said year.  He time machines himself back to the 1960's to prevent the creation of a device that will screw up the future from which he comes.  Chasing him are bad guy cyborgs that like the messed-up future the way it is.  I saw it on 70's TV and would love to see it released on a re-mastered DVD or DVD-R as soon as possible.  Recommended for fans of drecky bad films of the era.",1455494400,,529,4.137254901960785

8593620,4,B00DIUKZUY,"From the year 2087, a cyborg called Garth A7 (Michael Rennie- THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, ASSIGNMENT TERROR) is sent back in time to 1966. Garth A7 is on a mission to stop an event that will lead to the future enslavement of mankind by a nefarious government. We follow Garth A7 as he enlists the help of humans, while a pair of cyborg soldiers arrive from 2087 to eliminate him. Sort of a wacky predecessor to films such as THE TERMINATOR 1 and 2. The idea of a time-traveling cyborg, sent by a group of freedom fighters, in an attempt to stop a scientist from developing an advanced technology -""radio telepathy"" in this case- before it can be used for future tyrannical purposes is VERY familiar indeed! James Cameron simply must have been inspired by CYBORG 2087. Even the scene where Garth A7 shows a scientist the proof that he's a machine is extremely reminiscent of a similar revelation in T2! Of course, this film had neither the astronomical budget, nor the advantage of a Cameron to make it. Still, in spite of its colossal cheeeze-factor (and also because of it), CYBORG 2087 is a lot of fun to watch. Deserves to be rediscovered...",1426464000,8,1147,4.572815533980583
