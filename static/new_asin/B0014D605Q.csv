8255298,1,B0014D605Q,"This DVD is a joke.  The only secret society it deals with is the masonic order and, it doesn't do a very good job of that.  Anyone who has done a little research on secret societies, and the masons, would know what a joke this is.

 It fails to mention other secret societies, such as, illuminati, jacobin, thule society (hitler was a member), bilderberger's, etc.  It shows a few lame masonic initiation ceremonies.  It does not mention the incident in the 1830's when a group of mason's murdered one of their own for revealing some of their secrets and then used a masonic judge and heavily stacked masonic jury to get the perpetrator's off easy.  The country was so outraged that an anti-masonic political party was created and the masonic movement all but disappeared.

 The unexplained is right.  This DVD doesn't explain much.  In fact, it's plain boring.",1278892800,,862,4.756756756756757
