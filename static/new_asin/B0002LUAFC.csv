2103312,5,B0002LUAFC,"Nuri Bilge Ceylan is one of the most interesting new film makers in the world and, in my opinion, the best one in Turkey. This film I really think is his best as you can see for the numerous awards it has.

First of all I have to mention this is author cinema, an European-style film that some times could be misunderstood by those who are thinking about commercial cinema or that kind of minor and nasty products, like I've read in some reviews. This is quite poetic cinema, very close in style to Angelopoulos' one and with some links with Kieslowski, Tarkovsky and many other film makers that took cinema into a new level, much more understood like and art than like another industry for empty minds.

The time is slow, of course, like many of our lives are so many times, why it not should be this way? Ceylan really follow Tarkovsky's concept of `sculpting the time', the one Angelopoulos follows too when he said Tonino Guerra he preferred to drink a coffee slow, very slow, in order to not just drinking but tasting. If you don't like the kind cinema of those masters it will be difficult you enjoy this film, even it's not so complex like Tarkovsky's works or Angelopoulos' `Ulisses gaze'.

From the technical point of view, the film is wonderful, with a great quality of photography, very well recorded sound of the different situations (sea, coffees, mountains... you have to think this films don't have the typical original soundtrack; it works with another kind of thinking about the sound), great camera work, a very well prepared script to represent the lives of the main characters, good film edition...

As you can read the synopsis in this same page, I will not go over it again, just saying that it's a glance, an analysis of a mind in an existential crisis period on the 40s, a crisis because of the enormous solitude he feel in his life, in his apartment, even when his cousin comes to live with him, a moment in which it's confronted the life of a man who works in an intellectual field (Mahmut, the main character, that is a photographer) with an intellectual background seen in his house and his order, with the presence of Yusuf, a person from the village, not interested at all in art, culture, politics or any kind of abstract thinking. Of course, Mahmut is a man and he needs too woman's presence, like we watch on the film in a very realistic way that can jump in the same scene from watching Tarkovsky's `Stalker' on DVD to a pornographic film... that's life, no doubt. The presence of Tarkovsky is continuous in Mahmut's life as the aspiration of becoming a great artist. We listen him discussing with his friends, one of whom ask Mahmut for his forgotten desires of becoming a new Tarkovsky, so a man of deep art, and three times we have his films on the film, the first one when he is watching `Stalker' with his cousin, who leaves the room because he is boring of that film (it happens to me sometimes too), another time when the music of `Andrei Rublev' sounds when Mahmut is in the library and the third time when he is watching `Mirror' in his bed. That's clearly the reference of his life in the transcendental and artistic field and Mahmut seems to be lost about it, I think because of his solitude, much more terrible and suffered when his ex leaves the country with her new couple, a moment in which Mahmut has his last opportunity he knows he is missing, this puts he off and with a great sense of being lost for life.

It's a film in which many of the most important things are not told in words but using the other languages cinema has, like image, sound, camera shots, film edition... Of course, if you re not used to this kind of languages you can think nothing happens on the screen and that's absolutely false, you should think if something happens in your mind as a supposed intelligent watcher... that's my opinion and that's the result of so many years exposed to minor cinema in many cases. I have read this is a kind of minimalist cinema, NOT at all; using an all day story with no special effects doesn't means to be minimalist, that's Glass or Reich, for example, that is very different to this.

Great use of Istanbul as landscape, not the typical one from the postcards but the everyday city in which human beings fell, suffer and go deep into his minds, minds some times much more close to an European way of life, like Mahmut's one and some time much more close to the Asian Turkey, like Yusuf's one.

This Artificial Eye DVD is quite good, as far as I know. I have the Spanish edition, released by Cameo, but I have read this English edition is very good too, and with much more better extras.

Human thinking and feelings made art, that's, in my opinion, the most interesting way...",1139356800,6,4742,4.505813953488372
2103313,5,B0002LUAFC,"I saw this film for three times. Every time, I saw it, I got into deep thouhts. Life is very simple. Life is very short. Maybe not to be lonely can be solution for sadness. This film displays us deep sadness of the life.",1128297600,2,220,4.0227272727272725
2103314,3,B0002LUAFC,"This is a very slow-paced look at lives of quiet desperation in modern Istanbul. I have to admit being a little disappointed after reading how many awards this Turkish film, written and directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, won. It is, to be sure, well-acted and photographed, but I'm afraid there was not enough going on to keep me interested for most of it. Photographer Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir) leads a rather dull, routine existence, and has not recovered from his divorce. When his younger cousin Yusef (Mehmet Emin Toprak) arrives in town without a job or place to stay, Mahmut's predictable existence is threatened. Mahmut feels obligated to let Yusef stay in his apartment, but he is clearly not overjoyed at the prospect. At first the two are cordial, if not friendly to one another, but Yusef soon gets on Mahmut's nerves. All of this is portrayed in a series of low-key, often dialogue-free scenes. Most of what we know about Mahmut's state of mind comes not from anything he says or does, but by his melancholy expression and the overall aura of anomie he exudes. Yusef, in turn, soon feels isolated in the big city, where he is unable to find a job. He takes to following around women, who seem oblivious to his existence.

  The above pretty much summarizes the movie. There are a couple of arguments between the two roommates, but in general everything is understated and implied. Distant is moody and atmospheric, and captures something authentic about the loneliness of some single people in large cities. Unfortunately, the melancholy mood and slow pace of the film makes it not very accessible or entertaining. Neither of the characters are particularly likable or unlikable; we only know them from their mostly silent and resentful interaction with one another. The city itself is made to appear dull, gray and unappealing (the film takes place during a snowy winter). We can deduce from a few scenes that Istanbul is a populated and lively city, but we are forced to look at it through the eyes of these discontented men. Certainly a well done film, but not one I found especially powerful or memorable.",1119139200,4,2118,4.845303867403315
2103315,3,B0002LUAFC,"The only thing more boring than watching TV is watching others watch TV, which is in large part what you'll be doing in viewing ""Distant"". But that's not to say it's a terrible film. As someone else suggested, it's more of a mood piece than a plot-driven story. And speaking for myself, late at night I just want to wind down, rather than be overstimulated. No need to worry about rude awakenings from loud gunfire and the like here. Instead what we have is a middle-aged divorced photographer (Mahmut) in Istanbul who reluctantly takes in a distant relative (Yusef) who is seeking employment. Yusef appears to be basically good-natured, but his isolation in a strange city, sharing an apartment with a sullen man, prevents him from taking much initiative in human interaction.`And since Mahmut is not exactly Mr. Personality, the  ""plot"" goes nowhere. That's just reality folks; if your life is dull and you want to hold a mirror up to it, have I got a movie for you! (And for an added bonus, you can catch a glimmer of Istanbul.)",1117843200,3,1031,4.696132596685083
2103316,4,B0002LUAFC,"In an interview included on this DVD, Distant's director, Nuri Ceylan, talks about making the film and about his perspective on filmmaking, including his influences (largely Chekovian).  He speaks in excellent English which is a measure of his keen intelligence and versatility. Also included on the disk is Ceylan's brilliant short wordless black and white film Koza (Cocoon) which is almost in itself worth the price of the DVD.

Distant's leads are two men--a recently divorced photographer, Mahmut, who's a city dweller (Istanbul) and his distant relative Yusuf who's from the country. Each man has a reason to feel dissociated from society. Mahmut's recent divorce has left him emotionally isolated, hollow--he meets with his ex-wife and the viewer can see the regret of his splitting up with her all over his face without him having to say anything explicitly. He spends an inordinate amount of time watching TV or movies on TV, including porn, but often does this late at night, using the glare of the screen as a mesmerizing soporific.

Yusuf has lost his factory job and has come to Istanbul hoping for a better life. Instead what he finds is an economy as bad as where he came from. Unable to find work, he spends his daylight hours semi-stalking women, but never initiating any contact. He's withdrawn, afraid, isolated.

The subtle intercutting of the lives of the two men is skillfully handled and when they are together--Mahmut has agreed to put up Yusuf in his home--it's not hard to tell that what Mahmut really resents more than anything else is another person who does nothing at all to assuage his own isolation but instead, by his mere presence alone, reinforces it.

Ceylan is so skilled at this subtle portrayal that it might be easy to feel bored with some of the film, particularly the stretches when Mahmut watches TV. But because there is a palpable undercurrent of unease directly related to the aloneness both men experience, the film silently and slowly grows in momentum, building up this feeling until at the end we understand these characters more than we thought we would at the beginning--or even the middle of the film.

Winner of several prizes at international film festivals, including Cannes, Distant cannot be said to be ""gripping"", but is without question the work of a truly talented filmmaker who is more than aware of the emotional nuances of human behavior.

Highly recommended.",1116288000,26,2423,4.9679012345679014
2103317,3,B0002LUAFC,"More mood piece than actual drama, the appropriately titled ""Distant"" is an emotionally detached Turkish film that brings new meaning to the term ""minimalist storytelling.""  What little story it does tell involves an unemployed man from the provinces who comes to Istanbul in search of a job.  While there, he stays with his cousin, a divorced professional photographer, who prefers to lead a life of drab solitude rather than interrelate with his fellow man.  Naturally, having this rube from the country suddenly show up on his doorstep does not sit well with the life and style of this virtual hermit.

Since this is, essentially, a film about a lack of communication, it is understandable that very little of the screen time is devoted to characters interacting with one another.  Instead, long stretches of the movie are taken up in showing us characters wandering through the stark snow-covered landscapes of wintry Istanbul or sitting in dreary rooms either alone or with other people who are equally cut off from those around them.  ""Distant"" has much of the feel of an Antonioni film, in that the beautifully composed and photographed background comes to predominate over the people in the foreground, a visual correlative to mankind's ennui, alienation and angst.  As a director, Nuri Bilge Ceylon (who also wrote the film) uses the camera almost as an artist does his canvas, painting icily beautiful pictures of the world around him.  Ceylan's unhurried, deliberate pacing becomes strangely hypnotic as he dwells on one extraordinary image after another.  Most of the film is spent concentrating on the mundane, day-to-day activities of these two passive, largely nonverbal individuals.  The film may drive some people mad with its lack of drama and action, but those able to appreciate its almost Zen-like rhythm and mood will find the movie intriguing.  There's an extraordinarily surreal shot of a docked tanker listing precariously towards port that is alone worth the price of admission (or rental fee).

For some, ""Distant"" may be little more than an art film with a capital ""A,""  but those with the patience to go beyond the obvious will relish its uniqueness.",1111881600,21,2179,5.104225352112676
2103318,4,B0002LUAFC,"A slice of contemporary Turkish life, done in an understated, finely paced manner. The old story of a country boy trying his luck in a big city and who instead of work and love, finds about who he is and what a selfish, alienated prick of a cousin he's got. The film is lyrical without unneccesary embellishments. It has a quiet, upbeat quality that sort of insinuates itself into one's thoughts and feelings.",1107043200,9,409,4.616438356164384
2103319,5,B0002LUAFC,"I bought this on the advice of another reviewer. I am glad i did. It may not be a feel good film but it does have unique qualities.

 I enjoyed it, but it was rather bleak. The film did a great job of communicating that hopeless feeling in life rather well, as well as the disconnect that can come between friends. The scene where he finds the pocket-watch but does not tell Yusuf was perhaps my favorite part. The part where he wanted to, but could not bring himself to, approach a woman was also very good. Especially the part on the train where the woman's leg is close to his. This basically sums up what it is like to be a man. We can be, without a woman, very lonely creatures. God bless women. Amen.

Thanks for showing me this poignant film. I will re-visit it again for sure. I'm glad I picked it up.",1197072000,,809,4.173076923076923
2103320,4,B0002LUAFC,"You will find fewer more appropriately titled films than ""Distant"". Opening with a snow-covered landscape with a city in the background, we witness through a stationary camera a small figure walking towards us. The figure is dwarfed by the rest of the mis-en-scene, and this distance seems to directly reflect the title itself. For those who find the opening shot (which takes minutes to unfold) too laborious to sit through, I recommend not even trying with the rest of the film. Containing very little dialogue and no cause-and-effect plot, Distant is a simple portrait of the titular distance between individuals and society, individuals and others, brothers, and, ultimately oneself. As Amazon and others have done a good job at offering a plot synopsis, I'll skip that.

Distant unfolds less like a fictional narrative and more like life captured through a camera. I would call Ceylan's style ""neo-realist voyeurism"". Ceylan seems to subscribe to the theory of making films as true to life as possible, and even at its most beautiful, the director's influence of the affairs is rarely felt. True to this style, the film moves at life's pace. By ""life's pace"" I mean there are no quick edits allowing viewers to jump to the most relevant bits. Ceylan often stays focused on seemingly inconsequential scenes for a while. These long stretches of quiet are underscored with a ""palpable current of unease"" as one reviewer sharply noted. In the case of Mahmut watching TV, the length allows the viewer to pause and realize some inherent irony and absurdity in watching someone watching - or in living vicariously through someone doing the same. Others, such as Yusuf standing silently in a hall with an attractive young woman (one much like those whom he follows around the streets of Istanbul) highlights the theme of the difficulty in making first contact.

""Stark beauty"" is a phrase you would hear used to describe this film, and I'm hard pressed to find a better one. Scenes of these characters wandering around Istanbul in winter are surprisingly gorgeous. But this isn't empty prettiness, as the actions of the characters in these scenes, and even the cold itself seems to reflect the central themes superbly. Beyond these chilling winter wonderland visions are others that are more of the surrealistic vein. The overturned tanker in the harbor has been mentioned. This shot is so shocking that one will be initially confused as to exactly what you're looking at. In a film about the normal and every day, this capturing of the completely abnormal and fantastic is a visceral punch. Another favorite scene is Mahmut's dream. This highlights a quality of this minimalistic style; despite that almost nothing happens (save for one small exception) Ceylan is able to extract from this a reaction due to how abstract it is from the normalcy around it.

Distant also contains some rather funny moments that closely resembles elements of our own lives. Not the least of which is the running motif of trying to catch a mouse with sticky paper - which includes a wonderful piece of dialogue regarding one particular failure. Distant is slightly deceptive as it almost makes you believe this will be a comedy. These hopes are dashed as it ends on a note of devastatingly quiet, solitary contemplation. The final scene was thoroughly moving in its subtle, emotive power, and is perhaps the only scene where Ceylon's influence as an artist can be felt. When juxtaposed next to the opening scene, I think the two make a very poignant artistic statement. Distant isn't just a film of mere moments, however. The whole it creates is a nuanced and fully realized slice-of-life portrait of two troubled souls in Istanbul: One man trying to find meaning and direction in his life after a crippling divorce, one man trying to start a life with little talent and less ambition, and the relationship of these two brothers during all this. These relationships and themes are universal enough to allow everyone to connect in some way. As one reviewer said, Ceylan has an uncanny grasp on the nuances of people and relationships, and there are countless examples of terrific, wordless character and relationship development within Distant that might not register initially with the viewer.

Distant is a film that likely won't hit you immediately - as it is as nuanced and subtle a film as you'll ever see. But I do agree with Roger Ebert who asked ""How is it that the same movie can seem tedious on first viewing and absorbing on the second?"" One answer is that during your first viewing you will patiently wait for something (an event) to happen. Once you realize that nothing will, you are free to go back and let yourself be absorbed in the lives of these characters and the beautiful mosaic Ceylan paints. Long after my initial viewing I find that scenes and moments from Distant replay in my mind less like those from a film, and more vividly like those from memory. And I think that speaks volumes of the enduring power of many ""boring art films"" such as this.",1194912000,11,5049,4.887981330221703
2103321,4,B0002LUAFC,"This languid, elliptical film set in Istanbul is a fascinating study of urban isolation, as a divorced, middle-age photographer reluctantly takes in a younger man from the country, who is looking for work. Not so much an odd couple, because they are two of a kind, they manage to grate on each other, a fact that comes across mostly in long silences until there is a final outburst between them. Sympathetic first with the older man, when his temporary house guest does little to take responsibility for himself, we unexpectedly shift our allegiance to the other man when a silver pocket watch disappears.

Working with a small crew and more than a little under the influence of Chekhov, the writer-director walks the fine line between comedy and melodrama, letting the simple premise of the film unfold slowly, relishing its many moments without hurrying toward a resolution of the building conflict. Time passes, and no one changes. Meanwhile the cinematography (both interiors and exteriors) is striking, particularly as one sequence plays out in a day of heavy snowfall. The DVD includes a cinema-verite-style making-of featurette and a lengthy and illuminating interview the director.",1183939200,,1189,5.192708333333333
2103322,5,B0002LUAFC,"Alienation is a new experience in Turkish society, reflected in this film in an innocent way: there's no violence, no sexual extremes of the ""Last Tango in Paris"" kind, no murder revelations of the ""Blow Up"" kind - everything in this film is about innocence. The best illustration, in my humble opinion, is when Mahmut the photographer recognizes the beauty of innocent Anatolia landscape but gives up on photographing it, not being sure if it really was worth photographing it or not. In a word, he lost his roots - he couldn't discern them anymore and that exactly is what was the drama of the movie, expressed in a subtle way not familiar to us westerners. We, the westerners, need strong stimuli in order to be able to ponder and comprehend the world phenomena, to our own disadvantage.",1176940800,3,790,4.731884057971015
2103323,5,B0002LUAFC,"One of the best films to have been released in recent years and an exellent insight into post 1999 earthquake Turkey.

You will have to watch the film at least twice (I did) The first time you watch it you will be thinking ""This film is awful"" ""The sound quality is terrible"" ""The acting is awful"" It is only when you watch it for a second time that you start to appreciate it.

For a start the character Mahmut was not chosen because of his acting ability he was chosen due to his facial expressions and how well he fitted the character, the quality of sound reflects the realism of the film there is no background music (apart from those coming from chimes blown by the wind) There is a lack of light in the appartment again, to add to the realism of the film.

Turkey was going through a tough time when this film was made, the economic crisis made thousands jobless and those already without jobs even more desperate, everyone was looking for work and using whatever connections they had to find employmnet.

This film is no east V west or modern V traditional but rather the life of 2 ordinary Turks on screen.  On the one hand we have Mahmut, from rural Turkey (as most of the population is) who had came to Istanbul many years before, made it good largely through his own hard work and made a decent life for himself.  Sadly, his personal life has not been so fortunate.  Divorced from his wife in spite of his numerous friends he is a lonely character seemingly finding solace in prostitutes and alcohol.

Then along comes Yusuf, straight from Mahmuts home village and seeking work after the local factory has closed down he arrives in Istanbul with no real idea of how to find a job and no comprehention that Mahmut has his own problems to deal with and the last thing he could possibly want would be a relative who thinks he is going to find work, a partner and a whole new life for him in the big city.

This film is perhaps the most accurate analysis of the tensions that go on every day in large cities in Turkey between those already settled there and those who have newly arrived.  One point that is missing though, there is no mention of Yusuf being either invited to stay with Mahmud or just arriving without notice I would have been interested in the dynamics of that.

He watches television for endless hours in his dark apartment, frequents bars and restaurants alone, worries about his mother who is hospitalized, chain smokes, and badly misses his former wife Nazan who is emigrating to Canada with her new husband. Then his relative Yusuf shows up on his doorstep in Istanbul, unemployed and unemployable. Yusuf upsets all of Mahmut's petty habits and routines, leaving lights on, smoking in the wrong rooms, not flushing, littering beer cans, and the like. The film explores the palpable loneliness and lostness of these two men, and how they interact. Truly, they are ""distant"" from any meaningful friendship with each other, the world, or even their own selves. In Turkish with English subtitles.",1169596800,3,894,5.08843537414966
2103325,2,B0002LUAFC,"The director of DISTANT reportedly used his own apartment as the primary set, his own belongings, e.g. his personal car, as props, and a friend and a cousin as the two principal characters. Such dedication to the creative impulse deserves more than I can bestow.

Here, a divorced professional photographer, Mahmut (Muzaffer Ozdemir) lives a reclusive life in an Istanbul suburb, his only contact with the rest of the species being an occasional tryst with a prostitute. One day, his cousin from the country, Yusuf (Emin Toprak), arrives in the Big City. Yusuf's father has recently been laid off from his job, and Yusuf is hoping to land a berth on one of the merchant ships that docks in Istanbul to help pay for his ailing mother's health care. Thinking that his relative will soon be set up on his own, Mahmut invites the young man to stay with him. But, as the latter's hopes for employment shrivel in a dried-up job market and his habitation with Mahmut is extended, the tension between the two increases due to Mahmut's smoldering resentment at the intrusion on his space.

Had DISTANT been written as a comedy, such as the American film THE ODD COUPLE, or had it been made edgier with a violent end, it would've been worth the viewing time. Rather, it's a slow-moving, unengaging exercise that peters out to an unremarkable conclusion.

The only surprise in this film for me was the revelation that Istanbul, at sea level in a temperate clime, experiences snow in the winter. Who would've thought?",1160092800,4,1505,4.780769230769231
2103326,4,B0002LUAFC,"I watched the DVD Distant about 4 years after it was released in 2002.  Let me say upfront that I am not an admirer of European or Turkish cinema at all.  In fact, I had previously been disappointed with many European or Turkish productions to the degree that I almost quit watching them.

To my surprise, I did find a lot to watch and enjoy in the movie Distant.  The photographic visuals are suberb due to the director Nuri Bilge Ceylan, who is a long-time photographer.  Minimalist natural lighting actually augments the theme of loneliness and the minimal communication among the lead actors.  Powerful visuals are definitely among the top strengths of this movie.  Emotional power is another one.

I particularly enjoyed watching two of the special features in the DVD, behind-the-scenes footage and interview with the director.  Plot Synopsis at Amazon here states that the director employed his relatives as amateur actors for this movie.  In my opinion, you can witness the lack of self-confidence of the character named Yusuf when you see behind-the-scenes footage, in which the director literally spoon-feeds the exact details of his role under the snow in Istanbul.

I did not enjoy the no-script theatrical trailer among the special features.  It gives you no clues about the movie at all.  It might serve well as a trailer for a slide show but it really falls short of the expectations from a theatrical trailer for a drama.  If you were to see the theatrical trailer before you watch the movie, you would probably wonder ""What is this movie about?""  It should have been accompanied with a voiceover as in Hollywood theatrical trailers.

I believe the movie Distant really lacks a soundtrack to make a punch.  Silent passages in the movie are abundant, and they could surely make use of an emotional Turkish soundtrack to support the theme of the movie.  The country of Turkey happens to be quite rich in the amount of emotional music.

Then he is not pleased with him not turning off the lights that he is not using. Then then some. He begins to think that the young reletive guy is just annoying.
He cannot watch porn free and everything is just not working well with him around.
He begins to be not nice to him anymore.
The young guy feels this too.
But who cares, he is a barefaced somehow. He stays longer.

8028952,5,B0002LUAFC,"UZAK (DISTANT) is set in stanbul in the depths of winter. The snow carpets the roads and sidewalks, the Bosphorus extends into the background in a vast gray mass. Life goes on in the European side of the city, but it seems that no one really wants to spend time socializing with one another, either indoors or outdoors.

This is the context for Nuri Bilge Ceylan's third full-length feature that focuses on two protagonists. Yusuf (M. Emin Toprak) comes from the country to seek his fortune and lodges with his near- relative Mahmut (Muzaffer zdemir). Full of optimism at the start, Yusuf discovers that finding a job is not as straightforward in stanbul as he had anticipated, and ends up spending most of his days either trudging the streets or lolling in front of the television. Meanwhile Mahmut pursues his career as a photographer while becoming increasingly resentful of Yusuf's presence within his midst.

Around this straightforward plot director Ceylan creates a harsh, unforgiving world dominated by alienation. As Mahmut and Yusuf look out of the apartment window, they see nothing but an oppressive view of other gray-looking apartment blocks, with ships slowly traveling up and down the Bosphorus in the distance. Mahmut seldom if ever talks to Yusuf except to wish him goodnight, and treats his guest as something of a social leper. At one point Mahmut sniffs Yusuf's shoes and sprays them with air-freshener before putting them away in a cupboard. As he walks round the streets, Yusuf finds that most stanbullus don't want to know him; they either respond to his queries in monosyllables, or simply don't talk to him at all. In one shot he is shown sitting moodily in a sailors' caf drinking tea and smoking, half-listening to the other customers but also in a trance-like state.

Despite his outward success as a photographer, Mahmut is equally alienated from his surroundings. As in MAYIS SIKINTISI, where Muzaffer (once again played by zdemir) was a movie-maker using his parents as actors, UZAK shows how the use of a camera represents something of a flight from a reality, a vicarious imitation of life rather than a practical engagement with it. Being a photographer gives Mahmut a feeling of purpose in an otherwise sterile life, as demonstrated by the sight of him sitting moodily in a bar drinking beer and smoking, not talking to anyone. Ceylan introduces a sub- plot showing Mahmut's relationship with ex-wife Nazan (Zuhal Gencer Erkaya), that further alerts us to the sterility of his life.

Ceylan reinforces the theme of distance with a cinematic style guaranteed to place a gap between ourselves and the characters. There are several shot-sequences repeated throughout the narrative (Mahmut in a bar, Yusuf in the sailor's caf, both men looking out moodily at the Bosphorus); while the characters are shown sitting down in Mahmut's apartment with the television on, but making no attempt to look at it. It is just an item of visual wallpaper, the enemy in the corner.

As in his other movies, Ceylan's narrative unfolds at a leisurely pace, with lengthy shots containing little or no dialogue. It is the atmosphere that matters; the sight of the characters standing wistfully by the Bosphorus reminds us of the power of the elements and the inability of the protagonists to understand this power. They are doomed to live unfulfilled lives in semi-perpetual isolation.

UZAK continues the themes of Ceylan's earlier work, while introducing further levels of meaning, centering especially on the parallels and differences between rural and city life in contemporary Turkey. It is, quite simply, a modern classic.",1460332800,,3641,5.049916805324459

8028955,2,B0002LUAFC,Yes I get the point of the film but honestly i think some high school drama class could do just as good a job at making this stunningly boring film. It is evident the director is trying to copy the great russian director tarkovsky. Another very overated so called art film.,1384387200,,273,4.372549019607843
8028956,3,B0002LUAFC,"""If you thought art films from Europe/Asia were just a plain bore, you might think this small-scale drama about loneliness, lack of forgiveness, fear, and family as one of the worst films you could endure. However, even it is vague and boring in several places, it does not seem to disappoint and famed Turkish director Nuri Bilge Ceylan brings about a convincing story of two men named Yusuf and Mahmut trying to bring about their lives into something more convincing is at many places cold, uncertain, lovely to watch (busier and rural parts of Turkey certainly looks better in snow), absurdly hilarious in the most off-the-wall way (Mahmut watches smut and then skips it once Yusuf comes in without any dialogue or reaction), and mild-mannered.

Nothing exaggerated here but the sound of the wind blowing through the air and a toy soldier on the floor. On the side of who is better, it would be Mahmut since he is a bit more experienced in his life and disciplined than the very quiet and careless Yusuf who would rather spy on women or smoke cheap cigarettes. It is the individual scenes (like the scenes with Mahmut drinking and acting like he is depressed) set on stone that are more compelling than the whole and a film that reminded me a lot of Uzak was Le Havre, a Finnish-French film by Aki Kaurismaki about a man holding an immigrant child but Le Havre was slightly (not a lot though) more driven and humorous than this one here.

While this is far too ambiguous to give a recommendation, it is commendable enough to be almost a Godard-esque British Film Institute film study where mood, character, and set design is everything and probably more important than the rather basic narrative.""",1381104000,,1700,4.739864864864865
8028957,1,B0002LUAFC,"Firstly the good part:

- the amazing interpretation of the lead character, he is fabulous.

Secondly the nice part:

- Good photography, very good scenery.

The bad part:

- I understand and appreciate theme driven films with relatively little plots, and the theme of isolation ad ""Uzak"" is there, even in the middle of a huge city like Istambul...but for a movie of almost two hours there is a need of something to lead the story. There is no such thing. Simple story. Simple characters. No drama.

The ugly:

- focusing 10 second takes on a extra is ridiculous (like the man watching the woman that satisfies the lead character walking and getting in a car...he then ...watches...and watches...), I sincirely thought that he was an important secondary character and waited anxiously for him to reappear...silly me.
- watching persons smoke in real time isn't introspective, it's waste of footage and viewers time.
- I never watched pornographic movies (though my boyfriend sometimes do see them, and i'm fine with that), and it was ridiculous watching it through the television of the main character!!! Couldn't the director just show a few seconds and then change the camera focusing on the character (because THIS IS an introspective movie isn't it? It's more important seeing the reactions of the character then pretty girls ""having fun"").
- Less is more...in this case less 40 minutes would get this movie 4 extra stars...",1327536000,2,1429,4.953974895397489
8028958,4,B0002LUAFC,"Nuri Bilge Ceylan's 2002 film Distant (Uzak)- his third feature film (his first was 1997's black and white The Small Town- Kasaba), is a significant step up from his good but flawed 1999 film Clouds Of May (Mayis Sikintisi). The earlier film had potential, but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways- plot holes and wooden acting from amateurs. That Clouds Of May succeeded on any level was a testament to Ceylan's talent as a budding filmmaker. However, Distant is Ceylan's arrival on the international scene as a great artist, one who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman (although his screenplay is not as dialogue-heavy it is just as brooding, and he lacks Bergman's penchant for close-ups- his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose penetrating scenes of contemplation Ceylan reconfigures). The bulk of the film takes place in snowy hibernal Istanbul (the fact that it snows in Turkey will likely surprise some), which lends the film a definite Bergmanian feel, as well as reminding one of some of the bleak snowy urban images from Krzysztof Kieslowski's The Decalogue. The natural images invoke the best of Werner Herzog- as they tend to go on a beat or two longer than standard film theory would dictate- which is what makes them even more memorable, while the urban landscapes range from the nearly Precisionist compositions of Michelangelo Antonioni to the cultural hagiography of Woody Allen- one shot of a bench overlooking water is a direct quotation (read steal) from Manhattan, save the lack of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene, Ceylan similarly quotes a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from Ozu's Tokyo Story. Yet, like all great artists, Ceylan makes his appropriations his own art, by slightly altering them and keeping them apropos to his own film's needs.... Distant is a film whose title suffuses the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewers will have toward them, but it does not describe the film itself, for scenes stay with one long after the film ends. Perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when Mahmut stalks his ex-wife at the Istanbul airport, and watches her with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove her from his life forever. As he watches her, from a distance, we see her catch just a glance of him watching her. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this film. He pulls back behind a column, and Nazan merely turns her head back to her future. Mahmut is her past, and she knows how to best move on- just keep moving. Mahmut will never get it. Most rarely get such moments of insight into themselves of life. That some viewers will get the film, and that Ceylan gets his own powers of creation, shows that ignorance can teach, as long as one moves about it. Distant does, albeit it at just the right length.",1221004800,,2983,4.749518304431599
