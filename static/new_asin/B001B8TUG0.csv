3486868,4,B001B8TUG0,"I bought this DVD and Zombie Strippers at the same time, and let me say that Zombies, Zombies, Zombies was the DVD I expected to suck. It was, however, just the opposite. Zombies, Zombies, Zombies was actually pretty darn good for a low budget horror movie, and even with its big star, Jenna Jameson couldn't save that other piece of crap.
The plot is your standard zombie movie story with some refreshing twists. No military experiment or radiation here. Crack whores smoke glowing crack rock thus starting the zombie epidemic. Plenty of laughs and gore to keep things moving along. The special effects are pretty rediculously awful in a few scenes, though. Good dialouge and characters, especially the Samuel L. Jackson-ish pimp guy. Sure, this movie is bad, but its a lot of fun and definately way better than a lot of low budget horror films out there. I liked it a lot.
I'd recommend this DVD over Zombie Strippers for sure.",1229644800,3,929,4.7407407407407405
3486869,3,B001B8TUG0,"This was a fun little movie. Obviously a first time crew doing this film. Actors are bad, production value is bad, but the worse part was the casting. The ""tough guy pimp"" is obviously not tough. The ""ladies man DJ"" seems like a gay guy trying, and failing, to act straight. There are others as well, but that's a large part of what makes this movie a joy to laugh at. Most of the women who actually bare themselves look good without a top on regardless of what American Soldier said. At least in my opinion anyway. I'm kind of glad this movie didn't have a larger budget though. I don't think I would have laughed half as hard as I did then. The extras in this movie are a treat to watch. You get to see these people who are in their first movie have it go to their head... hilarious!! I hope the let down isn't that hard on them when they find that this isn't a spring board to stardom for them. Anyway, there are some technical issues with this film, but I have my TV hooked up to my stereo so the low volume didn't bother me. All in all it was a fun B movie and I would recommend it to B movie fans. It's a whole lot more fun than the other Strippers VS Zombies flicks that I have seen! I would recommend it as long as you aren't paying too much for it.",1228435200,3,1257,4.032

3486871,3,B001B8TUG0,"Now here is a film that was highly anticipated for months by many the horror fan and zombie fan alike.  Okay, the topic alone, strippers and zombies, is pure fluff for the gratuitous B-movie blood-and-boobs crowd (the B&B crowd).  So if you like 1970's exploitation cinema or today's popcorn horror, you must be saying to yourself that you have to see this.  So let's talk about the film.

The movie takes place around a gentleman's club right at the closing.  As one would figure, the film's characters are either bouncers or exotic dancers.  With a few setup scenes, we are brought to understand that an amoral scientist at a private/government facility has a connection with a small time suburban drug dealer.  The dealer, a swarmy overweight man, steals some experimental drugs while the scientist retrieves a fix for the man.  Eventually the dealer hooks up with a streetwalker and shares the experimental drug with her resulting in the beginning of a zombie outbreak (in the likes of 28 Days Later).  Since the streetwalker and her friends hang out waiting for johns at the gentleman's club, the epicenter of the outbreak is the parking lot of the club itself.  So far, so good, right?

Well, this film could have been great for its genre.  Unfortunately it takes itself for what it is rather than trying to play out as a true horror or true exploitation film.  I'm as big a fan of horror comedy as anyone but the issue here is that there were too many characters that were true caricatures and obviously written to be that.  In most horror-comedies, the main protagonists are unaware that they are in such a film (i.e. Shaun of the Dead, Evil Dead 2, Feast, Dance of the Dead, etc.).  Here, however, we get a few characters that just don't work (specifically the pimp character and his main girlfriend).  As a result, we get a fun and entertaining film but ultimately a film that unrealized its potential.  Being a zombie stripper film, one would think that their would be a lot of blood and boobs.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case.  The gore will satisfy the B&B crowd but the boobs are few for such a film.

All in all, the film gets 3 stars.  There were a few standout performances especially Jessica Barton and many of the actors in smaller roles (such as the drug dealer, the main streetwalker, the DJ, and the scientist).  The screenplay was worthy with constant zombie and guts action, and the film had good set pieces.  The unrealized potential of the film, however, is unfortunate since this film could have been a cult classic; a true blood-and-boobs classic. Instead, we only get a popcorn film to enjoy.

The DVD deserves mention as a standout.  The extras and documentaries were great.  The people behind this film, the writer and director, have great futures ahead of them.  And don't forget the cameo by Tiffany Shepis in a pre-credit five minute scene at the beginning of the film.  As always, she was great.",1225065600,22,2934,4.7

I'm serious!  Will they seriously just put anything on film and thrust it onto a DVD and shove it into a bargain bin at Best Buy or throw it up on Netflix?

What do people like?  Well they like large breasted topless women and they like zombie movies where people hole up in a place and try to fight them off.  Throw them together, sure that sounds like a block buster hit to me!

The video quality is crap, the story is so lame that it's almost painful, the acting is completely awful.  The sets look like they found an old abandoned building and threw some vials of color water up on Bunsen burners and presto!  We've got a science lab to do science stuff in!  Then get one of the actors to have their buddy who owns a diner let us shoot there after hours and then throw in a strip club that looks faker than a political candidate's smile on election day, pump in some 3rd rate dance music that was thrown together using Windows Media Player and presto!  We've got a stip club!  And those are our locations for the entire film!  On top of that, the CGI effects were so lame that they looked faker than the actress's breasts during the topless scenes!

The only good part of this movie was we had the black pimp quoting Samuel L Jackson's famous line from Snakes on a Plane.

Just, oh my god!  My brain hurts from how awful this movie was!  How do I get the 80 minutes of my life back that I wasted watching this piece of celluloid garbage!?!

I had hoped that they actually wrote some sort of plot but they didn't.  The plot is ripped off from ""Zombie Stripper"" with only minor changes.  Not sure how they kept from getting sued for the rip-off since it is so very nearly the same exact movie.

Low budget movies are what they are.  No stars off for that.
1-1/2 stars off for a lame ""strippers with cloths"" theme.  :(

Therefore, don't think my low rating of this is because I just don't ""get"" this kind of movie. The acting is horrible even for a low budget which you can get passed if there is nice gore and a good nudity-to-bad acting ratio, however, for this film there was not. Drop the cgi special effects and stick with fake blood and common household items. It looks better and can be taken a little more serious. Not to mention the character they tried to make into a Samuel L. Jackson got about as close as being his retarded cousin. If you want good zombie movies look to Romero if you want a decent stripper zombie movie check out Zombie Strippers instead.",1271980800,4,741,4.338129496402877
3486885,3,B001B8TUG0,"To start, I am a bit biased - I knew many of the people involved in this film from High School and College, though I have fallen out of touch with many of them over the years.  So keep that in mind while reading my review.

I was terrifed going into this film... sure if I hated it I could tell them that I hadn't watched it yet... but I wanted so badly for them to have made a good movie.

And they did - well, good movie if you are a B-movie Zombie fan.  ZZZ is a strict B movie, filled with sub par acting, questionable sfx, and low production quality.  Where this movie excels is in it's fun factor.  So some junkie drug dealer steals some glowing crystals from a bio lab mistaking them for crack... then it ends up in the hands of a pack of crackwhores hanging out near the den of their arch-nemesis, the strippers.  Of course strippers and whores don't get along, so when the hoes turn man-eating zombie, it's up to the strippers and their flavor of the week boyfriends to try to defeat them.

What surprised me most was how well thought out the script actually was - if you can get past the poor execution, they really did have a pretty decent script.  Since many of the bit parts were played by one of my favorite sketch comedy troupes (doodiehumor) there were plenty of laughs involved.  I wasn't going to review this because I was afraid I would love it just for seeing all of their faces (it's been too long) but my husband who has never met any of these people before had to pause the movie twice because he was laughing so hard. (Once was a line in the diner, and the second was in the club with the pimp).  The best actors were our main hero who played an excellent deadpan normal guy, The Bouncer, and I've wavered back and forth on the pimp.  At first I hated him, but by the end of the film he had really grown on me.

Do I recommend this film to everyone?  NO! But I do recommend it to B movie Zombie fans.  There are boobies but not as many as you would expect given the setting, and there is plenty of blood and gore, in all shapes and colors, both good and bad.

In the end I would summarize this as an excellent group popcorn and beer flick for everyone to laugh and enjoy provided you have low expectations on production value and acting.",1263859200,8,2261,4.175115207373272

3486888,3,B001B8TUG0,"Okay, but a far less successful effort than the superior Zombies vs Strippers.  It has a few momemnts of crude humor and zombie gore, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone beyond fans of the genre.",1260144000,3,198,4.5
3486889,2,B001B8TUG0,"Zombies and strippers might be the best combination since some chunky slob slathered peanut butter and jelly onto a couple slices of bread.  This film is Night of the Living Dead meets Striptease...is it any good?

The film is certainly entertaining, but it should have been much better.  For every positive there are two negatives.  For starters, if you are making a movie about strippers there had damn well better be more than a few seconds of exposed female goodness.  The hottest stripper is the fake, catty, blonde bombshell, Dakota (Jessica Barton) who performs a titillating lap dance and all we get is a peek-a-boo nipple through a tuft of hair!  WTF!?!  I want to see topless bimbos blasting zombies with pump action shotguns whose kickback causes fake boobies to jiggle uncontrollably.  Don't sell me a horse and then hand me a pig dammit.

To be fair, it's not all bad.  The focus is clearly on the zombie action.  There are some fun special effects and practically every weapon that is a staple of the genre is on display.  Sadly, much of the effective zombie splatter is overshadowed by the amateurish CG effects.  The ending in particular looks like a scene from the videogame instead of a live action film.  I would have much preferred a more basic and organic approach.  The zombies do look good and they nail the slow and steady variation made famous by Romero.

Some of the more memorable characters are the aforementioned Dakota, the slap happy Pimp Johnny ""Backhand"" Vegas (Anthony Headen), and the reluctant hero Chris (Sean Harriman). Headen steals every scene he can as he channels Bernie Mac while Harriman won me over with his average Joe, deadpan delivery.  The rest of the cast was pretty bad, but I've seen much worse in movies with larger budgets.

I didn't love this movie nor did I hate it.  It could have been better, but given the inexperience of the people making it, they certainly did a commendable job.  It scores points for being the first film that turns whores into zombies via smoking crack, but there are too many glaring flaws to fully appreciate the sleazy genius on display.  Strippers vs zombies is an unreal premise and I hope that someday a more capable film crew can take the idea and run with it.

Final Grade: C-",1248825600,4,2264,4.707379134860051
3486890,2,B001B8TUG0,"Zombies! Zombies! Zombies! (Jason Murphy, 2008)

So let me ask you: why is it that, after the great zombie revolution of 1968, and the great zombie revitalizations of 1985 and 2004, it took someone forty years to make the most obvious movie ever: zombies vs. strippers? I mean, it seems to me that they go together like oil and vinegar. Potatoes and dill. Brains and... okay, I'll stop that one before I piss someone off.

In this typically cheesy, low-budget affair, a scientific experiment goes wrong (big surprise) and unleashes a horde of hungry zombies. Being for the most part men, the zombies do what is expected of them: they head for the nearest strip club. A bevy of different types of folks, including a number of strippers, one stripper's boyfriend, a bouncer, and a brutal pimp, among others, are trapped by the zombies, and have to both survive the night (why do they always have to survive the night? Zombies don't go away in daytime) and figure out where the zombies came from to see if they can come up with any clues to stop them.

It was quite a pleasant surprise to me that the script here, the first feature-length offering from screenwriter Anthony Steven Giordano, is clever and witty, if not subtle most of the time. I actually laughed out loud two or three times, which is rare for me when watching zombedies; there are quite a few amusing ones, but laugh-out-loud funny is rare. Unfortunately, the script is the only thing that really distinguishes the movie; the acting is sometimes competent, but generally not, while the special effects are about the level one would usually find in a high school movie shot direct to video. (Actually, given the existence of Pathogen, that's not strictly true; the special effects there were a fair sight better.) Still, it's not an entirely awful movie, and if you're the kind of person who can judge a movie by the potential it almost realizes, then you'll get a few kicks out of this. **",1246147200,4,1953,4.688046647230321

3486892,5,B001B8TUG0,"Have you ever thought to yourself, What if there was a movie with Strippers killing zombies? Well the question is answered, There is! It's called Zombies, Zombies, Zombies Vs Strippers! No it is not a soft core porn video featuring zombies having sex with strippers, It's an all out war between Strippers vs Zombies, If you like movies like the ever so popular Shaun Of The Dead then you are in for a real treat. Zombies, Zombies, Zombies Vs Strippers will raise your hormones and testosterone to a level were your going to feel like your going to pop and give you some of the best laughs a Horror/Comedy can.

The film starts out where a drug experiment goes terribly wrong, this over weight sweat hog junkie is visiting a scientist who happens to be working on some kind or serum that reanimates dead tissue. The fat slob then decides to steal the serum and head over to the strip club to get his rocks off , he picks up one of the hookers outside the strip club and smokes the serum in his car with her while they get down (I mean she gets down) well you go the point, and she did as well. The result does indeed get them high, so friggen high that the hooker steal what's leftover and smokes the living daylights out of it, Damn she is quiet the piece with her mouth! She even shares with her other prostitute friend, that's what friends are for!!

Inside the strip club we are introduced to a variety of strippers, it's like going to your local candy store and deciding what candy you want to suck on, You get the point, The characters that played the part as strippers we as sweet as candy, a bubble gum flavor of goodness!

Meanwhile at the strip club the hookers hang outside, it's first night for the new cute pigtailed girl named Harley, Harley gets into a verbal dispute with the hardcore Dallas and they have it going on, word for word I mean, The Girls and the bouncer go to breakfast at a local diner and that's where you see the first altercation between the hookers and strippers. It's the same hangout that the prostitutes that have smoked all that serum hang out. We get introduced to Johnny backhand (The pimp) and he by far is the funniest character of them all, he made my gut burst in laughter, I almost needed a C section to relieve the pain from laughing, he was good! Real Good!

The prostitutes take very ill all of a sudden and then immediately all turn in to zombies. Cue a mad dash back to the strip bar followed by the zombie outbreak you've all been looking for.

As I don't like to give every detail away you will see how it all boils down with the hookers, strippers, pimp, bouncer and two cent boyfriends in a struggle to survive, The movie soon takes a turn into an all out gore fest! We see Shotguns blasting! chainsaws dicing, bobbies bouncing, blood spilling into a river of insanity, All you males out there get ready for one of the most sexual lap dances ever to be captured in a movie, It's done by Jessica Barton and man she will make it hard for you to stand up out of your recliner, Get the tissues ready boys!! The ending was very original and never done before, what it is? I can't tell you , it's something you have to buy and see for yourself. This is not a movie just for males, It in fact it will please any woman that want's to see zombies in good old fashion glory.

Hats of to Zombies Zombies Zombies, it is low budget and a soon to be cult favorite so don't expect this movie to win an oscar, but it wins an oscar in the hearts of the horror genre fans. The acting is good, the plot comical/blood fest and, well, it's all very tasteless and, well, the hell with it. But God damn it is ground breaking, it's a hard on of thrills from start to finish.

Zombies, Zombies, Zombies vs Strippers is a toungue and cheek Horror/comedy, It's an epic battle between Hot and dead through the most unlikely characters. It's a GORE filled new age Strippers Vs Zombies Gone Wild!
