8601226,1,B00E4V0934,This documentary is absolute garbage. The sound quality is muffled and terrible. I would not recommend this to anyone and I wish I wouldn't have spent the money on it.,1467417600,,167,4.6

8601228,5,B00E4V0934,Ryan Lewis is a true master. Macklemore always seems to impress. Good Job!,1441238400,,74,4.769230769230769
8601229,1,B00E4V0934,This is literally made on I-movie. This is a joke. I can't believe that I serpent money on this.  Its all YouTube interviews and pixelated google images.,1388102400,2,153,4.666666666666667
8601230,1,B00E4V0934,"I can't believe I ordered this in advance. This is a very low quality product. The voice-over sounds like someone reading a resume. Bad visuals, and these are used over and over.  The concert footage was shot with a shaky camera from the audience. Mackleore and Ryan Lewis deserve better.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Macklemore-Ryan-Lewis-Highjacking-Hip-Hop/dp/B00E4V0934/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Macklemore & Ryan Lewis: Highjacking Hip Hop</a>",1381190400,5,495,7.389830508474576
8601231,1,B00E4V0934,This dvd has the thrill of some guy reading the Wikipedia page about Macklemore while showing short film clips that probably could have been found on you tube. It is very obvious that this was not approved or endorsed by Macklemore. This DVD does not deserve any more of my time.,1380672000,7,279,4.490196078431373
