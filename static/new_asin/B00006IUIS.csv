1777382,5,B00006IUIS,"Paramount Pictures present ""PRIDE OF THE WEST"" (1938)  (56 mins/B&W) --- our story has Hoppy, George ""Gabby"" Hayes and Russell Hayden who must deal with Kenneth Harlan and James Craig who are the nastiest villains on the Paramount Picture lot ... watch Glenn Strange as one of the henchmen, he delivers one of his best B-Western characters performances ... Sheriff Earle Hodgins is under pressure to bring in the stage robbers by the locals ... what trap can Hoppy spring on the leaders of the gang and put them behind bars.

The most outstanding series of westerns began in 1935 from Paramount Pictures ""Hopalong Cassidy"", under the guiding hand of producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman...continued well into the '40s proved to be the most successful 'B' Westerns ever made...based on Clarence E. Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential...the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word...the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension-building music.

In all, Boyd made sixty-six Hopalong Cassidy Westerns, early films included Uncle Ben and Windy Halliday, both played by veteran actor George ""Gabby"" Hayes...was a steady favorite as a hitchrack, was chosen five years in succession as one of the 10 best money-making Western sidekick stars...like most western comics, had his share of narrow escapes being thrown from his horse, burned by blanks...but that was all in a days work...his one-liners will never be forgotten...""You're dern tootin'""...""Never trust a female, they're pure poyzin""...or my all-time favorite ~ ""Persnickgordy Women""...this crusty old-timer stole many a scene from John Wayne, Randolph Scott and yes even William Boyd.

William Lawrence Boyd, known as Hop-A-Long Cassidy never wears any outfit except his charactertistic black shirt, trousers, boots and Stetson...Hoppy rode, grinned and fought his way into our hearts on the silver screen and then right into our living rooms with a new inventions called...Television! ... Great Cast of Jimmy Ellison (Johnny Nelson) always hot-headed & getting into trouble...but the scene stealer is George ""Gabby"" Hayes, as the old-timer Uncle Ben, gives the a film shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, as the father figure to Hoppy the interaction with Boyd's character is pure Americana!

Must mention that it was sure good to see one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks George ""Gabby"" Hayes throw in with Hoppy ... The added special features are simply great ~ Coming Attractions:""Hopalong Cassidy:Public Hero #1"", plus a poster gallery, still gallery and my favorite is original materials from ""Merchandising King of the Cowboys"" museum exhibit. Hope ""Image Entertainment"" will keep releasing this outstanding series featuring Hopalong Cassidy in glorious black & white. I'll be standing in line for the next adventure with the Bar-20 wranglers ... William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), they'll never be another like him.

Hoppy's interaction with California Carlson (Andy Clyde) is always a shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana! Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since...your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment ... Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play...outstanding role model...gotta love it!

Another pick for ""Pop"" Sherman was a new sidekick for the Cassidy films ... a newcomer Lucky Jenkins, played by Russell Hayden had his job cut out for him, with Boyd (as the hero) and Andy Clyde (California Carlson) for comedy, left the field of romance and action wide open, Hayden filled those ""boots"" perfectly.

William Boyd was my hero, this collection of his films are perfect, clear and give me hope for the future. Our youth should have such a hero to look up to today. Must mention the fact that I still miss one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks though, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, you're durn tootin'!

Our story line and plot, California (Andy Clyde) often got in trouble to draw Hoppy (William Boyd) into action. This time he cannot take the blame for any of Hoppy's troubles. In one humorous scene he reveals that he does not know his own age --- The relationship of Hoppy and his pals was one of unquestioned loyalty always looking out for his friends --- In Silent Conflict nearly all of his dialogue with Lucky (Rand Brooks) is downright mean --- Hoppy usually showed some kind of care for Lucky when he had to correct him, but this time he uses ""tough love."" --- Hopalong Cassidy, Lucky Jenkins and California Carlson head home from a cattle drive they lose the money they collected to pay all the cattle ranchers --- Hoppy has a hard time finding out who took the money and what has happened to his friend, Lucky --- A feeling of hopelessness hangs over most of this oater --- An unusual plot and the strong presence of Doc Richards (Earle Hodgins) make Silent Conflict stand out --- With Earle Hodgins in the cast his role as Doc Richards in Silent Conflict was better than normal --- Not only is he the villain, he does not need any henchmen to help him do his dirty work --- Hodgins was magnificent in this film --- This may even be his best role in a movie because he gets so much time on screen --- But never fear Hoppy is on his trail and the ending is priceless --- Like most of the ""Hopalong Cassidy"" Westerns, Silent Conflict was partially filmed on location at Lone Pine

7969493,4,B00006IUIS,"This is a particularly good quality release from MIRACLE PICTURES.

Both films have a 2002 digital remastering claim superimposed at bottom of the main title. It's a claim with much truth to it. There is nowhere to be seen on either hour-length movie such distractions as scratch lines, snow, fading or washout, also not a single edit break.

The image isn't as razor sharp as a studio release, but it looks darn good on a 27"" tube TV. The only limitation is some blurring in rapid horizontal movement. For example, the background when the camera is fixed on galloping horses isn't as precise as with an analog dub, but again it's acceptable.

Audio is strong and not dulled by heavy filtering, yet there's no hiss, pops or film rumble.

I'm very happy with this double feature, impressed in fact! Definitely recommended.",1298937600,,821,4.801418439716312

7969495,5,B00006IUIS,"Based on all of the comments above, I placed an order for this DVD box set. This now completes my ENTIRE COLLECTION of Hopalong Cassidy movies on DVD. I have the 2nd box set of the TV series, but not the first box yet.

Hoppy was the best of the movie cowboys, but a very close second was Buck Jones, someone who you seldom see available on DVD, except the ""Rough Riders"" series.

Wish there were some Jimmy Wakely (I met him and spent an afternoon with him), ""Wild"" Bill Elliott, Sunset Carson, Rex Allen, Monte Hale, Allan ""Rocky"" Lane, ""Lash"" LaRue, the rest of the Randolph Scott's & Bomba the Jungle Boy movies out on DVD. The audience who remembers all of these great stars is dwindling by the day. Come on studios, preserve these popular stars!

Amazon should do a better job with information on this, and a few other items I've seen in their collection.  They have no photo of the cover of this important box set, and no titles or information about what they are selling.  How do they expect to sell something they don't even tell you what is in it?

Thank you again Keith & Warren for doing the work Amazon.com should be doing.  It was only because of your great informative reviews I was able to know what was in this box set and realize they were the exact movies I needed that were not on any other DVD or box set to complete my collection.",1214697600,13,1352,4.320158102766799
