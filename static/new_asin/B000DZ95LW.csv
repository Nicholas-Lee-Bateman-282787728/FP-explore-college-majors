2475744,2,B000DZ95LW,"I like Alonzo and think he is witty and funny; however, this DVD just didn't bring out the funny material I'm used to hearing.  I laughed at his clips on youtube...I didn't laugh once while watching this DVD.  Save your money and just watch his clips on youtube.",1250035200,,262,4.4375
2475745,5,B000DZ95LW,Alonzo is one of my favorite comedians.  I saw him in concert and he was awesome!  This DVD captures his essence!,1249344000,,113,4.333333333333333
2475746,5,B000DZ95LW,"""Tall, Dark, and Funny"" is a must-have for anyone who appreciates humor with an edge.  Alonzo Bodden is an eloquent and insightful comic who delivers his stand-up act in a dry but good-natured manner.  He is proof positive of the fact that funny equals sexy.",1223942400,,258,4.711111111111111
2475747,4,B000DZ95LW,Enjoyed the show. It's hard to make my husband and I laugh out loud and Alonzo was able to several times.  Definitely a keeper!,1184198400,,127,4.291666666666667
2475748,5,B000DZ95LW,"This guy is the funniest comic I've seen in a loooooooong time - and the fact that he's drop-dead gorgeous doesn't hurt, either.

His brain picks up stuff and throws it back out in such a funny way, I bought extra DVDs and sent them to all my friends.

I recommend this DVD to anyone with a funnybone.",1171843200,,301,4.172413793103448
2475749,5,B000DZ95LW,This guy has very original material in his stand up comedy. You will laugh non stop for an hour.,1151798400,,96,4.105263157894737
2475750,5,B000DZ95LW,"I recently saw Alonzo Bodden on The Tonight Show, and thought he was really funny, so looked him up on Amazon.com and ordered this dvd, which was mentioned on the Tonight Show as just having been released.  I highly recommend this DVD, ""Tall, Dark and Funny"" to Everyone, no matter what your ethnic background. He is not overly fouled mouthed, which personally, I like. I don't think anyone will be disappointed with ""Tall, Dark & Funny,"" which Alonzo Bodden definitely is!",1148688000,5,473,4.839506172839506
