The medical professionals, with opposing views, that were interviewed for the program were not included in the final cut.  Alas even PBS is on the tit of the pharmaceutical industry.",1501459200,3,301,4.98

P.S. - All Frontline programs are available for free online, including this one. There is a Wikipedia page (""List of Frontline (PBS) episodes"") with links to and brief descriptions of each.",1342310400,12,689,5.689320388349515
