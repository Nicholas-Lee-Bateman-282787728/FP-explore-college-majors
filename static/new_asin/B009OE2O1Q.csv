5359222,5,B009OE2O1Q,"Finally received this item, but I thought I would update my review.  Hope this helps!

First of all, it's been a long wait.  But we're getting closer to the full series being completely available on DVD.  Thank you TGG Direct!  The only problem is that the episodes are slightly out of order.  The fact that the episodes are out of order by no means detracts from the fact that Season 3 is FINALLY on DVD.  But, it might help to watch them in order for continuity (especially if you're an Ike fan or if you are a Kid and Lou shipper - last disc in particular).  I've included a list of how the episodes originally aired on ABC.  Enjoy!

1. A  House Divided
2. Jesse
3. Blood of Others
4. Between Rock Creek and a Hard Place
5. In the Presence of Mine Enemies (Ike!)
6. Survivors
7. The Initiation
8. Just like Old Times
9. Spirits
10. A Tiger's Tale
11. Goodnight, Sweet Charlotte
12. Song of Isaiah
13. Spies
14. Shadowmen

Who knew delivering the mail could be so important?! But it truly was an important - albeit, short - part of US Frontier History.  Can't wait for both Complete Seasons 2 & 3 to finally come out.  It's about time!  Even though I think Seasons 1 & 2 were the strongest, I'm just glad this great series is finally going to be completely released on DVD.  Besides the fun of it being a Western and seeing numerous stars in their younger days, the scenery was beautiful.  Old Tucson and Mescal made a wonderful backdrop for the series.  Let's hope the set does the series justice.  Thank you in advance TGG Direct for listening to the fans and getting the whole series out on DVD!",1350950400,28,1787,4.280597014925373

5359247,2,B009OE2O1Q,"I was so happy to finally get these on DVD that I was hoping the reviews were from older sets and that the problems would be fixed by now. At first, I believed that there was an issue with Manufacture On Demand, but my set is from a different retailer and not DVD-R. There must be a problem with the masters. And the artwork lists all episodes, in aired order, so I think this was designed in spec before the masters were actually compiled.

I can understand the episodes missing from Season 2 because of musical rights, but this season is a complete mess. I'm missing 3 episodes, and 3 others are duplicated, just as others have reported. Luckily, the entire series is playing on Encore Westerns, and is also available in the Starz app if you have broadband. So, at least there's hope in finding the 9 total missing episodes in the series.",1492128000,,840,4.454545454545454

However I do not like the stacking of the movies. I would prefer they be separate in the cover and not stacked one on the other. By doing this you have to remove every movie to get to the last disk, do not like that. But everything else is fine.",1455667200,3,399,4.128205128205129

5359424,5,B009OE2O1Q,"This show is from the late 80s. Most of the main actors are in their 20s. The series has good story lines and some good action. Maybe for some is the focus on the friendships,that is appealing. I did not watch it in the 80s,this was my first time. I lend my DVDs to friends,one who is professional gambler gives it 5 stars. I find it very entertaining. It is not loaded with many subplots like many of the 2015 shows. Also the pace is quicker than the popular westerns of the 60s & 70s.",1430438400,,486,4.126315789473685

I just got my set and checked to see if the episodes The Blood of Others, Between Rock Creek and a Hard Place, and Shadowmen were all present on my set. They are all present. Hopefully, the rest of the episodes are all present and accounted for as well.

Edit 4/16/16: I finally watched this whole set. My set has all the episodes. So, if you get a set with missing episodes, complain and do an exchange because I can attest to the fact that Amazon does have discs with all the correct episodes.",1426809600,7,546,4.25
5359431,5,B009OE2O1Q,"This is an excellent series.  A must see.  I watched this years ago when it first came out.  Found out it was on DVD, so bought the whole series.  Well worth the money. I never saw the entire series when it was on Television.  The only problem is that in the Third Season DVD collection, that there are four episodes that are missing.  The four are listed on the box but are missing on the DVD's.  The DVD's actually have the total number of episodes listed, but four of them are repeated.  The four missing is listed on another review and this person states that they contacted the manufacturer but are unable to get the missing four episodes.  I still found the series worth it as it is a very good program.  It's too bad it was cancelled way back when they were filming it.  My kids love it, they can't understand why such a show would be cancelled.  Definitely good quality DVD's, good price.  Just the fact of the four missing episodes.",1426723200,2,941,4.369942196531792

5359522,5,B009OE2O1Q,"From Season one review: I still enjoy this show even if it is a little cheesy. It's not Walker Texas Ranger goofy but it's very ""expected."" It is a western so there is shooting but nothing so violent that I can't share it with my niece and nephew (9-7 years). Because it's a western, you can't tell that it's over 20 years old. The only problem with the box set is some episodes are missing. I believe it's due to licensing issues. If you aren't familiar with the show, it makes for choppy plot lines going from Season 1 to 2. I also noticed the order of the episodes played in a different order from what was listed on the box. Seems like they had an amateur proof these. But otherwise it's a solid set. I purchased Seasons 1-3 and I'm very happy with all. Kind of wish the show ran longer.

As a side note, the characters based on historical figures has inspired my young nephew to read more books on Wild Bill, William F. Cody, the Pony Express and life in the west. Can't complain about a show that inspires reading and education!",1410393600,3,1034,4.302564102564102
5359523,2,B009OE2O1Q,"first to the other reviewers. This section is to rate the quality and entertainment level of Young Riders season 3. Not to vent your frustration that 3 came out before 2 or that the series was on back order.

I give this release 2 stars. First because I enjoy the series but as others have reported the packaging typically has loose disk inside, I also found this to be the case. I'm watching the first episode and it looks like it was recorded on a cheap vcr tape from a broadcast to a tv with rabbit ears.

After several good experiences finding things I didn't expect to find, I searched for the series and was delighted to find Amazon carried it.  There were several options listed.

5359555,3,B009OE2O1Q,"I suppose the past always seems better because memory fades... . I remember this series from my youth and I loved the episodes. Unfortunately, the reality is that a lot of it is over-acted, the shoot-out scenes specifically. It seems to be the same formula - bad guys threaten one of the riders or someone they care about, relevant rider gets into trouble, all the riders combine forces to overcome. Fairly boring, certainly not the riveting episodes I remember. I think it is best to leave the past in the past and remember the goods bits as being great!",1399852800,,555,4.616161616161616
5359556,3,B009OE2O1Q,"I love this show and am happy to see it released, but I am greatly disappointed in how badly it was done. The packaging is so shoddy that discs arrive rattling around inside and scratched, so I'm watching the worst of them now to see if they're watchable or if I need to return them. This has proven true of both Seasons 1 and 3 (I bought Season 2 elsewhere and did not have that problem, but maybe they were shipped a different version with better packaging). The picture is the same grainy version that was on television back then, with no effort made to clean it up or add subtitles, and the different aspect ratio to today's televisions is also glaringly obvious.

Seems MGM and FOX treated this like a hated step-child that could bring them in some money because they knew people would buy it regardless of the quality. Season 2 is certainly not ""complete"" as due to not being able to get copyright permissions for some of the music there are missing episodes including one of my favorites, ""Bad Company."" I'd have been happier if they had left out the music and included the episodes to make it more complete and noted it on the box (Season 2 is the only one that does not read ""Complete Season"" on the box but it does not tell you which episodes are missing).",1398556800,2,1266,4.410256410256411

The only problem with season 3 is that what is on the disc is not what is shown on the outside cover (i.e. disc 1 has one of disc 3; disc 2 is 3 of disc 3, etc.).

5359596,5,B009OE2O1Q,"I don't often feel the need to write reviews on items... but I really felt this one deserved it.

First off... the series is fantastic! One of my all time favs! When you can sit down, and watch something you haven't seen since it premiered on TV nearly 20 yrs ago... THAT is the mark of an enduring classic! Compelling stories... intriguing and dynamic characters who are NOT cookie-cutter Western stereotypes... and a fantastic soundtrack!? You can't ask for much more!

HOWEVER... What WERE they THINKING when they designed the packaging!?

A. A photo of the cast from Season 1!? REALLY!? *sigh*

B. HATE the ""DVD Spool Case"" idea. DVDs are piled one on top of the other... which means you have remove Discs 1 & 2 to get at Disc 3... annoying! And I know that at least in my case... Discs 1 & 2 came loose in shipping... I'm still hoping they aren't scratched... >.< And finally...

C. They gave new meaning to ""Box set"". Yup! These DVDs are in typical DVD plastic cases...which are then nestled in a.... Greeting card typing box!!! *head desk*

If the company who managed to secure the DVD rights to this series had shifted their focus from giving consumers useless (and highly disposable) outer packaging... they could have used those funds to give us discs nestled in their own docks, in a flip case rather than piled on top of one another...

I have some CRAZILY packaged box sets (I'm looking at you Highlander series!) but this one... is highly obnoxious!!!

(Of course... this should in no way deter you from ordering the complete season 3! haha! We have to convince this company that they need to go back and release the COMPLETE SEASON TWO!!!!! We need ALL of our Episodes!!!!)",1391817600,,1688,4.622073578595318

5359609,2,B009OE2O1Q,"When I started watching this, I checked online for the episode summaries and realized the episodes are completely out of order on the discs.  If you want to watch the season in order, you will need to look for the order on-line and it will mean taking discs out and putting others in several times to watch them in order.  Who created this?  It does not seem like the series creators had anything to do with it.

Also, I need to send this back and get a replacement because several of the discs don't play at all. I am crossing my fingers that the replacement discs work better!",1390089600,2,578,4.324074074074074

I bought the 1st season and 3rd season and completely fell in love with the show all over again. it is chalked full of good moral, friendship, love, coming-of-age, mistake/consequences, and most of all forgiviness.

5359686,5,B009OE2O1Q,"While it isn't entirely true to the reality of the product, I gave this a full 5 stars because just having the complete first and third season available on DVD is fantastic, It's been a long time in coming and I can't wait for season 2 to finally make it to DVD.

The discs all play well, images are sharp enough, considering it was analog, film mastered and not digital. Sound is excellent, and I've had very few incidences of pixelation or hang with the DVDs. I kind of like the ""chocolate box"" packaging, even though it isn't standard. I don't love the front to back disc storage inside, but used carefully it should be okay.

However, what would have lowered my rating on the set if I wasn't so gosh durned thrilled it's finally available on DVD, is that TGG could have used a bit more care in putting this together. I need to write them directly on these issues, as I hope they do better on re-presses and season 2, when it's finally ready to press.

The three things that you need to be aware of with this set are:

1. Episodes are out of order on the discs, so go to iMDB and renumber the episodes on the disc box covers. You can pull out the insert and write it on the actual cover. For example, Disc 1 Set 1 actually contains episodes 1, 2, 5 and 9 (in that order).  This is annoying with the continuing story lines TYR was known for.

2. The navigation on the discs is dicey. It wants to go out of order yet AGAIN because it moves across, not up and down first, when you try using the remote control buttons. SO you have to have the correct order by disc and by episode name in front of you if you're la stickler for continuity in a series, as I am.

3. The cast list if totally incorrect on the packaging! They used the TYR season 1 cast list on the season 3 box, even though Brett Cullen and Melissa Leo aren't in these episodes, and they didn't add Don Franklin and Christopher Pettite who ARE in season 3. You really are buying season 3, it just looks like the season 1 discs, because the actors list is from season 1.

So over all, I think it's great that TGG came through with the release and I love having TYR seasons 1 & 3 on DVD to watch whenever I want. I am already planning on buying a second set of season 1 and 3, after SEASON 2 comes out. But for die hard fans that want continuity in watching this series set, do some extra work and renumber the episodes before you begin watching the discs, so you aren't all mixed up in your viewing.",1363305600,20,2461,4.166315789473685
5359687,1,B009OE2O1Q,What is going on that the DVD isn't avail now?? We have been waiting for this for how long and now I can't even order it?! Its been a month... Any idea when I will be able to order these DVDS.,1361664000,,192,3.707317073170732
5359698,4,B009OE2O1Q,"I first noticed Season 3 was coming out, I think, before Christmas- but the delivery date kept being pushed back. I finally ordered it in January- and got hit by a shipping delay- but now it's finally in my hands. The set comes on 5 discs (Amazon still lists it as 1) placed in two ordinary sized DVD cases- these are placed in a box with a lid on it, I've never seen a DVD box like this one.

I have the original release edition of Season 1,  almost exactly the same cover photo is used for this set instead of an appropriate Season 3 image (the background, though, is Monument Valley Utah!), and is also used on the DVD cases (original Season 1 had individual case pictures- 3 cases- and individual cast pictures on each DVD). No production information of any sort on the DVD cases.

A couple of others have posted that the set is presented in ""production"" order rather than ""broadcast"" order- I have no idea about that but I do think the image quality is pretty good (I've only watched the two part series finale). The color is probably about like the original broadcast and the image clarity is, I think,  just a ""tiny"" bit less than my copy of Season 1. The sound level is actually ""loud"" for a DVD, I had to turn my TV set down lower than I usually do- DVD's are usually the other way around, I've found. You want closed captioning ?-  you're out of luck (the original Season 1 was CC). The feature I miss the most on this release is that episodes aren't divided by chapters, click ""next"" on your remote and instead of jumping forward a bit in that episode you'll find yourself looking at the DVD menu (again a loss from the first release).

I'll buy Second season too, especially if it gets those little improvements- and someone gets around to releasing it.",1361318400,,1765,4.382262996941896
5359699,5,B009OE2O1Q,"This was a great Western Series. Unfortunately it was cut short. It seems all the good programs end way to early. For some reason the powers that be have refused to release this series in its entirety. You can now purchase Season one and Season Three.

 Purhaps we will eventually see Season 2.

Supplies of this series seems to be short.

Its time for producers of DVD's to wake up.

If you get tired of waiting for series you might enjoy watch, "" Wind At My Back "" produced by Sullivan. Its another series that was cut short, but good until that point.

Hope this review gives you a little help.",1360454400,,597,4.333333333333333
5359700,4,B009OE2O1Q,"Got the DVDs today. Aside from the lack of any real artwork and using a stock photo from Season 1 for Season 3 (so no Don Franklin), the set is good.

5359702,1,B009OE2O1Q,What is going on with The Young Riders Season 3??? It was supposed to be sent out today after the first delay. Now its showing not availabe at this time. The worst part is there is a want for this video along with the 2nd season and the fans are getting the bad end of the deal. Very very fustrating.,1359417600,,300,4.016666666666667
5359703,4,B009OE2O1Q,"This show was very popular with an extremely loyal fan base while airing.  It was once rated the most highly anticipated DVD release of any TV show.  There was a delay with the release of season two over distribution rights, but luckily that has been resolved and we have all three seasons now.

THE STORY: Set just before the American Civil War, this series presented a highly fictionalized account of the heyday of the Pony Express. Its focus was a group of young Express riders based at the waystation in Sweetwater, Kansas. Running the station was ex-Texas Ranger and all-around eccentric Teaspoon Hunter. The role of cook, housekeeper and mother hen was filled first by Emma and later by Rachel. The riders included the future ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody and James Butler (""Wild Bill"") Hickok, as well as Ike, a mute, Buck, a half-White/half-Kiowa scout and the Kid, a quiet Southerner. Their final member was Lou, a young woman who lived and worked with the riders disguised as a boy. In second season, their group was joined by Noah Dixon.

PACKAGING:  The set includes five discs in two regular sized DVD cases and housed in a sort of collector's box snugly fitting the two standard DVD cases.",1359244800,39,1193,4.771844660194175
5359704,2,B009OE2O1Q,I have season one and it consists of six discs. How is there only one disc in this set? Season three was just as long as season one................................So I finally ordered this. I had to order from another seller through amazon because on the release date it was suddenly out of stock. I waited a bit too long if you ask me to receive my package. Opened it to see a cover picture from season one when the actors are younger and there is no Don Franklin. I opened it up to find that there are suppose to be five discs (its listed that there is only one disc in this set). Disc 4 was not in the box. What a disappointment! So Ive had to send it back and now am waiting for a new copy. Hope I get reimbursed for my part shipping it back.,1358985600,2,746,4.081632653061225

5359706,1,B009OE2O1Q,"This is an awesome series. The release of the seasons are really crazy. I also have season one and it is excellent, though there were not many people interested in this first year when it first premiered on TV. The second season saw huge ratings. Instead of releasing the second season, they are offering season three first. Is this so that when they do release season two they can charge outlandish prices??? Why would they not release this series in numerical order? It just does not make sense unless they really are creating a market for the second season. After all, anyone who bought both seasons 1 & 3 will want season 2. It has been a long time and it is about time the other two seasons finally get released. Season 3 was supposed to be available Nov 8th and now not again until Jan 29, 2013!! Netflix offers them, so why can't we as consumers get them? I am very disappointed at this whole issue with regards to this TV Series.",1356134400,,937,4.421965317919075

Sound is mixed well with a Dolby

Compliments the action on-screen.
