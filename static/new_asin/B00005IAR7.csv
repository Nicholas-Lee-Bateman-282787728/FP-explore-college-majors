1425624,4,B00005IAR7,"Most of the reviewers have totally missed the point.  If you read the ""Left Behind"" books, or watched the ""Tribulation"" series movies, you saw that the believers leave a video to tell those left behind where they have gone, what is going to happen in the tribulation, and how to receive Christ as their Savior.  This DVD is similar to those videos.  So, it is not really a movie in the traditional sense, it is a movie for believers to purchase to leave as a message.  It doesn't really have a plot line, a hero and heroine going through trials and tribulations, etc.  However, if you are a Christian you should ask yourself, if the rapture happens, would I want my loved ones to know what happened to me, how to join me, and what to make of the Anti Christ?  If so, this is for you.",1046822400,33,783,4.292517006802721

PASTOR JOHN HAGEE COMES IN AND OUT OF THE SCENES TO EXPLAIN SOME OF THE GOING ONS, WHICH I FOUND A LITTLE DISTRACTING. I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE SHOW AND THEN TALK. I DID APPRECIATE WHAT HE HAD TO SAY AND I BELIEVE IT.",1367971200,,729,4.140845070422535

1425681,5,B00005IAR7,"well as i have seen it before this is a very good video we are now closer to his coming then ever in recent years and for example if we go to sleep now tonight the rapture can hit without anyone sleeping waking up in the morning or if it hits in the daytime no one will even know it.. it will be sudden and very quick and the world i would be ready if i were you yet we all do make mistakes but we need to talk to god more often he listens and he hears us and will keep us safe if we trust him this video is a must for all to see this and be ready when it strikes the triubulation is gonna be very horrible terrifying as never seen by anyone else, our friends who used to know us will be enemies to us they will be changed when they have the mark on the right hand or foreheadthey will be evil and will speak evil to us so yes we need to be ready so we can leave and miss this don't be left behind repent of your sins now to god let him into your heart tonight so you can be with those in heaven who died before us and be all together again that is what you want not the evil thing.... may the lord guide you and tug at your heart tonight god bless you alway",1342137600,5,1158,3.7113821138211383
1425682,5,B00005IAR7,"This is a great movie to watch and several times during this film, Pastor John Hagee is right there on scene to actually describe what is happening and what will happen.  When the rapture happens and people just disappear, all hell will break loose all around the world.  YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS THE RAPTURE!!!",1334016000,,310,4.517857142857143
1425683,4,B00005IAR7,"I found ""Vanished"" to be excellent. It is Biblically-sound and Pastor John Hagee does well to back up the events with Scripture throughout the movie. It reminds me that this is not simply a sensational, fictitious story, but one that the Bible is trying to prepare us for. It clarified the sequence of events for me. Often, people have heard about ""Rapture"", ""Anti-Christ"", ""Great Tribulation"", ""the 144,000"" and so on, but put the sequence of events into a ""too-hard-basket"". John Hagee summarised all this up beautifully and so logically. It would certainly wake up the ""sleepy Christian"".",1315180800,10,591,5.103092783505154
1425684,1,B00005IAR7,"This isn't really a movie. It's a short subject on the conjuncture of ""The Rapture"" which term, by the way, does not exist in the Bible. Not that I don't believe in the Second Coming, but there is nothing triumphant or glorious about this short film and I saw no clouds of glory to which I'd desire to be caught up. There are better and much more compelling tales on the subject to be found elsewhere. Search them out. Better yet, search the Scriptures.",1275004800,2,453,4.404761904761905

1425686,5,B00005IAR7,This movie is a great way to bring others to Jesus. It's an Oldie but goodie.,1239062400,,77,3.875
1425687,5,B00005IAR7,"[In this stunning prophetic docu-drama Pastor John Hagee whisks you into the near future, into a world spinning wildly out of control.] As the editorial review stated it is a docu-drama and it is John Hagee's way of explaining to us the Great Tribulation for those Left Behind.

[As the prophetic events unfold-the rapture, the rise of the anti-christ, the deception, the persecution of new believers-Pastor Hagee is right there to explain exactly what the Word of God teaches about them.] That is why John Hagee is right there to explain each point of what happened! He is explaining what the the Word of God has to say in regards to the prophetic events in regards to the Rapture and to explain to those who have been left behind. I admired John Hagee's preaching he does it with ""Fire and Brimstone!"" You can feel it comes from his heart.

I agree with the previous poster Kiltmaker (Maryland) --  However, if you are a Christian you should ask yourself, if the rapture happens, would I want my loved ones to know what happened to me, how to join me, and what to make of the Anti Christ? If so, this is for you.",1197590400,,1114,4.5049504950495045
1425688,1,B00005IAR7,"I have watched all of Cloud Ten's end time movies. While none of them were stellar, this one was abysmal. It seemed like it was John Hagee's effort to showcase himself, more than anything else, by calling it a documentary. It was a bottom dweller when it came to production values, using recycled clips from Apocolypse more than new footage. It completely lacked both plot and character development. If it was to be a documentary, then it should have had some scripture to it. If Hagee's preaching is as lean on scripture as this film is, then I think I will skip ever watching that the same as I advise skipping this waste-of-time. There are plenty of halfway decent films out there for sharing with friends about the end times, but this one is totally worthless.",1133740800,12,764,4.625
1425689,1,B00005IAR7,"Another reviewer said some people missed the point of this movie... Well I didn't miss the point.
The point of this movie is not to be a fictional movie but some sort of instruction video for those who are left behind after the rapture that some Christians believe is coming.
The fictional elements of the movie are interrupted by scenes where Pastor John Hagee declares that this, in fact, will happen, becaus the bible tells us it will, and when it does, you better be a Christian and be saved, and don't trust the evil European politician that will become some kind of world president and say he's the Messiah, because he's really the Anti-Christ.
I wouldn't recommend anyone to see this movie, and certainly not to spend their money on it. If you think you need an instruction video about what to do when the end is near and that the televangelists who made this movie needs more money than they already have - go ahead and buy it, but don't say I didn't warn you.",1088467200,7,968,4.47457627118644

So I ordered this one, and this seller sent it promptly, which I appreciated! It's only a fair Rapture depiction, not as good as others I've seen, but Pastor Hagee's inserted comments between scenes are very good and make it an important video in my view. I will share this with people I know. Fairly well done but Hagee's parts are exceptional.",1493683200,,487,4.48314606741573
