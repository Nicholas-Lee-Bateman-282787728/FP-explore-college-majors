4263140,4,6303451152,"Quite nice. I was particularly impressed by the character of the ""evil"" magician, who finally had a change in heart. In a world marred by corruption and violence, we are so used to labeling good vs. evil as two rigid ends of a continuum as opposed to even the possibility of change, and a ""second chance"" in life. My nine-year old was convinced till the end of the movie that the magician was wicked and he was using the ""change of heart"" as an alibi to do more harm. The movie hopefully instilled some much-needed element of ""trust"" in him towards people. He was happy at the end of the movie and ""content"", which I believe speaks a lot about what the movie wanted to portray - a ""feel good"" approach towards life.",1428278400,,715,4.383458646616542
