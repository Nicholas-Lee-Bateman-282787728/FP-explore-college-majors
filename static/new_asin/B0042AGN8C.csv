8413321,5,B0042AGN8C,A Must see~ ! I loved this film and Actor Benjamin Ciaramello. He is wonderful to look at and would be even better to hold.,1401667200,,123,3.96
8413322,1,B0042AGN8C,"Amazon should pay their customers a rebate for watching this movie. The script, acting and blatant use of profanity and pathetic ploy of mentally ill characters is unbearable. I didn't finish it but would not give up until I found out how to give a few words to save other customers. William Defoe must have just given up his acting career with this movie.",1344211200,2,356,4.578125
