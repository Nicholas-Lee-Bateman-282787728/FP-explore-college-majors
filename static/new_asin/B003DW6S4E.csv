8394998,5,B003DW6S4E,Tracie Long is an exceptional instructor and this workout is good and tough!  Lots of step with a short ab segment at the end.  I felt great after completing it!  Not too dance oriented for the choreography challenged.  Just a good basic step workout!,1485388800,,251,4.636363636363637
8394999,4,B003DW6S4E,"I am a fan of step aerobic classes, but I have trouble finding videos that don't have overly-dancey and hard to learn moves.  The steps were easy to learn but the movements varied enough to keep the routine from getting boring.  Be prepared to sweat a ton!",1385683200,3,256,4.425531914893617
