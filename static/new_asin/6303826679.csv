7856325,4,6303826679,"I bought this for my three kids, ages 8, 7 and 4, to help reinforce good manners with others.  The first time I turned it on, they got bored within 5 minutes and left the room.  I personally found the host a bit cheesy and annoying.  Anyways, I threw the tape on the shelf, where it collected dust for a while.  Then one day, one of my kids proactively put it in the VCR and they all watched it from beginning to end, and it suddenly became one of their favorite videotapes.  Go figure!  After watching the video every day for a few weeks, my kids have learned some really good manners!  In particular, I've been working on my oldest son's phone manners for quite a while, to no avail. But since watching this video, his phone manners have improved to a point where callers are complimenting me on them.  So, I highly recommend this video, if you can get your kids to actually watch it.",1116288000,2,886,4.295180722891566
