952758,5,6305020841,"While ABT was really good it cant compare to this. This movie is ten times better then the original. Chow Yun-Fat gets to be cooler then he did in the original. now more hobling around on his  leg. He gets to show his coolness. The story here was also a lot better. People say its slow but i disagree. its always entertaining due to WOo's awesome direction. He has a true eye for visuals. All the actors due expert turns. Also the action here is 1000 times better then what was in ABT one is quality but probably not quantity. And the ending. I know others have said stuff but i need to contribute. The ending is one of the top 10 gunfights ever put to film. the three main chracters take uzis, .45's, grenades, shotguns and strangely, a samuri sword, go to the mobsters mansion , and kill about 50 people while themselves being filled with holes. THe bad guys get whats coming to them. Also included is a ruthless hitman w/ out one word of dialouge. I love it when Chow and the Hitman bump into each other and start shooting..classic. Overall this is Woo's first GREAT film and not to be missed.",984960000,,1096,4.3463414634146345
952759,5,6305020841,"I think this is the only sequal to a movie that is better than the first. Don't get me wrong, a better tomorrow was a great film. But this sequal is a much more action packed emotional masterpeice. (If you can belive it?) It is unfortunate that some for whatever reason do not grasp or realize the power and excellence of this film. Being a former (note: REFORMED) drug dealer/buisness man, there were a few scene's which were riviting. The first (im not going to spoil it!) being when uncle lung calls his enemy's who think he's dead, and proceeds to calmly tell them he is in town, and is fine. And sublimily stating I am going to come over there and take care of all of you for selling me out. And the other being the shoot out between chow yun fat and the sunglass wearing hitman. This was truly the greatest gun fight in movie history. John Wayne could take a lesson from that. Enough about the movie, now the DVD: I am used to a grainly bootleg VHS of this movie. This DVD is an outstanding high quality version of this great film. If you like this movie or are a chow yun fat/john woo fan, then its a must hae. One note, in order to see this film in it's pure state, do not watch it with english dubbing. Use the sub titles. The english dubbing is often corny and desicrates the entire film. Finally this great film is on DVD, viewed in my opinion as John Woo's 3rd greatest film (Killer #1, Hardboiled #2,) it will not leave you disapointed. Unless you are over demanding, and exspect every DVD to have every little perk and a chow  yun fat video game in it.",980467200,3,1566,4.25503355704698
952760,3,6305020841,"This movie is the best of the ""Better Tomorrow"" trilogy and one of John Woo's best Hong Kong releases after ""Hard Boiled"" and ""The Killer"". It takes off right after ""A Better  Tomorrow"" with Chow Yun Fat returning as Mark's twin brother Ken. It  starts off a little slow, but it's essential to character development  (which most action films of this genre lack). The ending has one of the  best and bloodiest shootout sequences in the series. Some of the scenes in  this end sequence you may remeber being shown in Tarentino's ""True  Romance"".
The two stars keeping this movie from getting a five star  rating was due to the quality of the DVD. Although the packaging of the DVD  was nice, the booklet inside was merely an advertisement and had no  information for this movie. To my disappointment there was NO EXTRA FOOTAGE  or BEHIND THE SCENES FOOTAGE as advertised and it left me feeling ripped  off. The DVD just merely contained actor's and director's files which  looked like it was taken directly from the IMDB ([...] The  subtitles were poorly translated with constant grammatical, spelling and  timing errors, which made most the dialogue confusing. The colors were  muted and in some of the dark scenes, what was supposed to be black turned  a bright blue - yuck!. The only real difference between the DVD and the VHS  version was the remastered Dolby Digital sound and widescreen letterboxed  aspect ratio (1.85:1).
The only reason that I didn't return this version  of the DVD is that the only other version is on VHS and it's $13 more than  the DVD. So if you are planning on purchasing this, I'd wait, there are  plans for a superior version to be released in the fall.",964051200,25,1684,4.679180887372014
952761,3,6305020841,"I was looking forward to the DVD version of this movie which purportedly boasted of dolby digital 5.1.  The quality of the audio was really inconsistent.  Dialogue became soft suddenly and sound effects were almost  non-existent. The effects from the shooting scenes were therefore  disappointing.  I had to strain to hear the dialogue at times.  To be fair,  I heard the Cantonese version.  I don't know how the Mandarin version will  fare.  Other than the inferior sound quality, this is a superb movie, as  good as part 1.  Chow YF returns as ""Ah Mark""'s twin brother who  runs a restaurant in the USA.  The cheekiness and the don't-care-less  attitude portrayed by Chow is unsurpassed.",953424000,,689,4.921052631578948

952852,4,6305020841,"The only things which stops me from rating this 5 stars are (warning minor spoilers below):

Once the story gets past these rough spots, the movie gets way more awesome...

The introduction of Chow Yun Fat's Character: Ken and the old trope of ""never before mentioned twin brother"".
1). The scene where Ken forces the protection racket mobster to eat the rice from his restaurant felt forced and unnatural and it really didn't fit well with the pacing and the rest of the movie. Chow Yun Fat did a great job with the crappy dialogue he was given for his character and he was the only one truly acting in that scene - but even if the other actors stepped up to their parts... it was still bad writing and pacing.

2). Twin brother. - It would have been better if Chow Yun Fat played the same character from the first movie and to provide an explanation of how that character survived: (like maybe he had a metal plate in his skull and the bullet slid around the plate and exited through the skin at the front of his head and he was in a coma)... bringing back the icon to the sequel was a brilliant move because it brought back his fans, but it could have been handled a bit better.

The rest of the movie was intense and overall it was highly enjoyable. I would give this 4.5 stars but half stars aren't supported.",1362614400,,1314,4.329268292682927

952855,4,6305020841,"One of Chou's and Woo's famous movies. It combined with romance and violence, along with some humorous. Although it is not best one compare to today's action movies, it was great back to old days. It is one of mile stone of Hong Kong action movies in late 80's and early 90's.",1306281600,,276,4.326923076923077
952856,4,6305020841,"This double pack is a must have for John Woo fans or anyone with a craving for foreign style action from the 80's. Yes it looks extremely dated and the dvd transfer is horrible but don't let that stop you from experiencing some graphically violent set pieces that at the time were unheard of in cinema. John Woo had an ability to make the violence look incredibly realistic, yet over the top and artistic at the same time. His direction at the time was innovative featuring slow motion shots that american directors would later copy and unfortunately become a cliche in movies. A Better Tomorrow's plot is much more cohesive than the sequel's but it features less action and violence. The story of the sequel is a mess though. I've read that the director John Woo and the producer had creative differences on the sequel so the plot is just all over the place. It really is a disaster story wise. The sequel however has an awesome, tension filled 15 minute finale. It's literally a non stop bloodbath. It's pretty violent for an 80's film and it holds up well today. I still show the finale of A Better Tomorrow II off to friends and even they are speechless when watching it. Although Woo's later films would look sharper and tighter(Hard Boiled, The Killer), A Better Tomorrow 1 and 2 are perfect introductions into what made Woo a great action director. It's kind of sad that his american films wouldn't contain the humor, stories, violence and energy of his hong kong films with the lone exception being Face-Off featuring John Travolta and Nicholas Cage.",1276992000,3,1558,4.689781021897811

952920,4,6305020841,"The price is right for this terrific set.  I rate these two film's equally because they flow together flawlessly as a satisfying epic.  The beauty of these film's are that they do not sacrifice characterization for the sake of pyrotechnics.  The connecting thread of the films is the complex relationship between two brothers, one an upright Hong Kong police detective(Leslie Cheung) and the other a criminal with principles(Ti Lung).  The one thing they share is a distaste for the more unsavory elements of the Hong Kong crime syndicate but part as to the method in which to bring them down.  The selling point of these film's is the presence of Chow Yun Fat who is essentially a supporting player in these films.  That said, whenever he appears on screen the wattage of his charisma lights up the screen as good as any actor on the world stage.  Both film's feature dynamite climactic showdowns as staged by John Woo that surpass anything concocted by Western filmmakers(send a thank you note, Quentin).  I would have rated these films five stars but I felt that some of the more melodramatic elements in the scripts bogged down the precedings.",1128124800,3,1147,4.846153846153846

If you love voilence as much as I do buy this movie.  The one I brought is not in english but it has subtitles. There is to parts where chow yun fat speakes in english in this movie.  I like when he take the shotgun and start blow the men all away. then he takes the pistols slides down the stairs shooting a man.  There are two good action scence but they last for 3o minutes.

Without a doubt this movie proves that John Woo is the best action director of all time, the vision, style, and the sher genious that he (Woo) uses in the direction of this movie is what sets it apart from and american action movie ever made.

952926,5,6305020841,"From the accounts I've read, A Better Tomorrow II was a reluctant endeavour on Woo's part to cash in on an extremely personal and extremely successful film (the first A Better Tomorrow) which had made his career and hadn't been intended as a franchise.  But a franchise it became, and the corny, nearly nonsensical plotting of this sequel (the comic-book artist is especially ludicrous -- it's the same guy who had been the counterfeit engineer in the first film!) is the result.
But where this film good-naturedly flubs on logic, it makes up for in spectacle and just pure entertainment.  Chow Yun-fat must have had a ball filming this, with his extended English monologue, almost godlike action choreography, and a mischievous character which taps into one of his most effective traits as an actor, a goofball sense of fun which makes his romantic moments all the more engrossing.  Ti Lung's character is somewhat passive this time though the actor does a good job.  Dean Shek's over-the-top portrayal of a mind unhinged isn't for all tastes, but his performance in the not-crazy scenes is tip-top, and Leslie Cheung had grown greatly as an actor since the first film.
In the end, this film is about an exaggerated staging of the trademark gunfights of A Better Tomorrow, and this sequel delivers on that front in grand style.  Once again Chow Yun-fat steals the whole show, dominating both key action sequences (the final demolition of the house and the New York battle against over-the-top slimy mafiosi).
The DVD transfer of this film is not all that great.  As with the first A Better Tomorrow DVD on Anchor Bay, the trailers are not that remarkable -- this DVD offers ""Hong Kong"" and ""American"" trailers, but the Hong Kong trailer has already been available on the pristine Criterion Collection edition of Hard Boiled, and the American trailer is pure trash.  There is no commentary, not surprisingly, but the most bothersome thing is that the picture transfer is really not that great.  Unbecoming scratches mar the picture, and I suspect it's on the master used by Anchor Bay, not a one-off on my DVD.
The film is still lots of fun to watch.  Turn off your logic circuit and indulge.",1051920000,7,2192,4.839572192513369

Fair enough. However, when playing English language with English subtitles, the spoken word and the written word are often so mismatched they have completely different meanings. My DVD showed a splice in the flim which ran diagonally for several frames, which is not a show stopper but just another indication of the poor DVD quality.
The Talent Bios on John Woo and Yun-Fat Chow are very enlightening. The film is a different story. The story line was often hard to follow because of such choppy scene changes. People just magically appeared, or the location would completely change, without any warning. Too many bad effects. The film was greatly disappointing for me, considering the director is John Woo and has Yun-Fat Chow in it. I purchased the DVD based on those two criteria, unseen, and it was a good lesson.

952991,4,6305020841,"I was completly blown away the first time I saw A Better Tomorrow . Masterfully directed by the John Woo , it focused on the HK gangster life. Sequels, I've learned from experience , are generally [poorer] and just an excuse to make money.  Not so with ABT 2.
The plot is arguably paper-thin and just an excuse to get the characters all [upset] so they can have sweet gunfights with tons of underworld scum.  Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung fit nicely back into their roles as former gangster and HK cop. The whole Mark Gor ""twin brother"" thing was kinda cheesy , but It gives the movie so much more credibility to have Chow Yun-Fat center stage.  Dean Shek did a great job as a traumatized father who eventually regains his sanity in the most stylish way possible.
Onto the DVD...
The picture quality was great , and aside from some weird one-second scratches across the screen , extremely watchable.  For the soundtrack , take your pick of Cantonese or English mono. Defineltly check it out in Cantonese so you can hear the intensity of Chow-Yun's voice ...great stuff.  I was unusually suprised by the English mono .  I find it has an overall stronger sound , and superior music mixing. You see , they occasinally  moved around the music ,a bit (1 min , behind or ahead) , and It does wonders for the movie.  Especially when Fat is with Shek in the hotel , and he starts blasting with his shotgun , the sweet main theme cuts in faster , and boy , it's heaven.

Mark returns to hong kong teams up with Kit and Ho and together take down the traid mob that is now in partnership with the irish and italian mob.

The action sequences praised by some did not have the explosive quality of the action sequences of A Better Tomorrow I, nor the emotional content.  There are only two major shoot-outs in the movie: the first one has chow yun-fat gunning down american gangsters in a hotel with a shotgun (a sequence that is a bit too similar to the sequence in The Getaway where Steve McQueen guns down cops with a shotgun in a hotel (Peckinpah is one of the major influences on Woo); the second one is the final shoot-out and it comes close to self-parody (the baddies are mowed down in groups  la Commando) (Watching it, I even woundered if Woo directed most of this shoot-out - I know there were problems between Woo and Hark during the making of the movie.)  The actors have more or less no intensity during the whole movie: they hardly seem to be playing the same characters as in the first one.  The first third seems to be a rip-off of the Godfather, then the story is chucked out the window with Chow appearing as the twin brother: the first in a series of cheesy moments.  The hit-man that kills Leslie Cheung is an obvious rip-off of Melville`s hitman: Le Samourai (A stoic silent hitman that waits for the other guy to draw before shooting).

I say $20 dollars is worth it unless you are hard on John Woo films. Extras include a trailer and Code Of Bullets thing. I don't know what it is.

Movie Review: Yes, why this movie gets mixed reviews is because for some the story is disjointed and a bit incoherent. Understand this movie was cut like a b**** by Tsui Hark in which resulted in Woo and Tsui's split. I would love to see a director's cut version of this movie to see if it will improve. 1% CHANCE OF THAT HAPPENING! F***S! Anyways, I liked the movie. I agree the story is a little iffy and the character interaction is somewhat meaningless in certain areas while the first was more meaningful and deep; all in all it's all about the action and that is where this movie impresses the most especially the final moments. LOTS OF DEAD PEOPLE! YAY! So screw the lots of yous!

Conclusion: 4 stars for the Blu Ray (questionable audio) and 4 1/2 for A Better Tomorrow 2.",1446508800,,1216,4.448430493273543

7881185,4,6305020841,Great set.  Between the two there are a number of classic fight scenes.  (A few of which inspired scenes from Cowboy Bebop if you're an anime fan.)  It's a lot better if you don't try to get caught up in the narrative and just watch for the action.  Have not been able to find these two movies anywhere else.  So it's a no-brainer purchase!,1431475200,,340,4.25
