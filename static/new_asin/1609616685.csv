7800362,5,1609616685,"This is a great video that I would recommend to anyone. Here's why:
1. The instructors are REAL people. They get tired, make little mistakes and just have unscripted fun...not like the choreographed, perfect type which don't even break a sweat.
2. The workout can be as challenging as you want it to be. I consider myself fairly fit, but the exercises manage to max out my strength using just 3 lb. weights! Someday, when that finally gets easy, I'll move up to a 5 lb. weight.
3. Focuses on strength, but gets the heart rate up as well. I definitely get winded at certain points.
4. The 30+ minutes goes so fast! Before you know it, you've done the whole workout. Other videos (like the choreographed, perfect, don't even break a sweat type mentioned above) feel like they drag on forever!",1425340800,3,790,4.570422535211268
7800363,5,1609616685,"This is a great workout.  I love it since the girls are enjoying theirselves, and don't seem so stiff and scripted.  The girls really don't show you a moderation version, but I have exercised enough to know sorta what I can change to my level.  I am 53 yrs old and have lower back problems. This video is an awesome workout, but probably for a much younger person.",1422057600,2,364,4.323529411764706
7800364,5,1609616685,"I consider myself advanced working out mostly with Cathe, Patrick, Michelle Dozois, Paul Katami, Art of Strength, and the like. I did not expect to like this one much. But to my surprise it was one tough and time-efficient bootcamp style circuit workout of about 35 minutes including warmup and cool down with a one-time 2 minute rest between the two chapters which is welcome. The emphasis is on weights but most of it is compound exercises and gets your heart rate way up. It was well cued and very challenging. In a fairly short period of time it gives you a tough total body workout. It's a keeper!",1324166400,17,602,4.532110091743119
