7858179,5,6303982735,"Director John Goldschmidt's tale of 8 English women who undertake a mountain climbing course is one of those character building in the face of adversity stories saved by the humour in Eva Hardy's screenplay. The fact that we are thrown into the course without any preamble works for the treatment, and the brevity of character delineation saves the soap opera tendency of the women's domestic complaints. In spite of the context, Hardy's women aren't presented as amazons, and it's their perceived weaknesses and doubts that make them human and accessible. Goldschmidt's has Julie Walters as the most vocal of the group react to the sight of the mountain before his camera pans up to it, and kids who make the crazy gesture when observing one of the group's training exercises. This isn't to say that he doesn't mistep - the military drumroll music of John Du Prez is a pain, the handling of upturned boats is overplayed for hysteria, and snow being thrown onto the camera when the women slide down a slope draws attention to the fact that this is an artificially staged event. His pace also slackens towards the end but is redeemed by the final image which explains the title and also presents the comic and heroic efforts of the course's participants. I was also grateful for an unconsumated romance. Hardy provides a good demonstration of the way women cope with antipathy and resolve conflict without resorting to fisticuffs, their emotional openness, the gender non-specific need for self-fulfilment, and evidence that a cohabitative grouping of 8 humans allows for the revealing of personal eccentricities of behaviour. Hardy has her women focus a lot of their talk on sex, mostly to prove that women like it as much as men, even if their agenda is intimacy. Walters may have Hardy's best lines - she refers to PCC, post coital contempt - but she submits her charismatic presence to the ensemble playing, even allowing Goldschmidt to expose her as physically naked as the others, and Hardy thankfully provides her with no major adversary. This is not to suggest that the other actors don't match Walters in the strength of the performances, since they all pull off their low-key arias. Note is made of the designer concentration camp style bunk beds of the course's base, and yellow tents on grassland resembling blocks of butter.",987984000,2,2336,4.931472081218274
