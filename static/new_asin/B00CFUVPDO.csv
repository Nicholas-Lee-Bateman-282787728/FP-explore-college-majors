8581431,2,B00CFUVPDO,"It left a bad taste in my mouth. Translated into the emotional realm, I felt weird. It starts out interesting and turns into a freakish nightmare of twisted human emotion. The illegitimate son is such a decent guy. He gets his wagon hitched to the family of freaks and ruins his happiness forever. I truly hated the storyline. It would have been so nice to sit down to a peaceful story. The acting deserved a higher rating, but I can't stand watching injustice. I don't see why the writers had to focus on a negative theme instead of a lovely story.",1420416000,,549,4.445544554455446
8581432,3,B00CFUVPDO,"Many Korean TV dramas are built around certain cinematic staples usually involving a rich handsome man falling for a poor but attractive female. I have no problem with well made variations on the theme but in FIVE FINGERS there are far too many other assorted stereotypes mixed in in a disjointed fashion to assign it a rating of only a three. The plot involves revenge but here nearly everyone has suffered massive hurt at the hands of another and revenge for that hurt propels the action through thirty episodes. A mother (Chae Shi Ra) hates her step son (Joo Ji hoon) because she sees him as a future potential threat to inherit the family business over her biological son (Ji Chang Wook). This latter son schemes with his mother to ruin his step brother, thus setting in motion a fifteen year battle of plot versus counterplot with each son seeking revenge on the other. The step son falls in love with the daughter (Jin Se-Yeon) of the man killed in a house fire thereby causing a new wave of revenge between the family of the burn victim and the scheming mother. There are plenty of other crisscrossing other revenge plans and after a while I was tempted to yell at the screen for the revenge seekers to bury the family hatchet. Credibility is stretched beyond the breaking point as one revenge plot leads to another. And then there is the weeping. No more than ten minutes goes by without someone breaking down in a torrent of tears. Those reviewers who liked FIVE FINGERS note the close interaction between the assorted family members and I agree that this has its charm. Further the many piano sequences appeal to those with a musical bent. But for those who like a tightly structured and logical plot will lament the ending that simply cries out for a satisfying rationale that seems hurriedly and carelessly tacked on. You may safely pass on this one.",1398297600,3,1862,4.6626139817629175
8581433,5,B00CFUVPDO,"Heavy drama, definitely not for everyone but I must say that it hooked me from the very first few minutes of watching it. Unfortunately shows very clearly what human hate can do even among most close relatives. The video quality  is excellent, the audio is exquisite, the world of music is well exposed here. I recommend it  to anyone that loves music and I must say that differently than most of TV series you don't see any sexual harassment at all. The violence also is limited to the contest of the events taking place. I did love it seeing it! My wife and son are following seeing it  and already over half of the chapters and totally hooked. My wife has abandoned watching her usual daily Spanish speaking ""telenovela"" (soap opera) to see this drama. I have finished watching it yesterday and now I hope soon to see coming out the Season Two. One more ""VERY IMPORTANT"" aspect of this drama is that shows and brings back to life the BEAUTY of the sound of long LOST PIANO!!!",1390521600,2,978,4.48314606741573
8581434,5,B00CFUVPDO,"Let's get one thing straight.

I can't stand TV and hardly watch it.

I probably watch about 30 minutes of TV a month and most of that 30 minutes is unintentional meaning I just happen to be in the same room of someone else watching and I over hear it in the background while working on something else.

I'm more of a music type person and I find TV to be a complete waste of time.

However I watched this series on Netflix trying to take advantage of my free trial month and found this FIve Fingers series. I play piano so I wanted to see what the deal was and this series had me addicted. I couldn't stop watching it. In fact I watched the first 8 episodes back to back late one night and was so into it that the morning came and I realized that I hadn't slept at all.

I went to sleep woke up 3 hours later and just had to continue watching.

It was all I could think about till the series was done. It took me about 4 days to watch all 30 episodes.

All I can say is, is there a season 2?",1389830400,,992,3.9054726368159205
8581435,1,B00CFUVPDO,"This is a TV series about a totally dysfunctional family. I could only take 1 1/2 episodes and then just had to quit.

The father is an evil, autocratic beast and child-beater. The mother is a vengeful, jealous, lying child-hater. The grandmother is an Alzheimer patient of the most irritating kind and believes she is starving, which we have to watch over and over, and it goes downhill from there.

The plot is a struggle between brothers for supremacy, ""parental love."" (Gack! From these creeps?) Oh, and a mega-dollar business inheritance. Except that the older brother, who is from an unwed mother bedded by the evil father, doesn't struggle: he's too wrought up about finding his birth-mother, and being Good----all in a kinda Jesus-like Tolerance of others :(

I must give special, mention to the hysteric, histrionic, over-the-top, narcissistic, psychopathic ""younger brother,"" whom I found unwatchable, irritating, and probably the worst character in the history of video.

MISS THIS !!",1388448000,,995,5.2
