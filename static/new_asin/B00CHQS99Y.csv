8581838,4,B00CHQS99Y,"Nice affordable, TV show featuring four short shows (1/2-hour long) starring Ida Lupino in various roles,  showcasing her wide array of talent as an actress and director. They don't make shows like this on TV. A keeper DVD worth the money and worth watching. There is a Volume 2 series I plan to buy. Barbara Stanwyck had a similar series which also was very good.",1414972800,8,364,4.6
8581839,3,B00CHQS99Y,"Considering these are television shows and not movies, it was still fun watching. Ida is great as usual. If you are only looking for full length movies these are not for you.",1407542400,,174,4.46875
8581840,5,B00CHQS99Y,IT SEEMS WHATEVER IDA LUPINO ENGAGES IN TURNS TO GOLD.  IN THESE TV SHORT STORIES SHE BRINGS ALIVE EACH STORY WITH HER FANTASTIC ACTING AND DIRECTING.

8581841,5,B00CHQS99Y,This maybe old time TV but Ida  knew it all. She was one of Warners Queen Bees for awhile. How they dropped their great talent. She proved to them she was just as clever as all their great crews producing their movies. Long live Ida in our movie memories.,1395187200,7,255,4.204081632653061
8581842,5,B00CHQS99Y,"I`m giving this set five stars because of Ida however the presentation is somewhat lacking. Firstly, it`s a DVD-R and secondly the ALPHA logo appears on screen during the program.  How they expect the public to buy, without knowing what is on the disc bewilders  me.  The picture and sound seem good, but I haven`t watched any yet.  All appear to be crime dramas from the T.V.  series STAR PERFORMANCE (Four Star Playhouse).
The programs are: 1 THE LISTENER, 2 FACE OF DANGER, 3 THE STAND-IN and 4 DARK MEETING.
IDA is in all shows with other stars, among them: WILLIAM SCHALLERT, PAUL PICERNI, VIRGINIA FIELD, WARREN STEVENS, RALPH MOODY, WALTER COY,  DICK FORAN, and HERB VIGRAN.  100 MINUTES TOTAL TIME. I have  oredered VOL 2 which I will also review.",1392854400,2,755,4.709923664122138
