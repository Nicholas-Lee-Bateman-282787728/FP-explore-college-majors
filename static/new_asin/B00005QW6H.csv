3172972,4,B00005QW6H,"If you aren't a fan of AMA flat track racing, you probably won't find much of interest here.  The story plot is quite predictable and centers around the relationship of aging racer (Craig T, Nelson) and a young boy that he meets in the hospital.  The old racer is in the hospital recovering from a racing injury and the young boy is a cancer patient.  They form a bond and teach each other several life lessons.  I liked the racing sequences and the on track shots of many of the racers of the day. (Scott Parker, Jay Springsteen, Chris Carr)  The announcing of Dave Despain also adds some authenticity to the movie. George Roeder III is Nelson's body double for the racing sequences.  I liked the movie a lot, but you may not unless you have some experience with AMA racing.",1251504000,3,775,4.460992907801418

3172987,2,B00005QW6H,"As an avid motorcycle racing fan I wanted to like this movie. But with an over-the-hill racer who's life has gone in the wrong direction (he drinks too much) but is turned around by a little boy dying of cancer who needs to learn to fight back... Uh, well I guess I'll just win a ""National"" to show I can fight back too. Add a 'crazy side-kick' and an old friend/mentor and you've covered about all the cliches.

I would have liked it if there had been more coverage of actual racing and what it takes as a privateer to follow the circuit like it used to be done. But then you have a documentary, I guess.",1394064000,,605,4.170940170940171

The quality of the visual on the tape is not excellent, but good enough to be enjoyable.  The story line is a good example of the trials and tribulations of those brave pony express riders and you do feel like you are at the movies with this production, so load up on popcorn.

8266217,4,B00005QW6H,"I don't watch many movies. I watched this one because I'm a flat track fan. It turned out to be a pretty good story in spite of that.  If you happen to be a flat track fan though, this film has some good racing sequences.  George Roeder II does the Craig Nelson riding, but there is a host of classic riders including H-D's holy trinity of 80's era, Springsteen, Parker & Carr. The story line started out a little cheesey, but 15 minutes in, it left most of that stuff behind.  Good movie.",1468627200,,489,4.236559139784946
