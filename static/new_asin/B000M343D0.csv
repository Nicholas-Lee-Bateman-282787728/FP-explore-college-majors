8166087,5,B000M343D0,"Just for the main character, 5 stars.",1490486400,,37,4.428571428571429
8166088,2,B000M343D0,Attempt at a rom-com about alcoholism.  Just didn't work.  The jokes are very thin on the ground.  Maybe it would be more amusing after a few drinks?,1487721600,,149,4.444444444444445
8166089,5,B000M343D0,I really enjoyed this movie. I thought that they managed to take a fairly common story and make it different and realistic with a twist of humor. I felt like the lead character was well played and authentic and I enjoyed the fact that the people surrounding him were played as larger-than-life stereotypes so the focus was on his personal change rather then on the surrounding factors that led to his alcoholism (a story that tends to be fairly redundant with addiction).,1314144000,4,471,4.7560975609756095
8166090,2,B000M343D0,"Though this movie had a lot of potential, it is pretty much ruined with over-the-top stereotypical characters, very contrived situations, and a predictable plot.  Too bad, because I liked the leads, but only Ellen Pompeo's character has any real believability.  Perhaps many of the side characters were being portrayed in a tongue in cheek manner, but the comedy here is not smart, and falls flat over and over again.  The last quarter of the movie attempts to move towards a more serious dramatic climax, but by this time suffers from such a credibility problem, that it too falls short of any real revelation, insight, or endearment.  A disappointment.",1243468800,4,654,5.027777777777778
8166091,3,B000M343D0,"This movie was not bad, but not great.  I bought it because I'm a fan of the leading man; he is gorgeous.  The performances are good, production values are good, but the story is predictable.

All in all, it was worth watching, but I doubt I will watch it again.",1240444800,4,262,4.2
