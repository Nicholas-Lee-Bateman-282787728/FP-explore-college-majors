7888759,5,6305373310,The visuals are stunning.  The text is interesting and accurate.  It is also well paced and will keep your interest. The class of 24 high school students that watched this video enjoyed it and rated it a A+.  They learned enough to ask questions about some of the implications. It contains plenty of current research that has not been put on any other videos.  As a science teacher I also found it fascinating.  One of the best things was the researchers it showed were young people doing real science.,1107907200,,502,4.595505617977528
