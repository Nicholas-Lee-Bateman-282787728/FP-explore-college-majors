June McCarthy is on her way back to America by ship as war is declared.  On the ship she meets the wealthy Carl Cutler, who is soon revealed to be a German agent.  He sends a secret cable giving the position of the passenger ship he is traveling on.  This enables a U-boat to sink the American ship.  Cutler rescues June and they eventually arrive in the U.S.

Meanwhile, Junes erstwhile love interest, Captain Jimmy Madden, is fixing up his derelict steamer, the Apache,  awaiting her return.  Cutler hires and outfits Maddens ship, kidnaps June and sets off to rendezvous with a U-boat at sea.  Madden and his crew are made prisoner and his ship is used to entice and capture other ships.  Eventually, June has a chance to help the prisoners send a message.

A couple of fishermen find the message, and alert the British authorities, who send a cruiser after the Apache.  Cutler delays the cruiser waiting for his attendant U-boats to attack it for him.  He releases the women and children prisoners in lifeboats, after the cruiser fires a shot into the bow, above the waterline.  The male prisoners then rally and fight to take the boat.  Cutler, realizing he has lost, tells his men to abandon ship, saying it is every man for himself.  He then releases June, who is reunited with Madden.  Cutler urges them to get off the Apache, and elects to go down with the ship.

June and Madden arrive back at home with reporters following them.
