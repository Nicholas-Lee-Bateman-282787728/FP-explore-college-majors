8110942,4,B000ELL5MC,This is an excellent documentary but you have to know Turkey's recent history quite well to appreciate it. As a piece of political science it is an insufficient document.,1232755200,3,170,4.896551724137931
8110943,5,B000ELL5MC,"Without the burden of ideological narration, this documentary provides an in depth look at the military takeover history of modern Turkey. It provides a fair and unprejudiced look at the events since the interviews are not manipulated but rather are edited together with excellent flow, with a good balance of academia, politicians, journalists and military figures involved. We get the ""facts"" from different points of view and it only proves that everything including the ""facts"" are relative when it comes to history and politics.",1140393600,5,533,5.357142857142857
8110944,5,B000ELL5MC,"Much of Turkish history has been altered by many views--mainly the Turkish state's functionaries and their various political positions which seek to present a 'uniform' set of Turkish history, leaving out or outright changing events to suit the unitary ideals of a Turkish state.  Often, in any nation's depictions of historical events, events are written by the dominant.  Also, the voices of the people invovled, the various voices high and low, are most often made invisible.  For many who suffered under the various Turkish historical events, they have been silenced or used by the dominant with much at stake.

Turkey is a nation attempting to come out from under its own oppressive conditions, learned through European colonialism, turn-of-the-twentieth-century fascist ideals, and its necessary military powers which had to defend against encroaching European, Russian, Middle Eastern, and Asian powers after World War II.

Unfortunately, when a STATE is developed, the maintenance of the said state usually builds to MAINTAIN its structure.  For Turkey, its transformation into THE REPUBLIC solidified its promises.  It also formed solid divisions.

With its inception into NATO in the 1950s, its psychological, military, institutional, educational and legal structures were under the thumb--in many but not in all--ways.  Certainly the Cold War brought the various diverse alliances in the Ottoman Empire to fractured allegiances and conflicts, continuing in Turkey--complicating and fracturing its own diverse government peoples and the masses.

This video is a great picture of the events surrounding the many military coups in Turkey.  Its military powers are increasingly powerful because of the role of the US, Russia, Germany, and other nations.  Particularly the US, with its psychological and military assistance to Turkey enforced a religious-vs.-secular divide as well as ethnic divisions and political shreds between the various Marxist leanings, fascist structures, and democratic ideals.

I am an American, with many Turkish and Kurdish friends.  We have watched the video and have had many fruitful and complex discussions, bringing understanding.  It helps that they see the faces and the emotions and concerns of the various politicians, journalists and activists that most have heard about but have never seen talking frankly--away from the Turkish government's eyes.  This is a fantastic work on that level to begin.

Historical events are brought to life and suffering is not just something of their own, but can relate other people's positions in a way that invites understanding.  I

Because many Turkish and Kurdish people have been told one side of the story, this video is great for opening up different views and asking questions of history and the future of citizenship in Turkey.

Getting rid of the Turkish military is not something realistic. This video gives new light on people's strong opinions, now changed.

I salute Brian and Elif for this wonderful piece.  It is not meant to explain everything.  It is a small picture into complicated events portrayed very well and coherently.  It is a moving piece, especially when one sees the testimonies of activists and journalists who have been tortured or who were close with people whoe were executed.

This is important and five stars just for an attempt.  As many people reading this review or watch the video will refuse to want to acknowledge the truths spoken in this video and the effects of history.  Thank you and history is a great teacher.",1140393600,6,3537,5.337545126353791
8110945,5,B000ELL5MC,"This film explores the history of military intervention in Turkish Republic politics.  It is not easy subject material.  Rather than stoop to polemic or cheap stunts, the filmakers give equal time to all sides of this very complicated and emotional issue. They step out of the way and let the interviewees--Turkish politicians, soldiers, academics and revolutionaries--do the talking.  In doing so, an intriguing and vivid picture of the Turkish secular state and its people emerges.  Beautifully done.",1140393600,5,502,5.48051948051948
