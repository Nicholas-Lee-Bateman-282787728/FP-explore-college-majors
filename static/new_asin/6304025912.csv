There is a marriage celebration. The newspapers tell of a grave robbery. Susan Cushing returns home to find her lodger in her kitchen; he is friendly with her sister. Miss Cushing visits Sherlock Holmes to investigate her sister Mary, Mrs. Browner. On Christmas Eve Susan opens a package and faints. Inspector Hawkins visits Sherlock about this strange gift to a lady. This is not a practical joke says Holmes. Susan tells about Sarahs past actions. Sherlock questions Sarah.

Watson learned about a ships problems; its sailors were given an extra day off. Jim Browner visits Sarah, they argue. Holmes, Watson, and Hawkins are there, Jim explains what happened. That Blue Ribbon refers to a pledge of abstinence from alcohol. A crime of passion is handled differently in France. [Temporary Insanity?] There is a flashback to the crime, the bodies thrown into icy waters. [No decomposition to bring the bodies floating to the surface.]

What is the object of this circle of misery and violence asks Holmes. Isnt the answer peoples needs for possessions? I think the original story is better than this adaptation. [Would appearing on the Jerry Springer Show allow them to work out their problems? Does this work?]",1478736000,,1235,5.044117647058823

This movie is based on the story ""The Adventure of the Cardboard Box"" (1893) written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930).

The story is about three sisters.  One of the sisters (Lucy Whybrow) gets married to a sailor (Ciaran Hines), another (Debbie Findlay) becomes Warden of a mission, and a third (Joanna David) runs a boarding house and, at this time, has a French medical student (Thierry Harcourt) as one of her tenants.

The married sister is eventually discovered to be missing.  At this point, Sherlock Holmes (Jeremy Brett) is called in to investigate but he shows little interest in a mere missing persons case.  But when the sister who runs the boarding house receives a grisly Christmas gift (so grisly that Dr. Watson (Edward Hardwicke) has to give some medical advice), Sherlock's interest is piqued.

Listen for Sherlock's eloquent speech at the end of the movie:

""What is the object of this circle of misery and violence and fear.  It must have a purpose, for our universe has no meaning and that is unthinkable.  But what purpose?  That is humanity's great problem to which reason so far has no answer.""

Brett (as usual) does a good job in capturing the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance.  Also look for the fine performance of Hines as the sailor-husband.

I had a friend who knew nothing about Brett's health problems watch this movie.  She could not see anything abnormal about him and, in fact, commented on his excellent performance.  As well, I noted that his poor health did not distract from his fine performance.

Finally, the props, costumes, background music, and cinematography are well done.

In conclusion, this is a good movie to watch even if you have read the story it's based on!!

7859270,4,6304025912,"I couldn't disagree more strongly with Mr. Marseille's review of this episode. Yes, of course, Jeremy Brett's illness is very apparent. I find the constant harping on this theme in all the reviews of later episodes of this series very tiresome. Despite his illness, his performance in this episode is excellent, as is every cast member's performance. (Pay special attention to Ciaran Hind's performance as Jim Browner-exceptional!) Overall, the atmosphere of the tale is dark and oppressive-as it should be! The theme of this story is the terrible price of deception and guilt. In my opinion this is a wonderfully entertaining and beautifully rendered adaptation of the story.",976752000,6,676,5.268518518518518
7859271,3,6304025912,"This series died a slow death, and this is a relic of the last, sad days of the classic Granada show.  Poor Jeremy Brett is sickly and weak.  However, he does his best.  Harwicke is, as ever, the best Watson - he's the only actor who's ever realized that the character is NOT a bumbling idiot.
This episode feels lifeless overall.  Partly due to the Brett factor, and partly because the whole thing is just running out of steam.",973641600,2,428,4.379746835443038
