3967969,3,B002QW7AJY,"I'm started to get a bit concerned for lovers of Sci-Fi: Is extreme and gruesome violence the only way for Hollywood to tell a decent story? First District 9, then Gamers, now Pandorum. I'm really tired of having to close my eyes through a good portion of each Sci-Fi film I watch. Three Sci-Fi movies in a row is the beginning of a trend, and an annoying one at that!

On the plus side: The will to survive is palpable in Pandorum. As is the drive to never give-up, absolutely, no matter, what! Despite every conceivable obstacle, our hero's fight to the bitter end to accomplish the impossible. On one level this story is about finding allies and displaying the ultimate courage a human being is capable expressing. The only reason why Pandorum gets 3 stars instead of zero! If you're timing with closing your eyes is as good as mine, you might even leave the theater thanking whatever deity you worship for being reminded of the existence of people in the real world who are like the heroes in Pandorum!

3967970,4,B002QW7AJY,"This is not a film for those unaccustomed to nor interested in paying close attention to detail. I should also think it less than a fun time for those unfamiliar with the basics in classical sci-fi literature or the history of science, either as read or gleaned from other sci-fi films. But for those so prepared and so open, be ready for the surprise treat of the end-of-summer fantasy film offerings. This film is dark (in at least two senses), tense, and tension- building, and as entertaining as it is unexpected in a season that has also given us the superb and timely ""District 9"". Pandorum is a feast for the philosophical and a vertical roller-coaster ride for the connoiseur of inventive camera work and break-neck cinematic direction. (My only demurer is that some of the camera work is too ""inventive"" for dramatic clarity and some of the direction too ""breakneck"" to effect the desired continued companionship of the audience.  I saw the film in a New York theater full of kids (under 30's) on a Saturday night, late; and after the first fifteen minutes of wrapper-rattling and over-the-dialogue inane audience chit-chat and back-talk, you could have heard a pin drop throughout the rest of the film.  Nuff said?",1254182400,3,1224,4.851674641148326

For some reason Amazon has removed the picture and URL to that movie:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pandorum/dp/B002QW7ALM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pandorum</a>)

They don't have 4.5 stars, so I guess I have to round down although this is one of the best movies I've seen this year.

We went to this expecting a movie rendition of Dead Space with lots of gratuitous gore and a little bit of story on the side (I wanted to go for the Sci-fi aspects and was prepared to avert my eyes, er... bite my girl on her ear during the really gory parts).  What a pleasant surprise this was!  It turned out to be more of a psychological mystery-thriller than a slasher, the story was meatier than the gore and the sci-fi was plentiful enough to satisfy my geeky appetite!

I'm not saying it isn't spooky (I made my wife put her hands in her own lap after about 15 minutes) but the scary aspects are outweighed by the other devices in the movie so that I would not label this as a horror flick (although it does graphically show the all-time most horrifying way to wake up from a deep sleep).

You do need to pay attention to the dialogue and visual cues in the movie if you want to understand most of what you are seeing, so plan on focusing and listening and be ready to answer a possible question or two from your movie-buddies if they miss a clue, especially towards the end.

There are only two negatives: First, it takes the protagonist so long to settle in with other characters that there isn't much time to develop them to a comfortable level (and I would have loved to see Nadia better fleshed out).  Second, there was only one real inconsistency that bothered me, but it might not be an inconsistency... I need to watch the movie again, listen closely to the relationships in the timeline story when it suddenly floods the screen, and do some math (it would be a spoiler if I told you what it is).

Pandorum was a satisfying sci-fi movie experience worthy of a cinema ticket and I recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi, can tolerate a bit of gore and likes movies that push them into philosophical conversations and debates.",1254096000,4,2272,4.729113924050633
3967972,3,B002QW7AJY,"Since the inception of ""Alien"", there have been many attempts at a cross-blending in genres of science fiction and horror. I guess there is just nothing scarier than being stuck in space with no place to run to. ""PANDORUM"" is a collaboration between American and German filmmakers to make a sci-fi horror film. Directed/co-written by Christian Alvart (Anti-Bodies) with screenplay by Travis Milloy, the film is full of slick European claustrophobic atmosphere that is a journey through the depths of the human psyche.

In the far distant future, the Earth had become vastly overpopulated that humankind has resorted in trying to locate a new habitable planet. When a planet is finally found that closely resembled mother Earth, a gigantic ship called the Elysium is sent with its 60,000 passengers to inhabit the new world. Now aboard the ship, two astronauts, Bower (Ben Foster) and Payton (Dennis Quaid) are forcefully awakened out of hyper-sleep, they are disoriented with little memory of what had gone before save for their mission, as they find the huge ship seemingly with little power and no other crew members. Exploring the spacecraft, they find that something terrible may have happened that can affect the human race. Setting out to find answers and to reset the reactor, Bowers encounters other crew members (sexy Antje Traue and Cung Le are among them) who are fleeing from mutated cannibalistic inhuman creatures that are stalking the bowels of the ship. To make things worst, there is also the madness called ""Pandorum""....

""Pandorum"" is directed by Christian Alvart, whose previous work called ""AntiBodies"" have impressed me; so naturally, I would be very curious to see how he manages to pull off a sci-fi horror film. The movie borrows heavily from other sci-fi horror thrillers such as ""Event Horizon"", ""Eden Log"", ""Sunshine"" and even the horror thriller ""The Descent"". The film brings about the horrors of space travel, the alienation and fear that can arise from it, and the collapse of the psyche. While most sci-fi horror films are basically a descent into a hellish journey, ""Pandorum"" also brings about certain ""trippy"" mind games aside from the usual perils of being killed and eaten alive.

If claustrophobia has a name, it has to be Christian Alvart. The man definitely knows how to generate extreme discomfort and panic. The film has a manner in playing the right mood, feel and atmosphere to freak the viewer out with the isolated narrow set designs, the tight confines are easily felt by the viewer. It is easy to sympathize with the characters in their situation, the viewer is effectively brought into this world full of dark steamy corridors, wet and dank environment that has that ominous feel. The film is more of a haunted house experience than an actual monster-chase film, there are some nicely timed scares but it is rather uneven in its execution. There are several freaky images that provided its visceral impact, and I have to admit the film does manage to generate some decent suspense; hey, the film has several sequences of action and even blood and gore; yes, the old-fashioned type with little uitlization of CGI enhancements. The creature designs have that very pale-faced look reminiscent of ""The Descent"" with the ""Mad Max"" enhancements. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, it is time to breakdown the film's plot and screenplay.

The plot itself is very interesting, the idea of making a perilous long journey has a lot of potential. It asks the right questions as to who...what....where?, and the viewer can easily become eager to see the resolution. The first half of the film starts off strongly, as I was very intrigued as to what happened to the crew. The explanation itself is credible enough, after all, we all know the theories of evolution. I also liked the sexy girl warrior Nadia (Antje Traue) and the stoic Manh (Cung Le), even the hunter leader (played by Andre Hennicke) is pretty creepy and intimidating. The place it falters is the way it structured the film, it seems to be taking its time trying to explain things, give the film a mythic feel, all the while trying to make it more complex than it really is. In a film set in outer space it is a good idea to keep the pace quick and tight, while keeping the viewer busy with scenes of raw emotion and suspense. I like emotions in my horror films, but this movie may just be too full of `in-your-face' emotions that some scenes felt a little too heavy for a film this predictable. The problem is, when there are no creatures the film almost stops to a crawl.

Ben Foster (30 Days of Night) is pretty ok as the main protagonist, but I sure wished his supporting cast was more fleshed out. Dennis Quaid does his role with minimum effort. Nadia is the character with the most potential, but she was a little undermined with the display of human angst. There are also some underlying questions as to how long they managed to survive this long; there are also several holes in the script. (after all the mission log says that a certain amount of time had elapsed) Cam Gigandet (Never Back Down) has the most crucial role in the film, but I found his performance to be lackluster.

""Pandorum"" does have its fair share of decent twists and turns, the film started off strong but it began to wear thin as it went along. Alvart does try to add some needed intricacies to the film's otherwise predictable plot, but it felt a little too forced. Alvart did manage to provide some spooky atmosphere, freaky images and some good thrills, but the film felt very superficial. The movie is just derivative of other films in sci-fi horror. The climax felt more like a irrevocability than an actual resolution to the film's plot.

Recommended timidly, Rent It first [3-Stars = Good, Flawed With Redeeming Qualities]",1253923200,24,5822,4.821821821821822
3967973,3,B002QW7AJY,"If you combined the sci-fi/horror element of being trapped on a ghostly ship like in Event Horizon, fight scenes straight out of Pitch Black and creatures that look very similar to the ones in The Descent (other than the fact that they carry weapons here), you would get Pandorum as a result. I liked all three of those movies I mentioned, so it's not exactly a bad thing. The acting ranges from average to fairly good, the ships's atmosphere is creepy, there are a few neat twists along the way and I liked the ending, yet I left the theater feeling entertained, but I wasn't entirely satisifed. I'm not quite sure why, but something about the movie was just off at times. For starters, there were far fewer action scenes than I expected after watching all the trailers. It's not that I need wall to wall fight scenes, but this movie could have used a some more. Also, the quick cut editing got on my nerves, especially when people are fighting to the death and you have no idea who's winning. The mystery of what really happened to the 60,000 people aboard the ship was handled well, as we get piece after piece of the puzzle. Overall, Pandorum was exactly the kind of film I predicted it to be and I had fun watching it, but it had the potential to be so much more.",1253923200,2,1268,4.4
3967974,3,B002QW7AJY,"Here's what I do understand about ""Pandorum."" It takes place centuries in the future. Earth has become so overpopulated that food becomes scarce. In an effort to save humanity, a spaceship populated by 60,000 people gets a one-way ticket to a new planet millions of miles from Earth, which shows evidence of being habitable. But something goes wrong somewhere along the way, causing countless numbers of the crew to awaken prematurely and mutate into flesh-eating beasts. Others are susceptible to a psychosis known as Pandorum, which is brought on by extended periods of hypersleep. In the grip of Pandorum, the victim becomes paranoid, homicidal, and out of touch with reality. Awakening in the middle of all this chaos are two astronauts, Lt. Payton (Dennis Quaid) and Corporal Bower (Ben Foster), who have both lost their memory.

I understand all that. But really, what is going on in this movie? What are these characters doing? What is the point the filmmakers are trying to get across? It's maddening when you have all the right pieces of the puzzle but are unable to fit them together into anything cohesive. Events are explained, but somehow, none of it sinks in, so either things didn't go right with the editing or I missed something along the way. Whatever the case, ""Pandorum"" is about as mysterious as a shadowy hallway stretching endlessly through a spaceship, and I was forced to roam through it with nothing but a light stick and the hope that I would eventually be able to get my bearings.

One thing this movie does get right is the atmosphere. The spaceship, called the ""Elysium,"" is a labyrinth of cramped passageways and dark corners for things to hide in. Most everything is illuminated with sticks of glowing colored light that cast eerie auras and reflect off of dirty metal surfaces. The quiet moments are suspenseful and brooding, and monsters continuously pop out and loudly roar. This is one of the most effective carnival funhouse experiences I've had in a long time. The thing is, funhouses usually have the decency to not bother with a plot. Here is a case in which a plot is used not as a way to tell a story, but merely to tease the audience along until it's left hopelessly perplexed. After seeing the film, you can go online and find many websites explaining the plot details, and you will probably understand it at that point. As far as I'm concerned, it's preferable to understand it while actually watching it.

After our astronauts awaken in their sleeping tubes and emerge sputtering, disoriented, and coated in a slimy film, Payton remains in a control room while Bower searches the rest of the ship. Aside from pockets of carnivorous baddies, he also comes across two crew members who have been awake for months, which is apparently enough time to learn how to fight like a martial arts instructor. One of them doesn't speak English, although he does seem willing to entertain the idea that Bower isn't a threat. The other, a lethal, dirt-covered scientist named Nadia (Antje Traue), does speak English and needs a little more convincing as far as Bower is concerned. They then journey towards the ship's reactor, hoping to reactivate it before the rest of the ship's power completely fails. Why is the power failing? Have they been in space longer than the estimated 100-plus years?

Payton, meanwhile, eventually discovers a slime-covered young officer named Gallo (Cam Gigandet), who somehow escaped from the elusive bridge section of the ""Elysium."" It isn't long before he starts showing signs of Pandorum, and I can't say any more than that because it would spoil one of the film's two major plot twists. I will say that neither twist was particularly appropriate given what little there was building up to them. The closest we get to a decent explanation is a poem recited by an insane ship's cook (Eddie Rouse), who in his years of isolation etched the crew's ill-fated story onto the walls. Not that it works; if anything, the explanation leaves me with even more questions about the nature of certain characters and exactly when they came out of hypersleep.

In case I haven't made it clear by now, I didn't get this movie. To me, it seemed like a video game version of Ridley Scott's ""Alien,"" minus the convincing story and the plausible characters. I'm well aware that some movies are not supposed to go for the obvious, that we have to actually use our brains to figure things out. But there's a difference between the cerebral and the confusing, and ""Pandorum"" can't seem to make that distinction. It wants to tell us a story, but it doesn't quite know how. For the most part, it only gets by on mood, created by means of impressively creepy visuals. Yes, you will find numerous blogs and movie websites dedicated to this movie, and some of them will do a better job explaining the plot than the screenplay did. Maybe you would be better off reading one of them instead of paying for a ticket.",1253836800,3,4950,4.791569086651054
3967975,4,B002QW7AJY,"The year is 2174. The population of Earth has reached over 24 billion. Famine and wars are commonplace. In a last ditch effort to save humankind, we send out a probe to find a planet that can sustain us. The mission is a success, though it will take over a hundred years to reach the new home...

Fast forward:

Two men wake up from deep sleep; alone, disoriented and suffering from memory loss. As their recollections slowly return, they realize they are part of the space ship crew navigating 60,000 settlers from Earth to the new planet. They have questions, but few answers. Where is everyone? How long have they been asleep? Why are they awake? Who's on bridge, flying the machine? And finally, once they discover they are NOT alone: what are those things, and where did they come from?!

Butterflies in my stomach? Check. Nails (my own ;o)) digging into my arm? Check. Conversing with friends about the movie long after the end? Check. All are side effects of a well made scary thriller (the sci-fi was just a bonus) and all were present in this case. The story has a great twist, but, best of all, it is largely plot-hole-free, as well as plausible.

So, why four, rather then five stars?  Two reasons. Firstly, once answers start coming, they come fast and furious, to the point of being a tad confusing. Secondly, the two main characters are a bit lacking. Until the climactic end, Dennis Quaid spends most of the film saying ""Bower, are you there...are you there, Bower?"" He is a good actor but the script does not give him much to work with, leaving his talent underused. Ben Foster (the Angel from X-Men the Last Stand), disserves the top billing, as the action revolves mainly around him. Still, a more charismatic actor may have drawn us further into the character. There is a nice appearance from Cung Le, a Vietnamese-American real life martial arts champion (you may remember him from Fighting). He is a talkative passanger with all the answers, but, to Bower's frustration, no English. The man can move, but his awesome skills are not fully utilized here either. Shame...

This is not another Alien or Predator. It will not change the direction of film evolution. Still, Pandorum satisfactorily delivers scary, creepy sci-fi with a well put together story and a hopeful ending (I miss those!). It entertains!

Enjoy!",1253836800,160,2334,4.7481481481481485
3967976,3,B002QW7AJY,"I just never know what to expect from horror / sci-fi films. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. I can't think of too many times where it didn't work. I guess there's Supernova, Doom, Virus, John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars, and other films like that. But there's also the Alien movies, the first Species, Pitch Black, Event Horizon, and even the Resident Evil movies that hit the nail on the head. I would have to say Pandorum does a pretty decent job of hammering it down.

Pandorum is loud, noisy, and has more gore than I think most ""regular"" moviegoers are probably used to. That being said, it also strives to be intelligent and arty. It's kind of a strange mix. It melds together elements of such films as Event Horizon, Alien, Resident Evil, and even The Poseidon Adventure. I mean, the whole film is about a guy trying to reach the reactor of the ship to turn it back on. Just imagine Gene Hackman (or Kurt Russell, if you've only seen the remake Poseidon) and company trying to get off the ship before it breaks apart...but they're being chased by cannibalistic monsters that look similar to the creatures in The Descent and seem to have superhuman strength and speed.

The acting in the film for the most part is pretty decent. Dennis Quaid comes off kind of cheesy a few times and some of the dialogue for the other characters could have been spruced up a bit. There's really nothing to cry about, though. I was kind of excited to see that Norman Reedus (The Boondock Saints, Blade II, Deuces Wild, Gossip, Messengers 2: The Scarecrow) was in this, but was disappointed when his character gets dragged off a mere five minutes after he hits the screen.

The special effects and cinematography were very stylistic. The scene of the ""mutant"" cannibal lair where they're all piled on each other and intertwined was reminiscent of the scene in Alien Resurrection where Ripley is lying with all the Aliens in their lair. Now imagine having to crawl through them covered in their skin to get to where you need to go. Yes, it is pretty nerve-wracking and disturbing. The ferocious way the ""mutants"" run, attack, and eat their prey is also a big visual highlight.

You can tell that the writer of this film really did try to do something intelligent and new, while treading on some familiar ground. There's a pretty decent story lying under all the visual hocus-pocus and gore. I actually liked the end (one of them, at least), even though I could see it coming a mile away. I wanted to write that I didn't like it, but I just can't. It worked so well within the frame of the story.

Is Pandorum a groundbreaking film? No. Is it going to shock genre fans and be the next big thing? No. Is it a good movie that entertains, but at the same time doesn't dumb anything down story wise for action and gore? Yes. Like I said earlier, your ""normal"" Friday night movie-going audience will probably find it more shocking and gory than us genre gore hounds.

3967999,4,B002QW7AJY,"Pandorum is a really solid sci-fi/horror/mystery film that takes some interesting chances that I think work overall.  The story is about a colony ship sent across space with passengers in cryogenic stasis to be awoken when they arrive at a target like-Earth planet.  The long journey is ostensibly at a standstill when several of the ships officers and other random colonists are suddenly awoken from their deep sleep only to find the ship damaged and overrun by a hostile species.  The goal is clear - get the ship working, remove the alien presence, and continue the journey; however, as new clues are revealed, one is forced to continually question whether this can actually be accomplished.

The film has some interesting concepts that it plays around with that are fairly original, & the protagonist's own internal struggle adds to the intensity of the film.  There is some confusion with the end sequence has to how it would actually play out in reality, but I think it works overall.  The film also has a familiar face play a character that is funny-insane migrating to dangerous/frightening-insane as elements of the plot are revealed.  The film definitely has an audience and many will not like it - I don't think the concern is so much with actual plausibility of colonizing another world, so much as this is used as a vehicle for a psychological horror film.

3968029,5,B002QW7AJY,"Five MIND-BENDING Stars. This is an impressive deep-space SciFi thriller. I missed ""Pandorum"" because it was poorly advertised (the ad company went bankrupt prior to release) and the movie poster makes it look like an earth-bound laboratory thriller. Not even close. Many others apparently missed it too from the poorly-attended theater numbers.

This one grabs the viewer from the first scene.  ""Pandorum"" is ""Passengers"" on steroids from a different viewpoint and plot, executed on a marvelous, extended set with a great cast. It has a unique twist on the familiar plot where 2 confused star ship cosmonauts awaken too early from extended 'cold sleep' to disastrous, terrifying results. Starring Dennis Quaid, Ben Foster, Antje Traue, Cam Gigandet, Cung Le, Eddie Rouse, and others. Directed by Christian Alvant. Buckle up! My Highest Recommendation. Five MYSTERIOUS Stars.

Human conflict would have been sufficient. The filmmakers seem to (or were pressured to) try to appeal to several different audiences. a bunch of interesting ideas lost in a LOT of loud noises (in one unintentionally hilarious moment, a character shoves aside a ""metal"" manhole cover type hatch, which is (based on the sound effect) supposed to be heavy but you can clearly see that the broken top of it is plastic maybe a half inch thick at most.) and very confusing scene jumps.

But being a science fiction addict I went into this story cautious with low expectations and finished up floored by its creativity.

A close friend of mine REALLY doesnt like flicks that have something unexpectedly jumping out. So in the nature of being a true buddy I quietly included this film with several others I lent him. Instead of a punch upon returning it he was surprisingly impressed as well. Thats how good this film is.

Though the Amazon description for this release would seem to advertise otherwise, the singledisc DVD release does come with the same Special Features as the Bluray version. The insert to my copy reads as follows;
----------
FEAR WHAT HAPPENS NEXT

It's pitch black on an abandoned ship 500 miles from earth. For crew members Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) and Lt. Payton (Dennis Quaid) an unflinching vision of terror is about to be unleashed.

With an unspeakable horror lurking around every corner, the astronauts uncover the terrifying reality that the survival of mankind hinges on their actions. Fear what happens next

Cam Gigandet (Never Back Down, Twilight) and Cung Le (Tekken, Fighting) also star in this intense thriller from Director Christian Alvart (Antibodies).

3968202,5,B002QW7AJY,"Great sci-fi/horror movie. Without spoiling anything: the main characters are two of the flight crew of a colony ship who wake up from cryosleep to take their 5-year shift at the helm. They wake up expecting to take over for flight crew 4, but no one is on the bridge and the computer is offline, so they have no way of knowing how long they've been asleep, other than the fact that extended cryosleep can cause minor memory loss, and they have nearly total amnesia. Also, there are no stars in the blackness beyond the viewport....

This movie paces well between trying to figure out what's going on, the suspense of trying to figure out if either of them have gone crazy, and the horror of trying to survive the creatures that now inhabit the ship. If you liked the claustrophobia and ""monsters on a spaceship"" of Event Horizon, or the hard sci-fi and paranoia Infini, but wish they had less dark endings, you'll love Pandorum.",1441756800,10,929,4.596385542168675

Never really being sure what was real, where we were and who they are? Have I confused you too, now? Good. Try this movie and I think you may like it for the sheer drama of it. Beam me up, Scotty!

3968284,2,B002QW7AJY,"After abusing and overpopulating the Earth, humanity's last gasp at survival is a two-hundred-year trek to uncharted paradise amongst the stars. But while the last survivors of our race wait in cryogenic storage for landfall, gruesome monsters have unexpectedly taken over the deck. This really had the makings of an entertaining little romp - not quite smart enough to be Alien, nor eccentric enough to be Event Horizon - but it falls flat on its face in the follow-through. It's color-by-numbers in all the worst ways, stealing liberally from dozens of sources and robbing them of the intangibles that made them worth taking in the first place. The dialog and acting are downright atrocious, equally pale impersonations of brighter pictures. Dennis Quaid, no stranger to sci-fi stinkbombs, takes the lead as one of the ship's off-kilter captains, and promptly hams it up with an awful Harrison Ford impression. Behind the scenes, the editing is aggressively irritating, confronting every tricky scene with so many jump cuts, I felt close to an epileptic seizure. Even the film's climactic twist, revealed like it were the mother of all mind-blowers, is telegraphed at least an hour earlier and whiffs like a kid at his first tee-ball practice. So much energy and enthusiasm, but nothing more to show for it than a gust of air and a loose sense of embarrassment. Decent creature effects and a strong claustrophobic atmosphere, but that's all I'll give it.",1428883200,,1456,5.070833333333334

There wasn't much I didn't like about Pandorum -- maybe the questioniable CGI in spots, but overall even the animations were acceptable.  Loved the plot twists, especially the swerve near the end.  For a movie that is obviously all imagination, the reasoning and logic used in the story was somewhat believable (contrast that with a movie I wanted to love but didn't, Prometheus).

I guess people now a days are so wrapped up in having everything explained to them, they also hate all the classic movies too. Everyone in this group wants a well developed plot and delivered now. Well I watched this movie and I really got creep-ed out, which I haven't felt since Poltergeist and Aliens. It left a lot unexplained , which was perfect. One is trying to assess a situation after waking up from a deep, deep sleep. Put your self in the persons shoes. I love this movie for its originality, deep space possibilities, deep sleep pods, computer run ship, mankind's development of a society similar to ""Lord of the Flies"" and the human condition.""The Time Machine"" had mutants 800,000 years later. Both previous older classics reveled in what and how humans may evolve if abandoned. In this movie  on a space ship. Very creative and it kept my attention the whole time. I also like Laurel and Hardy, Mickey Rooney, 1940's to 2000 every couple of years occasionally Hollywood puts out a movie worth watching, but its far and fewer every year since 1990. Most of today's movies are all very simple plots. I guess since the Americans vocabulary has gone form 75,000 words in 1940 to 15,000 words today. Simple minds can not use imagination and deductive reasoning to come up with a hypothesis of their own. This film would have done so much better if it was released in 2004 before the start of great recession.",1425427200,2,1474,4.625954198473282

3968317,4,B002QW7AJY,"It looked like this would be a cool kinda scifi horror/thriller.  Do not be mistaken, its not really very scary.  They blow their load in the first 15 or 20 minutes on that one.  Once you see the monster its not as scary.  That is just a fact.  And its especially true if your monster is humanish.  This seems to be an issue in quite a few movies.  Someone needs to learn that scary is the unknown, not the known.  So the movie starts of scary but loses that edge way too soon.

The movie then feels a lot more like a scifi action movie than a thriller.  From then on the movie feels a lot more like Aliens than Alien.  That's not a bad thing, the movie never feels dull, it keeps a nice pace and once the third act rolls around we get an interesting couple of twists before the end.

I'd recommend this film if your looking for something with an action edge to it. If your looking for a good scary movie, this one really doesn't cut it.",1424217600,,937,4.087912087912088

The story involves the crew of a spaceship and an extremely creepy, claustrophobic, gradually-escalating situation that isn't at all what it seems. Dennis Quaid, Ben Foster, Cam Gigandet and others swing for the fences and, in my opinion, totally hit this one right out of the park. To say any more would ruin the experience, but this movie offers an unsettling atmosphere, a few high-adrenaline scares, a good amount of action, and an ending you won't necessarily see coming.

Along the way he comes across a few other people that also woke up and a bunch of monsters.  That is the basic plot without spoiling anything and i liked it because it kept coming at you with something different threat-wise.  The main thing that sticks with me is that it explains everything by the end in a way that left me satisfied like i can believe that.  The people are all dirty like they've been surviving really added to realism to get you into things.  Although there is a man and woman struggling and fighting together there isn't some forced love story that slows everything down and ruins the horror atmosphere.

3968434,1,B002QW7AJY,"I gave this film the biggest try I could give it, and that was watching it till the end. ""Pandorum"" is a film that desperately attempts to give sci fi fans quick entertainment,  and quickly fails. A very plastic looking set , even more plastic looking ""aliens"" and a dull script are on the short list of  failings for this dime a dozen ""terror in space"". The ever talented Dennis Quaide works with what he has but his abilities are wasted in this poorly enacted story aimed at the ""anything with horror in space"" crowd.

Continually dark scenes aboard the spacecraft strive to atmospherically compensate for a story that doesn't hold enough interest for the viewer to care to figure out. The film is not exactly complicated or deep, it's just a bore that relies on 90s style scare shots. If your like me you will keep looking for a gratifying sci fi moment to surface, only to realize that you got sucked into watching a film that will be stored in your brain as a forgettable bomb. If you really want a detailed description of the film then read the Amazon hyped review somewhere above, otherwise what I've shared with you should be enough of a decision maker for introspective fans of the genre.

3968444,4,B002QW7AJY,"Thanks to my wall size TV I can enjoy a cinematic experience from the comfort of my own sofa within walking distance of my magnificent fridge with the ice bin that holds 10 lbs of ice.  That means I save the sneeze fest emporium for the 3D Imax experience of such movies as ""Avatar,"" ""Grravity"" and the eagerly anticipated ""Godzilla.""  That also means movies don't have to be blockbuster hits to entertain me.  So movies that are a few years old are still new to me and most weekends feature one or two films that I normally wouldn't waste my time on.  Weekends are made for ""Pandorum.""

Apparently ""Pandorum"" is one of a trilogy.  The other 2 have not come out and yet it's been alleged that ""Elysium"" might have been a prequel which makes no sense.  ""Elysium"" just kind of sucked.  Reviews on the intertubes for ""Pandorum"" include such ditties as ""50 reasons 'Pandorum' sucks.""  But I disagree.  There are true stinkers like ""Enigma"" which are just too poorly written and imagined to believe that anyone could possibly care about any of the characters.  There are fun movies, like ""The Divide"" in which you must suspend belief from the opening scene when the heroine looks directly at a nuclear explosion and yet does not go blind and then strange plot twists are offered not to move the story forward but to explain an ending that requires no explanation.

This is like that.  In so many ways.  But it's not in your face.  We don't know how long  they've been ""stranded"" but apparently long enough that the last candy bar was taken out of the last vending machine and yet everyone is at peak health.  The ending does nicely explain why they're in the predicament they're in which is a ship of 5000 souls sent to inhabit a new world on which something has occurred throwing a wrench into their plans.  Apparently being in hyper sleep makes you crazy.

The film opens with one of our heroes coming out of hyper sleep and waking into a nightmare in which nothing works and someone or something wants him dead.  Lots of action and tension, lots of questions both answered and unanswered, with a satisfying ending that ties up a lot of those loose ends and which the last scene could very well be the first scene in the sequel which I will gladly wait",1397952000,2,2249,4.5334987593052105

This is a cleverer, and scarier movie than I had expected. The story is quite good with a genuinely unexpected twist in the end and enough left up to interpretation to prompt re-watching and lively discussion. I also love that they decided to use tension to build scares instead of purely jump scares or an over-reliance on gore.

The whole premise of humans evolving/adapting to the ship over an elongated period of time to the point of featuring welding-torch tails and spitting oil was a bit far-fetched for me, but it makes for a pretty intimidating foe, which I guess is really the point.

There were two twists at the end, one I saw coming a mile away (but my boyfriend did not. Lol) and another that surprised even me.

3968502,4,B002QW7AJY,"The premise of this movie is that something goes awry on a gigantic interstellar sleeper ship, launched in 2174, which is on a 123 journey. Early in the 'flight', the crew finds out that human civilization on Earth will not survive, and all depends on the success of their mission. Thereafter, the mystery unfolds when a crew member awakes to his shift from hyper-sleep to an apparently derelict ship, slowly regaining his hyper-sleep attenuated memories while he tries to determine what has transpired. Why is the ship apparently powered down and what has happened to the 60000 souls still in hypersleep?

Even though this movie extends a bit into the horror genre, I really wanted this movie to work scientifically because we rarely see meaningfully thought out first-interstellar expedition type movies. The major issue with this movie is the requirement for the average viewer's cognitive estrangement from the scientific inconsistencies. Lets consider the time frame. (caution: there may be spoilers implied by the analysis below) It occurs too early to make sense. Lets work backwards from 2174 when the ship was launched. The ship was launched based on a probe reporting that the planet Tanis was supporting life. If the ship were on a 123 year trip, and presuming the fastest achievable flight technology by that time, perhaps an average 5% speed of light, then Tanis is likely within 6-7 light years. Add 6-7 years (for the probe to report back) to the 123 year journey for the probe and subtract that period from 2174, and we get 2044-2045 as the launch date for the probe. However, this neglects that the ship couldn't have been built and launched instantly in 2174, so likely the probe reported back perhaps in the 2150s to early 2160s. So, the probe was launched perhaps in 2025-2030? At the end of 2013, we are still barely able to get a probe to Mars, requiring a slow transit of months or years. It is not likely we could launch an interstellar probe at 5% light speed within the next two to three decades. In order for this story to work, practically, it would need to take place much further into the future. This also neglects that we probably won't have the telescopes to detect the possibility of an Earth like planet earlier than perhaps 2030. This time frame issue is the same failing of AVATAR and PROMETHEUS. If one does the math, both AVATAR and PROMETHEUS must more likely occur in a more distant future than portrayed in the respective movies. Directors/writers can't be ignorant of this, so, one presumes there is reluctance in the movie industry about portraying the far distant future?

Neglecting the transit time frame concerns, lets consider energy. A 60000 person interstellar ship traveling at an average 5% light speed would require an enormous amount of energy to achieve and slow from that average speed, not to mention the smaller, but still substantial energy to maintain hyper-sleep life support and crew functions, as well as the energy needed to fend off bits of dust and asteroids along the flight path. The amount of energy required is probably in excess of what human civilization could likely allocate at that early time (next 150 years) in the future. We might not expect successful fusion reactors for at least another 50-100 years, and even with that technology, it would still be challenging. A fast (at least several percent light speed) interstellar probe will likely not be launched for at least 100 years. A practical interstellar sleeper ship could be more than 1000 years off.

There are few stars within 6-7 light years, and except for the Alpha Centauri A and B, are brown or red dwarfs, and, currently, there seems to be no possibility of an Earth-like exoplanet around any of them. Had this story taken place in the more distant future, with the possibility of a much longer transit time than 123 years, then, many more distant star destinations would have been possible, with the much greater likelihood of speculating on an Earth-like ""Tanis"", better preserving the suspension of disbelief of the viewer. The screenwriters should have permitted themselves to consider a transit time of thousands of years. This would have also permitted the human evolutionary twists to make more sense. They also wouldn't have needed to suggest a probe mission in advance. Within 100-200 years, or earlier, telescope technology will be advanced enough to image and identify Earth-like exoplanets planets with life.

The ship has gravity, apparently 1G. It could have gravity if it were either constantly accelerating or decelerating at 1G, but only along the length of the ship, not the width. We later find out why the ship has 1G gravity, but its presence and direction should have tipped off the passengers and crew as to the location of the ship.  The presence of gravity was a troubling telegraph of an aspect of the end of the movie.

Other than this, I liked the movie. It had a tad more gore than it needed, but it was worth seeing. The movie would have likely worked better without quite as much violence. Dennis Quaid was perhaps miscast slightly, and underutilized in his role. Perhaps this was really a script and direction issue, since I expected a bit more from his character, which I didn't sense was properly balanced with the scheme of the movie. Some of the outcome becomes predictable.

I understand a sequel is being considered, and I would choose to see it if the director and writers depart more from the ship based locked room horror of the plot. It would be nice to see how the survivors fare on this new planet.",1387497600,,5584,4.853095487932844

3968527,3,B002QW7AJY,"Christian Alvarts Pandorum is a typical science fiction thriller on the surface; however, upon closer review, it reveals a myriad of evolutionary themes. The film follows the flight crew (Dennis Quaid, Ben Foster) on a Noahs Ark themed ship, which we learn has departed from an overpopulated Earth with an ideal population sample to restart life on a new habitable planet. The trip is supposed to take 123 years, so the pilots must take shifts where the off duty officers are in hyper sleep along with the other passengers. When the protagonists awake to discover something has gone awry, they encounter a new cannibalism practicing - human-like species that has taken over the ship.

Though this film does not need to be viewed with a critical eye to be enjoyed, one can uncover the aforementioned ideas. A culturally appropriate depiction of overpopulation connects to the contemporary ideas of depleting resources. Next, eugenics and artificial selection are featured prominently through the choice of humans determined to be the only hope of a future for the race. What Pandorum lacks in character depth, it greatly compensates for in these areas and I highly recommend it to any fan of the genre.",1386288000,2,1201,5.035175879396985

So, the two decide to get to the bottom of this mystery, only to discover that they're not alone on the ship, and if they can't find a way to the ship's bridge, they'll be dead before they can even call for help.

Directed and co-written by Christian Alvert, Pandorum is advertised as a sci-fi horror film, but really it works more like a grotesque, sci-fi/psychological thriller. Alvert's directing here is very rich and intense, helping shape the eerie and foreboding atmosphere that is the ship Elysium. The dark corridors and bleak light scheme all help to bring about that sense of dread and fear, with loneliness playing a key role as well. The visual effects, while in a couple places are just decent (the Reactor turning back on), was overall incredibly impressive and award-worthy, especially the very first shot of Elysium not three minutes into the movie. The acting was superb, especially from Ben Foster and Antje Traue. Foster plays Bower, and Traue is another individual aboard Elysium who offers assistance is saving the ship. Dennis Quaid was great as Payton, but when Cam Gigandet shows up, things go insane. He's an alright actor with some very poor roles (Never Back Down, The Unborn, Twilight), but he shows his acting chops in A-Grade form here, playing the mentally scarred Corporal Gallo, who mysteriously managed to get off the ship's bridge when it was locked down. The musical score was very impressive, sounding like a mix of Han Zimmer's The Ring and Joseph Bishara's Dark Skies. The script was very good, too, but the amount of gory violence may be off-putting for some movie-goers. While I don't mind gore in a movie (unless it's excessive, like the Saw sequels), they could have had less gore in Pandorum and it would have been great still. But it also did help because, when you see it in context with what's happening, the animalistic nature of it is frightening and effective.

Pandorum is a truly mesmerizing experience that takes us into the unknown (literally), and what we find is something so unimaginable, it will haunt us forever. We don't know what the effects of deep-space travel will have on us, or what is really out there in the dark void. All we know, is that one day, we will have to make a choice that will affect all of humanity for better or worse. Also, there is surprisingly room for a sequel, so hopefully someone from the crew of Pandorum steps up and uses Kickstarter to green-light it since it's worked for Spike Lee and the Veronica Mars movie.

I find these words from Carl Sagan, to be very true and very relevant. ""The sky calls to us. If we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to the stars.""

3968548,4,B002QW7AJY,"Wow, read some harsh reviews! Many of you missed your calling to become professional critics.  Just sit down and enjoy it for daring to be different. All about expectations. It's actually a film not about aliens. That's just one reason to like it.

Gallo/Payton was a very intense struggle. Two minds battling for control. Finally you learn his dark secret. The cruelty he inflected on his crew. On the whole ship. The extent of his mental breakdown. One of the parts I liked the best. Cam did a wonderful job here protraying Gallo's character. You really felt what Gallo went through. I almost felt sorry for him. Almost..

Bower learned how to take control. When he lost contact with his ""C.O"" it was a key point in the movie. Payton had kept Bower because he was the ""boy scout"", always following orders. You learn in the beginning Bower was ""especially selected"". Payton corrected his mistake after by adding they were all especially selected. At the end Bower asserted himself from Payton. Finally not taking orders.

Leland was just someone who had spend way to much time by himself. Don't want to know what the green stuff was on the walls. Wish we could've known more about his history. Perhaps he learned what had happened from pre-dinner conversation with fellow crew members? He seemed to have learned his eating habits from the mutants.  He definitely made the story more dramatic.

Mutants were scary enough, thank you. Crunching, disembowling.. Blood oozing from their mouths after a meal. WHATEVER, that's enough for me. The whole cannibal thing. The whole ""watch where you step"" wearing what looked like peeled off human skin. The sitting in a human disposal pond.

I think what I loved the best was Bower's character. You could really relate to what he was going through. He fumbled and made mistakes like any normal person would. He was not afraid to admit he didn't know what the hell he was doing. He went from the obedient puppy to a more assertive, leader role. With a little humour that always helps. When he used to crowd control gun on Nadia and Manh was funny. It was like when kids are fighting and you flash the lights on and off to get their attention. And when he finally gets sick and tired of Nadia beating on him.

I loved the movie and currently waiting for it in the mail from Amazon.",1376438400,,2319,4.666666666666667
3968549,3,B002QW7AJY,"This was a better than average sci-fi movie with a good premise. That said the movie did not break any new ground as far as the story goes.  A Noah's Arc ship sent from an over populated and exhausted resource planet earth is sent to a very distant earth like plant to save the human race. The ship has suffered some type of malfunction with a few crew members and passengers awake to attempt to save the ship and its crew from certain death. Crew members suffer from some type of ailment while battling a unknown life force thats attacking them and impeding their attempts to repair the ship. This is a generalization of the story to limit giving away to much info. I think that you get the picture and the jest of the story and how its the industry standard template for space, sea and land movies. The acting ranges from fair to good with so...so character development and written to be vague as far as the characters history goes and the same can be said of the creatures and their history. Some detail is given about the creatures, but it is a hypothesis given by crew members who have been awake the longest. I found all the vagueness with the crew and creatures history a little disappointing and limits the story. It could have been a much better story with more creative writing instead of what was written. The direction lacked some of the same creativity as well and was evident in the end product. Many people raved about this movie and thats good, but I was left wanting a more creative and detailed story than what I got. Was it better than average? Yes, but not by much. Was it worth the time to watch? Yes. Will I watch it again? Mabe at a later date. 3.4 stars.

3968553,4,B002QW7AJY,"Pandorum is a well conceived space based horror story beautifully presented in blu-ray. With constantly building terror, quick scares, and a healthy dose of graphic violence Pandorum delivers on all the dominant horror elements. The science fiction story is limited while coherent, but primarily only present to create the enclosed isolated space necessary for the horror aspects to come into being. The blu ray itself is an excellent transfer, with the omnipresent dark scenes coming through with inky blacks and subtle contrast that will reward a well calibrated display.

In fact, I must give Ben Foster some credit for playing a role so totally different than his character in ""Six Feet Under"".  It's been a long time since we've seen Dennis Quaid in something good, too.  The plot has it's own twists and isn't nearly as derivative as the cinemetography is.",1372118400,,420,4.791666666666667

Rarely is he somewhere in-between. This is one of those times. Take him out and put another actor in his place and you have one of the all-time greatest sci-fi movies. Prometheus by comparison, is a long running, expensive joke. I guessed the plot of this movie about a third of the way in. But it's still a thriller to the end. Leaves you wanting more or a sequel.

Scary and suspenseful with only a necessary and sufficient gore level. Though I'm a very amateur judge of this (I could barely name you the actors, if asked), I'd say the acting and dialogue are at least above average for the genre. Set design and ambiance similar to Aliens. The only mild criticism that comes to mind, though not during the movie since I was on the edge of my seat, is that few elements of the set or plot struck me as very original. Maybe that's an occupational hazard for sci-fi lovers and novelty seekers. Nevertheless an 'A-movie' in my book!",1370649600,,681,4.636363636363637
3968572,4,B002QW7AJY,"Of course,  there is a generic similarity to innumerable other space odysseys, but, nonetheless, this is likely to be an entertaining interlude for the average viewer, whether or not addicted to this kind of science fiction. Director and actors, with considerable help from the technical designers, make this voyage with the last  earth-people in existence, just that extra bit different to save it from the junk yard into which so many have fallen. No exciting shots of man in the universe, no dazzling displays of modern electronic eye-candy, just people within what is best described as the inside of a modern skyscraper's basement. Lots of fighting with, somehow, a Vietnamese warrior to enliven the proceedings. I suppose someone on the creative crew or among the producers was a Vietnam era draft-age protester.
It is a decent although not WOW movie.",1369094400,,856,5.107142857142857
3968573,5,B002QW7AJY,"If ""Descent"" and ""Alien"" had a baby it would be Pandorum.  Alternating creepy and tense with blast action, and a nice twisty end, great flick.",1368921600,,142,4.68
3968583,5,B002QW7AJY,"I won't sum up the plot here as you can read the description above and I don't want to give any spoilers... BUT this movie is fantastic! If you like the original 1979 Alien or The Fly or Event Horizon, or any Sci-Fi Thriller, this is the movie for you!

The cast is incredible and Ben Foster easily steals the show with a spot on performance as Bower, the film's protagonist. I can't say enough about his acting- I remember him from a disney show that used to run when I was younger, Flash Forward, needless to say, he has come a long way.

The plot: Creative, ostensibly Sci-Fi, cerebral. It is a blast!

Pacing: This movie builds tension into a free-fall of terror and action that doesn't stop until the credits roll. A very good job at pacing. The editing in this film is damn near perfect.

Acting: As I mentioned above, it is top notch; Ben Foster stands out, for sure, but Dennis Quaid delivers an expectedly solid performance as well.

Cinematography: Gorgeous. It isn't the rich colors and wide shots of the Lord of the Rings movies but instead a decidedly cramped, closed, and dark view with a very gritty blue hue. In short, the cinematography is not only incredible, but it is perfectly fit for atmosphere of this movie.

Special effects: This is where it is hit or miss. There are some... ""Characters"" that should not have been touched with CGI near as much as they were and thus some scenes suffer from sub-par CGI. I am not a fan of CGI when used to fully render an entire character or scene I tend to like it best when used to enhance a live action sequence. Regardless, the CGI is not bad enough to render the film obsolete or laughable, just a stylisic preference really. That being said, there are some awesome effects too. Without spoilers, I'll just say there are some very awesome gore scenes and a few technical shots with water that will blow you away.

Overall, this is a great flick if you enjoy the genre. I highly recommend it.",1367798400,2,1954,4.456582633053221

Totally felt like a Walter White-Jesse Pinkman dynamic (and Barrow even looked like Aaron Paul at times!) But seriously - well done film, which appropriately balanced suspense and plot twists with a healthy dose of human psychology and the perils and uncertainty of hypothetical space travel. The increasing dread of the dangers on board corresponds perfectly with the slowly revealed details of what has and will happen on the ship. Unlike so many other films of the genre, it doesn't have just one key plot twist at the end but all throughout; it also succeeds in getting to understand the psychological motivations of characters, even when their appearance in the film is relatively brief.

The story takes place on board of the giant spaceship ""Elysium"", which was send in XXII century in the first interstellar manned mission in history, towards an Earth-like exoplanet called Tanis, which without any doubt harbors life. The voyage will take 123 years, so most of ""Elysium"" passengers hibernate during the travel - successive teams crewmen are awakened and then put to sleep again, each giving two years of their lifetime for the travel. This film tells the story of the fifth shift. It begins when lieutenant Payton (Denis Quaid) and corporal Bower (Ben Foster) wake up, just to realize that their predecessors are not there, that the ship is damaged, that they can not raise anybody on the interphone and that SOMETHING is roaming the corridors outside. After this rather uncomfortable start they will have to figure out what the heck happened and what to do next, beginning with finding a way to exit the chamber in which they woke up...)))

Those are the first two-three minutes of film and about the rest I will say no more, but let's stress it again - the scenario is pretty solid and certainly original. I watched the DVD in one go, because the story is really interesting and the tension and uncertainty are maintained until the end. The interiors of the ""Elysium"" are pretty well designed and even if light is scarce during most of the film (a pretty clever idea by the way) we quickly realise that this thing is ENORMOUS. The difficult and perilous trek through the gigantic spaceship reminded me a little of classical Brian Aldiss SF novel ""Non-stop"" (but just to be clear, here the solution of the mystery is different than in this book).

Now, this film has also some elements which make it rather impossible to rate it five stars. The exact nature of SOMETHING that roams the corridors is one of them. It gives the occasion to some honest action scenes, but frankly, to my personal taste it pulled this film down a little. Also, the idea that in XXII century Earth will have a human population of 24 billion people and therefore will not be able to sustain human life anymore, now pleeaaaase, this is such a cliche...

But those weaker elements notwithstanding I liked this film a lot, much, much more than I expected and I believe it is one of the best and most original SF B-movies of those last years. Recommended wholeheartedly to all SF aficionados!",1354492800,,2587,4.742222222222222

If you are a sci-fi or horror fan you will absolutely love this one. The story is great! A complete multi-leveled script with many varying ideas that will leave you guessing. Stuck on a ship in the middle of space with no power and no idea of what their mission is or was. Two flight crew members must piece together just what is happening and how. All while trying to ward off the Pandorum, a brain altering space psychosis. I'll stop there as anything else might ruin this rampant tale of sci-fi action. Other than the story, the action is great! It coincides with the extreme isolation and suspense created by the setting and plot. Other reviewers complained about the story, lighting and fast cut scenes. Any complaints about the story are just ludicrous. Those individuals weren't sci-fi fans because the story is fantastic, period. The lighting is not nearly as bad as reviewed by some. I have seen FAR worse lighting in movies. This lighting was good and was appropriate for the setting. The cut scenes, though, are a little fast at times and can be distracting, but there aren't so many of them that it takes away from the film.

3968654,4,B002QW7AJY,"Films like this, Event Horizon, The Descent, or any film that, on the surface, looks to be nothing more than a trite and shallow straight-to-bargain-bin pointless sci-fi ripoff of better films, seem to always get the short end of the stick with critics, invariably, for the aforementioned reason: All they look for is what's in front of them, not what's *actually* happening as the story unfolds and we realize more and more exactly what's going on, until everything coalesces and creates something truly beautiful, original, and intelligent.

What most will probably see, as critics decided to focus on, is nothing more than a cheap gore-fest with monsters and a whole lot of amnesia with a tacked-on plot that doesn't sound interesting to begin with. Well, if you only watch this film a single time without knowing what you're getting into and not expecting anything more, that's what you'll see, too.

But just like Event Horizon and every other very violent film that's loaded with psychological themes and a *WHAM* of a twist ending, along with a lasting impression to those who like these sorts of films, critics are so distracted by how seemingly shallow it all is, which is only enforced by the fact that they simply aren't paying attention to anything else that's happening, or the philosophical tie-ins that go with it. Event Horizon had this in spades, particularly with the main protagonist and antagonist, making it something you either hated as being stupid--as critics did--or saw it as something else, as I and some others did, as being, dare I say it--brilliant and profound. Event Horizon remains a film that is typically either known for ""cheap and stupid scare tactics with a shallow plot and extremely excessive violence"" or ""psychological mindf*** of the century that never makes sense no matter how many times I watch it"" to pretty much everyone.

The point here is that Pandorum, while not as enjoyable to me as Event Horizon because the monsters look too much like the ones in The Descent (one of my favorite films, at least the original version), is an extremely competent sci-fi psychological thriller that uses its plot and setting to wonderful effect, tying it directly into the characters, rather than superimposing it onto them. Watch it once, you'll see lots of violence and a twist that'll leave you wondering what the hell you just watched the entire time, since now nothing makes any sense at all. But watch it again, and it all comes together as something very highly deserving of your attention.

The fact remains that critics just don't like these types of films. There's already a massive list of what some people call ""cult films"", but I just call them ""underrated because they step outside most peoples' comfort zones."" As far as I'm concerned, critics should be completely ignored, as they often just don't know what they're talking about, rushing through film after film and writing review after review, not needing to think too hard about what they just saw. Hence, we get Oscar-fishers every year getting all the attention, one of the most noteworthy being the horrifyingly-racist-in-retrospect ""Crash"", a film completely out of touch with reality that was praised for portraying the exact opposite; and absolutely ""A Beautiful Mind"", which was an almost 100% fictitious account of both schizophrenia and John Nash's life, very obviously designed as an Oscar-fisher that succeeded in its exclusive goal of winning Oscars, despite failing disastrously to portray mental illness, John Nash, or absolutely anything it says it represents at all correctly. Note one of the most important similarities of the two films: Both involve taking a touchy subject (racism in the former and mental illness, as well as the mental healthcare system, in the latter) and exploiting it, while in actuality, is a completely unrealistic and insensible portrayal of anything it says it's ""revealing"".

To put it short, most movie-watchers turn their brains off when the film starts, which does not exclude films that claim to do the opposite and ""make you think"". That's why films like Pandorum get practically zero attention and virtually no positive reception while trash like A Beautiful Mind gets accolades all around. Pandorum is actually more accurate in its portrayal of the effects of mental illness (even a fictitious one, but still one that makes sense as one that could exist and its reasons for existing at all) than A Beautiful Mind, which took schizophrenia and turned it into nothing more than fun entertainment, glossing over any real portrayal of the illness.

Kinda makes you wonder. Still, when a fictitious condition like pandorum makes more sense than schizophrenia does in the exploitative A Beautiful Mind, you should know something is seriously wrong with the critics who maintain the rights to say which films are good or not, despite understanding nothing about the source matter.

Highly recommended, especially on Blu-ray, on which it looks gorgeous.",1339286400,,5001,5.0840438489646775
3968655,3,B002QW7AJY,"I'm started to get a bit concerned for lovers of Sci-Fi: Is extreme and gruesome violence the only way for Hollywood to tell a decent story? First District 9, then Gamers, now Pandorum. I'm really tired of having to close my eyes through a good portion of each Sci-Fi film I watch. Three Sci-Fi movies in a row is the beginning of a trend, and an annoying one at that!

On the plus side: The will to survive is palpable in Pandorum. As is the drive to never give-up, absolutely, no matter, what! Despite every conceivable obstacle, our hero's fight to the bitter end to accomplish the impossible. On one level this story is about finding allies and displaying the ultimate courage a human being is capable expressing. The only reason why Pandorum gets 3 stars instead of zero! If you're timing to close your eyes is as good as mine, you might even leave the theater thanking whatever deity you worship for being reminded of the existence of people in the real world who are like the heroes in Pandorum!

3968658,2,B002QW7AJY,"A couple of space farers wake out of ""hypersleep"" (most of us would use the term ""cryogenic"" but given that the author clearly failed highschool science class, this is nit picking). It is shortly established that they are brain damaged from their long hibernation.... and the plot and writing go rapidly down hill from there.

There are carnivorous monsters on board and shortly after you see them, you pretty much know where they came from, long before the ""shocking"" expostulation.
Upon hearing it, you are left with the choice of blaming the exedition planners or the screenplay writer for smoking way too much crack.

The ship (the primary antagonist for too much of the film) is designed with such a breath-taking lack of common sense that it must have been designed by a congressional committee. Note that the bulkhead doors trap you if the power goes out (unless a monster wants to get through one, then it just pushes open). Preciesly what you want in an emergency, everyone trapped behind a bulkhead so they can't fix the problem, unless there's a hull breach on the other side and then the doors just open.
On the fun side you can run your computer systems for hours with a few spins of a hand crank (makes you wonder why you even need a nuclear reactor to run the ship when hand cranks work so well - better to peddle your way to the stars).

At one point you get to see the exterior of the ship itself and then the reason for the design issues become clear... the architechts were clearly vetrans of ""hypersleep""..... way too much hypersleep.

And All of this is forgivable if the plot hangs together.... not really.
Cliced mistakes that make you wince over and over and wonder whether you should care if anyone survives this poorly concieved flight. And then they make sure that you don't just near the end.

Great Actors and direction. Great special effects and hence two stars.
(Note - no subtractions for wasting talents like Dennis Quaid and the others who actually contributed here.... and there were many, more's the pity.)

Ben Foster is great in that he exudes raw aggravated attention, fear and determination. The dark and dungy ship succeeds in setting an even more ominous tone for the movie. Pandorum also has a quite satisfying ending too which is a relief after almost two hours of nail biting horror. The movie is very effective when watched alone very late at night in the dark.

The Blu-Ray version is a definite improvement over the regular DVD. The picture is very much improved, and lots of details emerge in more highly lit scenes. Meanwhile, the audio is spectacular compared to the regular DVD version.

The disc itself arrived on time- I have Prime. It was in a bubblepak  mailer envelope. When I first inserted the disc it loaded as expected and played, but there was no audio. I tried FFWD'ing and jumping chapters. I removed and inspected the disc; it looked pristine. I tried another Blu-Ray disc; it had audio fine. Finally, I cleaned the Pristine Pandorum disc anyway. That did the trick. It must of had some post manufacturing film or such on it. As always, Amazon had an unbeatable price.

Without giving much away they all had to whisper a lot but that should not mean we should not be able to hear clearly. To the makers of this movie I say, get into the new century and use quality equipment that allows the audience to hear even whispers. Not rocket science any more. This movie should have had subtitles when Nadia speaks.
That being said it is a pretty original story and carried off very well. The use of not letting you get a real good look at the ""enemy"" too often works well. A technique becoming more and more employed as in Cloverfield.

Attractive token female who is a street fighter (and of course a bug eating eco-biologist when she's not kicking behind)? Check.

Sadly, this could have been a great movie -the story behind it is an intriguing one (though personally the alien like figures didn't need to be there, the enemy could have been within).  However, for me, there are too many ""checklist cheapshots"" that really spoilt the movie for me.  From unbelievable aliens to the spaceship (and sadly not believable in a bad way) I felt opportunities were missed to really make it an engrossing great sci-fi movie.  The characters never really became either loathsome or sympathetic -resulting in a general apathy towards them.

What would you call ""The Descent,"" if it was in outer space? Answer, ""Pandorum.""

""Pandorum"" is about the last spaceship to leave an overpopulated dying Earth, carrying 16,000 humans & every species of life form of Earth, to a new Earth like planet for a second chance of survival of the human species, a ""Noah's Ark"" if you will.

Dennis Quaid & Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma) wake up after a long hyper sleep, with their memories partially intact, because hyper sleep for long periods makes for partial, though temporary amnesia. They try to figure out, where they are, who they are, & where their going? They also find out a disturbing factor, as many of those who were in hyper sleep have woke up & mutated to become compatible with the ship, & they feed on the non mutated living, & are not above of cannibalism them selves, when the opportunity arises! These mutants are tough customers, as they set traps & forming hunting parties, & have super human strength! If that is not enough, many of them have grown spike like armor! They don't die easily.

""Pandorum,"" truly reminds me of ""the Descent,"" in both it's setting, the giant cavernous spaceship serving as the cave. The mutants, who sound, move, & look quite a bit like the creatures in ""The Descent,"" & just the general over all editing & direction of the film. One could say there is a ""Alien"" connection too, but that really is only because of the space setting & situation of survival.

I was very impressed with this film when I first saw it, as the critics mostly crucified this movie. Upon second viewing, I was still as impressed. ""Pandorum,"" is a great Sci Fi/Horror film, with lots of action, good special effects, make up, fast pacing, a genuinely eerie setting, & a twist ending, that is truly twisted! It's acting, editing, & the cannibalistic inhabitants of the ship, make for a great ride!

""Pandorum"" is no ""Descent,"" earthly or not, but it's better than ""The Descent: Part 2"" light years! Pick up this, & forget about ""the Descent: Part 2.""

Examples being all the scenes with the cook character or the sub-plot with Bowers wife.  The monsters where not scary in the least and it wasn't hard to figure out their twist.

3968681,4,B002QW7AJY,"Pandorum was a nice surprise.  I hadn't heard of it but really enjoyed it and would watch it again.  The story begins as a man wakes up on a spaceship bound on a hundred year voyage from an overpopulated earth to a distant planet which can support life.  Suspended animation has given the man temporary memory loss which wears off with time.  He knows he is a member of the flight crew, and finds one other crew man.  As his memories come back, the man tries to find other members of the flight crew, and to determine just what is off about the spaceship.  As it turns out, a lot is off.  Strange human-like creatures roam the ship, and they like to eat anything they can find, and the generator at the core of the spaceship seems to be failing as there are intermittent brown outs.  Soon the man encounters other people awake from suspended animation.  Together they try to survive the strange creatures that want to eat them and to determine what has gone wrong with the ship and where they are in their voyage.

The story unfolds really well.  The film was moody and even though I kind of saw plot points coming, I didn't see clearly enough to get bored, and there were unpredictable and well-done tangents into the lives of the few people in the story. Best of all, the movie had a good ending.  That's important.

Sci-Fi movies are a touchy genre, a lot of times they get too bogged down in science jargon and technical terms that most normal people don't use in everyday life. Sci-Fi/Horror films are even touchier, too many rely on violence and no explanation (""Event Horizon"" anyone?) and like that film the idea of being stranded in deep space has been done so many times before, (see The ""Alien"" films).

""Pandorum"" is set in the way distant future and opens on a ship that has been sent out to find a suitable alternative to Earth, cause our planet is basically dead. One man awakens from deep suspended animation on the ship and at first has no clue who he is or why he's on the ship. He finds his name is Bower (Ben Foster, ""3:10 to Yuma"", ""The Punisher"") and soon after another man awakens Payton (Dennis Quaid, ""The Rookie"", ""Your's, Mine & Our's"") and both try to find out why they're on the ship and why the power is running low.

The early reels build some suspense and soon Bower realizes they're not alone on the ship. There are a bunch of creatures, that have been hunting and killing any living humans on the ship. Payton sends Bower out to the reactivate the reactor at the center of the ship. The rest of the film has Bower avoiding the creatures and making his way to the reactor. Along the way he meets a couple of other people a woman named Nadia (Antje Traue) and a guy named Manh (Cung Lu, ""Fighting""). Both of them join Bower, Nadia more reluctantly.

Unlike a lot of films from this genre, ""Pandorum"" actually has plenty of suspense and a few good scares, even if the movie is overall fairly predictable. The acting is well, average for the most part, though Foster and Quaid are pretty good, given the material. One thing to note is Traue is way, way and I mean way hot.

Overall a great movie, watch and enjoy. *** out of 4 stars.",1317859200,,1862,4.419825072886297

3968697,5,B002QW7AJY,"To qualify a review, it is often helpful to know a bit about the reviewer. I am a 40 something male, technical professional, former engineer, military historian (amateur), science fiction lover, future-war fiction afficionado (Tom Clancy, et.al), and I dig a good romance. I play an occasional mainstream survival-horror video game.

My opinion is that this movie was very entertaining to watch.  I have not read many other reviews posted here, so I am not choosing a camp.

I liked mainly the concept of what the colony ship was, and the interesting premise of the scenario confronting the crew. It is clear that the plot was very specifically intended to be confusing until the situation reveals itself. I can certainly see that someone might be a bit overwhelmed by that, but it should be understood that was the POINT. So, if you DO feel overwhelmed, it worked. And if you turn the movie off before the very end, you'll NEVER get it.  People are, by culture, extremely impatient.

The movie is a combination of Alien, Memento, Fight Club, and any of the zombie films, real psycho-horror.  I am a sucker for heavy sci-fi which this certainly is.  I also like that it is a microcosm of evolution and survival of the fittest (though it is easy to question the logic of the situation, it is what it is, and who is to say what is reasonable) but some of the continuity may not hold up to scrutiny very well. I can't say too much more without spoiling it, but, there are many, many parts of the movie that would require explanation, that aren't explained.  But that is what makes it art. Just because there IS an explanation for it doesn't mean we understand it, and have the correct explanation, much like our own existence.

It would be interesting to see a movie that continued the story.",1310342400,,1789,4.636075949367089
3968698,4,B002QW7AJY,"I'm not saying that this movie is a five star masterpiece, nor am I saying that if you happen to like it someone might ""pity you"". It falls in between, and it's a welcome addition to a genre that is increasingly running out of steam.

The tired sci-fi/horror genre gets a shot in the arm with Pandorum. You have two very good actors cast as our leads-Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid. You have a dark, dank, creepy spaceship (NASA ran short of their light-bulb budget at some point). You have rabid alien/mutant things terrorizing our protagonists.

Unfortunately, you also have a token eye-candy ninja woman; a friendly but ultimately expendable warrior-man; and your obligitory rat-fink jerk who at every turn tries to sell out our heroes but for some odd reason they still let him tag along. Had the movie been left to just Foster and Quaid, it would have been much, much better.

Bowen (Foster) is violently woken from hyper-sleep on a space ship bound for the planet Tanis. See, we humans have pretty much wrecked Earth, so we need to colonize another planet so we can wreck that one too. Bowen has no memory of who he is, why he is there and what he's supposed to be doing. Temporary memory loss is a side-effect of extended suspended animation. Right away things seem wrong. No one else on his team is anywhere to be found. The power comes in fits and starts, and the door leading to the bridge has been locked from the outside. Shortly after, his senior officer Payton (Quaid) wakes up. Memory slowly begins to trickle back. They are part of flight crew team five, and it's their two year rotation shift. But where is team four? For that matter, where is the rest of team five? Bowen climbs out a vent duct in an effort to try to unlock the door, while Payton can only sit helplessly as Bowen is forced to contend with monsters, fellow crew mates and a reactor that is ready to blow.

As if this weren't enough, there is a chance each of them has Pandorum, a psychotic disfunction that sometimes drives astronauts insane. Think of it as the bends in space.

The first forty-five minutes of the movie are fantastic. It's gloomy, intense and frightening. Bowen keeps tripping over bodies and runs into some nasty alien/monster baddies. Things fall apart a bit when Bowen meets up with other passengers on board the ship. It feels like these characters were placed there because they had to be. Another baffling issue is why the ship's armory has only whimpy anti-riot pulse guns, yet ninja woman and friendly warrior guy are wielding massive pole-arms and samuari swords. And where did they learn to use these weapons? This is not explained.

One of the best features of the movie is that it feeds us bits and pieces of information, and we're solving the mystery along with Bowen and Payton. Where did the flesh-eating monsters come from? How long has the ship been out there? Why is the ship waking people prematurely? Where is everyone? And are Bowen and Payton experiencing any of these things, or are they slipping into paranoid Pandorum madness?

A few nice twists and turns along the way builds the suspense and gives the movie more depth of plot than most films of its kind. Foster and Quaid give convincing performances as haggard, frightened men who can't trust their own sanity. The monsters are savage, ugly and utterly ruthless. The ship just feels like one giant tomb. The gloom and despair are palpable at some points.

I wasn't expecting to like Pandorum, but I was pleasantly surprised. Hopefully you will be too.",1309132800,,3530,4.663987138263666
3968699,4,B002QW7AJY,"I was expecting this to be very similar to Event Horizon, which got me to watch it but not necessarily to be excited about it.  I actually ended up liking it quite a bit, although I was a bit dismayed that I recognized most of the scenes I liked best from Eden Log, a low-budget French sci-fi/horror flick from 2007.  This movie is better than Eden Log in some ways (I remember feeling like that one was high on style and not so much on sense), but I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a straight-up remake at some points.

The first half hour or so here is most reminiscent of the game Dead Space -- so much so that I wondered if the producers were just setting up a video game tie-in.  Ben Foster sets out to find out what's going on in the crippled ship while Dennis Quaid stays behind and provides Otacon-like technical support over a comm link that conveniently cuts in and out as the plot requires.  Thankfully, things become less game-like after a while, and both Foster and Quaid get to do some interesting stuff.  There are some decent scares and action scenes as well as genuinely interesting environments, and overall I was happy with the script, the direction, and the acting.

Bottom line: it's not a sci-fi classic, but it's worth watching.  I'd rank it maybe a notch below Aliens and several above Alien 3.

I totally enjoyed it and felt like it was not something I'd seen before. Great visual style and Quaid and Foster are superb. Foster is on a par with Ryan Gosling in my opinion, as one of the best actors of their generation. Along with Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Well, I digress.

They then start to encounter strange beings who turn out to actually be the passengers who have mutated. It seems they have been in their hyper-sleep considerably longer than they realize.

So in a case like this, I'll nearly stay with the original every time. A writer friend of mine recommended Pandorum, he thought I would like it based on the genre of movie I enjoy. This movie is no clone of Alien, I can assure you of that. Pandorum breaks the Alien format, by the team of people against the monstrous entity of the Space Ship growing in numbers as the movie goes on; this is instead of the pick apart one at a time elimination standard of other space horror movies. I don't want to give a plot summary in this review. What I do want to give is an impression to any potential viewer. The monsters in this movie will scare the crap out of you, like a cross between the Alien and the creatures in ""I am legend"" I wouldnt dare to reveal story points, they in fact are the reason to watch Pandorum. However, I myself was slightly disappointed that the creatures aren't better explained. I won't even share my speculation here, its really up to the viewer I think. The relentless dark of the film, and CONSTANT action make way for a surprise ending. You won't believe where everything ends up. The product description by Amazon is right on.

3968714,1,B002QW7AJY,"What is with all the good reviews for this movie?
If people are willing to award 5 stars for such lacklustre rubbish, the studios have no incentive to up their game when it comes to producing and releasing good intelligent sci-fi films.
Now, I'm a big sci-fi fan - always have been of both novels and movies - some of my all time favourite films like the first two Aliens or Bladerunner are science fiction films, so when films like Pandorum are released it really annoys me - especially when you can see that there was a potential to make an interesting and exciting film.

However, what annoys me even more is the huge positive reaction such a film seems able to generate on these pages.

People should re-calibrate their expectations a bit - there is a mine of fantastic sci-fi literature that has barely been touched - novels with much to say on the human condition or society in general or perhaps just a mind-bendingly brilliantly original idea. Pandorum falls so short of these ideals it's embarrassing - most of the film consists of man getting chased down dark corridors by mindless zombies while other man sits in chair with headphones shouting ""what's happening"" over and over again.

If that's your idea of a 5 star film I truly pity you",1302566400,15,1249,4.617117117117117
3968715,5,B002QW7AJY,"If you liked ""Sunshine"" and ""Event Horizon""  and ""Aliens"" then this is definitely a space sci fi horror for you. I only wish there were many many more.",1302220800,2,151,4.392857142857143
3968716,4,B002QW7AJY,"Pandorum was directed by Christian Alvart (who previously directed Case 39) who also co-wrote the story with Travis Milloy. While both of these names are lightweights when it comes to a large history in the film industry Christian's previously reviewed horror film, Case 39, makes a decent argument on why it is worth watching for that reason alone! It's fitting that the film was produced by Paul W.S. Anderson as it has the complete feel of Event Horizon on humanity's turn to evil while out in space.

To be honest science fiction horror is what initially got me into horror. Alien is the first movie that completely sold me on the idea of not only watching a horror movie but completely enjoying it. It's slowly become an addiction consuming my life and it's good to know that it all started back in a movie that was marketed to me exactly how Pandorum was - using science fiction.

The movie starts as we see Bower (Ben Foster) awaken from cryosleep and apparently has no idea what is going on. Soon after Payton (Dennis Quaid) awakens from the tube next to his and we soon discover that extended use of being put into a forced sleep and frozen tends to eat away at your memories and takes time for them to be restored. We spend the introduction of the movie with the two trapped in a room and there clearly being an issue with the power aboard the ship. Bower uses a ventilation and cable shaft in the ceiling to get out of the room and we soon discover even more of the ship is not what they are expecting.

The ship is covered in both traps an what appears to be an alien race that is hunting any humans that are awakened early as pray, think Predator without the cloaking technology. Back in the room Payton is stuck waiting and another crew member, Eden, comes into the room from the same shaft that Bower had left through. While Bower is running for his life trying to avoid the aliens we are given hints at the back story of the ship which roughly translate into Earth being ruined from overpopulation and the ship we are currently watching is an early colonization ship to attempt to colonize a livable planet for mass transport of populations to. At this same time Eden tell us that he is the last member of the previous crew as his two commanding officers ended up suffering from ""Pandorum"" (a space madness that manifests itself in the form of paranoia.)

While the plot itself keeps it from being as well done as either of the first two Alien movies or Event Horizon it is a fun film to watch. If you are a fan of science fiction being mixed in with your horror you won't be disappointed in this one. You may not enjoy it as much as the films I had just mentioned but with how few truly come out this one goes up as one of the better ones. I do have to say that Dennis Quaid absolutely has to be in more horror films after seeing this one. I don't know if it's the ability to look tense or the voice but he can pull off the creepy factor",1301788800,,2954,4.336347197106691
3968717,5,B002QW7AJY,"In all honesty, I had no idea what this movie was about when I bought it. I got it for three or four bucks at a movie store going out of business sale. I snatched up anything that looked like sci-fi or horror or both, because lets face it:it has gotten really hard to tell what will and will not be good in this genres recently. Sure there are obvious losers that tell you 98% of the plot(if you can call it that) in the trailer(s), but the rest get lost in the oversaturation of pure crap that is spewed out every year. I don't mind three or four dollars sucking as much as the 12 or so dollars I normally would pay. That said, I would gladly have paid more for this one.
The plot is a mixture of ""humans ruined the world"", themes of isolation,amnesia(not of the explosive variety sadly), and crazy monsters. Oh, and a timebomb of sorts. It seems to just keep adding up, with a good pace, a few twists, and pretty good acting. Also, a plus in my book, no child actors. Just people trying to survive through a mazelike race against time and monsters.
The scenes are shot with great angles,the backrounds are beautifully cold and almost colorless. Its dark but not TOO dark. Nothing actually seemed too off the wall or unbelievable, it had a style and everything introduced did not clash with or distract you from it.
One of my favorite things about this, and it is a key factor in making me angry when done incorrectly in many shows and movies as of late, is the whispering. You can hear it. I do not recall a moment where the volume increased or decreased in an annoying manner, and I am extremely grateful. Now to watch the rest of my cheap buys, and see if any will compare to this, and I doubt they will, and it makes me hate that I put this one in first.",1301356800,2,1759,4.238095238095238
3968718,5,B002QW7AJY,"I remember hearing about Pandorum, but I didn't honestly think I would enjoy it *this* much!  It's an awesome style of science fiction and horror combined.

It's about a man who has to escape from a spaceship where evil looking Mortal Kombat-like monsters roam the hallways (like the Sheeva character, specifically) searching for fresh human meat.  Actually those creatures remind me more of something from Quake II, one of my favorite 1st person games ever for the Playstation.

Anyway, the objective here is that the man has to reach the reactor in time, or all hope is completely lost.

Upon the way he meets up with a woman who's obviously mastered the fighting skills required to survive such a dreaded dark place, and another man who assists and jumps in at all the appropriate moments.

The man also frequently communicates with his commander, who has his own side story and personal demons.  Eventually his story becomes the center of attention.  I don't want to spoil anything, but if you've ever played Dino Crisis 2, you may notice a connection here, storyline-wise.

The main part of the storyline is, of course, the man (and his new friends) trying desperately to escape from the clutches of the dangerous monsters.  Now what makes these monsters a little more vicious than most is how *relentless* they are in their pursuit.  Also, the moment you see a blue light at the end of a hallway, that's a sign the monsters are right around the corner.  I LOVE the atmosphere here.  It's awesome.

I really appreciate the writers who worked on this film- they wrote a storyline that's not only understandable, but enjoyable from beginning to end, with lots of suspense and great acting.  I admit though, at first I thought the acting would stink, but it eventually improves just as soon as the action picks up.

Yes, it is definitely a variation on the theme of Sci Fi that has come before - lots of Alien / Aliens and others, but the production design is so good and the mutant creatures suitably scary that it all works. For once we get a particularly upbeat ending too.

The obligatory giant fan scene is the most cliched scene for me but none of the unoriginal aspects detracted from making this great entertainment.

Cast is solid (Cam Gigandet is perhaps the weakest acting but he looks so damn hot who can complain), soundtrack is impressive and blu-ray quality superb.

3968721,5,B002QW7AJY,"I now realize that it would have been a terrible shame if I had not viewed Pandorum because of the poor reviews. It is in fact one of the best SF movies made. It is way superior to most movies in this genre.

First of all, the scenery, and the mutated hunters are extremely well done. It has the feel and atmosphere of a well done SF story. In fact it stands up very well in comparison to the Alien movies although it is difficult to match the creative artistry of Giger -the hunters are extremely well done. They are not only very frightening in appearance but their style of motion is very effective. Most of the characters and dialogue in Aliens is pretty dumb, reflecting the worst average Joe stereotype, which Pandorum, fortunately avoids for the most part.

The lighting and cinematography is superb which goes a long way to give it the right claustrophobic feel of being locked in a crippled spaceship. Great atmosphere.

Second, unlike a lot of Hollywood SF films, the story is not full of contradictions and utter stupidity -although it is by no means ingenious. The ending is a nice surprise.

I enjoyed it very much and found it suitably scary and I recommend it to SF fans. Not surprisingly the average film critic neither understands, nor appreciates more serious SF films, for whom Star Wars is a masterpiece. For true SF fans who read SF books by real SF authors Pandorum, in my opinion, is for adults a far, far better movie.",1296950400,2,1442,4.555984555984556

To me Pandorum really defines Sci-Fi.  It is set in the future, with futuristic weapons and means of travel.  Everything that qualifies for a Sci-Fi flick.  Pandorum contains action and a ever so evolving plot.  When I first saw this movie I was blown away.  At every step there was something to change the plot.  I will be honest and say that I didn't see the end coming, the first time that I watched it.

Pandorum contains a highly evolving plot with a serious life or death hero.  The villain was evil in his own way (it really isn't evident until the end of the movie how the villain played out).  The bad guys are labeled bad from the beginning, and become true bad guys as the movie continues.

I really like the movie and would recommend it to anybody who likes Sci-Fi flicks.  I would also recommend the movie for people who want a nail bitter, action packed, mind blowing movie to watch.",1295913600,2,1150,4.38388625592417
3968723,4,B002QW7AJY,"Originally, right after I saw this movie, I thought it was a solid 3-star film.  After thinking about it some more, I decided it was a solid four-star movie.

Anymore, it's hard to find an SF movie that isn't a reimagining, a sequel, or some derivative of an older property of some kind or another.  Those can be great (witness the reboot of the ""Star Trek"" franchise), but by and large simply reveal the poverty of imagination of Hollywood.  So, leave it to the Germans to come up with something original, different and entertaining.

""Pandorum"" avoided all of the cliches into which I thought it would descend.  I won't list them all, in order to avoid potential spoilers.  That's part of why this movie is so original and why I upped it to four stars.  The movie begins with the mystery of two crewmen who just came out of hypersleep on a long space voyage, who don't remember who they are or what their mission is.  One good thing about ""Pandorum"" is that the mystery is resolved approximately halfway through the film, so that the movie can progress to an actual ending.  The movie provides actual answers to the mysteries it sets up, which is another refreshing change from the ""Lost""-era school of Hollywood entertainment.

The sets are truly amazing - these are large, expansive, actual physical sets.  The credits maintain that the film was shot partly on location in Berlin, and I suspect that creative use was made of old East Berlin buildings and locations.  Regardless, someone really cared a lot about how this movie looked, and about making the Elysium seem like as big a spaceship as it was supposed to be.  ""Pandorum"" isn't one of those cheapjack direct-to-DVD movies that tries to convince you that three hallways and a room are a 50,000 person starship.

On the downside, some of the ""monsters"" are more laughable than scary.  To the extent that anything about ""Pandorum"" is derivative, some elements of it look like the video game ""Dead Space,"" but, so what?

(They were all chosen to colonize a planet - you'd need more cohesion than that - but that is a minor point. I thought there was too much violence/killing and should have been more mystery/strangeness.  Spoiler alert: I think the idea was that the ultra-violence was the way the ""badies"" were being ""pushed"" to evolve - by the real bad guy who had been playing his games for a very long time. Having them all collect and sleep near the warm reactor was too ""Aleins"" for me. The movie does give many nods to many sci fi movies. The lack of explaination for what happened to earth was just unimaginative - and frustrating. Overall - I'd buy a low price discount copy again, but not pay full price again.

Most reviewers have discussed the plot, so I'm not going to recite the storyline. The acting was pretty good. My only complaint about the film was some of the unnecessary hand-to-hand combat sequences and how the characters were not fully developed. Other than that it was definitely worth watching, and it is quite scary. I had that anxious ""someone watching me/looking over my shoulder"" feeling after the film ended, and, for a horror movie lover, it does not happen often.

3968728,4,B002QW7AJY,"""Pandorum"" (2009) is a German/American science fiction horror film directed by Christian Alvart (Curiosity and the Cat, Antibodies). Ben Foster (Corporal Bower), who wakes up from suspended animation finds himself alone and with no memory inside a passenger spaceship called Elysium. He proceeds to wake up Lieutenant Payton (Dennis Quaid) who is also suffering from amnesia. The film starts off very slowly, presenting a dark, claustrophobic world, which seems rather predictable at first, but as the film develops it continues to gather momentum. Light gradually enters the film in the way of flashbacks and with a variety of charismatic and likeable characters. Manh (Cung Le) is a Vietnamese warrior like character, and the beautiful Nadia (Antje Traue) is likewise an able survivalist with great athletic abilities. It becomes apparent as the film develops that a fair amount of money and thought was put into the sets and special effects, and that this isn't going to be a dull, ultra low budget film after all.",1294185600,3,1017,5.2073170731707314
3968729,4,B002QW7AJY,"Have you seen Pandorum? Starring Dennis Quaid (G.I. Joe) and Ben Foster (X-Men 3), this movie is sci-fi entertainment.

Before I get into it, let me caution that this film is gory, violent and jump-out-of-your-seat scary.

Earth is running out of resources and decided to send a massive space ship to an earth-like planet called Tanis.

After taking off, the crew members receive word that earth was destroyed; we're not told how.

Corporal Bower (Foster) awakens from deep hibernation, finds himself in a small room with no exit, then wakes his commanding officer, Payton (Quaid). Together they decide to find answers.

They can't remember much of their past, except what their tasks are on-board the ship.

Bower crawls through some air vents to get further into the ship, Payton directs him from a command chair.

This movie works on one level: you don't know more than the characters. As they learn things, about the ship and their pasts, you learn as well. It keeps you guessing until the end.

As Bower makes his way through the innards of the ship, he comes across other people who have been awake longer but are quite ""wild"". They are being hunted by these demon-looking creatures that carry sticks with glowing blue lights. (So you know when they're coming) And their screaming is ear-piercing. These blue-light bad guys like to eat you.

Where did they come from and how will Bower, Payton and the other humans escape?

The scares are intense but the editing is horrific. To make it ""scarier"" they blast you with loud high pitched noises with quick cut shots of the creatures running and screaming.

And the gory scenes are really over the top.",1294099200,2,1654,4.809187279151944

3968731,5,B002QW7AJY,"Pandorum is a paranoia inducing, terrifyingly dark science fiction film with an important message behind it.
Visually the film is quite stunning, from the claustrophobic crawl spaces to the futuristic looking bridge of the ship. Everything looks as it should be. The plot of the film is easy enough to understand if you were paying attention. I won't give anything away but I will say that I think the overall message of the film is how humans often sabotage themselves.

Don't get be wrong I followed the storyline and plot points pretty well, but some obscure references about Quaids wife and some other points, such as why there was a guy who only spoke Vietnamese on the ship, just kind of passed me by. Being a person who likes Dennis Quaid I was dissappointed that his scenes were a bit few and far between. The nasties were a bit ridiculous and perhaps the storyline with the main characters could have been more solidified and expanded. I also found the film to be weighted more to the horror genre than the science fiction. I would have preferred it the other way round myself. All in all it was a reasonably well shot film with several twists and turns if not a little lacking in storyline.

3968754,4,B002QW7AJY,"It was Sunday, I was bored, PANDORUM was on. I wish I could say that I went into this film thinking it would be entertaining, enjoyable, and that I was thinking positive thoughts as it started, but I can't...and I wasn't. It looked derivative and corny, judging by the trailers I had seen, and the opening minutes did nothing to convince me otherwise.

But, I am surprised to say, that as the movie continued, as the story began to expand and make with the twists and go all out with the hard science fiction, I became very engaged with the mystery of it all. I dare say it's one of the more original sci-fi films to be released of late, but it really does fall into the ""could have been better"" category.

It's hard to say much about the plot without giving things away. Earth is in a state of emergency. With resources running low and tensions high, a ship called the ELYSIUM is launched toward the nearest inhabitable planet: 125 years away. We're then introduced to the protagonist, Bower, as he wakes up from extended hibernation to find most of the ship is on lockdown and losing power fast. It also seems that most of the crew have disappeared, and there's a little problem of monstrous cannibals running amok throughout ELYSIUM. Bower, with the help of his commanding officer, must restore power to the ship and figure out just what the heck happened to their ship, the mission, and the thousands of people who used to occupy it.

Really, the main problem with his movie is the directing. It's not necessarily bad, but it places too much emphasis on action and cheap scares for its own good. It was disappointing to see such a well-conceived screenplay reduced to extended instances of brawling. But, alternatively, the directing also allows the hard sci-fi aspects to come through really well.

To that end, you have is a really good concept buried beneath layers of clichd horror tropes that have been done before, and better. But I emphasize the concept/story because it really is stellar. Combine that with its brevity and you've got a movie that doesn't really overstay its welcome, and rewards you well for sticking with it until its satisfying ending.",1290988800,,2166,4.692105263157894
3968755,5,B002QW7AJY,"This is one of the best Sci-fi horror flicks I'm seen in a long time.  It contains a Refreshingly original story, a creepy as hell atmosphere, and keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.

This movie starts out creepy and bizarre and has a constant satisfying momentum with several twists, plenty of monster fighting gory action, and lots of suspense. This movie transports you into a frightening and bizarre futuristic atmosphere of desolation and desperation. The movie also has you questioning the main characters' sanity and sense of morality, adding a surreal dimension that strokes the darkest parts of the human psyche.

The acting was great, the story was great, and the filming was great.  Love this movie!  The ending has a very unexpected twist and leaves you feeling relieved for the characters who go through hell, Literally HELL....don't miss this one!",1289088000,,882,4.9727891156462585

I don't want to give any spoilers, but I will say the movie is in my oninion very good, I have seen many many other movies that just plainly suck/stink/have fancy cover art to sell, and this one made me nervious at first when I saw the box, ya know, fancy box and cover art, very nice, but I was not disappointed. The two main actors pull off a very good performance, as usual.  A twist ending that is sure to not let you down, I assure you.
Now, my need not to give a spoiler though is overriding what is essential to these reviews on amazon that clear up things others have missed, which is some have noticed that several of our main charactors are doing things that seem superhuman and unbelievable, but I noticed that too and watched the movie a second time.  **DON'T READ THIS IF YOU DON'T WANT A SPOILER**Remember, everyone in cryo sleep was given an ""enzyme"" to jump start evolution on a new planet, to help them adapt to the new environment on a distant planet, well everyone in cryo sleep got that, for a.....no spoiler by me.....amount of time, .. though when you read all through other reviews you get an almost complete picture of the movie.
Oh, and by the way, I was impressed with the sets and humanoid creature effects, very good, I am sure it couldn't have been a rock bottom budget.  Oh, and by the way, that was ""60,000"" colonists sent, not ""16,000"" colonists, to help others out, seems in the movie, several folks said something that sounded like sixteen thousand, but it was actually 60,000 that were originally sleeping.",1289001600,,2030,4.525885558583107
3968757,3,B002QW7AJY,"Pandorum begins with a really intriguing premise. Two astronauts Bower (Ben Foster) and Payton (Dennis Quaid) wake up after long hyper sleep in an apparently deserted spaceship ""Elysium."" Because of the side effect of the hyper-sleep chamber, it takes quite a time to remember who they really are or for what they are on board. While struggling to find the clues to their lost memories, Bower and Payton come to know a shocking fact: they are not alone.

I was instantly drawn to the story - and for modestly budgeted movie the production designs of ""Pandorum"" are impressive. But the promising story slowly turned into something of a disappointment after a series of clichd narrative devices and scares. Without spoiling much, I can tell you that the film is co-produced by Paul W.S. Anderson, director of ""Event Horizon"" and ""Resident Evil."" This is an old ghost ship story with a difference or two. To me the identity of the ""ghost(s)"" is not as interesting as the back story of the spaceship and those who sent it into deep space.

The cinematography by Wedigo von Schultzendorff (""13F"") captures the claustrophobic atmosphere. Director Christian Alvart handles each action scene decently until the overstuffed plot becomes too incredible, barely covering the obvious plot holes (how did they survive in an isolated place such a long, long time?).

""Pandorum"" is a sci-fi action movie with too many subplots going on. If the filmmakers had stuck to the original storyline that deals with the Earth and humankind in the near future, the film could have been much more fascinating.",1288915200,,1583,4.988636363636363

The ship is stocked with thousands of people and every resource needed to found a colony on the new planet they are headed for. The colonist take the century long trip in cryosleep while the ships flight crews take 2 year stints piloting while alternate flight crews are in cryosleep.

This movie starts with one of the flight crew members coming out of cryosleep to find a somewhat empty malfunctioning ship with carnivoristic creatures roaming the dark corridors. From here the main character must find out why the power core is dangerously malfunctioning and what happened to the people of the ship.

I really like this movie. Its a futuristic sci-fi movie that strayed away from the bright CGI that modern sci-fi movies are notorious for.

And having a darker element to the movie without it boiling down to a bug hunt was definitely a plus.

Attempting to reach the ship's reactors, Sgt. Bower [Ben Foster] encounters wicked space hounds, and a band of passengers who have awoken and become vicious scavengers, fighting for survival. It would help a great deal if he could remember his mission, but, like his Lieutenant [Dennis Quaid], the process of hyper-sleep has wiped out much of his memory. Worse, it may have sent him into madness, and all this is a terrible dream. Will his ship end up like the Pandorum, with all hands lost?

Pandorum is a pretty good example of dream horror. It becomes clear fairly early in the film that Bower may be hallucinating, may never have even left hyper-sleep. That would certainly be a better explanation for the horrors around him than the scenario of the ship being overrun by ghost-white hounds from hell and scavengers. But the film does an excellent job of keeping us guessing, as well as portraying the claustrophic quarters and ducts that Bowers must travel through. His plight is well-plotted and well-played, with all of the problems that would arise in such as situation presenting themselves, and no simple answers. Bowers must use his wits to determine what is real, to communicate with the scavengers, who are from all over the world, all speaking different languages, while dealing with crazed humans and even crazier beasts.

This was one of the most scariest, surprising, and unique sci fi films I'd ever seen. The ending shocked the hell out of me and it was confusing at times but I still loved it. It's the kind of film where you will watch it again and again and see little clues as to what happened.

The story begins when you see Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid's characters wake up from their hyper sleep induced for the long space flight and both have acute memory loss when they awake which is a side affect. You don't know what is really happening most of the film but I didn't find it slow because of flashbacks from the survivors. The director did a good job of making sure you were engaged and waiting to see what will happen next. As Foster leaves the perimeter of the ship, he comes across dead bodies and humanoid looking monsters that extremely strong, ugly and are also cannibals. The whole movie is about him figuring out who he is, where he is and what the hell is going on. Did I mention the monsters? Anyway, there are also a few other survivors on board and they journey across the other side of the massive spacecraft to reset the generator that Foster figures out needs to be reset before the ship loses all power and they all die (Foster remembers being a machinist of some sort). As the film progresses, it begins to unfold what their mission was, where the monsters came from and the very end shows what happened to the ship and yes I was shocked when it all unfolded. I've never seen a sci fi story like this one. I'm not sure everyone will even get it until a second viewing. In that respect this is worth buying because you need to watch it more than once.

3968773,4,B002QW7AJY,"Pandorum,released Sept/09,gives us an interesting and different twist in the Sci-Fi genre. The cast is generally confined to a few people at a time on screen and the film manages to capture and maintain an all-pervading atmosphere of oppression and danger,throughout its run.
The story is set in 2247 and the Earth has gone to hell in a hand basket. It has sent a large spaceship full of new colonists(some 16,000 souls)to an Earth-like world some 40 light years away called Tanis,to resettle and populate. However something has gone terribly wrong during the flight. A Corp. Bower awakens from hyper sleep to find that he is seemingly alone on the ship the Elysium,in an ante room cut off from the ships bridge. Just as he regains some of his senses another stasis tube opens and out is ejected one Lieut. Payton. He is as confused as Bower due to their extended hyper sleep and they come to the conclusion that they must regain access to the bridge in order to fully reassess their situation,whatever it is.
Bower elects to crawl through the above duct work in order to hopefully reach the bridge. However his claustrophobic antics in the ducts send him crashing to a grate,through that and then onto the floor;not on the bridge as he'd hoped. As he inspects his surroundings he comes upon a body suspended by a wire in a long hall way. The person is alive but he is no mood to help Bower and in short order Bower discovers there is more life on the ship than this man and the lieutenant;and it is quite malevolent. They hide but Bowers new ""find"" is dragged away to his death by the creatures;humanoid beings that run and crawl with amazing speed and wear an exoskeleton of bones.
The farther Bower explores the ship the more creatures he encounters. In fact he manages to hook up with two other crew members along the way,a man(who speaks no English)and a woman;both are just as bewildered and terrified of their surroundings as Bower. Pieces of this mysterious puzzle slowly start to come together as the film progresses and we learn that these wild creatures roaming the ship were once humans like themselves. It seems that some genetic enhancement in their cryo-tube feeder lines which was supposed to help kick start life on the new planet has somehow mutated many of the colonist. Bower's memory also slowly returns to him bit by bit and he realizes that the reactor must be restarted in order to gain control of the ship properly. With this in mind he heads down to the lowest and most dangerous levels of the ship to reach it with his companions.
Lieut. Payton meanwhile has had his hands full. A young corporal has come out of a cryo pod in Bowers absence and the corporal has all the signs of pandorum;a slow build up of extreme paranoia which can lead to severe harm to those around. As he deals with the corporal he tries to guide Bower and company to the reactor. Things however deteriorate to such an extent he is over powered and forced by the corporal to eject him off the ship in a life pod. But it is only a simulation run by the lieutenant and in there the corporal stays temporarily. Back at the reactor things are touch and go. The resting area for the blood thirsty creatures is at the base of the reactor. The walkway above which leads to the reactor controls gives way under Bowers feet and he falls to another extending section of the reactor. However he must go down and walk through the creatures while they rest/sleep and climb the ladder back up to the controls. Just as he reaches the ladder the creatures wake up and pursue Bower and company. Bower manages to finally get the reactor online which disintegrates many of the creatures at its base. However it is still a mad dash back to the bridge and ""safety"" from those creatures still alive,and there are plenty.
The corporal that Lieut. Payton held in the pod is now out again and they are in a hand to hand struggle. Payton manages to subdue him with a tranquilizer gun,but wait. The corporal IS the lieutenant! He,suffering from pandorum himself,was responsible for ejecting around 1600 passengers early on in the flight. He re-entered a cryo sleep until awakened later to meet an unsuspecting Bower. Now Bower and the only one of two of his companions left,confront Payton. Payton opens the shield doors from the observation windows above to reveal an inky blackness with no stars. When an alien life form swims by the windows illuminating some of the surroundings,it is then they realize they are under water. The Elysium had crash landed underwater 923 years before. When a crack in the window forms during their struggle with Payton and water starts to enter,Bower and his companion enter a cryo tube and eject themselves. In short order what colonists that are left on board are also being ejected because of the hull breach. They all end up on the water surface looking across at a beautiful island with a waterfall;just waiting for them to finally begin their colonization of Tanis.
The film moves back and forth between Payton and Bowers at just the right moments. Besides the creatures,there are rarely any more than three people on the screen at one time. The claustrophobia is maintained beautifully throughout and is heightened considerably in such areas as the duct work,full of round tubing that is unforgiving and almost seems alive. The big picture as to exactly what is going on is also kept to a minimum throughout. The characters and we the viewers are kept in the dark and only given enough snippets to pique our interest just to keep things moving at the pace the director wants. So when we finally realize that the corporal and the lieutenant are one and the same and the ship is actually under water and not lost in space,the punch is considerable. Well crafted to be sure and it is what makes Pandorum the good movie it is.
Technically the film is in its' widescreen glory in its 2:35:1 a/r. The transfer is clear and crisp. Special features include three featurettes,one a behind-the-scenes,a mock flight team video for the Elysium and a Blair Witch-like video of what happened to Nadia's team. There is also the trailer,commentary and some deleted and alternate scenes. The DVD I have comes with a holographic like cover over the usual snap case. Nice.
All in all a different,likable and smart twist in the Sci Fi genre. The oppressive atmosphere the makers maintain throughout the film is wonderfully done and they leave you guessing right down to the final moments. I recommend it.",1282953600,2,6497,4.690017513134851
3968774,3,B002QW7AJY,"Saw Pandorum, on Encore last night--which was trashed by most critics.  Not sure if I'd recommend this very spooky; atmospheric sci-fi offering--but the movie has stuck with me...and I'm recording it in about an hour.

Synopsis...sorta:  A couple of astronauts awake from hypersleep, unsure what they're doing onboard a huge malfunctioning spaceship, named the Elysium (Heaven?).  They soon discover that the ship is full of blood-thirsty mutants and a few other frightened human astronauts running for their lives through the bowels of this Geiger-ish (the movie, Alien) spacecraft.  The Corporal falls through maintenance shafts, gets kicked-around, stabbed; etc, so much onboard the mystery ship that an ordinary human would have been incapacitated for life--ten times over (but we do live in the era of improbable action video games).  Through it all the Lieutenant sits in the Captain's Chair, inside Elysian's comfortable bridge, pressing buttons and yelling, ""Where are you?"" over the intercom.  As I quickly learned in the 20th Century Air Force:  Rank has its privileges.

I suppose what I really like about the screenplay is that that in their journey to reboot the nuclear reactor, the back-story is slowly revealed.  I also liked the tough/sexy German actress (Antje Traue)--wearing a 22nd Century push-up bra--who could fight like a man.  (""Pow-Pow"": ten points!)  Oh, the imaginary word: pandorum is a psychological condition brought on by extended periods of deep-space travel and suspended animation--where its victim eventually becomes psychotic.  Whether this futuristic physiological condition alludes to the 3,000-year-old Greek legend of Pandora's Box, or not--I don't know.

Now, if David Lynch would have directed this opus, after reworking the screenplay--imagine what a materpiece this would be.  BOB as the Psychopathic Lieutenant!  Strobe lights flashing.  Red curtains rustling...",1282780800,,1908,5.615384615384615

Unfairly dismissed as another Alien wannabe by some critics and bombed at the box-office, i thought this was a terrific and scary Sci-fi horror shocker. It does give off a bit of Alien with more being like Event Horizon and The Thing with The Black Hole thrown into it, the film is well acted and shot. The film is relentlessly gory such as head explosions to cannibalism from the aliens, it is a claustrophobic and atmospheric feature that excites and gives some quality fresh ideas.

3968776,4,B002QW7AJY,"What a remarkable surprise of a film this is. I think Pandorum suffered from its promotion as a horror film -- simply because, while it does contain a horror ement, I would classify it more as a science-fiction thriller than a horror picture. The movie's promotion -- what there was of it -- was inscrutable. When I watched the film, I thought I would be mildly entertained by a monster-of-the-week-trapped-in-a-shuttle sort of cast-elimination movie.

What Pandorum is, instead, is an intriguing survival-horror drama set in a post-fall techological environment. Characters must cope with a world that has collapsed, in this case the interior of a very large ship bearing all that is left of humanity. The ship is also populated by mutated creatures who are the result of the passage of time applied to generations of passengers bearing an enzyme in their blood (intended to ""jump start evolution"" when they reach their destination).

In the decay around the characters, we see the shadow of the world they've left behind. This helps increase the sense of hopelessness these characters must fight, and encourages us to root for them -- even as we understand how high are the stakes for which they play.

Fine perfomances are turned in all around, although I found Dennis Quaid less than compelling.  (He's been ""phoning it in"" for a few years now as his career winds down.)  The star of this picture is, without doubt, the superb Ben Foster, who is excellent in every role he plays.  He has a depth of emotion to him that is at once resilient and vulnerable; these are the perfect notes for the protagonist of a survival-horror film.

German-born Antje Traue is exotic and captivating despite the layers of grime under which she must perform.  Cung Le is convincing and heroic in a role that is really a glorified stunt man's part, but then, Cung Le is a competitive mixed martial artist and kickboxer, not really an actor.  (The script, wisely, grants him no English lines.)  Eddie Rouse (who played a thug in Pineapple Express) is creepy, while Cam Gigandet and misplaced Boondock Saint Norman Reedus are barely present (and not missed when absent).

The movie is visually striking and, I have to admit, has an ending that took me by surprise.  The ""is it real or is it a mental delusion"" angle is there but not overused (always a danger with material of this type; if it gets too confusing the audience stops caring if the movie's events are an illusion).  It's also reasonably well paced, and the film's creature-villains are real enough to be truly scary.

If I have any quibbles it is that there is no explanation given for why Cung Le and Antje Traue are such accomplished fighters.  Yes, they have awakened in a world that requires them to fight for survival... but are kung fu skills spontaneously visited on you under this kind of stress? There would seem to be plenty of training opportunities... but no margin for error when to lose means to be killed and eaten, not necessarily in that order.

3968778,3,B002QW7AJY,"There's nothing terribly new in PANDORUM.  It's 150 years in the future, and the earth is dangerously overpopulated, and have sent a gigantic spacecraft into space with 16,000 people in suspended animation, with the idea of reaching a new planet that looks suitable for human life and saving the human race.  But things haven't gone exactly right...a disease that causes madness (the titular Pandorum) has ravaged much of the crew and many of the people on the ship have evolved into super-tough but super-ugly mutants (they reminded me of the cavedwellers in THE DESCENT).

So a small (very small) rag-tag group tries to start the power back up on their ship while surviving the creatures, pandorum and each other.  Squishy mayhem ensues.

A few things distinguish PANDORUM.  The art direction is impeccable.  The spacecraft is a fully realized maze of cabling, containers, steel and mucky liquid.  With outstanding lighting design, we are often only able to see tiny bits of the ship at a time, forcing us to experience the dim hallways and gangways just as the frightened survivors do.  Again, the idea of a dark, cavernous ship can be traced directly back to ALIEN (and probably back from there)...but this setting still can create an excellent sense of claustrophobia.  And you never know where or when something will leap.

I also enjoyed the performance from Ben Foster as Corporal Bower.  Foster is an interesting actor, always adding a twist of craziness to his performances, from SIX FEET UNDER to 40 DAYS OF NIGHT to 3:10 Tor O YUMA.  Here he doesn't so much play crazy as frantic and scared.  But he brings more to his underwritten and uninspired role that most actors would manage.  He's just more fun to watch than most actors would be in this part.  I also liked Antje Traue in the even more underwritten role of ""the tough fighting girl who works alongside our hero.""  She looks physically convincing enough, like a German Rhona Mitra.  Dennis Quaid is given top billing, but really has little to do for most of the film.  He's mostly collecting a paycheck here...not his fault though.  The script by Travis Milloy is strictly by the books.

The film holds a couple of modest surprises as it reaches its climax.  But they hardly turn the genre on its head either.  This is a film that looks good...but mostly that's it.  The fight scenes are appropriately bloody and noisy...but we've seen it all before.  The special effects are quite competent, but are hardly boundary stretching.  In the end, I'd say this is a film for fairly hard-core sci-fi action fans who don't mind an unoriginal story.  Or members of the Ben Foster fan club, if there is such a thing.",1281139200,2,2676,4.786026200873362

I was pleasantly surprised by the ending which was very clever and came away thinking, with some of the Hollywood sensationalism removed, it could have made a pretty good sci-fi short story.

If you're a horror fan, then this movie may please you. I had some problems understanding all of the dialog as the recording level of the voices varied a great deal. The bulk of the movie is in darkened locations that could have been anywhere which is always best for horror it seems.

I gave it three stars as it did generate enough interest on my part to wonder where it was going and how things would turn out.

3968781,5,B002QW7AJY,"I'm not going to write a big long review explaining every scene in the movie because it would be full of spoilers and I just don't want to take the time to do it. BUT, I have to say this movie is awesome! I'm a pretty big sci-fi fan and a pretty big horror fan and this movie is both. I personally didn't like Event Horizon, however that's about the only other movie I have seen in this genre. Aliens too I guess, but aliens was more a sci-fi thriller in my opinion and not really a horror movie per say, but I guess that's a matter of opinion.

Anyway, Pandorum is epic. I saw the preview and thought it looked good especially since it was rated R, which I usually take as a good thing with horror movies because it leads me to believe they weren't watered down. This movie was definitely NOT watered down at all. Sadly I missed it while it was in theatres which is usually the case for me because I don't go to the movies much. The only real turn off I had going in was Dennis Quad. I'm not saying he's a bad actor but sometimes he just doesn't do it for me. Man was I eating my opinion of him with this movie. He was great, hands down the best performance I have ever seen him give. He's usually too dry and boring for my taste even in The Day After Tomarrow he just wasn't that great, though not unbearable. But man he gave Pandorum everything he had apparently. So hats off to Dennis for not only giving me a huge reason to like him now but for also not making Pandorum suck (I really mean that in a good way). All the other actors were terrific too, no poor performances in this film, everyone did a good job and played their roles very believably.

Now for the story all I want to say is if you are the type likes twists and psychological thrillers you will love Pandorum. I really don't want to give anything away or over hype anything but its got some real surprises you won't see coming. Horror fans will also love this movie because its creepy as hell, but real creepy not some stupid load noise to make you jump I mean full on claustrophobic feeling, scary ass tension that will make you start preying for the characters because you don't want them to get killed. Luckily this is a movie that makes you care about the lead characters. There's no one in the movie you're gunna be hoping gets his or her head ripped off, and thats what makes it great. You feel for the chars and really want them all to survive.

In the end Pandorum has become one of my all time favorite movies and definitely one of my top 10 sci-fi movies. I would rate it number 1 but I can't give that slot to any movie so all my favs jus go in my top 10 list, I think there's about 30 of em now :P

I can't recommend this one enough if there's any part of you that wants to see it jus buy it, at $11.99 for the blu-ray you won't regret it at all.",1279411200,,2828,4.09009009009009
3968782,4,B002QW7AJY,"Hyper-sleep, a stasis for humans traveling in space for years, is a relatively sacrosanct concept in sci-fi.  It's a life preserving process shown in everything from Planet of the Apes to Alien.  From Star Trek and Stargate to Avatar.  But what happens when the chambers, and the mechanisms for keeping humans not only alive but functional upon awakening, malfunction on the immobile bodies?

The malfunction of stasis is the basis for Pandorum, both the movie and the resulting condition.

Bower (Ben Foster) awakens from his hyperbunk.  Searing pain, confusion.  When this space vessel left Earth in year 2174, the population had skyrocketed to unmaintainable levels and the ship's mission was to follow a probe that found possible salvation for Earth's remaining, starving population.  Only Bower doesn't know how long he's been asleep, it's pitch black, and he hears strange noises.  When Lieutentant Payton (Dennis Quaid) wakes up at least there's two of them.  Right?

Initially just about everyone thought this was going to be Event Horizon's sequel.  In some ways that is true.  The difference, however, is that this adds another plot-dimension instead of an alternate dimension.  Think of the visionless claustrophobia of Descent, where every pin drop is an atom bomb, every faint screech is the unknown danger lurking around the corner, waiting to kill, to torture, to feed.  When Bower and Payton slowly uncover the ship's terrifying secrets - powered by a futuristic set and production that looks imminently dangerous - the film becomes perpetually tense and creepy.

Pandorum has not received widespread recognition, making it criminally unknown because of woeful promotion.  A solid sci-fi, thriller the combination of action, horror, and sci-fi is captivating from beginning to end.  Sure, it's derivative, and a few scenes could probably have been edited out, but the overall product is an exploration of tried and tested sci-fi practices.  Highly recommended for sci-fi fans, the multiple twist endings should also draw in other cinema fans.

3968783,3,B002QW7AJY,"Pandorum / B002QW7ALM

As a horror movie, I would give ""Pandorum"" 4 stars, but as a science fiction movie, I feel that 3 stars would be generous. When Ben Foster wakes from cryogenic sleep for what should be a routine flight shift on a space-faring colony ship, he is surprised to find that very little seems to be functioning on the ship, and utterly horrified as he comes to realize that the colony ship is infested with what can only be described as ""space orcs"" (a la ""Lord of the Rings""), who mercilessly hunt humans through the darkened corridors of the ship and whose main feeding grounds are the cryopod chambers, where they wait for poor, doomed souls to randomly pop out of cryosleep (due to general ship malfunctions) for them to feast upon.

The horror aspect of this movie is relatively well done. The scariest parts, to me, were prior to the discovery of the space-orcs - with Foster floudering around dealing with the demons of isolation and claustrophobia, not to mention the horror of finding dead bodies down jeffries tubes and hanging in the dark corridors - that's enough to scare anyone silly. Once the space-orcs show up, the horror dials down a bit - the monsters lack the nightmare fuel potential of, say, the aliens from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>, and orcs can never truly be scary after ""Lord of the Rings"" - you can't help but feel that Gandalf will show up any minute to shoo them off the ship. Still, the ""trapped on a ship with homicidal maniacs"" plotline will get you pretty far, and ""Pandorum"" does a very solid job with what it has to work with.

Plot-wise, however, is where it all falls down. There's very little criticism I can level at the movie without causing massive spoilers, except to say that the plot has more holes than a sieve and (to paraphrase Yahtzee) contains science so soft you could spread it on a dinner roll. Not that soft science in movies isn't a legitimately proud tradition, but there's a difference between ""technobabble"" and ""just making stuff up"" - and the final plot resolution shouldn't contain so many dangling threads that there's no way anything you just saw could logically have happened, given basic human nature, laws of physics, and common sense. As usual, all this warping of reality is done to service a couple of major plot twists - and, as usual, the twists are quite good except for the fact that they're logically impossible. But - again - I don't want to spoil, so I'll just say that if you come to ""Pandorum"" for the horror, you'll probably be satisfied as long as you're careful to not think too hard (or, really, at *all*) about the plot.

3968784,3,B002QW7AJY,"I would give this well made sci-fi film 4 stars for its special effects but only 3 for its plot.  Although the makers wanted to create an original sci-fi film (which they did visually), this film just did not rate five stars as far as I was concerned.  It had great art work, very good make up, beautiful sets, and fantastic creature effects, but was just too gory and violent.

This was an original film about a slow traveling generational star ship (i.e., travel times of hundreds of years) and an end of the world effort to settle on a new planet found to orbit a star 40 light years away from earth.  Great and an original idea for sci-fi film, but the plot was not much to speak of.  Although it was a new setting for sc-fi and employed amazing creature effects, the plot was sorely lacking.

Visually it was as stunning as Alien, with sets almost as organic as Giger's work. In the end it turned into a very well made slasher movie similar to EVENT HORIZON. EVENT HORIZON, starring Sam Neil, was another sc-fi film which was really well done and incorporated many original ideas and great effects but needed someone to help out with a good plot besides violence and gore.",1278633600,,1177,4.4511627906976745
3968785,4,B002QW7AJY,"A mid-budget film ($40 Mil) that doesn't look it.  Wow. Despite the money spent on special effects and the elaborate set pieces, this could easily have been a 2-star movie, or worse, if not for the writing, directing, and acting.  Don't know what I mean, watch the short video included on the disk titled ""What Happened To Nadia's Team."" The short is about 5 min long, with 3 actors, and uses some of the actual set. But it shows how bad this could hv been if Jason Groff had directed it, Jeff Dixon had written it, and these 3 actors had acted it. But Pandorum the movie was surprisingly good. I appreciated that the credits weren't shown until the end; for me, beginning credits always ruin the set up and atmosphere.  The music and sounds are great, work well without being distractacting. I don't know how fast the Elysium was traveling to have reached Tanis when it did, but Tanis is over 40 light years from Earth, which means the footage filmed from the probe COULD NOT have been shown ""live"" on television as depicted in the movie, it would have taken 40 years for the probe's broadcast to reach Earth. That's really the only glaring technical quibble without my ruining some of the ending for you, so I won't mention any other. I've never really gotten into 'Mad Max' type baddies but I suppose this is what makes sense given the time and place of the story, so I guess they did the best possible given everything. Even so, the movie still makes me want to break out DEAD SPACE on my PS3 and start playing.  Folks, it only brought in $10.3 Mil at the box office, so we need to support dirctors and producers like this. Now that it's on video, RENT IT.

3968788,4,B002QW7AJY,"There's a lot going on in this little gem of a sci-fi horror flick.  While I won't say it's original, I won't say it isn't either. What it most certainly is, however, is entertaining and inventive.

The movie starts about 200 years from now with the launch of a ship named ""Elysium"" which, at the beginning of the film, has a mission that is not clearly revealed to the viewer and can only be guessed at.  (The mission will be discovered by the two flight-crew members [Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid] who awake from hypersleep to find a ship with many things amiss.)  Key to the story is the fact that hypersleep causes extreme forgetfulness and is achieved by pumping chemicals through a person's body.  That's all I'll say lest I head deep into the heart of Spoilerville.

There's a lot going on in ""Pandorum"" and, for the most part, the screenwriting, direction and acting get high marks.  One character encountered mid-way through the movie seems to know quite a bit more than he realistically should and seems like an expositional plant placed in the story to explain certain aspects of the film's mystery.  Production values are very good.

Of course, there's the suspension of disbelief I had to make with regard to many characters on the ship.  Specifically, I think most people would act more like Bill Paxton's character from ""Alien.""  They would wail, cower in fear, wet their pants, find a hiding spot and stay there (starving to death rather than suffering the alternative), and possibly commit suicide (not that Paxton's character does all those things, mind you).

Highly recommended.",1276646400,,1597,4.830882352941177
3968789,5,B002QW7AJY,"This movie deserves every bit of five stars, because for the most part it throws most of the conventional Hollywood playbook out the door but doesn't fall into the trap that so many of the anti-Hollywood type movies do (especially in the scfi genre).  First to compare this to Alien/Aliens is not very honest.  While there is a small similarity it ends there.  If you really think it copied Alien/Aliens then you either a) didn't watch the whole movie or b) just missed it completely in the end.  The movie is about mankind in a very personal and intimate way that most scifi movies miss completely.  The characters worked well and were very believable from a movie stand point.  The plot builds, molds, and develops well all the while twisting itself just when you think you have a good idea of what it's all about.  In fact I sit thinking and looking back on it to find more things I did not pick up on and really will have to watch it several more times to recheck my thoughts and theories.  If you are looking for an intelligent movie that will surprise you but not come across as someone trying to impress themselves with their ideas and writing, this is it.  If you want a movie to get you out of the processed Hollywood hum drum then this is it.  If you want the same old processed Hollywood garbage and like simple movies that are easy to understand, go elsewhere.

I'd never heard of this movie, and having grown tired of cheesy science fiction wanna be films that are mostly rip offs that fall short of being entertaining, was expecting this movie to be more of same.  it wasn't.

This film straddled a couple of film genres quite well, bringing something new to the table and had enough twists in the plot to keep the viewer guessing, and it even fooled me in the end.  The story holds up well, and isn't filled with holes like so much of what you see today.

3968791,5,B002QW7AJY,"It was ironic that I had a conversation with my father about the abysmal state the movie industry is in right now (very few original and fresh ideas) right before I saw this movie.  Almost every big-budget blockbuster has highly predictable plots and requires that the intelligent viewer ignore that inner-critic and go with the emotional ride.  That is NOT the case with Pandorum.

The movie starts off with some exposition, but ultimately presents the viewers with just a 'situation'.  Two men wake up from hyper-sleep in a future ship designed to save the human race by colonizing a new planet.  That's it. The beauty of this plot is that the real horror of the situation comes from its unknown elements.  Right from the beginning the emotional connection is made with the main, Bower, as he tries to do the impossible and salvage the situation with little to no information.  Pieces of the puzzle do slowly come, but not before the audience has been completely immersed in the emotional horror that the two men face.

From this epic beginning the scenery gets more complex with sci-fi environments that speak of true creativity (more personal favorite being the auxiliary power devices).  The entire ship feels like another world as we see its inhabitants move around like they are on land.  Everything, from the lack of lighting to the color contrasts, adds to the sense of insanity that the characters must face.

One element in particular I liked was the sense of realism that the characters portrayed.  The special effects were there obviously, but didn't actually effect the human characters, in that they didn't have super-human speed or lightening quick reflexes.  In fact when they fell down they actually staggered in getting back up (although some of their collisions with the machinery should have killed them, but that's par for the course with any movie).  In fact there's a great scene where our main, Bower, suffers a bought of claustrophobia, showing a common human weakness.

Overall I really like the movie.  It had me guessing til the very end with an ending that didn't feel contrived or forced.  I do warn there are some squeal moments of gore, but they aren't there for gore's sake (not like Hostel or Saw).  This movie's different, it doesn't present everything in the beginning and it doesn't treat the audience like they're stupid (the explains come fast and are not mulled over).

Alien' is basically a remake of 'It The Terror From Beyond Space' from the 50's, so if we want to beat down a film for not being original, then lets stop right there.

'Pandorum' is a pretty good sci -fi thriller with its share of good scares and atmosphere. It also has two fine actors(Quaid and Foster)on screen for most of it's hour and forty minute running time. Once the film gets going the Alien comparison will lessen as this film turns into a little more than monster of the loose fare.

The biggest flaw for me with this film is that I found parts of it confusing towards the end and I wasn't quite sure what was really happening and what was happening in the minds of these space travelers. The film is well paced and even though the aliens are strange looking, they work for the most part.

Granted, it would have made a great 3-or-4-part sitcom, but not a full-length film.  The film was very dark...couldn't even see half of what was going on...and when the lighting was turned up, I wasn't sure if it was something I wanted to see anyway!  LOL!  Maybe I've seen way too many Sci-Fi flicks, but there were better films (directing, script and acting) in the 50's and 60's.  If you're starved for a sci-fi (high budget) film, then watch this.  If you want quality, go back and re-watch ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"", ""Alien"", or ""The Blob"".  What a waste of time this was.",1270944000,6,749,4.448529411764706

One astronaunt wakes up and has lost of memory and is disoriented after coming to on board the space craft. Soon another person awakes and they try and figure out whats going on and what has happened to all the crew and people aboard the craft. When they finally realize whats happening on board the craft and whats on board with them the movie starts to get really creepy.

3968828,3,B002QW7AJY,"Well cast and believably brought to the screen,  this movie suffers from straddling genre types somewhat, but the overall story arc is ultimately satisfying and the acting passes muster... even if some of the elements some overly reworked from other genre outings.
We open in a tense claustrophobic setting when Ben Foster awakes from a long cryogenic sleep, on board a spacecraft... he can't remember why he is there.  He manages to wake up another crewmember, (Dennis Quaid) and together they try and find out just exactly what is going on.  And something very, very odd and disturbing is clearly going on.  Things are not working right, and there are noises and faint screaming sounds coming from the ship.  The situation escalates from one of tense claustrophobia and unanswered questions, to some more routine genre elements of monsters (think The Rievers, from Serenity), chases and a race against time.  There are certainly some tense moments, and perhaps a few mild scares, but this is not an out and out horror movie, despite the `Resident Evil' connection proudly displayed on the cover.  It has some of the early creepiness of Event Horizon, but is not as disturbing.  Neither does this feel like an effects driven sci-fi - it has a more characters-in-peril feel, in an old fashioned way.  The ending is a satisfying resolution, but the movies undoing is the way the tone jerks uneasily from one style to the next along the way.  From claustrophobic tension to running along corridors, a soupcon of resident evil style fighting `bad guys', token woman to grace the cover and a just a taste of something new to give it some credibility.. it's as if there were several different directions they could have taken it, and they tried to squeeze most of them in to draw in the widest audience.  I liked it, but those expecting a movie conforming to any prior expectations based on tag-lines or producer connections, might well be disappointed.
Flawed then, but an interesting enough addition to the sci-fi catalogue.",1269043200,2,2021,4.9147058823529415

After finishing the movie I regretted it-only because I will now be gladly paying full price for it.  I should have gone with my gut feeling and just bought it for the full 20 bucks.

You are either a fan of this genre or you or not.  If you are then this is a must own.  If you are not then it is still a quality rental.  It was MUCH better than I expected.",1268784000,15,578,3.9224137931034484

3968832,3,B002QW7AJY,"Pandorum thematically looks a lot like Alien:  Normal working schlubs are mysteriously awoken from hypersleep to deal with an alien anomaly.  Unfortunately eclipsed by the more muscular Aliens, Alien combined working class vs. middle class tension with claustrophobia.  After all, Ripley was just another hack doing her job and trying to get through the day - the fact that hypersleep put her at the mercy of corporate overseers isn't much different than the at-will employment contracts that everyone signs these days.

Pandorum takes this idea one step further.  Our two protagonists, Bower (Ben Foster) and Payton (Dennis Quaid), awaken with no memory of who they are.  They can't remember why they're on the ship, who reports to whom, or much else about the present.  The one thing they do remember is their mission to colonize an Earth-like planet known as Tanis.

The cavernous ship, Elysium, serves as a series of set pieces for confrontations between the cannibals roaming the ship and human survivors. These survivors have been scrabbling so long that they no longer have a moral compass. In that regard Pandorum borrows elements established in Night of the Living Dead - the people you have to worry about aren't the zombies you can see but the allies you're locked in with.

The story unspools through Bower and Payton's flashbacks as they slowly regain their memories. The motivations that propel them at first are slowly stripped away, one by one, until they are left with nothing but their core values.  The ending lays each character's true nature bare. In that regard Pandorum is refreshingly contained.  It has an explanation for everything, if you listen closely enough.

Unfortunately Pandorum doesn't quite pull off all these elements successfully.  The cannibals look a combination of pale ghouls mixed with punk-style outfits. Director Christian Alvart tries hard to make them move oddly by speeding up the film, which becomes obvious when human actors are also in the frame.  Still, these ghouls aren't zombies at all - they breed, and it's that simple fact that makes them so unsettling.

The other survivors don't have much more personality: the tough chick Nadia (played by the nearly incomprehensible Antje Traue who has a thick accent), the mute but loyal warrior Manh (Cung Le, mute but loyal), and the crazy old guy Leland (Eddie Rouse injecting much-needed humor a little too late). Fortunately, Quaid and Foster do the heavy lifting. There's a lot of important exposition in Pandorum but it's unfortunately lost in the soundtrack and all the screeching.

The biggest challenge for Pandorum is to convince the audience that the protagonists are sane in an unfamiliar world.  Because we don't know much about the universe, we don't really have a standard of sanity to judge them by.  When certain Terrible Revelations (tm) are revealed it's not clear that this knowledge would drive someone insane.

The race to restart the Elysium's reactor before the entire ship dies shifts gears quickly to a series of staccato revelations. Your familiarity with sci-fi tropes will determine how surprising these revelations are. I guessed all of them, but then I watch a lot of sci-fi. Mixing zombie and science fiction tropes, Pandorum is a surprisingly intelligent film.  Some choppy editing unfortunately prevents it from reaching its full potential.",1268352000,4,3371,5.13919413919414

And thats just the first half of the movie.  Now add in the possibility that you and another survivor could be going through the beginning stages of a mental disorder (the films title) that may cause you to become paranoid and dangerous.  With no where to run and the ship's core about to shut down for good its up to Bower (Ben Foster) to try and remember what has happened and how to fix the reactor.  The movie had some cheap thrills but the mae-up and sets were outstanding and Ben Foster has never disappointed me with a performance and his record remains flawless.

The story: a guy wakes up on a deep space ship heading to colonize an alien world. He finds out that the ship is in trouble: it is off course and there are alien monsters running around snacking on the crew and passengers (oh dear!!). What to do..Waht to do..What..to..do..

If you don't figure out the entire movie 30 minutes into Pandorum, then you weren't paying attention. That's the problem, no real surprises. Plus the whole ""why don't they call back home"" idea is handled by destroying the Earth. How? That was never really explained (BOOM - it blew up, move on..)

You had the hard part of this project done - a script that works - and actors who can do some acting - couldn't you guys just try a tiny weeny bit more and not rush the third act so fast you killed all story lines and subplots (likely in a single evening) ?

3968847,1,B002QW7AJY,"- The first 15 minutes look promising. After that things go bad very quickly.

- The special effects look primitive.

- Suspense exists only in the first 15 minutes. The rest of the movie is boring.

- The acting is not engaging.

- The fighting scenes are hilarious. They're short and hard to see. Cung Le's talent was completely wasted by the director. It clearly shows that he does not know how to stage fighting scenes.

Le is a famous fighter of mixed martial art. In 2008, he broke the right arm of veteran fighter Frank Shamrock with his killer kicks. He became Strikeforce Middleweight Champion that night in San Jose. On YouTube, you can watch some exciting and gripping clips of his fights. They include Cung Le versus Frank Shamrock, versus Warren Strike, versus Nashun.

It's amazing and spectacular to see him floored opponents who were much taller and heavier than he is. His signature ""scissor"" kicks are one of his techniques to take down his opponents. The YouTube clips are free and yet they're much more interesting than this movie.

**** Warning. SPOILERSs ahead. DO NOT READ FURTHER if you have not watched it.

- The worst thing is the ending. It turns out that everything came from the illusion in the head of the main character! Yeah! This plot has been recycled hundreds of times before.

- RottenTomatoes dot com shows this movie made $10,261,085 at the box office. This amount accurately reflects how bad it is. In short, there is nothing worth watching here. I regret spending money to watch it in the theatre.",1267660800,9,1538,4.708955223880597

3968849,2,B002QW7AJY,"This is one of those movies that instead of just showing you a scene they mess with the frame, do shotty takes and use unnecessary loud noise...in and attempt...to either scare you, makes something interesting...that allot of times isn't, be clever or just flat out try to be a trendy film maker.  Ever see ""Choke"", same thing....or ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", same film style...a sad hack job labeled as ""artistic"" but really just lame.  It comes off moreless annoying, this entire movie I kept wishing the camera would back up, focus, or stop shaking all the time enough to just let me see something as simple as two people talking.  Its ridiculous.  The best way I can describe this movie is hearing a baby cry for an hour and a half right in your ear, have a strobe light flashing in your face and someone asking you the same question over and over again.

The sad thing is, the story as far as science fiction is concerned really isn't that bad.  But you have to really have patience to see past all that's wrong with this movie.  Another film maker could have used this story to make a better movie.  This film kind of treads on the whole ""Event Horizon"" type thing, but that movie which wasn't all that great either was way better than this.  Same theme where everyone is confused all the time and asking the same question over and over and over again, communicating in such a broken sense that its a wonder how they even fuction in normal life.  They seem to know absolutely nothing, or have any ability to ask a basic question or give a basic answer without some cryptic ramble...showcased in a elder's relevation tale of the ships purpose.  This movie at least has a hot chick, whom of course has a massive boob job with mad cleavage popping out.  As much as this made it better for me because I am a dude, it was pointless for the movie.  Speaking of point...the movie in a whole can be summed up in four sentences.  People wake up, ship is infested with morphing breeding orgy creatures that eat people.  Ship captain is insane, keeps people there to feed rangouls to play god in sense, talks to himself constantly.  Ship was sent to earth like planet to inhabit the future of humanity, but is currently underwater.  Boy and boob girl escape and float to surface, cleavage still intact.

I can't say pass on this, just don't throw money away by buying it.  Rent it first or buy from a discounted seller.

***On thing I never understood about movies taking place hundreds of years form now***

Do we talk like old englishman?  Or even like Pilgrams?  Or even like people did back in the 30's?  Why in these movies do people use modern day language or culture ladid profanity.  Even though the ""F"" bomb may be popular and used these days, I doubt it will be still as frequently used 400 year from now.  Doesn't make sense",1267660800,4,2837,4.481481481481482
3968850,4,B002QW7AJY,"**Spoiler alert** I watched this movie 3 times in one day. Not because I liked it so much but because I kept missing things.

The first time that I watched it I was reading a book and I looked up and there was a deformed space-alien-type creature on the screen attacking the protagonist (Ben Foster). I thought, hey, I didn't know there were aliens in this. Cool.

So after it ended I watched it again and fell asleep but not before I learned that what I thought were aliens weren't really aliens. I didn't fall alseep because it was boring but because I was tired, that time I woke up in time to catch the ending and the protagonist on the ships bridge opened the hull covering the windows and realized there were no stars.

So, the third and final time that I watched the movie I paid attention to it all the way through and found it to be quite an enjoyable, genuinely creepy horror/hard SF. OK, I'm stretching the HARD SF part. It's not written by Arthur C. Clarke or anything but the scientific set pieces are really clever and the design is cool.

Dennis Quaid is effective however the young version of him is a ""turrible"" actor. Just really pleasant to look at and has nice muscles and a lovely face but the boy cannot act his way out of a paper sack. That being said, I think that Dennis Quaid is admirable for not rolling his eyes every time the young scamp delivered a line with a greasy ham fist. Ham fisted line delivery is not my cup of tea unless it's a satire and it wasn't. I just wanted to say ham fist again.

Ben Foster, from the intense and tiny man school of acting, the one that Willem Dafoe and Paul Giammatti graduated from, is as always competent. He's not my favorite but he's a good actor. He could have been cuter but if they wanted cute and not actory they probably would have had the young Dennis Quaid guy play the part and then my review wouldn't be as positive. So, yeah, he was a good choice for the lead of the movie and carried it well.

The other characters in the film were pretty much stock and could have been swapped for other actors with different faces, voices, and generic Euro-trash accents. The Asian guy was good but he probably only stood out to me because he's Asian.

The cannibalism was a nice and creepy touch but I think after 9 centuries people would get protein poisoning, even with their nifty genetic alterations allowing them to adapt to long term spaceship living. No veggies and all protein equals scurvy doesn't it?

So, overall, I liked it. I rented it and I'm thinking about purchasing the blu-ray disk. I'd recommend it. Don't blast me for spoilers, I did put a spoiler warning at the beginning of my review and if my random ramblings spoil the movie for you because you neglected to take heed of my spoiler alert then oh wellsy.",1267488000,2,2793,4.378378378378378

Although nothing new in terms of things we haven't seen before (encapsulate a group of men/women and see how they react), the film is strung together differently enough to hold your attention. You never really know what's around the next corner.

The story is pretty common: Earth is doomed. Spaceships are sent out to find a habitable planet. One of these ships has been lost in space for some time, and when ship's pilot #4, Bower (Ben Foster,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3-10-to-Yuma/dp/B000XRO3MQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3:10 to Yuma</a>), wakes up from a prolonged hyper-sleep, much of his memory is gone or scrambled. Slowly things begin coming into focus as he finds various clues about who and where he's at. And not long after his awakening, another pod opens up and spills out Payton (Dennis Quaid,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vantage-Point/dp/B0018CWW3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vantage Point</a>), a high ranking officer who's memory is just as screwed up.

Bower is chosen to explore the ship, and getting out of their pod chamber is the first challenge since they're locked in for unknown reasons. Like giving birth, Bower squeezes through the canals of the ship's innards and is expelled onto what appears to be a dead ship. But he quickly runs into friends and foes. Some of the crew, it appears, have mutated and are cannibalistic. Others have had to do terrible things in order to fight and survive. All Bower wants to do is reactivate the ship's power systems and get to the bridge.

And that's about as far as I want to go without producing any spoilers....

There are several ""jump-in-your-seat"" moments that'll surprise the hell out of most viewers. And the darkness of the cold ship makes for some excellent atmosphere. The sound score also added a spooky quality to the production.

Ben Foster has rarely let me down in his choice of roles, and Pandorum was no exception. His embattled and continually challenged character was pitched just right throughout the film. It was also one of the first times I'd seen him as a main character and I was pleased to see it. He's a great young actor.

And I've saved the best for last: the filming. It was pretty amazing. Again, the dark qualities and claustrophobic shots were pulled off without feeling forced or contrived (something I can't say of all films ...like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Descent/dp/B000JJ5F0W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Descent</a>).

You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance...of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into: The Twilight Zone.

But unlike the classic 30 minute Twilight Zone episodes, you will enter into over 90 minutes of pandorum with Pandorum. Pandorum being defined as dementia brought on by extended periods of hypersleep / suspended animation. In other words, if this movie was edited down to 30 minutes, I'd have probably been inclined to suggest that you not miss this movie if you are a fan of the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twilight-Zone/dp/B000H5U5EE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twilight Zone</a>&nbsp;series. But what ultimately is delivered with this movie--since there really is no platform to bring this story to you in 30 minutes--is a fluffy sci-fi thriller that would have been great had the fluff been removed.

Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster are great in the lead roles and could have / should have carried this movie virtually solo. Picture two guys who wake up out of a very long hypersleep with the side effect of amnesia on a deep space mission to an Earth-like planet in a distant galaxy. They are locked inside the chamber where their hypersleep units are, and they need to find a way out of the chamber so that they can restore power to their ship in order to continue their journey.

Three key things happen: 1) One of the guys gets free of the hypersleep area. 2) They start to remember stuff. 3) They discover that their ship may be off course and that they may not be the only ones ""awake"" on the ship. (Okay, technically that's 4 things.)

What happens next is scary, intense and thrilling at times. Silly, goofy and unbelievable at times. Thought provoking and reminiscent of The Twilight Zone at times. But most of all just a long (really long) episode of The Twilight Zone. Which isn't a bad thing. I loved The Twilight Zone, but I loved it at 30 minutes a clip. 90 minutes to tell the Pandorum story just added too much goofy and length to keep it far from the reaches of greatness.

3968879,4,B002QW7AJY,"This is a great movie on all levels, CGI, acting, storyline, tension.  It is a typical sci-fi horror in a spaceship maroon atmosphere like ""Aliens"", ""Sunshine"" and many others.  I thought the spaceship maroon genre has been beaten to death, but what draws me to enjoy these movies are the fine acting.  This movie is tense and at no point I felt it got old.  What this movie really reminds me is that game Dead Space.  Dead Space did come out with an animation, but if it did a Hollywood movie this would be it.  The Liet and Corporal went at it like the Ren and Stimpy Maroon episode.  If you have seen ""The Descent"" this is very similar in style.

I don't want to give away too much of a plot or anything, but this is a fun to watch.  It looked great on blu-ray too.",1266451200,,768,4.170068027210885

You'll spend the entire movie asking what the heck the characters are doing, both because their actions make no sense and also since you will have figured out the plot sequence ages in advance.  That extends to the conclusion, as well.  Needless and obvious detours are taken in what I guess is an attempt to make this longer than the 30 minutes the story may deserve.  The camera bounces from one angle to the next, serving to both confuse and distract from the already sucktacular scenes.  Trust me, you'll walk away disgusted in the fact that you can't get the time you spent watching this movie back.",1266192000,15,655,4.516949152542373
3968881,3,B002QW7AJY,"Pandorum is very interesting from the sci-fi perspective: We have the ultimate spaceship, carrying what's left of mankind, planet Earth's biological supplies and knowledge to another Earth-like planet. The main premise is excellent, and the first quarter of the movie is pure sci-fi. The short prologue of the film is very cool and impressive.

Then, we have the 'scare' element, that when first showed makes little sense, but it is explained in part about the resolution of the story; if only this 'horror creature' were explained with a little more science instead of trying to deliver frequently the scare and fight element, this movie would have much been better. Nevertheless I must admit that when explained briefly, where the creatures could come from, it does makes a lot of sense, I really liked it. Also, there are two plot twists that serve the story. Another highlight, albeit very brief, is the ending; those who have read Arthur C. Clarke's ""The Songs from Distant Earth"" might remember the novel.

Resuming, the pros of this film are small pleasures for Sci-Fi fans, but the big picture remains, the flaws are also important: trying to give equal importance of main plot elements to the horror-creature-chase-fight stuff was a serious mistake. What should have been a very good and memorable Sci-fi flick (like District 9 or even Predator) is degraded to the level of lesser items (Aliens Vs. Predator, Ultraviolet, Resident Evil) and accepting the influence of great films like Alien and best elements of Event Horizon, is not enough to save Pandorum. So what we have is a movie in where story-wise the Science Fiction departament is good but superficial in delivering and the Horror Department fails miserably (nevertheless, a child-creature was indeed weirdly freaky, but Science can take over that). Acting is OK from the two leads and of course you get the hot chick, the asian-Mortal-Kombat-fighter and the cannibal freak, these last two completely disposable and useless characters (I liked the chic!). Production design is good, and space FX (not a lot, wish there would be more) are very good.

I'd never call this movie 'stupid' or 'terrible' like some suggest, being a sci-fi fan means one have to be open minded, not accepting any trash of course, but at least to acknowledge the sci-fi value in films of the genre: when the space probe lands for the first time in another earthly planet it is well done, but again, very brief; the short history lesson of a previous space mission is eerie. Best of all, Pandorum could be used as a cautionary tale (not like Avatar, where the 'message' is in your face) like what would happen if we must leave Earth definitely, the dangers of it and in WHAT would we become; if we destroy Earth and leave to another star system, isn't much better to take care of our planet, the only one we have to live in?

Until now we did not have a movie with such a heavy theme about the very survival of the last of the humankind depending on space travel (some would say Sunshine, I say 'meeh!'), but if you ask me I'd prefer a movie adaptation of The Songs from Distant Earth, instead, I get Pandorum, life isn't perfect.

Surely Pandorum will be my guilty pleasure in my movie collection, recommend to rent before buying if you are a Sci-Fi fan; if not, you might want to stay away.",1266105600,4,3335,4.772963604852686

3968883,2,B002QW7AJY,"Pandorum starts off both well combining horror and suspense as Bower (Ben Foster) wakes from suspended animation aboard the spaceship Elysium. The affects of long-term suspended animation includes memory loss. We are thus faced with suspense as Bower attempts to remember where he is, and also, who he is.

The ships systems aren't working well and it seems he and (fellow crew-man) Peyton (Dennis Quaid) have another menace on-board; ravenous flesh-eating hunter-creatures.

The ship's cargo are thousands of people also in suspended animation - all hopefuls for a distant planet and a new start after the failure of earth to support life.

Along the way Bower meets passengers Manh (Cung Le) and Nadia (Antje Traue) both living against the odds against the hunter-creatures. Manh doesn't speak English. Bower must join with them to reach the engines to re-set them, or all the systems will fail.

Peyton stays behind in a commmand area to guide him but is soon met with a crazy crewman Gallo (Cam Gigandet) who may be suffering from Pandorum, a pychosis from space travel.

Then plot faults develop. Where the hunter-creatures come from is never explained. Nadia takes a guess, but that's it.

Why she nor Manh have ever attempted to revive any other passengers in order to gain help against them is never explained.

They meet up with Leland (Eddie Rouse) who somehow knows how the ship came to be in the state it is, and what happened to the three bridge crew even though there's no way he could know. He's also decided to survive by eating people.

3968886,1,B002QW7AJY,"I'm pretty disappointed I paid $1 to rent this from the local Redbox. That should give you an idea of how bad this is. I was expecting some kind of sci fi plot, but this movie failed to deliver it. It failed to deliver any plot, really. I'd say roughly the first half of the movie you have no idea what's going on, which in some cases would be acceptable, but in a sci fi movie it's bad because you get little or no plot development, making the movie fall flat. There's nothing interesting about sci fi movies that don't include at least some kind of plot development, be it a simple ""we're going to outer space"", ""there are some aliens over there"" or on the other end of the spectrum, a full-blown, detailed mini-universe like Frank Herbert's Dune. This movie lacks any sort of interesting plot. You know they're on a spaceship and there are these creatures that want to kill them. That's all you get for plot until the last 3 minutes of the movie.

The horror element never gets fully developed either; it's a very simple, one-dimensional type of horror that is only scary because there are creatures on the ship that want to kill them. It never gets any more scary than the characters thinking ""we might die."" I won't give away any plot, but after 10 minutes it's not even remotely scary anymore and you really just want to know why the plot is not advancing. It was a bunch of random things going on and you have no idea what to make of all of it. This was beyond frustrating. I kept watching and waiting, hoping it would get interesting. It did not. This movie never advances beyond ""there are things that want to kill us."" That would be fine if they could make it interesting, but this is a short intro, an hour and 15 mins of that, and a quick anti-climactic ending.

Finally when we the audience find out what really was going on, it was so incredibly anti-climactic that I really wanted to shout at the tv. This is not a good sci fi movie. This is not a good horror movie. I couldn't think of anything about it that I liked except the first few minutes were interesting. There wasn't even any gratuitous female nudity (a la Starship Troopers) to at least add some redemptive, albeit superficial, value. The fight scenes were pathetic, and technology isn't emphasized as being important. All you get is a spaceship that isn't working like it's supposed to.

This movie was not worth the $1 I spent to rent it. I've seen hundreds of movies, and I'm a huge science fiction fan, and this was one of the worst ever. I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed. The depressing thing is that the first 10-15 minutes are actually fairly good, but it just never goes anywhere. If you like being frustrated for an hour and a half and then having an abrupt and anti-climatic finish with no resolution, this is your movie.

Update: I'm a big fan of real science fiction: Herbert, Clarke, Heinlein, and Asimov to name a few. They created mini-universes and had real plot in their writing. Movies should have some sort of depth to them or they're boring. Sure it's fun to watch a goofy action/scifi film like Starship Troopers, but even that one had probably ten times as much plot development as Pandorum. This movie does not make you stop and think. It doesn't make you want to watch it again.

I see that a lot of people don't find my review helpful. I guess more people need to be exposed to real science fiction, because honestly, this movie is trash. It's not a good action film. It's not a good horror film. It's not a good science fiction film. It's a mash up of various elements that really have no cohesion once you get to the end. This wouldn't even have mattered if it had been entertaining, but it was not. This movie deserves 1 star, so that's how I'm rating it.

*spoiler*

There are no aliens, they're mutated humans. The movie tag is wrong.
The ship landed on the alien planet and was on the ocean floor for 800 years, so humans who had been given experimental drugs mutated and became these bloodthirsty creatures that somehow were able to mutate and survive on the ship for 800 years.

3968889,4,B002QW7AJY,"So close.... This movie had alot going for it, it really did. Could have possibly gone down among the greats, however, a few flaws kept it back. The biggest problem with this guy is the creature design. First off they are a re-hash of the creatures featured in the descent. They have that jerky camera trick movement which has not only been done a million times before, but actually takes you out of the scene because of it's implosability. Secondly, they somehow, even though they are carnal creaturs, fashioned a unified mad max uniform. No idea where they got this gear, or how they all got together to approve of the design, but apparentrly they did. Some of the characters are forced and don't really make sense, namely the fighting amongst themselves. The main female character starts off as a farrel amazon woman who attacks everyone, then almost instantly turns around as a likeable scientist, all anamosity forgoten. The atmosphere is great, the concept really good, I love how they presented the hypersleep thing, and the twist ending is executed very well.

3968891,3,B002QW7AJY,"Imagine: you wake up from hypersleep in the dead of space, with no memory of who you are or where you are.  This is the predicament Bower (Ben Foster) finds himself in.  Soon he regains some memory, and encounters Payton (Dennis Quaid), who also cannot remember where they are or how they got there.  Of course, this is a horror movie, and soon memory loss is the least of these guys' problems: their ship is inhabited with a race of fierce, fast creatures that have a taste for human flesh, and who seem to be almost impossible to stop.  Duhn-duhn-duhn...

Okay, so maybe I simplified things a bit.  PANDORUM has a great premise; unfortunately, after a while that premise kind of withers away, until the film becomes something of a creature feature.  I'd compare it to THE DESCENT, another great-starting horror film that petered out about halfway through.  Fortunately, PANDORUM picks itself up again near the end, with a couple of twists that, if not amazing, are at least interesting and enjoyable.  And throughout, we get the solid acting of Ben Foster; he pretty much carries this film, and is really the sole reason to watch.  Quaid's performance is also strong, especially as his character develops, but it's Foster who shines in a script riddled with some cheesy dialog and predictable scares.  The atmosphere is intense (though not as claustrophobic as it should be, perhaps), and the creature-effects (actual actors in makeup, thank God) are above-par, though I don't understand how everyone on board the ship (with the exception of Bower and Payton) knows karate.  There are also a few plot points never fully realized or explained, and that leads to a somewhat disappointing ending.  Still: If you're a fan of the genre, you'll like the film, and it's certainly worth watching.  Foster's performance is the strongest point here, but like I said, if you enjoy the genre, you'll enjoy this film.",1264636800,3,1906,4.87888198757764
3968892,5,B002QW7AJY,"So many people these days want to do movie comparisons with just about every new title that's released...here is another one getting that same treatment.  These are the movies I have seen this one compared to:  ""Alien,"" ""Solaris,"" ""Event Horizon,"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""  This flagrant need to compare movies is largely due, in my opinion, to Hollywood's decade long quandary with not being able to come up with much new material...everything has already been done...and everyone has been conditioned to not expect anything new from that corner of the planet.  Well, I'm not buyin' it!  Books pour out of author's imaginations and onto the shelves of our local bookstores on a daily basis, and they are ALL different from the next.  If book writers can do it, then I'm sure movie writers can do it as well.  And this movie is no exception.  It has plenty of newness to it.  As a matter of fact, once you get through the creepy and atmospheric body of ""Pandorum,"" which takes place on a spaceship meant to transport everything needed to start anew on another planet much like Earth, and finally reach the climactic ending, the breath of fresh air is resultant of a movie that never let on where it was going, reveals a story that has never been told (even remotely), and leaves the watcher with good feelings in their hearts...feelings of hope and reverie.  The acting is superb by all in attendance, although, I believe Ben Foster should have gotten top billing, not Dennis Quaid.  The vast majority of the time spent here is centered around Ben's character, whereas, Dennis' character doesn't do much more than try to stay connected with him from another part of the ship.  All in all, ""Pandorum"" delivered on all eight cylinders.  It had suspense, tension, depth, a well-thought-out plot, exceptional acting, production, and direction, creepiness, absorption, and reward.  If you like the sci-fi/horror type thing, DON'T MISS IT!!!!!
Five Stars *****",1264636800,63,1958,4.911854103343465
3968893,4,B002QW7AJY,"""Pandorum"" is reminiscent of the feature film ""Alien"" and the original ""Twilight Zone"" TV shows in its expert use of suspense and the unexpected to convey escalating fear.  Two astronauts, Lt. Payton (Dennis Quaid) and Corporal Bower (Ben Foster) wake up in a sleep chamber aboard the seemingly abandoned spacecraft Elysium.  It's pitch black, they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the ship.  They can't remember anything.  Who are they?  What is their mission?  While Payton mans the radio, Bower ventures deep into the ship, attempting to gain a clue to the noises, and discovers they are not alone.
 Travis Milloy's script works nicely as mystery/thriller, with revelations doled out and interesting characters introduced along the way -- Nadia (Antje Traue), a defensive woman;  Manh (Cung Le), a non-English-speaking commando; and Leland (Eddie Rouse), who has been awake the longest and might be in greatest danger.
 It's difficult not to see similarities between ""Pandorum"" and 1979's ""Alien,"" which set the standard for horror in outer space.  ""Pandorum"" expands on ""Alien"" by introducing cannibalism, martial arts, and the title ailment -- a psychological disorder caused by deep space travel, resulting in extreme paranoia.
 Director Christian Alvart (""Antibodies,"" ""Case 39"") succeeds in creating and sustaining an eerie, dangerous environment that helps raise ""Pandorum"" from a mere action picture to an exercise in escalating terror.  The early scenes are best, when the viewer feels the atmosphere but sees little tangible threat.
 Unfortunately, Alvart tosses too much into the film.  Rather than developing the story gradually to its final, key revelations, he opts for elaborately choreographed fights, ugly mutant creatures, and a curious, unpredictable affliction that can affect people in peculiar, sometimes frightening ways.

Dennis Quaid is not entirely convincing as the lieutenant, but Ben Harper does a great job capturing the emotions of confusion, fear, and determination that drive his character.

My only problem with the film is that the timeline was never made clear. It's obviously been a long time. *minor spoiler* If the antagonists are mutated humans, then they've been in hypersleep long enough for evolution to take place. However, the actual timeline or methodology of what chambers are opened and when is never explored.

It turned out to be worth it.  Without ruining the ending, I will just say that it worked out logically and still had a good twist which was not at all predictable.",1264550400,2,594,3.925
3968896,4,B002QW7AJY,"Waking up can sometimes be a nightmare. And that nightmare can be amplified when you have no idea what is going on around you. As viewers we know the world has gone down hill and the population has slowly skyrocketed, leading to warring over limitations of the Earth's remaining fossil fuels. In the year 2174 a ship is lauched, reaching to the stars to solve a few problems. Passengers - 60,000. Destination - You find that out later in the movie. People you find yourself trying to really figure out - 2. And the amount of horrors creeping around this monstrosity of a ship - a bunch.

Pandorum takes the idea of being inside of something confined and pushes it to another level, allowing terrible things to happen both in the minds and to the bodies of - everyone. We see our first person wake up and wonder what is going on, and find that he has overslept by about 8 years. He awakens another person to see if they know anything, and the two of them seem like Batman and a lazier Batman (I can't ever remember Batman just hanging back and saying ""go here,"" but I'm not calling anyone Robin). They want to find a way onto the flight deck, to the eyes of the sky, and finally to that wonderful thing called ""an explanation."" The problem is that there are horrors along the way and that there are terrible people blocking they path and, really, you have no idea what the world is capable of when you've been asleep that long.

Personally, I liked the story, the nice little ending, the count that was remaining when the credits rolled (although I kept wondering what would happen now and what would happen if any of those - things - decided to do the same thing everyone else was doing), and the way the truth was unveiled. It was all tragically terrible and it was all hideously mean and, in the end, it could have been seen if one wanted to see it. Does that mean the movie was bad? No way. When that first - whatever - opted to come out and play, I kept thinking how badly things could be. I had heard this being compared to Alien, but this was no alien to me. It played a different game, a hidden sport, and didn't have an LV-426 to hide itself inside. There is a secret, sure, and the plot is explained if a person stares at it hard enough. But most movies seem like that these days.

Should you see it? I liked it but that might not mean you will. There are oddities and there are twists, but this is not an illusion that makes you paw at your remote to get another fix from it. I still liked it alot, though, and I liked the way the running story kept you entertained. There were new add-ons, sure, and I thought our main man (whom I really like as an actor) was a bit more trusting than I. Then again, I didn't spend any time tied to the ceiling, being looked at like BBQ (or did I - hmmmm).
You really should give the movie a chance if the genre appeals to you. It might have something inside the ship that makes you think ""no voyages in the future for me, no matter what.""",1264464000,2,2983,4.239015817223199

Yes the basic premise has been done before but ""Pandorum"" puts a new spin on things that keeps the story fresh and intriguing. The final twist is new and different, even if the characters aren't quite so (although Dennis Quaid was very good as the level-headed, unflappable captain trapped alone). The acting was solid.

Something I enjoyed that I haven't seen in a horror movie in a long time is the less-is-more approach that the director took with the violence and gore for the bulk of the movie. I think it made things more sinister and mysterious and it kept me guessing at just how dire the situation was and how long it had been going on (is it just a few monsters? How monstrous are they, anyway? Are they completely feral or are they sentient? Have they been eking out a pathetic existence for a few years or for decades?).

Don't pass ""Pandorum"" up just because you think you might have seen it before in the form of other movies. There's a good chance you will be pleasantly surprised, especially if you enjoy the genre. I know we were.",1264118400,5,1389,4.684426229508197

3968905,3,B002QW7AJY,"PANDORUM is a decent movie that exploits the old ""monster on board"" syndrome that Alien masterfully created back in the day.  It is almost like a ""zombies in space"" epic.  This should come as no surprise considering the fact that people involved in the RESIDENT EVIL movies were involved in the making.  Immediately watchable and full of typical sci-fi/horror fun, PANDORUM is a film that most enthusiasts will enjoy.  The film has some seriously redeeming qualities and some original concepts.  The paranoid members of the crew and the desperate desire they have to figure out what is going on is very well played.  The plot is a little herky-jerky but still a very fun film.

3968907,4,B002QW7AJY,"See the movie BELOW, about the WW2 submarine?  A sleeper right?  Seeing this with low expectations reminded me of seeing that with low expectations.  Especially when the ending credits came up and I realized that they made it all the way to the end without losing it.

When I first saw the trailers for Pandorum I said (as it seems a few others did), well, I gotta see it but it's probably another Event Horizon or an Aliens(1 or 2) ripoff attempt or a space zombie ""bug hunt"".  (And I joked with my wife that Quaid must need some quick cash to re-do his basement or something, and he'd probably be killed off in the third scene when it's too late to get your ticket money back.)

Not that there's anything wrong with any of those things, Event Horizon was good for the first half till it overexplained the obvious, Aliens 1/2 were classics that deserve homage and Resident Evil (1 and 3) were great zombie fun with excellent fight dancing.  (And every actor is human with human cash needs.)

I missed this in the theatre and forgot about it till I went looking for MOON on DVD and noticed this came out at the same time, MOON was out of stock so I got this.

It's good, I have to say it's really good.  Like all science fiction / horror fans I pride myself on being able to guess the inevitable twist and I'm pretty good but not this time.  Not for the multiple twists.

After being SOOOOOOOOOOOO INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED by Avatar's ripping off Every Lousy children's use-syfy-to-cover-the-stinking-preaching storyline, this Pandorum film was a refreshing fun adult Action/SF flick.

Good multiple ending twists, fun and toe-curling fight scenes with well done good-olde ""bug hunting"" ;-) and a final ending that while ""happy"" actually worked well and satisfied without feeling like it was tacked on just because it tested well.

Glad I bought it, it's a keeper.  Cudos to the crew and cast.  Remember guys, the good SF usually doesn't do well at the box office but eventually rises to the top in home sales.",1264032000,112,2009,4.616901408450704
3968908,3,B002QW7AJY,"Science fiction movies have taken the public by storm year after year. The current top grossing film of the year AVATAR is proof of that. And yet there are many smaller sci fi films that get less attention but are picked up by fans of the genre. Such is the case with PANDORUM.

In the future space is running out, populations are growing and a new home for humans needs to be found. Enter the space ship Elysium and its crew. Setting off to find a new planet we can inhabit, the crew is placed in cryogenic sleep waking in rotating shifts to make sure things run smoothly. Along for the ride and asleep are some 60,000 passengers.

Waking for their shift is Bower (Ben Foster), reeling from temporary loss of memory and shakes, a part of the waking process. Bower dresses and then wakes his supervisor Payton (Dennis Quaid). Unable to access the ship's bridge, Bower climbs up and begins crawling through the ventilation ducts while Payton gives him guidance via the ship's computers.

While Bower travels the shaft, Payton talks to him about pandorum, a psychological condition brought about by long term cryogenic hibernation and space travel. Symptoms include paranoia, hallucinations, shakes and homicidal tendencies. Now along with the natural dangers onboard, the duo have to hope they don't fall victim to this condition.

A fall down a shaft lands Bower in another portion of the ship. Here he is able to access a different tunnel and moving through it he encounters another human being awake. But Nadia (Antje Traue) doesn't appear to be normal. Dirty and disheveled, she seems to be living at wits end, avoiding something yet unseen but not for long. More of a warrior woman than crew member, Nadia resists helping Bower at first, then begins educating him to how things have changed. The first change is a group of blue skinned mutants tracking down the pair in an attempt to capture them.

Communication between Bower and Payton has been shot when Bower landed on his com link. On his own, Bower enlists Nadia's help and another person he comes across in an attempt to get to the ships main reactor. The cycle of the reactor calls for it to shut down every so often and in so doing prevent the ship from full power capacity. Along the way Bower and his group are hunted by the blue creatures that we discover are a cannibalistic bunch who view them as the blue plate special.

In the meantime, Payton finds another crew member as well, arriving in the area we began in and in bad shape. Gallo (Cam Gigandet) seems to be in shock. Or is it the first stages of pandorum? Only time will tell and a verbal cat and mouse game between Gallo and Payton begins.

The action in the film jumps back and forth between the two stories, Bower in a more adventurous mode that becomes more physical as he tries to reach the reactor while being hunted. The other tale is of Payton and Gallo as each one attempts to outmaneuver the other in their verbal sparring. While Bower's path seems the most dangerous, the one followed by Payton revealed near the film's end is much more dangerous.

The film results in a nice twist that I for one didn't see coming. And its one of those twists where to give it away would ruin it for the first time viewer. Suffice to say that if you stick through till the end, you won't be disappointed.

So is the film the best sci fi movie out there? Not quite. For all of its gritty, metal clad look, the type of spaceship we've seen in numerous films since the release of ALIEN, the movie feels like its bouncing back and forth over too much terrain. Sure the stories keep your interests, but at the same time talk comes at the expense of action and action at the expense of talk. They often seem in the wrong place.

Quaid and Foster turn in equally impressive performances. Both have their own reasons to go on living and to see that the mission is accomplished. But they're nowhere near the same reasons.

Twenty years from now only die hard fans will recall this movie. It's not ALIEN or 2001. But it is a good evening's entertainment and that makes it worth giving it a watch.

3968910,4,B002QW7AJY,"What seemed in previews to be ""Event Horizon redux"" (which is ironic considering that Event Horizon director Paul W.S. Anderson is a producer here), Pandorum proves to be just about anything but.  Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid play crew members on a ship that is the last hope for the survival of humanity, and wake up with no memory of their identities or their mission.  As the film goes on, both men grow to discover other survivors, as well as the fact that they are definitely not alone on the ship.  I really don't want to say any more for fear of spoiling the surprises that lie within Pandorum, but it is safe to say that the film delivers the goods in terms of frights, suspense, gore, and overall mind messing.  Though there are a number of plot holes to find, director Christian Alvart, who helmed the internationally acclaimed Antibodies, provides so much visual flair and grimy creepiness that it just ends up being hard to look away from the finished product and find anything wrong with it.  It helps that Quaid and especially Foster are put to excellent use here as well, with Foster proving once again that he has become one of the most formidable, and underrated, actors around today.  All in all, no matter how derivative Pandorum may look to you at first glance, give it a shot.  You will indeed be glad that you did.",1263859200,8,1335,4.560669456066946
3968911,5,B002QW7AJY,"I usually do not go for the creature films but this sci-fi roped me in right away with another great performance by Foster, the standard from Quaid, and even a nice break-out showing by that OC/Twilight alum Gigandet. They postponed this title for a month for a variety of reasons and customers have been requesting it since November, and I think most will not be disappointed with what the Blu has to offer.

The picture clarity gets some valid tests intermittently, with the majority of the film taking place in dark corridors and an overall dank ship, your black level/display is hopefully tuned ideal for this. There are only four scenes of brightness, and the final end sequence did not use the best effects so the shortcomings show more than desired, but the creatures (Winston's group I believe) looked great with those fluorescent spikes not drowning the line definition at all. The sound was a mixed bag, at times an outstanding reference for True HD with the cavern-type mix to outright screamings through the center channel. I counted only three times that dialogue was drowned out by a poor mix, and with how they overamped the high pitch I could not turn up the sound much past a normal level. The supplements are also a mixed wish list, including:

* Deleted scenes, 28 minutes. This includes an alternate ending which would help answer the nagging questions about who does what in the ship. Some alternate versions of the same scenes, usually just some added dialogue quips, albeit there is one perverse scene that was sick. Worth the watch if you are a fan of the film.
* World of Elysium, 14 minutes. A clip-heavy promo piece that covers set design and a few facets about working for the director.
* Nadia's team, 4:10 minutes. A completely forgettable Quarantine/Blair Witch clip about some crew members who record their last moments aboard the ship before being eaten - lame.
* Flight Team Training Video, 2:45 minutes. Felt like a Starship Troopers type ad film, except for this version of reality.
* Picture galleries, four total with roughly 100 pics/storyboards. You have to really like the storyboard thing here, there are a few nice pics of the set though.
* Disc 2 is the Dig Copy, Windows only.
* Commentary by Alvert and Bolt, technical heavy.

It does not provide all of the answers desired, but Foster is fun to watch and the idea of how it ends is inspiring, could make a great follow-up film. Enjoy.",1263686400,8,2542,4.733634311512415

It did just that, exceeding my slightly lowered expectations.  If you're worried, like I was, that this might be just another lazy psychological horror where in the end, everything ends up being just the product of the main characters dementia rather something real, don't be.  The story is more ambitious than that and this is a far more ambitious production than Anchor Bay's norm as well.  It's clear that the creative talent really cared about the project and it doesn't look or feel as if it's been shackled by budget or rushed.  Intense action drives this mystery thriller, which, while a little convoluted, proves wholly worthwhile for those that see it through.

This is also a very strong BD offering from Anchor Bay.  Despite the dark photography, compression is respectable, allowing the HD video to render the film far more capably and faithfully that DVD.  Accompanied by a driving lossless audio track, the experience is pretty intense.  The discs extras are probably more fun than informative, including over 20 minutes of deleted footage and an original promotional short.

Pandorum smells like a made for TV movie that snuck into the theater, maybe another crap movie propped open the back door with a trash can so it could sneak in. I have NEVER found myself critiquing camera angles in a movie.....

The monsters look horrible in this, it's as if the rest of the movie is serious and the creatures are jokes, it would have been so much better if they said ""hey instead of cheesy dead space rip off monsters, lets just make them regular people who were desperate and resorted to cannibalism once in a while, maybe more of a political theme here"".

That's okay though, most movies borrow from each other anyway.

I give it 3-stars because the movie was rather slow-going in the beginning and it didn't really gain my interest until we were about in the last third of the film. This is one you have to sit through to get the pay-off at the end of the film. Plus, I have seen my fair share of ""the last remaining humans"" fighting for humanity and attempting to destroy the creatures that threaten humanity, so the whole middle third of the movie which dealt with that theme and was little more than an action film something like ""The Blade"" (1998) didn't really interest me. Though perhaps if you haven't seen as many films as I have, you might find it unique or enjoyable.

Pandorum was really a pretty decent flick. It was by no means a perfect movie, but probably one of the top 10 Sci-Fi films of 2009.

The basic premise (this plot was really fun as it untangled itself, so it's difficult to describe without any spoilers, but here it goes):

The main character (played by Ben Foster, from Bang Bang You're Dead, and ""Angel"" from X-Men) wakes up with Dennis Quaid on a ridiculously large space ship, after being in cryogenic stasis for many years.

The problem is that being in stasis for so long causes severe disorientation, so the two officers slowly remember who they are, their jobs, their mission... and, they're locked out of the bridge for some reason.

As their memories slowly come back, and they discover a few more passengers, they realize there are huge problems with the ship and the crew - some stasis chambers are empty, the bridge appears to have been sabotaged, life support is failing, and the other officers cannot be found. But the biggest problem -- there is something or someone on the ship who may be killing people.

Are they aliens? mutated humans? a saboteur? As the small crew try to run for their lives and solve the mystery, they begin to realize that the cargo they're hauling may save humanity itself.

The viewer is left slightly disoriented by the time it's all said and done. There's at least two twists in there and several complicated conversations explaining what's actually going on. The other big problem for me was the fight scenes. Even though Christian Alvart is in the director's chair this time around, it seems as though some of Anderson's filming techniques left an impression on him as I remember having the same problem during the Resident Evil films (mainly Apocalypse). It's just hard to make out what's going on at times. You know someone has been stabbed or punched or kicked, but the camera zipping around so much sometimes makes it hard to see who is doing what.

While Pandorum's storyline does seem to have about three turns too many and it's a bit difficult to make out what's going on when the action gets intense, it still managed to meet my expectations and be exactly what I was looking for with this type of film. Ben Foster definitely steals the show (Dennis Quaid is pretty good, as well) and the creatures in the film look similar to the ones from The Descent, which makes me think of this film as the offspring of Event Horizon and The Descent.

3968960,3,B002QW7AJY,"This movie will get alot of bad reviews. The acting isn't the greatest and the story has some holes in it. The characters are also not developed enough. So you basically have no idea what there lives were like before they woke up 900 years into the future. With that being said, This movie is not a bad movie. It's actually one of the best action sci-fi films i've seen i a while. The fighting scenes are very intense and the space creatures are actually scary. They remind me of the creatures from the movie The Descent with shoulder pads on. You will not get bored watching this movie. I'm actually going to watch it again. I still have not figured out if the creatures are from space or not. They might actually be humans that have evolved over time. This was said in the movie. So go ahead and rent this one. It's not the best movie ever but it definately delivers as a Intense Action Flick. Holla!",1257984000,,902,4.34319526627219

All the comparisons everyone and their mothers are making when reviewing this film, and no one seems to have lit on the same one I did: Paul W. S. Anderson's gorgeous, if ultimately minor, film Event Horizon, to which this is a brother in just about every way. It is, however, not the brother I think anyone was expecting; while kind of lovable, it's still hideously deformed, and will likely bite your toes off if you get too close.

Alvart (who is currently giving the Hollywood-remake treatment to his own film Antibodies) gives us the tale of a couple of astronauts, Payton (Dennis Quaid, whose dance card has been filled with awful films for the past few years) and Bower (3:10 to Yuma's Ben Foster), who wake up on a spaceship to discover that Earth seems to have disappeared while they were on their way to colonize a new planet, Talos, with fifty thousand pieces of human cargo. Problem is, none of the rest of the crew seems to still be on the ship, so Payton and Bower have to figure out what happened to them, and what jeeps making those nasty noises coming from the air vents. Eventually they find out they're not the only survivors, but... let's not soil it, in case you do decide to see this mess.

The movie is going for the heavy-atmosphere feel, and for the first half-hour or so, while this is still a two-person gig, it works. After that, it becomes your basic survival-horror romp (think another Anderson movie, Resident Evil, meets Dark Star, but with aliens who are nowhere near as cute as the latter's beach-ball-with-claws).  Some really nice ideas to be found here (especially concerning the title; if you don't know what it means yet, I won't spoil it for you), but the writer decided to abandon the intelligent bits early on and go for the cheap thrills. A big mistake, IMO, but the movie is still worth seeing for the first half-hour of Foster's performance, at least. **",1255478400,7,1934,4.629737609329446

8378009,5,B002QW7AJY,"One of my favorite post-apocalyptic space films. I wish there were many more like it.  Great characters and acting, a great plot and idea for a story.  The set, the costuming, and the environment that the movie was shot in...that's really what was most impressive and deserves recognition.  I would happily watch a lot more from these movie makers.",1514246400,,348,4.864406779661017

8378013,5,B002QW7AJY,"This film is in a class of its own, a true gem. I originally saw it close to its release, drawn in by Ben Foster, then completely transfixed by the whole thing. Production design is tops, costume and monster makeup is original, script and scenes are well paced. The first time you see it, the score makes you feel apart of the tension and fear characters are experiencing. The film stays with you, I think about the final scene sometimes, it ends in an interesting note, and every few years I rewatch this.",1510963200,,506,4.451612903225806
