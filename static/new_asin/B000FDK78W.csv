2561642,5,B000FDK78W,"It was a present for my son-in-law overseas who has been wanting to learn a better way of swimming, better than average.  When receiving the dvd and watching it, he could hardly wait to run down to the local pool and try it before he even finished the dvd.  He says he loves it.  He will probably pass on what he learns to his wife and two children.  He was originally looking for a dvd called ""Swim Like a Fish"", (maybe in German?), but could never find it.  Mr Laughlin mentions swimming like a fish, so I'm guessing that the idea is very much similar.",1174003200,,554,4.238095238095238

2561644,5,B000FDK78W,"If you're starting from scratch like I was, this is the only guide you need for learning freestyle.  Terry's program takes you from novice to intermediate quickly.

2561646,5,B000FDK78W,"I know, it is like learning to walk all over again! But I wish someone had taught me this in the beginning. I spend hours looking like a fool drilling up and down the pool, floating on my back, switching, skating BUT hey my reward will come on Triathlon Day!

Great help... Thanks",1170892800,,280,4.283018867924528
2561647,5,B000FDK78W,"I watch this dvd prior to swimming. The many different techniques can be practiced without an instructor, if classes are not available.  It serves as a real self-help in swimming.",1168041600,3,179,4.966666666666667
2561648,5,B000FDK78W,I bought this dvd because I wanted to increase my swimming stamina.  This dvd is awesome.  I got it only about 2 weeks ago and have already noticed a considerable difference in my perceived effort--I'm swimming with much less effort and have been able to increase my lap swims considerably.  Even though the dvd is only about 30 min. long I think it is definitely worth buying especially if you are thinking of getting personal swimming coaches.  I highly recommend buying this dvd first to see if you still need one on one swim instructors.,1156809600,30,541,4.663157894736842
2561649,4,B000FDK78W,"Very useful video for begniers who is finding difficulty in kicks and balancing.

2561650,5,B000FDK78W,"The Freestyle: Made Easy video is excellent and easy to follow.  However, to really learn the techniques covered, you really need a coach who knows the technique.  The video suggests that you use another person as a coach, but unless your coach knows the technique it's difficult to master.",1153612800,16,290,4.8979591836734695
2561651,4,B000FDK78W,"After reading the TI book and not getting too far, I thought that I'd try the video so I could actually see how the drills should be done. When I unpacked the video I was fairly shocked to see that my not-very-cheap DVD came in an el-cheapo paper slip cover. After loading the DVD I was equally surprised by  the cheesy music and videography.

Overall, I think that the content of the video was excellent, but I definitely expected a higher quality production based on the relatively high price tag.",1149984000,82,499,4.533333333333333
2561661,4,B000FDK78W,This definitely helped me swim better. DVD was damaged though and skipped in a section so I didn't get a portion of the video.,1419206400,,126,4.291666666666667
2561662,4,B000FDK78W,"Would have been better to have more ""basic"" instruction, breaking down each and every step, instead of a ""glaze over"" of the various steps. Overall, a good instructional DVD.",1417910400,,174,5.0344827586206895
2561663,5,B000FDK78W,Even if it just makes you think about swimming more hydrodynamically then it helps.  I bought the DVD and book.,1402963200,,111,4.55
2561664,4,B000FDK78W,"I haven't given 5 stars because I think that this DVD should be sold as a whole with the book written by Terry Laughlin ""Triathlon Swimming Made easy"" because alone it's not sufficient for an indeep comprehension of the TI method.

I love, as in every Terry Laughlin works, the attitude toward performance: results are a consequence of an improving process that make every training interesting and never boring.",1400803200,2,411,4.956521739130435
2561665,5,B000FDK78W,I took 3 swimming classes and could not propel with my feet.  I actually went backwards with a handboard.  I was amazed that I went forward with this method and it helped me learn how to use my feet to swim.  It was a very relaxing swimming this way.,1396828800,,250,4.061224489795919
2561666,5,B000FDK78W,"I'm training for my first triathlon in April. This book has revolutionized the way I look at swimming and has caused a bit of an addiction in that I now LOVE to swim.
I'm a heavyset guy, so swimming at a fast pace has rarely been easy. This guide has improved my balance, hydrodynamics, and breathing...all in a series of drills that make the time fly by. I can easily spend an hour in the pool and not even realize it.
A great, great tutorial. The production quality isn't the highest, but who cares? Honestly, it's informative and gives perfect demonstrations.",1389657600,5,562,4.574257425742574
2561667,5,B000FDK78W,"Had a goal to do a triathlon and had no idea how to swim with efficiency. This helped me become a smoother swimmer through practice and exercises.  Definitely made swimming easier than it was when I started. Loved to see each stroke demonstrated and then see the improvement as I practiced.

Borrowed it from a friend.
Worked on the exercises and could swim really well within 2 months.

2561669,5,B000FDK78W,Treat it as a reference and go back watching it over and over. I am still practicing and hoping to master it one day soon.,1364601600,,122,3.92
2561670,5,B000FDK78W,Nice book.  Clearly written.  Better if in conjunction to personal training.  Makes a great review of different strokes.  But the swimmer always needs someone watching to spot problem areas.,1361577600,,190,5.448275862068965
2561671,4,B000FDK78W,"This was informative, very in depth on the concept.  Could use more beginner drills and illustrations, i would not recommend buying without the DVD to accompany it.",1361232000,,164,5.074074074074074
2561672,5,B000FDK78W,I learned how to swim and learned how to undo what I learned years ago.  Cheesy music but straight to the point and teaches you how to be a better swimmer.,1337040000,,155,4.0
2561673,4,B000FDK78W,"First off, let me say that between the book and the DVD, my stroke has improved incredibly.  I swim faster (10 seconds faster in the 400), I dropped two strokes per length (from 16-17 to 14-15 in a 25-yard pool), and my swimming is effortless.  I strongly recommend this TI method.

However, the book, by itself, is not enough.  If you are going to go this route, get the book and the DVD.  I can't imagine only having one and understanding things well enough to make progress.

The TI method has been great for me.  I am largely self-taught, but have taken a few sets of lessons over the years.  However, this was a major breakthrough.  It's almost like cheating.  I plan to take lessons from a TI-certified instructor.",1322179200,7,720,4.511627906976744
2561674,5,B000FDK78W,"A friend told me about Total Immersion Swimming and I wanted to learn more about it.  I read a book about it but then I wanted to see the strokes in action.  The DVD covers the freestyle in detail and has been very helpful in understanding how to execute the stroke.  The DVD only covers freestyle and not the other strokes.

After reading the book and seeing the video I have decided to start taking private lessons in the method.  I am in my sixties and physically active and look to swimming as being a little less stressful on my body  than running and biking.

I recommend the book and DVD to anyone who wants to improve their endurance in swimming.",1311638400,2,654,4.355371900826446
2561675,3,B000FDK78W,"The video is not of instructional quality.  It just shows a bunch of swimmers doing different techniques.  What's the point of showing so many different swimmers?  It's not helpful at all.  Focus on technique and what to do, rather the showing how different swimmers do things slightly differently.  Very annoying.",1309219200,,314,5.2
2561676,5,B000FDK78W,"I bought the DVD for my son, now 13, who the total opposite of ""a fish in water"". When he swims, he looks like a handicapped child in the middle of a seizure -- no kidding.

He watched the video very intently and we are ready to try out the first few drills. The steps are broken down into very small actions all building towards the goal of gliding almost effortlessly through the water. Even if my son only masters PART of what the DVD teaches, he will be miles ahead of where he is now.

The videos are clear and to the point. The swimmers are not all perfect in their technique. This is actually a good thing because they are making common errors -- the same ones most people will make. The voice over describes the mistake and what the swimmer should do to correct it.

In high school, I was on the swim team. Watching the videos, *I* quickly learned a few things that would definitely improve my technique.

In all, I recommend the DVD to anyone who wants to learn to swim as well as experienced swimmers who want to improve their technique.",1296172800,6,1047,4.299492385786802
2561677,5,B000FDK78W,"I followed each lesson exactly and took my time to really master them, even if it took a week and several pool sessions, and no matter how silly or rudimentary it seemed, and all by myself at the gym's 3.5ft deep pool.  And the result after 1-2 months... amazing!  Within months I did my first 1 mile ocean swim, when I was dying to swim only 50 yards (1 pool lap).  I can really swim forever now with the proper technique of breathing, relaxation and efficiency taught in the video.  I wish my friends and family had the patience to do it too, because they unsafely struggle so much to swim just 25 yards.  End the mystery of swimming well.",1286409600,31,641,4.308333333333334

2561679,4,B000FDK78W,"Good entry for learning the TI technique. The underwater photography helps. Slow motion clips are required to allow the eye to dwell and the mind to absorb the image. ""Sinkers"" problems need to be pointedly addressed. There are lot of us heavy, dense legs that pull us backwards!!",1268870400,,280,4.854166666666667
2561680,5,B000FDK78W,"During my life, I had never good experience with swim. But, a year ago, I began to swim and I've been trying to do it well. When I saw the youtube videos and the TI proposal like minimal drag, use momentum efficiently, etc, I've been thinking that it could be right.

I bought the book and the dvd (freestyle), and I had a good surprise when I tried to swim as Terry teachs. No efforts and more speed.

It really works, but before you make the investment, you must see the youtube videos and visit the TI website.",1268179200,2,513,4.224489795918367
2561687,5,B000FDK78W,"This is not just for triathletes.  As someone who flailed wildly about in the water after a mere 20 feet, I was skeptical that I would make progress. I used both this video and the book.  This video helped me visualize better some of the drills in the book and worked nicely as a supplement to the book. Both are geared towards swimming more efficiently in the water by making yourself cut through the water though better use of your body position.  Using the book and video together I have become more comfortable in the water and can now cover considerably more distance--also stopped fighting the water.",1262044800,4,606,4.644859813084112
2561688,1,B000FDK78W,"Not very useful.

90% is demonstrated by an old man - not fit at all. I didn't see much sports beauty or strength.

2561689,5,B000FDK78W,I bought this guys book and this DVD and invested a lot of time doing exactly what he said to do.  Honestly the author strikes me as a little weird.  The reason I gave it five stars was because his lessons worked!  I went from struggling to total comfort in open water swimming. I am not real fast yet but I can swim all day in rough open water.,1257206400,2,345,3.971014492753623
2561690,5,B000FDK78W,"Awesome DVD (and pdf booklet on the DVD also) which gives great stepwise instruction to help you swim faster and further using less energy than before.

I was swimming about 20-21 strokes per length (25m) before this and hadn't really improved in my swim squad over the last 2-3 years. Within 2 weeks of practicing only the first 4 drills (of 12 or 14) on this DVD I'm now down to 16-17 strokes per length.

Just have to keep applying the techniques on here and I stay at that stroke rate and am less tired and going faster than before. If I regress to my old style my stroke rate per length increases and I'm less efficient.

This DVD is fantastic and helps you swim smarter rather than just bashing out more lengths trying to get faster by getting bigger muscles!!

Get if you want to improve!",1256601600,7,795,4.387755102040816
2561691,5,B000FDK78W,"This video is great, I've watched it over a thousand times and pick up something new each time.  I was not a swimmer and now I can swim.  However, I should have purchased another one for beginners because this does not discuss exhaling in water.  As another reviewer stated, the book is needed with the video....they go hand in hand.",1245110400,,333,4.516666666666667

2561693,4,B000FDK78W,"I read the book first and felt like I needed to see the drills demonstrated in action.  The video makes a good complement to the book.  I feel that you need both to benefit from the system.  I think that my swimming has become more effortless as a result of the system, and hope that my speed will pick up with practice.  I am recommending the Total Immersion system to my friends that are also beginning triathletes.",1222732800,,417,4.376623376623376
2561694,4,B000FDK78W,I bought the book and the DVD. It actualy works. I am doing the drills for about a month now (4 times per week - 40 minutes each time) and I can see the difference. I'm still struggling with combining strokes and kicks and with breathing while swimming but it seems that the more I practice the better it gets.,1220572800,3,310,4.183333333333334
2561695,4,B000FDK78W,"If you are a novice swimmer, this is really helpful. I was fighting the water while swimming, windmilling my arms, and kicking like crazy.

2561696,4,B000FDK78W,"First, yes, I echo what the other positive reviews have said. Music is cheesy, production is cheap-ish, examples are very clear and immediately useful, provides the clarity that the Total Immersion book doesn't.

But really, I should not have had to get 1/3 of the way through the book before finding that I needed a $40 DVD (or, alternatively, a $500 weekend seminar) to really make use of its techniques. C'mon guys, raise the price of the book by $5 or whatever and include the DVD with it!",1215648000,13,493,4.6022727272727275

2561698,5,B000FDK78W,"I was very pleased with the Freestyle DVD. I purchased a book by the same author titled Total Immersion Swimming: The Revolutionary Way to Swim Better, Faster, and Easier. I found the book contained a plethora of great information, however, I am very visual and when I bought the DVD it opened my eyes to all that the book was saying. I began swimming in February 2008. By performing the drills in the book and swimming 5 days a week I was able to swim 500 yards in 11 minutes and 30 seconds in a race on May 18 2008. Right after that race I purchased the Freestyle DVD and by the next race on June 8 2008 I decreased my 500 yd pace to 10 minutes 30 seconds. With practice I have since decreased my pace to 10 minutes and plan to continue to practice the total immersion method to swim an 8 minute 500 yd race by next May.

2561699,5,B000FDK78W,"I took 8 half-hour swim lessons at my local gym, which got me started with a rudimentary arm stroke and leg kick. I then bought the Freestyle Made Easy DVD and the book, and 3 months later managed a 1.5k triathlon swim - I was pretty slow! But a few months ago, I did another one and I did an average speed. This DVD is so clear and helpful and easy to follow. The filming of the drills is so good that it is not difficult to emulate it when you do your own practices. I watch it time after time, and regularly do the drills, and I now feel so relaxed in the water, I could swim forever. If it got me swimming without huffing, puffing and panting, it can help anyone

2561701,2,B000FDK78W,The DVD is like a novel where the plot is going along and then the author just seem to run out of pages without a satisfactory conclusion.  The DVD gives the student all the drills but never tells you how to put it together in a freestyle stroke.  Perhaps later editions will go the extra chapter.,1212192000,10,297,4.285714285714286

2561704,3,B000FDK78W,Terry Laughlin has come up with a swim technique which makes swimming extremely easy for all. The DVD shares the secrets of this technique and demonstrates them. It could be difficult to watch the video and transfer the technique to the pool without using the pictures and descriptions available in the book.

2. If you do have the book, you may find out that some drills in this DVD are different from those in the book. I don't know which is ""better"" or more recent --- I mainly stick to the book.

3. The DVD does clarify/reinforce the drills in the book. I read the book and watch the DVD before and after going to the pool.

Yes, you need someone to check your form, so I ordered the drill cards too - that way the ""coach"" can look at the drill card right there at the pool and check form. The DVD gives you the visual and verbal cues to aid in learning. I would watch 2-4 drills, go apply in the pool, then add on.",1185062400,3,321,3.878787878787879
2561709,5,B000FDK78W,"If you're just looking for tips on how to swim a little better, this DVD is not for you.  The method of swimming taught here is just way too different from the way most of us were taught as children to swim (if you could call it teaching) that they needed to start at the beginning.  If you are will to put in the time to learn how to swim for real, in a hydrodynamic and relaxed manner, then this DVD is definitely the way to go.

I always had good freestyle swimming ""looks"", as my mom called it, but I never went anywhere very fast and always felt as if I was drowning.  I got hooked on this after it was recommended to me from my brother-in-law as an aid to help me train for triathlons.  This method is very well known in triathlon circles as being a great way to get an efficient, good stroke.

They start you at the beginning, so you do have to be willing to spend the time learning.  But after completing the program (as someone who otherwise felt pretty good in the water (besides my freestyle) it only took a few months), I felt confident in my stroke, no longer felt like I was drowning (yes, they wait until the end to incorporate breathing, but if you don't understand why, you missed the point), and felt ready to take it to open water.

If you want to learn to go faster, this isn't for you.  If you want to start with the basics and learn a good, efficient freestyle stroke, buy this DVD!  You can learn to go faster later. :)",1184630400,22,1442,4.154676258992806

Also, having read the book, I thought the disk would expand on the material in the book. Instead, it only goes very quickly through the drills. Perhaps  this would be sufficient for an experienced swimmer, but for a novice, it is really lacking in content.",1182902400,20,370,4.492537313432836

Actually, I probably wouldn't recommend the DVD without the book.

There are two extremes of swimmers that would likely be interested in this swim method: complete beginners looking to start swimming and experienced swimmers looking to examine this method.  Like most, I was somewhere in the middle (after being told by a swim coach that I looked like I was being electrocuted in the water, I thought that this relaxed style of swimming would be a good remedy).

Beginners will instantly see the value; it starts at the very beginning with active floating.  Experienced swimmers will need to be prepared to start at the very beginning as well, as Terry Laughlin (correctly) sees a need to break down established patterns of movement in order to build new muscle memory.

My freestyle has become significantly more relaxed.  Of course, I still have a long way to go to becoming a proficient distance swimmer (practice, practice, practice), but this video has helped eliminate a lot of bad habits so that the practice is actually beneficial.

One criticism (aside from the somewhat cheesy production): proper flutter kick is nearly ignored.  Although it's not the primary source of propulsion for efficient swimmers (e.g., Terry only kicks once per stroke), it's still a significant supplement when wanting to swim fast.  It would have been nice to see it addressed more in the video.",1181433600,87,1724,5.7254901960784315

2561713,3,B000FDK78W,"I thought I was going to get a great, how-to DVD that would show me some new techniques and give me a better understanding of how to improve my freestyle. Based on the reviews I read prior to my purchase I figured this would be the right DVD for me. Boy was I wrong. The instruction is geared for the complete beginner and spends WAY TOO much time telling the swimmer that they should work on the techniques with a ""swim buddy.""  A lot of good that does when you swim alone and have no one you can swim with at all. The DVD also wastes too much time with the basics of the freestyle stroke. From its title, ""swim better, faster and easier"" I didn't get that at all from this DVD. It also stated that you would learn about the turns, and open water swimming. In reality, it shows about 8 minutes in total for those two segments. Don't waste your money on this DVD, look for another teaching video, or start asking people you know where they learned about swimming and if they can recommend anything.

I've gotten more out of other swimmers at the pool than I did out of this DVD.",1179100800,17,1078,4.228155339805825
2561714,4,B000FDK78W,"This DVD is a great watch, & very useful to get a visuale aspect on drills as explained in 'Triathlon Swimming Made Easy'. It has great underwater & above water footage, & a really cool shot of fully underwater freestyle. However, it would be less useful if used as a stand alone product.",1178928000,5,288,4.452830188679245
2561715,2,B000FDK78W,"...Too much money for too little product.  This  overpriced DVD comes in short (about 30 minutes) and cheap. (You're not going to believe the shoddy production values).  While it is useful to see good to great swimmers executing Mr. Laughlin's techniques, there is no info on correcting common problems for the rest of us.  C'mon Terry, you've been teaching for over 20 years.  What about a  ""5 most common mistakes"" section that could help the rest of us along?  Also, while it shows the recommended drills, there is surprisingly little on linking the drills to actual swimming.  Most of the demonstrations don't show the swimmers even breathing but rather holding their breath as they execute the drills.  (Yeah, I know, Sweet Spot - but that hardly shows how to link strokes, particularly for alternate side breathing).  Also, unless my DVD player has developed hiccups, the disc itself has got problems - There were a number of stutters and ""freezes"".",1176681600,91,955,4.949685534591195
2561716,4,B000FDK78W,"I bought the book Total Immersion by Terry Laughlin. This ""Freestyle: Made Easy"" video is helpful in bridging some of the gaps I have when reading the book especially when a video clip ""speaks a thousand words"".",1175385600,,211,4.72972972972973
8121116,5,B000FDK78W,"Bought the book first. Good book. Informative. Bought the DVD afterwards. Studied both  practicing the drills. Excellent progression from the most basic to swimming proficiently in a relaxed endurance based method. I recommend it to beginners and people looking to exercise in a relaxed, stress free method. I call it the yoga of swimming. I still want to take a series of lessons as I live 15 minutes from the studio in New Paltz  to correct and refine my technique. Highly recommended. People cry that the music and video are cheesy. Maybe Terry should have hired John William's for the musical score and Steven Speilberg to produce the video?",1525219200,,645,4.908256880733945

I was always somewhat afraid of the water and struggled through some weird dog paddle motion and was happy just to survive.

I'm still working my way through but relaxing more. Within the first week I swan 20 lengths on my back with no hands. If that was all I could ever do I would be happy I spent the money.",1420761600,,326,4.015384615384615
