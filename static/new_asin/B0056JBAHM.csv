4590042,5,B0056JBAHM,"How Mystery Science Theater 3000 missed skewering this movie is a mystery to me.  The Rifftrax trio of Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett do an outstanding job of tearing this movie apart, much the same way that the stop-motion dinosaurs tear their victims apart.  One pointless shot of the sun in the sky elicited this memorable comment.  ""Hi.  This is God.  Watch me mess with these chuckleheads!""  The only way anyone can sit through this movie of space shipwrecked survivors wandering around aimlessly, periodically stopping for rest periods, and occasionally getting killed, is by enjoying the riffs of the Rifftrax trio.",1266537600,20,635,5.116504854368932
4590043,5,B0056JBAHM,The gang is on fire here riffing and ripping a film that begs to be savaged.  Must've watched it 10 times in the month I've owned it and it kills me every time.  Definitely their best post-MST3K attack since Wild Women of Wongo.,1265932800,4,228,4.27906976744186
4590044,4,B0056JBAHM,I've been a huge fan of Rifftrax ever since I stumbled upon them back when they first came out.  I'm so glad they are releasing stuff on DVD now.  We just finished watching Planet of Dinosaurs last night and both my wife and I loved it.  There were several laugh-out-loud moments and the running commentary kept us entertained throughout.  Another strong entry in the Rifftrax collection.  I highly recommend this one.  I hope they keep them coming!,1265328000,4,449,4.766233766233766
4590055,2,B0056JBAHM,"The movie was terrible. I get the Mystery Science Theater shtick, but the movie was so unbeleivably bad that was painfull to watch. It was not even funny.",1486598400,,154,4.535714285714286
4590056,5,B0056JBAHM,"In this episode, Mike and the bots tackle the 1961 black-and-white Japanese ""classic"", INVASION OF THE NEPTUNE MEN.  A group of precocious young boys and their hero, Space Chief battle the forces of bullet-headed morons from Neptune, who are intent on conquering the Earth.  The movie starts out pretty well, but quickly devolves into a lot of running, walking, driving, flying and staring at screens.  Mike and crew valiantly held their own throughout this monstrosity with brilliant riffing, until the interminable aerial battle near the end, when they were reduced to tears.  It got so bad that at one point, Mike and Crow walked out of the theater and left poor Servo alone to fend for himself.

Host segments:  While Pearl, Bobo and Brain Guy are stuck in ancient Rome, Crow and Servo try to put on a Kabuki play, Servo comes down with Roji-panty complex (don't ask) and the crew has a surprise visit from Krankor of PRINCE OF SPACE.  These were some of my favorite segments.

Overall, the movie was horrible, the riffing was great and the streaming of this episode had no problems.  I definitely recommend this for a rental.",1485475200,2,1130,4.813471502590674

4590059,2,B0056JBAHM,"I'm a huge fan of any version of MST, but this one was simply not that funny. I hardly laughed at all, and the movie was worse than a turkey. It was more of a turkey's carcass. The boys have done much, much better. Probably just me, and it gets two stars for them making it through this boring, boring offering, and it's delightful to see/hear them on my TV again. But other than that, it's a pass for me. Will probably never watch it again; unusual for a good Rifftrax production.",1478390400,,481,4.239130434782608

4590062,5,B0056JBAHM,"I loved this movie as a child.  Planet of the Dinosaurs has great stop motion animation, and the dinosaurs look pretty good.  The rex always goes for the head when he attacks, just like other large predators, so someone did their homework.  The cast is another matter, but I was forgiving back then.  Watch them shoot dinosaurs with arrows and throw spears at them, because their laser gun apparently can't even cut through butter.  Watch the crew bicker like school children at recess.  Watch them make one boneheaded decision after another, like handing a deadly weapon to a panicky secretary.  And that's before the riffing.

As with the other RiffTrax movies, this one is both hilarious and surprisingly cheap.  The jokes had me laughing out loud plenty of times.  Watching this made me wish there was something this good on TV.",1456531200,2,832,4.836879432624113

4590065,4,B0056JBAHM,Nice entry into the Rifftrax group of films.  Planet of Dinosaurs is a supremely drecky 70's film that was just screaming for the Rifftrax / MST3K treatment.  Highly recommended.,1443312000,,178,5.103448275862069
4590066,3,B0056JBAHM,Not the best  from the Rifftrax guys but even if not the best it's better than no Rifftrax at all. It isn't the 'riffing' that's so bad as the acting in the movie. YEESH! This makes the cheesy bad acting in 70s porn look downright Shakespearean by comparison! This would be totally unwatchable if not for the guys verbally flaying it alive. I mean even the pathetic rubber dinosaurs did a better job.,1441238400,,400,4.47945205479452

4590068,5,B0056JBAHM,"Hamlet? You mean the standard issue 16th century revenge tragedy that Shakespeare transformed into a psychological drama about a man at war with his own consciousness, revising it into the foundational text of modern literature?

Yeah, you're gonna have to go elsewhere for that story. What we got here is a dismal 1961 attempt at Hamlet for German television, trimmed from 152 minutes to a little over half that length, and still managing to feel like an eternity. Ricardo Montalban and John Banner are among the uncredited, dubbed voices (Maximillian Schell dubs his own voice, in English); the action seems to have been filmed in a dimly-lit prison block, and the hair, costumes, and college-production acting are all fair targets for ridicule. The riffing is really quite good in this episode; it takes chutzpah to riff Shakespeare and get away with it, but Mike, Kevin, and Bill rise to the occasion.

(You say you want to watch a better version of Hamlet on film? Well, there's always Olivier's pop-Freudian version of 1948; Kurosawa's 1960 free translation of the story into a tale of Japanese corporate corruption; and Kenneth Branagh's four-and-a-half hour all-star version from 1996.)",1427673600,4,1194,5.1179487179487175
4590069,5,B0056JBAHM,"The boys of mst3k take us back to the 70's, along with stop motion photography!  Remember the hair, the moustaches and the bellbottoms.... it all comes together with a Harryhausen type of planet.  Who could ask for more?",1427155200,,220,4.7631578947368425
4590070,5,B0056JBAHM,"A lot of folks seem to have fond memories of 1978's ""Planet of Dinosaurs,"" but only the RiffTrax team could get me to sit through the story of a band of shipwrecked idiots wandering aimlessly through a nonexistent plot while waiting to be picked off by stop-motion dinosaurs.

The acting? Bad. The synthesizer music? Worse. The cast's appearance? Like a bunch of '70s porn film performers in the ugliest school band uniforms ever. The riffing? Brilliant from start to finish. In other words, it's comedy gold.",1423699200,,509,4.9186046511627906
4590071,4,B0056JBAHM,"Another great one by the RT crew. The movie is actually kind of typical of low budget 70's stuff, so it is not uniquely bad. That they kill off the hottest chick in a bikini and leave some muscle guy shirtless for the entire movie (despite his shirt being right there), only highlights the moments the RT guys can make fun of, oh, everything in it. Not quite on the level of say, Guy From Harlem or House on Haunted Hill, but still definitely worth adding to your collection.",1416787200,,475,4.348314606741573
4590072,5,B0056JBAHM,"This is one of  my favorite episodes. The riffing is strong, and the movie is actually watchable in a ""creepy-German-minimalist-try not to notice that all the good guys are blond and the bad guys look very...not blond"" kind of way",1414627200,,230,4.75

4590076,4,B0056JBAHM,"This is a dull German version of the great play.  Besides Max Schell, it features the voices of Ricardo Montalban and John (Sgt. Shultz) Banner.

You've got to give Mike and the writers a lot of credit for riffing the To Be or Not To Be soliloquy, and doing it well.  And for playing a quiz show game in which answers must be stated in ""Alas, poor"" form.",1400630400,,354,4.176470588235294
4590077,3,B0056JBAHM,"The setup is that, after who knows how many terrible movies, the station crew finally get to pick one, and Mike reasonably chooses Hamlet. The trick is that the eeeeevil Pearl gives them the worst Hamlet ever.

The problem? It isn't THAT terrible. Mike's rationale was that he wanted the greatest tragedy ever. Even a bad version of that is likely to be watchable, and this version has Maximillian Schell as the lead character. He's too good to get the full-on MST3K assault, but the show is too bad to be enjoyable as a version of Hamlet. The result is an hour and a half where you, as the audience, think ""This version of Hamlet could have been better, and this episode of MST3K could have been funnier.""",1400025600,,706,4.515625

4590079,5,B0056JBAHM,"This version of Hamlet is quiet bizarre.  Whether it is the acting, direction or both that leads to an unusual quality or interpretation, I'm not sure it really matters.

Regardless, the Crew is on hand to lend their loveable antics to help brighten up and add cheer to a bizarre film.

4590081,5,B0056JBAHM,"Amazingly enough, the actual movie isn't at all bad! Hamlet is played by a VERY young Maximilian Schell, who was quite a hottie back in the day! Of course the MST3K commentary is hilarious, but I found myself watching it for the movie as well as the snarkery.

4590083,4,B0056JBAHM,"Another awful movie made watchable by the comedy riffs from the gang at Rifftrax.  Essentially, as is alluded to on the back cover of the DVD,  I can sum this one up quickly:

A bunch of geeks, obviously out of the 1970s and looking a lot like the Starland Vocal Band, land on a planet populated by dinosaurs that remarkably look just like the T-Rexes and Stegasauruses that used to roam the Earth before ""the big meteor""  struck and wiped them out.  Many of the said geeks get eaten by the said dinosaurs.  The remaining survivors live out the remainder of their lives on the planet, since their rocket ship was destroyed when they crash landed at the beginning of the movie.

4590095,5,B0056JBAHM,"I thought the movie was actually pretty good. If this was shown (The Hamlet portion only) in high school, I would have looked into more Shakespere.  Of course having a 'running' commentary only adds to the delight of the viewing pleasure. Ooops - did I like the movie? Hmmmm. Maybe I should watch it again sober and see if it's just as good a second time. LOL.",1369180800,2,360,4.373134328358209
4590096,5,B0056JBAHM,"If you were a fan from the very beginning, and kept up through all the changes, this is the payoff episode.  I watched several episodes from various times during the series looking for the Funniest Episode Ever, and I keep coming back to this one.
Important facts: This is from the Sci-Fi (it was still called that) era, so there's no Joel, no Trace, no Frank, no Josh.  So pretty much, completely new cast.  Kevin is still playing Tom Servo (Htom Sirveaux) and Bill Corbett plays Crow.  The ""plot"" bits feature MaryJo Pehl as Pearl and the guys playing sidekicks Bobo and Brainguy.  But the plot is not important, and never has been of course!

The movie itself, taken on it's own, is probably one of the funniest unintentionally funny-bad movies they have ever touched.  It's the classic Shakespeare drama, in dubbed English, and the whole thing takes place in what appears to be a large concrete bomb shelter.  According to the credits, Maximillian Schell plays Hamlet.  Also, it sounds like the dubbed voice of Claudius is Ricardo Montalban.  I can't fathom why someone thought to dub a German TV production of Hamlet, but I also can't fathom a lot of Johnny Depp movies, so there you go. Remember the HBO production of ""King Lear""?  This is like that, but horrifying.

Now to the riffing.  I'm not going to spoil any gags for you by telling them here, but just a little description so you know what to expect.  They riff on the appearance/costumes of the characters, the delivery of the lines, and of course, the actual dialogue.  I think that's my favorite part, the fact that they are riffing Shakespeare.  And it's perfect and hilarious.  Phrases that you thought ""Well that's odd"" when you first read or heard it, they take it and run with it.  And that is all I will say about it!

Ask yourself these questions: Do I like MST3k?  Do I like Hamlet?
If the answer to either of those is ""Yes"", there's a good chance you will love this episode.",1368662400,8,1950,4.58092485549133

Basically it involves the group wandering around after crashing for what seems like forever and then they finally run into a dinosaur after so long that they need to find a way to battle back and save themselves from the terror.

Yes the plot is terrible, the acting is incredibly bad, the movie as a whole is just cheap and mind-numbingly dull. The commentary of Mike, Kevin and Bill is very funny, from the opening credits they just rip the movie to shreds and leave nothing unscathed. Its easily one of the funniest Rifftrax they've ever done, I was laughing nonstop at them and just groaning at how bad the movie was.

I had owned a copy of Planet of Dinosaurs on VHS and loved the movie for its utter and complete dreadfulness. When I saw that some of the MST3K crew (Rifftrax) had done a commentary on it I couldn't resist buying it and , I assure you, it was worth every penny. The laughs were common and the riffs were sharp. The movie was wonderfully entertaining and incredibly quotable, making references to everything from Old Gregg to Halo, this movie was an adventure through the layers of humor from mild chuckle to gut splitting laughter. Even the menu of this movie made me chuckle; as Mike and the gang sang about the events of the movie as they saw them.

I've watched quite a few Rifftrax DVDs and, on the whole, I'm rather entertained by them.  They're always funny, Mike and Co. always do a good job, but its just not quite the same as MST3k.  I don't know what it is exactly, but they always fall just the littlest, tiniest bit short of being as great as MST3k was.

I figured at some point I'd get the DVD that finally brings it up a notch, and this one is it.  ""Planet Of Dinosaurs"" is incredible, and ranks right up there with my favorite MST3k episodes.

The movie is about a marooned spaceship crew that wanders around, fights, complains, wanders around some more, has several rest periods, and occasionally comes up against some dinosaurs.  Its prime MST3k material, and Mike, Kevin and Bill just knock it out of the park.  It really does measure up with the best of the Sci-Fi years.  Rapid fire, super funny, its the best RiffTrax I've seen to date.

Aside from a decent job on stop-motion animation, this film is laughable from beginning to end.

If I had one complaint, it was that they were only focusing on more up to date movies like Star Wars and major blockbusters such as Transformers and Iron Man. This DVD did exactly what I had hoped they would do: Attack the movies that made them famous, the low budget sci-fi films of late.

Watching this brought back the same feelings that watching MST3K did back in the day. Don't get me wrong, all RiffTrax are funny. Just this style of movie is the kind that truly have it coming and its an easy target.

Well, not too strange, but it is full of dinosaurs, big spiders, and other nasty beasts.  The crew, sadly enough, is not prepared for survival on such a planet and slowly, one by one, the pretty girls are killed, plus a few of the guys, leaving behind only the strongest, the not-so-smartest, and the reasonably good looking.  There is a lot of walking, climbing and building things and lots of debates about management styles.  It can have funny points but much of the time it seems painful and slow.  The dinosaur effects are not that bad which makes the weak writing, bad acting, and the fact that they pass the same rock cliff many times look even worse.
Even with Mike, Kevin and Bill helping me as my guides I could only wonder how it ever got onto the big screen.",1275782400,2,869,4.474683544303797
4590124,5,B0056JBAHM,"""Halt, who plods there?""  Oh I know, a bunch of hairy people from late 70s public television... all to the wonderful sounds of painfully awful synthesizer music.  If you like watching people walk around while not really doing anything, then it's the greatest movie you've ever seen.  On the other hand, it's much more fun hearing the gang give it their all they've got.  I was very impressed with the job they did this time on the commentary because there is A LOT of downtime in the movie for them to cover and they pull it off wonderfully, even slipping in a callback or two to MST3K episodes.  Basically, it's another quality Rifftrax episode that's worth every penny if you like the commentaries they produce.",1267315200,14,713,4.672

8459715,5,B0056JBAHM,these guys have always been funny -  and this recent offering lives up to their reputation!  If you've ever seen them and liked them on TV from a few years ago -- they are back!  It's almost worth subscribing to Netflix for (I think they have a regular series on Netflix now) !  But I found this episode on Amazon's film offerings  -- we laughed so much -- the quips are relentlessly funny and spot on!  Much needed relief from the troubles in today's headlines.,1505520000,,462,4.376470588235295

8459719,5,B0056JBAHM,"This review is of the 1961 Japanese film, INVASION OF THE NEPTUNE MEN.  I realize this and other reviews wound up at the listing for the MST3K HAMLET, too, but I can't do anything about it.  At any rate, NEPTUNE MEN riffed at MST3K is highly enjoyable.  As one observer said, it's the kind of cheap Japanese sci-fi that gives other cheap Japanese sci-fi a bad name.  Given the stingy production values, it's a great movie for things-that-look-like-other-things, and our crew makes heavenly hash out of it.

For example:
FILM:  Pointed-nose rocket lands.
MST3K:  ""Looks like a pre-fab Lutheran church.""

FILM:  Help arrives via airplane.
MST3K:  ""Bob Hope arrives to entertain the troops.""

FILM:  Neptune invasion is aborted.
MST3K:  ""Bay of Pigs""

FILM:  Electrical wave on oscilloscope.
MST3K:  ""Rip Taylor's voice pattern""

and so on!  Very enjoyable.  Maybe Amazon can straighten out these erroneous duplicate postings, so I can review HAMLET too?
