2626837,4,B000H5U5EO,"Infamy is a good documentary style graff film that takes the time to really explain what graffiti writers are about.  This is not just a 'piece' reel to showcase styles from different areas (Graffiti Verite'), nor is it a fictional movie with a plot (aka Bomb the System).  Infamy details the motivations and ambitions of some well-known writers form around the country.  All the writers interviewed are very articulate and express their thoughts and emotions clearly and are to the point, particularly Earsnot, NM, Saber, and DAZE.  I found the bonus footage even more interesting than the film itself.  Bonus material touches on topics ranging from the relationship of hip-hop and graff, the perception that graff writers are unsuccessful unemployed losers, and the commercialization of the graffiti subculture as it explodes into the mainstream.

  Regardless of your take on graffiti and the people who produce it, watch this DVD and you'll gain insight on why they do it and what pushes them to continue.  I found Anti-Graffti Nazi Joe Connely's point of view pretty valuable too.  By the end of the film, we learn that he's actually  doing the thing that he despises most.

2626838,5,B000H5U5EO,"By the maker of 'Scratch' I believe, Infamy sheds light on an art form that is ever present in most of our lives [living in city, or passing train tracks], and does an great job at showing more than one side of it.  Multiple artists are interviewed from different cities and different styles, not to mention a graffiti removal nut in a LA suburb.  Powerful.",1198108800,,357,4.476923076923077
2626839,4,B000H5U5EO,"Infamy is about artists going for fame. Pure and uncut through the decades

it's all there. All the phat beats and mad stlyes are there but in the end thats it. The movie displays illegal crime activity and what happens next. Some flashbacks in the movie are pretty macabre. This is really though hardcore bombing in different cities. This is the essence of graffiti and it's a cry for props in a world of none.",1165536000,,411,4.48
2626840,5,B000H5U5EO,"For all graf heads (especially) and even those that turn their nose at graffiti but have any appreciation for art/street culture and self expression, you need to check this film out. It's fantastic! Doug Pray (director and maker of SCRATCH) made this film because even though he was never a fan of graffiti, and even had a distaste for a lot if, he was curious to find out what it was all about. And he did...and the point of view from which he shot this film is exactly why it's so good! It's not a typical documentary  where you'd expect the filmmaker to simply glamorize or demean graffiti, just give you the history of the art form, or tryto convince you that graffiti is this way or that way...it's a raw look into the lives of 7 people who lives revolve around the art form (with MANY artist and icon cameos throughout), and it gives you tremendous insight into what it really means to live and breath whatever it is your true passion may be. In this film , it happens to be graffiti. So, check it out! I doubt you'll be disappointed. And don't expect another SCRATCH...this film is a totally different kind of film.",1160697600,4,1122,4.446601941747573

2626855,3,B000H5U5EO,"I like he used a couple smaller names but how do you make a graf movie without even mentioning ATL?(showing a Sever piece in the intro doesnt count)

Saber, obviously legit
Toomer, see above
earsnot, good
Philly writer, goes too far to be diff. feels like they doin anything to get out of NY shadow.
claw, cute.",1327795200,,311,4.456140350877193
2626856,4,B000H5U5EO,"I have recently become impressed with Doug Pray's documentary work.  Infamy is about the graffiti sub-culture.  He follows 5 or 6 of the more prolific taggers to see how they work and listen to their thoughts.  It really gave me insight into why these guys (and girls) have a passion for their particular brand of art.  He also includes one ""buffer"", which is a guy who eliminates graffiti in his neighborhood.  The buffer was pretty funny because his last scene essentially shows that he is really a form of tagger!

There is some good footage of the artists actually creating their work with markers or spray paint.  It really drew a striking parallel with calligraphy.  Their motions are often so practiced and smooth that the movements seem to be as much art as the final result.  Of course there are also shots of many beautiful works in the film.  If you have any interest in the graffiti scene, check out this film.",1267574400,4,922,4.635802469135802
2626857,5,B000H5U5EO,"This dvd shows some of the biggest names in graffiti art. The dvd gets the opinion of each graffiti artist and a guy who tries to get rid of tagging in his city. This is a good dvd I just didn't like the atittude of most of the graffiti artists because they make it seem like in order to make it big you have to go through them first and that you must go through tough times to be respected. These aren't the BEST graff. artist they are just well known or over rated. Entertaining film but don't assume that graffiti is what they say it is, they have their own opinions. These graff artists act like they know everything and it gets annoying but what makes this a good film is the images you see and their passion for it.",1258243200,,721,4.120567375886525

I am so amazed by the superior filmmaking styles and techniques.  I wouldn't be surprised if this film won an academy award some day.  I wish that they would start making more classic films like the golden era of 1920s era prohibition.  That would be a really exciting time and a great way to stimulate the economy through gambling and fun times.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-Yukmouth/dp/B00175D7MU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of Yukmouth</a>",1247443200,,884,9.488095238095237
2626859,4,B000H5U5EO,"Like most of Doug Pray's films (Scratch, Surfwise, Big Rig), he takes a subculture that has strong negative connotations and puts a human face to it. Like most people, I have had mixed feeling about graffiti. I've seen some amazing murals by graf artists, but the signature scrawls you see everywhere tend to piss me off. But after I saw this film, at least now I look at it in a different way. Great stuff. I will never look at graffiti the same way again.",1240185600,2,457,4.3882352941176475
2626860,3,B000H5U5EO,this movie is more on individual bombers.its alright lacks in its tags bombs murials but hey.it was good but if you are a bomber then this movie will sorta leave you with an unsettling depression by the end. as if all your work and life deicaded to this art just leads nowhere.i cant fully say that .style wars i would recommend over this you learn the origin of graffiti.,1240099200,,372,4.405797101449275
2626861,5,B000H5U5EO,"I have to say I am not that into graffiti but this is a great DVD. It goes on to show you the life of the artists and why they do what they do. Some may say that graffiti is horrid looking and some yes it is but when they put up a whole wall of great art it is amazing.

This DVD goes and shows you some of the biggest names in graffiti and where they come from. There are quite a bit more out there but this one is my favorites a must buy.",1235433600,,440,3.5833333333333335

8136409,1,B000H5U5EO,"This is crap, absolutely garbage.  It is a film about graffiti and it has DRM protection.  I wanted to encode the video so that I can watch it on my plex media server, but out of the box handbrake doesn't work and neither does imgburn.  Both are complaining about protections on the disc.  I'd return this film if it wouldn't cost me more to ship it back to amazon than I already paid.

Buzz off with your crap DRM.  It is giving legitimate product holders more trouble than it is worth.  Do you honestly think you lost money off this film about graffiti to piracy?",1408406400,,565,4.3238095238095235

Definitely a must-see film for anyone interested, involved in, dedicated to, or against the art. Will really change your opinions on graffiti just being a whole lot of destructive trash.
