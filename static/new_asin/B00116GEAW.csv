3061348,4,B00116GEAW,"Este DVD, definitivamente trae excelentes recuerdos del segundo concierto en la Ciudad de Mxico. Yo pude estar ah, y despus de haberlos visto hace 11 aos en el Palacio de los Deportes, verlos ahora en el Foro fue increble.

El DVD 1, trae en su mayora la edicin del segundo concierto en el DF, con algunas ediciones especiales insertando canciones tocadas el 4 de octubre en el mismo foro  (La presentacin de los integrantes antes del set semi-acustico, No ms Lgrimas, Oracin, La Chispa Adecuada, Tesoro, En Brazos de la Fiebre). Me hubiera encantado que fuera corrido el concierto, pero bueno, seguro por tiempo y perfeccionismo hicieron unos cuantos recortes por ah, incluyendo la insercin de aquello del primer concierto en el DF, como haba dicho. Es obvio ya que dura como hora cincuenta el DVD, y recuerdo que dur ms de dos horas desde que salieron al escenario.

El DVD 2, est muy bueno el documental que viene, te hace sentir lo que la gira hizo para HDS y a todos nosotros que compartimos alguna de esas noches. Y una seleccin interesante de canciones que no fueron comn en todos los conciertos.

Si eres fan de HDS (y aunque no lo seas), no puede faltar este DVD en casa. El sonido en general es excelente. El audio para 3 canales me encant como se escucha perfectamente al pblico cantando las canciones al mismo tiempo, no todos los conciertos editados en DVD tiene este sonido.

Lo nico con lo que me qued hambre de, es no haber escuchado en vivo Flor de Loto!!! :(

Lstima que hay faltantes del cocierto (Agosto, Flor Venenosa, Tumbas de Sal y, Malas Intenciones), pero revives el momento y eso es lo importante.

HDS definitivamente, LA MEJOR BANDA DE ROCK N' ROLL EN ESPAOL DE TODOS LOS TIEMPOS.",1200182400,,1709,4.62046204620462
3061349,5,B00116GEAW,"Tuve la oportunidad de estar en dos conciertos de la Gira de Heroes del Silencio (Los Angeles 28 de Septiembre y Mexico D.F. 6 de Octubre 2007). Fueron dos conciertos fascinantes, de aproximadamente dos horas y media cada uno, que recorrieron toda la discografia de Heroes. Me impactaron algunas canciones como El Estanque, Fuente Esperanza, Agosto, Tumbas de Sal, y Con nombre de guerra. Una cancion que falto en Mexico D.F. y que si estuvo en Los Angeles fue Bendecida, una cancion de bellisima factura y que solo los verdaderos fanaticos de Heroes del Silencio conocemos y la disfrutamos. Afortunadamente esta cancion esta en el segundo DVD, que incluye ademas canciones en diferentes ciudades de la gira, y un documental hecho en los aviones entre ciudad y ciudad.

I was able to attend two concerts Guatemala, and Los Angeles but canceled at the last minute the one in Zaragoza.  This is a real treasure although the footage from other countries was too short, they should have included at least 3 songs per country.  Although the one in Mexico city is great!

I recommend this DVD, yes it could have been better specially because of the magnitude of the concerts and the history but just experiencing the show live was rewarding enough!

3061380,3,B00116GEAW,"The other reviewer Raul said it perfectly. This DVD set is a figurative slap in the face for such a high-caliber, historic concert tour. I had the chance to see them in their stop in Los Angeles, and was blown away by the show, so I've been anxiously counting the days til' its release.

Finally getting my hands on it, I excitedly pop in the disc into my High Definition TV and DVD system, only to have my jaw drop as I stare at the grainy film quality and weird aspect ratio of the concert on my screen.

What was EMI thinking? Is this the kind of sad record they wanted fans to keep of these amazing shows? This should have been treated at the very least with a proper aspect ratio and sharp video production, if not full HD.

The only thing saving this? The amazing music of course. But if all I was getting was good audio I would have bought the CDs.

Heed the warning. Go for those instead.",1203033600,7,896,4.191860465116279
3061381,2,B00116GEAW,"Before I start being attacked by fans of the band let me just clarify a couple things: I am a big fan of Heroes del Silencio and Enrique Bunbury, I believe the tour from last year is one of the best concerts I've seen in my life... my problem with this DVD set is not the band or the concert themselves but the awful treatment EMI gave to this release.

First of all as many fans know, the tour in Spain was released in three different presentations, a double CD, a double DVD and a boxed set containing both plus extra goodies (the type of goodies fans crave for) In America we only had the first two releases and no boxed set, since they released the 2 CD set last December and the double DVD on January all fans should have them by now, making the release of the boxed set less likely. Their loss as we all were hoping for the more-expensive-box-set to go and buy it. Another thing to note is the abusive price of the double DVD, Amazon is selling it for less than 20 bucks while in Mexico and Mexican online stores (where I purchased it) the average price is $30...

So I ended up paying $30 for what I thought would be an incredible DVD experience, being this one of the major releases EMI had  recently I expected a good treatment  for the tour from last year. Wrong again. While the concert was definitely one of the best I've ever attended to, this DVD release does no justice at all but ruins the experience of going over it one more time. First thing I noted when playing my DVD for the first time is that the concert has the widescreen black bars at the top and the bottom, but the widescreen is not anamorphic! What does that mean? That if you own a widescreen TV set you will not see only the 2 black bars I mentioned but 4 on the top, bottom, right and left sides of your screen. For you to watch this in full widescreen you'll need to utilize the `zoom' feature of your TV set which will distort the quality of the image. I started watching the concert thinking to myself this was not the first DVD I had to use the zoom feature in, and it all went well until I started to notice the bad editing (usual in all Bunbury DVD releases) in many of the songs, the details were so many that if had to mention them the list would be long, some examples may be in `Opio' there is a moment during the song that a still of the flower appears on screen for a good deal of time, an image that has nothing to do with the rest of the concert and its edit that seems to be placed there to hide something in the recording they did not want to show. That may still be bearable but the major problems can be noted in (and just to mention 2 examples) `Nuestros nombres' and `La chispa adecuada', it can be very annoying to see Bunbury singing the songs and his lips not matching what you're listening... there is no lip-sync at all! And no, I am not being picky, it is that obvious that it is annoying! The credits list three editors were in charge of the concert and no one catched this? No one had a screening prior to the release to note these editing errors?

Annoying as it is I watched the complete concert, I had the opportunity to see their live performance in Monterrey and it was great to watch the show and remember the concert I attended.  Recorded in Mexico city, the band plays better than ever (even without Bugoslavsky) and Enrique is at his best moment as an artist; you can see how all of them enjoy being on stage playing their songs, Enrique as usual playing with the masses. In this concert you will see why he is so fond of Mexico being one place he's been always welcome and admired.

The set list goes over all their discography and includes their major hits as well as some b-sides (like for instance `Bendecida' and  `Tesoro') Some classic songs were left out in disc one but included separately as bonus tracks on disc 2. The 5.1 sound mix is just incredible.

The extras

The first surprise I got from disc 2 is that when I played it, the menu appears in full widescreen! I thought I was wrong so I played the extra songs and the documentary and everything in disc 2 is in anamorphic widescreen! So, what kind of quality control does EMI have? The full concert is released in 4:3 but the extras deserve an anamorphic widescreen treatment? That is just absurd! Believe me, the quality of the image is way better in disc 2, using the `zoom' feature on a widescreen TV set does make a difference.

The documentary included may be interesting for some and boring for others, it does not offer any interesting facts at all; it is not a making of but a documentary of the video crew following the band on tour, their trips, their backstage moments and the like, it has its moments but is definitely not a big deal, the real jewels of disc 2 are the bonus tracks included.

While disc one recollects the concerts from Mexico DF, disc two includes one song from each of the other shows; so the version of `Agosto' you'll see here was recorded in Guatemala, `Flor Venenosa' in Monterrey, `Despertar' in Valencia, `Bendecida' in LA, `Tumbas de sal' in Sevilla, the incredible `Malas intenciones' in Zaragoza and `Fuente de esperanza' in Buenos Aires.

They treated this in a very interesting way, rather than showing the band playing on stage during the whole song they added stills and scenes from the cities in question, so while the song plays you may see the band as well as people from the audience or places of the city they are in. Seven extra songs and a documentary, I think these could have been added to disc one and were placed separately to justify a higher price for a 2 DVD set.

Bottom-line, for me, as a big fan of the band this was not what I expected and I believe this release deserved a better treatment, all these details may be considered as `minor' by some people but put them all together and the result is just an overpriced low quality product. I just hope someone bring these problems to their attention and they learn their lesson for future releases.

Great band, great tour, great concerts... overpriced low-quality release...",1200787200,21,6070,4.354553492484527
