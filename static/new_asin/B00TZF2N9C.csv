7026422,5,B00TZF2N9C,"The well written, nicely animated, colorful and action packed stories of Challenge of the Gobots conclude in this Hanna Barbera Classic Collection of Series Volume 2, which include the final 30 episodes over 3 DVD-R discs, with each disc clocking in at over 3 to 3.5 hours or so (total runtime is 662 minutes or 11 hours), with beautiful picture quality and transfer considering how long each disc is in length.
In Volume 2, Leader 1, Turbo and Scooter continue to battle with the help of a few scientist humans, and other fellow gobots from Gobotron against the evil forces of Cy-Kill, Coptur and Crasher and their troop of villains trying to conquer the Galaxy as new Go Bots are introduced to ramp up the excitement. Plenty of unique stories to keep the series fresh, thanks to a great assembly of writers and story tellers.
If you're looking for plenty of laser battles, transformations and action coupled with great story telling in each 1/2 hour episode, Challenge of the Gobots Volume 2 delivers as well as the first Volume has. Fans of animated Saturday Morning cartoons and weekly shows should consider adding this exceptional series to their Transformers and cartoon collections, as it features the voices of Frank Welker, Peter Cullen, The Wards, and the brilliant voice acting of Bernard Erhard as Cy-Kill.

7026423,5,B00TZF2N9C,"I received mine last week.  It is just like the first volume.  Every episode is beautifully remastered.  10 episodes on each of the 3 discs with one special surprise on Disc 3.  This volume completes the series.  The only problem I had was the way the discs were in the cover.  Disc 3 is off to the bottom and under Disc 2.  So to get Disc 3 out you have to first take out Disc 2.  I'm not of fan of this packaging.  I just got a new jewel case and switched them.  One great surprise was that they put the one shot cartoon of the toy line called Robo Force: The Revenge of Nazgar on Disc 3.  Those who remember the Robo Force toys will have fun watching that episode.  Not much else to say about this.  (THE GOBOTS, THE GOBOTS) Singing!!!!

7026439,5,B00TZF2N9C,I have grown up to the Gobots since I was a child.  It is refreshing to see it come to DVD at long last.
