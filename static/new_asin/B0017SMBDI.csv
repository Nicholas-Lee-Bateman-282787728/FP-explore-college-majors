8267077,5,B0017SMBDI,"This IMAX movie is a good documentary movie to watch, especially if you like bears!  It primarily covers black, brown, and polar bears, but mentions the plight of some other bears.

I first saw this movie in IMAX format at Science North science centre in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada in 2001.  It was good then, but even better on disc, as there are bonus documentaries on the disc.

This package has both HD Blu-Ray and DVD discs.  For around $8, this was not much more than the cost to see it in IMAX format for 1 person.",1325894400,,519,4.364583333333333
8267078,3,B0017SMBDI,"Of the eight different species, this film mainly focuses on the three species of bears in the region of North America, namely the polar bear, the grizzly, and the small omnivorous black bear.  Whether captive or in the wild, the fascination we have for these animals only increases with this type of footage, some of which may be a little dangerous, because it desensitizes the danger to humans.  Otherwise, it was enjoyable and left me wanting a little more.",1235520000,3,459,4.7974683544303796
8267079,1,B0017SMBDI,"This movie is dangerous.  Living in bear country I will admit to being comfortable with the idea of bears being around.  I've had them walk through my campsites (not rummage) and have only had one stand off which ended well.  That being said this movie portrays bears somewhat inappropriately.  This is the kind of movie that will send another Tim Treadwell to the woods to eventually be killed.  The movie even focuses on a woman who takes people bear viewing as a hobby and professions.  What this woman is doing is creating a level of habituation so that the bears are losing their natural fear of humans, which will almost always lead to a bear getting into trouble with humans.  This film seeks to create a positive image of bears all the while promoting inappropriate interaction with bears that causes bears to be killed.  Also the film uses the folly of Indian mythology surrounding bears, which are pretty ridiculous in the modern context of having a rational debate surrounding bears being in our lives.  Such as, Indians believing that bears can transform from sky to earth at their own will.  My guess is that the film makers want to put an image of magic around bears which detracts from the truth that bears are very single minded predators much of the time.  I support bear recovery efforts but please lets keep the discussion in the real world.",1230940800,6,1360,4.69620253164557

8267081,5,B0017SMBDI,"I like this videos.
Though it is kind of short as IMAX series used to be ( in my memory )
40 mins is long enough to draw all your attention in the movie, not too long, not too short, and most important of all, it's a film that you know they've spent time and energy to make it perfect.
I like it the way it's 40 mins so that you won't feel tired like watching a movie for 2 hours and you will feel you want to see more at the end of the movie.
Final note: It's 1999 IMAX film to be ""Re-masterd from HI-DEF""",1222387200,2,506,3.7383177570093458
