8601945,4,B003IP2YF8,"Beautiful music, well sung, well staged.  But I am still looking for the version that was played one New Year's Eve in the early 1980's on Public Television.  It was the Summa Cum Laude of Fledermaus's, and I ached for several days from laughing.  The role of the Russian Prince was sung by a giant Baritone instead of the usual woman en travestie, and his lugubrious facial expressions alone brought on fits of laughter.",1511827200,,421,4.662162162162162

8601948,5,B003IP2YF8,No one can mess up Die Fledermaus really.  This is a fun and funny production. A good balance between urbanity and slap stick comedy.  I don't need to go into the music part--it is J Strauss at his best.,1364860800,5,203,4.17948717948718
8601949,5,B003IP2YF8,"This a great Fledermaus?
Here's why:

The Vienna State Opera produces a ""near perfect"" production including:

Edita Gruberova's Adele--her singing and acting are incomparable here--she's totally ""on"" and constantly involved in the action--the consummate chambermaid-turned-belle of the ball.

Walter Berry, is a cute, lovable, frolicking Dr. Falke.

Helmut Lohner is the epitome of the jailer--a laid-back civil servant who is sincerely shocked that anyone would expect him to work. He adds some impressive footwork that will make him live on in your memory as the perfect Frosch.

Yes, of course the music was excellent, led by Theodor Guschlbauer, but I've saved the best for last:

A young Bernd Weikl dazzles with his singing, acting, and athleticism. During the waltzes, when he isn't carrying two ladies on his shoulders, he's doing a sort of walrus-trot that adds to the ""devil-may-care"" hilarious atmosphere of this wonderful party. This is a delightful Viennese party you'll watch again and again. Enjoy it with friends!",1289865600,14,1029,5.4
8601950,5,B003IP2YF8,"What a wonderful operetta production with the Vienna State Opera!  Lucia Popp shines, not unexpectedly, as Rosalinde.  Her Csardas is fantastically done with great style and feeling.  I was particularly taken with Bridgette Fassbaender as Prince Orlofsky.  Rarely have I seen a pants role performance without constantly being aware of the awkwardness that comes from a woman playing a man's role, but Fassbaender is fantastic!  The sets and costumes are exquisite, and the cast is highly energetic.  Although larger-than-life stage acting sometimes looks silly on screen, where we're used to more subtle movements, it is refreshing to see such an ensemble cast of actors.  You won't find any ""stand and deliver"" performances here!  The stage direction by Otto Schrenk and the choreography by Gerlinde Dill are equally interesting and exciting.  Most importantly, the singing is all top notch.  A professional production in every way!",1282003200,20,933,5.416666666666667
