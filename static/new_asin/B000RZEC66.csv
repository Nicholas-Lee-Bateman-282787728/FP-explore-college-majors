Lovely scenery considering it's no island or exotic location. I only skimmed this, but was pure pilates with Theresa telling you the names of the moves, minor movement direction & when to breathe by voice over. Often, the title of a passage from the Bible will show on the screen & she will hurriedly tell you that passage so she is finished as fast as possible. I'm open to religions though I don't follow any formal religion as I like a more spiritual path that can be followed by an denomination. That said, this one is not that type & did not seem relaxing or give a mind/body connection, rather a lecture while you exercise. I cannot tell you if this was a challenging or easy workout, but it is only 25 minutes.
