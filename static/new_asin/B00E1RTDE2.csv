While the whole video is exciting, some of the younger artists are exceptionally exciting too.  I have been buying Amy Grant (her secular music) before this because of her musicality.  She does sincere, beautiful music with her guitar and small band.  Kristyn Getty (in Volume One) and her band mates were so worth the trip from Ireland for Homecoming.  They did a performance that has influenced my life.  I understand Natalie Grant sometimes provides worship for some large gatherings of Joyce Meyer Ministries. Her performance makes me want to see her for real at one of these events when she is chosen to lead again.  These younger artists, and the many other exceptional artists that sing in solo roles and that sing in chorus together really knock the musical ball out of park, in both Volumes of Women o f Homecoming (2013).
The enthusiasm of these performers, probably Angela Primm in ""Days of Elijah"" in Volume Two is one of the best examples, and even the enthusiasm that is visible in the candid faces of the women in the crowd, show people being moved by music (and by message).  These images say a lot, that for the right person, experiencing this music being performed like this can be a profound kind of experience and very entertaining as well.
But if you are not a Christian, but you like good female voices, and you like beautiful vocal music backed-up by a good small band, there is still a lot in these DVD's to find in this work that is very satisfactory.",1382313600,,1819,5.592727272727273
5886481,3,B00E1RTDE2,"I was disappointed in this DVD as well as the Vol 1. I would have liked more songs from the older ones, even in duets, and groups than so much time spent on stories, and with new kids on the block and ones who have not appeared on DVDs before. I was just disappointed overall. Some of it was good and I enjoyed seeing all of the ""girls"" together again.",1382227200,4,352,4.042857142857143
5886482,5,B00E1RTDE2,"This is Vol Two of the Gaither women DVD, and is just as special as Vol One.

5886493,5,B00E1RTDE2,Enjoyed Vol. One so much I went ahead and bought Vol. Two. One thing that adds so much for me is the personal stories and sharing of struggles they have been through.
