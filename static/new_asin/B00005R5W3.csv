7951803,5,B00005R5W3,"45 minute workout including warmup and cooldown. This workout moves every muscle and rotates every joint. The workout can be done relaxed or with intesity, and the exercises can be done in advanced or beginner mode. The workout was designed by Kung Fu actors, and the workout is very well made. There is a seperate video to show you how to do each exercise, and a second extra video showing each exercise used in self defense.",1359244800,,426,4.618421052631579
7951804,5,B00005R5W3,This video is a great challenge! It's the most demanding video i bought until now. It takes a little while  before you reach the same speed than the teacher. The self-defence technique that you learn is useful. The teacher is an incredable athlete. He is fun too. I recommend this video to anyone who wants to get in very good shape and learn some self-defence.,1153180800,3,361,4.553846153846154
7951805,5,B00005R5W3,"I agree with a past reviewer who said it's unfair TJ Storm & this set didn't get marketed better. It should have been bigger then Tae Bo. It's more precise about body awareness & keeping posture & balance & uses real strikes such as spear hand, palm strikes, blocks & kicks used in martial arts. They really care about watching for sloppy form, etc.
It comes with a 20 minute beginning tutorial that shows you the PROPER FORM to do the strikes, blocks & kicks with TJ Storm. TJ gives plenty of instruction, though I only wish he showed it from different angles.
The demonstrations is 13 min & shows you how you would use those moves in a self-defense situation. The video is slowed down & paused to show key posture points that are vital to make sure you understand & to do them yourself effectively.
The cardio is 48 min with TJ & about 10 other men & women with GREAT form all practicing the strikes, blocks & kicks with you like a real martial arts class. This class is awesome. After already 6 years, this is still one of the few authentic, training martial arts video there is that explains well, isn't watered down, in English with great video quality & also has a cardio section.
I wish this was found in DVD & wish there was more like it out there.
I never got into Tae Bo since my mother bought the VHS years go when it first came out & I was shockingly disappointed in even how Billy Blanks couldn't even stretch to touch his toes while sitting, and seem to rush & not care about giving proper emphasis on good form which is the core of the true power of marital arts or any real self-defense. Bad form = you breaking your toes just kicking someone if you don't know how to point the foot correctly.
This VHS set is the real deal, not watered down where you can get hurt.",1148947200,4,1781,4.287833827893175
7951806,5,B00005R5W3,"Recently, I yearned for a more authentic way of practicing the discipline of martial arts for physical fitness. I remembered this set ordered it.  I am so sorry I did not purchase this workout series when it first appeared on the market in 2000.  I am also sorry that TJ Storm did not get the respect he deserves nor was his video properly marketed.  This workout is so enjoyable and invigorating.  It does take practice and does not use  the basic cardiokicboxing moves but it is so powerful.  Not for the weak of heart.

If you are wanting a truly fascinating workout based on a martial arts discipline, do what you can to purchase Cardio Kungfu!!",1135814400,3,649,4.543103448275862
7951807,5,B00005R5W3,"This set of tapes is a great workout!  It is an intense work out that keeps you interested.  Some of the moves are hard to get down at first, but I practiced them slowly and was able to quickly gain speed.
The applications video is great too because you learn how to apply what you learn working out to a self defense scenario.",1031702400,9,327,4.174603174603175
