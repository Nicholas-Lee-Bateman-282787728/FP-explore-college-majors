1258166,3,B000034DE4,"Others here have hashed over plot details, etc. so I'll just weigh in with the general consensus that Killer Shrews is the better of the two flicks here. The budgetary limitations are obvious, but if you can get over the fact that the monsters don't look anything like shrews, and the silly duck-walking thing, there's a fairly taut little thriller in there. Giant Gila Monster is less effective, with cornball humor, cringeworthy musical numbers, liberal doses of maudlin sentimentality, and a really blah monster dragging down its 'camp' appeal. This movie really needed Eddie Cahn or Herb Strock at the helm. Watchable but probably not quite bent enough for many C-movie enthusiasts.
The Diamond DVD is a mixed bag as well. First, I did not experience any of the technical problems that others have reported here; my disc played fine (other than some visible pixelation during the lightning flashes in Shrews) and I had no problem accessing any menu items, etc. Second, while neither source print is spectacular, they are definitely NOT transferred from mediocre VHS tapes as one reviewer stated. Compared to my VHS copy of Killer Shrews, the print used here compares quite favorably. There is some light speckling and scratching, but no major damage or jump-cutting. The tonal values are quite decent, (slightly richer than my VHS) and sharpness and shadow/highlight detail are much improved. For the money spent I'm quite pleased with Killer Shrews. Giant Gila Monster fares not so well. Compared to my VHS copy taped off public TV the DVD source print is sharper but also quite a bit darker, particularly in the night scenes and toward the end of the film in general. The highlight and midtone detail are thus actually improved in many scenes, but the shadow detail fills in a bit in the lighter scenes and a lot in the darker scenes, rendering much of the climax of the movie very murky. The DVD also exhibits more overall wear: light speckling and scratching, distracting reel change 'dots', jump cuts between reels, etc. In other words, even though the DVD is sharper, I'm hanging on to my videotape.
For me, Killer Shrews alone is worth the price of this disc (I'm assuming Madacy's version is as horribly butchered as their other Killer Creature Double Features). I wouldn't recommend spending the bucks just to get The Giant Gila Monster unless you have no other copy available. Does anyone have specific info on the quality of Elite's version?",1000512000,5,2456,4.934782608695652
1258167,2,B000034DE4,"For those interested in these two classic, bad b-monster films, here is a warning. This paricular DVD, which claims to be 'digitally remastered' looks like a direct transfer from fair quality VHS tapes. At one point during ""Gila Monster"", the tape slows and nearly grinds to a stop. And there is a slight pause between the two (yes, only two) chapter stops in each film.
Worst of all, the creepy opening narration for ""The Killer Shrews"" is cut to only its last line! This 70-minute epic has been reduced to 68 minutes!
Admittedly the video quality is fine and the sound is quite good on this disc, but in truth, you get what you pay for.
Other reviews here have discussed the movies at length. Yes these are badly done movies, but ""Killer Shrews"" is still far superior to the ""Gila Monster"". At least the shrews are entertaininly bad and, for this reviewer at least, the movie does generate a couple of real chills. James Best is as always, a handsome and underrated actor.
""The Giant Gila Monster"" is just plain bad. Unfortunately, the lead actor Don Sullivan, who shows promise, did not go far afterward.",1000425600,2,1107,4.653061224489796

The songs thrown in were a little silly, but they gave me a good chance to get a snack without pausing the DVD.  Did I know how the whole thing was going to turn out in the end?  YES, of course, but I still had a good time getting there.  Honestly, if you are placing an order already, just go on and add this one too.

1258169,4,B000034DE4,"I bought this DVD specifically for ""The Killer Shrews"".  If you like Ed Wood, this movie should appeal to you.  The Shrews are a low budget special affect-but the story still works.  This is the only role I've seen Ken Curtis in, other than Festus on Gunsmoke.  In a way, this movie is a precursor to ""Night of the Living Dead""-a group of people are isolated at a house surrounded by killer shrews instead of Zombies--and being on an Island, they need to find a way to escape to the safety of a boat.  The first copy I purchased of this DVD was defective, but the replacement I received plays fine.  I would recommend the version with a red cover showing a gila monsters claw picking up a jalopy ---I tried the other version on 3 different DVD players, and was unable to play it successfully on any of them. ""The Giant Gila Monster"" is ok-but I wouldn't have purchased this DVD just for that movie--it's not all that interesting.",980294400,3,929,4.435294117647059
1258170,1,B000034DE4,"I am a big fan of bad horror movies, and I've purchased other horror films in Diamond's budget DVD library and enjoyed them.  Their DVD of GIANT GILA MONSTER / KILLER SHREWS, though, is absolutely terrible.  When my first copy arrived, my DVD player began skipping around on the movies--in other words, 45 seconds into GIANT GILA MONSTER, the movie would freeze for a moment and then fast forward to the 35 minute mark.  I ordered a replacement and had the exact same problem.  If you scroll down to other users, you'll see that others had problems accessing bonus features (if you can call the scant information screens on this disc bonus features), etc.  This is a shame as I'd like to have these two flicks in my ""cheesy horror"" collection.  If you're looking for Diamond budget DVDs, I'd recommend their Vincent Price double-feature LAST MAN ON EARTH / HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL.  The movies aren't in great shape, but at least the DVD is stable.  Avoid this one though.",980294400,3,970,4.6647058823529415
1258171,3,B000034DE4,"OK, these are two egregiously awful pieces of movie-making.  Yes, yes, of course.
However, if you enjoy cheesy movies with over-the-top plots, truly bad monster effects, wacky dialogue, and heroines with inexplicable foreign accents, get this two-movies-in-one DVD.  The price is right, and you'll have hours of guilty pleasure watching teenagers save a pathetic podunk town, and dogs with bits of carpeting glued on them gamboling about looking not at all like fierce, threatening giant shrews.
But, don't be confused.  These are BAD movies.",972172800,,542,5.428571428571429
1258172,1,B000034DE4,"This film has got to go into someone's worst 100 films of all time. The corny acting, the incredible plot, the bathotic subplot of the crippled sister, and unrealistic monster, and the squalid special effects all contribute to this. My favorite worst moments? The hero's rock music (and he gets to sing 3 songs, and reprise at least one of them) is actually painfully bad--horrid songs, badly performed! The miniature train derailed thanks to the monster is obviously a badly-scaled vintage Marx train (each car could seat perhaps a dozen). The monster himself never appears in the same scene as a human--a dead giveaway that this is not a prime effects film--and is obviously an everyday gila monster shot amongst poor models.
For the plus side? The film is tightly plotted, and moves with a certain terrible inevitability (that COULD be the stuff of high drama). The film is also efficient, without those loose ends and red herrings that destroy many lesser films.",971740800,,966,4.932515337423313
1258173,3,B000034DE4,"I give this DVD release three stars, but I need to explain its positive and negative points for you to understand it (hence the asterisk).
The good points: 1. The price is unbeatable. 2. You get TWO movies for that  price. 3. The movies REALLY aren't all that bad. Ignore for a moment the  mediocre acting, the corniness and the poor special effects, and THE KILLER  SHREWS has at its heart a terrifying siege while THE GIANT GILA MONSTER has  some genuinely well-drawn characters and a surprisingly decent  script.
The bad points: 1. Yes, the transfer is sub-par. A lot of  pixelation, especially during bright flashes in darkness (like the  lightning strikes during the hurricane in THE KILLER SHREWS). 2. Two  chapter stops per film, and one of each is the beginning. 3. Few 'extras'  per se, but some interesting trivia bits on difficult-to-read text  screens.
Now that you know all that, take into consideration the fact  that most VHS copies are recorded in EP, and this DVD (despite its  below-average quality) is miles ahead of those VHS tapes... and the price  is probably better, too. So, overall, I think it's worth it.",945043200,34,1130,4.7927461139896375

1258175,1,B000034DE4,"On the back of the case for these Legend Films DVD's, it states ""The Killer Shrews has been beautifully restored"".  If so, why didn't they use that print on the DVD?  What is on the disc is the worst example of a ""restored"" film I have ever seen.  There are multiple bad splices, a section of film with extreme damage, and while the actual picture quality is sharper there is just too much minor damage(lines, etc.).  If they are going to ""restore"" a film, they should at least start with a decent print.  I've seen a print of this on a budget 50-movie pack that didn't have the splices and damage that this had(although the picture wasn't as sharp).  This is in full screen and I understand it was filmed that way.  The print for The Giant Gila Monster is better.  It looks like it has been cleaned up but I wouldn't call it a restoration.  The picture quality is sharper and there are no bad splices.  This is a full screen version of an originally widescreen film.  I understand Image has a widescreen version.  Legend continues its tradition of releasing good films in multilated form, showing a complete lack of caring for the film and for the consumer.  I was hoping for a good release of these B/W films, but my hopes were again dashed by Legend.  If they could just manage to put out a decent release of the B/W films, I could put up with their despicable colorization of them(of which I never have and never will watch a colorized film).  The films themselves, I have no problems with.",1247529600,,1494,4.4411764705882355

1258178,5,B000034DE4,"From the folks that brought us the colorized dvds of NOTLD, Carnival of Souls, Reefer Madness, House on Haunted Hill and Plan 9 from Outer Space, you can now add The Killer Shrews / The Giant Gila Monster to the list.  First off, this is a 2 disc set.  Disc 1 contains both movies colorized, while the second disc contains the BW versions with extras.  The extras include Giant Gila trailer (in anamorphic 16x9!), info on gilas and shrews, a weird video of a squirrel (?!) and colorized trailers for the titles I listed in the first sentence.  Now you're probably wondering, how is the quality on these.  I have two copies of the Killer Shrews already and the print on this is by far the best I've seen.  Sure it has some print damage here and there, but this by far the sharpest I've seen both movies.  If anything, get the disc set for the BW versions as I doubt any better copies are out there.  The audio is clear however some hiss is present.  As for the colorized versions, they look the same as the other movies if you have seen them.  The best way I can describe is that it's not quite realistic, but more of a comic book feel to it.  It's not far fetched in how the colors are used as they try their best to make it realistic, but something about the colorization still doesn't seem real.  But, they are definitely interesting to check out.

Overall, I HIGHLY recommend this set.  I've been waiting for years for a SE Killer Shrews disc and this is it in my opinion.",1185062400,22,1475,4.316363636363636
1258179,4,B000034DE4,"This dvd gets 4 stars because of the production and remake of the old films. The only reason that I did not give it 5 is because it was hard to read the liner notes in the extra stuff because they were too small and in a bright color. You just about have to sit with your nose to the screen to read any of the notes. Who knew Roscoe P. Coltrain had it in him? If your not into classic horror movies, because these movies could be corny to those who don't like the Fake FX, or the one line dialog, Then you need not spend your money on this. But this is a great movie set and for less than seven bucks you will be joining in on the best of James Best and one big ugly gila monster and a fast Hot rod!! Long Live Classic Horror!!",1124668800,,727,3.8533333333333335
1258180,4,B000034DE4,"This DVD brings us a pair of movies from director Ray Kellogg, whose most notable work would be the John Wayne film ""The Green Berets.""  But long before he worked with the Duke, Kellogg made a couple of low budget monster movies that show you what sort of creatures you come up with when you do not have any money.  The good news is that one of those two bad B-movies should tickle your fancy and make the double feature worth the viewing.

""The Giant Gila Monster"" is one of those films where you take a real animal and having it crawl through miniature sets. The tagline for this film was: ""Only Hell could breed such an enormous beast. Only God could destroy it!"" But this 1959 film made in north Texas for $138,000, is a lot more low-keyed than those lines would suggest. In fact, what is interesting given when this film is made is the key relationship between Sheriff Jeff (Fred Graham) and young Chase Winstead (Don Sullivan). The kid is working on his hot rod and instead of busting his chops the sheriff really functions as a mentor: he says he is concerned about the kids in town, and you actually believe it. The idea of having a movie in which a teenage hot rodder, who also sings like Pat Boone who is not a juvenile delinquent, or at least treated like one by the cops, is rather refreshing, although admittedly the character is a bit heavy on the saccharine. But Sullivan has a natural charm and the guy wrote his own songs, so give him some credit.

But since we are talking letting a Gila monster wander through miniatures in a film with teenage hot rodders, of course this movie received ""MST3K"" treatment (Season 4, when Joel turned Crow and Servo into ""The Thing With Two Heads"" as inspired by the movie of the same name""). My major complaint about this film is that the day for night shooting is so dark I have a hard time figuring out what is happening. Obviously the special effects budget is such that most of the ""horror"" is suggested by quick cuts rather than actually showing everything. Still, I like the way that everybody is pretty level headed in this film and deal with the giant Gila monster in a relatively intelligent manner without wasting a lot of time and effort. Yes, finding the monster, which is the size of several houses, should not take so long, but then the movie would be shorter and it is only 74 minutes anyway.

For me there is a lot more fun to be had with ""The Killer Shrews,"" a 1959 movie that takes itself seriously despite having Miss Universe 1957, dogs dressed up in shag carpets, rubber heads with big teeth, and an escape plan that you have to see to believe.  The only question is why did ""MST3K"" wait until season four to take on this one?  This one has to be on my list of top ten bad monster movies.  Thorne Sherman (James Best) delivers supplies to an island just as a hurricane is coming.  He wants to wait out the story, but Dr. Milo Craigis (Baruch Lumet) wants Thorne to leave right away and take his daughter Ann (Ingrid Goude, Miss Sweden 1956 and then Miss Universe 1957), with him.  The Doctor sounds German while his daughter has a very interesting Swedish accent, but that is not the biggest mystery on the island.

Dr. Craigis is concerned with over population and apparently his idea is was to shrink people to make food go farther.  To this end he experiments with the DNA of shrews who (a) grow to the size of dogs wearing shag carpeting, (b) have all of their worst traits becoming dominant, and (c) develop poison saliva.  You would think that any one of those three could cause problems when there are 300 shrews running around on an island, but no, all three happen.  The number of humans starts dwindling as the shrews need desert after eating all of the livestock on the island, so everybody starts drinking more (think about it: do you really want DRUNK giant vicious shrews with poison saliva?).  Jerry Farrell (Ken Curtis) decides that Ann sparking to Thorne is worse than having giant shrews attacking them, but soon sees the error of his ways and decides that going up on the roof would be a good idea.  That is also because he thinks that the idea that Thorne comes up with to escape to the boat is stupid, but I have to say, in terms of 1950s black & white monster movies this plan actually makes sense.

Special mention must be made of Gordon McLendon who plays Dr. Radford Baines, the dedicated assistant to Dr. Craigis and who remains the consummate scientist even once he has been bitten.  His death sets up what is probably the funniest line of the movie until we get to the end where the last exchange of dialogue provides a pretty funny punch line to the entire experience of pure terror trying to get away from the giant vicious shrews with poison saliva.  There is just too much to enjoy in this movie, from listening to Goude's accent (you know it has to be Swedish but it does not sound Swedish and trying to figure out what it does sound like will drive you crazy), to watching the dogs covered in carpet frolick around the silly humans rolling on the ground, and waiting for one of the teeth on the rubber shrew heads to get caught on something and break off.  ""The Killer Shrews"" is my kind of bad movie.",1116028800,,5208,4.439203354297694
1258181,2,B000034DE4,"I have to admit to the same technical difficulties with my DVD as others have reported.  Once in a while it goes out of focus and even seems to freeze at one point.  The edition I have has a different cover than the one on Amazon. Com but the company and the double-movies are the same.
I bought the DVD for THE KILLER SHREWS and it is the most entertaining of the two films.  While the costumed dogs are a bit hokey, with a little imagination, it works fine.  Anyway, puppets are used for close-ups.  The premise is simple.  The over-sized mice eat anything that moves and the only food left are the people on the island.  The people have to get to the boat or die.  We are spared the gore so common in movies these days but there is still a lot of suspense.  You never know when one of the hungry beasts is going to pop up.  If they bite you, you're dead.  There is poison in their saliva.  After that, you're dinner.  There are some recognizable actors in the film, too, familiar from programs like the Dukes of Hazzard and Gunsmoke.  Oh, by the way, the beginning seems a bit truncated and starts abruptly.  I seem to remember a school-type mini-documentary (only a few seconds) at the begining with footage of real shrews. It is missing from the DVD and may be the result of a poor master film copy.
As for THE GIANT GILA MONSTER, the lizard is not really scary and the miniature sets look like miniature sets.  Don Sullivan is the likeable hero, a hard-working boy down on his luck but able to sing.  He decides to use some nitro he had in storage to fight the creature.  Convenient for sure, but don't we all keep some handy for a stray monster?  The kid is so cleaned-cut, friends with the sheriff no doubt, and forcing his gang to behave, that we have to wonder if the movie's makers were trying to win parents over.  There was a lot of negative opinion about the wild ways in 50's movies.
The director Ray Kellogg liked using foreign beauties in his films.  Both movies feature a love interest with an accent, one from France and the other from Sweden.  Indeed, Ingrid Goude in THE KILLER SHREWS was a Miss Universe Beauty Pageant Winner.

This is a picture of life before CGI. The contrived dialog is part of the mystique. You get to see hotrods and large lizards. The blob it is not; but it is a necessary addition to any 50' collection.

A teenage boy and a teenage girl disappear together and the law is getting suspicious.

I want to ask the monster if teenagers taste like chicken.

The Killer Shrews

I first saw this in the movies. And let me tell you this is really spooky for kids (or used to be.)

We find our selves on an island where a hand full of visitors, including us, find eerie from the beginning. Of course from the title we are anticipating ""you know whats"" at any time. But the visitors to this island have no idea what they are in for.

An experiment with the intent of correcting overpopulation has gone awry, et voil killer shrews. These ravenous creatures must eat many times their weight daily to keep from starving. And I must say that Ingrid Goude (Miss Universe Sweden 1956) would make a tasty snack (not that I notices at the movies.)

Well the people are protected by adobe (mud) walls from the poisonous fanged carnivores (did I mention the fangs are poisonous?)

So overall a pretty good mix up but the Shrews was the better one with some kinda creepy moments and hilarious special effects that you'll notice right away. Worth the buy.,1361232000,,412,4.036585365853658
7916695,4,B000034DE4,"Cheesy, horrible special effects. The killer shrews are large dogs with pieces of carpet on them. If you are a fan of cheesy b horror/sci fi movies of the 50s and 60s, you will love this!  The plot isn't the best. In fact, there is nothing that's really done well with this movie. But it is great for a few laughs!",1279065600,,314,4.147540983606557
7916696,5,B000034DE4,"Ive had two different versions of these two films for many years now, the quality was very poor, both video and soundtrack,  I took a chance on this ""LEGEND FILMS"" set,
 MAN! AM I GLAD I DID!
I honestly believe this is the best quality any company has ever released of these classic old movies, both video and soundtrack,

killer shrews has a 30 second video glitch when the man is trapped in the tree by the killer shrews, but it is still the highest over all quality of any other release, the movie plays fine after that,

I know some people want just black and white like the origional
release, no problem,  with this set you have the best of both worlds,
one disc in black and white,  or the other disc colorized,

you watch the film the way you think it is more enjoyable!

Out of all the different sets that have been offered,  THIS IS THE SET YOU WANT !!!

thank you again, ""LEGEND FILMS"" !!!

for a job well done.",1260144000,,921,4.235632183908046
