This movie is pretty good! It's basically a WIP movie that has a similar tone to classics such as Schoolgirls in Chains, Trophy Heads, Olga's Girls, Sexually Deranged, and Bloodsucking Freaks. It's good sleazy fun!

Young women are being abducted for breeding and milking by a creepy sicko.  Aside from the gratuitous t & a, and amusing dialogue, the film also features the lurid gimmick of milking the women like livestock. Can't wait for part two! Not for the politically correct.

Though the film is a kindred spirit to Bloodsucking Freaks which is also distributed by Troma, it does not have a Troma feel to it. The movie, while ridiculous, is not nearly whacky enough, and a bit darker than your typical Lloyd Kaufman fare.

If you like Bloodsucking Freaks, Defiled, and Gutterballs, then you will probably like this one too.",1490745600,2,966,4.726190476190476

8653994,4,B00JVB7E30,"This is a classic Troma film. If you like The Toxic Avenger and movies like The Sinful Dwarf or Human Centipede, youll dig this! It doesnt disappoint, and has lits of boobies. The milking scene is something you won't soon forget. The opening is a little choppy, but when it picks up its a lot of fun!",1406160000,3,300,4.280701754385965
8653995,1,B00JVB7E30,I thought that this film would be good at best but it's a dog of a movie. The filming sucks and cast is not very attractive.,1401926400,2,124,3.8076923076923075
