8122588,5,B000FHBOHQ,"According to an email I received from Quartet International (Who ownes Between the Wars now), it seems that this series WILL be released on DVD this Fall. This is great news for fans of the series!

I will believe it when I actually see it, but my hopes are certainly up. Quartet International said that the series will be released in Oct/Nov 2007 through PBS (which sells many DVDs on Amazon, so I expect to see it here soon).

Keep your fingers crossed!",1188777600,,455,4.469879518072289
8122589,5,B000FHBOHQ,"""Between the Wars"" (BtW) hosted by Eric Severeid, is an excellent series. I have watched every episode at least once. Some of the episodes I have watched 5 or 6 times. ""The World at War"" (WaW) is one of the best documentaries made about World War II (the best in my humble opinion). If you own that series and enjoy it, then you should watch BtW. BtW fills in the gap left by WaW: That gap being what happened from 1919 to 1941.

While WaW gives the history of World War II from a British perspective, BtW gives it from the perspective of the United States. So in essence you are getting a global history AND a U.S. history of the period at the same time with the issues it covers. BtW includes interviews with many people from the period and also historians. You will get to see the late great George F Kennan, Americans who went to fight in the Spanish Civil War,  historians such as Robin W. Winks (author of ""Europe, 1890-1945: Crisis and Conflict""), as well as many others.

One of the reasons I am so enamored with the series is because it covers subjects that are so rarely seen in a documentary. Some of the rare issues covered are Japan's expansion during the 1930's; Italy's conquest of Abyssinia (Ethiopia); The Spanish Civil War; America's recognition of the Soviet Union; and other areas. Just look at the episode list. This series is a gold mine that fills the vacuum of time between World War I and World War II.

These videos were released in 1987 even though the series was made in 1978. The series was nominated for an Emmy in 1978. Although it is an old series, it has aged well and it deserves to be released on DVD. With all of the other... crap I see out there, this series would sell well if promoted properly (1978-2008 30th Anniversary Edition?). BtW is unique in that it fills the gap between the two World Wars. If you have any interest in that period, see this series (while expensive to buy for VHS, it is possible that your local library or school district may have these tapes. Check it out, you never know).

Edit 04/16/08: This series has now been released on DVD. Go to Shop PBS and then select Educational Media. Search for Between the Wars and you will find it. This is a great series and I hope Amazon gets it soon!

Edit 07/27/13: This series has been re-released under the title&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Road-to-World-War-II/dp/B005GP7ERQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Road to World War II</a>. Glad it is on DVD, just wish they cleaned up the footage a little. Enjoy!",1188345600,2,2554,4.67706013363029
