8453973,3,B000WTZ6A8,"I ordered this in conjunction with Knight's band workout.  I think that the ball workout is more challenging than the band workout and I like the way that she focuses on breathing.  I don't find the program all that challenging so, I've already had to order more challenging ball workout CDs.  I think that this video would be good for someone just beginning a workout regimen, or just beginning a pilates-style workour regimen.",1203638400,6,428,4.835616438356165
