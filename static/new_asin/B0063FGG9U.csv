4935420,5,B0063FGG9U,"Finally!!! We have the complete series of Here Come The Brides. This wonderful romantic, comedy-drama set in the beautiful Pacific Northwest of the 19th century was lavishly produced. The stars were magnificent, especially Bobby Sherman and David Soul. Joan Blondell, a superstar of earlier years, was great in this, too. This is a wonderful family show to have. It's full of comedy, romance, drama and suspense. The quality of season one from Sony was out of this world. It's a great collector's item for Bobby Sherman and David Soul fans. Also, Mark Lenard from Star Trek had a starring role.",1205625600,26,594,4.95

4935449,5,B0063FGG9U,"This is a wonderful show, and so well made and thoughtful.  The characters are very likable, and the story lines are interesting and a little deeper than most shows of that time.  The production values are tremendous, and you just don't see shows like this anymore.  What I like about this show is that outcomes are not always as you would expect, and the main characters are very kind and good people, and that makes you root for them and care about them.  I enjoyed this show when I was a child, and even more so now as an adult because they were so well written and acted and really hold up today.  Each show had a moral to it.  We need more shows like this one now, for sure.",1433462400,,679,4.184615384615385
4935450,5,B0063FGG9U,a classic. Glad they put it on DVD.,1431907200,,35,3.5
4935451,5,B0063FGG9U,"I am a Here Come the Brides fan even though I wasn't born until a year after it left the air.  You didn't have to grow up watching it to be a fan!  I think of the show as a Western hybrid.  Kinda like Bonanza meets Little House on the Prairie.  It had all the earmarks of an old 60's Western - that old familiar feel - and yet it centered around the Bolt family (Jason, Joshua and Jeremy) and certain members of the community and some episodes kept a continuing storyline, such as Jeremy and Candy Pruitt's engagement.

The second season said good-bye to one of my favorite couples, Big Swede and Miss Essie (and we never again see Emily Perkins after her baby is born), but we still got to say a big ""HOWDY"" once again to the intrepid Holly Houston.  Such a joy to watch Jason squirm again!  We also got introduced to Aaron Stemple's sister and watched the big fist fight between him and Jason as result (not to mention an almost shotgun wedding), Clancy's brother Father Ned, and the Bolt brother's Uncle Duncan.

PS  What ever happened to Anne and Franny from the first season?  Did they get married?  Sigh.

I have seen around the Internet some people say they watched the first couple of episodes of the show and quit.  I think that's a shame, because as fun as the first season was, I liked the second season better.  I guess I found the second season more ""thoughtful.""  Instead of centering around the Bolt-Stemple feud over Bridal Veil Mountain, the men bury the hatchet and although they don't always see eye to eye, become friends.  Jason isn't quite as exuberant - he too has matured and become more thoughtful (Although I liked Jason's character both ways...  Dear Mr. Brown, you are brilliant!)  and we see him as head of the family more than ever as he interacts with Candy's younger sister and brother who are now a permanent part of the cast.  I felt like this was a natural progression for the character after the first season's last episode, ""The Deadly Trade"" and the second season's first episode, ""A Far Cry From Yesterday.""  People don't go through those kinds of events without changing, and that's why I like this show - character progression!

We see Jeremy and Candy begin to mature and their relationship grow.  We learn that Lottie has a daughter and Joan Blondell gives a fabulous performance in protecting her from an ex.  Bobby Sherman sings ""Take A Giant Step"" as the background music in the episode ""Absalom"" which is is a heartbreaking episode.  So forth and so on.  And let's not forget to mention David Soul's performance as Joshua in ""Two Women.""  Wow.  Just wow.  When he says that agonizing line, ""Oh Jason,"" my stomach flips.

This is the season where child abuse, prejudice, drug abuse (drug dealing - see ""The She-Bear""), a healthy respect for guns, being responsible for the environment, and mental illness are addressed in various ways.  Still, there are many funny, lighthearted moments. Including an episode centered around the legend of Bigfoot.

Loved every moment of these shows and I am like every other fan - why oh why did they stop there???  Okay, we all know WHY, but it doesn't keep me from wishing there was more.  :)",1430179200,4,3174,4.590747330960854

4935481,5,B0063FGG9U,"I was a little girl when this aired on TV in the late '60s, but remembered Bobby Sherman well and decided to watch it on one of the cable nostalgia channels. It was so enjoyable I decided to buy the DVDs (at least the ones I could afford). What a great ensemble cast and fun stories! I was never crazy about westerns, but you can't call HCTB a western, really. I think my favorite episodes were the ones with Cicely Tyson as a potential bride for logger Obie Brown and the one where Denver Pyle plays the Bolt uncle who comes over on the boat from Scotland. This was quality television, the worst HCTB episode overshadows the best of some of the TV we have today. Too bad Season 1 is so expensive, I would like to see it. C'mon Sony, re-release it at a normal price!",1410652800,,766,4.217687074829932

4935492,5,B0063FGG9U,"This ABC series is based on the popular musical. Excellent casting and sets. Storylines included guest actors like Ed Asner and Bill Mumy. Also starred a pre popular David Soul who went on to do a Dirty Harry movie and ""Starsky and Hutch."" Bobby Sherman brought the teen age women to the show as one of the Bolt brothers. The show was character driven along with the fight for control of the mountain. Very funny and easy moving western like ""Bonanza"" and ""Laredo."" Unfortunately the first season is out of print so this it.",1404604800,,524,4.585106382978723

4935494,5,B0063FGG9U,Came on time and the whole set was in great shape.  No rough spots.  Highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys TV from late '60s to early '70s.,1402790400,,145,4.142857142857143
4935495,5,B0063FGG9U,"My wife came from a fairly strict home.  The family didn't have a TV past the early 70s.  When she was very little she remembered watching a show with her dad that involved characters named Jeremy, Jason, and Joshua.  She even thought about using those names for our kids.  It was fun to watch her as she slowly realized that this was the show she watched all those years ago when she was just 4.

They don't make shows like this anymore, and truthfully, back then they rarely made them.  If you are looking for a show about logging in the Seattle area during the 1800s, this about your only choice.  The simple plot lines surrounding romantic and business problems resolved by people on their way to building a life together still resonate.  Robert Brown leads the cast as Jason Bolt, the oldest of the Bolt brothers.  Bobby Sherman and David Soul got their starts on this show.  The cast also includes Mark Lenard who would go on to play Spock's father on Star Trek. The show's original instrumental theme is interspersed throughout the discs.  That was the only reason I liked the show when I was little.  If you were a fan of the original show this set is a must.

At  the time of this writing, the price for the set is still in the low to mid $20s.  Compare that to the $175 to $195 Sony is asking for the Season 1 discs and you have a winner.  The only extras are a halting commentary from an expert on the show.  Some of these are interesting and they don't force you to watch a complete show while people involved with the show ramble on in the background.  It is still a great value for your dollar if you enjoyed this series.",1401235200,3,1635,4.322368421052632
4935496,4,B0063FGG9U,This was a well done show but first year really shines! If you like Westerns like Bonanza etc you will enjoy!! Get season 1 first!!,1396569600,,131,4.28
4935497,5,B0063FGG9U,Not as violent as most westerns but with a little comedy thrown in as well. People living in the 1800's in the Pacific Northwest region of the U.S.A. and their everyday lives are shown in this good TV series. Wholesome family entertainment. Maybe a little boring for kids but you know they are not watching anything above their rating. Classic family entertainment!,1393459200,,365,4.903225806451613

Stick to Season one if you like this show.",1376697600,2,314,4.0
4935521,1,B0063FGG9U,"But that is about all I can say about Season two. Season One was FANTASTIC and i bought it and have played and played it. But season 2...just didn't have the impact season 1 had. And they brought back alot of the special characters from season one and even they were not as good as in the first season. The stories focused more on ""new people in town"" and things like that and the first episode was where the brides were celebrating their one year anniversary of being in Seattle for a year. Which means the bet between the Bolts and Stemple was not done and over with so that whole story line was no longer, which took most of the intrigue out of the show...every week it was ""Are the brides going to leave?"" Then they brought brother and sister to Candy to town and that was silly. and the plots were never about the logging camp and the Bolts and Aaron always got along and it just wasn't as good. I have Season 2 up for sale!",1376006400,,929,4.195530726256983
4935522,4,B0063FGG9U,"I don't know why I like this show so much -- it's nothing at all like what I usually watch, if I watch anything at all. I started watching it in the reruns because Mark Lenard was in it and I had always liked him from his appearances in the several iterations of Star Trek. I was even lucky enough to meet him and talk to him and get his autograph while he was still doing the convention circuits.

The stories are much better than people realize. They are consistently good with very different twists just where you expect cliches. True, there are a few that get bogged down is corny social justice or the humdrum, but on the whole, they are far better and more imaginative than the junk you see today. Most of the acting is also good, and it's great fun to watch actors on their way up, some in a holding pattern, and a few on their way down. Some of the best and most interesting and durable character actors have good parts in this series. The scenery is gorgeous and the show is very pretty to watch. Sure, nobody in pioneer Seattle had such beautiful clean clothes, such perfect teeth, and so much hair done in such complicated styles (some of which doesn't match what shows of the the actresses' real hair color). The show's child actors are also very pleasant and refreshing, not the usual mouthy brats showing off and trying to run things. They do sometimes get into trouble, but rather quietly and according to deductions and logic that make sense to them.

The only faults I see with the series are the way the characters of Biddie Cloom and Captain Clancy are handled. Biddie is a comic character, and in several places the writers almost give her a brain, then lapse back into dumb actions and an irritating giggle. Skillful writing could have kept the comic aspects of the character but made her a real person, and the actress was certainly up to creating that kind of character. I can't, however, forgive anybody for Captain Clancy, with his drunk act and overdone fake Irish accent. Nobody as stupid as Clancy could have managed a rowboat, let alone a voyage around the treacherous tip of South America. And no class act like Lottie the saloon owner could possibly have tolerated such a clod for five minutes. Clancy, like Biddie, had the potential for being a very strong character instead of a travesty, and I can't tell whether it was the fault of the writers or the actor -- probably some of both.

I am glad that both seasons of this show are now available on DVDs. As I said before, I don't exactly know why I like it so much, but I do -- it's one of those shows combining good stories, good acting, action, comedy, emotion, and visual delight that is always a pleasure to watch. And I can always turn down the volume when I can't stand Captain Clancy any longer.",1375142400,2,2785,4.456862745098039

4935546,4,B0063FGG9U,"As brilliant as the first year of HCTB was, the second year was a disappointment to me.  Gone was the vibrant group dynamic of brides vs. loggers, as ALL of the secondary female characters disappeared.  Only Candy and Biddie remained, backed by nonspeaking extras.  Candy's kid brother and sister arrived, creating an artificial excuse for Candy and Jeremy to remain unmarried.  It became a more intimate show, focusing on the handful of main characters, and lost most of its liveliness.  Often there was a ""cause of the week,"" dealing with prejudice against foreigners, black people, Native Americans, people with handicaps, etc.  There was much less comedy, and the comedy had been effective because it was character-driven.  Another case of a TV series changing the very formula which had made it successful.

It has beautiful views of the Seattle area when it was just a small settlement and loggers wanted marriageable women in order to stay in Seattle and make homes.  The Bolt brothers in the series are based on the true stories of log camp owners who went to Massachusetts and brought back potential brides.  The cast is great!  In the first season there is even a very young Bruce Lee in an episode.  Season Two continues with great guests like Cicely Tyson.  It is so great to relive this great old series episode by episode.  It is clean entertainment and a look into the past with loveable characters.  The set is of good quality and I received it quickly.

After rewatching Season 1 over and over I had forgotten the shows from Season 2.  What a pleasure to re-experience them all over again!  Jason, Jeremy, Joshua Bolt (sigh) never disappoint.  The only annoying part was the addition of Candy's 2 younger siblings.  I had forgotten they were there until they made their appearance during one of the early episodes.  While they added nothing to the storylines at least I had my beloved Bolt brothers back.  This was a great show and wonderful to share with my teen daughters now.

get it wrong also.  Well, I was HALF right.  The vocal portion of the theme was included like originally shown, but they have
still included the wrong VISUAL version of the credits.  As a result, actor Henry Beckman, who was included in the opening credits

Although it's fantastic to finally have it on DVD, they've changed the intro and added vocals to the original intro music -- which was completely unnecessary. The other thing that irritates me is in the description. Whoever wrote it, clearly never watched the series. 1850s Seattle? In the pilot episode from season one, they clearly say a ""war just ended,"" the Civil War, which was the entire reason they went back east for the brides. Last I checked the Civil War was in the 1860s.

But the episode descriptions on the inside, plus the overall description of the show on the back cover, left alot to be desired. For instance, it said the brides came from San Francisco, when anyone who's familiar with the show knows they came from New Bedford, Massachusetts. Some of the episode descriptions are little more than what happens in the opening scene. In ""Candy and the Kid"" for example, the episode description says something like ""Jeremy is walking along and decides to take a walk on an old log""--which has nothing to do with the episode except that that's EXACTLY what happened in the opening scene of the episode! It's also fun to see some older actors in some of their early roles--Jack Albertson, Will Geer, Denver Pyle, Steve Ihnat, Mitch Vogel, etc. A great addition to my collection of old TV favorites!",1334793600,,970,4.745562130177515

And waited and waited and waited.  Finally, years after almost every one had completely given up hope comes the exciting news that Shout Factory was planning to release this season on DVD in early 2012!!!  Fans of BRIDES are thrilled and here's hoping this DVD set becomes one of the biggest sellers in Shout Factory's history!!

This superb program was never a blockbuster hit but has had a devoted following of fans since day one for it's unique blend of comedy and drama in a western setting.  The cast is superb headed by Robert Brown who is fantastic as the dashing, salt-of-the-earth Jason Bolt who is something of a father figure figure to his younger brothers Joshua (David Soul, several years before STARSKY AND HUTCH) and Jeremy (Bobby Sherman, then at the peak of his teen idol fame).  Joan Blondell is a delight as Lottie who runs the local saloon yet is something of a den mother to the hundred prospective brides the Bolts have brought into Seattle.  Miss Blondell was Emmy nominated for Best Actress both years of the show's run and this program was one of the highlights of her nearly 50-year Hollywood career.  Mark Leonard as the frequently villainous Aaron Stemple and Bridget Hanley as Jeremy's girlfriend Candy add much as well to the series as do several actors in semi-regular roles.

I'm hoping there are some nice extras in this set - maybe a few other tv appearances by cast members - but if it comes with nothing beyond every episode of season two that's more than enough to give this set five stars - HERE COME THE BRIDES home at last!!",1321747200,17,1747,4.627831715210356

I do have to wonder if the reason they have finally decided to release this lovely series in a legit release is because the show has been running on a cable station in MY area, at least, called RTV.  They run classic/popular shows like Get Smart, Star Trek, Fantasy Island - and Here Come the Brides, (padded wioth a lot of infomercials)and apparently the ratings (it runs on Saturday and Sunday mornings) have been pretty good!

Maybe the Powers That Be decided that they might as well release the show and make a lot of viewers happy that let home-recorded shows get revenue THEY would like... Who knows?

I would love to know if this DVD set contains any comentary episodes - after all, Robert Brown, David Soul and Bobby Sherman ARE all still alive.  It would be great, especially since Joan Blondell and Mark Lenord have passed on.

Now if only they would release one other show on my 40 year old wish list - The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.  (Which was on the air the same two short years (same time frame, too) that HCTB was!)",1321660800,8,1264,4.418103448275862
4935677,5,B0063FGG9U,"I really thought that season two of this awesome show would never be released, but I'm so happy to find out that it now has a release date!  I pre-ordered mine...can't wait till it arrives!",1321574400,9,189,4.4
4935678,5,B0063FGG9U,"So glad Shout Factory had the sense to bring out Season 2 of Here Come the Brides. Whatever Sony! Of course my preorders are in! I have been able to watch the Season 2 episodes on Retro TV and Antenna TV, so here is my review:
Most importantly, if you enjoyed Season 1 you are going to enjoy Season 2. The ""feel"" is a little bit different, of course, because the premise of the first season is no longer an issue...a year has passed and the Bolts managed to hang on to their mountain. Aaron Stempel is no longer an adversary, but actually more of a friend. Great relationship storyline there. There is a bigger focus on bringing new characters in to create (mostly) trouble that the Bolts and the townspeople have to overcome. Overall, lots of shady characters with ill intentions. Really little to no focus on weddings or brides, LOL. A few characters featured in Season 1 episodes return; for example, Holly Houston (GREAT episode-""Debt of Honor"") and Ed Asner's Matthew Balter in ""The Legend of Bigfoot"". Funny enough, the actress who plays Miss Essie in Season 1 returns in two different episodes--but not playing Miss Essie! In one she is a Greek wife; the other, a nun. William Schallert, who played a preacher in Season 1, is also back playing a con man in the Season 2 opener. Too funny, the producers back in that day must have either thought their audience was clueless or just hoped people wouldn't notice.
The main characters, as entertaining and endearing as always, are all still around-although you could tell real life was starting to take over for Bobby Sherman-his character is conspicously absent in some episodes where it would have made sense for him to be a part of things. Clearly he was out on the road touring and they had to film around his schedule. Fans won't be disappointed though-he is prominently featured in many episodes and you get the feeling he was on his way to being the major star of the show-even over Robert Brown. As was the case in Season 1, there are many appearances from ""before they were famous"" stars-Cicely Tyson, Georg Sanford Brown, Meg Foster, Lynda Day George...the little girl who plays Candy's sister is recognizable in future ""The Partridge Family"" episodes as Gloria Hickey.
From a storytelling perspective, the stories are engaging; a great and compelling mix of humor and light drama, and almost always have a message to do what's right and take care of others. Great episodes in particular for this are ""Hosanna's Way"" and ""Absolom"", where the Bolts (especially Jeremy) take care of troubled young orphan boys--they almost treat them like a little Bolt brother. Makes you wish they had a little Bolt brother!  There is a little more violence (i.e., guns, fighting, kidnappings) but also continued humor-particluarly on the part of Biddie (Susan Tolsky) who takes her character to a new level of comedy in this season-check out the episode ""How Dry We Are""-a classic! Still a series you could watch with the family and not be worried about inappropriate language or behaviour. So unlike most of today's TV... and so refreshing!
If you are like me, when the last episode plays you will be very disappointed that the series is over....hard to believe that Screen Gems(oops I mean ABC) was so clueless back in those days to the series gold that they had. Perhaps Screen Gems could have shopped it around and someone else could have picked it up, but maybe they didn't do that back then. Anyway... It's also clear that the writers had no idea when they wrote the last episode that they were ""writing the last episode""... there is really no closure to the original storyline or characters. If anyone ever chose to remake this series they would need to find a supertalented writing team who could build upon the original series, make it last longer (omg, there was so much potential there) and maybe give some closure to the original story. You will not be disappointed in this season though, I highly recommend it!",1321142400,34,3969,4.752173913043478
4935679,5,B0063FGG9U,"Almost 6 years between the Season 1 and Season 2 releases was way too long.  This show is timeless, funny, poignant and has a loyal following.  Watching the shows takes me back in time to when TV was good clean entertainment.  Not sure if Sony or some other company is releasing Season 2 but sure glad to hear that it is coming.

I never thought it would be released to home video, ever. So I was doubly surprised and thrilled when Season 1 arrived, and I hoped that HCTB would have aged well and I would not be disappointed. Well, I wasn't disappointed. It was terrific. Naturally, I had the expectation that Season 2 would be along by the following year. For the past 4 years, I've yearned in vain for Season 2.
