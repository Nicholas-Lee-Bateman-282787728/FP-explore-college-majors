2577367,4,B000FO0AME,"This season was full of hilarious moments, of course. What more can be said, right? The problem with this collection as well as season 7 was the packaging. Why didn't they just print the back part onto the box instead of gluing it there? I like the stacked discs instead of the fold outs like in earlier sets, though. If your a Simpsons fan, get it.

The Simpsons has been around and in production all my life (I would've been 5 when this season was new). Now, with Harry Shearer no longer a part of the show, I worry it may be only a matter of time before this nearly-26-years-in-the-making cartoon comes to an end.",1431561600,,472,4.552941176470588

2577399,5,B000FO0AME,"Season 8 is all too classic. I saw all these when originally broadcast: def a golden age. Lisa dates Nelson, Hurricane Neddy, Homer's Chili Pepper Trip, XFiles, Cherry Bobbins, and that's just one disc.
  The commentary for Simpsonscalifrag...
is fascinating: one writer admits he stonewalled this epi as long as he could, yet is became beloved. Matt Groening enters partway thru, saying 6 pm is his naptime. Later he grumbles that the proper aspect ratio 4:3. I have to reply that even tho my remote is busted, I still go to the pains of manually entering on my tv menu the proper ratio. Hope Mr Groening gets to read this.
  Otherwise, Season8 is a must!",1407542400,,656,4.678260869565217
2577400,5,B000FO0AME,"Season 8 of America's dysfunctional family is no different from some of it's past seasons.... in a good way. This season we see the return of special guest celebrities like Jon Lovitz and Kelsey Grammer as well as some new new stars such as Rodney Dangerfield, Johhny Cash, John Waters and more who fit greatly in The Simpson universe. Same goes for the awards too. The Simpsons season 8 had many Emmy Award nominations and winning 2 of them for episodes ""Bart After Dark"" and ""Homer's Phobia"" which also won a GLAAD Media Award for ""Outstanding TV  Individual Episode"". Other awards won were an Annie Award for Best Individual Achievement and the WAC Winner for Best Director for Primetime Series.

 Notable episodes from this season include ""Burns, Baby Burns"" Mr. Burns finds out that he has a son.... an embarrising one at that. ""The Homer they fall"" Homer a boxer?!?... Why not! His resume keeps on growing! ""The Springfield Files"" An Alien stirrs up comotion in Springfield. No, it's not Kang or Kodos, although they are in the ""Treehouse of Horror VII"" As they run for the oval office which is suprisingly fitting. ""Brother from another Series"" Sideshow Bob returns. This time he is actually NOT trying to kill Bart and is working with his brother Cecil who is voiced by David Hyde Pierce (See what they did there!?..) who actually has other plans in mind. ""Homer's Enemy"" Homer trying his best to be friends and impress his new co-worker completely does the oppisite as Frank Grimes grows to hate everything about Homer until he snaps and loses it.

 There are many more great episodes in this 25 episode season. This is another great Season to grab if you plan on getting a few seasons only. (Or getting a few at the time! If you're like me and plan on owning all Simpsons seasons.) The Simpsons is a must own series to anyone who loves animated comedy!",1401408000,3,1862,4.681957186544342

2577403,5,B000FO0AME,"This review is not based on the series, but on the new packaging of the DVD sets. I had all the original releases of seasons 1-12 on DVD. The original packaging was pretty bad, the internal DVD holders were cheap plastic ones, only held into place by glue, which, eventually, they would come loose. The new ones are made of a stronger plastic. It's still held in with glue, but it seems like a stronger glue as well, but that's just the base of the internal holder, the rest snap into place and turn like the pages of a book.",1397347200,,525,4.26

2577407,4,B000FO0AME,"Most shows of this genre (irreverent poking fun at society in general) have a 'voice of reason' character (e.g., Bud on Married with Children, Darlene in Rosanne, Huey from Boondocks) built into the show.  Lisa seems to pulls it off well.  I typically avoid this genre because it is not my 'cup of tea.'  However, 25+ years says something, so I purchased the DVDs to see what America saw in this series.  I am gearing up for the South Park show.  LOL",1394496000,,450,4.439024390243903
2577408,5,B000FO0AME,"Quite simply, this was, to me, one of the funniest seasons of The Simpsons ever. My favorite episode, ""The Mysterious Voyage of Homer."" After a nasty encounter with Chief Wiggum's chili at the Springfield Chili Cook-off, Homer has a number of eerie, psychedelic visions which help lead him back to his one true love: Marge! Those Guatemalan Insanity Peppers are NOT to be taken lightly.",1394064000,4,386,4.953846153846154

2577412,5,B000FO0AME,This is the best season. We have the beer baron  and the 007 episode. Fond memories of just about all of the episodes. It starts out with the tree house of horror and continues to give you the best animated series of 1996/1997 all the way through.,1385942400,,247,4.25531914893617

""Bart After Dark""- a risque episode in which Bart works for a brothel, featuring one of the best songs
""Burn, Baby Burns""- Rodney Dangerfield voices Monty Burns' long-lost son
""The Mysterious Voyage of Homer""- an insanity pepper-induced hallucination causes Homer to question if Marge is his soul mate
""The Springfield Files""- featuring Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny in their famous X-Files crossover
""Homer's Phobia""- Zap! Zzzzaap!
""Homer Vs. The Eighteenth Amendment""- Homer becomes the ""Beer Baron"" after Springfield enacts Prohibition laws
""Homer's Enemy""- a great episode showing how a normal human, Frank Grimes, would handle someone as foolish as Homer

This season also includes some less than stellar episodes
""Treehouse of Horror VII""- Perhaps I've seen this one too much, but the evil twin Bart and Genesis tub don't make me laugh
""The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show""- the premise is very clever and I enjoy the way this episode pokes fun at itself and the viewers, but I really really hate Poochie
""The Simpsons Spin-off Showcase""- I detest any of the clips shows or shows like this.",1354060800,,1359,5.0625

Season 8 of the Simpsons is arguably the last truely great season. I personally enjoy seasons 9 and 10 as well but there is a slight decline following this one IMHO. To avoid going through every episode I'll just say if you're a fan, get it. I was going to rate this with four stars instead of five because I didn't receive an episode guide booklet, but this was a gift and I'm not 100% sure the buyer purchsed it from Amazon, besides I just wrote them all down on paper and put that in the sleeve where the booklet should go anyway.

This has the well deserved 'classic years' title because this season was before the show became mediocre, but still good. The momentum of the writing is still top notch here and only starts to waiver next season. I can't say that I would recommend ANY of the character head seaons because they don't stack well and are slightly less user friendly in getting the discs in/out IMO; however that's a personal choice and if it falls between one of these and not getting a season at all then get it! :)",1332979200,,680,4.3203125

And season 8 is, IMHO, the absolute best season of the Simpsons and one of the best TV seasons in history. My favorite episode of all time is in this season (""Homer's Enemy"", with the immortal Frank Grimes), and several of my top favorites are on here as well (most notably ""Hurricane Neddy"" and the Sherry Bobbins episode). Not every episode is a classic (""The Springfield Files"" and ""The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase"" really fall flat), but even these episodes really aren't that bad overall, especially in comparison to the stuff now (recent couple of seasons of ""Family Guy"", seasons 12-present of ""The Simpsons"", etc.).

2577432,5,B000FO0AME,"O-K, season 8 is a GREAT season- and although I was never one to care much about DVD extras, I have to say that I LOVE the commentaries on all Simpsons episodes. With other shows, if you listen to a commentary, you listen once and that's more than enough- but with the Simpsons, I enjoy the commentaries as much as the episodes, and, I can unashamedly say that I have listened to every commentary twice now, and will continue to listen to them every time I go through the series!. My one complaint is that on a few of this season's commentaries, one of the crew members brought his young children to the recording session.
  Now come on, who the heck wants to listen to some 5 year-old asking childish questions during a commentary which I'm sure is made for adults? Lets hope they never do that again. I love the commentaries, and I love the fact that there is a commentary for every episode....but please, keep the kids at home, guys. They may be cute to you, if you're their parent, but to viewers such as myself, they're just annoying and a waste of valuable time. Season 8 is one of the best seasons, in my opinions...but it is one of the worst as far as the commentaries go- between the kids at the commentary sessions, and Yeardley Smith on a lot of the commentaries (Hate to say it, but she is isn't very bright- and asks a lot of stupid questions) these commentaries just aren't of the same quality as are the ones on the other seasons. (Someone even had the gall to bring in a BABY while recording a commentary- luckily, they had the sense to remove it from the room early on.) I just don't know what some people are thinking. But despite these little annoyances, this is a great season and overall, I am still grateful for having commentaries on every episode!

2577436,5,B000FO0AME,"This season is almost the last of the really great ones. It features some of the funniest episodes I've ever sat through, not the least being a hillarious Treehouse of Horror. Particular favorites of mine include Lisa's Date with Density, wherein Lisa develops an unwanted crush on local bully Nelson Muntz, Hurricane Neddie, wherein the normally unflappable Ned Flanders loses his temper to a degree that makes his outburst in Homer loves Flanders seem quite tame, and The Springfield Files, featuring guest appearances by Leonard Nemoy as well as Molder and Skully from the X Files. And of course we can't forget The Mysterious Voyage of R. Homer, wherein Homer eats Guatemalan isanity peppers, has a fight with Marge and meets a strange coyote, voiced by the late Johnny Cash, who urges him to find his soulmate. Another favorite of mine is The Secret War of Lisa Simpson, where Bart pulls a majr prank on a tour of the police station and as punishment is sent to military school. Lisa, however, sees the potential challenges offered by such a life and decides to stay behind. All in all this season is one of my favorites. Aside from great episodes it features the usual audio commentary which, apart from being very insightful, is also more often than not quite funny. About the only down side is the fact that one of the writers occasionally felt the need to bring his kids into the studio with him. But since they didn't really disrupt things it's only a minor gripe of mine.

I resulted in watching the episodes that included Bart meeting his mad Siamese twin who is intent on sewing them together again, Homer causes a new person at his work to go mad and electrocute himself while saying ""What's this? Extremely high voltage? Well, I don't need safety gloves, because I'm Homer Simp-"", Milhouse's parents divorce, and so on. There are great songs in this such as ""The Spring in Springfield"", ""Happy Just the Way We Are"" and ""Minimum Wage Nanny"". I especially like the episode when Ned Flanders yells at Springfield and says a whole lot of mean things. He yells at Marge that her family's out of control, he gets mad at Bart, he says Lisa interrupts all the time, he says Krusty the Klown isn't funny.

The shows became, well, less smart.  Within less than one year, I had gone from not being able to miss an episode to not being able to watch at all.  The shows became painful reminders of what The Simpsons used to be.  The movie this summer was the same.  A painful reminder.  I always wondered if some key writers left after '96.  The hilarious timing and brilliant parody simply went away.  The funny thing to me is how many people keep watching and don't even notice any difference at all.",1199404800,17,669,4.264
2577448,5,B000FO0AME,"The eighth season of the Simpsons is the last season that is great from top to bottom.  Sure there are lots of great shows in later seasons, but there isn't a weak show in this entire year.  Critics (and the show's writers) have pondered about why the show is not as good now as then, and I think the answer is that the writers have had to go further and further afield to come up with new things for the Simpsons to do.  Some of the most recent shows are simply weird.  What makes the eighth season so compelling is that it's just at the start of this branching-out process: there are some ""weird"" shows, but they don't stray too far off the beaten path in terms of pop-culture references,  characterisations, etc.  Thus, many more of the background characters are brought to the fore: we see here for the first time the burgeoning romance between Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner, the divorce of the van Houtens, learn about Flander's parents (""lousy beatnicks!""), and meet the woman who is the voice of Itchy and Scratchy (and, incidentally, the Roadrunner).  Most importantly for the evolution of the show, we have ""The Simpsons Spinoff Showcase,"" a segment of which shows the Simpsons as a real family that plays The Simpsons family on TV, but who also have other interests (such as singing and dancing).

Of course, in this box set there are numerous little extras.  The menus have a number of humourous little vignettes, but they are easily skippable to prevent frustration with menu navigation.  Every episode has a commentary (as usual) but more of the guest stars and actors appear here.  The best guest commentators turn out to be Dan Thomas, the voice of Rex Banner (although the commentary does become a bit of a love-in for SCTV), and John Waters, the voice of John ""the Gay Man.""  Without giving an exhaustive list of episodes (which can be found elsewhere), it's difficult to cull the season down to the best episodes.  But I'll give it a try; my favourites are:

You Only Move Twice: ""For once in my life I'm good at my job!  My team is way ahead of the weather machine and germ warfare divisions.""  Homer gets a job as a mid-level manager at a nuclear power plant in Cypress Creek.  It turns out that it's run by a James Bond-esque supervillian intent on seizing the East Coast.  My second-favourite all-time Simpsons episode (after ""Last Exit to Springfield"").

Bart After Dark: ""I was only in there to ask directions about how to get out of there.""  In recovering a wayward model airplane, Bart accidently breaks a gargoyle on ""the creepy house.""  When Homer orders Bart to work off the debt, Bart discovers the creepy house is actually a Burlesque house.

The Springfield Files: ""This is the worst case we've ever investigated.""  A rare true ""crossover"" episode.  Mulder and Scully from the X-Files are called in to investigate Homer's supposed sighting of an alien.

Supercalifragilisticexpiala(annoyed grunt)cious: ""If you cut every corner it is really not so bad/ Everybody does it, even Mom and Dad/ If nobody sees it then nobody gets mad""  Marge hires a nanny.  An extended parody of (you guessed it!) Mary Poppins.

Brother From Another Series: ""Hydrological and hydrodynamical engineer?  Talk about running the gamut.""  Side Show Bob's brother (appropriately played by David Hyde Pierce) gives Bob a job and for once Bob tries to keep to the straight and narrow.

Homer vs. the 18th Ammendment. ""Here's to alcohol: the cause of, and solution to, all life's problems."" The temperance movement (led by Helen Lovejoy and Maude Flanders) dicovers the prohibition law in Springfield is still on the books.  Chief Wiggum is fired and replaced by Rex Banner (complete with fedora and tommy guns), while Homer becomes the city's lead bootlegger.

The Simpson's Spinoff Showcase: ""New Orleans is not really a party town, chief."" Troy McClure introduces us to three potential Simpsons spinoffs: Chief Wiggum and Principal Skinner as P.I.s in New Orleans, Moe in a supernatural sitcom with a haunted love tester, and a musical variety show like the Smothers Brothers or Carol Burnett show.",1190851200,,4110,4.842406876790831
2577449,4,B000FO0AME,"I want to start this review by making it clear that i'm a huge simpsons nerd and some of my complaints with this season are very specific and, lets be honest, a little unreasonable. But I'd bet if you're considering paying money to watch a tv show thats on tv for an hour strait 6 days a week, that you might be a pretty big fan too.

Yes, this season contains some heavy hitters like ""you only move twice""(hank scorpio etc) and ""homer vs the 18th amendment""(the beer baron et all) but there's also some filler episodes like ""my sister my sitter"" which winds up being mostly depressing and not so much funny. others, like the chili-pepper cook off episode start strong, but fizzle by act three. Season 8 is by no means the beginning of the end, its just hard to follow 4 years of brilliance.

This won't matter to most people, but the commentary on this season is extra-weak. I know its my fault for listening to simpson-commentary, but there are a couple episodes where someone brought their effing kids. they're constantly asking questions like ""why does he look like that"" and ""why did that happen"" which, after a moment of awkward silence are answered begrudgingly by groening and others with ""um...because its funny."" Everyone just seems a little less interested in watching the show and talking about them, and it winds up being contagious.

having made these minor complaints, i should mention how this show in its 8th season is better than 90% of tv shows in their 1st. This is still pretty great stuff, and there's a lot of good writing and nice animation in here. it just seems like they didn't push as hard here.",1190678400,4,1623,4.589655172413793

2577458,5,B000FO0AME,"Is there a better TV cartoon out there than the Simpsons?  Perhaps the better question would be is there a better TV show than the Simpsons.  Consistently well-written with a wide variety of characters and stories that transcend the merely sit-comic, the Simpsons is arguably one of the best TV shows ever.  The shame of it is that when it comes to awards, the Simpsons is not allowed to compete with live action shows, which actually may be just as well for the competition.  In around 18 years, it probably could have won a Best Comedy Emmy a dozen or more times if not for a general anti-cartoon bias.  The Season Eight collection - another five star set - would have one of those winners.  Among the 25 episodes, some of my favorites include:

You Only Move Twice:  Homer gets a new job with evil genius Hank Scorpio. Scorpio may want to conquer the world, but he's a great boss.  Ironically, this new perfect life doesn't agree with the rest of the family.  This is a perfect parody of James Bond films, twisted to make the bad guy seem like the hero; in the end, Scorpio outdoes folks like Goldfinger and Blofeld in villainy

El Viaje Misterioso De Nuestro Jomer:  Homer goes on a psychedelic trip after eating a Guatemalan insanity pepper.  This hallucinogenic journey leads Homer to search for his soul mate, culminating in near-disaster at a lighthouse.

Homer's Phobia:  When a new gay acquaintance becomes a role model for Bart, Homer panics (especially when Bart chooses a pink snowball over a cupcake).  His efforts to ""straighten"" out his son include a hunting trip and some interesting revelations about the steel industry.

Homer vs. the Eighteenth Amendment:  Homer becomes a bootlegger after booze is banned.  This episode shows Homer at his smartest, with a scheme so cunning even Marge approves.

The Old Man and Lisa:  When the evil Montgomery Burns goes broke, he turns to Lisa.  She helps him, but learns that Burns is so naturally sinister, even his attempts at benevolence are destructive.  This episode includes some delightful references to the old sit-com That Girl and the classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers.

In Marge We Trust:  This one is great not so much for the ""A"" story as the ""B"" story involving a Japanese detergent called Mr. Sparkle which has a logo resembling Homer.

Homer's Enemy:  This is probably the most darkly humorous episode ever.  New power plant employee Frank Grimes is a hard worker who has struggled his entire life; he naturally resents Homer's success through pure laziness.  His anger will eventually fester into a plot for revenge.

The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase: This episode offers three previews of alleged spin-offs, all of which are wonderful genre parodies, including spoofs on crime dramas, situation comedies and variety shows.

And these are only a fraction of the episodes, all of which are great.  In addition, there are wonderful commentaries on all the episodes (including some interesting guest commentators), plenty of deleted scenes and a little bit of behind-the-scenes stuff.  Even if you catch these episodes on regular TV (where they are often edited for syndication), it's better to watch them on DVD.",1170547200,5,3187,4.908239700374532
2577459,2,B000FO0AME,"I don't know if THE SIMPSONS have worn out their welcome, but if they have, this is the season when American viewers began glancing at their watches. In fact, one episode, ""The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show,"" lampoons the series itself by suggesting that something must be done to keep it fresh and as entertaining as seasons three through six. There are few genuinely funny episodes this time around.

Something that REALLY irks me is the terrible packaging for this season. I know this is a superficial thing to criticize, but the DVD-plates easily come unglued from the packaging (what a stupid idea to GLUE them), and it's difficult to straighten them out because of the glue. If it's not done properly, you can't slide the folding set back into its sleeve. It's just sort of a headache.

2577462,5,B000FO0AME,"How to describe a cultural phenomenon like the Simpsons?

The show speaks for itself and its 18 seasons' worth of success with tons of jokes, satirical moments and good storytelling. This review concerns the DVD for the 8th Season.

To put it simply, this is the best DVD ever produced for a season of any television show. The effort put into this product is unbelievable.

The package in the shape of Maggie's head is beautiful and easy to handle. Despite complaints from many people over the lack of consistency with previous sets and their inability to handle these head packages, I've been completely satisfied with them.

As for the discs themselves, they keep the menu system used in the 3 previous seasons. They're easy to navigate and are a visual delight for any fan.

I was able to uncover some easter eggs within these menus and unlocked a few extra deleted scenes from certain episodes. This is why I love the DVD format. There's always a new surprise programmed into these amazing discs.

The episodes themselves are the same ones I had the pleasure to watch nearly 10 years ago. They've aged well. The stories represent some of the most creative and inspiring moments in the series.

Alf Clausen's music is amazingly phenomenal and fits every single scene, especially in episodes like Hurricane Neddy and Mountain of Madness (two of my all-time favorite episodes simply because of the way the music helps to tell the story).

By this season, the animation has hit its stride and will continue to be like this for the remainder of the series. And it looks brilliant on DVD. The colors are vibrant, the sharpness is amazing. The picture looks crystal clear, with the exception of some minor scenes in a few episodes. It's nearly perfect.

I have to applaud the sound mixing on this DVD. The 5.1 Dolby Digital surround sound brings a whole new experience for episodes that are so old. I recall Homer speaking through the rear speakers when he was off-screen. There was great use of gunfire sound in The Secret War of Lisa Simpson. Explosions really rocked the subwoofer and cars crossed the living room.

The sound isn't motion picture quality, but it's a real surprise for a cartoon TV series that's not even action-oriented.

As for the extras, that's what makes the DVD set so worth it. There are about 20 minutes worth of deleted scenes (not counting the easter eggs) with optional commentary from the producers.

And the DVD commentaries are the number one reason I buy the Simpsons DVDs. Matt Groening is a delight to listen every time. He always puts up a show, trying to make the viewer's listening experience as entertaining as it can be.

Executive producer Josh Weinstein is another terrific presence in these commentaries. He's a guy I can identify with. He views the Simpsons a lot like the way I view it. It's really sad that this was his last season as a show runner and head writer. I'll miss his presence and Bill Oakley's as well.

Yeardley Smith sounds like the sweetest person that I could ever hope to meet. The person behind Lisa's voice has an enormous passion and attachment to Lisa's character. She's the one voiceover actress who really voices her opinion in these commentaries and is always eager to ask questions that a fan like myself would normally ask. She seems to really enjoy the show and be a part of it. I'm glad I get to hear her input in these commentaries. I hope I get to hear many more of them on future DVD sets.

The writers and directors really add a lot of depth and content to these commentaries as well. People like Ian Maxtone-Graham, Dan Greaney, Donick Cary, Mark Kirkland and Steven Dean Moore really make these commentaries lively.

George Meyer, Ken Keeler and David X Cohen are favorites of mine. They always make me laugh.

The animation showcases are a whole side show worth viewing. Seeing Matt Groening alongside directors Susie Dietter, Mike B Anderson and Bob Anderson attempting to draw the characters on the screen always makes me laugh. I loved the way the directors taught Matt how to better draw the Simpsons during this session.

I was impressed that some guest stars appeared in these commentaries. I'm a huge fan of John Waters and Dave Thomas. It was an added bonus to have them participating.

In short, this a gem of a DVD. The episodes are some of the best in the series and the extras more than live up to the material. This was the best investment I've made in a DVD purchase.",1168300800,,4461,4.674329501915709

Episodes are filled with hilarity, and as always, the DVDs are packed with extra features, including deleted scenes, commentaries on all episodes, animatics, bits from the animators, additional languages, and even a look at the real-life Simpsons house that was built and auctioned (or raffled?) off!

Here is a brief listing of my favourite episodes of this season:

Treehouse of Horror VII: Always enjoyable! This one includes Bart's evil twin brother, Lisa's miniature world (she is God, Bart is the devil), and Kang and Qodos running for US President against each other.

You Only Move Twice: Perhaps one of my top 3 episodes of all time! Homer gets a job at which he is unknowingly helping a super villain in his quest for world domination.

The Homer They Fall: When he finds out Homer can take a punch, Moe manages him all the way into a fight with Drederick Tatum (Mike Tyson look-alike).

A Milhouse Divided: After Milhouse's parents get a divorce, Homer works extra-hard to ensure his marriage with Marge remains strong.

Hurricane Neddy: A hurricane hits Springfield, but the only victim is the Flanders family. Ned goes insane when the town rebuilds his home so shabbily it falls apart, and winds up in an asylum.

The Mysterious Voyage of Homer: Homer eats too many insanity peppers at a chili cook-off, and hallucinates that he needs to find his soul mate.

The Springfield Files: Agents Scully and Mulder (of X-Files fame) come investigate alien sightings by Homer.

The Twisted World of Marge Simpson: Marge starts a pretzel business, but Homer looks to the mob for assistance when business is slow. One of the best endings ever!

Homer's Phobia: After befriending a collectibles merchant, who happens to be gay, Homer worries that Bart might ""sway the other way,"" too!

Brother From Another Series: One of the great Sideshow Bob episodes, featuring David Hyde Pierce (from Frasier) as Bob's entrepreneurial brother who gives him a job building a dam.

Homer Vs. The Eighteenth Amendment: Homer starts a bootlegging business when alcohol is banned in Springfield.

In Marge We Trust: Marge helps out at church when Reverend Lovejoy gets burned out. Amazing subplot featuring Homer discovering his face on a Japanese dishwashing product.

Homer's Enemy: Homer's new co-worker is the only person who cannot handle his incompetence. Hank Azaria's rendering of type-A Frank Grimes is brilliant!

This is just a taste of what Season 8 has to offer. I highly recommend this set to all fans of the show - it is not long until episode quality decreases. Buy this one today!

2577484,5,B000FO0AME,"The Simpsons seasons 5-8 are the best example of what DVDs should be. The menu animations provide just a taste of new content while celebrating the most memorable episodes and characters of this season. Many episodes here are some of my favorites, Mr. Sparkle, Marge's Pretzel Wagon, Hank Scorpio, Lisa's tub of tiny people, Homer and Burns trapped in remote mountain cabin (and going mad with cabin fever in minutes). These were the episodes on air as I was coming of age. At a risk of sounding too heavy these episodes defined my adolescence and taught me to try to find the humor in almost any situation. I think I am a better man for having watched them during such a turbulent time in my life. Enough with the heavy stuff, on to the special features.

On this set, the special features aren't so special. A short clip of the Simpson's (real-life) house doesn't include a walk through. Many of the ""special features,"" are short, 15 second self-promotional commercials. Matt Greoning's Introduction is nice and would be missed if excluded, but is interesting only once. The Animation Showcase is a fun, indebt look at a particular scene from an episode. The show's creators pause, rewind and slow-mo the video to reveal animation flaws and interesting details. They also provide insight into filmmaking with animation. However, the animators sometimes get distracted by the telistrator, signing their names during their introduction, and drawing pictures of unrelated characters on screen. I would like to see more deconstruction and less diversion by the creators. Indispensable though, are the commentaries. I can't prase them enough. Listening to them all, I got a real sense of connection with the show's creators.

One last thing. I want to thank the Graphic/Product Designer(s) for doing such a good job with the box art, disc art, menu art, and the included booklet. The theme of a family photo album is done very well. If there were awards for such art, I would highly recommend they win. The discs themselves are kept in easy-to-access ""album style"" disc holders. This keeps all the discs together and continues the ""album"" theme, but I'd like to see future Simpsons DVDs in individual slim cases like the Futurama DVDs.

Bottom line: Buy this set for the episodes and commentaries alone.

On a side note, if you're the kind of person who can use a credit card responsibly, I highly recommend the Amazon Visa. The rewards point never expire, and every $2500 charged to the card equals a $25 Amazon gift certificate. I average one gift certificate every four months.

It was in the emergency clinic in the episode ""My Sister, My Sitter"" where the scene pans around showing the patients.  Smithers appears holding an empty gerbil cage and is the only patient not sitting down.  When I first saw that, many years ago, I literally rolled off of the couch with laughter as my wife stared at me like I needed a padded room.  She didn't even understand the joke when I explained it as an alternate lifestyle practice of ""hiding"" the rodent so as to make sitting down more than a little uncomfortable.  This DVD cut has been cut and makes Smithers reply about not letting Lisa ahead of him make no sense.  One of my favorite things about the Simpsons was that they didn't care who they offended.

2577491,5,B000FO0AME,"While it's easy to criticize the latest seasons, there was always a few bright spots but they were usually far and between. Season 8 is probably one of the last seasons to offer a consistently funny season. With some hiliarious moments, memorable lines, and even some atypical episodes, season 8 is quite funny when it needs to be. This includes disc highlights.

Official season premiere You Only Live Twice(the Halloween episode aired first) has the family move out of Springfield where Homer unknowingly gets a job with a supervillain. Bart gets a job in a burlesque house with reluctantly infuriates the town in Bart After Dark. Milhouse's parents divorce and it oddly becomes a Simpson marriage in trouble episode in Milhouse Divided.

Lisa's Date with Density has Lisa unexpectedly falling for Nelson Muntz and realizing people don't change. Le Viaje Misterio de Nuestro Jomer has Homer eat really hot peppers and going on a mind-bending trip to find his soulmate. The Springfield Files sees a crossover with the X-Files when Mulder and Scully investigate Homer's claim he saw an alien.

A clever episode where network executives had a cool hip character in the Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show. Note: this episode made the Simpsons the longest running primetime show passing the Flintstones. Another clever and well-handed episode has John Waters, arguably one of the better guest stars, as a gay man that seriously offends Homer. Homer vs the Eighteenth Amendment has Homer illegally providing Springfield of liquor which has been banned. ""Alcohol, the cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems"".

The Old Man and the Lisa finds Burns' bankrupt and trying to get his money back with the help of Lisa. Homer's Enemy sees Frank Grimes, hard worker but underachiever, noticing he's the only one that has a problem with Homer's life. Commentary was right: many hate it yet now a lot of people like it. The Secret War of Lisa Simpson has Bart achieving success in military school while Lisa is getting nowhere. One of my more favorite Lisa lines: Bart: ""Um, you can put your hands down now"" Lisa: ""I can't, they're stuck!""

Many fans favorite episode moments are found within this set such as Homer's trip involing a coyote voiced by Johnny Cash, probably the most hilarious Japanese commercial I've ever seen in In Marge We Trust and the introduction and exit of Poochie. However, I don't know what it is but some episodes seem almost unfinished. The pepper episode has great first 2 acts but the third seems to not fit, same with Springfield Files then we get some merely ok episodes such as Canine Mutiny or My Sister, My Sitter.

A weird note about the packaging: even though it finally corrects the odd head packaging of season 6 and the excessive cases from 7, the side label doesn't match the others. Again, it's a very minor nitpick but it seems so easy to get right.

That being said, those who were fans from the show's inception will still find a lot to like in this package.  As a series the show went through the David Mirkin zany years settled in Oakley and Weinstein pathos-filled, flashback and fantasy free, character driven stories.  While these techniques get stretched to the breaking point (it seems like a new backstory is introduced every episode) the episodes are satisfying in a low-key, season 3 kind of way. The commentary is stellar and informative, as Oakley and Weinstein -- former Simpsons nerds themselves -- have some idea of what fans want to hear about. Although I don't think we're ever going to get a collection of the Tracy Ullman shorts.  As to what went wrong with the show from here on out?  Your guess is as good as mine, but it's quite clear in commentary for ""The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show"" that the writers doth protest too much, as there is a palpable feeling throughout the commentaries that the show was running low on gas.

2577497,2,B000FO0AME,"Like several of us, I too see season 8 as the beginning of the end. There are some high watermarks here too - Marge as the listen-lady, Burns and Lisa recycling, Frank Grimes, and so forth.

What brings the season down (for me) is too much focus on one story line. Example: The episode with Marge as the listen lady covers several hilarious events in one show - Homer finding the soap box, the video tape content sent to Homer, the Reverend's first encounter with Ned, Ned's encounter with the slacking teens, and the boring church sermons. Brilliant, and one of the trademarks of almost all the classic episodes.

Then there is the overall humor. The spin-off episode where Wiggum moves to New Orleans is almost too tedius to watch. Where the classic episodes brim with absurdity, this one is void of cyncial wit and sight gags.

I have not watched much of the later episodes, so I cannot say this is the last good season, but what I have seen makes me wonder if season 9 or 10 will be the end of the line for me.",1156377600,8,1014,4.382978723404255

RE: the rest of this garbage -- if The Simpsons were not worth watching after season 8, what the hell was better that WAS worth watching on TV in the last 10 years? The Simpsons has been the best show on TV ever since it debuted. The people that are so dismisive of the last 10 years have not learned from the show that they should not aspire to follow in the footsteps of Comic Book Guy. They also are apparently too stupid to get the message of ""Itchy & Scratchy & Poochy"" in this DVD set. It takes no talent, intelligence or wit to be a snob -- those things ARE required to make The Simpsons.",1156118400,9,650,4.007692307692308
2577499,3,B000FO0AME,Has anyone had any problems with the animator's commentary in the special section on disc one?  I bought the Maggie Simpson head box set and found that the commentary skips through this section.  I initially thought it was a bad disc so I got an exchange for a different set and its happened again in the replaced box set.  I tried playing it on my laptop dvd player and it would not play though that section!  So I am wondering if its a problem with the batch that was released.  Would love to know if the said same problem occurs in the disc one of the regular box set.  I sent a query to Fox but have not heard back from them as of 082106.  Would hope to hear from others who have purchased this disc set.,1156118400,4,708,4.124087591240876

You get plenty of hilarious and witty 1-liners, items from old episodes that you won't catch the first time you see them (see Homer's Phobia), Mr. Burns' son, a different Lisa, and many other things.

2577503,5,B000FO0AME,"Simpsons fanatics can once again spend several months wallowing ecstatically in a season boxed set, but this Eighth season heralded the end of the show's golden age. This year's episodes are still predominantly brilliant, but there are growing signs that the writing supervisors were running out of new ideas; while major character development nearly screeches to a halt, at least for the main family members. Speaking of character development, there are actually some crucial revelations this year for some of the supporting characters, particularly Ned Flanders in ""Hurricane Neddy"" the Van Houtens in ""A Milhouse Divided,"" and Mr. Burns in ""The Old Man and the Lisa."" But unfortunately the main characters seem to be going around in circles as far as their life experiences are concerned, which would be a severe problem in the series for the next several seasons.

Some examples include very un-Lisa-like behavior in ""Lisa's Date with Density,"" Marge trying on new occupations in ""The Twisted World..."" and ""In Marge We Trust"" which are never mentioned again, and Homer getting into new situations that go absolutely nowhere series-wise, such as boxing in ""The Homer They Fall."" From a writing standpoint, the secondary subplots are starting to become detached from the main plotlines, with several instances this season of the two failing to integrate. New characters such as Frank Grimes, Belle, and Larry Burns come and go without making any significant impact on the series. The TV crossover episode (""The Springfield Files"") is downright lazy from a series development standpoint; while this season contains the first ever Simpsons episode that is an out-and-out failure, as the attempted spoof of Mary Poppins in ""Simpsoncalifragi..."" was by far the team's worst decision to date.

Okay, that's all the negativity from the Eighth season. So why does the season DVD set still warrant five stars? Because those particular problematic episodes are more than made up for by some of the most brilliant and hilarious episodes ever, as this season still builds on the vast strengths of the golden age, while merely showing a few troubling signs of the upcoming writing slump. Although Lisa was previously mentioned as suffering from one sub-par episode, she actually shines through luminously in this season's most hysterical and hard-hitting stories, including ""The Secret War of Lisa Simpson,"" and especially the extra uproarious ""My Sister, My Sitter."" The development team also tackled some of their most important adult issues yet in ""Grade School Confidential"" and the crucial ""Homer's Phobia."" So while the Eighth season showed some seriously looming storm clouds of future mediocrity, it is still a mostly brilliant continuation of the show's tradition of genius. Relish this set fully before the DVDs for the truly troublesome seasons start to come down the pike. [~doomsdayer520~]",1155945600,5,2893,5.314410480349345
2577504,5,B000FO0AME,"This season of The Simpsons includes some wonderful episodes. Some of them include ""You Only Move Twice"", where Homer moves to a seemingly perfect community to work at a major corporation, ""The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show"", where Homer becomes the voice of a new character for Itchy and Scratchy and my personal favorite, ""Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiali(annoyed grunt)cious"", where the family hires a Mary Poppins-esque nanny.

There are some other fine episodes, such as ""Burns Baby Burns"", which features Rodney Dangerfield as Mr. Burns' long lost (highly lazy) son among others.

However I would like to plead, if possible for MORE sets per year. At this rate (2 per year), The Simpsons DVD's will not be caught up with what's current on TV until season 25 in 2014!!! (If the show lasts that long). Maybe Matt was right. In his 1st season DVD letter, it was his hope that ALL The Simpsons episodes would be on DVD, just the technology was becoming obsolete, if so this is a cruel cruel joke! I know they show creators are very busy now with the movie, and still making new episodes AND new Futurama, but I don't think 4 sets per year (1 every 3 months), is asking too much.

However, season 8 is the peak of the glorious Simpsons mountain. From season 3 to here it was all uphill. Simply amazing television.

After this season, its majesty fell a few notches (though the 9th season was pretty darn good as well).

This season contains the Lisa dentist episode (""The Big Book of British Teeth""), Hank Scorpio terrorist episode (""That's over in the hamock district, of course""), Ned's beatnick parents episode (""We haven't tried anything and we're all out of ideas!""), Frank ""Grimey"" Grimes and so many other classics.

2577507,5,B000FO0AME,"I looked forward to buying the next released season of The Simpsons on DVD every year, however, getting season eight this year is going to be a bittersweet occasion.  Of course, I add yet another solid gold season of The Simpsons to my collection, but this in turn will result in the end of my Simpsons collection.  Yes, like many other reviewers of this DVD set on Amazon, I share the same sentiment that this is the last season worth buying.  From season 9 and onward, the show grew progressively worse in the long run, and lost what made it worth watching in the first place.

Basically, this is the last season of The Simpsons that retained its witty sense of humor, and didn't resort to outlandish storylines and throwing in celebrity guest stars week after week.  Episodes like ""You Only Move Twice"" (I love the 007 scene), ""A Milhouse Divided"", ""The Twisted World Of Marge Simpson"", Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(ANNOYED GRUNT)cious"", ""The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show"", ""Homer's Phobia"", and the classic ""Homer's Enemy"" exudes the shows last ounces of genius from script to screen.  The storylines of these episodes are enjoyable, and captivating from start to finish.  The witty humor of the past seasons is well retained in season eight with many side splitting moments of hillarity to prove it.  In addition, season eight showcases further development of favorite characters, as well as the introduction of unforgettable new favorites like Frank Grimes and Poochie.

Truly, Season 8 is indeed the end of an era of what was the most brilliantly inventive series on television.  Fortunately, it will live infinitely on DVD to be respected and enjoyed by core fans and casual viewers alike.",1155686400,33,1701,4.978798586572438

Yesterday, I ran right out and bought it on the first day of its release and it was worth all the aggravation on my lunch hour to get it. Some of the best episodes are in this season, like the one with the insanity peppers...""Find your soulmate, Homer."" Or the one where Ned Flander's house gets destroyed by the hurricane. Or the one where Marge gets the pretzel franchise. Or when Homer thinks he's seen an alien but it's really Mr. Burns hopped up on ether. All of them are fabulous. There are about 20 minutes of deleted scenes included in this season, which I believe is the most they've ever included so far. They also have a nice featurette about the real Simpsons house they built in Nevada. Very cool stuff. If you call yourself a fan of the show, you'd better go get this one quick. I got mine at Target and they're releasing it for $29.99 which is an outstanding price. Honestly, I'd pay any amount for it even if it meant depleting my bank account. It's SO worth it!

Maybe I'm an old fuddy dutty but after this season, I lost interest in the show as the writing went downhill and it suffered from a severe case of Lucasism (as in George)...that is, it no longer served the interests or sensibilities of the people (the now twenty/thirty-somethings) who made it popular but began prostituting itself to a younger generation with more simplistic, less obscure, fart joke-esque humor as Lucas did with his updated approach to the Star Wars prequals.

2577516,5,B000FO0AME,"All those saying that this is the last great season: time to put the crack pipe down.  The very first episode of season 9, ""Homer v. NY,"" is on the short list of Greatest Ever.  When confronted with a choice between (ick) Mt. Dew and Crab Juice, Homer chooses.... duh, crab juice.  The range of seasons from 6-10 was probably the peak of the show.  We watch the Simpsons for one reason: laughs.  If you were traumatized by the Van Houten's divorce, you're probably taking it a little too seriously.  The whole point of the show is that it reflects real life, and even the tragic elements, with humor.  Also, I have a hard time following how a couple of 45 second cameos can supposedly ruin a previously great series.  Think about ""Homer at the Bat,"" also on the short list of greatest ever.  That episode was MADE by the cameos.  The 6-10 range is great because the jokes come faster than in previous seasons, and the writing is still sharp.  I will admit there was a decline around seasons 12-13.  I suspect a lot of those reviewers who say that this is the last good/great season gave up on it around then and haven't been watching lately.  It is coming back in a big way to reward us true believers.  The difference may well be Bill Odenkirk, whom any Mr. SHow fan will recognize has funny genes (He also wrote for the show in which his brother starred). Personally, back in the 12-14 range, there were isolated episodes, sometimes even 3 or 4 in a row, which had me close to giving up on the show.  But even in the worst Simpsons season there would be a show that would pop up to restore my faith for another week.  Lastly, I can't seem to wrap my mind around how it is that this Family Guy discussion keeps cropping up.  FG is not and will never be in the same league as the SImpsons.  The difference: While the SImpsons may have some ""wacky"" plotlines, they have plotlines.  Not just a string of jokes.  If you think ""more scatalogical"" means ""more funny,"" then Family Guy is for you.  If you think that assessment exposes me as a prude, you're way off.  WHen I want scatological, I'll turn to South Park.  It is bawdier, sharper, smarter, and A LOT funnier than FG, including (like the SImpsons) biting social commentary.  It is very topical, and far exceeds both Fox shows in terms of currency.  In the interest of full disclosure, I first turned against FG when I saw them blatantly plagiarize the Simpsons.  It's happened more than once, but the particularly egregious example which comes to mind is when the family went to the dog track, and the dog (a la Santa's Little Helper) ran out into the race and mated with one of the participants.  I know I shouldn't have been surprised, since the whole family dynamic was basically taken from the Simpsons, only the characters have much less depth.  Anywho... What was I reviewing?  Oh yeah, Simpsons Season 8.  What are you waiting for?  Buy it right this minute, or regret it for the remainder of your cursed days.  Hold on... Pat Robertson just announced on 700 club that if 1 million copies of the Simpsons are sold in the next month, God will spare America from a natural disaster or a terrorist attack or something; I wasn't really listening...",1155081600,16,3206,4.4835924006908465

It had a few down years, but has, IMO, returned to greatness the last two seasons.  I think the return of Family Guy has motivated The Simpsons cast and writers to be at their best.  And they have been.  Make sure you check out Season 8 when it comes out.  The way I look at it, even during the quote-unquote ""bad"" seasons you'll still have the commentary on each episode to listen to, so it will still be easily worth the price.

Also, I think that buying the Maggie head edition is better, just because it is different and I like it.

Second, I do wish that these would be released 3 seasons per year. I mean if star trek can release 7 seasons in a year for 100 bucks each and sell tons of copys, why not 3 seasons at 35 bucks?

Third, why in the world are you people bad mouthing seasons 9 and after.  The first episode in season 9 is awsome (

The City of New York vs. Homer Simpson) I mean, who fights a car boot!?!?!

In season 9 we find out that Skinner's an impostor, how lisa got her saxophone, Homer purchase a handgun and destroy his home, Homer coach bart's pee-wee football team and cut Bart, Apu married Marge, Lisa finds the ""angel"", Marge becomes a real estate agent, Bart accidentally burns the family's Christmas presents, carnies lock the family out of their house and claim it as their own, Lisa and their classmates fight for survival after becoming stranded on a deserted island (can we say Lord of the Flies?).

Also Homer tries an illegal automobile insurance fraud with Moe, Homer joins the Navy, Homer works for the IRS to retrieve a trillion dollar bill stolen by Mr. Burns, Homer gets a helper monkey to loot donut shops, Homer enters the race for sanitation commissioner (I love the song here ""the garbage man can"" that is stolen from willy wonka), Bart glues novelty items to his face, Bart and Lisa find the lost ending to Casablanca, and last but not least, Homer and Marge are caught making babies in a football stadium.

Oh did I mention Treehouse of Horror VIII where Homer battles killer mutants, Bart melds with a housefly and Marge is accused of witchcraft during colonial times.

The ""Treehouse of Horror"" episode this season was a standout as well, as Bart learns of his evil twin brother, Lisa creates miniature life, and the presidential race between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole gets interupted by Kang and Kodos.  All in all, season eight of the Simpsons is yet another superbly done collection of animated comedy with guest voices aplenty (including Willem Dafoe, John Waters, and Rodney Dangerfield), and like the previous seasons before it, managed to be hilarious without being vulgar, and more than memorable as well.",1151798400,18,1758,5.030927835051546

Everyone else is probably listing every episode in the season. (As is the trend with Simpsons fans on Amazon) So, I'll just say that this season is WELL worth the money. In my own oppinion, it's the best season to buy, containing some of the best episodes ever produced.

Beware, however, season nine doesn't hold to the same standard... and it only goes downhill from there. The next season contains the poverbial shark the writers happily jumped in favor of celebrity cameos and wild story lines. (Yes, even in Simpsons standards.)",1151452800,9,663,4.756521739130434

I already know what season 9 is going to shape like with Lisa's head and season 10 will have Bart's head shape.

For all you hardcore simpsons fans, y'all will really want to keep this in mind, The Simpsons movie will come out July 27, 2007 on the big screen.",1150502400,4,528,4.116504854368932
2577527,5,B000FO0AME,"Season 8 may be the last above average season of The Simpsons.  It would not be long after this season when I stopped enjoying The Simpsons as much.  Their story lines became increasingly over-the-top and the shows were often to intent on focusing on the celebrity of the week.  This season starts to go in that direction with some way-out episodes, but is not quite there yet. Season 7 is my favorite but Season 8 has many gems including ""The Homer They Fall,"" ""Burns, Baby Burns,"" ""Lisa's Date with Density,"" ""Hurricane Neddy,"" ""Homer Vs. The Eighteenth Amendment,"" and ""In Marge We Trust.""

""Treehouse of Horror VII"":  (a) The Thing and I:  Bart finds out he has an evil Siamese brother Hugo; (b) The Genesis Tub: Lisa conducts experiments with her fallen baby tooth and creates a mini society.  When she is zapped into miniature size, she warns the little society against the ""Dark One"" (Bart); (c)  Kang and Kodos come to earth posed as Bob Dole and Bill Clinton.  Of course, with the two-party system, one of them has to win.

""You Only Move Twice"":  Homer begins working for Hank Scorpio who is a pleasant and fun boss despite his plans for global terrorism and extortion.

""The Homer They Fall"":  Homer becomes a boxer with Moe as his manager.  All goes well until he has to fight Drederick Tatum.  Great Mike Tyson and Don King characters.

""Burn, Baby Burns"":  Mr. Burns finds out he has a long-lost son (voiced by Rodney Dangerfield) who becomes bosom buds with Homer.  Love the line: ""This place is emptier than a Scottish pay toilet.""

""Bart After Dark"":  After Bart damages property at an spooky old house, Homer forces Bart to work at the house which turns out to be a burlesque house.

""A Milhouse Divided"":  Milhouse's parents get divorced and his dad decides to becomes a [bad] singer.

""Lisa's Date with Density"":  Lisa develops a crush on bully Nelson Muntz and thinks she can change him.  I love the scene where Nelson throws a rock at a window and tries to tell Lisa the cops are chasing him and he needs a hideout only to have Homer open the window to tell him Lisa's room is the next window over.  I also love the auto-dialer sub-story.

""Hurricane Neddy"":  One of my all-time favorites.  Ned Flanders's house is the only one destroyed in a hurricane and he begins to question his faith.  In a flashback, we find out how he started saying doodily, diddily, as a why to hold in rage.

""The Mysterious Voyage of Homer"":  This is a weird one.  Homer eats a bad pepper at a chili cook-off and hallucinates about a coyote who urges Homer to find his soul mate.

""The Springfield Files:"" X-Files take-off.

""The Twisted World of Marge Simpson"": After being booted out of the Investorettes club for being too conservative, Marge buys a pretzel franchise but keeps hitting stumbling blocks to success.  Homer decides to recruit the services of Fat Tony.

""Mountain of Madness"":  This one is also a little odd.  During a survival retreat for the nuclear power plant, Mr. Burns and Homer are snowed-into a cabin and eventually start hallucinating.

""Simpsoncalifragilisticexpiala(""doh!"")cious"":  The Simpsons need a nanny and hire Mary Pop..,uh,...Shary Bobbins.

""The Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie Show"":  Homer becomes the voice of a new cartoon character who doesn't go over very well.

""Homer's Phobia"":  Homer meets a funny guy who runs a collectible shop ""Cockamamies"" (gotta love that name) named John and is shocked when he discovers John, uh, prefers the company of men.  Worst of all, Homer thinks John is influencing Bart.

""Brother From Another Series"": (Great title).  Sideshow Bob is released from prison and joins forces with his brother Cecil (voiced by David Hyde Pierce, of course, Sideshow Bob is voiced by Kelsey Grammer--get the title?).  Could Bob actually be the good guy in this episode???

""My Sister, My Sitter"":  Lisa becomes Bart's baby sitter and Lisa is afraid she's killed her brother after knocking him down the stairs.  This one is a little over-the-top.

""Homer Vs. The Eighteenth Amendment"":  One of my all-time favorites!  Prohibition starts up again in Springfield and Homer assists Moe in creating a speakeasy.  Can Homer out-fox Rex Banner?

""Grade School Confidential"":  Principal Skinner and Mrs. Krabappel start a romance and create controversy at Springfield Elementary.  The Skinner is a virgin thing was a little much.

""The Canine Mutiny"":  Bart gets hold of a fake credit card and buys all kinds of stuff including a pedigree collie, Laddie.  When repo-men come to collect the stuff, Bart gives them Santa's Little Helper instead of Laddie and soon regrets the decision.

""The Old Man and the Lisa"": Mr. Burns, who's recently lost his fortune, joins forces with Lisa to create a recycling plant.  Of course, Mr. Burns could never turn this plant into an evil operation...yeah, right!  I love Moe's line about the ""Little Lisa"" logo:  ""Ah, isn't that cute.  It makes Little Debbie look like a pile of puke.""

""In Marge We Trust"":  Marge becomes the ""Listen Lady"" and burned-out Mr. Lovejoy is worried she has become more popular than him with his flock.

""Homer's Enemy"":  Frank Grimes is the new employee at the nuclear power plant and, unlike everyone else, he doesn't accept Homer's incompetence.  A very dark episode.

""The Simpsons Spin-off Showcase"":  A 1970s-style variety show take-off of The Brady Bunch.  Just as Jan refused to participate, Lisa is replaced by an actress who looks just like her...yeah, right!

""The Secret War of Lisa Simpson"":  Bart is forced to enlist in military school and, impressed by the discipline which seems odd since Lisa is such a free thinker that one would not think she'd be attracted to the unquestioning soldier's life,  she decides to join, too.  And all the boys accept her...uh, no.",1150243200,277,5791,4.8594871794871795

2577530,4,B000FO0AME,"By 1997 The Simpsons was now on a visible decline in consistent quality. There are still some classic episodes on this collection, but this is definitely a point in Simpsons history where you can say an entire season went from being ""essential"" to just ""good"". Like anything in the entertainment medium, nothing can last forever, and The Simpsons is not excluded. Any longtime fan will usually recognize the show's ""glory days"" as the span of episodes from 1990-1994 when the pop culture references were sharply relevant, but the laughs certainly don't end there. There are, of course, plenty of worthy episodes in this collection, which will no doubt be picked up by fans everywhere (myself included).

There are still enough classic moments to overlook the more saturated, modern direction taken by many of the episodes, and that being said this is an excellent addition to any fan's DVD collection.",1149465600,25,901,5.046979865771812
2577531,5,B000FO0AME,"Episodes of The Simpsons in season 8 were still remarkably fresh, funny and for the most part full of that razor-edged dark humor prevalent in anything developed by ""Life In Hell"" cartoonist Matt Groening. In episodes like ""Homer's Enemy,"" ""The Simpsons Spin-off Showcase,"" ""A Milhouse Divided"" and many more you'll see why The Simpsons in its eighth season was the funniest satire on the sad state of the human condition to be found anywhere. Most of these episodes are extremely joke-dense and hilarious; it will take several viewings to catch all the humor packed into each 22-minute episode and with many a ""freeze frame"" gag in some of them (jokes that can only be clearly seen by freezing the picture) you'll be reaching for the remote occasionally to be sure you get every laugh available out of this set.

This set is 550 minutes long and includes all 25 episodes from season 8. It will be offered in a standard box and in a collectible ""Maggie head"" package. As usual, extra features are numerous and include commentary tracks, extra footage, deleted scenes, illustrated commentary, animation showcases, promotional spots featuring Matt Groening, and more.

Even during the worst season of the show, 11, there's still a couple of gems.",1148860800,7,405,4.342105263157895
2577534,5,B000FO0AME,"Keep in mind that a bad Simpsons episode is still better than 99% of the other shows on TV.  This season has some instant classics, including my favorite Simpsons episode with Sherry Bobbins, who is NOT Mary Poppins but original like Ricky Rouse and Monald Muck.

It also feature one of my favorite little bits where Homer, trying to prevent Bart from going gay, takes his son to a gay steel meal.  Everytime I hear ""We work hard, we play hard"" I remember this scene and laugh for 20 minutes.

Where do I end?  Homer becomes the Beer Baron, Super Villian for Scorpio, a Boxer, Poochie, and befrinds Frank Grimes.  Marge starts a pretzel chain and becomes the listen lady. Principal Skinner and Mrs Krabapple fall in love.  Chief Wiggum and Moe get their own shows, and everybody except Lisa gets a family-hour show.  Bart works at a naughty house and gets his own credit card.  The Van Houtens get a divorce.  Burns' son return.  Lisa goes to an all-boy military school, helps Burns get his money back, and becomes the town babysiter.  Ned's house is destroyed by a hurricane.  And still more!

2577539,5,B000FO0AME,"The simpsons hasn't gone downhill... its still really funny, its still really witty, the only difference is that Homer tends to think more. The newer episodes are still hilarious and while season 8 was the ""turning point,"" it doesnt mean that the episodes went from the status of the movie ""Crash"" to ""Gigli"" in a span of a few months.  People keep saying that ""This is the last great season"" as if nobody watches it anymore.  But what they don't realize is that it is still one of fox's most productive shows and, in my opinion, funnier in its new episodes than family guy's new ones.  so its not the simpsons from season 5 when conan was still rockin at the writer's desk and side-show-bob was hittin rakes for 45 seconds because they needed to fill the extra time... who cares? Remember, Groening just signed on to bring the series to magic season number 20, plus a movie deal... they're obviously doing something right...

2577540,2,B000FO0AME,"After 7 years of classics, the warning signs had already been coming, such as increasing reliance on guest voices, and recurring side characters getting more and more screen time.  This season, it is almost as if the bottom completely dropped out!

Now, there are still some good episodes this year - the Halloween Episode, X-Files rip-off, Mountain Climbing episode, and the Hurricane are all good examples of the show still struggling to keep from going completely under.  But this is the first year that the bad episodes outnumbered the good.  I mean, for crying out loud, Milhouse's parents get divorced!!  This is supposed to be a comedy, not a drama!  They might as well have subtitled that one: ""A VERY SPECIAL episode!""

Then there is the mountain of celebrity voiceovers, including but not limited to David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Leonard Nimoy, Rodney Dangerfield, Johnny Cash, SCTV's Dave Thomas, Kelsey Grammar . . .

But, again, the season does have its high points - such as Skinner and Edna caught in a lover's embrace in a school locker, prompting Ralph to say, ""They were making a baby, and I saw the baby, and the baby looked at me!"" - or one of my all-time favorite Simpson lines when we see Ned's parants via flashback lamenting that they tried discplining Ned to no avail, and saying, ""Like, we're all out of ideas cause we're like freaky beatniks!""

I will probably go ahead and purchase this season, but will definitely end my Simpsons collection there.  I guess that those who are fans of the show today are really looking forward to finally getting to these later seasons when the show transitioned into what it is now - a constant barrage of celebrity voiceovers and overly dramatic plots mostly centered around Homer's adventure-of-the-week . . . ""This Week, Homer becomes a trash collector - next week, he becomes head of the CIA!!!""  BLECH!!!",1148169600,18,1875,4.846394984326019
2577541,5,B000FO0AME,"Intro:The simpsons are the comedy gods they have been the show to beat ever since they were made and not many shows can compete with them but over the past few years they lost a bit of their edge even if they still have some good episodes. But i got to admit they aren't as a good as before. The show still have a huge fan base with milions of viewers watching it each day. Everithing with the simpsons on it is a garented seller and this dvd will also sell.

Factors:The simpsons are still great but there is no denying the fact that they aren't as good anymore and slowly,shows like family guy are taking place. I always loved the simpsons and along with many fans i probably will buy this dvd. The sale for this dvd will be high as usual.

Many great episodes in this season one of the last great Simpsons season aired between 1996 and 1997. Episodes like `bart after dark` and `you only move twice`are classics. A while after this season they started to go downfall,yes the episodes now are good but not close to the ones from previous seasons like this one. About all the episodes are good wich makes the set enjoyable.

Head packaging:As always since the controversial head packaging this set will be a head packaging and hopefully for those who doesnt like it there will be another box set similiar than the ones from Simpsons seasons 1 to 5. This head package will once again be bashed by many.

Overral:They can keep doing sets but as the seasons will come the less they will sell. But this season is good and i recommend it to fans of the show 5 stars as usual.",1148083200,10,4323,4.882191780821918
