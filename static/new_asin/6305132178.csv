975849,5,6305132178,If you enjoy hunting this movie will knock your socks off.  The hunter becomes the hunted. Five stars for Madchen Amick.,948844800,3,120,4.714285714285714
975850,5,6305132178,"I happened to catch this movie on TV and was so glad to see it is available on video,
To me, it as near perfect as a movie can be.  The acting is tremendous,the scenery and photograhpy is gorgeous, and the  suspense is unrelenting.
It is quite unpredictable, and I thought might  have ended with both hunter/hunted dying together, but thankfully it  didn't.
Canada is known for its superior film making and that is  certainly true here.",933379200,2,436,4.6103896103896105
7884294,4,6305132178,"Julie Clayton and Don Powell are game wardens living their lives and enjoying it together out in a remote area of the Rocky Mountains. They're happily in love with each other, living in the peaceful, nature surroundings of the Rockies. Their peaceful environment they longed for comes to a screeching halt one day when they come across a number of slaughtered bears, scattered across the site; done at the hands of a merciless poacher.

The FBI is called to investigate the matter, but in the middle of investigating they're all killed off by the same poacher who killed the bears. Julie and Don eventually encounter the poacher, Hanaghan, at a crossroads in the woods where Hanaghan holds Don captive with a knife. He threatens to kill him if Julie doesn't surrender her gun to him. She reluctantly abides but Hanaghan kills Don anyway, before shooting Julie down, leaving her for dead in the middle of the woods as he makes his getaway.

Julie is transported by helicopter to a hospital and just barely manages to survive.",1442188800,,1024,4.8125

7884296,3,6305132178,"I bought this item as in ""good"" condition. I guess if you have watched a video tape  80000 times and it is unclear and ""fuzzy"", and called it ""good"" then I would hate to have bought a copy that was listed as ""fair"", it would not have been viewable.",1371945600,,248,4.061224489795919
7884297,5,6305132178,It arrived on time and in good condistion.  She really like it better then he thought he would.  At a good price.,1357344000,,113,4.090909090909091
7884298,5,6305132178,"Wounded is one of my favorite movies, so much so the I purchased a VHS player so I could watch it over and over.  I wish that the owners would release it on BLU/RAY or at the most DVD.  I have all the movies that Madchen Amick has appeared in.  Does anyone know why this movie was never released on DVD?",1337126400,,303,3.9344262295081966
7884299,5,6305132178,"I saw this movie years ago and I just purchased it on vhs to watch again. It is indeed the great movie I remember. I wish it was available on dvd as my vhs player is on its last legs and I don't plan on buying another. Will probably sell it and hope that someday it will be re-released on dvd.

Would recommend for the action packed movie lovers. It is thrilling frome beginning to end.",1252540800,,386,4.078947368421052
7884300,5,6305132178,but who and why? She has to find out who is doing this. Great movie.,1188691200,,68,3.6
7884301,2,6305132178,"Sad to say, but this is far from as good a movie that the other reviews give the impression it is.  Basically the story revolves around Julie, a female federal agent, who was part of a team tracking a bear poacher.  They get wiped out, and only Julie survives because a biological quirk.  The bulk of the movie deals with her psycological recovery, and slow build up to the final confrontation between Julie and the poacher.  Unfortunately, the movie is almost devoid of suspense--it's just to predictable: especially the ending--and is marred by a poor screenplay.  Only Graham Greene saves the movie from being a total disaster, but due to circumstances way beyond his control, even his performance isn't all that great.  You'd have to be insane to buy this movie new at $65.",1078012800,2,777,4.7611940298507465
7884302,5,6305132178,"I saw this movie a while ago on HBO.  It had one of the best plots ever.  The hunter becomes the hunted.  Justice, and Revenge, and a  beautiful ending.  Wish it would come out on DVD or cheaper on VHS.  If you have the chance get this movie.  Highly recommended.",982627200,4,263,4.14
