4505345,5,B004Z29WQ2,"Unlike many of our current black independent films that are comprised of stereotypes & buffoonery, this was a good independent film and one to be proud of.  The storyline was good, good actors were selected & the acting was not only good but also realistic.  This movie was very humorous & comprised of many good scenes, good lines & also good delivery, timing, body language & facial expressions that actually coincided with the lines, which is what brings the characters to life and makes not only the characters realistic but also the story.  Also, the sound track was very good and the great songs that were selected actually coincided with the scenes, unlike some songs that are played in films that have absolutely nothing to do with the scenes. Bottom line, it was refreshing to see a black independent film that was well thought out, tastefully executed and really relative to today's relationship issues.  It was along the lines of another movie I loved that was also well done titled, ""30 Years to Life.""  After watching this movie I looked at the credits to see who the writer was so I could look out for future movies from this writer, and to see what else he may have written.  I saw that he also wrote ""Love for Sale,"" which is another black independent film I've seen and really did like.  With that said, let me say Kudos to Russ Parr for a job well done. In closing I just have to say that Clifton Powell who is one of my favorite actors, must really have a great agent because there are not too many black films or plays, whether independent or a major motion picture that he's not in.  He was actually in both of Russ Parr's films, ""35 & Ticking"" & ""Love for Sale"" which as I stated before are very good films and Clifton did a great job in both.",1312588800,15,1765,4.459627329192546

4505396,2,B004Z29WQ2,I was disappointed.  I expect more from Kevin Hart and don't think he was given the freedom to play up to his full potential or maybe the script just wasn't very good.  I liked the idea but the execution fell short of making it good.,1406073600,,233,4.155555555555556
4505397,4,B004Z29WQ2,Funny movie.  Kevin Hart always brings a movie to life.,1405900800,,55,4.5
4505418,3,B004Z29WQ2,"Had some interesting twists, but was pretty formulaic for the most part. It was nice to see some justice in the end for a couple of the characters, but the answers were a little too pat for my liking.",1405036800,,200,4.153846153846154

4505426,3,B004Z29WQ2,Some parts seamed real life events that could happen and other parts didn't...it was a little heavy at times. All in all a good watch and I laughed.,1398038400,,148,4.321428571428571

4505446,5,B004Z29WQ2,"Russ Parr did an excellent job.  I enjoyed Tamala Jones' role.  Russ Parr stretched her range showing a character other than the ""angry"" person role.  The movie had several twists that were interesting, funny, and believable.  I strongly recommend this movie.",1394150400,,259,5.2439024390243905
4505447,5,B004Z29WQ2,I enjoyed the cast and it was quite entertaining!  Kevin Hart is so funny and the plot of the picture was actually pretty good.  And I am not a plot kinda of person.,1392940800,,165,3.9696969696969697

4505452,4,B004Z29WQ2,The movie was good but I like Kevin Hart type movies. There were a few funny parts. It makes going through a pre-midlife crisis enjoyable.,1391040000,,138,4.56
4505453,5,B004Z29WQ2,"Kevin Hart is hilarious as usual, but what shocked me was Vanessa Williams was funny as well.  I definitely recommend.",1391040000,,118,4.9
4505454,3,B004Z29WQ2,I didn't like the running joke in the hot tub.  The scene where the lady saw her ex-husband with a pregnant white woman was heartbreaking.  She was really sweet and was so happy to see him. He really mistreated her.  I guess that is why he looked at her so sheepishly.  The movie was engaging. E,1389657600,,295,4.214285714285714

4505458,2,B004Z29WQ2,Moves very slow. Ploy was a bit boring. I would not watch this movie again. There are much better movies out there,1388966400,,114,4.2272727272727275

4505460,4,B004Z29WQ2,I'm really harsh on movies so I was surprised it was kind of good. They had some really good actors and actresses. And I laughed a few times which was a surprise.,1387843200,,162,4.09375
4505461,5,B004Z29WQ2,Kevin Hart is a crazy funny actor and will keep you in stitches throughout the entire movie.  There are many great supporting actors as well.,1387065600,,141,4.64
4505462,5,B004Z29WQ2,I enjoyed this movie very much. Had a lot of work to do so I chose to have this play in the back ground. Once I knew who the characters were it was pretty easy to follow without keeping my eyes on it 100% of the time. I plan to watch this movie again this week. But I will sitting in front of it,1382918400,,295,3.625
4505463,3,B004Z29WQ2,"I was expecting a comedy - as in, more than a few chuckles.  It was just ok to me.  It shouldn't be listed under comedy though.",1381276800,,127,3.8461538461538463
4505464,5,B004Z29WQ2,"This movie was very funny.  I was very surprised as I had never heard of it before, but I am glad I took the time out to watch it.",1380931200,,130,3.4827586206896552
4505465,5,B004Z29WQ2,Great story line... kept me guessing - things don't happen as you expect  Great for Girls Night Out - They were all stars,1379116800,,121,4.260869565217392
4505466,5,B004Z29WQ2,Funny movie that was very relatable. It was like an extended episode of  a tv show that has solid resolution at the end.,1376784000,,120,4.217391304347826
4505467,4,B004Z29WQ2,"Kevin Hart is so funny. I love it! Loved Megan Good in this one too, but the ending was a bit too predictable. Great movie.",1376006400,,123,3.96

4505470,5,B004Z29WQ2,"I have seen this movie twice and am watching it now. I really do enjoy it and since I'm 35, it is fitting for me and how I perceive people and their mess, I must plop down and watch whenever it runs on TV.

The writing is good. I like the characters and the funny moments are hilarious to me. I am easy to laugh but still critical so being able to make me laugh throughout this flick is really a plus in it's favor. I am not a fan of Kevin Hart or Nicole Ari Parker's acting but they did well in this movie, playing roles that you usually don't see them in.

I originally watched to compare it to ""30 Years to Life"" which came out 10 years before this movie. I love ""30"" and I must say I love this one too.

Great job!",1373673600,,718,3.870748299319728
4505471,3,B004Z29WQ2,It was okay.  Pretty predictable to me.  The acting was so-so.  Glad I didn't pay to see this in the movies or to rent it.,1372636800,,122,3.8
4505472,4,B004Z29WQ2,35 and Ticking keeps the audience involved from the opening to the end.  It's mix of Drama and Comedy it is definitely its strong point.  It's story is one that needs to be told.,1372550400,,178,4.205882352941177
4505473,3,B004Z29WQ2,While im addicted to african american films this one was not so great still had some great moments but not something i'll be in a hurry to watch again. Kevin Hart is pretty funny in it tho.,1370304000,,189,4.135135135135135
4505474,5,B004Z29WQ2,Pretty dang funny and good.  This was very unexpected not many commerciasls for it.kevin Hart was a fool.  Very good ending.,1370044800,,124,4.857142857142857
4505475,5,B004Z29WQ2,A movie must see for everyone! A group of very close friends are in their mid thirties and want to get married before they get too old but can't  find that true person.a few laughs and a great movie to watch!,1369872000,,208,4.073170731707317

4505477,5,B004Z29WQ2,I really enjoyed watching this film. The actors were so believable. The plot was timely and you wanted everyone to be happy in the end. No swearing or violence or unnecessary sex. See for yourself,1369440000,,196,4.628571428571429
4505478,3,B004Z29WQ2,"This movie was just ok for me. I will say the movie had a great cast... some really talented actors/actresses who made the movie somewhat watchable. I laughed in a few scenes but I have to say that I struggled with staying interested. The storyline wasn't meaty enough, some of the jokes fell flat and  and the ending was for me a little to neat and kind of lame. It's like they wanted to make sure each character had a ending but it seemed hasty and not well thought out. It's an ok watch if you have some time.",1368921600,,512,4.171717171717172
4505479,3,B004Z29WQ2,"The actors/actresses played their parts well. Very atrractive women by the way and it was humorous, too. I'd recommend it for anyone iterested in such humour.",1367712000,,158,5.115384615384615
4505480,4,B004Z29WQ2,"Definitely Russ Parr's best film. The storyline was a little drawn out (ie, not much develops throughout the movie) but it kept my interest and the movie was cast perfectly. Kevin Hart was funny and was able to keep it subtle without being buffoonish. And Meagan Goode was charming. I like how the ending was not a complete happy ever after for all the protagonists.",1364947200,,366,4.6461538461538465

4505485,4,B004Z29WQ2,"I watched this on whim, but was pleasantly surprised. Overall it was a solid way to spend an evening, but you do finish it with a few questions still left unanswered. I tend to like movies that give you something to discuss afterwards, and this definitely does. Be warned - it is funny at times but it also has  difficult and sad moments. It's a WINNER.",1362787200,,353,4.348484848484849

Also, it would have been nice for more back story on the couple across the hall (what happened to them)? And, what about the presumed cheater (ex) husband? Did the wife cry at the end because of the baby of because she basically found out that he presumably cheated on her? I want answers, lol!",1350086400,,488,4.4222222222222225
4505498,3,B004Z29WQ2,"I was shocked watching this film, after reading other's reviews.

This was not a funny movie.  There's been a trend recently to put everything that's not a horror or intense drama into the ""comedy"" category.  I'm really hoping some of these movie related sites start to re-categorize movies into more appropriate categories.

This was a light hearted drama, romance film.  Mainly a character development and situational romance were the focus and intention.  If the writers thought they were creating a comedy, they should actually view a few comedies and then compare their script.  There were jokes that played as dialogue, that didn't even make the characters in the movie laugh; instead they were annoyed, or groaning at another characters cut downs, or displays of ego.  Guess what, the audience was doing the same, groaning and being annoyed.

This might be a good movie to watch late at night if you can't sleep.  Otherwise, if you're looking for a comedy... look elsewhere.",1346544000,,981,5.037267080745342

4505503,5,B004Z29WQ2,"I actually had never heard of this movie until tonight.  It came on BET, and I decided to watch it because Kevin Hart was in it and I love him.  I absolutely fell in love with the movie, and logged on to Amazon to purchase it. There is an all-star cast.  There are a lot of story lines, but they are not hard to follow, and the movie was not poorly put together at all.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who's looking for a good movie to watch.  I give it two thumbs up! '",1332633600,,478,3.88659793814433

4505511,3,B004Z29WQ2,"The writing on this film was some what bone dry, with either forced comedic moments that were meant to be funny but wasn't or not enough wordiness between characters at pivotal points which made the film drag in a slow spacey manner.  Russ has written better, like, ""love for sale"", although the writing was on the weak side the star cast of actors made up for what could have been a total lost of a film.  Not to be minimized on writing specifically, the subject matter was pretty nice, I was thrown for a loop at certain points with whom I thought would end up with each other.  So, kudos for that twist, normally I be up on stuff like that.  Over-all this was a pleasant film to watch and it definitely had me reflecting about how ppl my age perceive in this day and era.  I can relate to a lot of what was shown in this film and so I would recommend this film to anyone who would want to see a solid romantic comedy that isn't over the top with any slap stick buffoonery...",1319414400,5,977,4.2032085561497325

4505514,5,B004Z29WQ2,I think that Kevin Hart is the funniest man out right now. You just laugh looking at him and that is sad because he is very good looking to be so short (my opinion) This cast was wonderfully selected and the story line was believable. If you love Kevin Hart you want to add this one to your collection. This is one I have watched over and over again. I received this one as a gift but I'm gonna purchase it today so my son can stop trying to borrow it back.,1317859200,,457,3.9782608695652173

4505517,5,B004Z29WQ2,"This movie was heads and shoulders above a lot of independent black cinema due to several factors: 1.) The Cast--the right group of individual was chosen to act in this flick, which was a real plus, cause everyone here had the talent to pull it off.  2.) The Storylines--everybody had a story to tell, and even though a happy ending was not to be had by all, the story of their lives brough enough realism and never made them one-dimensonal.  3.)  The Production--totally crystal clear and professionally done and able to understand every word being spoken.  It was a real movie!  Believe me, I have spent good money supporting our films and received worse.  This was a treat for me and I really enjoyed watching it.",1313366400,16,716,4.642857142857143

Do you need the goggles this time? Do you want this or this (holding up a huge bottle of lotion, and a huge bottle of lube, for everyone in the waiting area to see)? We got some new DVDs. We've got 'Nasty Neanderthals'. . .""
