4658726,4,B005DETYW8,"I have more mixed feeling about Storm than any previous CD/DVD from them. If you haven't watched the DVD yet please consider this a spoiler alert.

I have to preface this by saying I became a fan of Celtic Thunder in their very first days as a group and have been a fan ever since. I own all of their DVD's, most of their CD's and have been (and will continue going to) their live shows. I embrace the changes they have made as original members of the group have left, others have moved forward as frontmen, and positions have changed. So please don't read between the lines of this review and suspect for even a moment that I do not like them ... before or after their metamorphosis.

Storm is different from previous shows in many ways in that it is musical theater with the performers playing costumed roles rather than concert performances. With that in mind, here is my take on what I loved and what left me wanting:

PROS:

While I really like the way in previous albums how Celtic Thunder takes contemporary classics and covers them, let's face it, a lot of good bands can do that. That plays well in the U.S. where those songs were popular but I and other fans also like when they perform more unique and ""traditional"" Gaelic standards. Isn't the reason we seek world music to expand our horizons, not to listen to an Irish band sing American songs from the 1950's? In Storm there are no contemporary covers, the show is primarily new songs written by Phil Coulter, with a couple of old Irish classics. Of all of the tracks included I only was familiar with two. And that is awesome!!!  This was a big plus for Storm although it may be difficult to accept for fans who expected more covers and Gaelic music.

The beautiful set was much more elaborate and story telling than most of their DVD's. It was easy to imagine being in an Irish village of olde and the cast members being part of a living history.

I liked that the production seemed to be more seamless than most concerts, with all of the songs interwoven into a grand overall story.

CONS:

I have four:

1. The last PRO I mentioned was offset by the occasional cutaways to the audience during the production.  Yes, we get it that it was taped before a live audience, but there is an old rule in theater that performers shouldn't break character, and by cutting away to a 2009 audience that is exactly what the editors did. It ruined the mood of being in another time / another place. Cutaways work well for shows that are obviously live concerts, but not well at all for shows in which the viewer is asked to follow a theatrical story line.

2. I understand that Sharon Browne also produces Celtic Women.  That's fine.  I have no problem with the beautiful women who perform and dance during Celtic Thunder shows.  It is right and it is natural.  But to give them singing roles in a Celtic Thunder show?  Wrong! It is so out of place and it diminishes the band as a whole. I mean, what if one of the guys suddenly walked on stage at a Celtic Women show and took over the stage? This was a bad judgment on the producers' part, plain and simple.

3. I know that the talented Neil Byrne was not yet a frontman in 2009 when Storm was taped, BUT the producers of the DVD that was released in September of 2011 took great pains to prominently feature his image on the DVD, yet they included only about 10 seconds of his magnificent voice in the final edit.  This is a major omission. If they feature his photo on the cover as part of the cast he should have more featured time in the show. They must have taped more footage of him in the original concert and now that he is a frontman they should have edited more of him in the Storm DVD. He is 100% part of the show now, and should have been included in a 2011 DVD release.

4. The show seems much too short, or maybe a better way of putting it, it seems to end too soon. It built well, with the old man (George) playing against the young buck (Damian) and the sexually active tension of the young men in-between and then we were presented with the glorious moments of internal conflict during the number Mo Ghile Mear

""Every day I'm constantly enduring grief, Weeping bitterly and shedding tears, Because my lively lad has left me, And no news is told of him - alas"".

And the viewer expects to see where it all leads. And surprisingly it leads to the Storm show ending and the performers taking bows. There is something more to be told, did the production run out of ideas? It left me hanging.

Final comment.  Most DVD's include backstage interviews, outtakes, behind the scenes views, etc in the ""bonus"" section.  This DVD had a couple of minutes of still slides from the performance, a 20 second TV commercial and a 30 second TV commercial.  That's all.

While I still think Celtic Thunder is one of the best current acts worldwide and nothing in this review takes away from the performers' talents, I can't help but think Sharon Browne went cheap on this production. I am sorry to give Storm only 4 stars. It's little details that indicate the producers cut corners, oh like spelling Damian's name ""Damien"" on the DVD jacket ... really?

If you like them as a group please don't let this review discourage you, it's still worth watching.  But bottom line is Storm is not their shining moment. They have better days ahead.

 [UPDATE 10/28/11]

I attended Celtic Thunder's live fall tour show at Humphreys Concerts By The Bay in San Diego on Oct 25.  I had previously seen them only in the large downtown auditorium venues.  What an amazing difference.  Firstly, the lads exuberant personalities are difficult to appreciate when you are sitting in Row 200 in a gilded auditorium filled with red velvet seats.  Seeing them outdoors surrounded by San Diego Bay under the stars was magical.  It is a small venue with folding plastic chairs on the lawn and the furthest seat would be considered Orchestra in many auditoriums.

This was their first outdoor show ever.  Why I'm mentioning this is THIS was the kind of venue Storm should have been taped at.  The performers are much more natural than when they are in a luxurious opera house.  The show itself I think indicated that Sharon and Phil read these reviews ... it was a combination of some of the Storm-like elements, more traditional elements, and the fun stuff we all love about CT.  It was fun to see the performers casually playing around outdoors before and after the show, something that is not really possible when they are in a downtown venue.",1316476800,94,6523,4.470042194092827
4658727,5,B005DETYW8,I have seen this group in person and on public T.V. and have all of their DVD'S and CD's and have never been disappointed. Great for the whole family.,1316476800,,150,4.206896551724138

4658731,5,B005DETYW8,"This is must for the Celtic Thunder fan. Although this didn't air on PBS like others, really like the fact that this was completely different from the others since this sort of reminded me like I was watching a mini Broadway musical. Throughout the entire thing the cast wore costumes instead of usual clothing plus when most Celtic Thunder shows end, the guys usual do it by wearing kilts and that wasn't the case this time around. In addition Deidre Shannon and Carolina Torti also do some musical numbers.",1489363200,,508,4.719101123595506

4658736,5,B005DETYW8,"great music, great talents and I just found out that the DVD is usually only half the show that I would like to see. That's not fair. But still the music is fantastic. But I agree with those that say this DVD should be only the Celtic Thunder guys. It is their voices I bought this DVD to hear.  but the early tunes before they bring in the women is just about worth it. great costumes lovely music. Just wish they had left the women out and made it longer. I guess they do that so I will buy more DVDs, but I don't like tons of DVDs lying around.",1478217600,,547,3.9727272727272727

4658750,4,B005DETYW8,"I love Celtic Thunder, but of all their shows this is my least favorite. It is a musical drama but I much prefer the guys just singing. If you're a  new Celtic Thunder fan, skip this one and get another of their shows instead.",1471305600,,226,4.136363636363637

4658752,5,B005DETYW8,"This show was unlike any of the others.  It is set in a gypsy camp and features some of my now favorite from a very large list of Celtic Thunder songs I have purchased.  Each performer has at least one off the charts song.  There is also some amazing dance routines as well.  I have purchased all the show DVDs and my wife and I watch them frequently ( if you consider almost daily as frequently).  Especially on days when the world seem to beat me up (which is why I watch them almost daily).  I discovered them one day flipping channels and I came upon one of their PBS specials.  I decided to watch them for a few minutes.  Within 2 weeks I hade purchased all their DVDs and about a hundred of their songs.  You know the rest.  If you have not seen them, check out one of their PBS specials.  A word of warning, it may change your life.",1462406400,6,839,4.117283950617284

They wear costumes in this one and dance too as well as sing. There are a lot of really good songs on this dvd. Damian McGinty has a couple songs he does, there is one by George Donaldson (who is now deceased), and of course Keith Harkin, Neil Byrn, Paul Byrom, and Ryan Kelly have songs on here too. We especially like the opening and closing numbers. We watch a lot of their videos on YouTube, there are some songs on here that are not on their YouTube channel. Very enjoyable.",1458000000,,629,4.294117647058823

4658778,4,B005DETYW8,"It was amazing! the music was great (as always) and I really enjoyed it.

I think the female vocalists were amazing, although I was a bit disappointed that 'Shadows dancing' was Caroline Torti's main solo, it didn't seem to suit her voice that well, it was still pretty good though,

and I LOVED 'Tender is the night' (Paul Byrom and Dierdra Shannon's duet) it was terrific!,

'Look at me' was awesome :)

I watch the DVD over and over and over! it's probably one of my favorite things to watch! I know almost ALL the songs!

I know it wasn't exactly what Celtic Thunder usually does but it was terrific!

The DVD got here very fast and was in perfect condition no damage to the cardboard box it was shipped in, to the case, or to the DVD I am very impressed.",1432425600,,759,4.309859154929577

They are all delightful, charming young men with beautiful voices, an easy smile and a beautiful voice.  You hear solos and various groups of them singing together and each song is wonderful.  This was the first one they did that was more like singing and acting and it was delightful so I ordered both the DVD and the CD.  It seems like their shows are always sold out and everyone is smiling.",1384905600,,518,4.244897959183674

Thinking of it brings a smile to my face.",1375228800,,358,4.298507462686567

4658915,5,B005DETYW8,"I love Celtic Thunder and the Celtic Women.  I have watched this DVD over and over and will do so many more times.  I have to admit that this is not the best program they have done; they are so good, it is easy to overlook.  This is my opinion and in no way does it reflect anything of value.  They are just good!

They do entertain and with such ease.  What fun it would be to watch them perform live.",1369008000,,402,3.9012345679012346
4658916,5,B005DETYW8,Wonderful video...lots of fun. Keith and Ryan play the best characters and shannon sings beautifully. More of a concept video than variety shows.,1368662400,,145,5.3478260869565215

4658921,2,B005DETYW8,"This could have been a wonderful story-telling show, but all the different scenes lacked continuation and seemed totally random and without any storyline to follow, the performance quickly lost any interest for me. As usual, I got quickly irritated by Byrom's suave crooning. Too bad..a missed opportunity to do something great.",1364860800,,328,5.450980392156863
4658922,5,B005DETYW8,"I really enjoy listening to Celtic Thunder.  Some day I would like to see them perform in person.  Since that may never happen, the next best thing is to watch their DVD's which are excellent.  Anyone who likes fun and music should get their DVD's.",1363651200,,248,4.466666666666667

4658925,5,B005DETYW8,They are one of our favorite groups. My wife and I have seen them perform on stage and what you see on the dvd or hear on the cd is what you see and hear on stage. Some new people to round out the sound now that Damian's voice has changed.,1361318400,,239,3.7058823529411766

4658929,3,B005DETYW8,Video quality and show was nice to watch. Noticed during the second song that the actual sound was not in sync with the video itself. After a while it started to get annoying and I had to stop. Don't know if it is something that was screwed up during production or if it's just my dvd that has the problem,1359590400,,305,4.1
4658930,5,B005DETYW8,"I am partial to these guys .. I have every CD and video of their performances. I have gone to every concert when they come to town. I'm typical girl and LOVE Keith Harkin. But I love all the other guys too. This is where I first was exposed to Deirdre Shannon. I think she was the flutist for Celtic Thunder.

If  you haven't seen these guys, you are missing out! Great show everytime!!! They give you your monies worth and then some.",1359331200,,434,4.216867469879518

4658945,4,B005DETYW8,"I enjoyed it, everyone delivers an excellent performance.  The jumping in and out of the tree was great a couple of times, but then it was corny.  ""That's Entertainment"" is much more fun and enjoyable to watch repeatedly, while this one can sit on the shelf longer between viewings.",1356912000,,282,4.73469387755102
4658946,5,B005DETYW8,"My first introduction to this group was ther Christmas DVD.  A DVD I give out as a Christmas gift...all who received it love it.  I have purchased all Celtic Thunder DVD's & CD's to date.  Every member of the group including the back up musicans and dancers excell in every way.  The music ranges from olde Irish to contemporary hits done ""their"" way. Also don't miss Celtic Woman by the same producers.  They are magnificent also.  Ireland!  Ireland!",1356825600,,451,4.705128205128205

4658949,5,B005DETYW8,"Love anything and everything Celtic Thunder did, but I especially loved Storm, because it read like a story and it had mystery, romance and battles all in one,,,,good planning,,,,wow...I've watched it over and over and over",1356307200,,223,5.222222222222222

4658963,5,B005DETYW8,"Celtic Thunder NEVER dissapoints. They are very talented and personable. They are like a part of my family and I love having them in my living room teaching me all they're songs. This was a ""have to have"" dvd that I could not live without. I started out with them in 2007, and when the next dvd comes out, I always have to have it. People all over the world love them. I'm just another fan.",1355184000,,390,4.144736842105263
4658964,5,B005DETYW8,I love CT. They are very funny guys with nice personalities. Phil Coulter did great job with the song.

All have great voices and talent ;-) love all DVDs from Celtic Thunder.,1350345600,,314,4.526315789473684

4658967,5,B005DETYW8,"Another high entertainment value has been produced by the talented cast of Celtic Thunder again.

Each and every performer has risen to the high standards that is expected from these people and in my opinion, Keith excels in his role.  Having said that, it is really hard to say why.  I guess, I have accepted Keith, Damian and Ryan as my personal favourites but I really do enjoy them all.

Do yourself a favour and buy this album for many hours of pleasurable viewing.

I hope they produce more DVDs so I may add them to my collection.  Simply put, I just can not get enough of these guys.",1342224000,,591,4.376146788990826
4658968,5,B005DETYW8,"I have every Celtic Thunder dvd to date.  ""Storm"" is so totally different from what these amazing guys usually do.  Not at all what I expect from this great group.  I loved having the theatrical genre as well as their wonderful singing.  ""Storm"" skillfully showcases how varied these young men can be.  Their producer took quite a risk going this far afield, but she hit it out of the park.",1341792000,,390,4.514285714285714

4658970,4,B005DETYW8,"This DVD is different from most performance DVD's. It has songs incorporated into a story line setting. The songs are entertaining as are the actions of the performers. If you do not care for the story line DVD, the songs from the DVD are available on a CD. The story is entertaing and the songs mesh well with the story.",1340928000,,321,4.366666666666666
4658971,5,B005DETYW8,"Love, love these guys! Have seen them in concert and their fun and vitality is contagious! The group has changed a bit since this album but the spirit is still there. I have all their CD's and DVD's and can't wait to se them again in concert! Wish I was 40 yrs younger! Such lovely Irish boyos",1337040000,,293,4.157894736842105
4658972,4,B005DETYW8,"I'm new to the Celtic Thunder phenomena and from my get go, I wanted to see Storm. I love the idea of a story arc for the men of CT to act out as well as sing out. The songs are good and sung well. The dancing, well, there is dancing. I really didn't understand why martial arts katas are being done in the middle of Ireland.

The story is timeless,the conflict between two groups and, for the most part well acted.

George Donaldson is the patriarch of the settlers and has his eye on Paul Byrom as the only man to wed his pretty young daughter. Like any good Irish clan there's unseen conflict since Mr. Donaldson sings Life in the Old Dog Yet.

Meanwhile, Paul Byrom is the son of the land holder and apparently the liaison between his never seen father and the new settlers. His operatic tenor is put to good use, particularly in Not the One. He has eyes for a lady who's stumbled into the camp following the Highwayman played by Keith Harkin.

Mr. Harkin's solo Stand and Deliver is sung with passion and determination.

Ryan Kelly, a personal favorite, plays the gypsy chief. He is very talented and has studied acting which makes his portrayal all the more painful. Throwing his chest out and flinging an arm after is not acting.

Neil Byrne is in the background but his voice is beautifully evident on Lagan Love.

Damian McGinty is the eager young buck who doesn't understand what adulthood is really all about. Look at Me is excellent for displaying not only his voice but a young man's confidence.

The finest set piece is done by Keith Harkin and Caroline Torti and sung by the unseen Charley Bird. I believed that their hunger for each other was real.

The ladies of Celtic Thunder are lovely as always and their music is wonderful as ever.

Deirdre Shannon is perfect as the lady who runs after a highway man only to fall in love with a member of the proper class. Her soaring voice is excellent in The Highwayman and Harry's game.

With much of the music by Phil Coulter I feel it's a must have.

Now for the I wish, I wish if they were going to do a musical, they'd have done a whole one, dialog and all, scenery changes etc. I think it could have been even more magical that it was. I do hope this will be revisited and expanded some day soon.",1336867200,2,2260,4.342042755344418
4659023,4,B005DETYW8,"Bought this(for myself), with another CT DVD(Heritage), this past Christmas. This was the last live concert for two of the founding members(Paul and Damien), before they left the group to start their solo work. it was also one with the full CT family(Lady singers, dancers and band members), on stage together. Good job to all the CT family. 5 of 5 stars.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Celtic-Thunder-Heritage/dp/B004G8LKBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Celtic Thunder: Heritage</a>",1334102400,,518,6.746268656716418

My grandsons (ages 2 and 7) are equally enthralled. I'm pretty sure I will be ordering a second dvd for when we wear out this one! I recommend this to everyone young and old.",1333584000,,326,4.45
4659025,5,B005DETYW8,"This dvd presents a different kind of performance from Celtic Thunder. They have a storyline, and each of the members of the group have a specific character to play. It highlights nicely the different voices and personalities in the group, and it seems the performers are enjoying themselves as well.",1333238400,,300,5.02
4659026,3,B005DETYW8,"My 95 yo mother loves watching these guys.  The music is good, the material is not over the top.  I like the special features more, I've seen these DVDs 3 or 4 times now.  This is probably not their best stuff.  But it was a concept to try.  Kinda like ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The musical"".",1332979200,,293,4.160714285714286
4659027,1,B005DETYW8,"This was very disapoiting, it was notting more that a long skit, Not real singing, just a musical version. I would not recament it. Celtic Thunder is giving less minets of time on every DVD, it sucks, The Show was 1 hour and 40 min. The Take me Home was 1 hour and 44 Min, The It's Entertainment 57 min, Celtic Thunder Christmass 1 Hour & 02 min, Heritage 1 Hour & 03 min, Storm 1 Hour & 01 min, Voyage 1 Hour. So they are giving us a Just over a 1/2 of a show compared to when they frist started, they get us wanting more, but give you less. At least Celtic Woman Gave 1 Hour and 31 min, on the last Beleave DVD, 30 min more then you get with Celtic Thunder. That Sucks!",1332374400,,671,3.9051094890510947

4659030,4,B005DETYW8,"My daughter and I ADORE Celtic Thunder and I always buy their DVDs because they were always closed captioned. Until now :( With Storm, it was not closed captioned and I had to print the lyrics to follow along. Nowhere does it mentioned closed captioning in the ads but I assumed from the previous DVDs it would be. Deaf people love music contrary to myths. I've already pre-ordered the next DVD thats coming out so I'm crossing my fingers and hoping that it will be captioned. That is the only quibble I have with this DVD. Other than that, fantastic show. :)",1330041600,,559,4.490196078431373

4659053,5,B005DETYW8,I received the Storm DVD for Christmas and wow! I liked it so much that when I finished watching it I immediately hit play again and have watched it about 3 more times since!  I like the way they wove a plot around all the songs.  It was much more than just a concert...it was like watching a musical.  From the opening number A New Day Dawning to Mo Ghile Mar and everything in between it was great.  The girl who did The Highwayman and Harry's Game had such a beautiful voice as did the girl who sang and danced to Shadow Dancing.  Loved Ryan's Midnight Well (previously on their Take Me Home CD) and Keith's Stand and Deliver.  Keith and Damian were great together on Look at Me.  Paul's She's not for me and George's Life in the Old Dog Yet were great.  Now I just need to get the CD for my car!,1326153600,,799,4.109677419354838

4659058,4,B005DETYW8,"From reading previous reviews, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I love Celtic Thunder Storm!  Very cool!  That said, I do agree with the reviewer who asked what the heck is up with Damian's tattered and dirty clothing. It could have been toned down a bit.  It was so exaggerated it seemed almost clownish.  I guess Damian was too young and cooperative to point out that he looked uncomfortably out of place with the others.",1325376000,,427,4.565789473684211
4659059,5,B005DETYW8,"I love this Cd and DVD, the cast includes more men and women, and poor Damian needs a better wardrobe!!

watch over and over!! Illinois",1321574400,,250,4.208333333333333

4659061,3,B005DETYW8,"Most of my household loves Celtic Thunder. Very talented men, singing uplifting, fun songs. I would rate this higher but it is visibly evident they are doing the show by lip-synching. My 9 year old son even said it could have been done better had you not been able to tell. But, wonderful songs, great concept and talented, good looking guys and gals. A lot of fun and enjoyment to be had!",1321142400,,389,4.416666666666667
4659062,3,B005DETYW8,"We have every CD and DVD Celtic Thunder has ever released, some in multiple copies and versions, and watch them all the time. We LOVE Celtic Thunder, so I really hate to give this a less than 5 star review, but neither the DVD nor the CD come close to what you'd expect.  Unlike the other CDs and DVD's that we've watched and listened to countless times, we couldn't even get through this once.  The song choices are strange and don't showcase their immense talents, and the female dancers and singers don't fit in and are a complete unnecessary distraction that really throws off the already uneven pace of the DVD.  I can see why they waited so long from the time this was filmed until it's release, it really is not their best work at all. Some of the performances are good, like Paul's ""She's Not The One"", but the staging, forced story and weird costumes in general are such a distraction it was hard to watch.  Damian barefooted and in tattered rags...why?

What we've always loved about Celtic Thunder are the guys, their different personalities and their immense talent.  Having them try to act out a story in forced personas obscured the very reasons fans love them -- for their individuality!

 However, if anyone is not completely familiar with Celtic Thunder, they should not let this DVD dissuade them from any of the other shows -- Heritage showed that they could really turn it around and get back to what they were good at, and the latest show touring now, Voyage, was fantastic and likely will be a good DVD when it is released after the current tour is over.  I would highly recommend any of their other shows, just not this one. Still, if you're a diehard CT fan, then you might need this show just to complete your collection, and Paul's performance really was good.",1320451200,2,1786,4.5736677115987465

However, I thought the sound quality was a bit ordinary and the plot thin to the point of non existent.  Still enjoyable, but it won't be watched as often as their other DVDs.",1320105600,,298,4.285714285714286

4659067,5,B005DETYW8,"I truly like this one the best. I love seeing them stand & singing. But they truly did a great job in this one. Their singing & acting was great. Their dancing was excellent. Each one of the guys was great. Keith song ""Stand & Deliver"" was great singing & acting. Ryan as The Gypsy was excellent performer. And I love the whole group singing & dancing to ""Hail The Hero(Mo Ghile Mear) it was excellent. I haven't put it down. If you love Celtic Thunder this DVD & CD is a must. I love these guys & they just keep getting better.

4659068,3,B005DETYW8,"Well, it is like a stage play; or, I guess it -was- a stage play.  Okay, but not my favorite. I kept expecting someone to go off to war.

Damian does a very good job with his part, and Ryan Kelly is good,of course. The rest are okay too, except a bit awkward at times. These guys are singers, and darned good ones! I say let them sing.

The fact is, I like them so much, I would probably get anything with them in it, -to a point.  Ha! I give them credit for being good sports. Hmmm. Whose idea was this anyhow? If you must do it, maybe a bit more experience will help.

In any event, I will watch it again; glad I have it; otherwise I would wonder why I did not. Not really excited about the girls twisting and flitting about either. (Memories of High School plays.) Sometimes it fits to have a girl in one of the songs, but sometimes it seems like, ""Let's try this."" Of course, in this one, girls were necessary, but...

This is a sorry review, because I find myself struggling for words.

4659069,5,B005DETYW8,"Celtic Thunder has again branched out into new territory, this time a ""mini-Broadway musical.""  Colorful costumes and stage set, lighting that subtly moves the story from night to day and back again, stellar guest singers and dancers -- all enhance the basic quality that is the hallmark of Celtic Thunder:  good music from great musicians.  Phil Coulter's original songs provide the narrative, and the singers convincingly render music into dramatic action.  Ryan Kelly as the Gypsy King is a standout, as is Keith Harkin as The Highwayman, in a romantic tale of a heroic Celtic past.  Everyone in the show becomes more performance-savvy every time out, and I can't wait to see what's next!
(Oh, yes.  That would be ""Voyage,"" the new DVD of the 2011 touring show, to be out next spring.)",1319500800,,788,4.887218045112782

4659072,5,B005DETYW8,"After waiting over a year for the DVD to become availabe, I have to say it is everything I thought it would be.  Celtic Thunder at it's best.  The music, the lads, the performance is nothing less than brillant.

Thank you to Sharon for making this video and allowing the Celtic Thunder fans a chance to see another side of these talented lads.

From the handsome ""Highway Man"" to the Dark Gypsy at the ""Midnight Well"" and the Landowner's Son,  looking for love, but, ""She's Not The One."" The Head of the Clan, who's still ""The Top Banana"", consoling the frustrated but charming and loveable ""Young Buck"" who wants to be accepted as a man in, ""Look At Me"" and ""When You Are Eighteen,"" all just left me wanting more.

Hooray to Phil Coulter for putting together such a memorable and musically brillant show, and one that no genuine CT fan would want to be without. Music, dance and battle for one's land, love, honor and validation... At the end, ""Storm"" had me standing and applauding in my own living room which was rather funny since I watched it alone the first time...
I highly recommend this video for all audiences young and old...  Great family entertainment.

Thanks also to Amazon for making Celtic Thunder's DVD's and CD's availble for pre-order and release date delivery.",1319328000,,1281,4.662222222222222

I have watched it one time, won't watch it again. I was hoping for better through the complete show but better never happened. The CD was better but only because I could not watch what was going on....
These gentlemen have such wonderful talent and voices.  I hate to see them go downhill in this manner.  I understand the desire to do something new but this was way off the hook.  I wasted my money buying it.  Not sure I will buy anything else of theirs.",1318809600,,628,4.299145299145299
4659126,5,B005DETYW8,"I got my copy of the STORM DVD yesterday, and had a ball watching it.  It was wonderfully entertaining.  Ryan Kelly plays the dark character he is famous for, this time as a gypsy king.  Ryan's Midnight Well and Caroline's/Charley's Shadows Dancing are very sexy.  Caroline's dancing and electric blue costume were mesmerizing.  I wish I could replicate her arm and hand gestures for belly dancing.  As others have pointed out, STORM is a musical play with an elaborate set, plenty of costumes, and THOSE dancers from It's Entertainment fame.  All the primary CT singers, musicians and dancers get to do some acting, and I enjoyed seeing them in those different roles.  Deirdre Shannon's enchanting voice was a welcome addition; she plays the love interest of the landowner's son.

While I've been a diehard Celtic Thunder fan since I discovered them last year, I buy only the DVDs because I particularly enjoy the on stage theatrics, stagecraft and choreography, along with the singing.  STORM had all these in spades!  I wish I could have been in the audience watching it all live!  And I wish STORM had been longer.

PS:  I bought my DVD from Amazon.ca.  It arrived just 3 days after I ordered it, using standard mail.  Very good service!",1318636800,,1241,4.81042654028436

We were both sadly disappointed with this one.  I think the producers/directors of Celtic Thunder should leave things alone and just keep giving us concerts like It's Entertainment, Heritage, the Show, etc. These shows are what have made these guys so popular with their fans.  Phil Coulter - just write a few songs that highlights what we love about these wonderful entertainers.
A loyal fan from New Mexico and still waiting for your tour to come to my state so I can enjoy you all in person!
Carry on Celtic Thunder :-)",1318291200,,694,4.3984375
4659128,5,B005DETYW8,"Storm is the long-awaited DVD from Celtic Thunder that was filmed at the same time as It's Entertainment. Fans have been raving about it, details about it, every since then. It was meant to be something different than what they normally do, and it is. According to website information, there are no plans to tour this production or do something similar to it anytime in the future. That in itself alone makes it special. The performances make it even more special.

It is a story told in song about the people, the land and the fight for it. Yes, there are women in the production. It would not have made sense without women in the production. With the exception of one of the women, all the other women appeared in the other DVD also recorded at that time, including some of them being part of the band.

Most of the songs are original for this show. They moved the story along. It made perfect sense to me. If anything, it could have lasted longer. Every time I try to decide which are my favorite songs, I just can't make up my mind. Seeing the lads singing and dancing, climbing trees and jumping out of them, staying in character throughout the entire show is really fun. The fact that Paul Bryom and Damian McGinty are no longer part of the show made this an extra-special occassion.

This is Phil Coulter's work at his best. It is a very nice production. I say enjoy it for what it is and don't try to speculate what will come next for Celtic Thunder based upon this long-awaited performance. I will definitely enjoy mine for years to come.",1318118400,,1547,4.459363957597173
4659129,5,B005DETYW8,"I have been a fan of Celtic Thunder practically since they formed in 2008 .  STORM is a departure from their usual style of performing in that it isn't a show but a musical story of two groups of people who live in the same place.  It is an age-old story of people who have different ways of life conflicting with each other.  Ryan Kelly as the Gypsy king is outstanding in his role.  George Donaldson is the leader of the landowners and has several excellent solos.  Keith Harkin as the Highway Man does a fantastic job.  Damian McGinty is coming of age and wants to prove himself.  Paul Byrom is George's son and delivers a haunting solo.  Neil Byrne also has a solo.  But it is the women, Deidre Shannon with her haunting solo about the Highwayman and Charley Bird as Ryan Kelly's gypsy sister, who deliver fantastic performances in the show.  For people who want a show, this will be a disappointment; however, for the true fans of Celtic Thunder, this will be a great addition to their collection.  The people in the audience when STORM was filmed raved about STORM for years until fans approval got the show released.  STORM will not disappoint.",1318118400,,1151,4.533980582524272
4659130,5,B005DETYW8,"I loved this dvd. It was a departure from their usual stuff, but it was a fantastic performace by all of the boys and even a few girls. I enjoyed it all the more because CT looked like they were having a ball. I wish I had the opportunity to see this live. I truly love all of their stuff and hope to see many more wonderful things from them.",1317772800,,342,3.9
4659131,5,B005DETYW8,We love most anything by Celtic Thunder. This was a nice change from the usual concert setting. The scenery and costumes were great. Phil Coulter and Sharon Brown have outdone themselves!!!! Songs and music fantastic!!!,1317686400,,219,5.285714285714286
4659162,5,B005DETYW8,"The greatest thing about all the Celtic thunder dvds is that each one has its own unique style. This was no different. The songs were different, each one sang the songs that fit their style of voice and yet they all sung great together. After watching the dvd, you can play the cd going down the road and still visualize the one singing. This is my choice of a perfect group.",1317600000,,375,4.295774647887324
4659163,5,B005DETYW8,"This was definately the best Celtic Thunder video released so far.  I've watched all the others and love them.  But this one was just something else.  There was fire and passion, fun and danger.  Everyone played the parts perfectly.  Songs were written just for the character.
Definately a 'not to be missed' video for the collection.",1317513600,,334,4.892857142857143
4659164,3,B005DETYW8,"I totally agree with the two star and three star reviews. My husband, family members and I were so taken with Celtic Thunder from the beginning. The first DVD was filmed,edited and done so well, so completely. The music perfectly displayed their talents individually and as a group.  I can say the same for the second one. We began to have mixed feelings about ""It's Entertainment"", feeling as though some of the music and show was ""forced"". I did give my opinions on any survey request as I'm sure many did hoping our voices would be heard to bring Celtic Thunder back to their roots. We have seen several of their early shows and thoroughly enjoyed them. I do understand changing things up but in this case I feel they changed things down. This production feels like a high school musical without a true ending. The Celtic Thunder guys are SO much more talented and don't need anything more than the sweet sound of their voices to carry them thru. The addition of so many woman's vocals was unnecessary and did indeed take away from Celtic Thunder, but WORST OF ALL was the fact that the beautiful voice of Charley Bird was lip synched by someone else-WHAT???? Now we're at lip synching???? Please bring Celtic Thunder back!",1317340800,,1226,4.649769585253456
4659165,5,B005DETYW8,"Personally, I don't see what all the fuss is about over this DVD. I loved it. At first I was apprehensive about it because I knew it was filmed along with ""It's Entertainment"" so I knew it was going to be different from what they  had done in the past and because I had read people were saying it was short (it's longer than IE by like 2 or 3 minutes) but I fell in love with it immediately. I think it is their best so far, sure it would have been nice if it had been longer but it's Celtic Thunder who wouldn't want more? I almost wish we (the fans) had been more patient with Sharon when IE came out so we could have gotten this with it as well. It is AMAZING!

In terms of the audience shots, have you even seen their Christmas and Heritage DVDs, I mean really, have you? If you had I don't think you would be complaining about the few shots at the END of the songs they have in this DVD. In those DVDs the camera points away from the guys and to the audience a whole LOT DURING the song, TMH does it too but it's no where near as bad as in their Christmas and Heritage DVDs. It's Entertainment even pans to the audience more than this DVD did.

And yeah, the ""bonus"" features are not there, the credits are more of a bonus than bonus features themselves in my opinion but all in all I give Storm a 5 out of 5.",1317254400,,1314,3.9696969696969697

4659167,2,B005DETYW8,"My mother and I are huge CT fans. We have all the cd's and dvd's and went to their concert when they came around.
I have been awaiting this set for quite a while, since they started teasing it back in 2010. Unfortunatly, It didn't meet any of my expectations. Not only was there a confusing cast (I'm still not sure who the girl in white was) where they attempted to make this love triangle, but there was no song on this set that ""Popped."" It wasn't horrible, but it certainly wasn't good. I wouldn't buy this again, and probably won't watch it twice. They failed to do their trademark song in kilts, you couldn't see the orchestra for most of it (Best part is they brought back the red head violinist. I was happy at that one) and what was it with everyone climbing the tree?

This dvd isn't horrible. It just isn't good. I'm not sad I bought it, but i won't be buying anymore to give to friends.... For all the teasing they did (they pushed back the release date from summer of 2010! It was recorded in 2009) and for being the last time we get to see the original 5 together, It was very disappointing.",1317254400,,1105,4.261904761904762
4659168,5,B005DETYW8,"I've been a Celtic Thunder fan from day one, and have all their CDs, DVDs, and attend their shows.  ""Storm"" was a departure from their usual concert-style presentation. It was made in 2009 and has just been released on DVD and CD. It's an original musical, written by Phil Coulter, with the songs tied to a loose plot.  While I recognize that people have become accustomed to the concert-type shows, this is great fun and allows the lads to try something a little out of the box.  Groups need to keep reaching and trying new things and I would love to see them try something like this again.  ""Midnight Well,"" ""Stand and Deliver"" and ""The Hero"" were standouts.",1317254400,27,660,4.567796610169491
4659169,2,B005DETYW8,"I am sorry to have to write this review, as Celtic Thunder are a wonderful, diverse group of singers who have always stood on their talent. Not so with this DVD...theatrics are NOT their forte and I'm a firm believer in doing what one does best. They don't need the bells and whistles...they need to be themselves and do what they do best...let us escape for an hour looking at their wonderful faces and listening to their incredible voices. I don't know why the females were introduced into the mix to the degree that they were. They are wonderful singers and, needless to say, lovely to look at, but they aren't ""Thunder"". Please, bring these gentlemen back to their roots and their former grandeur and leave the gypsies wandering through their own travels. This is one DVD that I will probably not watch again...although the older ones can frequently be seen on my TV. I would also like to see them come back to their roots a bit more; the Celtic influence was all but lost this time around. They have new singers who don't appear in this DVD (except for a very brief appearance by Neil Byrne, who is an excellent singer and musician), although I guess it will be last DVD with the original performers, whose loss we mourn. I hope the new singers will not be subjected to the humiliation that these gentlemen were in their last performance together. It was a sad farewell. Vaudeville died a long time ago.",1317254400,,1408,4.569169960474309
4659170,4,B005DETYW8,"I can highly recommend this DVD: the musical numbers are fun and entertaining, and the guys are at their typical charismatic best.  The only thing that made me take off one star is that there are numbers by singers other than CT where I would have preferred more by the group, and it's simply not long or complete enough.  It could  have been twice as long and it would still be terrific!  But for every CT fan, this is a must have, for great entertaining as well as the last appearances of Paul and Damian with the group.  I'll miss them.",1317168000,,539,4.297029702970297
4659171,1,B005DETYW8,I can't tell you how disappointed we were with this DVD.  We are big fans and have gone to the shows and bought the DVD's and CD's and still view them often.  We were so disappointed in this Storm that we decided we would not waste our time listening to it again and gave it to the thrift store.  Those guys are so talented and this DVD just wasn't up to the same standards as the previous ones.  We wasted our money.  SO SAD. We will not order another one.  We want to hear the Irish songs.

4659183,2,B005DETYW8,"I was very excited to watch this because I have enjoyed Celtic Thunder, THE SHOW many times and listen the CD often as I'm driving and rarely get tired of it.  I watched this 'new' one last night and quit halfway through.  The songs are 'pedestrian' and mostly unmemorable.  I did finish watching it tonight but had no spark of excitement as with THE SHOW DVD so I am returning the CD unopened.  I did enjoy the female singers and dancing but it was not the reason I bought the DVD.  This show had no closeups of the singers as they sang so I felt no interaction with them.  I did discover there were other DVDs I had not known about so I will see if I can rent them first before I spend any more money on something I will not watch again.  Damian and Keith had the most memorable number near the end.  Why they had Damian wearing rags when the gypsy dancers got such hot outfits was just such a ridiculous choice.  That is as much time as I want to spend on this review.  Rent it first and see if you enjoy it.",1316995200,,1011,4.086294416243655

4659185,1,B005DETYW8,Complete and utter crap. Celtic Thunder is at their best when they do Irish Traditional music and nothing more. I expect so much more from this group of talented individuals.  This is some lame attempt at musical theater and it's really BAD musical theater at that. If you're used to what you've seen of them on PBS you will be very disappointed by Storm.,1316995200,3,355,4.546875
4659186,2,B005DETYW8,"I didn't realize until I read the first review here that this show was filmed in 2009, although since Paul is in it, I thought it probably wasn't recent.  The sets, the showmanship, the period clothing all were good, and nothing can take away from the pure talent of Celtic Thunder.  However, I agree 100% with the first reviewer that having female vocalists in a Celtic Thunder show takes something away from it.  Dancers are all right.  I thoroughly enjoyed the go-go dancers in Keith's ""Surfing"" number in the Entertainment DVD, and even liked the Just Like Jesse James number.  But I did not enjoy the musical presentations by the women in Storm.

As far as the songs are concerned, I did not recognize any of them, and found none of them memorable.  I thought it might be because they are Irish songs and I'm in the U.S., but I have most of C.T.'s DVDs and these songs just were not up to their usual standards.

I might add, however, that now and then entertainers do try something different than their signature performances.  I am, and have been for a long time, a Josh Groban fan, but his last CD, ""Illuminations"" is, in my view, a complete disaster.  I'm hoping both J.G. and C.T. will go back to what has made us love them so much.",1316908800,25,1242,4.45575221238938
4659187,1,B005DETYW8,"First let me say all of their previous dvds are absolutely fantastic. You can't go wrong with any of them. But Storm was a huge disappointment. Instead of the previous mixtures of Irish songs and pop songs, this was apparently completely written by one person, not one song that was memorable. After watching this dvd once, I'm donating it to the local library. At least library patrons won't have wasted their money. Instead, buy any of their previous dvds--you won't be disappointed.",1316908800,5,485,4.926829268292683

4659189,3,B005DETYW8,"First, let me say that I am a Celtic Thunder fan and remain a CT fan. That being said, I was left feeling less than enthusiasic about this performance. I wanted so badly to like it, but found myself wishing that I had that last hour of my life back.

I am torn because the guys are so talented and I really enjoyed Heritage, and am looking forward to seeing them live, but I was dissapointed in this one. I thought the lip syncing was pretty poor and I am not sure how I feel about the women having major roles. I get the story and understand why, but Charly Bird is such a gifted singer that I felt the woman lip syncing her didn't do her justice at all. Over all I thought it was kind of cheesy.

I would say to someone who has just discovered Celtic Thunder and not familiar with Heritage to start there. If this was the first performance I saw I might not have been so impressed with the group and discovered that all the guys are gifted muscians independently of CT.

And Neil, where is Neil? He's on the cover, but very limited in the DVD. He is an amazing muscian. Okay, maybe this was filmed before he had a major role in the group, but don't put him on the cover if he isn't a bigger player. Kind of false advertising.

I really can't put my finger on why I didn't care for it. I will say my four year old daughter enjoyed it and was dancing around the house imitating Ryan's moves.

If you are a fan, buy the DVD and come to your own conclusion. I am sure there are tons of people who will think this is fantastic. Sadly, I am not one of them.",1316822400,,1553,4.062091503267974
4659190,5,B005DETYW8,"Just finished watching Storm.
I have three words to describe this production.
Enchanted, Breathtaking, Perfection.
Looking forward to 'Voyage"" next Spring!",1316736000,2,155,6.428571428571429
4659191,5,B005DETYW8,"""Celtic Thunder: Storm"" is actually a bit different from other Celtic performances that I have seen.  The whole show on the DVD is presented as a sort of a musical story/drama.  There's no dialogue, only singing and stylized dancing, fighting, romances, and other scenes.  All 16 songs are contained within the framework of this musical story/drama.

At first, you may not be used to this style and may not like it.  I personally found the show interesting, sort of like watching a live action musical, with a twist of mixing legend and history.

Spoiler Alert: Stop and don't read any further if you don't want know anymore.

*****************************************************************************

Here's the story.  Invaders attack and rob a village and their treasure chest.  There's tussling and fighting as the villagers repel the group of invaders.

The set has domiciles and a large crumbling wall.  There's a bridge and trees.  People, both men and women, wear vaguely native/traditional/historical clothes or costumes which may be loosely identified as Celtic/British/Gypsy.

Both the men and the women sing.  In the romance area, there is ""tension"" and certain scenes which most people are comfortable with and some may be less so comfortable.

Everyone stays within his or her character.

Here is a list of the major characters.

George Donaldson:  The Head Villager
Ryan Kelly: The Gypsy King
Keith Harkin:  The Highwayman
Damian McGuinty: The Young Buck
Deirdre Shannon:  The Gentlewoman
Paul Byrom: The Landowner's Son
Ruth O'Leary:  The Chief's Daughter
Caroline Torti:  The Gypsy King's Sister

The ninth song, Lagan Love, is done well, with parts contributed by a few of the men.  Wish that they could have lengthened that song.

Here's the set list.

Storm Overture
New Day Dawning
Outside Looking In
When You Are 18
