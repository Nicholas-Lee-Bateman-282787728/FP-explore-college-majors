7969356,2,B00005ICG7,"People who enjoyed the 2000 Titans Team video will be disappointed in the latest one. This year's edition runs only 23 minutes, and doesnt have the player interviews that the last edition did. Several games are skipped over completely, and generally it takes a cursory look at the season without really providing any insight. Granted, we didn't have a playoff run or a Super Bowl to highlight this year, but I hardly think this short video is worth the price.",996451200,,459,4.75
