5084060,4,B007FZ7NEE,"All right, maybe Chicago had more ""fire in the belly"" 20 years ago (or 40!). Fair argument. Altogether, that's another subject. But, technically, this is the best-sounding live Chicago product to date encompassing all the necessary hit classics from one of America's great bands. The PBS ""Soundstage"" video probably compares favorably. But this one is 94 minutes in length with bonus material, which includes an interview with founding bandmembers as well as the current bandmates.

Don't hesitate to purchase 'Chicago In Chicago.' HDNet aired this performance late last year. The blu-ray release brings an expected top-notch sound -- uncompressed PCM stereo or else 5.1 DTS HD Master Audio. The mix is excellent and vocals are spot on. Even for the most dedicated Chicago fan, there is the occasional musical nuance brought out here that may get lost in a live-concert setting.

Overall, while the setlist could be better, it's as good as you'll get given the band's long run and surplus of hit songs... starting with the entire ""Ballet"" (For a Girl in Buchannon), which of course opens with the band's first No. 1 single ""Make Me Smile."" And, while saxaphonist Walt Parazaider still is a familiar face in the signature horn section, on this particular night Mr. Ray Hermann brings a lot to the table. He has his own style, but he fits in perfectly, never missing an attack or release.

Would have given this a ""5-star"" rating"" had it included something more obscure from the Chicago catalog... be it a medley of early material or a single rarely-performed tune as a bonus track. Next time, maybe.",1339286400,64,1598,4.955223880597015
5084061,4,B007FZ7NEE,"I am glad I saw this high-def concert video on HDNet last December (and currently showing regularly on DishTV's channel 102).  Robert Lamm still sounds great when he is singing his classic songs, ""Saturday in the Park"", ""Does Anybody Know What Time It is"" and ""Beginnings.""  And the trombone/trumpet ""duel"" in ""Beginnings"" between Jimmy Pankow and Lee Loughnane still blows me away every time.  And the finale of ""25 or 6 to 4"" is enhanced with the enthusiastic participation of the entire Doobie Brothers band.  Of course, Peter Cetera and Terry Kath are always missed -- but it has been 27 and 34 years respectively since  they were in Chicago!  The great songs are still there.  A video cannot replicate the excitement of being at the show itself, but this is still worthwhile.  After all these years, Chicago still enjoys themselves on stage and you can see it in this show.  My only criticisms of this product are 1) Having an audience member attempt to sing ""If You Leave Me Now"" as part of a noble charitable cause; and 2) The absence of founding member Walter Parazaider on saxophone at this show.  Walt's substitute does a fine job, and I am okay with him taking some time off, but if Chicago is putting out a DVD/Blu-Ray, then why not make sure that it is a show where the four remaining founding members are there? However, before I buy this product, I would want to know that there is something more than what I already saw on TV and have since saved on my DVR.  If you are a fan and haven't seen this show, I recommend its purchase!",1338336000,30,1545,4.5215827338129495
5084062,1,B007FZ7NEE,"Set list hasn't changed for the last 20 years.  What was once probably the greatest band to go see live has now become a cover band of itself (and there are better ones out there) and a mockery of anything they once said they stood for.  A totally phoned in performance.

A much better deal is to get the '93 Live At The Greek video which showcases them when they still had some fire in their bellies.",1337126400,14,401,4.181818181818182
5084063,4,B007FZ7NEE,"In response to Ego, who gave it a one star, despite not seeing the video, and obviously has an ego problem, I have seen this video on Directv.  This is a concert that was made im Chicago in 2010 and yes, with the Doobie Brothers.  If anyone knows anything about Chicago summer concerts, they tour with another famous band and at the beginning and/or end, both groups go on stage together and belt out a few songs as an encore.  This video is just the Chicago portion of the concert and the Chicago songs performed with the Doobies for the encore.
Four of the original band members have been together for 45 years and they have numerous hits, so why would they have a concert with all new music?  New music to any band over the age of 25 does not sell anymore.  This concert showcased the talents of the two newest members, Lou Pardini and Drew Hester.  Bill Champlin is missed, but the band has survived the losses of Terry Kath and Peter Cetera and has continued to thrive.  The highlight of the video is the duel drum solo.  The low point of the video is the fact that they only play about one-third of my favorite song, Feelin' Stronger Every Day, which they did that year to fit in most of their songs.
This would be a five star review but the encore with the Doobies was nothing compared to the concert with Earth Wind and Fire.  I guess that is why the whole concert is not shown.",1333497600,44,1386,4.3
5084064,1,B007FZ7NEE,"Gosh this is a shocker - I can understand fans loving the music and the concert but please don't let this be how Chicago are remembered  - 1969-1972 they were untouchable Terry Kath was the soul of the band and now we have this end of pier show.

I'm heading off to Wolfgang' Vault to see the band in all their pomp around 1970 with Kath & Lamm tearing through their first 2 records. After 42 years this footage is the real Chicago - innovative & exciting. Just watch Terry Kath guitar work and vocals - as Robert Lamm said many years ago 'Chicago died when Terry died'.",1332979200,5,570,4.268518518518518

5084083,2,B007FZ7NEE,"Was looking forward to seeing this Concert on Blu-ray after I received it.  To be honest, my wife and I are used to top-notch performers such as The Eagles (1st Farewell Tour), Phil Collins, Sade, U2, and even America (yes, they can still bring it!).  We started the disc and after the first song or two we kinda looked at each other with that ""Oh, brother, not so good"" look.  The sound quality was lacking (poor production) and the vocals were average at best.  They were trying to be energetic and all, but did not sound that great (sorry! just being real here!).  At one point, it looks like someone's mother/grandmother got on stage (very nervously) to sing a song.  Bless her effort, but NOT what you want to hear when you pay for a concert/disc!  We turned it off after that, and watched Phil Collins again.",1508803200,2,814,4.496598639455782

5084114,3,B007FZ7NEE,"I love Chicago and that has not changed over 50 years.  I have to say that I am very surprised, even back in 2012 when sound technology was very good, that this production had terrible sound quality.  Perhaps the original live master was done poorly or perhaps it was just a poor job of producing the DVD.  The sound mix was frequently so bad it hurt to hear that great music ruined.  The video quality was okay, but not very good and, yes, some of the vocals showed age.  Who doesn't age after 50 years?  It was still great to see the group playing live.

I did enjoy the interview and especially the comments by the 'newer' band members.  They seem like a great bunch of guys who might actually get along well.  During the interview the three originals showed there very real human side, they even had different recollections of the same early days events, just like my friends and I disagree about how or where something occurred!  I hope the group can continue to perform into the future even if some member parts have to be replaced over time.  The music is just too good to slide exclusively to classic radio!  Warts and all, there is nothing like a live performance from your favorite musical group, whoever they might be.

The instrumentals sound just like the old days....but as soon as the lyrics start to flow - it's like a really bad karaoke night. I've seen them in concert 5 times or more - starting in 1974 - 1998.

5084134,3,B007FZ7NEE,"Meh! Big fan here and a musician, trumpet to be precise. Overall the band is good as always! The low end is solid as I have a 7.2 system with large towers and 2 subs (SVS). My complaint is the mix on the voices has them out there in front rather naked and exposing their inconsistencies as a vocal group live which is no secret. Also, the horn mix should be more in the sides and the rears. Most everything is coming out of the front soundstage with little to no separation. Why do 5.1 if you don't mix it that way? You can bet on crowd noise from the surrounds for sure! The mix on the ""Live at the Greek Theater"" w/EWF absolutely blows this away if your looking for a sound mix top to bottom.",1485043200,3,694,4.072992700729927

5084136,3,B007FZ7NEE,Chicago with EWF at the Greek Theater in 2004 is by far the best Chicago DVD. Chicago in Chicago  was disappointing with a new member doing songs  Jason Scheff  did in the past like (Call on me).

5084137,5,B007FZ7NEE,"The first time I saw the group Chicago they were then known as the Chicago Transit Authority (before CTA sued them for using the name).  That was at a friday night quarter concert (yes, you read that correctly the concert was 25 cents) back in 1967 on the University of Pittsburgh campus where I was an undergraduate.  The band has aged in the intervening nearly 50 years since that concert but the sound is still great!  If you're a fan of Chicago I would heartily recommend this disc!",1482364800,,486,4.5

5084145,1,B007FZ7NEE,"You really have to love this band to consider this concert DVD good.  The presentation is wan, completely lacking in musical muscle and the audience on hand contributes nothing to the show.  Allowing a contest winner to sing is more Gong Show than a memorable moment and I challenge you not to cringe throughout her performance.  Having the Doobie Brothers on the card doesn't even save the concert.  If anything, the presence of the Doobies only accentuates how poorly the members of Chicago translate to today's standards.  You'll get more enjoyment out of listening to your local classic rock station and waiting for 25 or 6 to 4 to play.",1471392000,3,641,4.790909090909091

I saw them live in concert my senior year of high school, and then saw them again a bit less than three years ago, and they still kick you-know-what.  I bought this hoping that the concert experience would transfer.  I love the combination of Chicago and the Doobie Brothers, but this did have its drawbacks.  I think the production quality was substandard.  I see other reviewers saying the opposite, but really, the sound was terrible.  And please, guys, never have an audience member sing my second-favorite Chicago song, ever again.  She was terrible.  In fairness, had I been on the same stage with Bobby Lamm, I wouldn't have been able to breathe much less sing, but still...yikes.

However, the audio is mixed in a way that makes the horn line sound like it's in the background, even when they play by themselves on solos. The guitar and vocals even get overshadowed by the drums. With most concerts, the vocals and/or solo instruments are a bit louder than than everyone else.

The clarity of the sound is very tight. So, the drums sound great. One of the best parts about Chicago is the horn line (to me). If you want to hear their great sound, don't buy this recording.

Overall, the sound mix ruins things for what appears to be a decent performance and very good video quality. I regret this purchase. Wish I could send it back.",1404259200,5,776,4.535714285714286

5084238,3,B007FZ7NEE,"Chicago is my favorite band.  I've seen them in concert six times, including 2010, the year represented here.

The sound quality here is fine, but this DVD has some flaws.

First of all, it includes the one track that didn't work on the tour: the Chicago 17 Medley.  The arrangement is disjointed and just doesn't come off well.

Another problem is that Chicago's performance here is good, but not very inspired.  All of the concerts I've seen shows them in  a better light than this DVD does.

Also: no Walt Parazaider.  While Ray Herman does a good job, I think they should have used a performance with Parazaider playing the woodwinds instead.

My main problem, though, is that this should have been a 2 disk set, like the one with Earth, Wind and Fire from 2005.  It would have been nice to see the Doobie Brothers do their full set too.

Some people may also miss Bill Champlin, who left the band one year before this tour happened.  I think Lou Pardini, his successor, does a wonderful job here, even taking over some of Peter Cetera's old songs from Jason Scheff.

Overall, this DVD is okay, but could have been better.  I give it a mild recommendation.",1400889600,,1160,4.536231884057971
5084239,4,B007FZ7NEE,"I was sad to see only two original members of the band on this release. Both were horn players if that tells you anything. They should have let the new bassist sing most parts and stuffed a cork in the keyboardist who often sang off key. But as concerts of bands this old, it is a fair performance. I think DTS and blu-ray have somewhat spoiled me rotten. There are a few bands out there that get it 100% right.....and that spoils us for the rest.",1399334400,,447,4.209302325581396

5084242,1,B007FZ7NEE,"Music was just ok.  Some of the songs sounded like classic Chicago, but most of them sounded like cheap knock-offs with replacement singers.  Peter Cetera was palpably missing.

The guitarist/lead vocalist has a REALLY painful, whiny, pitchy voice.  The trombone player doesn't realize he's a septuagenarian and was over the top with his unbuttoned shirts and attempts at dancing.

Video production was horrendous.  It was as if the camera crew and producers didn't rehearse at all with the band, or even talk to them before the concert. It was as if they didn't know what was going on.  On one song the guitarist was singing, but the camera didn't find him until probably 2 minutes into the song.  Other times the camera shots switched every second or so which made me nauseous (although it may have been from the singing as well).

I grew up listening to Chicago and had my hopes really high for this, but was completely disappointed.  If you want to see a concert for a group that has not lost their talent and a video with impeccable production value, get the Eagles Farewell I tour on blu ray.  I ordered it with the Chicago concert.  Maybe I wouldn't have hated this one so much if I hadn't watched the Eagles first.",1395100800,17,1222,4.632558139534884

5084244,3,B007FZ7NEE,"I have loved Chicago for years, and even later years. But this has jumped the shark. The departure of Bill Champlin is definitely a negative in my opinion. His replacement is subpar to say the least. Then there is the fact the Jason Scheff doesn't even sing lead on the songs he would have previously. Songs like Old Days and Call On Me are sung by other members of the band now and are worse off for it. And don't get me started on the butchered version of If You Leave Me Now that was totally ruined by some audience member that could not even sing in tune. I understand the sentiment that she paid to do it and it went to charity, but I don't think it should have been on a bluray. And what is up with Chicago filming shows when all of their regular members aren't in attendance? They did this before on Live At The Greek Theatre in the 90's when Lee was replaced by someone else.

5084264,1,B007FZ7NEE,"Per the Editorial Review written by someone at Image Entertainment or CBS, this is stated as ""the legendary band Chicago triumphantly returns to its namesake town.""
Truth is, that's a sales pitch.
Two members of the band return, the rest were just picked up along the way, be it some years ago or recently.

Right from the beginning, the off key performance is heard during what fans know as ""Ballet For A Girl In Buchannon"" but casual fans and rock radio listeners know as ""Make Me Smile"" - long version.
The singing is often too high or somewhere close, but not usually on key at all.
The lazy horn playing, or perhaps lack of the energy needed is obvious too often.
Video to Audio sync is never there.

It's sad to see the rock Gods fade away and die, but that's a fact of life.

If you want to hear a time when this band was intact and in their prime - long before the middle-of-the-road love songs mush, pick up:
Chicago IV - also known as Chicago: At Carnegie Hall.
Originally, it was a live 4 LP set from 1972 when vinyl was the main media source, and for these days, Rhino issued it on CD that has been remastered.

That's something for the achives of this bands history, not this.

Also, you should know that the live concert from 1972 has a few spots with swearing.
""I don't care"" becomes ""I don't give a s***"" during the song, but then again, only Barbra Streisand and the upcoming Bee Gees and Barry Manilow said ""oh, gosh"" and ""my Heavens"" in those days.",1364774400,5,1467,4.358974358974359

Each show is like I'm seeing it for the very first time.  The music is classic and timeless and I never tire of it.  There are 8-9 band members on stage at one time and each one is doing their own thing.  It's hard to see everything; which is why I love this DVD.  It features many of the Chicago tunes that I grew up on and then some. I get to see each band member close up and in action. The videography is crisp and clear and the sound is without complaint.  There's nothing that I didn't like about the ""Chicago in Chicago"" DVD. Die-hard fans will love it because they will re-live a past concert.  This DVD is also a perfect introduction for those who have never seen the band live or are just getting into their music.

5084307,5,B007FZ7NEE,Chicago in Chicago proves that the band Chicago is the best there is America has to offer....as opposed to their gutter politicians....,1342310400,,135,5.181818181818182
5084308,2,B007FZ7NEE,"First, I want to preface that I absolutely LOVE Chicago. From CTA through Chicago XXX, I love the albums and I love the band. When Bill Champlin came onboard, I became a huge Champlin fan. I accepted Jason Scheff and I enjoyed the Terry Kath-guitarisms of Keith Howland. Seen the band in concert many times and embrace their new recordings, Christmas albums, and everything else they do. Lou Pardini and Drew Hester are nice additions to the band.

But 30-plus years down the road, is Chicago STILL a real vital band? Or are we seeing a group of, essentially, senior citizens reliving their glory days and getting paid handsomely to do it? Robert Lamm, Lee Loughnane and Jimmy Pankow are the only originals on-stage for this concert (Walt Parazadier sitting this show out with a sub in his place....much better player too, I might add). Everyone else is a replacement, and in Lou Pardini's case, a replacement for a replacement of a replacement (Paridini in for Champlin who was in for Donnie Dacus who was in for Terry Kath).

You might still argue that this is FINE. But where I really quibble is with the lead vocals on the songs. It seems like EVERYONE is singing lead these days. Robert Lamm, Jason Scheff, and Lou Pardini I can handle. (basically the Lamm, Cetera and Kath songs). But Lee Loughnane taking the mic now? And Keith Howland? And whereas it used to be that Scheff would have been the obvious choice to sing the Cetera songs (since he was brought on to replace Cetera), now we have those vocals being coverd by others too?

Seems to me like Chicago has become a live karaoke band. And although sweet, having the winner of the Breast Cancer fundraising contest sing ""If You Leave Me Now"" only helps confirm that thought, or at least make Chicao look lke a hired band at someone's wedding where Aunt Flo gets to come up to the mic.

So instead of Jason Scheff singing all the Peter Cetera-vocals songs, we now have this:
1.  Call On Me:  Lou Pardini
2.  Old Days:  Keith Howland
3.  Feeling Stronger Every Day: Keith Howland

Instead of having Lou Pardini sing all the Terry Kath-vocals songs, we now have:
1.  Colour My Word: Lee Loughnane (????)
2.  I'm A Man: Robert Lamm

Perhaps this keeps it interesting for the band? My main objection though is Keith Howland. Backup vocals are fine, but Howland's voice is not strong enough to be a lead vocal. I'm not a huge fan of Jason Scheff (he strains and pushes too much), but Howland is amateurish at best. Try suffering through his labored take on ""Old Days"".",1341532800,11,2524,4.582222222222223

It took me a few years to realize that this was actually practiced in the repertoire. Pankow keeps flexing, Lee rises his hands in the air after his trompet-solo, and at the end of the concert it looks like a mental hospital has entered the stage (w/ Doobie brothers).

5084313,4,B007FZ7NEE,"This is a great sounding and great looking DVD.  The band sounds at the top of its game,  and as far as I can tell,  there is not a ton of post production overdubs or fixes.  Sorry Walt couldn't be there for the taping,  although Ray Hermann does a fine job.  One minor issue:  quite a bit of the audio is slightly out of sync with the video,  but not a big deal",1339804800,6,362,3.863013698630137
5084314,3,B007FZ7NEE,"The  band is missing Walt Parazaider on sax here. I don't know who the replacement guy was, and he played well but wouldn't you think they would make sure Walt was available ?

I thought the vocals were off in comparison to 2009 recording done in Nashville.

I have seen Chicago live 3 times now, in 2010, 2011, and  2012. I thought each live show was better than this DVD.

Also, there is no Doobie Brother performance on this DVD.

It's great that this band is still playing more than 40 years after its first album, Chicago Transit Auhority. This DVD is not the best, and this from a Chicago fan for life who owns almost every recording they have ver made.",1339804800,8,659,4.360655737704918
5084315,5,B007FZ7NEE,"This long concert has a heavy emphasis on musical instruments.  It almost feels like one long jam session with all the instruments going.  The music warms up slowly, but it gets better as you dig deeper into this hour and a half concert.
