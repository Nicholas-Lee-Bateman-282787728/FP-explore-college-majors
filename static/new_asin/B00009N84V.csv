7999227,5,B00009N84V,Another purchase for my niece and bit for myself - I remember watching these on PBS after school or on the weekends. Such a cute show - wish they would release the entire show - but I have gotten almost all of the DVD's with 2-3 episodes on it. She loves Junior - which McKinley reminds me of; enthusiastic little kid energy.,1458086400,,325,4.258064516129032

7999231,4,B00009N84V,A great DVD with three really good episodes of George Shrinks and a bonus episode of Seven Little Monsters. I wish this show was still being made. We own all of the DVD's that are available.,1318291200,,190,4.305555555555555
