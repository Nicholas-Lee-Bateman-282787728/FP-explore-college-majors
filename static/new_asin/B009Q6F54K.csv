5360924,5,B009Q6F54K,"I admit I was a little perplexed at the title of this show, as it seems to have 3 names depending on where you look. The English title 'Bodacious Space Pirates' ('bodacious' apparently being a mixture of 'bold' and 'audacious' which hails from the southern states of the US), then the original Japanese title of 'Minisuka Pairtsu' (literally 'Mini-skirted Pirates') and the 'alternative' Japanese title of 'Mretsu Pairtsu' or 'Fierce Pirates'. All very confusing!

Coming back to the series itself, I found it to be light-hearted, great fun, and thoroughly enjoyable; the characters are great, with the star, Captain Marika Kato, a somewhat ditsy high school girl, finding that she has been left her late fathers pirate spaceship, the Bentenmaru, with a condition that she must continue to ply its trade as a working pirate vessel, or its pirates license will expire! She and her friends live on a planet in the Tau Ceti star system, and the high school she attends has a so-called Yacht Club, which has its own old ex-pirate spaceship, a solar sailor (yes, it has 'sails' of sorts!) called the Odette 2. Both ships are beautifully drawn in CG, and seem quite believable. The crew of the Bentenmaru don't know what to make of their new captain to begin with, but soon find her to be a chip off the old block, and a very capable ship's captain. The series follows the adventures of the Bentenmaru, their friends from the Yacht Club, and another ship called the Barbarossa, which is captained by Marika's friend Chiaki Kurihara, whom Marika insists on calling Chiaki-chan, much to her dismay! Add into the mix a couple of teenage princesses (literally!) and there is bound to be mayhem! There are too many characters to list here, but the series is great, and well worth a watch.

Amazon says the series has only a Japanese soundtrack, but it doesn't; it has a full English dub as well. The music is great too, being a sort of mix of j-pop and Celtic (Irish/Scottish) influences. I tried to get the soundtrack on CD, but there doesn't seem to be one; shame!

A really good series, and well worth it for the price!",1368489600,,2111,4.715447154471545
5360925,2,B009Q6F54K,The show itself is very good and gets 4 stars. But seriously? almost $60 for only 13 episodes is absolutely ridiculous. No wonder internet piracy is so rampant.,1360195200,,160,4.75
5360926,5,B009Q6F54K,"This Review is of the original Japanese version of Bodacious Space Pirates (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bodacious-Space-Pirates/dp/B009Q6F54K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bodacious Space Pirates</a>) currently airing on the Anime Network's[...] Video On Demand(Cable/Sat) and also On Line(Subscription service), as of today Jan 31,2013 they are at Episode 20(Sailing as it called in the series,title appears at the end of the episode).

I agree with most of the other reviews in that this is a wonderful series,it has its humorist spots and its action is very good,I like the theme music and the visuals and the Futuristic Sci-Fi elements of it.

In searching for it I found out that it is available in a Hybrid(Dub/Sub) format,I like the fact that it is available as DVD or Blu-Ray not as combo pack as is the case with a lot of titles released by Funimation.com, because if you don't have a Blu-Ray Player and an HD TV you wind up buying discs you can't watch just to purchase the series.

I think that the use of the Girls of the Yacht Club is very good particularly on the Odette II training cruise and then during the episodes when the Main crew of the Bentenmaru comes down with virus and are quarantined  and Marika has to find  a replacement crew in order to keep her Pirates license valid, and ends up having the Girls of the Yacht Club help her out on a couple of raids (Cos-play Pirates).

The Friendship between Marika,Chiaki(Daughter of another Space Pirate),her friend and Classmate Mami(who works with her at the Lamp House Cafe) and the two Princess of Serenity is very good and really makes the series as it goes along,they appear together in the closing animation.

Watching the girls learn to operate the Bentenmaru with the help of the hospitalized main crew(putting together a Manual on operating the ship on the fly) and sending it via their Insurance agent to Marika and the girls.

Then during all this Marika gets a request for a job from Lynn the current president of the Yacht Club to help Jenny the former president out of an arraigned marriage(as it turns out the two girls are lovers) and get her to Space University and in the process uncover corruption on the part of Jenny's Uncle in the family company with a few tense moments during all this as they try to outrun and get a leg up on the Uncle and the corporate fleet he is commanding that is after the Bentamaru and all that ensues in the process of doing just that.

Another interesting part of this series in the early part of it we see that two of the Bridge Crew Misa
the Ships Doctor and  Kane the Helmsmen of the Bentenmaru work as the School Nurse and as a Teacher and the Yacht Club's adviser (respectively)keeping watch over Marika while she is making up her mind about becoming the Captain of the Bentenmaru and a Space Pirate.

Watching Marika as she balances being High School Student and a Space Pirate Captain at the same time and all her adventures are part of makes this series so interesting and fun to watch.

If you like this kind of series, then you'll love this series,it's fun to watch with good music and great animation.",1359590400,,3170,4.775137111517368
5360927,4,B009Q6F54K,"Marika is a pretty average high school gal. She is a member of the school yacht club and she works part time at a cafe called Lamp House. One day she finds out that the Father she never met has died from food poisoning. What's more, he was a pirate ship captain. It is tradition that the captain's position was taken over by his oldest child. So now, Marika has to choose whether to be a space pirate or to keep on living her quiet life. She has a very interesting experience on a yacht club cruise, and decides to add pirating to her busy schedule.

After barely getting settled into her new position, she gets a stowaway aboard her ship, The Bentenmaru. Her stowaway is a royal princess. Princess Gruier from the Serenity Planet System has a job for the Bentenmaru. Find a ghost ship that has been causing some trouble for the Serenity military. This job is a little fishy. There seems to be some strange behavior from the Serenity Royal Court and the military. Marika and her crew may be in over their heads.

This series is a lot of fun. It has great animation, voice acting, soundtracks; lots of cool characters, plenty of action, and some comedy. Many series nowadays rely on fan service and perverted situations to keep people interested. This series surprisingly doesn't have any of that so far. I'm not knocking that stuff, but I had the impression that this was gonna be that kind of show; given the name of the series and the product description.

This anime is well thought out. The backdrop is a really giant interstellar world, with lot's of history, nations, and possibilities. The production quality is top notch, as I mentioned before. There are lots of great voice talents. Luci Christian, Chris Patton, Hilary Haag, Monica Rial, and Brittney Karbowski are all among my favorite voice actors, and play major roles in this series. I must admit that I didn't expect too much substance from this anime. I have actually used my brain a little bit while watching. the story and mystery are pretty interesting and kept me wanting more.

I think that this anime will probably get even better in the 2nd volume that comes out in a couple months. I'm looking forward to it, and I think that most every anime fan will enjoy Bodacious Space Pirates. I highly recommend it and I hope you enjoy it.",1357948800,15,2303,4.58252427184466
5360928,5,B009Q6F54K,"On a future world where space travel is common, a high school girl named Marika Kato discovers her father has died. She also learns that he was a space pirate, and that she must take over his ship and crew. Her mother has groomed her all her life for this, and combined with her natural talent and hands-on experience through her school's yacht club, she actually gives it a shot. It turns out she's very good at it...which is good because they have to engage in privateering at regular times to retain their official letter of marque that sanctions their livelihood. But she also wants to graduate from high school, so she has to juggle two sets of responsibilities as best she can: one set as a civilian student; the other as a pirate captain.

While the weird anime fixation on high schoolers doing unbelievable stuff continues here, it makes it fun and engaging. It starts with likeable characters, from the lead to her crew to her classmates. Even though the piracy is sanctioned and largely benevolently applied (they often raid cruise ships who request them to do so as a show for their guests), there are regularly developing dangers for Marika to overcome on the job while she gets a handle on things...all while maintaining her grades, club activities, and part-time job on the ground.

The visuals are animated quite well for a television series, with nice ship design and character art. Although most of the girls sort of blur together to start with due to numbers, they begin to be used more towards the end of the run, so it's not a problem. If you're wondering, there's not a lot of fan-service here, which is appropriate for the majority of ages depicted, so don't look to this show for that.

I didn't expect to care for this series too much, but I really enjoyed it and look forward to it continuing. They are making a movie to expand on the conclusion, and I hope it proves successful enough that they shoot for a second season.

TL;DR version: Bodacious Space Pirates is a whole lot of fun. Highly recommended.

P.S. I find the Editorial Review for this series to be a gross mischaracterization of the series. The first two paragraphs aren't bad, despite a bit of exaggeration regarding a minor plot point. But the last line? ""Sexiest pirate's chest ever""? In case you are wondering, the main character is a 15 year old girl. This otaku-flavored dreck is a disservice both to casual browser who might be put off by such objectification, and to actual perverts whose sad interest would lead only to disappointment.",1357776000,18,2533,4.683146067415731
5360929,3,B009Q6F54K,"But gets a little unbalanced after halfway. When this series starts it has a lot going for it. One of the best theme songs and a space pirate storyline. The show begins very slow and sets up a rich backstory set in a universe after a great war happened where pirates roamed freely. The perils of space travel are apparent and the show, while SciFi, tries to remain grounded in reality to a degree. It is an odd play on things. But unfortunately, the show doesn't remain there. Where this show really could pick up and get good, it squanders and flounders about with moronic side stories and a poor supporting cast.

Till about halfway of this show, it will have you hooked well. The potential of the universe it is set in is huge. While being a mostly all female cast anime, it doesn't screw it up much till then. But then this show suffers. It starts to bring in wild ideas and it goes into story arcs which just fit girls into silly costumes and have no real point. This series goes to great lengths to build a serious atmosphere, then ruins it by making it too lighthearted.

Unfortunately this is why all girl anime shows generally aren't that good. They always suffer from the same issues. Symphogear is another great example. The background and story behind it all is good, but the characters are just beyond generic. You can predict it and they spoil the potential of the show. Scenes that can be used for rich character building moments are generally lighthearted and silly. Even if horrific battles happen, characters rarely die.

In the end, Bodacious Space Pirates delivers a good opening and a very memorable theme song. But it's potential bottoms out towards the end. It is worth a watch, but by the end, you might just stop caring. I personally, cared more about the events that happened before this show than I did for Marika. The backstory involving the war seems so much richer than this show. Overall this is interesting till you realize they are not real pirates. These are just entertainers. The final nemesis doesn't really fit the universe as it is set up in the beginning and isn't that interesting. It wraps everything up in a nice neat girly style ready for another school day *rolleyes*.

3 stars is harsh but 4 stars is a bit too generous for this. The show fits between the two. It was good enough to have me anxiously waiting each week for a new episode. But the faults that appeared later in the series completely undid that feeling by the end. Give it a shot, rent it if you can. You might like it. I'm just giving you a heads up to not judge the second half based on the premise of the first half.",1356220800,10,2629,4.482254697286012
5360930,5,B009Q6F54K,"The story evolves around a teenage girl who one day is all of a sudden faced with the decision whether she wants to take on her deceased father's job as a captain of a pirate cruiser or if she wants to remain an honor student at an elite high school. She takes on her father's job and becomes a so called legal pirate.

There are some enjoyable characters in this show but all in all you have your stereotypical Japanese anime characters. The main protagonist has deeper emotions and ambitions. She is talented and a born captain. You do get pumped up when the opening starts playing and it's possible to ride that high for a little while. But, eventually, you either enjoy the events that are unfolding or you don't. The important thing is that you want to stick around long enough to find out whether you'll like it or not. Sometimes, you get bored out of your skull. Other times, you're hooked from beginning to end. That inconsistency can easily threaten your enjoyment of the show. You have your typical anime stereotypical relationships.

The Anime has very pretty visuals, from the shots of Marika's Elaborate University High to all the little things like the omnipresent computer displays that float in the air wherever they might be summoned. The bridge crew of the Bentenmaru are all unique, each with their own quirks and all with very nice character designs that set them apart from each other

 This series is likely to be high on nearly everyone's list of anime that they've enjoyed. Moretsu Pirates/Bodacious Space Pirates is going to be around for awhile, and not watching this series is missing out on something that kicked off the 2012 anime season. Likable characters, carefree and enjoyable story, with a lot of action and nicely done artwork and visuals. Even the side characters are alive and enjoyable.

 Overall quite a fun series, also there Movie is planned coming soon for this series due 2013",1350864000,18,1920,4.7507507507507505
5360931,3,B009Q6F54K,"First of all, I don't hate this series, but it could have been so much more. A high school girl, Marika Katou, discovers her father, captain of the pirate ship Bentenmaru, has died recently, and she must make the decision whether or not to become a pirate as well. They're actually privateers, or ""pirates sanctioned by a government to pirate"", but for all intents and purposes, are professional space pirates.

The pirating part is actually more like a scripted event. The pirates ""attack"" a cruiser carrying passengers, then the pirates put on an elaborate display and ""loot"" things from the people. But anything the people give up is covered by an insurance company which compensates them for it, and the people get to experience a pirating show/event, to which some people even cheer when they see the pirates show up. The ""letters of marque"" the pirates use are also only good for 50 days, meaning they have to do a pirate job at least once every two months or so, or else they lose the privilege to do so. This does cause some issues during the show as Marika tries to balance her job and her school life.

I was amazed how they try to stick to real world physics as much as possible, such as two characters mentioning how well she pulls off difficult flying maneuvers in the first episode. And the combat scenes, when they have them, are pretty interesting as well, such as Marika utilizing a ship's solar panels into a makeshift weapon, using it as a magnifying glass to focus intense sunlight onto an enemy ship to fry their optical sensors, but not long enough to melt their ship in the process.

The first few episodes are pretty good, then it sort of peters out until the last few episodes, where the danger and excitement ramps up again to make it much more dramatic and enjoyable to watch.

One problem I had with the show is that some of the problems she faces are resolved much too easily, particularly halfway through the season. For example, in one episode they set out to rescue a friend in danger, only for said friend to have escaped on their own and even made their way towards Marika's ship. Things like this really sap the tension out of the drama in these scenes, and what makes it worse is that Marika has little to no input on these issues getting resolved. There's a reason why a lot of shows often make the hero really work for their victories, however little it may be. That's not to say Marika never faces any danger or problems, just that she only really has to face them in the beginning and in the end of the season.

I also must add, the opening credit song is kind of nice to listen to, but the closing credits are really awesome. It's also interesting that as things change in the show, the credits will change slightly to reflect on that, such as a new character being added, or changes to Marika's pirate outfit.",1350864000,13,2851,4.506769825918762

5360937,1,B009Q6F54K,"I like space, I like pirates ..... this show has neither!

This is a teen drama attempting to veil itself into  a SPACE PIRATE ADVENTURE!!!
Hell Tenchi Muyo:GXP had more to do with Space and Pirates than this crapfest.

So the developers of this show clearly doesn't understand what a letter of marque means.  YOU ARE NOT A PIRATE YOU ARE A LICENSED PRIVATEER which is hilarious because at the start they explain with the Letter is but then ignore it.  But I digress, this show starts off with a teenage girl learning she is the daughter of a famous Pirate and she inherits his ship and title.  But since she has no skills she has to learn.  This is where the show goes off the rails into stupidville.  She has to pirate ships and on the side attend school .... which they announce to the galaxy where she is attending soooooo anyone wanting retribution for her actions could easily find her (see what happens to Tony Stark in Iron Man 3 when he announces where he lives) But fear not, since the creator of this series has no idea what space and pirates are all about NOTHING ENSUES.  Seriously, when she robs someone just just docks and says give me all your stuff and leaves.  No combat, no space combat, ALL DRAMA and no payoff.

This was a blind buy on my part.  Just a random stab into the anime world to see what I get.  I got burned on this one. I recommend Tenchi Muyo GXP as a better story, characters, space battles, pirates, and hell the obligitory fan service.",1382140800,,1472,4.367647058823529

5360939,4,B009Q6F54K,"Yuichi Sasamoto's 2008 light novel series ""Miniskirt Space Pirates"" is among the few light novels that received an anime adaptation.

Produced by Satelight, the anime series known as ""Moretsu Pirates"" (""Bodacious Space Pirates"") was aired in Japan between January through June 2012.  And with the announcement of an animated film scheduled for release in February 2014, ""Bodacious Space Pirates"" will be released in the U.S. on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of Sentai Filmworks in two parts, the first feature episodes 1-13.

""Bodacious Space Pirates"" is an anime series written and directed by Tatsuo Sato (""Lagrange - The flower of Rin-ne"", ""Cat Soup"", ""Stellvia""), featuring art direction by Hiroshi Takeuchi (""AKB0048, ""Elfen Lied"", ""Durara!!""), character designs by Hiroshi Takeuchi (""Shutsugeki! Machine Robo Rescue"", ""Idolm@ster: Xenoglassia"", ""Big O"") and music by Elements Garden, Hitoshi Fujima, Junpei Fujita and Noriyasu Agematsu.

VIDEO:

""Bodacious Space Pirates"" is presented in 1080p High Definition.  While a series that displays a lot of color (primarily when they are in Earth), there are some noticeable banding with areas with a lot of red, in space.  While character design and mechanical design look very good and sharp, for the most part, this is is a colorful anime series.

AUDIO:

The lossless soundtrack for ""Bodacious Space Pirates"" features an English and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 soundtrack. While the series is front-channel driven, both are equal when it comes to the use of the front channels. As for voice acting, both are also well-done and acting from both the Japanese and American talent will satisfy viewers.  If there were two key difference between soundtracks is the audio presentation for Misa Grandwood and Chiaki Kurihara.  For the English dub, Misa's presentation has that raspy sexy adult voice which fits the style of the character, while the English dub version of Chiaki features more of a monotone direction, as opposed to a more livelier version in the Japaneese soundtrack.  But for the most part, fans should be happy with both lossless soundtracks.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Bodacious Space Pirates: Part One"" comes with the clean opening and closing animation.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I am a big fan of sci-fi anime especially if driven with an all-female cast.

In the '90s, probably the best known anime series to feature all-female characters and the concept of space pirates was Katsuhito Akiyama's ""Sol Bianca"" series.

While ""Sol Bianca"" is old school anime and a more serious storyline, ""Bodacious Space Pirates"" is spunkier, humorous and fun thanks to its high school characters.  You have Marika Kato, a regular teenager just wanting to have fun and be with her friends but now her life has changed drastically when she finds out that her parents were space pirates and as a descendant, she must continue the Kato line of being Captain of the Bentenmaru.

And we watch as this teenager who has a smart but spunky, yet vibrant side to her as opposed to another teenager, Chiaki Kurihara who is the opposite.  More cold, more observing and just nothing like Marika.  But yet both must fulfill their duty as captains of space pirates for their own ship.

From learning the basics of combat and teamwork, to reading a script and playing a part like an actor of trying to steal jewels from innocent civilians, but also a kindness that makes her different from other pirates, but her willingness and passion to be in space.

The first half of the anime series focuses on Marika's training as the Captain of the Bentenmaru but also working together with Chiaki.  While the first half features episodes that deal with Marika's first major job as she is hired by a princess to find a mysterious ghost ship.

Like most sci-fi anime series, there are many characters but in this case, the crew of the Bentenmaru are not as focused on as other series tries to integrate many crew members.  If anything, your mind is focused primarily on Marika and a few key characters who are trying to make sure their new Captain does the right thing, or try to support her as best as they can.

As for the Blu-ray release, the series looks vibrant on Blu-ray.  There are a few banding issues but nothing terrible.  The soundtrack is primarily a lossless 2.0 front-channel driven soundtrack but dialogue is clear and it's an interesting direction in which the English dub does something different than its Japanese counterpart.  As for special features, you get the usual clean opening and ending animations.

Overall, ""Bodacious Space Pirates"" is a fun, humorous and entertaining sci-fi anime series! A coming-of-age story about a teenager who must take over her deceased father' job of being a Captain of a pirate ship.  Can she do it?

5360941,5,B009Q6F54K,"This series Bodacious Space Pirates is a wonderful enjoying anime that I knew I would love from the get go. It is a rare gem in today's releases. Do not let the name fool you: Bodacious space pirates has little to NO fan service. This is a series driven by characters and character GROWTH. There is very little fan service if you're looking for skin. The title tends to lend itself to such series though.

Marika is what you would call a fairly 'normal' teenage girl going to high school on a planet that looks much like Earth but isn't earth. This takes place we assume in the quite so distant future where humanity has traversed the galaxy and left its mark on planets, colonizing and growing through out space. Turns out that Marika's absent father was the head of a legal space pirate group flying the ship called the Bentenmaru. To keep their ship and pirate group legal the pirates need a new captain and by the way either they or the law works it has to be a decendent of the previous captain within the next month since her father had just passed. They ask Marika to be their captain and thus the story is born.

Marika, who is the gem of this story though there are a lot of other gems too, is what makes Bodacious space pirates so wonderful. She is a strong willed woman who decides stuff and sticks with her decision to the end. She is not boy crazy, make up loving, dress wearing we see in a lot of anime but she isn't a tom boy either. Marika is Marika and her gender has little to do with what she does and that is why I love this series. We need MORE female characters like this in anime. If you want a series about overcoming obsticals and learning new things and trying your best this is definitely the series for you. I am glad to see a state side release of this.

About the physical Sentai release though: Sentai doesn't do the extravagant sets. Their releases tend to be bare bones but Bodacious space pirates did earn itself a decent english dub. The blu ray comes in a standard sized blu ray case with two blu ray disks holding the first 13 episodes. What I will complain about (though the series is still so awesome I won't dock stars for it) the original Japanese blu ray release was 1080p but Sentai either by force of the Japanese company or by they way they encode has encoded it 1080i. You'll notice that during strong action scenes sadly. It's not HORRIBLE but it is a bother that we got less quality release (this isn't the first time though they've done the 1080i either, Sentai sadly has done that for a few of their releases like Penguin Drum which is another gem of a story) especially when they're one of the higher priced anime distributors here in the US. If I'm going to be paying 50+ for half a season of the blu ray only set and Funimation can give me the same product for 10 bucks less and throw in a nice box and the dvds I have issues with the 1080i.

All and all though this series is amazing. Do not miss out on it. (Also as a moonie I do love the sailor moon reference one of the characters is, you'll know it when you see it).",1368835200,2,3074,4.258561643835616
8543712,2,B009Q6F54K,"All the reviews I can see on Amazon for this movie are actually for the two series and not the follow-on movie itself.  I liked the 26 episodes of the original series, and would give them four stars.  Not perfect, but fun, and an unusually serious attempt to handle space battles.  But the movie Abyss of Hyperspace is another thing.  The director of the original series (which was written by someone else) wrote the screenplay for the movie himself.  This was not a good thing.  The movie is kind of a mess, with major new elements wedged into the universe of the series, and about five different movies mixed together in bits and pieces that fly about frantically, tangling and conflicting with each other.  The entire concept of hyperspace is simply added on for the movie after not appearing in the series, along with other major concepts like fixed hyperspace routes through the galaxy and famous hyperspace explorers using ""submarines"" to ""dive"" deep into hyperspace because normal spaceship hulls will crack from the pressure if they get too deep.  Really?  Story lines from the end of the series are simply abandoned, characters' appearances have changed in many cases, motivations come out of nowhere and disappear just as fast (there's a beautiful blond who has at least six different plots attached to her), and near the end we suddenly encounter Giant Transformers in Hyperspace.  Not because it makes any sense but just because.  Yes, it's nice seeing Marika again in the movie, but the story around her this time isn't very good.",1529193600,,1543,4.873563218390805

8543720,5,B009Q6F54K,"Collection 1 is the first 13 episodes of the anime whereas Collection 2 is the final 13 episodes.

Actually a very good sci-fi action story, treats a group of high school girls as highly intelligent, and not just eye-candy.  Actually not very much fan-service in this one, (and while I like fan-service as much as any average male, I was delighted with the fact that the girls' smarts and actions were much more of an integral part of the story than their looks (although they were not bad looking), at least we weren't subjected to endless panty-shots and over-size falling out cleavage, but be aware there is a little tastefully handled yuri in this series.

Series continued in Collection 2

Interesting that the BluRay version was actually a little cheaper than the DVD version (I have both, both purchased on Amazon).",1422057600,,822,4.808510638297872
