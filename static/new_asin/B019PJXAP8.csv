7578843,5,B019PJXAP8,"2015 Salzburg Easter Festival
Blu-ray disc of ""Cav & Pag""

This production is a fresh look at a long-time popular pairing: Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci.  Although ""fresh looks"" don't always succeed, this one succeeds quite well, due in large part to the overall high caliber of the cast and especially to the performance of tenor, Jonas Kaufmann, who sings the lead in both operas.

Here are some specific comments regarding these performances:

SINGERS
Mr. Kaufmann's selective use of pianissimo singing continues to amaze and delight.  For example in Cavalleria, his use of that technique in his opening number, ""O Lola,"" results in an aria that is not only beautifully sung but is also appropriately romantic. (His tasteful use of pianissimo singing can also be enjoyed in recent Blu-ray releases of Tosca and Carmen.)  Liudmyla Monastyrska, who sings the role of Santuzza in Cavalleria, has an exceptionally rich, mezzo-soprano voice that, at least in this recording, is seamless throughout her vocal range.

In Pagliacci we are treated to Mr. Kaufmann's full-throttle, ringing vocalism.  There is also very beautiful singing by soprano, Maria Agresta (Nedda),

ACTING
The acting in both operas is generally skillful and convincing.  For example, when Kaufmann (Canio) slaps a little boy in an early scene of Pagliacci, one realizes Canio is a violent person who likely flunked anger-management class.  Kaufmann is also convincing in the scene where he returns from the local pub after ""one too many.""  Tansel Akzeybek (Beppe) is suitably zany in ""the play"" in Pagliacci.  And, his light, lyric-tenor voice is put to good use in the beautifully sung aria, ""Colombina.""

Also, as pointed out in another review, Ms. Monastyrska (Santuzza) really knows how and when to use ""the look"" to advance the story line.

COSTUMING
Regarding costuming, it's my opinion that the cut and the color-scheme (black, white, and gray) of the villagers' clothes in Cavalleria result in a formal look that is incongruous in a story of peasants in a small Sicilian village.  Also, one wonders what was the thinking when the costume worn by Ms. Agresta (Nedda in Pagliacci) was selected?  (An interview with the production director would have been a welcome addition to this package.)

OVERALL OPINION
In spite of these minor criticisms about costuming, it's my opinion that this impressive Blu-ray disc of ""Cav & Pag"" will become the standard against which future recordings of these two works will be measured.",1464912000,7,2498,5.187032418952619

7578845,3,B019PJXAP8,"ONly toree stars. This staging has lost the sine qua non flavour of sicilian drama. THe mezzo is superb. I would like to hear Her as Amneris, Preciosilla and other verdian roles for mezzo. Kaufmann Voice is not most adequated for the role. My prefered is by far .Bjoerling followed by Bergonzi and Domingo.",1464566400,5,306,4.685185185185185
7578846,2,B019PJXAP8,I bought this video basically because I love the two operas Pagliacci  being my favorite of the two. The singing is great I really like the singing it's the production that is very very weird that's all I can address to the readers here very very weird as far as I'm concerned but if you like Yonas Kaufmann.  Then I would recommend it to you  I don't wise I would highly recommend the net production from 1978 starring Placido Domingo  in both tenor roles,1463875200,10,456,4.392857142857143
7578847,5,B019PJXAP8,"I do not know what gives with Amazon! I did a review of this fine release; it shows in my profile, but it ain't where it can benefit customers. Go Figure!

Anyway ... This is a much needed disc of a well sung and largely well staged pair of operatic workhorses, whose popularity remains fairly high despite the passage of time.  Disc quality is outstanding.

Get it!",1463443200,4,366,4.432835820895522
7578848,3,B019PJXAP8,"The sound track was not as pure as it might have been, however Kaufmann hit the ball out of the park with his ""vesti la giubba"" in Pagliacci. I am persnickety  about text translated into English.  The last line of  Pagliacci read ""The story is over.""  What a gross understatement for a profound tragedy.  The Italian words translated as they should be read are, ""The comedy is finished"".  They  pack a more fitting wollop for the end of this Opera.",1476144000,3,448,4.525

7578853,4,B019PJXAP8,"Two over-produced versions of rather simple but dramatically superb operas. The Pagliaci  is a giggle in spite of the solid performances of the principals. Cavallieria  is overdone to the point that one wonders if the director/producer ever read the libretto. Again: the cast deserved better. Thiellmann  does not seem to me much of a verissimo conductor (wonderful in the German rep, though); ;however, the audience seemed to disagree with me.",1471651200,3,444,5.314285714285714

7578856,2,B019PJXAP8,"Jonas Kaufmann is, as expected, riveting in his role debuts as Turiddu and Canio in this production of ""Cav"" & ""Pag"" from the 2015 Salzburg Easter festival.  As he has demonstrated over and over again, he is the full package, one seemingly designed by the gods for the HD age of opera: ridiculously handsome, with a glorious voice and the acting chops of Brando.  Unfortunately, the production, by German film director Philipp Stlzl, lets him and the rest of the fine cast down in a big way.  The concept, which presents both pieces as if they were some sort of living comic strip, complete with a stage awkwardly divided into frames, and bizarre, almost surreal, sets and costumes, is the antithesis of ""verismo,"" the movement for which these operas are the prime examples.  Many of the directorial choices are jarring and senseless -- Turiddu and Santuzza having a son of 8 or 9 years old, Mamma Lucia being some kind of underworld money launderer (!), Tonio apologizing for presenting himself to the audience ""alone"" when he's in fact surrounded by the entire cast, Canio slapping an annoying child at the top of ""Pagliacci""-- but in the world of regietheater, can one expect anything else?  Well, yes.  I'm not against updating and high concept, by any means, but the arbitrariness of what Stlzl is doing here just ends up being annoying, claustrophobic and distracting.  I will not be keeping this video in my collection.  Kaufmann has been just as good elsewhere, and there will be, hopefully, a better ""Cav"" & ""Pag"" in future to replace it.",1469145600,18,1547,4.811320754716981

8745738,2,B019PJXAP8,"The music is beautifully done.  The set, at least for Cavalleria Rusticana, makes the production virtually unwatchable.  As far as I am concerned it distorts the plot.  The set add confusion and seems to have little to do with the actual libretto.  If you just want to hear but not see you would be better with the CD.  There are many other DVD productions of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci with high quality singers and a staging that makes more sense than this one.",1515888000,2,471,4.626506024096385
