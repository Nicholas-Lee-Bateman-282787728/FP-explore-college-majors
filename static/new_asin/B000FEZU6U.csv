8121557,3,B000FEZU6U,"Joe Dallesandro portrays a classic 'broken' veteran.  The Armed Forces totally fail to recognize or treat his mental breakdown and, instead, put him in charge of training an advanced elite unit.  He systematically pushes each man beyond the breaking point, all but executing most of them.  Fans will appreciate the amount of time they get to see him in this flick.  In the end, it is more about the failures of the Armed Forces than an individual's collapse into fatal brutality.",1387497600,,479,4.8765432098765435
