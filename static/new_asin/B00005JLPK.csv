1507628,5,B00005JLPK,"Frida is a magnificent film for anyone interested in painting as it is the first film, to my knowledge, that actually brings alive an artist's paintings and makes the thought processes behind them accessable. Frida's paintings are a direct mirror of her inner experiences, and the film makes this abundantly clear.  I was mesmerized by the meticulous craft of the film, it is a visual feast;  the story enthralling, the music powerful. It frames a rich and colorful culture.  As an painter and a woman, I loved it. Films don't often have this much impact for me.",1036713600,6,562,4.77319587628866
1507629,5,B00005JLPK,"Frida should initially be seen on a large screen.  The cinematography of this film is unarguably gorgeous.  Elliot Goldenthal's brilliant music score sets the right tone.  Director Julie Taynor provides us with a glimpse of how delusional some well meaning Communists were in the previous century.  Salma Hayek accurately portrays Frida Kahlo as intellectually shallow and easily swayed by avant-garde radicalism.  She does, though, earn our respect for enduring unrelenting pain and overcoming challenges that might defeat the best of us. Her husband Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) was far more talented, but still Kahlo's own work is deemed thought provoking and deserving of praise.  This couple held the standard mores of a viable social order in utter contempt.  The term dysfunctional doesn't begin to describe the unusualness of their relationship.  Their everyday life of sexual promiscuity and alcohol abuse is taken for granted.  We get to observe the highs and lows of their atypical arrangement.  One does not need to be a Puritan to sense that a bad ending is inevitable.
The Soviet thug Leon Trotskey (Geoffrey Rush) is presented as some sort of humane philosopher who strongly disagreed with the vicious tendencies of the Stalin regime. This is a false interpretation of events, but a brief movie review is not an appropriate place to set the record straight. Edward Norton briefly plays the part of Nelson Rockefeller who did the right thing by ordering Rivera's mural destroyed.  The great artist naively wished to honor Vladimir Illyich Lenin,  one of the most blood thirsty tyrants in human history.  We are tempted to cheer when the laborers are finally sent to tear it down.
Frida easily earns five stars.  Possessing great artistic talent is not a guarantee that one is able to distinguish between good and evil.  Frida and her compatriots inadvertently did enormous damage. This splendidly well done movie will assist you in comprehending how the Communist movement was able to convert so many intelligent people to its diabolically nihilistic ideology.  We must learn from history so that past is not repeated.",1036281600,15,2132,5.190058479532164
1507630,4,B00005JLPK,"One thing I do not like is comparing a book to the movie that is based on the book. For one thing they are two very different art forms. And hardly ever will the Twain meet. And that is a good thing.
Frida is an amazing collage of one of the most fascinating artists, sexual and political women of our time. Like many others her paintings, at first repulsed me, but after reading excerpts from Herrera's biography on Frida- ( which is bogged down on the love letters and love making, with hardly a comment on the political and national turmoil of the times),- one could see why the painting's were so full of sorrow and life defying pain.
Frida lived in some very volatile times the revolution in Russia with Trotsky living in her house. Her husband and mentor and much admired muralist Diego Rivera going to New York, commissioned to paint a mural for Rockefeller and painting Lenin as one of the struggling workers. When asked to remove Lenin from the painting, he refused and Rockefeller tore the mural down.
It was a time of great nationalism and the struggle to stop the European influence in Mexico.
Many kudos' to Salma Hayek for her devotion to this biopic. I was very concerned that it could not be done, but it has been done and a great job. There's got to be some Oscar nominations out of this beautiful movie. The vivid colors and the musical score are in themselves worth the trip to see this great movie. The two main characters, Salma and Molina fit as a pair of gloves and Tango around each other as honeybees around a bright red poppy.
If you miss this movie you will have missed one of the best biopic's ever.

1507991,4,B00005JLPK,"This movie evokes David Lean's ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" in a sense, that both movies were not intended to be straight biographies of their respective historical figures. In fact, this movie even made me think of the ""I Love Lucy"" sitcom, with Diego Rivera as the buffoon to Frida Kahlo the straight woman.

The movie starts with Frida Kahlo at age 18, just before she had the accident while riding a bus, which would cause her crippling injuries she would carry for the remainder of her life. She is given a canvas and paints by her family to occupy her while she initially recovers, and she adopts a surrealistic style, and later meets and marries already famous muralist Diego Rivera. They become left-wing radicals while living in high society, move to the United States where Rivera would try to paint his mural depicting Lenin in the Rockefeller Center, then move back when the project is cancelled and the mural destroyed. Both spouses have many extramarital affairs, though Diego gets upset when his wife has one with Leon Trotsky. (I saw the movie in the theater, and the audience all groaned in mockery when Diego complained to Frida about it.)

Like I said, the movie is drama rather than biography; we see Frida, despite her sufferings, as strong and laughing at her many troubles. We don't see what moves her politically or artistically, but the movie is for entertainment and not education.",1522886400,,1399,4.825

1507996,5,B00005JLPK,"Salma Hayek was destined to play Frida Kahlo. It was a labor of love for her. She had wanted to make this film for eight years. Frida Kahlo (1907 to 1955) was an unique Mexican artist. She had suffered from health issues for years following a trolley accident which left her seriously injured. She miraculously recovered but never totally healed. She was an artist in life and her artistry. She had a tempestuous relationship with Mexican artist, Diego Rivera. Diego and Frida were more than just husband and wife but partners in art. Despite their infidelities, they returned to each other. In this two hour film, Julie Taymor has filmed the entire movie on location in Mexico, Diego and Frida's native country. She had filmed this visual, vibrant film on budget surprisingly.

The cast included British actor, Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera; Australian actor Geoffrey Rush as Leon Trotsky. Supporting cast included Ashley Judd, Valeria Golino, Edward Norton, Antonio Banderas and Roger Rees. The film is quite visual and vibrant that you don't think it's made on a budget at all. There are plenty of extras on the second dvd about the making of the film. Julie Taymor has interviews with Bill Moyers and the American Film Institute. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards including a nomination for Salma Hayek. Elliott Goldenthal and the make-up team won two Academy Awards. Sadly, Julie Taymor was not nominated for best director. Taymor should have been nominated for this film.

If you're a Frida Kahlo or Salma Hayek fan, you will definitely want to add this DVD to your collection.",1521590400,,1595,4.925650557620818

The movie demonstrates the strength, vision and independence of Kahlo as well as her vulnerability and dependence on Diego Rivera. Diego Rivera is depicted as someone who lived life in reference to himself. A major part of Kahlo's life was her relationship with him and that led to perpetual conflict with someone who lived to fulfill his own vision first and always.

1508320,5,B00005JLPK,"You can immediately feel that you are a part of history and even when you know their (Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera) story you still get surprised amused and amazed. I have seen their actual work and this film brings it back. For people that do not know their story this is an excellent introduction. I found it interesting how Frida (Selma Hayek) and Diego (Alfred Molina) complimented each others personality so well from the beginning until where we leave them.

Also the films surrealistic qualities will remind you of ""Like Water for Chocolate"". Many times this enhances instead of distracting form the reality of the films port ate. The colors being vibrant and even the music being vibrant fives a three dimensional quality to the film. I have only seen one other Julie Taymor directed film ""Oedipus Rex"" (1992) which also had this quality. Julie seems to know how to bring out thoughts that we do not know we have our selves and we see many things in a new way.

I started to buy the soundtrack but do not see Lila Downs on any of the tracks. And her singing was the soul of the movie.

Now it is time to read the Hayden Herrera (book) ""Frida - A Biography of Frida Kahlo"" to see how much is in this screen adaptation by Clancy Sigal.",1506902400,,1238,4.469026548672566

1508415,4,B00005JLPK,"Biographical sketch of Frida Kahlo, a handicapped Mexican painter, the movie portrays her unexpected recovery from a childhood injury, her love affairs and artistic vocation. Her marriage to a well known promiscuous fellow artist and her dedication despite continued transgressions may be more cultural than believable.  The settings and screenplay are superb, but there are choppy areas especially those suggestive of her lesbian tendencies and that surrounding the ultimate demise of her lover Trotsky, the Russian exile. As a whole, the movie vividly portrays Frida's rising from the ashes of her childhood trauma and living an active and creative life as a painter, expressive of the sufferings she endured.",1503619200,,711,5.522935779816514

1508488,1,B00005JLPK,"Apparently, self-portrait painter Frida Khalo's groupie life with muralist Diego Rivera and their ever-revolving drunken party guests, bi-sexual models, and fickle philosopher friends was basicallly Les Mis&eacute;rables with unexamined predation. This irredeemable film treatment of late-to-the-party painter Khalo, is content to present without comment a disturbingly desultory existence of hedonism, daddy-issues, fractured self-esteem, narcissism and self-destruction without so much as a whiff of bourgeoisie ""judgment"" that could have be used as the basis of an actual viewpoint. Opting instead for an unsteady camera that swerves through the intimate action like a tipsy party invitee, Frida gives nothing, if not the distinct feeling of having a beer or fifty with these two self-absorbed creeps.

Frida's motives for choosing her partners and her thoughts on why she created the specific surrealist paintings she did are both left unknowable, even more curiously, by another female artist, director and costume designer Julie Taymor. Taymor & Co. also commit the ultimate betrayal by telling Frida's story through Diego's life trajectory; even if Khalo behaved as if she were but a reflection of Rivera, the filmmakers should either help distinguish her or offer condolences for her dreadful decisions that all but buried her legacy until 25 years after her death when historians revived it.

So instead of providing a map key to the messy outcomes of Frida's existence, we get a medium-as-message filmic homage that borrows the colored fantasy visuals from her paintings and instead of capturing the meanderings of an eternal debutante, meanders itself without story, without suspense and, most importantly, without aspiration.

For one of the few films that explores both the libertine living situation AND the raison d'tre of an artist's outlier products of perception, check out 1994's Sirens, a fanciful exploration of the earthy sculptures and paintings of racy Australian artist Norman Lindsay. Hugh Grant plays a visiting married minister who visits Lindsay (robustly inhabited by Sam Neil from Jurassic Park) at his cultural commune and provides a unique viewpoint through which the audience can begin to decipher Lindsay's motives, both artistic and anarchic. And by the way, Salma Hayek falls so far from a complex portrayal of the decadent, dour, pain-ravaged Khalo, opting instead for a coquettish, fallow and supremely superficial interpretation that is immediately and fatally at odds with the gravitas of Khalo's own work.",1493164800,2,2547,5.6103896103896105

And if you're just so-so on the first, you will at least appreciate the human story of talent, suffering, passion and perseverance.  The acting by Salma Hayek is superb...and the views into Mexican history of the first part of the 20th century are eye-opening to most Americans, I suspect.  This is a serious drama, with virtually no comic relief, but it is not an unrelenting tragedy in part, because of the movie-making and in part, because of the incredible talent of the artists.",1479254400,,580,4.666666666666667

1509725,5,B00005JLPK,"The movie starts as Frida Kahlo approaches established painter Diego Rivera who introduces her to his circle and the world ... their relationship is as beautiful and subtle as it is fascinating and volatile. Even if you don't know much about the painters and the contemporary movements (surrealism / impressionism / dada / trotskyism / etc) in this film, its very enjoyable because it's about the artists interpreting with pigment and binder the fast changing world around them - not very focused their artworks or process - although that subject gets ample screen time. As a humble and disabled adult Frida overcomes her initial doubt she eventually outshines her politically sidelined and jealous peers and husband to become arguably the first female ""modern"" master.",1456876800,,769,5.209677419354839

1509731,5,B00005JLPK,"I saw this movie when it first came out, but this time around I found it much deeper than just watching a movie.  Frida Kahlo was, and still is, one of my favorite female artists.  Her dedication and spirit toward her art remains remarkable.  Her will to walk again is inspirational. Her valiant efforts toward the end of her life cannot be matched.  She was one determined woman.  Salma Hayak portrayed her in such a realistic manner that I felt I was living right there in the movie!  There are some R rated scenes but I found them fairly tasteful although sometimes the language gets a little rough.  The costumes, scenery, and music were superb.  Well worth the time spent watching this excellent movie.",1455580800,3,707,4.645161290322581

The story of her evolution as a woman and artist is told with honesty, humor and insight.  In the film you see how Frida's art expresses her inner realities and the different shades of life both darkness and light.  It is an engrossing personal story that for me connected to the challenges of my own life.  Well worth the time to visit her world in this film.

This film popped up for only $5 and was well-worth that price. What a delight. I recommend watching the lengthy interview with Selma Hayek after the movie in the Extras. This was truly a labor of love for her that took many years to realize. The movie is an artistic masterpiece in itself that reveals the complicated relationship between the two artists.,1433894400,3,491,4.788235294117647

1512128,3,B00005JLPK,"Like all biopics, it fudges the details to tell a more interesting, dramatic story.  The movie is an adequate introduction for someone interested in Kahlo or Rivera.  Salma Hayak does a good job in a role she is inappropriately cast in.  So does Alfred Molina.  The movie doesn't make much effort to capture Frida's spirit, intelligence or artistic passion.  It mostly focuses on her being an eccentric and doomed figure but at least it is beautifully filmed.",1433376000,,459,4.909090909090909
1512129,5,B00005JLPK,This movie was my introduction to Frieda Kahlo. The acting and storyline were really well done. Kudos to Ms. Hayek.for  putting this project.,1433289600,2,141,5.130434782608695

1512226,5,B00005JLPK,I enjoyed the movie very much as we had just viewed the exhibit of her art at the Detroit Art Institute.  What an interesting life!  The movie and the information at the exhibit did differ on some facts.  It is definitely R rated for the sexual scenes.,1433116800,,252,4.319148936170213
1512227,5,B00005JLPK,Especially timely as the Botanical Garden has a major show on the artist's Life.,1433116800,,80,4.785714285714286

1512339,5,B00005JLPK,This was a wonderful movie.  It really caught the deep emotions of Frida and her great efforts to express herself through her art which was overshadowed by Rivera. It always told us a lot about the history of the time period in which she lived.  She was an exciting person inspite of the obstacles she faced.,1432944000,,308,4.482142857142857

1512440,5,B00005JLPK,"Beautiful movie telling the story of the artist Frida Kahlo and her artistic genius. She had many relationships with both men and women and this movie does not try to shy away from that fact or hide it, like some other movies have.

She never does. It becomes a symbol of her life. Abstract scenes emphasize the surreal nature of her art and life. The movie is thought provoking. You won't feel sorry for her because just when you begin to, she demonstrates such resiliency that you realize this woman is unbeatable.",1431820800,,449,4.69620253164557

1513909,5,B00005JLPK,"The name 'Frida Kahlo' brings images of a tempestuous Latina, gifted with artistic talent, brimming with feminist independence and passion. Though the film was released in 2002, I managed to see it only recently. It is a beautiful film, produced fittingly by the Mexican star Salma Hayek, who herself plays Frida. Hayek brings to life the anarchic spirit of Frida as the movie drowns us in dazzling colors, enchanting music score and of course, unbridled sex as was the won't of two free spirits like Frida and her husband Diego Rivera. As an admirer of both the legend of Frida and the beauty of Salma Hayek, I couldn't see any faults with the film  and so, this will have to be a less than objective review, I guess!

Frida was born into a wealthy Mexican family as the daughter of a European Jewish father and a Mexican mother. The movie starts dramatically with a sick Frida in pain being driven in a rickety truck to her own art exhibition before flashing back  to her high school days. Soon, we see her travelling by a crowded city bus with her boyfriend, discussing Karl Marx and Dialectical Materialism. Tragedy strikes them as the bus crashes in a terrible accident, leaving Frida crippled with multiple fractures to her spine and a crushing injury to her already polio-stricken leg and foot. Subsequently, she recovers, paints prolifically as she lays in bed and shows them to Diego Rivera, the most famous modernist painter in all of the Americas in the 1920s. One thing leads to another and the two stormy petrels of Mexican art get married but Rivera's pathological philandering eventually gets to Frida and they end up getting alienated. Frida herself is bisexual and experiments with various partners, male and female, even as the revolutionary politics of the 1930s brings the Russian communist Leon Trotsky to Mexico in exile. Frida provides asylum to Trotsky and his wife in her father's house and ends up having an affair with Trotsky. Eventually, Stalin's NKVD hirelings succeed in assassinating Trotsky in Mexico. Frida reconciles with Diego Rivera, remarries him just as her health deteriorates. The final scenes show Frida attending her own first ever art exhibition in Mexico by being wheeled into the gallery in her bed and requesting Rivera that her body be cremated on death. Another of the mysteries in Frida's persona is that one of her last paintings is called 'Stalin and I' even though Stalin organized the assassination of her lover Trotsky. The film ends with Frida being consumed symbolically by flames.

I was simply enchanted by the vibrant colors and their symbolism in the film. You see it in the choice of Frida's clothes, inspired by the dazzling attire of the Tehuana native American tribal women. You see it in the array of self-portraits that Frida paints in her later life, showing herself in Tehuana costumes.  You see it in the pretty Spanish-style courtyards of Frida's home, in the garden and the fabrics adorning the windows. You see it in the roses and sophie flowers that decorate Frida's dark, braided hair. Not only the colors, but her sparkling jewelry, the bright headscarves and plaited skirts add to the allure of Frida.

Salma Hayek as Frida is obviously the star of the show. She gives a terrific performance as Frida, loving and vulnerable at one time, fiery-tempered and assertive at other times, miserable yet another occasion due to the pain that she suffers all over her body. Salma looks gorgeous as Frida in all her resplendent Tehuana costumes and flowers. Her defiant dance of tango with Ashley Judd is one of the best scenes in the film. The film has other major artists like Antonio Banderas as David Siqueiros, Geoffery Rush as Trotsky and Edward Norton as the younger Rockefeller. But they are just dwarfed by the enormity of the performance of Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina in the roles of Frida and Rivera.

I found the film a worthy tribute to Frida Kahlo.",1427932800,,3932,4.85096870342772
1513910,3,B00005JLPK,"Entertaining and Hayek was terrific - much more appealing than the real Frida! But I'm a Detroiter brought up on the Rivera murals at the Detroit Institute of Art, and very familiar with the work Kahlo did while she was in Detroit. The movie mangled the chronology and omitted any reference to Detroit whatsoever, which is very strange since the DIA murals are his most famous works in the U.S.. She did the painting of herself in the post-miscarriage bloody hospital bed that was at The Henry Ford Hospital on W Grand Blvd in Detroit - none of that occurred in NYC. See the blockbuster exhibit: Frida and Diego at the DIA, read the biography - it's all fascinating. The movie was entertaining, not a documentary.",1427932800,6,713,4.666666666666667

1514355,5,B00005JLPK,"I've never before written a review of what I watch on Amazon Prime but I had to do so now because this film was SO much better than I was expecting and now I'm sorry I never got to see it in a theater.  When it came out it got mixed but mostly positive reviews and I just never found the time to see it before it quickly disappeared.  To be perfectly honest, too, part of me suspected that many of its supporters lauded it  partly in the spirit of a well-intentioned political correctness.  I came of age in the 1980's-90's when identity politics was rampant and Frida Kahlo was a triple-crown hero of the downtrodden so I was more than a bit suspicious:  Latina, female and physically handicapped, she was practically a secular saint of humanities departments world-wide.

In reality, the movie got short shrift by critics as well as audiences.  There are only excellent performances throughout but Salma Hayek's performance was incredible.  I was particularly impressed--but hardly surprised--by Julie Taymor's visually rich, psychologically precise direction.  In a movie about an artist it's somewhat expected that the work must be related to the events of the person's life but this film does it as well or better than anything I have seen since ""Andrey Rublev,"" and that is some very fine cinematic company, indeed.

It obviously wasn't a big budget picture but they seemed to squeeze a lot of juice out of those oranges.  Music, production design, locations, costumes--everything--was excellent.  Highest recommendation.",1427414400,10,1527,4.992094861660079

People rating the ""lifestyle"" of Frida and Diego an ""F"" (but their art is good, indeed. Lol. And rating someone's lifestyle? Can you possibly be more dully judgmental? Just that is hilarious). People upset because of nudity or sexual language (ah, america! do they realize who Frida was? What did they expect exactly? little stars to cover the nipples?). People saying the movie was too slow... (as opposed to what? fast and furious 8?)

1514823,5,B00005JLPK,"Before watching this film I knew nothing about Frida Kahlo besides the fact that her paintings were surreal and she had a unibrow and a mustache. But I have to say that I loved this movie. Not only did I learn about Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, both their art and their lives, I also learned a lot I didn't know about the history of Mexico. The acting was great, the music was terrific, and the cinematography was lush and wonderful. If you are the prissy type, offended by nudity, language, or sex, you'll hate this movie. On the other hand, if you think you'd appreciate a sexy tango with Salma Hayek and Ashley Judd, that scene alone is worth the price of admission.

While not on a par for adventure as Desperado, it was fun seeing her interplay with Antonio Banderas who played an interesting Siqueiros.  The biggest surprise for me was Alfred Molina's portrayal of Diego Rivera.  EXCELLENT casting on this movie.  No wonder it was nominated for 6 Academy Awards.

It also allowed me to learn some interesting tidbits about this exceptional artist.  I was unaware of the tragedy that befell her as a young woman, such a terrible accident.  Her lifelong love affair with Rivera is well known, but I loved the interplay and intensity that was brought to life here with Hayek & Molina.  All of my Thumbs UP!",1426723200,,797,4.844444444444444

1515898,4,B00005JLPK,"I am heavily biased against the Mexican social life and ethnic having spent most of my life in Southern California and watching it become North Mexico over the past 45 years.  And to top it off Frida and her husband were Communist/Socialists, backing the USSR ideology.  Card carrying leaders in the Mexican Socialist movement.

But!!!  Selma brought out the realistic beauty of this unique character. And brought out the real Frida so well that my biases were so heavily overshadowed that after 15 minutes or so I didn't even put any attention on them.  Biases aside, we are all human and Frida was an extremely unique and remarkable person, worthy of an A movie.  And Selma filled her with the emotions that bring the descriptives of her to life, in a movie worth seeing.",1425945600,,773,4.731343283582089

I thought by the photo on the cover it might be about some Spanish royalty (what's with the eyebrows?).  Two things this movie had going for it: Salma Hayek and that is was about art.  I admired both.  The movie was, in a way, about royalty in the art world.  Frida was in the beginning an energetic, budding artist in the making.  Alas, tragedy almost did her in.  An accident that had left her in a body cast.  She loved her family especially her father.  The last thing she'd ever wanted was to be a burden.  The accident had left her, however, with a broken body that even her spirit could not heal.  She'd eventually got out of bed and learned to walk again and resumed painting.  With mounting medical bills, she approached womanizing muralist Diego Rivera then later married him.  From then on, the movie chronicles their tempestuous relationship with Frida, in the end, getting her time in the limelight.  It is good, not great movie for a Saturday afternoon.",1425081600,,1091,4.494897959183674

1517792,4,B00005JLPK,Frida Kaho was an extremely talented Mexican artist in about the 1920's. Because of a bus accident when she was young she was crippled and in pain her whole life she also could not bear children. She married an egotistical woman chasing artist who caused her much personal pain.

It must also be said that Frida Kahlo whom was so well represented by Ms. Hayek in this medium, had some unique, independent qualities that have always been rare and are interesting, to say the least.
Alfred Molina could not have been better cast, as Diego Rivera . It is both an historical film and immensely entertaining, if not also a touch unsettling.
The times and demeanor of the film remind me of Buenos Aires for some reason. Rather than a summary of events, I urge you to watch this work of art in motion for yourself.

1518096,5,B00005JLPK,"When I first saw the work of Frida, it was at a museum in Houston TX...and my first impression was a surprise at the rawness of her work.  In some ways, it seemed childlike, cartoonish maybe, but very truthful.  Yet, I had no idea to her background and life.  This was almost 20 some years ago; and I am finally saw this movie to catch a glimpse into her life...which amazed me, inspiring even.  I am almost jealous that she knew early on as to display her talents.  There are some aspects to the movie I question - did she come from a family of wealth...well, then perhaps that may account for her never having to work a job?  But from my own experience, the steps we take toward our talents can be long and arduous for one of little means...or wonderfully easy if you are born into the right family.  Either way, it does not seem her life was Charmed...and yet in all the pain, she found such beauty and a way to express her will for living so passionately.  And in that, I have a certain amount of envy.  On the other hand, I find myself relating to her experiences...because she was so daring, open to others who are different, and a fighter for truth.  No matter IF she may have been misled by imperfect human reasonings; I still applaud her will to search.  When she cried, I weeped - when she reveled, I was turned on by the energy - and when she felt anger, my fists clinched in return.  Loved this film - I wouldn't even dare to give away any pieces of the film...why would I ruin another's experience?  Shame on anyone who does.  The acting was decent for each person, but I wasn't so much caught up into the acting as much as the story.  Which was done very well...that I wished I had met her!  I wished I could have been at one of her parties, and laughed alongside of her....and toss a tequila down in reply.  She truly knew who she was...and that is more than anyone could ever hope for...To Know Thy Self is a wonderful discovery to living.",1422921600,,1955,4.269021739130435

1518463,3,B00005JLPK,"The film begins in Mexico City, in 1922. After school, Frida and her friends take a ride on a trolley bus to get home. The driver, in an aggressive act which would be considered road rage, causes a horrific accident; Frida is thrown from the bus. At the hospital, medical staff determine she has the following injuries: spinal column is broken, pelvis is broken in three places, right leg has 11 fractures, and foot is crushed. Doctors question her ability to walk again. After extensive rehabilitation and physical therapy, she does walk and initiates a meeting with Diego Rivera, a renown artist (muralist) and well known womanizer and satyriasis. They are two very similar individuals; it's as if they were cast from the same mold, and she, without hyperbole, reveres him. They become intimately involved. When he promises to be monogynous and shed his lothario, Casanova image, they get married. It is a nugatory, unfulfilled promise that he reneges on because of his carnal hedonistic, impulsive nature and low self-control. His proclivity for promiscuousness nettles and hurts her. He expresses sorrow and lament for the pain he causes her, but he feels she should accept and excuse him of these ephemeral, evanescent liaisons. It's a shame and reprehensible, yet he realizes this, was distraught and devastated when he no longer had the presence of her adulation in his life.",1413417600,3,1382,5.039301310043668

1518523,5,B00005JLPK,"This is a very powerful movie, intriguingly presented with a wonderful story.  I already thought highly of Salma Hayek, but Alfred Molina was a revelation.  The actors actually looked like Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.  I've been familiar with Diego Rivera's work for many years -- I even have complete collections of his murals and cubist work (as books;  I could never afford the originals) -- but was quite unaware of Frida Kahlo's.  I have since picked up a good collection of her work as well.

Fascinating subject matter and fascinating story.

If you are into 20th century art and/or early/middle 20th century Mexican politics, this is an absolute must see.  But it doesn't require such high-mindedness.  see it for the wonderful performances of Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina.

1518676,4,B00005JLPK,"Frida lived a life that was both blessed and cursed. She was blessed with charisma, drive and talent. On the other hand, she lived a life of physical and mental torture. Knowing that she lived during a time where people had to ""tough it up or die"", I felt an amazing awe and admiration for the dynamic, colorful life that this tiny and brave creature led. She had a resolve and an amazing inner strength that few of us might have, given her situation.

Even so, watching this movie is difficult because I still wanted it to be a happy life for someone so exceptionally gifted, yet the despair, pain, and the sadness of her life was the very source of her inspiration in her paintings. Without it, who knows what kind of an artist she would have been regarded as -it was the very life blood of her work. Her tumultuous relationship with Diego Rivera, whom I both admire but totally dislike, was a source of true love and pain. A serial womanizer, Rivera was an unfortunate choice to hitch her wagon to, but when it comes to the matters of the heart, sometimes there's nothing one can do but hope for the best. Even so, there's no doubt that the two of them were crazy about each other but it was a painful and seriously dysfunctional union, to say the least.

I suppose that's the disconnect that I and maybe others feel when thinking about Kahlo's life and work -there's a polarizing effect going on that is both disturbing and fascinating that follows her to this day.

I love the final scene, as strangely morbid (but beautiful too) as it is, and the use of her art in effect sequences of this film. It lends a sort of playful but mournful tone to the film, not unlike Kahlo's life.",1400803200,,1684,4.408360128617363

Frida's art is stunning: different from anything I've seen in the art field.  Her life was tragic but she never stopped painting.  I remember an art teacher of mine saying that to do art you have to have an 'artistic ego' meaning you must be driven to create for no other reason than the joy of creating.  Frida had this.

Frida's home is a MUSEUM, and a very detailed set was made that allowed for the long filming. When you watch this film, it really is just like walking through her home.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, it was quite entertaining. Selma Hayek and Alfred Lima were excellent in their roles as Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera. I was thankful this movie was on the assignment list, although I have to admit, I kept double checking the spelling of the title to see if I made a mistake and was watching the wrong movie (yes, it was that kind of good).

1518747,2,B00005JLPK,"After hearing about all the grandeur that this film would convey, I was looking forward to seeing the attempt to put the life of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo onto the screen but I also came in with healthy skepticism. This was a big disappointment, not only is there nothing important stated in the film, but the acting is absolutely horrible.

It was an understatement to say that this was pure ""torture"" to people who want to be intellectually stimulated or at least watch a decent film about someone's life without resorting to that fact that the director wanted us to see Frida as nothing but a ""hero and martyr"" and a one dimensional character, which is what is conveyed throughout this awful film. Julie Taymor (a pretentious playwright and puppet maker w/ one film to her credit) instead gives us a Hollywood cliche about the artist's life, including meaningless pseudo-surrealist interjections which bring to life some of the paintings in a boring fashion.

Hayek is tepid, stale and dull and never really brings any vividness or passion into one of the most vibrant artists of the century, instead, we get to see her breasts about 20% of the time, not that I am against that, but a film should be about something more important that conventional sex scenes which have no point being on the screen and give us feelings into the art and life and relationship with Rivera (played by the dismal Alfred Molina).

Taymor is unsure whether she wants to actually let us examine Kahlo's life or merely show us a predictable storyline that doesn't fit anywhere, she meanders through the most ""famous"" episodes in Frida's life, including her horrific accident and sprinkles a few twists and interpretations. She has a turbulent relationship with Rivera but again, no souls are studied. Trotsky (played by the laughable Geoffrey Rush with a bad Russian accent) has no meaning at all, instead he is nothing but a sex toy which was disgusting to behold on the screen. We feel as if we are watching a bunch of idiots on the screen because not one of the actors hired for this film show any enthusiasm or any acting capabilities, although Antonio Banderas as the artist Siqueiros is the closest thing but he is given only about 2 minutes to work.

Painting was an important part of Frida's life but we don't really get to even see her at work here. If you are looking for a literary study of the artist, this is most definately not the place to look. This is a tragic disgrace to the artist, and merely a conventional approach that gives rich Americans, who compromise 97% of the film audience, a chance to say that they know Frida after watching this. After all, it was the American upper middle class that co-opted Frida's works and life and called it their own, to put on t-shirts and mugs. What is sad, as I saw while reading the other reviews of this film, is that people won't know that nothing was actually stated in the film because they are accustomed to mindless Hollywood garbage which just wants to take famous names and make more money so we have people calling this ""brilliant and wonderful"". I think a Mexican director with decent actors who know their craft is what is necessary if you really want to make a respectable and credible.

Frida is an AMAZING story about Frida Kahlo, an incredible Mexican-born half-Mexican half-German Jew artist, and Diego Rivera's wife. She's the picture of strength and determination, not to mention skill and talent. She's my personal hero, and, having grown up in the Borderland, this movie only underscored what I already knew and believed about this heroine. I can't say enough good things!!!

1519426,5,B00005JLPK,"I saw a piece of her work several years ago mixed in with several other contemporary painters when I was visiting another city.  I thought oh, hum, another surrealist painting of women's issues.  Dead stylized animal around her neck.  Been done.  I must have missed the date it was painted, because after I discovered her anew, I realized that she was probably the catalyst behind so many painters after her.  I began to read about her life, and was fascinated, intrigued by the manifest of her energy in the paintings, and broadened by learning about the symbolism that permeates them. Not to mention the political arena that encircled her life. Like most Americans, what little history I've gotten through public schools has quite glaringly not been about Africa, Asia or South America.

The acting and story are just incredible - so incredible that my friend and I who know less about Russian and Mexican history than we care to admit, found ourselves saying how remarkable everything was, and could she or he have really done that?  And Trotsky?  And yet apparently it happened.  The movie found its way through one moment after another with its own art along the way.  The artistic expression was beautiful and I thought reflected her well, intermingling her images, and making new ones within the cinematic story.  I think the director showed incredible creativity while displaying a great deal of self-restraint.  Frida could so easily have gotten lost in the very many details about her life.

I think that Frida would have loved how this story became yet another illustrated piece of her history.  I dislike being too flowery about reviews, but I was touched by how true this movie stayed to a courageous artist and woman.",1348704000,,1731,4.883561643835616

I did not have much of an opinion of her; her body or work was okay, she wore long, traditional Mexican dresses and she had been married to Diego Rivera.  The movie did a good job of depicting her story in a way I could understand.  Now when I think of her artwork I know to look a little deeper and can better interpret her emotions.  The miscarriage explains a lot.  It is also interesting to see the development of political ideas and the passion that comes with it.

1519430,5,B00005JLPK,"From June 5, 2012 to September 16, 2012 the Cummer Museum of Art here in Jacksonville, Florida, has a special art exhibition called MIRADAS: Ancient Roots in Modern and Contemporary Mexican Art: Works from the Bank of America Collection.

After I saw the exhibition last week, I rented a dvd of this 2002 Academy-Award nominated movie of FRIDA, starring the extraordinary actress Salma Hayek. The movie is based on the life of Frida Kahlo, the famed Mexican artist, who was married at the age of 22 to her mentor and much-older friend Diego Riviera, Communist, mural painter, philanderer...perhaps the most recognizable Mexican artist in the world.

The movie FRIDA is as extraordinary as Salma Hayek's performance. The colors, the architectural structures and sets, the special visual effects, the costumes, and the music are spectacular.  The film was nominated for six Academy Awards and won for best original score and best makeup.

Please do not buy this one disc edition of Frida. For $3 more you may purchase the two disc set with a whole disc of special features including conversations and commentary by the talented director Julie Taymor (who directed the stage version of THE LION KING) and actress Salma Hayek, a biography of Kahlo, special visual effects pieces... all with the haunting Mexican music in the background. The ISBN for the two disc set is 0-7888-4498-9. Putting this ISBN in Amazon's search engine will take you to the set. (While you are at the two disc set page...please read Mark Barry's excellent and glowing 5 star review that relates many biographical tidbits and lists all the wonderful features.)

Unfortunately, none of Kahlo's works are in the 95 piece collection at the Cummer. There is one small photo or black/white portrait of her that recalled this movie. Fortunately, I have time to revisit the exhibition and view that small, framed, and special picture of FRIDA!",1340668800,2,1907,5.041269841269841
1519431,5,B00005JLPK,"I had a feeling that this would be an exceptional BLU RAY reissue and I'm glad to be proven right.

The picture quality is uniformly gorgeous and highlights the vivid array of expertly researched detail the 150-strong production company filled every scene with - Mexican clothing, terracotta interiors, chaotic art studios and colonial South American buildings. Its default aspect is 1.78:1 - so it fills the entire screen without stretching or loss of clarity. You combine this with a sympathetically-written script, brilliant acting and a genuinely affecting and unfolding story (never mind the huge amount of EXTRAS transferred in full from the DVD - see list below) and the whole experience is a joy to re-watch and re-discover.

The first thing that strikes you about the print is that 'colour' is everywhere. It opens in Mexico in 1922 when Frida Kahlo is a precocious 15 year-old and able-bodied (before her horrific accident) and over the course of the movie progresses nearly 30 years hence - so lighting - textures - interiors - all have to be matched. The Blues, Reds, Yellows and Gold are full on and evoke a Mexico of the period (all beautifully done by Production Designer Felipe Fernandez - Oscar nominated for his work here).

The autobiographical nature of her art is captured in cleverly woven-in scenes and her painful injuries/nightmares are portrayed at times by grotesque animation peopled from her canvas creations. Frida suffered back pain all her life (an iron rod skewered her abdomen and uterus in the accident) and famously painted lying down with a mirror over her bed (she later had toes and a leg amputated due to her injuries). Yet she defied all expectations and after two years in casts managed to walk again. Taymor's movie fills the screen with this - her spirit, her driving need to matter and her bisexual lovelife and gender-bender dress sense. This is a world where politics and passion are seething in the streets - and boozy nights are spent discussing the first and engaging in the second...

The cast is large and seriously talented - and Frida is a role Salma Hayek openly admits she'd always wanted to play. The worst you could say about her performance is that her beauty and astonishing sensuality sometimes hinder believability. But she gives her all and her supporting cast are so well chosen that her film-star looks get quickly forgotten. Given the depth and difficulty of the part - her nomination for Best Actress in a Leading Role is richly deserved.

And while Ashley Judd (her dialogue discussing their marriage titles this review), Geoffrey Rush, Edward Norton, Antonio Banderas, and Roger Rees all contribute their vignettes with heart and commitment - the film's real ace-in-the-hole is ALFRED MOLINA. He is simply astonishing as Diego Rivera - the Mexican murals painter who married Frida in 1929 at the age of 43 when she was only 22. Diego was a fat ugly man who became her mentor, lover and on/off husband for 25 years. Loveable one minute, loathsome the next - the film is so much better because he's in it (Salma sings his praises in the extras). A lecher, habitual womanizer and a serious-minded Communist - it's a ludicrously difficult part to nail - yet Molina is never anything less than brilliant. Charming at first when he's getting what he wants (wooing Frida in the alley outside his studio) - then to his wandering glassy eyes as infidelity creeps to the surface (watching her sing at a party, but eyeing the other women there) - he later crosses the line completely by sleeping with her sister (fathered a child by her too). The big question is - why did a woman as smart and as committed to loyalty as Frida - countenance this boor for even a second? Friends gave their union 'two months' - her own mother described their marriage as being between ""...an elephant and a dolphin..."" The answer the film tells us is LOVE.

In interviews, Director Julie Taymor states that both she and Salma returned to Frida's diaries and found they were not about betrayal and men-as-pigs (as many feminists feel) - they were all about Diego and her. Frida really loved him - admired him - supported him. Of course she wanted to slit his throat on several occasions - and was ultimately broken by him (the scene where she cuts her hair is particularly powerful) - but she seemed to stick with his first wife's advice and accept the rough with the smooth because the overall gain was worth it (""...He's the best of friends and the worst of husbands.""). It's an odd relationship in an oddball world. Yet both Hayek and Molina are so believable that when the film morphs from one of her paintings of the married couple standing in a room into the actors playing them - it's hard to tell the difference. Taymor (who devoted almost two years of her life to the project) does well to rescue Frida from self-pity and loathing - showing instead her courage and joie-de-vive - her fierce loyalty no matter what. Her partner Elliot Goldenthal also provided the film with a beautifully apt Latin guitar score (for which he won the Oscar).

To sum up - it was never going to be an easy task to film the life of this icon of Mexican art (Frida) and interpret her tumultuous lifelong relationship with another free soul (Diego) - yet both June Taymor and Salma Hayek pulled it off admirably. It was nominated for six Oscars and won two - Best Make Up and Best Original Music. You can't help but think it should have won more (especially for its two leads)...

A quality BLU RAY reissue then - and like a good political knees-up with Leon Trotsky - wholeheartedly recommended.

The first thing that struck me was the rich colours and beautiful locations throughout and this makes for a very visually stunning film. Frida comes across as passionate and joyfully and fiercely independent and Hayek's portrayal is exceptional, I have never seen her act as well as this. Alfred Molina is also amazing and the supporting cast (which includes Ashley Judd, Antonio Banderas, Ed Norton and Geoffrey Rush) also put out impressive performances. There is beautiful framing of certain scenes and the direction is a real highlight; there is wonderful use of cinematic techniques (like quirky animations and living paintings) that heighten and add to the overall feel. The music also stands out and is both atmospheric and evocative and stirs your emotions along with the scenes on screen. Not only is the story of Frida's life compelling and fascinating, this film also gives a deeper insight and understanding behind the emotion and meaning in her art. I look at her work now with a fresh eye and renewed appreciation. Her artwork is put into context with her life and has more meaning as a result. This is a beautiful film, about a uncompromising, passionate artist and makes for a couple of hours engrossing, stirring viewing and comes highly recommended indeed.

1519555,5,B00005JLPK,"Frida is a phenomenal epic. It doesn't illustrate the life of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo. It draws you into that life. Visually and emotionally arresting, such satisfying films are rare to come by.

Young, vivacious Frida Kahlo is crippled in a bus accident. But even though her body turns on her, her spirit comes to life and she resolves to live life to its fullest. Her two greatest companions are the canvas and her husband, passionate and communistic playboy Diego Rivera. Their life together is not so much a rocky road but one littered with mountains. Slowly, her body gets more of a burden as well. Yet through all of that, her art keeps her strong.

Frida is such a joy to behold because it invites the audience along to experience all of the aforementioned. Not once are we reminded of the fact that this is a movie. This is the potential of cinema realised; to draw the audience into the world presented before them. Frida Kahlo not only creates her paintings, but we are somehow drawn into the world of the paintings themselves. So we get to explore Frida Kahlo's mind as well as her surroundings, and not only are we dazzled by this tempestuous woman, we also understand her pain and, even more amazingly, her art as a consequence.

Salma Hayek is utterly phenomenal in the leading role. She IS Frida Kahlo, not Salma Hayek portraying her. She even looks the part so well that the film often draws the audience into her paintings, through Salma Hayek, and it's hard to spot the difference. Alfred Molina is stunning as her impossible significant other Diego. All of the cast deliver stellar performances, but these two carry the whole ensemble on their shoulders, and they do it with grace.

Boy is this a gorgeous film! We don't just see the lavish parties, we take part in them. There is such a feisty passion pumping throughout this entire picture. There is a rich use of warm, delicious colours. Very often, the gap between the world and Frida Kahlo's art diminishes, with spectacular results. This is one wild story, and the two-hour running time feels like it passes in no time at all. Frida is a triumph of a film, a spicy and delicious dish.",1287532800,,2163,4.639686684073107

1519557,5,B00005JLPK,"The film gives a colourful rendition of Frida Kalho's life,played engagingly by Salma Hayek who physically resembles her. Diego Rivera(""I paint what I see"") is superbly played by Alfred Molina. Kalho's paintings now possibly are more famous than Rivera's mural works due to the inseparability of her life and work,her paintings are her biography. Born with the Revolutionary generation,we get the early meeting with Rivera in which she shows her paintings to the great muralist of revolutionary Mexico. Prior to this we get the early trolley crash that debilitates her for life,preventing her having children,and waging a life-long battle against pain,but giving her the time to paint. She specializes in portraits. Her work uses vibrant,beautiful colours.

Rivera,being a philanderer, marries her following 2 divorces,in 1929. Her pain and Diego both contribute causes of emotional trauma as well as being the sources of her art. Both artists shared a similar political viewpoint as communist militants. Kalho says she `suffered 2 grave accidents in my life. One in which a streetcar knocked me down...The other is Diego.'Her father is an Austrian Jew and photographer who wants her to get on and her mother is a traditional,pious, lady from a Spanish-Indian background. The film is shot in the ""Blue""House where she was born in Coyoacan, and lived with Diego from 1929-1954. We see the parrots,monkeys,peacocks,dogs roaming the residence. Her love of nature is shown in her work,she suckles on the teat of an nanny with Aztec mask. Her self-portraits are replete with monkeys and parrots. Her mother is Mexico. Diego is her frog prince.

In 1932 Rivera was commissioned to paint a major series of murals for the Detroit Museum, and here Kahlo suffered a miscarriage. While recovering, she painted Miscarriage in Detroit, the first of her truly penetrating self-portraits. The style she evolved was entirely unlike that of her husband, being based on Mexican folk art and in particular on the small votive pictures known as retablos, which the pious dedicated in Mexican churches. Rivera's reaction to his wife's work was, however, both perceptive and generous: ""Frida began work on a series of masterpieces which had no precedent in the history of art - paintings which exalted the feminine quality of truth, reality, cruelty and suffering. Never before had a woman put such agonized poetry on canvas as Frida did at this time in Detroit""

Rivera has exhibitions and work in America but the mural he did for Rockefeller in New York was destroyed because he would not remove the head of Lenin. Frida called it `Gringoland'and they are shown working back in Mexico City in the Casa Azul and San Angel studios. Frida is dressed in Tehuana costumes of Indian maidens. They both pursue affairs,he with her sister then with an actress. She with a singer or later after their remarriage with Trotsky(Rush)before he gets assassinated with an ice pick by a Soviet agent. She exhibits in Paris, wanting to be independent of Rivera. Her many operations are hinted at and her deteriorations(her toes then her leg gets amputated),wearing a steel corset. He was protective of his 'chicuita'.

Taymor, the director, creates atmosphere through the playing of Mexican folk songs, the animations of several of her paintings,shooting in the arcades and courtyards of municipal buildings and the ebb and flow of their love. She embodied alegria-lust for life and displayed an extrovert, black humour and sharp wit behind her unibrowed features,concealing her vulnerability and extreme sensitivity. Although a surrealist,her painting is realistic,down to earth,depicting real images in the most literal way. Her art interweaves fact and fantasy, both equally real. Her art is intensely personal, visionary about sensations,statements of mind and feelings of pain. Her only exhibition in Mexico comes before her death, when she is carried into the gallery. Rivera praises work'acid and tender,hard as steel and delicate and fine as a butterfly's wing,loveable as a beautiful smile,and profound and cruel as the bitterness of life'.They both thought each other was the better artist. He made the""Blue""House a museum after her death,dying 3 years later.",1281830400,2,4231,5.263703703703704

The film emphasizes decently on Mrs Kahlo's life, throws immense light on her persona and outlook, and we, the audience witness what Frida the woman was all about and Salma Hayek successfully delivers a performance that gives us much more than just satisfaction. Alfred Molina gives his most probable best performance as 'Diego', such a flamboyant actor indeed who shows up having a great chemistry with Hayek on screen which almost glues your attention. A remarkable performance from almost everyone in the film. Witness Frida Kahlo, explore the seductive and mysterious lady, explore the artist in her, explore her heart and soul, you won't be disapointed.",1279411200,2,699,5.1946902654867255

Frida's talent, her independent mind,  her life time struggle with pain and her personal determination to express herself are all excellently portrayed.

Frida's paintings were recreated as ""freeze frames"" which came to life at various pivotal points though out the movie giving a powerful melding of her art and her circumstance.  The accurate historic Mexican folkloric costuming was stunning. Even the Casa Le Azul --her Blue House-- was accurately recreated.

The director has done a wonderfully artistic job while accurately depicting the times and the struggles Frida and Diego endured.  Listening to the interviews on DVD#2 were also fascinating.

I'll enjoy this movie again and again.",1271116800,,914,5.3426573426573425
1519561,5,B00005JLPK,"Salma Kahlo
By Marcielle Brandler

I saw a Biography segment on A&E Channel on Salma Hayek of whom I was vaguely aware. She was shopping her biographical Frida Kahlo idea around Hollywood. Thank God she did not allow them overlay what I call the Hollywood Formula onto her idea. She finally got Julie Taymor (Lion King stage play) to direct it, and what direction it was! The colors! The moods, everything was so Mexican! Taymor's experience with puppetry was put to dazzling use in the entire film. I was blown away by her dream-like, or (should I say) nightmare-like sequence of doctors and spines, revealing the poignancy of Frida's physical pain and hospital stays. It was comic and horrific, harking back to Day-of-the-Dead comi-tragic imagery.

Kayak's courage in attempting some daring scenes and appropriate nudity caused me to admire this beautiful model. There is an erotic spirituality about this film. It is very woman-like, also with remnants of what among poets and fiction writers used to be called Magical Realism, peculiar to Latino writers of this century.

I enjoyed Frida's manly qualities and wondered if they really belonged to her or merely of Salma's interpretation of her. When Frida dances with Ashley Judd, I felt the sexual tension coming from Salma but not from Judd. In an interview, Judd said that scene made her uncomfortable. That moment was lacking for me, possibly because I have seen real tango dancers in Argentina with the sensually arrogant machismo both the male and female dancers exude.

A friend of mine complained that there was one huge flaw in the film. The real Frida Kahlo had several parrots and other birds in her home. Yes, that was part of Kahlo's life, but there were so many startling moments, that such a detail does not matter a damn to me. I told my friend that perhaps since it was such a complicated film to direct. that more animals would be a distraction from the story's tension. Bird images are very common to those who know, even peripherally, Frida Kahlo's paintings.

In other countries, people really do spontaneously break into song, and in this film such moments occured at just the right time to bare Frida's anguish and touch our souls.

It can be a temptation to make an unfaithful lover look like a complete cad, but Alfred Molina manages to play Diego Rivera (Frida's famous artist husband) as simpatico. We love him in spite of his numerous transgressions. That, in itself is a real coup.

Its the kind of movie that you need to watch more than once. For anyone interested in Frida's work, I highly recommend it.",1262649600,,420,4.072289156626506
1519614,4,B00005JLPK,"A wonderful movie about a famed relationship between opposites who were simply meant for each other.  If it were a book I'd be writing that I couldn't put it down.  The visual treat was just as delicious as the dialogue and the music, not to mention the historical aspect.  I was entranced by it all as the movie whisked me away to an earlier time in a place foreign yet familiar.

The love story of Frida and Diego was masterly played by the two main characters.  Each was definitely the strength that inspired the other in their art.  My only critique of the movie was in having to hear the non-Spanish language cast attempt a Spanish accent when speaking English.  Short of using mostly all Spanish actors perhaps this was unavoidable.  The accents sounded okay until you heard those of Frida (played by Salma Hayek) or Antonio Banderas's character or any of the native Spanish speaking actors/actresses.  It was like tasting honey in your first cup of tea, then having someone add a sugar substitute like sweet and low in your second cup.  You still had a sweetness in your brew but the natural sweetener was noticeably missing.

Frida Kahlo, a free thinking woman in love with a free loving man. A must movie for women and men who wonder why they stay in relationships after hurting one another so cruelly. It begs the question, what will you give up for love?",1253664000,,1365,4.599173553719008
1519615,5,B00005JLPK,"Selma Hayek is awesome as Frida Kahlo in this beautifully told story of this phenomenal artists life. Marrying to her womanizing lover Diego Sanchez really helped fuel the emotional distress that artists require to create with such intensity. As if her damaged physical state wasn't enough, the heart ache of her wandering lover helped push her over the top in my opinion and fueled what became a lifetime of masterpieces.

This story is warm, sad, funny and inspiring and it would seem that Selma had a great deal of respect for the woman she portrays so well in this work of art on film. By far and away the best movie I have seen to date, If the dialogue alone doesn't do it for you then certainly the set of 1930's Mexico City will. Rich and beautiful in all arena's: sound, site, time period and ideological social sub-cultures.

1519703,4,B00005JLPK,"I recently read an article in the New York Review of Books (May 15, 2008) analyzing the work of the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo that reminded me how much I liked this film, especially the performance by Ms. Hayek (who received an Oscar nomination for her efforts and who bore a striking resemblance to Frida in the film). The gist of the article, which included some biographical detail that is also explored here (her various severe mental and physical problems, his stormy relationship with her fellow artist and husband the world famous muralist Diego Rivera, her bisexuality), is that while much of Kahlo's artistic work reflected her strong psychic attachment to Mexico it also placed her squarely in the camp of naturalist painters.

I am not enough of an art devotee to make comment on that above mentioned critique, however, from the several paintings of Kahlo's that I have seen I would argue a little more toward the surrealist school that virtually every Mexican artist in the 1920's and 1930's drew from as they created their work. But enough of that argument for now. This film, in its own round about way, by presenting the various psychic pains (failure to have the children she desperately wanted, her topsy- turvy relationship with Rivera as she tries to make her own space in the art world and the underlying tensions of combining politics and artistic endeavor) gives a fairly decent gloss, for a commercial film, on the trials and tribulations of being a Mexican woman artist in the early part of the 20th century.

Of course, for this political junkie and admirer of Leon Trotsky the names Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera conjure up political connections as much as art. One of the strands working its way through the film is this couple's relationship with the exiled Trotsky when President Cardenas granted him a visa in 1937. All sources that I have read and photographs that I have seen have mentioned that Trotsky was smitten with Frida's exotic beauty (to the furor of his companion, Natalia). However, it was rather startling to watch the episode where Trotsky jumps into bed with Ms. Kahlo. I have noted elsewhere that the old time revolutionaries, especially the Russians, were extremely reticent about discussing personal sexual matters in their memoirs and autobiographies. Trotsky was no exception. Is that scene merely cinematic license or was Trotsky really just a dirty old man? You decide. I will concentrate of his political wisdom. And Frida's strangely exotic paintings.",1210723200,,2506,4.978520286396181

1519705,4,B00005JLPK,"It is a great story but beyond that it is  beautifully filmed cinema & some of Hayek's best work to date.
As portrayed, Frida was quite a woman. She was severely injured early in  life leaving her with lifelong disabilities. The bus accident was recreated in horrific detail. An excellently produced scene.
A gifted artist, she was mentored by by Diego Rivera, well done by Alfred Molina. He was perhaps Mexico's most celebrated artist & leader of the Communist party as was Frida in the 30's. He was a serial cheat & knowing this Frida became his third wife. Frida: ""Will you always be faithful?"" Diego: ""I will always be loyal.""  To his chagrin, she become good friends with his second wife. She was a better artist than he but not nearly as well known. He received a commission from Rockefeller. She sublimated everything for her husband's career & traveled with him to the US, probably to keep an eye on him. He could have been internationally famous but would not soften his communism, & lost his commission. She also traveled to France. The movie claims she had an affair with Leon Trosky. He was a guest in her home on the run from Stalin. After he left the security of her home he was assassinated. She had always desired her own show but that did not happen until she was bed-ridden & near death.
There is a lengthy interview extra on the dvd with Salma Hayek. She is beautiful & seems very nice. There is a great bit of detail on the making of the movie, her decision on the director & the life of Frida.",1206144000,,1514,4.458483754512636
1519706,5,B00005JLPK,"I recently watched this for the second time after initially watching it some years ago and was even more impressed the second time around. While the reasons might not interest anyone but me, the fact is, this movie touched me and moved me deeply. For starters, it is a gorgeous film to watch. The seamless integration of live actors into Kahlo's stunning and evocative work is a magical joy to behold and adds even more depth to the artist's brutally candid art. Secondly, Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina deliver top notch performances and most impressive may have been Hayek who is on screen nearly the entire time. I can forgive the vanity hiring of Ashley Judd and Edward Norton as their portrayals are less than the aforementioned two, but this is a minor issue. Lastly, regarding the dvd features and what-not, the second disc is mostly behind the scenes featurettes on the making of the movie whereas the special features on the first disc have lengthy interviews that are illuminating and candid while demonstrating the love Hayek and Taymor have for Kahlo.
I am not a Frida Kahlo scholar by any means nor do I wish to convey any knowledge of her art, life, politics, or anything else. I know that I find her paintings to be vivid and mesmerizing and that's enough for me. I am grateful to this movie for giving me an introduction to an artist whose work I have grown fascinated with and I am furthermore glad that I have a little knowledge, albeit Hollywoodized, of this remarkable human being.

Besides the fact that the film tries really hard to come off as artsy, Hayek's acting shows too much effort and the continuously very short sequences have a TV sit-com feel.

Hollywood loves taking stories like these and making lives that are degenerate look like sacrifices for noble causes be it art, politics or love.  In the end Kahlo and Rivera were great artists and poor humanitarians, with a penchant for stupidity.  From this movie you'd think that's a wonderful thing.

It must be hard to make movies about artists because there are so few that are that good.  Pollock, Vincent And Theo, Basquiat, Lust For Life, Modigliani, Surviving Picasso all were enjoyable films in degrees; but they all focused on and romanticized some of the worst aspects of the artists' lives like egotism, womanizing, alcoholism, mental illness, and drug addiction, and rarely show the more vulnerable weakness's that was the cause of the problems. The characters in all those movies just end up seeming like two-dimensional modern cliches of what we expect from artists.

Unfortunately, in the outspoken and dramatic hands of Salma Hayek, Frida Kahlo's story becomes a mediocre soap opera. Hayak shows her breasts a few times to keep the boys interested; there are some lesbian interludes to show Frida's bisexual side; Diego comes and goes and has sex with everyone he can. Hayak plays it as a modern and brash young woman full of herself and the world.

I thought we might learn about: Mexico in the 1920s-30s and the communist influence there; Frida's art; Rivera's art; other artists; art & communism; Frida's family; Rivera's family; Frida's motivations. We get a little of this but it mostly revolves around blood and sex.

The script is TV-grade, with dramatic pauses and shallow talk. The direction is weak and distracting, especially when collages are used to depict places and events.

1519759,5,B00005JLPK,"...At least in this genre. It is the story of life itself. It is the story of triumph of humanity and a compelling example of basic human spirit in its true nature to be basically noble.

To this is added another of the many possible features of our humanity which exist seemingly almost randomly in humans- namely colorful, lively and spirited disposition, beauty and appreciation of beauty. It shows that the pain and misery of the reality which is human life is eventually worth living. And that is because life is beautiful and the world is a truly beautiful place not least because of this unique animal and its fallible humanity.

And it also shows that it is humanity itself which is solely able to understand this beauty especially/or those in the world of spirit (as Frida Kahlo is a great example). It has been able to catch the very spirit of a human being, a spirit which in its uncorrupted and virtuous form is common to all humanity. Perhaps thats the very meaning of it.

Finally, it is a proof of the fact that beauty is as much in the object beheld as it is in the beholder. (I believe 'beauty lies in the eye of the beholder' is a wrong philosophy, or at least half true, and such philosophies often come to be understood as negation of the other possibility as for example the above is a result of such popular ideas as relativism etc).

Frida Kahlo is a person who is broken inside and outside. She wields a broken body and a broken heart but she has an invincible spirit. She is beaten by the stick that is life only for her to love it more each and every time. In the final battle the spirit triumphs to which she testified as such:

In the last painting short while before she died she signed it Viva La Vida, translated approximately as Long live Life. In her diary her last words were ""I hope the exit is joyful; and I hope never to return. This was a woman who was almost an atheist (father Jewish, mother devout Christian and husband atheist), a communist who supported Stalin passionately and helped him win some public support in Latin America, was highly impressed with Mao and was a Lesbian.

In short, she lived a highly impassioned, acutely aware and spirited and colorful life. Even though it was highly scandalous and sinful this was a kind of a rebellion of the spirit against the so called morality (morality for the sake of morality) and societal righteousness. Almost saintly yet so blasphemous!

To understand and fully appreciate the movie, the woman and the times; preliminary understanding of art is highly recommended though not necessary- more certainly would help. A sense of history and culture of the time and an interest in Latin history and culture especially would be of great use.

The acting of all cast is breathtaking especially of Salma Hayek, Alfred Molino and even that of small roles like Diegos first wifes and the Latino singers etc. Frida is primarily a musical with an extraordinary and heart rending music score comprised of much ethnic and folk music and a blend of beautiful modern songs. Finally the highest prize and the crown of the effort I think should go to the director who has done a tremendous and almost perfect job. Notice for example the different camera affects and color schemed employed. For example, Fridas silhouette almost always is strikingly colorful in the foreground compared to drab and almost colorless rest of the world. The movie has immense but subtle details.

I would highly recommend reading about Frida Kahlo and going through her art and biogrpahy. Her life is a real life Tolstoy or Jane Austin novel or even Shakespears play or Emily Dickinson poetry!

The wonderful tiring puzzle!

The merciless beautiful flower!

Viva La Vida!

Truly the movie itself is a work of great art. Two thumbs up.

I don't speak French, but knew some basic details about Frida & Diego Rivera, had heard of the dust-up with Rockefeller and had seen Rivera's murals in Mexico City, so was able to follow most of the plot. Next day I ordered the DVD & played it in English) over & over again till the fabulous music score & the song ""Burn this bed, Burn it blue..."" rang in my head for days.

The film is visually stunning (from the vibrant colours of the locations and costumes to Frida's paintings), the characters fascinating & the music score haunting.

It is set in the lively world of culture & society in Mexico between the two World Wars - a hotbed of politics, music, literature & avant-garde art - everybody who was anybody in the 1930's went to Mexico for a good time. It focuses on the tumultuous life of the Mexican-born artist Frida Kahlo, who was married to the larger-than-life muralist Diego Rivera.

Frida's work is very surrealist, very personal, exotic, original and unforgettable. The director Julie Taymor has done a wonderful job of suggesting how Frida's life experiences melded into her painting. Lesser artists since have imitated Frida's style, but none of them have portrayed the inner world of pain and blood as Frida did.

Taymor's commentary on the DVD is valuable for the additional insights it provides on Frida's art, life and times.

There are only 5 films produced so far in the 21st century that are worth the time it takes to watch them & I no longer recall what the other 4 are.

Salma Hayek captures the enigmatic essence of artist Frida Kahlo and Alfred Molina gives a fine performance as husband, compadre, and artist Diego Rivera. I was equally amazed with Geoffrey Rush's performance as Leon Trotsky.

The movie chronicles Frida's life and together we share her struggles as well as her courage and triumphs. We understand how she transferred pain to the canvas. It was Frida's coping mechanism. We learn something of the history of Mexico and the world at that time. And we cheer for a group of people who wanted to make the world a better place.

In one scene, Frida, Diego, Leon Trotsky, and friends are sitting around the dinner table discussing politics. The scene was electrically charged with an esprit de corps - created by the actors and no doubt pulled from the characters.

The soundtrack is one I listen to again and again. Lila Downs sings ""La Llorona"" with Mariachi Juvenil de Tecalitlan at the end of the movie - for Frida's Exhibition. It's an significant moment and a powerful way to conclude a wonderful story.",1168041600,,1112,4.746113989637306

1519822,4,B00005JLPK,"'Frida' is a rich and passionate account of two celebrated Mexican artists, whose lives were bound up with major events of the 20th century-the Mexican and Russian Revolutions... The film takes us at the center of the art world in one of the most tumultuous alliance between two painters, an alliance filled with joy and heartbreak, love and betrayal...

Frida and Diego are two dynamic artists of extraordinary and diverse talents... While Diego's work is more public and monumental, Frida's paintings are grotesque and intimate on a much smaller scale...

The film chronicles Frida's audacious self-introduction to the great muralist Diego Rivera, and her physical ailments... There is pain in this woman's life, a pain she don't deserve to have, a pain no one deserves to have... There's a line in the film where Kahlo says, 'at the end of the day, we can all endure much more than we think we can.' and I think this one line resumes everything about her...

Salma Hayek proves herself that she's more than just another pretty face... Salma is full of vigor as the angry strong-willed female artist caught in a net of pain... It's pleasing to see Hayek in a production where she is totally confidant, sexy and lusty in an uncomplicated way... Salma captures the spirit of Frida and plays it with heart and style, longing for the healing touch... She dances a provocative tango with Ashley Judd, and goes to Paris to explore her bisexual side...

The chemistry between Salma and Molina is terrific... Her passion for art is overtaken by her passion for him... She expresses her emotions by teasing him, by playing practical jokes, by exciting the jealousy of his wonderful wife, Lupe Marin (Valeria Golino).

But Frida remains in Rivera's shadow... She calls herself ""a charming amateur."" She focuses on her expressive self portraits of her physical pain, anger, and disappointment... Yet while viewers are left with the impression that there is undoubtedly more to Frida's life than what appears on screen, what we get instead is a love story, a tale of Frida's romantic, and tempestuous union to the unfaithful husband she marries twice and never stopped to love...

London-born actor Alfred Molina is absolutely splendid as the lovable Rivera... He is a well-known womanizer who can never be faithful to any woman... Diego is a painter of conviction... A revolutionary painter who believes in Frida's anguished brush, and championed her work... He decides to create paintings which would speak directly to the common people...

In a motion picture that sweeps from the late 1920s into the 1950s, Julie Taymor proves to be a director of taste and sensitivity... She captures the mood of the moment with genuine flair and style... Her imagery is exciting, and we are convinced that we are seeing Mexico in the first half of the 1900s, with its native markets, textiles, music, and food... Julie Taymor infuses it with elements of Frida's artistic creativity, bringing much of her work to life... Her film was nominated for six Academy Awards...

Vague references to the political struggle between Trotsky and Stalin make their way into the script... The film ignores Siqueiros' central role in the unsuccessful attempt on Trotsky's life in 1940... But the motion picture details the mistake of Nelson Rockefeller commissioning Rivera a huge fresco for his public hall...",1167436800,,3373,5.021466905187835
1519823,3,B00005JLPK,"Despite the fact Salma Hayek not only has a monobrow but also a moustache (and god knows where else she was hairy!), she still looks stunning. It's the worst possible look a girl could go for, and definitely made me reach for the tweezers after watching Frida.

Salma Hayek went all out to get this movie the greenlight. I personally didn't know who the hell Frida was before watching the film, and after, I know she's an artist. But what else can you learn about Frida? She was a very open minded girl, not afraid of her own sexuality, and Salma as an actress is not ashamed of her body. After a very painful accident (which is followed by a weird surreal, drug induced dream, that the hospital is manned by skeletons), most of Frida's life is in paintings. Everything came out, and although some of her paintings were very strange, some of them could make your heart break.

Frida's relationship with Diego, (played by Alfred Molina, who put on 50lbs to play the role) is complicated at that. He regularly cheated, she yelled, she threw him out, only to discover she couldn't live without him. It's a love that stayed, despite the cheating, and she did her fair share too.

There's a whole host of recognisable faces in this, including Antonio Banderas in a blink-and-you'll-miss-him role, and Ashley Judd, Also, the gorgeous Valeria Golino, who I recognised from Rain Man, and is just as gorgeous as she was then.

Frida is a very emotional film, but it's not that memorable after finishing it. It leaves the viewer with no lasting impression, and you'll forget it the next day. Just keep plucking your eyebrows and bleaching your moustache.",1163462400,,1644,4.697916666666667
1519824,5,B00005JLPK,"Frida is luscious eye candy from beginning to end; so beautiful it could be enjoyed without sound.  This is due to its subject, its star, and its director, Julie Taymor, who also gave us the astounding Titus.  (If you have not yet seen Titus, do so before finishing this review - it is an art director's tour de force on a par with Brazil.)

Regardless of where one falls on the political spectrum, one can't help but be intrigued by the fascinating, and certainly unconventional, people of Frida.  Diego Rivera, played superbly by Alfred Molina, boasted the traditional faults of great artists, (narcissism, thoughtless cruelty, obsessive egotism), while showcasing some exceptional ones, (art as propaganda device, naive political idealism).  His flaws were as large as his murals, but he was never dull.

In addition to starring as Frida, Salma Hayek co-produced the film and pretty much moved heaven and earth to get it made.  How wonderful that she did.  Hayek has traveled under a Hollywood curse, appearing in one dreadful picture after another.  This is clearly the film she wants to be remembered by, and her performance is note perfect.  The story is so full of pain and passion that it could easily become maudlin and goopy, but Hayek never lets that happen.  Her Frida is heart and steel all at once - amazing.

The take home message, if there is one, is that great art is never free.  In the case of Rivera, others paid the price; he fed off others like a greedy child.  In the case of Frida Kahlo, she herself paid the price, digging further and further into her own pain and laying it bare in a way that is almost unspeakably brave.  There are moments of magic realism in Frida, where we move imperceptibly from the filmed image to paintings and vice versa - if nothing else this reveals the paintings for what they were, astounding autobiographical statements.

There are a few missteps.  The liaisons with Trotsky and Josephine Baker feel almost obligatory, as if a form is being filled out.  But blemishes this small are overshadowed by so many splendid moments, for example, when Rivera's dog urinates on his painting and he responds by calling him the best art critic in Mexico.

I do know that with the background knowledge I have given them (articles, documentary film), they are chomping at the bit to see this production. Personally, I believe it is the best representation of any artist I have ever studied. I would put ""Frida"" in the same category as ""Lust for Life"", the story of Vincent Van Gogh portrayed by Kirk Douglas and the ""uppety"" Gauguin (Anthony Quinn). Salma's portrayal of the mentally and physically wounded wife/artist are right on the mark. If you have read Frida's writings or studied her at all you will appreciate the richness of Salma's portrayal of her. The colors and sheer vibrance of the film transport you into her world.

One of the interesting visual masterpieces of this film is showing the transformation of Frida's childhood home as a lifelong artistic project.

Julie Taymor does an excellent job of directing, the art direction is phenomenal, and Selma Hayek does a wonderful job of inhabiting this role.

1519881,5,B00005JLPK,"I am always a little aprehensive about ""art movies"".  I should clarify that I use the term to mean movies about great artists (as opposed to what used to be the term to describe movies coming out of France and Scandanavia).  The reason for my reluctance is that, if the art itself doesn't impress me, then the movie probably won't either.  However, I recently watched ""Amadeus"" for the first time and was greatly impressed.  So, when I saw ""Frida"" on IFC's schedule, I thought I'd take a chance on that one as well.  Thank goodness that I did.  This, too, is an impressive movie.

I will admit that I knew nothing about the true-life artist, Frida Kahlo, although I vaguely recognized the name of her husband, Diego Rivera.  I'm sure that ""Frida"" must have been an exceptional experience for those who were already fans of her work before the movie came out.  However, I was impressed that prior knowledge of the woman was not a requirement for being able to enjoy ""Frida"".  The impact of the movie came from its' portrayal of the artist first and the art second.  Frida Kahlo was a vibrant woman who overcame many things because of her passion for life and love.  She backed-off for no one, even her wandering husband.  She overcame a serious accident that left her in pain and follow-up surgeries most of her life.  She did not compromise on expectations of anyone, including herself.  All of this we saw through the excellent directing of Julie Taymor and the Academy Award-nominated acting of Salma Hayek in the title role.  I did not see Nichole Kidman in ""The Hours"" so I can't complain too loudly about the injustice of Hayek not winning the award.  Let's just say that, if and when I get around to seeing ""The Hours"", I'll be expecting a lot.

The use of art in ""Frida"" was expected but the unique ways that it was blended in were exceptionally well-done.  History plays an important role in ""Frida"" as well with the assassination of Leon Trotsky (gee, I sure hope I'm not giving anything away with that) being a special focal point for me.

""Amadeus"" excelled in how it brought the man, the music and the times to life.  ""Frida"" excels by doing as well in all three areas.  I may prefer Wolfgang and his music to Frida and her art but I must confess that Frida and her art stand pretty high in my opinion after watching ""Frida"".",1140480000,3,2337,4.54066985645933

1519883,5,B00005JLPK,"Watching Frida requires a little suspension of disbelief, since we have Mexicans in their home country speaking English.  Purists desired a Spanish soundtrack, and perhaps a Latin director, but if you can move past that, Frida is an amazing movie.

This film is visually stunning.  Frida's paintings morph out of the scenes of her life, and the colors throughout this film are absolutely amazing.  This is a film that made me want to learn more about the life of Frida Kahlo, and anyone who is familiar with her paintings will love seeing them come to life on the big screen.

Salma Hayek acts beautifully, but Alfred Molina nearly steals the screen with his portrayal of painter Diego Rivera.  Their troubled relationship makes this a romance/drama, but politics (communism) also play a huge role in their lives.  Frida is a masterpiece of a film, well deserving of critical acclaim.",1135641600,3,884,4.9324324324324325
1519884,2,B00005JLPK,"At the risk of appearing ""artistically uncouth,"" I must admit (in hushed tones) that I did not find Frida interesting enough to even see it through to the end.  Urged by several acquaintances to experience this movie not only on the merit of its emotionally stirring story but for its visual effects as well, I was eager to give it a try.  I did feel drawn in at the beginning of the movie as Frida struggled through a harrowing recuperation from her injuries in a bus accident and discovered her talents in art in the process.  But not long after she began to get serious about art as a career and met up with Rivera, I began to feel that I was merely an observer to an endless parade of the artist's questionable personal actions, provided with little or no understanding as to the underlying reasons for those actions.  I think it was this lack of depth that caused my interest to wane.  The fact that there is little character development or even character understanding in Frida is not surprising since this is often the case with real-life stories.  But it does not make for a satisfying movie experience if this is what you enjoy.  As for the visual effects - supposedly a treat for the senses - I didn't find them particularly noteworthy.  If you're interested in a glimpse into Frida Kahlo's life story as an artist that you admire, then you probably won't be disappointed because the movie brings her story to life, but if you are looking for some level of emotional intimacy with the main character, you may very well be.",1134864000,14,1532,4.545454545454546
1519885,3,B00005JLPK,"Hard to rate this movie on the Amazon ""star"" system.  I don't think Selma Hayek is a great actress -- beautiful woman; a beautiful presence, and there's lots of feeling in her performance here -- but, Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera acts rings around her.  He's the linchpin of the movie; he inhabits this role completely and he IS Diego Rivera.  Selma Hayek's performance as Frida can't compare to that type of acting.  She's ""like"" Frida Kahlo, but she's still Selma Hayek playing Frida Kahlo.

Some scenes are brilliantly conceived (particularly, the bus accident and its aftermath).  The film tries hard to show the vibrant connection between Frida's art and Frida's life, but these moments give way in favor of a more standard, Hollywood-ized feel, especially toward the end of the film.  Also, Frida's politics are ignored, in favor of her love/hate story with Diego.  She was a much richer character, with a much more fascinating life, than this film can encompass.

Julie Taymor does bring some of the flavor of Frida's life to the screen.  The film is enjoyable.  However, anyone with a serious interest in Frida Kahlo should read her biography or study her work.  Don't depend on this film for more than a glance at this artist's painful, yet wonderfully creative life.",1132531200,5,1277,4.888372093023256

I had even written a 30 page paper about the life of Frida for a college course. Therefore, I was a bit shocked when I saw that the Frida Hayek portrays in this movie has little to do with the real life Frida. For instance, Salma is far too beautiful in the film. It is not that Frida was ugly, but she did not look so stunning, neither. Second, Kahlo had such a crippled body she was in constant pain. It is the representation of her physical and mental pain that makes Kahlo's paintings so powerful, but Hayek totally overlooks this, and instead portrays the painter as a physically healthy woman, who can even climb pyramids.
These and other inaccuracies made me give the film four stars only. However, everything else in the film is outstanding, especially the acting, sets, and score.
 Most importantly,  Hayek has introduced Kahlo to a wider audience, and in the end this is what matters. In this respect, the film succeeds 100%.",1129939200,5,1034,4.553763440860215

Frida's paintings take time to grow on some people, but when I saw this movie in the theater, from football jock to computer tech to aspiring artist, all came away feeling as though they had really seen something unique and vibrant.

By the time I was 13, there was nothing I wanted more in the world than to be an artist, although I didn't know of any female artists with the impact of a Picasso or a Matisse. Then, at 14, I saw Frida Kahlo's work and something inside of me absolutely danced with joy. She painted her own face! She painted her own birth! She painted her own feet! It was the most fabulous revelation ever to a 14 yr old girl.

I was scared to see this movie, like you are when you love a book and know they may have butchered it to make a film. I didn't want my vision of Kahlo destroyed. I didn't want to see the pretty version of her life. It was as painful as it was passionate. The disappointments and tragedies were as real as the successes.

Something inside of me danced with joy again as I watched this film. It's impossible to completely capture a life in such a short space of time; but, this movie did a wonderful job at capturing the spirit of Kahlo: her life, her art, her love for Diego.

It is a beautiful film. I truly fell in love with it. It reminded me of the passion we are capable of feeling for art, politics, unfaithful lovers...a passion Kahlo kept for most of her life. The bright burning flame. In that way, it is an inspirational look at the life of the artist.

Even if you are not as familiar with Frida, you can still enjoy this film, this story. In terms of a great story, her life was better than fiction.",1124496000,8,1513,4.171232876712328

When Frida was released into theatres I had absolutely no desire to see it. I'm neither a fan of Salma Hayek, biopics in general, and biopics about artists especially. Add to that my zero knowledge about the artist Frida herself and the movies fate was sealed into never being seen by the likes of me. However, my general lack of new movies here in France and being able to borrow it from a friend for free helped me to reconsider watching it. When I realized it was directed by Julie Taymor who also directed a marvelously beautiful version of Titus then I was actually excited by it (almost).

Like Titus, Frida is an amazingly visual movie. Taymor, who is known mainly for her Broadway adaptation of the Lion King, has an artists eye for visual flair. She has found away to take something as static as a painting and made it alive. Throughout the film she recreates several of Frida's works and makes them a part of the action. It's impossible to explain on paper (or cycberspace) but what she creates is something pure magic.

I can't say how accurately Frida is portrayed in this movie. The picture we get is of a rather flawed woman who lived with a great deal of suffering. Her suffering comes in both physical ways (stemming from an accident early in life) and emotionally (from a cheating husband and her own mistakes). Yet it is this suffering that creates such remarkable art. Taymor manages to create an interesting and moving story within her excellent images.

Both Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina pull out excellent performances. I was especially impressed with Molina portraying the very flawed and yet sympathetic Diega. I had pretty much written this actor after playing Doc Oc in the highly overrated Spiderman 2. But here he shows a real sensitivity to his character. Don't be fooled by the billing of this film. The cover of the DVD would have you believe that Ed Norton, Antonio Banderas, Ashley Judd and Geoffrey Rush all star in it. In fact, with the exception of Geoffrey Rush, all of them have more or less cameos in the picture. Rush is in the movie a bit more, but I wouldn't call even that a starring role.

1519944,5,B00005JLPK,"I have seen Frida five times at the cinemas, and got the DVD as a gift. I must say that this is by far the most visually stunning, inspirational, and emotionally impacting film I have ever seen. Before this movie came out, I went the Vancouver Art Gallery to see some of Frida Kahlo's paintings and saw the documentary of her life. I was very fascinated by several of paintings, but I didn't get to see The Two Fridas or the paintinngs with the monkeys. I was moved to tears by the documentary of her life, and I instantly became a fan. I then bought the novel based on her life, and read it before the movie came out. I was dying to see the movie.

This beautiful biopic is directed by the Julie Taymor, whose film Titus was an equally visual feast. It's a dream come true for the Oscar nominated Salma Hayek, who had spent more that seven years trying to get this movie made. It was a good thing that Madonna and Jennifer Lopez didn't get to do it, because they wouldn't be suitable to play Frida. Salma Hayek gave the performance of her career, and she actually hadn't done anything great before this movie, except for In The Times Of The Butterflies, which also costarred Mia Maestro who played her sister in both movies. Even though Salma lost the award to the overrated Nicole Kidman(The Hours), Frida still won two out of the six nominations. The music composed by Elliot Goldenthal trully capture the spirit of Frida and Mexico. Some of the songs are sung by Lila Downs, and Chavela Vargas. Burn It Blue heard at the end of the film is so beatiful. I even bought the soundtrack. Salma Hayek had more than fifty costumes here, designed by Julie Weiss on a shoestring budget. She made Hayek looked stunningly beautiful and striking, especially the photo shoot for the Paris Vogue cover, and the scene when she steps into her painting The Two Fridas.

This movie chronicles the life and times of Frida and Diego Rivera(played by the underrated Alfred Molina), a womanizing fellow artist, mentor, and husband. Frida had endured a great deal of physical, emotional, and spiritual pain, and she survived, because she was strong and self-absorbing, and she transcend her life's most unforgetable moments onto the cavas in the form of surrealism that's autobiographical. From the bus accident that left her crippled for life to her stormy marriage to Rivera, to miscarriage, to international stardom, to heartaches of failed marriage and distant from her parents, to betrayed by her sister....and then there's the self-destructive behaviours(alcohol addiction and promiscuous sex with men and women). Life without Diego was meaningless to her at times. She intensionally had an affair with Leon Trotsky(a Russian Communist in exile played Geoffrey Rush) to provoke or repay Diego for his infidelity. She still loved him even when they were separated for a period of time, leaving her financially and physically devastated, that's when she painted her best work including The Two Fridas, which was one of the high points in the film. The reconcilation and remarriage of Frida and Diego was a heartfelt experience.

The supporting cast are all superb. Alfred Molina was overlooked by the Oscar, he should've been nominated for best supporting actor, even though he doesn't look a whole lot like the actual Diego Rivera. I thought Valeria Golino was very good too. She played Diego's ex-wife, and she stole scene in this movie. Mia Maestro was great as Christina Kahlo, she was seduced by Diego to bed when she posed for his paintings. The affair broke Frida's heart. I also enjoyed Patricia Reyes Spindola's portrayal of Mrs. Kahlo. She was always negative about the choices Frida made in love and career. As for the big-star cameros which including Antonio Banderas(David Siqueiros), Ashley Judd(Tina Modotti), and Salma's ex-boyfriend Edward Norton(Nelson Rockefeller) who co-wrote the screenplay, I loved Judd's performance the most. Her sexy ""lesbian"" dance number with Salma Hayek was quite a treat.

Salma Hayek gave a mesmerizing and multi-layered performance, and she was in every scene. She trully transformed herself in all aspects of character and showed the world that she's not just a bombshell, but a great actress to be taken seriously. I cried during several scenes including the scene when she got dumped by her first boyfriend(Alejandro/Diego Luna). I was also moved a great deal by the miscarriage, and the scene when she was devastated and started to cut her hair and got very drunk. The most powerful scene was when she was drinking and crying while listening to an old lady(Chavela Vargas) sang a ballad to her, and she went home and stepped into her painting(The Two Fridas).The music, cinematography, acting, art direction, editing, and direction all worked together to achieve a very memorable experience. The special features has some very good materials included, and I really enjoyed the interviews on Julie Taymor, Salma Hayek, and the singers and composers.

I loved this movie and worship Frida. I admired her life's work as an artist, and her endurance of pain and struggles, and ultimately her relentless passion for love and creativity. I also collected the soundtrack, the Frida screenplay with photos of many of the scenes from the film, the postcard book, and a wall fabric drape painted with Frida and the Monkeys.

The performances here are all good, bringing the characters to life vividly. Most vivid of all, however, are the exceptional performances of Hayek as Frida Kahlo and the underrated Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera. Hayek's Frida embodies all the traits that must have made Frida a force of nature... strong, the iron will to live and conquer while still extremely fragile and vulnerable. Frida was a woman of contradictions, as any even cursory look at her body of work will evidence, and Hayek illustrates these contradictions beautifully.

Interestingly, before this film's theatrical release, I read a review in Playboy magazine, which seriously credited ED NORTON as playing Diego Rivera! Oh yes, despite Edward Norton's versatile gifts as an actor, there is NO WAY he was playing the rotund, Mexican painter. (At the time I was quite appalled that a well-respected, big budget magazine like Playboy could print something so egregiously wrong. Where are the copy editors???) Alfred Molina breathes Diego Rivera, artist at work, loving but voracious husband incapable of fidelity. (Frida never demanded fidelity since it was a standard to which she herself wasn't capable; when Diego's womanizing crossed into family territory-he seduced Frida's sister Cristina-Frida decided enough was enough.)

The cast is superb (I love Geoffrey Rush as Leon Trotsky), the script (helped along considerably by Edward Norton) excellent, the scenery and cinematography and soundtrack all gorgeous, producing the inevitable effect of tempting the viewer into visiting Mexico City for him or herself. Going to Coyoacan to see Frida's home and works is worth the trip all by itself, but the whole Coyoacan neighborhood is bohemian, artistic and enjoyable, just like this beautiful and moving tribute to a woman and force of nature, Frida Kahlo.",1110585600,4,2024,5.2631578947368425

I was very surprised to find much of what the movie showed you actually happened to her. It is a very artistically visual film that shows you the best and worst sides of the characters, which often in movies you see too much of the glamorized versions of people. I really wasn't thrilled when my wife wanted me to see this film, but I'm really glad we rented it because I ended up buying it, it is a film worth owning just so you can learn about the artist and hopefully it will make you go buy some of her books so you can learn even more about this amazing artist.",1108512000,5,701,4.086956521739131
1519978,5,B00005JLPK,"I really loved this film, I admit I'm biased, I have found Frida Khalo captivating, mysterious and interesting for years.

 What I liked most was it's bravery in the tale telling and the avoidance of the usaul ""Frida"" cliches. Too often Khalo is dismissed as strange and kranky both in her relationships and her art. For me it has never been enough that the art world simply labels her as a ""surrealist"". Here Hayek plays Khalo as the passionate, caring, pained genius she was. The film endevours to display her agonies through accidents, infidelities, dissapointments and differences. She plays the head strong feminist and communist, a woman passionate about her nation and it's values, traditions and beliefs, a woman agonising to love her family while plow her own trough. A woman uniquely skilled in her creativity and brave enough to tell of her pain and development on canvas. Hayek is a brilliant leading lady and completely dominates the film with Frida's passion and personality, there are other strong roles, Molina and Rush are superb but they never detract from Hayek. The cinematography is delicious and the music is both appropriate and engaging. It's a shame this film didn't get a better run and better audiences. It's a joy to see Hayek get the chance to command a film and see her do it so well, in Hollywood she is too often the token latin girl.

 The film is a real tribute to an inspirational and hugely misunderstood woman.",1107820800,4,1447,4.82258064516129
1519979,5,B00005JLPK,"Salma Hyak looks amazingly like the actual Frida Kahlo in this wonderful testiment to one of the most misunderstood and fascinating personalities of the 20th century!  Frida was the victim of a bus accident that nearly crippled her and left her in agony throughout her life.  As a result, Frida saw the dark side of life and painted some of the most amazing abstract works of art that I have ever seen.

Frida formed a bond with the famous political painter, Diego Rivera.  The two share a stormy relationship and eventually marry.  Frida overlooks most of Diego's extramarital affairs until Diego goes after Frida's sister.  Thus, she feels betrayed and leaves him.

Frida herself is a kinky persona sharing relationships with both men and women.  There is a very erotic scene of Frida dancing tango with another woman.

Frida eventually meets Leon Trotsky and the two united by their socialist political views end up having an affair.  When Trotsky is murdered, Frida and Rivera are suspected but are later exonerated.

In a touching scene in the movie, an incredibly ill Frida is brought in her bed to attend her own art exhibit at which her talent is expounded to a crowd by Rivera.

I thought that this was going to be an interesting biopic judging from the reviews at the time it originally came out. Having seen the dvd however (and forcing myself to watch it to conclusion), I can tell you I hardly know anything about this woman's art - ostensibly the reason why the film was made to begin with. I hate that the audience is manipulated to feel that Frida, was a woman of passion! Who felt things deeply! Don't YOU feel it, viewer? Oh, the drama! Oh, I beat my breast as a sign of solidarity!! Of feeling!! Ohh ohhh ohh!!! Oh, Frida! You were such a passionate artist!! Ohhh!!! Your life was a celebration!! Oh!!! Your pain!! Your life!!!! WHAT RUBBISH! And I did NOT buy AT ALL, her attraction to Alfred Molina's character. What? Were all the men in her town GAY? Was he really the best catch around? I think this entire film is a complete waste. One or two of the songs stick in the mind, but this production is a joke. I didn't buy into it on any level. Salma Hayek tried TOO HARD with this film. She owes everyone who paid to see this in a theatre or on dvd a refund.",1105660800,7,1199,4.217391304347826
1519981,2,B00005JLPK,"After hearing about all the grandeur that this film would convey, I was looking forward to seeing the attempt to put the life of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo onto the screen but I also came in with healthy skepticism. This was a big disappointment, not only is there nothing important stated in the film, but the acting is absolutely horrible.

It was an understatement to say that this was pure ""torture"" to people who want to be intellectually stimulated or at least watch a decent film about someone's life without resorting to that fact that the director wanted us to see Frida as nothing but a ""hero and martyr"" and a one dimensional character, which is what is conveyed throughout this awful film. Julie Taymor (a pretentious playwright and puppet maker w/ one film to her credit) instead gives us a Hollywood cliche about the artist's life, including meaningless pseudo-surrealist interjections which bring to life some of the paintings in a boring fashion.

Hayek is tepid, stale and dull and never really brings any vividness or passion into one of the most vibrant artists of the century, instead, we get to see her breasts about 20% of the time, not that I am against that, but a film should be about something more important that conventional sex scenes which have no point being on the screen and give us feelings into the art and life and relationship with Rivera (played by the dismal Alfred Molina).

Taymor is unsure whether she wants to actually let us examine Kahlo's life or merely show us a predictable storyline that doesn't fit anywhere, she meanders through the most ""famous"" episodes in Frida's life, including her horrific accident and sprinkles a few twists and interpretations. She has a turbulent relationship with Rivera but again, no souls are studied. Trotsky (played by the laughable Geoffrey Rush with a bad Russian accent) has no meaning at all, instead he is nothing but a sex toy which was disgusting to behold on the screen. We feel as if we are watching a bunch of idiots on the screen because not one of the actors hired for this film show any enthusiasm or any acting capabilities, although Antonio Banderas as the artist Siqueiros is the closest thing but he is given only about 2 minutes to work.

Painting was an important part of Frida's life but we don't really get to even see her at work here. If you are looking for a literary study of the artist, this is most definately not the place to look. This is a tragic disgrace to the artist, and merely a conventional approach that gives rich Americans, who compromise 97% of the film audience, a chance to say that they know Frida after watching this. After all, it was the American upper middle class that co-opted Frida's works and life and called it their own, to put on t-shirts and mugs. What is sad, as I saw while reading the other reviews of this film, is that people won't know that nothing was actually stated in the film because they are accustomed to mindless Hollywood garbage which just wants to take famous names and make more money so we have people calling this ""brilliant and wonderful"". I think a Mexican director with decent actors who know their craft is what is necessary if you really want to make a respectable and credible. This film was not even worth making it is so bad.",1101859200,9,3295,4.6563573883161515
1519982,5,B00005JLPK,"Frida is one of the best films about someone's life I've seen in a long time. Usually such films tend to be self involved or leave out important details. With Frida there is a good mix of everything.

The visuals of the film are striking and in some places unique in the way it shows Frida's paintings almost coming to life. Her relationship with Muralist Diego Rivera is shown exactly how it was: harsh, violent but passionate. In the end, despite the infidelity of both husband and wife numerous times, their enduring love and respect for each other as artists and comrades out lasted any lingering problems they had.

Alfred Molina and Selma Hayek give truely great performances and fit their characters personalities well. I hadn't been a huge fan of Selma before this film but even though I'm still not, her acting here has proven me that when given the right material, she can be just as good an actress as the best of them.

The music present in the film is gripping and soaring. The voice of singer Lila Downs cutting through triumphantly. The traditional Mexican music is well done and a joy to listen to. In the end I highly recommend this film on all fronts: acting, music, direction, plot and cinematography.",1101772800,5,1220,4.665116279069768
1519983,5,B00005JLPK,"Artist Frida Kahlo's paintings are a visual diary of her life--as a revolutionary, as the wife of Diego Rivera, and as a woman in constant pain.  Injured in a bus accident as a young woman, she endured over thirty surgeries, unremitting physical agony, and injuries which left her unable to bear a child, but she also endured the pain of a notoriously unfaithful husband.  As she once told him, ""There were two big accidents in my life.  You are the worst.""

Salma Hayek, as Frida, is both tough and vulnerable, showing Frida's spontaneous, physical approach to life and her passionate dedication--to Diego, to her hard-edged paintings, and to communist philosophy.  Alfred Molina, as Diego, a man who ""belongs only to himself,"" is warm, funny, often protective, and utterly impossible as a husband.  An established muralist with many commissions when he first meets her, he encourages her artistic goals, explaining, ""I paint what I see--the world outside.  You paint from your heart.""  Married, divorced, and later remarried, Frida and Diego, as we see them here, are both mutually supportive and mutually destructive.

Hayden Herrera's biography of Frida is the basis for the Clancy Sigal and Diane Lake screenplay, which emphasizes Frida's pain and her ways of dealing with it--through drink, her work, and through sex, with both women and men, including Leon Trotsky, in exile in Mexico.  The settings from the 1920s and 1930s are brilliantly colorful--a bright blue house with a garden of peacocks, monkeys, and colored birds;  the worksites of Rivera's passionate and brightly colored murals;  and locations in Mexico City and New York.  Lively Mexican music plays throughout, with new music (Elliot Goldenthall) inserted to unify scenes, the piano music being especially memorable.  The cinematography (Roderigo Prieto) takes full advantage of the architecture and the color, which is enhanced by the vibrant clothing, jewelry, and hair adornments worn by Frida.

Director Julie Taymor features many of Frida's paintings, and some of Diego Rivera's murals throughout, using them to connect the artists' inner and outer worlds.  On several occasions, however, there are jarring intrusions of cartoons and nightmares--people walk through a photograph, which shifts to black and white;  King Kong in a film morphs into Diego Rivera;  a trip to New York becomes a walk through travel brochures.  Unfortunately, the style of these vignettes is so unexpected and foreign to the tone of this film that they feel intrusive, even arch.  Hayek and Molina are outstanding in conveying the torment of Frida and Diego Rivera, however, and the film, overall, is a fascinating study of two artists living through the tumult of history and each other.

The performances by all the principals are amazing, but  it's the lush cinematography and production elements that set it all off like the velvet cloth used to make sure a precious gem is framed without any distractions to take the eye away. The extras give each of the collaborators a chance to show off what they are so justly proud of.

Watching the commentary track re the music before I viewed the movie itself was a good choice. It made me more aware of the musical elements-particularly the Spanish language ones.

Elliot Goldenthal's score is phenomenal-capturing the soul of a culture with deep wounds and even deeper joy and vibrance.

Filmed in Mexico, as seems only fitting for such Mexican cultural icons, the movie also ignites a love affair for me with the Mexican culture that I got little peeks at growing up in Az. Time to brush up my Spanish, I think.",1094860800,5,923,4.609756097560975

I found the photography so beautiful and the acting so impressive that language was secondary.  The hot bright colors of Mexico and Frida's reflective art dazzled. Now bioflicks have come a long way.  In Frida we get a look at her sexual preferences rather than her motivation.  Her German-Jew father and Mexican mother in early scenes do not give us Freudian aficionados much to go on.  Salma Hayeck is built like a brick (...) house, so her nude scenes and the nudes of other Latin ladies were thrilling for the guys.  The lady viewers might say they were artistic.  I don't have a beef here.  I'm commenting that this movie is not for children.  Frida is quite active for a woman wracked with pain and when she dances with her girlfriend, I worried she would snap like a twig.  I suppose Hollywood thinks that too much sex and too much drugs or drink, make for a wonderful life.  Unfortunately I read misery rather than debauchery.

1519986,5,B00005JLPK,"I saw a Biography segment on A&E Channel on Salma Hayek of whom I was vaguely aware. She was shopping  her biographical Frida Kahlo idea around Hollywood. Thank God she did not allow them overlay what I call the Hollywood Formula onto her idea. She finally got Julie Taymor (Lion King stage play) to direct it, and what direction it was! The colors! The moods, everything was so Mexican! Taymor?s experience with puppetry was put to dazzling use in the entire film. I was blown away by her dream-like, or (should I say) nightmare-like sequence of doctors and spines, revealing the poignancy of Frida?s physical pain and hospital stays. It was comic and horrific, harking back to Day-of-the-Dead comi-tragic imagery.

Kayak?s courage in attempting some daring scenes and appropriate nudity caused me to admire this beautiful model. There is an erotic spirituality about this film. It is very woman-like, also with remnants of what among poets and fiction writers used to be called Magical Realism, peculiar to Latino writers of this century.

I enjoyed Frida?s manly qualities and wondered if they really belonged to her or merely of Salma?s interpretation of her. When Frida dances with Ashley Judd, I felt the sexual tension coming from Salma but not from Judd. In an interview, Judd said that scene made her uncomfortable. That moment was lacking for me, possibly because I have seen real tango dancers in Argentina with the sensually arrogant machismo both the male and female dancers exude.

Getting inside the head of a surrealist painter and telling her life in two hours with only celluloid and a soundtrack seems like an impossible task. But you wouldn't know it to experience this hauntingly beautiful symphony of sights and sounds which is in itself a work of art. I disagree with most of the criticisms on this thread. The beginning is not boring; I was convinced I had to own this DVD within the first twenty minutes. The writing is brilliant and moving. Most biopics fall into the trap of being a mere chronology of events. This one succeeds where most fail: it is a story. The characters are all rich, deep, real, and thereby completely loveable. Of course it is probably scientifically impossible to not find Salma Hayek loveable. In this film, though, everyone shines. Trotsky, Diego's ex-wife, even the bar musicians radiate with human beauty. Salma Hayek has shown the world that she is quite capable of taking the lead in a serious role.

The same could be said about other characters judging from photos (besides Diego Rivera).

1520030,4,B00005JLPK,"Julie Taymor's portrayal of the life of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo breaks away from conventional biopics and occasionally enters what seems to be the inside of the artist's surreal mind. Still, the film doesn't seem much different from most biopics.
Salma Hayek is fine as the famed painter, but she fails to play such a complex character on more than one level. However, she does capture Kahlo's beauty, and does well when her character is acting passionately. Alfred Molina is also adequate as the repeatedly unfaithful husband - you almost believe him when he says that ""[sex] doesn't mean anything!"". The film is also peppered with rather small supporting roles, all performed well enough: Ashley Judd as Italian expatriate Tina Modotti, Antonio Banderas as rival Mexican muralist David Alfaro Siqueiros, Geoffrey Rush as the Russian exile Leon Trotsky, Edward Norton as greasy bourgeios American Nelson Rockefeller, and the exceptional Valeria Golino as Lupe Marin, Rivera's ex-wife.
Elliot Goldenthal's intriguing musical score plays over the absolutely gorgeous Art Direction and Set Direction by Bernardo Trujillo and Hannia Robledo, respectively. The film is a visual and audial cinematic triumph.
However, Taymor's direction straddles between avant-garde moviemaking and conventional melodrama. The screenplay, by a collaboration of writers, fails really to delve into the characters' inner-feelings, especially of the title character, despite the frequent, lively trips inside her mind. In short, we see in this film all that happened to Frida Kahlo in her life, and it's beautiful along the way, but most of us are still left knowing little about her true character other than her conventional descriptions as communist, lover, and painter.",1086566400,2,1753,5.496296296296296

1520032,4,B00005JLPK,"First things first: This is about Frida the woman, not about her art. Almost none of Kahlo's imagery appear in this movie, except incidentally. That suited me just fine - although I wanted to know more about her artwork, a video isn't necessarily the best way to present static images.
Knowing nothing about her life, everything was a surprise - surprises that I'll mostly leave for you to discover on your own. Kahlo's determination was not a surpise, though. After the accident that shaped the rest of her life, that was the driving force that pulled the rest of the movie forward. It got her up and moving, in the most literal way. It was the only source of her skill as a artist - if she had any formal training, the movie glossed over it. It got Diego Rivera's attention (after an unfortunate, prior introduction). It even kept Rivera's attention, as much as it could be kept.
A few surreal interludes punctuated the movie. A hospital scene, in particular, had an eerie, macabre look. That certainly captured the pained, drug-addled semiconsciousness that must have come and gone during recovery. It also involved imagery that was distinctly Mexican, suggesting the 'Day of the Dead' icons.
Only a few points rang false in this movie. First, the body cast was too all-enveloping. Attending to sanitary needs would not have been possible for someone wrapped up that completely. Second, Kahlo's gait was remarkably strong and straight after the movie's first few scenes. I would have thought that Kahlo's defining accident would surely leave more than superficial scars.
On the whole, this was a very enjoyable view of Kahlo as an artist, but mostly as a political activist. Looking just at her paintings, it's hard to remember just how many chances she took with her political involvements.  I suppose, though, that anyone so close to Rivera was already accustomed to a little danger and unpredictability.
Hayek presented Kahlo as a physcially diminutive woman. I would like to believe that was an accurate portrayal. It just means that all of Kahlo's strength and energy was wound up even tighter, to fit in such a small package. On the whole, it was a very strong portrayal of a very strong woman.

1520033,5,B00005JLPK,"I have read two biographies of Frida and studied her paintings closely, and totally disagree with a certain Washington Post reviewer who wrote that the film failed to capture the delicate texture of Frida's life.  To the contrary, the film was teeming with wonderful visual references to Frida's multifaceted and colorful life, from the family members, pets and belongings she held dear, to the unique clothing and jewelry for which she was known, and the neighborhoods and houses where she lived.  Perhaps the Post reviewer was not sufficiently familiar with the context to appreciate these details, which were recreated with such passion and fidelity that for me the film needed little else.  I also felt the film effectively portrayed the torment Frida suffered over her lifelong love for Diego Rivera, (...), yet emotionally and professionally supportive, husband.  That Diego's art overshadowed hers for most of their lives was of far less consequence to her than his marital infidelities.  I personally would have enjoyed seeing the film do more with Frida's series of magical, and often tragic, self-portraits; this is a woman who suffered such crushing chronic back pain (due to a horrific bus accident) that she often painted while bedridden in the hospital for months on end, and at other times had to tie herself into a chair to paint.  Painting was her therapy and she literally painted her love and her pain in images of herself, Diego, her broken body parts, and the plants, objects and creatures that brought her comfort.  But I happily forgave those shortcomings for the pleasure of seeing this spectacular artist and human being  brought to life in Ms. Hayek's vivid production.",1083974400,3,1695,5.093862815884476
1520034,5,B00005JLPK,"The film Frida and the accompanying background material here is a visual entertainment that seems to be oriented to the current fascination with her art as an expression of inwardly turned, self-referential, and pyscholoigcal concerns. The acting, direction, and production design here are all masterful.
Yet, there seems to be a simplification to enable glorification.  Frida emerges as a saint, a heroine, but not a real person.  In fact, she seems unrecognizable compared with the versions of her life that were told and people who knew her before she became worthy of the same treatment as The Lion King. While lip service is paid to her disability and pain, one never sees the real pyschological expression of that pain that everyone who knew her talks about marking her personality. But then, this film seems to be faithful to current hipster's glib
reducation of Freida Kalho to a highly ""collectable"" stereotype.
People I knew who knew her 1938-1942 and the biographies that were written about her before she began to be taken up by the New York hipsters, tended to talk about how the pain and difficulty of her life were expressed in a personality that was not exactly the sweet, sunny, firm clear, fair and always just character portrayed in the movie. The condition created by the Frida Fad of the past 10 years has made her into such a non-person, such a glorified abstraction, that otherwise serious grownups who have no real knowledge other than she is now popular and ""collectable"" wince when you tell them people world wide for their warmth, judgement, and trust who saw her every day for years could say that Frida was not always fun to be around. No less than the Diego depicted in her film, Kahlo did not really understand the consequences her own personal picadillos and adventures could have on people who had more conventional views of life and love, and who needed stability in life.
The movie is either false or ignorant about why Trotsky moved out of the Blue House.  He did not move out because of Natalia Sedova's anger over the affair. [ The affair really break Natalia's heart and almost caused a split among the Trotskys, although that split was healed. Trotsky is almost rapsodic in his diary when he realizes his love for Natalya is there emotionally and physically and they are still together.] Trotsky and the Riveras split due to a deep and public political disagreement over elections in Mexico. Diego was making public statements that gave people the impression that Trotsky was backing a right-wing candidate for President of Mexico that Trotsky stridently opposed. Moroever, Diego's actions gave the false impression that Trotsky was publically intervening in Mexican politics, something Trotsky resolutely refused to do.  Both Trotsky and the Mexican section of the Fourth International, the world organization Trotsky founded, had to disassociate themselves from Deigo at this point.
This movie uses Kahlo's association with Trotsky to give a gloss to her and Rivera. Unlike the Mexican movie made about her entitled Freida (this is the name Kahlo was born with, not Frida), this film does not tell the view that in the late 1940s, Rivera and Kahlo became ultra-Stalinists.  They revived their friendship with David Alfred Siqueros who had attempted to murder Trotsky.  Frida Kahlo issued public statements denouncing herself for having had sex with Trotsky and pledged her eternal devotion to Stalin. Of course, this aspect of her life doesn't fit into the kind of marketable hagiagraphy that has less concern with the reality of a person and of politics than it does with a marketable image. It is true you do see a picture of Stalin on a canvas toward the end, but it is not clear to anyone who isn't already familiar with the story.
I also was disappointed in the actor they had playing Diego. He played his part extremely well, but he was just not the right person for anyone to think to be Diego. The person was an English actor, apparently of Italian or Spanish origin.
Diego was mostly if not entirely Indian, whereas Frida was actually half German Jewish.  Diego actually did the rough outlines and instructions of his murals and then got very indigenous Indians to paint in the colors with their rough brush strokes.
This attempt to identify with the non-European art and culture and political identity of Mexico was a big part of what Diego and Frida were about, but it gets no play or reference in the movie. Frida adopted the regional dress of one of the most indigenous areas of Mexico,rather than follow the Europe-centered fashions of Mexico's intelligensia. Mexico is a nation where the the vast majority, the scores of millions of people of mixed and all Indian blood have traditionally struggled against an elite which emphasizes its ""Spanish"" ancestry.  Diego's proclamation of his Indianness and his sucess in Mexico as a mostly Indian cultural figure, and Frida's decision to identify with this was central to their lives and impact on their times.
To me what is rather unfortunate is that while Kahlo's art was interesting and beautiful, and great in some ways, Diego is simply lost in all of this. He was one of the great artists of the 20th Century, far more significant than Kahlo in his impact on Mexican, Latin American, and world culture. Moreover, particularly for Mexicans and other Latin Americans, the cultural ideas about reclaiming the Indian identity and linking with the popular masses and the pre-Columbian cultures that he advanced were very important, not just for artists, but in political and literary circles as well. Diego played an important role fighting with his friend Andre Breton in charting an independent and radical artistic and intellectual response to Stalinist theory of ""socialist realist"" art.  Pathfinder Press has just come out with a brand new updated and better noted and glosseried edition of Breton's What is Surrealism which contains the declaration on Art and Artists in the 20th Century that Deigo, Trotsky, and Breton wrote together.
Of course, all of Deigo's work dealt with the political struggle of Mexico and the world's working people to fight against imperialism and capitalism. This isn't very marketable among the upper middle class fadists at whom this film seems to aimed. They prefer a Frida and a Diego whose personal concerns about romance, sex, and personal fame are at the center of their lives, not two fighters for a socialist world!",1082332800,9,6459,4.967622571692877

The casting, cinema-photography, art direction, script, musical score and performances are all stunning. Hayek is clearly much more than a beautiful and talented actress.

I am also a painter, and have always been particularly touched by Frida Kahlo's ability to channel years of physical and emotional suffering into a body of lyrical and stunning work. Hayek's performance captures the complex nature of Kahlo's personality. Alfred Molina is wonderful as Diego Rivera. So often Rivera has been depicted as a one dimensional bad guy, but Molina's performance reflects a more nuanced understanding of this brilliant artist. He may have been a singularly flawed individual; but his reputation as one of the world's greatest muralists in unassailable.

1520069,4,B00005JLPK,"Mmmmm, how to review this film.
I watched this film with a friend who knew nothing of Frida, and he thought the film to be stunning and interesting.  I know a bit more about Frida than he, and whilst I found the film to be beautifully shot, very stylish and well acted, it was a very basic introduction into a very complex character, who lived her life in incredible pain (not really shown here) and whose relationship was continuously tested by many, many infidelities by both parties.  Also not dealt with, were her attempted suicides, which I think may perhaps have portrayed her as a weak person if they were simply glossed over, which she wasn't.
Definitely a beautiful and impressive film, and one I would recommend.  Frida was an incredible woman, and if the film inspires you to learn more about her, then read the biography on which this film was based by Hayden Herrera (also sold on amazon).",1079308800,,902,4.625
1520070,5,B00005JLPK,"There isn't a slow moment in this film, or a bad moment for that matter.  The cast, camera, and script are just superb throughout.  Every frame has the brilliant color and composition of a painting.
Of course the real Frida was not nearly as gorgeous and appealing as Salma Hayek makes her out to be, but the spirit of the artist is faithfully rendered: this was one beautifully ballsy woman who lived life by her own rules and heart, who gave all the oppressive and conformist social/gender conventions of her society a big bold middle finger, who lived as she painted: passionately, torturously, and triumphantly.  (The last adjective is a historical embellishment, however---the real Frida did not die a happy person.)
All in all it's a brilliant and fascinating film, worth repeated viewings, every scene and character perfectly fleshed out.  Not your typical artist-bio film like ""La Belle Noiseux"" but more like the equally gorgeous ""Basquiat""---it's a celebration of a life lived as art, and the art in life.",1078012800,5,1015,4.988165680473373
1520071,5,B00005JLPK,"The film Frida and the accompanying background material here is a visual entertainment that seems to be oriented with the current fascination with her art as an expression of inwardly turned, self-referential, and pyscholoigcal concerns that seem to pass as social concern these days. The acting, direction, and production design here are all masterful. Yet, there seems to be a simplification to enable glorification.  Frida emerges as a saint, a heroine, but not a real person.
People I knew who knew her 1938-1942 and the biographies that were written about her before she began to be taken up by the New York hipsters, tended to talk about how the pain and difficulty of her life were expressed in a personality that was not exactly the sweet, sunny, firm clear, fair and always just character portrayed in the movie. The condition created by the Frida Fad of the past 10 years has made her into such a non-person, such a glorified abstraction, that otherwise serious grownups who have no real knowledge other than she is now popular and ""collectable"" wince when you tell them people world wide for their warmth, judgement, and trust who saw her every day for years could say that Frida was not always fun to be around. No less than the Diego depicted in her film, Kahlo did not really understand the consequences her own personal picadillos and adventures could have on people who had more conventional views of life and love, and who needed stability in life.
The movie and the accompanying DVD background material were either false or ignorant about why Trotsky moved out of the Blue House.  He did not move out because of Natalia Sedova's anger over the affair. [ The affair really break Natalia's heart and almost caused a split among the Trotskys, although that split was healed. Trotsky is almost rapsodic in his diary when he realizes his love for Natalya is there emotionally and physically and they are still together.] Trotsky and the Riveras split due to a deep and public political disagreement over elections in Mexico. Diego was making public statements that gave people the impression that Trotsky was backing a right-wing candidate for President of Mexico that Trotsky stridently opposed. Moroever, Diego's actions gave the false impression that Trotsky was publically intervening in Mexican politics, something Trotsky resolutely refused to do.  Both Trotsky and the Mexican section of the Fourth International, the world organization Trotsky founded, had to disassociate themselves from Deigo at this point.
This movie uses Kahlo's association with Trotsky to give a gloss to her and Rivera. Unlike the Mexican movie made about her entitled Freida (this is the name Kahlo was born with, not Frida), this film does not tell the view that in the late 1940s, Rivera and Kahlo became ultra-Stalinists.  They revived their friendship with David Alfred Siqueros who had attempted to murder Trotsky.  Frida Kahlo issued public statements denouncing herself for having had sex with Trotsky and pledged her eternal devotion to Stalin. Of course, this aspect of her life doesn't fit into the kind of marketable hagiagraphy that has less concern with the reality of a person and of politics than it does with a marketable image. It is true you do see a picture of Stalin on a canvas toward the end, but it is not clear to anyone who isn't already familiar with the story.
I also was disappointed in the actor they had playing Diego. He played his part extremely well, but he was just not the right person for anyone to think to be Diego. The person was an English actor, apparently of Italian or Spanish origin.
Diego was mostly if not entirely Indian, whereas Frida was actually half German Jewish.  Diego actually did the rough outlines and instructions of his murals and then got very indigenous Indians to paint in the colors with their rough brush strokes.
This attempt to identify with the non-European art and culture and political identity of Mexico was a big part of what Diego and Frida were about, but it gets no play or reference in the movie. Frida adopted the regional dress of one of the most indigenous areas of Mexico,rather than follow the Europe-centered fashions of Mexico's intelligensia. Mexico is a nation where the the vast majority, the scores of millions of people of mixed and all Indian blood have traditionally struggled against an elite which emphasizes its ""Spanish"" ancestry.  Diego's proclamation of his Indianness and his sucess in Mexico as a mostly Indian cultural figure, and Frida's decision to identify with this was central to their lives and impact on their times.
To me what is rather unfortunate is that while Kahlo's art was interesting and beautiful, and great in some ways, Diego is simply lost in all of this. He was one of the great artists of the 20th Century, far more significant than Kahlo in his impact on Mexican, Latin American, and world culture. Moreover, particularly for Mexicans and other Latin Americans, the cultural ideas about reclaiming the Indian identity and linking with the popular masses and the pre-Columbian cultures that he advanced were very important, not just for artists, but in political and literary circles as well. Diego played an important role fighting with his friend Andre Breton in charting an independent and radical artistic and intellectual response to Stalinist theory of ""socialist realist"" art.  Pathfinder Press has just come out with a brand new updated and better noted and glosseried edition of Breton's What is Surrealism which contains the declaration on Art and Artists in the 20th Century that Deigo, Trotsky, and Breton wrote together.
Of course, all of Deigo's work dealt with the political struggle of Mexico and the world's working people to fight against imperialism and capitalism. This isn't very marketable among the upper middle class fadists at whom this film seems to aimed. They prefer a Frida and a Diego whose personal concerns about romance, sex, and personal fame are at the center of their lives, not two fighters for a socialist world!",1077494400,,6065,4.98025666337611

Not only would it have been great to see an Hispanic actress win, but it would have placed even greater legitimacy to her project!

But Hayek has created a picture of beautiful scenes and imagery which to me transcends all of those supposed faults.  The girl-on-girl dancing scene was electric.  So was Frida's date with a lady at a New York City diner.  Antonio Banderas' appearance was mercifully short.  The ""artful dream"" sequences gave something to the Fellini crowd and the memory of Kahlo as an artist.  And the narrative may have been too conventional for some, but to me it was a welcome relief that paced the film along wonderfully (would you prefer 2 hours of dialogue on the merits of Trotskyism?).  But best of all were the beautiful little indigenous images that only someone with a real knowledge of Mexico could appreciate: the peaceful setting of her parent's home in Coyoac&aacute;n, the hairless Aztec dog (ixcuintle), the food and cooking instruments, the famous Mexican actress who played her mother, the power of the taboo against women in cantinas, etc.  These are vivid symbols of Mexican culture, many of which date back thousands of years.

Salma Hayek did an astounding job of recreating the person and world of Frida Kahlo.  I was so impressed by this film, that I actually took the time to watch the ""making of"" section of the DVD--which I strongly suggest viewing, as well as the film, itself.
I loved this film so much, I also purchased a copy for my ex-wife--as a Birthday present.  This would be a great gift for all Artistic people--especially women--however, it would also be a great gift for people who are Challenged by various handicaps.

1520118,4,B00005JLPK,"I was quite impressed by Salma Hayek's single-minded determination to get this film produced in the face of heavy competition from others. She felt destined to play Frida Kahlo, and the film was a labor of love that is evident in every frame. Kahlo's bold and colorful paintings are heavily autobiographical, and so it is unavoidable that the film takes us on a journey through her life and work all at once. As we see events in Kahlo's turbulent life unfold, we automatically understand the content of the artist's paintings as they are presented to us.
Hayek also found probably the ideal director in Julie Taymor, who has quickly established herself as one of the most visually gifted filmmakers in the industry. Taymor's handling of the actors is first-rate, as she brings spirited performances from the entire cast. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is equally excellent, with lots of dazzling camera tricks and numerous painting-like shots. The film also benefits from terrific lighting effects, makeup, set design, vibrant costumes, and an outstanding, Oscar-winning score.
I was also pleasantly surprised by the film's opening scene, which turns out to be a very clever and unconventional way of introducing Kahlo to the audience ... but you'll just have to see the film to know what that means.
My only criticism with the film, and a minor one, is that the pace is almost breathless, and so the film feels more compact than it really should. It almost always rushes like a river when sometimes it should flow more gently.
This film clearly belongs to Salma Hayek, and she occupies the role so enormously that it's hard to imagine anyone else taking on the character of Frida Kahlo with as much verve. It's nothing short of a career-defining performance, and her Oscar nomination was well earned. My earnest hope is that Hayek will find equal inspiration in the years to come, because the movie industry needs the kind of passion and resolution she brought to this project.",1073433600,3,1979,4.963855421686747
1520119,3,B00005JLPK,"Hats off to Salma Hayek for creating an interesting vehicle for her good talent, an effort that is a visual treat. But that doesn't save the script, unfortunately, from being the linear soapy exposition that it is -- a chronology of events not even woven into a plot. Nor did Frida offer its audience substance beyond the visual presentation.
The protagonist was into the early communist movement, for example, but there is not enough of a hint of why this was so. This also holds for her slightly better known husband, the early 20th Century Mexican painter Diego Rivera.
Scenes open and close like soldiers passing by in a parade. A film worth making should be based on a meaningful and significant scenario. Frida is a laundry list abstract of the little-known painter's life and because it is not well written it will more than likely be quickly forgotten. If the script is not there, the legs will not be there.
That said, there are some marvelous graphic elements in the film that while not seminal delight the eye while a wonderful Hispanic music score and its on-camera performers warm the heart.

She has directed rings around male directors who get Oscar noms for a whole lot less effect! Girls, ya gotta break up the ""good ol' boys (hacks) club"" in Hollywood so that you can start getting some of these well-deserved awards.
Anyway, I was completely swept into the story, not knowing a whole lot about Frida except for the life long consequences of her accident and philandering husband. The screenplay was excellent and didn't leave too many open questions about her life. I only wish there had been more about painting than about her love life, but I think this was so the story would appeal more to the masses.
Salma Hayek did an extremely competent acting job as she always does (as far as acting, looks and class goes, she leaves the ""attention junkie"" J-Lo in the B-movie bin where she belongs!

1520125,4,B00005JLPK,"Frida (Julie Taymor, 2002)
Within the first few seconds of Frida's opening, it's obvious to anyone who's seen Titus that this is a Julie Taymor film. I've never seen that particular shade of blue anywhere but on Tony Hopkins' face.
Frida opens riskily. The first part of the film is, not to put too fine a point on it, boring as all get-out. However, somewhere in the midst of all the boredom, Taymor is seducing the viewer, and by the time you get to the movie's first unforgettably surreal image (after the trolley accident, with Salma Hayek covered in blood and powdered gold), you're hooked for the rest of the movie. And not just because Ms. Hayek spends so much of it unclothed, either (finally fulfilling a collective male fantasy in existence since From Dusk Till Dawn).
Hayek plays Frida Kahlo, husband Diego Rivera is played by Alfred Molina (recently on the big screen in Identity), and the movie centers around the two's volatile marriage. Rivera seems incapable of being faithful, which drives Kahlo's art deeper into the subconscious depths of pain and misery her art achieved. And yet still, somehow, the two of them love one another enough to keep trying to make it work, over and over again. Well, at least it made for great art.
The movie is also powered by a number of fine cameos, from Edward Norton to Antonio Banderas to Geoffrey Rush to Saffron Burrows and a whole lot of places in between. Add the trademark dadaesque scenes one expects from Taymor, and the film ends up being quite fine. Certainly worth a screening. *** ",1071100800,3,1546,4.704797047970479
1520126,4,B00005JLPK,"Salma Hayek goes very quickly from Tarantino eye candy to serious actress/filmmaker with FRIDA.  At first I thought she was too beautiful to play Frida but, with the exception of her nude scene when you see what a gorgeous woman she is, she completely inhabits the pain and despair of her character.
And this film really deepened my appreciation for Alfred Molina.  What a great actor.  He totally brings Diego Rivera to life.
(I remember Molina getting killed by bamboo spikes in the opening of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK--yeah, that was him!  He was also in CHOCOLAT with Johnny Depp, PRICK UP YOUR EYES with Gary Oldman.  I just saw him in LUTHER with Joseph Fiennes and Peter Ustinov.  The guy's great and he's been in more than you think.  Plus, you'll see him as Doctor Octopus in the next SPIDERMAN).
One of the main reasons I saw this film was that it had been directed by Julie Taymor.  If you liked FRIDA, see what she does with Shakespeare's TITUS with Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange.  She has a very unique, vibrant style.
When I first started watching FRIDA, I thought of another film about a woman suffering at the hands of a great artist: SURVIVING PICASSO.  I found that film interesting but ultimately dry.  Picasso came off as such a thoroughly egotistical, selfish man, I found it hard to care about him.

1520177,5,B00005JLPK,"Julie Taymor is in the driver's seat for this wonderful look at the life of Frida Kahlo, one of the greatest artists of the 20th century - but this is a collective effort in the truest sense of the term.  Selma Hayek, who turns in what is very likely the performance of a lifetime as Kahlo, is listed as an executive producer - and the contributions of all involved in this masterful film are important and noteworthy.  The cast and crew have managed to tell the story not only of the romance between Kahlo and the great Mexican muralist Diego Rivera, but also of a time and atmosphere that we will - sadly - unlikely see again.
The Revolution in Russia - and the possibilities it presented for the working classes worldwide - lit a fire in the hearts of many, igniting hopes and passions for a better world.  Each person touched by this flame saw it illuminate their life and their work in an individual way - and artists were certainly no exception.  Diego Rivera's murals are legendary and timeless testaments to that passion.  The passion that stirred between Rivera and Kahlo is a legend of its own - Frida knew full well before she even met Diego of his reputation as a womanizer.  The love the blossomed between them drew them together despite - and very likely because of - the things that existed within each of them that, in many relationships, drive people apart.
Taymor's film uses incredibly beautiful - and moving - images to augment the live action.  Many of these are taken from Kahlo's works - there are a couple of scenes in which one of Frida's paintings is transformed into live action, to wonderful effect - and some are completely original, created especially for the film.  A couple of these latter scenes are based on traditional images from the Mexican Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead), and are chillingly effective - and not without humor.
The horrific accident which left Kahlo's body damaged for life certainly didn't kill her spirit - and it is this spirit, combined with the innate talent she possessed for turning her inner feelings into art, that make her work eternally relevant and inspiring.  We all carry around pain inside of us that accumulates over the course of our lifetimes - Frida found a way to access that pain, to make it visible to others, to express it and process it.  We could all learn a lot from her.  Kahlo and her work should be more widely known - something that has begun to be corrected in the last couple of decades - and held up as a role model, not just for women and Hispanics, but also for human beings in general.
The DVD is loaded with extras (you can check out the list above) that make the viewing experience even richer - unlike some releases, where the viewer is left with the feeling of sorting through filler.  The film itself is worth the price of the DVD - the extras just sweeten the deal.

The story is well balanced, starting from her teens and then her direct encounter and then her relationship with Rivera till her death.  We see much of Rivera, so much so that an alternative title to this film might as well read "" Diego Rivera""! This is not altogether an adverse comment, for Rivera's part was so successful. But there is definitely too much of Trotsky. What is the point of all the details of the assisination of Trotsky anyway! A mere digression.
Somehow, one's aware that these events aren't exactly seen through Frida's eyes, nothing like her inner voice nor the stream of her own consciousness or anything of that sort.  One would rather see more of Frida's paintings and how she actually painted, or else her ideas of painting. The actual physcial pain that poisoned her happiness, or the pain so strikingly reflected in her paintings aren't sufficiently conveyed to the viewers. I'm afraid serious and curious viewers alike have to look else where for these things.

1520180,4,B00005JLPK,"I was not familiar with the story of Frida Kahlo and did not know anything about her or her husband Diego Rivera. After watching this colorful, passionate movie, I am sure I will not forget their story.
My first impression from the movie is colors - Frida's face, her red lipstick, her hair with the cloth woven through her braids, the strong colors of her dresses, the flowers she likes and off course the colors Frida uses in her paintings.
The colors are the rich strong colors of the Mexican culture, the houses, the greenery, and the women dresses.
My second impression is the expressiveness and beauty of Selma Hayak. This actress, whom I never appreciated before, does the role of her life in this movie.  Some reviewers have commented that maybe Selma Hayak is too pretty for this role and their is a lot of truth in this comment but although Selma Hayak is no doubt beautiful she is still able to portray Frida as a very strong natured person with a unique personality, which is, so I feel, the essence and purpose of this movie.
I can appreciate what the critical reviewers wrote about some shallowness and the fact that the story is presented in a Hollywood manner. However, I think that all this is acceptable in order to bring us the interesting story of Frida which did come across. We see her background, and are given means to understand the pain and feelings that are shown in her paintings. I felt that some of the stories in the movie were not totally clear to me - as a viewer I did not feel I totally understood the reasons for Rivera and thus Frida's attraction to the Marxist movement. Another unclear example would be Frida's tolerance to the fact her husbands ex wife and kids live above them. However, even these misunderstandings helps to create her image as an ""artist"" in my eyes.

The colours. The divine accents. The music. And Salma Hayek.
I can't say I liked this actress before - I had no idea she would be able to portay Frida so deeply and passionately. No doubt, she must pale in comparison with the great artist herself, but she was still strong, vibrant and expressive.
I was very surprised to hear that people think this movie is sexually explicit or anything of the kind. Actually, it puts no stress at all on sex. It is for sure much less indecent than any Hollywood movie made in the last few decades, perhaps save those made especially for children. The movie is erotic, though - indeed, Frida's dance with another woman is just beautiful to watch - it's fascinating and exquisite.
And I must once again stress how much I loved the Spanish accent that rang throughout the movie, as well as the intense music. The music... it was just irresistible.
Frida was a woman who I doubt can be understood by simply watching a movie. Even if it's a great movie.

I first saw the european release complete with saucy love scene between Frida and her female lover. Later I saw the American DVD and that scene was ommitted.
The dance scene between Ashley Judd and Selma is the hook to keep the audience glued for the rest of the film which is full of color and imagery of Mexico from the inside out.
How Frida was able to love such an unfaithful man for 30 yrs is beyond me.
As a woman I think the thing that I related to most in seeing Frida's story was her battle with her crippling injuries after the bus accident. She was young and vibrant then a changed woman after the wreck, learning to cope with it for the rest of her life. This I can relate to, especially as an artist and the impact such things can have on your work.

1520184,4,B00005JLPK,"First of all, I was very skeptical about how this film would turn out. In high school Spanish and Art classes, I learned a bit about Frida Kahlo, so I knew a litle bit of what she was like. However, this film has been one of the most interesting, somewhat controversial ones I have seen. Nominated for six Academy Awards, FRIDA is the biography of the famous Mexican painter, Frida Kahlo.
Salma Hayek was exceptionally amazing in her Oscar-nominated title role! I haven't seen a whole lot of her work, but she truly nailed this performance down hard. Alfred Molina gave an awesome performance as Diego Rivera! (NOTE: If you think Alfred is great in this film, he is just as good in films like NOT WITHOUT MY DAUGHTER.) I give kudos to the awesome acting in this film!! The other things I loved about the film are the cinematography, the music, effects, and the art! The filmmakers have had recreated Frida's world as if it is happening now. It has given audiences a chance to really experience the magic of these things. Frida had a passion of all aspects of life, and the cast and crew were able to make it possible to show that same passion, especially in her paintings. The history and politics also brought in an interest for me, for it showed how the characters were able to share their ideas, cultures, etc.
Frida lived in pain, emotionally and physically, dealt with intense infidelity caused by Diego, her husband, and had some scandelous affairs of her own. The reason for the four stars is this: TOO MUCH sexual content. Yes, Diego and Frida had endured a tumultuous marriage. Yes, Diego was extremely unfaithful to her, but they stuck together until her death. However, in my opinion, Hollywood really didn't have to get into very explicit details with the sex affairs, language, and nudity.
But, despite all that, FRIDA is a film that really showed who she was, and what she did. She was a perseverent cripple; she was a revolutionary at heart; she is still considered one of the greatest artists ever known in the world. But most importantly, she was a very unique woman. If you like biopics, this is one you should at least rent. The special features are just as wonderful. If you fall in love with it, it will be a great addition to your DVD collection!",1061078400,,2268,4.602469135802469
1520185,5,B00005JLPK,"""Frida"" possesses that mythical essence which the Spanish call duende: magic spirit or inspiration. The entire film--performances, music, visuals, explodes with passion and colour. We see Frida from her beginnings as an impetuous schoolgirl and her first introduction to future husband Diego Rivera, to her death at age forty-seven. In between we are priviledged to Frida's unique perspectives of life, love and art, everything drenched in vivid colours, ripe with possibility, a tango of pain and passion.
The cast includes many high-profile names, such as Salma Hayek, Alfred Molina, Geoffry Rush, Ashley Judd, Antonio Banderas, and Edward Norton. I am amazed at how well Julie Taymor (the Lion King Broadway musical) has captured the feel of Mexico during the early-to-mid 20th century:  the revolutionary atmosphere, inequalities, the textures and smells of everyday life.
The most impressive part of the film for me was the music and visuals. The soundtrack includes a liberal dose of traditional Mexican tunes and singers, including Chavela Vargas, a legendary folk singer and one of Frida's real-life lovers. It was incredibly powerful to see the weathered face of Vargas as she serenades Salma's Frida; one can only imagine what memories she was recalling of her time with the real Frida. Mexican folk singer Lila Downs also contributes, as does Caetano Veloso and Hayek herself on ""La Bruja.""
Taymor uses Frida's actual paintings as inspiration for the visuals, at times combining live action with Frida's paintings, photo montages, and puppets to bring to life Frida's creative genius, trying to go behind the paintings into the events that inspired them.
The two-disc DVD comes with several short extras on visual effects, interviews with Chavela Vargas and Lila Downs, Salma's recording session,  Although overly ambitious and sidetracked at times, ""Frida"" manages to paint an unforgettable portrait of a fiery spirit: communist, painter, wife, lover, infused with the soul and passion of Mexico.",1059868800,6,2008,5.412140575079873

Every participant appears to have been drawn irresistibly into Salma Hayek's dream of presenting an impression of Frida Kahlo's life on the screen.
Moreover, this film goes far in capturing on camera the heart & soul of urban Mexican culture and life in the decades following the Mexican Revolution of the early 20th Century. It abounds with music and color and passion.
Let's face it:  99% of what has come out of Hollywood over the past 20 years is crap that depends upon special effects and pyrotechnics to make up for a lack of literacy, labor & talent.

The story of the love between Diego and Frida alone makes this a great movie, along with a glimpse of the political climate of that period. What was great about their love for each other, was that it was based on true camaraderie, fully knowing each others faults beforehand.
After their second marriage, when Frida was bedridden and wanted to go to the opening of her show but was forbidden to get out of bed, the speech Diego was giving about Frida , was a great testimonial to their love....and the manner in which she shows up without disobeying doctors orders is GREAT!

1520236,5,B00005JLPK,"Bravo for this 2002 film that brought the life and times of the artist Frida Kahlo to life!
Starring Salma Hayak in the title role, the audience is treated to a visual feast of her colorful and pain-filled life.  I've always admired Ms. Kahlo's paintings and yet never knew anything about her.  Now, its all here, and Julie Taymor, the director, uses the backdrop of Mexico and the colors of the sun to tell this inspiring story.
Born in 1907, Frida was only fifteen years old in 1922 when she was seriously injured in an accident.  Her back was shattered and a steel rod had pierced her body. For the rest of her life she was never free of pain.  And yet she managed to direct her agony into magnificent works of art.
The acting is outstanding, and Salma Hayak really was able to translate the complexities of role onto the screen.  Alfred Molina was cast as Diego Rivera, a fellow artist who loved her completely but could never stay faithful.  Together, the couple light up the screen with their passion and jealousy, which lasted a lifetime.  Frida had love affairs of her own, with women as well as men, and the romantic scenes keep the screen sizzling.  It's also clear how directly her pain is translated into her art.
Mexico itself was also a star of the film.  It seethes with beauty and political intrigue.  And the sunshine colors are a perfect backdrop for the tempestuous romantic story.  There are also some scenes in Paris and in New York and the director managed to convey a time and a place that once really existed and now is remembered with nostalgia.  The political climate also comes to life, as Frida ad Diego were Marxists and had optimistic visions of changing the world for the better. In retrospect it all seems nave, but the times were alive with the turmoil of preconceived concepts being challenged.
I loved the film, loved the characters and was caught up in the story.  Highly recommended.",1058140800,2,1920,4.6117647058823525

1520239,4,B00005JLPK,"FRIDA (2002) dir. Julie Taymor.
This is essentially an art movie that made it to (some) mainstream theaters and got an Oscar nomination for its star, Selma Hayek. Though Hayek did not win the Oscar (it went to Nicole Kidman for Hours), her rendition of Frida Kahlo character, an early 20th century Mexican painter, was generally worth watching this movie. The kudos, though, go to Taymor, a director of both opera and film, who made this film an outstanding viewing experience-for select audiences.
I have to make a qualification to this praise, however.  Taymor stated in her DVD commentary that she did not want to make a film about art, but about the life of an artist-showing the creation of art in the process. But basically, this was the life of an artist that she was attempting, the inner life principally, which was expressed in the art. Thus art defines life, the individual artist's, but also life in general. It was also a movie about love, about a romance, a marriage, and, broadly again, the relation of marriage (life) to art.
These are large themes, and they are not necessarily the only ones that the film contains, for the film is complex and themes interrelate and cross over to others as the story progresses, covering a period of about 25 years.
What I believe is a flaw is the dramatic structure of the film. As Julie Taymor admits, two hours of film time cannot contain the details of a lifetime. Structurally, the film is episodic, without a discernible plot, other that the ups and down of the relationship of Frida Kahlo with her husband, the painter Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina), their struggles to remain committed to each other, despite his infidelities. The film does well to show the paradox of enduring friendship between two fellow artists of opposite sexes who happen to be married; the marriage fails, the friendship endures; it is not easy, and in the process, the life of Frida, whose physically well-being has been irreparably damaged by an early accident, is practically ruined. Her struggle is to overcome physical tragedy, a failed marriage, and an artistic career that refused to take off while she was alive (she has become famous since).
The film progresses along these lines, and has much to commend it: splendid period photography  (despite a limited budget), a tremendous musical score by Elliot Goldenthal, a meticulous relating of the artistic creation to the life events of the protagonist unfolding on the screen, and the sense of vibrance and passion of life-love of life despite the specter of continuous disaster.
Structural weakness, though, does occur, for the viewer does not know what to make of the story-is it a romance, life and art, marital discord, feminism, lesbian love,  a diatribe on sex (copulation is not much more that urinating, Diego Rivera insists, eager to rationalize his amoral dalliances), or a broad brush with political ideology? As the movie progresses beyond its middle section, Diego Rivera finds himself in New York, a Mexican communist attempting to depict Lenin on the Rockefeller Plaza; he is fired by an enraged Nelson Rockefeller (Ed Norton), and practically banished from that city. The movie plot opens in new directions, and soon Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush) appears in the horizon, banished from Russia by Stalin, and taking refuge in Mexico. Things get hotter, as Trotsky and Frida embark on untimely romance. Trotsky's wife is present, and the romance of the elderly man-which might have been forgiven if platonic-reveals some lack of taste on the part of the filmmakers, for it is completely pointless and adds nothing to the mystique of the legendary fugitive from the Soviet Union, a man who clearly saw world evil figures equally divided (though different in kind) between Stalin and Hitler. The film's polemics are half-baked and not thought through, thus harming the overall artistic result. Tragic romance in one thing; delving into politics and taking no sides (was the communist Rivera a menace or not-was his art corrupt?) makes the film not ambiguous in that sense, but confused and confusing. Art relating to personal life is a well-wrought theme, and perhaps it would have sufficed. Frida's courage to endure and survive (and win) despite her handicaps-these are all well taken points.  But the politics in the story lacks clear direction-we do not know, for instance, why and how a communist artist becomes corrupt by his wrong ideology (if that is the word), or whether his ideology does not matter if he is a good artist. On the other hand, Frida's art is allowed full play, her daring innovations are given enough space and a sensitive treatment as images on the screen, and her innovativeness (Breton called her a surrealist artist) and boldness in expressing inner states in disturbing imagery-these are well made points. Though the film is not preoccupied with feminism, Frida, the character, comes through as a woman artist whose odyssey may have carved a new way for female artists but also for women in general. Bill Moyers  has called this movie heroic and said that ""Women see in it a hero's journey.""  Frida Kahlo fully qualifies for such a description: She has the courage to defeat (though not entirely) physical disability, she has the courage of her convictions as an artist and never compromises, and she can stand up to the brutally a more and more famous male counterpart (Rivera), and boldly surpasses him in originality and talent. She dies as defiantly as she has lived.
In this sense, the film does superbly. We get a female artist's struggles with illness, bad luck, misfortune, betrayal, and rises above it all. Subtract politics, or incorporate it more organically, and you would get an overall superb movie. As it is, this movie is worth seeing.  The whole may not be perfect, but most of the parts are brilliant.",1057708800,2,5848,4.94908350305499

1520241,5,B00005JLPK,"Before watching this movie I had no idea who Frida was.  I knew that the film was directed by Julie Taymor (Titus), which meant that it would have a striking visual style.  I knew that the movie starred Salma Hayek and that she had wanted to play this role for years.  I knew that it had been nominated for 6 Academy Awards including a Best Actress nomination for Hayek.  But I did not know anything about the subject of the film.
Frida is a biopic focusing on the life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek).  As much as the movie focuses on the life of Frida, it seemed that the main thrust of picture was on Frida's relationship with her husband, painter Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina).  The film does cover Frida's life from her childhood right up to her death.  We begin the movie when Frida is a young woman aspiring to be a painter.  Her father is highly supportive of her dreams.  However, she is riding on a trolley one day when it gets into an accident.  She has to be in a body cast for some time and it was in doubt whether she would ever walk again.  She recovers, but she lives a life of pain.  Frida meets the womanizing painter, Diego Rivera and they get married.  This does not mean that he changes his ways and naturally this causes problems in their marriage.  They remain committed to each other even when they are each sleeping with other people.  Over the course of the movie we see Frida painting, but it seems that Frida the artist gets pushed to the side and we see Frida the woman/wife.  I don't know enough about Frida Kahlo to know if this is a flaw in the movie or not, but it is just the way the movie is.
The acting in this movie is superb.  Nothing feels wrong or forced.  But, surpassing even the excellent acting is the visual presentation of Frida.  Her artwork appears throughout the movie, but not simply as paintings hanging on the wall.  Kahlo's artwork appears first as a painting, but that painting transforms into the scene itself.  This also works the opposite way in that a scene will end up as a painting and the transitions between the two are so smooth it is very impressive.
I was very impressed with Frida.  I didn't care for Julie Taymos's other film (Titus), so I didn't know what to expect.  Everyone (Hayek, Taymor) exceeded my expectations for the movie.  This was a very good movie.",1056672000,20,2340,4.400932400932401
1520242,3,B00005JLPK,"Frida was a well made movie.  The cinematography was great, the acting was good, everything worked quite well.  What troubled me with this movie was my inability to connect with it.
I expected to be drawn into Frida's character and to be able to understand who she is and what her motivations are, but I found the film lacking that explantion of her character.
It became apparent to me that in order to fully enjoy this movie, you have to be familiar with the life and circumstances of Frida and you have to identify with her character prior to watching the film.
This was my mistake, as I watched the film, knowing little more about Frida than that she was a painter.  To me the film unfolded as a series of events in ""someone's"" life.  It was like watching the home videos of a stranger (well, that is overexaggerating quite a bit, but you get the point), it is just a few events in Frida's life that I had no connection with.
The one scene I could connect with was the death scene.  I felt more of the movie should have followed the same style as that scene.  While watching that scene, I finally felt involved in the movie, instead of being a spectator.  Frida lives an interesting life, but if I can't connect with her character, then I can't really enjoy the movie.
So, in conclusion, this is a well-crafted film, but it assumes that you are familiar with and have an interest in Frida, which I am not and do not.  So, don't be an idiot like me and use this movie as your introduction to Frida.  Do your homework on her first.",1056499200,23,1532,4.347368421052631
1520243,3,B00005JLPK,"First off,this is a DVD review not a film commentary.
This DVD release was a disappointment. I loved the film. It had great acting, beautiful cinematography, well written and well... it was just plain good. I say the DVD was disappointing for numerous reasons. First of it appears that the two disc set is offering you a lot of additional information. What it is actually offering is a lot of fluff. The extras contain absolutely nothing about the real life character that the film was about. The only information we get about the real Frida was a quick walkthrough of the Blue house. It would have been nice to get even a brief photo documentary highlighting her life. Another thing I was hoping to see on the DVD release was an art gallery of Frida's work.  You would figure that a film about the artist would at least show her work on the DVD release. To me the extras were more about stroking the filmmaker's egos on a job well done than to honor the person the film was about.
 This release is also a huge slap in the face to Spanish speaking buyers. Frida was a Mexican Icon, yet Miramax felt that the DVD release didn't need a Spanish language track. The release is only in English and French. Now does it make sense to honor Frida and neglect her native language on the DVD? I find it insulting, and I am not even Mexican.
 To get down to it, the DVD is beautifully packaged but it is only a gilded wrapping.  I expected more from a two-disc set than what I got. This release definitely does not do honor to the person from whose life they are profiting from. Don't get me wrong the film alone is worth picking up the DVD. But why should I have to pay for an extra disc that essentially is nothing more than the filmmakers patting themselves on the back?

Throughout her adult life, she also dealt with constant physical pain caused by a near fatal traffic accident. She was one of the most remarkable women of the 20th Century. The film is a visually dazzling work but is brought down a notch by a script which never completely captures her essence. The life of a brilliant artist is admittedly difficult to convey, due to the genius, eccentricity and ego involved, and ""Frida"" does manage to come close to achieving its loft goals.
Selma Hayek gives a masterful, heartfelt performance as Frida, as does Alfred Molina as Diego. What inspires us, however, is the direction by Julie Taymor, whose colorful and amazing visuals tell us much about how Frida may have viewed the world. Taymor, I feel, is as much an artist as her subject. The script may waver and meander, but Taymor's direction shows that she innately understands who and what Frida was.

Shot in and around the Mexico City locations where Kahlo, her husband, Diego Rivera, and their lovers lived and played, ""Frida"" brilliantly captures the brightness of the light, the intensity of the colors and the omnipresence of Mexican motifs that informed Kahlo's art. Director Taymor has smartly avoided the traps that make so many films about artists irritating, and the even bigger traps inherent in a biopic of a figure like Kahlo, who became the center of a feverish Sylvia Plath-like victim-cult in the '80s. Taymor eschews the standard Kahlo martyrology, emphasizing instead her triumph over physical and emotional agony, her humor and joie de vivre. And she makes the love that Kahlo shared with Rivera the real subject of the story.
Taymor captures both the glamorous, deeply cosmopolitan milieu Kahlo and Rivera inhabited, and the importance Mexico had in the '30s for the international left. The only thing that lets down the feeling of authenticity is the odd accents adopted by cast members like Judd, Valeria Golino (who plays one of Rivera's ex-wives) and Geoffrey Rush.

Director Julie Taymor uses a greatly imaginative style to portray the interesting, though at times a little dull, life of Frida.  The spectacular set and costume design were a highlight of the film, as well as the meaningful performance of Salma Hayak and the supporeting cast, i.e. Alfred Molina who is tremedous as the lead male.  This movie at times seemed to drag but was quickly picked up by moments of excitement, not to mention the sheer audacity of Frida and her life.  The film seems to focus far too much on how others thought of her work insted of letting the stunning visuals speak for themselves.  I also felt that there was not enough attention given to artwork itself, in actuality her husbamd's work seems to be more important than hers in the movie.  I thought the film was very intriguing, before it I had never gone into the depths of the true character of Frida, in all truth I knew little more than her name.  This is a brilliant display of a tortured person who perseveers and makes a terrific artist of herself.  Overall I thought it was a very interesting, decorative film and though it had its flaws definitely worht your viewing.",1055721600,3,1412,4.466926070038911
1520273,5,B00005JLPK,"Julie Taymor truly fascinates me. I was blown away by her knockout film debut Titus, and now she has created this excellent follow up, Frida. I loved Frida's artwork and was very excited to see this film, and was there in the theater opening weekend. I have to say I was not let down at all. Most of the audience enjoyed the movie too from what I overheard after the film ended.
I loved the lush colors, as many other reviews has stated. But, a lot of the color schemes were beautiful as well. For example, the scene where Frida is in Paris with the singing woman (which she spent the night with) was excellent. I loved the washed golden pallet used for that part.
Also, the bus collision toward the films opening was perfectly done. I loved all the little details such as the blue bird, oranges, and gold. The shot of Frida covered in blood as the goled dust covered her was truly haunting. Other things were nice as well like the New York collage, and the way Frida's paintings blended into her real life showed the emotional aspect from where the artwork came from. One part that is truly heartbreaking was the painting with her in the back brace, when the stone pillar that represented her spine crackles into many disjointed sections, and water wells up in the paintings eyes like tears. Artwork like that packs a powerful punch.
True, it may seem that the movie is more of a ""highlights"" or ""greatest hits"" of Frida's life rather then a textured novel. The movie dances from one event to the other. But, then again, it probably felt that way to Frida herself.
On another note, Salma Hayek was excellent in this role. I remember during Oscar season when everyone said she was the first one out of the race for Best Actress. After watching this again, I storngly disagree. You can honestly see Frida morph from a young wild girl, into the artist and woman, and finally into a angry cripple that still retained her humor. Hayek did this role justice. I shudder to think that Madonna and Jennifer Lopez wanted to play the famed painter in competing projects.
Finally to round out this review I would like to compliment this wonderful 2 Disc Dvd set. Julie Taymor has embraced the format to full extent with Titus, and now with Frida. Nothing but top quality from her. Bravo!",1055462400,2,2276,4.54014598540146
1520274,5,B00005JLPK,"Many people I know who are long-time admirers of the life and times of the great Mexican artist, Frida Kahlo, have mixed feelings about this film.  On one hand, they admire the way the whole film itself looks like some of her paintings, but they are upset with the fact that it focuses more on her sex life than anything else.
While this may be true, there are more than enough strong elements in this film to make it a dazzling success and, in my opinion, one of the best films of 2002.
Director Julie Taymor seems to have mastered the art of mise-en-scene with this film.  Everything the viewer is subjected to is nothing short of stunning.  Like Kahlo, Taymor uses a palate with so many different colors to shade this film.
Salma Hayek, who championed this project, gives the performance of her career.  Whether she is playing the young, awkward, teenage Kahlo at the beginning of the film, the sassy and bold Kahlo in her twenties and thirties, or the frail, aging, yet determined Kahlo at the end of the film, Hayek is always convincing and intense.
As good as Hayek is, Alfred Molina, as Diego Rivera, all but steals the show.  Molina has to be one of the most underrated actors out there.  He perfectly captures the eccentric, moody, yet extremely lovable artist that Rivera was.  Having put on tremendous weight for the role (or just wearing lots of padding), Molina portrays Rivera as an inspirational and lovable ladies man.  How the Academy didn't even give him a nomination is beyond me.
Geoffrey Rush appears later in the film giving yet another excellent performance, this time as the Russian exile Trotsky.  In addition, look for great cameos by the likes of Edward Norton, Ashley Judd and Antonio Banderas.
Some may be put off by FRIDA, thinking it to be just another biopic about a dead artist.  This film is much more.  Rivera was the communist party chairman for some time in Mexico and got into some trouble for his beliefs when he was in the US for a  while, so besides giving the viewer insights to different aspects of Kahlo's life, this film also touches on the politics and history of not just Mexico, but the entire world during the 1930's and 1940's.
This is an important and daring film that comes off incredibly well.  I highly recommend it!",1055462400,,2270,4.616915422885572
1520315,4,B00005JLPK,"""Frida"" follows the life of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo from her university days in 1922 until her death in 1954. While still in school, Frida (Salma Hayek) is severely injured in a trolley accident from which she would never fully recover. She lived the rest of her life in pain as a result of the innumerable broken bones she suffered in that accident. Determined to earn a living in spite of her physical condition, she asks artist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina) to tell her if her work is good enough to sell. Rivera admires Frida's work very much and takes her on, at first as a protege, then as a lover, then as a wife. The film follows Frida and Rivera's relationship over the course of 25 years of marriage, divorce, and remarriage. We witness Rivera's artistic success and then commercial failure in the United States. And we see Frida's success abroad and, finally, at home in Mexico as she always wished, but which came only shortly before her death. Frida Kahlo's life was haunted -if not consumed- by pain and loss. It was shaped by a fateful accident in her youth. Ironically, if not for the accident, she probably would never have painted. And since she did, we can see the conditions under which she lived expressed in her many paintings.

""Frida"" is based on Hayden Herrera's biography of Frida Kahlo and is filmed in a largely conventional biopic style in spite of its unconventional subject. At times, Salma Hayek is admirable in her ability to convey how much Frida Kahlo's constant physical pain shaped her life and work. At other times, Hayek's Frida is too agile to be a self-described cripple.  The film does not shy away from depicting Diego Rivera's or Frida Kahlo's Marxist political convictions. But it does place Diego Rivera in a more sympathetic light than I usually see him described. I was under the impression that he was considerably more self-obsessed and dogmatic than he is in ""Frida"". But I find no fault with Rivera's character in the movie since the film sees Rivera through his wife's eyes, which love may have blinded to some of his faults.  Salma Hayek is a great admirer of Frida Kahlo and produced ""Frida"" herself. Many of her Hollywood friends contributed by taking small roles in the film. Edward Norton appears as Nelson Rockafeller, Ashley Judd as photographer Tina Modotti, and Antonio Banderas as David Alfaro Siqueiros. This film doesn't come close to painting a complete picture of Frida Kahlo's character. But it is a solid effort that attempts to bring Kahlo's work to a wider audience. I recommend ""Frida"" for Salma Hayek's  solid -although overtly self-promoting- performance and for the insight it provides into Frida's Kahlo's work.",1055376000,,2690,4.841304347826087
1520316,5,B00005JLPK,"I think that this is the most underrated movie of the year! This movie was a wonderful interpretation of an artists life. Selma Hayek was wondeful in the film and fully deserved he nomination, maybe even the win (I have seen all performances except Nicole Kidman's, but this one is by far the best). The real surprise to me was the fact that Alfred Molina did not recive an Oscar nomination for the movie. He was wonderful as Diego Rivera. If there was a weak link in this film, It would be Ashley Judd. I really could not see why they picked her for the role. But, she only had one big scene in the film so it was not so bad. Antonio Banderas was only in one scene, but he played his part very well. As with Edward Norton, he played very nicely as the man who hired Diego to paint the mural in New York in a small but crucial role. Geoffery Rush gave a wonderful performance as the man who had fled from Russia into the home of Frida's father.
 This movie also had wonderful music, art design and direction by Julie Taymor(who directed The Lion King on Broadway). All in all, this was a wonderful film.",1055376000,3,1103,4.252380952380952

Alfred Molina takes center stage in this FRIDA as a thoroughly well-realized Diego Rivera, and while Salma Hayek has good moments she is restricted by a script which is corny and hackneyed.  The ""big names"" include Antonio Banderas, Ashley Judd, Geoffrey Rush and Edward Norton - each given literally a few minutes of screen time.  They are good, but the parts (aside from Rush's Trotsky) are so minimal that they could have easily been played by novices.  The beauties of this film are in the visual effects - Frida Kahlo's paintings 'coming alive' or reconstructing from life experiences. And there are moments that are lushly beautiful and touching (the dance between Hayek and Judd for example).  But overall there is a lack of the spirit of Frida Kahlo - a woman unique among artists.  Hayek tries hard, but opts for the beautiful Salma more than the pathetically pained Frida.  The Disc of featurettes is worth your time.  AND  Julie Taymor is definitely a talent to contend with!",1055376000,,1326,4.914798206278027

But Salma should be congratulated for having the chutzpa to persist with her dream and vision! She gave us a winner. I saw this when it was in the theatre, and was truly moved by it.
The story of Frida is a beautful tragic one and it's told perfectly here. The colors are rich. The blends of Frida's paintings, particularly at the end, make the viewer really understand the pain that Frida felt in her body, and how it transferred itself to the canvas!

The movie allows you to have a little more understanding of the work of Frida Kahlo. Through the use of sparse FX and some very fine photography the imagination, experiences and vision of Frida Kahlo are shown transformed into her paintings.

I own Julie Taymor's TITUS and the DVD (also 2-DVD) is wonderful to watch, and I mean, not only the movie but all of the extras.  She's really genius when it comes to elaborate a set and a scene; one gets to feel a balance of elements united by dialogue.  FRIDA is no exception, I was happy to learn.
The movie is a great visual journey and its plot is decisively an intense love story.  I don't think this movie needed to make a political statement about what Mexico was like 5 or 6 decades ago, as many critics in Mexico have complained.  It's the kind of movie that invites you to enjoy beauty and relate to love in all the ways it moves us.
I'm so sad that so many Mexicans have demonized Salma Hayek and her movie when it's really a great example of what perseverance and discipline can achieve. (Two things I'm sure these people lack of)

1520384,4,B00005JLPK,"From the top it is a love story, Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera.
We meet Frida as a high school student just before a tragic and life-changing bus accident which leaves her in constant pain for the rest of her life.
Diego is perhaps 20 years her senior, is already a successful mural painter. divorced and bedding anyone with big breasts.
But what makes it a extraordinary movie is that the director tries to capture the essence of Frida and her art with the movie itself. Pieces are animated and sequences built around her particular paintings. The technic draws the watcher into the artisitic world far better than a strict narrative. Nicely done and effective, somehow he communicates to me, an absolute anti-art idiot, through the media some of the essential Frida.
The movie is a riot of color, everywhere, from the changing colors of her dresses, the walls of her home (his is red, hers is blue?, with a skybridge joining them), to the colors of the scarves she braids into her hair. Like color the move is full of sex, straight sex, lesbian sex, sex with models, sexy dances, breasts in murals, naked models, Frida as pain wracked in a body cast but sexy.... Then we have politics, Trotsky, Mexican revolutionaries, comrades singing late into the night, protest parades.
And passionate drinking, and dancing, and flower gardens. lust all the way down....
But this is all secondary to PASSION. sex, hungry pushy grabby horny sex but not so much as animal lust followed by exhaustion but sex as symptomatic, as pointing to; the real passion for life, despite the pain, despite a unfaithful husband (""you were never a husband to me"") who knew only loyalty to his painting. That is what the movie is about. The passion of a women- Frida Kahlo- in love with life as few people ever are. Most of us are blobs, pieces of animated meat, seldom rising above the level of sentience to trackle the big questions. That is the theme of the movie, to communicate this passion for life that effected everyone around her. Certainly built around her relationship with Diego, with storm and tears, tender late life hugging to temper tantrums galore, always colored by her (and his) art. Walls full of art, from a picture of a young Mao to a mural destroyed because of Lenin's face within it.
The big questions: relationship of art to real life, Mexican unjustice and unequal distribution of wealth and therefore opportunities, the right to sensual pleasure free of constraints, the relationship of one woman to one man. This are touched on, but peripherally, even with the affair with Trotsky, it is her passion that draws people to her bed, figuratively and literally.
Art communicates differently than does science. Art doesn't use words the same way as prose; straightforward, literal, linear, logical. Rather Art is like poetry; confused, non linear, non verbal, expressive, colorful, sexy, progressive, emotional. The movie, like the woman, is artist(ic). It hits you in a different place than does thinking about something, for it is about identifying with someone, understanding them. I could read a biography of Frida, i might even be able to page through a book of her paintings, but i don't think i would have the same feelings afterwards as i have now having seen the movie. Logic and reason are not the only ways of knowledge, words and books are not the only way to transmit information, this movie shows another way: emotional, raw, images, feeling for someone. Certainly i know these things are manipulated to create a movie, but underneath the need to sell tickets, for the director to get his next movie and his next paycheck, is a bigger, more important issue of what it means to be human. what it means to let out the things inside, to express the creatively, the desire, the needs, the passion inside. And that is the genius of this movie, true to Frida's real personality or not, it shows, and better yet, allows us to experience one special woman's life. Thanks.

1520385,1,B00005JLPK,"I don't know why I thought I might like this movie when I went to see it. It gets an F in three catagories
1. Historical accuracy - Yes there was a woman named Frida who was married to Diego and lived in Mexico, but that's where the history seems to end. Frida was actually a staunch Stalinist (the last painting she was working on when she died was of him) and only briefly flurted with Trotskyism (mostly when she was sleeping with Trotsky). Her husband was more than a cheat as he was also a wife beater, but I guess feminists can't have a hero that goes back to an abusive husband.
2. Artfulness - It tried way too hard. Making her paintings become animated was mostly awkward. The black and white with parts colored was poorly placed, sympolized nothing, and was used WAY too much.
3. Acting - All of it seemed forced and Hayek is the most over-rated actress this side of Halle Berry. I could never sympathize with the main character as half her troubles are her own making.
Over all, the tragedy in the movie is found in its dishonesty, not in its story.",1050364800,27,1060,4.331658291457287
1520386,4,B00005JLPK,"Born in Mexico in 1907 just prior to the beginning of the Mexican revolution, Frida Kahlo becomes an icon in the art world after being confined to her bed and forced to find an outlet from what must have been inconceivable pain and torture.  She marries (twice) the famous muralist Diego Rivera who is played by Fred Molina--Rivera is best known for in the US for painting a mural for Rockafeller and having it torn down because he refused to take the image of Stalin out.  At 6 Frida had been diagnosed with polio and suffered from a slightly malformed leg throughout her physically tortured life.  Later, at around 17, she is in a city bus accident and a metal rod found its way through her abdomen and exited via the pelvic region.  Because of all this Frida is at the mercy of well meaning surgeons throughout her life and suffers body casts, odd traction devices and surgeries which in that day might have seemed helpful.  While being confined to her bed Frida's parents supply her with paint and canvas.  That is where the history of Frida's art and the thick of the movie begins.
  Selma Hayek plays the part of Frida Kahlo from youth to death.  Sparsed in between the performances are hallucinogenic scenes which masterfully depict some of her more abstract representations.  Although I felt the performances forced it did flow better during the 2nd half of the movie.  In addition to the physical suffering she endured Frida also endured Rivera--she said there were two great accidents in her life and one of them was Diego.  I wondered if the movie would depict much of the suffering Frida went through and that it does probably because Hayek produced the film herself.  It also characterizes her (Frida) ideas of transmutation of sorts as it ran in her life as well.  Perhaps the picture could have been aided by more attention to performance as I was left unconvinced in several places.  I do believe Miss Hayek tried to convey Frida's lust for any joy in life and living it for its very base values.  As the end approached I saddened knowing that this colorful, exuberant person had already passed years ago but was leaving again in a darkened theatre.  Some people describe Frida's art as disturbing but once you see it from her perspective it changes into something very familiar to all of us.
  If you enjoy music from the Mexican culture I highly recommend the sound-track.  Even though I didn't understand many words the emotional addition of the music turned stoic scenes into moving resonation's.",1049846400,3,2516,4.727064220183486

1520388,2,B00005JLPK,"I'm probably one of the biggest Frida Kahlo fans on earth, reading everything I can find about her. I love her paintings: they give me so much comfort, they make me cry and smile at the same time. Frida was so corageous, so witty, so kind, so sweet. Despite all the sorrow and pain in her life, she made wonderful things.
I suppose it comes as no surprise I had been waiting for this movie for a year...and then, when I finally saw it, I was so disappointed!
Salma Hayek makes a handsome Frida and the pictures are beautifully knit together with the Mexican music. The scene in which Frida litteraly meets Death is haunting and very good. But all in all...no, this isn't a very good movie. It focuses too much on Frida's relationship with Diego Rivera and too little on her paintings - actually the most important thing in her life.
Short review: Frida, 47, lies dying in her bed, remembering her life. She is a young student, she's in love, everything's perfect. Crash, here comes the trolley, she's lying in the street, bleeding heavily, they put her in a body cast and she cries, then all of a sudden she's well and healthy. She marries Diego, they make love, he makes love to another woman, he makes love to her sister, Frida makes love to other men and other women, they argue, they reunite, Frida loses her leg, she cries, she screams, she dies. And all the time Salma looks absolutely perfect. No moustache, no body hair at all, no limping, just a tiny scar. Soon you get pretty tired at seeing Salma's feminine charms bounce before the camera. Why doesn't she paint?!?! And then, suddenly, in the end of the movie, she has a big vernissage with all her wonderful paintings, and it makes you wonder ""WHEN did she paint them!?""
Of course Diego was the most important person in Frida's life, but it's so typical to let the woman be just a wife. Frida had a very strong personality, but you don't see much of it here.
I would recommend you all to see the Mexican movie ""Frida naturaleza viva"" (1984), starring Ofelia Medina. It's much, much better!

1520389,4,B00005JLPK,"Frida is the astonishing and beautifully mounted movie biography  on the famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. Vibrantly brought to life by Salma Hayek, wh has long sought over this as her dream project, it is an in-depth and uncanny portrait of a woman and an artist ahead of her time. The film effortlessly spans from her life as a  youth, to her debilitating bus accident, to her despair and success and her joyful exit in 1954 when she died at the age of 47.
 Survived by her husband, artist Diego Rivera, their art prevailed over time as cultural milestones that have been internationally celebrated.
As an artist, Frida Kahlo found beauty in imperfections and practiced surrealism that was both provocative and striking. Often counterpart to her critics' assessments, Frida was a unique individual, fiercely opinionated and strong-willed. Director Julie Taymor vividly articulates the inspirations that passed through Frida's life, blending color pictures and color animation, black and white dream reality  with black and white newsreel footage, all with fiesta-flavored boldness. Frida is illuminated for us to show how the inspiration of art was reflected in her vision, taking us beyond the step of mere  observation. We see Frida through her own eyes, the fire in her artistic process.
Not particularly self-confident in her abilities at the beginning, Frida sought out Diego Rivera (played remarkably by Alfred Molina) to assess her talent. ""I'm not asking you if you think I'm good. I'm asking you if I should continue painting,"" Frida tells him. They instantly become friends and then lovers, but Diego is forefront about his womanizing and infidelities. Frida accepts his behavior and marries him anyway, against all better judgment. When an art exhibit takes Diego to the States for the first time, Frida insists that she join him instead of being the typical wife held back home. Diego surrenders to cultural assimilation while Frida is left uninterested and detached by American politics that she can't identify with. When Diego takes a paid assignment from Nelson Rockefeller (Edward Norton) to paint a mural, he refuses to remove a communist reference in his work and is persuaded to return home.
While Frida and Diego shared the same views on politics, even boarding Russian communist Leon Trotsky in Mexico while they hid him from bounty assassins, they couldn't find appeasement together because of Diego's wandering imprudence. The rage between them escalates until they decide to separate, and Frida begins to have greater concentration on her own personal career. Frida took lovers both male and female, unashamed of experimenting in both her art and her life. Her signature mustache and unibrow were also a signature of her dual nature -  two women named Frida that shared the same heart if diversified by separate, contrasting desires and contrasting identities, (she dressed as a man with a mousratche on occassions) But her undying devotion ultimately belonged to Diego, and despite their resentment for each other they came to realize that they needed each other most because their hearts were connected by ties of shared identity.
The film is also superbly cast with supporting players. Geoffrey Rush makes an elegant Leon Trotsky, Roger Rees is intuitive as Frida's father, and Valeria Golina is ravishing as Diego's spurned first wife. The one embarrassing casting mistake is with Ashley Judd who is supposed to play a well-respected Mexican photographer. Her overblown, fiery ethnic delivery is disruptive, but is thankfully limited to a few scenes. It would be excusable if Ashley Judd was cast because she was a big, established star name in order to help Frida get financed. Then the compromise would be warranted. But if that wasn't the case then casting Ashley Judd should have been, by all means, avoided.
But the film survives the small casting mistake because the rest of the production is a grand achievement. This is a film made with a bold palette of colors and is a rich testament to the mystifying beauty of Mexico. Hayek is gutsy and sensational in the lead role, always sizzling with heart, breadth and personality. This is something of a remarkable turnaround for the actress after long being pigeon-holed in cliched ethnic roles. Hayek is remaking her persona and announcing her acting capabilities in the same way that Halle Berry reinvented herself with Monster's Ball last year. There is courageous beauty in her performance as in Frida's art. Because of Hayak's diligence to get this movie made, Frida Kahlo will be immortalized even beyond the fine art community into the heart of Oscar Hollywood.
Speaking of Oscars, one of the best things about Hayek's searing performance is that it doesn't have Oscar-acclaim written all over it (though she certainly deserves a nod). She doesn't just act Frida, she inhabits her. Her portrayal is as tender as it is ferocious, as sensitive as it is commanding.
This is not a happy story and does not have an upbeat ending. What it does have is the spontaneous energy of the Mexican culture, and those noisy colors celebrating in the tropical sun that fills the courtyards and colonial architecture of Spanish explorers from centuries past.
There is no triumph, but there is much determination in the actual story as in the plot of the movie. Salma Hayek must get two thumps up for her brilliant portrayal of a courageous, strong headed, passionate and vibrant woman in the movie.
When Frida is finally granted an exhibition in her homeland, Hayek and the director  can't help but come to mind as Rivera introduces her work, saying, ""I don't believe ever before has a woman put such agonized poetry on canvas."" Or so beautifully, on screen.
The hardest part about ""Frida"" is the film's length. It feels long as it constantly keeps batting at her tortured existence with and without Diego (her husband) . I really enjoyed a lot of Frida but the last 5 minutes really didn't harness a solid ending, infact they left a strange sense of vagueness on the directors part.
Otherwise, Frida is this year's most captivating and passionate film.",1047168000,6,6125,5.05242334322453
1520390,5,B00005JLPK,"I was taken back by surprise this afternoon while watching this spectacular film protraying the life of the Mexican surrealist artist of Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek). I now wonder why I neglected to see FRIDA earlier as it has been playing at a local cinema for many weeks. But what I can say for sure is that I was the one who missed out by not enjoying it sooner. The chronological events of Frida's life are brilliantly combined with images of her paintings actually coming to life on the screen and becoming an independent entity apart from their creator. One can view many autobiographical elements of Frida's life that were included in her artwork. I sympathized with Frida for the obstacles she had to face, including being seriously injured in a trolley accident that left her handicapped. With that being said, I felt no sympathy for her when her husband, Diego Riveria, cheated on her since she was well aware of his 'habits' when she married him. Frida naively believed that Diego would change. In addition to Salma Hayek's excellent performance, the cinematography of Mexico City and the Mayan ruins are very well done. This film captures beautiful Mexico City when it was often known as the 'Paris of the New World' during the first half of the 20th century. I highly recommend FRIDA but don't make my mistake, see it now before it leaves the theater and you won't regret it.",1045958400,,1385,4.7272727272727275
1520391,3,B00005JLPK,"Getting a film on the screen depicting the fascinating life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo had been a long time labor of love of Vera Cruz born Salma Hayek which reached fruition, enabling her to succeed in putting the story on the screen after efforts by Madonna and Jennifer Lopez to put together projects on Kahlo failed.
Hayek stars in the film and produces.  Determined to see that an empathic women's touch was maintained, she acquired Julie Taymor, who had directed ""Titus"" on screen and ""The Lion King"" on Broadway, to work with her.  Hayek closely resembles the famous Mexican artist and delivers a gusto performance capturing her zest for life and overwhelming passion.  Shortly after the film commences the pivotal moment of Kahlo's life which influences what occurs thereafter is shown.  She is riding in a trolley in Mexico City when the vehicle spins out of control and she is painfully impaled on a steel bar.  After hovering between life and death the determined, courageous Kahlo endures.  The rest of her life finds her experiencing acute pain.  If anything, it only increases her determination to develop her painting talent all the more, using her creativity to help block out pain.
In early career, as she seeks to pursue greatness with brush and easel, Hayek as Kahlo meets the man she will marry and interact with the rest of her life, tempestuous painter Diego Rivera, played by Alfred Molina, who quickly becomes impressed with her skills.  Even though he drives her to helpless rage through frequently infidelity, she realizes that creatively and temperamentally they are suited in many ways to one another.
Kahlo's bisexuality is brought out early in a fascinating scene in which American libertine Ashley Judd announces that she will dance with whomever can consume the largest amount of tequila.  Molina and Antonio Banderas, after arguing about the merits of Stalin and Trotsky, do battle.  They are both astonished to see Hayek outdrink them both, after which she dances with sensuous gusto with Judd.
A celebrated affair of Kahlo's life, which occurred in the early forties with Russian political exile Leon Trotsky, who was being pursued by Soviet Union dictator Joseph Stalin, is revealed. After Trotsky leaves the protected sanctuary in Mexico City and the temporary safety afforded by the constant guards posted by admirer Rivera, he is shortly therafter assassinated by an axe attack while he works on his critical biography of Stalin and the Russian Communist movement.
While the political commitment to Communism on the part of Kahlo and Rivera is brought out in the script, it is done so tangentially rather than explored definitively.  It would have helped to demonstrate the compelling reasons behind the strong beliefs of both painters.  The acute poverty of the people could have been dramatically linked to their art and political commitment.  Instead, in an endeavor to cover as much of Frida's colorful life as possible, many of the scenes were revealed in briefer vignette form.  One dramatic clash was revealed between Communist Rivera and wealthy benefactor Nelson Rockefeller, played by Hayek's boyfriend Edward Norton, when the painter's commission to prepare a mural on the walls of Rockefeller Center in Manhattan was cancelled when the multimillionaire opposed Rivera's proletarian art.
A high point of the film was the passionate Latin musical score of Eliot Goldenthal.  His fine effort resulted in the film's lone Golden Globe award.  Hayek was nominated for Best Actress in a Drama, an award which went to Nicole Kidman for ""The Hours.""",1044057600,5,3594,5.1179487179487175

1520432,4,B00005JLPK,"Faced with the heavy burden of playing a National Treasure of her native country Mexico, Salma Hayek along with her director, Julie Taymor have come up with a magical, sensual film in ""Frida.""
Hayek's Frida is a woman with big dreams who is down-to-earth enough to figure out that bringing her dreams to fruition involves hard work and knowing the right people. When she realizes she might have talent as an Artist, she demands of Diego Rivera, the most famous of Mexican painters at the time, to know the truth: tell me if I am wasting my time painting, tell me the truth, she says. Rivera encourages her in her art and before long they become lovers, though Rivera is much older and a big mountain of a man prone to womanize, yet obviously in love with Frida.
The visuals are awe-inspiring, which comes as no surprise to anyone who knows Taymor's previous work in ""Titus"" and ""The Lion King."" But here, Taymor takes her vision one step further by bringing many of Frida's paintings to life by presenting them as tableaux vivantes.
Much is made of the political climate in Mexico at the time (1920's) and many famous people (Nelson Rockefeller, for one) are trotted out, but it is the relationship of Frida and Diego that is at the core of this film. Hayek and Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera are fascinating to watch and accomplish something that is very difficult: they make living, breathing, feeling human beings of these historical figures. Not an easy task.
""Frida"" is as beautiful as a Kahlo painting, but more importantly there is an over-riding intelligence coupled with a voluptuous sensuality at work here that is hard not to appreciate and admire.",1042934400,2,1658,4.740484429065744

The people so attached to wildness of fame,
Betrayal of the lust, the endless courting game,
In fiery of fumes induced by burning flame,
Of drugs and alcohol, of love to life and pain.

The cinematography was gorgeous, and the movie stayed very true to Frida's life.  In fact, a little too true.  I feel that this movie tried way to hard to make sure that everyone new Frida's ENTIRE life story.  I don't think that we needed all that.  There were about a 20 scenes that could have been cut out and it wouldn't have taken anything away from the movie.  And what was with the gratuitous sex?  Dont' get me wrong, I have no complaints there.  But after Frida is crippled and old, randomly they cut to a lesbian scene with her and some stranger.  What the hell? Anyway, see the movie if you know who the real Kahlo is and appreciate good cinematoghraphy.  It can be kind of a bore if your not an artsy person.",1042070400,,842,4.305732484076433

And I don't remember the last time I got so emocional watching a film, and objetivally speaking, it is a wonderful piece of art displaying not only history of Mexico but the great role of the artistic movement of the time in the history of art. Salma is great and has won my respect, the music and the photography is exceptional.

1520436,3,B00005JLPK,"Frida is not a bad picture, and Salma Hayek gives a pretty good performance as the tortured and talented Mexican artist. It would hardly be possible to make a dull movie about Frida Kahlo. She lived in a fascinating, turbulent period in history, incidents which are duly noted in the script, and was surrounded by fascinating people, many of whom are superbly portrayed in the film, notably the outrageously talented Alfred Molina as Diego Rivera and Geoffrey Rush as Leon Trotsky. Director Julie Taymor, of Broadway's Lion King, has an eye for colorful and stirring visuals, and even the occasional dissolves into fantastic tableaux based on Kahlo's paintings work.
The major problem, alas, is Hayek. One would like to admire her performance unreservedly given her sincerity in fighting to get this picture made. She bears a startling facial resemblance to the real Kahlo and does capture both the woman's mordant humor and her extremes of passion. What she does not capture is the physical Frida Kahlo. Here was a woman whose body was nearly destroyed when she was a teenager, a woman most of whose life was marked by constant, crippling physical pain. Barely a trace of this is evident in Hayek's Kahlo, who walks with hardly a limp, dances, climbs Mayan pyramids and bares her buff body in love scenes with both men and women. Give the scriptwriter credit for not shying away from Kahlo's bisexual nature, but the lesbian scenes have the polished aura of softcore porn, and do a disservice to the rest of the picture.
It's good that a passable, interesting film biography of this great artist and woman got made. It's too bad it isn't altogether worthy of its subject.",1041811200,2,1672,4.870175438596491

I also beleive that this biographical film tells a lot about an artist's life;the way an artist always needs further stimulations to go on. In the case of FRIDA's husband, well played by MOLINA,it's the extramarrital affairs that provides the drive. Isn't it funny the way he always toss those affairs by saying that it doesn't count for him?She finally has her revenge with TROSTKI.Finally, i'd like to say to SALMA to continue producing, because FRIDA was a pleasant surprize.",1041465600,,883,4.630573248407643

It's primarily the love story of Rivera and Kahlo and the story of Kahlo's artistic evolution.  Of course her life encompassed much more, but how much can you say in one movie?

1520440,5,B00005JLPK,"Frida is replete with references and visualizations of death and rebirth. These are not described necessarily on a metaphysical plateau, but are informed by plain metaphor, much like Kahlo's paintings themselves. Infact there are several scenes that were depicted using a device known as tableau vivant, where Kahlo envisions herself in what appears to be a painting, but is subtly animated. It is in this way that we see how Kahlo formulates her compositions that juxtapose consistently conflicting concepts (feminine identity vs. conventions of marriage, love vs. alienation, communism vs. totalitarianism vs. capitalism, rich vs. poor, envy vs. gratitude, etc.)
Early in this film we see Kahlo emerge from a plaster chrysalis inscribed with dozens of butterflies. With plaster residue clinging to her bosoms she arises, transformed by excruciating physical pain and the emotional torture of enduring a prolonged period of immobilization. Immobilization is a recurring theme in her life, which, I believe, is a primary influence in her works as most of her paintings are set either indoors or in surreal locations convoluted in her own consciousness. Further, Kahlo loses her mobility as an independent artist by living in the shadow of Rivera. Kahlo eventually (although temporarily) compromises her identity to assist and accompany Rivera to the United States. This capitulation of her integrity makes her able be his sole emotional and moral support, thus putting her in the (socially acceptable) position of a cheerleader, or one who simply views events from afar rather than participating in them.
Despite the powerful forces that Kahlo struggles against, she is still able to live a luscious and daring life. She expresses herself not only with metaphor but also with raw and emotive sexuality. Kahlo reasserts her femininity and reclaims her (sexual) power by seducing women that Rivera cheated on her with. Also, by declaring her bisexuality she is able, at least in one facet, to occupy a broad range of definitions rather than conform to a singular dialectic Marxian binary. It is through her potent sexuality that she transcends the material into the metaphysical.",1039478400,5,2177,5.349854227405248
1520441,4,B00005JLPK,"Salma Hayek (uni-brow and all) gives a genuinely great performance as ""Frida,"" the Mexican artist who is more famous, perhaps, as the wife of Diego Rivera than as a painter in her own right - although Rivera himself always insisted that it was Frida who had the greater talent.
Frida Kahlo was a woman who endured a life of crippling pain caused by a trolley accident in her youth, yet her innate energy, passion and love of life - as well as her enormous abilities as a painter - allowed her to overcome that daunting obstacle to achieve a measure of fame and recognition.  What she was not quite so successful in overcoming was her strenuous love/hate relationship with Rivera, which came to occupy her time and her life almost as much as her painting.  In many ways, ""Frida"" is a typical artist bio, highly reminiscent of other recent films in the genre such as ""Pollock"" and ""Surviving Picasso,"" both of which also dealt with the serial philandering of their male artist figures.  ""Frida,"" however, since it is focused more intensely on the woman's perspective, offers a few new insights into that seemingly inevitable theme.  Frida, in many ways, prides herself on her independent, fiery nature, yet when Rivera becomes a part of her life, she quickly succumbs to his seductive charms.  She marries Rivera even though she knows he is constitutionally incapable of remaining faithful to her.  Thus, she sets herself up for a life of misery with a man she is utterly incapable of living without.  That the relationship is one of utter co-dependency is demonstrated by the fact that Rivera, even after their numerous breakups, keeps coming back to his one true love.
Based on the Hayden Herrera biography, the Clancy Sigal/Diane Lake/Gregory Nava/Anna Thomas screenplay doesn't paint Frida as some sort of passive victim of her own weaknesses nor as some sort of plaster saint martyr who was entirely guiltless in her own troubled life.  We see, for instance, the hypocrisy inherent in her own romantic dalliances, principally her bisexual flings with other women and even the affair she conducts with none other than Trotsky himself during the period of his exile in Mexico (right before his assassination).  We empathize with Frida because she functions as such a compelling figure in the context of the story, but we are never allowed to forget that she is a flawed human being, as capable of making a mess of her life as any of the men who generally occupy the lead position in these stories.
If for no other reason, ""Frida"" is worth seeing for the marvelous sense of history it provides, chronicling the turbulent period of the 1920's and 1930's when socialism was the ""in"" cause for the art world to rally around - at least until the arrival of Stalin when the pipe dream of a worker's state and a classless society fell victim to the murderous brutality of a regime more totalitarian in nature than the one it had replaced.  Director Julie Taymor keeps the political issues of the era front and center, perfectly integrating them with the tumultuous relationship at the story's core.  We witness, for instance, Rivera's struggle with Nelson Rockefeller when the latter commissions Rivera to paint a mural in one of his buildings.  When Rockefeller, the personification of capitalism, balks at Rivera's glorification of Lenin in the painting, Rivera is forced to reexamine his own commitment to the cause he so vehemently espouses (the film makes an interesting companion piece to ""The Cradle Will Rock"" from a few years back).  We also get to see some of the lip service paid by these artists to the socialist cause, as they live the good life among the elite pampered classes, often at the expense of the very workers whose rights they so loudly proclaim in their work.
As Frida, Hayek literally carries the film.  Tender and vulnerable one moment, she can become fiery and self-confident the next.  Hayak also captures much of the excruciating physical torment that Frida was forced to endure during her lifetime - and which often became the central subject of much of her art.  Alfred Molina makes of Rivera a fascinatingly understated figure.  His seeming world-weariness camouflages a tenderness and ability to love deeply, which, apparently, few in his life - apart from Frida - were ever able to see.  Ashley Judd does a nice turn as one of Rivera's socialite devotees and Antonio Banderas makes his mark in his very brief appearance as David Siqueiros, a passionate socialist who accuses Rivera of kowtowing to the powers-that-be whom he claims to despise (Banderas is so good in the role that one regrets he isn't given more screen time).  Geoffrey Rush, unfortunately, is not given enough time or good material to make much of an impression as Trotsky.
Taymor has had mixed results integrating Frida's works into the story.  The director occasionally dabbles in surrealism by having Frida and Diego literally enter into the world of her paintings.  Sometimes it works; sometimes it serves merely as a fancy distraction.  Still, Taymor at least deserves credit for boldness in such scenes.
All in all, ""Frida"" provides a fascinating portrait of its heroine - and one of the best performances of the year to go along with it.",1039219200,12,5242,4.886133032694476

1520474,5,B00005JLPK,"FRIDA, with Salma Hayek in the title role, is a vibrant celebration of the life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo (1907-1954), and an unsparing look at her tumultuous, passionate marriage to the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina). Another major thread is the involvement of both with the Communist Party. In the latter half of the film, Geoffrey Rush makes an appearance as the exiled Leon Trotsky running from Stalin's death squads.
Hayek's performance is the finest I've seen by an actress so far in 2002. An Oscar nomination is surely in the cards. Though I understand that FRIDA uncovers nothing new about the life of Kahlo not already known by devotees of her work, the film was a total revelation for me who knew nothing about the artist. And Costuming and Make-up built on Hayek's natural appearance to create the spitting image of the real Frida (whose photo I've just seen on the Web).
Visually, the film is a riot of color. I especially liked those scenes where the viewers' eyes are drawn to a brightly costumed Frida set against surroundings colored with contrasting sepia and/or pastel tones.
My only picky-picky complaint about FRIDA is its treatment of Kahlo's physical condition after the horrific 1925 bus accident that left her with multiple fractures of her pelvis, spine, ribs and leg, and which necessitated over 30 follow-up operations in her lifetime. The visual force of her paintings is generated both by her complex emotional life as well as the terrible physical pain she constantly suffered. Yet in the film, between that time she learns to walk again without a crutch and much later when she climbs an Inca pyramid with Trotsky, there's absolutely no hint in Hayek's portrayal that the artist was in any way physically debilitated beyond an inability to bear children. Where was the stiffness of movement, or the inevitable grimaces of pain? At one point, Kahlo is shown dancing with the fluidity of perfect health. As one afflicted with yet only mild arthritis in the lower back, I found this aspect of Salma's characterization perhaps unreal.  However, this is a trivial hiccup in an otherwise superb performance.",1038528000,114,2151,4.975

1520476,5,B00005JLPK,"Julie Taymor comes back from a three-year hiatus, after ""Titus"" to direct Salma Hayek and a cast of super-stars in ""Frida."" Just to name a few: Geoffrey Rush, playing Trotsky; Antonio Banderas, playing Siqueiros; Edward Norton (also co-responsible for the screenplay), playing Nelson Rockefeller; and Ashley Judd, playing sexy photographer Tina Modotti, who plays alongside Hayek one of the most erotic scenes to be shot in quite a while: a tango dance to the song ""The Blue Room"", composed by scorer Ellieot Goldenthal and magically sung by Lila Downs. Needless to say, then, that the casting was superb.
The script was based on a book by Hayden Herrera, but the screenplay was very well accomplished (kudos to this new facet of Ed Norton!) reminding at several points of the magical realism in the movie ""Like Water For Chocolate"" -spiced up with sexy and funny moments, the core of the story always revolves around Frida's tormented life which was filled with accidents and suffering, from her bus accident in her younger years to all the pain she went through her life, both in her body and her soul (largely due to Diego Rivera's sexual adventures outside their marriage).
There are plenty of moments where the editing is simply marvelous: moving from shots of a painting seamlessly into a moving shot where Frida would be wearing the clothes of the painting. This is one peculiar and attractive feature the movie resorts to periodically to showcase some of Frida's work, while retaining the attention of the viewer and the flow of the story in a very clever way. Also the score (read my review about it) is outstanding.
The movie won't fit the tastes of people who get easily shocked with openly lesbic performances, but if you can set any prejudices to the side (which you should), you are bound to enjoy a great ride, which I am sure will put both, Taymor and Hayek, on a new level as director and actress, from here on out.",1037923200,4,1932,4.787425149700598
1520477,5,B00005JLPK,"This movie is intense, passionate and visually breathtaking. The sheer breadth of responses to Julie Taymor's beautifully presented work is indicative of the controversy (at least among gringo movie-goers) surrounding Taymor's art, Frida's life and work and Mexican history in the early twentieth century.
As an appreciater (but not an avid fan) of Frida's work, I found the movie to be a compelling introduction to Frida's life and her artistic creativity. I was initially unsure about whether Salma Hayek could pull this role off but she certainly does. Her portrayl of Frida is confident, passionate, sensual and creative. Hayek deserves enormous credit for her dramatic work in capturing all these aspects of the real Frida Kahlo and for taking on the role of producing this movie: Let's face it, when have we seen Latinas in Hollywood as anything other than gangbangers, hoochies or Mi Familia-style madres?
The emotional core of the movie: that loyalty and fidelity are not necessarily the same, is thought-provoking and slyly subversive at the same time. It's a thoroughly intelligent look at a complex subject that has not been well-explored in previous US movie offerings. One suspects that part of its lack of appeal to the mainstream lies in this one area alone. In my experience, many people prefer myth to reality in emotional situations even more than in intellectual ones.
Much has been made of Taymor's ability to create visually arresting art and this movie is chock full of wonderful examples of her ability. From manic Quay brothers cartoons to the slow motion agony of the bus wreck that cripples Frida as a girl, to the hilarious interpolations of Diego as another giant of the early 20th century atop the Empire State Building and the stunning recreations of Frida's paintings as tableaux vivants, I can only say: This film is worth ... a pop for the visuals alone. Forget Star Wars. This is a real work of art.
Visually, the movie also captures the brilliance and color of Mexico city at the turn of the century. My girlfriend used to work just around the corner from Frida's house and would go there fairly often (this was long before she -Frida- became a trendy Madonna accessory) and she says that the house and all its details (woodwork, furniture, paintings) were deadly accurate (except for some dimensional changes to the courtyard).
Complementing Hayek's performance were a truly excellent supporting cast. In particular, Alfred Molina's superb Diego Rivera, Valeria Golino's Lupe and Roger Rees as Frida's father. Molina portrays Rivera's volcanic and self-absorbed nature with grace and humor. No other male screen actor (with the exception of James Gandolfini) has come close to the convincing, compelling and contradictory range of emotions that Molina has delivered here.
Fervent anti-communist ideologues might object to the sympathetic portrayl of leftist politics and Leon Trotsky. However, it is true that Marxism was an integral part of the political scene in early 20th century Mexico. It's fashionable to sneer at the old leftists for being naive and dogmatic but they had real hope that they could change a moribund and corrupt society for the better, and Frida and Rivera were part of that movement. Personally it looks to me like they had a lot more fun with their politics than all those earnest North American and British leftists (with exceptions like Woody Guthrie of course).
Finally, whether Trotsky was murderous himself or not, he DID oppose Stalin and his concept of Revolution by Terror, for which he (along with millions of his countrymen and women) paid with his life. The large figures of history sometimes defy simplistic ""The Walton's""-style moralizing. We might ask the Japanese how they feel about Harry Truman (who desegregated the US armed forces by executive order) ordering the bombing of innocent women and children at Hiroshima and Nagasaki for example.
This is a definite must-see. If you are at all artistic or just aspire to be, this is a movie that challenges and inspires. Go see it. Go. Go.",1037923200,12,4065,5.068656716417911
1520478,5,B00005JLPK,"This is the best artist biopic I have seen, and it's a remarkable achievement for Salma Hayek, and director Julie Taymor.
Based ( with certain fictionalizations) on the excellent Hayden Herrera biography, the re-creation of Mexico in the first half of the 20th century is a marvel.
The cast is wonderful. Hayek is perfect as the petite Frida, and Alfred Molina so believable as Rivera. There are small parts filled in by Edward Norton, Ashley Judd, and Antonio Banderas, and with Geoffrey Rush as Trotsky.
I especially like the acclaimed Welsh actor, Roger Rees, as Guillermo, Frida's father, and beautiful Valeria Golino, as Rivera's ex-wife.
The soundtrack by Elliot Goldenthal (Taymor's husband) is terrific, full of traditional Mexican songs that add so much to this film.
The magnificent Lila Downs sings several songs (she is briefly seen in 3 of them), and among them is a signature song for her, ""La Llorona""...a second version of this song is sung by the legendary Costa Rican star of years gone by, Chavela Vargas, and another treat is the voice of Caetano Veloso in the final end title song.
Perhaps my favorite part of this film are the ""living paintings"". Innovative and spectacular, I think Frida would have loved this added dimension to her work. The film ends with the final words from her diary: ""I hope the exit is joyful--and I hope never to come back--Frida"".",1037664000,53,1379,4.897435897435898

Selma did an excellent job and the cinematography was breathtaking.
I can't wait to see it again and again.
I'm glad it's in English, only to reach a larger audience since Americans are so turned off from reading.
Some steamy, lesbian erotica, but tasteful.",1037664000,,299,4.555555555555555
1520480,5,B00005JLPK,"Con un magnifico libreto bajo el brazo esta pieza cinematografica se ha convertido en la obra maestra de esta industra este ao. Esta pelicula esta basada en un libro sobre la vida de la gran pintora mexicana Frida Kahlo. Se exponen temas como el accidente que casi le arrebata la vida, su promiscuidad sexual, la conmocion causada por su boda con el muralista mexicano Diego Rivera, sus experiencias lesbicas, su pintura y el calvario en el cual fue convertida su vida. Salma Hayek tiene una muy bien merecida nominacion al Premio Oscar como mejor actriz ya que con su inigualable actuacion nos hizo sentir la felicidad, el coraje y sobre todo el dolor fisico que Frida sintio durante distintas etapas de su vida. Otro punto que toca esta pelicula es la aoranza que nos deja a los espectadores mexicanos por regresar a nuestra tierra. El unico punto que yo en lo personal hubiese cambiado es que la pelicula fuera en espaol y no en ingles. Recomiendo altamente esta pelicula para todo aquel que quiera conocer un poco mas de nuestra cultura y al mismo tiempo visualizar la vida de una de las mujeres mas controversiales, famosas y talentosas de Mexico y todo el continente americano.",1037577600,5,1183,4.775609756097561
1520481,3,B00005JLPK,"I'm going to try to give the person who hasn't seen this yet what to expect without giving away the storyline. (Storyline?)
Movie traces the lives of Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera from the time the schoolgirl and friends first ogle him and his model when he comes to town, to their marriage, their divorce, their re-marriage and...it's frankly hard to tell what happens at the end, but I assumed Sra. Kahlo was near death.
Be warned, there is a lot of sex and nudity. There is also a lot of blood, and a particularly graphic scene involving an embryo. Those familiar with the career of Kahlo will not be surprised at this. Those unfamiliar may wince at all of this.
On the plus side, there are some really cool visual effects involving some puppetry and other low-tech graphics, as you might expect from The Lion King's Julie Taymor. Pay close attention to the paintings in the movie.
All in all, I personally found a visually beautiful movie which dangerously smelled of lacking a plot. Point-of-view changes constantly from narration to observation. If the unsuspecting moviegoers keep the kids at home, turn their heads during the grosser parts, and do not expect a strict biopic, I think they may find it, at the very least, interesting. It's not a feel-good movie by any stretch, but it's not totally pessimistic, either. In fact, I found myself not knowing what exactly to feel by the end of it.",1037491200,5,1400,4.695121951219512

7940302,4,B00005JLPK,"I was torn between a 4 and a 5 star rating.  Mainly because I thought the story was too dark but that is the story of Frida and there isn't much you can change on that. I do think they could have emphasized her influence more, though.  This ends up being very handy background when talking with my Latino friends. Many of them have seen the movie and enjoy discussing her and Diego. Selma deserved the Academy Award.",1526428800,,416,4.32051282051282

Beautiful Mexican old folk songs like ""La Llorona"", as sung by the stunning  voice of Mariachi singer ""Lila Downs""...and as ""old woman death"" sung by ' Chavela Vargas"" are just beyond gorgeous.
