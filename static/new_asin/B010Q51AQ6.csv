7315670,5,B010Q51AQ6,"I am relatively new to Celtic Thunder, and after purchasing several of the stage production DVDs and some of the CDs, I noticed that this Live and Unplugged video was available, so I decided to pick it up and see what it was like seeing these guys perform in a more casual, far less structured setting. Although very different from anything else I have seen them do, it was an interesting video and well worth watching.

Unlike the carefully produced, highly polished, tightly choreographed productions, this had the look and feel of a hastily organized event  even a little disorganized at times.  Fans who prefer the flawless vocals and visual composition of their stage shows may not find this very casual setting to their liking, but I found the occasional voice-breaks and technical goofs to be very charming.  Sometimes the harmonies came across louder than the melody, but that happens when performing live, and Im glad it was not adjusted in the post-production editing.  It was raw and it was real.

The worst part of the event was the lighting.  It was positively dreadful, sometimes casting a ghastly red or yellow pallor on the singers almost to the point of washing their features out completely.  There was also a lack of space on the stage, with the six singers packed so closely together that they had to be mindful of the close proximity (left-handed Ryan playing tambourine seated against right handed Keith on guitar, for example), and sometimes they actually had to get off their stools to pick up instruments or rearrange.  But this performance isn't about perfection, and they were all good sports to play such a cramped venue for a worthy cause.

To the music, its typical Celtic Thunder, although there are a few numbers I had never heard them perform before.  I haven't collected their entire library yet, so these songs may show up on some of those as I continue to add to my collection, but it was a bit of a treat to hear different things in a setting such as this.  My personal favorites on this disc were Streets of New York, the Clancy medley, and the first one, Mo Ghile Mear  including the awkward moments at the beginning when the singers were waiting for the percussion to start.  It inspired a few humorous remarks from them: Want to hear some music?  So do we! and You start, and well just join in.  I also liked seeing all the guys on the stage together throughout the entire event, and it was interesting watching them react to their fellow performers solos.

Between songs, there is some banter between the singers, including Keith Harkin embarrassing Colm Keegan, and more serious moments where they talk about why they're there and what they saw when touring the devastation left behind by Hurricane Sandy, moments which are integrated with shots of the singers touring the damage and helping with the collection of supplies for the victims.

Personally, I don't think any Celtic Thunder collection would be complete without this DVD, and I hope others will enjoy it as much as I did.",1460592000,13,3026,4.753346080305928

7315672,5,B010Q51AQ6,I love Celtic Thunder and I decided it was time to buy one of their DVDs. I decided on this one because I loved that it was a more intimate setting and it was unlike anything they had done before. The best part was that you are able to see their personalities come through and interactions with each other during the concert since they are on stage together the whole time. All the songs are great. I love it and it surpassed my expectations!,1453334400,8,442,4.273809523809524
