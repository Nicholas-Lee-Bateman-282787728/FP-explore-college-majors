1684471,5,B000062XDX,"The Harriet Vane chronicles are perhaps the finest in the Peter Whimsey series, with Gaudy Night its crown jewel. But the strength of the books, their powerful internal characterization, is the very thing that poses difficulties for the screenwriter. I dreamed of a film version, but didn't believe anyone would even attempt it. Yet here it is. BBC the Valiant brought the thing off, and they did it with style.
Harriet and Peter are perfectly cast. I was particularly impressed with Harriet in the first 20 minutes of Strong Poison. Without a word of dialogue, she held attention; it's easy to see why Peter fell, and fell hard. (And she does look superb in wine red.) Peter is the wise fool, and looks the part. I'll not give away a single moment, but ration your breath- you'll be needing it. Quiet he is, but he'll steal your soul in a pinch.
Oh, and Bunter, my Bunter.  He doth make the heart merry.
For those of you who worry about losing the complicated themes in Gaudy, do not fear, they are all present, on one level or another, and are worked wonderfully. As it's my favorite book of the trio, I do feel the need to comment on several (excusable) flaws- absences of the likes of St. George, chess set, and dog collar were felt, but necessary to the length of the piece. And important words placed in the mouths of the wrong characters were jarring, but justified in the end. Gaudy's starring theme is integrity. The BBC lets it shine.
On the whole, they are well worth the investment. As with the books, you can take them by turns for mystery, philosophy, or romance- or for a tasty blend of the three.  As your Whimsey takes you.",1022025600,21,1640,4.518518518518518
1684472,4,B000062XDX,"I have been going crazy waiting for these mysteries to come out on video.  I have been calling PBS and BBC video over the years asking about this series.
I am unbelievely trilled that they are not only out but on DVD.  I love being able to jump to my favorite scenes and to have my movies in a format that won't rapidly decay over time.
I rate this 4 out of 5 stars.  I was hoping that as an extra feature, they would include the introductions and conclusions that Vincent Price would give before and after each episode on Mystery!.  Sadly these scenes are not included.  :(
Everything else is wonderful and I look forward to enjoying many years with my DVDS.",1021593600,2,659,4.32520325203252
1684473,5,B000062XDX,"Dorothy Sayers is my favorite author of all time.  I own the Ian Carmichael DVDs, but have never seen the televised version of the Harriet Vane novels.  I regularly search my local stores in the hopes that these movies would finally be released.  Imagine my delight when I happened to click on the DVD page of amazon and saw that they were to be released in a few weeks.  Oh, happy day!
I wish I could comment on the movies themselves.  The books are amazing, and must be read.  I can, however, comment on the books.
The best of the bunch, and the best of the Whimsey series IMO, is Gaudy Night.  I'm not sure how it will translate to film, however.  GN is Harriet's story.  We see her struggling between the academic realm of emotional safety and intellectual risk, and emotional commitment, with all that entails for women at that time.  Although some of the gender debate of the book is slightly dated, it amazes me how so much still resonates today.  This is the one Sayers novel where the mystery is truly a backdrop for character introspection, and yet all the themes play off each other so well.  Beautiful, beautiful book.
As for Have His Carcasse . . . it's decent.  Not great. The mystery is a bit more meaty than some Sayers novels, so if you prefer complicated story, this is your book.  Yet the resort setting, as Whimsey observes, brings out the vulgar in our characters.  Harriet does not acquit herself well, coming off a bit shrill and unsympathetic.  And since the novel is told from her POV, it can be grating.",1020211200,7,1529,4.4855072463768115
1684474,3,B000062XDX,"Petherbridge didn't convey the essence of the ""book Wimsey"" as well as, say, Alan Rickman or Donald Sutherland (a little  younger!) might have.  E.P.'s acting seemed wooden, and a little TOO precious.  However, a welcome addition. My old tapes of the of the shows are just about fried.
I wonder if the producers of the series are aware of the prices we fans would pay for a really detailed and faithful realization of the novels.",1017619200,8,429,4.693333333333333
1684475,5,B000062XDX,"Dorothy Sayers never married although she did have an out-of-wedlock son, the result of a love affair. She never revealed the identity of the father of her child, but she finally acknowledged her son as her own toward the end of her life.
Sayers lived during the first half of the 20th Century, a difficult age for women. She was born before women had acquired the vote, and attended university before women were welcome on campus (along with Virginia Wolfe). She had a successful career as a writer, first of mysteries and later of theological tracts. Many biographers think the character of Harriet Vane, the protagonist of the three tales: STRONG POISON, HAVE HIS CARCASE, and GAUDY NIGHT was modeled on Dorothy Sayers own life, and thus the tales are semi-autobiographical.
If you haven't read these books, do so before you view the DVDs. You will probably enjoy the DVDs whether or not you read the books, but the writing is so excellent, the exchanges between Harriet and Peter are so witty and intellectual, and the sexual tension...well so tense...that you will cheat yourself if you only watch the DVDs.
Harriet meets Peter for the first time in STRONG POISON. Harriet is in prison for the murder of her fiance. But did she do it? Peter thinks not and sets out to prove it in spite of the fact Harriet does not want his help. The Peter Wimsey of STONG POISON (Edward Petherbridge??) appears at first glance to be a bigger fop than Ian Carmichal who plays Peter in all the other dramatised Wimsey tales, but the Peter in STRONG POISON is different. He exudes a powerful sexuality and is sensitive and sensual. And, yet this is a very serious mystery. A woman is in the dock, and if Peter can't save her she will be hung.
In this story (book/DVD) you learn just how badly hurt Peter was by his experiences in WWI and the role Bunter played in nursing him back to life and health. And Harriet has been badly damaged by the recent events of her life. So, it appears that in spite of the obviously strong attraction Peter feels for Harriet, they will not end up as a couple. At the end of the story, Sayers leaves you wondering if there is a future for these two people.
In HAVE HIS CARCASE (from the Latin 'Habeas Corpus' in reference to the requirement for a dead body to prove a murder has been committed), Peter and Harriet cross paths again. Harriet has taken off for a walking tour of the West Country. She feels a good long hike along the coast of Cornwall will help heal her damaged psyche. But poor Harriet is destined to fall over dead bodies and walking along the shore she stumbles on a poor sod who appears to have a slit throat. Tracks on the shore indicate he was alone, so it must be suicide. Peter turns up with Bunter when Harriet reports the murder in town, and soon the three of them are working hard to determine if the fellow on the beach was murdered or killed himself. Time and tide wait for no man, and this is an ingeneous story. It may be hard to follow if you haven't read the book, but the scenery is smashing. As with the earlier book/DVD in this triology, HAVE HIS CARCASE is filled with intelligent dialogue between Peter and Harriet, and Bunter and Peter. Peter is quite smitten with Harriet by now and he proposes, but she is not interested.
In GAUDY NIGHT, the third in the trilogy, Harriet has returned to the university she attended years earlier for a reunion with her female classmates (she was educated in the ""girls"" college at the university). The setting is Oxford--I believe Peter's school is Balliol and would you believe it, he is on the scene around the time Harriet gets together with her classmates. The highlight of Harriet's reunion is a party or ""Gaudy Night"" as it is called. Once again the viewer is advised to read the book.
Harriet's professors on the staff at her college have been receiving threats--from someone, possibly a member of their own circle? And, strange things have been happening, including a midnight burning on the Quad. The local constabulary acts as if the women are insane or imagining the whole thing. Why is that many men and even some women condem a group of women stirred up by odd happenings as ""hysterical"" when they react with fear? Some male critics have said GAUDY NIGHT is not as ""interesting"" as her earlier two novels--probably because Dorothy Sayers is making a political statement about female sufferage. I think GAUDY NIGHT may be the best of the lot.
Harriet experiences a critical event during her Gaudy Night that leads her to finally put some of the painful events from her past to rest. Peter might propose marriage again (is he beginning to sound like Mr. Darcy??)--but will the newly liberated Harriet accept? Does the path of Harriet Vane's life verge from or follow that of Dorothy Sayers? This is a great series, and one of the best Mystery Theatre ever presented. Oh yes, Peter Wimsey does have primrose colored hair and he is just as rich as Darcy--and good in the sack (or so he tells Harriet!!)",1016409600,44,5003,4.584821428571429
1684476,5,B000062XDX,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer--whoo-hoo!  I've been waiting YEARS, literally, for this to come out on video, much less DVD!!  A friend and I disagree on the Ian Carmichael vs. Edward Petherbridge issue, but I have to say that Harriet Walters is really remarkable as Harriet Vane, and Petherbridge adds a bit more ""weight"" to the character than Carmichael (whose performances I also liked).  Sayers fans will be over-joyed at the release of these shows--finally!",1015545600,7,474,5.051282051282051
1684477,5,B000062XDX,"I am unbelievably excited that this is finally to be released in DVD, or any format for that matter. This has been and probably always will be my favorite PBS series - my family has worn out two VHS taped-from-TV copies (It will be wonderful to have the picture match the sound again!)
The first two stories are reasonably faithful to the books, and although the ""Gaudy Night"" episodes are sort of a Dorothy Sayers Lite, they do make a good introduction for someone who is not familiar with the books. These episodes introduced me to Dorothy L. Sayers (my favorite author along with Jane Austen) and in that way, have greatly influenced my life.
The casting and the acting of these is perfection (thank you Edward Petherbridge, Harriet Walter, and Richard Morant!)- there is no cheekiness that bothers me about the Ian Carmichael versions of some of the other novels.
My only complaint is that they couldn't do ""Busman's Honeymoon"" for this series (someone in Hollywood wouldn't release the copyright - but have they done anything with it??? NO.)

1684485,5,B000062XDX,"Strong Poison

This is the first in a series of television movies based on Dorothy L. Sayers's famous mystery series featuring Harriet Vane and amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey.

To be can tell it the first of the program that the actors are struggling to find the characters that they play however by the end of the program they are easily identifiable. In the next mystery ""Have His Carcass"" and they run smooth from the beginning. Then in ""Gaudy Night"" they are somewhat abbreviated.

One of the strengths of the BBC production is that they do not try to dramatize so much that the story that it does not match the book. One of the advantages of this series is that it is long enough that most of the pertinent information is shown. They made an excellent choice when deciding to use Edward Petherbridge as Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Walter as Harriet Vane. They match the book character descriptions perfectly. In fact if you see this program before you read the book their images will be in your mind.

You may recognize Harriet Walter as the nasty attitude Fanny Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility (1995).

In the opening scenes we notice that Harriet is on trial for life accused of murdering her ex boyfriend. Everyone is convinced that she did it except Lord Peter Wimsey. Because he fell in love with her she just had to be innocent. As with all Dorothy Sayers mysteries the harder Peter whimsy fought to prove Harry its innocence, the tighter than use got around her neck. In the mean time Peter Wimsey proposes to Harriet.

Watch every scene and listen to every word from the beginning as this movie is peppered with clues. You will have to see the second time to recognize the clues that you missed.
-------------------------

Have His Carcass

This is the second in a series of television movies based on Dorothy L. Sayers's famous mystery series featuring Harriet Vane and amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey.
The characters are now smoother and fuller than they were in ""Strong Poison"" Which was the first in the series and had no guide to go by.

One of the advantages of this series is that it is long enough that most of the pertinent information is shown.

You may recognize Edward Petherbridge as France King Lear (1984). And many of the other character actors from The BBC Agatha Christie ""Miss Marple"" series.
In the opening scenes we notice that Harriet on holiday, recovering from being on trial for murder. She is on the beach and hears something that startles her. Realizing it is getting late she tarts down the beach and finds (you guessed it) a body. Naturally there are only two sets of footprints hers and the deceased. Once again she is mixed up in a mystery and reluctantly with the help of Lord Peter Wimsey attempts to find out if it was murder, suicide or a Bolshevik plot.

Gaudy Night

This is the third in a series of television movies based on Dorothy L. Sayers's famous mystery series featuring Harriet Vein and amateur sleuth Lord Peter Wimsey. The first two programs are ""Strong Poison"" and ""Have His Carcass.""

One of the strengths of the BBC production is that they do not try to dramatize so much that the story does not match the book. One of the advantages of this series is that it is long enough that most of the pertinent information is shown. They made an excellent choice when deciding to use Edward Petherbridge as Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Walter as Harriet Vane. They match the book character descriptions perfectly. In fact if you see this program before you read the book their images will be in your mind.

Maybe due to time restraints or different directing, many of the most interesting book characters were left out of ""Gaudy Night"" A chess board plays a significant part in the book and is also left out of this version.

Harriet is invite to her university's gaudy. She soon finds out that it is not an idle indentation. It seems that people are receiving poison pen letters and very nasty pranks. Not wanting the police to be involved they turn to Harriet (knowing of here reputation for solving crimes.) When Harriet receives a letter herself she confides in Lord Peter. Are these innocent pranks or will they lead to some thing more sinister? And who is the culprit?

I love the usual BBC production values and apparent accuracy of the time period, costumes, sets, etc. I re-watch these at least once a year. (As I re-read the Sayers ouevre annually - she's my favorite Golden Age mystery author.)

My one complaint is that the BBC puts out a pretty chintzy spread, in terms of pleasing fans. For one thing, it's annoying that if you use the ""Play All"" setting, you have to sit through the drawn-out opening and closing credits and music between every episode, you can't FF to just get the hell on with the next episode.

1684576,5,B000062XDX,"Ian Carmichael was, by his own admission, too old to play Lord Peter Wimsey, World War I veteran and amateur sleuth.
Despite that, Carmichael managed to make the character created by Dorothy Sayers memorable: He had the right accent, the right attitude, and he looked more than merely comfortable in the trappings of the times.
Thus, when Edward Petherbridge was chosen to play Wimsey in the second series of television adaptations of Sayers' mystery novels I confess to some apprehension because I had thoroughly enjoyed Carmichael's performances.
My fears were extinguished, however, watching him play the part of Lord Peter with as much skill - though not as much panache - as Carmichael. In many ways, I think, Petherbridge's portrayal was more on point than Carmichael's. For example: In the novels Wimsey suffers from what we would now call Post Traumatic Delayed Stress and Petherbridge manages to convey the uneasiness that those with PTSD feel a good share of the time. He also, I think, looks more the part than Carmichael did: Tall, thin, slightly rumpled on occasion, and a little awkward; Petherbridge's version of Wimsey is an appealing character.
Paired with him in this delightful series is Harriet Walter, who plays Harriet Vane, a mystery writer and the love of Lord Peter's life. Walter does a remarkable job as the intelligent, somewhat acerbic writer who captures Wimsey's heart while she is on trial for murdering a former lover. Not beautiful in the strictest sense of the word, she is strikingly attractive and Wimsey falls completely under her spell while trying to clear her of the charges laid against her. Walter, the niece of acting legend Sir Christopher Lee, brings her own flair to the three mysteries contained in this boxed set as she tries - without much success - to convince Wimsey to ""just go away.""
The three mysteries stray somewhat from the novels but that's not an issue for me. The strong performances and the excellent pace of these three episodes in Wimsey's life make for wonderful viewing.
I can only think that Sayers would approve.",1428192000,7,2080,4.9798850574712645

I enjoyed the films, and think Edward Petherbridge was almost perfect in the role of Lord Peter Whimsey (too short) but there is a lot of the story that is left out, making it seem incomplete.

I want to LIVE in Wimsey's townhouse.  And I do like Petherbridge - when he's supposed to look haggard, he's haggard.  (I do get distracted by his suits - they are gorgeous.)

To my knowledge, this is the best video or film adaptation of her incomparable books about Lord Peter WImsey and is comprised of the three main books (""Strong Poison,"" ""Have His Carcase,"" and ""Gaudy Night"") describing Peter's courtship of Harriet Vane. I loved Edward Petherbridge as Peter, although he borders on being a bit old to play Peter, but he's truly excellent. The series incorporates quite a bit of original book dialogue, which helps its authenticity, and its settings are outstanding. My only criticism is that the screenplay for the third of the adaptions, the one of ""Gaudy Night"", is abruptly truncated, as though the producers ran out of time or money to finish it properly. To be fair, ""Gaudy Night"" is the lengthiest and most complex of the books, but several plot lines are abruptly severed in order to end ""Gaudy Night"" prematurely, which is very disappointing.

Harriet Wallace makes a charming Harriet Vane and I can understand why Ian Carmichael might have been a ""little long in the tooth"" to play the love interest to a young Harriet Vane.
In any case, I would highly recommend both as I truly enjoyed these series and they hold up well even given they were made in the 1970's.

I've read and reread the Lord Peter Wimsey mysteries countless times and was delighted to find the casting in the adaptations (except perhaps for Bunter) perfectly compatible with my mental images.  ""Strong Poison"" is marvelous. The plot has been slightly cut, but very little changed from the written work.  In ""Have His Carcase"" the cutting is much more severe but does not seriously pervert the plot or the characters therein.  But ""Gaudy Night"" is so hacked and distorted that the plot becomes senseless even with very fine performances by the cast.  No wonder poor Padgett seems perpetually bewildered and Lord Peter more weary than in love.  This dreadful adaptation is puzzling because it was done by the same person who did ""Strong Poison"".

1684818,5,B000062XDX,"My first reaction was that this series seemed on the gloomy side, rather frustrating and drab.  But then it's supposed to be around 1930 and in England, complete with rainy days and fog.  So you come to celebrate the gloomth.  Lord Wimsey is no dashing superhero.  He's a skinny, middle-aged, not particularly handsome guy, but extremely cerebral.  In short, something of a nerd.  You come to like him in all his frustrations as he copes with his irrational crush on Harriet Vane.  For all his intellect and logic, not to mention his social standing, it's love at first sight.

He must save her from the gallows in ""Strong Poison,"" where she is accused of poisoning her lover because (get this) he wanted to marry her!  But he was supposed to be a free spirit who didn't approve of marriage at all, so she feels he was a fraud.  Is that a motive for murder?  Well, the prosecutors thought so.  And she did procure some rat poison prior to his demise, to research how easy it is to do so for a book she's writing.  Wimsey even manages to get a stooge on the jury to stop the wheels of injustice and save her.  Afterwards, Harriet promptly dumps him and walks out of the courthouse a free woman.  The last note in the theme music is rather sad.  Poor Wimsey.

""Have His Carcass"" is a prolonged case taking place at the shore at the Resplendent Hotel.  Harriet takes a walking tour to forget her traumatic murder trial and write her next book.  There are gigolos, merry widows, hired dancers and rural types, all mingled together -- and a dead body about to be washed out to sea.  Just what Harriet needed, another dead body.  Lord Wimsey grabs onto another opportunity to save her from prosecution.  She's as much resentful as grateful.  The last note of the theme music is, again, rather sad.  What's a guy to do?

""Gaudy Night"" brings Harriet back to her alma mater.  Her classmates and former teachers have followed her doings with proprietary interest in the newspapers, and now find her something of a celebrity.  Some find her behavior rather scandalous and do not approve.  The school is beset with nasty pranks that are getting worse by the day, and nobody knows why.  They ask Harriet to use her murder mystery skills to investigate, and she tries, but doesn't come up with much more than a big bump on her head.  So she calls in Lord Wimsey.  He's quite busy with the Foreign Office, but he squeezes her in and solves the puzzle.  The last note of the theme music is, at last, very sweet.  A nice touch.

This is a series that gets better after you watch it a few times.  Lots of interesting characters, screwy and otherwise, who become familiar and seem quite real.  You come to like them.",1360108800,3,2698,4.50206611570248

While the actor for Lord Peter looks like his description, he is really goopy - though  the writers are not to be blamed for moving Strong Poison from winter to summer (much more visually appealing), they totally unnecessarily change Dorothy L Sayers writing of the conversations between Lord Peter and Harriet from witty to romantic drivel, depriving the viewer and eliminating the dignity of the characters.  I agree with the other reviews on the poor characterization of Bunter.  Gaudy Night in the hands of BBC becomes a different story entirely than what DLS wrote.

How they could have cast that Carmichael fellow as Lord Peter is beyond me. Edward Petherbridge, to me, is the quintessential Lord Peter: suave, debonaire, and charming. If you have read the books, Carmichael fits the description of Lord Peter's brother.

Harriet Walter is also excellent as Harriet Vane.

1684851,5,B000062XDX,"This set was recommended to me by my Amazon purchase history, probably because I order so many BBC-produced DVDs.  I knew this series was in existence, and although I first immersed myself in the Wimsey mysteries about 20 years ago, I always avoided it.  I inadvertently saw a portion of part of the OTHER series, and that Wimsey was just awful (Ian Carmichael?  can't remember).  So of course I wanted nothing to do with this.  However, being felled from time to time by a severe neuromuscular pain disorder, requiring far too much bed rest, I decided to watch 'Strong Poison' on YouTube, on a day when reading was not possible.  The first time through, I was prickly and ready to be annoyed (just like Harriet, I may add!).  But by the time I got through 'Gaudy Night', I was sold.  The adaptations must necessarily take liberties with text, and I agree wholeHEARTedly that Bunter is grossly miscast.  BUT...he has minimal screen time, and I really grew to care about Peter and Harriet. And what is more, Edward Petherbridge makes me feel his yearning, his disappointment and hurt, his breadth of knowledge and sophistication, and as I watch I believe in his love for Harriet entirely.  And Harriet Walter also finds the right tone, not quite there, but absolutely believable.  So that in 'Gaudy Night', I find myself really only yearning for the subtle eroticism of the punt scene, the wonderful interplay between Harriet and St. George, the dog collar, and the suggestion of Peter twisting it over and over in the infirmary the night of Harriet's attack.  I find I can reconcile myself to the many omissions, not only because covering the entire novel would have been impossible, but because I believe in the fundamental relationship as it evolves between Peter and Harriet.  I wish the kiss at the end had been more prolonged and passionate, too...but on days when bed rest is the only solution, and reading is difficult, this series is enough to take me out of myself.  And that's what a good dramatization is about, after all!  My hugest regret is that this team was unable to film 'Busman's Honeymoon'.  So for those who do not know Peter and Harriet through Dorothy L. Sayer's excellent novels (get them, read them!), and for those who do, I find myself highly recommending this series.  Of course, if you are a hide-bound fan, you might want to do as I did, and watch the series on YouTube first.",1325980800,17,2406,4.717703349282297

  3.  Bunter (who isn't even in this book)  is horribly mis-cast -- he is no well-bred valet; he's a cockney who took a wrong turn on his way to do the Lambeth Walk in the west end.
  4.  The guilty party (OK, we read the book, we know who it is)  has a couple of scenes, that, as written, take her whole story away,  and, actually, make it not possible to have the same outcome.  But, yet,  we have the same outcome.

1684869,3,B000062XDX,"Dorothy L. Sayers (1893-1957) wrote relatively few novels, but their quality was sufficient to rank her among the best mystery novelists of her era, and she remains a standard bearer to this day. In the novel STRONG POISON, her detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, fell in love with mystery novelist Harriet Vane, and Sayers allowed the relationship to play out over the course of three more works: HAVE HIS CARCASE, GAUDY NIGHT, and BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON. In the 1987, the BBC filmed the first three titles (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer owns the rights to BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON, which was filmed in 1940) as a mixture of 1930s mystery and romance. Starring Edward Petherbridge as Lord Peter, Harriet Walter as Harriet Vane, and Richard Morant as Lord Peter's manservant Bunter.  The result, unfortunately, is very mixed.

This is due in some part to the novels themselves.  Sayers was a distinctly literary writer, and many of her effects simply do not transfer to the screen.  Part of the problem is in the casting.  Petherbridge, Walter, and Morant are expert performers, but the first two seem more serviceable than ideal, and Morant is wildly miscast.  Oddly, there seems little sexual tension between Petherbridge and Walter; still more oddly, there seems aplenty between Lord Peter and Bunter.  But the really great failing of the series is that not single episde of any title manages to capture Sayers wicked, wicked sense of humor, a sharpness that drives her narratives with tremendous speed and wit.

The best of three titles is STRONG POISON, in which Lord Peter falls in love with Harriet Vane, who has been accused of murdering her lover with arsenic.  The great difficulty involved in adapting this particular novel to film is the amount of backstory involved, but the screenplay very wisely presents most of this as narrated flashback--just like the novel--and avoids the temptation to fiddle too much with Sayers narrative.  Thanks to Lord Peter's assistance, the charge against Harriet is withdrawn; she, however, does not return his love and instead goes on a seaside walking tour.  The result is the second title in the series: HAVE HIS CARCASE, in which Harriet finds a body on a beach.  This is actually one of Sayers more problematic novels, beset with everything from train schedules to tides to concealed identities.  In novel form, Sayers sense of humor carried it off; in film, however, it is merely confusing and gimmicky.  With this adventure past, Harriet is summoned to her Oxford college to investigate a poison pen letter writer whose nastiness has throw both students and faculty into disarray.  GAUDY NIGHT is easily one of the two or three best things Sayers wrote.  It is also hard to imagine anything more unfilmable.

STRONG POISON is presented in three episodes; HAVE HIS CARCASE in four (with its emphasis on train schedules, tides, and what not it needs that extra hour); and GAUDY NIGHT in three.  Although filmed in the late 1980s, the cinematography is unfortunately early 1970s in quality and has therefore dated rather badly.  Fans of Sayers novels will enjoy the series, but it may go over the heads of those who haven't read them.

Cat Among the Pigeons was one of my favorite Christie's, and the recent version was ridiculous.  There was a much better version years ago and I cannot locate it.
I don't know why PBS cannot seem to realize that there is a vast audience for (Masterpiece) Mystery! Is there no real vision by the Powers That Be?
Better than nothing, but it's a mystery to me why we get shortcut versions. They need to be two hours in length in order to do justice to the great works. They will say, of course, money...but I think other genres are simply favored by the decision makers.",1247788800,2,1234,4.734883720930233

1684899,5,B000062XDX,"Yes, yet another review is to add to the glut in the market but I do exercise my right to cheer on the team that made this series. All three show the mark of a high degree of professionalism in television technique, all three are most enjoyable. To some degree, I found Gaudy Night special due to the characterization of the faculty and some of the students of an experiment in British elite education, an Oxford college for women staffed by faculty women. While there was no time allowed for elaborate characterizations, the script and the actresses made the most of the time they had to draw an interesting portrait.
Two more general comments: when one makes a film, TV play or stage production one is bound by the demands of these media and not of the book from which one may be drawing. Reading material and viewing material are vastly different in inherent qualities; to expect a television play to be true to a book is to set an unreal goal which should not be met. No better example can be offered than what Hitchcock did with John Buchan's classic adventure story, The 39 Steps. Make the comparison yourself. Both are still living documents. I feel the same with regard to different productions relating to the same characters. There is no way to try to make an Ian Carmichael production without Ian Carmichael. Happily, the two leads here were not asked to duplicate past performances of Lord Peter or Harriet Vane. (Among others were Haunted Honeymoon (U.S. title) with Robert Montgomery and Constance Cummings which I liked because Robert Montgomery could do no wrong in my book but, apparently, and with justice, Sayers could not stand it.)

1684957,5,B000062XDX,"One of the best literary romances I have ever read concerns Lord Peter Wimsey's turmoiled courtship of the mystery writer, Harriet Vane. In four gripping books written and set in contemporary 1930s, the aristocratic amateur sleuth meets, woos, is repeatedly rejected, but at last wins over the very independent-minded Harriet, who, in every way, is a match for our monocle slinging detective. Along the way, amidst their witty banter and intellectual discourses, they manage to solve several refined murder mysteries. DOROTHY L. SAYERS MYSTERIES (Featuring Lord Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane) collects the three great BBC television adaptations STRONG POISON, HAVE HIS CARCASE, and GAUDY NIGHT, which all came out in 1987. It's lamentable that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Busman-s-Honeymoon/dp/0061043516/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Busman's Honeymoon</a>, which chronicles the Wimseys' wedding and most unusual honeymoon, was never made available for a BBC dramatization.

STRONG POISON is presented in three segments and runs about 150 minutes. As Lord Peter Wimsey peruses the newspaper, he glimpses a photo of mystery author Harriet Vane and is instantly smitten with her striking face, which he finds ""damned attractive."" However, the photo is linked to an article chronicling the ongoing trial of Ms. Vane, who is accused of having poisoned her free-thinking lover. Lord Peter adamantly declares Harriet's innocence and sets about proving it. He also manages to get a face to face with the suspect and, there and then, proposes to her. With Harriet one step away from the gallows, Lord Peter must rely not only on his wits but on the assistance of his capable butler and two resourceful women from the L.P.W. Bureau, the Secretarial and Typing Agency. STRONG POISON is the slowest of the three adaptations but does serve to introduce Harriet Vane into Peter's life. Plus, we get to see Peter very briefly play hopscotch.

The four-part HAVE HIS CARCASE (around 200 minutes long) picks up sometime after the events of STRONG POISON. Harriet Vane, now cleared of murder and desiring nothing more than solitude, throws herself into a walking tour of the English coast, where she promptly stumbles onto a corpse. When she gives the scoop to a London newspaper (to rather ghoulishly promote her new book), Lord Peter finds out and off he goes traipsing over to help with the case and to again ask Harriet to marry him. He and Harriet end up solving a murder mystery, but Harriet again says no to his marriage proposal. In my opinion, HAVE HIS CARCASE is the best adaptation of the lot.

Then comes the three-part GAUDY NIGHT (""gaudy"" meaning, in this instance, an annual university dinner or feast; this one runs around 150 minutes). Harriet returns to her old Oxford haunts for a college reunion and succumbs to her old professors' plea for help. Accordingly, she's called upon to use her insight and skills as a mystery writer to root out the identity of the ""poisoned pen"", the prankster seemingly bent on sabotaging the reputation of Harriet's old college by writing obscene and terrifying letters. But things take a turn for the worse when the culprit escalates to vandalization and physical assaults. As Harriet goes into her sleuthing, she also finds herself struggling with her conflicted feelings for Peter. You know, even with the unrelenting if justified focus on the prunish and debate-jonesing academic ladies, I got caught up in the doings. Not only does GAUDY NIGHT strongly focus on Harriet as she investigates by her lonesome, but it also gives us the resolution to the Peter-Harriet soap opera. One wishes, though, that more of the episodes dealt with the Peter-Harriet romance.

See, never underestimate the value of a romantic foil. Lord Peter's life irrevocably changed with the entrance of the willful and sometimes caustic Harriet Vane. As a Sayers reader, while I've certainly enjoyed her Lord Peter exploits sans Ms. Vane, I've always savored more the books with the both of 'em together and exchanging in stimulating and sometimes daffy conversations. What can I say, it's the romantic sap in me. Even if the high-falutin', multisyllabic, now pretty obscure references they drop tend to leave me with an inferiority complex. But never mind. Even with their usage of scary big words, Peter and Harriet still equated to heady romance.

The mysteries themselves, sketched out in well-mannered drawing room sensibilities, will puzzle. The most perplexing one lies in HAVE HIS CARCASE, which depends muchly on timing and alibis and ciphers. The television episodes unfold events in a gradual and leisurely pace and, as a byproduct, will steep the viewer into the British culture of the '30s. Just remember, these may be the most heinous of skullduggeries, but when the investigator is blueblooded, well, certain proprieties must be observed. Thus, there are plenty of cultured exposition and polite manners going around. Peter, in his going about and looking into, proves to be all-around perceptive, someone capable of dealing with both nobility and the commons of the earth.

The acting is consummate, about what you'd expect from the Brits. I'd never heard of Edward Petherbridge before, but he improves on Ian Carmichael, who portrayed Peter in several 1970s television mini-series. Petherbridge embodies Lord Peter Wimsey in all ways, not only from a physical similarity but to his wonderful blending of brains, melancholy, brittleness, nervous energy, and just a dash of studied foppishness. But as Harriet's college warden opines, when it comes to Lord Peter, ""That practiced air of inanity he's pleased to adopt conceals a sharp intellect."" Anyways, Petherbridge's performance could not better be. Harriet Walter as Harriet Vane complements him very well. I expected her voice to be somehow richer, as befits the strong minded Harriet Vane (so I had thought), but Walter's voice grew on me. She isn't classically lovely, but her long face is compelling and, yes, attractive. She imbues her character with enough willfulness, an intelligent spark, and no small amount of spunk. Gosh, she put Peter thru the wringer in several scenes. Not to forget Richard Morant, who is marvelously reserved but at times cheeky as Lord Peter's faithful and fabulously multi-skilled manservant, Mervyn Bunter. Everyone else is darn excellent, but I've got to give props to the culprit in GAUDY NIGHT, who makes a riveting impassioned speech during the denouement.

God, I wish there'd been a screen adaptation of BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON. Maybe, someday. For those wishing to follow up on the adventures of the Wimsey family in book form, Ms. Sayers has written the short stories: ""The Haunted Policeman"" and ""Talboys"" (both can be found in the short story collection&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-Peter-The-Complete-Lord-Peter-Wimsey-Stories/dp/0060913800/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord Peter : The Complete Lord Peter Wimsey Stories</a>). Sayers also had an unfinished manuscript titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thrones-Dominations-A-Lord-Peter-Wimsey-Mystery/dp/0312968302/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thrones, Dominations (A Lord Peter Wimsey Mystery)</a>, which was meant to be the next Lord Peter/Harriet Vane book. This was finished in 1998 by English author Jill Paton Walsh, who then wrote&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Presumption-of-Death/dp/031299138X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Presumption of Death</a>, which is based on ""The Wimsey Papers,"" fictional letters written by the Wimseys which Dorothy L. Sayers had contributed to the The Spectator magazine during WW2.

As a matter of fact, the actors made the characters more sympathetic than they sometimes seem in the novels.

Edward Petherbridge stars as Lord Peter this time and introduces you to Harriet Vane, with whom Lord Peter falls madly in love.

Mr. Petherbridge plays Lord Peter very differently than Ian Carmichael but then in reading the novels Lord Peter does change after he fall for Harriet Vane.

1684965,5,B000062XDX,"I like both Lord Peter actors, Ian Carmichael puts the ""whimsy"" in Lord Peter Wimsey but Edward Petherbridge puts the 'Lord Peter' into his portrayal. Petherbridge reminds the reader that the character is fragile and was seriously shell-shocked during WWI and still suffers delayed stress syndrome -his meeting with Harriet Vane is painful and he is desperate to save her while keeping his arm's distance like a gentleman -at her request. Watching the tortured role played, one can't help thinking that his gentlemanly distance is kept more at his insecurity about his emotional stability. He is strong but is the strength his title and wealth? I think anyone who has read and loved her books will enjoy the intellectual challenge Petherbridge delivers. On another note, Dorothy L. Sayers married Arthur Fleming in 1926, contrary to another reviewer's claim that she never married. For a more complete bio: [...]",1138924800,73,912,5.168918918918919
1684966,3,B000062XDX,"Given the warm approval for this series felt by other Amazon reviewers, this review will stick out as a bit contrarian--especially in answering the mystery readers' ""Bond question"":  which actor does it best?  I am all for Ian Carmichael and, having just watched his 1970s series back-to-back with the Petherbridge one, can easily state what I think are the flaws of the latter.

Both series effectively reproduce the 1920s for us, but the difference in their approach is apparent from the start, with the theme music:  the Petherbridge series has a slow, somewhat romantic but melancholy tune, while the Carmichael one is jaunty and uplifting.  Petherbridge himself is, in my opinion, overly earnest and seems dour rather than properly serious or high-minded.  He lacks the charm, wit, and sense of humor of the Carmichael portrayal--which of course is partly the fault of the writers, who fail to give him good material to work with.  On the other hand, Petherbridge has some responsibililty for that:  he never smiles if he can get away with not smiling, looks as if he has a bad smell under his nose most of the time, and rushes through his supposedly humorous lines, as if he doesn't know how to handle them or doesn't think they're humorous.  Maybe he's right, but it all makes Wimsey seem rather a prig and a bore, which is the antithesis of the Carmichael portrayal.  Above all, Carmichael's Wimsey has a radiant heart, and that's not much in evidence in this series, either in the Wimsey character or in his beloved, Miss Vane.

I am not acquainted with the Vane character from Sayers's work, but Harriet Walters seems well cast.  But again--and whether this stems from Sayers or not, I don't know--she is not permitted to be sufficiently charming.  One begins to think, watching her gracelessly dismiss Wimsey time and again, that he must be a bit of a masochist.  When he finally says, in what passes for an outburst, that he wishes she could ""dissemble"" sometimes, one cannot help but heartily agree with him.  The last thing she says to him in the series just made my jaw drop with its inappropriateness.

Similarly, the Wimsey-Bunter master-manservant relationship is not enjoyable to watch.  Richard Morant is fine as Bunter, but Petherbridge gives him a wet-fish handshake in return and makes Bunter seem the better man.  Oh dear.  The Bunter-Wimsey relationship of the earlier series is much more a partnership in which one sees a genuine bond.

If you are a Sayers fan, I would still recommend these programs, despite these distracting drawbacks.  They are somewhat slow-paced but they are certainly atmospheric, and each one is set in a quite different milieu, with lots of interesting characters throughout.  But do also view the Carmichael series.",1138579200,18,2768,4.93304535637149

Richard Morant, who plays the faithful Bunter, gives a low-key performance which perfectly conveys the valet's fierce dedication to his employer.

1684988,5,B000062XDX,"As a male with a major distaste of the teeny-bopper tripe of modern TV and movies this is THE best sophisticated romantic movie ever produced.
Harriet Vane is self contained modern woman (and this was written in the 1920s and 30s) who is accused of murdering her 'partner' -as we would euphemistically call him today. Dorothy Sayers didn't 'beat around the bush' it was Vane's ""lover"" who was murdered!
Wimsey is besotted but Vane is NOT going to rush into his arms despite thinking how easy it would be.
The Gaudy Night episode does a sterling job at trying to create the atmosphere and intellectual dilemma of Harriet Vane in Sayer's original book (I thought they should have made two episodes of this). Here was a modern feminist discussing the issues of today's young women who have worked through the anti-intellectual diatribes of the 'bib and brace' set of the 1970s.

Many of the other reviewers say that Petherbridge is superior to Carmichael because the latter's version of Wimsey was too foppish -- I think they need to reread their Sayers.  Wimsey's often described as, at least on the surface, a ""silly-ass about town"".  He is intended to come across as foppish and yet be so much more; I've always felt that if Carmichael had been younger when he'd done the part he would have been perfect.  Petherbridge needed to lighten up some to truly capture the sparkle necessary to carry the role for me.  Also, while I expected Harriet to be a little darker in tone than her lord, she ought to have an irrepressible underlying spark and I felt that could have been better portrayed.  All in all, still very worth the watch.  I think the perfect Wimsey video series has yet to be created and I look forward to seeing it eventually materialize.",1070496000,8,947,4.568047337278107

1684992,5,B000062XDX,"Edward Petherbridge is brilliant!!
I recently acquired these DVD's (Strong Poison/Have His Carcass/Gaudy Night) and they are now my most treasured set. The performances by Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walter are flawless!
This series is a MUST HAVE for all mystery buffs (especially Dorothy Sayer's fans!) For those who were disappointed in the Ian Carmichael series produced 10 years earlier, take heart--you have now found the answer to your prayers!
My only criticism is that there were no more titles produced in this series. I can't understand why they did not continue to make more of these wonderful productions. And furthermore, I can't understand why the BBC took so long to release this series onto Video/DVD. If I had known of the existance of this series sooner, I would have launched a campaign to demand that they make more episodes. Oh well...I guess we will just have to make do with the three gems that were made. (In fact you should probably buy two sets of these, as you may wear out your original DVD's from watching them over and over and over and ...ahem...oh yes back to the review...)
The first two films, Strong Poison and Have His Carcass, are faithful to the books and each is truly a pleasure to watch. The third, Gaudy Night (or ""Gaudy Lite"" as I have seen it referred to) skimps a bit in comparison to the novel. However, the extraordinary acting on the part of Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walter more than makes up for this, ensuring that this version of Gaudy Night is a highly entertaining one. This series should have segued into ""Busman's Honeymoon."" However BBC dropped the ball on obtaining the rites and left us all hanging.
Perhaps it isn't too late for a continuation of this series after all. It has ONLY been 16 years since the last episode. Surely if Ian Carmichael could have the audacity to play Lord Peter Wimsey at his age, Edward Petherbridge could pull it off for at least another 20 years or so (and do it brilliantly I might add!)
Needless to say, I have become an instant fan of Mr. Petherbridge and can only hope I may find more of his work on film. (This is a daunting task since this distinguished stage performer seems to shy away from the camera. Something about acting for the love of the thing and not the money. Oh these serious actors!! By the way, isn't he WAY OVERDUE for some sort of Knighthood or something ...hmm??!!)
WARNING: Ordinary television will seem even more unsatisfactory after viewing these DVD's.
As I said before, you'd better get at least two copies of each of these DVD's (or to be on the safe side, you'd better make it three!!)
(NOTE: It seems that the UK version of the DVD's contain an interview with Edward Petherbridge as a bonus feature. Unfortunately for me, the American version does not. You lucky Brits!!)

Although Ian Carmichal is a great British actor, I found his performace lacking.  On the other hand, Edward Petherbridge brings a light humor that was evident in the books and more expression as well as rounding out the character with personality.  Harriet Walter, Richard Morant and David Quilter round out the cast with wonderful chemistry.
As Jeremy Brett has become the quintessential Sherlock Holmes to modern Holmes afficiandos, so has Mr. Petherbridge become, for me, the quintessential Lord Peter Whimsey.  My one regret is that they didn't film the other works with Mr. Petherbridge as Lord Peter.  They would have been fun to watch and I would definitely have added them to my collection.  What's funny is that my mother and I have disimilar tastes in films.  I will have to get another copy of this dvd set, because she has stolen them from me.

1684994,5,B000062XDX,"How wonderful that BBC has released this delightful trio on DVD. As a longtime Sayers fan -- and particularly of the Peter/Harriet books -- I dropped everything to absorb this series' first airing in 1987. Edward Petherbridge is so nearly a perfect Peter (just a bit too old; if only they'd shot these 10 years before with him instead of Ian Carmichael, Sayers enthusiasts all over the globe would have rejoiced). Harriet Walter's Harriet Vane is a bit less satisfying -- she gets Harriet's intelligence and wit quite well, but lacks some of the gravitas and intensity that comes across in the book -- as well as the lovely, deep voice that I keep wanting to hear (Emma Thompson comes to mind).
But physical quibbles aside, these films do get the developing relationship between Harriet and Peter -- the cautious probing of emotions hampered by nervous reserve on his part and defensiveness on hers.
Another strong plus is the casting of the supporting characters in each story. Each is wonderfully realized by the BBC ""stable"" of fine actors. The settings and period details are also dead on.
My only real disappointment in the set is the truncating of ""Gaudy Night"". Admittedly, this is the most complex of all Sayers' books. The numerous subplots, while perhaps seeming irrelevant to the casual reader, are actually an intricate counterpoint of encounters and relationships, each of which provides a vital piece to one of the two puzzles to be solved in this novel: how Harriet and Peter will resolve their personal dilemma or (much less important) who is sending obscene poison pen letters to the Shrewsbury College community. Unfortunately, the screenplay for this film version of ""Gaudy Night"" leaves out many of the subplots not relating to the mystery. Without the richness of detail provided by these subplots, we're left with a mildly interesting mystery and a love story that is far shallower than it should have been. I have to agree with the reviewer who called this film ""Gaudy Lite.""
That having been said, I still recommend this set for both longtime Sayers readers and those new to her. If this is your first venture into the lives of Peter and Harriet, enjoy these films and THEN run, don't walk, to acquire/read the books. For those like me who can quote long passages of Sayers books verbatim, I'd say get these anyway. I can almost guarantee you'll enjoy them ... even if you have to use your imagination to fill in the blanks left in ""Gaudy Night"".
I still hope that the BBC -- or someone of similar caliber -- will do another remake of these that remedies the few deficiencies noted above ... and which also includes Busman's Honeymoon!",1046649600,61,2659,4.820568927789934

Since I saw it first at age 13, this remarkable series sparked my interest in reading all of Sayers' books AND in learning about Sayers herself (a brilliant woman).  I *was* slightly concerned, after all these years and pouring through Sayers' books, that memory had elevated the quality of these productions, but thankfully memory served me well.  Although he's a splendid actor, I can't say that Ian Carmichael was a very convincing Wimsey.  A middle-aged Bertie Wooster, perhaps, but Wimsey - no, Lord Peter needed to be darker and pained, because he had something that mattered. finally.  Lovely Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walters perfectly and touchingly portrayed Sayers' beloved characters, and though I had forgotten who played Bunter, Richard ""Captain Zep"" Morant also did a splendid job.  These programmes were beautifully filmed, and although they butchered ""Gaudy Night"" quite a lot (ou' est St George? And the chess set?  And the rest of the punting scene? And the famous proposal.....well I suppose the general audience doesn't know what ""Placetne, magistra?"" means...I had to look it up myself.  So i won't fault them for that. ), they captured (necessarily) the essence of Sayers' wit. The little details on facial expressions (and Peter clipping out Harriet's picture) were especially touching.  Cheers to the fine performances of the late Charmian ""Mrs Councillor Nugent"" May and fellow ""Keeping Up Appearances"" alumna Judy  Cornwell: also pleasant surprises.  Kudos, also, to the frequent (and, I hope, clever) Guinness cameos.  As you may or may not know, Sayers was the genius behind the slogan, ""Guinness is Good For You.""  My personal recommendation?  Drink a pint of Guinness, read Sayers's books, and watch this lovely series.  It was well-worth the decade-long wait, and performances and casting Sayers (a drama junkie) would have been thrilled to witness.",1043884800,13,1952,5.251612903225807

Petherbridge's Wimsey is more languid and calm than Carmichael's.  I can't make up my mind which is the better portrayal, as both actors are superb.  Harriet Vane is also excellent.  She is on trial for her life in the first DVD, Strong Poison, and at the center of other crime investigations in Have His Carcase and Gaudy Night.  She is clearly Lord Peter's equal in intellect and temperament and her agonizing over whether to accept his repeated proposals makes for a fine romantic sub story.",1042156800,4,812,4.926470588235294

I've been searching for this series for years and sending whining notes to BBC and PBS asking why the PBS Dorothy Sayers series with Edward Petherbridge hadn't been released and urging them to do so ASAP.  Edward Petherbridge performs the part of Lord Peter in just the way I had imagined it from reading the books.  ...,1033430400,5,365,4.671875
1685000,4,B000062XDX,"This is the boxed set of three of the four mystery novels Dorothy Sayers wrote about her sleuth, Lord Peter Whimsey, and Harriet Vane, the mystery writer who eventually became his wife.  These are the DVD's of the BBC productions of ""Strong Poison,"" ""Have His Carcase,"" and ""Gaudy Night,"" starring Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walter.  Unfortunately, the BBC was unable to obtain permission to produce the final novel, ""Busman's Honeymoon,"" much to our loss.
I have already written reviews of the individual performances separately, and will focus here on matters that affect the entire set.  For reference, these performances cover the period from Wimsey's successful efforts to free Harriet from suspicions of murdering her lover to Peter's proposal to her at Oxford several years later.
Both of the stars of this series do remarkable work.  Petherbridge is almost too perfect for the role, and has managed completely to supplant my own imagined version of Lord Peter completely.  My only quibble is that he seems more a man in his fifties rather than the forties I thought was Wimsey's age.  Since I am in my fifties myself, I found this quite easy to forgive.  As for Walter's depiction of Harriet Vane, she really is exactly as she should be.  Richard Morant's approach to Bunter, Lord Peter's man, is more problematic, being well acted, but not quite in character.  As far as the lesser characters, the casting is, for the most part, impeccable.  The few exceptions to this rule are still more than acceptable.
What makes the novels unique for their time is that Sayers wrote them are not simply as mystery stories with a romantic aspect.  Instead, Harriet Vane is in almost every way Lord Peter's match, a strong, intelligent, and independent woman who balks at marriage first because she does not wish to succumb to gratitude, and latterly because she does not with for her own depth of character to be subsumed under Lord Peter's.  This dilemma is used by the author not simply to entertain, but to expand on the role of women in post World War I Britain.  And here lies my major complaint about an otherwise delightful set of entertainments.
For whatever reason, the director (Christopher Hodson) decided to overemphasize the romance at the cost of other elements.  In the case of ""Strong Poison"" and ""Have His Carcase,"" this sin only extended to the modification of the endings to create a certain romantic suspense.  In ""Gaudy Night,"" unfortunately, Hodson made significant changes from the novel, and left out several elements as well.  The result of this 'Hollywoodizing' is that the less familiar one is with the novels, the more enjoyable the performances are.  If you are a long time Sayers fan, though, you may find yourself slightly dissatisfied.  Purist that I am, I have rated the set at four stars rather than the five that it otherwise richly deserves.",1026518400,134,2878,4.935684647302905

I was happy to get them on DVD since I was afraid my old taped VHS copies were nearly worn out.  I wonder if anyone else has noticed some discrepancies between the sound and video tracks--or is it something to do with my DVD player?
I also miss the intros by Vincent Price and the interviews with Edward Petherbridge that preceded and followed the Mystery! broadcasts.  Oh, well, can't have everything.
These are well worth the money for D. L. Sayers fans.  The production values are beautiful, and the supporting performances are every bit as good as the two leads.  One of my favorite sequences is the one in Strong Poison where Miss Climpson dabbles in the paranormal to save the day.  (I hadn't realized that the poor gullible nurse was none other than Judy Cornwell, aka Daisy from Keeping Up Appearances!)
I, too, was disappointed that the series wasn't completed with Busman's Honeymoon.  Understand they wanted to do it, but since it had been a stage play, there was a problem with getting the rights.",1024272000,8,1113,4.706185567010309
1685002,4,B000062XDX,"I first watched these over 10 years ago on PBS and fell in love with the characters of Peter Wimsey and Harriet Vane. I remember waiting eagerly for them to rebroadcast the series over the LONG intervening years, and unlike many savy viewers I hadn't taped it. So imagine my anticipation when I realized these were available on DVD. Whoo-hoo!!
To tide me over I read the books and I was never disappointed. Sayers is a masterful writer period, and an excellent mystery writer as well. Her books, especially the Wimsey/Vane novels rank among my all-time favorites. I've reread them countless times and they never pale, and if possible only get better.
With this history in mind I have to say that I was slightly let down by the DVDs. I like to think that I hadn't idolized them out of proportion, i.e. my memory had made them better than they seemed. My conclusion is that when I first saw this series I hadn't read the books, and now having read the books, seeing them again I have to acknowledge that the books are simply far superior. Don't misunderstand, Have His Carcass and to a greater extent Gaudy Night, strike me as being difficult to adapt for TV, so I am not entirely blaming the producers, and I think Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walter ARE Peter and Harriet. It is just that I was so looking forward to seeing Wimsey riding the horse down to the beach in Have His Carcass and instead I got Bunter (or rather a stunt double). I definately felt that Gaudy Night was short-changed. Huge swathes of story were chopped out and what remained was stitched back together rather badly. Where was St. George? The wonderful Ivory chessman? The pivotal punt ride that was included but in such a butchered fashion?
Of the books I liked from least to most: Strong Poison, Have His Carcass, Gaudy Night. From the tv series I liked least to most: Gaudy Night, Have His Carcass, Strong Poison and so I can only deduce that the more faithful the adaption from the book, the better I enjoyed the series. Still, I think these are far superior to the Ian Carmichael adaptations which I have never particularly cared for, and as a whole I think these are wonderful, if only because they bring my favorite characters to life. But if you haven't read the books you ought to because all the things you love about Peter and Harriet are included twenty-fold in the novels. Overall I'm still feeling a little let-down but ultimately happy since I now can enjoy both the books and the DVDs whenever I want.",1023840000,15,2494,4.58165548098434

I must congratulate BBC/Warner Home Video for the splendid job of transferring the DVD's--one never knows what to expect from DVD's, and this set looks fabulous.
All three adaptations are great, but my only nit-pick would be that ""Gaudy Night"" could have been expanded one more hour to include more material from the book.  If you've not read the books, and like this series, you'll like these adaptations anyway, even after reading the books!
Petherbridge makes a very convincing Lord Peter--much more believeable than Ian Carmichael in these adaptations featuring the marvelous Harriet Walter as Harriet Vane.  I can't see Carmichael as a love interest, but Petherbridge is the quintessential Lord Peter--witty (he does talk ""piffle"" rather well!), charming, brilliant, and vulnerable underneath the surface.  One of my favorite scenes is where Harriet tries to send Lord Peter away, during a prison visit in ""Strong Poison""--the pain and hurt that he is feeling is expressed so well in his face, with a minimum of gestures that it brings tears to your eyes.  The interaction of Petherbridge and Walter is very convincing, and they relate so well to each other. It's a treat to see them together.
And, Richard Morant as Bunter, although perhaps a bit young for the part, does a great job as well.  He's a perfect foil for Lord Peter, with just the right amount of sarcasm at just the right times, and the ability to do a bit of sleuthing on his own when needed.

There are two principal reasons why I find these adaptations unappetizing: much of Sayer's dialogue and scene details have been jettisoned (the opening scene of Strong Poison comes to mind; a scene that adds little more than an opportunity for a scriptwriter to make a clever witticism).
The addition of the nude model to the Sylvia Marriot scene in the same video seemed gratuitous and unecessary: it added nothing to the characterizations already being portrayed.
Peter's appearance at the end of the trial dramatically changes the dynamic between the two characters of Peter and Harriet.
In short, the flavour of the period was retained, but NOT the details of the fictional characters.
Finally, I found Petherbridge unappealing as Peter; he lacks the insouciant charm of the textural Peter that Ian Carmichael captured so well (even though Petherbridge is a far better look for the character).  Petherbridge seems to dwell in a perpetual angst.  He's just not FUN, darn it.
If you have never read the actual text, the mysteries are acceptable, though not stunning; if you have read them, you may find these adaptations VERY far removed from the books.",1022630400,17,1342,5.013452914798206

In addition to the wonderous portrayals by Edward Petherbridge and Harriet Walter, these episodes show an extremely careful attention to period that is very interesting. The very first shot is a closeup of a gas light on a London street that shows the gas mechanism in detail. The same attention to detail pervades the episodes, giving us a feeling for what people ate, wore, and how they lived in London of the 20s. My apologies to fans of Ian Carmichael (the other Lord Peter), but I think Edward Petherbridge does an incredible job at conveying the intelligence yet vulnerability of Lord Peter who went through very bad times in the War. He is a much more appealing Peter Wimsey.

Have some other Dorothy Sayers mystery shows that I really enjoy.  Expected this series to be up to those shows....just seems slow, the acting stilted or restricted.  If you can get the series cheap or see them before you buy, I would recommend it.  I probably wouldnt bother buying this set if I had seen it before I bought it.",1518566400,,480,4.3977272727272725

7957775,5,B000062XDX,"Terrific Sayers.  As I have long been a fan of Ian Carmichael's Lord Peter, I was skeptical, but Petheridge brings a new slant, one which is also compelling and authentic.  The chemistry between him and Harriet Vane is perfect.  Gaudy Night benefits from the necessary editing for film.. the book is way too long.  A treat for Sayers fans!",1507075200,,339,4.694915254237288
