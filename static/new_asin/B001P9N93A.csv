I went in expecting to be entertained by little monsters, the smallest monster was like cat sized? Really? Cats? I've seen cats before. So you'd think, if they can't get the little monsters right they could possible do big monsters justice huh? NOPE, the biggest monster was at best big boned, not even large. I've seen bigger monsters rolling around on the electric carts at Walmart.

The animation was passable for like 1920's computer generated graphics but this is 2012, you think these guys could afford a Lisa or maybe a Commodore PET computer by now.

If you're looking for little or big monsters, look elsewhere.",1335139200,4,804,4.728571428571429
