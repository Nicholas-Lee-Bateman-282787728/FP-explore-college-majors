6824785,4,B00PWDAG4K,A bit slow but a pretty accurate view of pro sm relationships and public play.,1436486400,2,78,4.266666666666667

6824787,3,B00PWDAG4K,"Psychological aspects are well placed, well acted.... Succumbing to undiscovered neediness is hard watched. And this was yet to be resolved. The movie was split on two points: Do I want to be an S&M film or do I want to have a psychological exploration of these two characters.",1432944000,,277,4.673469387755102
6824788,4,B00PWDAG4K,"The IMDB score was around 5.5.  I almost passed until reading the reviews.  Very glad to have seen this film.  First of this genre that I found intellectual, well crafted and just enough stimulating.",1432339200,,199,4.794117647058823
6824789,4,B00PWDAG4K,"This was a very unusual movie for its genre. S&M is often misunderstood and the depiction of it's violence is often shown to the extreme (note the Saw movies). To see something like this, that is serious,  realistic and well acted is a revelation. Although a little slow moving for me it held my interest throughout. Anyone interested in the S&M scene would enjoy watching this movie, especially since it is not deragotory or demeaning in any way to the characters or how it is expressed.

Those looking for something that is unique and independent in nature should also find this movie well acted,  interesting and informative.",1279411200,7,628,4.850467289719626
6824790,5,B00PWDAG4K,"Truth is hard.  And, this movie is just that.  Here is a man who becomes bewitched by a dominant.  Perhaps, in its self, not that unusual.  However, the performaces are dazzling in this little jem.  Here we see a therapist (with a troubled childhood, surprising?) take a hard fall for someone who cannot maintain a connection. He is married with an understanding wife. Yet, we see not from her perspective.  The playful couple are drawn together with its predictable difficulties.  I suppose this an allegory for so many (without the usual complexities of income, children, etc.) Personally, I knew before I saw how this would work itself out--we used to call this tragedy--in the best, and ancient, sense of that word.",1238803200,7,719,4.892561983471074
6824791,4,B00PWDAG4K,"I don't think this can be consdered as a true pornographic film as much as a porrayal of the type of person involved in this kind of kinky sex.  It also appears to be a look at the division between fantasy and reality. The male character here is paying for a fantasy that somehow fulfils him but one which he wants to bring into his real world.  The woman on the other hand is a professional, fulfilling his fantasy but only as a fantasy. The love in this is on the male's side. It's not truly returned and that makes this a truly poignant film. I have the feeling that those really into this sex style won't find this a true turn-on, but for those who have a curiosity will find it definitely of interest.",1234483200,12,706,4.222222222222222
6824792,4,B00PWDAG4K,"Some of the more squeamish reviewers would lead you to believe that the best thing about ""Going Under"" is Roger Rees' physique.  And yes, he's in great shape - but please, let's delve more seriously - there's a thoughtful and lovely story here.

Both of the main characters are engaging and likable, but they carry deep and unresolved hurts. They are gentle, good people searching for a way to heal themselves, or at least a way make it through each day with their un-exorcized pain. But the film doesn't wallow in boring angst - these are proactive people. Their journey together may be doomed from the start, but it was a good journey for each of them to undertake, and it takes them a step closer to the healing each craves.

It's not really about the sex, and I think people who come to the film looking for a sex-thrill aren't going to get what they came for. And the people looking for a sensitive human drama might not choose it in the first place, thinking it would not deliver on that level. But it does. Actually, both characters are fully dressed and being themselves (to the extent they can) in the film's sexiest scene.

People have criticized the ending, but I found it realistic, and more to the point, fully satisfying, if bittersweet. (If you've seen ""The Ebony Tower"" you may note some parallels.)

It may be very hard to generalize how this film will affect people. If you're the kind that can't get past some of the subject matter (or if that's all you came for) you'll miss the forest for the trees. And it's a forest very worth seeing. I thought of the old quote, roughly translated as: ""I am human, so nothing human is alien to me."" Remember to bring your empathy with you to this film, and you'll be able to explore a beautiful forest.",1183939200,41,1759,4.484375

8689523,5,B00PWDAG4K,I loved it. It didn't end the way I thought would but that just made me appreciate this story even more. Two lost souls reaching out in the one way the know how for the intimacy they need. Beautiful character study. If you looking for a dark gritty story based on D/s this is it.,1465862400,,279,4.090909090909091

8689526,4,B00PWDAG4K,"SPOILERS, kinda:
This is a thought provoking movie.  Without giving anything or spoiling your viewing pleasure, I enjoy watching the characters evolve.  In the beginning of the film. the slow pace allows for this blossoming.  Whatever my prejudices may have been about SM and domatinating  lifestyles were challenged as the movie played on.  I lost some interest in the film about 58 minutes in, but, I was captivated by the denial from both people.  As I watched the film, I thought, which character did I believe I could identify the most with?  I was surprised as to who that was.  The female has many deep emotional issues, but the male role drove the necessity for her to come to  a reality of the issues.  She still suppressed them. Watch this if you like be entertained by male and female relationship dynamics. The SM is a character on it's own, individually.  Interesting to note that a sex fetish is a co star in the film.  What we think bonds these two together being the SM actually shapes the mood and reaction between the male and female lead.  I could cast a person as the SM action between the people.  It could be replaced with  the birth of a new baby and the attention whether it be positive or negative, draws them together or apart. The drama between the two comes to ahead when they interact outside of their professional relationship.  The actions were required to fully explain our lead's motives. If you are watching this for SM eroticism the scenes are sparse, but if you are watching this film to understand the necessity of SM, then this movie is for you.",1449100800,,1583,4.6
