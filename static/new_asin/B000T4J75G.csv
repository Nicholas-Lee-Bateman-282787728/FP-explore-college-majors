8207722,1,B000T4J75G,"I really enjoyed Kelly Rowland's new album,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ms-Kelly/dp/B000QEIM5U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ms. Kelly</a>. Although it has a few flaws, is in need of a few more up-tempos and the songs wouldn't suffer from a new sequencing... the album is still a great breakthrough album that truly distinguishes Kelly Rowland as a solo artist. If you would like to read my full review for the album, you may follow the link or look at my other reviews. This review is for the two-pack that came with a BET Offical DVD.

I bought this edition, along with the special edition on the day it came out. I was very excited that it came with a DVD. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Kelly is very eloquent and well-spoken. Her personality truly shines through in the interviews included. There are quite a few music videos and live performanceson here, too. She evens sings a bit of ""This Is Love"" on the acapella tip on the spot! It was beautiful. The DVD was great and I'm glad I got it.
