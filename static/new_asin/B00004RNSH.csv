I saw it in french, without subtitles and it is an incredibly emotional film, I was captivated by the visuals and the music. I would love to see it released on a wider scale",1222473600,5,248,3.8823529411764706
7921791,4,B00004RNSH,"The end of the French presence in Indochina, a beautiful adventure, great destinies. The last days of Din Bin Phu. Epic scenes. The impression of chaos very well rendered by Pierre Schoendoerffer who lived this battle, in 1954, camera in hand.

The film makes a fair tribute to soldiers who have sacrificed for the honor, the lieutenants and captains who were the actors in this battle, isolated as described so well Erwan Bergot ""The 170 days of Dien Bien Ph and Jean-Pierre Bernier ""Dien Bien Phu."" Tribute to this great warrior that was Bigeard. A film of great emotions.",1216080000,5,574,4.797979797979798
7921792,4,B00004RNSH,"An artistic portrayal of the 1954 decisive battle at Dien Bien Phu in Vietnam that led to the surrender of French forces and France's withdrawal.  An American journalist (Donald Pleasance) in Hanoi is the vicarious observer for movie viewers as he watches army acquaintances depart for battle and covers events via government and military liaisons.  The atmosphere is surreal as life in Hanoi remains somewhat peaceful while French and Vietminh forces wage a brutal battle in the remote Lai Chau province of Vietnam.

This 1992 production is remarkable for its on-location filming in Vietnam and the battle scenes filmed not far from the actual location.  The cinematography is beautiful from the sights and sounds of Hanoi to the French paratroopers, Legionnaires, and soldiers fighting under miserable conditions in Dien Bien Phu.  Remotely akin to Lions Gate's Hamburger Hill (1987), Dien Bien Phu is operatic in portraying the historic battle.  There are majestic sequences of parachute assaults and infantry attacks, and the dismal atmosphere is portrayed with vivid realism as the battle grounds down to the French surrender.

At the time of this writing, the available DVD edition is Region 2 only and there are no English subtitles.  Imagery and sound are very good.",1159056000,13,1274,5.241379310344827
