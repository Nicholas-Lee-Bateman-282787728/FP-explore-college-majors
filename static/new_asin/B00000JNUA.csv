7912998,1,B00000JNUA,Had to give one star or couldn't write review. Tape was broken when arrived and unwatchable. Terrible condition of VHS. So i do not know how good or bad this movie was because tape was UNWATCHABLE,1433462400,,196,4.472222222222222
7912999,4,B00000JNUA,"While it is a bit formulaic, it is one of the better movies of its type in that it at least tries to have a storyline.

The acting is okay but nothing special.",1373068800,,159,3.8181818181818183
7913000,5,B00000JNUA,"My expectations for this movie were good after I watched it with some of my friends. They all loved the story and the entertainment was the best. This movie is a good lesson for all you guys out there working late in the office that some bets may cost them more then they bargained for. A friendly tip, some young, beautiful, and attractive secretaries are not just a pretty face if you know what I mean. Watch out for them!!!",1323648000,,426,4.3375
7913001,5,B00000JNUA,"what can i say, i am simply a fan of Catalina Larranaga.  i own most of her movies. from vhs, vcds to dvds.  if she was still doing movies, i would still be buying them.",1205366400,,169,3.8
7913002,2,B00000JNUA,"I had high hopes for this movie for several reasons. First and foremost, the fact that it was produced by Mystique, who has put out some of the hottest softcore out there. Second, the cast. Tracy Smith, Catalina Larranaga, Susan Featherly-that is a superstar line-up as far as I'm concerned. Three of my all-time favorite girls. I'm set. I could really care less about the plot at this point. Now all they have to do is deliver the heat...and that is where this movie fails.

First, the plot. Daisy (Tracy Smith) is an uptight receptionist, newly hired to a photography company. The guys in the office are a bunch of chauvinists of the highest order, so they enlist Orlando (Jarod Carey), who Daisy has a crush on, to break her heart on a bet. Needless to say, Daisy eventually learns the truth and takes it upon herself to teach the guys a lesson. If you like your softcore more plot-oriented and dialogue driven, then this may be for you. In between the dialogue, you get a series of sex scenes, and only a couple of them are note-worthy.

Now the sex...or lack thereof. In fact, there are very few actual sex scenes in this movie. Susan Featherly is naked on a bed at the beginning of the movie, then never to be seen nude again. Catalina has 2 scenes, one a halfway decent b/g in a copy room, and a fairly hot g/g with the lovely Tracy. Tracy has the majority of the scenes, but most of them are either disappointing or frustrating. Her first sex scene comes via a daydream where she and Orlando (Carey) get it on Egyptian style, but that is cut off as soon as it starts to get interesting.

Tracy has another scene with Orlando that AGAIN gets cut off before anything really happens! When they finally do get together, it better have been worth the wait, right? Wrong. Slow, and boring is the only thing on the menu unfortunately. In fact the only scene that really delivers any heat is when Tracy tries out a new vibrator. She finally shows us the goods, and you'll wonder why the rest of the movie couldn't be like that.

There are other scenes with nudity, but only one other sex scene, and none of them are even worth mentioning. Blah is the only word that comes to mind. Beautiful girls, big budget, decent script (kudos to Ms. Larranaga for punching up some tolerable dialogue), but all of that means bupkus to a softcore movie if they can't deliver the passionate sex scenes.

With all the potential there, it must have taken a real concentrated effort to screw the pooch this badly. Not at all what I expected from the folks at Mystique.",1134172800,2,2550,4.475268817204301

7913004,5,B00000JNUA,"Nice story.  Good casting.  Impressive acting.  Lovely, sexy ladies to look at.  What more could you ask for?  Well, of course, I was expecting more action from the leading ladies.  From past exposures, they had more than satisfied my needs, but this time, they were kind of ""laid back"" so to speak.  The ""extras"" furnished most of the exciting action, and it was great.  It's just that I had anticipated watching the leading ladies do ""their stuff"" and there just wasn't enough action from them to satisfy my needs, this time.

I must say though, this is a nice CLASSY production, enjoyable to watch.  Just a little TOO nice for a dirty old man like myself.  [:-(",1122422400,7,664,4.589743589743589
7913005,1,B00000JNUA,"Uninspired dreck. I'm a fan of Playboy's Eros Collection, but this offering was weak. The girls of course are hot, but the sex is mechanical: The girls strip, fondle briefly, and dive below. I may be wrong here, but  passion doesn't have to be below the waist. How about some deep kissing?  Next to the Seventh Sense, this was Eros' weakest offering. If you want to  watch a decent Eros flick, rent/buy Allyson is Watching, or The Night that  Never Happenend. Pass on this one.",951523200,3,477,4.576470588235294
