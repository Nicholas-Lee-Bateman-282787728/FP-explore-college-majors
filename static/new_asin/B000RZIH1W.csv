8203273,5,B000RZIH1W,"This film could be used as a primer for those who really know nothing about WWII; yet it is also helpful for those, like me, who have immersed themselves in the history and pathos of that era.  I highly recommend it as an addition to your WWII film library.

Clearly and pleasantly narrated by Liam Dale, it touches on major battles and even some of the history untouched by some more in-depth documentaries, such as the phony war, breaking the Enigma code, and even a reference to the situation of the Channel Islands.  Then it ends with a discussion of postwar adjustments.

As I said, I recommend this to all those interested in WWII history  from the beginner on.",1448582400,,667,4.571428571428571
