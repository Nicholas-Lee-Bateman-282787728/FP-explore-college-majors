8433929,5,B004L8ML2M,All my grandkids from 2 - 6 years old and their parents love Scooby-Doo,1442361600,,71,4.142857142857143
8433930,4,B004L8ML2M,It's a great buy because to get them separately it cost 3 times s much,1438473600,,70,3.7333333333333334
8433931,5,B004L8ML2M,Really nice option to get some great episodes from the different series with some of the more memorable culprits.  I remember some of the older episodes from watching it in reruns.  Nice to see them again and be able to share the Scooby-Doo love with new generations.,1383782400,,267,4.659574468085107
8433932,5,B004L8ML2M,"Wait for this to go on sale here at Amazon before purchasing. I paid $15.00 for this at a popular retail store. We got rid of our cable, and the free ""Mystery Inc."" episodes (the most recent incarnation of the gang) that were on the Cartoon Network website can only be viewed if you have cable (you might be able to catch them in two minute shorts that add up to one episode, but it is very annoying to do so). With a $10.00 price tag at the retail store for the ""Mystery Inc."" volumes with four episodes, I felt that this was the best value- you are getting the above mentioned show in four episodes, plus four episodes each of the middle school and old school Scooby cartoons. The scoop on Scoob:

Quality of all the shows are great. The best part- no forced commercials! You can go straight to the menu, smiling happily.  Languages: English, Spanish, French, and Scoobese (just kiddin' on that last one). Subtitles: same languages.

""Scooby Doo Where Are You?"" Episodes (Old school, first four of Season One):
-""What a Night for a Night"". Villain: the Black Knight.
-""Hassle in the Castle""; phantom of Vasquez Castle.
-""A Clue for Scooby Doo""; ghost of Captain Cutler.
-""Mine Your Own Business""; the Miner 49'er.

Bonus episode of ""Shaggy and Scooby Doo Get a Clue!"" (""Shags to Riches""). Copyright 2006. Pass on this- no ghost, no monsters, no ascots, no great legs, no losing of glasses. Two spy types chase Shag and Scoob around a mansion; the rest of the gang made a quick, lackluster appearance at the end. Shag's voice is in true munchkin form, and his total green shirt is apparently in the wash (he is wearing a cream-colored shirt with a green stripe). Anathema!

""What's New Scooby Doo?"" Episodes (Middle school, first four of Season One):
-""There's No Creature Like Snow Creature""; snow creature (of course).
-""Space Ape at the Cape""; alien.
-""3-D Struction""; dino spirit.
-""Big Scare in the Big Easy""; ghosts of Jeb and Caleb Leland.

Bonuses: two ""music videos"" (just O.K.; compilation of cartoon images), hangin' out with ""Simple Plan"" for a few, how to draw Scoob and the gang (sped up film of someone drawing; no lesson at all), and a lame game.

Cool factor: The band Simple Plan does the light punk theme song for this show.

""Scooby Doo! Mystery Inc."" (New school, first four of Season One):
-""Beware the Beast from Below""; slime mutant.
-""The Creeping Creatures""; gator people (half gator, half person).
-""Secret of the Ghost Rig""; ghost trucker.
-""Revenge of the Man Crab""; giant crab.

No bonuses with this show.
Warning: There is love between Fred and Daphne, as well as between Shag and Velm, so if you are a Scooby purist, do not watch.

Summary: Great value, great intro to the world of Scooby, great memories, great spookiness, great to keep kids in check.",1321574400,3,2785,4.688524590163935
8433933,5,B004L8ML2M,"This was pretty good, and I like how you got more bonus features than you bargained for. The DVDs were in really good condition, and worked perfectly.",1318550400,,150,4.592592592592593
