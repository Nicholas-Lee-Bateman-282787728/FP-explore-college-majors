8484216,3,B005REIMT0,"Interesting tale of a gamble in debt to other gamblers for his former partner's debts, devising a plan to win the money by getting a really fast horse that is really cheap because no one can ride him.  He knows a jockey who has been striped of his license and is down in Mexico that is rumored to be able to ride any horse.  The jockey is a jerk, but they get him a license under his kid brother's name and put up with his shenanigans to win the race.  Ladd is perfect for the slick talking Salty O'Rourke and William Demarest as his grumbling sidekick.  The 22 year old jockey is pretending to be 17 so he has to go to school until the race.  His beautiful teacher is Gail Russell, who has eyes on Salty.  Interesting story and worth a watch.",1421971200,,743,4.160839160839161
