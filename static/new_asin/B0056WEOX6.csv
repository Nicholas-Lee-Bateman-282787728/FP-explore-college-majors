8459932,5,B0056WEOX6,"This is a romance movie adapted from a Nora Roberts novel, This Magic Moment.  The 1989 Harlequin Romance movie portrays the efforts an American magician, Troy Gardner, to win the heart of his English television producer, Melanie James. The film starred John Shea as Troy Gardner and Jenny Seagrove as Melanie James, Troy Gardner's television producer. Paul Freeman had the role of Troy's rival, Brian Swann.

This is certainly fluffy romance and paved the way for Hallmark and Lifetime romance movies.

Film quality is what I'd expect from a made for TV movie from the 80s, originally available on VHS and then converted to DVD.",1366761600,,629,4.9714285714285715
