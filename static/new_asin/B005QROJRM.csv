8483717,5,B005QROJRM,"who else would name his horse pussy ...one of a series of 4 hugely popular  whirlwind spaghetti westerns and keep in mind there were over 500 euro westerns filmed back in there hay day 60's into the 70's and almost all with English tracks ...awesome soundtrack and photography ....unique fish out of water story with an almost entirely Japanese cast except for Tony Anthony as the stranger travels to Japan in search of ""gold"" ...what else...
Also there were a total of 4 official ""stranger' films ..including  A Stranger in Town  and a possible 5th tie-in which also by the way revived the interest in 3D with polarized lenses during the early 80's ..Comin At Ya..one of my favorites and has been released on DVD with 3d glasses..",1378512000,2,731,4.6953125
8483718,3,B005QROJRM,"I ordered this video in hopes it would be better than the one I recorded years ago from satellite. I recorded the first two, Stranger in Town, and The Stranger Returns, from a satellite channel uninterrupted and in widescreen, and they were great. The Silent Stranger, or Stranger in Japan,  was not on the list. However it was shown at a later date on a different channel, complete and in full frame, with commercials, by MGM. Again the quality was great, and I removed the commercials.  I give this a 3, because it it better than nothing at all, and in widescreen. The quality is not up to my recordings. If I was to watch it again, I would watch my own. The Sinister disc is a -R and I would say it was recorded to a Panasonic DMR-E85 machine like mine or very similar. If I thought they would take it back, I would return it. The titles are in Italian, so it is the European version an not the one from MGM. It is in English except for the Japanese.
Still a good movie and has comedy throughout.
Well worth the money if you have nothing else.",1367971200,2,1046,4.251256281407035
