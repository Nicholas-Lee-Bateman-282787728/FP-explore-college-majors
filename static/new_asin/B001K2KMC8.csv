8314112,4,B001K2KMC8,"As a preface, I will mention that before we saw ""Darwin's Secret Notebooks"", we already knew ""Darwin's Dangerous Idea"", a documentary/reenactment that is an excellent balance between introducing Darwin within the context of his tremendous scientific significance, and the twists his life story takes by way of the reenactment. That dvd is a well-rounded presentation for both as an introduction for the initiate who knew little of the details of his work and an entertaining summary for someone who is already familiar with the topics involved (social darwinism, natural selection, etc.)

""Darwin's Secret Notebooks"" delivers just what the title promises, and more. When I saw the title I assumed it would focus on one portion of his life's work, i.e. the period and thought process before he fully formulated his theory of evolution. It fills that particular niche but also gives an excellent account of Darwin's overall travels.  I do not think that by not calling things by a given name (social darwinism, God, what have you) means the documentary is not thorough. At many points in the dvd God is not named in the narration but is referred to as ""the almighty"", ""the being who created everything"", etc. but one cannot accuse it of not having contemplated the impact that the theory of evolution was about to have on religion, just because it did not say ""God"" at every turn. I do not believe that every movie or book on him necessarily has to list all the details of his private life, so long as the work is not advertising that it is attempting to do so.  Being a trained biologist--and my mother-in-law as well, a well-published marine biologist--I find this dvd beautifully made. It is gripping enough to keep our attention for repeated viewings, with more to come, while presented in a context general enough that our budding biologist (my son) can appreciate. We are riveted by the dvd. I'm giving it four stars because I wish it were longer.",1268352000,6,1951,4.870481927710843
