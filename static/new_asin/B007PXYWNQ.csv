5104412,3,B007PXYWNQ,"Not a clear copy. Maybe because it is an older movie.  In fact it took us sometime to find out ""where is Sam Elliott""?  Most of the time you get what you pay for and this is the case here.",1369353600,2,188,3.675
5104413,5,B007PXYWNQ,Have always been a fan of James Whitmore and Sam Elliott. This was a very good story about Chief Joseph,1365379200,2,103,4.2
5104414,5,B007PXYWNQ,"This movie is about the Nez Pierce Indian tribe and their desire to just be left alone on land that white man mostly still has not settled, and is also now a national park.  Washington at that time was used to dealing with the more warlike tribes that actively were raiding settlers and travelers.  The Nez Pierce was a peaceful tribe that was willing to coexist with the new settlers coming into the area.  This movie while containing dramatizations, did a nice job of telling a very sad story of an Army general that did his duty even when he knew Washington was wrong, and an Indian chief that was educated in the schools back east, and knew what the eventual end was going to be.",1365379200,8,683,4.404761904761905

5104416,4,B007PXYWNQ,"Bought this movie for my historian son as a gift and it's one of his older favorites even though the script writer didn't include some of the more interesting facts about Chief Joseph's story. Still, even though it's been ""Hollywood-ized,"" it's a very enjoyable film for a history graduate student who loves a good story (plus he's a Sam Elliot fan). Recommended to anyone who likes American history. But do a little reading about Chief Joseph to fill in the real details.",1358035200,10,472,4.7682926829268295
5104417,4,B007PXYWNQ,"I bought this movie primarily because I'm a big Sam Elliott fan and have interest in this particular subject.  I was pleasantly surprised at the fairly accurate depiction of events leading up to and during the pursuit.  This 'reader's Digest' version doesn't do justice to the deception by the US to the Nez Perce and the cruelty of the civiians and soldiers as they slaughtered their way through these people.  None the less I highly recommend it to persons interested in this subject.

If you want to know more I recommend the book 'Chief Joseph and the Flight of the Nez Perce' by Kent Nerburn. Many of the events depicted in the movie require background to understand and 90 minutes is not enough time to cover everything.",1353715200,80,726,4.692913385826771

5104488,4,B007PXYWNQ,The quality of this film is dated. However still very viewable. I thought the actors did a good job of representing the historical events of Chief Joseph and the US Army. I believe the accuracy is as close as the history books have revealed and Hollywood making the film entertaining and yet understanding. I am a fan of the historical events of that time frame. I have traveled the lands where these events took place.

5104504,5,B007PXYWNQ,"The story of the Nez Perce tribe is told in this story using the words of Chief Joseph, himself: ""....from where the sun now stands, I Will Fight No More, Forever!""  It is the Emmy nominated tale of the struggle of the Nez Perce during their final break for freedom and the conflict with U.S. Army troops, led by General Oliver O.Howard, beautifully portrayed by James Whitmore.  Ned Romero portrays the proud, greatly respected and much admired Chief Joseph in this accurate depiction of the tribe's final months.  in 1877, President Grant has opened the beautiful Wallowa Valley in Oregon and Idaho to white settlers and continued conflicts with the white man, broken promises, broken treaties have led to a stand-off between Joseph and his good ""friend"" General Oliver. Here we watch the Chiefs and elders as they agonize over the decision to escape the directive and decree by the government to present themselves to the Lapwai reservation for a life they are not at all prepared to live!  We see the 1700 mile, final trek of the Indians as they make their way toward our northern borders with Canada in order to escape never ending persecution and forced reservation living...which is considered to be their ultimate humiliation and defeat!  Sam Elliott portrays Captain Wood, Oliver's understanding, sympathetic adjutant, but it is the General, who has the utmost respect and love for Chief Joseph, who must track, find and bring the great Chief and his people in. As the weeks go by we see a once proud people reduced to fear and resignation through sickness, hunger, exhaustion, death and despair.  The buffalo is scarce, the winter all too severe and the road they must take in order to escape their enemy, all but too treacherous to survive. On the eve of their final push into Canada, the Nez Perce are outnumbered, out-gunned, trapped and defeated.  There is nothing left but surrender.  This is a sad, yet important chapter in our history and one, whose ultimate teachings, that should never be lost.",1428710400,,2013,4.882697947214076

5104506,5,B007PXYWNQ,"The historical accuracy of this movie is almost unmatched in western movies. I did several years of research in this location related to Native American documentary and salmonid historical distribution. Except for the box cover (the backside of the box has far better and more to the point detail) inaccuracies I would say that there is not a single disappointment in this movie. It is actually well acted. All of the Indian actors are Native American. As a Native American myself (Mohawk) and having interviewed many western natives I would note that the male part of the cast were mostly non-Nez Perce. This observation agrees with the credits provided. Sam Elliot's part is really wonderful! James Whitmore's role is also remarkable! Ned Romero's role as Chief Joseph is idealistic and splendid and certainly a little off the actual Chief Joseph looks. Chief Joseph is one of the most quoted Native American's in our USA history. Frankly I think this movie should be played in high school and college classes in terms of it's historical value but that specifically is not OK. It should be recommended though by educators, and by those who love western movies. I read the bad acting immediately beginning the movie with some the question that facial expressions and all that seems to be easy to complain about. the opening scenes Golden Eagle capture is pretty remarkable. The presentation of the map showing the amazingly difficult route was necessary and accurate. Every battle was well depicted. The Native American horses were so well presented that it was AMAZING. I bought an Appaloosa horse after being out there and he was the best horse I ever road or owned. Do not miss owning this movie!",1427760000,21,1700,4.926829268292683

It would have been more appropriate to have James Whitmore on the cover, but then I doubt if the dvd would have sold at all. We almost didn't recognize Sam because he looked so young. The movie was long, dragged out, and even boring in several parts, unlike another early Sam Elliott dvd (The Quick and the Dead) which we enjoyed very much.

5104558,4,B007PXYWNQ,"""I Will Fight No More Forever"" is an overlooked Western from 1975, possibly because it was made-for-TV. Despite this, it's actually better than a lot of theatrically released Westerns from the same period or, at least, just as good.

THE PLOT: When gold is discovered on the ancestral lands of the Nez Perce (in the NE corner of Oregon and border of Idaho) their treaty is broken to allow settlers to move into their lands, which results in conflict. The US Army seeks to subjugate the tribe of 800 and relocate them to a reservation, but Chief Joseph  Native name: Hinmatowyalahtq'it  resists, winning 18 engagements against the Army with only a little over a hundred warriors. These engagements include four major battles and four fiercely contested skirmishes. The Nez Perce War lasted four months and involved a 1200-mile chase. Joseph and his tribe ultimately sought refuge in Canada. Will they make it? See the movie.

Being a TV movie from 1975 I was expecting to be let down; I was anticipating white actors playing Natives and a roll-your-eyes tone, but this isn't the case at all. The main Indian characters are played by Native Americans of various tribes; even Ned Romero, who plays Chief Joseph, is Chitimacha Native American (as well as French/Spanish). The ending of the film lists the Native actors and their tribal ancestry.

As for the tone, although you can't expect ""Dances With Wolves"" quality in a TV Western from 1975, it's not that far off. Although the portrayal of the Indians is too ""Hollywood-ized"" in that they're perhaps overly noble and virtuous, it rings true nevertheless. There's a great scene where a few braves break into a saloon to enact revenge on the white trash who murdered a tribesman. The warriors are painted and the patrons are convincingly scared for their lives. The ending of the sequence makes a powerful statement.

James Whitmore and Sam Elliott play the general and colonel of the Army respectively and you can witness their struggle with performing their duty and doing what's right. They respect Joseph and his warriors and realize that the tribe only wants to retain their freedom, and understandably so: it was promised to them via a treaty. The officers know what they're doing is unjust, but they're under orders.

Composer Gerald Fried of Star Trek fame (e.g. ""Amok Time"") wrote the quality score and even reprises some obvious Trekian aspects. The film runs 105 minutes.

BOTTOM LINE: ""I Will Fight No More Forever"" inspired me to research the historical facts, which the movie is pretty good with, even supplying a screen-map detailing Joseph's 1200-mile route every step of the way. Despite being well-done, the topic is dreary and the story isn't compelling enough to give a higher grade. Still, this is a very respectable film and a must-see if you like pro-Indian Westerns and want to see the awful truth.

I have no idea if it holds true to exact historical details, but it tells a good story.  If you are looking to gain knowledge of this part of history, but not especially concerned which rock they were standing next to or what color the feather on the arrow was, you will enjoy.

5104562,3,B007PXYWNQ,"This is a decent, albeit necessarily abbreviated treatment of a treatment of Native Americans that the U S Government should be ashamed of.  Most people in America know little or nothing of this portion of American history, or of the Nez Perce Indians for that matter.  Having done previous readings on the subject, and visited much of the area involved, I found it interesting.  For Sam Elliot fans like myself, don't get too interested in the movie for that reason, because his part in the movie is minimal and obviously very early in his acting career.  The movie is somewhat antiquated in it's origins, and therefore the video quality leaves a lot to be desired, but it is passable and watchable.",1397433600,4,700,4.760330578512397

It is fairly decent in the portrayal of the movements and hardships of the Nez Perce tribe, though far from accurate. Nor does it show all the villainy of the US Government in its treatment of our First Citizens. Not politically correct, which is a good thing, given the time period in which it was made. Taken in its proper setting (context) it was a wonderful movie which set the stage for further cinematic events like Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee.",1393804800,46,729,4.251798561151079

My mother said this is the kind of show that should be broadcast on ""history"" channels and shown in schools.  Unfortunately, due to its accurate portrayal of history, it probably will not be shown there.
