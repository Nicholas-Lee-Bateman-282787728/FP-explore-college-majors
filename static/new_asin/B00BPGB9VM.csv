8572259,3,B00BPGB9VM,"There are 4 movies on one disc. All four movies are in Spanish, with no subtitles. The movies run about 90 minutes each. The movie descriptions on the back aren't very descriptive.

Atrapada was the most coherent. The Bad Guy breaks into the apartment a mother shares with her young daughter. He makes the mother run errands for him outside the apartment by keeping the daughter hostage.

In Secreto de Amor, a police officer/bodyguard has an affair with his employer's wife. The wife has other secrets from her husband, who has his own horrible past secret/s.

Perversion was the strangest. The main character is obsessed with a famous dead actress and having his dates look like her, dress like her, ectc.

Acoso prohibido was extremely un-subtle, and the weakest of the four movies. The main character is reasonably happily married until his boss meets his wife, and decides that he wants to sleep with her. Between blackmail and sexual assault, the boss plots while also getting rid of his own pregnant girlfriend. Things to watch for include several shots where the boom mike is visible at the top of the screen. According to on screen notes at the end, this movie is somewhat based on real events.

Overall, I'd say give all 4 a pass unless you have particular interest.",1398556800,,1276,4.781818181818182
