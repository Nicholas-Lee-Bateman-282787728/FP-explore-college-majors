8233043,4,B000YJH3WU,"I love this DVD! As a professional massage therapist I found this DVD very helpful in learning new techniques and in re-visiting ones I hadn't used in awhile. It is NOT a Hollywood type professionally done DVD with models. It is done by a massage therapist with real clients. I found it homeyness endearing and it made it more real to me - more useful. It's for WORK not entertainment so I didn't care if it had beautiful people, beautiful music... I wanted something useful and this is it!",1253750400,4,490,4.51685393258427
