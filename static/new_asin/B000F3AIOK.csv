8116738,5,B000F3AIOK,"I love the McKamey's but somewhere over the course of time as I have collected their live concerts on video, I somehow missed this one. Very good addition to my collection. Professional sound and video quality and the onstage performance is classic McKamey's. If you like the McKamey's you'll love this project from one of Southern Gospel Music's leading family groups. Highly Recommend.",1396569600,3,387,5.158730158730159
