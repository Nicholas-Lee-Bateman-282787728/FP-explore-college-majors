8619079,5,B00FWYL7S8,"This blu-ray set is awesome.  The only bad thing I can think of is that these stages are seriously cropped to fit on the disks.  This is the TDF season that got me interested in road biking.  I'm a Team Sky fan now, I even saw them in person this past fall in Richmond VA.",1466208000,,272,3.909090909090909

8619081,5,B00FWYL7S8,Great!  I loved it.  Nice videography and the commentation was entertaining.  I watch it on my trainer and it makes me look forward to pedaling in place in my basement.,1422144000,2,168,4.533333333333333
