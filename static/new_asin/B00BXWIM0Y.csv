5681417,5,B00BXWIM0Y,"If you watch ""The Big Bad"" expecting the typical ""something horrible jumps out of the closet at the half naked college co-ed"" type horror movie, you're going to be disappointed and should go buy ""Halloween XXIV"" or something similar.

The Big Bad has a haunting, dreamlike, stream of consciousness quality. Bryan Enk has shared his director's chair with you as he skillfully directs the heroine (played by the lovely and very talented Jessi Gotta) through a series of unreal encounters. He makes you answer questions like ""Why is is she doing this?"" ""Who is she REALLY talking to?""

This is a true Indy film. Don't look for the ordinary. And don't watch it right before going to bed",1370908800,3,682,4.771186440677966

8575218,5,B00BXWIM0Y,Monsters galore and lots of blood .Good acting to me but not for others. Kept you waiting for the show to drop.,1453507200,,111,4.090909090909091
8575219,2,B00BXWIM0Y,"no budget film with poor writing, I skipped through a lot of the film and still caught all the story. What story there was and it wasn't much. She's after her step dad and he's a werewolf and so are a lot of folks in the film. She's a bad ass and that could have made a good plot but very slow pace which is why I could fast forward though half the film and still get it. Some of the acting was ameture to the point of being uncomfortable to watch others in this high school film  where ok.  Lots of blood some gore but just too poorly written to be enjoyable unless you have a simple mind and are easily amused.",1452729600,,612,3.967479674796748
8575220,1,B00BXWIM0Y,This movie wasn't worth the film it took to make it.  I had to force myself to finish watching it.  What I find most disturbing is the number of people that rated this film five stars.,1438560000,,184,4.083333333333333
8575221,5,B00BXWIM0Y,"I liked ""The Big Bad.""  A lot.

It has a crazy kind of energy to it, where it seems as if each scene is doing triple duty.  The dialogue is sparse -- VERY sparse.  That means I had to be paying attention to what was going on, and I strongly appreciated that.  I sometimes forget how often filmmakers think we've never seen anything before, so they explain it all over again.  C'mon, that's nutty. The location is part of the story.  The silences are part of the story.

We understand vampires.  We understand werewolves.  We don't need that spoonfed to us.

The rest is writing.  And I liked it a lot.

Here's how to tell a story -- a pretty heartwrenching story -- that has as its core a regretful werewolf and broken hearts and shattered lives.",1382486400,,746,4.357664233576642
8575222,3,B00BXWIM0Y,"Frankie (Jessi Gotta) is on the road searching for her step dad (Timothy McCown Reynolds). With little sleep and living in her car, she makes it into The Bad Habit bar where she is not too welcomed. Here she meets Molly (Jessica Savage) a woman who has had it rough. They hit it off and swap childhood horror stories. As it turns out, Molly knows Frankie's step dad, all too well.

About half way through the film you get half an idea what is going on.

This film is not for everyone. It combines horror, with indie, with grindhouse. Much of the film is shot through a camera that is on angles and a lens covered with petroleum jelly in order to give you the sense of being in a mental fog. It makes the film look low budget. The dialouge needed to be beefed up too. This is a concept video designed to take a theme we already know and shoot it a different way.

The film kept me interested in order to solve the mystery.  This would have been a midnight cult classic 40 years ago, but today falls a little short.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1372204800,4,1056,4.233830845771144
8575223,1,B00BXWIM0Y,I said yesterday this is one of the worst. This movie is so poor and pointless that I don't know why they even made it.,1371686400,,119,3.8
8575224,5,B00BXWIM0Y,"I'm giving five stars for the acting and premise. I love independent movies, especially independent horror, so I may be biased, but I recommend this film highly to anyone who wants to watch something beside another typical summer bloated studio picture. It's also a great film for anyone who loves strong female leads and satirical twists on traditional fairy tales with helpless heroines. The effects are very high quality and the script is as complex as it is funny. There is one scene involving a lot of goo that had me laughing out loud at its very sly take on the horror genre.",1371168000,,582,4.660194174757281
8575225,1,B00BXWIM0Y,"I am not kidding.  This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It was so bad, I only looked at 5 minutes of it and said: ""No more.""  I couldn't take it. The film quality was terrible and the acting wasn't much, either.  The cover photo makes it look better than it is.  I don't see how anyone could like this movie.  It was horrible!!!!!!",1371081600,,352,3.9571428571428573
