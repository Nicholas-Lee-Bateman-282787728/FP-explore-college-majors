8185923,3,B000OPIGNY,Overall not a bad DVD; they hunt in some cool locations and some good footage but the first one was better.  The packaging was painful and quite irritating; the seller shipped the DVD in a plastic bag that was wrapped tight around the item and then covered in many many layers of packaging tape.,1392076800,,295,4.462962962962963
