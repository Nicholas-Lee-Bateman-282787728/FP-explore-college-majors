7796387,5,1563641461,"I used to check this VHS tape out from my local library all the time as a kid. I never thought I'd see it again! I'm so excited that I found it, FINALLY!

As for content, the tape features seven short segments in one hour: The Beginning, Adam and Eve, Noah's Ark, The Story of Moses, Samson and Delilah, David and Goliath, and Jonah and the Whale. Each segment resells the story in an entertaining way that is easy for children to follow. It is a great place to teach kids the Bible.

What I also love about this video is the diversity in its animation. Each segment mixes different types of animation, such as traditional hand-drawn, to silhouette animation (especially in Adam and Eve), to cut-out animation. They even mix a few real-life footage and classical artistic depictions into some of the segments. The animation in this VHS is simply amazing, especially when you consider that this was made in the mid-1980s.

I have watched this video a few times since I've gotten it, and I love it even more now than I did back then. I think I was too young back then to really appreciate how great this video actually is.

My only complaint is that so few people even know this videotape exists. Such a shame!",1402272000,,1208,4.4772727272727275
