5886705,5,B00E21QTJ4,"This DVD contains only three episodes from the classic Scooby-Doo cartoon. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:

1. There's No Creature Like Snow Creature
2. A Scooby-Doo! Christmas
3. That's Snow Ghost",1384387200,6,287,4.857142857142857

5886707,2,B00E21QTJ4,"Every year since 2002, Warner Bros. has released or re-released a set of Christmas/winter episodes. All 3 episodes on this year's set were included in last year's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo-13-Spooky-Tales-Holiday-Chills-and-Thrills/dp/B008CU8F0C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo: 13 Spooky Tales- Holiday Chills and Thrills</a>, and the DVD set only costed $5 more than this (an average savings of $2 per episode!). This release has a haunted snowman and two snow beasts, satisfying the criterion for the theme. But this isn't a good value, nor will it keep the viewer entertained longer than 63 minutes. There are no special features either. This set got a second star because the episodes picked are not bad.",1374364800,3,775,6.320754716981132
8600367,4,B00E21QTJ4,I wish there was not so much overlap among the Scooby Doo winter dvds. There is frequently only one new episode or short movie on each disc. Why release it as an entire new dvd?,1514851200,,177,4.085714285714285

8600375,1,B00E21QTJ4,This say 5 hour run time.  To product say 65 minutes.  I thought I was getting a great deal $5.00 for a 5 hour DVD.  I purchased the DVD for an upcoming vacation where we're going to be in the car for 12 hours. very disappointed false advertisement,1435708800,,248,4.125
