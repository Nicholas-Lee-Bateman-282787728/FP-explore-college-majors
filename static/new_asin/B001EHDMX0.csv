8601626,1,B001EHDMX0,"This is one of the worst DVD I have bought from Amazon, I have purchased most new DVD as they list.  But this one as can be seen from the cover (there is none) is totally rubbish.  The quality of sound, picture, and story line are all amateur junk.  And the Director: The ""Baklava Fairy"", guess I should have seen the writing on the wall.
  Very disappointed.",1221696000,,359,4.298507462686567
