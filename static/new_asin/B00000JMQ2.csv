1235699,5,B00000JMQ2,"When purchased I thought it may have been an older concert they had put on to dvd.  When it came in I found out it was a documentary on the making of the Bands self titled album.  Then I thought it would be some thirty year  old documentary they put on dvd.  But I was very suprised and glad I bought  it.  Just recently made, I believe in 1997, it interviews each of the  living members of the Band even Robbie.  Each telling how the album came  together.  Levon and Robbie, who take a few of the songs and put them on a  mixing board to let you hear the individual voices and instruments, I found  to be the most interesting.  For any fan of the Band this is one you have  to have.  It talks about one the  greatest albums ever made.  Also  purchased The Band Live at the New Orleans Jazz Festival.  It was  everything I thought it would be.",949190400,12,843,4.08641975308642

1235717,5,B00000JMQ2,"On the whole, this VH1 documentaries aren't worth owning.  THIS IS THE EXCEPTION. Levon and Robbie (separately, unfortunately) remix and play with how the tracks were recorded is beyond fun, and shows how great music is created.  Watching Robbie Robertson recreate the moment when 'The Night I Drove Old Dixie Down' is something rare and fragile and artistry at its highest level.",1371686400,,380,5.112903225806452
1235718,5,B00000JMQ2,Thought I was very interesting to see their take on the music so many years later.  It was painly obvious the Levon will never acknowledge Robbie ever again.  Don't know exactally what started the beef but apparently Levon died feeling that way. Wonder if the other members felt the same way before Rick and Richard died.  Hope not.,1364169600,,332,4.689655172413793
1235719,3,B00000JMQ2,I played all the songs and did not really like any of them.  Oh maybe there was one song that was okay Up On Cripple Creek.,1362873600,,123,3.730769230769231
1235729,5,B00000JMQ2,"We really enjoyed this because it went into the creative process and circumstances behind each song. It was very interesting, especially for musicians and hard core Band fans.",1359849600,,175,5.285714285714286
1235730,5,B00000JMQ2,I love this dvd. It is good to see those members of The Band who are no longer with us.,1356652800,,87,3.4
1235731,5,B00000JMQ2,"I'm a big fan of the ""Classic Albums"" series, which takes the viewer inside the process that resulted in some of our best rock albums. I'd seen ""Who's Next,"" ""Songs in the Key of Life,"" and ""Graceland"" before watching ""The Band,"" and had thoroughly enjoyed all of them. So my hopes were pretty high for this one and I wasn't disappointed.

It helps, of course, that the album itself was so good -- easily my favorite release by the group -- but the DVD helps to break down how they created tunes like ""King Harvest (Has Surely Come)"" ""Up on Cripple Creek,"" ""Jemima Surrender"" and so on through interviews with the band members and others involved, often as they sit at the recording console playing back particular pieces of music.

Much of the commentary comes from Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm -- thankfully before their famous falling out, but we also get some words from the late, lamented Rick Danko, looking a little the worse for wear.

Just an example of an insightful moment: Robertson is talking about the creative keyboard work of Garth Hudson, using ""Up on Cripple Creek"" to illustrate. When he comes to the chorus (""up on Cripple Creek she sends me, when I spring a leak she mends me""), Robertson plays back Hudson's part, which sounds like a merry-go-round calliope, by itself. But when Robertson blends in the rest of the tracks, Hudson's part becomes the perfectly meshed contribution it is. Robertson chuckles in admiration as he listens to Hudson's playing. It's a great moment.

If you are interested in getting a good look at how great music is made, ""Classic Albums"" is a series to look into, and if you haven't bought one of the DVDs yet, ""The Band"" is a good place to start, particularly if you are a fan of the group.",1334361600,3,1744,4.634304207119741
1235732,5,B00000JMQ2,"This documentary is a great journey through the history of this magnificent band.

1235734,5,B00000JMQ2,"If you have even a passing interest in the Band, then buy this immediately. This presents them-and their genius-in an all new and more profound light. While their songs always sound fresh through the many years since they were first recorded, this DVD is like listening to them in remastered stereo for the first time, with exquisite headphones.

The only weakness that I can see is that so many current groups, as well as musician at the time, were directly influenced by this album. This version of Classic Albums doesn't capture the historical significance of this album, concentrating more on its production and aesthetics. But who cares?  This is a celebration of their music and one of the greatest albums of the rock era.",1327017600,,728,4.862903225806452

1235738,5,B00000JMQ2,"It was wonderful to sit down with this DVD and re-live some of the great music created by The Band.  This DVD captures the feelings and the music of one of the most influential groups to come out of the 60's.  They had a unique and special sound and, as such, hearing about how they came up with that sound was very interesting.  They are a magical group of highly talented musicians and this DVD offers insights into their creative process that only the ones that were there would know.",1266192000,3,487,4.388888888888889

1235740,4,B00000JMQ2,"Anyone out there who is a huge fan of American music has to get this video. It allows viewers to glimpse into a time not to distant from the Beat poets, and see how artistic striving, and good feeling worked itself into something unique and and fervently American. Even though most of the members are Canadian, they capture the American spirit of Rock-n-Roll and change in a way most groups were incapable of doing.

1235742,4,B00000JMQ2,Very good comprehensive review on The Band. Gives good insight into the individual members and why some of their songs were written. A good addition to my collection.,1189728000,2,166,4.964285714285714
1235743,5,B00000JMQ2,"you've heard their music, now hear their words.  this dvd gives insight into an extrordinary album of the early 70's; a release that was polar opposite to much of the musical landscape of the era.  timeless tunes created by five talented musicians.  the joy on levon helm's face is rich as he recounts how the harmonies of himself, richard manuel and rick danko were structured.  an impromtu version of unfaithful servant performed by rick is just as emotionally poignant now, as it was on the lp.  a couple keyboard demos by garth hudson is both pythonesque, and accomplished keyboardist, in it's scope.  and with much less screen time compared to the last waltz, robbie robertson has a word or two as well.  after viewing this dvd, cue up the band's lp on the turntable, or tray in the cd, and relive this great work once more!",1189468800,4,829,4.636986301369863
1235744,4,B00000JMQ2,"After viewing The Last Waltz on the Sundance channel everynight it was on, I was hooked on learning more about this group.  Their sound is classic and if you're into The Band you should buy this DVD if for no other reason than to watch the contemporary Garth Hudson play the organ. It will make you smile.  Also, check out Levon Helm's book This Wheel's on Fire. An extremly interesting and realistic view of life on the road in this great rock and roll band.",1186099200,5,459,4.3882352941176475
1235745,5,B00000JMQ2,"This DVD has tracks from both The Bands first two albums. So you get some analysis of the first album (Big Pink) as well as the famous brown album. The reason being that they were all recorded at the same sessions.
Its a fabulous documentary, with great interviews and analysis at the mixing desk, perhaps most memorably Levon who still gets carried away with the music.
Little known gems like Whispering Pines are given added poignancy when Richard Manuels suicide is mentioned late on in the film. Sadly Rick Danko died a few years after this film was made. When you think that Richard Manuel, Rick Danko and Levon Helm all variously sang lead vocals, depending on the song, you begin to realise how unique this group was in its original line-up.
Garth Hudson improvises at the keyboard for the camera a number of times demonstrating one of his many talents. We also see him playing Soprano Sax with John Simon - getting that classic Band horn sound.
Although not discussed in the film, it is documented that Levon has a problem with Robbie, so Robbie gets little credit (if any) from Levon. I don't think the reverse is true, but the truth in these matters is always difficult to establish.
There is some great early 70's footage of the group playing at the pink house, plus the inevitable clips from The Last Waltz.
Various musicians, including Eric Clapton, George Harrison and Don Was extoll the virtues of the group and there are some interesting points made by Greil Marcus. Sometimes Marcus can be a little pretentious, but most of the time here he doesn't go to far overboard.
This is one of the best Classic Albums DVD's and I would strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to learn more about one THE most important Rock 'n' Roll groups to come out of North America (four of them were Canadian).
Note this is a documentary, so most of the time the tracks are interrupted by people talking. If you want a concert DVD by The Last Waltz....",1183593600,8,1951,4.609195402298851
1235746,5,B00000JMQ2,"This is one of those movies that I didn't want to end.  It is that good.  Seeing Robbie, Levon, Rick, and Garth look back at this album, and talk in depth about the making of it, was pure heaven.  Seeing the joy on Levon's face when talking about Garth's playing put a smile on my face.  I'm not waxing poetic here, folks.  If you love the Band, do yourself a favor and get this DVD.",1183248000,5,383,4.053333333333334
1235747,5,B00000JMQ2,"What can be said? An album that never ceases to deliver new surprises on repeat listening is now broken down track by track. Collaborative effort at its finest. Incredible musicianship, everybody plays many different instruments many different ways. A there is great poignancy. We get to the emotional center of many of the songs, and it is quite heartbreaking. This album was also a huge revelation about the power of ""roots"" music. Eric Clapton was inspired to quit the acid rock of Cream and even tried, unsuccessfully, to join the group.",1168300800,3,541,4.956043956043956
1235748,5,B00000JMQ2,"The Band is awesome. No doubt about it, but that's just it. They were a BAND. Robbie Robertson (spelling correct) somehow fooled the other Band members into letting him have songwriting credit (and Robertson got them to particiapte, against their better wishes, in ""The Last Waltz"" concert and accompanying film). Take a look at Band drummer Levon Helm's book, ""This Wheel's on Fire,"" and he explains that Robertson and someone in the Band's management talked the group into giving Robertson sole (or majority) songwriting credit, so they all could supposedly benefit financially.  Robertson got rich, while the others didn't.  It's a shame, since Helm, keyboardist Richard Manuel (RIP) and bassist Rick Danko (RIP) all had better voices than Robbie's.

There's also a great photo in Helm's book that has Helm showing Robertson how to play something on Robertson's Stratocaster. Great picture. It shows that it was a group effort, but Robertson and ""The Last Waltz"" film erronneously claim Robertson as the leader and chief talent. ""The Last Waltz"" concert was filmed by Martin Scorsese, Robbie's buddy. If Robertson truly was the lone genius of The Band, don't you think his solo work would have been much better?

Also, in the words of the Arkansas-born Levon Helm himself, ""Do you really think a guy from Canada (Robertson) wrote 'The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down' all by himself?'""",1163548800,9,1388,5.101321585903084

1235750,5,B00000JMQ2,"A fine documentary of the making of a great record.  Good insight from all sides of the event with interviews throughout featuring both Robertson and Helm as well as the rest of The Band.  Clapton and Harrison (among others) also weigh in.  In my opinion, this is as good as the Classic Album efforts on Pink Floyd's DSoM and Dan's Aja.  Like those, do NOT miss this.",1151971200,5,367,4.432835820895522
1235751,4,B00000JMQ2,"This is an illuminating glimpse into the music and song craft of The Band.  Composed primarily of interviews with individual members of the group and producer John Simon in studio settings discussing the music on their timelessly classic second studio recording ""The Band"".

This one is for music lovers.  Many of the interviews take place at a mixing console in a studio, with John Simon, Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm adjusting track levels to bring up and highlight the various components of the mix.  Absolutely fascinating stuff.  Having listened to this music hundreds of times over the past 30 years, it was revelatory to hear some of the more creative parts of this complex whole isolated, with insightful commentary from the artists who created it.

Also fascinating, in more of a train wreck kind of a way, was seeing the interview and solo studio performance asides of Garth Hudson and Rick Danko.  Both brilliant artists, but both seemingly still paying the price of the lifestyle that accompanied the height of The Band's fame.  Rick's remarks on the loss of his best friend Richard Manuel left me with chills, knowing that not too many more months from this interview and Rick would be gone from this place as well.

Well worth the bargain price, this will be one of those rare DVD's that I actually return to again and again.",1141344000,11,1342,4.82532751091703

Excellent footage, interviews, and insight into a band with such an abundance of heart that only music could capture.

Will never forget the endless days/nights of enjoying The Bands music, and the 1973 Roosevelt Stadium shows my friends and I were privileged to attend.

It is all fantastic, but to watch Rick Danko being recorded in present day, playing guitar and singing ""When You Awake"" is worth way more then the price of admission.  This DvD is priceless.  Thanks to all involved for its production.",1120089600,16,747,4.578947368421052

It is rare to see anything about The Band that includes input from both Robbie Robertson and Levon Helm and the DVD is all the better for it. I found that the fine editing kept Levon's bitterness to a minimum (the ""someone needs to tune that guitar"" quip from Rocking Chair) and Robbie's contribution to the whole affair balanced. The highlights include the improvisation of Garth Hudson at the keyboard and the insights of John Simon, who produced the first two Band albums and Jon Taplin. Levon sums it up well in the end.

It has several different sections of footage of Garth. Intertwining classical, gospel, circus midway, blues, and folk licks, his nose approximately two inches from the keyboard, occasionally talking to the keyboards as he plays---The man is beyond genius status. He's also very cool.
Watch and listen to Rick play ""When You Awake"" on flattop.
Watch the unabashed joy in Levon's face when he is at the mixing board listening to Richard and Rick (and himself) harmonize on ""Rockin' Chair"", or to Garth's keyboards on ""Rag Mama Rag"". (""Ain't it easy when you know how""--Levon on Garth's playing).
Watch Robbie Robertson sing proudly into a purposely dead mike. You might fool some of the people some of the time...
Watch Robbie take credit for the writing when it was obviously a group effort almost every time. Richard wrote the lyrics to several songs; Garth and Rick wrote a lot of the music--very seldom did they receive credit (or royalties)--only Robbie.
Listen to Eric Clapton and George Harrison reveal that the Band's music was beyond anything they had heard or played.
Listen to Robbie's chord work and his excellent explanation as to why the Band sang harmonies a certain way (that was all they could reach)and why he frequently played odd, partial guitar chords (they just sounded right).
Just watch and listen to Levon. Whether he's singing, playing, or being interviewed, he is extremely entertaining. He, like Garth, is also one of a kind.
Listen to Richard sing anything. I'm positive he and Rick are members in good standing in God's choir.
This is a wonderful DVD. It has much more footage than the TV version I taped off of television. I bought it new.., although I think it ususally sells for [more]. I would have paid [more] for it. If you're a Band fanatic-this is a must have.",1014336000,17,1979,4.8579881656804735
1235761,5,B00000JMQ2,"If the rest of the ""Classic Albums"" series is as good as ""The Band,"" you can say goodbye to shows like VH1's ""Behind the Music.""  While the VH1 shows are usually interesting, they really aren't ""Behind the Music,"" but rather ""Behind the Lives"" of the performers.  You get some of that with ""The Band"" too, but the focus of this DVD really IS the music.  It was a pleasure watching Levon Helm and Robbie Robertson especially talking with such love and affection about their music and how it was put together.  Some great photos and live shots make this DVD a must-have for fans of The Band.",1001721600,8,589,4.4766355140186915
1235762,5,B00000JMQ2,"As a fan of the group, I decided to take a chance on this DVD though I knew nothing about it.  It very easily could have been a dud, but it turned out to be something very special.  The surviving members of the group actually participated in this documentary, and they show a lot of pride and a lot of affection for their days together, and for the music they made.
Just watch Levon listening back to ""Rocking Chair,"" his eyes closed, delighted at the sound of Richard Manuel's voice, basking in the joy of what The Band created together so many years ago.  He still retains that modest, down-home quality that is so endearing.
Then there's ""Brother Garth.""  Band fans will find this DVD worth the purchase price just to see Garth improvising at the keyboard, displaying just what a lovable crazed-genius he really is.
And then there is plenty of Robbie Robertson, giving some very insightful information about The Band's writing and recording processes.  Like Levon, Robbie just can't contain the thrill he obviously feels listening back to the original multitracks from the album.
Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that Robbie ever ""reunited"" with the others for this program, even if just to listen to the tracks together.  The interviews are all done separately.  But that's not really a complaint, just an observation.
Anyone who is a fan of The Band, and anyone who has a genuine interest in the creative process and in making music, will certainly love this DVD.  I'm a picky guy, but I gave this the highest rating I could.",996537600,46,1530,4.747169811320755
1235763,5,B00000JMQ2,"With the recent remastering and re-releasing of the full Band canon, interest in one of America's greatest musical acts has never been higher. This is as good a time as any to pick up a copy of ""The Band,"" one in Rhino records series called ""classic Albums,"" which documents the making of classic albums. (other dvd's include the Wailers, the Who, and the Grateful Dead) This dvd documents the classic lp ""The Band"" from 1969.
Filled with vintage footage of the Band in rehersals, as well as interviews with Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, the reclusive Garth Hudson, and the late Rick Danko, ""The Band"" chronicles the making of this amazing album, focusing on the disparate musical influences- country, bluegrass, rockabilly, black R&B, rock n roll, and folk/Americana- that led to many of guitarist/vocalist Robbie Robertson's greatest songs.
The surviving members at the time of this documentary (made in 1997-pianist Richard Manuel had died in 1986) add their own anecdotes to the music, giving the songs unique colors and life. Levon Helm, Robbie Robertson, and Garth Hudson (the most pleasant surprise on the dvd taking into account his well known reclusive nature) add to the fun by playing some of the tunes based on their perspective, offering running commontary as they go. Add to the Band's perspective those of Eric Clapton, (who wanted to join the Band at one point) George Harrison, Elton John's lyicist Bernie Taupin, and producer Don Was, and the cup of greatness runneth over.
The performances, including ""The Weight,"" ""Rockin' Chair,"" ""I Shall Be Released,"" ""The Unfaithful Servant,"" and ""King Harvest (Has Surely Come),"" as well as a touching tribute to the late Richard Manuel, make the dvd all the more valuable to fans of the Band. The music is timeless, the interviews vintage, and the performances sparkle as they never have. That makes this dvd one to have in any collection.

Learning about the layers of vocals and instrumentation on songs like Rockin' Chair is fascinating...you will learn more about how the group worked from this video than from The Last Waltz (as great as that is in its own way). There are riveting interviews with Robbie, Levon, Rick & Garth and even snippets of live performance as they show how some of the intricate sounds on the album were achieved.

1235768,5,B00000JMQ2,"When the ""Classic"" series of videos came out, I could only wish for anything on The Band.  The ""Brown Album"" or their 2nd album is highlighted here in story and song.  The interviews are well worth the  price of admission.  The Brown Album has always surfaced as one of the top  10 favorites of many other music artists.  Watching Garth Hudson at the  keyboard; or Levon Helm explain his drum technique; or sitting at the  recording console and listening to the harmonies with producer John Simon,  is a look inside of a group that changed the sound of North American music  in the late 60's to mid 70's.  This was probably their best effort of them  all and to have it chronicled here is great.  I have both the VHS & DVD  versions.  Since then I purchased Live at the New Orleans JazzFest.",954288000,8,791,4.433566433566433

It received positive reviews and I also checked out some clips on YouTube first (which I'd recommend you do too, to help you decide). However, I was misled by other reviewers to believe it was 90 minutes plus bonus footage. It's really 75 minutes and no bonus footage. Also, even though it's part of the Classic Albums series and is advertised as being about the first album, it's about the Band's first 2 albums and is missing some songs from each (although the hits and most popular songs are covered here). Overall, it's well done and shows the musical contributions made by each member of the Band.

FYI - The Classic Albums DVD on the Doors is much better, IMO.",1456617600,,726,4.458646616541353
