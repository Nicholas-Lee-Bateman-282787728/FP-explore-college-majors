8068179,5,B0009WIDWG,"This is a fabulous CD.  Each member of the cast, all from South Africa, speaks in his own language, but because general knowledge of the Bible, there was no problem in knowing what was going on.  The music was fantastic.  Having lived in Africa for twenty years, I found some of the dramatizations very true to life.",1381017600,,316,4.508771929824562
8068180,5,B0009WIDWG,Necessary viewing for all who have ever been involved in musical theater. The energy and authentic use of music in the storytelling is just incredible. This piece is especially moving for those of Christian faith.,1376784000,,213,5.114285714285714
8068181,4,B0009WIDWG,"I thought this was an earlier BBC production featuring John Tams, Jim Carter (of Downton Abbey fame, now) and the band The Home Service.  That's what i was hoping to see, and if anybody has information about its availability I'd be grateful.  I'll be donating this to the local library.",1361232000,,286,4.7
8068182,5,B0009WIDWG,"A friend from church told my wife and me ""you MUST see this!""  He was right.  It brings old familiar Bible stories richly to life in a fresh and new way.  Great casting, clever humor in places, and amazing music and dance from a country (South Africa) where they have a lot of great singers and dancers.",1270598400,,303,4.280701754385965
8068183,5,B0009WIDWG,"Wonderful theatre from South Africa.  Don't let the four languages put you off - even if you only understand English, you can easily follow the plot if you know the Bible stories well, and get full enjoyment from the stories and the richness of the music and culture.  The acting, music and dancing is superb - its not just Bible stories, but amazing theatre.",1134864000,2,359,4.59375
