8673500,5,B00MP0SZLO,"Gardiner's Bach interpretations I find exhilarating and fresh and I imagine Bach himself might find them refreshing. The Christmas Oratorio is no exception as presented here, and I think anyone who might be interested in experiencing Bach's cantatas, and the Christmas Oratorio specificaly, ought to take a first look at this. The joyous flow, speed, and almost festive, dance-like quality of the songs, the fact that these talented musicians played ""period"" instruments makes this a fascinating tribute to one of the most lauded composers in classical music. My brother bought Gardiner's Christmas Oratorio for Christmas one year and since it was the first time i heard any of  Back's Cantata work I think the standard was set; I find most other interpretations dry and slow and have yet to be tempted away. What a challenge it must have been to play those ancient instruments and still sound so great. Absolutely Brilliant!",1450137600,,925,5.125827814569536
8673501,5,B00MP0SZLO,"Review based on my original on Amazon UK website.

Wonderful performance from almost all concerned. I feel that the soprano is not quite up to the superlative standard of the other soloists - Bernarda Fink is glorious but one can tell she does not know the chorus part as well as do the other soloists, who integrate confidently with the superb chorus which they form part of. One criticism I have to make and that is that is that the track/chapter numbers in the brochure do not correlate at all in the later parts of the piece with those on the disc.

I have had the DVD version for many years and I played it very often. The idea of the convenience of this long work on one disc has been a disappointment due to the numbering issue. Still merits 5 stars but publisher should correct the numbering.

I feel picture quality is not as poor as one correspondent claims - indeed good for ~2000 vintage. One comment states menus do not work - no problems with disc bought from UK except numbering issue as above.",1446595200,,1009,4.413978494623656
8673502,5,B00MP0SZLO,"Brilliant performance by a master of Bach with a chorus that cares about what Bach was/is trying to say with his music. Excellent picture and sound quality, to my ears, and brilliantly shot and edited.",1431302400,,201,4.771428571428571
8673503,4,B00MP0SZLO,"Wonderful! And the video quality is not as bad as some reviews claim.  Most importantly, the audio is great, as are the special supplements.  Recommended!",1421539200,,154,5.12
8673504,5,B00MP0SZLO,It is a delight to both see and hear this marvelous performance.  The recording is superb and the subtitles are a great aid to non-German speakers.  The Amazon listing tends to give the impression that this performance is being sung in English.  This is not the case.  This is sung in the original German.  It is a glorious performance.,1417996800,3,336,4.627118644067797
8673505,3,B00MP0SZLO,Note that this was recorded in 1999.,1414540800,3,36,4.285714285714286
