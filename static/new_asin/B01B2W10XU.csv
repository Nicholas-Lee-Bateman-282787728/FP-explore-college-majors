8749173,5,B01B2W10XU,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The plot is simple and the fighting sequences are awesome. Chen Kuan-tai has that same poise and style as Bruce Lee. He steals the screen and makes you believe in what he's fighting for. Definitely worth a watch if you are looking for a solid kung fu movie to watch.,1511568000,,313,4.233333333333333
