7913276,3,B00000JRU6,"Wing Chun Kung Fu Volume 3 by William M. Cheung

This Volume 3 of Wing Chun Kung Fu is Primarily about Wing Chun training on the wood dummy used by kung fu practioners.  Therefore, I suspect that many viewers who are not Wing Chun practioners but are merely interested in viewing some of the advantages or unique qualities of Wing Chun, perhaps to look for tips in training and to increase their arsenal of martial art techniques and tactics, will be impatient with all the scenes of wooden dummy training maybe to the point of being disatisfied with the purchase of this volume.

I don't think there is much new in this volume in the way of applications of sequences of moves to which have not already been covered in volumes 1 and 2.  However, there are at least 11 breaks in the scenes of wooden dummy training during which times the previously executed moves on the wooden dummy are demonstrated as applications of moves in fighting between William Cheung and his assistant.  Each set of move sequences are demonstrated several times for the viewer to follow.  I do think that any serious practioner of Wing Chun or any one who wants to become a serious practioner of Wing Chun will be satisfied with the purchase of this volume.

This whole series of Wing Chun Kung Fu is available in both VHS and DVD.  I sincerely recommend that you buy the series in DVD because DVD viewing has certain characteristics, absent in VHS viewing, which supports an almost interactive learning process if the viewer knows how to use the controls and functions of his or her DVD player.  Furthermore, Wing Chun is an intelligent fighting system with some subtle and clever moves which are easy to miss while observing William Cheung and his assistant demonstrate them.  Use DVD slow motion play back and freeze scenes where ever there is a scene or sequence of moves you need to observe for better understanding.

After the completion of all the coverage on wooden dummy training and the applications of their moves in fighting, William Cheung and his assistant demonstrate more Chi Sao moves, techniques and tactics which he had begun in volume 2.",1097971200,,2133,4.722371967654986
