As an early iteration of a web series, Anyone But Me didn't have the funding that Netflix shows like Orange is the New Black and House of Cards now enjoy. As such, for awhile it seemed as if we would be left hanging as to where Aster and Vivian's relationship would turn. Season 3 nicely ties that up for us. As with seasons 2 and 3 you will find yourself cheering for Viv and Aster. The chemistry between Nicole Pacent as Aster and Rachel Hip-Flores as Vivian is unmistakable, and it's very easy to get drawn into every episode.

Now that web series' are a more legit medium for shows, I'm holding out hope that ABM will someday be revived. One can never get enough of Viv and Aster!",1432598400,,752,4.295774647887324
