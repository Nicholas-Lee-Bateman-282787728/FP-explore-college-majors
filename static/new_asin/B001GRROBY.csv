8306813,5,B001GRROBY,"Randy gives some different exercises that are very useful.  From inside and outside cuts, taking on the last defender and 1 v keeper. There aren't really specific drills for the triangle offense but useful for all strikers.  You can make a good practice plan with the drills he shows. I would say good for U12 and up.",1333843200,,317,4.543859649122807
