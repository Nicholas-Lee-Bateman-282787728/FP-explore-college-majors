8463686,1,6304186053,"The T V show ""Hail to the chief"" starring Patty Duke Astin is believed to be what is on the video. But only the 41 presidents is on the video. I have yet to get the TV show on video.",1149811200,2,182,3.575
8463687,3,6304186053,"I think ""Hail to the Chief"" was good, though not great.  I believe the problem with it was that the essay (that was supposed to focus on the president himself) focused too much on the administration.  I think it also has a slight Democratic bias.  If you want a quality documentary on the United States Presidents, I recommend ""The American President"".  Though it isn't chronological, it gives each president a full, solid fifteen minute biography for each president, while Hail to the Chief gives a light, watery, one-minute essay.",1053734400,,532,4.943820224719101
