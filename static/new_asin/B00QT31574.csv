Regarding the product itself, it was very well packaged and looks very nice.  The product is a bit misleading though.  On the product page, the format and on the box itself says DVD but it's actually Blu-ray.  I would've been furious if I hadn't had a Blu-Ray player.  Overall I enjoyed it and I recommend it.",1441152000,,439,4.425
8692768,1,B00QT31574,"I was expecting better packaging than this. Thought it was going to be a nicer cover and digipak. But, it wasn't. Very plain and didn't look nice enough to give as a gift.  Will look at buying other version of this as a gift for a friend who is a big fan of Rain.",1430956800,,263,3.8703703703703702
