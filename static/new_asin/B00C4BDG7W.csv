5690501,5,B00C4BDG7W,"I have no idea what some of these reviewers are on; some bad drugs?  This is a great movie. I saw it on LMN and am buying the dvd; it was that great. I do not understand all the negativity.  Great acting, fantastic Australian scenery, good story .. .what's the problem? I mean, it is no movie of the year.  But, it is one of the better movies that I have seen in a while, Cuba's best acting and surprising great acting from (somewhat unknown) Emmanuelle Vaugier.  Plus, great twist in the story.",1380240000,4,495,4.290322580645161
5690502,1,B00C4BDG7W,"Cuba Gooding jr. must have needed the money or just a vacation in Australia.  The acting was truly horrible, as was the background music.  The story, the graphics, nothing about the movie had any reason why anyone would have wanted to watch this movie.  The budget of this movie was 5 million dollars.  But I could have done it with a good HD movie camera for like $50.00 with some friends.  [...] does not even show a movie gross receipts.  Who knows, maybe it did not make it to the theaters.

My recommendations, don't waste your time.",1376697600,,538,4.484536082474227
5690503,3,B00C4BDG7W,"The film has all the feel, graphics, CG effects, and dialouge as a made for TV film. Dennis Archer (Ty Hungerford) is supposed to deliver information to James, an FBI agent (Cuba Gooding Jr.) but dies before it happens, although they haven't found the body. Mild manner accountant Archer had faked his death before in NY when he was married to investigative reporter Rebecca Scott (Emmanuelle Vaugier). Rebecca did an article on an Australian billionaire who is now under criminal investigation. It just so happens her ex-dead husband worked for him before he died a second time.

Rebecca goes to Australia to investigate her husband's death and ends up tagging along with Cuba Goodling jr. after his initial protest.

The script is improbable to say the least, especially the main relationship. NY driver's licenses do not require fingerprints either. The film was far too predictable to make it enjoyable. The highlight of the picture is the occasional predictable banter that goes on between Goodling and Vaugier. Save your money and wait for Lifetime to show it.

Parental Guide: no f-bombs or sex. Some distorted frosted shower scene rear nudity...and I think she was wearing a bikini on top of that. Some violence, but really doesn't rate an ""R"" in my opinion.",1371254400,2,1266,4.990521327014218
5690504,2,B00C4BDG7W,"""Can you think of any reason your husband would want to fake his own death?"" When an FBI agent (Gooding Jr.) shows up at a woman's door to let her know her husband was killed she is confused. She thought he died years ago. After showing her pictures to prove what is going on they both become suspicious. When she travels to Australia to investigate she becomes a target of a dangerous group. It is up to her and the FBI agent to unravel the mystery without getting killed. I have noticed that some actors are making only straight to DVD movies. Steven Segal, Van Damme, Wesley Snipes and for some reason Cuba Gooding is in that group. I have to say that of that group Gooding makes the best choices, but this movie is an exception. He is OK in this but the plot is overdone and very predictable and the special effects are very awful. Normally I would say Gooding's movies are good and worth watching but I can't say that about this one. Overall, very cheesy and predictable. I give it a C-.",1370649600,8,992,4.338709677419355

5690511,1,B00C4BDG7W,"This was really awful.  I like Cuba Gooding but, this is not his finest hour.  The writing, direction, plot...all very subpar.  The acting was mediocre at best.  If you love this type of story and you don't want an interesting plot that requires some thinking then this is your movie.  Otherwise, STAY AWAY!!  Without a doubt I give this one two thumbs down.  I watched this with my 78 year old parents and none of us had anything good to say about it.  Not even my mom, who is a hard core detective/thriller/murder mystery lover liked it!!  Save your money on this one.",1430697600,6,570,4.456310679611651
5690512,4,B00C4BDG7W,I just love Cuba Gooding Jr.!!! He is one of a kind & he sets this movie off with the very seductive gorgeous Emmanuelle Vougier!!! these to make a very nice team/combo. Do look for them to be in feature up & coming films. Nice storyline plot about a widower who thinks that her husband has been dead for sometime but only come to find that he just died a day before!!! wow look out really good movie & with no interruptions!!!!!!!!,1417824000,,432,4.280487804878049
