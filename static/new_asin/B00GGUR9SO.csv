8713378,5,B00GGUR9SO,Undoubtedly the best DT moment since Portnoy ! Absolutely fenominal performance!,1411516800,,80,6.363636363636363
8713379,4,B00GGUR9SO,"If you are a Dream Theater fan, you should get this. Pretty awesome. The shots are REALLY nice (both video and the book). THe mix is decent, though can't hear Myung as always. You can also see DT missing the energy of MP. Otherwise, didn't like the fact that I had to pay quite a hefty brokerage fees for shipping, but if you can, get the deluxe from any store. You won't regret it. Would have been 5 star if I didn't have to pay brokerage on top of the cost of it (which is on the high side I feel)",1390176000,,499,3.9504950495049505
