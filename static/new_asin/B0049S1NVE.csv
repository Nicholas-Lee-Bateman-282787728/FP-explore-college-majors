8419233,1,B0049S1NVE,Can you say Mexploitation ; this was an ethnic injustice worse than a Rudy Ray Moore film. The Dolamite would have been proud to see this one.,1397865600,,142,4.296296296296297
8419234,4,B0049S1NVE,This version of the story started in the first movie made more sense and had more action in it but as much as I like it it misses the star power from first film,1378944000,,160,3.735294117647059
