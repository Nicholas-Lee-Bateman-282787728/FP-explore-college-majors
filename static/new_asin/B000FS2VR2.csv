2582650,5,B000FS2VR2,"We discovered this show by accident at a relative's house and have loved it ever since. My father taped a bunch of the episodes for us so our son could watch them, and now my father has purchased these DVDs for our son for his 3rd birthday. We love how these shows (and the books) teach respect for elders and friends and care and patience for siblings. Charlie is such a great older brother, and we hope our son picks up on his example with his new little sister. My son can't say his little sister's name yet, but he can say ""yarlie and wola!""

Great find. I wish Disney would have more shows like this one!",1160092800,3,609,4.205128205128205
2582651,5,B000FS2VR2,"My son is 6 months old and he loves to watch Charlie and Lola. We usually try and catch them on the disney channel if he isn't still sleeping. I am so happy that they have finally brought out a DVD collection. I enjoy seeing the expressions on my son's face as he watches Charlie and Lola, he loves them. Infact it is the only baby/child show so far that he actually interacts with. I get a kick out of hearing him try and talk to them or giggling along with Lola. If you haven't caught the show on disney yet or read the books by Lauren Childs then you are missing out! Charlie and Lola are brother and sister and the stories usually revolve around Charlie looking after or helping his younger sister Lola . Charlie is a wonderful example of an older sibling being supportive, patient and caring. Lola is funny and inquisitive. Together they make a great team. I would recommend this DVD set to any of my friends who are expecting.",1157932800,3,932,4.331428571428572
2582652,5,B000FS2VR2,"My 3 year old son & I just started watching Charlie & Lola a couple of weeks ago and are hooked. Little sister Lola is a really cute 4 year old with lots of ideas. It is up to big brother Charlie to help Lola figure out how to make her idea a success. The episodes teach creativity, problem solving, etc. This is one DVD I end up watching whenever it is on.",1156982400,8,357,3.904109589041096
2582653,2,B000FS2VR2,"I bought the volume one, and if it comes from Australia, beware that it will NOT play in your regular DVD.  This was very disapointing to me.  This is however my daughter's favorite show on Disney Channel and I will definitely buy this collection once I know it will be rated CODE 1, as this is the only one that will play here in the United States (or Canada).",1156204800,3,361,4.217391304347826
2582654,5,B000FS2VR2,"Charlie and Lola keep my 4-year-old magically entertained withOUT the drama, romance, scary villains, children or animals in peril, or potty jokes of other DVDs unbelievably aimed at her age group. It may seem really simple and low-key, but she laughs out loud, talks about episodes days later and wants to watch it again and again. The sweetness and sincerity of watching Charlie reach out his arms to a weepy Lola for a reassuring hug is enough to sell you. Parents are never seen nor heard, but they are talked about, loved and obeyed. Along with ""Harold and the Purple Crayon"", these are my favorite kids' DVDs.",1174867200,,615,4.757009345794392
2582655,4,B000FS2VR2,"this was actually a great buy. we're even planning on buying seasons 3 and 4 for our son's 3rd birthday. the show is a great one and is full of child compatable energy...but like my title says there was only one downfall and that is after watching them about 3 dozen times in a mo. my husband and i have grown quite bored with it...therefore we make 5 stars to 4 (for our sanity), even though our son has not. so yes he's still loving it...so it's really quite worth it.

2582656,5,B000FS2VR2,This is one of the only dvd's that I love watching as much as my child does. I love the stories and the characters. Good fun!,1171843200,3,125,3.8461538461538463
2582657,5,B000FS2VR2,"This is a completely beguiling, wonderful show.  I fell in love with it on TV and can't get enough of the DVDs.  I love the way it pokes gentle, affectionate fun at child/sibling behavior.  The characters and their conflicts  are appealingly close to real life kid experience, and the animation is charming.  My 9 year old daughter is as entranced by it as I am.",1170720000,6,362,4.507692307692308
2582658,5,B000FS2VR2,"I love Charlie and Lola!  My daughter loves them too, however, I just love this show!  It is very creative, entertaining and cheery and a great wholesome show for children.  Above all, it is so nice to finally see a program show that an older sibling CAN actually love, care for and get along with a younger sibling!  Great show!  Can't wait for volume 3!",1170547200,2,355,4.4
2582659,5,B000FS2VR2,"I have this little daughter Clio...she is 4 and very funny, and she thinks Charlie & Lola is the best thing on tv.  Now that we have the DVD's, she's got her favorites ""on demand""...life is good for my daughter.  We have a lot of the books as well, and she ""reads"" them over and over again.  My 6 year old really enjoys them, too.

Highly recommended (I love to watch and read them as well!).",1169078400,2,392,4.118421052631579
2582660,5,B000FS2VR2,These are great shows for young children (mine are 4 and a half and 6 and a half) to watch.  Charlie and Lola are utterly charming-it is wonderful how they interact with each other in a kind and creative fashion without being cheesy! It's fun to explain England's english to my kids-they love that they speak the same language but with such different slang. Nothing scary to develop dramatic tension-no worries about letting kids watch these alone.,1169078400,2,448,4.818181818181818
2582661,5,B000FS2VR2,"My hubby and I fell in love with Charlie and Lola from the moment we watched it. Even though we bought this for our daughter, I think we enjoy it just as much as she does. The episodes are all so cute and full of imagination, and Charlie is a great role model for kids who have a little brother or sister.",1168473600,,305,3.935483870967742
2582662,5,B000FS2VR2,"My husband and I and Emily enjoy tremendously Charlie and Lola's day to day adventures.  Lola's exuberance is enchanting.  There are occasions when she has many the same stages and symptoms of any 5 year-old - coping with disappointment, fussy eating habits, not at all ready to go to bed at night.  Charlie, her very caring and imaginative older brother, is an understanding listener who is able to reason with Lola and give comfort, tempered with a charming sense of humor.  You will have giggles galore and never tire of seeing the episodes over and over.  We dare you to sit still during the catchy hip theme song......even the stoic at heart can't resist dancing.....",1163030400,,672,4.808695652173913
2582663,5,B000FS2VR2,My daughter loves Charlie and Lola and having the shows on dvd's is wonderful. We just put them in the car and she is in awe. And so where ever we go is a good time. This is a must have for any Charlie and Lola fans.,1163030400,,216,3.617021276595745

8125787,5,B000FS2VR2,"One of The best, if not the absolute best show for children!!! My 4 year granddaughter only wants to watch Charlie and Lola!! Thank goodness for dvr!!!",1347148800,,151,4.62962962962963
8125788,5,B000FS2VR2,"I bought this series for my little sister's birthday. it is a very clean show, it has randomly inserted / perfectly placed educational segments,it teaches children about sharing, diversity, eating healthy, exercise, taking care of pets, being nice to siblings, etc.  the children have English accents (which is so cute!)  Being 19, i was worried it was going to be so boring to watch this show with my sister and feared it would be as obnoxious as other shows like Dora the Explorer, but i actually enjoyed it. it is great for girls between the ages of 3 and 10, and fun for parents to watch as well. the animation is great, there is not a lot of annoyingly repetitive songs as in other popular shows, and it is filled with funny scenes / educational mesages.",1217548800,,759,4.573529411764706
8125789,4,B000FS2VR2,"We found these collections of British videos to be whimsical and delightful.  Most importantly, our 4 1/2 year old son loves them.  They all start the same, ""I have this little sister Lola.  She is small and very funny""  That is about the only predictable thing as the two children use their imagination and their affection for each other to deal with life's issues, like not being able to check out your favorite library book, getting a little kid to eat her dinner, putting to bed a little child and so on.  The BBC has a nice interactive web site that interfaces nicely with the books and videos.  Enjoy!",1210809600,,607,4.522935779816514
8125790,1,B000FS2VR2,"I was very disappointed with this order.  My grandaughter was too.  Charlie and Lola are her favorite show.  When we put the dvd's in they skipped.  We tried them in three different dvd players.  They skipped in all three.  I would like to get them replaced, but am not sure how to go about it.",1205193600,,294,4.254545454545455
8125791,5,B000FS2VR2,Charlie and Lola is one of the best children's cartoons.  It does a fantastic job of teaching sibling leadership while tackling issues such as finicky eating and going to bed.,1205020800,,175,4.833333333333333
8125792,5,B000FS2VR2,"The kids and I enjoy Charlie and Lola so much. I love that they are only 15 minutes each too. They are so fun to laugh with! My brothers who don't have children yet don't really enjoy them, I think it is a requirement to be on the same level with small children to really enjoy the humor.",1183420800,,288,3.9827586206896552
8125793,5,B000FS2VR2,This was the beginning of a wonderful set of children's cartoons.  It will teach children how to play and use their imaginations while keeping them entertained.  It will also teach them a good sense of family.  I love how the big brother is so doting towards Lola.,1183420800,,264,4.574468085106383
8125794,5,B000FS2VR2,"I'm a huge fan of the show, and I love the patience and caring Charlie portrays while living with Lola.  My children are several years apart in age and C/L make wonderful role models for treating each other with respect and using kind words when your feelings are hurt or you are disappointed. I keep these DVDs in the van; they are just the right length to occupy my little guy for a short trip to the market or while in a school pick-up line (especially in foul weather).  Both children love the show and I've seen them acting out episodes on the playground.",1179878400,,560,4.375
8125795,5,B000FS2VR2,"My 3.5-year-old dghter and I love watching the Charlie and Lola sketches. They are charming and funny. What I like is that the stories all have a point that is made with lots of imagination (and not belabored) AND the children sound geniune, unlike some other shows where they sound artificial and forced (like Caillou). What my daughter likes are the stories and humor--she is quoting lines from this all the time.",1175385600,,415,4.777777777777778
