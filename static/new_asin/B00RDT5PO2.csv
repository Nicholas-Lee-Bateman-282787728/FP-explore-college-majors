Film grain is much more cleanly defined and it is clear some work was done on the video. However, video quality remains very rough due to limitations in the source material - this movie will never look truly great as a result.  Audio is also good, and it has some extras to boot.

The film itself is good, though not spectacular.",1428105600,2,468,4.614457831325301
6928786,5,B00RDT5PO2,"The film company Arrow Video just released one of horror cinema's defining achievement in violent imagery. Reggie Nalder along with so many greats in acting, bring this twisted and violent orgy of pain to life. Nalder plays the part of the Albino character in this brutal, sadistic, and equally twisted 1969's Classic. This deep, dark beast of a film has been given a lovely treatment. Brought out on both Blu-ray and DVD in one package, and if you know Arrow Video, you know how much they put into their releases. They are a fantastic company that I feel, other companies that are out there, not naming names, should take a look and experience the beauty that Arrow Video does, and transcend that mastery to their products.

Mark of the Devil is one of those great, old-school, sadistic, horrifying films that never lets up during it, and still to this day, has never let up. It's one of those movies that truly is an old-school, nasty experience of religious rhetoric and asinine murder. This is one of those movies that stand the test of time as being one of those pioneering horror films never to be forgotten.

From the direction of the film and to the performances throughout the story, it's one of those movies, that in my viewpoint of 36 years of loving cinema, is one of those movies that tend to have a new experience every time you watch and I have never seen it so lovingly mastered, as I've seen it now, on this Arrow Video Blu-ray. Truly a passionate example of how to bring out an old-school film with a new beautiful display of vibrant colors, amazing sound, and the imagery of the disturbing reality of this film. This seems like its new all over again as you experience this Blu-ray. I highly recommend this product it was well worth the cost and is something that I lovingly place on my shelf of brilliant products.

6928787,5,B00RDT5PO2,"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Growing up, I watched quite a bit of horror.  In fact, I watched a lot of horroralmost to the point of driving my parents into hysteria.  They were convinced for a while that I was on a downward spiral into madness.  Of course, that might have been true, but its completely beside the point.  Although I was fascinated with the genre and devoured every movie I could, there were still those titles that were beyond my reach.  This was primarily due to the fact my video store resources were limited; most were just mom-and-pop places that did not order anything too exotic.

MARK OF THE DEVIL is a movie I grew up hearing about but never had the pleasure of watching.  Because of its hardcore torture scenes (for that time period), many stores would not carry it.  But thankfully, the fine folks at MVD snatched it up and present it now in a HD restoration that is fit for a king.  If you have never experienced this film before, you will definitely want to add this to your library soon.  It is an iconic horror flick that deserves a spot of recognition everywhere.

Although this movie is quite dated, it is still captivating and entertaining.  It pulled me in from the start and never let go. Aside from the fact its got some great gore that is still impressive by todays standards, its also a riveting period piece.

MARK OF THE DEVIL is shot well and the HD restoration looks amazing onscreen.  There are only two spots in the whole film where the quality of the picture degrades (it gets grainy), and these don't last but just a minute or so.

The acting in MARK OF THE DEVIL is excellent, with film icon Udo Kier portraying the lead character, Christian.  Kier is one of my favorite old school actors, and his performances are always stellar.  He is joined by some of the silver screens biggest names, including Herbert Lom and the enigmatic but memorable Reggie Nalder.

As I mentioned earlier, the special effects are impressive, particularly the gore that is shown.  While people are being tortured, we get to see impalements, rope burns, rack-stretching, and more.  The effects team does a phenomenal job in portraying these atrocities, and Im surprised the film didn't earn any awards for them.

MARK OF THE DEVIL is obviously a huge win for me.  And although the film is over 40 years old, the terror and intensity it doles out are timeless.  MVD has done a magnificent job with this rerelease, so be sure and snatch up the Blu-ray next week.",1426118400,8,2529,4.556541019955654

The history of film has seen many gimmicks to try to get people to get off their lazy asses and into theaters. There's the wonderful creation of 3-D. Then there was William Castle's traveling interactive films (The Tingler for example). The 70's brought along a new reason for the public to go to the movies. The times were changing and movies were becoming more risque, so what better reason to go see a movie than the chance you might get to vomit? Okay, I bet I know what you're thinking right now and the answer is no, I have not been sniffing white-out again. When Mark of the Devil, the first film to be rated V for Violence (or so the tagline said), was released in theaters, every ticket holder was also given a free barf bag. What a novel idea. But you know what? It was a smash. And with Arrow Film's new Blu Ray/DVD combo, we can all barf together in HI DEF!

Mark of the Devil takes place in England in the early 1700s...I think. They had those triangle Paul Revere hats so it was somewhere around there. Witch hunting has become a favorite past time of many God fearing town folk and it seems that it is starting to get out of hand, particularly at the hands of the deranged Albino (Salem's Lot's Reggie Nalder). In comes Lord Cumberland (Herbert Lom) and his assistant Christian (Udo Kier) to keep order and prevent the wrongful deaths being caused by the sadistic witch hunters. All seems to be improving until Christian discovers that even his mentor is accusing the innocent, allowing the accusers to rape, torture and kill the accused. After Christian falls for a woman who is falsely accused of being a witch (Olivera Vuco) he tries to put an end to the madness.

Mark of the Devil is a vicious portrayal of how so many were wronged in the witch hunting craze. The tortures are pretty brutal including tongues being ripped out, beheadings, severed fingers and burnings at the stake. There wasn't really anything that made me feel like I needed a barf bag, but I'm sure there were few films as brutal as this at the time. The cast was great and it had a good script and period cinematography. It actually reminded me a lot of Witchfinder General and apparently was directed by that film's assistant director. Arrow Film's new Blu Ray/DVD combo is (like all of Arrow's previous releases) pretty amazing. Flawless picture quality and a bevy of extras that would even make an accused witch drool, make this the definitive release of Mark of the Devil. Not a perfect film but a lot of sick fun and a release well worth the price of admission (sadly a barf bag is not included). Below are a list of bonus features:

8695074,4,B00RDT5PO2,"I love old horror films from the 70's and 80's.  They have such a nostalgic feel to them.  MARK OF THE DEVIL is indeed a true classic from the 70's.  I had seen this film on DVD just last year for the first time and loved it.  I was excited to see it was being released by Arrow Films on Blu-ray here in the U.S.!  Watching this film on Blu-ray was like watching a completely different movie!

The first thing I noticed about this film is the clarity versus the DVD I had watched before.  Some scenes looked as if they were filmed today based on how crystal clear they were.  I also noticed quite a few scenes that I had not seen before. I looked on my DVD and noticed it was 96 minutes.  This new Arrow Blu-ray clocks in at 108 minutes, so this is definitely the version to go with.

  This is great fun film that reminds me a lot of the old Hammer films.  The film holds up well and contains a few torture scenes that look very good, especially considering the film was made over 40 years ago!  A couple of noteworthy scenes are a couple of women being burned at the stake, and one woman getting her tongue ripped from her mouth!  If you think the SAW films were the first with the crazy torture contraptions, think again!

  I highly recommend MARK OF THE DEVIL.  This is a must see for horror fans and this is the definitive version of the film to get.",1447200000,,1356,4.1461538461538465
8695075,5,B00RDT5PO2,"Mark of the Devil is Michael Armstrong's attempt at a witchfinder movie after the success of films like Witchfinder General in the late '60s; interestingly enough, he succeeds in crafting a coherent and mostly impressive movie despite the intervention of production with the addition of uncredited director Adrian Hoven. Mark of the Devil is brutal and grim, not a starry-eyed depiction of witch-hunting but an unfiltered and - let's face it - somewhat exploitative look at the medieval torture devices and masochism of people who claimed to be operating under the direction of God; that's why they offered vomit bags as a gimmick to sell the film, and though some might scoff at the idea during the film's initial sequences, which are admittedly slow, the violence quickly ratchets into an assault on the sense that might make audiences queasy, if not because of the blood then because of the way the inquisitors seem to enjoy the application of pain.

The film opens with a strange and somewhat annoying credits sequence that pauses the action during every additional name added to the screen; along with it is a romantic, lilting orchestral score from Michael Holm that will eventually become an earworm but seems out of place at the time, especially knowing the scope of Mark of the Devil's plot. Still, it foreshadows the relationship between buxom Vanessa (Olivera Vuco), a barmaid, and the new guy in town, Count Christian von Meruh (Udo Kier) - the romance between them will ultimately be the most pivotal aspect of the witchfinder's overthrow at the hands of unruly townspeople, and the score highlights that before the audience even realizes it.

Christian works under Lord Cumberland (Herbert Lom), one of the meanest and strictist witchfinders ever; his brutality is unmatched, and if he suspects anyone of witchcraft, especially with the mark of the devil on them, he'll condemn them to monumental torture until they admit their allegiance to Satan; only then do the victims get the pleasure of burning. At first, Mark of the Devil is all talk; Cumberland, despite the rumors, seems like a nice enough guy, and he actually believes in what he's doing. Albino (Reggie Nadler), by comparison, is a much worse inquisitor - he makes up witch accusations on the fly without any proof and rapes women before committing them to torture, without any semblance of godliness.

But Mark of the Devil quickly shifts, showing that everyone has a little bit of evil inside them. Lord Cumberland's tendency towards unfairness becomes his downfall as Christian begins to suspect that he's trying and torturing innocent people just because it makes the public fear him, especially after Vanessa is accused and thrown into a jail cell. There's a realism to the political underworkings of the witchfinder inquisitors that makes Mark of the Devil stand out, even during its slow-burn first half; there's not a ton of gore at first, but Armstrong (and Hoven, I guess) work to develop Lord Cumberland into a fearsome villain that is worse than Albino because he masquerades as a good, pious person.

There's a clear moment where the film turns towards exploitation, and it's fairly obvious that Mark of the Devil intentionally uses its torture devices in a way to titillate and disgust its viewers. But the movie doesn't just stick to terrorizing young topless women; its other main source of motivation to keep the plot moving is a young man named Baron Daumer (Michael Maien) who has quite a bit of wealth and can choose to donate that money to the church in exchange for his torture to stop.

It is here where Mark of the Devil becomes the most thematically successful - Lord Cumberland, for all of his claims about working for God, is really just as greedy and deceitful as the common man, and his blackmail is the same as Albino's spiteful claims that Vanessa is a witch when she won't submit to his wants. Better yet for his character is the casual references to his impotency, which leads to a later development featuring a beautiful young woman (Ingeborg Sch&ouml;ner) whose rape is tastefully shot and still devastating to watch.

While Mark of the Devil's story seems to waver between Christian and Vanessa and Lord Cumberland's increasingly desperate attempts to torture confessions out of accused witches, it all comes together in the finale when Christian, witnessing Lord Cumberland murder a man in cold blood, decides that he doesn't want to support the inquisitors any longer. It's a doubt that's been brewing for some time, and it leads to a revolt by the townspeople, a literal rising of the bourgeoisie to overthrow those in power. Armstrong and Hoven are able to get away with this because of the slow climax of Mark of the Devil, the way the film continues to hammer on the awful things the witchfinders do.

It also leaves a very dark ending to the story, with Christian getting punished for his own involvement in the inquisition despite his help in ending it. There's no happily-ever-after for Vanessa and Christian; in fact, Mark of the Devil ends with Vanessa sobbing, and it's a particularly effective documentation of atrocity. Perhaps Christian doesn't deserve it, but throughout Armstrong and Hoven have shown the viewer the terrible things Christian has witnessed without stepping in to stop it. It's a moment that forces the viewer to question their own onlooking.

Mark of the Devil is sometimes messy in its editing and story, a little long-winded at times, but it's also one of the better witchfinder movies in the genre. There's a lot of torture - realistic, at that - and exploitation is certainly part of the approach to the film. But Armstrong and Hoven creatively find ways to get past a cliched approach to the plot, allowing Mark of the Devil to make its mark in horror by showing how its derivative peers lack the pathos a witch-hunting movie should have.

Arrow Video's Blu-Ray is loaded with special features. I would venture so far as to say there is a ""s***-load"" of them. Obviously not all of these were created for this release, and many of the interviews are older. But it's great to see Arrow has collected all of them on one great set.

Before we get to that, though, let's talk quality. Mark of the Devil looks great in its restoration, with a nice crispness that's only broken in a few shots. The audio is well-done as well; Arrow has included both English and original German soundtracks, and though I watched about 15 minutes of the English dub I quickly switched over to German because the dubbing isn't particularly great through no fault of Arrow.

Included on this disc is a 45 minute documentary featuring many important members of '70s UK horror, including Michael Armstrong, Norman J. Warren, David McGillivray, and a few film critics. Though it's not always about Mark of the Devil, it's certainly worth a watch for important historical context. Along with that is another, shorter interview with critic Michael Gingold about Hallmark Releasing, the company behind controversial horror titles like Mark of the Devil. Gingold delivers a great background for these flicks, and this is recommended.

There's an audio commentary from director Michael Armstrong with Calum Waddell too. But most impressive are the various interviews with the cast and crew of Mark of the Devil, which will take over an hour to get through. Udo Kier, Gaby Fuchs, Herbert Fux, Herbert Lom, Ingeborg Schoner, and Michael Holm all have interviews from various times, and these are a great look at the actors looking back on their time in Mark of the Devil. There's a quick then-and-now of the setting of the film, presented with music and video of both time periods to see how the German setting has changed.

The package comes with a reversible sleeve for the Blu-Ray box, plus a collector's booklet. This has three essays, one about Mark of the Devil's production itself and the problems between Armstrong and Hoven, as well as a background on Udo Kier's film career, and lastly an older interview with Reggie Nalder about his various work in film.

All told, this is a Blu-Ray not to be missed.",1447200000,,8126,4.900363636363636
8695076,2,B00RDT5PO2,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

This is the second time Ive watched this movie. I will readily admit that with those two viewings under my belt Ive not changed with time nor would I recommend this movie wholeheartedly to the average movie goers. The fact that they handed out the first specially printed vomit bags to viewers as a promotional gimmick was probably truth in advertising for the more timid movie goer should say something. On the other hand there is cinematic history in the making with this movie.

My first viewing found me repulsed by the film. This time around, having watched the extra which included a documentary entitle MARK OF THE TIMES, I realized the state of the art at the time and more importantly just why a movie like this had been made. To sum it up in the early 70s the viewing public had grown tired of the horror genre. Hammer Films felt stale and as lifeless as the vampires found there while the horror films of America offered even less. A new wave of British horror directors at the time began making movies that used more accurate historical backgrounds, most notably this film and WITCHFINDER GENERAL, to lure audiences back to theaters again. The result was a group of gore filled movies with more plot than say BLOOD FEAST that horror fans loved. They paved the way for much of what was to follow when it came to the horror genre.

So on to the movie. Taking place in a small European town were witness to a local witch finder named Albino (the great Reggie Nalder) who seems to not only enjoy his work far too much but uses his position to gain anything he wants be it women or fear from local residents. Someone must have spoken up because now a famous witch finder named Lord Cumberland (Herbert Lom) is coming to take over the job at hand, much to the displeasure of Albino. His envoys Christian (Udo Kier) and Jeff (Herbert Fux) arrive ahead of time and stop Albino from accusing a barmaid named Vanessa (Olivera Katarina) from being accused. Of course this doesnt set well with Albino.

Having never had to keep records of accusations made against anyone accused of witchcraft, Albino sets his sidekick to work drawing up documents through the night in preparation of the arrival of Cumberland. While the pair know well that their accusations are baseless it hasn't stopped them from taking pleasure in their work as well as rewarding themselves greatly.

Cumberland arrives and the witch trials begin. As with what is accurate for the time we witness people being sent to dungeons to be tortured until they are willing to admit that they are witches. The fact that anyone being tortured is likely to relent to admitting this to avoid torture seems to go unnoticed by those in charge or perhaps thats just their way of justifying their actions. What follows are various scenes of the torture taking place, everything from someone strapped to a rack and stretched to branding to water torture. The most talked about scene involves a young woman who is removed from the rack only to have her tongue pulled from her mouth while strapped in a metal contraption. Its one of those scenes that horror fans always talk about whether theyve seen the movie or not as well as the one featured in most ads and on the provided vomit bag.

While all of this is going on Christian begins to question the work that they are doing. Hes also fallen in love with Vanessa. While Cumberland warns him of the temptations of the flesh we also learn there is a reason for this. Apparently Cumberland is impotent, something that Albino discovers and attempts to use in an argument with Cumberland.

Just how all of this is resolved finishes out the rest of the film. I won't reveal it here. Suffice to say that bright red blood is spilled from start to finish, that bad guys don't change much and that no one leaves without some form of scar heaped upon them either figuratively or physically. Not only that but being a European film we have some wonderful string styled music being played while a couple wanders over the hillside. Sorry that never made much sense to me and feels forced rather than making sense here.

Ill say again that I now understand better whey a movie like this was made and how it was an attempt to push the genre forward by directors also looking to make names for themselves. The fact that none of them ever went on to create works that were notable for being major mainstream films but always notable for the type of film they were says a lot. Its not that the talent wasn't there but the major studios tended to avoid those directors because of the reputations of their films. Had they been offered the chance at something more mainstream who knows what they could have accomplished?

Gore hounds will flock to this film as will fans of what has come to be known as torture porn.  I don't include myself among either group though I can appreciate the former more so than the latter. Knowing why a movie like this deserves the treatment that it receives as well as the fame is one thing, enjoying it on a regular basis is another.

Once more Arrow Video offers an amazing product here with a stupendous transfer of the film making it far better than the one I viewed previously. And again, while Im not a fan of extras for the most part, those included here help to get a better understanding of the movie rather than just offer press pieces for the stars involved. Not only is the aforementioned documentary included but another about Hallmark Releasing, the controversial company that found numerous ways to promote films like these is here as well providing an interesting look at how it was done. Numerous interviews, a look at locations then and now, outtakes and a gallery are also included. Even if you don't become a fan of the movie you will become one of Arrow Video.",1438300800,,5852,4.59043062200957

8695078,5,B00RDT5PO2,"Mark of the Devil is one of the more notorious exploitation films in cinema history. Written and directed by Michael Armstrong, its American distributor included vomit bags with every showing. The 1970 film was only recently passed uncensored in Armstrongs native Great Britain by their film board. Taking a cue from the very successful Witchfinder General, Mark of the Devil stars a young Udo Kier serving an apprenticeship as a junior witchfinder in Europe. Breaking away from the more conservative mold of Hammers films in the 1960s, Mark of the Devil features very graphic torture sequences that even today can still make audiences squirm in their seats.

Mark of the Devil is the grandfather of modern torture porn, the first truly shocking film that made audiences uncomfortable with what they were seeing on screen. The graphic torture and execution scenes appear mostly authentic, which must have been frightening to audiences in the Seventies that weren't prepared for this kind of explicit material. What gets lost in the conversation is that Mark of the Devil is also a strong movie with a message about corruption of all kinds. The Church used its powers to keep the European nobility in check. Highly effective at getting that message across, the movie ends on an ironic punchline that is unforgettable.

Albino (Reggie Nalder) is a local witch-hunter and completely dishonorable character. He is fond of abusing his power and accusing any woman that looks askew towards him as being a witch. A young apprentice of a master witchfinder, Christian (Udo Kier) crosses paths with the creepy Albino when a beautiful servant girl, Vanessa (Olivera Vuco), is accused of being a witch. Christian quickly becomes smitten with Vanessa, recognizing she is not a witch but a victim of Albinos demented charges. Christians mentor arrives on the scene, Lord Cumberland (Herbert Lom).

Hiding behind an air of sophistication and learning, Lord Cumberland first seems a wise man that takes his profession of witch-hunting seriously. We soon learn he is nearly corrupt as Albino, using his powers as witchfinder for the aims of the Church. This becomes most apparent when a lord is accused of being a sorcerer. Any noble executed for witchcraft forfeits all his property to the Church. This strikes at the heart of the film, revealing some of the real reasons behind the witch-hunting phenomenon in European history.

Mark of the Devil is an odd duck for an exploitation film. It is more a period drama at times, concerned with critiquing religious corruption when not getting graphically violent. Its scenic Austrian setting and lavish production design are far less gritty than latter horror and exploitation films, recalling Hammer Films excellent production values in the Sixties. There are no supernatural elements, Mark of the Devil takes a modern perspective on witchcraft in the hopes its historical message is not diluted. What sets it apart from other British horror films of the period are the brutal, explicit scenes of torture and violence, including rape and execution.

Modern audiences should handle this film better than viewers first did in the Seventies. Decades of torture porn from franchises like Saw have desensitized many viewers. Do not let its reputation fool you; Mark of the Devil is definitely worth a look if you are into classic horror films. Its themes and message still speak to us today. Lord Cumberland is one of horrors most realistic antagonists, a villain disguised as a respected member of the community doing evil in goods name.
