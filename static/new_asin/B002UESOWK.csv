3990984,4,B002UESOWK,"Don't buy used/new from these sellers. You can get it for $28 from Target. SO much cheaper.

As to the review complaint about double sided disks--that's how it is for season 1 (no matter how you buy it).

Anyway, it's a great deal from Target.",1275350400,5,243,4.377777777777778
3990985,3,B002UESOWK,"The set serves the purpose but I don't like the two sided dvd.  Had a known they were packaged this way, I probably wouldn't have bought them.  I've never seen a set up like this where episodes are on both sides of the dvds.",1269302400,4,224,4.068181818181818
3990986,5,B002UESOWK,"For those who like this series, this was a fine gift, and for a bargain price at that.  No complaints.",1358035200,,102,4.1
3990987,4,B002UESOWK,"It is a product well describido and of good quality, since of being a series between fiction and reality does not stop teaching the human side between the prominent figures and of since we are capable of solving certain circumstances.",1357603200,,234,4.875
3990988,5,B002UESOWK,"I have been watching Bones from the very beginning so when I saw the price on this limited time deal, I took it.  Great show.  I recommend.",1355875200,,139,4.111111111111111
3990989,5,B002UESOWK,"I have been a follower of BONES since it came on television.  I fell in love with the series right from the start!  All of the main characters are wonderful.  Even though most of them are ""brainiacs"", you can still relate because of how the series is writen.  They show thier vunerabiliy, which helps make them normal.  To be able to watch at my ""leisure"" and as many times as I want, the back issues is a dream come true for me.  The only thing I don't like is the first Season is double-sided on the DVD.  Other than this, I'm a ""die-hard fan""!!!!",1339286400,,549,4.221153846153846
3990990,3,B002UESOWK,I purchased this as a gift for a friend and she discovered that it was missing the final two episodes of Season One.  I was a bit embarrassed since it was a gift.,1305072000,,162,3.909090909090909
3990991,5,B002UESOWK,"I got hooked on bones because of a girl I was seeing and then I just had to branch out and buy them all. I found this double pack and the seller had a damn good price. I got it a day late but whatever, shipping was free. I would totally recommend the show and the seller.",1301875200,2,271,3.7719298245614037
3990992,1,B002UESOWK,I ordered this item Dec 22.  I should have received it b Jan 13. It's jan 25 and it's still not here.,1295827200,,101,3.590909090909091
3990993,5,B002UESOWK,"You already know how good the series is.  I was worried about this double set being so cheap, and wondered what the ""catch"" was.  No catch at all.  Every episode of every disc plays fine, the packaging is just like the single season sets, and all is well.  The discs are double-sided, which seems to bother some people (according to the negative reviews on this site), but as long as you're careful, what's not to like?  Fewer discs means slimmer cases.  This was a great buy.",1295308800,2,476,4.476744186046512
3990994,4,B002UESOWK,"I bought this double pack from ""Target"" and one disk has an episode of ""The Walton's"" on it and then the next episode wasn't recorded.

Has anyone else had this problem?

We love the package, just hope we can return and get a corrected version.",1294185600,,244,4.4
3990995,5,B002UESOWK,"David Boreanaz is so ""hot"" and, just as he did in the Buffy Is A Vampire series, he pours on the charm, wit and talent in this series.  David, as FBI agent Seeley Booth and Emily Deschanel as Forensic anthropologist Dr. Temperance ""Bones"" Brennan team up to solve crimes.  This is an unusual series and worth watching.  The first season is pretty much on a ""all business"" level, although David still exudes that great sex appeal and wonderful smile.  As the series progresses over the seasons their chemistry begins to come through.  But as a thriller series, it is worth watching.",1283644800,2,581,4.712871287128713
8381187,5,B002UESOWK,"Season 1: Review: Bones is a really good show. I thought I would of not liked it but I was wrong I love all the different ways that they find bodies and how they solve them plus all the personal stories behind the victims. the actors in this show are really good I love david boreanaz. and Emily deschannel is perfect as bones. they have a really good chemistry. the show is great the actors are great the stories are great. everything about this show is awesome. but I will have to say that temprence does get a little annoying once in a while. here are the best episodes of season 1. hart hanson has created a great show.

8381193,5,B002UESOWK,"Well, I have to confess that I'm a sucker for Bones.  I am sorry that the child genius, forgot his name -- the one who ended up in a nut house -- has moved on and hasn't been on the show for several seasons.  His comic timing was fabulous!  Nonetheless, I think David Boreanaz is particularly talented.  I have been following him since Buffy the Vampire Killer.  He is an accomplished director as well as a fine actor.  His face so expresses emotions, even when apparently deadpan!

Emily Deschanel is good, too, as is the rest of the cast.  I like ensemble TV shows.  I think they give the artists an opportunity to grow significantly, both as actors and together as a team.",1380153600,,675,4.4227642276422765
8381194,5,B002UESOWK,"I think this is one of the best shows in terms of showing really smart women, a diverse cast,  and excellent philosophical dialogue.",1378252800,,132,4.739130434782608

8381196,4,B002UESOWK,"Double-sided discs are essentially the worst DVD idea that anyone has ever had. They're ridiculously easy to scratch or get dirty and you have to examine them carefully to make sure you're even getting the right side of the disc that you want to watch.

That said? Bones itself is a great TV show and seasons one and two have some of my absolute favorite episodes. The double-sided disc problem is only in season one in this set (season 2 has regular discs), so I'd still recommend this product as a cheaper alternative to buying them individually. Bones is a great laugh while still having excellent drama and even better characters to follow the lives of (while they figure out the deaths of others). It's really nice to have a show that focuses on science and, more often than other shows anyway, has a more probable and functional scientific base. Though some of the science is wrong or improbable (I'm sorry, but the Angelator is not something that most crime labs could ever afford-- at least they acknowledge that on multiple occasions in the series though), the series is good enough to look past little annoying quirks like that.

Overall, a good watch, I just really wish that companies would stop this stupid double-sided disc business.",1358294400,,1247,4.768518518518518
