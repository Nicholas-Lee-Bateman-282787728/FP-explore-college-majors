8380063,1,B002TCRQL8,"Don't have to say much.  This film is an okay early indie about the goings-on in the Hollywood movie industry, but the Alpha Video quality is far from perfect.  Too bad.  A mid-grade early talkie like this just really goes down the tube when the quality is so bad.",1310601600,,264,4.346938775510204
8380064,3,B002TCRQL8,"The Lure of Hollywood (aka The Reckless Way) stars Marion Nixon, Kane Richmond, Inez Courtney, Malcolm McGregor, Harry Harvey, Art Howard, Gloria Gordon, William Strauss and John Peters.  In the story Helen Rogers (Nixon) is a hotel stenographer who aspires to be an actress.  Jim Morgan (Richmond), the hotel clerk, wants her to marry him, but in deference to her desires sets her up to meet with the producer/owner of Apex Films with whom she signs a contract.  Meanwhile the other man interested in her, Don Reynolds (McGregor) tries to ruin her chances for stardom by attempting to foil her debut film.  The scene is then set for a struggle between Morgan and Reynolds for the heart of Helen Rogers.
The quality of this recording is so-so, but it is definitely watchable for its 68 minutes of run time.  The acting varies, with Richmond and Nixon, and especially Inez Courtney doing well, while some of the others look rather wooden.",1283299200,2,937,4.83125
