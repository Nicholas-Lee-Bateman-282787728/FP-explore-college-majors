7685030,5,B01CN39UL6,"This review won't speak to the quality of this dvd release, but to the quality of the show itself. I adore Gundam X. Discovering Gundam in the early 2000's with Gundam Wing set me on a course that i plot to this day. After absorbing all the gundam I could, I had always been curious about X. It was the only show since the original to get cancelled, and we never saw it unfold the way it should be. Don't let that fact hold you back. Gundam X is unique, in that most of the shows are about preventing the destruction , or invasion of earth, while X shows us the worse case scenario. Its been 15 years since the last space war, earth was devastated, and now most people are trying to eek out a living in the post apocalypse. Things kick off with a thief stealing the titular Gundam X, and falling in love with a NewType girl. From there is an adventure that brings them into space, were there the only ones who can prevent a new space war from ravaging the earth.",1464739200,9,962,4.17741935483871

8753434,3,B01CN39UL6,"The plot is okay, but the motion pictures ""shakes"" a lot. It made me dizzy.
I don't know if it is because I bought a DVD rather than a Blu-ray disc.",1497916800,,148,3.806451612903226
8753435,4,B01CN39UL6,"I've watched quite a few Gundam shows and quite a few of them are really terrible (Turn-A-Gundam and Gundam Seed come to mind). So when I started watching this show I was fully expecting another lousy show to watch a few episodes of and then quickly dismiss. Boy was I wrong!

Gundam Wing Meets Universal Century

How to describe this show? Well let's see. The U.C. Universe has these really serious and convoluted plots that draw in the nerds like me like Ghost in the Shell and Metal Gear Solid, continually building this complex universe of New Types and future history. Gundam Wing was this alternate world of Space Colonies and pretty boys with the most complicated and confusing plot of all because the characters were SO complex they were almost impossible to figure out unless you read philosophy essays about them (I know, I have). Gundam X combines the best qualities of both shows.

While the characters in Gundam Wing were one note, and the U.C. tended to get a big too bogged down in the fog of war to give you clear-cut characters (short of Stardust Memory and Gundam Unicorn) Gundam X has characters that are especially dynamic and strong. Instead of one-note pretty boys, you have characters with strong personalities and emotions who are a bit more human. Comparing say, Heero Yuy to Garrod, the latter is more like a real teen who has something to prove, a protective streak, and is a bit of goofball at times. Like combining Heero and Duo. And then there's the mysterious girl who is at once child-like and innocent, mature beyond her years, and a PERSON. The way there two characters pine after each other like real teens despite their wildly different and eccentric personalities is absolutely amazing. It feels more like real love.

And the bridge crew is fantastic. Yeah, there's the wild blonde party girl, but she's empathetic and kind. There's the all-business bridge girl in love with the captain, but she has a sharp edge to her. And then there's the captain, who is a responsible and amazing captain, but also empathizes with Garrod because Garrod IS HIM at a younger age and he wants to help the kid come into his own. Great stuff.

Gundam X has animation and artwork LIKE Gundam Wing, but better. Higher budget, more detailed, and just...better. You can tell it's closing in on the final era of traditional animation because the animaiton and arkwork is very strong. And when you see the budget bump it's pretty impressive.

The music is so good (orchestral U.C. style music) that I IMMEDIATELY bought volume one and two as Japanese imports.

The plot is kind of all over the place (that's what good adventure is like) but nothing is over-used. There's love, revenge, obsession, moral and loyalty chasing, etc, but nothing is done to the point where it feels too repetitive. Even the monster-of-the-week feel more like a gambit than lazy script-writing. And the motivations for the characters are always strong and compelling. Oh yeah, and even though the Double X has a super-weapon, it is never over-used, and has serious drawbacks. That's what we call good writing.

The one downside to this show is that the video quality is probably a VHS transfer (I can see scan lines at the top of the picture). This is the best Gundam show of it's era (better than Gundam Wing) and deserves a remastered Blu Ray so that the gorgeous animation can shine. With so many shows getting a remastered release lately this show absolutely deserves one.

Rent or check out this show as quick as you can if you're a Gundam fan. You may however, want to wait to buy it until it gets a release with better picture quality. Because this is a beautiful show that looks pretty lousy (even worse than Gundam Wing's DVDs). There is hope. Gundam Wing is supposed to get a Blu Ray release this year. So who knows?",1494633600,4,3816,4.700598802395209

8753437,4,B01CN39UL6,"Gundam X finally comes to America! This is an extremely underrated Gundam series and we finally get it in North America! Unfortunately it seems to be a SD DVD-only release but now there's at least an official release for it!

This first collection contains episodes 1-19 on 4 discs and follows the first half of Garrod Ran's quest in the ever-powerful Gundam X!",1468972800,2,361,4.73015873015873
8753438,5,B01CN39UL6,Great anime show. It's the same character design of Zone of the Enders games. I always enjoy the Gundam franchise.,1467504000,,114,4.75
8753439,5,B01CN39UL6,"I 'm  so into the whole Gundam series  everyone of them. This one is a little different ,but the same. I think that it's harder for me to see how they treat the get gundam pilot and how they don't listen to what he is trying to say and trying not to use the gundam to fight ,but being forced to doing it. It is a great show!!!",1467072000,,326,3.7794117647058822
8753440,4,B01CN39UL6,"After Was Gundam X is a fairly solid show. I've been waiting for these to be released in the North American markets for almost over a year since it was announced that certain Gundam series were being released in the N. American markets at the NY comic con last year starting with the original Mobile Suit Gundam Series. I must say that at first I thought that this series felt a like it was underachieving at first but it really started to get interesting after the first couple episodes. The series still follows your basic Gundam plotline, kid gets into a jam and winds up becoming a Gundam pilot ect. ect. ect. The Gundam itself is fairly impressive in its own right. Not to mention it has a killer opening theme. The story started out a little slow for me but the you do get the luxury of getting the backstories to the main players which is always a nice touch, with the exception of the protagonists main love interest. The only thing that had me confused at first is that I was under the assumption that this was a stand alone series with no other ties to its preceding Gundam series before it, but one of the main plotlines of this series' main story makes me think that its part of the original Gundam's Universal Century timeline. Other then that I feel like this is a pretty good series. I just wish that they would have done an English dub for its North American release, but the English subs aren't much of a distraction anyways. All in all this first half which has the 1st 19 episodes of the series is worth 4/5 stars.",1466121600,,1533,4.382456140350877
8753441,5,B01CN39UL6,"Look i know many folks are crying about no english dub on alot of these new gundam releases ,but i say be happy they are being released and you can have them. i personally don't mind subtitles because i have watched so much anime in subtitled i know many of the common phrases in japanese and don't have to read the subtitles. Now on to the show alot happens in just the first couple of episodes action ,mystery, battles it is a great gundam series to add to your collection.",1465603200,4,475,4.288888888888889
8753442,4,B01CN39UL6,"A great series, but this is not the best looking conversion. The original japanese DVD's had a much clearer image also better sound. But I can't really put down the rightstuf release, I'm happy that its finally available at a reasonable price. The Japanese DVD collection is going for over $200 used. But with that said, I would have paid a lot more for this if it was the original untouched DVD releases on a Blu-ray. This is one of the best Gundam's that not many people know about. Still worth a purchases if you have never seen.",1465344000,4,532,4.438775510204081
