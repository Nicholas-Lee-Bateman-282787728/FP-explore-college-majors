I had a hoot watching it.  It rips along so fast you miss many of the jokes, so unlike the plodding pace of most comedies.",1116547200,,251,3.98

Of course, I didn't write down the name, and spent months asking everyone I knew if they'd heard of it.  No dice.  I finally remembered it had the word Urban in the title and tracked it down.  I find that it gets funnier every time you watch it.",993081600,,379,4.0675675675675675

But I'm somehow scrolling through this very odd place and I see two reviews of a film starring the dancing guy in the Dr Pepper ads and both give five stars... which makes the average rating five stars.  I think we all would agree, whether we've seen this film or not, it is not likely that five stars would be awarded to this film by anyone who's last name isn't Naughton.
The average should be a little better now.  Resume your browsing.
