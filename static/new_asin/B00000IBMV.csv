7909870,5,B00000IBMV,"Harry Anderson spent years as the wise-cracking judge on Night Court, but before that, he was a wise-cracking magician/comedian - and very popular at that!  This video is the only record of his nightclub act at that time that  we have now, but it's hilarious.  In between scenes of his act are short  skits of his performances of various scams and cons, and you'll definitely  be hitting rewind a few times to see him do those things again!  He was  quick with his hands, and good in his work.  All in all, the magic of his  act took a backseat to the comedy, and you find yourself laughing as he  manages to take what would amount to a 5 minute routine of another magician  and pull it to 15 with the comedy and audience participation.  Yes, a  couple of the folks he used in the audience were ""plants"" or  ""stooges"" (look for Mike Cavaney and Harry's wife to be in  there), but it's still a great video and worth the money.  One warning  though: this was a nightclub act, so there is a very small smattering of  profanity in there.",959040000,3,1033,4.347368421052631
