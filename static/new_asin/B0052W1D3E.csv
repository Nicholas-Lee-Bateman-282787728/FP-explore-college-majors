8454498,3,B0052W1D3E,"I was going to order the BBC Radio Audio CD version of the complete soundtrack of the ""lost"" William Hartnell Doctor Who storyline ""The Massacre"" but saw this ""reconstruction"" listed as well.  In addition to the complete audio of the four episodes, the person who prepared this on a DVDR disc added photo stills from the episode to enhance the story. Nice to see photos with the soundtrack. Much better than just the audio CD in that regard.

Technically, there is some static in the sound in the last episode. But this is probably due to the old audio tape recordings that preserved the soundtrack. Near the end, it does look like a ""videotape"" type tracking problem occurs on the still pictures for a moment. The biggest thing though is that the disc only plays on a DVD-ROM drive in a computer and not in any DVD or Blu-Ray Disc machine and I tried four different ones.

I am not a big fan of the purely historical Dr. Who storylines, and this is one of them---and the Doctor is missing for a good deal of the proceedings, but this story is important as it introduces new companion DoDo.",1413331200,,1090,4.494949494949495
8454499,2,B0052W1D3E,"Never thought I would rate a Doctor Who release so badly.  Let me tell you why.

First off I am not sure this is a BBC release.  The disc I received came in a generic case and the label on the disc is extremely blurry.  So I am pretty sure its a knock-off of some kind.  The BBC did release a soundtrack on CD and this may be a fans extension of that.  It is marked DVD and not CD.  The welcome screen has none of the previews highlights or other goodies we have come to expect. It lists 4 episodes and I can't read what they are on the screen.  There is a blurry picture of the Tardis and that's all.

On the brighter side.  The sound is good and it does have still pics that kind of keep up with the story.  Although a lot of them are blurry as well.  And as the last straw I could not get this to play on my DVD player I had to watch it on my computer.  Something I have had to do with no other BBC release.
If your like me and you have to have it, then buy it.  If you don't have to have it, save your money until they actually release it.",1408147200,2,1043,3.7685185185185186
8454500,3,B0052W1D3E,"This ""reconstruction"" uses stills from the original episodes to attempt to visualise the story which is available on the audio only compilations. Although the DVD quality is not great, the overall effect was to enhance the experience of the story. I found myself enjoying this more than I expected. Perhaps something like this could be done to recreate other lost episodes.",1359936000,4,373,5.131147540983607
