2417040,5,B000BH2TY2,I've been wanting to see this for a long time. Glad I ordered it.,1419465600,3,65,3.7142857142857144
2417041,3,B000BH2TY2,"I am a huge fan of the Quatermass stories, both the films with Brian Donlevy, and the original TV serials, and when I came across this, I thought I'd give it a shot, especially since David Tennant is in it (as well as Mark Gatiss (Doctor Who, Sherlock) and Indira Varma (Torchwood)).  Keeping in mind that this was filmed and broadcast live, it's not too bad.  The acting is fairly good, especially from Tennant and Gatiss; however, the filming, locations and general ambiance is pretty lacking.  This remake lacks the depth, suspense and real quiet terror of the original 1953 serial or the 1955 movie.  Jason Flemyng is not horrible as Quatermass, but a lot of his dialog seems forced.  Also, as another reviewer commented, it's a monster movie with no monster at the end, and the end really is lacking in this version (in my opinion).  The departure from Nigel Kneale's original script did not add anything to this production.  If you're a fan of the Quatermass stories, it's worth a watch, but it's probably not something I would ever want to re-watch.",1404432000,6,1056,4.706521739130435
2417042,4,B000BH2TY2,"I have no idea what the original TV version was like, but this was pretty good.  It is slightly different from the movie version but still very enjoyable.",1393027200,2,154,4.5
2417043,4,B000BH2TY2,"I'm a sci fi fan and I enjoyed this.  It was very interesting since it was a live performance on DVD.  The actors did a superb job and the story line was entertaining.  This was more of a cerebral jaunt, no explosions and not a lot of action.",1389398400,4,242,4.0
2417044,1,B000BH2TY2,"This 2005 remake of the classic story sucked. For one, the visuals were much better in the 1953 original, you think in 2005 they could have done a little better, instead of worse. True this was made live, but so was the original. Secondly, it seems that screen writer Richard Fell got rid of all the good stuff in the story. And last, you don't even get to see a creature in this one like you do in the original. Not even at the climax! This is essentially a monster movie without a monster. The only good thing I can say about this version is that I loved all the acting in it. But that was it!

Not recommended!",1366243200,5,613,4.151260504201681
2417045,4,B000BH2TY2,"Considering this was a live production, this was a great show, All the actors were  great, especially David Tennant. I love that this was a redoing of a 1950's scfri live production. Especially since the original production is mostly lost to future generations. Take the time to listen to the Audio Commentary for great insight to this movie.",1363219200,6,342,4.896551724137931
8086625,3,B000BH2TY2,"I read the bad reviews on IMDB but the concept and that cast drove me to order the DVD anyway. And yes, it's as bad as they said it was. Quatermass is one of the great British genius-heroes (along with Sherlock Holmes, Henry Higgins, the Doctor, and James Bond) and Jason Flemyng had neither the charisma or the imagination to carry off the role. It's downright heartbreaking to see David Tennant and Mark Gatiss, both of whom would have known exactly what to do with Quatermass and might well have made this project worthwhile, dutifully carrying on in supporting roles and being so much more interesting than the lead they're supporting.

The DVD format is on the way out, but I just want to let you know something: it's TOUGH, at least when it's made by the BBC's DVD manufacturer. My copy accidentally ended up on the floor of my garage and I drove my car right over it. The case was crushed but the DVD was unharmed and played with no problem.",1518220800,,948,4.479768786127168
8086626,1,B000BH2TY2,"I was interested in seeing this, as I enjoyed the original Quatermass Experiment, as well as Quatermass in the Pit. There are, unfortunately, some major issues with this remake. It was done live, and, while part of me wants to be forgiving to some of the flaws, like a complete non-appearance of the creature itself, when one wants to make a live show, then they need to weigh how the story and production will be affected by that decision. The producers seemed to want to have their cake and eat it too, by remaking the story while not actually showing anything that made the original compelling. The greatest flaw, however, are the characters, Aside from Quatermass, and Briscoe, every other character in the show seems to exist only to complicate the situation. A reporter, Fullalove, hounding people for answers that nobody has and which people should understand why they do not have them; Judith Carroon who keeps poking the bear, as you might say, complicating Quatermass' investigation; Paterson, who, despite being an elite scientist, is only singly obsessed with the fact that the experiment failed and has no interest in why, and all but covers his ears and says ""Nyah nyah nyah, I can't hear you!"" when presented with the idea that they should find out, while at the same time feeding his insanity to the previously mentioned reporter. Even Lomax, who should be Quatermass' staunch ally, has moments of sublime stupidity, such as when he refuses to start a search for the missing astronaut on the basis that he's a ""national hero"", completely ignoring the fact that he was in medical isolation and could be a biological danger to the population. It was frustrating beyond words to see a genuinely interesting story plagued by a cast of characters whose only purpose is to be in the way.",1504137600,,1797,4.837662337662338
8086627,3,B000BH2TY2,The Acting was good especially David Tennant but the ending was flat,1495584000,,68,4.75

8086629,1,B000BH2TY2,Can't use because it says only for area 2.  Very disappointed but didn't find it out until I went to play it a couple of weeks ago.,1483142400,,131,3.8518518518518516
8086630,1,B000BH2TY2,"Again, David Tennant is awesome, ""Quatermass"" movie, didn't rock my world. Great plot I think though, makes me think of ""Sphere"", ""Andromeda Strain"" and ""Solaris"". Maybe I'll enjoy the boom better. Thanks for selling anything David Tennant though! :)",1457481600,,250,5.435897435897436

8086632,3,B000BH2TY2,"If networks insist on live performances, give enough time and maybe a full dress preview to let the bits and bobs of forgotten lines or direction that should be revised be addressed. Good actors not being given a proper chance to shine does not great television make.",1440979200,,267,4.702127659574468

8086634,1,B000BH2TY2,"This movie is horrible! They took a 1950's script which didn't make it back then and simply updated to 2005 ... didn't change anything except the date. Didn't even bother to update the science! I am ashamed of David Tennant, worst performance he has ever done. Don't buy it! Don't watch it! Don't even think about it!",1422403200,2,317,4.578947368421052
