8308701,5,B001HDOTX8,"First the bad news:  As we suspected it is a DVD-R copy and not a factory-pressed disc by PR Studios.  It is also presented in full screen as most of the DVD-R copies are.  The cover appears to be printed on a regular home printer on glossy paper and the disc itself has a label that appears to be home-printed.  ...  Now for a little good news:  Although the full screen picture is short of perfect with mild occasional grain and an occasional line, the picture and sound are far superior to the ""Ghidra"" bootleg that was once sold on Amazon.  This movie was at least watchable and very enjoyable.  It was almost like watching a humorous version of One Million Years B.C. More comparable to Ringo Starr's Caveman.  It even had two cavemen falling out of a tree after the one climbing above them passed gas (I'm not making this up!).  The quality was good enough ... as it's not available anywhere else.  It had me laughing all the way through and it even had a few little extras.  Those extras were trailers that included ... The Deadly Mantis, Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, 20 Million Miles to Earth, and the comedy Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla.  Although I don't like the idea of seeing a bootleg on Amazon, this is one of those very rare cases that I would recommend ordering this 'diamond in the rough,' especially for laughs.  ...  At this point, I don't think a better quality print would be available.",1284940800,,1416,4.455252918287938
8308702,5,B001HDOTX8,"Until now, this has been only available as a bootleg. Shim Hyung-Rae of REPTILIAN/YONGGARY VS. CYKER, YOUNG GU AND ZUZU THE DINOSAUR and most recently, DRAGON WARS made this little gem back in '94; it's the Korean version of ONE MILLION YEARS B.C. and it's a BRUTAL prehistoric film. No fur bikini wearing sixties babes playing cavewomen here. The film has its funny moments as well, but if you haven't seen it, GET IT. HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION. UN-GA BUN-GA!",1224288000,,457,4.871794871794871
8308703,5,B001HDOTX8,"This movie is a rare gem. It's like -One Million BC- in that it deals with cavemen trying not to get eaten by dinosaurs. It's more violent and the dinosaurs are cooler. The T-rex is similar to the one from -Jurassic Park-. The language is in caveman-ese, and it's a lot of fun. I wouldn't recommend this movie for very young kids as it has graphic violence.",1223337600,3,357,4.343283582089552
