6247045,5,B00I0WWCR4,"This is by far the most difficult workout DVD I have ever used!  She will kick your royal behind!  It's the most power-packed 30 minutes ever.  I have worked out the better part of my life (nearly 73 years!).  I didn't think it was possible to have sore muscles again!  Not so.  Once I got past how tough this is, I actually look forward to it.  The women she has in the background look to be all highly trained dancers who are the most limber women I have ever seen!  Tanya is there to coach, encourage and (gently) coerce you into giving your all.  She encourages by saying it's okay to jump out if you need to--but to make sure you jump back in again.  She is also very amusing in some of her comments.  She has a wry sense of humor.  Don't give up on this.  It's worth it!",1432598400,7,776,4.093333333333334

6247051,5,B00I0WWCR4,"I admit it, I used to think if I wasn't exercising for 60 minutes, and it wasn't worth exercising.  Well, this 30 minute full body workout has helped changed my mind.  This is one tough workout!  I feel more worked out after this routine than I do after several of my hour long workouts.

When I first did this workout, I was thinking I would add on another barre workout, but my muscles are worked so hard, I can't even think of doing more leg exercises.

Tanya Becker, the creator of Physique 57, teaches this workout.  As usual, there are two modifiers, one doing an easier version of the exercise and the other doing a more advanced version.  Even though I consider myself an advanced exerciser, I was following the modifier.

Barre sure can be humbling!  I still felt like I got a great workout because my muscles were talking to me for days afterwards.

All you need for this workout is:  a chair, playground ball, thick towel, and an exercise mat.

Here's a rough breakdown of the workout:

WARM UP (4 minutes)
It's the classic barre warm up with knees and opposite arms lifting, pushups and planks.

THIGH WORK (7 minutes)
The ball is between your legs and you do squats and various other leg exercises.  Thigh dancing, my favorite, is included too.  I love thigh dancing, even though I find it really hard; my thighs are barely off of my calves, but I have fun doing it anyway.

STANDING GLUTE WORK (10 minutes)

You are standing at the barre (or chair) and working one leg at a time.  My standing leg is always burning by the end of a set.  Somehow, this section never gets easier, even though I think I am getting stronger.

CORE (5.5 minutes)
There are some fun, new moves here.  You work your core, while the ball is under your feet.  This brings a whole new dimension to core work.  I love these moves, since I am focusing on not letting the ball run away and this distracts me from the `pain' of working my core.

STRETCH (2.5 minutes)
There is always the ""ahhh"" factor once I reach this point in the workout.  I usually skip stretching because I'm short on time, but these stretches feel so good, I make sure to do them.

BONUS (3.5 minutes)
The curtsy move, with a few variations makes up the bonus section.  I love the curtsy move because it makes me feel so graceful.  I may not look so graceful when I'm doing the movements, but I feel graceful.

In summary, this workout is another winner from Physique 57 and I highly recommend it!",1405296000,31,2453,4.422818791946309
8638146,5,B00I0WWCR4,"Not as difficult as the Advanced 30 minutes DVD, therefore I would say an advanced barre beginner would enjoy this workout.  Great music and fast paced.  I like Tanya and I find her comments quite funny sometimes.  The workout flies by and it great.",1472342400,,249,4.613636363636363
8638147,4,B00I0WWCR4,"A really great workout for any level.
The negative being that she has a few comments, and moves, that are quite sexual and she really drives home ""skinny and sexy"" being the goal.  I'm going for stronger, healthier, and kicking health issues, not skinnier and sexier with pelvic thrusts.",1470009600,3,287,4.857142857142857
8638148,4,B00I0WWCR4,"I really like this workout but the instructor is really annoying. She puts on this odd accent that at first made be laugh but now is just obnoxious. The Advanced workout she has is much better, she is way less annoying (still annoying but tolerable). If you can get passed that part of the video, the workout is excellent.",1466985600,,322,4.47457627118644
8638149,5,B00I0WWCR4,"I can't say enough about Physique 57. I own all the DVDs and look forward to doing them all the time! This one is the BEST 30 minute DVD of the collection. I just can't get into Tracy Anderson for whatever reason. I tried, and can't follow anything she does. In my book, Physique 57 coupled with Anna Kaiser (Dance Cardio) and Peleton (Spinning) totally rules my world.",1454976000,5,369,4.4411764705882355

8638152,5,B00I0WWCR4,"I do many DVD workouts, from Denise Austin, Tracy Anderson, to Jackie Warner and Jillian Michaels. I need variety and various degrees of challenge for those on or off days. This is my absolute favorite !!! It is not only challenging (but very manageable, don't be discouraged) but fun and highly effective. She is a fabulous instructor !! Fun, lively, informative...While I hardly ever have time to put in a whole hour, I recently purchased the full hour one...",1436832000,3,461,4.848101265822785
8638153,3,B00I0WWCR4,"This workout is pretty good-better on mute. The teacher is very annoying with the way she speaks-not sure if she's trying to sound hip-hop, but it's distracting.",1436572800,4,161,5.0

8638155,2,B00I0WWCR4,"Was so disappointed in this workout! I do lots of barre workouts, and my favorite is Suzanne Bowen. I had heard about Physique 57 and was really looking forward to a great workout.  Unfortunately, it wasn't a great workout. The warmup section is not long enough or effective enough for the moves that come after it, and the pace is chaotic, meaning you are more likely to hurt yourself doing them. The workout doesn't really flow smoothly, either. Even with the fast pace, and the music, which I enjoyed,  it didn't feel like a workout to me. I got done and thought, ""that's it?"" Ended up doing something else so I felt like I had gotten a real workout in for the day. Didn't break a sweat and sure didn't find it worth my 30 minutes.
Barre workouts are amazing! But not this one, imho. I would try any of Suzanne Bowen's, Sadie Lincoln'Don'ts Barre3, or Tracey Mallet, if you are looking for a challenge.",1434931200,6,905,4.4787878787878785
