3454394,4,B001AK3S4O,"I had no expectations of this movie being any good. I must say after watching it that I thought it was excellent. I thought it was also very realistic in its view of prison life including the Aryan Brotherhood character. It is very scarey in its realism of prison life and also that it in part was based on a true story as another poster said of prison guards staging gladiator fights in Corcoran Prison.

Not for kids by any means but very good.",1219363200,2,446,4.309523809523809
3454395,4,B001AK3S4O,"I don't know if the actual story here is based on anybody, but the guards making prisoners fight in the SHU unit actually happened in Corcoran state prison in California. I think between 1989 and 1995. I'm pretty sure that this was meant to be Corcoran even though I don't think they actually made any reference to it. Especially because when Porter is leaving from Protective Custody he passes by a cell with someone who looks eerily like Charles Manson even has the swastika on his forehead (1:37:38) and when jackson is talking to the warden about John Smith arriving he wants to put him in the protective custody with Manson. Manson has been at Corcoran since 1989. Even though the timeframe is off because when they are interviewing Collins, Jackson refers to Shock and Awe which happened in 2003.",1218931200,,802,4.735714285714286
3454396,5,B001AK3S4O,"A truly good film that deserves more exposure than it has gotten. It finally got upgraded to making the distributor posters after languishing in the middle of the order magazines for a couple months. I was hesitant as typically they bury these lesser known titles for a reason. Instead, this turned out to be a brutal, yet emotional film to the end.

The story is simple enough with our main character being imprisoned after accidentally killing an intruder. His life becomes a fast lesson in surviving the hell of State level incarceration. The depth and story building from there gets very raw and detailed. Even the guards' personal life gets viewed, making for a non-typical foray into the bad character's way of living. Val Kilmer redeems himself after that Conspiracy mess here, and actually made for a very believable mass murderer. Sam Shepherd is always a welcome screen presence, and Marisol Nichols was brave enough to bare all in what had to be a tough scene.

Now for the Blu angle - wow. So much of this film is in your face close ups and directly involved fight sequences. Watching the accompanying docu, the filmmakers used hand helds to get right in the middle of the mess. The Blue showed it all - every single pore and every single drop of sweat and blood. Did the usual over abundance of pauses and found no flaws. This was the first Blu film (I have seen) that had a time lapse topography shot - and it looked outstanding. The accompanying doc was only 14 minutes long but it gave good insight into the authenticity of the cast and location shooting. Let's just say the title of the film represents quite a few of our on screen actors in this one.

A worthwhile owner, and is a rewatchable film - but only in Blu. I could not imagine watching this in LD after seeing this much clarity and detail.",1218153600,4,1817,4.567484662576687
3454397,5,B001AK3S4O,"This was a very uplifting gritty movie. Val Kilmer shines as a mass murderer who gets what he desires most of all. Dorff was good in this as well, his expressions of confusion, suffering, hopelessness and pensiveness are spot on.

Non stop drama with lots of action. This was very enjoyable and inspirational. No spoilers, but in the end, everyone suffers , no one is redeemed. I think this is what made this film so great.

Watch this film with an open mind although it may be a bit ""cliche"".

Hint: Pay attention to Val Kilmer's dialog. You may disagree with him, but you will understand clearly.",1217462400,3,598,4.570093457943925
3454398,5,B001AK3S4O,"The performances in this film are simply amazing.  Much embarrassed to say, I was in tears at the end.  I am a man.  Despite seemingly little time onscreen, both Val Kilmer and Sam Shepard are mesmerizing.  Rest assured that with Stephen Dorff, the future of American acting lies secure, lest we not forget Harold Perrineau (""Oz""; ""Lost"", but without the dreadlocks here) in one of his most electric performances to-date and the younger Nate Parker (""The Great Debaters""), including a great supporting cast with Nick Chinlund and Greg Serano.  Catherine Zeta-Jones lookalike Marisol Nichols should have one heck of a career following her performance here.  Like Oscar ""Manny"" Manheim (Jon Voight) in Konchalovsky's ""Runaway Train"" (1985), it was an honor to know John Smith (Val Kilmer) in this film.  Thank you, Ric Roman Waugh, for one of the best films of 2008!",1216425600,5,864,5.042253521126761
3454399,5,B001AK3S4O,"What would you do?

A young man, just coming into his own, with a growing business and a loving young family, wakes beside his fiancee one night with the realization that someone has invaded their home. It all happens so fast: he tracks the burglar, follows him out of the house with a baseball bat, and seeing the man going for what he thinks is a weapon, he unleashes a killer blow to the back of the man's head. The burglar, as it turns out, had no weapon; his only take, the homeowner's wallet. And because the killing blow happens outside the home, the young man is charged with murder.

Wade Porter (Stephen Dorff)has apparently never been in trouble with the law before, past what most of us have; and he enters the world of jail scared and confused. His fiancee, angry with the system,sticks with him (a good performance by Marisol Nichols), shielding their young son from the worst of the truth, and keeping contact going with Wade, which is the only thing that sustains him in his journey through the system. He is able to bargain the charge down to manslaughter, but still is given time; and complicates his life even further by becoming involved in a scuffle on the bus going to prison,adding more time to his sentence.

Arrival at the prison plunges him into a dark world where survival is all. There are rival gangs, and no one can be counted on as an ally. Wade only wants to do his time and get out. But coloring the entire prison existence is a pervasive corruption amongst the prison guards, with one guard in particular as ringleader (Harold Perrineau, easily recognizable to LOST fans, in a gritty performance as a guard who turned sadistic). As Lt. Jackson, this head guard has a major problem with prison inmates and runs bets on who will win yard fights without doing anything to stop them until he steps in himself by shooting the offender he likes the least - not to kill, but only to maim.

Wade's fortunes change just a little when he is given a new cellmate - a lifer who has been moved to this new facility as a last-ditch effort by the warden in his previous prison to keep the man out of further trouble. This new cellmate, John Smith (Val Kilmer), comes with a history of respect that has permeated the prison system. He is legendary for having murdered the families of the men who killed his own family, and the other prisoners leave him alone. Wade is initially apprehensive of his new cellmate, but the two become guarded friends over the course of time, and John schools Wade in how to survive.

The prime mover in the second half of this drama, however, is Lt. Jackson's maniacal obsession with taking out his life's frustrations on the prisoners under his control. He also controls most of the guards; the one holdout, a young recent hire who has come from the military, watches Lt. Jackson's cruel practices with a pained eye but only makes a move when the prisoners, under Wade and John's influence, make a stand against him. And what Lt. Jackson doesn't know is that Wade's fiancee, with damning evidence provided by Wade, has gone to the FBI with what's going on in the prison.

This was a powerful movie; very sad, also. I found myself aching for Wade, who should have never been in the situation in which he found himself. The prison experience was presented with the foreboding that it probably is in reality; the gangs hang with their own, they battle with rival gangs, and discipline is meted out amongst each other. It was a rough movie to watch, but very absorbing; and all performances - including a small but great role by an old favourite, the excellent actor Sam Sheppard - were outstanding. Val Kilmer looks a bit like the Big Lebowski, with a bushy goatee, but plays his don't-look-at-me-or-I'll-killya role to perfection.

Not a big-marquee movie, but well done and fast-paced.",1216252800,36,3833,4.6114369501466275
3454400,3,B001AK3S4O,"It's not a terrible movie, and it starts out as an honest indictment of how screwed up the laws are when it comes to self defense and protecting your home and family, and at times it feels like a documentary, but it ultimately dissolves into this unrealistic ""the real world isn't the real world"" flick.

3454433,4,B001AK3S4O,"Felon is basically a prison fight movie.  A guy is convicted of murder after he chased a home invader out of his house with a baseball bat then smashed him over the back of the head with it on the front lawn.  He's clearly a fish out of water behind bars and seen as an easy target by other prisoners.  He quickly discovers that this particular prison has you sitting in your cell all day, then when you are sent to the rec yard, the only excercise you're going to get is fighting, as the door buzzer going off is akin to the ding ding ding of a boxing match.  Someone will be running at you the second it opens, if you want to survive, you've got to be the aggressor.  To make matters worse the prison guard in charge of the wing he's in is a cowardly sadistic type who takes pleasure in orchestrating fights and bets on the outcome. He's a small guy who obviously couldn't hold his own in the schoolyard so relishes the authority and power he has now over much bigger men. If his money is on you and you loose, he'll delve out his own beating or use his tazer on your sausage and beans while your trained to a hospital bed.  I'm sure in this prison inmates had to do work or education, take showers and other stuff, but all we the viewer ever see is the cell, and the yard, with occasional breaks to the glass wall with the phone for his wife to visit.

To make matters even worse his wife is going through their life savings at a ridicuously fast rate.  She's living with her mother who is trying to break them up but the stress of that must be causing some severe shopping spree spending or  something. Seriously he's not in jail that long, she has no real expenses but needs to sell everything they own.  What?  This part of the story made no sense for the small length of time he's been behind bars. Even if she's too lazy or whatever to get a job, how can she be spending so much? Now if the kid had some expensive disability to care for, and couldn't be left with the grandma maybe, but he seemed like a normal kid to me.  Perhaps the family of the guy her husband killed had taken legal action against them and won or something but this isn't ever mentioned.",1468713600,,2167,4.1826923076923075

Kilmer plays a convict who's family got murdered, so he goes after the killers and wipes their whole entire bloodline from the planet - every last of their family members!!! Dorff plays his cellmate who defended his home from a robber and killed him by accident... HONESTLY!!! Who's story sounds more intriguing ??? Kilmer's character could have been a very successful 10-season hit-show while Dorff's character will get your pity as a good family man who's one bad evening turns into a decade in hell with the likes of which he did not deserve to end up with. The writer or director made a truly poor choice here by giving you a bite of a really delicious cookie and then locking the jar up away from your sight for another 20 minutes at a time while re-directing your attention to the emotionally sour vegan salad which serves as the main dish on the table here.

Hes convicted of first degree murder, and through a series of unfortunate events after hes imprisoned, ends up in a maximum security lockdown facility. Hes forced to fight to defend his life and to survive in a chaotic den of brutal violence and harsh living conditions. He recieves a cell mate played by Val Kilmer, in a excellent and memorable performance as a seemingly hard nosed life sentenced inmate who eventually befriends Dorff's character and teaches him how to survive under some of the most hopeless and brutal situations, where the inmates must fight each other to survive and fight a corrupt prison system at the same time.

3454526,1,B001AK3S4O,"Felon is the worst movie I have ever watched that is about prison. The movie starts off rather interestingly where a family father is put in jail for accidentally killing a man who was robbing his house but was fleeing. He took a five year prison sentence plea deal.

Now my main issue with this movie is the fact that the movie tries to make it appear as if our justic system is faulty in the way that we dictate sending someone to prison is by making up a plea deal. No jury would convict a man of manslaughter or murder after someone robbing his house and him slugging him.

Once in prison, we see more of the movie's strange idea that everyone in prison is truly innocent of their crimes. One man was in for life for killing the people that killed his wife and dauther. The idea is that everyone in prison had ""good intentions"" yet were falsely place in prison for crimes of protecting the ones they love. Even more so, it shows that prison guards somehow have super powers where they can send people off to more years in prison by falsify reports.

Throughout the entire movie, there are paid fights that are not only amoung the prisoners but also guards have bets and influences on it.

The entire movie is just whack. I do not believe that our justice system is so out of place that everyone in prison right now are forced to defend themselves and everyone is innocent of their crimes. It just doesn't make sense. Of course there are exceptions but this movie make it look like everyone is there just because our system failed.",1348876800,4,1534,4.409893992932862

The film depicts a ""justice"" system that is out of control, with reason and logic out of the picture.  The fights between inmates is reminiscent of the events that took place in the California prison system a few years back.  But it is primarily a film about getting through impossible situations.",1341446400,2,562,4.833333333333333

I'm a sucker for prison dramas as they always help me feel grateful for what I have in life. Shawshank Redemption is a top 10 fave and The Last Castle + An Innocent Man are favorites as well.

This just got added to the list! Kilmer is great in this movie and while it is brutal & graphic, the story is powerful & touching. I watched the first 40 minutes before work and couldn't wait to finish it after getting home!

Both Stephen Dorff and Harold Perrineau were both in Blood & Wine from 1997 as well, another well written suspense film.

3454534,5,B001AK3S4O,"Unlike many 'based on' films which often take freakish leaps in the story and abuse the artistic license to create fabrications that border on complete fiction, this film actually dramatizes events as they really happened.

In 1996 a federal investigation was initiated after internal prison videos were leaked to the press revealing a secret fight club, an actual gladiator arena created to entertain the prison staff of California's Cocoran State Prison. Thirteen prison guards and administrators were investigated; two were fired and eight others indicted for arranging rival prisoners to combat one another. Guards later claimed that they were mandated to provide 'yard time' for prisoners who divided themselves along racial lines into hardcore gangs, and providing that time to all prisoners meant violent conflict was unavoidable and inevitable. But then you have to ask: Why such blood conflicts no longer occur in Cocoran? The same tools, technology and management of prisoners available today were available during this period.

'Felon' explores these events by introducing Wade Porter - an average guy who, in the process of defending his family, commits a technical crime. And despite overwhelming exculpatory evidence and common sense - he's sentenced according to the strictest definition of the law: Blame the victim and preserve the rights of the scumbag.

Played perfectly by Stephen Dorff, everyday citizen Porter is thrust into a world completely unlike one he's known before: The Prison. This harrowing steel and concrete jungle is a hell that, if you're very lucky, will never know. It's not at all improbable that through a series of events outside your control you could find yourself there one day. Ask Louis Gonzalez III his thoughts on the subject. (i.e. Search LA Times archives)

Wade Porter is caucasian - white. And in prison the color of your skin is the color of your uniform. There's no 'choosing sides' - it's been chosen for you. The only thing you can do is not become the victim. The protagonist quickly learns that if you want to live - you fight. There is no other option. Having decided to go ""lone wolf"", a prisoner without a gang, he's forced to constantly battle other inmates inside the yard/arena.

It's into this purgatory that he meets the man who is respected by all, regardless of color or gang affiliation. And in this role, Val Kilmer delivers one of the finest performances of his roller-coaster career.

Portraying multiple murderer John Smith, Kilmer is a sublime powerhouse. Equal parts brutal killer and sympathetic normal guy; equal parts sage teacher and disconnected dark stranger. A deeply complex character whose serene purposefulness is wrapped around a steel hard core of stunning brutal violence. A man who very understandably committed an unspeakable act in response to an equally unspeakable act.

Porter is fortunately assigned as cellmate to Mr. Smith, who reluctantly teaches him the rules of hell. Their first encounter sets the stage for this amazing film: ""Fornicate or Fight"". Obviously, Amazon does not allow profanity and the actual word used in the film, but you get the gist; it's pure brutality from the very second he hears the clang of the cell door. Having earned respect by going to battle without fear - Smith opens up to the new fish. It's these lessons that help Porter survive.

I only wish I could award Kilmer an Academy Award nomination for this role. When I compare it to some of the nominees for that year (2009/81st Show). The comparison between his performance in 'Felon' versus the poseurs who actually were nominated isn't apples versus oranges = it's brilliant versus pretentious arthouse walk-throughs.

So bleeping pathetisad that schoolyard politicking has such influence in the nomination process.

I've screened this several times over the years - and will continue to do so when I need inspiration and a dose of ""it could be so much worse"" to ground myself. Premium filmmaking and penultimate acting and actors. Watch it.",1310515200,2,4023,5.1189024390243905

The performances are top notch. The realism is on point. Its brutal and bleak, but beautiful at the same time. The story is frighteningly simple: a man, just starting a wonderful life with his gorgeous wife and child, winds up having to defend his family from an intruder who breaks into his home in the middle of the night. In the adrenaline-fueled moment, he chases the intruder on his front lawn with a baseball bat and swipes, accidently killing him. Because he was the one doing the chasing, the homicide detectives charge him with murder. The man winds up in prison with the most brutal criminals around: Nazi lowriders (hoping to get ""promoted"" to Aryan Brotherhood), Latino gangsters, black gangbangers, etc etc. The guards, we soon learn, are just as if not more sadistic than the inmates (led by a chillingly awesome performance by Harold Perrineau, some may remember him as Augustus Hill on OZ -this role is an obvious nod) as they love to stage gladiator fights on the yard. Our hero is clearly in a world that he is alien to but soon starts to succumb to the violence as the White inmates take advantage of him. Future clearly doesn't look good, until he becomes cellmates with older, prison-wise lifer Val Kilmer (in his best performance since 'Heat', in my opinion) who schools him on prison politics and teaches him the ropes.

Shocking, realistic story should be watched by every single American male regardless of race, creed, ethnicity. A wake up call - the scary part is its all so terribly true.

I'll shut up now. Just do yourself a favor and watch FELON. ASAP.

3454539,5,B001AK3S4O,"Stephen Dorf and Val Kilmer are incredible in this film along with Harold Perrineau best known for his role as Michael in the hit TV series LOST. They pull no punches here and its just an all out great, yet disturbing story of prison life, and what it does to you and the ones who are left on the outside that you love. When Stephen Dorf is put in prison for all the wrong reasons things take an unexpected turn for the worse, making his sentence even worse than it was before. You get very deep into his emotions and how your perfect life can be taken away by what you think is right, or the simplest of actions. Kilmer, who is a lifer gradually comes to the aide of Dorf when his sentence is increased and he has no choice but to be put into the highest protected facility in the unit. As referred to in many prison films, they are let out into whats called ""The Yard"" but as you will see there are no weights, no basketball, no place to sit or anything else for that matter, just a concrete gladiator type casket for everyone to dwell in. This has much to do with the story and some very incredible and violent events take place while the guards sit above watching like God's as day by day the inmates go at each other one by one. This movie is gritty, mean and really makes you think. It also raises the question how much ""fowl play"" really goes on, and all of it not being the fault of the inmates? Well watch this film and you will find out. The performances are excellent, the acting is just as good if not better than most Oscar winning movies i've ever seen. More movies like this should be made, and this is basically The Shawshank Redemption on steroids, and is the only prison movie i've seen even come close to a masterpiece like Shawshank.

So all this being said, get this film, watch it, and appreciate what you have on the outside. Because just the very most simple thing could put you on the inside, and then even the best of people can be changed into the hardest case to ever walk a prison cell. So a big thumbs up for Felon, it really puts you in a place where you wouldnt ever want to be, its just a movie, but i'll be damned if it doesnt feel like real life. Definitely one of the best films i've seen in a long time, and i've seen 100's.:) Also the best movie of 2008 hands down.",1286841600,,2303,4.175280898876404

Most people who have never been locked up cannot relate to prisons and jail outside of Hollywood, but this movie illustrates the careful balance that an inmate must face when he's locked away from society.  Do you cooperate with the hierarchy of guards and prison security enforcement?  Or do you join a prison gang and learn to be vicious with both guards and fellow inmates? Which of these two survival strategies are more effective?

This movie is about a regular guy, not a lifer named Porter, who has to choose which strategy will be more effective.  He is blessed (or maybe cursed) with a great opportunity to become a snitch and he must choose whether to rat-out a cold blooded criminal and hope that he can ride out his sentence in protective custody, or live by the code of silence that is absolutely necessary if one hopes to survive in general population.

Felon illustrates the sad reality of prison life in the more dangerous prisons in the United States.  You have to choose a prison gang, because if you roll alone, you will be crushed and nobody will protect you.  Most prison gangs are divided by race.  Even the non racist finds himself joining the aryan nation and might find himself brawling the hispanics and blacks.

This movie is hard to watch for any young man who has actually found himself in situations that might get him into trouble.  If you are on the borderline of living a life of crime, watch this movie.  Is this really the kind of life you want?  Being locked up with a bunch of psycopaths, being forced to join prison gangs, and brawling on a constant basis for nothing?

Aside from showing a young man in just this situation, it also is a love story.  To what extent can your family survive when you are on the inside?  Where will they get the money?  Who will be there to protect them?  Porter has to hope that his wife will stick by him as he can offer nothing to her since he is stuck behind bars.

If nothing else, this movie will convince you to stay out of trouble.",1276128000,,2102,4.481578947368421
3454543,5,B001AK3S4O,"You're a law-abiding citizen, apart from a little minor hell-raising in your youth.  You're with a woman you love dearly and the child you created together.  Life is good; you've got a steady job, a decent standard of living and reasonably bright prospects for the future.

Then, in a flash, it's all gone, and you're in a place where sadism is the norm and mercy an unknown quality.  You're surrounded by vicious, almost inhumanly strong men without moral compasses, as predatory in their natures as the fiercest creatures of the jungle.  And they all see you the same way: as fresh, tasty meat to be devoured.

Perhaps worst of all, those paid to protect you have no regard for your safety, and in fact actively conspire to make your life as hellish as possible.

That's the situation Stephen Dorff's character finds himself in.  And that is the nightmare he must endure, day after day, with a dim hope of a return to his loved ones the only thing keeping him going.

Val Kilmer's character John Smith, who is simultaneously terrifying and sympathetic, is his only friend.  A mass murderer (there are extenuating circumstances we learn about), he serves as Dorff's mentor and backup, giving him down and dirty lessons in gang psychology, inmate politics and maintaining one's sanity in insane surroundings.

Harold Parrineau is particularly outstanding, playing the Jekyll and Hyde prison guard who flashes in a moment from caring husband and father to vicious torturer and modern-day Caesar, presiding over his own version of gladiatorial games.

The ending is neither nihilistic nor sappy, but resolves itself as best it can given the location where most of the story occurs.  Disturbing and hopeful at the same time, this is a movie you can't miss.",1276041600,3,1753,4.921768707482993
3454544,4,B001AK3S4O,"Adapt and survive - or don't and don't seems to be the message of this film.

And the Stephen Dorff character has to adapt pronto after quickly being inaugurated into the way things happen in a top security prison having been convicted of manslaughter for using `unreasonable' force on a burglar resulting in his death.  To be honest, the rapidity of the adaptation, and its success do slightly beggar belief but this is fiction and meant to be entertainment after all!

Nevertheless, this is a powerful film and, if it represents anything like the way top security prisons are run in the states, a harrowing account of the type of brutal regime designed to do anything but rehabilitate their inmates.  The performances, particularly Dorff's, are uniformly excellent and Val Kilmer, doing his very best to impersonate Jeff Bridges, is a revelation.

3454554,3,B001AK3S4O,"Bought this movie because I was hoping Val Kilmer would deliver a Silence of the Lambs performance, but no such luck. His acting is good, but the movie plot and the writing do not give him the opportunity to shock the audience with a real mass-murderer persona. I think the producers tried to do too much with this movie instead of letting it be what it is, a whiteboy goes to jail and has to toughen up movie. They have some really unnecessary scenes about the girlfriend and her mom and the main prison guard and his son. Another issue I had with the movie is with the main prison guard who is being played by the wheelchair convict from HBO's prison series OZ. He is supposed to be a tough bully prison guard, but I just couldn't shake the image I have of him as a cripple and the weakling he was on the TV series LOST. This movie would have been much better if this role had been played by a big scary muscle guy. TV hottie Marisol Nichols does a good job and there is a scene where you get to see her topless.

3454565,4,B001AK3S4O,"Felon is one of those little direct-to-DVD gems that is so rare an occurance.  The always underrated Stephen Dorff stars as Wade Porter, a hardworking family man who accidentally kills a burglar outside his home.  After being sentenced for involuntary manslaughter, Wade finds himself locked up in a violent prison run by the sadistic Lt. Jackson (Lost and Oz vet Harold Perrineau) who makes the prisoners of his wing frequently fight each other, and also constantly makes things harder to deal with for Wade.  Wade also gets a new cellmate in the form of famous mass murderer John Smith (Val Kilmer), who becomes an unlikely ally of Wade's.  Sometimes brutal in it's violence, Felon is from former stuntman turned writer/director Ric Roman Waugh, and the film barely pulls any punches.  Dorff is good, but the real stars of the show are Perrineau and Kilmer; both of whom are simply spectacular in their roles.  If there's any flaws to Felon, it's that the conclusion wraps things up a little too tidy, but for what it is, Felon is surprisingly great.  Also featuring 24's Marisol Nichols, Sam Shepard, Nick Chinlund, and Anne Archer.",1222732800,3,1135,4.9109947643979055
3454566,4,B001AK3S4O,"Writer/Director Ric Roman Waugh may not have a large number of completed films under his stuntman belt, but if FELON is any indication of the quality of work we can expect from him, it seems he has a solid future.  There are many films about prison life and prison breaks that keep coming down the pike, but few of them have the quality of being character studies of how prison affects the minds and lives of both those incarcerated and those on the outside who must deal with the realities both concurrent and future of living in the shadow of ultimate effects of prison experiences.  FELON is a strong character-based prison drama.

Wade Porter (Stephen Dorff) is a young man on the rise: he is planning to marry the mother Laura (Marisol Nichols) of his child Michael (Vincent Miller), his small business is finally becoming successful, and his family life is happy.  One evening Wade's and Laura's sleep is interrupted by an intruder who steals Wade's wallet, then runs out of the house with Wade chasing him with a baseball bat.  One hit with the bat the robber is dead.  The police arrive and because of the logistics of the timing of the blow to the robber, Wade is arrested for murder.  Unsuccessful attempts to explain the situation eventually lead to Wade's being sentenced to prison and he is sent to a prison run by a sadistic Lt. Jackson (Harold Perrineau) with demons of his own.  A famous prisoner John Smith (Val Kilmer) is transferred to the prison and becomes cellmates with Wade.  The racial violence between prisoners creates rules and gangs and Wade is caught up in the violence that occurs in the daily 'hour in the yard' experiences, until John shares his knowledge of prison logistics and advises Wade in how to avoid critical issues.  The prisoners are not only violent among themselves, but they are also the pawns of the brutally evil Lt. Jackson and his crew who appear to delight in the traumas the prisoners create.  It is obvious that the good guy/bad guy line is blurred and in order to survive Wade follows John's wise council to an ending that eventually results in some correction of the evils of the prison situation.

Survival is the key in the cases of many of the characters, including some of the 'good guards' (Nate Parker, Greg Serano), the steadfast Laura, her mother (a small but well defined role for Annie Archer), and for former guard Gordon (Sam Shepard) a friend of John Smith.  Dorff and Kilmer provide very strong characterizations as does Perrineau, but without the fairly large cast of 'fellow prisoners' who set the scenes, their overall performances would be less impressive.  It is here that Ric Roman Waugh demonstrates his talent for handling the mixture of physical brutality with the fragility of each individual's mind that makes the film work.  It is a tough film to watch but it is solid craftsmanship.  Grady Harp, September 08",1221955200,17,2891,4.752

3454568,4,B001AK3S4O,"Felon is one of those prison films that makes you pray that you never end up behind bars doing hard time. Filled with violence, intimidation and pathos, it wrings a lot of energy out of you, but makes the payoff worth the effort.

Stephen Dorff is at a good place in life as the film starts. He's the owner of a small construction company planning to expand with a small business loan, and planning his wedding to his live-in girlfriend, with whom he has a young son. One night, he awakes to hear an intruder in his house. He chases the burglar into his front yard, and swings a baseball bat, hitting and killing the burglar. Since the burglar was outside and running away, Dorff is charged with murder.

What happens next is every law-abiding citizen's nightmare. Dorff gets caught up in a prison-gang killing and has time added to his sentence. To make matters worse, his involvement in the killing runs him afoul of the head prison guard (played with gusto by Harold Perrineau from Lost), who amuses himself by making the prisoners fight each other in the yard during recreation time. The only friend Dorff manages to make is his new cellmate, John Smith, played by Val Kilmer, a famous mass-murderer who has been transferred to the prison after his involvement in a prison riot.
Kilmer teaches Dorff the ropes of prison life, but even Kilmer's tutelage can't protect Dorff from the sadistic prison guard captain.

This is a very well-written and well acted movie. Kilmer gives one of his finest performances in years, and Perrineau proves that he's more than capable of playing a hissable villain. Felon is a treat that may be hard going down, but is ultimately satisfying.",1221091200,4,1677,4.716723549488054
3454569,4,B001AK3S4O,"I loved prison flicks like ""The Last Castle"" [with Robert Redford and James Gandolfini], The Rock [with Sean Connery] and Brubaker [with Robert Redford], and so when I saw this at the DVD store, I decided to give it a chance. Boy, was I pleasantly surprised - despite the non-existent hype, this was quite a solid prison movie with an excellent cast.

The story centers around Wade Porter [Stephen Dorff] who plays an average Joe type character, leading a relatively idyllic existence with his fiancee Laura [Marisol Nichols] and his young son. They are preparing to get married and have dreams for their future when it is all shattered one eventful night with a home intrusion. Wade chases down the intruder and swings at the guy with a bat resulting in the intruder's death. Before you know it, Wade is sentenced on involuntary manslaughter charges to a prison term of three years. But, worse things are in store for Wade - on the trip to prison, he inadvertently finds himself witnessing a brutal murder committed by another inmate, Samson of the Aryan Brotherhood, and refuses to testify for fear of retribution. This gets him into the bad graces of sadistic Lt William Jackson [Harold Perrineau] and into the SHU [Security Housing Unit] at Corcoran State Prison.

Things get more interesting when a 'lifer' named John Smith [Val Kilmer]  is transferred over to the prison and becomes Wade's cellmate. Smith appears cold and detached, a man so consumed by his past loss of family that he feels he has nothing left to lose. Despite initial animosity - both Wade and Smith form a tenuous friendship of sorts that is tested to its limits by Lt Jackson whose 'hobby' is pitting inmate against inmate in the yard - where one inmate is attacked by another/others whilst the guards watch them for sport. What happens to Wade and Smith forms the rest of the story.

The movie is well-told, but what makes it compelling is the solid acting -Dorff as Wade Porter, a man who was only doing what he felt was right but finds himself on the other side of the law again and again, finally driven to desperation in a bid to survive the brutal system, one which lacks compassion and justice. Kilmer as John Smith truly plays the 'lifer' to a hilt - a man who sought vengeance on those who killed his family by wiping out the murderers and their families, a man of contradictions and who spouts philosophy, yet remains firmly entrenched as a legend amongst the inmates. Harold Perrineau's Lt Jackson credibly plays a sadistic guard who takes out his frustrations on the inmates, treating them as emotionless, soulless beings undeserving of any form of compassion.

All in all, I found this prison movie to be well-done and though some scenes were truly brutal, the depictions seemed credible and never over the top. Final verdict : highly watchable prison flick with excellent casting.",1220400000,12,2871,4.780241935483871
