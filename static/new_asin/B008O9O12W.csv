6655074,5,B008O9O12W,"I am 28 weeks pregnant with my fourth child and really enjoyed this video. I have been having lower back problems with this pregnancy and found the pace and intensity of this workout perfect. As opposed to other prenatal 'yoga' or 'pilates' workouts, this one is much slower paced and doesn't jostle you around nearly as much. It allows you to really settle into the poses and gain flexibility and strength. The video is relaxing but at the same time I have gained strength in my back and legs. The pain in my lower back has improved allowing me to rest more comfortably.",1366761600,,571,4.553398058252427
6655075,1,B008O9O12W,"I feel bad giving this one star as someone which many hours put into practicing yoga probably would enjoy it. I'm 6 months and have been doing prenatal videos the whole time and still couldn't keep up with this one. This video has must more deep deep stretching/twisting that I would be fascinated to find the average pregnant woman be able to do.

Again, if you're incredibly flexible still in your pregnancy and/or want a really challenging video go for it. If your trying to just get a good stretch and relatxation that works for your body try another video like the Heather Seiniger or Desi Bartlett ones!",1359763200,4,609,4.638888888888889
6655076,5,B008O9O12W,"I have been practicing yoga for over 10 years and have continued to do yoga during my pregnancies, taking regular yoga classes up to 37/38 weeks (with some modifications).  This is hands-down the best prenatal yoga dvd that I have done, because there is actually a workout involved.  A lot of prenatal yoga videos that I have tried are so gentle that there is little-to-no workout, and I wonder what is the point?  This workout does not really raise your heart rate, but involves stretching and some strength building, all relevant to being pregnant and preparing you for labor.  I highly recommend this dvd for anybody in their late second or third trimester. (And no previous yoga experience is needed.)",1359417600,8,705,4.85
6655077,5,B008O9O12W,"This was a nice yoga workout.  I liked that it was not too long, but I still felt benefit from it.  You get in some nice stretching, but there are also a few challenging poses (goddess-work those thigh muscles for labor)!  At fifteen weeks my belly is still small enough to do all the poses easily, but the narrator walks you through modifications for later in your pregnancy.  Depending on your level of practice, yoga blocks would be helpful.  This is also a great deal at just $1.99 to rent it for seven days!  I think I will go ahead and purchase it after the 7 day rental is up.",1355616000,5,583,4.254545454545455
6655078,4,B008O9O12W,"was just looking for some prenatal yoga.
this is the one.
moves at a great pace.
lots of leg strengthening at the beginning.
lots of opening and stretching.
slows down at then end.
its great.
one crazy thing is no introduction and the sound bounced in and out a couple of times.
no music.",1395878400,,288,4.351851851851852
6655079,3,B008O9O12W,It's a decent workout but not great. There's no music and the voice giving instruction isn't always in sync with the person on screen. I've done pre and post natal yoga with my first but am not a regular. Some of the moves were a little difficult but I was able to modify.,1394150400,3,272,4.150943396226415
6655080,5,B008O9O12W,"This yoga series is just challenging enough that it pushes me to build my strength in key areas (thighs mostly, but spine, pelvis and arms too) that will come in handy for labor later. There are modified versions of most poses so if you're a beginner like me, you can still keep up. I appreciate that it doesn't include annoying hippie dippieness about either being pregnant or yoga itself (which is what has turned me off of in-person classes in the past). The length is long enough to really work me out, and short enough that my mind doesn't wander and I don't feel like giving up.

After I do this workout I feel very energized and able to tackle my day with gusto!",1393113600,,669,4.395161290322581
6655081,4,B008O9O12W,"This is a little less than 40 minutes, so it doesn't take too long and I definitely felt that I got in a lot of much needed stretching. Within the video there are poses in which she suggests using a yoga block as an option. I wish I had one because it would be helpful to me, as I am new to yoga. Otherwise I felt that it's a great pregnancy workout that isn't too strenuous but great for strength and flexibility.",1390348800,,414,4.060975609756097
6655082,3,B008O9O12W,"Most of the poses in this routine were very good and effective, however I found this routine to be pretty challenging for me. If you are not experienced with yoga or if it has been awhile since you have practiced this might not be the best routine to start with during pregnancy. I am at 24 weeks and I was very sore after finishing. Also there are some plank type poses which I skipped because I have been told by my midwife to avoid any abdominal exercises, so be careful with these. If you are a experienced yogi this routine might be good for you, but it is a little too harsh for pregnant beginners in my opinion. Furthermore there is no background music which was kind of awkward for me, I like to have some type of music to go along with my yoga practice.",1389571200,,762,4.226027397260274
6655083,5,B008O9O12W,I really like this video. It is not cheesy or too new age. It strikes a nice balance. The instructor is just a voice on the DVD walking you through the poses. The gal in the video performing the poses does not speak and just goes through the practice which I found refreshing. The poses aren't too challenging but enough to make me feel like I'm building some strength and gaining flexibility. You won't burn a lot of calories but that is not my intention right now. This DVD is aimed more at keeping your body in good condition for labor and easing aches and pains.,1389225600,,566,4.349056603773585
6655084,5,B008O9O12W,"I found the practice to be grounding, nourishing and just the right level of intensity for 34 weeks - assuming you have been doing some yoga and exercising throughout your pregnancy. As a yoga teacher myself, I can vouch for the instruction given. I definitely recommend this practice - a great series that engages the whole body while also preparing pregnant women for birth and giving us poses to maintain strength and flexibility while also offering relief for sore lower backs that often come in the 3rd trimester. If it is too fast for you, pause it when needed and take your time.",1389139200,,586,4.699029126213592
6655085,5,B008O9O12W,I tried many different yoga videos and this was a perfect balance of challenging and manageable while pregnant.  I wanted a decent workout even when I was in my third trimester.  This was perfect.  I also appreciated that there was not lots of pink and pastel backgrounds like many pregnant yoga videos for some reason.,1385683200,2,319,4.763636363636364
6655086,5,B008O9O12W,"I took yoga classes throughout my first pregnancy and contribute my relatively easy birth to that. This time around I don't have time to take classes and am so happy to have found this video. I like that it is 'no frills' and feel like I am getting a legit, serious workout that will help me achieve the birth I want (for reference I am 22 weeks and have been doing this workout since I found out).",1379980800,2,398,4.181818181818182
6655087,3,B008O9O12W,"No music, which was just weird. Seemed like there was no real beginning to ease into things and there were some difficult poses. Definitely tired after that but I don't feel relaxed.",1376784000,,182,4.71875
8678051,2,B008O9O12W,Its a flow video. Didnt love it. Production is ok.,1489622400,,50,4.1
8678052,1,B008O9O12W,"Her flow was terrible, she was clumsy, her instructions were rushed and vague. Another reviewer said they felt sore after this yoga session....yeah, hardly. Overall it was irritating, not relaxing. She would just jump into a new pose with no prompting, and is clueless about transitioning poses. Booo.",1489104000,,301,5.291666666666667
8678053,5,B008O9O12W,Great yoga video! I watched it several times as a rental. I plan on purchasing it to enjoy the rest of my pregnancy.,1454976000,,116,4.086956521739131
8678054,1,B008O9O12W,Loved the poses but the sound was horrible.,1446768000,,43,4.5
8678055,4,B008O9O12W,Not bad for a video workout. Enjoyed that it was a little challenging.  No background music is a little odd. Good to learn some modifications while pregnant.,1434067200,,157,4.814814814814815
8678056,5,B008O9O12W,Challenging but appropriate for a routine pregnancy yoga practice.,1414540800,,66,6.444444444444445
8678057,2,B008O9O12W,It's great if  you have been doing yoga before but it's not for a first time user I tried it and just couldn't  do it  pregnant or not it's hard and with this belly in the way it was just a big nope,1408579200,,198,3.558139534883721
8678058,5,B008O9O12W,Nice relaxing transitions for my joints. Gives a wonderful stretch as well. I normally practice intermediate yoga in a class but there are no prenatal classes avail in my area so this is a great substitute. Very pleased!,1407715200,,220,4.815789473684211
8678059,1,B008O9O12W,"I decided to give this prenatal yoga routine a whirl after falling in love with another on Amazon Instant Video. For the same price, the quality (sound audibly cuts in and out and thumps) and the helpfulness of the workout (no breath instruction, few variation suggestions for those further along) are just awful. I finished annoyed instead of zen.",1400025600,,348,4.915254237288136
