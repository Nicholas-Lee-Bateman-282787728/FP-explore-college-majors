4471004,5,B004UU31XE,"This new recording of Britten's Billy Budd from Glyndebourne can be recommended without hesitation.  I don't have much to add to what the previous reviewer already said.  There is no weak link in the (all-male) cast, but John Mark Ainsley and Jacques Imbrailo should be singled out anyway - they are both amazing in their parts. Chorus and orchestra are excellent, as is Mark Elder - another one of the great recordings with this conductor.  Even if you know the plot, this recording plays almost like a mystery story and keeps you at the edge of the seat... Particularly impressive is the set; the transitions from deck to cabin and back are stunning.  It's good to see that this opera is now out on a state-of-the-art blu-ray.  The old BBC version of this opera with Peter Pears is great, too, not just from a historical perspective, but this new recording might well be the new gold standard.  With the good mixture of close-ups and views of the entire stage, it works well on the screen, but guessing from the audience's reaction, it must have been great in the house, too.",1309737600,31,1077,4.6421052631578945
4471005,5,B004UU31XE,"Mark Elder, the conductor for this production of Billy Budd at Glyndebourne 2010 notes that all Britten's opera works are in some way about the loss of innocence.  It's an interesting observation that, if too neat and reductive a way to describe the qualities and the approach that Britten takes on the subject in Billy Budd, at least shows that it's a personal theme that means something to the composer.  Elder, of course, isn't intending to summarise the power and complexity of this opera or Britten's work in a single phrase, and his deep understanding of the wider themes of Billy Budd is evident in his conducting of this remarkable production.

More than just being about the loss of innocence, it's the different manner in which that innocence is corrupted in each of Britten's operas (Peter Grimes, The Turn of the Screw), that makes them such intriguing works, works that are consequently capable of creating a deep impression on the listener.  And although on the surface, Billy Budd, adapted from a short novel by Herman Melville, seems simple enough in its broad depiction of the malicious and deliberate destruction by cruel and heartless authorities of an innocent young man - a common sailor on board the HMS Indomitable in 1797, hard-working, of good heart, kind to his comrades, respectful of his superiors and loyal to the crown - the question of what motivates such behaviour (in the form of John Claggart, the ship's master-of-arms) and how it is sanctioned, or at least tolerated (in the weakness of Captain Vere) is a much more complex and interesting subject that the opera touches upon.

The nature of those drives that lead to such abuse of the innocent and the inexplicable failure of those with intelligence and authority to do anything about them might not be fully comprehensible, but the nature of how they are expressed in the opera and the wider implications of the piece is given a masterful comprehensive presentation in this production at Glyndebourne in 2010 by Mark Elder and Michael Grandage with the London Philharmonic. This is an outstanding production in every respect, conducted and played with verve and passion, capturing the full dynamic and range of the score, bringing it vividly to life.  The staging is most impressive, aiming for solidity and period authenticity, while also being magnificently designed to keep the fluidity that Britten strove to achieve in the reduction of the opera to two acts.  The singing and characterisation is great across the board, Jacques Imbrailo singing wonderfully while characterising all the innocence and passion of Billy Budd in every movement and expression, Philip Ens a charmingly sinister presence as Claggart, and John Mark Ainsley a superb Captain Vere, the conflicted heart and mind caught between the polar extremes of the two men's position.  With all this, and fine performances in the other roles, this exceptional staging of Billy Budd is never less than gripping, dazzling and thought-provoking.

A fantastic, near-definitive production of the opera, it's given an equally fine presentation on Blu-ray from Opus Arte.  Directed for the screen by Franois Roussillon, the production looks magnificent, striking a perfect balance between close-ups and letting the full impact of the staging to be experienced.  The image is clear and detailed, the sound mix both in LPCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1 dynamic and resoundingly powerful.  Extra features consist of a 10 minute overview of the opera and the production, and a look at the costume designs.",1309737600,16,3555,5.099827882960413

8442229,5,B004UU31XE,"One of the most sheerly beautiful Blu-Rays I have seen, this Glyndebourne production of Benjamin Britten's ""Billy Budd"" fills the screen with painterly images worthy of Rembrandt in their composition and chiaroscuro. Excellently acted and sung, the production presents Britten's adaptation of Herman Melville's classic novella in nearly ideal form. Jacques Imbrailo may not be quite beautiful enough to be the Handsome Sailor of everyone's dreams, but his heartfelt physical performance and emotionally powerful singing perfectly convey Billy's humanity, simplicity and tragedy. John Mark Ainsley is an excellent, thoughtful Vere, although he cannot quite pull off the nearly impossible feat of being convincingly an old man in the prologue and epilogue as well as a young, vigorous man in the rest of the opera. (As with ""The Turn of the Screw"", of course, Britten's opera more or less follows only one of the possible interpretations of its enigmatically ambiguous source text, in which Vere can be perceived as the real villain of the story.) I felt that the performance of Act II somehow fell slightly short of that of Act I, although there is no lack of emotional impact in such passages as the ""Interview Chords"", ""Billy in the Darbies"" (Britten's setting of the ballad which concludes Melville's story) and Billy's last words. All in all, a superb production.",1384387200,3,1366,5.242009132420091

8442232,5,B004UU31XE,"It will be difficult to surpass this production. Musically is as good as it can be envision and produced. Orchestra and singers are just perfect for the roles. The image and the sound (Blu-Ray version) put you really inside the stage and close to the characters.  Although this is a staged production, the filming is so good that you feel being in the ship and could easily believe it was created for filming.  The most impressive aspect of all is the acting of the principals. A movie star could have not done it better! They really get into the characters and the close ups are a real treat that the audience in the theater may not have the opportunity to appreciate so much. The lighting of the stage is very creative and works very well with the filmed version
It is a very disturbing story, but one that resonates with you since you realize that the essence of the story occurs everywhere and all the time.  In summary, a Britten production at its best.",1369353600,3,958,4.494252873563219
8442233,5,B004UU31XE,"I found this at the library. I didn't know what to expect because the only person in
the cast who I had seen before was Philip Ens. I was impressed with his artistry when
I saw him on stage in Chicago. He performs very well in this production. Other
reviewers have pointed out the fine singing. I will just add that the voices are
well differentiated. This is important because this is an all male cast.

The sets resemble the interior of a nineteenth century ship well. We even see the
deck guns briefly as they clear for action against an enemy warship. The enemy ship
escapes into the fog. The production should have had a fog machine to depict this.
The sailors and shipboard marines clothing appeared authentic.

The picture and sound are very good on my modest system. I strongly recommend this.",1344556800,,801,4.555555555555555
8442234,5,B004UU31XE,"This is a magnificent production. The best production of Britten operas' currently in the DVD/Blu ray catalogue.

Realistic, period sets and costumes bring us to the time of the opera. Lighting and video direction do justice to the visual aspects of the production.

Jacques Imbrailo brings the innocence of Billy Bud causing the viewer to sympathize and share the hero's feelings throughout. Phillip Ens may not be as sinister and unsympathetic a Claggart as Michael Langdon was in the Mackerras/Pears set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Britten-Billy-Budd/dp/B0012L0TEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Britten:  Billy Budd</a>, but still he is a daemonic schemer,plotting against Budd. John Mark Ainsley,in the role of Captain Vere, inevitably triggers comparison with Peter Pears in the above set. He may not have the aristocratic class of Pears and he does not quite become as sympathetic a figure as his peer, still he serves the role with adequacy.

Picture is of top quality and sound is excellent, with a fine balance between voices and orchestra.
