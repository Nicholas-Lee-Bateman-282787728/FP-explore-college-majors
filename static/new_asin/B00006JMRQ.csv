1781616,4,B00006JMRQ,do not speek good english.  Not from America. Watch movie and like.  Only give four stars becouse did not understand dialog.  Hope sub title version come out soon.  Good to wotch movie anyway.,1034035200,,192,4.7272727272727275
1781617,5,B00006JMRQ,"Well, I have to admit... I liked this film.  I was representing the brother of one of the film makers and one day he passed me this DVD.  So, I watched it... And I'll have to say, It's pretty much the opposite from what I expected.  I mean who would have thought an ex-frat boy with a class ring from a private law school would enjoy a cheesy horror film... Well, this one did.  I've been trying to contact the director to solicate representation, but I have a feeling someone at William Morris all ready picked him up...  If you read this Director Bill Koning, call me.  We'll make millions together.",1034035200,,601,4.36936936936937
1781618,5,B00006JMRQ,"I just have to say that the gentleman, Brian Reid, playing Lyle in this movie is about the sexiest thing I've ever seen. ...Not only is he handsome, but he's also witty.  I give this movie 4 stars, but with Brian in it, I have to go with 5.  I had to get that out of the way... Anyway, I love this movie!",1034035200,,304,3.8095238095238093
1781619,5,B00006JMRQ,"...is The Evil Dead, but Silo Killer is a close third.  Seriously, people, I have to say I was stunned when I saw this.  My brother told me to check it out and I didn't expect much, but Boy oh boy was I wrong.  Excellent film!",1034035200,,226,3.869565217391304
1781620,5,B00006JMRQ,"...have I been this excited about something that graced the screen of my Television set.  This movie is really good.  I just wanted to put it in lamens terms for any of you out there that didn't understand that comparing something to the most underrated sitcom in TV history was a good thing.  It redeemed the whole Fonzi jumpin' the shark thing on it's parent show... But that's irrelevant, we're talking about SILO KILLER...  Now,imagine ole' Arther Fonzirelli wouldn't have made it over the sharks and been devoured... That's how good this is.",1033948800,2,546,4.838709677419355
1781621,4,B00006JMRQ,"...of dead bodies that is!  From start to finish... was never bored.  Heck, what am I saying... I was pretty much on the edge of my seat.  Good entertainment, folks.",1033516800,4,165,4.433333333333334
1781622,5,B00006JMRQ,"There's a young lad in this movie who goes by the character name ""Lyle"".  He is credited as being played by an actor named Brian Reid.  I only bring this up, because it is this amatuer reviewers option that we are talking about the next owen wilson.  Expect big things.  As soon as this review is posted, I will print it and hang it on my wall, so in a few years when he is staring in his third or fourth major studio film I can tell everyone... ""What did I tell you.  I was the first to recognize the talent"".  After whoever casted this film of course, but 2nd place ain't so bad.  B-money as I now so dearly call him, makes this movie well worth a purchase.",1033516800,3,659,4.062015503875969
1781623,5,B00006JMRQ,"Good times USA for anyone who is bold enough to try this new flavor of horror film.  I only have one message to give to these film makers, ""Keep on truckin', brothers!"".",1033516800,,169,4.28125
1781642,4,B00006JMRQ,"The story has a few flaws, the acting is decent but nothing spectaculer (for example the character with the guitar was the most annoying person on earth), it the way how it is filmed which made me impreesed with it. The color was very good, even the night shots that were actually blue instead of night looked good, which they actually make fun of in there commentary which has to be the funniest thing I have ever seen. Fast forward to the scene where it has a grown boy sleeping on a giant stained pillow in front of a [cruddy] computer. thats basicly the best part of the movie.",1034467200,,581,4.339449541284404
1781643,3,B00006JMRQ,"Every Saturday I visit my little brother and watch some [bad] B-movie (he is a real B-movie fan) I saw this movie on amazon and it seemed to have a good review. It wasn't as good as evryone said. But is defiently a good enough to be number four of all the B-movies I have ever seen, oh yeah one more thing it has a good villian, oh yeah one more thing PUPPET MASTER RULES.",1034380800,,372,3.973333333333333
1781644,4,B00006JMRQ,"I am a producer with several projects at various stages of development... And I have to say that whoever put this film together has a good idea of what it takes to make a film successful.  I know what it takes to get a film made as I have not only been behind the camera, but also act as lead actor on my films.  The average public doesn't understand the little things that have to come together to get something on camera... I mean, the shceduling, acquiring props, securing vehicles such as trailers, getting music to the editors on time, remembering lines, making sure the actors all show up at the proper day and time...  These are all things that I excell at, but I know how tough it can be for some producers.  The key is to avoid all outside discrations...  And this producer seems to definetly done that.  Kudos to him and everyone that helped put this film together.!",1034208000,2,876,4.409937888198757
1781645,5,B00006JMRQ,"Weeeelllll, I have to give all the credit to the Dyerector....  Beeell, Beell Koning is the Dyerector.  Wahy? You ask?  You wanna know, do ya'?  Watch it for yourself.",1034208000,,167,4.655172413793103
1781646,5,B00006JMRQ,"As you can tell by my nickname, ""Creepy Lee"", I'm a huge horror movie geek.  That means I've seen everything from Nosferatu to Eight Legged Freaks.  What does that mean, I consider myself a little bit of an authority on Horror Movies.  Which means diddly squat, because everyone has there own opinion.  Anyway, we're not here to talk about me.  SILO KILLER is the subject at hand.  And, I have to say fellow fans of the Macbre Cinema, this is a darn fine Horror movie.  It was a welcome relief to see a movie that approached the genre in a LITTLE bit different way than the rest.  I emphasize a LITTLE, because this movie isn't different for the sake of being different.  It's not just trying to be weird or to say, ""Hey look at me"".  I truly feel these film makers just have a little different perspective than the rest of us and it came across with their movie.  This movie gets my full endorsement, but again, that means nothing to you.  Buy it and be the judge yourself.",1034121600,2,974,4.35
1781647,5,B00006JMRQ,"I'm not generally the type of person that gets involved in writing these reviews online, but I felt this movie deserved a plug.  I've watched it the last two nights in a row and it just keeps getting better.  OUTSTANDING MOVIE!",1034121600,,227,4.512195121951219
1781648,5,B00006JMRQ,"I loved this movie! I howled with laughter, I was scared silly, and that Brian Reid is CUTE... Director Koning has a great handle on the horror genre and what is needed to entertain his audience. Good fun and definitely worth adding to one's DVD collection!",1034121600,,257,4.608695652173913
1781649,5,B00006JMRQ,"You know watching hot girls on screen makes any movie worth watching, but when there's a great movie with pretty girls that are wearing next to nothing or nothing then that is something to thank the good lord for.  I wish in real life my back yard was a desert and the girls from this film were there and I didn't have to watch this DVD over and over again to escape from the reality of my back yard is a forest and no girl that doesn't drag her back leg will ever step into it.  Please, make somemore movies like this mr. film makers so my exsistance in my head can carry me through.  Movie deserves 6 stars!",1034035200,,609,4.100840336134453
1781650,5,B00006JMRQ,"I deliver the mail for a living, so believe me when I tell you that when I go home at night I need something to take my mind off the daily grind.  Now, the company therapist has recommended that me and the rest of my co-workers avoid horror movies... But with this one, I couldn't resist.  Great Title, SILO KILLER and tagline ""It's harvest time"".  So, on title and tagline alone I took a chance and was not disappointed.  Yes, yes there was violence and that made me shake in a happy way, but it was deeper than that... The humor...  The emotions... This movie moved me in everyway possible... But the most important thing is it didn't move me towards the local gunsmith and my therapist says that anything that can do that is a good thing.  This movie Rocks!",1034035200,,760,4.3546099290780145
1781651,5,B00006JMRQ,"...and more heart than E.T.  ...More adventure than all 3 Indy films ...More thrills than Jaws ...More laughs than 1941... Wait a minute Shindler's List had more laughs than 1941, but that's not the point.  I'm just trying to say that I have a little experience in the film industry and what I witnessed on my 85 inch flat widescreen last night was the finest achievment  I've seen in film since The Searchers.  Ever since I lost that race to the mentally disabled kid when I was a boy, I vowed that I would someday be the best at something... Well, I was for 20 some odd years, but now it's time to hand over the reigns to a new film maker.  I would sign him to a 3 picture at Dreamworks, but I at least want to be the best within my own company... So, Warner, Sony, MGM, Disney... Let the bidding begin, a wonderful new director who goes by the name Bill Koning is up on the bidding blocks.",1034035200,,892,4.192982456140351
7970496,1,B00006JMRQ,"I feel like a 2nd year college student at a crappy media college could have white balanced the camera better, used the microphone better, used better angles, and easily came up with better effects and music.  I have nothing against low budget movies, but at least know what you're doing before you make a movie for the world to see.",1455062400,,332,4.533333333333333
7970497,5,B00006JMRQ,"I love the first Silo Killer movie and just saw that there is a new DVD version of the original, plus the sequel!  There are lots of special features and it's only $12.99...ordering it right now!",1248220800,,195,4.416666666666667
7970498,3,B00006JMRQ,"""SILO KILLER"" is a fun low budget flick that is definetly worth checking out. there are some very creative things going on in this movie mixed with some decent acting & some bad acting & also a couple of good murder scene's & some very dull & dry murder scene's but all together its a pretty creative & fun little slasher flick with a neat twisty ending! enjoy fellow horror fans!",1100563200,,380,4.366197183098592
7970499,2,B00006JMRQ,"This movie offers nothing new to the horror genre. From reading the other reviews it makes me wonder if we saw the same movie.
It seemed to me somebody found a desolate stretch of land with a few empty buildings and silos around and decided to throw on a cruddy Halloween mask and make a bad slasher flick.
I did give this movie 2 stars. One star for the soundtrack and decent acting. The other star is for the young lady with the massive breasts.
Would I recommend this movie? No.
Will I ever watch this movie again? No.
Will I continue to waste money on bad horror movies waiting to find a diamond in the rough? Yes I will and that's why you don't have to. Don't waste your time with this one. Don't waste your money. Step away from the keyboard.
Go outside and play catch with the neighborhood kids. Trust me.",1062460800,,812,4.279220779220779
7970500,3,B00006JMRQ,"This movie has got two things going for it. Bands and Brandon Malone.  What can I say, not only is this movie good, it's filled with great music, and that hottie Brandon Malone who plays Stu.  Somebody tell me where this guy came from.  What the movie lacks in technicalities, it makes up for in story, dialogue, music, and acting.  Read it here first, this movie rocks, and there's something in it for everyone.  Don't be surprised if these guys make it big (including the bands), and I'll be shocked if we don't see the steamy Brandon Malone in the near future.  Or at least on a billboard somewhere.  Run, don't walk to your nearest video store and pick this movie up.  You won't be disappointed!",1036454400,,699,4.492063492063492
7970501,3,B00006JMRQ,"this movie has many flaws, first of all the charcters seemd to unrealistic and almost fantasy like. The silo killer has the most pansy like punches I have ver seen. The ending was a no brainer, anyone who couldn't figure it out most not be very inteligent. The only reason I liked this movie was because of the Billy Hill charcter. the only reason I bothered to watch this movi because it was released by a company which released my favorite movie Meet the febbles.",1036108800,,465,4.482352941176471
7970502,5,B00006JMRQ,"It's a true joy to see the gang succeed when the odds and adversity predicted otherwise.  The originality and uniqueness of this film will pay for itself. This is a debut for a group that Hollywood deserves. Please help support my friends you won't be disappointed. ""Not bad for some AZ highschool baseball champs.""",1035331200,,315,4.833333333333333
7970503,5,B00006JMRQ,"The largest problem I have found with low budget horror movies is the poor editing.  That's were this movie stands out.  Sure the acting's decent, the musics good, story's ok... But what makes all of those come together is the great editing.  I actually flipped over the box cover to see who put this film together... Can you imagine that, looking for an editor's name on a box cover.  Well, that's how well this was put together.  The gentleman that put it together is Keith Buckingham.  Why do I bother mentioning his name?  Because I also found his name on the box credited with producing, D.P. and scoring the music.  This man can do all that and have time to cut together a film in such brilliant fashion.  I made up a ryhme in honor of this fantastic editor, ""K is Krafty, E is for excellent, I is for Ingenius, T is for Top notch, H is for Heck of a good Editor""",1035244800,,869,4.282208588957055
7970504,5,B00006JMRQ,I loved the film.  It had just enough comedy to make it enjoyable but not to much to make it not scary.  The music was phenomenal...  Where did they get these guys.  I want the soundtrack but I can't find it anywhere.,1034640000,,217,4.095238095238095
7970505,4,B00006JMRQ,"I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. I couldn't believe who the killer was! It had great music, great effects, and was suprisingly funny at times. I especially loved the sheriff and Lyle. It's a must see DVD!",1034640000,,218,4.214285714285714
