5540050,5,B00B04NIC2,"This is a ""must have"" video for anyone who loves the West.  I was thrilled with the quality of the photography and the accompanying narrative.  This Blu-Ray had a great mix of scenery and history, really makes one want to travel to Montana to take it in for themselves.  I've traveling West from Kentucky for two decades and thanks to this purchase I have now put Glacier National Park on the ""A"" list, not that it wasn't close to that before.  I'm mostly a fan of the Southwest desert but it looks like glacier country is next.  If you're planning a trip to Glacier National Park this is well worth your time and money to check out.",1410048000,,633,4.3760683760683765
5540051,2,B00B04NIC2,"The price of this bluray was good when it actually showed scenes of Glacier Park. Here is the problem:  I estimate about ten minutes total were spent looking at humans' faces as they told about the park.  One woman was actually beautiful to look at but I would have rather have them do voice-overs while describing the park.  You will see some of the men and women shown about four or five times on screen and while they do give interesting information about Glacier, we not even seeing the park--in fact, one guy is even inside a building and could have been almost anywhere.

DO NOT BUY THIS BLU-RAY TO SEE HUMANS' MUGS--LOOK FOR ANOTHER ONE ABOUT GLACIER WHERE MORE SCENES ARE OF THE PARK.

Again, outdoor scenes are wonderful but there are not enough of them!",1379980800,,763,4.54014598540146
5540052,5,B00B04NIC2,"Howdy;

There is something about the ""High Country"" that I just love and this shows it in great HD.

What else can I say that I haven't already said in ""Eagle's View"" and others.

Running time is 65 Minutes.

5540053,5,B00B04NIC2,"l love to watch this DVD--it is very calming to watch.  I love the information, and the scientific data, but the beauty of the film is in the breathtaking scenery.  Also, with the daily temperatures at around 94, it makes me forget that it is summertime in Texas.",1375228800,,263,4.458333333333333
5540054,3,B00B04NIC2,"Very dissapointed with this dvd. The quality was not very good but the content was worse. I have seen shows on TV and this park is spectacular. Not on this dvd,they hardly showed the road to the sun which is possibly the most spectacular part of the park. I would not recommend this dvd.",1373673600,6,287,4.333333333333333
5540055,3,B00B04NIC2,They didn't even mention that Glacier was the first Binational Park ever to exist. I would have liked to have seen much more information.,1373155200,,137,4.75
5540056,4,B00B04NIC2,"I wish there were less interviews in it and more just scenes of the park.  Some of the interviews are alright, though.  A neat surprise are old photos of when people were allowed to feed the bears, with tourists apparently enjoying the bears walking right up to their cars as if the bears weren't dangerous at all.

The film made me want to go to the park, but I guess there are more interesting travel films out there.  Not that there aren't a few particularly striking features of this large park.",1369958400,2,499,4.450549450549451
5540057,5,B00B04NIC2,"Birthday present for my partner. We are both outdoor enthusiasts and enjoy travel greatly, especially to National and State Parks. Excellent Blu Ray with an outstanding view into one of our nations greatest natural treasures. A video the entire family will enjoy over and over again!",1454630400,,283,5.173913043478261

5540065,5,B00B04NIC2,"This Blu-ray of Glacier National Park has got to be the best produced video of a national park I have ever seen! It is sharp, and set to music (no narration at all!). I have never visited Glacier NP, but will be there in the fall of 2015. I can't wait to see it!",1419724800,,262,3.8703703703703702

8560199,2,B00B04NIC2,"This was a very low budget and low quality film. I don't understand why they made it a blu-ray, as I don't think very much (if any) of the video footage was high enough quality to warrant a blu-ray. A lot of the shots were taken with shaky camera work, at one point we are looking out of a view that was filmed from a helicopter which would be great, but unfortunately the window of the helicopter was covered in water spots and marks, so it obstructed the vision. The two women they interviewed were the only interviews that I enjoyed. The rest were either rambling, or not interesting. I enjoyed the pieces of older footage they showed, and was happy to see that, so that's why I gave it two starts instead of one. This reminded me of a really bad movie they would make you watch as a elementary school student. They should have done less footage of the person being interviewed, and done more voice over during footage, than they did. I know nothing is as beautiful as Glacier National Park itself, but this really was a let down.",1487894400,,1033,4.385416666666667

8560201,5,B00B04NIC2,A nice series.,1483228800,,14,4.0
8560202,2,B00B04NIC2,"Wow, this is a bad video.  The interviews are disjointed, jumpy and half the time the camera operator is focused on the side of the persons face when they are facing the other direction.  The nature shots are filled with dirty spots on the lenses or a really obvious dirty helicopter window that they are shooting through.  A very amateur production and not recommended at all.  The only good part is this was less than $7 for the blu ray.",1477958400,2,439,4.45
8560203,4,B00B04NIC2,"Good product, buy again if needed.",1470441600,,34,4.833333333333333
8560204,1,B00B04NIC2,"Not the best quality. Disappointing camera work. Stilted narration. The Glacier Blu-ray by Wilderness Video is much better quality, plus you have your choice of three soundtracks--narration (which is better than this one), no narration with just music and natural sounds, and just natural sounds. I returned this.",1468195200,,313,5.541666666666667
