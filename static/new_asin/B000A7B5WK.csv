This review is rather negative of Moira's voice and delivery style because I fully believe if you are going to listen to the DVD to learn the techniques well you will tire of her VERY QUICKLY.

I received the STOTT PILATES Essential Reformer DVD as a gift because it was in my Amazon gift list.  Unfortunately I had forgotten it was there because it is not worth the money.  According to other reviewers she instructs the Pilate's moves very well.  My husband and I found her her diction and voice quite annoying - so much so that we listened to five minutes of the DVD and hit eject.

I cannot imagine watching this DVD with the sound on more than once.  Perhaps we find it annoying because we found Marjolein Brugman first.  She instructs on the AeroPILATES DVDs and is superb.  Marjolein's voice is clear and direct (not breathy and overly soft like Moria).  We have been working out with Marjolein for quite some time now and own five of her DVDs, and have not tired of them or her.",1193616000,6,1137,4.423076923076923

The instructors are great and this DVD is just as good as the live presentations. The best part about the DVD is that you can stop and rewind without holding up the rest of the class! The only advantage the live has over the recorded is that you can have someone put his or her hands on your back or move an arm or a leg into the right position. If you are a person who can learn from seeing, listening and following verbal instructions (no sarcasm intended, some learn better from reading or one-on-one instruction), then with a Stott DVD, will You will be able to figure out where to put your own arm or leg while learning what you need to know to become proficient.",1173657600,10,787,4.360544217687075
