8334995,1,B001Q3L2PC,"Ok, so basically, from my view point, a guy pens the Tao. Rich pro state rulers and hoky idolatry people come in and co-opt the while thing which all stands as a tourist attraction showing the benevolence which supposedly the government possesses. Yea, standard China mindset with a little cool kungfu.  Kind of tragic, I think.. The Tao has so much more potential to chane lives towards good.",1453507200,,393,4.779411764705882
8334996,3,B001Q3L2PC,This was like a cultural program.  I was looking for martial arts movies.  I would recommend for people who like to watch cultural programs.,1407283200,,140,4.791666666666667
8334997,5,B001Q3L2PC,"THIS IS NOT THE NAZI PROPAGANDA FILM! Somehow this page has reviews of that movie. This is a recent production focusing on Wudang Mountain, its history, & Taoism. While it does show many skilled people performing difficult & graceful routines, Martial Arts is not the primary focus. The cinematography, narration, & performers are excellent. I thought the narrator did a great job & didn't distract from the presentation. It is like visiting Wudang without leaving the comfort of your home. I recommend it to anyone: seeking a beautiful travelogue, interested in China, Taoism, or Kung Fu, or who loves incredible scenery.",1390089600,,622,5.1683168316831685

8335000,5,B001Q3L2PC,"Kung Fu and the philosophy of Taoism is presented in a celestial style as I have never seen before.

The filming is OUTSTANDING!! The information was perfectly balanced with the quiet and music.  It can be slightly slow in some areas for some people I am sure, but as someone who enjoys information and pretty images, I was glued even through those parts.

The film takes you into an enchanted realm... really. A must see for all who are interested in spiritual enlightenment.

If you want, you can grab it on Amazon's Createspace for a little less. createspace.___/259008 Use the code: ALLXKLKB for 10 percent off.",1236124800,8,615,4.773584905660377
