8376215,5,B002OMIKQ8,"After arriving at the Plcae Of Celebration, Chagum is chased off by the Egg Eater. The party discovers that they were not at the true Place Of Celebration. The race is on. Everyone races to beat the Egg Eater to Chagum. Tanda discovers a way to kill the Egg Eaters, but even if they can be killed. Will the 9 warriors protecting Chagum be able to fight off dozens of monsters to save Chagum's life. There is more in this volume than just that, but telling it would spoil the awesome ending.

This is a great series. I was not disappointed by single thing in Moribito. It is one of the best anime series I've seen in a long time. I wish that everyone could watch it and get as much enjoyment out of it as I do.",1357862400,2,709,4.13768115942029
8376216,5,B002OMIKQ8,"Moribito finishes with this disk, and the overall feeling that I have toward this series is one of wonder.  From the first episode down to the last one, Moribito has shown that the serious side of anime still exists and that it hasn't been overrun with the all-too-many clones of cliches that litter the isles of anime shops everywhere.  With its slow pacing and emphasis on character development, Moribito has changed my perception of what a fantasy anime has to be.  This is more akin to The Twilight Samurai, than Bleach or Naruto...and that's alright with me.

The way that they implemented the fantasy side into the story really caught me by surprise as I was never beaten over the head with it.  In contrast, the fantasy almost blended into the background, never overwhelming the main story and actually it benefited from that treatment.  Once we delve deeper into the ending, we really see that the forces of nature are more treacherous than any spell weaving could ever be.

Will everyone enjoy Moribito as I, and many others have?  Not really.  There are literally six fight scenes in the whole entire series, and to some that want more action over substance, this might be irritating.  But what there is in action is definitely top notch.

Even so, the best thing about this series is the main relationship between Balsa and Prince Chagum.  Her loyalty and honor to her charge, Chagum, is so endearing that you wish they spent some more time dealing with this part of the story.  Chagum's transformation from highly prince to country commoner and his obstacles in understanding his new surroundings under Balsa's guidance was the true heart of the story.

And once you get that Moribito is really about the story of a boy and a warrior trying to live and understand, you really start to appreciate the wonderful story and its message.

Overall, you can't go wrong with this.  If you are at a point in your life where teenage ninjas, and giant robots are getting too obnoxiously similar, Moribito can give you substance and a little peace of mind that anime isn't dead yet.  Trust me, this one is worth it.",1267056000,2,2115,4.7193460490463215
8376217,5,B002OMIKQ8,Listen up people! This was an excellent series from the first disk to the last. Gorgeous animation and good characterization make this series a must have in my book.,1264809600,,165,4.724137931034483
