I know there were at least three movies in the series, maybe four, starring Alex McArthur. Someone please put these on dvd!",1327363200,7,282,4.775510204081633

7861161,5,6303984207,"The movie Return Of The Desperado on VHS. If you can find a copy it's worth viewing. The storyline moves slowly,however there are numerous action scenes. I bought a used copy which because of age was difficult to watch, but it was still worth watching. I was quickly able to resell it, as I advertised it with an honest description. I hope they re-release it on dvd sometime soon.",1278806400,10,380,4.521739130434782
