My son passed away in 2002 and i just could not laugh again so i thought. My cousin let me look at this a couple of days after his funeral, she was a elderly lady and her daughter brought it down from up north. She thought it might cheer me up. Wisdom is every thing. She was right. This is what i prescribe to people here in Louisville, MS who has lost love ones. They always say thanks, they sometimes never know about his plays.

4579328,2,B0055OTDCM,"I chose this rating for a number of reasons.

1.) I understand Tyler Perry is trying to send positive messages, but I'm ready for something new. All of his plays are too similar. He recycles some of the same jokes and I even heard some jokes off of Martin.

2.) I think Tamar is a great actress, but she annoyed the BLANK out of me. I understand she's playing the role of a sixteen year old girl but she was a little too extra for me; whining and complaining.

3.)I I'm sick of seeing the same people in plays. I wanna see a fresh (talented) face.",1392940800,,547,4.1415094339622645
4579329,3,B0055OTDCM,"Good play.  Not up to the usual Tyler Perry movie standard.  i believe that is becauae it was  a recording of a play.  DVD paused at different monments for no apparent reasons.  I enjoyed the story anyway.

This play is awesome and reminiscent of the true community experience. The bond between between the neighbors reminds me of the neighborhood I grew up in. The music is incredible, Cheryl Pepsi Riley, outstanding, D'Atra Hicks, magnificent. For those of you that enjoyed this play, I also recommend ""Marriage Counselor"". ""Laugh To Keep From Crying"" is truely one of those plays you watch that will quickly lift you out of a spirit of depression and is hilarious.
