8004724,4,B0000Z804S,"Wow, what an awesome DVD.  This DVD features Mark Boals (ex-Yngwie Malmsteen) and his band, Ring of Fire, which features one very impressive line-up.  On guitar is Tony MacApline (who is currently playing 2nd banana in Steve Vai's band, don't ask me why either), Virgil Donati on drums (stellar drummer who coincidentally is currently in Steve Vai's band also), Artension mainstay Vitalji Kuprij on keyboards and bassist Philip Bynoe.

Ring of Fire are performing in a small Japanese club, in support of their 1st album, Oracle.  While almost the entire album is performed live, Mark also had a solo album a couple of years earlier, called Ring of Fire, in which the band draw their name from, and several tunes from that solo album are performed here live.  There are no shortages of songs, in fact 14 songs are performed plus everyone (including Mark Boals) gets a solo spot.

Everyone's performance is top-notch, and just to watch these musicians together on stage performing with one another is a delight unto itself.  Mark Boals has surrounded himself with an all-star line-up who undoubtedly delivers the goods. As far as the quality goes, it's excellent.  The audio is crisp and clear, the video is superior, and the camera work and editing are masterfully done. The crowd noise and excitement on the other hand are lame, there really isn't any applause between songs, and I thought that kind of sucked.  But oh well it's Japan, what do you expect.  Anyone who has seen live concerts from Japan knows the crowds are lame (i.e. Dokken live in Japan 1995, Mr. Big farewell tour).  But despite this flaw, the DVD is worth owning if you are into Mark Boals music or are a big fan of any of his band members.",1096070400,5,1710,4.743243243243243
