3764694,1,B001QFFB70,I agree with Robert Horton's review under the amazon.com Editorial Review section. Save your money and find another film to sit through.,1244764800,,136,5.2272727272727275
3764695,2,B001QFFB70,"""Nobel Son"" (2008), a comedic dramatic crime thriller, was written, produced, directed and edited by Randall Miller, who might also have done the on-site catering, for all I know.  The film does boast a number of stars, and does give some older ones jobs.

Brit Alan Rickman, (the Harry Potter movies,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sweeney-Todd-The-Demon-Barber-of-Fleet-Street/dp/B0013D8LOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</a>) evidently a very valuable man on a film site, plays the lead as Eli Michaelson, a chemistry professor at a California university who's just, for reasons of getting the plot going, we must assume, been awarded a Nobel Prize.  Rickman turns in one of his patented performances here, creating a truly dislikable character, egotistical, skirt-chasing, dishonest, nasty, and sarcastic. Mary Steenburgen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nixon-A-Presidency-Revealed/dp/B000OIOPPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nixon - A Presidency Revealed</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Grass-Harp/dp/B0007P0XAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Grass Harp</a>) plays Sarah, his long-suffering psychotherapist wife.  Her real-life husband Ted Danson (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Becker-The-First-Season/dp/B0012EM5DS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Becker - The First Season</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cheers-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B00008NV4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cheers - The Complete First Season</a>&nbsp;) has a cameo as Harvey Parrish, a fellow academic of Eli's.  Bryan Greenberg (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bride-Wars/dp/B001TUZD8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bride Wars</a>) plays Eli's eminently forgettable son Barkley, laboring over his master's thesis.  Danny De Vito (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Kahuna/dp/B000092T3R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Kahuna</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/L-A-Confidential/dp/B001CN2WXM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">L.A. Confidential</a>) plays George Gastner, an obsessive-compulsive whom Sarah treats.  The lovely Eliza Dushku (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dollhouse-Season-One/dp/B0024FAR66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dollhouse: Season One</a>)  plays son Barkley's love interest, young female poetess City Hall, a thankless part that forgets no stereotype of what a young poetess might be.  Shawn Hatosy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cooler/dp/B0001EFV7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cooler</a>)  plays Thaddeus James, a nutter, who, wouldn't you know it, kidnaps Eli's son Barkley for a ransom of $2 million, exactly the amount of the Nobel Award, just as Eli and Sarah are taking off for Scandinavia, and the biggest night of their lives.  How thoughtless, inconsiderate, and inconvenient of him, indeed.  Bill Pullman (""Lake Placid"") will play Detective Max Mariner; Ernie Hudson  (""Ghostbusters"") will play Sgt. Bill Canega, cops who are brought in to search for Barkley.

The presence of both Steenburgen and Danson in the film leaves me wondering if they produced it for themselves and their friends.  Nevertheless, the acting's reasonably good.  I would have been happy to see more of the comely Dushku, more face time, that is, not more skin: there's plenty of that on view.  The movie plays as if writer/director Miller made lists of various old plot devices, and wrote his script, one from Column A, one from Column B.  The soundtrack, of already dated techno, could deafen the dead.  Save yourself the ear ache.",1244332800,3,3869,8.039906103286384
3764696,5,B001QFFB70,"This movie is a very fast moving plot with lots of twists and turns that sometimes leaves you unsure of what just happened. In the end though it all comes together and is really quite entertaining. Alan Rickman is convincing as a self centered, egotistical and boorish nobel prize winner who is soon embroiled in a kidnapping plot. Family loyalties are tested and  priorities examined.  Mary Steenburgen is perfect as Rickman's wife who has to endure his personality flaws while dealing with the brutal kidnapping of their son.  Things aren't as they seem though and the ending is a surprise. Definitely worth a watch.",1241308800,11,618,4.923076923076923

3764698,1,B001QFFB70,"Shame on Alan Rickman for involving himself in this mess!

The movie started off okay, but I was totally distracted by the awful techno music that played NON-STOP, no matter what the mood of the scene. Then the plot just got more and more ridiculous, the acting more and more terrible, and the music NEVER ended (in fact, it got worse). The people who gave this movie more than one star must really like their techno... Instead of watching this movie, just go to the local dance club and seek out the most obnoxious d-bag you can find. Then stand there listening to him for two hours while the repetitive electric music beats at your eardrums. That might actually be a more enjoyable experience than sitting through this utterly predictable and RIDICULOUS waste of time.

Even with the stupid plot twists and bad acting, this movie might have earned a couple of stars if not for the terrible soundtrack/sound direction and editing (like the horrible swooshing sounds when they oh-so-dramatically show people moving in fast forward and then rewind and then fast forward again...lame!). If this movie had been quiet, it would have made for a much more eerie experience and perhaps I might have given a fig about at least ONE of the characters.

I give it zero stars, but Amazon is forcing me to give it one.",1238889600,4,1305,4.689956331877729
3764699,4,B001QFFB70,"It twists and turns and requires some attention (not for the slow of mind) to more than the obvious! Got lots of the Pulp Fiction speed and intensity with a little sex and gore which manages not to overpower the plot - it's bound for cult classic following.

For his legions of fans - Rickman never disappoints and this is no exception, smart, smarmy and sarcasm to spare!  He has an excellent supporting cast of characters that unveil this deliciously twisted thriller in patchwork vignettes which are ultimately assembled for the final reveal!  Made me want to immediately see it again to ""catch"" the details I missed the first time around.

Definitely worth the watch...and I will watch it again!",1238630400,2,699,4.8
3764700,1,B001QFFB70,"This movie was just completely ridiculous and stupid. There were two good things in it. One was the performance of Alan Rickman and the other was seeing Duschkue (sp?) in various stages of undress. It was full of plot holes and things that just didn't make sense. One example a guy that can put an entire car together in an hour. And then the reason he did was totally stupid as when the remote control car was driven thru the wall he could have simply took the bag out of the hatch and drove the same car out of the store. There was no reason to have the second car or to have to put it together like they did.
This movie was just dumb.",1237766400,,637,4.104
3764701,4,B001QFFB70,"When I first watched this, the difficulty rested in how to categorize this legitimately. We have action, a little gore, lots of plot twists, suspense, thriller, dark comedy and a little bit of sex. So I say it gets it all, and with a nice cast to boot.

Alan Rickman is great once again and plays one of the more despicable characters I have seen him fulfill. He is cast as the adulterous professor/Nobel Prize winner that finds his son kidnapped/ransomed for the money he will be receiving. His adulterous wife (sublime yet believable in Steenburgen) tags along all whilst the detective (Pullman) tracks the strange truths and twists of the case. Eliza Dushku plays an R role, and the rest of the cast gives some fun performances, especially from Hatosy and even a little part for Devito.

The quality of the DVD and the 5.1 are adequate, with plenty of featurettes/deleted scenes that help show the production's back story and missing parts. A worthwhile film that has gotten little press, and even less distribution. Hope you enjoy a fun, plot twisting film that can be appreciated up to the last scene.",1237766400,20,1106,4.755208333333333
3764702,4,B001QFFB70,"First, the summary on the back of the case is inaccurate. Second, there are a couple of squeamish bits. One is quite graphic - involving the uh, taking of a thumb; the other, also involving body parts, is quite shocking, but is later ... er ... mitigated.

Rickman is wonderful as a self-important, philandering professor. The plot is wonderfully puzzling, and, for all its twistedness, not lacking in humanity or heart.

And that's all I can say about that.",1237593600,8,458,4.784810126582278
3764703,4,B001QFFB70,"Have you ever randomly picked a vacation destination by spinning a globe with your eyes closed? The plot of ""Nobel Son"" works in much the same way; it spins and spins its tangled web and can end up here or there or anywhere. It's all at once a brutal dark comedy and an engrossing mystery, and it teases both the characters and the audience along with a series of deceptions and revelations and twists. This is no small task considering the demented nature of the main character's PhD thesis, which somehow forms a connection between cannibalism and a Game Boy system; it acts as a sort of thematic umbrella, under which lies a twisted story of human nature, specifically in matters of making sure certain people get what they deserve. Yes, I'm describing a very broad concept, and I admit that it doesn't do an adequate job explaining what this movie is about. But to be perfectly honest, I don't think I can give you an in-depth plot synopsis, partly because the details are difficult to sort out, but mostly because a description might spoil a number of pivotal moments.

I can, however, give you a vague idea. Let's begin with Eli Michaelson (Alan Rickman), who may in fact be one of the meanest, most unlikable characters of any film this decade. He's a Chemistry teacher with an ego that sprawls out even farther than the Periodic Table of Elements. He thinks he's better than his colleagues. He isn't kind to his wife, a forensic psychologist named Sarah (Mary Steenburgen); truth be told, he cheats on her at every possible opportunity. He certainly can't cut his son a break, an eager doctorate student named Barkley (Bryan Greenberg).

One day, Eli learns that he's won the Nobel Prize. Unfortunately, Barkley is kidnapped on the day of his father's flight to Sweden. Naturally, his father doesn't believe that he's been kidnapped when the kidnapper, an insane car junkie named Thaddeus James (Shawn Hatosy), allows him to speak on the phone. But as Eli and Sarah are escorted back to their hotel after the ceremony, they open a package and discover a severed human thumb. That's when Thaddeus names his terms: $2 million in exchange for Barkley's life.

To describe any more of the plot would be pointless. Needless to say, nothing is what it seems, and just about everyone has something to hide. Take Sarah, whose training allows her to deconstruct things so thoroughly that it's virtually impossible to get anything past her. She remains mostly passive about her husband's appalling behavior throughout most of the film, although there's a sense that she knows him better than he knows himself. There's a quiet but interesting moment between her and Max Mariner (Bill Pullman), the detective assigned to Barkley's case; she hopes that the severed thumb belongs to her son, because if it doesn't, that means the kidnapper is dangerously methodical.

As for Mariner, he seems to know that something about Barkley's situation isn't quite right. He goes from place to place, interviewing everyone who might know something. One of these people is the next-door neighbor, Gastner (Danny DeVito), a recovering obsessive-compulsive. Another person is City Hall (Eliza Dushku), who Barkley met at a poetry reading at the local bookstore. I honestly don't know what to make of her, and her name is certainly of no help. Then again, given the nature of the plot, one may not have to understand her. One look at her apartment is enough to unsettle even the darkest of minds. She's an artist with a lot of baggage, all of which carries over into her work. Paintings cover a lot of wall space, and they're all nothing more than muddy smears of color.

And then there's Thaddeus. Why on earth would he kidnap the son of a Nobel Prize winner? All I can say is that he has his reasons. When we first meet him, everything is clear-cut in his mind; he has a plan, and he intends to follow it to a tee. But then he kidnaps Barkley, and almost immediately, nothing is clear-cut anymore. Plans change. New lies are concocted. Alliances are formed and then broken. As is the case with City Hall, trying to understand Thaddeus is most likely unnecessary. Even though he explains himself, what motivates him is not as important as what he does.

I'm now realizing that this review has been annoyingly vague. But unless you want me to spoil the whole thing, I don't have much of a choice. Not that it matters a great deal; the mystery in this film is so bizarre and meandering that it's really nothing more than a distortion of someone's perception. Part of the fun was not knowing which direction the plot would go in, which is to say that I was continuously surprised all throughout. ""Nobel Son"" is an odd but engaging film that indirectly analyzes human behavior and the consequences it can bring. It's also a wonderful vehicle for Alan Rickman, who can play nasty like few actors I've seen in a long time. What a deplorable man his character is, so unfeeling, so arrogant, so greedy. There's never a moment when you don't wish that something horrible would happen to him. He actually makes Ebenezer Scrooge seem downright pleasant. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that he never won the Nobel Prize.",1229385600,17,5200,4.746681415929204
3764704,4,B001QFFB70,"I give 4 stars as for me the plot ""twists"" seem to come too out of left field for my taste. I prefer a bit more context and the jumps felt like a storyline interruption rather than an interesting connection of inter-weaving plotline. Otherwise it is a pretty good time. And any movie that has Alan Rickman is worth the watch. His character is completely repulsive in this story. The susension of belief in this story is why Mary Steenbergens wife character bothered with him at all. Overall I enjoyed the movie & would recommend it.",1464566400,,532,4.552083333333333

Danny Devito is wonderful as the OCD neighbor and you really do like him in spite of his quirks, or because of them.

I'm surprised by how much some folks seem to dislike this one here and on Rotten Tomatoes, especially as it's pretty clearly a dark lampoon that never takes itself too seriously. The script, while occasionally too clever by half, has many memorable lines and moments and enables the actors here to deliver some nice performances. Rickman is as ever a very good bad guy, and Hatosy is the pick of the rest, really getting inside his character and making his scenes crackle a little brighter.

But they all get short shrift about 80 minutes in, when the movie goes from goofy to sheer silliness. Nothing wrong with either of those things, but there are so many plot twists in such little time that it gets tangled up like a poorly cast fishing line, and it's easy to lose track of the lure. If the entire last thirty minutes had been cut this might be a really fine little thriller. Then again, it's the weirdness/unporedictability of it all that distinguishes the film, so maybe it's just as well they weren't.

All I know is that while Nobel Son is far from perfect, it entertained me in many ways, surprised me in many others, and all in all was a truly unique film, for better and worse. The techno part of the soundtrack is suitably aggressive and pulsating, and it's nice to hear Oakenfold apply his sonic edge to a full OST (his cd Tranceport is one of the classic trance mixes, btw, well worth checking out if you dig his work here). If you like any of these actors, or just enjoy not knowing what's coming next or even what just happened, Nobel Son should keep your brain busy.",1297728000,,1595,4.493103448275862

There is truly nothing redeeming in his professor.  He uses people, treats them shabbily and moves on with no growth from one disastrous liaison to the next.  That he gets his final comeuppance is a relief.

If you enjoy watching Rickman work, as I do, this is worthwhile.  The story is painfully unrelieved for the most part--not exactly edifying, but Rickman always makes whatever piece he is in worthwhile, for me, at least.  This is not a ""fun"" movie.  It is the story of one of the most selfish of men and no one looks very good in it.  Dark, and stultifyingly constrained.  The ""black comedy"" is heavy-handed.

Steenburgen, Greenberg, and Hatosy gave fine performances--Hatosy coming up with licks that I hadn't seen from him before.  And as a Wes alum, I like following Joss Whedon's work as well.  There are many reasons for recommending this piece.  Entertainment is not one of them.  Art and technical work come closer to the mark.",1295913600,,1106,4.870967741935484

Instead, his son is kidnapped and held for ransom for that exact amount.

This is a perfect indie film with a bizarre script with endless twists and turns, excellent actors in quirky, often off-putting roles, a loud, funky soundtrack, and a pace that's so quick you'll need to see the movie twice to absorb it all.  The ensemble cast is headed by Alan Rickman at his sarcastic best, wallowing happily in his role as a heartless husband and father.  He's wonderful.  Steenburgen's role is never fully explained; why would she stay married to such a beast?  Bill Pullman is great as the cop who investigates the kidnapping.  He's sympathetic, professional, and ultra-creepy all at the same time.  Bryan Greenberg is good as the kidnap victim.  Danny de Vito and Ted Danson round out the cast in small parts.

3764732,3,B001QFFB70,"Grad student Barkley Michaelson (Bryan Greenberg) is getting his PhD in cannibalism - not for actually eating his fellow man, mind you, but for studying those who do.  This choice of topic doesn't sit very well with his dad, a hateful, arrogant college professor who's just been awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry and who wants his son to carry on his legacy after he`s gone.  Unfortunately, as Professor Eli Michaelson is over in Stockholm gracelessly accepting his award, Barkley is back home in Pasadena being held for ransom by a crazed kidnapper.  This is the setup for ""Nobel Son,"" an Oedipal drama done in the form of a smart-alecky, wisecracking pitch dark comedy.  Acting stalwarts Mary Steenburgen, Shawn Hatosy, Bill Pullman, Danny DeVito and Ted Danson round out the cast.

If there's one thing a filmmaker can't fake, it's ""coolness"" - yet that's the one thing writer/director Randall Miller keeps working so hard to achieve in ""Nobel Son,"" a movie that too often comes across as a poor-man's version of Quentin Tarentino.  Yet, despite that derivativeness, the movie's frenetic style - a mixture of razzle-dazzle camera and editing techniques, snarky black humor, and a pounding rock soundtrack - reveals that Miller has some real potential as a filmmaker.  And a series of nifty plot twists in the final third go a long way towards mitigating any misgivings one may have harbored about the movie earlier on.",1262995200,,1425,4.987341772151899

Having Alan Rickman as the grumpy old man, who gets what he has coming to him, is a great casting decision. Eliza Dushku is also very good in her role.",1255392000,3,279,4.490196078431373

Good grief, I've sat through some bad movies before, but this was downright painful to watch. I gave up after 30 minutes, and put the DVD back in the case....permanently. Good thing I got it on sale.
