Steve Trovato's DVD is pretty solid and you can learn some cool technique in a country style BUT there's some things you have to know before you buy!
First off, this DVD is not for beginners! I am a decently advanced player and haven't really got into country stuff until recently (The styles I explore are generally associated with rock, jazz, blues, psychedelic, shoe-gazey type of stuff) and some of these licks are quite difficult. As mentioned in one of the other reviews, for each Segment/Section Steve first plays his licks at his normal speed, which is quite fast, and then goes on to break it down in a very slow manner. TOO SLOW and as mentioned NOT to a metronome. This is a real pisser when you're trying to figure out how to play a certain phrase because you are not sure which beat each of the specific notes fall on. You really have to just sit there and use your ear, which can be ok for more advanced guys but I could see this being quite difficult for intermediate/beginner guys.
Second, as you can see on the cover of the DVD it says, ""Week 1."" There's a mediocre amount of content on this ""Week 1"" DVD, but the dude could have put WAY more content on each DVD. There isn't enough content for 20 bucks which is why I gave it 4 stars. Now I'm irritated because he has reeled me in and now I want to buy all 6 DVDs... which is says something in itself.... Grrrrrrr....
One more thing! This DVD does not really get into the music theory behind what he is playing. He shows you some of the different positions of the major pentatonic scale and how in country music they add a certain note to the major pentatonic scale, ""The Minor 3rd,"" which he calls the ""Country Note."" And he also talks about ""resolving to the tonic"" but thats it. This could be a good thing or bad thing depending on who you are and what you are trying to learn.
All in all a cool DVD.",1442361600,,1889,4.308988764044944
8397379,2,B003IHOQVG,"I must differ with the other reviewers; I did not think much of this set of lessons. And I have great regard for Steve's teaching ability and other books, etc., in fact it was because I enjoyed his Chuck Berry lick DVD that I sprung the $100 for this series.  But here is why I rated it so poorly:

1. It looks like he just had some studio time and cranked the whole thing out in a sitting (honestly at least change your shirt from one session to the next).  This is not a comprehensive course but a series of basic country techniques strung out over 6 DVDs.  I think a book like Koch's ""Country Guitar"" gives much more material and in a more systematic way and at a fraction of the cost. This DVD series does not cover Banjo rolls, Carter picking, etc. etc.
2. There is very little content on each DVD.  DVD 1 has G pentatonic scale in 2 positions, how to combine them and a few bars of example riffs. Basically that's about it, and the other DVDs have the same limited amount of material. You do not learn any songs.  I guess it is supposed to be a weeks worth of content.
3. It is a Lick Library product which means no on screen charts, no book or anything.  I think the difficulty with the material in part is due to trying to teach scales without being able to show them on screen.  Lick Library is great for just that, licks.
4. Yes it happens to be the only country DVD game in town, but compared to something like Steve Krenz's Blues Guitar class (also about $100), there is just no comparison.  Krenz must have put hundreds of hours into it, worked with a band, utilizes workshops, interviews with blues greats, etc etc..

So if you want to learn a little county and you have the cash to drop, go for it.  Steve is a really personable guy, a great talent and conveys things well.  I just wish with all that ability and knowledge a course at this price would have included a bit more of it.",1351900800,5,1898,4.212707182320442
8397380,5,B003IHOQVG,"I took the pludge and bought all 6 weeks of Steve's Country Guitar lessons. I believe it was a good investment. In each DVD, Steve  examines the major pentatonic scale, takes you through it note by note and expands on it with a solo or two. Again taking breaking it down note for note. The lessons are progressive so by the time you reach lesson 6, he tries to incorporate all the previous lessons in a solo. Each DVD includes a jam track for you to pracice what you have learned. This is very helpful and fun. In the end you learn that solos are about scales. The lesson on pedal steel bends and lesson six were the most interesting to me. The fifth lesson I found the least interesting. In the end, I did learn and had fun.",1349568000,4,725,4.215827338129497
8397381,5,B003IHOQVG,"I am an intermediate to advanced guitarist.  Played for about 25 years, with last 3 serious.  This set is not for beginners, but is perfect for an intermediate rock guitarist that wants to learn country style quickly.  If you don't know anything about guitar you will have trouble, but for someone who knows basic guitar it is very worthwhile.  Steve is not going to show you how to hold your pick and how to fret a note, but there are better lick library DVDs for that if that is what you need.  He shows you licks based upon scales and explains why they work.  The value is that you can extrapolate the techniques to build your own soloing phrases.  You realize why country guitar sounds they way it does, and for me it expanded my abilities exactly as I had hoped.  Very good teacher, but essentially better suited for intermediate players.",1335139200,,843,4.5364238410596025
8397382,4,B003IHOQVG,"I've been working on 4 of the 6 DVDs. They are quite challenging. I'll just review the first 4 DVDs here and not jump around, because the comments are pretty general. This guy knows a lot, but from my perspective either he's a great teacher that puts the onus on you, or he's not that great a teacher. As I stated he makes you figure stuff out on your own, very much like a college professor and most of what I say is going to be negative because I am going to do my best to defend this position. I'm not sure the reason that profs are this way, it may be because the course they are teaching is so intuitive to them, while the rest of us come to class to learn subjects that are not intuitive to us. The first CD teaches some G licks in the style of Vince Gill. High speed licks that I've been working on for about 6 months. I'm starting over on these licks now with a metronome. Unfortunately with the DVD you can't slow down the playing. He shows the licks full speed then breaks them down to a slow speed, but the slow speed licks are not done with a metronome beat  or a backing track. He counts off the beats, but once he starts playing, I feel like he's all over the place. So I never get a sense of the dynamics. The second DVD is Allman brother stuff. Again neat stuff, I enjoyed this a lot, but again especially with some of the runs it would really help if he'd do some simple playing over a metronome or a beat. So it's either at instruction speed with no metronome or backing or full speed.... it's hard for me to get things locked in. Number 3 is Eagles, real fun. Pretty straight forward. Number 4 is Roy Buchanan stuff. It's funny the way he starts talking about scales doesn't really talk about what key he's in until later. He takes his time with the Pentatonic scale (after having gone over these in detail on other tracks) then jumps into the blues scale with not much discussion as if you should know this scale off the top of your head. Fortunately it was easy to find on the internet. Overall: Real frustrating in a lot of places, but what I feel like I am getting more than compensated for the frustration with what I am learning. It's neat to finally understand what the country boys are doing and realize that there are some really neat sequences to what they are doing. Also, in a lot of ways I feel like I'm going back 30 years ago to my college days when professors used to blow things past you and made you feel so stupid. In Mr. Tovato's defense, we aren't sitting in class together and I'm not able to give him feedback on what I need to make this work better for me. So would I buy these again? For sure... they're fun and I'm learning how to figure out stuff he doesn't tell me, perhaps this was his goal to give just enough to make me figure it out myself. Hope this helps...",1320883200,11,2810,4.1749539594843466
8397383,5,B003IHOQVG,"FINALLY someone has made a country guitar DVD series that I can actually use!  I'm an intermediate lead guitarist who has tried on many occasions to find a country lead DVD that is on my level and that can actually improve my playing.  I've even tried a couple of Steve's other DVD's, but they were a little over my head in the speed department.  I have tried so many ""licks"" DVD's and books and they haven't helped me much at all, but I've finally found what I'm looking for in the Country Guitar in 6 Weeks series.  I am only through the first three weeks, but I'm already about ten times better than I was at country lead guitar and I am confidently predicting that I'll be even better after the next three DVD's.  Steve takes you through each week's lesson in progressive steps, and each week is completely different than the week before, yet they all tie in together when you start soloing.  BUY THIS SERIES OF DVD'S if you are an intermediate guitarist looking to improve your country lead playing.  You will not be disappointed.  Thank you, Steve!",1291852800,9,1054,4.510526315789473
