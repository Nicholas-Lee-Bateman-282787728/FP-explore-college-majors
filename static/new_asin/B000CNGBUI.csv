8099722,2,B000CNGBUI,"well abt this dvd the story is perfect,but voice actors,specially Christopher R. Sabat sucks,yamcha sounds like a loser and vegeta sounds like a smoker,but the other one which was edited that was released a longtime ago, which wasn't uncut,in that all the voices are damn perfect,vegeta sounds like a royal prince in that.and yamcha sounds good.in this new uncut version goku's voice is cool,and gohan doesn't sound like a kid,rather like a 12 year old boy,and explosions are not hardcore(sound)even though its 5.1 surround the old edited version has more movie like explosive sounds,overall i do not recommend any of these uncut dbz dvd's,but from  episode 054, though its uncut the voices are ok.",1153612800,3,698,5.12280701754386
