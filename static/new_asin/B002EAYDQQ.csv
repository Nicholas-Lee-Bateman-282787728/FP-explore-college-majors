8367290,3,B002EAYDQQ,"Warner Brothers was no slouch in the 30's when it came to musicals and this was planned to be a big one. two of Hollywood's biggest stars, with Gable on one of those costly loans from another studio (MGM) and a good bunch of Warner's contract players. The song team of Harry Warren & Al Dubin (42nd Street, Lullaby of Broadway) were brought on board. Busby Berkeley was originally planned for the choreography but he backed out and Bobby Connelly took his place. no expense was spared for sets and costumes. In fact the pre-publicity made a big deal about the studio having to raise an already huge soundstage 35 feet in able to encompass the huge dance number set. William Randolph Hearst paid for that and he seems to have had some influence on the film itsself.

Marion Davies and Clark Gable had been paired before in the silly but successful Polly of the Circus (1932), in which she, a trapeze performer falls for a minister. There they had some chemistry, which is sorely lacking here. They meet oddly through the same device Fred and Ginger used in Top Hat in 1935: she's doing a late night tap dancing number in the hotel room above his and this leads to immediate mutual loathing. And why is she tap dancing? Well, she had been a waitress until she was hired as the lead of a Broadway show even though she was not a singer or dancer because the leading man had played a joke on her. Everything that happens in this film is as unconvincing and unbelievable as that and it only gets worse as the film goes on. The fact was that Marion Davies herself was neither a singer nor a dancer yet she was thrown into this role where she's supposed to be so dazzling at both that she wows Broadway.

Then there is the big musical number, a two-part extravaganza of Coney Island and I'll Sing You a Thousand Love Songs, an experience you'll never forget, though not in the usual way. Coney Island is at least a comedy number where wax figures of Napoleon and the Smith Brothers come to life. The second number, which interpolates several songs including the Wedding March from Lohengrin and Shadow Waltz between its beginning and end is the very definition of static and gargantuan. With enormous all-white sets and elaborate costumes (mostly 18th century) marion is featured smiling in historic costumes while people sort of dance and move below her and on the periphery. The effect is more like a tableau than a dance number. Didn't they study Berkeley's numbers? They're all action and motion. This is where I think Hearst's influence came in. His taste was all for grandeur and effect and rather old fashioned and stuffy as well and that is what this number is like: big and grand and ostentatious and boring as all get out. And it overwhelms poor Marion.

The film is still interesting, even as a misfire. Walter Catlett is fun as the Broadway producer and Roscoe Karns is his usual acerbic self though after a while a bit too much. You do get a rare chance to see a slim Pert Kelton as the temperamental lead actress who quits the show, looking so far from the role she is most remembered for as Mrs. Paroo in The Music Man. Cain and Mabel isn't all bad but it's not what it should have been.",1474416000,,3194,4.503448275862069

8367294,4,B002EAYDQQ,"This movie is the brainchild of William Randolph Hearst to boost the film career of his mistress Marion Davies, and he persuaded Jack Warner to hire the services of Clark Gable from MGM studios. Davies starts as a waitress and turn herself into a star of a musical, and Gable stars as the heavyweight boxing champion. When they meet, the relationship is a little sour and even hostile but as the movie progresses, they fall in love. The romance is engineered by newspaper man Roscoe Karns to create a public image for both Davies and Gable. At the end they realize that they truly love each other and get rid of associated publicity to become private couples.

Gable offers his usual performance and Marion Davies is magnificent. The musical numbers are by Al Dubin and Harry Warren and it was staged by Bobby Connolly. In spite of collective effort, the movie was not a success. But it has many likable songs that include Coney Island, and Here comes Chiquita.",1416355200,,961,4.686390532544379

Cain and Mabel may have its flaws but it entertained me nevertheless. True, the plot isn't the most convincing I've ever seen but as a piece of lighthearted fare it doesn't rank too badly especially with the likes of Marion Davies and Clark Gable starring in it. The plot moves along well without being too fast or too slow and the sets, choreography and cinematography do reflect good forethought. The musical numbers are not the best but they also aren't the worst. I also liked what one reviewer refers to as the ""snappy"" dialogue.

When the action starts, we meet Mabel O'Dare (Marion Davies) who is a waitress at Champs Restaurant. She sympathizes with down and out, wanna-be publicist Reilly (Roscoe Karns) and serves him eggs and potatoes when another customer doesn't want them. Unfortunately for Mabel, however, this starts a fight between Reilly and the owner of Champs and Mabel is fired, much to her chagrin not to mention the disappointment of her Aunt Mimi (Ruth Donnelly) and family friend Charles Fendwick (E.E. Clive).

However, Reilly hatches a plan. (And yes, just as others say this is where you have to suspend belief in order to follow the plot) Reilly takes Mabel to get her a part in a show that the famous Jake Sherman (Walter Catlett) is putting on Broadway, ""Words and Music."" The show's leading male star Ronny Cauldwell (Robert Paige) pretends to be Jake Sherman (whom Reilly claims falsely to know)--and Ronny not only gives Mabel a part in the show--he gives her the lead as a gag! But it isn't all that funny when Mabel and Reilly show up the next day for rehearsal and the real Jake Sherman doesn't want anything to do with Mabel even as his female star Toddy (Pert Kelton) quits. Needless to say (ahem), Mabel, without any experience, gets the leading female role with us once again having to suspend belief in order to follow along!

As Mabel and the others rehearse, they occupy the hotel suite directly above the one in which boxing champ Larry Cain (Clark Gable) and his pals/assistants Dodo (Allen Jenkins) and ""Pop"" Walters (William Collier Sr.) are trying to get some sleep the night before a big boxing match. And the fighting between Larry and Mabel starts fast when Mabel and Larry clash!

The rest of the plot shows what happens when both Larry and Mabel are good at what they do but they just aren't quite famous enough to draw in big crowds. Reilly builds up a fake publicity romance between Larry and Mabel even though they can't stand each other--and the rest of the film shows how all of the issues play out. In addition, I agree with people who observe that the film doesn't take full advantage of Marion Davies and Clark Gable's star power to make this a truly special film but it's no flop.

Look also for Hobart Cavanaugh as Milo; Sammy White performing in the ""Coney Island"" musical number; Charles Teske as another specialty dancer; Robert Middlemass as the caf proprietor; Allen Pomeroy as Reed and Joseph Crehan as Reed's manager. Look closely and you'll see Marie Provost as Jake Sherman's receptionist and Jane Wyman as an uncredited chorus girl.

Overall, Cain and Mabel is a must-have for fans of the actors in it and people who appreciate lighthearted romantic comedies with a musical number or two thrown in may also like this film. True, it's not the best film in its genre mainly because of the often unbelievable plot twists but as light fluff it's not that bad a film.",1379289600,,3449,4.6909090909090905
8367296,5,B002EAYDQQ,"The piano player in this movie was my wife's father, Vic Briedis, who was a friend of Archie Leach, better known as Cary Grant.

8367297,3,B002EAYDQQ,"Marion Davies is remembered today as the long-term mistress of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, and not as an outstanding screen actress.  (She was more successful as a stage actress, a side of her that this film let her play up.)  And as an early Clark Gable vehicle, ""Cain and Mabel"" lets us glimpse various aspects of Gable's screen personality that would become his quite valuable trademarks as his career evolved.  Other than that, this film is diverting, perhaps enjoyable, but not heavyweight.

It doesn't set out to be a masterwork; the plot is about as substantial as the gauzy costumes Miss Davies wears.  Davies is a Broadway star and Gable a professional boxer. When their careers suffer sudden downturns, an ambitious agent gets the bright idea to concoct a love affair between them.  This is no easy matter because they take an instant dislike to each other, based on an unsuccessful earlier encounter when neither knew who the other really was.  The affair is, in any case, supposed to exist only in the tabloids but of course the pair unexpectedly do fall in love. They make plans to marry; Davies will retire from the stage and Gable will leave the pro fight game to operate service stations in NJ while she cooks, cleans and has babies.  The agent doesn't want to see this happen, and does everything he can to destroy their relationship.  In the end, of course, love triumphs and the pair head into the sunset to begin leading their own lives.

There's little about the writing or the acting here that calls for special remark.  A dazzlingly diverting screwball comedy this is not.  ""Cain and Mabel"" is a middle-of-the-road '30s B-film featuring 2 name stars.  One star depended for the preservation of her career upon the influence of a very wealthy and  powerful boyfriend (remember, she was the model for that awful opera singer in ""Citizen Kane"").  The other star was still regarded askance by studio suits who hadn't yet figured out what to do with him; Gable was described as ""a lumberjack in evening clothes,"" and ""Cain and Mabel"" was one of the few films he made in these years that didn't cast him as a gangster.

The film has few really hilarious moments; those I remember from a 1965 TV viewing involve a sequence in which Davies' character, determined to back out of the opening performance of a musical meant to revive her career, is shoved onstage and then runs straight across it to exit into the opposite wings.  People waiting there shove her back onstage, so she runs across it again in the opposite direction, only to run smack into the people who originally pushed her out there.  This is repeated several times, with first one group of shovers, and then the other, pursuing her back and forth across the stage in full view of the theater audience.  It works the first time, but somewhere around the third repetition the novelty dissipates completely, and in the end it goes on too long.

I'm sure this film satisfied 30s audiences who needed some comic relief in their lives, but modern viewers are likely to decide that it hasn't held up.  I find it interesting as a sidelight on Gable's early work, and as a display of Davies' talents in the way she knew best how to use them (but rarely got to do, since Hearst wanted to showcase her much weaker dramatic abilities).  On a rainy afternoon or evening, you could do worse.  Just have plenty of popcorn handy.",1374710400,,3409,4.702020202020202
8367298,2,B002EAYDQQ,"Cain and Mabel are Clark Gable and Marion Davies in a 1936 romantic comedy about a prize fighter and a showgirl, from Warner Brothers and directed by Lloyd Bacon.

Clark Gable (1901-60) was one of the biggest stars of the 20th century, and a pretty good actor to boot. He's best remembered as Rhett Butler for ""GWTW"" (1939), for which he received one of his three Oscar nominations (the other nomination was for 1935's ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" and he won in 1934 for ""It Happened One Night""), but he gave us many memorable performances in films like ""Teachers' Pet"" (1958) and ""But Not for Me"" (1959) both of which earned him Golden Globe nominations. My favorite Gable flick is ""Run Silent Run Deep"" (1958).

In 1936 Gable was at the peak of his powers and in 1938 he was crowned ""King of Hollywood"" by his good friend Spencer Tracey. ""Cain and Mabel"" was his 32nd film. This was his second and final pairing with Marion Davies - they worked together on ""Polly of the Circus"" (1931).

Marion Davies (1897-1961) is best known as the mistress of William Randolph Hearst. She started in silent films in 1916 and first worked for Hearst in 1918. She moved between romantic comedies and lavish costume dramas, and when Hearst  and Irving Thalberg quarreled, Hearst moved his Cosmopolitan Pictures from MGM to Warners, where this film was made. Following ""Cain and Mabel"" she made one more film in 1937 (""Ever Since Eve"") and then retired.

The film co-stars Roscoe Karns as a publicity man and Allen Jenkins as Gable's trainer.

Roscoe Karns (1891-1970) was famous for his machine gun delivery, usually as the sidekick of the leading man. He's best known for films like ""It Happened One Night"" (1934), ""His Girl Friday"" (1940), and ""Woman of the Year"" (1942).

Allen Jenkin's (1900-1974) long face was seen in more than 100 films, often as a criminal, and including ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"" (1932), ""Dead End"" (1937), and ""The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse"" (1938). He's best known for his recurring role as Muggsy in ""The Red Skeleton Hour"" (1954-62).

Lloyd Bacon (1889-1955) directs. Bacon directed more than 100 films between 1922 and 1954, the most famous of which are ""42nd Street"" (1933), ""A Slight Case of Murder"" (1938), ""Brother Orchid"" (1940), and ""Footsteps in the Dark"" (1941). He was not typically known for any style, but as a working director who could make a film within budget and time constraints.

The film has nothing to recommend it. The plot is downright silly and Marion Davies, at the end of a long career, seems disinterested in the role, despite how yummy Clark Gable appears. The public apparently agreed. Despite the presence of Gable, who appeared in the years' #1 and #10 top grossing films (""San Francisco"" and ""Wife vs. Secretary""), the film didn't do well at the box office and it received no major Academy Award  nominations.

Bear in mind, 1936 was a great year for films, with such memorable movies as Chaplin's ""Modern Times"",  William Powell's bravura performance in ""The Great Zigfield"" (winner of Best Picture and Best Actress), Garbo's ""Camille"", Errol Flynn and Olivia deHaviland in ""Charge of the Light Brigade"", and Cukor's ""Romeo and Juliette"" in which a fading John Barrymore gave his last great performance. When measured against films like this, ""Cain and Mabel"" seems weak indeed.",1294099200,4,3330,4.853615520282187
8367299,3,B002EAYDQQ,"I really loved Marion Davies in her silent films, but I've never liked her talking pictures that much as a whole. In this case, the plot is plucked from about a half dozen other 30's films that came before it, but the film does have Clark Gable going for it as well as those terrific contract Warner Brothers players.

The premise of this musical comedy is rather unbelievable. Waitress Mabel O'Dare is fired from her job for feeding a hungry unemployed publicist. He decides to help Mabel out by getting her a job in a Broadway show. The leading man pretends to be the show's producer as a gag, and tells Mabel she has the lead without even auditioning her. Unbelievable point number one - Mabel believes him. Unbelievable point number two - when she shows up and finds out she has no job, not even a spot in the chorus, the leading man and the producer feel so bad for her they do give her the lead, even though she's never danced or sung professionally before.

All of this I could live with, but then you have prizefighter Larry Cain (Clark Gable) and Mabel hating each other throughout two-thirds of the film for a multitude of mutual insults and injuries to one another. However, a single home-cooked pork chop by Mabel and her revelation to Larry that she used to be a waitress has him proposing inside of ten minutes? This is too much to swallow even for one of the screwball comedies of the thirties.

Finally there is the most tiresome part of the film, and that is the musical portion. There are two numbers that try to copy Busby Berkeley to some extent, but dance director Bobby Connelly doesn't seem to understand that you can't top Berkeley simply by building a taller set and a larger crane. Your numbers have to have some substance. The whole thing is haunted by the ghosts of the largely failed musical films of the late 20's and very early 30's with tableaus and spectacles that are just plain boring. If these numbers had just been removed the film would have been much better.
Ironically this DVD-R also contains a trailer that spends much of its time boasting about the film's musical numbers.

The video has some scratchiness in portions, but overall I'd give it a B+. The audio is in very good shape.",1259280000,3,2224,4.524875621890548
