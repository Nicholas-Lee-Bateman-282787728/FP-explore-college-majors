8046089,3,B000796D0K,"Fenton has great body awareness & relaxed, friendly style. He talks to the backup dancers like friends that really helps. I almost loved this on that alone.
The 8 min warm up was great. There's no instruction, but it's old school moves so it was easy & fun to do since it was normal speed throughout with a couple stretches added in.
He shows the move normal time, then 1/2 speed 1x telling you how to move the body generally calling out his left/right, then normal time, then into a routine 1-2x. After showing 4 moves, he has you repeat it first with just 2 girls, just him & the 1 boy, then finally the other girl with all the other girls, then from the back view. He doesn't name the moves so if you forget, you're out of luck, he only counts.
The camera angles can be annoying, zooming in the face when teaching a new move, etc.
What's slow is that he talks a lot in between moves & even leaves in bloopers. The relaxed feeling is great, but no need to leave in a blooper that lets the audience stand there waiting.
The moves themselves are older, not that old, but definitely beginner, mostly step touches, grapevines, couple kicks, brush of shoulder, hops, etc. Nothing too hard that a few viewings wouldn't fix & you would get it the first time if he had done it slow 2x or more repetitions of the routine before moving on to the next move. Which by the way, would actually raise your heart rate. Mine didn't with all the talking in between.
I would try another of his dvds if he took my suggestions.
This is best for beginners who aren't looking for a workout, more an instruction.

8046091,1,B000796D0K,"Too fast, I mean there were barely any instructions. I had to pause it every other second, after watching the first five minutes ten times I gave up and realised there was no way I was going to figure it out. Fenton F-Troop Fulgham is a choreographer not a teacher.",1141862400,16,265,4.32
8046092,4,B000796D0K,"Off Da Hook Hip Hop Aerobics is a fun workout that gets you moving!  It was everything I expected from a hip hop aerobics class and more.  I do hip hop aerobics once a week at a club and I bought this to do at home on the days we don't have class to continue dancing and I have been nothing but satisfied. Like the synopsis says ""It's not your mama's aerobics workout"".",1109808000,13,369,4.041095890410959
8046093,2,B000796D0K,"When I saw Off Da Hook Hip Hop Aerobics for sale I purchased it right away...I had been waiting for a workout tape with some flava to it. But after watching it once, I have to say that I am pretty disappointed. There are some dance moves that may work out parts of your body but I didn't feel the 'aerobics' part of the workout at all. Definitely not a workout for people that are really trying to lose weight....maybe if you just want to get your body warmed up with some dance moves. But don't bring these dance moves to the club...

Also, the music was not the hip hop that I expected. Overall, I think this workout lacks professionalism and did not give me the workout that I expected.",1107388800,56,689,4.259541984732825
