2649442,5,B000I0QG8W,"When I was about 9 or 10 I was at my grandparents house and i was flipping through the channels and I saw The Wall live in Berlin. This was in 2000 or so so it was a re-run of this magnificent concert. I had spent the latter part of my life hunting for this concert on DVD, I am currently 15. When i went on one of my many trips to Monterrey I walked into a music store with really no intention of buying anything. Since I was in Mexico and most products that are sold in stores are imported and as such grossly overpriced. i was flipping through the musical DVD's when I came across The Wall live in Berlin Special edition. I got a little excited. I checked the price. I was ecstatic the price was a very reasonable $10 dollars. I bought it and i am extremely pleased to finnaly add this concert to my collection.",1186185600,3,814,4.09375
2649443,1,B000I0QG8W,"This is a total waste of money! Absolutely horrible transfer. No remastering, at all. It actually looks like somebody just grabbed an old vhs copy of the concert, uploaded it to their computer, cropped off the top and bottom of the picture, transfered it to dvd and sat back and said, ""wow, I bet I can make some money with this."" Believe me, if you already own this concert on DVD, in the 4:3 aspect ratio, you already have a far superior copy than what is offered here!!!!!",1430352000,16,475,4.409090909090909
2649444,5,B000I0QG8W,This was an awesome concert. All the musicians sounded as good or better than the originals. It also has a lot more than the DVD VERSION.,1426723200,,137,4.3076923076923075
2649445,5,B000I0QG8W,Received today. Had regular release. Bought this one because is recorded in DTS which is superior sound. Plan on watching tomorrow. Thanks.,1424995200,,139,5.363636363636363

2649449,5,B000I0QG8W,"This is the ultimate concert rated by Rolling Stones magazine as still the number one show of all times.  Have to say I completely agree with that hands down.  Extremely enjoyable and you can watch this concert over and over with never getting tired of it. Not kidding about that either I watch this concert at least twice a week and enjoy it more with every watching. Worth ten times the price when considering the enjoyment it will deliver.  I highly reccomend putting this into your collection !! I have 5 different properties each with a audio video room. Top one is out of control with 42 speakers including 6 18 inch subwoofers, 4 15 inch subs all powered by high end amps. TV in this room is 14 feet diagonally and I spent over 300K building this room.  Other locations sport Bose systems with added on subs, or a nice Dennon system but it doesn't matter where I play this. it's a great experience no matter where it's viewed.  Of course I own numerous copies of this one so it's at every home I'm spending time at.  Get it now you'll Love it Too !!!",1417046400,4,1057,4.36734693877551
2649450,5,B000I0QG8W,"Put a side your opinions of Roger Waters and the conflicts with Pink Floyd.  Put a side your political differences with some of the performers.  This is a remarkable piece of work.  Great performances by Waters, Lauper, Bryan Adams and many others.  Even Sinead O'Connor did a fantastic job singing Mother even though it was a recording from a dress rehearsal the night before.  However I wasn't impressed with Joni Mitchells and Jerry Halls performances.
The Wall is the finest piece of work by Pink Floyd and this was a great show, Wish I was there ;-).  Glad I added this to my collection.",1411344000,4,592,4.644230769230769
2649451,5,B000I0QG8W,it wad a fast delibery and a grwat product. We have watched it se eral times and friends want to buy a copy . I have shown them the dvd on Amazon.,1393632000,,146,3.59375
2649452,3,B000I0QG8W,"I used to own this concert on cd and dvd many years ago, but for some reason I either lost it, or I sold it.  I don't remember which.  Then, when I saw this new special edition, I thought this would be a good time to pick it up again.  It claimed to be the original, uncut performance, including the power cuts, and Roger entertaining the crowd with his tap-dancing.  It also claimed to have an expanded documentary.  The original was only 30 minutes, and this new documentary was supposedly 70 minutes.

Well, that's not what I got.  Basically the concert is the EXACT same one that I saw 20 years ago.  It's not the original performance, and the documentary is still 30 minutes.  The only thing that is new is the multi-audio track section.  That's it.

The CD's are basically the same too, except ""The Trial"" and ""The Tide is Turning"" run a little longer.  ""The Trial"" features more applause at the end, and ""The Tide is Turning"" features a snippet of ""Outside the Wall"" (from ""The Wall"" movie) at the end.

So, although the concert is great, this new special edition is not very special at all.",1306281600,19,1098,4.457286432160804
