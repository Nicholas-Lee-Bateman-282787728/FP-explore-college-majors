6094385,5,B00GNZLZQO,"I am a big fan of Parkour, Freerunning and Tricking, so I knew at the very first beginning that this movie will be the one to watch. Very interesting cast like William Moseley, Eric Roberts but there are many talented, skilled performers in this movie and that was also one of the biggest reasons why I have waited for years to be released. If you love Parkour/Freerunning/Tricking, I strongly recommend this movie. You won't regret.",1391817600,14,433,4.786666666666667
6094386,4,B00GNZLZQO,"I can't speak to the 3D aspect of it, because I actually watched the movie on my iPhone 4 (gasp!), so I'll leave that critique to others.

I respectfully disagree with DVD Verdict's view that there was too much Parkour. I actually feel there could and should have been more! I am not sure I would have been pulled in to watch this movie (on Netflix) or would have been familiar with and/or interested in the Parkour aspect except for the fact that my grandson (now 17) has been taking Parkour lessons for several years (and has drawn his friends into it as well) and loves it so much. So my immediate reaction was to want to check it out to see if it was something I could recommend to him.

Much to my surprise, I enjoyed the movie - the characters were likable and interesting, and it kept my interest from beginning to end. What I very consciously enjoyed most about it, I think, was the pleasant surprise that it IS possible to make an action thriller that does NOT involve sex, nudity, drugs, alcohol, smoking, blood/guts/gore, excessive violence, or cursing, and yet can still maintain at least an interesting adult-ish theme - kudos to the directors and producers and screenwriters for that unbelievable feat - Hollywood directors, take note!

As others have pointed out, at times the movie tried to accomplish too many things with the story line. My personal opinion is that they could have laid out the backstory of the mob (or mob-like group - don't think it was actually ""the mob"") connection and threat as a running backdrop, and then focused more on the Parkour skills and moves as well as dynamics of the teen characters and incorporated them into the story line. The producers gave us a little tease of that with the fire scene, and then not much after that.

I feel they missed a golden opportunity to incorporate more of Kelsey Chow's Parkour skills into a particular scene. Without giving away too much of the story for the benefit of those who haven't seen it, she has a particular challenge she needs/wants to overcome. When her character is in peril later on in the movie, that would have been the perfect moment to weave that challenge into the movie! Those who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. As it is, the way that challenge did play out was a bit ho-hum.

In fact, I think that they grossly underplayed the scenes and story line once a few of the characters found themselves in a threatening situation. If it were me, I would have made that threatening scenario a lot more threatening and dangerous than it actually was in the movie, and woven some ""extreme Parkour and free-running"" skills and challenges into the scene in that segment. As it actually played out to the finish, I found that segment of the movie to be very anticlimactic, almost like walking into the homerun from third base in the final minutes of a nail-biting tie-breaker game. They could have played those scenes with a lot more ""thrill"" and risk built into the action moments.

The writers also could have written a little more drama into the dynamics of the teen characters and played off of that once the movie evolved into the scenes of peril, where they would have had to make some tough choices while battling emotional angst. That would have made the outcome all the more exciting and rewarding.

Even with those shortcomings, I still felt the movie was entertaining. I think the actors who played the teens all did a great job and were likable and interesting from the get-go, although their individual characters could have been better developed. The chemistry among all of them was great and believable, including the budding romance that emerged in the story. The directing also had a very realistic feel to it, and as others have pointed out, it was a nice break from all the techo-wizardry of fake stuff we've been accustomed to in movies. Everything in this movie looked and felt very real and believable. I really liked that.

Although I wasn't particularly familiar with any of it, I also liked the music in the movie, and noted that others in the Netflix reviews shared that sentiment.

I have recommended the movie to my grandson, after first getting approval from my daughter (who screens all the kids' movies with her own conservative rating system!). I am looking forward to getting his reaction after he views it.

Meanwhile, I would recommend it to fans of Parkour and fans of action films in general. Of course, you should temper your expectations - it's an ""action"" story, but it's not an ""Arnie"" movie! But it's still a pleasant way to pass the time for 90 minutes or so, whether you watch it in 3D or cuddled in bed with your iPhone propped on a pillow. :)

UPDATE 2/4/14: My grandson has seen the movie and gives it two thumbs up, so it's a good bingo! :)",1391299200,2,4801,4.616647127784291
6094387,4,B00GNZLZQO,"For a low budget movie, this one is entertaining enough for fans (and soon-to-be fans) of parkour. The leads do a credible job, and the script is decent.

Without computer effects, finally made by men only (I remember ""The Crow""...all computer made!!), here is something real!
Considering I suppose the low available budget for realizing such a film, the result is simply great! The plot is well developed, and of course in my opinion the best is the 3D technique.... the film was rewarded with a reason!
Well done by all the cast, it's not only for young but also for those who like films for a ""new generation""....thanks to the director who portrays such new generation!

The movie is about the new discipline Parkour (free-running).  From the beginning you find yourself engaged with the storyline, realistic athletic sequences, and cool scenes. The cast is brilliant with an incredible stunt work (parkour) and, most relevant,  accomplished without computerized effects. Amazing !!
A must-to-see for action lovers and parkour fans.
Strange that a film that has won in Italy with an Italian director is not distributed in Italy!",1390003200,9,579,5.21505376344086

6094393,3,B00GNZLZQO,"If you follow foreign action movies at all, you've heard of Parkour. The Luc Besson-produced District B13 made a splash by including a number of scenes where its hero engaged in some creative traversing of his district using the free-running techniques. It seemed like a fad that had run its course (pun intended) once it appeared in the opening of Casino Royale, where a would-be free-runner is stymied by Bond's willingness to break through doors. Just when Parkour seemed to have lost its cinematic shine, we get Run, an indie action flick that hopes to infuse some fresh blood into the free-running genre by going 3D. It doesn't really work, and only fans of cheesy action flicks should bother with this one.

Daniel (William Mosoley, The Chronicles of Narnia) and his father are thieves who live by a strict set of rules. Daniel, however, impetuously breaks one, and the pair have to return to NYC to face their demons head on. Daniel is put in a new high school while his father tries to untangle the past from Daniel's mobster brother (Eric Roberts, The Expendables), who thinks Daniel's father had something to do with the death of his mother.

Two genres that did not need to mix: the teen film and the low-budget actioner. Sure, there are movies out there with kids and action set pieces, but they usually skew towards the teen audience, with happy endings and bright colors. Run, however, opts to take the adult route. We have a main character who is born after his mother dies from a gunshot, and he and his father are thieves hoping their mobster in-law/uncle doesn't bring the hammer down for his sister's death.

The first problem is that it's overly complicated. If this were just about a thief owning up to his past and dealing with the death of his wife, we'd be in solid action territory. Similarly, if the film mostly focused on the son using Parkour to fit into a new school after being on the run with his dad things would be okay, too. Instead, the former feels too heavy for the latter, and vice versa.

The second problem is that Parkour isn't enough to carry a film. It was used really well in the Bond flick because it helped drive character: though the free-runner looked really cool sliding through tight spaces, Bond was the real badass when he breaks through the door. Parkour as a practice is a kind of moving meditation, an interaction between practitioner and environment. Most films that feature it wisely make it both visually interesting and relatively rare in the narrative. Run makes the mistake of having both too much Parkour and not making it look interesting enough. It's especially tough to sit through since most of the Parkour is embedded in Daniel's narrative, making it seem more like a bad dance competition than a run-for-your-life proposition in most exciting Parkour-heavy films.

Run isn't a terrible film by any stretch. It's certainly a mediocre one, and one that leans too heavily on the gimmick of Parkour. However, those who've watched their fair share of action films will find something to like here. The action isn't as exciting as the best films in the genre, but the free-running angle might be enough to tempt those with a high tolerance for mediocrity. It's also always fun to see Eric Roberts play a gangster as he ages. There's a certain charm to watching the film to laugh at it, and I can see a number of fun and productive drinking games emerging from the film.

Run 3D (Blu-ray) is also decent. Both the 3D version of the film and the regular version are on one disc. The 1.78:1/1080p AVC-encoded image is pretty solid. Detail is strong throughout, with nice colors. Black levels aren't as deep as I'd like, but they are consistent and lacking in noise. The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 track is similarly pretty good. Dialogue is clean and clear, and the surrounds get a bit of use during action scenes. The lone extra is a standard making-of featurette.

Run is a mediocre action film that tries to do a bit too much. To the standard action set pieces, it tries to add elements of thriller, comedy, and romance, and the mix is worse than the sum of its parts. Though it might make a fun curiosity for fans of Parkour and/or Eric Roberts, it's not recommended for the average viewer.

In addition, I found the storyline to be boring, as I did the last dozen times I saw it in other films. Not much thrills with the 3D effects either. Fortunately, I shelled out only $10 for this.

6094405,5,B00GNZLZQO,"RUN is a movie that literally takes its title to heart. Along with its ""Epilogue"", it's like watching a cross between Spiderman and an Olympics' Gymnast contest. In fact, the story itself is a little threadbare.  William Mosely (The Royals, Narnia) is a petty thief who is tutored by his ""past his prime"" and hobbled father played by Adrian Pasdar. The two have been evading ""the Mob"" headed by Eric Roberts (who always knows how to chew up the scenery and give an appropriate nod to the audience) for some 15 years. Something happened in the past involving Roberts' daughter and Pasdar, the latter being blamed for whatever. Now living in NY, they are near the scene of the earlier incident and drawn back into it by current circumstance.  In the meantime, Daniel (Mosely) has made friends with those around him, and all are capable of the most incredible feats while moving rapidly forward and avoiding obstacles (parkour) via a sequence of running, leaping, somersaulting, vaulting, and climbing.  There are some stunt doubles but the actors do appear to be doing their own stunts at times. In fact one of Daniel's friends, played by Craig Henningsen, actually succeeded Reeve Carney (the late Art Carney's grandson) who was the original Spiderman in the Broadway production of the same name. The plan to do one last job doesn't go as expected and the focus of the film now shifts to the interaction between Mosely and Pasdar on the one hand and Roberts on the other.  There are a number of surprises at this point (no ""Spoilers"" here) and the climax plays out with the same ""adrenalin rush"" that pervades this entire film. The entire storyline merely serves as a backdrop to the breathtaking gymnastics and never disappoints. In the end, the movie is satisfying on several levels; and it's a nice change of pace from the usual ""run of the mill"" fare that populates most films these days.",1430784000,,1891,4.791411042944786

6094410,3,B00GNZLZQO,"Daniel lives with his dad and he does that free running thing or Parkour and seems to be very good at it. He also breaks into peoples homes and steals things. The synopsis describes this as being both a hero and thief - well I think the cops would just go for the thief option to be honest. Anyway his pops is on the run from some bad guys and so they have to do a Midnight flit again or `run' away - see the title is actually quite clever.

Well they end up with him having to go to a new school and - well you guessed it he meets a girl and the usual happens and they fall for each other. Then the bad guys turn up and this time they decide not to run but do some fighting instead.

Now this film has buckets of macho BS that I found to be a bit boring - no actually very boring, but that is de rigueur these days.  Also it reminded me of `Skateboard' which was a film trying to make skateboarding cool in a cinematic way. Well if you have never seen it then your life is much the richer for having not done so. This is no way near as bad, but it is the bigging up of free running antics that stats to wear thin. But if you like that sort of thing then this could be your film Nirvana.

There is an awful body double moment here too - and you don't have to pay too much attention to spot it. The music is all urban stuff and actually works quite well. I streamed this and some would say an actual stream would be a good place for it to end up. But it did pass the time and is far from terrible hence my rating, but I think I saw it on a good day.",1420934400,,1548,3.798136645962733

6094427,1,B00GNZLZQO,"This movie exists, clearly, as an attempt to exploit parkour the way the ""Step Up"" movies made use of modern and hip-hop dancing. But the parkour scenes here are brief and poorly filmed (except for the compilation of real parkour practitioners in some ruined factory with the final credits), and the plot is thin, the screenplay amateurish. Don't be fooled by the A-minus-list cast: These guys - William Moseley from the Narnia movies, Adrian Pasdar from the original Heroes and the inevitable and seemingly undead Eric Roberts - must all have had holes in their schedules and hopes of some kind of ""Step Up"" surprise. It's sad, really. I bought ""Step Up 3D"" on the same kind of whim that led me to purchase this: Thinking that it would at least be entertaining, with interesting 3D effects. ""Step Up 3D"" turned out to be a charming little movie with many terrific 3D dance sequences. This movie is the opposite: A dull, low-production-value sub-Sundance indie with no purpose to its 3D aspect (except for that documentary end credit sequence) other than marketing. Whatever film festival gave it an award for its screenplay must have been scraping bottom. The ""Dad's on the run from the Mafia"" story, with a young love secondary thread, is unoriginal and ploddingly executed, and even the ""surprise"" twist at the end barely raises an eyebrow. Moseley is an appealing young actor, but let's hope he does better with his next solo leading role. OK, I've complained enough. Bottom line: Don't be fooled by the low price for a 3D Blu Ray.

6094431,2,B00GNZLZQO,"Parkour has become the rage these days. It's been featured on TV shows and movies like CASINO ROYALE and has even found a home in commercials. For those unaware, parkour is ""...the activity or sport of moving rapidly through an area, typically in an urban environment, negotiating obstacles by running, jumping and climbing..."". If you've seen someone running and jumping through things or flipping off of walls at a run, you've seen parkour.

Perhaps the best film to use parkour has been DISTRICT B13 which had people flying at tremendous speeds through a broken down district in France in the near future. That movie was an amazing film to see and displayed the sport at its best. Now a new movie has been released trying to duplicate that success but it falls a bit short, no pun intended.

Seventeen year old Daniel is on the run with his father non-stop. The duo rob places to get by and support themselves, Daniel using his skills at parkour to escape the fastest police around. One day Daniels father Mike (Adrian Pasdar) decides they've run long enough. It seems that years ago Mike married a woman whose brother Jeremiah (Eric Roberts) was unhappy with her choice. When she died after being shot and giving birth to Daniel, Jeremiah swore to make Mike pay. What he didn't know was that Daniel was born.

So Mike and Daniel return to the tough streets of New York with Mike hoping to make amends with Jeremiah. Daniel goes to school and gets caught up with another teen that just happens to be into parkour as well. While he disguises his abilities, Daniel falls for his friend's sister. All of this comes to a head later when the bad guys kidnap her and Jeremiah eventually captures Mike as well. Only Daniel can save the day but not before it's revealed that Mike's old friend and Jeremiah's right hand Luke had more to do with the whole story than first believed.

The movie here is well intentioned but falls short of its goal. The production values are on the lower end but you get the feeling everyone involved had higher hopes than what turned out. You have to give them credit for that. The parkour on display seems incredibly basic. It's sort of like comparing the high wire stunts in Chinese made martial arts films to the first karate displays offered in American made movies in the sixties. William Moseley as Daniel does his best but it's apparent he was hired for his parkour skills and not his acting ability. That said, he does his best and may turn out to do better work in the future; there is hope.

On the whole this movie is entertaining in an ELECTRIC BOOGALOO sort of way but not one that I'd add to my shelf. Still, if you had little else to choose from at your rental outlet or chance to see it on Netflix it provides a decent night's entertainment. Just go in knowing what to expect. Let's hope all involved progress from here.",1393372800,,2862,4.560311284046692

8625217,4,B00GNZLZQO,"This is one of those totally harmless Indie films that will entertain you as long as your hopes aren't too high. It is a fun and somewhat predictable movie that never tries to be more than it is and that makes it endearing. Young Daniel (William Moseley, The royals) is the 17 year old son of Adrian Pasdar and both are on the run from Daniel's Uncle who believes that Adrian was responsible for his sister's death, Daniel's mother. They make a living by stealing and robbing and living off the grid....Daniel has a talent for parkour that gets him out of trouble a lot. They move to NY and try to make up to the Uncle, Daniel makes friends and meets a girl and well.....it all hits the fan from there. The parkour stuff is fun and thye performances are all endearing I usually avoid Eric Roberts movies because they tend to be dreck but this was a wonderful little action movie, the small budget is easy to see. William is sweet and the rest of the cast is right on par, very likable.",1469232000,,985,4.3297297297297295
