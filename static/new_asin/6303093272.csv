570499,5,6303093272,"As it's already been said so many times, ""Are You Afraid of the Dark?"" was, by far, the best show on Nick. It was always the highlight of my childhood weekends to sit in front of the television and listen to the creepy tales of the Midnight Society. I would absolutely love to see the series released on DVD and I would buy every single season, as I'm sure so many others who grew up watching this show would.",1154390400,4,409,4.189873417721519
570500,5,6303093272,"And let's face it...back in the day, Nick had some pretty incredible shows....Clarissa, Ren & Stimpy, Doug, Hey Dude, Salute Your Shorts, Count Duckula, etc. It still did up until about 6 or 7 years ago then....plop. ""Are You Afarid of the Dark"" was by far the best. It takes real quality to make a genuinely creepy show that can be scary, but still appropriate for pre-teens. Well, Nickelodion did it with this gem. The most frightening and impressionable episodes were ""The Tale of the Nightly Neighbors"", ""The Tae of the Lonely Ghost"", ""The Tale of the Bookish Babysitter"", ""The Tale of the Quiet Librarian"" and ""The Tale of the Nightshift."" Classics. In the later seasons, the show lost a little of its original flair, but still managed a few good ones. The stories that dealed with technology ruined the show (sorry, computers aren't scary.) The classic ghost stories were the best.

They really need to release this already. I have plenty of friends in their late teens/ early twenties who have raved that they would buy this show on DVD in a second.",1148774400,11,1056,4.739130434782608
570501,5,6303093272,"Are you Afraid of the Dark NEEDS to be available on DVD. It's such a good show! It used to be one of my favorites growing up, when Nick was watchable. I would be over the moon and sun if this was released!

This show deserves more than 5 stars.",1146960000,6,244,3.88
570502,5,6303093272,"This is the best show Nickelodeon ever aired along with the old classics like Clarissa Explains it All and Pete & Pete. Why haven't they released the DVD's yet? This would probably be a huge seller. I looked all over the internet for these DVD's and one website said they were soon to be released. Then I went over to Ebay and they had a couple sets there with all 7 seasons on them! I bought them. This show is still as good today as it ever was. Even if you're grown up now this set will not let you down, it will entertain you. Every single story in every season will have your eyes glued to the TV and interested in the spooky stories.

570504,5,6303093272,"I think everyone will agree when I say this show needs to be released on DVD.  I used to watch Snick shows when I was little and did the pleading with my parents to allow me to stay up late and watch them.  Now I'm 20 and still waiting for them to come back.  So if someone's reading these, please bring the show out on DVD, because it is the best!",1145577600,,348,3.8732394366197185

570506,5,6303093272,I loved this show back in the days.  I can recall it being one of the most best shows on nick.  I remember this one episode about a boy who decided to play pinball and he got stuck in the game after beating it.  The show was so creative and mind-bottling.  I just enjoyed it everytime.  I was searching online and a website called limitedclassics claims to be selling it on DVD.  I'm not sure because it sounds shady?  O well I hope someone can confirm.,1142380800,,453,4.1976744186046515

570547,5,6303093272,"Are You Afraid of the Dark? was such a great show to watch on Nickelodeon. I remember how terrified I was whenever I saw the opening with it's dark rooms, empty playgrounds, evil-looking clowns, and that match.

I loved episodes like the Ghastly Grinner, that one with Gilbert Gottfried, the one with the movie-theater vampire who escapes from the movie, the one with the funhouse clown (if I remember it correctly)... and wasn't there an episode about Curly's gold, or Tucker's gold, or somebody's gold or treasure? It's been too long! I need for this show to be released on DVD.

This was one of the scariest TV shows I had ever seen (other than Goosebumps, which is another great youth horror show from my generation) and it deserves to be seen by my generation, the current generation, and future generations. Please, Nick. Do it for us.",1140998400,3,841,4.714285714285714

When he asked me what I wanted for Christmas my response was ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK SERIES!! I figured he could surely find it on the internet. But sadly the only thing he has been able to find are copied disks with bad resolution. I would be thrilled if this site/co. could get ahold of some awesome disks for us, cuz it is only the best show nickalodean has yet made!",1133568000,4,534,4.245098039215686
570591,5,6303093272,"aparently I have written a BOGUS review for this DVD under another name. I had seen the name ""afraid of the dark"" and I thought that that was this dvd package. if you have missed my previous review, then look no further, cause Ill summerize it for you"" Honestly, I owe this show my life. If I don't watch it, Ill probably go crazy for die. My cats also find this show interesting. I can tell cause they are always looking at the tv screen. oh,how cute. I have 47 of them. my wife also loves this show, and we have been in an argument. there is no way to settle it now, becuase she had thought that NICK wasn't going to make are you afraid of the dark into dvd form, so she jumped off the nick building in protest. we both could not figure out what they use to put out that darned fire each episode, so we have spent millions of dollars trying to find this out. if you know, please contact me at [...]thanks so much~

7838870,1,6303093272,"This is not the Are you Afraid of the Dark set you've been waiting for.

This is a merely a ""best of"" set from Season 6, episodes that debuted back in 1999-2000, when Nick decided to being back Are you Afraid of the Dark for another season.

None of these episodes are as good as the classics from the series original run which debuted in '92. Which featured such memorable episodes as ""The Hatching"" ""The Shiny Red Bicycle"" ""The Final Wish"" and others.

Avoid this. You can buy the complete First Season of Are you Afraid of the Dark? on Amazon.ca. (It is Region 1, so it will work on US DVD Players) There's a few lame episodes on that set, but it's better than this set becuase it contains the original episodes from when the series first began way back when.

Pwersonally, I'm waiting for Season 2 to be released. That is when the series really hit its peak with some excellent episodes.",1159833600,4,891,4.414634146341464

7838872,5,6303093272,"It pains me nowadays to watch Nickelodeon (as much as I can now) and to see all these sorry shows on now. Are You Afraid Of The Dark, and all of the shows on SNICK at the time were one of the most memorable television highlights of my past. I can remember staying up late (keep in mind I was in grade school at the time) every Saturday Night in my parents' room watching this and THE ORIGINAL ALL THAT! (Lori Beth Denberg, Alicia Reyes, Kel Mitchell, Keenan Thompson), Keenan & Kel, The Mystery Files Of Shelby Woo, all these great shows. Now, Nickelodeon does not do these sorts of things anymore. In my opinion the shows now really are sorry. But I was just watching some old clips of this show and it just took me back about 10+ years. I really am a very nostalgic person. Therefore, I have to honestly say that I am quite desperate for Amazon or anybody really to release a legal DVD box set of this show as quickly as possible. Either this or put it back on television, because I have pretty much stopped watching television these past few years and stuck with old show box sets. (Television really is going down really fast.)I have a feeling that with as many nostalgic people as there are in this world, and how desperate people are to watch television shows with a even a little taste, this DVD boxed set would sell very well indeed!",1155686400,8,1341,4.346613545816733
