I recommend the masters dvds or the 2008 US OPEN. still highlights but atleast YOU CAN BREATHE.",1398556800,,437,4.2023809523809526

8370057,5,B002GUJGMK,"I bought a lot of Master's, US Open or British Open DVD over time but this Players is special.  We get a glimpse of what a pratice round is about as well as many behind the scenes shot on top of the highlights of the tournament.  Probably the best highlights DVD on the market.",1343692800,,277,4.111111111111111
