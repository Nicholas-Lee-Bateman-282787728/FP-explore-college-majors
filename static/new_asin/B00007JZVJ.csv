8368702,4,B00007JZVJ,"I'm just a guy who loves water (scuba & sea-doo). I saw BlueCrush & really loved the surfing footage. Soo I decided to go get a surf dvd. This was the only one I could find, but I didn't get it for the bikinis! These ladies have got more guts than most guys & it shows thru in their surfing! The locations are absolutely gorgeous & the surfing added to the beauty of the scenery. There are a few interviews & it was interesting to learn more about these ""Wave Warriors"". They really enjoy what they do & that's a pretty rare thing these days! My faves: Megan Abubo, Heather Clark, & Keala Kennelly - nearly every time they're onscreen, they show you why they're so admired by their fellow surfers! Definitely a water-lover's delight w/ some of the most amazing athletes I've ever seen on the water - or below it! :)",1059782400,4,815,4.333333333333333
