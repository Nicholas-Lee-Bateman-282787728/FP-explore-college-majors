8112467,3,B000EOTK4O,"Im obsessed with wildwood so anything with wildwood on it, in it - a five foot radius of it - i just drool uncontrollably. This documentary is cool - but I feel like it doesn't do wildwood justice. It's about the kitch design of hotels - not enough history in my opinion. BUT - it does give you the 411 on what hotels are being renovated and preserved. I just bought WILDWOOD DAYS - a pbs special on the groovy NJ hotspot - that's amazing! i had to call the wildwood visitor center to order it. It's a bit pricey but it's sooooo worth it!",1206662400,2,538,4.133333333333334
