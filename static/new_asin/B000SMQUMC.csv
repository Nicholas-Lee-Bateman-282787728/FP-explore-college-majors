8206035,5,B000SMQUMC,"This is a wonderful look back at Freddie's early work. He found little monetary success, until he hooked up with Leon Russell's ""Shelter Records"". I had the great opportunity to see Freddie, once as the opening act for Leon and the other time J.J.Cale opened, followed by Freddie as Russell was again the headliner.

I cannot think of one GREAT blues guitarist that didn't cover at least one of Freddie's legendary songs. Do you enjoy the blues? Yeah? Well you won't have buyers remorse, remembering, it was recorded in the mid sixties.",1207094400,,536,4.826086956521739
