7858734,3,6303995853,"First of all, it's really hard to see Randy Quaid try to play such a serious character.  It seems like a different actor might have been more convinving.  I would have guessed that this movie was filmed in the 80s because of the quality.  The sound and the quality weren't very good....maybe because it's a VHS version.  It is a hard movie to find though so a VHS is what I settled for.",1389830400,,386,4.2465753424657535
