3850527,5,B00261E7XC,Exhilarating documentary that captures the joy of collective creativity and effort. It tracks a group of high school musicians as  they develop into an award-winning jazz band. This film is a fine homage to the spirit of jazz and of youth--and of real education.,1281052800,,262,4.954545454545454
3850528,5,B00261E7XC,At the end of the movie I wanted them to hear them play more and more.  That was only thing I was disappointed with.,1275696000,,116,3.8333333333333335
3850529,5,B00261E7XC,This is a MUST SEE for music lovers. The enthusiasim from the kids and the outstanding talent they possess is something forgotten in today's highschool life. Music programs are being curtailed all over the country and everyone should see this film and understand what a waste it is to trash that talent. We gave this disk to my son's high school band leader and now it's shown to all his music students..WHAT A MOVIE !!,1260835200,5,419,4.6
3850530,4,B00261E7XC,"This documentary is about a high school jazz group that does something remarkable. The music and vibes are terrific, very well filmed and edited, not a slow moment.  Recommended if interested in American jazz, education, school bands, or just an inspiring story.",1253059200,6,262,5.238095238095238
3850541,5,B00261E7XC,An inspirational story of a school band with a close-up and personal view of some of the young people involved.  In a time of sad stories about kids and schools this was a refreshing story the re-build your faith in our younger generation.,1425600000,,239,4.558139534883721
3850542,5,B00261E7XC,"Wonderful music, great story. My wife and I have recommendedthis to everyone and we are purchasing another DVD to donate to the library where my wife works.",1406851200,,156,4.814814814814815
3850543,1,B00261E7XC,my headline says it all.  i give it no stars for excluding women.  wynton should be fired from director of j@lc!,1396396800,2,112,4.285714285714286
3850544,5,B00261E7XC,"This movie captures absolutely everything that is excellent in high school jazz: Improvisation, integration, competition and transcendence.  It gives hope for the future of a uniquely American genre, and leaves the watcher saying, ""Did a bunch of high school students just do that?""",1386288000,,282,5.558139534883721
3850545,1,B00261E7XC,"I was really disappointed by this movie. There are lots of great documentaries about kids in competitions (MAKE BELIEVE, KORAN BY HEART, SPELLBOUND, PRESSURE COOKER, MAD HOT BALLROOM, BROOKLYN CASTLE) and this was notably mediocre. The filming quality is poor (especially in the first half), we get to know the subjects only superficially, and the story limps along in no particular direction until we get to the competition in New York.

However, what really made this movie awful was the extreme sexism displayed by the filmmakers. They chose to follow a school jazz band with only one girl (very atypical) and then they made that girl entirely invisible. She literally is not seen until the trip to New York City, and then she is shown holding her trumpet, but never actually playing. Later in the film, when other bands with more female players are shown, the camera cuts away any time a girl is about to play and focuses instead on a boy. There are many dozens of instances of boys being shown playing for several seconds at a time, but only one in the whole movie of a girl (a competing team's saxophonist). No girl players are interviewed at all.

My ten-year-old daughter plays trumpet in her school jazz band and I got her this movie thinking it would inspire her. I wish the filmmakers could have seen her face as she slowly realized that girls were being cut out of the film. When the credits rolled at the end, we weren't surprised to see that absolutely every name--director, producers, cinematographer--was a man.

If the filmmakers had focused entirely on the white players and shown the black ones only in the background, never playing or speaking, there would have been a huge outcry and they certainly wouldn't have won awards. It's sad that girl musicians were invisible to these men and that this girl-free vision of high school jazz is the only one many young viewers will see.",1385856000,6,1898,4.762917933130699
3850546,5,B00261E7XC,"This is why teachers teach, students learn, and humans thrill.  This is a spiritually uplifting display of what humans do best when they congregate, this time in reverent musicality.",1385683200,,182,5.275862068965517
3850547,5,B00261E7XC,Great Uplifting Movie!!!  Inspiring group of kids who worked hard and had their dreams fulfilled. Teaches children to follow their passion for something greater than themselves.  They learn to trust and depend on others to become a unit instead of indivually working separately,1376265600,,277,5.4186046511627906
3850548,5,B00261E7XC,"I watched this movie with my 11 year old son who is a young musician.  It was almost a random selection.  We both loved it.  Never mind the competitive element, just listen to these high school bands play Ellington!  We both highly recommend this movie!",1376092800,,253,4.555555555555555
3850549,5,B00261E7XC,"Chops is the story of several high school jazz bands preparing for competition at Lincoln Center.  You cannot escape getting swept up as you watch the kids and their teachers focus on the music, their own performance, and need to work together and respect each other's abilities.  You learn as they learn.  The music is terrific.  And the life lessons are the ones we all need to remember and want to teach our kids.  Everyone in our family enjoyed the film.  And we will watch it again!",1375401600,,487,4.540229885057471
3850550,4,B00261E7XC,Very interesting story about how novice young musicians progress. First learning the music and their instrumments. Then gradually they develop feeling for the music and their instruments. The kids grow from novices to people who could play for the Wyntyon Marsalis band.,1374278400,,270,5.4523809523809526
3850551,5,B00261E7XC,"A documentary about high school jazz bands competing to be the best.  And these kids are amazing!  Makes me cry about what I could have been.  Great music, get to see Wynton, and he is one real dude.",1372809600,,199,4.184210526315789
3850552,5,B00261E7XC,"We bought this DVD after reading the reviews and LOVE it.  We've loaned it to friends and they return it with Post-It notes saying ""Great!"" and ""Wonderful,"" etc.  It is all that and more.  As a trumpeter I enjoy and play jazz, so of course am very familiar with Wynton's playing, but did not realize he had  such a prominent role in this high school Ellington competition.  We've now viewed this DVD five or six times and have thoroughly enjoyed it each time, as we will again in the future.  Terrific DVD!",1361491200,,506,4.445652173913044

3850555,3,B00261E7XC,"I thought this was a Winton concert, but it turned out to be about high school jazz competition. It followed students leading up to and then the competition, good music at the end",1355529600,,179,4.454545454545454

3850557,4,B00261E7XC,"Different than most music videos, but still helpful.  Would be encouraging for young or first 2-3 year musicians-especially those who like jazz. Has some humor, shows the challenges of music competition and the value of practice.  Nice ending, music wisdom from Wynton, you'll want to take your instrument out and practice right away.",1322179200,,334,5.283018867924528
3850558,5,B00261E7XC,"Loved this DVD,  Sent it to my two grand children who are studying music. It's inspiring -  kudos to Wynton Marsalis and to all of those who bring this competition to fruition.

3850560,5,B00261E7XC,"These kids are NOT amateurs!  They are true musicians.  How exciting to watch as they develop skills and become a tight, swingin' band!  While the film contains only a small amount of 'concert performance,' it is much more than a simple documentary.  From start to finish, you are swingin', tappin', and finger-snappin' with truly talented jazz musicians.  ""Chops"" is a joyful experience . . . thanks, Wynton.",1295308800,,409,5.044776119402985

who master the art of Ellington era Jazz and the rare talent of Improvisation to compete at
the National level. The music is exceptional. Far and away better than any of the current
contemporary effort. It is a compelling story. More narrative than was really necessary,especially
at times when it interupted a music sequence",1427414400,,415,4.859154929577465
