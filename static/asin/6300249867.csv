228923,A1MM6PU8E3VZ5L,6300249867,"A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr. ""Nosidino""","[1, 1]","I had to borrow a line from the movie to put in the above title. In full, it went like this: ""A complex series of seductions and murders, that's not something you see a woman do,"" says the boss of Alex Barnes. How wrong was he? Not only was he wrong, but quite sexist. Women have been seducing and murdering men for centuries, and by the late 1980s I'm sure it would have been realized that a woman was more than capable of doing that sort of crime.I won't rehash the plot. That has been done elsewhere. What I will say is I loved the storyline and the script. Having two female protagonists duel with one another was a fantastic twist that one rarely saw in the 1980s, to say nothing of today. But 25 years later, this movie still enthralls me. I remember seeing it as a little boy when it was in theatres, and let me tell you it mesmerised me. I also loved the locations--like the now defunct parking lot (Site Of The Reagan Building Today) that was prominently used in the movie Manhunter the previous year.Despite being 25 years old, Black Widow holds up very well. This movie could be remade today and not lose a beat. There are a few plot holes I'll bring up. Was Barnes' scuba tank sabotaged by Catherine? This was never explained after her near fatal drowning. What was Catherine's real name? Who was she? Where did she originate from? Why did she allow Barnes to stick around when she began to suspect her being a federal agent? Why didn't she stop her killings after William McCrory in Seattle? She had more than enough money, and there was no indication in the movie that she was a sociopath so much as her killings were for greed. Indeed, she even cries herself to sleep after the first of her husbands (On Screen) dies, which shows some guilt on her part. How many others had she killed before the events of the movie take place? Could there have been other killings or was her first murder the one shown to us at the beginning of the movie? It would have helped and added more detail had some or all of these questions been answered for the viewers.Leonard Maltin said there was no payoff at the end of the film. Well, to me the payoff was somewhat faulty and contrived. Why would Catherine have admitted to the attempted murder? Also, would she not have attempted to see the ""body"" of her husband before attempting to claim his money? I mean there was plenty of time and one would have expected her to wait until at least after the funeral before going after poor Paul's money. Yet she does not even attempt to see Paul's body. That to me was/is the biggest flaw in this movie's plot. Despite this, I'm giving it Four Stars.I only wish they would make more movies like this for women.A.

228924,A23BTLTIHMJN01,6300249867,A. Simon,"[1, 1]","This is one of those brilliant films which does not get as much recognition as it should. The performances of Winger and Russell are captivating, as well as those of the relatively minor characters. The setting and the dialogue also add to a flawless piece of work.Synopsis: Winger, an ambitious federal agent, doing paperwork on a Mafia boss' death, and sick of her desk job, becomes intrigued with Ondine's Curse, a painless, nonviolent, death that occurs when sleeping. She then stumbles on a couple of similar cases where the now-wealthy widow suddenly disappears afterwards. She follows up several leads. One of them goes to Seattle, where she meets a potential victim, a good, shy, and kind wealthy newly married anthropologist. He dies soon thereafter and Winger blames herself for his death. She then follows the black widow to Hawaii to her next victim. The rest I leave up to the viewer in order not to spoil the movie further.Both women are portrayed as being very intelligent and driven. Winger is at first obsessed with leaving her desk job and later in catching the black widow. Russell is a master (mistress?) manipulator (who could have been a chess champion), but who nonetheless is ""cracked."" She repeatedly states that she truly, honestly, loved all her previous husbands and her facial expressions accent her declarations.

228927,A1G5Q9HBN0EGDV,6300249867,Bobby Underwood,"[68, 78]","You can just about forget everyone else in this film other than Debra Winger and Theresa Russell. This sexy film is basically a two person film noir shot in bright colors, some of it in Hawaii. It is filled with excitement and seduction. Both the leads are wonderful to watch, their chemistry magnificent in this Bob Rafelson (Man Trouble, Five Easy Pieces) film.Debra Winger is Alex Barnes, bogged down in a government desk job dealing with statistics. But when she sees a pattern of deaths that lead to Theresa Russell, a dangerously beautiful woman with ice in her veins, she becomes obsessed with catching a killer. Theresa Russell, who has used more names than Jason Bourne, is just as smart as she is sexy, and almost the entire film is one long seduction scene as Russell spins her web around Alex.It seems a lot of rich men have suddenly died on Russell and Alex knows why. She is what is called a Black Widow, a woman who mates and then kills. No one has found any evidence to prove it, however, and Alex's attempt to catch her at it becomes murky as a seduction begins to take place.The locations and the stars are beautiful and as Winger and Russell circle each other in this game with deadly stakes you can't take your eyes off them. Winger's Alex is smart and determined, but vulnerable, and Russell gives a flawless and sexy performance as a smart and icy beauty with a heart full of venom.The electricity between the two characters jumps off the screen. The pool scene where they first meet gives us an indication of what is to come as Alex attempts to get close to Russell, with some unexpected twists. The formost of these is a scene when Alex gives Russell a Black Widow pendant, a spider who mates and kills its lover. Russell's response plays with the fragile but determined Alex as she begins to doubt herself.You don't want to miss this one. It's gorgeous to look at and has two riveting performances from Winger and Russell.

That said, BLACK WIDOW still makes good viewing because it remains true to itself and the premises it has set up, and Debra Winger and Theresa Russell do a smashing job on their characters.  It also has an interesting style, managing a noir atmosphere even while filming a considerable portion of the story in the bright sunshine of Hawaii and dressing the leads in the blues and red-oranges of '80s fashions.Debra Winger plays a bright young unattached woman in a drab, stultifying life as a statistics accountant for the federal government.  She does not openly indulge in self pity, but when she identifies a wisp of a possible crime in the statistics she compiles, she sells all her possessions and quits her job to pursue the case on her own.  The case surrounds Theresa Russell's character who Winger believes marries older men and somehow precipitates their deaths to reap their inheritances, what is called a black widow.  This is all established with swift efficiency, as is the guilt of Russell's character.  The suspense lies in if and how Alex will corner her black widow, who is equally intelligent.  The two make a sensational pairing, circling around each other, getting closer and closer.Leonard Maltin's movie guide says the film doesn't deliver the big pay-off.

As good as the plot for ""Black Widow"" is, the characters give it greater gravity.Here's the scoop. Theresa Russell plays a gorgeous, sexy woman, who befriends rich men, marries them, then kills them in ways to not arouse suspicion. As she does so in widely separated areas of the U.S. she doesn't arouse suspicion. Almost. Enter dowdy Debra Winger from the Justice Department. She has a hunch these deaths might be related. She talks her boss into letting her switch from inside researcher to field investigator so she can head to Hawaii and ensnare the Black Widow.The plot here is good enough, but the juxtaposition of the two characters is what gives it its resonance. On one hand you have the sexy black widow. She treats her ensnaring of men as a job. She studies the guys she wants to marry. She studies the things they like to show compatibility so as to heighten her chance of becoming the lover, then wife. Then there's Debra Winger. All she has is her job. Her hair style is low maintenance. Her clothes are nondescript and fit her like potato sacks. Her boss wants to get into her knickers but she's more like one of he guys. She's intrigued by Russell and, at some level, admires her....sexuality(?). She gets a taste of that life.

The movie world needs them. Russell, as an actress, generally lacks Winger's inner-fire, but some of her close-ups are more revealing than her dialogue anyway(watch for the scene on the beach after the scuba diving accident). In 1987, this was considered a modest hit which got generally good reviews(Roger Ebert panned it, however). So it's fair to say the movie is highly underrated and should be seen by anyone who loves a good mystery or a great acting match between two top-flight stars.

228943,AYPS4RCXEFSJP,6300249867,K. Boullosa,"[3, 4]","This sly, underrated 1987 crime thriller from Bob Rafaelson is carried by the excellent work of its two protagonists, played by Theresa Russell and Debra Winger.  While its premise hardly breaks new ground in either the broader genre or its subset (films in which the identity of the killer is known from the beginning), the sexual innuendo that emerges between the hunter and the hunted feels fresh because of the charisma of the two stars.The film opens as Catherine Peterson (Theresa Russell), is heading back to New York City from a trip because of the sudden death of her husband of only two months, Sam, a wealthy publishing magnate quite a bit older than she. Catherine is beautifully and stylishly dressed, a real ""Fifth Avenue Blonde"".  Although she hugs a photo of her dead husband to herself as she weeps on their bed when she returns home, the first thing she has done is empty the remains of his brandy bottle into the bathroom sink and wash it out.  The viewer sees just enough to be initially uncertain as to who and what Catherine is, as she seems genuinely overcome with grief.However, the viewer is not left in doubt for long, because Catherine is next seen as a blowzy redhead in a tight dress with long red nails, speaking with a southern accent, charming Ben, her latest, older husband (Dennis Hopper, in a brief but hilarious cameo) - a wealthy toy manufacturer. Within two months, Ben has mysteriously died of unknown causes (although by now the audience knows that his bride injected a hard to detect poison into his unopened brandy bottle).  However, this time ""Catherine"" runs into trouble in claiming her rights under her husband's will: his sister (Diane Ladd) threatens to contest it, claiming she has investigated the young widow's claims of her family's origin, and found them to be false.  Catherine buys the sister off with a large cash gift from the estate.It is at this point that Alex Barnes (Debra Winger) comes into the picture. An analyst for the Justice Department, Alex is very good at what she does, searching for patterns that may point to criminal activity, but she does it in a little cubicle, sitting at a computer, in an office with windows that are blacked out with green paint.  Alex is bored and desperately wants a field assignment that will get her out of the office.  Although Alex is pretty, she doesn't date and it is hinted that her lack of a private life and her persona as ""one of the boys"" has raised questions about her.  At the least, we see that she lacks confidence in her femininity and has submerged all her longings into her job.One day Alex tells her boss that she has tagged a series of deaths of wealthy older men that have been diagnosed as ""Ondine's Curse"" (apparently healthy middle-aged men dying in their sleep for no reason).  But Alex has connected what she thinks is the same woman with two such recent deaths (the film's first two dead spouses), and thinks it's murder, not Ondine's Curse.  Alex begs her boss to let her take the field assignment and see if she can find the woman and prove the cases were murder.  He grudgingly consents, and Alex heads first to Manhattan, where, after a visit to her quarry's first ex-sister-in-law, she obtains a photo of ""Catherine"" (the real name of Russell's character is never revealed).  Alex's next visit is to the greedy sister-in-law whose suspicions about Catherine were silenced by that large gift, although the gift does't stop her from repeating her suspicions to the lady from the Justice Department.Next Alex tracks ""Catherine"" to Seattle, where the tacky redhead has morphed into ""Margaret"", a sedate, intellectual, quietly dressed, brown-haired woman interested in the Native cultures of the Pacific Northwest.  Of course, what she is really interested in is William McRory (Nicol Williamson) the retiring, shy, middle-aged millionaire who curates a museum devoted to the Coast Salish peoples, and who leads its Board.  Catherine/Margaret, through a million-dollar gift to the museum, gets herself a place on the Board, and in no time at all she has seduced and married McRory, a charming man who also happens to be allergic to penicillin.At this point, Catherine/Margaret suddenly becomes aware that someone is on her trail.  Alex has managed to get to talk to McRory by posing as a free-lance journalist who wants to do an article on his wife.  When McRory tells Catherine/Margaret this, she makes a quick call to her erstwhile sister-in-law in Manhattan, who says that yes, a young woman from the Justice Department has been asking questions.  Frightened and infuriated, Catherine/Margaret decides it's time to get out of Dodge, and asks her doctor for some penicillin for the tonsillitis she is so susceptible to in Seattle's damp climate.  Soon afterward, the gentle McRory is dead and no one finds the traces of penicillin crushed into his toothpaste - the diagnosis is heart failure brought on by anaphylactic shock, from unknown causes.  Alex's enraged accusations to the local police fall on deaf ears - they refuse to reopen the case.McRory's death is the final convincing evidence for Alex that Catherine/Margaret is indeed her serial murderer - what is more, Alex liked the scholarly curator and she feels guilty for not warning him of his danger, unlikely though it is that he would have listened to her.  Now, her need to capture the Black Widow is driven as much by a sense of guilt and responsibility as it is by the thrill of the chase and ambition.Alex then tracks Catherine/Margaret, now calling herself ""Rennie Walker"", to Hawaii, where she already has her fangs in her next victim, an international hotel tycoon, Paul Nuytten (Sami Frey). It is here that Alex and ""Rennie"" finally meet, in a scuba diving class, as the intricate, final phase of the dance between Alex and the Black Widow begins, and the charged, ambivalent relationship between the two women begins to emerge.It is unclear whether Rennie knows immediately that her new friend ""Jane"" is Alex the investigator.  But they become close friends very quickly.  Rennie lends the unkempt Alex a cocktail dress and sends her to her own hairdresser, and Alex shows up that evening at a party at Paul's palatial estate looking transformed. It becomes clear as she gets to know Rennie, that even in the full knowledge of Rennie's crimes, Alex is wistfully envious of Rennie's sexual confidence, style, and skill with men, and that on some level Alex wishes she were more like Rennie.  In one scene, when it becomes clearer that Rennie suspects that she is talking not to her new ""friend"" but to her hunter, Rennie tries to explain that she loved all her husbands deeply and that the problem is, no amount of money is enough money to make her feel really safe.  Russell handles this ambiguity well: conveying admirably that her character has enough insight to recognize the potent forces driving her but not enough sanity to challenge them.Rennie next encourages a brief fling between Alex and Paul - she has seen that Alex is attracted to Paul, and that Paul is intrigued by Alex's innocence and reticence, although he has been pressing Rennie to marry him.  Paul obliges Rennie by making love to Alex, while Rennie hires a sleazy private detective (James Hong) with a heroin addiction to photograph Alex and Paul together.  As soon as he gets the photographs, Rennie murders the detective by holding a gun to his head while forcing him to take an overdose.  Then, Rennie finally agrees to marry Paul, who breaks off the affair with Alex.  Remembering what happened to McRory, Alex tells Paul who she is and tries to warn him about Rennie, but Paul refuses to listen, and indignantly points out that with Rennie's agreement, their estates have been left to the Cancer Foundation.By this time, Alex is aware that Rennie knows who she is, although Alex also knows that Rennie knows there is still no substantive proof of Rennie's actions that would stand up in court.  After her marriage to Paul, Rennie feels reasonably secure, but Alex comes to Rennie and Paul's wedding and gives the bride a brooch in the shape of a Black Widow spider.  Rennie murmurs that she's enjoyed their relationship, and that ""Truth is, I'm sorry it's over.""  Alex replies, ""The truth is, it's not over yet.""  Rennie knows then that she has to get rid of Alex and springs the trap she has prepared: Rennie plants the poison she will use on Paul in the cheap cottage Alex has rented, and goes off on one of her ""trips"" - sure enough, she is called back suddenly when Paul is found dead, another victim of Ondine's Curse.  The police find the body of the detective and the photographs of Paul and Alex embracing, and Rennie insists that the only person who really had reason to murder Paul is the rejected Alex, and the police search Alex's cottage and find the poison.After utilizing a little-known testamentary clause that allows her to cancel Paul's bequest of his entire estate to the Cancer Foundation, all signs point to the Black Widow having trapped Alex, rather than the other way around.This is a stylish, well-played story, and this reviewer has watched it several times over the years with the same enjoyment.  It is not so much the actual plot (which has some quite far-fetched moments) as the work of the actors that is so engaging, as they shape their portrayals of two women who are so different yet so oddly in sync with each other.  It is particularly pleasurable watching Russell shift identities as she stalks her victims and adapts to their tastes, interests, and cultural backgrounds.  The supporting players are excellent, with Dennis Hopper very droll as the toy manufacturer and Nicol Williamson sweetly attractive as the chair of the museum Board, William McRory.Try it some rainy Saturday night - this is a highly entertaining neo-noir effort!",4,Intriguing Cat & Mouse Thriller,1207180800,"04 3, 2008",2008,9850,"['sly', 'underrated', '1987', 'crime', 'thriller', 'Bob',

My only copy is on the nearly extinct laserdisc so I decided to rent the DVD.  This isn't the only movie or character with the black widow in the title.  There is one from 1954 that has nothing to do with this iteration.  There's even the most recent Black Widow character in the new ""Avengers"" film.  That character, played by Scarlet Johansson does have something in common with this film's invented name.  Here she is played by Theresa Russell.  What do they have in common?  They are both beautiful and are very good actors.In 1987 Debra Winger was the superstar however and plays a geeky FBI agent who works in a building with green windows.  Alexandra (Winger) stumbles upon a series of mysterious deaths involving wealthy men dying in their sleep.  With help from a flirtatious co-worker and an ancient IBM computer she draws a bead on the widow played by Russell.  She uses numerous names but for now we'll use her last alias, Catharine.  Alex gets the OK from her boss (Terry O'Quinn) to do some field work.  This leads her to Hawaii where Catharine has taken up with her next victim, Paul (miscast Sami Frey) a hotel baron in the state.Alex and Catharine meet and become friendly although Alex is ultimately trying to save Paul who she has quickly fallen for.  If you're seeing this for the first time you might think Alex and Catharine might be right for each other.  I would have liked for the plot to follow that interesting twist, but another turns the film in the direction of the more traditional.  Director Bob Rafelson gets some excellent performances from Winger and Russell and a few of his usual tribe (Dennis Hopper, Lois Smith, and Diane Ladd) but almost blows it with Sami Frey who is a real dud as Paul.  I don't know if it is his French accent, his mannerisms or just his acting style but he isn't very convincing and certainly develops no chemistry with either actress.

I'd heard Black Widow, in which Theresa plays the title character, bandied about for years as the height of sexy thriller-dom, so I finally got around to checking it out. While it's not a completely awful movie, it's not all that great, either.Russell plays Catherine Petersen, a very rich lady who got that way when her previous husbands died under very mysterious circumstances. On the opposite side of the fence is Alexandra Barnes (Debra Winger), a Federal agent who, as the beginning of the movie progresses (and as we see the mysterious circumstances under which her latest late husband, played by Dennis Hopper, meets his end), becomes obsessed with tracking Petersen down and bringing her to task. Her boss (Terry O'Quinn) is worried that her obsession is clouding her judgment, so he orders her to take a vacation. She chooses Hawaii, which just happens to be where Petersen is wooing her potential next victim. Things get more comlicated when Alex falls for him as well.And really, do we need more complexity than that? Whether we do or not, Ronald Bass' script gives it to us in spades. (Wait'll you see the climax, which is just beyond silly.) But despite all that, it's quite a pretty thing, as you'd have to expect from any film that's half-set in Hawaii (to be fair, it's probably more beautiful because Alex's office is so dingy), and both Winger and Russell overact this thing halfway to heaven.

Many of the other reviewers tell almost the whole story, stopping short only just in time to avoid giving away the ending, but few of them mention the extraordinary sexual tension between Winger and Russell, each beautiful in her own way.  Apparently not quite clear to several of the reviewers here is the fact that Winger's character is quite sure almost from the time she stumbles across accounts of several suspicious deaths that Russell's character is the killer.  It's not about finding it out at all -- it's about proving it.  When the two finally meet they are drawn to one another in spite of the suspicions each has about the other. Their supposed friendship is a device that each tries to work to her advantage, but the erotic pull between them as they play cat and mouse is real and can only be called delicious.  The minor roles are well played, especially by Nicol Williamson and the mannered, strange Dennis Hopper and Lois Smith.  If there is a weak link here, it is Samy Frey, who speaks his lines as if he learned them phonetically and wishes he were back in Paris.  Beautiful as the Hawaiian scenery is, the brief time spent near Seattle is just as beautiful. ""Black Widow"" is a movie that can be enjoyed many times.",4,Engrossing,1313884800,"08 21, 2011",2011,1297,"['Not', 'great', 'film', 'fascinating', 'quite', 'wonderful', 'one', 'Many', 'other', 'reviewers', 'tell', 'almost', 'whole', 'story', 'stopping', 'short', 'only', 'just', 'time', 'avoid', 'giving', 'away', 'ending', 'few', 'mention', 'extraordinary', 'sexual', 'tension', 'Winger', 'Russell', 'beautiful', 'own', 'way', 'Apparently', 'not', 'quite', 'clear', 'several', 'reviewers', 'here', 'fact', 'Winger', 'character', 'quite', 'sure', 'almost', 'time', 'accounts', 'several', 'suspicious', 'deaths', 'Russell', 'character', 'killer', 'not', 'finding', 'out', 'proving', 'When', 'two', 'finally', 'are', 'drawn', 'one', 'spite', 'suspicions', 'other', 'supposed', 'friendship', 'device', 'tries', 'work', 'advantage', 'erotic', 'pull', 'play', 'cat', 'mouse', 'real', 'can', 'only', 'be', 'called', 'delicious', 'minor', 'roles', 'are', 'well', 'played', 'especially', 'Nicol', 'Williamson', 'mannered', 'strange', 'Dennis', 'Hopper', 'Lois', 'Smith', 'weak', 'link', 'here', 'Samy', 'Frey', 'who', 'lines', 'learned', 'phonetically', 'wishes', 'were', 'back', 'Paris', 'Beautiful', 'Hawaiian', 'scenery', 'brief', 'time', 'spent', 'Seattle', 'just', 'as', 'beautiful', 'Black', 'Widow', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'enjoyed', 'many', 'times']",Black Widow VHS
