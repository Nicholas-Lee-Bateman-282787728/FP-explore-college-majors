1463648,A2QZVW56O4WSBT,B005K8QIS0,Cloggie Downunder,"[0, 0]","This DVD contains six one-hour episodes that cover the first three books in Kate Atkinson's popular Jackson Brodie series. Jason Isaacs is perfectly cast as Jackson Brodie, Millie Innes is delightful as his daughter, Marlee, Amanda Abbington does a great DC Louise Munroe, Phillip Davis departs from his usual bad guy casting to play a lovely Theo Wyre, Sylvia Syms is marvellous as Binky Rain and Natasha Little plays an excellent Julia Land. The episodes based on Case Histories depart from that by being set in Edinburgh and introducing DC Munroe early, but apart from that, follows the book quite well and is very enjoyable. The next two episodes, based on One Good Turn, follow the general plot of the book but with some significant changes that involve Jackson more in events than in the book. Despite these departures, they are still very enjoyable. Brian McCardie plays the perfect villain, Terence Smith, in these two episodes, and Orla O'Rourke does a great Tatiana. The last two episodes are based on When Will There Be Good News. Gwyneth Keyworth plays a delightful Reggie Chase. Once again, there are significant departures from the book, but the bones of the plot are adhered to. There is more interaction between Munroe and Brodie, and it will be interesting to see how this plays out in series two, as Munroe is largely absent in the next book.

1463652,ALBYN6ZDZCXZ5,B005K8QIS0,Dr Mike C,"[121, 129]","I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series.  The acting is quite good, and the cast consists of many veteran UK actors who are recognizable from other dramas. The series is well written.  It weaves together multiple investigations within each story line.  For example, the first drama consists of three investigations, as well as developments in the private life of the main protagonist, Jason Isaacs. I watched the UK episodes without captions and the PBS episodes with captions, and the use of captions greatly helped me understand the dialogue. I strongly urge using the subtitles.The structure used by the BBC in broadcasting this series was to air twin one-hour episodes on consecutive nights; resulting in a single drama consisting of approximately one-hour and 55 minutes.  The only problem that I have with this structure is that you have a climax in the middle of the drama, which seems unnecessary when the two episodes are viewed back to back (as opposed to on consecutive nights.)Beginning next week, PBS will start to show these dramas in two-hour blocks (the twin UK episodes joined together).  When watching the series, keep in mind that PBS has redacted approximately 5 minutes or so in order to fit the episode into the allocated time slot. The DVD, which is not produced by PBS, contains the full UK episodes.  The 5 minutes or so cut are substantive (e.g., (i)in the first drama - scene where father abuses daughter is drastically cut, and (ii) in the third drama, the kidnapped victim's escape is drastically cut), and don't include the additional non-substantive cuts (e.g., one set of credits and titles, as well as the scene at the start of the second hour of the drama that remind the audience of what transpired on the previous night).My only complaint regarding the DVD is the price.  $36 is a bit steep for less than six hours of TV.  I will wait until the price comes down.  For example, I purchased Downton Abbey for under $20 when it first came out, and it is cheaper now.  I expect a series like this to sell for $25 or so.  Considering the limited content (under six hours), I don't think that a higher price is justified.

Hernandez ""Call me Harry""","[12, 20]","CASE HISTORIES, (2011, based on the novel by Kate AtkinsonCase Histories : A Novel) stars one of my immortal favorites, Jason Isaacs, as P.I. Brodie, an ex-cop P.I. from Edinburgh with some demons he wrestles mostly through his work. Oddly, Edinburgh residents pop out from left, right and center to beg P.I. Brodie to find someone for them, to solve a crime the police can't.The wife and I, who are big fans of Jason Isaacs, found this very first installment to be delightful. Shown on ""Masterpiece Mystery"", we found it telling, beautifully acted, with the right amount of everything. I was amazed at the natural humor that was expertly showcased here - all this modern noir in the European mysteries is getting on my nerves. When they do good, natural humor with the noir, then I feel it's much more realistic and enjoyable.Isaacs has some tough nuts to crack - to say nothing of the cases those nuts bring to his doorstep. They even follow him around the city to solicit his services! The best is Binkie (the galactic Sylvia Sims), the cat-loving, eccentric 80-year-old lady who calls on Brodie as if he were a son to her. She wants one of her cats located. She wants Brodie to watch her property at night since she feels unsafe. ""That's all I ask,"" she purrs happily when Brodie good naturedly agrees to all her demands.In this first episode, Brodie must juggle locating a long-gone niece, solving the murder of a young college girl, to say nothing of bringing his 11-year-old daughter with him on work-related trips. Quite excellent all round.Isaacs, with Brodie, has brought us a new detective, THE new detective: he's urban, sexy, as smart as Sherlock Holmes, a bit devious in a good way, and outsmarts the police every time. His Scots accent is heavily riddled with North-of-England notes but is as deep and rumbling as a spring storm. In fact I see lot is based on Sherlock Holmes - and no accident that Brodie is a native of Edinburgh like Holmes' real-life inspiration Dr. Joseph Bell.A warning: there is graphic violence and sex in this. It made me boiling angry. One star deducted only for that. All this gratuitous sex and violence ... WHY? And before you accuse me of ""censorship"", think about this: I used to watch Masterpiece Theater with my parents. I would be ashamed for them to see some of the scenes in these films today. All I ask is A WARNING, a good rating system. That's all I ask.With that tirade off my chest, I say get these gems (there are more, assuredly; I've only seen the beginning of all this). Brodie is as fine a detective as I've seen these long years, and you never know when Isaacs will quit or the series will be stopped.

The lead character is haunted by the death of his sister, many years ago. Jason Isaacs, of Lord Malfoy fame in Harry Potter, is superb as Jackson Brodie. Edinburgh, Scotland, is another rich character in this collection of three mysteries, based on Kay Atkinson's books. Isaacs is pitch-perfect, every nuance evoked with subtley. You totally believe his character. The young Millie Innes, who plays Jason Brodie's daughter, is a rare talent. Much is explored about the depth of love between Brodie and his daughter. The last mystery is excellent, with Gwyneth Keyworth as an articulate, remarkable teenage girl with secrets of her own. Keyworth deserves a long career in British film and TV. All three mysteries delve into how past and present merge, how one copes with traumatic memories. The stories have rich narrative landscape and first-class acting. The stormy acting of Brian McCardie (the only bright spot in the last ""Murphy's Law"") is another treat. The short interviews with the actors (especially Isaacs), the writer, and producer are worth watching as well, for their articulate intelligence.Thanks to a kind comment on another of my reviews, I tracked down this mysterious offering, as it didn't arise under a search for ""Scottish mystery"" in DVDs.

There are exceptions.Kate Atkinson has written some superior crime novels around English private investigator Jackson Brody, a former police man.

Now her father has died and the girl's sisters find her Blue Mouse toy in father's desk.A young girl starts an internship in her father's law firm. On her first day in office, a man shows up with a knife, kills her, and disappears.While a woman is in jail for murdering her husband, her little girl disappears from foster care.Lots of problems for Brody.This is the only book of hers that I read myself. My daughter tells me that her others are also good.A BBC series with 6 episodes based on 3 of Atkinson's Brody novels has been produced and shown on TV in summer 2011. This is brand-new stuff.

1463662,A28YDMI499J1X9,B005K8QIS0,J. Janssen,"[7, 10]","I originally saw this on Masterpiece Mystery and really enjoyed it.  I particularly liked the converging plot lines and the inspired casting.  After ordering the DVD set and watching the six episodes (the original Brit series was shot as a six part 1 hour TV series, but shown on PBS as three two hour episodes)  my opinion was reinforced with the observation that three major ingredients of a successful series had been met.  If it was intended just to be a one off cinema production I would have given it 5 stars.  However, if viewed as a longer term series it has some problems.I can't think of one Brit crime series that has gone on to greatness that doesn't have the lead protagonist ensconced in a structured environment or ""family"".  Morse, Lewis, Barnaby, Foyle, Rebus and Frost all had a support system where they could play against their ""intellectually inferior"" co-workers or rail against the constraints of their organization.  Sherlock had the same in his Watson and Poirot had his ""posse"" of hanger-ons.  American crime shows are even more locked into this formulae; just witness NYPD Blue, Law & Order, The Closer, etc, etc.  If you go back in time to where televised ""Private Eye"" fiction was more the norm that it is today even the self employed P.I. had his stable screen family to keep him grounded or, at the very least, dealing with conflict issues that added to the character and subplot of these serialized scripts (Rockford/Magnum).  However, those PI feature length films that starred the lone wolf rarely made the grade. Witness the great literary detectives of the 50's and 60's, Lew Harper and Travis McGee.  While the books were serial best sellers for the authors (Ross MacDonald & John D. MacDonald) the movies were mediocre at best.  What's good on the written page doesn't always successfully transcend to television or the movie theatre.That said, the Brodie character is hanging out there pretty much by himself and I'm not sure that a long distance daughter and ex wife, plus a love hate relationship with his former boss is going to cut it.  They need to come up with a buddy, a stable but competing love interest, or some other friction inducing device and then establish a more fixed narrative as to how he has landed where he has in order to sustain this as a series in the future.  A Tony Horowitz penned prequel that goes beyond the constraints of the Kate Atkinson novels might be just the ticket.  If this is to be an ongoing series I hope year 2  will tell us more about Jackson's past and thereby insure his future.  If they can bridge that divide this series has the makings of a first class production.And just an aside regarding Jason Isaacs portrayal as Jackson Brodie; how inept does the James Bond franchise look for not wrapping this guy up as the next 007?  He's the first actor since Sean Connery that could wear the role like Savile Row suit and add another decade to a flagging series.",4,"Great cast, good stories, but where to go from here?",1325203200,"12 30, 2011",2011,2943,"['originally', 'saw', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'particularly', 'liked', 'converging', 'plot', 'lines', 'inspired', 'casting', 'ordering', 'DVD', 'set', 'watching', 'six', 'episodes', 'original', 'Brit', 'series', 'was', 'shot', 'six', 'part', '1', 'hour', 'TV', 'series', 'shown', 'PBS', 'three', 'two', 'hour', 'episodes', 'opinion', 'was', 'reinforced', 'observation', 'three', 'major', 'ingredients', 'successful', 'series', 'had', 'been', 'met', 'was', 'intended', 'just', 'be', 'one', 'off', 'cinema', 'production', 'would', 'have', 'given', '5', 'stars', 'However', 'viewed', 'longer', 'term', 'series', 'problems.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'think', 'one', 'Brit', 'crime', 'series', 'gone', 'greatness', ""n't"", 'have', 'lead', 'protagonist', 'ensconced', 'structured', 'environment', 'family', 'Morse', 'Lewis', 'Barnaby', 'Foyle', 'Rebus', 'Frost', 'had', 'support', 'system', 'where', 'could', 'play', 'intellectually', 'inferior', 'co-workers', 'rail', 'constraints', 'organization', 'Sherlock', 'had', 'same', 'Watson', 'Poirot', 'had', 'posse', 'hanger-ons', 'American', 'crime', 'shows', 'are', 'even', 'more', 'locked', 'formulae', 'just', 'witness', 'NYPD', 'Blue', 'Law', 'Order', 'Closer', 'etc', 'etc', 'go', 'back', 'time', 'where', 'televised', 'Private', 'Eye', 'fiction', 'was', 'more', 'norm', 'today', 'even', 'self', 'employed', 'P.I', 'had', 'stable', 'screen', 'family', 'keep', 'grounded', 'very', 'least', 'dealing', 'conflict', 'issues', 'added', 'character', 'subplot', 'serialized', 'scripts', 'Rockford/Magnum', 'However', 'PI', 'feature', 'length', 'films', 'starred', 'lone', 'wolf', 'rarely', 'made', 'grade', 'great', 'literary', 'detectives', '50', '60', 'Lew', 'Harper', 'Travis', 'McGee', 'books', 'were', 'serial', 'best', 'sellers', 'authors', 'Ross', 'MacDonald', 'John', 'D.', 'MacDonald', 'movies', 'were', 'mediocre', 'best', 'What', 'good', 'written', 'page', ""n't"", 'always', 'successfully', 'transcend', 'television', 'movie', 'theatre.That', 'said', 'Brodie', 'character', 'hanging', 'out', 'there', 'pretty', 'much', ""'m"", 'not', 'sure', 'long', 'distance', 'daughter', 'ex', 'wife', 'love', 'hate', 'relationship', 'former', 'boss', 'going', 'cut', 'need', 'come', 'up', 'buddy', 'stable', 'competing', 'love', 'interest', 'other', 'friction', 'inducing', 'device', 'then', 'establish', 'more', 'fixed', 'narrative', 'how', 'landed', 'where', 'order', 'sustain', 'series', 'future', 'Tony', 'Horowitz', 'penned', 'prequel', 'constraints', 'Kate', 'Atkinson', 'novels', 'might', 'be', 'just', 'ticket', 'be', 'ongoing', 'series', 'hope', 'year', '2', 'will', 'tell', 'more', 'Jackson', 'past', 'thereby', 'insure', 'future', 'can', 'bridge', 'divide', 'series', 'makings', 'first', 'class', 'production.And', 'just', 'aside', 'regarding', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'portrayal', 'Jackson', 'Brodie', 'how', 'inept', 'James', 'Bond', 'franchise', 'look', 'not', 'wrapping', 'guy', 'up', 'next', '007', 'first', 'actor', 'Sean', 'Connery', 'could', 'wear', 'role', 'Savile', 'Row', 'suit', 'add', 'decade', 'flagging', 'series']",CASE HISTORIES

Obviously portraying all the characters in the book gave him an intimate knowledge of his character and it shows in his delicately nuanced portrayal of tough former soldier and policeman turned private investigator Jackson Brodie.  Although he is catnip to the ladies, nonetheless Jackson is haunted by a past family tragedy, and struggles with varied degrees of success to balance his personal and professional life.The three episodes deal with variations of the same theme of him coming to the rescue of the bereaved, the lost and the dysfunctional residents of Edinburgh, Scotland.  Thie series is shot on location, and has a great supporting cast of both veterans and new faces. The haunting soundtrack features Iris Dement, Robert Plant & Allison Kraus, Mary Gauthier, Lucinda Williams and Nanci Guthier among others. This series has subject matter that is rather explicit in nature and several scenes which require the very fit Isaacs to be bare chested so if you have young ones it may require parental guidance.So if you like the mystery genre, Kate Atkinson writings or admire the sorely underused Isaacs, here is a real treat for you!",5,Jason Isaacs is Jackson Brodie,1320192000,"11 2, 2011",2011,1405,"['Apparently', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Complete', 'Collection', 'Years', '1-7', 'had', 'already', 'recorded', 'audio', 'books', 'Kate', 'Atkinson', 'mystery', 'Case', 'Histories', 'One', 'Good', 'Turn', 'When', 'Will', 'Be', 'Good', 'News', 'when', 'was', 'tapped', 'star', 'BBC', 'series', 'Obviously', 'portraying', 'characters', 'book', 'gave', 'intimate', 'knowledge', 'character', 'delicately', 'nuanced', 'portrayal', 'tough', 'former', 'soldier', 'policeman', 'turned', 'private', 'investigator', 'Jackson', 'Brodie', 'catnip', 'ladies', 'nonetheless', 'Jackson', 'haunted', 'past', 'family', 'tragedy', 'varied', 'degrees', 'success', 'balance', 'personal', 'professional', 'life.The', 'three', 'episodes', 'deal', 'variations', 'same', 'theme', 'coming', 'rescue', 'bereaved', 'lost', 'dysfunctional', 'residents', 'Edinburgh', 'Scotland', 'Thie', 'series', 'shot', 'location', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'veterans', 'new', 'haunting', 'soundtrack', 'Iris', 'Dement', 'Robert', 'Plant', 'Allison', 'Kraus', 'Mary', 'Gauthier', 'Lucinda', 'Williams', 'Nanci', 'Guthier', 'others', 'series', 'subject', 'matter', 'rather', 'explicit', 'nature', 'several', 'scenes', 'require', 'very', 'fit', 'Isaacs', 'be', 'bare', 'chested', 'so', 'have', 'young', 'ones', 'may', 'require', 'parental', 'guidance.So', 'like', 'mystery', 'genre', 'Kate', 'Atkinson', 'writings', 'admire', 'sorely', 'underused', 'Isaacs', 'here', 'real', 'treat']",CASE HISTORIES

1463666,A27H9DOUGY9FOS,B005K8QIS0,"K. Harris ""Film aficionado""","[33, 47]","First off, I think any show that has the wherewithal and good sense to cast the underrated Jason Isaacs in the leading role is worthy of a look. As a fan of these imported detective/mystery programs (this originally aired in the U.S. under the PBS Masterpiece Mystery banner), the BBC produced ""Case Histories"" seemed like a solid proposition. Adapted from the fourth novel of Kate Atkinson's popular Jackson Brodie series, ""Case Histories"" showcases six episodes (each is a two-parter) with interconnected and overlapping storylines. A typical individual show may introduce three or four disparate groups of characters with absolutely no relationship, but through happenstance and absolute coincidence will be tied together into the program's central mystery. Sadly, this overly convenient plotting really detracted from the show's allure for me. It's just too tidy, too written. In other aspects, the episodes are reaching for a brooding and realistic feel with a grounded Isaacs and better than average character development for guest stars. But oftentimes, the show's tone suffers as these ""real"" character types play out rather elaborate and fanciful plot lines. Sometimes dour, sometimes comedic, sometimes gritty--the feel of the show veers rather wildly all over the place.Isaacs plays an ex-cop in Edinburgh, Scotland who separated from the force amidst a controversy and now makes a living as a private investigator. Haunted by a trauma in his past, Isaacs seems continually drawn to cases in which young women have been harmed. In the first major case, he deals with (among a myriad of other things) the 30 year old mystery of a girl who went missing as new evidence is uncovered by her now adult sisters. In the next episodes, he deals with a Russian crime syndicate, unscrupulous business, and a mysterious dead body that he alone has seen. And in the final installment, the major action centers around another missing child--this one seemingly abducted for unknown reasons. Throughout, Isaacs is plagued by bad memories of a tragedy in his youth and his connection with these cases really can get personal. We get repeated flashbacks and, if that weren't enough, he is also dealing with a big change in his relationship with his plucky daughter.If anything, there is too much going on. And it is all too coincidental. Take, for example, a moment from the second case. Isaacs witnesses a attack in a parking structure that happens to eventually tie to EVERYTHING else that he is working on. Within this one scene, he happens to be in the exact location as a hitman that will prove pivotal to the plot, an author with a past that connects him to the case, and the police chief's son. Wow! A matter of good timing put four central but relatively unrelated characters together in one spot! And this is but one example of many. Coincidence is the unifying theme that drives all of the narrative momentum. That said, this is still a pretty entertaining watch. It just misses out on the complexities that would have made it terrific. Isaacs is a dynamic leading man, both tough and suitably hardened but with a unexpected softness. I liked the characterization a lot. The supporting cast and guest stars are uniformly excellent. But as a Masterpiece Mystery fan and lover of detective fiction, the fact that I never really believed in the cases left me wanting a bit more. Good enough if you enjoy the genre, but a long way from its pinnacle. About 3 1/2 stars.

The scenery in Scotland is visually stunning. Inspired casting choices, original and intriguing plots, upbeat music, charming cinematography with great shots, and fun and fanciful dialogue make this a treat to watch. Based on books by Kate Atkinson who often has a streak of magical realism in her stories, this series has a bit of that, too. I found it added to the charm, and didn't detract, if you're not looking for a lot of realism in the the mystery.Plot lines intertwine and keep you interested, but beware, Brodie jumps around in his sleuthing. I enjoy the variety and eccentric characters and situations that keep coming at you.Because of the humor, it keeps the stories from being too grim. It's fairly light-hearted although deals with serious crimes. Somehow the interest is finding out how Brodie, the underdog, is going to help the down and out with his limited and overtaxed resources.

1463674,A308QC9XPFHFGJ,B005K8QIS0,"Malfoyfan ""Cath""","[7, 11]","Case Histories, a British mini-series, just wrapped up on ""Masterpiece Mystery"" on television.  This new adaptation of Kate Atkinson's work, starring Jason Isaacs as private detective Jackson Brodie, is excellent.  I've read all four of Atkinson's Brodie novels and really enjoyed them, so I was fairly excited to see this program and wondered if they'd do a good job.  Didn't have to worry.As one reviewer noted, any TV show that has the smarts to cast the underrated and underused Isaacs is worth checking out; this one also has good writing and great casting of all the other actors going for it too.  I thought the writers did an excellent job of paring down Atkinson's novels for television - cutting out unnecessary plot lines and characters to streamline the story and make it work quite well, at least for me.  I watched the show with my husband, who hasn't read the books, and he felt everything made sense and really enjoyed the program.  I remember while I read the books that there were parts I felt were unneeded, which are the same parts the writers took out.The main thrust of the story is that Brodie, ex-military and police officer, now private detective, gets involved in various investigations, some of which are connected.  Each episode has 3 cases in it.  As some reviewers have commented, there is a certain amount of coincidence in the cases being connected, but this may not bother some people (it doesn't bother me that much).  And some of the changes in the plot lines from book to TV show were necessary for clarity and time concerns, so an incident that seems more random in the book is a bit manipulated on TV.  There are also a couple of major plot lines that are completely missing from the TV version, but their exclusion is necessary to create a simpler and clearer story.What's great about the series is the acting - from the main characters to the minor ones.  Brodie's assistant Deborah and his daughter Marlee are especially memorable, as is Reggie from the third installment.  Isaacs is perfect as Brodie, capturing both the hard-boiled detective and the loving father with equal ease.  It's nice to see him playing a real person, rather than a plot-catalyst bad guy or bad-guy sidekick.Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys quality drama for grownups; be aware there's some cussing and a little sex here and there.",5,Excellent adaptation of Atkinson's work + Jason Issacs=I'm in!!,1320624000,"11 7, 2011",2011,2355,"['Case', 'Histories', 'British', 'mini-series', 'just', 'wrapped', 'up', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'television', 'new', 'adaptation', 'Kate', 'Atkinson', 'work', 'starring', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'private', 'detective', 'Jackson', 'Brodie', 'excellent', ""'ve"", 'read', 'four', 'Atkinson', 'Brodie', 'novels', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'so', 'was', 'fairly', 'excited', 'see', 'program', 'wondered', ""'d"", 'do', 'good', 'job', 'Did', ""n't"", 'have', 'worry.As', 'one', 'reviewer', 'noted', 'TV', 'show', 'smarts', 'cast', 'underrated', 'underused', 'Isaacs', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', 'one', 'also', 'good', 'writing', 'great', 'casting', 'other', 'actors', 'going', 'too', 'thought', 'writers', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'paring', 'down', 'Atkinson', 'novels', 'television', 'cutting', 'out', 'unnecessary', 'plot', 'lines', 'characters', 'streamline', 'story', 'make', 'work', 'quite', 'well', 'least', 'watched', 'show', 'husband', 'who', ""n't"", 'read', 'books', 'felt', 'everything', 'made', 'sense', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'program', 'remember', 'read', 'books', 'were', 'parts', 'felt', 'were', 'unneeded', 'are', 'same', 'parts', 'writers', 'took', 'out.The', 'main', 'thrust', 'story', 'Brodie', 'ex-military', 'police', 'officer', 'now', 'private', 'detective', 'involved', 'various', 'investigations', 'are', 'connected', 'episode', '3', 'cases', 'reviewers', 'have', 'commented', 'certain', 'amount', 'coincidence', 'cases', 'being', 'connected', 'may', 'not', 'bother', 'people', ""n't"", 'bother', 'much', 'changes', 'plot', 'lines', 'book', 'TV', 'show', 'were', 'necessary', 'clarity', 'time', 'concerns', 'incident', 'more', 'random', 'book', 'bit', 'manipulated', 'TV', 'are', 'also', 'couple', 'major', 'plot', 'lines', 'are', 'completely', 'missing', 'TV', 'version', 'exclusion', 'necessary', 'create', 'simpler', 'clearer', 'story.What', 'great', 'series', 'acting', 'main', 'characters', 'minor', 'ones', 'Brodie', 'assistant', 'Deborah', 'daughter', 'Marlee', 'are', 'especially', 'memorable', 'Reggie', 'third', 'installment', 'Isaacs', 'perfect', 'Brodie', 'capturing', 'hard-boiled', 'detective', 'loving', 'father', 'equal', 'ease', 'nice', 'see', 'playing', 'real', 'person', 'rather', 'plot-catalyst', 'bad', 'guy', 'bad-guy', 'sidekick.Highly', 'recommended', 'anyone', 'who', 'quality', 'drama', 'grownups', 'be', 'aware', 'cussing', 'little', 'sex', 'here', 'there']",CASE HISTORIES

1463680,A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4,B005K8QIS0,mirasreviews,"[11, 16]","""Case Histories"" is based on the novels of Kate Atkinson featuring Scottish private detective Jackson Brodie (Jason Isaacs), former soldier, formerly of the Edinburgh police force. Jackson Brodie is a brooding fellow, haunted by the death of his sister Eve when they were children, divorced, but close to his 8-year-old daughter Marlee (Millie Innes). Marlee is the bright light in this series in contrast to the cloudy Scottish skies and neurotic characters. She's bright and forthright, played by one of the most appealing child actors I've seen. Jackson is served and harassed by his critical, blunt-talking secretary Deborah (Zawe Ashton). He often turns to his former partner on the police force, DC Louise Munroe (Amanda Abbington), for help with his cases. She begrudgingly complies, as she genuinely respects Jackson but has a limited tolerance for his emotional baggage.This series is entertaining, and it's nice for American audiences to see a detective show based in Scotland rather than England. Each episode is two hours long and contains multiple mysteries, though the author tends to strain credibility by often having the disparate mysteries turn out to be somehow intertwined. My one criticism in the character writing is that Jackson Brodie is so neurotic that he's goofy. He is always tying himself up in knots about the distant past or some emotional upheaval. Good grief. The flashbacks to the death of Jackson's sister are repetitive and annoying. Really, people get past these things. It's no surprise that the less neurotic characters -daughter Marlee, DC Munroe, secretary Deborah- beg to be seen more. Jackson does have a biting, sardonic sense of humor when he dares show it, though.The three films are based on the novels ""Case Histories"", ""One Good Turn"", and ""When Will There Be Good News?"", in that order. They are simply called episodes 1, 2, and 3, however. The weakest and least plausible is episode 2. These are the films:Episode 1 introduces us to ex-police officer, now private investigator Jackson Brodie, who became a crime fighter on account of the death of his sister when he was a boy. While searching for the cat of his crotchety client Binky Rain (Sylvia Simms), he stumbles across the mystery of a little girl who disappeared from the house next door 30 years ago. The girl's sisters, Julia (Natasha Little) and Amelia Land (Fenella Woolgar) have found their sister's stuffed animal when going through their deceased father's things. They think Brodie is the man to find out what happened. A distraught Mr. Theo Wyre (Phil Davis) barges into Brodie's office to beg him to look into the murder of his daughter Laura (Rose Leslie), as he doesn't have confidence in the police investigation. And a manipulative Shirley Manning (Shauna MacDonald) wants him to find her niece who was put into foster care years ago.Episode 2 finds Brodie out for a jog, when he discovers the body of a young woman floating in the water. Looking for clues to her identity, he traces her to a maid service where the staff are afraid to speak to him. In the meantime, he has witnessed a man viciously beaten in an apparent mugging. A bystander, mystery writer Martin Canning (Adam Godley), saves the day by tossing his laptop at the assailant. But he fears retaliation and insists on hiring Brodie to protect him. Gloria Hatter's (Marion Bailey) husband has just had a heart attack while in the company of his dominatrix Tatiana (Orla O'Rourke). As he lay unconscious in a hospital bed, Marion discovers that their company Hatter Homes is under investigation, and an employee, Terence Smith (Brian McCardie) might be up to no good. Coincidentally, the three storylines turn out to be one.Episode 3 begins while Brodie is working on an adultery case. Gary Moore (Neil McInven), a nervous and possessive husband, has hired the detective to follow his wife Michelle (Morven Christie). Walking home from the job, Brodie tries to pull an elderly woman out of a car that is in the path of a speeding train, but he is struck himself. Revived by a young woman named Reggie Teague (Gwyneth Keyworh), Brodie limps out of the hospital to find that Moore won't stop pestering his secretary for news of the case, his wallet and phone have been stolen and replaced with Andrew Jones' ID, and Reggie thinks Brodie owes her a favor: Dr. Joanna Hunter (Neve McIntosh), for whom Reggie worked as a nanny, has gone missing with her baby. Husband Neil (Tom Goodman-Hill) claims that she is visiting relatives, but Reggie knows that she has none.",4,"Brooding, Scottish Detective Series Boasts Strong Supporting Characters.",1320019200,"10 31, 2011",2011,4545,"['Case', 'Histories', 'based', 'novels', 'Kate', 'Atkinson', 'featuring', 'Scottish', 'private', 'detective', 'Jackson', 'Brodie', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'former', 'soldier', 'formerly', 'Edinburgh', 'police', 'force', 'Jackson', 'Brodie', 'brooding', 'fellow', 'haunted', 'death', 'sister', 'Eve', 'when', 'were', 'children', 'divorced', 'close', '8-year-old', 'daughter', 'Marlee', 'Millie', 'Innes', 'Marlee', 'bright', 'light', 'series', 'contrast', 'cloudy', 'Scottish', 'skies', 'neurotic', 'characters', 'bright', 'forthright', 'played', 'one', 'most', 'appealing', 'child', 'actors', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'Jackson', 'served', 'harassed', 'critical', 'blunt-talking', 'secretary', 'Deborah', 'Zawe', 'Ashton', 'often', 'former', 'partner', 'police', 'force', 'DC', 'Louise', 'Munroe', 'Amanda', 'Abbington', 'help', 'cases', 'begrudgingly', 'complies', 'genuinely', 'Jackson', 'limited', 'tolerance', 'emotional', 'baggage.This', 'series', 'entertaining', 'nice', 'American', 'audiences', 'see', 'detective', 'show', 'based', 'Scotland', 'rather', 'England', 'episode', 'two', 'hours', 'long', 'multiple', 'mysteries', 'author', 'strain', 'credibility', 'often', 'having', 'disparate', 'mysteries', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'somehow', 'intertwined', 'one', 'criticism', 'character', 'writing', 'Jackson', 'Brodie', 'so', 'neurotic', 'goofy', 'always', 'tying', 'up', 'knots', 'distant', 'past', 'emotional', 'upheaval', 'Good', 'grief', 'flashbacks', 'death', 'Jackson', 'sister', 'are', 'repetitive', 'annoying', 'Really', 'people', 'get', 'things', 'surprise', 'less', 'neurotic', 'characters', '-daughter', 'Marlee', 'DC', 'Munroe', 'secretary', 'Deborah-', 'beg', 'be', 'seen', 'more', 'Jackson', 'have', 'biting', 'sardonic', 'sense', 'humor', 'when', 'show', 'though.The', 'three', 'films', 'are', 'based', 'novels', 'Case', 'Histories', 'One', 'Good', 'Turn', 'When', 'Will', 'Be', 'Good', 'News', 'order', 'are', 'simply', 'called', 'episodes', '1', '2', '3', 'however', 'weakest', 'least', 'plausible', 'episode', '2', 'are', 'films', 'Episode', '1', 'introduces', 'ex-police', 'officer', 'now', 'private', 'investigator', 'Jackson', 'Brodie', 'who', 'became', 'crime', 'fighter', 'account', 'death', 'sister', 'when', 'was', 'boy', 'searching', 'cat', 'crotchety', 'client', 'Binky', 'Rain', 'Sylvia', 'Simms', 'mystery', 'little', 'girl', 'who', 'disappeared', 'house', 'next', 'door', '30', 'years', 'ago', 'girl', 'sisters', 'Julia', 'Natasha', 'Little', 'Amelia', 'Land', 'Fenella', 'Woolgar', 'have', 'found', 'sister', 'stuffed', 'animal', 'when', 'going', 'deceased', 'father', 'things', 'think', 'Brodie', 'man', 'find', 'out', 'what', 'happened', 'distraught', 'Mr.', 'Theo', 'Wyre', 'Phil', 'Davis', 'Brodie', 'office', 'beg', 'look', 'murder', 'daughter', 'Laura', 'Rose', 'Leslie', ""n't"", 'have', 'confidence', 'police', 'investigation', 'manipulative', 'Shirley', 'Manning', 'Shauna', 'MacDonald', 'find', 'niece', 'who', 'was', 'put', 'foster', 'care', 'years', 'ago.Episode', '2', 'finds', 'Brodie', 'out', 'jog', 'when', 'body', 'young', 'woman', 'floating', 'water', 'Looking', 'clues', 'identity', 'maid', 'service', 'where', 'staff', 'are', 'afraid', 'speak', 'meantime', 'witnessed', 'man', 'viciously', 'beaten', 'apparent', 'mugging', 'bystander', 'mystery', 'writer', 'Martin', 'Canning', 'Adam', 'Godley', 'day', 'tossing', 'laptop', 'assailant', 'retaliation', 'insists', 'hiring', 'Brodie', 'protect', 'Gloria', 'Hatter', 'Marion', 'Bailey', 'husband', 'just', 'had', 'heart', 'attack', 'company', 'dominatrix', 'Tatiana', 'Orla', ""O'Rourke"", 'lay', 'unconscious', 'hospital', 'bed', 'Marion', 'company', 'Hatter', 'Homes', 'investigation', 'employee', 'Terence', 'Smith', 'Brian', 'McCardie', 'might', 'be', 'up', 'good', 'Coincidentally', 'three', 'storylines', 'turn', 'out', 'be', 'one.Episode', '3', 'begins', 'Brodie', 'working', 'adultery', 'case', 'Gary', 'Moore', 'Neil', 'McInven', 'nervous', 'possessive', 'husband', 'hired', 'detective', 'follow', 'wife', 'Michelle', 'Morven', 'Christie', 'Walking', 'home', 'job', 'Brodie', 'pull', 'elderly', 'woman', 'car', 'path', 'speeding', 'train', 'struck', 'Revived', 'young', 'woman', 'named', 'Reggie', 'Teague', 'Gwyneth', 'Keyworh', 'Brodie', 'hospital', 'find', 'Moore', 'wo', ""n't"", 'stop', 'pestering', 'secretary', 'news', 'case', 'wallet', 'phone', 'have', 'been', 'stolen', 'replaced', 'Andrew', 'Jones', 'ID', 'Reggie', 'Brodie', 'favor', 'Dr.', 'Joanna', 'Hunter', 'Neve', 'McIntosh', 'whom', 'Reggie', 'worked', 'nanny', 'gone', 'missing', 'baby', 'Husband', 'Neil', 'Tom', 'Goodman-Hill', 'visiting', 'relatives', 'Reggie', 'none']",CASE HISTORIES

It's all about Jason Isaacs and his portrayal of the main character. Wounded, strong, isolated, funny, big-hearted, immature...he is such a master at sharing all these emotions. This character seems so driven by his past, and so determined to keep from repeating it; at the same time he's ill-equipped to deal with his own emotional meltdown. It's a seriously challenging role, but Jason Isaacs, one of the most underrated actors in many years, does it as easily as taking his next breath. Amazing. The other characters are also wonderful, and are equally arresting in their scenes. The craziness of some of the cases is still made so believable by the fine acting of everyone in the cast. I can't wait to see the next season.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the occasional but gratuitous sex scenes. I'm no prude, but nothing irritates me more than graphic sex (however brief) that does nothing to further the story line.

1463688,A3RNP5X8ZGZIEI,B005K8QIS0,Stephanie De Pue,"[2, 4]","""Case Histories,"" a television series of British mysteries/police procedurals, is based on the popular novels by Kate Atkinson.  It was made by BBC Scotland, which intelligently moved the action from Yorkshire, where Atkinson had set it, to Edinburgh, Scotland; a more beautiful and interesting place.  In the U.K., this series was aired in twin one hour episodes on consecutive nights. This resulted in two episodes each of three single dramas, each crime drama based upon one particular Atkinson book that run approximately one hour 55 minutes each. Each drama has a mini-climax at the end of the first part, as well as at the end of the story arc.  And, thank goodness, for most of us not so conversant with Scottish dialog and usage, Acorn Media, the American releasing company, has kindly given us subtitles.Our detective here is Jackson Brodie (Golden Globe nominee Jason Isaacs,The State Within, who was a soldier in the British army, then an officer in the Lothian and Borders Police, an entity that will ring bells to any enthusiasts of Ian Rankin's Rebus novels, and TV series, as indeed, will Edinburgh itself.  However, the indefatigable detective has left the police for various reasons unspecified in the TV treatment, and turned private investigator.  His tough exterior hides the famous heart of gold, and he finds himself compelled to try to help all comers, looking into everything from lost cats and lost girls - many lost girls --to wayward spouses and killers on the run. He also does a lot of running himself, partly to unwind from the stresses of his work, but seemingly mostly to brood upon his own traumatic past.In the U.S., this series was recently seen on Masterpiece Mystery.  This ""more than successful adaptation"" (The Guardian, U.K.) of Atkinson's award-winning novels also stars Amanda Abbington, (After You've Gone - Series One); Natasha Little,(Another Life); Phil Davis, (Vera Drake); Sylvia Simms,(Alice's Restaurant), and Keith Allen (ROBIN HOOD). It was created for television by Ashley Pharaoh ofLife on Mars: The Complete Series.  It is a character-driven drama boasting an outstanding lead performance by Isaacs, who apparently was born to play brooding, handsome heroes.  And it's all set against the ruggedly beautiful Scottish scenery.Episode 1 is based uponCase Histories: A Noveland boasts three subplots.  As Brodie searches for one of the cats of his crotchety client Binky Rain (Sylvia Simms), he stumbles across the 30-year old mystery of a little girl who disappeared from the house next door. The girl's sisters, Julia (Natasha Little) and Amelia Land have found their little sister's stuffed toy, Blue Mouse, while going through their deceased father's things, where it ought not to be. A distraught Theo Wyre (Phil Davis) barges into Brodie's office to beg him to look into the murder of his daughter Laura, as he doesn't have confidence in the police investigation. And a manipulative nurse, Shirley Manning, wants him to find the niece who was put into foster care years ago.Episode 2, based uponOne Good Turn: A Novel, finds Brodie, while out for one of his jogs, discovering the body of a young woman floating in the ocean.  As he tries to establish her identity, he traces her to a Russian-owned and staffed maid service where the staff are afraid to speak to him. Meanwhile, Brodie witnesses a man brutally beaten in a multi-story  parking lot, in an apparent episode of road rage that has morphed into a mugging. Fortunately, a bystander, mystery writer Martin Canning tosses his laptop at the assailant, probably saving the victim's life. But the cowardly mystery writer fears retaliation and insists that Brodie must protect him. And Gloria Hatter's captain of industry husband has just had a heart attack while glorying in the company of his Russian immigrant dominatrix Tatiana. As the master of the universe lays dying unconscious in a hospital bed, his wife finds  that their company Hatter Homes is under investigation, as are her husband's other holdings, and an employee of his, Terence Smith might well be up to no good. Just by coincidence, the three cases turn out to be one.Episode 3, based uponWhen Will There Be Good News?: A Novelbegins as Brodie works an adultery case. Gary Moore, nervous and possessive husband, has hired the detective to follow his wife Michelle. Just by coincidence, again, as Brodie walks home from the job, he sees an elderly woman whose car has stalled on the tracks of a speeding train.  Brodie tries to pull her out of the car, but is struck himself.  He is saved and revived by a young woman, Reggie Teague, who had been studying with the retired schoolteacher.  When Brodie limps out of the hospital, he finds that Moore won't stop pestering his secretary for news of the infidelity case; also that his wallet and phone have been stolen and replaced with somebody else's, and that the young woman Reggie, who saved his life,  thinks Brodie now owes her a favor.  Dr. Joanna Hunter, for whom Reggie works as a nanny, has gone missing with her baby girl. Husband Neil claims that Dr. Hunter is visiting relatives, but Reggie knows that she has none to visit.It's an enjoyable and involving entertainment whose star is definitely easy on the eyes.  The acting is quite good, and, as indicated above, features many veteran, well-known British supporting players.  Dialog is fine and the interplay among the characters is consistently amusing.  Thanks to the subtitles, all is accessible to the viewer.  Direction is sharp, the ambiance is enviable, and there's been no visible stinting on extras, cars, interiors.  However, if the question is, is this series influenced by that Scottish school of mystery writers writing what's known as tartan noir, with tougher,more violent contents than is usual, my answer would have to be no.  I see no signs of it.  In the U.K., this series was aired in twin one hour episodes on consecutive nights. This resulted in two episodes each of three single dramas, each Direction is sharp, the ambiance is One major quibble: the plots are all almost Victorian in their reliance on coincidence: think those Thomas Hardy novels we were required to read in school. Odd, recently I received a hardcover copy of CASE HISTORIES as a gift, and wasn't that crazy about it.  Seems I prefer the TV series.

1463689,ASEBX8TBYWQWA,B005K8QIS0,"Steven I. Ramm ""Steve Ramm &#34;Anything Phon...","[2, 2]","When I received a review copy of the second season of this well-done crime/mystery series that was produced in 2011 by BBC Scotland (and affiliate of England&#8217;s BBC, but separate) I realized I had not seen the first season and it&#8217;s always best to start at the &#8220;beginning&#8221;, so I got this set of Season One. (Actually the package does not actually say &#8220;first season&#8221; as maybe the series hadn&#8217;t been renewed at that time. It has been though.).  I&#8217;ve not yet started watching the second volume but I can tell you that you really need to start at the beginning. There are continuing relationships that form in this set that will be essential to understand later volumes.So I&#8217;m a bit behind others in posting this review. As I post this there are already 92 reviews. But I want to make you aware that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film or TV series together, whether it was in theaters, on TV, Streaming or on DVD or Bluray. So I always recommend that folks sort by &#8220;Newest First&#8221; and then look at both the date and the format that the customer is reviewing. This is of the physical two-disc DVD package.It took a while for me to get into the stories but once I did, I was hooked. The Season consists of 3 &#8220;stories&#8221; based on a series of books by Kate Atkinson, with each &#8220;story&#8221; divided into two 59-minute episodes, with a cliffhanger at the end of the first part.  Each &#8220;crime&#8221; is solved within the two parts though there is a running &#8220;mystery&#8221; the central character (former cop &#8211; now a private detective &#8211; Jackson Brodie played by Jason Isaacs) and it will obviously continue into Series Two.I&#8217;ll let you read other reviews (but be aware of &#8220;spoilers&#8221;) for more on the content but will offer some suggestions for those in the US ordering this series:1) There is an English Subtitles&#8221; option on the DVD (added by Acorn Media). I recommend that you enable this feature &#8211; at least for episode one). There are quite a few Scottish words which will confuse you. Near the beginning Brodie is speaking French and shortly there after he is yelling the word &#8220;Niamh!&#8221;. As you&#8217;ll find out (not really a spoiler) that is the name of his younger sister. If you don&#8217;t need the subtitles after that, just turn them off.2) The series aired in the US on Masterpiece Mystery but in an EDITED version. Probably about 7 minutes or so. In addition to allowing for &#8220;funding messages&#8221; I&#8217;m sure it was for some pretty graphic violence and sex (each of the three stories has a sex act in it &#8211; though no nudity) as well as language (the S-word).Of the three stories &#8211; each of which has two crime stories running together &#8211; I really liked the third because of the character named Reggie, and actress playing her.The DVD has one Bonus Feature &#8211; a &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; featurette (15 minutes) with the cast as well as author Atkinson and the series Producer.  It&#8217;s here that we learn that actor Issacs was familiar with the Brodie books because he recorded the audiobook versions of them years ago.Now I&#8217;m ready to move on to Season Two and will post my review there when I finish it.I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm&#8220;Anything Phonographic&#8221;",5,Review of DVD of BBC Scotland &#8220;crime&#8221; series &#8211; incl special features (and NO &#8220;spoilers&#8221;),1403654400,"06 25, 2014",2014,3432,"['When', 'received', 'review', 'copy', 'second', 'season', 'well-done', 'crime/mystery', 'series', 'was', 'produced', '2011', 'BBC', 'Scotland', 'affiliate', 'England', '8217', 'BBC', 'separate', 'realized', 'had', 'not', 'seen', 'first', 'season', '8217', 'always', 'best', 'start', '8220', 'beginning', '8221', 'got', 'set', 'Season', 'One', 'Actually', 'package', 'not', 'actually', 'say', '8220', 'first', 'season', '8221', 'maybe', 'series', 'hadn', '8217', 'been', 'renewed', 'time', 'been', 'though.', '8217', 'not', 'yet', 'started', 'watching', 'second', 'volume', 'can', 'tell', 'really', 'need', 'start', 'beginning', 'are', 'continuing', 'relationships', 'form', 'set', 'will', 'be', 'essential', 'understand', 'later', 'volumes.So', '8217', 'bit', 'others', 'posting', 'review', 'post', 'are', 'already', '92', 'reviews', 'want', 'make', 'aware', 'Amazon', 'policy', 'grouping', 'ALL', 'reviews', 'ALL', 'formats', 'film', 'TV', 'series', 'together', 'was', 'theaters', 'TV', 'Streaming', 'DVD', 'Bluray', 'So', 'always', 'recommend', 'folks', 'sort', '8220', 'Newest', 'First', '8221', 'then', 'look', 'date', 'format', 'customer', 'reviewing', 'physical', 'two-disc', 'DVD', 'package.It', 'took', 'while', 'get', 'stories', 'once', 'did', 'was', 'hooked', 'Season', '3', '8220', 'stories', '8221', 'based', 'series', 'books', 'Kate', 'Atkinson', '8220', 'story', '8221', 'divided', 'two', '59-minute', 'episodes', 'cliffhanger', 'end', 'first', 'part', '8220', 'crime', '8221', 'solved', 'two', 'parts', 'running', '8220', 'mystery', '8221', 'central', 'character', 'former', 'cop', '8211', 'now', 'private', 'detective', '8211', 'Jackson', 'Brodie', 'played', 'Jason', 'Isaacs', 'will', 'obviously', 'continue', 'Series', 'Two.I', '8217', 'let', 'read', 'other', 'reviews', 'be', 'aware', '8220', 'spoilers', '8221', 'more', 'content', 'will', 'offer', 'suggestions', 'US', 'ordering', 'series:1', 'English', 'Subtitles', '8221', 'option', 'DVD', 'added', 'Acorn', 'Media', 'recommend', 'enable', 'feature', '8211', 'least', 'one', 'are', 'quite', 'few', 'Scottish', 'words', 'will', 'confuse', 'beginning', 'Brodie', 'speaking', 'French', 'shortly', 'there', 'yelling', 'word', '8220', 'Niamh', '8221', '8217', 'find', 'out', 'not', 'really', 'spoiler', 'name', 'younger', 'sister', 'don', '8217', 'need', 'subtitles', 'just', 'turn', 'series', 'aired', 'US', 'Masterpiece', 'Mystery', 'EDITED', 'version', 'Probably', '7', 'minutes', 'so', 'addition', 'allowing', '8220', 'funding', 'messages', '8221', '8217', 'sure', 'was', 'pretty', 'graphic', 'violence', 'sex', 'three', 'stories', 'sex', 'act', '8211', 'nudity', 'as', 'well', 'language', 'S-word', '.Of', 'three', 'stories', '8211', 'two', 'crime', 'stories', 'running', 'together', '8211', 'really', 'liked', 'third', 'character', 'named', 'Reggie', 'actress', 'playing', 'her.The', 'DVD', 'one', 'Bonus', 'Feature', '8211', '8220', 'scenes', '8221', 'featurette', '15', 'minutes', 'cast', 'as', 'well', 'author', 'Atkinson', 'series', 'Producer', '8217', 'here', 'learn', 'actor', 'Issacs', 'was', 'familiar', 'Brodie', 'books', 'recorded', 'audiobook', 'versions', 'years', '8217', 'ready', 'move', 'Season', 'Two', 'will', 'post', 'review', 'there', 'when', 'finish', 'it.I', 'hope', 'found', 'review', 'informative', 'helpful.Steve', 'Ramm', '8220', 'Anything', 'Phonographic', '8221']",CASE HISTORIES
1463690,A1M0OSCFOAMAZO,B005K8QIS0,taaj,"[0, 1]","I was surprised by this fast paced drama. It drops you right in the middle of the story, takes off and keeps on moving. The action isn't wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of each episode. Some mysteries go for several episodes while others don't take long at all. In that respect it's more like real life. However, there is a bit of a McGyver tone to this. Nobody in real life could ever have this much drama, coincidence, knowledge or luck. The fun depends on that being the case though, so just suspend reality and hold on for the ride!The story lines are touching. The viewer gets to see what motivates the main character and how he got where he is today. There are family and love elements that go along with the investigations that give it a bit of depth. The cast was well chosen. They did a good job- I especially loved the darling little girl/daughter! The scenery also captivated me as it is so different from what I am used to seeing.Case Histories is a different kind of detective series that is worth a look... but do leave the subtitles on if you are watching from the USA.
