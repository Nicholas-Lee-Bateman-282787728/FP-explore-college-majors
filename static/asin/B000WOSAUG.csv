It consists of 4 diffrent 10 minute workouts (Kickboxing, Cardio Dance, Athletic Interval and Retro Aerobics) as well as a 5 minute warm-up and 5 minute cool-down.  As a high intermediate to advanced home exerciser, I find this DVD to be a lot of fun and quite effective as a workout.(I do the entire 50 minutes). True, it is not the HARDEST exercise routine out there, but it is still challenging. It packs a lot of variety, you NEVER stop moving and you will sweat and burn quite a bit of calories! I really like the music in this one, and it's great that the DVD comes with a music-only option.  Denise is not the best cuer, so initially there will be some confusion, but within a few repetitions, you will not need her to tell you what comes next. All in all, a fun and upbeat exercise routine!

She was still smiley and motivating, but she wasn't over the top.  I really like that the workout is broken down into 10 minute segments because it had enough variety to keep me interesed. She's not the most convincing kick boxer, but she pulled it off.  The dance section was MUCH better than her Cardio Dance & Sculpt DVD.  I was sweating by the end of it.  I really like that this DVD is purely cardio and doesn't have weights section.There are a couple things that other people might not like.  For the high impact moves she would give you a modification for lower impact but no one actually did it (at least that I saw, but I might be wrong on that.)The modifications were really similar to what she was doing or a previous step as she increased the intensity, so she didn't leave people completely in the dark.

However, I took the plunge because I was drawn to the different styles of cardio offered on this DVD and because a lot of reviewers said Denise really toned it down in this one.  Turns out, Denise really DID tone it down.  She's friendly, low-key, and very pleasant in this.  The different cardio sections are very fun, especially the Retro aerobics.  I don't know why I got such a kick out of this one, but it just flowed smoothly with fun moves.  The kickboxing was good, though a little fast moving if you've never done these moves before.  In the interval section, there is a lot of jumping in the last few minutes so make sure to wear a good sports bra!  I couldn't get through the dance cardio, honestly.  But that's no fault of Denise and I knew when I bought the DVD that I probably wouldn't like it.  Dancey cardio is not my thing; I'm too clumsy.  But, since the DVD is chaptered so beautifully, I don't have to do it!As far as intensity goes, don't expect an over the top sweat fest.  You get out what you put into it, of course, but I wouldn't recommend this to people who are in good shape.  You'll probably be bored.  I'm not in great shape, but not just starting out either and I got up a decent sweat.  It would be a great workout to wear weighted gloves for an extra kick.The only real negative to this DVD besides the mediocre intensity is that Denise's cueing is horrible.  She mostly tries to cue as she goes (which I don't like...I need them to cue ahead) but a lot of times she's on to the next move before saying anything.  Even her back up exercisers stumble a bit several times.  But, since the moves are simple for the most part I didn't have too much trouble my first time through the DVD.

As for the workouts themselves, each segment is a mix of high and low impact, but I work out a lot and mostly do higher impact cardio, so I found this to be more on the low-impact side (for me).  With the first two segments that I did (kick box and athletic intervals), I barely broke a sweat.  The retro aerobics segment starts out on the slow side, but for the last five minutes it's almost all high impact.I haven't gotten into Denise's DVDs in the past because I found her bubbly personality to be a bit much for me, but on this DVD, she is pretty toned down, as other reviewers have said.  She's still enthusiastic, but not annoying.  And as other reviewers have noted, her cueing is pretty bad (she tells you what she's going to do next as she already has started to do it), but the moves are not so complex that you can't get the hang of them once you do the workouts a few times.  The variety of the workouts is nice as well - if you set it up as a complete 30-40 minute workout, it doesn't really get boring because you switch between different types of workouts.",4,Cardio Blast review,1200355200,"01 15, 2008",2008,1312,"['reason', 'thought', 'DVD', 'contained', 'four', 'complete', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'was', 'disappointed', 'find', 'out', 'only', 'contained', 'four', '10', 'minute', 'segments', 'addition', 'warm-up', 'cool-down', 'are', '5', 'minutes', 'workouts', 'segment', 'mix', 'high', 'low', 'impact', 'work', 'out', 'lot', 'mostly', 'do', 'higher', 'impact', 'cardio', 'found', 'be', 'more', 'low-impact', 'side', 'first', 'two', 'segments', 'did', 'kick', 'box', 'athletic', 'intervals', 'barely', 'broke', 'sweat', 'retro', 'aerobics', 'segment', 'out', 'slow', 'side', 'last', 'five', 'minutes', 'almost', 'high', 'impact.I', 'have', ""n't"", 'gotten', 'Denise', 'DVDs', 'past', 'found', 'bubbly', 'personality', 'be', 'bit', 'much', 'DVD', 'pretty', 'toned', 'down', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'said', 'still', 'enthusiastic', 'not', 'annoying', 'other', 'reviewers', 'have', 'noted', 'cueing', 'pretty', 'bad', 'what', 'going', 'do', 'next', 'already', 'started', 'do', 'moves', 'are', 'not', 'so', 'complex', 'ca', ""n't"", 'get', 'hang', 'once', 'do', 'workouts', 'few', 'times', 'variety', 'workouts', 'nice', 'as', 'well', 'set', 'up', 'complete', '30-40', 'minute', 'workout', ""n't"", 'really', 'get', 'boring', 'switch', 'different', 'types', 'workouts']",Da: Burn Fat Fast Cardio Blast

I switch out my dvd's so I don't get bored and my body doesn't get used to the workouts.The dvd's has soem variety for the different dance styles which is nice.  I agree with another viewer that the cueing is totally off.  It took a couple times of using the dvd to know where I was going when.  The moves are easy and the pace a bit slower than I would have imagined.  You really have to put yourself into the workout to get what you need from it.  I liked Denises attitude in the dvd.  She is toned down but still perky.  I need perky sometimes, especially in the morning when I'm try to get the bootie moving.

But pure cardio dvd's seem hard to find so I gave this one a try and wasn't disappointed.  I am an advanced to intermediate exerciser and find that if I just modify some of the moves during the workout I can get my heartrate where it needs to be.  I especially enjoyed the retro section the moves reminded me of Denise's early days with some Jane Fonda and Kathy Smith thrown in.

So if you have the space and can take the high-impact, no problem.  However, if you have bad knees or live upstairs, this workout is almost certainly not for you.My other problem with this dvd was that the workouts were so diverse in nature, I just couldn't get into a rhythm with them.  It would be wonderful for someone limited on time who just wants to do a section here and there when they can squeeze it in - it would make for great variety.
