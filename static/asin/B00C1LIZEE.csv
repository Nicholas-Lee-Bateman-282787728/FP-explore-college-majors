But you will be missing a beautiful piece of naturalistic film-making. Both these girls go through a loss of innocence, an entirely realistic maturation process from girl into woman that no one is particularly happy about. Not the parents. Not even the young women. Nobody comes out, though. I'm not completely sure that the characters know who they are yet. They're in the process of becoming who they are, or who they're going to become. The filmmaker captures that brief period when sexual identity is awakening, but hasn't declared itself quite yet. It's a poignant time in a young girl's life, where every emotion is amplified, and the line between friendship and something more gets blurred. It's rare that we get to see that time from the point of view of the young women. Usually the story is told from the point of view of an adult -- either some adult in the girl's life, or the girl herself from the relative safety of a point of reference sometime in the future. Not this movie. We are in the moment with these young women. We're allowed a glimpse of what they're going through, what they feel. In that respect, this story has a tone and intensity that reminds me of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" (the book, not the movie). The ending is intentionally ambiguous. It's not your typical Hollywood happy ending. How you perceive the ending, and what you think will happen next, after the closing credits, says more about you than the characters in the film. It's rare when a movie makes you think without preaching.",4,Quietly powerful coming of age story,1372118400,"06 25, 2013",2013,1630,"['ca', ""n't"", 'bear', 'watch', 'coming', 'out', 'coming', 'age', 'story', 'might', 'not', 'want', 'watch', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'missing', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'naturalistic', 'film-making', 'girls', 'go', 'loss', 'innocence', 'entirely', 'realistic', 'maturation', 'process', 'girl', 'woman', 'one', 'particularly', 'happy', 'Not', 'parents', 'Not', 'even', 'young', 'women', 'Nobody', 'out', ""'m"", 'not', 'completely', 'sure', 'characters', 'know', 'who', 'are', 'yet', ""'re"", 'process', 'becoming', 'who', 'are', 'who', ""'re"", 'going', 'become', 'filmmaker', 'brief', 'period', 'when', 'sexual', 'identity', 'awakening', ""n't"", 'declared', 'quite', 'yet', 'poignant', 'time', 'young', 'girl', 'life', 'where', 'emotion', 'amplified', 'line', 'friendship', 'something', 'more', 'blurred', 'rare', 'get', 'see', 'time', 'point', 'view', 'young', 'women', 'Usually', 'story', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'adult', 'adult', 'girl', 'life', 'girl', 'herself', 'relative', 'safety', 'point', 'reference', 'sometime', 'future', 'Not', 'movie', 'are', 'moment', 'young', 'women', ""'re"", 'allowed', 'glimpse', 'what', ""'re"", 'going', 'what', 'feel', 'respect', 'story', 'tone', 'intensity', 'Diary', 'Anne', 'Frank', 'book', 'not', 'movie', 'ending', 'intentionally', 'ambiguous', 'not', 'typical', 'Hollywood', 'happy', 'ending', 'How', 'perceive', 'ending', 'what', 'think', 'will', 'happen', 'next', 'closing', 'credits', 'more', 'characters', 'film', 'rare', 'when', 'movie', 'think', 'preaching']",Mosquita Y Mari

Development of each character was captivating and the storylines flowed smoothly. Although the personalities of Mari and Mosquita were diverse, it was easy to identify with their individual plight. This is one of those movies that had me replaying scenes in my head (including the creative ending) long after the credits rolled.

An honest story told beautifully. The dialogue was well done, but it was almost unnecessary, so great is the director at evoking emotion through simple images.
