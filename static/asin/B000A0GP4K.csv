The pic is good in that it shows how Dylan evolves his music from a amateur Woody Guthrie imitation to polished professional, discovering in himself a talent for word play, a fixation with a certain rough edge sound and a desire to express his music only the way he likes.But it covers only the first decade and a half of his long career, which for youngsters like me - for whom his lexigraphy is already firmly entrenched in legend - omits the musically better, albeit not most influential, portion of his career. It stops in 1966.When I grew up, Dylan's folk tunes were already the wisdom of the ages: Springsteen was hailed as the new poet for my generation. Yet this was the time Dylan was producing his complete work. It was the 70s when he produced ""epigrams of surrealistic poetry and emotional intrigue"" blended with a blues band. These are the gems that shine today as the best selling Dylan albums of all time.There is not much on this pic about his family (did he have brothers? Did he involve them in his career? Did he buy Mom a Cadillac?). There is little about Joan Baez, her obviously awesome talent, or his other loves. There is little about how well the songs did on the pop charts, then or now.Ray, De-Lovely, All That Jazz and Walk the Line are all full Hollywood musical bio-pics that impact not only the joy of the music, but also the character of the artist and the flavor of the times.

917908,AGEIT17HENDIS,B000A0GP4K,Alfred Johnson,"[5, 5]","Over the past several months or so I have spent some time going over the musical influences back in the early 1960's that had an effect on  my political development as I was growing up, or that just caught my ear. Not surprisingly many of those same musical influences still resonate today. Of those early 1960's influences none probably was greater than that of Bob Dylan, no only because he had a different sound but because his super-charged protest-oriented lyrics `spoke' to me. That Dylan could only go a very short distance along that political protest route that others, including myself, had to travel does not negate the important of that influence.As this very well-done almost four hour in-depth Martin Scorsese documentary makes abundantly clear I was not alone in feeling that influence. Others also felt that Dylan `spoke' to them, if not as the voice of the ""Generation of `68"" then for a moment. I have previously reviewed a number of Bob Dylan's early albums (""The Free-Wheelin' Bob Dylan"", ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"", ""Bringing It All Back Home"", etc.) in this space as I believe that those albums reflect both the prime period of his musical influence and, when future generations begin to ask their versions of the social questions posed by the 1960's, will be the music they will be pressing to learn 100 years from now.This documentary is also formatted to reflect fully on that above-mentioned shared underlying understanding of Dylan's career and place in the folk/rock pantheon. The structure of the film also reflects the now standard method of doing a film documentary. Plenty of clips of Dylan's childhood, youth, the early days in the burgeoning folk scene in Greenwich Village in the early 1960's and plenty of clips of early performances up until that decisive period in 1965 when Dylan decided to move in another direction combining his still thoughtful but by then more personal lyrics with an electric guitar (and band to back that sound up). That changeover gets full attention by having clips of the breakthrough Royal Hall concert interspersed through the film. The film thus has its central focus on this switch-over that is a part of what made Dylan so controversial and upsetting to traditional folkies back in the day.Additionally, this film also has something that is not always the case with biographic documentaries; the subject himself holding forth on the meaning of it all. Most times that would not necessarily be a revelation as such efforts are usually unproductive. Here, however, the notoriously private and generally unresponsive (to interview questions, at least) Dylan contributes his take on what is bound to be used as a primary source for ""the first draft"" of his effect on popular music in the late 20th century. Although Dylan generally responded to the interviewers questions here I would argue that for whatever purposes he told no more than we already knew or what he wanted told. Not unusual in the famous but a little maddening here for those, like this reviewer, who happen to be serious looking at the question of ""the meaning of the 1960's. But, so be it.Fortunately another feature of theses types of documentaries helped out on that question. The film is heavily seeded with comments, performances and anecdotes by many of the performers still standing and other interested parties of the early 1960's who personally knew Dylan or had something of interest to say about the times. The list of ""talking heads"" (to the good here, I usually use this phrase with a little tongue-in cheek"") brought into this production formed a veritable who's who of those in or around that folk scene at the time.Most informative of this crowd, not surprisingly, were the late folk historian, Dave Van Ronk, and the, as of this writing, very much alive Pete Seeger who not only performed music but made it their business to know and keep the folk tradition alive. Van Ronk was especially informative about the competitiveness of the early folkies mainly the male ones, as Joan Baez was conceded on the female side to be the ""queen of the hill"", to see who would become ""king of folk"". He also had interesting comments about the commercialization of folk music and the dreaded ""selling out to mainstream culture"". By Van Ronk's account backed up by other sources I have run across as well, Dylan was intensely interested in that battle. Seeger was strongest on the transition, of which he was a seminal figure, of the folk tradition from the older 1930's Great Depression `lefties' like Woody Guthrie, Josh White, Cisco Houston and Lead Belly to the new kids on the block.Others of note along the way include the afore-mentioned Joan Baez, at one time also Dylan's girlfriend, with some very insightful comments giving us the ""skinny' of what it was like actually living with such a whirlwind and about the strains on their relationship (and her psyche) of her direction toward more political involvement, and his away from such activity. Liam Clancy (of Tommy Makem and The Clancy Brothers) and Maria Muldaur (most noted then for her key role as singer in the Jim Kweskin Jug Band) add some spice to the conversation. There are many others who have something to say about particular events but of that crowd I would select John Cohen (of ""The New Lost City Ramblers"") as most informative about the history of what was going in those times and the schism between the `purists' and those who wanted to `sell out' for filthy lucre. Again, Cohen is not a surprising choice, as ""Lost City"" spent much time on tracing the folk traditions (and it included Mike Seeger, Pete's half- brother so you know they were interested in history).Others have, endlessly, gone on about Bob Dylan's role as the voice of his generation (and mine), his lyrics and what they do or do not mean and his place in the rock or folk pantheons, or both. After viewing this documentary it still seems hard to believe now both as to the performer as well as to what was being attempted that anyone would take umbrage at a performer using an electric guitar to tell a folk story (or any story for that matter). The well-known English Royal Hall performance or that equally well-known three song folk/rock set at Newport in 1965 hardly seem worth getting steamed up about now. It is not necessary to go into all the details of what or what did not happen with Pete Seeger at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965 (although this incident gets a full airing by all parties) to know that one should be glad, glad as hell, that Bob Dylan continued to listen to his own drummer and carry on a career based on electronic music.Note: Although I do not usually spend much time looking through special features sections of DVDs here there are several extras well worth looking at. They include some early performances by Dylan both highlighted in the documentary and others that did not make the cut. Additionally, a number of the ""talking heads' that are heard in the documentary , including Liam Clancy and Maria Muldaur, do renditions of some Dylan's songs.",5,His Direction Home,1235433600,"02

No Direction Home makes one contemplate a great many things. Perhaps the most immediate is the idea that there is nothing in this world that Martin Scorsese cannot do better than his peers. We don't think of the eminent director's name being associated with documentary, but he advances this genre in the same fashion he did short film with his forty-some-minute work, Life Lessons, within New York Stories. Here he accomplishes the impossible as viewers finally are exposed to the man Bob Dylan as opposed to the idol. Unfortunately, the results are fairly jarring. I'm always worshipped Bob but my opinion of him was definitely lowered by this portrait comprised of interviews with the artist and those who knew him ""back in the day."" On the positive side, we again, just as in Don't Look Back, see firsthand evidence of his genius and how so much of what he did could not have been done by anyone else. His production during this brief moment of time was amazing. As a person though, we find him to be ruthlessly ambitious and opportunistic. Bob Zimmerman was on a mission to make it one way or another and nothing was going to stop him...and nothing did. The most disheartening element in this depiction is the lack of honor he showcased. He appears to have stolen a few hundred records from an old friend, and, even when confronted, refused to give them back. It is implied that he never, even when worth tens of millions, made good on this debt. This is unfortunate but probably reflective of the way in which young Dylan used and discarded others. Relationships seemed to be a means to end and never an end in them self. Joan Baez's observations support this as well. To please her, he merely had to invite her upon stage with him in London, but this was asking too much from a man about to become king. Yet, in the final analysis, he is a king and the person of the artist is always subsidiary to the works produced--at least in the minds of fans like this reviewer who will always love Dylan no matter what he does or says.",5,Astounding.,1157241600,"09 3, 2006",2006,2195,"['am', 'certainly', 'running', 'hot', 'terms', 'documentary', 'selection', 'time', 'find', 'one', 'superlative', 'along', 'Direction', 'Home', 'one', 'contemplate', 'great', 'many', 'things', 'Perhaps', 'most', 'immediate', 'idea', 'nothing', 'world', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'can', 'not', 'do', 'better', 'peers', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'eminent', 'director', 'name', 'being', 'associated', 'documentary', 'genre', 'same', 'fashion', 'did', 'short', 'film', 'forty-some-minute', 'work', 'Life', 'Lessons', 'New', 'York', 'Stories', 'Here', 'impossible', 'viewers', 'finally', 'are', 'exposed', 'man', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'opposed', 'idol', 'Unfortunately', 'results', 'are', 'fairly', 'jarring', ""'m"", 'always', 'worshipped', 'Bob', 'opinion', 'was', 'definitely', 'lowered', 'portrait', 'comprised', 'interviews', 'artist', 'who', 'knew', 'back', 'day', 'positive', 'side', 'again', 'just', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Back', 'see', 'firsthand', 'evidence', 'genius', 'how', 'so', 'much', 'what', 'did', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'done', 'anyone', 'else', 'production', 'brief', 'moment', 'time', 'was', 'amazing', 'person', 'find', 'be', 'ruthlessly', 'ambitious', 'opportunistic', 'Bob', 'Zimmerman', 'was', 'mission', 'make', 'one', 'way', 'nothing', 'was', 'going', 'stop', 'nothing', 'did', 'most', 'disheartening', 'element', 'depiction', 'lack', 'honor', 'showcased', 'have', 'stolen', 'few', 'hundred', 'records', 'old', 'friend', 'even', 'when', 'confronted', 'refused', 'give', 'back', 'implied', 'never', 'even', 'when', 'worth', 'tens', 'millions', 'made', 'good', 'debt', 'unfortunate', 'probably', 'reflective', 'way', 'young', 'Dylan', 'used', 'discarded', 'others', 'Relationships', 'seemed', 'be', 'means', 'end', 'never', 'end', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'observations', 'support', 'as', 'well', 'please', 'merely', 'had', 'invite', 'upon', 'stage', 'London', 'was', 'asking', 'too', 'much', 'man', 'become', 'king', 'final', 'analysis', 'king', 'person', 'artist', 'always', 'subsidiary', 'works', 'produced', 'least', 'minds', 'fans', 'reviewer', 'who', 'will', 'always', 'love', 'Dylan', 'matter', 'what']",Bob Dylan - No Direction Home

Moore,"[0, 0]","No Direction Home is one of the best music documentaries, essential for anyone even remotely interested in Bob Dylan or twentieth century music; its reach and Dylan's importance are such that it is arguably essential for anyone interested in twentieth century culture period. As informative as it is entertaining, it is masterful as a film per se as well as a documentary; fans could hardly ask for more, and the quality is such that many others will be interested.The film covers Dylan up to his 1966 motorcycle accident, focusing specifically on 1956 forward. It goes into his upbringing somewhat but focuses mainly on musical influences; we learn what made him want to be a musician and much about what made him the one he became. The details of his pre-fame life are fascinating. Post-fame years are here in greater detail, as every major event is covered along with many others. Director Martin Scorsese and company also skillfully use a variety of outside material - songs, movie clips, news footage, poems, narration, etc. - to add context and clarity. They are also very adept at using Dylan's own music. They always seem to pick just the right song at just the right point; for example, playing ""Lay Down Your Weary Tune"" over the closing credits is a brilliant touch. Their touch with photos, videos, etc. is similarly deft. More importantly, there are extensive interviews with the often tight-lipped Dylan, who opens up in unprecedented detail and range. A wide range of peers and other insiders also appear - Allen Ginsberg, Joan Baez, Al Kooper, etc. -, including former girlfriend Suze Rotolo for the first time. We thus get an excellent overview of Dylan's most famous and probably best period; the story is told with drama and verve, potentially drawing in many who do not even like Dylan. However, it is important to realize that the story essentially aims at casuals. Anyone familiar with Dylan's art and life will find few revelations, which may disappoint some.

Never before has Dylan seemed so relaxed and open.The concert footage, including legendary performances at Newport and at the famous ""Royal Albert Hall"" concert, is extraordinary, but there is much to savor here, including witty and insightful reminiscences from Dylan colleagues, including Joan Baez, Alan Ginsberg, Bobby Neuwirth, and, most memorably, the late, great Dave Van Ronk.Martin Scorsese is less a ""director"" here than a sculptor, having taken miles of rare footage and shaping them into a compelling narrative for PBS' excellent ""American Masters"" series. The footage includes performances by some of Dylan's contemporaries, as well as his influences, all of which help put his career in perspective.""No Direction Home"" only follows Dylan through 1966, the year of the motorcycle accident that provided him with a much needed respite from the madness of fame. There's a lot of ground yet to cover, including Dylan's remarkable series of 70's albums (""Blood on the Tracks"" through ""Slow Train Coming""), his controversial conversion to Christianity, the downward spiral of the 80s, and his return to form in the 90s when the Never Ending Tour was in full swing.

I've been an avid Scorcese fan for most of my life.Too bad this documentary is a flop.  Mostly it's far too long, and covers more of the era and the other bands surrounding Bob Dylan at the time than the actual man himself.  The pace of the documentary is awful, and I could hardly believe the director's name when I read it.The segements about Woodie Guthrie are interesting, and the concerts where Dylan was booed because he'd gone all ""hippie"" was a neat addition.Other than that, it gives most fans nothing that they really want to see...which is perhaps a more intimate look at the man behind the legend, not the era surrounding the legend.  And perhaps that is how Dylan and Scorcese wish to leave the legacy.A legend rather than a hardknock story.If you want to watch a truly entertaining documentary check out ""Don't Look Back"".  That one is mentioned briefly in ""No Direction..."" and though it's only shot on one of his many tours, it serves as a more entertaining experience.Also I recommend picking up ""Chronicles by Bob Dylan"".

I just finished watching it and have seen it all except for the bonus material -- which I'm really looking forward to watching... in about a week.  I definitely recommend letting time pass between watching the two parts.  This is a lot of Dylan to absorb in one sitting.  You might want to pace it out.The first half is essentially a pretty fascinating history of the folk music scene (and I'm not even a folk fan) and the ways that Dylan fit himself into the whole thing like a puzzle piece.  The second half is a look into how the avalanche that Dylan created caught up with him, and how he dealt with the chaos and the positions it forced him into.Yes, you actually get to see Dylan being asked by a newspaper photographer to, ""Suck on your glasses.""There's some great, widely bootlegged footage, lots of very nicely cleaned up stuff from ""Eat the Document"" (no Lennon in the limo, though).  I think the most surprising stuff are the early outtakes of ""Subterranean"" in different locations from the famous alley, with Dylan flubbing the timing of the cue cards.  Quite hilarious, I didn't know it existed.  There are also clips of his Warhol screen test.In the end, ""Direction"" gives a lot of information but it doesn't really give many answers.  Sara is completely ignored.  The accident; the drugs; the individual latter albums are all blurred together.

Throughout Dylan's 45 year public career he has defied easy definition.  Imagine if Scorsese decided to tackle the total of Dylan's career and not just up to 1966.  By using archival materials and interviews with Dylan's contemporaries and associates Scorsese tries to give us an idea as to who Dylan is but that even proves elusive.  The interview subjects even seem befuddled by Bob.  Even interviews with Dylan himself prove to be evasive and cryptic. Scorsese, a noted music buff, painstakingly catalogs potential influences on Dylan from the folk, blues, rock, and country-western scene.  That approach even hits a brick wall because alot of the artists in these genres consider Dylan to be traitorous.  Anybody going into this film looking for the definitive portayal of Dylan will be sadly disappointed.  Anybody who has followed his career to any degree know that's an unattainable task.  I've seen Dylan four times in my life since 1981 and at no one concert were my expectations met, the least satisfying being the 1986 tour with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers as his backing band.  Would I go back?  In a heartbeat.  Dylan may not meet my preconceived expectations but at least he's an artist who does things on his terms.

917928,A36CHPMHHD1IO5,B000A0GP4K,dvdtrkr,"[0, 0]","The only complaint I have is that because it is a documentary, I would've loved to have seen more complete performances. The Newport footage was taken from Murray Lerner's ""Festival"" movie (shot at 4 Newport Folk fests, including the infamous ""Dylan goes electric"" set), which should get the Criterion treatment and put all the performances from the shows he filmed out to the public, because a lot of the artists that performed the shows are no longer with us as well as artists who have very little film footage available. The footage included here looks stunning.Also, ""Eat the Document"" has yet to be released, the footage shown on the documentary also looks great (although Dylan chopped the master reel up supposedly), with the pre-Band Hawks backing Dylan, but ""Like A Rolling Stone"" does remain intact for the extras.Keep in mind this isn't a definitive biography of Bob Dylan, but mostly surrounding the years when he was hailed as a voice of a generation and booed as a rock star sellout, with the footage from '66 being intersperced throughout the film, building up to Newport '65. What's amazing to me is how young he was when all of this was going on, and that when he hit big he was only 20.Scorsese (who had directed ""The Last Waltz"" and has made many documentaries as well as classic films) had said that growing up in NY, he only became familiar with Dylan when he did ""go electric"", so everything he did earlier he wasn't that familiar with.Seeing Dylan going from this goofy cherub to cantankerous pain in a short amount of time captures him in a way ""Don't Look Back"" only covers the latter, and the inane questions interviewers ask him only make it worse. Baez mentions Dylan's mood swings on stage during his ""folk"" phase, and Seeger's threats to cut the electric cord at Newport are elaborated on.Where ""Don't Look Back"" captures Dylan as being difficult and mean (""Eat the Document"" footage shows him in an even worse light),and Albert Grossman is mentioned as being one of the reasons for Dylan's change, ""No Direction Home"" kind of shows how he got to that point.It was great to see interviews with Allen Ginsburg and Dave Van Ronk (who are no longer with us), as well as Pete Seeger, Maria Muldaur, Joan Baez and Suze Rotolo. I would've thought Robbie Robertson would've taken part in it (as he did in ""Last Waltz"" with Scorsese), but the Hawks' drummer (who had put out his own backstage footage on DVD) instead talks about it.But again, the best part of the film are the performances, a lot of which has rarely been seen outside of bootlegs, and some for the first time. 40-something years later, whether he had center stage as a folk artist or the leader of a rock band, he was a mesmerizing performer, unfortunately over the years he would rarely put on shows with the same level of energy and enthusiasm (except on the Band's 74 tour with Dylan and his resurgence in the 90s-00s to college crowds. Don't write him off yet!). The ""Bootleg Series"" 1964 and 1966 are excellent CDs of his concerts that are captured in the documentary, the CD sountrack to this film is also worth picking up. All his CD from his debut to ""Blonde on Blonde"" should already be in your collection as well as the scrapbook and ""Chronicles"".Even though this is a great film for future generations getting into Dylan can get into, keep in mind there's some strong language throughout the film. But as far as history goes, you see Dylan performing in DC and was there for the ""I have a dream"" speech Martin Luther King gave, the folk scene and the variety of artists that had used Dylan's songs (it's funny to see Bob with a young Sonny and Cher).Overall, it's a great documentary that Dylan himself narrates (through interviews past and present) and as far as Scorsese goes, tells the story without trying to be too matter of fact or digging up intimate details (which I'm sure the Dylanologists will again be frustrated by). It's kind of long to watch it in one sitting, but 4 hours is needed to be able to fit it (unfortunately the performance footage is cut for the interviews).",5,Essential documentary.,1127865600,"09 28, 2005",2005,4086,"['only', 'complaint', 'have', 'documentary', 'would', ""'ve"", 'loved', 'have', 'seen', 'more', 'complete', 'performances', 'Newport', 'footage', 'was', 'taken', 'Murray', 'Lerner', 'Festival', 'movie', 'shot', '4', 'Newport', 'Folk', 'fests', 'including', 'infamous', 'Dylan', 'electric', 'set', 'should', 'get', 'Criterion', 'treatment', 'put', 'performances', 'shows', 'filmed', 'out', 'public', 'lot', 'artists', 'performed', 'shows', 'are', 'no', 'longer', 'as', 'well', 'artists', 'who', 'have', 'very', 'little', 'film', 'footage', 'available', 'footage', 'included', 'here', 'stunning.Also', 'Eat', 'Document', 'yet', 'be', 'released', 'footage', 'shown', 'documentary', 'also', 'great', 'Dylan', 'chopped', 'master', 'reel', 'up', 'supposedly', 'pre-Band', 'Hawks', 'backing', 'Dylan', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'remain', 'intact', 'extras.Keep', 'mind', ""n't"", 'definitive', 'biography', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'mostly', 'surrounding', 'years', 'when', 'was', 'hailed', 'voice', 'generation', 'booed', 'rock', 'star', 'sellout', 'footage', ""'66"", 'being', 'intersperced', 'film', 'building', 'up', 'Newport', ""'65"", 'What', 'amazing', 'how', 'young', 'was', 'when', 'was', 'going', 'when', 'hit', 'big', 'was', 'only', '20.Scorsese', 'who', 'had', 'directed', 'Last', 'Waltz', 'made', 'many', 'documentaries', 'as', 'well', 'classic', 'films', 'had', 'said', 'growing', 'up', 'NY', 'only', 'became', 'familiar', 'Dylan', 'when', 'did', 'go', 'electric', 'so', 'everything', 'did', 'earlier', 'was', ""n't"", 'familiar', 'with.Seeing', 'Dylan', 'going', 'goofy', 'cherub', 'cantankerous', 'pain', 'short', 'amount', 'time', 'captures', 'way', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Back', 'only', 'latter', 'inane', 'questions', 'interviewers', 'ask', 'only', 'make', 'worse', 'Baez', 'mentions', 'Dylan', 'mood', 'swings', 'stage', 'folk', 'phase', 'Seeger', 'threats', 'cut', 'electric', 'cord', 'Newport', 'are', 'elaborated', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Look', 'Back', 'Dylan', 'being', 'difficult', 'mean', 'Eat', 'Document', 'footage', 'even', 'worse', 'light', 'Albert', 'Grossman', 'mentioned', 'being', 'one', 'reasons', 'Dylan', 'change', 'Direction', 'Home', 'kind', 'shows', 'how', 'got', 'point.It', 'was', 'great', 'see', 'interviews', 'Allen', 'Ginsburg', 'Dave', 'Van', 'Ronk', 'who', 'are', 'longer', 'as', 'well', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'Maria', 'Muldaur', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'Suze', 'Rotolo', 'would', ""'ve"", 'thought', 'Robbie', 'Robertson', 'would', ""'ve"", 'taken', 'part', 'did', 'Last', 'Waltz', 'Scorsese', 'Hawks', 'drummer', 'who', 'had', 'put', 'out', 'own', 'backstage', 'footage', 'DVD', 'instead', 'talks', 'it.But', 'again', 'best', 'part', 'film', 'are', 'performances', 'lot', 'rarely', 'been', 'seen', 'bootlegs', 'first', 'time', '40-something', 'years', 'later', 'had', 'center', 'stage', 'folk', 'artist', 'leader', 'rock', 'band', 'was', 'mesmerizing', 'performer', 'unfortunately', 'years', 'would', 'rarely', 'put', 'shows', 'same', 'level', 'energy', 'enthusiasm', 'Band', '74', 'tour', 'Dylan', 'resurgence', '90s-00s', 'college', 'crowds', 'Do', ""n't"", 'write', 'off', 'yet', 'Bootleg', 'Series', '1964', '1966', 'are', 'excellent', 'CDs', 'concerts', 'are', 'captured', 'documentary', 'CD', 'sountrack', 'film', 'also', 'worth', 'picking', 'up', 'CD', 'debut', 'Blonde', 'Blonde', 'should', 'already', 'be', 'collection', 'as', 'well', 'scrapbook', 'Chronicles', '.Even', 'great', 'film', 'future', 'generations', 'getting', 'Dylan', 'can', 'get', 'keep', 'mind', 'strong', 'language', 'film', 'as', 'far', 'history', 'see', 'Dylan', 'performing', 'DC', 'was', 'there', 'have', 'dream', 'speech', 'Martin', 'Luther', 'King', 'gave', 'folk', 'scene', 'variety', 'artists', 'had', 'used', 'Dylan', 'songs', 'funny', 'see', 'Bob', 'young', 'Sonny', 'Cher', '.Overall', 'great', 'documentary', 'narrates', 'interviews', 'past', 'present', 'as', 'far', 'Scorsese', 'story', 'trying', 'be', 'too', 'matter', 'fact', 'digging', 'up', 'intimate', 'details', ""'m"", 'sure', 'Dylanologists', 'will', 'again', 'be', 'frustrated', 'kind', 'long', 'watch', 'one', 'sitting', '4', 'hours', 'needed', 'be', 'able', 'fit', 'unfortunately', 'performance', 'footage', 'cut', 'interviews']",Bob Dylan - No Direction Home

That's the No. 1 reason to own the DVD version of Martin Scorsese's ""No Direction Home.""  Coming from a project so awash in audio and video treasures, it seems odd that the only meaningful extras are complete versions of Dylan numbers trimmed in the documentary. That said, there are some great performances in the extras -- for example, the 8-minute version of ""Like a Rolling Stone"" with the band that became the Band.The DVD's Dolby Digital 5.1 audio achieves reference quality. Images are TV-friendly full screen, with pleasing grays and medium contrasts. The video texture is amazingly consistent given the Babylon of sources.The film's subtitle should be something like ""Bob Dylan, 1960-65."" Dylan acts as his own witness throughout -- at ease, clear, sometimes funny and seemingly pleased to take control of his legend. ""I don't feel like I had a past,"" Dylan says, but the assembled evidence proves otherwise. Part 1 unspools much like a video companion to Dylan's vastly entertaining biography ""Chronicles, Volume One,"" which covers his years on the Greenwich Village folk scene, the epicenter of American hip in the early 1960s.""No Direction Home"" becomes A Film By Martin Scorsese in its dark concluding act. Like ""Mean Streets"" and ""GoodFellas,"" it captures the paranoia and disintegration as the central character's life implodes. The artist faced a far-flung confederacy of dunces, Scorsese shows us, over and over: moronic reporters, abusive audiences, uncomprehending music lovers, petulant folkies, teenagers who shrieked, fawned and grabbed. No one seems to have any sense except for Dylan and his in-crowd.Dylan's songs play non-stop in that gorgeous DD audio, but there is little discussion, surprisingly, of the groundbreaking music he produced in the mid-'60s -- no recognition of the vast Baby Boom audience that heard the genius in his explorations and embraced them. No one testifies to the deep and immediate influence of  ""Highway 61 Revisited"" on rock innovators up to and including John Lennon.Still, it's easy and satisfying to buy into Scorsese's view of Dylan as underdog. The slant and subjectivity give ""No Direction Home"" much of its drama and depth, especially in the final hour.

917931,A3M5O6UHXO9IBU,B000A0GP4K,Gary,"[1, 13]","I knew next to nothing about Dylan. But why is it that once again a talented artist revered by many has to turn out to be an awful human being? In fact, a comman thief. Stealing someone's record collection is the seventh deadly sin around these parts as far back as I can remember. Someone out there (you know who you are) still has my white vinyl copy of Bela Lugosi's Dead. But to steal someone's song without their permission to further your own career and wallet is a blindfold, cigarette and firing squad offence. It's still a fairly comman thing to happen to this day. The guy he pinched from was wryly avuncular about it in retrospect but I bet at heart it rankled. But what goes around, comes around and very appropriately the offender is called a Judas at the end of the documentary. Actually, the electric stuff sounded alright to me, although the playing of the last song was obviously despondently delivered. If I turned up to see something gentler and had my eardrums assaulted by discordant psychedelia maybe I would have been miffed too. But it sounded okay.Dylan was different than I expected him to be. With those eyes and that drawl, he rather reminded me of Clint Eastwood. I felt the film was too hard on journalists. It's not easy to ask questions about music and some people at least tried to ask something thoughtful, even if it didn't come across that way. Unless it was a contractual obligation, Dylan was big enough by then not to have to do press conferences.One thing Dylan did get right was in not inviting Joan Baez back on stage with him down the line. It was obvious by the cringe making footage that their two vocal styles were too at odds with each other to come together successfully. But some obsessive out there will probably do a five hour documentary proving just how wrong I am on that point. Wasn't that little girl who sung in the beatnik cafe great, though? Something Maulder. Looked a bit like Cher.Was Like a Rolling Stone the most important song of all time?

917932,AAEP8YFERQ8FC,B000A0GP4K,General Breadbasket,"[12, 12]","Bob Dylan has always seemed the kind of musician I should have been into (intelligent lyrics, etc), yet for some reason I never have been able to find a way to get into his music. This is probably going to sound silly to Dylan fans, but I was put off by everything from not knowing which album to buy first, struggling to understand what Bob was saying. It just all seemed a very different world to mine. Well, after this DVD ""No Direction Home"", compiled by Martin Scorsese, I'm rather turned around on the subject. I've gotten some context, I GET it now!By way of original concert footage, TV spots and present day interviews from many people including Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg and even Bob Dylan himself, we see over two discs the rise of Dylan's career, disc one covering his early life and influences up to about 1963, the second disc covering 1963 to just after Dylan's infamous motorcycle crash in 1966. It's done pretty straightforward, though there is the occaisonal arty directional flourish put in by Martin Scorsese (silence after the motorcycle crash, beginning the documentary in silence, as if there was no music before Dylan, etc). It's not strictly chronological, the documentary will often cut to 1966, where people will be booing Dylan for having a band and going electric. Though I usually like my stories and documentaries pretty chronological, I thought the flashing back and forth added to ""No Direction Home"". It reminded you what was going to happen, compared the folk versions of Dylan songs to some of the electric renditions, provided some contrast, showed what the shock must have been to the audience back then.I'd always heard about this infamous change, and had never really understood what the big deal is. After seeing this documentary, I understand why it was such a big deal to some fans, who saw Dylan as a folk purist, as a national conscience, etc. I also see why it wasn't such a big deal to Dylan. He had always been into rock'n'roll, even when he was growing up. He'd had an electric guitar back then, even.I know a lot of things now that I've seen this documentary. I know that Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash not only met, but sung a song together. I know why, in the 1960s, so many bands did covers of Dylan's songs. I now know more about Allen Ginsberg and his scene. It's great to have a documentary where you come away with a heap more than what you expected. Then again, it is a rather lengthy documentary.Special features include a selection of performances used in the film that can be watched seperately, plus a few performances that are not. They date from 1963 to 1966. As a casual listener, I was pleased to find some footage of ""Positively 4th Street"" being performed, as it's a song I quite like.I'd recommend this DVD to anyone interested at all in Bob Dylan.

The crowd was evenly divided between the boos and the yays; in fact, I'd give the positive response among the audience at at least 60%.  The people who wanted him to be their projection of what they wanted were disappointed to find out Dylan was no Guthrie or Seeger.  He was not carrying on a tradition.  He was an artist, evolving.  Those who cheered seemed to be wowed by a new evolution in his musical development, and they have proven to have won out. Unfortunately the only footage of the concert in the doc. is B&W and makes it seem like night; it was actually about 6 pm and still daylight. Now about this film, it seems to me as good a documentary as is possible about its subject.  The Dylan interview is direct and seems candid. The interviews with those who met Dylan early in his career were straightforward and relaxed (except for the always obnoxious public persona that Joan Baez displays).  The two best quotes in the film were 1) a recording producer who said, ""God just kicked Bobby in the Ass"" and Allen Ginsburg, who said, Dylan appeared as a shaman his music being conveyed through him.  Regardless, the documentary shows that some things just can't be explained (like Dylan's music) as Susan Sontag suggested many years ago and does not attempt to 'explain' the artist--just show him.  And thank goodness, there was little mention of his private life or banal comments about where he gets his inspiration--a welcome relief from such exercises in banality that appear on Bravo's ""Inside The Actor's Studio"" interviews.  I think that if a half-hour had been trimmed beginning with the third hour, it would have been much better since it began to be repetitive.

The biggest plus here is that not only did he cooperate, but Dylan turns out to be disarmingly straightforward during his interview, the binding glue for the program. Perhaps this was because production was so close to the release of his own memoirs, CHRONICLES VOLUME 1, that Dylan felt an imperative to set the record straight for everyone who, in the past, could have been forgiven for not being sure if he was ever forthcoming when not performing. In any case, Dylan comes off in NO DIRECTION HOME as very assured of how he remembered his early years up to the end of 1966, and the corraborations of his recollections by such fellow travelers as Joan Baez, Dave Van Ronk, Izzy Young, Pete Seeger and others definetely gives the right feeling of authenticity. Scorsese fleshes out his program with deft uses of archival concert and news footage, including several moments from Dylan's last concert tour of England with The Hawks (later The Band) prior to the motorcycle crash that sidelined him for the bulk of 1967. THAT footage is extraordinary, if only because you see how raw and unfettered his band sound really was, but the moments taken from various outdoor festivals, TV shows and indoor concerts from 1961 to 1966 are just as incredible.Throughout it all, one central theme emerges; Bob Dylan knew from the get-go how to tap into most of the aspects that make the difference between a good performer and a great one.

Dix, training basics. I used to go into the Village, but I wasn't aware of him then. But I bought Freewheelin' in the PX on Okinawa in 1963, and took that and the first three Joan Baez albums to Vietnam with me at the end of '63. That was in the days when Special Forces thought of itself as a kind of armed Peace Corps. I was turned on to Baez and Dylan by young Green Berets who identified with their music totally. Nobody knows that anymore. What they know is a media image that does not even remotely match the reality of what we did. We loved the people we fought with.

Right, not one album. I was raised wearing white blouses, kilt skirts, knee socks, circle pins and cheerleading my way to nowhere while steeped in classical music including madrigals, choir, and orchestra. But I purchased - No Direction Home - almost on a whim, or maybe it was a prayer, in a most serious effort to understand how I ended up in-the-age-they-call middle. To my utter astonishment, however, I found myself soaring-singing again above all the muck-n-mire within this sublime documentary of language (music itself) as part of Dylan's life, loves, hopes, dreams, genius, despair, and joy while distilling the very essence of that oh-so-mysterious light within ALL of us: but so gloriously embodied in one...named Bob Dylan (a man - a real man - representing all our colors). If this documentary-CD set had been 10 times the price, it would be worth still more. I assure you, whether you are new to Bob Dylan (as I idiotically am); or one who has been there all along, I would beg you (and I don't beg) to buy this sublime work of art.

Gittins,"[4, 19]","It might seem unusual to complain about the singing on a music/musician documentary, but that is only one of several problems I have with this DVD. I like most Bob Dylan songs, but his singing, at least on the versions used here, was fairly grating and irritating. He seemed to mumble through many songs, or wail like a cat in heat on others. Arg!The ""special feature"" section of itemized performances is just the full-length version of the clips used in the main documentary. That might be a nice thing if they weren't the irritating ones.Another section of the special features was ""guest performances"". Sheesh, these were mostly just spontaneous and casual a capella renditions by a few singers, one of which had already consumed a least one large brew at the bar. Only Joan Baez's guitar-accompanied version of Bob's song ""Love Is Just A Four-Letter Word"" was noteworthy.Another advertised bit is Bob ""working on a song in his hotel room"". This consisted of Bob slowly plonking a few keys on the typewriter as Joan Baez sings on the couch behind him.There is a lot of background on the folk music scene, which was nice, and contemporary comments by notables such as Alan Ginsberg and Pete Seeger.The best part was when Bob, aged 60-plus, was just talking to the off-screen interviewer.It did inspire me to buy Bob's greatest hits 1 & 2 to go along with ""Blood on the Tracks"" I already have - one of the finest albums ever.

(Yeah, I know, all the Dylan fanatics are having a fit by now.)The sections I liked most in this doc are the sections (interspersed throughout) where Dylan, the way he looks today, sits there and simply talks about how he felt about events that took place during the 60s--and touches on some other things: the town he grew up in, hearing J. Cash sing for the first time, etc. This guy Dylan, to me, comes across as a genuinely decent, intelligent human being--and I truly dug that.Am also  thrilled that he had the smarts to stay clear of all those missguided commie types (who shall go nameless here).What I have to say  to all those pro-commie goofballs is just this: try living in a communist country before you go around praising communism to us. How's that? Can you grasp that concept, folks?Lastly: wished they could have gone past the year 1966 here a bit, to see and hear Dylan sing some of his other tunes.Keep making music, Mr. Dylan. Stay true to yourself. I know: ain't always easy, but you've managed it so far.Suggestion to all the journalists: can we please stop reffering to this guy as ""the reclusive singer/songwriter?"" How can he be reclusive--when he's on every CD he's ever cut, ever book he's ever written--not to mention all the documentaries he's been in?

917949,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B000A0GP4K,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[8, 12]","I was out on the deck cooking a steak and listening to Bob Dylan playing down in Bayfront Park when between songs he pointed out to the crowd that he had been born here in the Zenith City in a hospital on the side of the hill.  This was the second time that Dylan had played Duluth, and the fact that he acknowledged this is the city of his birth was seen as icing on the cake because most of us were surprised he would ever come back here to play.  That is because the man born Robert Zimmerman has been running from northern Minnesota pretty much since the day he graduated from Hibbing High School.The title of ""No Direction Home: Bob Dylan"" emphasizes that the singer-songwriter was a construct and attempts to chronicle the transformation from Robert Zimmerman to Bob Dylan.  The key influence has always been considered to be Woody Guthrie, and Dylan's visit to Guthrie in the hospital is an iconic Sixties vision quest, but this documentary is able to work in many more names into the mix.  The connections to the music at any time during the early stages of Dylan's career are only addressed tangentially, but that only underscores that this is not a music appreciation course on Bob Dylan, as much as that would be nice.  This is an attempt to preserve the extant record on the first quarter century of Dylan's life, with an emphasize on the five years at the end of that period that represent the most creative and significant portion of his career, aided and abetted by talking heads the likes of Joan Baez, Allen Ginsberg, Liam Clancy, and Al Kooper, who provide memories and retrospective insights (Kooper's story on how he ended up playing the organ on ""Like a Rolling Stone"" is a testament to serendipity in the music business).Since Martin Scorsese was basically given 10 hours of film footage to shape into a four-hour documentary, the sense in which he served as ""director"" of ""No Direction Home"" would be in laying out the basic structure for film editor David Tedeschi.  Obviously the main thrust of the documentary is the chronology of Dylan's life, which mixes archival footage with contemporary interviews.  But this narrative plays out against Dylan's 1966 tour of Great Britain, already the focus of D.A. Pennebaker's documentary ""Don't Look Back,"" during which he offended a large segment of his fans by picking up an electric guitar.  Night after night Dylan would play an acoustic set to raves from his audience, and then return with a backing band for an electric set.  Time and time again you hear audience members scream ""Judas"" and other insults, while Dylan tells the bad to just play louder.  The main narrative and the subtext come together when Dylan shows up at the Newport Folk Festival supported by the Paul Butterfield Blues Band and shocks the world.  The U.K. tour kept the wound open and it was the motorcycle accident in the summer of 1966 that turned Dylan into a recluse that adds the exclamation point on theOne of the things that resulted from that decision was the song that ""Rolling Stone"" magazine picked as the top rock song of all-time, ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" which also happened to be the first single Dylan ever released (it went to #2 on the Billboard charts).  This was taken as clear evidence that Dylan was going ""commercial,"" yet even the fans who booed and shouted curses when Dylan came on stage with the Band (nee the Hawks), applauded that one song.  The problem was not that Dylan was becoming commercial (""Eve of Destruction"" was a #1 song and that did not hurt Barry McGuire's bona fides as a folk rebel), but that for the most part he appeared to be giving up being the voice of his generation.  In that regard the biggest slap in the face to those who worshipped him was not ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" with its powerful onslaught of pointed lyrics, but ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" which we see him performing at a folk song workshop, because that is not a song that is going to send young people to the streets let alone to the barricades.The interviews done with Dylan are actually the least important part of ""No Direction Home,"" because if there is anything we have learned from listening to Dylan over the past four decades it is to let the music speak for itself.  In all of the footage from the first half of the Sixties showing Dylan talking with reporters he repeatedly dodges their questions.  They want to know what the songs are about and he refuses to tell them.  It might seem like he is waiting for somebody smart enough to pose a question worth answering, but I have to believe he would never play that game.  This is a man who insisted he grew up in Gallup, New Mexico rather than admit to being from Hibbing, and his willingness to sit in front of a film camera and talk about his past does not automatically mean increased veracity.  I would like to believe that when Dylan talks about the musicians he listened to growing up that he is telling the truth, but I always wary.What is potentially the most illuminating thing that Dylan says about himself in this four-hour documentary is his insistence that he was never a topical songwriter.  If you can wrap your mind about the truth in that obvious lie, which is possible if you keep in mind Dylan's contemporaries on the folk scene in the early Sixties and remember that sometimes words have two meanings, then you can arrive at a better understanding of the truth inherent in Dylan's music.  ""No Direction Home"" does not fully illuminate Bob Dylan, but that impossibility is hardly Scorsese's agenda.  Ultimately, Scorsese is making the case for why Dylan should end up getting a Noble Prize for Literature some day soon.  The only better way to make the case is to simply listen to the man's music.",5,"Documenting Bob Dylan's glory years, 1941-1966",1127520000,"09 24, 2005",2005,5730,"['was', 'out', 'deck', 'cooking',

It follows him from his early days until the time right before his motorcycle accident in 1966, jumping between footage of interviews with the artist, friends, colleagues and people that knew him along the way, and live performances from his 1963-1966 period.Granted that the special features in the DVD set are not particularly special, the 207 minutes the 2-part documentary lasts feel like a short time, when you realize the transcendence of Dylan's work and how he broke new musical ground along the way. ""No Direction Home"" (a title taken from the lyrics to his classic ""Like a Rolling Stone"") will entertain and inform newcomers into his music and die-hard Bob Dylan fans alike, as it sheds new light on a fascinating era in our contemporary history.",5,For the newcomer into Dylan as well as the longtime fanatics,1134950400,"12 19, 2005",2005,1233,"['consider', 'be', 'somewhere', 'newcomers', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'work', 'longtime', 'fans', 'first', 'started', 'paying', 'close', 'attention', 'legacy', 'work', 'turn', 'century', 'step', 'way', 'feel', 'more', 'more', 'respect', 'what', 'accomplished', 'willingness', 'take', 'risks', 'navigate', 'current', 'many', 'times.The', 'documentary', 'Direction', 'Home', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'only', 'further', 'what', 'fantastic', 'artist', 'Dylan', 'early', 'days', 'time', 'right', 'motorcycle', 'accident', '1966', 'jumping', 'footage', 'interviews', 'artist', 'friends', 'colleagues', 'people', 'knew', 'way', 'live', 'performances', '1963-1966', 'period.Granted', 'special', 'features', 'DVD', 'set', 'are', 'not', 'particularly', 'special', '207', 'minutes', '2-part', 'documentary', 'lasts', 'feel', 'short', 'time', 'when', 'realize', 'transcendence', 'Dylan', 'work', 'how', 'broke', 'new', 'musical', 'ground', 'way', 'Direction', 'Home', 'title', 'taken', 'lyrics', 'classic', 'Rolling', 'Stone', 'will', 'entertain', 'inform', 'newcomers', 'music', 'die-hard', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'fans', 'alike', 'new', 'light', 'fascinating', 'era', 'contemporary', 'history']",Bob Dylan - No Direction Home

Because it tells us a lot about Bob Dylan, or at least as much as Dylan himself is prepared to say for now.""Part One"" of ""No direction home"" goes from the late 1950's to 1963, and deals with the place where Dylan grew, and the kind of music he liked. I found this specially interesting, as I hadn't heard of Woody Guthrie, Tommy Makem, and others that had an enormous influence on Dylan. I enjoyed watching and hearing him as he developed as an artist, and changed accordingly.""Part two"" covers the period that goes from 1963 to 1966. It is very good, and has great footage of Dylan's concerts, like ""Part one"". The main difference between the two dvds probably is that the second one lacks the kind of explanation regarding the historical context that the first one has. All the same, it is enjoyable, and only obviously in fault when compared to ""Part one"".This documentary includes lots of footage of the young Dylan and comments made by the ""old"" Dylan, the person that young and gifted man grew up to be. Not only that, but there are also quite a few interviews of people who knew him at one moment or the other, and that help to shed some light on him. The interviews that involve Joan Baez are probably the most insightful regarding Bob Dylan's character, and his refusal to be trapped in a role as symbol of the left.I think that if there is a constant in Dylan's career, it is probably the fact that he refuses to be pinned down, to be anything other than himself, and that is nothing less and nothing more than what he feels like being at the moment. ""No direction home"" shows that, and I think we should congratulate Martin Scorsese for that.

917954,A103YPVK70AGXR,B000A0GP4K,Michael J. Raymond,"[7, 7]","The problem with viewing a documentary about Dylan is that there is a wealth of material that has been released over the years and they fear is that there will be nothing new.  That was the main complaint about the A&E ""Biography"" released a couple of years ago.  It was superficial and not worth the effort.  Sort of like a thumbnail sketch of a great artist.  ""No Direction Home"" by Martin Scorcese is a landmark event in portraying the most important artist of our time.  Not only does the film confine itself to a specific 5-6 year period (1961-1966) in Dylan's life, the great one actually participates in the production.  The key question that Scorcese seems to ask over and over is:  how did Dylan go from Woody Guthrie to completely transforming American music in 5 short years.  Most artists struggle their whole lives within a certain genre and are never able to break through to the essence of the form in which they toil.  Dylan is the Shakespeare of our time, and this film makes it abundantly clear that the artistic process was filled with traps, lies, backstabbing, etc.  Scorcese incorporates never before seen and heard recordings, film, interviews, rememberances, and comments by the master himself.  My first viewing of this film yeilded some interesting results.  Dylan is a very funny guy.  He can tell a joke with just his eyes and to watch him spar with reporters and other ""Mr. Jones'"" is tremendously entertaining.  No wonder this guy didn't care much for the press.  Dylan also offers a few gems during his interview.  My favorite is ""You can't be wise and in love at the same time"".  Upon a second viewing, you definately get the sense that Dylan put up with a whole lot more than most people would have just to practice his art.  Dylan looked weary on the 1966 tour, burned out, despartely tyring to maintain his sanity, while he is ""just trying to get home"".  The added material on the DVD don't really add a whole lot to the presentation but some of the extra's are fun.  The film is genius.  It certainly validates Dylan when he decided to only work with the best throughout the years.  Scorcese really catures the times, the artist, the madness, and the crash.

Man, Dylan was great singing that song for ""Wonder Boys."" and to think ""Tangled Up In Blue"" is only considered an average song.  Dylan has lasted because he is vital and important.  I hope he keeps charging forward with his music, because I think he will have interesting things to say as he ages.As Steve Allen said during Dylan's appearence on that show in 1964, ""genius knows no rules.""  How true it is.  Like most geniuses, Dylan arrives from Hibbing, Minnesota as Robert Zimmerman, like some kind of space alien. He is just a special being not tethered to the reality of place. He could have been from Timbuktu somehow.  It sure didn't seem to matter - or did it.  Perhaps being from the bland post-war Midwest is what gave him the ingredients to work with.Dylan is an artist.  The reviewer who below said that Dylan was not a poet is politely a nincompoop.  Dylan is a great poet, whose songs transcend his accompanying music and his awful voice.  But who cares about his voice.In reality, all you hear is the VOICE of a great artist. I was not around during the sixties.  I picked up a Dylan album after listening to ""Dont talk twice it's alright"" after breaking up with a girl.  That song spoke to me, and other songs spoke to me with their simplicity and ther beauty.In terms of this documentary, the tremendous archival footage is culled together in an utterly interesting and vital way.  You can see Dylan literally discover his genius as an artist.  This documentary captures interviews of the figures in Dylan's life, including the Beat generation poet Allen Ginsburg, Joan Baez, and others.  (Interesting to note is that Dylan says that Kerouac's ""On the Road"" didn't have much of an effect on him.)This is a film worth seeing because it gives you the life of the artist.  A rare and worthwhile glimpse into greatness.  Imagine if we had the same footage for Michaelangelo or Leonardo DiCaprio (I am kidding :))  I mean of course, Leonardo Da Vinci.

917959,A1URVCR4OMLG0O,B000A0GP4K,N. Chevalier,"[7, 7]","Martin Scorsese's lengthy study of Bob Dylan's early years is about as thorough a look at the early 1960's folk music scene as you're likely to get.  Along with Bob, there are interviews with Dave van Ronk, John Cohen, Izzy Young, Tony Glover, Suze Rotolo, Liam Clancy, Joan Baez, even Pete Seeger and Allen Ginsburg--in short, anyone who could be found who was around in those early years.  There is, amazingly, a candid and almost relaxed Dylan himself, offering early memories and reflections on his entry into the music business, some of which is straight out of ""Chronicles,"" but much that is new.  In terms of facts, there is probably nothing here that the committed Dylanologist won't already know--if you've read ""Chronicles"" and Robert Shelton's ""No Direction Home,"" and if you've bought all the ""Bootleg Series"" releases (including the excellent Volume 7 that serves as the official soundtrack to this film), then you're already pretty familiar with what's on this disc.That being said, there is a cornucopia of visual delight awaiting both hardcore Dylan fan and curious newcomer alike.  The film is rich in images, not just of Dylan, but of the early 60s New York folk scene, including old TV performances and concert clips.  Much of this has never been seen before, and it's an exhilirating treat for the eye as well as the ear.  And it's not just wall-to-wall Dylan: the film does a good job of setting Bob in the context of the folk music boom of the early 60s, in order to highlight just how different, how extraordinary he really was.  In fact, the main theme of the film is how Dylan kept re-creating himself artistically, much to the bewilderment--and sometimes anger--of his fans and colleagues.  The linear narrative of Dylan's rise in first the folk and then the rock world is intercut with scenes from the legendary 1966 tour of the British Isles--footage shot, I assume, by DA Pennebaker for ""Eat the Document.""  Here, the booing and the catcalls are prominent--even more than they are on the Manchester concert recording issued as ""Live 1966""--and we get close-ups of Dylan's bleary, drug-bolstered-and-sleep-deprived eyes as he forces the audience to listen to grungy, elemental performances of his songs with The Band.  Thus, the darling of the folk boom becomes the ""Judas"" who sells out to commercialism.  It all seems rather ridiculous now, but it's fascinating to watch people so upset by Dylan's change of sound.I'm not sure if, at the end of it all, I understand Dylan the man any better.  For example, the film says nothing about Dylan's relationships with Suze Rotolo, Joan Baez, or Sara Lowndes--so anyone looking for juicy insider gossip won't find it here.  Similarly, a lot of Dylan's childhood is passed over, except for his discovery of Hank Williams and black R & B artists.  Dylan himself is typically offhanded about his work, so we don't get any particular insights into ""Blowin' in the Wind"" or any other song associated with him.  But that's not really the point.  What the film forces us to see--and what really matters in the end anyhow--is Dylan the extraordinary artist, the writer and performer who, as many in the film suggest, had the uncanny ability to absorb the feelings of those around him, and to articulate those feelings as no one else could.  At the same time, when Dylan chose to follow his own creative urgings, there were many who could not accept that he wasn't necessarily supposed to speak for them.

Woody Guthrie was genius, Hank Williams was genius, and the mournful sonnet by Odetta was haunting, but still genius.The thing I liked most about the movie was that the viewer was able to identify with the thought process of Dylan. You were able to personally feel what he felt. I was very proud of the fact that Dylan didn't care what critics thought. He did his own thing. He didn't 'turn his back' on anything. He simply evolved. The roots were still there.

Seems to be so much just passed over or avoided on this dvd ... so there's still a lot of mystery. What about his family, parents and so on?The one gripe I have is that Bob's MAIN influence once he hit New York was easily Ramblin' Jack Elliot!!! I mean they even called Dylan ""Son of Jack' back then. Jack lived with Woody and his family basically ... Dylan just visited Woody in the hospital once I believe. It was Jack's mannerisms and more advanced guitar techniques that Dylan copped to perfection. I don't think there was even a mention of Ramblin Jack in this documentary!!! For shame Bobbie.A great companion dvd is 'Ballad Of Ramblin' Jack' done by his estranged daughter. A better documentary in my opinion on many levels if one is interested in the times when Dylan and so many fantastic folk artists bloomed in NY. You'll gain a ton more insight regarding Woody via Arlo and his sister and learn a few new things about Dylan along the way.I was let down that Dylan and Martin avoided the area of Bob's greatest influence back in those days.

As a long-time Bob Dylan fan, this documentary is riveting and shocking (in a positive way).""No Direction Home: Bob Dylan"" (2 DVDs) contains quite a few surprises: first of all, Dylan himself provides commentary in a clear and focused way, not at all as one might expect from an artist who mostly appears on stage aloof, if not disinterested. Second, the footage that Scorsese uses, is absolutely astounding. Check for example the various Newport Folk Festival appearances. While DVD1 traces the early years of Dylan's childhood, and gives a good musical context of which artists influenced Dylan, the real treasures are on DVD2, and in particular the footage from the 1966 UK and European tour. Watch how an exhausted Dylan towards the end exasperates ""I don't want to go to Italy! I don't want to go nowhere! I just want to go home!"" The documentary ends with the infamous ""Judas"" performance of ""Like a Rolling Stone"", which has long been available on CD, but now for the first time is shown on film. And amidst it all, Dylan the elder-statesman comments how sick he was of it all by then (mid-1966). No surprise then that he made such subsequent incomprehensible albums like ""Self-Portrait""! Anything to be one step ahead of the public's expectations.The DVD comes with a number of extra features, the best of which is a collection of 8 Dylan performances, including early TV performances, ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" from the 1964 Newport Folk Festival, an unfinished ""I Can't Leave Her Behind"" from his hotel room in 1966, and 2 more songs from the 1966 UK tour. The sound quality is surprisingly good throughout. In all, this should be required viewing for anyone-young and old--interested in music (and not just folk or rock).

I also lived in New York in the 1960s and spent many of my teenage weekends in Greenwich Village. This film brings back all those days magnificently. Martin Scorsese after his brilliant ode to the Blues in 2003 has done it again! This 4 hour journey is worth watching again and again. You see new things each time you watch it, a mark of a great filmmaker! It just screened on TV here in Australia last week, but the DVD has been available here for over a month.My music interests are primarily a love for the Blues (see my reviews), but this film clearly puts the link between folk and blues together. My favourite parts of this DVD are the ""Electric"" folk Dylan performed with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Al Kooper (Blues Project, Blood, Sweat and Tears) and Mike Bloomfield. Films of Mike Bloomfield playing are exceedingly scarce (Monterrey, The Recent Blues Reunion DVD). Dylan unfolds the story of him meeting Bloomfield and asking him to help him go electric. They even show part of the set they did at Newport! You can hear but not see Mike! For the uninitiated, hear Mike on the PBBB East-West CD.This film follows Bob Dylan through his early career in the 1960s until his motorcycle accident towards the end of the decade. It is a perfect time frame. It shows the social and cultural changes in America, how music was part of them and how they contributed to the outcomes. We who were young at this time remember these days well- Civil Right's, The Women's Movement and  Vietnam! However, what I really love about Dylan in this film is that he shys away from any recognition for his contributions to these movements. Dylan is an enigma and that's always been part of his appeal.I am a Blues fan and not an expert on Dylan or his music. I found this DVD surprisingly entertaining and very interesting. I loved the way Dylan comes off and a person who did but didn't want fame, the best line in the whole thing is ""I just slipped in the door when nobody was looking and there wasn't anything anybody could do about it!"" He also indicates, like John Lennon did, that his songs were written as clusters of words he liked or sounded good and not necessarily to make any social points. Which I always thought anyway. People read what they wanted to in his music. I do agree with a previous reviewer that the best performance is ""Mr. Tambourine Man"" at the Newport Topical Song Workshop, with Pete Seeger in the background.

917965,A2K3UTNW0783U6,B000A0GP4K,Phillip Kay,"[6, 7]","Martin Scorsese's film No Direction Home, which I watched last night, provided an absorbing three and a half hours of insight into Bob Dylan's early life and his emergence into prominence and controversy in the mid sixties. I mention the duration of the movie because I can rarely sit and watch for so long without my attention wandering. Not in this film. Before remarking on the content of the film, it is worth considering Scorsese's direction. I recommend this film to anyone interested in watching or in making documentary film. The way in which archival material, concert footage and interview segments are integrated and paced is masterly. The film really tells a story and creates an atmosphere: I felt as though I was there. Scorsese's experience in making feature films has enriched his direction of this film. Although comparisons are silly, it may be his best film. It sent me back to The Last Waltz for comparison of his method.The film's most valuable asset is Dylan's own recounting of his past, and the most striking point about it is how much interview time in Dylan's early years was wasted in asking often trite questions of this most intuitive mind. He rarely answered them, and often could only express his irritation of the questioner. Scorsese's film of the contemporary Dylan rarely presents the questions, content to record what he has to say. Hibbing, Minnesota is stripped bare. Even Dylan's evasiveness, when dealing with his more questionable behaviour to friends and colleagues, is revealing. There is a conflict between Scorsese's intention to make a coherent narrative and Dylan's lifelong habit of crossing borders and categories, throwing dust on his trail and refusing to be pigeonholed that adds an interesting tension to the viewing.The main thrust of Scorsese's film is the impact of Dylan's crossover to electric instrumental accompaniment. Listeners then had become divided into self perceived groups, the folk 'purist', social conscience type and the mindless consumers of pop pap who just enjoyed the music, and Dylan outraged everyone by moving between these groups freely. His motives were neither pure nor particularly self aware. From the perspective of our own times the differences between these types of music seem less extreme: both were commercial entertainment; listening to a protest song was often a substitute for more committed action. Yet at the time the difference was important to those who were there. From the conflict that ensured, the boos and the cries of traitor, there would emerge something new in pop culture, the pop music artist, and Scorsese doesn't let us forget it. One disadvantage to this emphasis is that it focuses on the same period and phenomenon as Pennebaker's Don't Look Back, which is even quoted in Scorsese's film. The Pennebaker film (a masterpiece) has been available on DVD for some time, and most watchers of No Direction Home would be familiar with it (note the similar inspiration between the two titles).The film reveals Dylan's background, and then moves on to an overview of the music he grew up listening to, from Hank Williams to Muddy Waters, fascinating to those interested in developments in popular music. The society of Dylan's youth is sketched in vividly: Cold War, Greenwich Village, the folk music scene, the civil rights movement, the birth of folk-rock. The controversy over Dylan's move to electric instruments in the mid 60s is shown through concert footage. We see the Dylan who found, used and then dropped Woody Guthrie, Joan Baez and many others. One comment, that Dylan was like a sponge, reminded me of a similar comment about George Gershwin, who absorbed, or 'stole' elements from all the popular cultures of his time. But transformed them. This was the Dylan who became, unexpectedly, a pop star, who poured out a stream of literate, introspective pop lyrics which made pop culture 'respectable' to the intellectuals and had a transforming effect on the way popular music was presented by other artists. In a way Dylan could be said to have re-invented pop music in this period.So, everyone has his Dylan. In the 60s Dylan was for some The Genius; for others he was The Poet; for others again he was The Traitor. These are all projections of our own that tell us what we are looking for. No wonder Dylan dodged like crazy. Today if you become a star you deal with it by making it a persona, or you self destruct by taking it all seriously. Dylan survived because he had many personas. This film is Scorsese's Dylan. We'll never know Dylan's Dylan.Scorsese's film covers the period 1941 to 1968, when Dylan suffered injuries in a motor cycle accident when he was about 26 years old. Therefore the film does not deal with a lot of important things about Dylan: his marriage and family; his influence on popular music, especially on the Beatles; the literary value of his song lyrics and his stature as probably the greatest of popular song writers; his use, even quite late in his career, of traditional melodies (which is common folk practice); the creation of country rock; the disintegration and self healing recorded on Blood on the Tracks; his various religious affiliations; and his non musical activities such as paintings and novels. If anyone reading this knows Martin Scorsese would they ask if a second film is going to be made covering this material? Probably the elusive Dylan would consider it too defining and completing a study to be made in his lifetime, but you can only ask.",5,Scorsese's Dylan,1128988800,"10 11, 2005",2005,5509,"['Martin',

917966,A292YWWNFVSIWY,B000A0GP4K,Publius,"[11, 13]","If there can be any discernable pattern of development in the early career of Bob Dylan, it is his moving from the idyllic world of simple folk music, to the dirty world of electrified blues.  ""No Direction Home"" demonstrates the direction that Dylan took using newly found archival footage, past and present interviews and incredible performances.  Dylan is often thought of as an American original, but the musical grounds that he has walked on for now over 40 years is well tread.  The originality of Dylan, however, lies in the fact that he took so many different paths as an artist and a musician.  As he said in this film: ""You have to realize that as an artist, you need to be constantly moving.""  ""No Direction Home"" focuses on the first two iterations of Dylan.  The first Dylan in this movie is the folk artist embraced by the Greenwich Village liberals, while the next Dylan is the blues musician embraced by almost no one at first.The first Dylan songs speak to the future,  (A hard rain gonna fall...) while the next Dylan has his feet firmly planted in the present.  (How does it feel...)  Dylan's recent albums ""Time Out of Mind"" and ""Love and Theft"" reach further back into American musical history.  Unfortunately, the artist (and Dylan is no exception to this) has an unfortunate tendency to wound the people that they leave behind as they move in a different direction.  For example, the bitterness of Joan Baez and Pete Seeger is still palpable in ""No Direction Home.""  Overall, Scorsese's direction is great to watch, but, the last word appropriately should belong to Dylan, ""I wish that I'd been a doctor, maybe I'd saved some lives that been lost, maybe I could have done some good in this world...'stead of burning every bridge I'd crossed.""  (From the album `Infidels')  What makes ""No Direction Home"" such a great documentary to watch is that we get to see Dylan burn that bridge with the reckless abandon that we would never expect from a popular musician today.",5,The Present from the Future,1127779200,"09 27, 2005",2005,1989,"['can', 'be', 'discernable', 'pattern', 'development', 'early', 'career', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'moving', 'idyllic', 'world', 'simple', 'folk', 'music', 'dirty', 'world', 'electrified', 'blues', 'Direction', 'Home', 'direction', 'Dylan', 'took', 'using', 'newly', 'found', 'archival', 'footage', 'past', 'present', 'interviews', 'incredible', 'performances', 'Dylan', 'often', 'thought', 'American', 'original', 'musical', 'grounds', 'walked', 'now', '40', 'years', 'well', 'tread', 'originality', 'Dylan', 'however', 'fact', 'took', 'so', 'many', 'different', 'paths', 'artist', 'musician', 'said', 'film', 'have', 'realize', 'artist', 'need', 'be', 'constantly', 'moving', 'Direction', 'Home', 'first', 'two', 'iterations', 'Dylan', 'first', 'Dylan', 'movie', 'folk', 'artist', 'embraced', 'Greenwich', 'Village', 'liberals', 'next', 'Dylan', 'blues', 'musician', 'embraced', 'almost', 'one', 'first.The', 'first', 'Dylan', 'speak', 'future', 'hard', 'rain', 'gon', 'fall', 'next', 'Dylan', 'feet', 'firmly', 'planted', 'present', 'How', 'feel', 'Dylan', 'recent', 'albums', 'Time', 'Out', 'Mind', 'Love', 'Theft', 'reach', 'further', 'back', 'American', 'musical', 'history', 'Unfortunately', 'artist', 'Dylan', 'exception', 'unfortunate', 'tendency', 'wound', 'people', 'leave', 'move', 'different', 'direction', 'example', 'bitterness', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'Pete', 'Seeger', 'still', 'palpable', 'Direction', 'Home', 'Overall', 'Scorsese', 'direction', 'great', 'watch', 'last', 'word', 'appropriately', 'should', 'belong', 'Dylan', 'wish', ""'d"", 'been', 'doctor', 'maybe', ""'d"", 'saved', 'lives', 'been', 'lost', 'maybe', 'could', 'have', 'done', 'good', 'world', ""'stead"", 'burning', 'bridge', ""'d"", 'crossed', 'album', 'Infidels', 'What', 'No', 'Direction', 'Home', 'such', 'great', 'documentary', 'watch', 'get', 'see', 'Dylan', 'burn', 'bridge', 'reckless', 'abandon', 'would', 'never', 'expect', 'popular', 'musician', 'today']",Bob Dylan - No Direction Home

It's the artist as a young man, from baby-fat folkie to cadaver like rocker, burning his candle at both ends; and it's the times Dylan helped change - whether he likes to admit it or not.  The press conference clips show Dylan as both a captured and captivating participant - at turns volatile, and humble.  It's also a nice look at his peers and mentors, some self-serving, others, like Ginsberg, deeply touching.  The full-length versions of the songs with Dylan captured in concert, and the other interviewees in relaxed settings are all marvelous.  But its Dylan's rendition of ""Like a Rolling Stone,"" that blows the lid off - the eye-rolling Dylan is inspired, impassioned, and near crazed.  Anyone performing with that much energy could only crash and burn.But that's it.  Five years in a career of 40.  It's a good stopping point in terms of dramatic arc, but only the beginning of the story, and certainly left me wanting more.

J MOSS,"[2, 3]","Try compiling a modest collection of, say, 12 tracks of Bob's greatest songs since the mid 1970s and it soon becomes apparent how much fertility was in the whipper snipper in the 60s. Don't get me wrong. I have dipped into stuff from throughout a career that has accompanied me throughout my maturity. And, yes, I did take succour from,'Time Out of Mind', and'Love and Theft'. There's always something worth listening to on a Bob outing. But we no longer expect, with baited breath, the next move. Scorcese has the same enthusiasm for the prodigious early Bob as all of us that have committed those formative songs to the soundrack of our adolescence. How we were infatuated with the androgny of that face, the eyelids closing as the heavily vowelled rhymes found their way to us. Was this a blokey thing?As a stylist, we took his taste in clothes, and his put-downs of interviewers sent us into delerium. There were no false moves. But you can tell, with the marvels of 20/20 rear vision, that nearing the end of this brilliant doco. if ever a lad was cruising for a bruising, it was Bob. No matter how trifling the bike accident might have been to cause his retirement from the hurly burly of public life, it was just in the nick of time. Sagacious Bob provides the glue to the footage, looking more and more like Keith Richards, these days. There's Van Ronk, the bourgeoise looking Baez, and a glimpse of the ethereal John Jacob Niles.

Martin Scorsese does a masterful job over 3 1/2 hours of old film clips of Dylan on his way up from humble Minnesota beginnings to international pop icon. It covers his life chronologically from those early days to 1966 when he had his motorcycle accident.  Absolutely mesmorizing. There are old home movies of his hometown of Hibbing Minnesota, and the influences along the way that shaped Dylan into the premier spokesman of his generation. Influences like Woody Guthrie, old bluesmen, Bobby Vee and many others.  His early New York folk singer days with Von Ronk, Joan Baez, Clancy Brothers and more, paint a vivid picture of what the New York folk scene was in the late 50's and early 60's.  One fascinating segment was how the ""suits"" at Columbia Records were scratching their heads at John Hammond's recommendation of signing him up on that label in 1962. A label that had Johnny Mathis, Tony Bennett and Doris Day and Mitch Miller as head honcho. He revolutionized how songs were written and how songs were sung.  It covers his conversion to electric guitar and all the backlash, especially the 1966 Royal Albert Hall Concerts where the British described his new sound as ""Rubbish!""

Most interesting for many viewers who know Dylan only as a folk-rock star is the film's portrayal of his emergence from utter obscurity into national prominence by the age of twenty. Looking at old photographs and early footage, we see the first of his many self-inventions, based in large part on the songs of Woody Guthrie and nourished in the creative epicenter of Greenwich Village in 1960.For anyone who lived through the 1960s, the film also vividly recalls the political and social turmoil of that time, which did much to create the public figure of Bob Dylan the singer of ""protest"" songs. We see him thrust by others into the role of spokesman for a ""new generation"" clamoring for social justice. And it charts the evolution of Dylan into his incarnation as folk rocker, experienced by many loyal fans and other performers as a bitter betrayal, which is where the film leaves us, in the knowledge that he had outgrown one persona to embrace one that would command an even larger fan base.The film's length also permits reference to a large swath of mid-century musical history, ranging from Johnny Cash to Johnny Mathis. There are also telling glimpses into the recording industry as it both shaped and attempted to anticipate the evolution of popular taste during this time. And there is much more.What the film doesn't do, even in its interviews with Dylan years later, is reveal him as more than a gifted opportunist who somehow tapped into the collective unconscious of his time (or so his early career is remembered by others in the music business who are interviewed in the film). Even in the rare glimpses into his private life he is, as close friend Joan Baez remembers him, self-absorbed and unpredictable, finally enigmatic.Special features include performances of Dylan songs by Mavis Staples, Maria Maldauer and others. My favorite is Joan Baez's ""Love Is Just a Four-Letter Word,"" which mimicks Dylan's phrasing at points. For Dylan fans and anyone interested in the history of popular music in America, this DVD set is a total immersion in ten of its most amazing years.",5,Big Noise from Hibbing . . .,1134518400,"12 14, 2005",2005,2178,"['3.5', 'hours', 'fascinating', 'documentary', 'can', 'cover', 'lot', 'territory', 'Most', 'interesting', 'many', 'viewers', 'who', 'know', 'Dylan', 'only', 'folk-rock', 'star', 'film', 'portrayal', 'emergence', 'utter', 'obscurity', 'national', 'prominence', 'age', 'twenty', 'Looking', 'old', 'photographs', 'early', 'footage', 'see', 'first', 'many', 'self-inventions', 'based', 'large', 'part', 'songs', 'Woody', 'Guthrie', 'nourished', 'creative', 'epicenter', 'Greenwich', 'Village', '1960.For', 'anyone', 'who', 'lived', '1960s', 'film', 'also', 'vividly', 'political', 'social', 'turmoil', 'time', 'did', 'much', 'create', 'public', 'figure', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'singer', 'protest', 'songs', 'see', 'thrust', 'others', 'role', 'spokesman', 'new', 'generation', 'clamoring', 'social', 'justice', 'evolution', 'Dylan', 'incarnation', 'folk', 'rocker', 'experienced', 'many', 'loyal', 'fans', 'other', 'performers', 'bitter', 'betrayal', 'where', 'film', 'knowledge', 'had', 'outgrown', 'one', 'persona', 'embrace', 'one', 'would', 'command', 'even', 'larger', 'fan', 'base.The', 'film', 'length', 'also', 'reference', 'large', 'swath', 'mid-century', 'musical', 'history', 'ranging', 'Johnny', 'Cash', 'Johnny', 'Mathis', 'are', 'also', 'telling', 'glimpses', 'recording', 'industry', 'shaped', 'attempted', 'anticipate', 'evolution', 'popular', 'taste', 'time', 'much', 'film', ""n't"", 'do', 'even', 'interviews', 'Dylan', 'years', 'later', 'reveal', 'more', 'gifted', 'opportunist', 'who', 'somehow', 'tapped', 'collective', 'unconscious', 'time', 'so', 'early', 'career', 'remembered', 'others', 'music', 'business', 'who', 'are', 'interviewed', 'film', 'Even', 'rare', 'glimpses', 'private', 'life', 'close', 'friend', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'self-absorbed', 'unpredictable', 'finally', 'enigmatic.Special', 'features', 'include', 'performances', 'Dylan', 'songs', 'Mavis', 'Staples', 'Maria', 'Maldauer', 'others', 'favorite', 'Joan', 'Baez', 'Love', 'Just', 'Four-Letter', 'Word', 'Dylan', 'phrasing', 'points', 'Dylan', 'fans', 'anyone', 'interested', 'history', 'popular', 'music', 'America', 'DVD', 'set', 'total', 'immersion', 'ten', 'most', 'amazing', 'years']",Bob Dylan - No Direction Home

That was my hope, that it would be as good as it was hyped to be, and I was not fully satisfied.I was more than satisfied with Part One (late 1950's-63) - very little psycho-babble on his childhood; merely shots of his face as a kid fading into the music which influenced him. The arrangement of the old footage from Woody Guthrie to Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers(they even had the legendary John Jacob Niles!) was genuinely exciting; it was Dylan without warts (the guy stole 45 invaluable records from a generous folk music collector, justifying it by claiming to be a musical expeditionary, and with a straight face); and Dave van Ronk was a genuine character, stating that Dylan was comfortable with the Left, but not really a man of the Left. Yet the Left cottoned on to him, seeing him in terms of an activism which was not fully there (compared with Baez or the courageous Pete Seeger). This told me far more about the wish-fulfilment of the US Left in the early 60s than any other programme. The Dylan performances were gems. So - Part One was excellent, with the music and the historical contexzt reinforcing each other.But - Part Two (1963-66) did not live up to my expectations. The great performances by Dylan were there - they even had the legendary British concert where someone called out 'Judas' as he began Like a Rolling Stone, leading him to spit back 'you're a liar' and to use the song like a gun against the critics in the crowd (they had been partly organised by the British Communist Party, who were angry at Dylan's withdrawal form political folk music). The historical context was there at the start, but then suddenly stopped. It became one-sided - a chronicle of his performances, at its best a recognition that Dylan's breath-control in the 1964-66 period was an expression of beat poetry set to electronic sound (Whitman and Ginsburg used breath as a more natural means of organising the poetic line than the artifical iambic pentameter).But the historical context was missing - what was Dylan's attitude to the Vietnam War? The angst in his music of 1964-66, looking for the desperate and desolate in an age of affluence, was to my mind a reflection of the angst troubling American society as the Great Society was being proclaimed.Worse, the musical context was missing. What about the Beatles, whose own music was transformed by Dylan, and who helped to transform Dylan (""that's nothing; it's just something I learned in England"")? Dylan didn't stop listening to music in 63; he continued to evolve, and the musical influences on that evolution are missing here. So we are left with the performances, magical as they were.So - Part Two was not excellent.

Consciously or unconsciously,he realised he could not be a broadsider,hawking his conscience from cause to cause.Dylan was perceived by fans to betray acoustic folk protest to go over to playing in a group,going electric,writing rock songs,become commercialized.He had been `owned' by the left-wing protest movement,as a spokes-man for his generation.Baez helpfully suggests he would be pushing himself down one narrow tunnel,shutting off other paths and the wider world.Asked what his songs meant,he said he was just a `song and dance man.'What is clear is his most singular drive,not being deflected to please his fans, going where he wanted to,taking fans with him if they wanted to follow.He seems bemused by his popularity not analytical.He would rather have been a poet,hence the name Dylan from Dylan Thomas.Ginsberg expresses something which had to change when he shifted over to electric.In his singing says Ginsberg, he `had found a way for all his consciousness and intelligence to be focussed on his breath'.That connection would become broken when he played electric guitar.The organic quality,the magnetic hold with his audience would become lost.The group played loud,Dylan shouted over the guitars.Seeger wanted to cut the cable.Mr Tambourine Man was his break away from public manipulation into inner worlds.He learned from The Byrds how it could be done and helearned from the Beatles,that pop and rock music were the future.He injected real intelligence into pop lyrics.He shifted for a while into country music after his motor-cycle crash rest period.Dylan gives sober commentaries looking back on his elusive,mercurial youth.He's very clear-eyed and matter-of-fact.

917985,A1VH6QWC6JZRAC,B000A0GP4K,The Guardian,"[1, 1]","To craft this superb three-and-a-half-hour landmark documentary presented on two separate DVDs, Martin Scorsese reportedly edited down more than 10 hours of source material, so as usual with filmmaking most of the available footage was left on the cutting room floor. The result is a textbook lesson in first-class documentary filmmaking very much in the mould of Scorsese's 1978 release `The Last Waltz' or his excellent film series about the blues.Scorsese's ambition with `No Direction Home' is to tell the story of Bob Dylan's journey from obscure origins in Hibbing Minnesota to international success in the mid-1960s. In 1966 following injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident, he dropped out of the public eye for a couple of years to later re-emerge into the second phase of his long and enigmatic career.The film describes Dylan's time in Greenwich Village NYC in 1961-62 (visiting Woody Guthrie in hospital, playing the folk club circuit and making his first recordings), then uses Dylan's important but at the time controversial UK tour in 1963 as the framework for a revealing montage of concert footage, straight-to-camera interviews with the young Bob and contributions from Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Alan Ginsberg, Al Kooper and others from the period. His embracing of electric instruments and a fuller sound in the teeth of the anger and bewilderment of diehard folk purists is well told, an early character indication of iconoclastic mould-breaking. Dylan is and always has been his own man, does what he wants and answers to no-one; he can come across as hard-as-nails even whilst delivering sentiments of exquisite tenderness.At the end of the film, do we understand more about the 20th century's most important popular musician/poet, the `voice of a generation', and what makes him tick? Well, a bit. Dylan's legendary taciturn personality and cryptic answers to (sometimes unbelievably crass) interview questions is on full display here, and the film really does reveal something of the young man in all his frustrating don't-try-to-pin-me-down complexity. Now aged 70, he ain't changed that much.This is an absorbing, interesting film which never drags, despite its length. Martin Scorsese is very, very good at this game.

The movie focusses on Dylan's life itself, not just his music career. It shows a lot of interviews with different people who knew Bob Dylan or just knew his music. I was captivated with how the movie managed to just flow freely and was surprised when it ended because if seemed like it had only just begun. This is one film you should definately see.The film focusses on Bob Dylan's childhood; from growing up in a town in Minnesota, and how he managed to start singing and playing music in small coffe houses and even festivals. What was great about this film is all the new footage that was aired in it. We see still photography shots of Dylan as a young man, playing with a guitar or his harmonica in front of a crowd of people. There is old footage of concerts, interviews, and press conferences that many people probably wouldn't have seen back then, or even now.Interviews include people such as; Izzy Young, Paul Nelson, Al Kooper, Allen Ginsberg, and many others. But probably the greatest interviewee of them all is Bob Dylan himself. He talks about everything! Growing up, his first musical performance, he even talks about other great musical artists, my favorite of them being Johnny Cash. Some great footage in this film.Extras include:Bob Dylan Performances:No Direction HomeBlowin' in the WindMr. Tambourine ManMan of Constant SorrowGirl of the North CountryLove Minus Zero/No LimitOne Too Many MorningsPlus More!This is one fantastic look at Bob Dylan.

We obsessed about his album art, his liner notes, his comments, his lyrics, everything. There is nothing like it anymore. I really enjoyed this documentary because I could finally sit back as a middle-aged person and objectively look at Mr Dylan and his remarkable (first!) tranformation. My take home message? Even Bob does not understand Bob. I think, and bear with me on this, that when someone has a mind that is processing information in a non-traditional way that it is impossible to explain these processes to the rest of us. It is probably not possible to linearize and explain what is going on in his head. The word I'm struggling for is ""ineffable"".

Ryan ""American Hit Network""","[17, 19]","While watching Martin Scorcese's Dylan biopic, ""No Direction Home,"" I kept wondering just what might have happened if all of the obsessed Dylan-philes from the early `60s had known all the facts as they are presented here. At the time of Dylan's fairly sudden rise to fame, he was surrounded by so many myths - many of them self-perpetuated - that the true Dylan fan of the time could only believe what he heard (or not). This naturally lent Dylan a mysterious aura that only made him more attractive to the fans who wanted to figure him out. More importantly, it also lent his writing that same aura of mystery, leaving every single person who came in contact with his words to apply their own interpretations, or scratch their heads in awe, wondering what all of it could possibly mean. This method of self-mythification worked brilliantly for Dylan, although it also backfired in some ways, especially when it led to people rifling through his garbage for clues, or assigning their own opinions and meanings to words that he did not intend. Nonetheless, it was fascinating to watch the contemporary Joan Baez explain (rather saucily) how Dylan would write some verse that even he considered mysterious, then show it to Joan Baez to ask her opinion. When she offered her own interpretations, Dylan was pleased, and commented that years from now, people would probably still be doing the exact same thing.Watching the modern day Dylan remove much of the myth that surrounded his early days is perhaps the most fascinating element of this 2-part biography of Dylan's first foray into fame. His lucid explanations of how his thought process functioned back then would have been a Rosetta Stone for the obsessed Dylan fans, but I wonder if they would have believed what they heard, even if they knew that it came straight from Dylan's mouth. After all, they already sensed that he was `colorizing' aspects of his past and so might have considered the source untrustworthy, but more importantly, they probably didn't want to see the myth disturbed. The truth would have made everything so plebian. From today's perspective, though, the truth is just as fantastic as the myth.Episode one of ""No Direction Home"" covers the time period from Dylan's youth in Hibbing, Minnesota to the fame following the release of his third album. A lot has been made of Dylan's constant reinvention, but few people concede that in the beginning, he reinvented himself with virtually every record. Here, Dylan himself makes it clear that the changes were a combination of deliberation and a reaction to the times. His first album was a quickly assembled hodgepodge of random influences, painting him as an adequate folk singer. The second album launched his career as a serious songwriter, with thought-provoking words and melodies that could be `beautified' by Peter, Paul and Mary or Trini Lopez. A rather telling (and amusing) moment occurs when a music publisher takes credit for making Dylan famous because he managed to distribute his songs among so many different artists. It's a ludicrous claim, but it has an element of truth to it, too, since middle-class America is unlikely to have accepted Dylan without middle-of-the-road artists softening the rougher edges of his own performance.My only complaint here is with Scorcese's means of assembling some of the footage. Perhaps sensing that he would lose some of his audience if he didn't let us see some `electrified' Dylan, he continually cuts into the future, showing us footage of Dylan and the Band before a hostile English audience. The result is disconcerting, especially since it was usually irrelevant to the topic that was previously being discussed. I think it might have been ultimately more effective to watch Dylan evolve organically into his electrified phase, since it would probably better convey the shock and sense of betrayal felt by his older fans. Instead, it is confusing, especially for younger fans who wish to understand this very important phase of musical history, and it will almost certainly soften the sudden impact of the change when it is covered in part two of this biopic. Nonetheless, this is a fascinating assemblage of rare footage, myth debunking, and revisionist history that does not let go. I can't wait to see part two, and I only wish that Scorcese and Dylan would consider continuing their collaboration, all the way up to the present day.

Songs can't save the world.""-Bob DylanThroughout Martin Scorsese's two-hundred minute documentary we get to see Bob Dylan squirm under a barage of journalist questions. Several times he just asks the questions right back at them, and at one point starts snapping pictures of the photographers themselves. Dylan is portrayed as a chameleon, refusing to be a spokesman for the left or put on a pedestal by the folk movement. The closer Scorsese gets to his subject the blurrier he becomes.The story of Dylan is framed nicely within the turbulent times his music came about. When pictures of Dylan's sleepy Midwest town is flashed across the screen it's apparent that the straight laced conformity was indicative of the nation as a whole.No sooner are we are introduced to the restless kid who enrolled in college but never went to any classes, then we see him skirt to New York where he is rumoured to have followed in the footsteps of the old bluesmen, and sells his soul to the devil. Shortly after, his mediocre playing is transformed into confident musicianship.During the times Dylan is in New York you can almost feel the pressure that was building in America. This is also the time where he probably gained a political consciousness that he would later accept or deny depending on how he felt, or maybe on who was asking.The majority of the concert footage contains booing and heckling from the crowd. I had always heard about the controversy concerning Dylan ""plugging in,"" but it is something else to actually witness it.This documentary has a long running time, but it never dragged. I was constanty intrigued, and always engaged. No Direction Home is richly layered and deals with a lot more than just Bob Dylan -- I'm sure I don't understand half of it. Scorsese show us a scene of Andy Warhol and Dylan right before he cuts to some British fans deriding the new Dylan music as ""pop."" As is the case with any Scorsese movie, it is about a lot more than what's up on the screen. In some way No Direction Home is about the changing art of the sixties. It was this decade that modernism started to visibly give way to the post-modern movement, and that's represented here as Dylan claims his music is a collage of influences.The relation between Dylan and his music also intrigued me. The Beats and many of these folk musicians viewed art as a truthful unveiling. Much of this film will have you wondering if Dylan's music concealed as much as it revealed. The idea of an artistic ""Truth"" is chipped away at, and instead Dylan lets little ""truths"" slip out of his art. There is an act going on whenever Dylan writes a song, and especially when he performs a song. At times it is almost as if he is creating a personality out of bits of images and sounds he finds in the world, and then puts them together to create something fresh.The film manages to deal with multiple themes without losing sight of its subject. In fact, it is precisely because the film deals with so much that it didn't lose my interest despite its length. Scorsese has shown us one of America's great artist, and in the process proves that he also belongs in that category.",5,Fascinating,1138060800,"01 24, 2006",2006,3232,"['songs', 'are', 'protest', 'songs', '-Bob', 'Dylan', ""'ve"", 'never', 'written', 'political', 'song', 'Songs', 'ca', ""n't"", 'save', 'world', '-Bob', 'DylanThroughout', 'Martin', 'Scorsese', 'two-hundred', 'minute', 'documentary', 'get', 'see', 'Bob', 'Dylan', 'squirm', 'barage', 'journalist', 'questions', 'Several', 'times', 'just', 'questions', 'right', 'back', 'one', 'point', 'snapping', 'pictures', 'photographers', 'Dylan', 'portrayed', 'chameleon', 'refusing', 'be', 'spokesman', 'left', 'put', 'pedestal', 'folk', 'movement', 'closer', 'Scorsese', 'subject', 'blurrier', 'story', 'Dylan', 'framed', 'nicely', 'turbulent', 'times', 'music', 'came', 'about', 'When', 'pictures', 'Dylan', 'sleepy', 'Midwest', 'town', 'flashed', 'screen', 'apparent', 'straight', 'laced', 'conformity', 'was', 'indicative', 'nation', 'whole.No', 'sooner', 'are', 'are', 'introduced', 'restless', 'kid', 'who', 'enrolled', 'college', 'never', 'went', 'classes', 'then', 'see', 'skirt', 'New', 'York', 'where', 'rumoured', 'have', 'followed', 'footsteps', 'old', 'bluesmen', 'soul', 'devil', 'Shortly', 'mediocre', 'playing', 'transformed', 'confident', 'musicianship.During', 'times', 'Dylan', 'New', 'York', 'can', 'almost', 'feel', 'pressure', 'was', 'building', 'America', 'also', 'time', 'where', 'probably', 'gained', 'political', 'consciousness', 'would', 'later', 'accept', 'deny', 'depending', 'how', 'felt', 'maybe', 'who', 'was', 'asking.The', 'majority', 'concert', 'footage', 'booing', 'heckling', 'crowd', 'had', 'always', 'heard', 'controversy', 'concerning', 'Dylan', 'plugging', 'something', 'else', 'actually', 'witness', 'it.This', 'documentary', 'long', 'running', 'time', 'never', 'dragged', 'was', 'constanty', 'intrigued', 'always', 'engaged', 'Direction', 'Home', 'richly', 'layered', 'deals', 'lot', 'more', 'just', 'Bob', 'Dylan', ""'m"", 'sure', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'half', 'Scorsese', 'show', 'scene', 'Andy', 'Warhol', 'Dylan', 'right', 'British', 'fans', 'deriding', 'new', 'Dylan', 'music', 'pop', 'case', 'Scorsese', 'movie', 'lot', 'more', 'what', 'up', 'screen', 'way', 'Direction', 'Home', 'changing', 'art', 'sixties', 'was', 'decade', 'modernism', 'started', 'visibly', 'give', 'way', 'post-modern', 'movement', 'represented', 'here', 'Dylan', 'music', 'collage', 'influences.The', 'relation', 'Dylan', 'music', 'also', 'intrigued', 'Beats', 'many', 'folk', 'musicians', 'viewed', 'art', 'truthful', 'unveiling', 'Much', 'film', 'will', 'have', 'wondering', 'Dylan', 'music', 'concealed', 'as', 'much', 'revealed', 'idea', 'artistic', 'Truth', 'chipped', 'away', 'instead', 'Dylan', 'little', 'truths', 'slip', 'art', 'act', 'going', 'Dylan', 'song', 'especially', 'when', 'song', 'times', 'almost', 'creating', 'personality', 'bits', 'images', 'world', 'then', 'together', 'create', 'something', 'fresh.The', 'film', 'manages', 'deal', 'multiple', 'themes', 'losing', 'sight', 'subject', 'fact', 'precisely', 'film', 'deals', 'so', 'much', 'did', ""n't"", 'lose', 'interest', 'length', 'Scorsese', 'shown', 'one', 'America', 'great', 'artist', 'process', 'also', 'category']",Bob Dylan - No Direction Home
917990,A24YVJWNLBU314,B000A0GP4K,Trevor Seigler,"[5, 6]","In ""No Direction Home"", Martin Scorsese gives us a rare look at Bob Dylan's pivotal and volatile evolution from a Woody Guthrie copycat to arguably the single most important solo artist in rock history. And he does so with enigmatic clips of the man himself, old and withered, looking back on a time when everything changed not only for himself but for the world of pop music at large.The film, which uses Dylan's 1966 British tour as a frame of reference, looks at Dylan's beginnings in the cold wilds of Minnesota, his move to New York and rise to fame in the folk circles, and the moment that he ""plugged in"" and revolutionized music forever. Through it all, there is the music, which really gets a better treatment than in most ""musician bios"". After all, it's the music that made Dylan a landmark cultural icon, and coupled with the various images he adopted over the course of the years (here seen first as a Guthrie acolyte, then a roving folkie, and finally a stoned-out rock god), it is a fitting testament to his aura and appeal.Much like ""The Beatles Anthology"" some ten years ago, ""No Direction Home"" uses archival footage and modern interviews blended together to present a seamless look at what was, and what is. Scorsese narrows his focus to the years of 1958 to 1966, during Dylan's groundbreaking debut and transformation from the darling of the folk scene to something much more. He intersperses accounts from contemporaries like Dave Van Ronk, Joan Baez, and Allen Ginsburg with footage of Dylan's performances to make a compelling portrait of an American enigma.That being said, you won't come away from the movie feeling as if you ""know"" Bob Dylan. Such would be impossible, because in some ways it is his mysterious aura that keeps him in the public eye. But whatever you may feel is lacking in your knowledge of the man, you will come to understand the drive behind his music all that much more.When Dylan first appeared, of course, he was taken up as the second coming of his idol, Woody Guthrie. As he relates in the film, Dylan became disenchanted with the movement and soon began looking for ways out of what he considered a barrier on his artistic growth. What you come away with is the sense not only of how he felt about his transformation to a rock sound, but also how his peers in the folk scene (many of whom praised his early work) felt and why both sides had a right to do so.Bob Dylan's life and work will always be a source of endless fascination for those continuing generations that discover him. In ""No Direction Home"", Martin Scorsese has given the world a fine look into his most revolutionary period, a time that saw him rise from the Boy-King of the New York folk scene to a pop icon with a poetic license unlike the groups that came before him. And in the middle of the film, Dylan shares the great secret of what fueled all these changes: ""A real artist is never satisfied with what he's doing.

917991,A1JNKGC3C6OVGQ,B000A0GP4K,"Ujjwal Dey ""2write""","[2, 3]","Bob Dylan sings about us. He lets us in on his childhood to struggle to learn styles to a break at Columbia Records and his instant fame which was not an instant at all.He sings about individuals. He lets us know as he used to do the rounds of Cafes at New York's Village where he decided to strike a chord with at least one listener. Aiming to target his audience out, he further enhanced his skills and style learning as much in 2 months in the Village as someone may learn in a lifetime of playing music.If Dylan sold his dirt I would buy it. I am that obsessed with his persona and music.This documentary does a great job and bringing us his roots. Incredible footage of not just Dylan but that of those artists who inspired him to be what he is. Most of all his love of Woody Gunthrie's music. He grew up from a small town nobody to a National and International sensation.A man with his voice at that time couldn't even make a buck, while Dylan with his choice of words and topics revolutionised the entire Music Industry.Country music or mainstream - he is a Rock Star like no other.Still counting he is publishing more records and setting new standards. Martin Scorcese lets us visit the humble star who talk candidly about his meetings, performances, influences and success. Truly magical world revealed here as we see how from Jack Kerouac's On the Road to a book on Woody Gunthrie feels like home to the teenage Dylan.A world of misfits and he fits at ease in it. Thinking what others can't dream of, he merges and weaves and intertwines styles and stories to make an incredible form of music with unmatched pace.This is true homage to the legend that is Bob Dylan.Thank You ""whomever it may concern"" for this documentary.",5,Hey Mr. Revolution Man sing a song for me,1187481600,"08 19, 2007",2007,1732,"['Bob', 'Dylan', 'childhood', 'struggle', 'learn', 'styles', 'break', 'Columbia', 'Records', 'instant', 'fame', 'was', 'not', 'instant', 'all.He', 'sings', 'individuals', 'know', 'used', 'do', 'rounds', 'Cafes', 'New', 'York', 'Village', 'where', 'decided', 'strike', 'chord', 'least', 'one', 'listener', 'Aiming', 'target', 'audience', 'out', 'further', 'enhanced', 'skills', 'style', 'learning', 'much', '2', 'months', 'Village', 'someone', 'may', 'learn', 'lifetime', 'playing', 'music.If', 'Dylan', 'sold', 'dirt', 'would', 'buy', 'am', 'obsessed', 'persona', 'music.This', 'documentary', 'great', 'job', 'bringing', 'roots', 'Incredible', 'footage', 'not', 'just', 'Dylan', 'artists', 'who', 'inspired', 'be', 'what', 'Most', 'love', 'Woody', 'Gunthrie', 'music', 'grew', 'up', 'small', 'town', 'nobody', 'National', 'International', 'sensation.A', 'man', 'voice', 'time', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'make', 'buck', 'Dylan', 'choice', 'words', 'topics', 'revolutionised', 'entire', 'Music', 'Industry.Country', 'music', 'mainstream', 'Rock', 'Star', 'other.Still', 'counting', 'publishing', 'more', 'records', 'setting', 'new', 'standards', 'Martin', 'Scorcese', 'lets', 'visit', 'humble', 'star', 'who', 'talk', 'candidly', 'meetings', 'performances', 'influences', 'success', 'Truly', 'magical', 'world', 'revealed', 'here', 'see', 'how', 'Jack', 'Kerouac', 'Road', 'book', 'Woody', 'Gunthrie', 'feels', 'home', 'teenage', 'Dylan.A', 'world', 'misfits', 'ease', 'Thinking', 'what', 'others', 'ca', ""n't"", 'dream', 'weaves', 'intertwines', 'styles', 'stories', 'make', 'incredible', 'form', 'music', 'unmatched', 'pace.This', 'true', 'homage', 'legend', 'Bob', 'Dylan.Thank', 'may', 'concern', 'documentary']",Bob Dylan - No Direction Home
