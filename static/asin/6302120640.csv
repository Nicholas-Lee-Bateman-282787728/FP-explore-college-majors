297023,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,6302120640,Andrew Ellington,"[2, 2]","Few films are able to capture the thin line that runs between a child's innocence and an adult's corruption quite like `Ivanovo Detstvo'.  With rich visual detail and carefully established characters, `Ivanovo Detstvo' is a marvelously crafted film that attacks a very mature subject with the delicacy needed to carry the air of a child's perspective.I just recently (as in a few minutes ago) reviewed `El Espiritu de la Colmena' (The Spirit of the Beehive) and made the comment that both this film and that one are similar in structure and meaning.  After I published that review I realized that I didn't expound upon that as much as I needed to, and thus wanted to write this one in order to do just that.  Some who have seen both films may imidiatly find my statement false, claiming that `Ivanovo Detstvo' is clearly about revenge while `El Espiritu de la Colmena' is far from a revenge tale, and in that respect you are correct; but my statement was not made to insinuate that at all.  What I meant by the comparison was that both films are about a child's perception of an adult's world.  In `El Espiritu de la Colmena' you have a young girl trying to understand her surroundings and resorting to a fairy tale like masking in order to find solace.  Here you have a young man who is so ravaged by his violent past that he is forced to thrust himself into a world he doesn't understand in order to find some sort of closure.  Like `El Espiritu de la Colmena', the contrast between reality and fantasy is prevalent and poignant within `Ivanovo Detstvo'.I just wanted to get that off my chest.This film tells the tragic story of young Ivan, a twelve-year-old orphan who has vowed to avenge his murdered family by working as a spy against the German's during World War II.  Because of his small size and his controlled demeanor he has been able to cross enemy lines undetected and thus been allowed to remain in the front lines, but his age and his background have caused some to suggest he needs to be taken out of the danger zone and placed in military school.  This does not mesh well with Ivan's idea or vengeance.Famed director Andrei Tarkovsky made his directorial debut (of a full length feature) with this masterpiece and set the tone for his future work.  The film is littered with startling and profound imagery that make a lasting impact and speak volumes to the viewer.  From the haunting (barren homes and the well) to the shocking (empty nooses and guillotines) to the monumental (planes protruding from sandy shores and apples shared over a joyride) to the beautiful and heartwarming (the suspended kiss over the ravine and the carefree run down the beach), `Ivanovo Detstvo' is as impressive visually as it is emotionally.  Tarkovsky knew how to mold a devastatingly real film without overdoing it.The acting is superb all the way around, with a few standouts.  Nikolay Burlyaev is outstanding as young Ivan, capturing this young boys every clouded motive.  Yevgeni Zharikov is also very effective as the young lieutenant unsure of his feelings regarding Ivan's military service.  To me though, the films major standout is Valentin Zubkov.  He manages to make Captain Kholin a beautiful patchwork of human emotions.  His paternal feelings towards Ivan, his loyalty to country that often clouds that paternal affection and his personal desire to leave it all behind for greener pastures are all prevent and brought to the forefront thanks to Zubkov's rich and powerful performance.Clearly one of the best films of the 60's and, quite frankly, one of the best films of all time; `Ivanovo Detstvo' is as timeless as they come and remains a must see for anyone remotely interested in cinema.",5,Poetic and profound; a superb example of artistic achievement...,1240272000,"04 21, 2009",2009,3704,"['Few', 'films', 'are', 'able', 'capture', 'thin', 'line', 'child', 'innocence', 'adult', 'corruption', 'quite', 'like', 'Ivanovo', 'Detstvo', 'rich', 'visual', 'detail', 'carefully', 'established', 'characters', 'Ivanovo', 'Detstvo', 'marvelously', 'crafted', 'film', 'very', 'mature', 'subject', 'delicacy', 'needed', 'carry', 'air', 'child', 'perspective.I', 'just', 'recently', 'few', 'minutes', 'ago', 'reviewed', 'El', 'Espiritu', 'la', 'Colmena', 'Spirit', 'Beehive', 'made', 'comment', 'film', 'one', 'are', 'similar', 'structure', 'meaning', 'published', 'review', 'realized', 'did', ""n't"", 'expound', 'upon', 'as', 'much', 'needed', 'thus', 'wanted', 'write', 'one', 'order', 'do', 'just', 'who', 'have', 'seen', 'films', 'may', 'imidiatly', 'find', 'statement', 'false', 'claiming', 'Ivanovo', 'Detstvo', 'clearly', 'about', 'revenge', 'El', 'Espiritu', 'la', 'Colmena', 'far', 'revenge', 'tale', 'respect', 'are', 'correct', 'statement', 'was', 'not', 'made', 'insinuate', 'What', 'meant', 'comparison', 'was', 'films', 'are', 'child', 'perception', 'adult', 'world', 'El', 'Espiritu', 'la', 'Colmena', 'have', 'young', 'girl', 'trying', 'understand', 'surroundings', 'resorting', 'fairy', 'tale', 'masking', 'order', 'find', 'solace', 'Here', 'have', 'young', 'man', 'who', 'so', 'ravaged', 'violent', 'forced', 'thrust', 'world', ""n't"", 'understand', 'order', 'find', 'sort', 'closure', 'El', 'Espiritu', 'la', 'Colmena', 'contrast', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'prevalent', 'poignant', 'Ivanovo', ""Detstvo'.I"", 'just', 'wanted', 'get', 'off', 'chest.This', 'film', 'tragic', 'story', 'young', 'Ivan', 'twelve-year-old', 'orphan', 'who', 'vowed', 'avenge', 'murdered', 'family', 'working', 'spy', 'German', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'small', 'size', 'controlled', 'demeanor', 'been', 'able', 'cross', 'enemy', 'lines', 'undetected', 'thus', 'been', 'allowed', 'remain', 'front', 'lines', 'age', 'background', 'have', 'caused', 'suggest', 'be', 'taken', 'danger', 'zone', 'placed', 'military', 'school', 'not', 'mesh', 'well', 'Ivan', 'idea', 'vengeance.Famed', 'director', 'Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'made', 'directorial', 'debut', 'full', 'length', 'feature', 'masterpiece', 'set', 'tone', 'future', 'work', 'film', 'littered', 'startling', 'profound', 'imagery', 'make', 'lasting', 'impact', 'speak', 'volumes', 'viewer', 'haunting', 'barren', 'homes', 'well', 'shocking', 'empty', 'nooses', 'guillotines', 'monumental', 'planes', 'protruding', 'sandy', 'shores', 'apples', 'shared', 'joyride', 'beautiful', 'heartwarming', 'suspended', 'kiss', 'ravine', 'carefree', 'run', 'down', 'beach', 'Ivanovo', 'Detstvo', 'impressive', 'visually', 'emotionally', 'Tarkovsky', 'knew', 'how', 'mold', 'devastatingly', 'real', 'film', 'overdoing', 'it.The', 'acting', 'superb', 'way', 'few', 'standouts', 'Nikolay', 'Burlyaev', 'outstanding', 'young', 'Ivan', 'capturing', 'young', 'clouded', 'motive', 'Yevgeni', 'Zharikov', 'also', 'very', 'effective', 'young', 'lieutenant', 'unsure', 'feelings', 'regarding', 'Ivan', 'military', 'service', 'films', 'major', 'standout', 'Valentin', 'Zubkov', 'make', 'Captain', 'Kholin', 'beautiful', 'patchwork', 'human', 'emotions', 'paternal', 'feelings', 'towards', 'Ivan', 'loyalty', 'country', 'often', 'paternal', 'affection', 'personal', 'desire', 'leave', 'greener', 'pastures', 'are', 'prevent', 'brought', 'forefront', 'thanks', 'Zubkov', 'rich', 'powerful', 'performance.Clearly', 'one', 'best', 'films', '60', 'quite', 'frankly', 'one', 'best', 'films', 'time', 'Ivanovo', 'Detstvo', 'as', 'timeless', 'come', 'must', 'see', 'anyone', 'remotely', 'interested', 'cinema']",N/A

297026,A3E7ZFQNJ47XB7,6302120640,Brooser Bear,"[27, 33]","Here is what Tarkovsky said about the picture: I attempted to analyze the condition of a person who is being affected by war. When personality is disintegrating then we have the collapse of the logical development, especially when we are dealing with the personality of a child. I alsways conceptualized Ivan as a destroyed personality pushed by the war from the normal axis of development. A lot, more than a lot, everyhting that was appropriate to Ivan's age was gone from his life, and in its place he was bestowed with evil endowments of the destruction that concentrated within him and seized him.  The film was based on a striking short story titled &quot;Ivan&quot; by an obscure Russian author named Bogomolov, who himself probably was in SMERSH, a Red Army field recon and counter- intelligence during the war as much dreaded as Stalin's NKVD. Tyhe way the way the story waas written, it was probably inspired by true life experiences. Ivan himself could have been invented, or it might have been based on a real life incident, as there were a number of adolescents and pre-adolescents executed by the Nazis and martyred by the communists after the war. The story provides a lot of details into the running of military intelligence agents, the trench warfare and the role of secret police in totalitarian police in teh Red Army during the war. The story takes place in the trenches and gives good detail of the machismo of the Red Army reconnaissance scouts. The story gives a good description of life in a politicized army in a totalitarian country familiar to most older Russians, but not in such detail. None of that background made it on celluloid. The book reads like a personal tragedy for the kid involved, a feeling lost when the story was transferred on film, which was more symbolic.  Here is what makes sense in the book, but is not made significant in the film: The two corpses hanging in the no man's land where the two scouts who were supposed to meet ivan at the Dead Tree who were killed in the ambush, mutilated, and hanged by the germans as a warning. The girl who flirts with the recon lieutenant is from a different story by Bogomolov, where an infantry lieutenant survives a frontal attack on the enemy trenches only to find out that his new fiancee was killed in the rear during the action. The Dead Tree to which Ivan runs in his final dream sequence is the extraction point which he didn't make the last time because of the german patrols. Ivan's surname in the movie in Bondarev, probably play on Bond. Were Bond films out in 1962? In the written story Ivan is a lot more human and is corrupted by the affiliation with elite soldiers and better food rations of an intelligence unit he is with. In the book the kid actually talks down on the exhausted infantry lieutenant who initially detains him. In the book are scenes of his adult friends corrupting him with nice clothes and other trinkets, which never made it into the screenplay, nor were there the scene of his handlers coaxing Ivan to go again behind the German lines when he gets scared. In the story, the narrator is the lowly lieutenant guy who tries the rescue the kid, and then learns of his final fate. In the story, incidentally, the kid is turned in to gestapo by a greedy peasant for a few bucks. All in all, the story is realistic and smacks of human tragedy, while the movie is a lot more symbolic.  The film gets 5 stars though, because the film is one of the best representations of the mark that the War left on the collective Psyche of the people who lived in the Soviet Russia at the time. 1941 was the first year when the ration stamps were repealed and that spring was the first time in the decade perhaps that the people were looking for a summer of relative peace and prosperity, and then the war happened, interrupting graduations and honeymoons, starting another five years of major hardship.

297028,A1OB5L3WMHJAD9,6302120640,Christopher Culver,"[0, 0]","IVAN'S CHILDHOOD, released in 1962, was Soviet director's Andrei Tarkovsky first feature film. An adaptation of a short story by Vladimir Bogomolov set in World War II, its protagonist is a 12 year-old orphan (Nikolai Burlyaev) on the Eastern Front whose small size allows him to scout German positions undetected. Ivan's missions have been useful to the army, but officers Lt. Col. Gryaznov (Nikolai Grinko), Capt. Kholin (Valentin Zubkov) and Lt. Galtsev (Evgeny Zharikov) would like very much to send him to a military academy to get him away from the front, especially as the final offensive against the Germans is imminent.The action in the film plays out between two of Ivan's ventures across the river Dniepr into German-held territory. It depicts the difficult life of the soldiers at the front and the destruction that war brought to the Soviet village whose damaged buildings now host the army. Ivan's back story is revealed elliptically through comments among the soldiers, dream sequences or flashbacks. A subplot involves Kholin's disturbing attempts to seduce Nurse Masha (Valentina Malyavina) and, in stark contrast to earlier Soviet treatments of the war, suggest that in wartime one's own fellow soldiers can just as dangerous as the enemy.As far as Tarkovsky films go, IVAN'S CHILDHOOD is still an immature work. You'll find nothing of the slow, almost ritualistic pacing that marks his later films, and this comes in at a compact 90 minutes. Still, a few shots (tracking shots of a wall, Ivan flipping through a book of religious art) seem like mature Tarkovsky in embryo, and the prominent use of religious iconography (crosses, fresco) is already here. Vadim Yusov's cinematography is memorable, with its several ""layers"" of view in certain shots, and the prominent framing of shots with broken timber beams that seem to hinder the characters. I was however very disappointed that at the end, the film segues into basically a Soviet anti-German propaganda film, complete with archival footage of the Soviet capture of Berlin. It is like some completely different filmmaker took over.The Criterion Collection edition of this film contains several extras. In the 30-minute ""Life as a Dream"", scholar Vida T. Johnson discusses the place of IVAN's CHILDHOOD in Tarkovsky's body of work. This is very informative and Johnson draws viewers' attentions to aspects of the film they may have overlooked.

297029,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,6302120640,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[1, 1]","For every filmmaker, there is the debut of that first film.There are people and film critics that would say that the first film shows hints of what a filmmaker could be.  Some are just bad and the filmmaker tries to distance themselves from it.  Some are so popular that the filmmaker who loathes the popularity switches their style.  And then are those who are able to hit a grand slam and create a masterpiece.For Soviety and Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky (who would go on to directed the films ""Solaris"", ""Andrei Rublev"", ""The Sacrifice"", ""The Mirror""), his debut film from 1962 titled ""Ivan's Childhood"", based on Vladimiri Bogomolov's 1957 short story, would be considered a masterpiece.A film that achieved critically acclaim and the winner of the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival, the film would achieve praise from filmmakers such as Ingmar Bergman, Krzysztof Kieslowski, Sergei Parajanov and a few others.But what made ""Ivan's Childhood"" so significant for its time is that many Russian films were shot of Russian prevailing in war and films that were typically directed by government selected filmmakers.  But as the Khruschev Thaw would take place and giving other filmmakers a chance to create films and boost film productivity in the country, this is where Andrei Tarkovsky would rise to prominence.Along with films such as ""The Cranes are Flying"" and ""Ballad of a Soldier"", films like ""Ivan's Childhood"" would show the human cost of war and the pain and emotional suffering one encounters.But much different is Andrei Tarkovsky's complexity when it came to his characters which he takes them from dreamlike worlds to devastating reality but also touted for its intelligence, storytelling and cinematography. In the case of ""Ivan's Childhood"", it was a film focused on one young boy's ravaged youth.The film became one of Tarkovsky's most commercially successful film, selling over 16.7 million tickets in the Soviet Union.  The film would showcase the collaboration between Tarkovsky and cinematographer Vadim Yusov, a collaboration which first began with Tarkovsky's diploma film ""The Steamroller and the Violin"" in 1961.  But the film would show the visual strengths of their collaboration for cinema.VIDEO:""Ivan's Childhood"" is presented in black and white and 1080p High Definition (1:33: aspect ratio).  Having watched the 2007 Criterion Collection DVD, back then you thought what Criterion Collection accomplished was the best picture quality at the time.  Prior to watching this Blu-ray, I expected contrast for the whites and grays to be fantastic (which they are) and much better detail (which they also are).  But it's this 4K digital transfer that really brings out the richness of the overall look of the film.It's really hard to use the word pristine for a film of this age, but it is.  The Criterion Collection has cleaned up this film to the point that there is no blemishes, the cinematography by Vadim Yusov looks better than ever and this is the best I have seen of this film by far.According to the Criterion Collection, this high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit 4K from a 35 mm fine-grain master positive.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, and jitter were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image Systems' Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain, noise reduction and flicker.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Ivan's Childhood"" is presented in Russian LPCM 1.0 monaural with optional English subtitles.  Overall, lossless audio for this monaural track is crisp and clear and I did not hear any problematic issues during my viewing of this film.According to the Criterion Collection, the original monaural soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from a 35 mm optical soundtrack print.

Plus discussion of the visual language, preparations, dreams and texture of ""Ivan's Childhood"".EXTRAS:""Ivan's Childhood - The Criterion Collection #397"" comes with an 30-page booklet with the following essay, ""Dream Come True"" by Dina Jordanova and ""Between Two Films"" by Andrei Tarkovsky.JUDGMENT CALL:As a person who enjoys Andrei Tarkovsky films, ""Ivan's Childhood"" is a film that is brilliant.First and foremost, it's one thing to have a wonderful collaboration with a cinematographer who captures what you want and for Tarkovsky and Vadim Yusov, the two have wonderful chemistry when it comes to making a film.But for ""Ivan's Childhood"", the film literally rests on the shoulders of young talent Nikolay Burlyaev.  This is a film that must capture a boy that has been changed to tragedy and war.  He has seen many deaths and his thirst of revenge has hardened his resolve to achieve nothing but revenge against the Germans.  Instead of being safe and attending a school, he chooses to be on the front lines.  May it be to help the Soviet Army with intelligence or joining the Partisans and fighting the Germans, even if it means that he will die.But it's the way that Tarkovsky captures Ivan through the film.  From dreams of a wonderful time with family, with the trees using a reversed negative and riding with his dead sister in a truck bed full of apples to the serene beach to where horses can feast on the dropped apples and then having him wake up to a miserable land where buildings have been destroyed, there is nothing but trunks of trees, swamp land with an occasional partisan hung as a warning to those who defy the Germans.While watching this film, it did make me think of Roberto Rossellini's ""Germany Year Zero"" (1948) about a boy who tries to survive in obliterated Berlin.  But as that film was a daring look at the consequences of fascism and society to an individual, ""Ivan's Childhood"" was a film about a 12-year-old who has been tempered by death.  This is a boy who has suffered unbelievable psychological trauma.No one knows the true extent of how bad life has been for Ivan but the fact that he has keen awareness of death camps such as the Maly Trostenets, a Nazi death camp to house Soviet prisoners of war and a camp where over 206,000 people were murdered.This is a boy who saw unbelievable tragedy, who had daily nightmares of his family being executed and a boy who lived with nothing, alone, dirty and trying to survive anyway he can.  His only link to life is through the Soviet soldiers he is helping.  But when they want him to be safe and put him to military school, Ivan finds this to be a slap in the face to a boy who wants nothing but revenge against the Germans for what they did to his family.What is amazing is the imagery of the film, the way that characters are positioned artistically.  For one image, Ivan is seen as broken timber beams are pointing towards him.  Another scene in a dream where his mother and him are looking inside a well and he drops a feather, as she explains to him about how they can see twinkling of stars in the water.While the film does provide a love triangle storyline (which Tarkovsky did not want but the government/producers had him include it), the love triangle probably doesn't mean so much to the film, but more or less of establishing the characters of Capt. Kholin and Lt. Galtsev.Lt. Galsev may be a young leader but it's his growing distaste of Capt. Kholin who is a man that has been told by his superiors, that he needs to grow up.  While Yevgeni Zharikov may look a bit young to play a Lt., it probably is plausible during the war as many soldiers were killed or were held captive for Germans.  But these two along with Masha, provide an interesting break from Ivan, especially during a scene in which Capt. Kholin takes Masha to the woods.  All you see are trunks of trees and him trying to take advantage of Masha, while Lt. Galsev runs to look for her and make sure Capt. Kholin does not get close to her.But in the end, it's the acting of the young Nikolay Burlyaev that makes this film work.  His acting as a child was fantastic and he is able to make the film more compelling but absolutely heartbreaking, when you learn more about his past.  It's one thing to show action, but this young actor is able to show pain just from his eyes alone.As for the Blu-ray release, having owned the 2007 Criterion Collection DVD release, picture quality alone, the Blu-ray is fantastic.  A wonderful 4K digital transfer, the contrast of the blacks and whites are fantastic and the detail seen on the Blu-ray is impressive.  Lossless audio of the monaural soundtrack is crisp and both picture and audio quality is pristine without any errors that can be seen or heard.  While I wish there were more special features, including a commentary, it's still a Blu-ray that is worth owning and for previous DVD owners, worth upgrading to.Overall, there are not many filmmakers who are able to hit a grand slam for their first film.  But Andrei Tarkovsky is one to achieve it.  Cnsidering that ""Ivan's Childhood"" was a film that tend to change overtime during production for Andrei Tarkovsky, its the complexity of the characters, the stunning visuals of the cinematography courtesy of Vadim Yusov and the wonderful acting of young Nikolay Burlyaev that makes ""Ivan's Childhood"" a work of art.Highly recommended!",5,There are not many filmmakers who are able to hit a grand slam for their first film.

297030,A283JVPUGXOFAZ,6302120640,Ermite,"[21, 22]","This is a DVD to own.  ""Ivan's Childhood"" is Tarkovsky's first and arguably his most famous film.  Based on Vladimir Bogomolov's early novella, ""Ivan"" (that is, ""John"") (1957), the film achieved wide acclaim outside Russia.  It was produced at the risky time when Premier Khrushchev's era was ending and fundamentalist Marxists were ascendant again, restricting freedom in the arts; it is, as one observer wrote, ""one of the harshest, morally complex versions of the war in Soviet film.""  It won the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival.  With this debut film, Tarkovsky established an international reputation that has influenced many other filmmakers.Except for this novella, Bogomolov is not widely known outside Russia.  However, it was translated and anthologized widely around the world.  Look for Bernard Isaac's translation into British English.  It has the atmosphere of reality. It is punctuated it with references to real places, the Dnieper River, the town Gomel, where Ivan was born, and the Trostyanets death camp; even official Red Army and SS documents have an authentic flavor.The novella is told in the first person narrative of a Red Army lieutenant.  Ivan is about 12 and a ""scout"", or reconnaissance spy, sneaking across the swampy Dnieper River into the night and behind German lines.  The war made him an orphan and filled him with maddening hatred and desperation for revenge.  He has been with partisans, in a death camp, and wounded by friendly fire returning from a mission one night.  The soldiers are amazed he's been through so much.There is the pun, of course: Ivan's last name is Bondarev, Ivan Bondarev, that is, John Bond.  In the story, it's an intelligence cover name.  However, Ian Flemming's first James Bond novels appeared in the early fifties before ""Ivan"" was published.  It may be coincidental, and probably only of interest to Western readers.Writers often insert their own lives and experiences into their writings, and Bogomolov served in the Red Army in World War II and in intelligence.  I do not know if Bogomolov based Ivan on any real person that he may have met or learned about.  I guess we can only speculate about Ivan, yet a child working as a war-time spy seems plausible to me.  After all, in the desperate chaos at the close of the war, Germany mobilized the Hitler Youth and insurgent units called Werewolves. There is plenty of historical evidence pointing to child combatants throughout history as well as in current events.  We recall that Baden-Powell, who created the Boy Scouts, was a former soldier and spy, and the crafts of scouting are important reconnoitering skills used in war.  The world is as morally conflicted as ever.Though he argued with Tarkovsky about the way his story was filmed, like all authors, I think Tarkovsky's approach was correct, considering the demands and possibilities of the cinemagraphic medium.  This Criterion Edition of the film is cleaned up with a high definition digital transfer.  There is a new subtitle translation.  The highlight of the features is the interview with Nicholai (Kolya) Burlyaev, who portrayed Ivan.  He reminisces how he was cast at 14 and how the film was made.The film follows the novella closely, though it takes a more objective viewpoint and enters Ivan's troubled dreams, which make striking imagery.  It is tragic poetry whereas the novella is matter-of-fact.  Here, Ivan is somewhat bratty and hot tempered.  Though he is a child scout, I think the film suggests that he may not be the only one.  He knows his trade-craft and takes it very seriously.  Still, no one seems overly concerned (in either film or story) that a child is a war-time spy.  Frankly, he insists on doing it.  Ivan's only friends are the soldiers who want to care for him (after the war)or send him to school but do not object to his missions.The film, shot on location at the Dnieper River, is pregnant with dramatic, almost heavy-handed imagery and symbolism.  There is the first metaphor of crossing the river.  Then there is the metaphor of the dead tree.  It's his extraction point where Sgt. Katasonov waits for him to bring him ashore to safety.  But, Ivan misses the rendezvous because of German patrols and must swim further away.  Here, one metaphor abuts another.  At the end, following Ivan's last mission, Tarkovsky re-introduces the dead tree metaphor as Ivan races laughing on a beach, perhaps in whatever kind of dream that may have come for him.  There are other interpretations, and this one satisfies me now.  At the end of the day, we have Bogomolov's poignant story enhanced by Tarkovsky's uncompromising, haunting vision.",5,Death Wish,1189728000,"09 14, 2007",2007,4656,"['DVD', 'own', 'Ivan', 'Childhood', 'Tarkovsky', 'first', 'arguably', 'most', 'famous', 'film', 'Based', 'Vladimir', 'Bogomolov', 'early', 'novella', 'Ivan', 'John', '1957', 'film', 'achieved', 'wide', 'acclaim', 'Russia', 'was', 'produced', 'risky', 'time', 'when', 'Premier', 'Khrushchev', 'era', 'was', 'ending', 'fundamentalist', 'Marxists', 'were', 'ascendant', 'again', 'restricting', 'freedom', 'arts', 'one', 'wrote', 'one', 'harshest', 'morally', 'complex', 'versions', 'war', 'Soviet', 'film', 'won', 'Golden', 'Lion', 'award', 'Venice', 'Film', 'Festival', 'debut', 'film', 'Tarkovsky', 'established', 'international', 'reputation', 'influenced', 'many', 'other', 'filmmakers.Except', 'novella', 'Bogomolov', 'not', 'widely', 'known', 'outside', 'Russia', 'However', 'was', 'translated', 'anthologized', 'widely', 'world', 'Look', 'Bernard', 'Isaac', 'translation', 'British', 'English', 'atmosphere', 'reality', 'punctuated', 'references', 'real', 'places', 'Dnieper', 'River', 'town', 'Gomel', 'where', 'Ivan', 'was', 'born', 'Trostyanets', 'death', 'camp', 'even', 'official', 'Red', 'Army', 'SS', 'documents', 'have', 'authentic', 'flavor.The', 'novella', 'told', 'first', 'person', 'narrative', 'Red', 'Army', 'lieutenant', 'Ivan', '12', 'scout', 'reconnaissance', 'spy', 'sneaking', 'swampy', 'Dnieper', 'River', 'night', 'behind', 'German', 'lines', 'war', 'made', 'orphan', 'filled', 'maddening', 'hatred', 'desperation', 'revenge', 'been', 'partisans', 'death', 'camp', 'wounded', 'friendly', 'fire', 'returning', 'mission', 'one', 'night', 'soldiers', 'are', 'amazed', 'been', 'so', 'pun', 'course', 'Ivan', 'last', 'name', 'Bondarev', 'Ivan', 'Bondarev', 'John', 'Bond', 'story', 'intelligence', 'cover', 'name', 'However', 'Ian', 'Flemming', 'first', 'James', 'Bond', 'novels', 'appeared', 'early', 'fifties', 'Ivan', 'was', 'published', 'may', 'be', 'coincidental', 'probably', 'only', 'interest', 'Western', 'readers.Writers', 'often', 'insert', 'own', 'lives', 'experiences', 'writings', 'Bogomolov', 'served', 'Red', 'Army', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'intelligence', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'Bogomolov', 'based', 'Ivan', 'real', 'person', 'may', 'have', 'met', 'learned', 'guess', 'can', 'only', 'speculate', 'Ivan', 'yet', 'child', 'working', 'war-time', 'spy', 'plausible', 'desperate', 'chaos', 'close', 'war', 'Germany', 'mobilized', 'Hitler', 'Youth', 'insurgent', 'units', 'called', 'Werewolves', 'plenty', 'historical', 'evidence', 'pointing', 'child', 'combatants', 'history', 'as', 'well', 'current', 'events', 'recall', 'Baden-Powell', 'who', 'created', 'Boy', 'Scouts', 'was', 'former', 'soldier', 'spy', 'crafts', 'scouting', 'are', 'important', 'reconnoitering', 'skills', 'used', 'war', 'world', 'morally', 'conflicted', 'argued', 'Tarkovsky', 'way', 'story', 'was', 'filmed', 'authors', 'think', 'Tarkovsky', 'approach', 'was', 'correct', 'considering', 'demands', 'possibilities', 'cinemagraphic', 'medium', 'Criterion', 'Edition', 'film', 'cleaned', 'up', 'high', 'definition', 'digital', 'transfer', 'new', 'subtitle', 'translation', 'highlight', 'features', 'interview', 'Nicholai', 'Kolya', 'Burlyaev', 'who', 'portrayed', 'Ivan', 'how', 'was', 'cast', '14', 'how', 'film', 'was', 'made.The', 'film', 'novella', 'closely', 'more', 'objective', 'viewpoint', 'enters', 'Ivan', 'troubled', 'dreams', 'make', 'striking', 'imagery', 'tragic', 'poetry', 'whereas', 'novella', 'matter-of-fact', 'Here', 'Ivan', 'somewhat', 'bratty', 'hot', 'tempered', 'child', 'scout', 'think', 'film', 'may', 'not', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'trade-craft', 'very', 'seriously', 'Still', 'one', 'overly', 'concerned', 'film', 'story', 'child', 'war-time', 'spy', 'Frankly', 'doing', 'Ivan', 'only', 'friends', 'are', 'soldiers', 'who', 'want', 'care', 'war', 'send', 'school', 'do', 'not', 'object', 'missions.The', 'film', 'shot', 'location', 'Dnieper', 'River', 'pregnant', 'dramatic', 'almost', 'heavy-handed', 'imagery', 'symbolism', 'first', 'metaphor', 'crossing', 'river', 'Then', 'metaphor', 'dead', 'tree', 'extraction', 'point', 'where', 'Sgt', 'Katasonov', 'waits', 'bring', 'ashore', 'safety', 'Ivan', 'rendezvous', 'German', 'patrols', 'must', 'swim', 'further', 'away', 'Here', 'one', 'metaphor', 'end', 'following', 'Ivan', 'last', 'mission', 'Tarkovsky', 'dead', 'tree', 'metaphor', 'Ivan', 'laughing', 'beach', 'perhaps', 'kind', 'dream', 'may', 'have', 'come', 'are', 'other', 'interpretations', 'one', 'now', 'end', 'day', 'have', 'Bogomolov', 'poignant', 'story', 'enhanced', 'Tarkovsky', 'uncompromising', 'haunting', 'vision']",N/A
297031,A2UYAFQ40U2PHS,6302120640,"Grigory's Girl ""GR""","[24, 30]","This is Andrei Tarkovsky's first feature film, and it's wonderful.  It doesn't have the epic feel of grandeur and astonishment of his later work, and it's quite conventional compared to the mystery and ambiguity of films like Solaris and Stalker, but it's still very good and has to be seen by anyone who loves Tarkovsky, Russian cinema, and cinema in general.  The film was not actually instigated by Tarkovsky himself.  The original director had quit/got fired, and the production was going to be shut down.

Ivan's Childhood can be read literally, as it seems most critics have, or more abstractly as I think Tarkovsky approached his subject.The film opens and closes by a minimalistic lakeshore, but the scenes that dominate this film are those of young Ivan serving as a reconnaissance agent behind German lines during WWII.  Thanks to his thin 12-year old body, he can go deeper into enemy lines than can his comrades.  This is news to a young lieutenant who can hardly believe Ivan works as an agent, only to find out through a chain of command that Vanya is indeed who he says he is and to treat him well.Tarkovsky treads a fine line between a standard espionage thriller, not much unlike those you would see in the West during this time, and an expressionist piece of work that dovetails dream sequences of Ivan's childhood into the main action.  The question becomes which is real and which is imagined, as the scenes seamlessly flow into each other through young Ivan.  The well appears to evoke the deep hole Alice fell into, with the war time scenes looming underground.  This is a remarkable debut feature film for the young director.  His only previous film was a short adaptation of Hemingway's The Killers.  It is obvious that he wanted to go beyond the war genre, as he would in later works, leaving the viewer to ponder over Ivan's fate.Criterion offers a beautifully restored version of the film along with a few extras to help fill you in on the details.",4,Don't read this film too literally,1284422400,"09 14, 2010",2010,1675,"['late', '50s', 'early', '60s', 'war', 'genre', 'dominated', 'Soviet', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'stop', 'directors', 'Kalatozov', 'Tarkovsky', 're-imagining', 'genre', 'coming', 'up', 'very', 'expressionist', 'pieces', 'work', 'Ivan', 'Childhood', 'can', 'be', 'read', 'literally', 'most', 'critics', 'have', 'more', 'abstractly', 'think', 'Tarkovsky', 'approached', 'subject.The', 'film', 'opens', 'closes', 'minimalistic', 'lakeshore', 'scenes', 'dominate', 'film', 'are', 'young', 'Ivan', 'serving', 'reconnaissance', 'agent', 'German', 'lines', 'WWII', 'Thanks', 'thin', '12-year', 'old', 'body', 'can', 'go', 'deeper', 'enemy', 'lines', 'can', 'comrades', 'news', 'young', 'lieutenant', 'who', 'can', 'hardly', 'believe', 'Ivan', 'agent', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'chain', 'command', 'Vanya', 'indeed', 'who', 'treat', 'well.Tarkovsky', 'fine', 'line', 'standard', 'espionage', 'thriller', 'not', 'much', 'would', 'see', 'West', 'time', 'expressionist', 'piece', 'work', 'dream', 'sequences', 'Ivan', 'childhood', 'main', 'action', 'question', 'real', 'imagined', 'scenes', 'seamlessly', 'flow', 'other', 'young', 'Ivan', 'well', 'evoke', 'deep', 'hole', 'Alice', 'fell', 'war', 'time', 'scenes', 'looming', 'underground', 'remarkable', 'debut', 'feature', 'film', 'young', 'director', 'only', 'previous', 'film', 'was', 'short', 'adaptation', 'Hemingway', 'Killers', 'obvious', 'wanted', 'go', 'war', 'genre', 'would', 'later', 'works', 'leaving', 'viewer', 'ponder', 'Ivan', 'fate.Criterion', 'beautifully', 'restored', 'version', 'film', 'few', 'extras', 'help', 'fill', 'details']",N/A

He begins to levitate above the forest, rejoins his mother (Irma Raush Tarkovskaya), and begins to share his discovery. Then the peaceful reunion between mother and son is truncated by Ivan's rude awakening to the sound of mortar firing. Suddenly, it is evening, and a hungry, weary Ivan awakens in the attic of an empty windmill. Like the opening scene of Andrei Rublev, the surreal episode proves to be an intangible dream. Resuming his reconnaissance mission, Ivan then crosses a treacherous swamp amidst enemy fire. Unable to rendezvous with his contact, Corporal Katasonych (Stepan Krylov), Ivan arrives at an alternate Russian bunker, where his credentials are immediately questioned by the ranking officer, Lieutenant Galtsev (Yevgeni Zharikov). Despite his skepticism, Galtsev calls Ivan's superior, Colonel Gryaznov (Nikolai Grinko), who confirms his identity, dispatches Captain Kholin (Valentin Zubkov) to bring him back to headquarters. Gryaznov has taken an interest in the welfare of the young orphan, and has decided to enroll him in a military academy, reasoning that war has no place for children. Ivan refuses to leave, and argues that his age and stealth make him an ideal scout for their missions. Unable to persuade his superiors, Ivan runs away from the barracks, only to find a ravaged, desolate wasteland outside its walls. With nowhere left to turn, he returns with his superiors back to camp. However, despite the officers' reluctance, Ivan is enlisted for a final mission as they prepare for another covert operation.Andrei Tarkovsky presents an austere, bleak and haunting portrait of lost innocence in Ivan's Childhood. Tarkovsky uses sharp, contrasting scenes of light and darkness to visually delineate between the idealization of a normal life and its seeming elusiveness in the hopelessness of war: the brightness of the sunshine during Ivan's dream sequences and Kholin's courtship of the nurse, Masha (Valentina Malyavina) at a birch forest provide a jarring transition from the dark trenches, murky swamps, and poorly lit barracks of the battlefield. Nevertheless, within the daylight sequences, Tarkovsky continues to reinforce a pervasive sense of entrapment and helplessness: the spider web on the opening shot; Ivan bathing in the well; Kholin's stolen kiss from Masha while straddling a trench. What emerges is an ominous and incongruent coexistence of nature and frontiers, humanity and cruelty, youth and nihilism - a reflection of the austere and unnatural landscape of war.",4,"My least favorite Tarkovsky, but still a highly emotional experience",1262736000,"01 6, 2010",2010,2637,"['idyllic', 'summer', 'day', '12', 'year', 'old', 'boy', 'named', 'Ivan', 'Nikolai', 'Burlyayev', 'ventures', 'woods', 'spots', 'cuckoo', 'levitate', 'forest', 'mother', 'Irma', 'Raush', 'Tarkovskaya', 'share', 'discovery', 'Then', 'peaceful', 'reunion', 'mother', 'son', 'truncated', 'Ivan', 'rude', 'awakening', 'sound', 'mortar', 'firing', 'Suddenly', 'evening', 'hungry', 'weary', 'Ivan', 'awakens', 'attic', 'empty', 'windmill', 'opening', 'scene', 'Andrei', 'Rublev', 'surreal', 'episode', 'be', 'intangible', 'dream', 'Resuming', 'reconnaissance', 'mission', 'Ivan', 'then', 'treacherous', 'swamp', 'amidst', 'enemy', 'fire', 'Unable', 'rendezvous', 'contact', 'Corporal', 'Katasonych', 'Stepan', 'Krylov', 'Ivan', 'alternate', 'Russian', 'bunker', 'where', 'credentials', 'are', 'immediately', 'questioned', 'ranking', 'officer', 'Lieutenant', 'Galtsev', 'Yevgeni', 'Zharikov', 'skepticism', 'Galtsev', 'Ivan', 'superior', 'Colonel', 'Gryaznov', 'Nikolai', 'Grinko', 'who', 'identity', 'dispatches', 'Captain', 'Kholin', 'Valentin', 'Zubkov', 'bring', 'back', 'headquarters', 'Gryaznov', 'taken', 'interest', 'welfare', 'young', 'orphan', 'decided', 'enroll', 'military', 'academy', 'reasoning', 'war', 'place', 'children', 'Ivan', 'leave', 'age', 'stealth', 'make', 'ideal', 'scout', 'missions', 'Unable', 'persuade', 'superiors', 'Ivan', 'away', 'barracks', 'only', 'find', 'ravaged', 'desolate', 'wasteland', 'walls', 'nowhere', 'left', 'turn', 'superiors', 'back', 'camp', 'However', 'officers', 'reluctance', 'Ivan', 'enlisted', 'final', 'mission', 'prepare', 'covert', 'operation.Andrei', 'Tarkovsky', 'austere', 'bleak', 'haunting', 'portrait', 'lost', 'innocence', 'Ivan', 'Childhood', 'Tarkovsky', 'sharp', 'contrasting', 'scenes', 'light', 'darkness', 'visually', 'delineate', 'idealization', 'normal', 'life', 'seeming', 'elusiveness', 'hopelessness', 'war', 'brightness', 'sunshine', 'Ivan', 'dream', 'sequences', 'Kholin', 'courtship', 'nurse', 'Masha', 'Valentina', 'Malyavina', 'birch', 'forest', 'provide', 'jarring', 'transition', 'dark', 'trenches', 'murky', 'swamps', 'poorly', 'lit', 'barracks', 'battlefield', 'Nevertheless', 'daylight', 'sequences', 'Tarkovsky', 'reinforce', 'pervasive', 'sense', 'entrapment', 'helplessness', 'spider', 'web', 'opening', 'shot', 'Ivan', 'bathing', 'well', 'Kholin', 'stolen', 'kiss', 'Masha', 'straddling', 'trench', 'What', 'ominous', 'incongruent', 'coexistence', 'nature', 'frontiers', 'humanity', 'cruelty', 'youth', 'nihilism', 'reflection', 'austere', 'unnatural', 'landscape', 'war']",N/A

He certainly did.  It is a masterful film, shot in richly textured black and white, and Criterion's transfer is stunningly crisp and nuanced.  Tarkovsky's innovations here can be seen in his approach to memory and dreams, his affinity for the elements of water and earth and fire, the sense of longing for a lost innocence that drives Ivan.  At the same time, in many ways this film fits neatly into the period in Russia, during which a new openness to Western culture allowed young Russian filmmakers to innovate and explore new styles of film making, and also to bring a greater degree of realism to subject matters such as war.  While the film is not critical of Russian conduct during World War II, it depicts clearly the horrors of war through its impact on a child, who should be experiencing childhood but is instead forced by circumstance, desperation and force of will to expose himself to danger.  What is so touching about the film is the way the hardened young Ivan, who refuses to be coddled, nevertheless embraces and kisses the neck of his commanding officer, the closest thing he has to a father, and the next moment refuses to be sent to a school and threatens to run away as would a child.

297041,A2AREUQXKG7PCG,6302120640,Snow Leopard,"[4, 4]","This film marks the debut of what was to become one of filmmaking's greatest directors, Andrei Tarkovsky.  While he had already directed ""The Steamroller & the Violin"" as part of his graduation from film studies, this was his first foray into a full-length film.What other reviewers do not note about this film is the interesting angle it presents on the theme of war. The movie's namesake, Ivan (a name selected to generically mean any Russian boy), is not simply an innocent who suffers the horrors of war, but is an aggressive, generally confident and committed scout, dedicated to eradicting the German presence in his beloved Russia.  After some idyllic opening shots, we see the 12-year-old Ivan ordering around the military man he is put in the care of. The scene is distinctively striking, as is the subsequent narrative arc that traces Ivan's involvement as a scout along the front.  If you are familiar with another excellent Russian war film centered around a young man, ""Come and See"" (by Elem Klimov), then you will certainly recognize some of the roots of that movie in this one.In general, this is one of the most narrative-driven of Tarkovsky's movies. Later in his career, he seems to have raised the technique of making content match style to the highest pitch; here, the story is clearly dominating how he films his scenes, sometimes experimentally rotating the camera, utilizing defamiliarizing angles, and running alongside actors during tracking shots.  One very notable difference from his later films is the speed of many shots. Here, Tarkovsky tends to opt either for a still camera in static scenes, or to quickly moving shots. There is very little of the excruciatingly slow ballet or creep-pans that mark his later work. This is not a merit or defect of ""Ivan's Chilldhood,"" necessarily, but one can certainly sense a younger director exploring the possibilities of technique in this film in a way that his other films do not reflect.It is interesting to note what one reviewer points out below, that Tarkovsky was not the original director for this film.  It would be interesting to know if any footage from the original director is retained in the finished version. Visually, one might make a case for this considering how starkly different the filming is between Ivan's pre-War and during-War childhood are. The colors, the lighting, even to the point of looking colorized and somewhat artificial, make a very vivid contrast with the plain, stark black and white of the military encampment's interiors, or the gorgeous austerity of the birch trees. All the same, the contrast could still simply be Tarkovsky pointing out the differences of pre-War, and post-War childhood.Throughout, there are numerous striking shots (the falling bucket, reverse shots filmed in water, the filming in the birch trees, a severe up angle on Ivan as he walks, and especially the particularly compelling final crane shot, where Ivan overtakes his sister and runs along the edge of the ocean), the acting is excellent, and the story is striking enough that it still deserves to be heard.This is not Tarkovsky's ""Mirror"" or ""Stalker"" (both of which I cannot recommend enough), but neither should it be.  Serious film viewers should certainly be familiar with all of Tarkovsky's work, and it would no doubt be interesting to start here, with his first film.

But one perceived drawback of the bulk of these films for the casual viewer is that they may seem too long (most cross a 150 min running time) and languorously paced. However Ivan's Childhood, his first film, is a rather brisk and involving film about a child who wants to dedicate his life to fighting the Nazis and carries out dangerous spying missions for the Russian army, defiantly refusing to go back to civilian life till the war is over. His obsession is the result of his family having been killed during the war, and the title refers to a childhood that is lost on account of that.Tarkovsky's great eye for memorable visuals is quite evident here, and this movie is a lot more accessible than some of his later magnum opuses. Highly recommended to movie buffs as a fantastic introduction to this great director.Criterion's blu-ray gives an expectedly amazing presentation of this film, with wonderful contrast, terrific sharpness and detail (considering the age of the film) and a filmic look.

It's a simple tale extraordinarily well told, and if the sudden leap in chronology at the end is jarring, the result is nonetheless very moving. Even the fantasy/memory scenes of a nature more vivid that the burnt out husk or swamps of war are beautifully handled, and it's easy to see this being a major influence on Spielberg's most underrated film, Empire of the Sun.Very impressive indeed, it's a surprise to learn that the film was shot on an ultra-low budget because another director and cast had used up half the budget before their version was scrubbed, only for Kruschev's disapproval to limit the film's Russian release while it was conquering the arthouses worldwide.Criterion's DVD includes good interviews with star Nikolai Burlyaev and cinematographer Vadim Yusov but doesn't include the Russian WW2 newsreel footage on the Russico/Artificial Eye PAL DVD.",4,Children of war,1187827200,"08 23, 2007",2007,1192,"['Ivan', 'Childhood', 'often', 'fluidity', 'camerawork', 'wonderful', 'use', 'sound', 'matter', 'fact', 'depiction', 'war', 'not', 'moments', 'combat', 'make', 'up', 'only', 'tiny', 'part', 'experience', 'moments', 'where', 'people', 'try', 'catch', 'can', 'be', 'love', 'hope', 'memories', 'just', 'sleep', 'simple', 'tale', 'extraordinarily', 'well', 'told', 'sudden', 'leap', 'chronology', 'end', 'jarring', 'result', 'nonetheless', 'very', 'moving', 'Even', 'fantasy/memory', 'scenes', 'nature', 'more', 'vivid', 'burnt', 'out', 'husk', 'swamps', 'war', 'are', 'beautifully', 'handled', 'easy', 'see', 'being', 'major', 'influence', 'Spielberg', 'most', 'underrated', 'film', 'Empire', 'Sun.Very', 'impressive', 'indeed', 'surprise', 'learn', 'film', 'was', 'shot', 'ultra-low', 'budget', 'director', 'cast', 'had', 'used', 'up', 'budget', 'version', 'was', 'scrubbed', 'only', 'Kruschev', 'disapproval', 'limit', 'film', 'Russian', 'release', 'was', 'conquering', 'arthouses', 'worldwide.Criterion', 'DVD', 'good', 'interviews', 'star', 'Nikolai', 'Burlyaev', 'cinematographer', 'Vadim', 'Yusov', ""n't"", 'include', 'Russian', 'WW2', 'newsreel', 'footage', 'Russico/Artificial', 'Eye', 'PAL', 'DVD']",N/A
297047,A18GP1PWVTKXQQ,6302120640,Turfseer,"[0, 0]","*** This review may contain spoilers ***Rating: 2.5 out of 5.0'Ivan's Childhood' is also known as 'My Name is Ivan' in the United States. It was the first feature film of the famed Soviet director, Andrei Tarkovsky, who took over the project from another young director after it was rejected for ""poor quality."" Tarkovsky based the film on a short story by Vladimir Bogomolov, a very successful writer during the Soviet era. Supposedly, Bogomolov drew upon his experiences as a soldier in World War II but according to Wikipedia, some journalists believe that he never fought in the war and all his writings constitute a hoax!Tarkovsky immediately established a big reputation when he won awards at the Venice Film Festival as well as the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1962. Even Ingmar Bergman was quoted as saying that ""My discovery of Tarkovsky's first film was like a miracle. Suddenly, I found myself standing at the door of a room the keys of which had, until then, never been given to me. It was a room I had always wanted to enter and where he was moving freely and fully at ease."" Not everyone was completely effusive about 'Ivan'. The NY Times critic at the time, Bosley Crowther stated, ""The one exception I take to this picture, which is based on a short story by Vladimir Bogpmolov, is that its structure is a bit too frail. Its emotional communication is too dependent on its impressionistic details.""Indeed, it's the assorted palate of individual visual scenes that have drawn viewers to this film time and again. A good number stick in your mind (here are just a few): flashbacks of Ivan's mother and her subsequent demise; the dead soldiers on the other side of the river with the sign 'welcome'; Ivan being carried to bed by one of his soldier-protectors; the horses eating the apples; the soldier holding the nurse over the ravine; the graffiti of doomed partisans urging future viewers to ""take revenge""; and the striking cinematography filmed on location in the marshlands near Kaniv at the Dnieper River.Despite all these great visuals, the film still doesn't work very well due to the weak script. Since the carnage of war is only suggested (which was obviously intentional on Tarkovsky's part not to show any overt clashes between Germans and Russians), he was forced to fall back on the conflict between the Soviet soldiers and their 12 year old charge, the jaded Ivan. Tarkovsky relies on the main conflict in which Ivan insists on continuing his activities as a scout as opposed to the Russian commanders, who insist that he be taken from the front lines and placed in military school. This tedious battle goes on for much too long until two soldiers, Kholin and Galtsev, who have befriended Ivan, decide to ferry him across the river and allow him safe passage into the forest, where he'll continue acting as a child soldier (Kholin and Galtsev meanwhile retrieve their two dead comrades under the tree).There's also a sub-plot that seems to go nowhere. Captain Kholin makes some aggressive moves on the Army Nurse Masha in the forest; you would figure that this might end up as some kind of sexual assault but nothing like that happens. The scene is probably there because simply focusing exclusively on the inert conflict between Ivan and the soldiers, cannot carry the entire narrative.The Ivan denouement is interesting because Tarkovsky uses archival footage from the Fall of Berlin. There are some disturbing images, particularly shots of the Goebbels' children, who were poisoned by their parents in Hitler's bunker days before Germany's official surrender. He uses this footage to work in a scene where one of Ivan's soldier friend discovers the boy's ultimate fate (executed by the Nazis, by beheading!).Ultimately, the message of a poor 12 year old orphan caught up in the horrors of war fails to have the shattering impact that most critics insist that it does. I can only surmise that many of these critics were so impressed by the dazzling virtuosity of a first time feature director's extraordinary visual competency, that any objective observations concerning plot, were lost. But there's simply not enough compelling conflict to keep this anti-war vehicle completely afloat. What's more, I understand the whole idea that Ivan's misguided thirst for revenge illustrates how war can affect an innocent child, in such a deleterious way. And of course his ultimate fate, is supposed to be quite tragic. But somehow I felt emotionally detached from Ivan probably because of the child's own detachment from reality. Tarkovsky's impressive impressionistic techniques at the same time leads to an emotional distancing. We see the dreamlike shot of Ivan's mother after she's killed but we never get to know who she is. Likewise her executioners. All we're left with is the emotionally detached Ivan and his enablers--again not a big enough canvas for compelling drama.You might be interested in the fate of the actor who played Ivan-- Nikolay Burlyaev. Actually he's done quite well for himself: Since 1991, the founder and director of the Moscow Film Festival of Slavic and Orthodox Peoples and since 1996, founder and chairman of the International Association of Cinematographers of Slavic and Orthodox Peoples. One disturbing caveat according to Wikipedia: ""In March 2014 he signed a letter in support of the position of the President of Russia Vladimir Putin on Russia's military intervention in Ukraine.""",2,First time feature director's dazzling visual competency subsumed by weak script,1400889600,"05 24, 2014",2014,5459,"['***', 'review', 'may', 'contain', 'spoilers', '***Rating', '2.5',
