1281752,A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B002OOWLIY,Kasey G,"[10, 10]","In April 2007, Sony brought us the long-awaited debut of ""One Day a Time"" on DVD.This abbreviated season originally ran on CBS during 1975-76 and became an instant hit, with Bonnie Franklin's portrayal of Ann Romano being notable as prime time's first divorced leading lady (actually Lee Grant in ""Fay"" preceded her by a few months, but that show was quickly cancelled and erased from most viewer's memories). I was afraid that I would find Richard Masur's character annoying and he would taint my enjoyment of Season 1, but he was much better than I remember and these episodes went down smooth as ice cream and left me wanting more.When I think of ODAAT, it's Season 2 that immediately springs to mind, due to the addition of the fabulous Mary Louise Wilson as sassy cocktail waitress neighbour Ginny Wrobliki. Wilson's acid tongue and razor-sharp wit made for a truly memorable character who was like a younger, sexier version of Maude. Her debut in ""The Upholstery Ripoff"" is my favorite ODAAT episode ever! Also not to be missed are her appearances in the episode with Schneider's thieving nephew (Mark Hamill) and when Schneider himself decides to pop the question to Ginny at a party--and she flatly turns him down in front of everyone!The classic New Years' Eve show where the cast perform at a nursing home and MacKenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli perform ""Don't Go Breakin' My Heart"" is a Must-See for '70s nostalgia and kitsch value.Please Sony, if you have no interest in releasing this (or additional) seasons of ODAAT, at least license it out to the wonderful folks at Shout! Factory, who are considered saviours by all fans of Classic TV.",5,"""I Bought These Pantyhose in an Egg--I'll Have to Bury Them in a Walnut""",1284681600,"09 17, 2010",2010,1658,"['April', '2007', 'Sony', 'brought', 'long-awaited', 'debut', 'One', 'Day', 'Time', 'DVD.This', 'abbreviated', 'season', 'originally', 'ran', 'CBS', '1975-76', 'became', 'instant', 'hit', 'Bonnie', 'Franklin', 'portrayal', 'Ann', 'Romano', 'being', 'notable', 'prime', 'time', 'first', 'divorced', 'leading', 'lady', 'actually', 'Lee', 'Grant', 'Fay', 'preceded', 'few', 'months', 'show', 'was', 'quickly', 'cancelled', 'erased', 'most', 'viewer', 'memories', 'was', 'afraid', 'would', 'find', 'Richard', 'Masur', 'character', 'annoying', 'would', 'taint', 'enjoyment', 'Season', '1', 'was', 'much', 'better', 'remember', 'episodes', 'went', 'down', 'smooth', 'ice', 'cream', 'left', 'wanting', 'more.When', 'think', 'ODAAT', 'Season', '2', 'immediately', 'mind', 'due', 'addition', 'fabulous', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Wilson', 'sassy', 'cocktail', 'waitress', 'neighbour', 'Ginny', 'Wrobliki', 'Wilson', 'acid', 'tongue', 'razor-sharp', 'wit', 'made', 'truly', 'memorable', 'character', 'who', 'was', 'younger', 'sexier', 'version', 'Maude', 'debut', 'Upholstery', 'Ripoff', 'favorite', 'ODAAT', 'episode', 'ever', 'Also', 'not', 'be', 'missed', 'are', 'appearances', 'episode', 'Schneider', 'thieving', 'nephew', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'when', 'Schneider', 'pop', 'question', 'Ginny', 'party', 'flatly', 'down', 'front', 'everyone', 'classic', 'New', 'Years', 'Eve', 'show', 'where', 'cast', 'perform', 'nursing', 'home', 'MacKenzie', 'Phillips', 'Valerie', 'Bertinelli', 'perform', 'Do', ""n't"", 'Go', 'Breakin', 'My', 'Heart', 'Must-See', 'nostalgia', 'kitsch', 'value.Please', 'Sony', 'have', 'interest', 'releasing', 'additional', 'seasons', 'ODAAT', 'least', 'license', 'out', 'wonderful', 'folks', 'Shout', 'Factory', 'who', 'are', 'considered', 'saviours', 'fans', 'Classic', 'TV']",One Day at a Time: Season 2
1281753,A303U1MOXG5R1F,B002OOWLIY,Sylviastel,"[1, 1]","With the recent loss of the show's star, Bonnie Franklin, who played divorcee Ann Romano in the long-running sitcom series. I don't understand why the production companies have failed to re-issue the second season on DVD. It's been years since the first season was finally released.This series was groundbreaking for many reasons in the 1970s about a newly divorced mother, Ann Romano, who chose to use her maiden name than her former husband's name and her two teenage daughters in urban Indianapolis, Indiana where they lived during the entire series. Pat Harrington Jr. played the building super Schneider who always brought comic relief and wisdom. New tenant is played by the wonderful Mary Louise Wilson, a cocktail waitress.Still, I would love to see the second season again with perhaps an Intimate Portrait of Bonnie Franklin and Valerie Bertinelli in the specials feature or their reunion on television 30 years later. The show was also memorable for casting Mark Hamill as Schneider's nephew. The series brought humor, warmth, realism, and love to help understand the series and ourselves as well.Nobody expected this show to survive the first season much less thrive and succeed for eight more seasons. Please release the entire series on DVD for the demanding public.",5,Release the Second Season Now!,1366156800,"04 17, 2013",2013,1280,"['recent', 'loss', 'show', 'star', 'Bonnie', 'Franklin', 'who', 'played', 'divorcee', 'Ann', 'Romano', 'long-running', 'sitcom', 'series', 'do', ""n't"", 'understand', 'why', 'production', 'companies', 'have', 'failed', 're-issue', 'second', 'season', 'DVD', 'been', 'years', 'first', 'season', 'was', 'finally', 'released.This', 'series', 'was', 'groundbreaking', 'many', 'reasons', '1970s', 'newly', 'divorced', 'mother', 'Ann', 'Romano', 'who', 'chose', 'use', 'maiden', 'name', 'former', 'husband', 'name', 'two', 'teenage', 'daughters', 'urban', 'Indianapolis', 'Indiana', 'where', 'lived', 'entire', 'series', 'Pat', 'Harrington', 'Jr.', 'played', 'building', 'super', 'Schneider', 'who', 'always', 'brought', 'comic', 'relief', 'wisdom', 'New', 'tenant', 'played', 'wonderful', 'Mary', 'Louise', 'Wilson', 'cocktail', 'waitress.Still', 'would', 'love', 'see', 'second', 'season', 'again', 'perhaps', 'Intimate', 'Portrait', 'Bonnie', 'Franklin', 'Valerie', 'Bertinelli', 'specials', 'feature', 'reunion', 'television', '30', 'years', 'later', 'show', 'was', 'also', 'memorable', 'casting', 'Mark', 'Hamill', 'Schneider', 'nephew', 'series', 'brought', 'humor', 'warmth', 'realism', 'love', 'help', 'understand', 'series', 'well.Nobody', 'expected', 'show', 'survive', 'first', 'season', 'much', 'less', 'thrive', 'succeed', 'eight', 'more', 'seasons', 'Please', 'release', 'entire', 'series', 'DVD', 'demanding', 'public']",One Day at a Time: Season 2

If ever a time to continue releasing this show is now, since Valerie Bertinelli and Mackenzie Phillips are talked about alot alot now, more people would probably buy it because of that.. just give it a shot at releasing the second season and see how it does, I;m thinking it will do well.

1281755,A2AUEE8X8WSLNT,B002OOWLIY,Tom,"[10, 10]","It's insane that a beloved and outstanding show like ""One Day at a Time"" waits years for the release of its subsequent seasons, while Sony Home Entertainment (which owns ""One Day"") couldn't wait to release the likes of  ""My Big Fat Greek Life, the Complete Series,"" a critical and popular failure by any standards.  Universal is no better, quickly releasing ""My Own Worst Enemy, the Complete Series,"" while other shows--shows which actually were well-received by both audiences and critics--seemingly wait forever for DVD release.  I have to wonder who actually makes the decisions regarding which television products are worthy of the investment and effort of home-video release, and which are not.  They must be the most clueless people in the entertainment industry.By the way (since this is supposed to be a review): Seasons 2 & 3 are the very finest of the ""One Day at a Time"" series.  Season One was very much about Ann Romano's post-divorce relationship with David Kane.  With David out of the picture now, Seasons 2 & 3 give the show's creators and actors a chance to really develop the character of Ann, and even more so, Julie and Barbara Cooper.  In these seasons, Julie and Barbara, as played by Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli, become full-fledged characters in their own right, perfect prototypes of the seventies teenager of a single parent family.  Sometimes you want to strangle them, sometimes you want to hug them, but they're never anything less than completely enthralling.  If this item ever actually makes it to DVD, all I can say is: buy it.  Bonnie Franklin's performance alone is worth every penny, and the supporting cast and writing is every bit as excellent.",5,Just Joining the Pack Here,1310428800,"07 12, 2011",2011,1697,"['insane', 'beloved', 'outstanding', 'show', 'One', 'Day', 'Time', 'years', 'release', 'subsequent', 'seasons', 'Sony', 'Home', 'Entertainment', 'One', 'Day', 'could', ""n't"", 'wait', 'release', 'likes', 'Big', 'Fat', 'Greek', 'Life', 'Complete', 'Series', 'critical', 'popular', 'failure', 'standards', 'Universal', 'better', 'quickly', 'releasing', 'Own', 'Worst', 'Enemy', 'Complete', 'Series', 'other', 'shows', 'actually', 'were', 'well-received', 'audiences', 'critics', 'seemingly', 'wait', 'forever', 'DVD', 'release', 'have', 'wonder', 'who', 'actually', 'decisions', 'regarding', 'television', 'products', 'are', 'worthy', 'investment', 'effort', 'home-video', 'release', 'are', 'not', 'must', 'be', 'most', 'clueless', 'people', 'entertainment', 'way', 'supposed', 'be', 'review', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'are', 'very', 'finest', 'One', 'Day', 'Time', 'series', 'Season', 'One', 'was', 'very', 'much', 'Ann', 'Romano', 'post-divorce', 'relationship', 'David', 'Kane', 'David', 'picture', 'now', 'Seasons', '2', '3', 'give', 'show', 'creators', 'actors', 'chance', 'really', 'develop', 'character', 'Ann', 'even', 'more', 'so', 'Julie', 'Barbara', 'Cooper', 'seasons', 'Julie', 'Barbara', 'played', 'Mackenzie', 'Phillips', 'Valerie', 'Bertinelli', 'become', 'full-fledged', 'characters', 'own', 'right', 'perfect', 'prototypes', 'seventies', 'teenager', 'single', 'parent', 'family', 'Sometimes', 'want', 'strangle', 'sometimes', 'want', 'hug', ""'re"", 'never', 'anything', 'less', 'completely', 'enthralling', 'item', 'ever', 'actually', 'DVD', 'can', 'say', 'buy', 'Bonnie', 'Franklin', 'performance', 'alone', 'worth', 'penny', 'supporting', 'cast', 'writing', 'bit', 'excellent']",One Day at a Time: Season 2
