789999,A1H7IQM3WMOF11,B0000ZBONW,"Heather Richards ""darkjediqueen""","[1, 2]","I remember reading Wuthering Heights in high school. I loved the book, a classic tale of thwarted love and revenge. It always seemed to me a book that could be updated very effectively into a modern version, yet when MTV tries to make the classic into a modern love story, it loses much of the power that the novel has.Heath is an intense foudling that is taken in by Earnshaw, who has two children of his own, Kate and Hendrix. Kate and Heath become inseparable and Hendrix becomes jealous as Heath seems to be a better son than he is. Years pass and Heath possessively claims Kate, who has started to resent the treatment. A series of unfortunate events cause Kate to end up getting married to Edward Linton, while Heath broods away in his music. Eventually the two are reunited in an ending that tries to keep some of the integrity of the story, but fails with the odd difference of the ending in the book and the movie, which takes out a lot of the power that the novel had.Mike Vogel is surprisingly not a horrible Heathcliff character, with passion and rage, but with the cheesy soap opera style script, he isn't given much to work with. To make the main characters more likable, the writer changed their characters from the novel to the movie. No longer is Kate the frivolous, faithless lover of Heath as Cathy was to Heathcliff, but she is seen as rather a victim of circumstance. Heath is not the vindictive monster than Heathcliff was and his relationship with Isabel is seen as her originally trying to use him instead of the other way around. Yet even though they characters are supposed to be more likable, they seem watered down. Heathcliff and Cathy weren't really star crossed, they destroyed each other. Their love was a destructive kind, something the movie tries to portray in words, but not actions of the characters.This movie could have been really good. The actors had the talent to make the story young, hip and tragic, but the writing that tried to give the movie a slightly happy ending effectively undercuts everything that the actors are trying for.",3,It Had Potential,1097020800,"10 6, 2004",2004,2077,"['remember', 'reading', 'Wuthering', 'Heights', 'high', 'school', 'loved', 'book', 'classic', 'tale', 'thwarted', 'love', 'revenge', 'always', 'seemed', 'book', 'could', 'be', 'updated', 'very', 'effectively', 'modern', 'version', 'yet', 'when', 'MTV', 'make', 'classic', 'modern', 'love', 'story', 'much', 'power', 'novel', 'has.Heath', 'intense', 'foudling', 'taken', 'Earnshaw', 'who', 'two', 'children', 'own', 'Kate', 'Hendrix', 'Kate', 'Heath', 'become', 'inseparable', 'Hendrix', 'becomes', 'jealous', 'Heath', 'be', 'better', 'son', 'Years', 'pass', 'Heath', 'possessively', 'Kate', 'who', 'started', 'resent', 'treatment', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'cause', 'Kate', 'end', 'up', 'getting', 'married', 'Edward', 'Linton', 'Heath', 'broods', 'away', 'music', 'Eventually', 'two', 'are', 'reunited', 'ending', 'keep', 'integrity', 'story', 'odd', 'difference', 'ending', 'book', 'movie', 'out', 'lot', 'power', 'novel', 'had.Mike', 'Vogel', 'surprisingly', 'not', 'horrible', 'Heathcliff', 'character', 'passion', 'rage', 'cheesy', 'soap', 'opera', 'style', 'script', ""n't"", 'given', 'much', 'work', 'make', 'main', 'characters', 'more', 'likable', 'writer', 'changed', 'characters', 'novel', 'movie', 'No', 'longer', 'Kate', 'frivolous', 'faithless', 'lover', 'Heath', 'Cathy', 'was', 'Heathcliff', 'seen', 'rather', 'victim', 'circumstance', 'Heath', 'not', 'vindictive', 'monster', 'Heathcliff', 'was', 'relationship', 'Isabel', 'seen', 'originally', 'trying', 'use', 'instead', 'other', 'way', 'even', 'characters', 'are', 'supposed', 'be', 'more', 'likable', 'seem', 'watered', 'down', 'Heathcliff', 'Cathy', 'were', ""n't"", 'really', 'star', 'crossed', 'destroyed', 'other', 'love', 'was', 'destructive', 'kind', 'something', 'movie', 'portray', 'words', 'not', 'actions', 'characters.This', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'really', 'good', 'actors', 'had', 'talent', 'make', 'story', 'young', 'hip', 'tragic', 'writing', 'tried', 'give', 'movie', 'slightly', 'happy', 'ending', 'effectively', 'undercuts', 'everything', 'actors', 'are', 'trying']",N/A

I watched it the first time it was broadcast because I am a sucker for Jim Steinman's over-the-top music (he's the guy behind Meatloaf's and Bonnie Tyler's biggest hits).  Steinman's bombastic, operatic rock-n-roll seemd like a perfect match to the epic love (and hate) story that is ""Wuthering Heights.""  Unfortunately, the four Steinman songs (two recycled--as per usual; and two seemingly new--at least to me) were stripped down of the over production that makes Steinman the glory he is.  I've never heard his work sound so anemic!The performances were tooth-achingly bad (the leads had absolutely no chemistry, which made it hard to buy the whole obsessive/destructive love thing) with direction and editing to match.  The story was choppy at best (I had trouble following the timeline as to when things were happening), bewildering mostly.  If ever there was a movie that was pretentious while being completely vacuous, here it is.  I kept questioning my skills at self-preservation as the movie dragged on, but as a dedicated Jim Steinman fan, I sat it out as I taped it for a fellow JS fan.  After the movie was over, I called my friend and told him that because I valued his friendship, I could not in good conscience send him the tape.

One was that I had heard some of the songs and really liked them. Another was that I am a big fan of the book and have read it several times.I had been warned before I watched it that this movie is almost nothing like the book, and for the most part that is true. This movie could have been written by somebody who had only read the cliffsnotes of the book, and decided to set the story in modern times.I think though, that they captured at least part, though not all, of the essance of the book. Catherine and Heathcliff, here called Kate and Heath, are both much more likeable than they are in the book. However, there are still moments where she can be annoying and he can be a jerk. I kind of like that because Ive always felt that a large part of the novel is that you want Catherine and Heathcliff to be together and happy even though neither one of them is a very good person.Spoiler alert: of the many many changes, probably the biggest is the ending. Kate does die, but Heath, instead of spending the rest of his life as a grieving psychotic, raises their daughter (who here is his daughter, not Lintons).If you have a test in school in wuthering heights and are trying to skip reading the book by watching a movie, you will fail the test if you watch this one. If you love the novel and are a stickler for movies staying true to the source, you will hate this.

Almost everything would have appeared alien to her, and imaginative guess work can only offer a very modest speculation about what she would have thought of fancy cars and rock music.But one thing is for sure, she would have certainly known the difference between mediocrity and creativity! And alas this newest and loosest of interpretations of her classic masterpiece of love, passion and betrayal would have made her wish she never wrote it in the first place.Modern interpretations of classics are by no means a bad venture, as the examples of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo+Juliet and Alfonso Cuaron's Great Expectations clearly demonstrate,but the problem with the MTV's version of Bronte's classic is its mediocrity..just a plain, lifeless and average direction and acting. Had the film had a different title, and had MTV did not market it in an 'in your face hip, cool, trendy and young' way, then maybe it would have been much more bearable.MTV's venture into the world of movie making has not been a glorious success so far, and simply because they are following the same approach and mental frame that they take in their musical and reality TV productions, and this is a big mistake.Anyway, the overbearing and passionate  Victorian world of Bronte and her dramatic but sadly short life were very much part of her work, yet her stories with their universal themes do indeed belong to all the ages, and make good movie material, if only the script, direction and acting are good enough to retain the spirit of the book, while infusing it with a modern outlook.

790010,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0000ZBONW,Tsuyoshi,"[4, 7]","This is an MTV original movie which takes a daring step - modernized `Wuthering Heights' in MTV style. Modernizing classics can be tricky, and not everyone is happy with DiCaprio's `Romeo and Juliet' of which success must be the reason for the production of this `Wuthering Heights.' Still, I think it is not impossible to make a decent film out of Emily Bronte classic in modern situation. You don't have to be perfectly faithful to the book because it is practically impossible (Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes version tries it but didn't work).So I bought the video and watched it. My impression is ... Can you give me a refund please? I don't mind if they changed the names. Heathcliff is Heath and Catherine is Cate. ""Wuthering Heights"" becomes `Heights' the lighthouse by the beautiful seaside. And, see, Heath, formerly an orphan raised by kind Mr. Earnshaw, is so cool a guy that he grows up to be a rock-star. This sounds pretty incredible, but I have to believe this story because Heath is a ""musically talented homeless youth,"" according to the descriptions on the back cover of the VHS. But what is really incredible is not that part.[LIFELESS CHARACTERS AND DIALOGUES] `I love you' - melodramatic music starts -- `I love you' - music continues: fade out - `No, I wanna go. I hate you!' `You belong with me!' `Let go of me!' `Wait!' `Let go of ME!"" -- The story goes on and on like this. There is no chemistry between Heath and Cate, and rich boy Edward is peeping at them through a telescope from his mansion. Cate's brother Hendrix is reduced to awful stereotype of punk rock musician who can smashes a guitar in pieces. As to musical instruments, Edward can be as wild as Hendrix for he can throws a violin-cello into the ocean if he likes. Oh, and the conclusion of the film is pretty weird.Erika Christensen (`Swinfan'), Mike Vogel (`The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'), Chris Masterson (`Malcolm in the Middle'), Johnny Whitworth (`Empire Records') and Katherine Heigl (`Roswell') appear, but none of them is allowed to show what they can do. There is no chance form the cast from the beginning when the story is so thin, and the romance is so shallow. John Doe and Aimee Osbourne also appear briefly, but can do nothing to save the film from the mess.Don't waist your precious time of your life as I did, watching this terrible adaptation.",1,WARNING: Classic Love Romance in MTV Style (and It's from MTV ...
