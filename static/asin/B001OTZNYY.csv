1225250,A328S9RN3U5M68,B001OTZNYY,Grady Harp,"[36, 36]","Prague is considered by many to be one of the most beautiful old cities in Europe: it is also seen as clinging to many of the old traditions of the rigid life of the past - immutable, on guard, cold.  It is therefore a very fitting setting for this brilliant film PRAGUE, a story written (with Kim Fupz Akeson) and directed by Ole Christian Madsen that deals with contemporary relationships, family, and the bifurcation between surface appearance and reality.Christoffer (Mads Mikkelson) and his wife Maja (Stine Stengade) have traveled from Denmark without their young son to tend to the final paperwork following the death of Christoffer's father, a father he has not seen or communicated with for 25 years when the father left wife and son for Prague.  Christoffer shows no emotion about this mission and even when the doctor (Josef Vajnar) demands Christoffer view the body for identification, there is no sense of sadness.  His father's lawyer (Borivoj Navr&aacute;til) make all the arrangements for the shipment of the body back to Denmark and informs Christoffer that the financial balance sheet at the time of death leaves Christoffer with only the house in which his father lived, a place Christoffer plans to sell immediately to end this Prague obligation.  But during all the 'business' of dealing with his father's death, Christoffer feels a distance from Maja and confronts her with his knowledge that she is having an affair.  The veneer of their marriage cracks open and the couple must face the current status of their relationship, a widening crevice that is in many ways held together only by the frequent video calls with their son in Denmark. Theirs  is a history of love examined.Christoffer's closure with his father includes the discovery that his father had a beautiful singer/housekeeper Alena (Jana Plodkov&aacute;) who lived with the father with her daughter. When they meet they have no common language but Christoffer learns of his father's apparent abiding love for Christoffer.  Another surprise hits Christoffer when he discovers the relationship between his father and the lawyer, a relationship that explains why the father left Denmark for Prague and a new life.  With all the new information about the father he never knew Christoffer faces decisions about his own marriage and his role as a father to his own son and the last wishes of his father before he died. Though eager to return to Denmark there are 'procedural problems' that prolong the stay in PraguePRAGUE  is a story about love in all its permutations - disappointments, rewards, and longings both filled and unfulfilled.  The manner in which each of the characters plays out the consequences of love against the cold background of the rigid atmosphere of the city of Prague is like watching organisms under a microscope.  Enhanced by a powerful musical score by Jonas Struch and moody cinematography by Jrgen Johansson  it is a powerful film, beautifully acted, and one with much food for thought even after the film is over.

Stine Stengade as his becoming estranged wife is also as keen in her role as they arrive to depose of his dead father's remains in Europe's most historic and beautiful of cities. We only see glimpses of this Prague as their relationship crumbles in dramatic close ups and coming to truth of whom each other really is. There are no winners and the film as a whole is bleak and sad, but as a son discovers a father he never knew, Mads character unravels a bit more beyond than he has ever known himself.

1225268,A2Z9L0JK0XRS61,B001OTZNYY,S. Spilka,"[4, 6]","The plot is promising. However, the failing marriage is not explored in any depth. The plot offers the possibility of throwing light on the marriage of these two people, but it doesn't do that. Why did the wife start the affair? Just because her husband ""wasn't there"" emotionally? What does that mean? Where did the estrangement come from? What kind of estrangement was it? There are so many kinds. As Tolstoy said, and I paraphrase, ""All happy marriages are alike; I am interested in the unhappy marriages, which are all different."" And did he explore them in depth! Even his short story ""The Death of Ivan Ilych,"" which deals mainly with the thoughts of a dying man, exposes all the mistakes and the selfishness of his marriage. Yes, both our books and our movies are becoming shallow.In Prague, does the husband really love his wife?  Does she love him? Who knows? Did she ever love him? At the beginning of the movie, he asks her when she was last happy with him. A very good question, but she can't answer, and even her inability to answer is not explained.  There is little reality to this movie. Mads indeed is a good actor. His wife is also a good actor, but her character never explains why she is so attached to a man so many years younger than she.SECOND VIEWING OF THE MOVIE:Well, I was much too harsh and hasty in my judgment. Seeing it a second time, I noticed its subtle beauty and depth. Prague is a poem, a chamber movie (as in chamber music). It's all there--the break-up and the pain--not only in direct statements and actions, but in hints and in silences, in looks and subtle facial expressions. This is a poetic and layered expression of devastation. The sudden explosion of anger between the two in public puts into sharp relief the laced and intricate design of the whole movie. Also interesting is the even-handed treatment of the husband and the wife. Both have failed somehow in their marriage, but they hadn't noticed the failure until it explodes in their faces. Whose fault is it--the wife's or the husband's? You can't say because both had been oblivious to the abyss opening between them and therefore unable to build a bridge of understanding and introspection over it. I still would like to know why the wife never tried to explain her misery to her husband, instead of taking on a lover, but that remains my only dissatisfaction with this poetic movie.",4,"At first disappointing, but second viewing shows its beauty",1365638400,"04 11, 2013",2013,2388,"['plot', 'promising', 'However', 'failing', 'marriage', 'not', 'explored', 'depth', 'plot', 'possibility', 'throwing', 'light', 'marriage', 'two', 'people', ""n't"", 'do', 'Why', 'did', 'wife', 'start', 'affair', 'Just', 'husband', 'was', ""n't"", 'there', 'emotionally', 'What', 'mean', 'Where', 'did', 'estrangement', 'come', 'What', 'kind', 'estrangement', 'was', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'kinds', 'Tolstoy', 'said', 'paraphrase', 'happy', 'marriages', 'are', 'alike', 'am', 'interested', 'unhappy', 'marriages', 'are', 'different', 'did', 'explore', 'depth', 'Even', 'short', 'story', 'Death', 'Ivan', 'Ilych', 'mainly', 'thoughts', 'dying', 'man', 'mistakes', 'selfishness', 'marriage', 'Yes', 'books', 'movies', 'are', 'becoming', 'shallow.In', 'Prague', 'husband', 'really', 'love', 'wife', 'love', 'Who', 'Did', 'ever', 'love', 'beginning', 'movie', 'when', 'was', 'last', 'happy', 'very', 'good', 'question', 'ca', ""n't"", 'answer', 'even', 'inability', 'answer', 'not', 'explained', 'little', 'reality', 'movie', 'Mads', 'indeed', 'good', 'actor', 'wife', 'also', 'good', 'actor', 'character', 'never', 'why', 'so', 'attached', 'man', 'so', 'many', 'years', 'younger', 'she.SECOND', 'VIEWING', 'THE', 'MOVIE', 'Well', 'was', 'much', 'too', 'harsh', 'hasty', 'judgment', 'Seeing', 'second', 'time', 'noticed', 'subtle', 'beauty', 'depth', 'Prague', 'poem', 'chamber', 'movie', 'chamber', 'music', 'there', 'break-up', 'pain', 'not', 'only', 'direct', 'statements', 'actions', 'hints', 'silences', 'looks', 'subtle', 'facial', 'expressions', 'poetic', 'layered', 'expression', 'devastation', 'sudden', 'explosion', 'anger', 'two', 'public', 'puts', 'sharp', 'relief', 'laced', 'intricate', 'design', 'whole', 'movie', 'Also', 'interesting', 'even-handed', 'treatment', 'husband', 'wife', 'have', 'failed', 'somehow', 'marriage', 'had', ""n't"", 'noticed', 'failure', 'Whose', 'fault', 'wife', 'husband', 'ca', ""n't"", 'say', 'had', 'been', 'oblivious', 'abyss', 'opening', 'therefore', 'unable', 'build', 'bridge', 'understanding', 'introspection', 'still', 'would', 'like', 'know', 'why', 'wife', 'never', 'tried', 'explain', 'misery', 'husband', 'instead', 'taking', 'lover', 'only', 'dissatisfaction', 'poetic', 'movie']",Prague

The acting is superb, music is great, writing is amazing, has some strange comical and humorous moments, cinematography is interesting.

1225271,A333636QFPT073,B001OTZNYY,Wanderer,"[4, 7]","Having seen quite a few Danish films, I have to say that this one would probably be considered typical, both in a good and bad way.It's typical in a good way because of the gritty, believable plot, beautiful cinematography, the quality of the acting, the pace of the film and well done musical score. It's good because there is some predictability, but also (towards the end, of course) very unpredictable twisting of the plot in a direction one wouldn't suspect at the outset. Still, that's what typically makes for a good Danish film.What makes it typical in a bad way is probably the slow parts of the film, the protracted scenes which might have been shortened and, in this case, almost complete lack of any intensity. I realize it's not an action flick, but there's literally only one scene in the film where people are truly raising their voices and getting crazy. It is, however, extremely well done in that instance, so to some degree that makes up for it being the only such scene in the film.All said, I still recommend this movie. Again, it's typical for both good and bad reasons, but it remains a typical example of quality Danish cinema.
