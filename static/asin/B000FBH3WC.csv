987480,A11C08FBE0Q9VI,B000FBH3WC,"It's me ""logitechgirl""","[6, 25]","I give the sitcom itself 4-5 stars.  It's great and creative within it's simplicity and I especially enjoy the episodes where the great supporting cast (spence, deacon, lou ferigno, etc) have a lot.  Stiller is as always brilliant.  My problem is with the dvd collection itself which unfortunately has ALOT of repeat episodes in the volumes.  For instance in the 5th season DVD set at least half of the contained footage is from previous seasons.  This goes for all the other sets as well so you'll have to pick and choose the episodes from the menus as u go along just to avoid having seen the same episode 3 times or more depending on what season you have.  Wish each season only had THAT season's episodes on it.  Of coarse if they did it that way there'd probably only be one cd per season and maybe they figured they could charge more if they did it this way.  I'd give the dvd's one star for that and give it all three stars to average it out.",3,"Unique and awesome sitcom, but this review is on the dvd sets",1151798400,"07 2, 2006",2006,949,"['give', 'sitcom', '4-5', 'stars', 'great', 'creative', 'simplicity', 'especially', 'enjoy', 'episodes', 'where', 'great', 'supporting', 'cast', 'spence', 'deacon', 'lou', 'ferigno', 'etc', 'have', 'lot', 'Stiller', 'always', 'brilliant', 'problem', 'dvd', 'collection', 'unfortunately', 'ALOT', 'repeat', 'episodes', 'volumes', 'instance', '5th', 'season', 'DVD', 'set', 'least', 'half', 'contained', 'footage', 'previous', 'seasons', 'other', 'sets', 'as', 'well', ""'ll"", 'have', 'pick', 'choose', 'episodes', 'menus', 'u', 'go', 'along', 'just', 'avoid', 'having', 'seen', 'same', 'episode', '3', 'times', 'more', 'depending', 'what', 'season', 'have', 'Wish', 'season', 'only', 'had', 'THAT', 'season', 'episodes', 'coarse', 'did', 'way', ""'d"", 'probably', 'only', 'be', 'one', 'cd', 'season', 'maybe', 'figured', 'could', 'charge', 'more', 'did', 'way', ""'d"", 'give', 'dvd', 'one', 'star', 'give', 'three', 'stars', 'average', 'out']",The King of Queens: Season 5

Doug coaching Deacon's son's football team, then realising his own football dream is still alive. Doug and Carrie accidently pick up another couples photos and realise their life isn't as exciting as it could be. Doug and Carrie's home being affected by mould, but Doug lies so they can take a vacation, then realise they have no money to spend, Doug tries to put Carrie on a budget.
