Ciaran Hinds, one of my favorite actors, is perfect in the role of Michael Henchard. Although Henchard does many things that are completely out of character (selling his wife and child may just take the cake), Hardy's writing along with Hinds's portrayal make viewers sympathize with him while realizing his complexity. A very emotional and moving piece. I bawled my eyes out at the end.Particularly good casting in Polly Walker as Lucetta.

767204,AKH9SCCIYSSGJ,B0000AQS3P,anna-joelle,"[43, 43]","This is a lavish 2003 production by A&amp;E which stays true to the characterization and flow of the story in Hardy's novel. The 5 major characters in this drama will hold your attention throughout as you watch how their lives intertwine and the tragedies unfold.The story centers on Michael Henchard, Mayor of Casterbridge. Henchard has a dark and shameful secret which occurs nearly 20 years before when he is then just a poor hay trusser. One day, when drunk, he sells his wife (Susan) and baby daughter (Elizabeth-Jane) to a stranger. When he regains sobriety, he tries to locate his family but they have gone abroad with the stranger. Regretting his action, Henchard vows to refrain from alcohol. He turns over a new leaf, settles in a new town (Casterbrige) and later becomes a wealthy tradesman and Mayor. Then one day, Susan returns to him with the now grown Elizabeth-Jane (&quot;EJ&quot;, played by Jodie May), who may or may not be Henchard's real daughter. They reconcile and he &quot;remarries&quot; Susan, both agreeing to keep their past relationship a secret. There is relative domestic bliss in Henchard's life until the appearance of 2 other characters.The first is Donald Farfrae, a young and handsome Scotsman (played by James Purefoy) whom Henchard persuades to assist him in his wheat and corn business. When Farfrae becomes more popular than Henchard and proves to be cleverer in managing the business, Henchard becomes jealous, fires him and begins to treat him as an enemy. The problem is that at that time, Farfrae is already subtly courting EJ. The second character to rock the boat is a beautiful woman, Lucetta (played by Polly Walker) who is Henchard's secret lover before the return of Susan.The acting by all the actors is phenomenal. Ciaran Hinds is perfect in the title role. James Purefoy, with his dreamy eyes and sensuous lips is a heavensent as the handsome, gentle and well-meaning Farfrae. But the best performance is by Jodie May who plays the sweet, uncomplaining (and quietly suffering) EJ most sensitively. She is my favourite character in the story.Many scenes will stay in the viewer's mind. To me, these are the 3 most unforgetable scenes:1) EJ and Farfrae meeting in a barn while it is raining heavily outside. After they have talked a little, Farfrae tells EJ that she has dust(husks?) all over her dress. EJ tries to wipe them off, but Farfrae (in that delicious Scottish accent of his) tells her that &quot;blowing is best&quot; (so as not to ruin the dress). He then gets real close to her to blow the dust away. So gently he does it, blowing around EJ and close to her neck. It is a most romantic scene. Throughout you see that EJ is shy about it but there is an unmistakably delighted expression on her face.2) When Henchard chooses to reveal a terrible secret to EJ, causing her heart to break. As she cries bitterly, you realize all the more what a wonderful actress Jodie May is. Her tears are genuine, large drops that literally rain down from her eyes.3) The scene involving Lucetta in her red dress, and two human effigies. I cannot forget how Lucetta collapses to the floor in hearsickness when she catches sight of the effigies from her window, and her anguished cries of &quot;Oh, I shall die. I shall die.&quot; I find this scene most sad and harrowing.To sum it up, this is a most superior and sumptuous period drama and I highly recommend it.

767207,A19L1OUMFT4VNE,B0000AQS3P,Basilides,"[1, 1]","There are plenty of people around who will tell you that 'the book is always better than the film'. But that's not always the case. I can think of a few exceptions and this is one of them. What's more I think Hardy would have agreed with me.The point is that the Tragedy is far more powerful in this TV version than the book could ever be because the whole thing is concentrated in the space of a couple of hours whereas the book will probably take the average reader a week. Reading it fast would be no solution anyway - it wouldn't go deep enough.By concentrating the story into the length of the film we almost manage to return to the Aristotelian unities of time, place and action upon which the full effect of Greek Tragedy was ideally meant to rest. When you read the book the tragic effect is weakened and diffused by the very long period of time necessarily covered by the action and by the time it takes to read it. Unity of action is also lost. Hardy of course is well aware of this and always tries to make up for this by emphasising unity of place which he is very good at, but he always does this through objective, external description and this is the very thing that contemporary TV films can count as their greatest strength.The upshot is that when we see the film we can be very deeply affected by Henchard's fate. Speaking for myself, I was as deeply moved as I have been by any Tragedy I have ever seen. On the other hand I can say that I was little moved by the book and rather resented the work I had put into reading it.I would say the same thing about Polanski's 'Tess' and the TV version 'Tess Of The Durbervilles', both very fine pieces of work to rival any films ever made in the naturalistic style, and again both better than the book for the same reasons.I believe their status would be much greater among cineasts if they were not based on 19th century novels. It's not 'cool' to adapt a classic novel. After all 'the book is always better'.

The A&E; adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel is an all-around solid one -- solid scripting, solid directing, solid acting from Ciar&aacute;n Hinds and Jodhi May.At a county fair, Michael Henchard (Hinds) gets drunk, and auctions his wife and baby daughter off to a kindly sailor. So he swears off booze for the next twenty-one years, and works hard to become a pillar of the community.Nineteen years later, the sailor is lost at sea, and the wife Susan (Juliet Aubrey) and grown daughter Elizabeth Jane (Jodhi May) return to Casterbridge, and find that Michael has become the mayor and corporate head of the town. He's also incredibly sorry for what he did, and asks Susan to remarry him quietly so his crime never needs to be known. She does.But Michael soon feels threatened by his brilliant new manager Donald Farfrae (James Purefoy), who is also falling in love with Elizabeth Jane. Michael's corporate power begins to slip, and when Susan dies he discovers a shocking fact about his daughter -- sending him into a spiral of lies, jealousy and misery.Basically, it's all about watching someone's life go down the drain. There have been more complete adaptations of the Thomas Hardy novel, but this one is just fast-moving and tense enough to give it a feeling of urgency.The big lesson: Henchard's life isn't wrecked because of alcohol, or even because he auctionied off his wife -- he ruins his own life with his lies, viciousness, and the ugly flaws that makes him try to control the people around him. It has some cute scenes between Purefoy and May in a rainy barn, but other than that it's a relentlessly dark movie.The whole thing is set in a picturesque English village in a pretty green countryside. David Thacker doesn't neglect the nastier, grimier side of life, but he peppers the story with beautiful visuals (Elizabeth in the graveyard) and moments of merriment or friendship. Then they get ruined by confrontations with Henchard.Hinds and May give the best performances here -- Hinds gives us a solid performance, as a man who tries to do the wrong thing, but is led astray by his temper. He can flip from miserable repentence to cold cruelty in a moment. And May gives a wonderfully sensitive performance as a confused young girl whose romance and job are derailed by her ""father's"" resentment.""The Mayor of Casterbridge"" is an all-around solid miniseries, with two really outstanding performances by May and Hinds.

767217,A3PTOYW3XDY0ID,B0000AQS3P,feedthecat,"[1, 1]","This 2003 ITV-A&E; co-production is based on the Thomas Hardy novel THE LIFE AND DEATH OF THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE: A STORY OF A MAN OF CHARACTER, which was written in 1886 and  set in the middle of the 19th century in the fictitious English county of Wessex.  The screenplay was adapted by Ted Whitehead (a Hardy scholar) and Sally Head was executive producer.As noted by the novel's subtitle, the Mayor of Casterbridge, Michael Henchard (wonderfully brought to life in all his glory by the magnificent Ciaran Hinds), is a ""man of character"", by which Hardy means a ""very human"" man.  Henchard's great hubris is his pride and other powerful emotions, which lead him to often react to those in his life in very rash, insensitive, and (self-)destructive ways.  Although the fates play a large role in the events of his life, it is Henchard himself who determines his life's course.Hardy contrasts his protagonist with Donald Farfrae (nicely played by Hinds' future ROME castmate, the handsome James Purefoy), who is befriended by the mayor, but later becomes his business and political rival, and who is pragmatic and unemotional; indeed, he is so detached that when he does appear to display feelings, it is often more a case of him simply acting in a manner that he believes one is supposed to in such circumstances.  And, it is the two women in their lives, Henchard's daughter Elizabeth-Jane (period piece favourite Jodhi May) and love interest Lucetta (the very curvaceous Polly Walker, who also starred in ROME), who are a major source of conflict between the man of character and his polar opposite.  Incidentally, the act that is shown to be Henchard's first egregious decision (I won't reveal what it is) did, in fact, occur in that era - though obviously not often -  and hearing of one such incident planted one of the seeds of this story in Hardy's fertile mind.Although shot in 2001, for some reason or another this adaptation did not air until 2003, but it was well worth the wait, as the production values are very high and the acting superb.  The ending, in particular, is especially moving, btw.  And, if I remember correctly, this was originally broadcast on A&E; as a three hour movie, but, as this film actually has a running time of around 194 minutes, there must have been at least 40 minutes edited out of the broadcast.Have the tissues ready when you watch it.",5,a fine adaptation & one of Hinds' best performances,1332892800,"03 28, 2012",2012,2384,"['2003', 'ITV-A', 'E', 'co-production', 'based', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'THE', 'LIFE', 'AND', 'DEATH', 'THE', 'MAYOR', 'OF', 'CASTERBRIDGE', 'STORY', 'A', 'MAN', 'OF', 'CHARACTER', 'was', 'written', '1886', 'set', 'middle', '19th', 'century', 'fictitious', 'English', 'county', 'Wessex', 'screenplay', 'was', 'adapted', 'Ted', 'Whitehead', 'Hardy', 'scholar', 'Sally', 'Head', 'was', 'executive', 'producer.As', 'noted', 'novel', 'subtitle', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', 'Michael', 'Henchard', 'wonderfully', 'brought', 'life', 'glory', 'magnificent', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'man', 'character', 'Hardy', 'very', 'human', 'man', 'Henchard', 'great', 'hubris', 'pride', 'other', 'powerful', 'emotions', 'lead', 'often', 'react', 'life', 'very', 'rash', 'insensitive', 'self-', 'destructive', 'ways', 'fates', 'play', 'large', 'role', 'events', 'life', 'Henchard', 'who', 'life', 'course.Hardy', 'protagonist', 'Donald', 'Farfrae', 'nicely', 'played', 'Hinds', 'future', 'ROME', 'castmate', 'handsome', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'who', 'befriended', 'mayor', 'later', 'business', 'political', 'rival', 'who', 'pragmatic', 'unemotional', 'indeed', 'so', 'detached', 'when', 'appear', 'display', 'feelings', 'often', 'more', 'case', 'simply', 'acting', 'manner', 'one', 'supposed', 'such', 'circumstances', 'two', 'women', 'lives', 'Henchard', 'daughter', 'Elizabeth-Jane', 'period', 'favourite', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'love', 'interest', 'Lucetta', 'very', 'curvaceous', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'who', 'also', 'starred', 'ROME', 'who', 'are', 'major', 'source', 'conflict', 'man', 'character', 'polar', 'opposite', 'Incidentally', 'act', 'shown', 'be', 'Henchard', 'first', 'egregious', 'decision', 'wo', ""n't"", 'reveal', 'what', 'did', 'fact', 'occur', 'era', 'obviously', 'not', 'often', 'hearing', 'one', 'such', 'incident', 'planted', 'one', 'seeds', 'story', 'Hardy', 'fertile', 'mind.Although', 'shot', '2001', 'reason', 'adaptation', 'did', 'not', 'air', '2003', 'was', 'well', 'wait', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'very', 'high', 'acting', 'superb', 'ending', 'particular', 'especially', 'moving', 'btw', 'remember', 'correctly', 'was', 'originally', 'broadcast', 'A', 'E', 'three', 'hour', 'movie', 'film', 'actually', 'running', 'time', '194', 'minutes', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'least', '40', 'minutes', 'edited', 'broadcast.Have', 'tissues', 'ready', 'when', 'watch']",N/A

Please understand that the story follows pretty faithfully the Thomas Hardy novel.  If you don't like the story, that's fine.  However, it doesn't reflect on the quality of this production!I love both this version and the Alan Bates version.  As a rule, Cirian Hinds always wins for me hands down as having the definitive take on any of his classic roles (Rochester in Jane Eyre, Capt. Wentworth in Persuasion, etc).  However, it's something of a toss up here as Alan Bates was also excellent.  I think a few of the supporting roles in this version are better though.Certainly, this version is the more ""accessible"" one for most, due to higher production values and a tighter pace.I'd really recommend checking out both if you can as it's fun to compare the two.

This is a major work of substance and sorrow.The one exception to the otherwise perfect production is the perpetually confounding casting of actor Jodhi May. Here, she gives yet another one-note performance; her brow knit, and open mouth near drooling instead of acting. Not only is she unremarkable looking, in any way, but she is - and I will take flack here - a stereotype Jewish face.Now wait! Before everyone jumps on me, remember that EVERYONE in film is cast not only for the way they act, but primarily (unlike stage) for the way they look; they look stereotypically Irish, or stereotypically Italian, or stereotypically evil, or stereotypically heroic. Unfortunately, not only does Ms May's look incessantly distract, which one could forgive a director for trying something uncoventional, she simply cannot act. And, critically, she bears no resemblance to any of the three actors of which she is supposed to be the offspring! She is an embarrassing English version of Tori Spelling - and must have a parent or relative controlling purse strings in the industry. Nothing else could explain why she is hired.Hers is a key performance, for certain, but miraculously does not sink the ship.

767222,A10A503ML6J308,B0000AQS3P,"JC Another ""Film lover""","[0, 0]","I enjoyed this version of The Mayor of Casterbridge, although it took me a second start watching it to truly connect and enjoy the ride.  I haven't seen any other film version, but have read the book, and consider it one of my favorites, as well as one of Thomas Hardy's best.On my initial attempt to watch the film, I stopped about 10 minutes into it,and put it aside for several days. Although I thought it beautifully realized (so far as visual quality, setting, and the actors chosen to play the roles), I found the fastpace truly irritating.  I must admit, I'd hoped for a much more leisurely, thoughtful rendering of the book.  It all felt too rushed - and the beginning is important, as it sets up the entire story and all that follows.  If you don't care about the characters in the initial set-up, how can you possibly care what comes after?I appreciate that with a book being transformed into film, some license must be taken. After all, Sense and Sensibility (Ang Lee's version, that is, with the screen play by Emma T) took plenty of license - combining some characters, leaving others out, and transferring dialogue to characters that in the book had not uttered those particular words - all for expediency, and to keep the film not only moving along.  But it ""felt"" like Jane Austen, and care was clearly taken to ensure that Austen's tone and sense of time, place and circumstance were not sacrificed on the alter of expediency.  As clearly Emma and Ang were able to do it (and in a lot less running time than given this version of The M of C), I figured someone bothering to translate The Mayor of Casterbridge to film would be able to do the same.With this version of The Mayor, all important plot points seem to be there, but the atmosphere/tone of the book I loved so much was sorely lacking - for me, an important issue.  Why else does one enjoy and read one author over another? What else makes one brilliant while another (telling a similar tale)pedestrian?  Why bother to make a film of an author's work if you are totally insensitive to what it was that made the author go through the long, arduace process of bringing that particular story and those particular characters to life in print?I finally figured, what the heck! I've already bought the DVD (based on my love of the book), so I might as well watch the thing. And truth be told, I did enjoy it. After awhile, I found myself once again swept up in the story, and actually caring what happens, as I had on reading the book.Much of that has to do with the casting, and the quality of the actors chosen.  All managed to paint vivid impressions with the few brushstrokes the limited time alotted them allowed.The main characters were extremely well cast.  I particularly like the lead actress playing Elizabeth Jane's mother.  Frankly (in my opinion), she gave the character more depth than Hardy had in the book, giving flesh to the one character in the book that I had always felt was an enigma. The actress playing Elizabeth Jane was spot on, as was her ""love interest"", the Mayor's foil.  Polly Walker gave a beautifully nuanced performance that truly brought to life a women who continues to choose the direction dictated by her heart, in an age when such choices could mean utter ruin. (In today's world, she'd likely be running the show!)  The sexual politics of the day were wonderfully realized through her performance in particular.And Ciaran Hinds (sp?) was, I thought, brilliant in his depiction of a basically decent man struggling to take possession of his soul, trying to make up for a regretable personal history, continually tortured by the character flaws that continue to haunt. His performance gave final, true weight to the entire endeavor.  I must admit I had only seen him in ""Calendar Girls"" up to that point (in which he was very good as well, in a much more limited role), and was truly impressed at his ability to get across as complex a character as The Mayor of Casterbridge.So yes, eventually, I allowed the film to take hold, and the high caliber of the acting to sweep me along. But again - and not to give anything away - I wish that more time had been allowed at the end of the film as well.I do suppose that, as the film was clearly a made-for-television flick, some time constraints were imposed. I just wish that, at times, the director had let us linger just a bit longer at certain points in the story. Cramming everything in Is a talent, I suppose. But more thought should have been given to why Hardy is still read and appreciated nearly two hundered years later (perhaps appreciated more now than during his lifetime).More care should have been taken to get across all the subtle moments that are the hallmark of Hardy - all the happiness,tragedy, and in-between that reveal who we are as human beings;  the choices we make and the consequences of those choices; the sometimes oppressive weight of the society and times we live in; the intentional as well as the unintentional cruelties we sometimes inflict on each other.  My feelings for Hardy's work, as I am sure it must be for others, runs much deeper than his ability to spin a good yarn.  When I read the Mayor of Casterbridge, I lingered on his words, and marvelled at the depth he was able to achieve in simple, sparing language.This film version of the book sometimes felt like it had been made by a devotee of the Evelyn Wood School for Speed Reading, not by someone who savoured the experience of being allowed into Hardy's world. Savouring Hardy's words and the emotions they bring out should have been given as high a priority in the director's mind as the plot points.  Clearly he was surrounded by the talent to pull it off.And if he couldn't, he should have just handed the reins over someone who could  - like (not to belabour the point!)Ang Lee, a maestro with true vision and an artist's touch, someone able to magically capture powerful emotions with a few brush stroke, all the while getting across a strong sense of the time and place in which the story is unfolding.The acting made the whole enterprise rise to Nearly the top, however.  So my four stars is a tribute to all the wonderful actors (including those not mentioned in this review) who made this version of The Mayor of Casterbridge worth watching.And the one point taken away is for the clear lack of appreciation the director showed for the material handed him.",4,Good but  fast  Casterbridge,1140998400,"02 27, 2006",2006,6418,"['enjoyed', 'version', 'Mayor',

Ciaran Hinds (Rome, Phantom of the Opera, Persuasion)is perfect for the role of the Mayor, who, as a young man, and completely inebriated, auctions off his wife and baby daughter to the highest bidder. (A passing sailor takes her and the baby, and they leave the area). When he sobers up, he realizes what he has done, and makes a promise never to drink for 21 years. 19 years later, the wife is now a widow, and she comes to find him, in hopes of obtaining help.  She finds that he has done quite well as a merchant, and is now the mayor of the town of Castorbridge. The movie moves on through the next few years, with twists and turns in the plot.

Everyone you come to care about in this film, and apparently the novel, goes through terrible pain.It starts with Michael Henchard (Ciaran Hinds) selling his wife and baby girl.  Such `sales' did occur at the time as a method of divorce and, as shown, the wife had to agree to it.  She also usually knew who would buy her.  When the next morning Henchard swears off alcohol I thought good, a tale of redemption.  Henchard becomes the mayor of Casterbridge and, when his wife and daughter return, I am convinced it will all turn out right.

767229,A2NJO6YE954DBH,B0000AQS3P,Lawrance M. Bernabo,"[11, 13]","I have an affinity for Greek tragedies and Thomas Hardy's ""The Mayor of Casterbridge"" is decidedly in that tradition.  I know that Hardy was interested in writing a novel that would combine his love of history with his love of Dorsetshire, but I find it hard to believe that he did not know something about the elements of classical Greek tragedy given everything that happens in this novel.  You have ""hubris"" (excessive pride), you have ""harmartia"" (tragic flaw), you have ""anagnorisis"" (recognition) and ""peripeteia"" (reveral), all of which you find in ""Oedipus Rex"" and all of which play critical roles in ""The Mayor of Casterbridge.""A drunken Michael Henchard (Ciar&aacute;n Hinds) auctions off his wife, Susan (Juliet Aubrey) and infant daughter, Elizabeth-Jane to a kindly sailor.  The next day when he sobers up, Henchard realizes the enormity of what he has done and vows to not touch strong drink again for 21 years.  When Susan and a grown up Elizabeth-Jane (Jodhi May) come looking for him nineteen years later, after the sailor Newson is lost at sea, they find that serving as the mayor of the town of Casterbridge.  In due course he learns their identity and arranges not only to take care of them, but to again live as husband and wife with Susan.  However, although he confides in Donald Farfrae (James Purefoy), about his past, Henchard wants his dark secret to stay secret, and he and Susan agree to keep the truth from Elizabeth-Jane.Henchard's sense of pride and his fear of having his shame made public, drive him throughout this story, but it seems the Fates have it out for him as his shame and secrets become more and more entwined.  Every time it looks like Henchard has done something honorable, another twist is unveiled, as in his relationship with Lucetta Templeman (Polly Walker), and he finds another new level of hell on earth to endure.  Complicating things are not only Henchard's business dealings with Farfrae but the young man's interest in Elizabeth-Jane.  Henchard, who is poignantly given the final word in the production, seems as trapped as any Greek tragic hero, where all of his actions inevitably bring disaster and despair.  Hinds provides a strong performance that allows us to condemn Henchard for his folly but still feel sympathy for his plight, fully aware that he is going to pay for all of his sins in some horrible way that only the gods could inflict on a human being.  We also feel for his daughter, especially given May's touching performance as Elizabeth-Jane.This mini-series version of ""The Mayor Casterbridge"" is much shorter than the 1978 version with Alan Bates in the title role, but that seems to just result in a more focused tragedy (I also find Hinds's performance to be superior because I can better buy Henchard's strengths of character). The first part ends on a particularly painful peripeteia that convinces you Henchard will never find happiness.  But then one of the hallmarks of great tragedy is that you can see the horrible end coming, and the second part follows Henchard as he destroys everything he once held dear.  That he pronounces his own fate and final just desserts only makes his demise all the more touching.",5,Thomas Hardy's Greek tragedy played out in Casterbridge,1101859200,"12 1, 2004",2004,3197,"['have', 'affinity', 'Greek', 'tragedies', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', 'decidedly', 'tradition', 'know', 'Hardy', 'was', 'interested', 'writing', 'novel', 'would', 'combine', 'love', 'history', 'love', 'Dorsetshire', 'find', 'hard', 'believe', 'did', 'not', 'know', 'something', 'elements', 'classical', 'Greek', 'tragedy', 'given', 'everything', 'novel', 'have', 'hubris', 'excessive', 'pride', 'have', 'harmartia', 'tragic', 'flaw', 'have', 'anagnorisis', 'recognition', 'peripeteia', 'reveral', 'find', 'Oedipus', 'Rex', 'play', 'critical', 'roles', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', 'A', 'drunken', 'Michael', 'Henchard', 'Ciar', 'aacute', 'Hinds', 'auctions', 'wife', 'Susan', 'Juliet', 'Aubrey', 'infant', 'daughter', 'Elizabeth-Jane', 'kindly', 'sailor', 'next', 'day', 'when', 'up', 'Henchard', 'enormity', 'what', 'done', 'vows', 'not', 'touch', 'strong', 'drink', 'again', '21', 'years', 'When', 'Susan', 'grown', 'up', 'Elizabeth-Jane', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'come', 'looking', 'nineteen', 'years', 'later', 'sailor', 'Newson', 'lost', 'sea', 'find', 'serving', 'mayor', 'town', 'Casterbridge', 'due', 'course', 'identity', 'not', 'only', 'take', 'care', 'again', 'live', 'husband', 'wife', 'Susan', 'However', 'Donald', 'Farfrae', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'past', 'Henchard', 'dark', 'secret', 'stay', 'secret', 'Susan', 'agree', 'keep', 'truth', 'Elizabeth-Jane.Henchard', 'sense', 'pride', 'fear', 'having', 'shame', 'made', 'public', 'drive', 'story', 'Fates', 'have', 'out', 'shame', 'become', 'more', 'more', 'entwined', 'time', 'Henchard', 'done', 'something', 'honorable', 'twist', 'unveiled', 'relationship', 'Lucetta', 'Templeman', 'Polly', 'Walker', 'new', 'level', 'hell', 'earth', 'endure', 'Complicating', 'things', 'are', 'not', 'only', 'Henchard', 'business', 'dealings', 'Farfrae', 'young', 'man', 'interest', 'Elizabeth-Jane', 'Henchard', 'who', 'poignantly', 'given', 'final', 'word', 'production', 'as', 'trapped', 'Greek', 'tragic', 'hero', 'where', 'actions', 'inevitably', 'bring', 'disaster', 'despair', 'Hinds', 'strong', 'performance', 'condemn', 'Henchard', 'folly', 'still', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'plight', 'fully', 'aware', 'going', 'pay', 'sins', 'horrible', 'way', 'only', 'gods', 'could', 'inflict', 'human', 'being', 'also', 'feel', 'daughter', 'especially', 'given', 'May', 'touching', 'performance', 'Elizabeth-Jane.This', 'mini-series', 'version', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', 'much', 'shorter', '1978', 'version', 'Alan', 'Bates', 'title', 'role', 'just', 'result', 'more', 'focused', 'tragedy', 'also', 'find', 'Hinds', 'performance', 'be', 'superior', 'can', 'better', 'buy', 'Henchard', 'strengths', 'character', 'first', 'part', 'particularly', 'painful', 'peripeteia', 'Henchard', 'will', 'never', 'find', 'happiness', 'then', 'one', 'hallmarks', 'great', 'tragedy', 'can', 'see', 'horrible', 'end', 'coming', 'second', 'part', 'Henchard', 'everything', 'once', 'held', 'dear', 'own', 'fate', 'final', 'just', 'only', 'demise', 'more', 'touching']",N/A

Susan Henchard (Juliet Aubrey) is so humiliated and embarrassed by her drunken husband's behavior (combined with his history of bad temper), that she agrees to the sale, becoming from then on the wife of the sailor Newson. She takes off her wedding band and sets it in front of Henchard with a sad, lost look in her eyes while Henchard greedily grabs the 5 guineas off the table and stuffs them in his pocket. When he awakens the next morning to find them gone and realizes what he has done, he swears an oath to God he will not touch alcohol for the space of 21 years, but when his &quot;wife &amp; daughter&quot; come to find him 19 years later, will they find him changed...?A&amp;E did an excellent job on this Thomas Hardy adaptation; it is accurate to the original story (although I did feel some moments and scenes were cut too short to allow the full effect to seep in), but I still feel it is well done on the whole. The acting is superb with Ciaran Hinds dominating in his role as the tyrannical Michael Henchard; also excellent is Jodhi May as the sweet Elizabeth Jane (Mirah in Daniel Deronda), Polly Walker as Lucetta (Jane Fairfax in Gwenyth's Emma), and James Purefoy as the Scotsman Donald Farfrae.

Their lot together worsens as they sit eating that evening, in a tent, surrounded by farmers marketgoers. The husband is obviously in his cups, the woman makes one sensible remark too many to him, and, in a temper he offers to sell her to the highest bidder. She finds a buyer during this mock slave auction, and as she is fed up with it all, seeing no future other than the past, she makes little effort to dissuade him, and takes the hand of a kindly sailor who makes the highest offer. It is not long afterward, that he realizes what he has done, and is grief stricken. This will become a too-familiar pattern throughout his life.  He also leaves word at the same farmer's market with a subject he knows will always be there, for his wronged wife, should she return looking for him - which she ultimately does, but much later.It takes 19 years, but the next chapter of the saga begins, and thereby lies the tale.  It is about a man who, after moving on from the sale of his wife that day, becomes mayor of a small farming town, establishes a wheat trading point, and would have been respectable and complete in his own right had he been able to rein in the dark insecurities that seem to completely control him.  He recognizes talent where he sees it, in the personable young stranger (portrayed by James Purefoy) he meets one evening at the Inn - a stranger who shows him the way to reconstitute moldy wheat, and Henchard offers him a job as his market manager, but he cannot rest once he discovers the younger man is more progressive, proactive and forward thinking than he is.  He begins to compensate for the jealousies that begin to devour him by attempting to best the young man's ideas as they come up, which not only is impossible, but renders him a fool in the eyes of others in the process.  His emotional illness is like a runaway train, picking up steam. Many a solid truth is uttered by this tormented man; we know he has it in him, but he just can't make it stay.The supporting cast of characters provide excellent performances throughout; the cast-off, world-weary mother who has borne more trouble than any one person should be asked to do; the obedient, winsome daughter who has had virtually no life of her own; a beautiful femme fatale who comes out of the sordid shadows of the past under the cloak of respectability; the handsome, brilliant, soft-spoken Scotsman, (James Purefoy) master of everything he touches including love, who becomes the nemesis of our mayor just because of who he is within.This was an enchanting story and I was immediately drawn into it by it's splendid cast, it's remarkable storyline that contained many twists of fate.The remainder of the story deals with the final insult: the complete loss of pride beneath his own feet.  It was larger than he was, after all.This is for those who enjoy romantic Olde English Countryside tales a La Jane Eyre - so if that is for you, I recommend it as a very good, if somewhat lengthy movie.",5,Self-Made and Self-Destructive,1294358400,"01 7, 2011",2011,3232,"['two', 'obviously', 'destitute', 'people', 'walking', 'down', 'road', 'mist', 'Englsh', 'countryside', 'surly', 'desperate', 'man', 'Ciaran', 'Hinds', 'Michael', 'Henchard', 'superb', 'role', 'followed', 'downcast', 'chastised', 'woman', 'carrying', 'babe', 'arms', 'lot', 'together', 'sit', 'eating', 'evening', 'tent', 'surrounded', 'farmers', 'marketgoers', 'husband', 'obviously', 'cups', 'woman', 'one', 'sensible', 'remark', 'too', 'many', 'temper', 'sell', 'highest', 'bidder', 'buyer', 'mock', 'slave', 'auction', 'fed', 'up', 'seeing', 'future', 'other', 'past', 'little', 'effort', 'dissuade', 'hand', 'kindly', 'sailor', 'who', 'highest', 'offer', 'not', 'long', 'afterward', 'what', 'done', 'grief', 'stricken', 'will', 'become', 'too-familiar', 'pattern', 'life', 'also', 'word', 'same', 'farmer', 'market', 'subject', 'will', 'always', 'be', 'there', 'wronged', 'wife', 'should', 'return', 'looking', 'ultimately', 'much', 'later.It', '19', 'years', 'next', 'chapter', 'saga', 'thereby', 'tale', 'man', 'who', 'moving', 'sale', 'wife', 'day', 'mayor', 'small', 'farming', 'town', 'wheat', 'trading', 'point', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'respectable', 'complete', 'own', 'right', 'had', 'been', 'able', 'rein', 'dark', 'insecurities', 'seem', 'completely', 'control', 'talent', 'where', 'personable', 'young', 'stranger', 'portrayed', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'one', 'evening', 'Inn', 'stranger', 'who', 'way', 'reconstitute', 'moldy', 'wheat', 'Henchard', 'job', 'market', 'manager', 'can', 'not', 'rest', 'once', 'younger', 'man', 'more', 'progressive', 'proactive', 'forward', 'thinking', 'compensate', 'jealousies', 'begin', 'devour', 'attempting', 'best', 'young', 'man', 'ideas', 'come', 'up', 'not', 'only', 'impossible', 'fool', 'eyes', 'others', 'process', 'emotional', 'illness', 'runaway', 'train', 'picking', 'up', 'steam', 'solid', 'truth', 'uttered', 'tormented', 'man', 'know', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'make', 'stay.The', 'supporting', 'cast', 'characters', 'provide', 'excellent', 'performances', 'cast-off', 'world-weary', 'mother', 'who', 'borne', 'more', 'trouble', 'one', 'person', 'should', 'be', 'asked', 'do', 'obedient', 'winsome', 'daughter', 'who', 'had', 'virtually', 'life', 'own', 'beautiful', 'femme', 'fatale', 'who', 'sordid', 'shadows', 'past', 'cloak', 'respectability', 'handsome', 'brilliant', 'soft-spoken', 'Scotsman', 'James', 'Purefoy', 'master', 'everything', 'including', 'love', 'who', 'nemesis', 'mayor', 'just', 'who', 'within.This', 'was', 'enchanting', 'story', 'was', 'immediately', 'drawn', 'splendid', 'cast', 'remarkable', 'storyline', 'contained', 'many', 'twists', 'fate.The', 'remainder', 'story', 'deals', 'final', 'insult', 'complete', 'loss', 'pride', 'own', 'feet', 'was', 'larger', 'was', 'all.This', 'who', 'enjoy', 'romantic', 'Olde', 'English', 'Countryside', 'La', 'Jane', 'Eyre', 'so', 'recommend', 'very', 'good', 'somewhat', 'lengthy', 'movie']",N/A

However, the bottom line is that this adaptation is oddly paced, and largely overacted. Jodhi May, who was outstanding in Daniel Deronda just previous to this production, was miss cast as Elizabeth-Jane. Her heaving breath, hunched shoulders, and facial expressions are overly dramatic and irritate throughout. One scene that did show how good it might have been, takes place in Part I between Henchard and Donald Farfrae when Henchard confides the haunting truth of his sin against his wife and child. Unfortunately in the end, there just isn't enough good to make this production compelling enough beyond filler until something better arrives.",3,Bleak Story & Over Acted,1281484800,"08 11, 2010",2010,1050,"['Perhaps', 'simply', 'do', ""n't"", 'appreciate', 'Thomas', 'Hardy', 'plotlines', 'fan', '19th', 'century', 'classic', 'British', 'literature', 'productions', 'find', 'Hardy', 'Mayor', 'Casterbridge', 'bleak', 'break', 'lacking', 'sophistication', 'character', 'so', 'Austen', 'Gaskell', 'Dickens', 'Carroll.It', 'could', 'be', 'A', 'E', 'production', 'screenplay', 'written', 'Ted', 'Whitehead', 'failed', 'capture', 'essence', 'Hardy', 'words', 'However', 'bottom', 'line', 'adaptation', 'oddly', 'paced', 'largely', 'overacted', 'Jodhi', 'May', 'who', 'was', 'outstanding', 'Daniel', 'Deronda', 'just', 'previous', 'production', 'was', 'miss', 'cast', 'Elizabeth-Jane', 'heaving', 'breath', 'hunched', 'shoulders', 'facial', 'expressions', 'are', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'irritate', 'One', 'scene', 'did', 'show', 'how', 'good', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'place', 'Part', 'Henchard', 'Donald', 'Farfrae', 'when', 'Henchard', 'haunting', 'truth', 'sin', 'wife', 'child', 'Unfortunately', 'end', 'just', ""n't"", 'enough', 'good', 'make', 'production', 'compelling', 'enough', 'filler', 'something', 'better', 'arrives']",N/A
