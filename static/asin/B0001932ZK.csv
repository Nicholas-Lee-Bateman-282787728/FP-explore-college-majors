While I will admit there are some interesting scenes, the movie really doesn't pick up  until the very end when the music kicks in for the credits. Its just so haunting. Unfortunatly, I cannot say the same for the rest of the movie. To make a long story short, my opinion is if you do happen to decide to pick this movie up, don't expect greatness.

796717,A328S9RN3U5M68,B0001932ZK,Grady Harp,"[17, 18]",QUICKSAND is a terrific action drama that wears a good script well acted by a strong cast headed by Michael Keaton and Michael Caine and well directed by fully in-control Director John Mackenzie.  The topic of money laundering is particularly timely at this point in our history so gathering information about the ins and outs of this type of scam is apropos.  Michael Keaton is an obsessive-compulsive American investigator sent to France in his role as investigator and ends up being setup as an accused assassin.  He is forced into escape and into hiding until he uncovers the truth about the company under investigation (actually a porn industry) and with the help of a has-been actor (played superlatively by Michael Caine) finds a way out.  The mechanisms for this good guy-bad guy chase and intrigue make for edge-of-the seat suspense.  Not a great movie but certainly one  of the better intrigue films greatly enhanced by a strong cast of supporting actors in excellent cameo roles.

And I'm now throughly convinced the French are completely insane. I have no idea how this country produced Catherine Deneuve and Genevieve Bujold, none.The last 10-15 years have showcased singularly unappealing, unbelievable and wholly unattractive female lead actresses. I now believe this is intentional - the same way some dog owners pick canines that are universally ugly and then espouse that you must see beyond the superficial and see the ""inner"" beauty.And in most instances I agree. But action films, and movies in general, require some degree of superficiality - I mean, c'mon, they're MOVIES. These aren't documentaries.But oh no, not the French, beaut&eacute; int&eacute;rieure est la vraie beaut&eacute;.The plot is, as many reviewers have already noted, formulaic and pedestrian. But I give kudos to Keaton for doing his best with a limited vehicle. And Michael Caine? Not even sure poor Michael Caine was even in this production. Too bad too, because it's his limited and pitch perfect performance that was most enjoyable.However, the choice for lead actress - yikes. Suffice to say they could've used the aforementioned ugly mutt to fill in her role, making this 'Turner & Hooch The Sequel'. And you know what - it might've worked. And how sad is that?If this were released in 1991 - I believe it would've been pretty good and not destined as a direct-to-video product. As it was 2003...well...

On the way to the first tee the first C was pretty much yelled about one of the players. Fantastic you know it's gonna be a great day. Shockingly, the first 5 holes went without incident. Then we came to the sixth hole.After being explicitly told to fight his true nature to maintain a 4:1 ratio of shots hit to shots counted and just hit one shot and move on, Santa shanked a 5 iron into the sand. Sid was on the other side of the fairway and did  not see Santa drop another ball and hit a shot into a mud pit hazzard. Upon pulling the cart to where Santa stood, we saw a yellow rope. Lost on Santa, this means DO NOT FREAKING GO HERE. Then we saw this buffoon walking in the mud with what looked like mud covered shoes. Sid said ""what are you doing?"" ""My shoes!"" Santa said, pointing to two gashes in the mud. Then the realization came that this mess of a human stepped in the mud, stepped out and his shoes stayed behind. Looking on in amazement, Santa was seen digging with his hands through hot wet smelly mud to retrieve sweet nike golf shoes. However, while digging, Santa started sinking through mud that had been cultivated from heavy rain recently and 2 weeks of 90+ degree weather. As he sank in to almost his knee Santa screamed out ""ITS'S QUICKSAND!"" Sid replied ""They're just f**king shoes get out of there!"" But no, Santa finally got out and got the shoes. He then put them back on, went to the sand trap and hit the shot he should of in the first place. And with muddy shoes, socks, and legs, Santa played at his jolly worst for the final 12 holes.I guess you could look at this story 2 ways. Was it an abosolutely stupid thing to do? Yes yes. But, if he has nothing else, Santa has resolve. Who else would have played 12 more holes of golf after an incident like that?
