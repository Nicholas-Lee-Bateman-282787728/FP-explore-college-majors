And although the actors do try hard, I felt that the writing wasn't up to their efforts. Usually the case in disappointing movies. Neither was the sound that good. Savage and Kinski deserved better material, better lines, better sound recording equipment. Also, FOUR screenwriters? What did they do, take a vote on what to have the characters do next?  And Carradine's character seemed more like a cariacture, especially with that dog. However, the two classic Harley motorcycles used in the movie looked swell. As for the art director, why didn't they take any time with the set? The interior of the HUGE HOUSE where Maria lived with her granny looked like an abandoned mansion awaiting a buyer. Kinski's bedroom was entirely devoid of any personal touches. I've seen jail cells and monks quarters with more warmth than the room ""Maria"" spent her entire girlhood in. What was she, Amish?The Exterior locations saved the movie from utter despair. Thank God for picking a decent visual background.

677972,A15W2D3WJW7NP7,B00005R5GI,Pork Chop,"[1, 2]","MARIA'S LOVERS (1984), was a hit, and frequently shown in thetheatres, back in the day of its release. Comprising famous starsfrom that time, Nastassja Kinski, Robert Mitchum and John Savage,the reputations of all 3 was extremely merited, considering theoutstanding job the actors did in bringing this work to life. AnitaMorris also packs a tremendous presence, as well, to the screen,with dancing action and intense looks, interacting very well, too,with the others, alternating between a hysterical, artificial callgirl of sorts, with a more serious, affectionate conduct.Clearly, not all people in an audience finds a sentimental,romantic movie appealing, that underlines the ephemeral nature ofvarious stages in one's life, (death, birth, the crossing from ayouthful maturity into married adulthood, and the need to make theright choice for the relationship to work.)The author shows an extreme skill in crafting a story about arelationship between a man and a woman, before and after themarriage, the challenges, changes and discoveries occuringthereafter among the partners. It also tells how old habitssometimes die hard, such as the urge for spontaneous romanticrelationships between other men and/or women even after the formalunion is made. As before, this show the character oscillating oneand another partner depending on which brings the most excitementat the time, etc.We see Kinski plaging a girl who easily infatuates, and capturesthe sentimental imaginations of men, who are on the same wavelength as her own, that she projects unknowingly or not. At thesame time, Savage is the husband, who is unable to move beyond oreven cope with, those 2 feelings, both before, during and aftertheir marriage.Unable to progress to a deeper, more meaningful emotional andmental rapport with Kinski, Savage, reaching for immediate answersand relief (like for an Aspirin), finds the solution in simplegirls of his own socio-economic background with which he was raisedand is comfortable in all aspects.While all this is happening, isolated between her aging mother, hercareer as a maternity ward nurse and as a neglected married woman,Kinsky turns to casual romantic encounters with a handful of menwho can read her situation instinctively, and can satisfy herartistic and other impulses.The cinematography is impeccable, with a sharp, clear transfer toDVD, even after 20 years, the movie doesn't seem to have aged atall, on screen, especially from the timeless, idyllic tiny rural UStown depicted. The automobiles, homes, clothes worn, layout of thetown all convincingly shows that these are the 1950's or early60s.With Savage playing a veteran of the Second World War, releasedfrom a Japanese POW camp, the movie wisely refrains from touchingupon the military life for more than only a few brief moments, toavoid opening up a Pandora's box of pre-judgements, experiences,struggles, hazings, isolation, stress, or memories of overcrowdedconditions of such a canp experience, that otherwise would distractfrom the story.Keith Carradine plays a ambulant musician, bringing some accousticguitar numbers, and a bit of humor and outside perspective to thestory, that otherwise would have obviously been more introverted,intensely personal, occuring between Kinsky and Savage.",4,"Challenges, changes and discoveries occuring before, during and after marriage",1270166400,"04 2, 2010",2010,3273,"['MARIA', 'LOVERS', '1984', 'was', 'hit', 'frequently', 'shown', 'thetheatres', 'back', 'day', 'release', 'Comprising', 'famous', 'starsfrom', 'time', 'Nastassja', 'Kinski', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'John', 'Savage', 'reputations', '3', 'was', 'extremely', 'merited', 'considering', 'theoutstanding', 'job', 'actors', 'did', 'bringing', 'work', 'life', 'AnitaMorris', 'also', 'tremendous', 'presence', 'as', 'well', 'screen', 'dancing', 'action', 'intense', 'looks', 'interacting', 'very', 'well', 'too', 'others', 'alternating', 'hysterical', 'artificial', 'callgirl', 'sorts', 'more', 'serious', 'affectionate', 'conduct.Clearly', 'not', 'people', 'audience', 'sentimental', 'romantic', 'movie', 'appealing', 'ephemeral', 'nature', 'ofvarious', 'stages', 'one', 'life', 'death', 'birth', 'crossing', 'ayouthful', 'maturity', 'married', 'adulthood', 'need', 'make', 'theright', 'choice', 'relationship', 'work', 'author', 'extreme', 'skill', 'crafting', 'story', 'arelationship', 'man', 'woman', 'themarriage', 'challenges', 'changes', 'discoveries', 'occuringthereafter', 'partners', 'also', 'how', 'old', 'habitssometimes', 'die', 'hard', 'such', 'urge', 'spontaneous', 'romanticrelationships', 'other', 'men', 'and/or', 'women', 'even', 'formalunion', 'made', 'before', 'show', 'character', 'oscillating', 'oneand', 'partner', 'depending', 'most', 'excitementat', 'time', 'etc.We', 'see', 'Kinski', 'plaging', 'girl', 'who', 'easily', 'capturesthe', 'sentimental', 'imaginations', 'men', 'who', 'are', 'same', 'wavelength', 'own', 'projects', 'unknowingly', 'not', 'thesame', 'time', 'Savage', 'husband', 'who', 'unable', 'move', 'oreven', 'cope', '2', 'feelings', 'marriage.Unable', 'progress', 'deeper', 'more', 'meaningful', 'emotional', 'andmental', 'rapport', 'Kinski', 'Savage', 'reaching', 'immediate', 'answersand', 'relief', 'Aspirin', 'solution', 'simplegirls', 'own', 'socio-economic', 'background', 'was', 'raisedand', 'comfortable', 'happening', 'isolated', 'aging', 'mother', 'hercareer', 'maternity', 'ward', 'nurse', 'neglected', 'married', 'woman', 'Kinsky', 'casual', 'romantic', 'encounters', 'handful', 'menwho', 'can', 'read', 'situation', 'instinctively', 'can', 'satisfy', 'herartistic', 'other', 'impulses.The', 'cinematography', 'impeccable', 'sharp', 'clear', 'transfer', 'toDVD', 'even', '20', 'years', 'movie', ""n't"", 'seem', 'have', 'aged', 'atall', 'screen', 'especially', 'timeless', 'idyllic', 'tiny', 'rural', 'UStown', 'depicted', 'automobiles', 'homes', 'clothes', 'worn', 'layout', 'thetown', 'convincingly', 'are', '1950', 'early60s.With', 'Savage', 'playing', 'veteran', 'Second', 'World', 'War', 'Japanese', 'POW', 'camp', 'movie', 'wisely', 'military', 'life', 'more', 'only', 'few', 'brief', 'moments', 'toavoid', 'opening', 'up', 'Pandora', 'box', 'pre-judgements', 'experiences', 'struggles', 'hazings', 'isolation', 'stress', 'memories', 'overcrowdedconditions', 'such', 'canp', 'experience', 'otherwise', 'would', 'distractfrom', 'story.Keith', 'Carradine', 'ambulant', 'musician', 'bringing', 'accousticguitar', 'numbers', 'bit', 'humor', 'outside', 'perspective', 'thestory', 'otherwise', 'would', 'have', 'obviously', 'been', 'more', 'introverted', 'intensely', 'personal', 'occuring', 'Kinsky', 'Savage']",N/A
677973,A1SVXJZ3386U2D,B00005R5GI,Randy Keehn,"[0, 0]","I rented ""Maria's Lovers"" because Robert Mitchum was in the cast.  I've come to understand that his presence does not always guarantee a good movie and ""Maria's Lovers"" was a reminder of that fact.  This movie had potential but it failed to deliver because things just didn't fit together well.  For example, there wasn't any real purpose for Mitchum's role.  He played a part that was bigger than necessary and I assume his expanded role was to draw more viewers (like myself).  His role could have been easily played by a person like Maria's mother or grandmother or whomever that silent old woman in the house was.  The different scenes did not flow together well.  If our main character was disfunctional in certain areas was it necessary to have to say the same about the movie?Keith Caradine was a ""character"" who served a purpose but even that was extraneous to my perception of the plot.  It was that perception that gave me the sense of a good foundation for a movie while that same perception was my biggest diappointment since the film dropped the ball on delivering on that perceived plot.  Consider; A WWII veteran comes home from the Pacific where, with several subtle hints, we discover that he had spent a good deal of time in a Japanese prison camp.  While in that prison camp, his connection to reality was his blissfully imagined relationship with a girl he had met a few times back home.  Once home his hopes were realized but he was unable to live out those dreams because the greatest terror he experienced was intricately woven together with the greatest desire he had ever felt. Love was victimized by its' origins and we spend pretty much the bulk of the movie watching his feeble attempts to resolve his dilemna.  There's an ending but by that time I had lost interest.",3,Long on promise and short on delivery,1290297600,"11 21, 2010",2010,1795,"['rented', 'Maria', 'Lovers', 'Robert', 'Mitchum', 'was', 'cast', ""'ve"", 'come', 'understand', 'presence', 'not', 'always', 'guarantee', 'good', 'movie', 'Maria', 'Lovers', 'was', 'reminder', 'fact', 'movie', 'had', 'potential', 'failed', 'deliver', 'things', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'fit', 'together', 'well', 'example', 'was', ""n't"", 'real', 'purpose', 'Mitchum', 'role', 'played', 'part', 'was', 'bigger', 'necessary', 'assume', 'expanded', 'role', 'was', 'draw', 'more', 'viewers', 'role', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'easily', 'played', 'person', 'Maria', 'mother', 'grandmother', 'whomever', 'silent', 'old', 'woman', 'house', 'was', 'different', 'scenes', 'did', 'not', 'flow', 'together', 'well', 'main', 'character', 'was', 'disfunctional', 'certain', 'areas', 'was', 'necessary', 'have', 'say', 'same', 'movie', 'Keith', 'Caradine', 'was', 'character', 'who', 'served', 'purpose', 'even', 'was', 'extraneous', 'perception', 'plot', 'was', 'perception', 'gave', 'sense', 'good', 'foundation', 'movie', 'same', 'perception', 'was', 'biggest', 'diappointment', 'film', 'dropped', 'ball', 'delivering', 'perceived', 'plot', 'Consider', 'A', 'WWII', 'veteran', 'home', 'Pacific', 'where', 'several', 'subtle', 'hints', 'discover', 'had', 'spent', 'good', 'deal', 'time', 'Japanese', 'prison', 'camp', 'prison', 'camp', 'connection', 'reality', 'was', 'blissfully', 'imagined', 'relationship', 'girl', 'had', 'met', 'few', 'times', 'back', 'home', 'Once', 'home', 'hopes', 'were', 'realized', 'was', 'unable', 'live', 'out', 'dreams', 'greatest', 'terror', 'experienced', 'was', 'intricately', 'woven', 'together', 'greatest', 'desire', 'had', 'ever', 'felt', 'Love', 'was', 'victimized', 'origins', 'spend', 'pretty', 'much', 'bulk', 'movie', 'watching', 'feeble', 'attempts', 'resolve', 'dilemna', 'ending', 'time', 'had', 'lost', 'interest']",N/A
