572481,A2SLA0SXRQV8M0,B000059H7C,Andres C. Salama,"[0, 0]","Akira Kurosawa's last film, from 1993, didn't attract a lot of attention when first released, perhaps because the Japanese master was already a bit out of fashion among the critics and the public in the 1990s, but this is among his best movies. Kurosawa was 83 when he directed this (he would die five years later) so in many ways this is a film about old age and about dying, but is far from somber or depressing - it's hard to think of a more elegiac film about death (it is also, of course, a film about life).The movie's protagonist is Hyakken Uchida (1889-1971), who was a real Japanese professor of German Literature, but in many ways he is in the movie an alter ego of Kurosawa, an aging master facing old age and death. Uchida is kind hearted sometimes to the point of naivete. Plotwise, not much really happens in this slow but rewarding film - we see Uchida the day of his retirement, facing the destruction of his home during World War II, celebrating with his former students each year in a party, finally facing illness and old age. Perhaps the biggest incident in the movie is when Uchida loses his cat. But if the plot seems slight, the movie stands out as a beautiful piece of humanist filmmaking. The quietly beautiful photography and mise en scene certainly helps.",5,A little known masterpiece,1336608000,"05 10, 2012",2012,1282,"['Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'last', 'film', '1993', 'did', ""n't"", 'attract', 'lot', 'attention', 'when', 'first', 'released', 'perhaps', 'Japanese', 'master', 'was', 'already', 'bit', 'fashion', 'critics', 'public', '1990s', 'best', 'movies', 'Kurosawa', 'was', '83', 'when', 'directed', 'would', 'die', 'five', 'years', 'later', 'so', 'many', 'ways', 'film', 'old', 'age', 'dying', 'far', 'somber', 'depressing', 'hard', 'think', 'more', 'elegiac', 'film', 'death', 'also', 'course', 'film', 'life', 'movie', 'protagonist', 'Hyakken', 'Uchida', '1889-1971', 'who', 'was', 'real', 'Japanese', 'professor', 'German', 'Literature', 'many', 'ways', 'movie', 'alter', 'ego', 'Kurosawa', 'aging', 'master', 'facing', 'old', 'age', 'death', 'Uchida', 'kind', 'hearted', 'sometimes', 'point', 'naivete', 'Plotwise', 'not', 'much', 'really', 'slow', 'rewarding', 'film', 'see', 'day', 'retirement', 'facing', 'destruction', 'home', 'World', 'War', 'II', 'celebrating', 'former', 'students', 'year', 'party', 'finally', 'facing', 'illness', 'old', 'age', 'Perhaps', 'biggest', 'incident', 'movie', 'when', 'Uchida', 'cat', 'plot', 'slight', 'movie', 'out', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'humanist', 'filmmaking', 'quietly', 'beautiful', 'photography', 'mise', 'en', 'scene', 'certainly']",N/A

It is the story of a full life that takes place after most would say that life is over, the story of a teacher's experiences after retirement -- filled with drama, heartbreak, tragedy, joy and the love and devotion of his former students, who care for the aging man and his loyal wife, giving him a birthday party each year in which part of the ritual becomes the cry and response of his students chanting: Maadha Kai (ready?) and his reply: Madadayo (not yet!) -- he is not ready to die.In the film's final scene, several students watch over the professor as he sleeps. He has been ill and they wonder what he is dreaming about. We become privy to the dream -- the professor is a young boy playing hide-and-seek. The children are waiting for him to hide, calling out Maadha Kai (are you ready?) and as he searches in the hay piles for a place to hide, he replies Madadayo (not yet), until he is distracted by the beautiful sky, and pauses to look at the surreal swirling clouds.One cannot see this film without thinking of Kurosawa himself, surrounded by those who loved and respected him, enjoying life, looking back and dreaming of his past (Akira Kurosawa's Dreams had come out three years before). A lovely film which will be enjoyed by many but appreciated most by Kurosawa fans.DVD extras include a trailer, filmographies and 6 beautiful watercolor storyboard illustrations.

I saw this film in 1997 (4 years after it was made.  It didn't get distribution here in the States), and was struck about how funny, touching, and humanistic it was.  And how wonderful.  It really has a lot in common with Kurosawa's 2 other films from this period (Dreams and Rhapsody in August), in that it's more humanistic and loving that Akira's previous films, which were bleak in their assessment of human nature (but were still great films).  A great director/artist like Kurosawa never says ""this is my final film"" because if he did, he'd be finished.  He thought like this after the financial failure of Dodeskaden (he tried to kill himself shortly thereafter.  Luckily, he failed).  He did not die, and he went on to make 6 more films, several of which (Dersu Uzala, Ran, Dreams, and this film) are masterpieces.  The drinking party in the middle of the film is one of Kurosawa's greatest sequences.  It's brilliantly shot, acted, and edited together.  Kurosawa was very fond of using multiple cameras, which enabled him to allow the actors to be freer and not have to repeat themselves in subsequent takes.  This is gloriously rendered in the drinking party scene.

I understand that he wanted to write a kind of final love letter to his fans and admirers and students, but this one went just a bit too far for my tastes. Kurosawa is not a stranger to saccharine sentimentality (witness REDBEARD), but this one went a step too far in its Pollyanna-like optimism. Faced with the tragedy of WWII (briefly covered and hardly mentioned), the literature professor who is the film's protagonist rises above his setbacks with his steadfast stoicism and optimism and the help of his loving male students who shower him with admiration, gifts, land, and a new home. I had thought Spielberg the master of the cloyingly sweet movie, but it looks as if he learned his nausea-inducing licks from the old master himself.

The hero is a professor, played by Tatsuo Matsumura.  (The Japanese word for teacher is ""sensei"" and it is a title of the highest honor.  So sad that ""teacher"" is not a title of honor in American society.)The Sensei is retiring.  Many of his final students are the children of earlier students, and they all love and respect the old man.  The older ex-students clamor around the Sensei's house, sharing old stories and finally coming up with the idea to have an annual birthday celebration.We watch the first celebration - attended only by the adult male former students who stand one at a time to offer some praise to the retired professor.  It gradually degenerates into a loud drunken cha-cha line which results in the wartime occupying American MPs being called.  I was relieved that the G.I.s take one look at the good-natured celebration, share a laugh themselves, then leave the revelers to their party.At the end of the film we see the last birthday party for the Sensei, two decades after his retirement from teaching.  The students still remember and love the Professor, but now the party is attended by wives and children and grandchildren.  I marveled that so many years after his retirement, in a country that had gone through war and bombing and plague and pestilence, the Professor had generated such respect in his students that they still honored him years after his retirement.The cozy home the Professor shares with his wife is destroyed in the bombing of World War II, and they move to a shack at the edge of the smoldering town ruins, but still the dutiful students come by to pay their respects.There is not really much plot to be found, and much of the action consists of sitting around tables talking.

And what a monumental waste of time this is--so unrealistically sentimental as to make one wince at times. The use of near amateurs in minor roles does not help. This story (such as it is) is about a retired teacher whose former students (who all happen to live nearby, apparently) remain devoted to him, in a sort of Christ-and-his-disciples relationship. They visit frequently, build him a new home after the War, hold lavish birthday parties for him (and spend 30 minutes of screen time helping him look for his lost cat). What makes these students so devoted is never explored at all--Kurosawa just expects us to take it as fact. This leads to the painful conclusion that ""Madadayo"" depicts Kurosawa's idealization of himself: as a kind old man inspiring continuing devotion in his former proteges. ""Madadayo"" also explains why Beat Takeshi and others in the new generation of talented Japanese filmmakers had become so disgusted with Kurosawa toward the end of his career. --MellowMonk.com",1,"The ""Godfather 3"" of the Kurosawa canon",1133654400,"12 4, 2005",2005,1263,"['are', 'fan', 'Kurosawa', 'am', 'then', 'avoid', 'film', 'costs', 'nothing', 'more', 'depressing', 'seeing', 'once-great', 'director', 'who', 'revolutionized', 'filmmaking', 'examined', 'powerful', 'human', 'themes', 'reduced', 'making', 'sentimental', 'nonsense', 'Madadayo', 'what', 'monumental', 'waste', 'time', 'so', 'unrealistically', 'sentimental', 'make', 'one', 'wince', 'times', 'use', 'near', 'amateurs', 'minor', 'roles', 'not', 'help', 'story', 'such', 'retired', 'teacher', 'former', 'students', 'who', 'happen', 'live', 'nearby', 'apparently', 'remain', 'devoted', 'sort', 'Christ-and-his-disciples', 'relationship', 'visit', 'frequently', 'build', 'new', 'home', 'War', 'hold', 'lavish', 'birthday', 'parties', 'spend', '30', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'helping', 'look', 'lost', 'cat', 'What', 'students', 'so', 'devoted', 'never', 'explored', 'Kurosawa', 'just', 'take', 'fact', 'painful', 'conclusion', 'Madadayo', 'Kurosawa', 'idealization', 'kind', 'old', 'man', 'inspiring', 'continuing', 'devotion', 'former', 'proteges', 'Madadayo', 'also', 'why', 'Beat', 'Takeshi', 'others', 'new', 'generation', 'talented', 'Japanese', 'filmmakers', 'had', 'become', 'so', 'disgusted', 'Kurosawa', 'end', 'career', 'MellowMonk.com']",N/A

572495,A16QODENBJVUI1,B000059H7C,Robert Moore,"[0, 0]","My love for Akira Kurosawa knows no bounds.  I've watched and rewatched many of his films a half dozen times, while I've watched SEVEN SAMURAI perhaps twenty times.  As much as I love these others, I'm not a fan of MADADAYO.  The story is a heavily didactic one, meant to inform Japanese youth (he stated that all of his films were directed to the youth of Japan) the joy of valuing one's elders.It is hard to ignore the importance of this message for Kurosawa, since he felt that he had been unfairly neglected by the younger generation of Japanese directors.  The roots to this feeling ran deep and originated in the late 1940s when he was was only in his late thirties.  The studio at which he had received his apprenticeship, Toho, had been racked by a series of strikes.  The heads of Toho were particularly concerned to rid the studio of leftist influences.  Although Kurosawa himself was a man with leftist sympathies (though he was by no means a joiner of parties), his rather unsystematic politics involved embracing a mix of rather traditional liberal ideals in conjunction with a distrust of consumer societies and corporatism.  Although he had been involved with the Communist Party in the early thirties and he had been pressured to be involved in a post-WW II socialist film (THOSE WHO MAKE TOMORROW) that he later dissociated himself from, his politics was personal and rather unsystematic.  The studio certainly had no desire to fire Kurosawa and made no efforts to do so.  The assistant directors, however, who had been among the leaders of the strike, were fired by the studio, and blackballed from further involvement in cinema in Japan.  Kurosawa was heartbroken.  The apprentice system in Japan, whereby a fledgling director learned at the feet of an established director (as Kurosawa had at the feet of his beloved Yama-san, Kajir Yamamoto), was at the heart of Japanese cinema.  Firing the assistant directors not only denied them an opportunity to make an impact on Japanese movies, it robbed Kurosawa of his chance to nurture his own apprentices.  After the strikes, the apprentice system was not reinstated.But this was not the only reason Kurosawa felt that his relationship with a younger generation of directors was strained.  The Japanese New Wave directors had been scathingly critical of him.  And after Toho severed their connection with him, his films would not come out consistently for the rest of his life (after 23 movies in the 22 years of his career, he would finish only 7 in the final 33 years of his life.  Although some younger directors would patch things up with him - most notably Nagisa Oshima, who had been savagely critically of him earlier in his career, demonstrated a newfound respect for him, even conducting a two-hour interview for Japanese television - he nonetheless felt that proper respect had not been shown him.Given all this, MADADAYO can be read in a couple of ways.  One, it can be shown as a statement of regret that he had not been shown the kind of respect that Professor Uchida's students show him. Second, it can be read as a statement of the way in which students ought to show respect to their sensei.  Japan's younger directors had not shown proper respect to Kurosawa, but they should have done.Although the context for the one that anyone who loves Kurosawa can sympathize with, nonetheless this is not among Kurosawa's better films.  It is not an out and out bad film.  As Donald Richie has correctly said, Kurosawa never made any uninteresting movies, even though he sometimes made some that were not terribly good ones.  I find many scenes in this one fail to hold my attention.  Only a couple of scenes really moved me.  I enjoyed the search for the cat Alley and it was interesting to see the professor to move from one house to another.  I liked the students agreeing to buy the empty lot next door to the professor's house.  I got a kick out of two of the students checking out the professor's house after they hear that the house had been broken into often in the past with previous tenants.  They discover a sign reading for thieves.  But there are no scenes that will remind anyone of Kurosawa's best films.  Kurosawa changed cinema.  But there is little of that brilliance in this film.  The nearest to a truly interesting moment comes in the first large ""Not Yet"" parties.  The scene is filmed with three cameras fitted with telephoto lenses.  Two are filming opposite of each other, one from the back of the room toward the professor while the other is back to the room.  It is fun trying to figure out where the cameras must be.  Finally, it becomes obvious that they must be way up in the scaffolding shooting over the back of the wall over the back of each wall.  But it was one of the few times when I felt challenged to figure out what Kurosawa was making magic.Like DREAMS and RHAPSODY IN AUGUST, this was a relatively small film after the enormous challenges of RAN.  Had he not broken his hip in 1995 he might have been able to make one last film, set in roughly the time period as his great 1957 film THE LOWER DEPTHS and dealing with the lives of streetwalkers.  It was to have starred Mieko Harada, who had been so memorable in RAN as Lady Kaede.  Even after breaking the hip he continued to plan the film, though one suspects more because he had the compulsion to do so rather than any real hope of getting it made.  So instead of that final, ambitious film, we have this quiet, unambitious, mellow film.  It could have been worse though I'm sure he could have done better.",3,A mellow final film by the world's greatest director,1284940800,"09 20, 2010",2010,5573,"['love', 'Akira', 'Kurosawa', 'bounds',

572498,A3FX9KYW53MRBD,B000059H7C,"Susan Hinojoza ""It's a full life.""","[20, 21]","As a fan of Kurosawa, I knew that I had to see his last film. The mixed reviews concerned me a bit. After viewing it, however, I am convinced it is one of his greatest works.On the surface, this is a story about a beloved and somewhat child-like (in a positive way) professor in the autumn of his life. It is a touching and at times seemly overly sentimental story. There are some laugh out loud moments--the scenes with the horse, the professor's attempts to foil  robbers and a student doggedly reciting all of the train stops along an extremely long route come to mind. The professor is quick-witted and warm, the acting exceptional.Many reviewers have already given more details on the plot, so I invite you to watch and look deeper. Although I am not one given to finding allegory everywhere, there are many subtleties here that I  assume are completely intentional. A director as great as Kurosawa does not randomly throw in images. So consider...The country of Japan has been torn by war, and so has the professor. We see the results of air raids--the Professor's own home and much of his town has been destroyed. The American occupation is causing changes in the Japanese way of life. Although there is no open criticism, the brief scenes involving Americans and their influences (watch for them!) show you that the Japanese characters find them incomprehensible and aren't sure what to make of them. Additionally, as the film progresses, there is a subtle influx of Western influences-more English words, American customs etc. The Professor is caught between the old Japan and the new. The scene between the kindly neighbor and the callous new landowner illustrate this.Nowhere is this conflict apparent than in the scene with the missing cat. At first, I thought that it was a little ridiculous to devote so much of the film the the search for a missing cat, and I thought it was over the top in sentimentality. But then, we are shown a few scenes of the professor imagining his lost cat trapped in a bombed-out ruin. Although the war has been over for a few years, the ruins are still smoldering-as if the bombs were recently dropped. The cat is trying to get home, but is confused and frightened. I realized the lost cat must be an symbol for Japanese people caught in the turmoil of a war-torn country in transition. What ultimately saves the Professor is the love and devotion of his students as well as his innate zest for life. When the Professor recovers from his depression, the once destroyed buildings in the background have been rebuilt. Can't be an accident!There are so many other subtleties here. Watch for the changing role of women, the use of English and German words, the clothing styles, the role of children, music etc. I believe you'll agree this is a great film.",5,Deeper than it seems,1078531200,"03 6, 2004",2004,2794,"['fan', 'Kurosawa', 'knew', 'had', 'see', 'last', 'film', 'mixed', 'reviews', 'concerned', 'bit', 'viewing', 'however', 'am', 'convinced', 'one', 'greatest', 'works.On', 'surface', 'story', 'beloved', 'somewhat', 'child-like', 'positive', 'way', 'professor', 'autumn', 'life', 'touching', 'times', 'seemly', 'overly', 'sentimental', 'story', 'are', 'out', 'loud', 'moments', 'scenes', 'horse', 'professor', 'attempts', 'foil', 'robbers', 'student', 'doggedly', 'reciting', 'train', 'stops', 'extremely', 'long', 'route', 'come', 'mind', 'professor', 'quick-witted', 'warm', 'acting', 'exceptional.Many', 'reviewers', 'have', 'already', 'given', 'more', 'details', 'plot', 'invite', 'watch', 'look', 'deeper', 'am', 'not', 'one', 'given', 'finding', 'allegory', 'everywhere', 'are', 'many', 'subtleties', 'here', 'assume', 'are', 'completely', 'intentional', 'director', 'as', 'great', 'Kurosawa', 'not', 'randomly', 'throw', 'images', 'So', 'consider', 'country', 'Japan', 'been', 'torn', 'war', 'so', 'professor', 'see', 'results', 'air', 'raids', 'Professor', 'own', 'home', 'much', 'town', 'been', 'destroyed', 'American', 'occupation', 'causing', 'changes', 'Japanese', 'way', 'life', 'open', 'criticism', 'brief', 'scenes', 'involving', 'Americans', 'influences', 'watch', 'show', 'Japanese', 'characters', 'find', 'incomprehensible', 'are', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'Additionally', 'film', 'subtle', 'influx', 'Western', 'influences-more', 'English', 'words', 'American', 'customs', 'etc', 'Professor', 'caught', 'old', 'Japan', 'new', 'scene', 'kindly', 'neighbor', 'callous', 'new', 'landowner', 'illustrate', 'conflict', 'apparent', 'scene', 'missing', 'cat', 'first', 'thought', 'was', 'little', 'ridiculous', 'devote', 'so', 'much', 'film', 'search', 'missing', 'cat', 'thought', 'was', 'top', 'sentimentality', 'then', 'are', 'shown', 'few', 'scenes', 'professor', 'imagining', 'lost', 'cat', 'trapped', 'bombed-out', 'ruin', 'war', 'been', 'few', 'years', 'ruins', 'are', 'still', 'smoldering-as', 'bombs', 'were', 'recently', 'dropped', 'cat', 'trying', 'get', 'home', 'confused', 'frightened', 'realized', 'lost', 'cat', 'must', 'be', 'symbol', 'Japanese', 'people', 'caught', 'turmoil', 'war-torn', 'country', 'transition', 'What', 'ultimately', 'Professor', 'love', 'devotion', 'students', 'as', 'well', 'innate', 'zest', 'life', 'When', 'Professor', 'recovers', 'depression', 'once', 'destroyed', 'buildings', 'background', 'have', 'been', 'rebuilt', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'accident', 'are', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'subtleties', 'here', 'Watch', 'changing', 'role', 'women', 'use', 'English', 'German', 'words', 'clothing', 'styles', 'role', 'children', 'music', 'etc', 'believe', ""'ll"", 'agree', 'great', 'film']",N/A
572499,A2B8GXSCB1R05T,B000059H7C,Zack Davisson,"[8, 8]","""Madadayo"" is an unflinchingly sentimental film, in the same vein as ""It's a Wonderful Life.""  It is a story that only an old man could have told, dealing with the love of growing old, and being surrounded by people who love you.  There is no bitterness in the Professor's growing old, only the satisfaction of a life well lived, that is not over yet.  It is an incredible, moving piece of art.The story is so simple, and deeply personal that connection is easy.  Starting at age 60, when the Professor is ""officially an old man,"" his former students through him a birthday party.  At the party, two things happen.  First, he must drink a very large glass of beer in one breath.  Second, his students ask him  ""Maadha kai?"" (""Are you ready?""), and he sings back ""Madadayo"" (""Not yet."")  Not yet ready to die.Like the characters in the story, I too loved the professor, and felt that something would be missing from the world, the day ""Madadayo"" does not come ringing back in response.  There are no villains, no life or death struggles, no sharp pains.  Just wonderful people being excellent to each other, and making the best out of their brief time alive.""Madadayo"" is also deeply rooted in Japanese culture and sympathies, and this is the first Kurosawa film that I have seen where I feel I have a deeper understanding due to my time spent living in Japan.  The enkais, the scenery, the values, it is all familiar.  And familiarity and nostalgia are largely what ""Madadayo"" is about.",5,Grow old in peace and love,1047340800,"03 11, 2003",2003,1486,"['Madadayo', 'unflinchingly', 'sentimental', 'film', 'same', 'vein', 'Wonderful', 'Life', 'story', 'only', 'old', 'man', 'could', 'have', 'told', 'dealing', 'love', 'growing', 'old', 'being', 'surrounded', 'people', 'who', 'love', 'bitterness', 'Professor', 'growing', 'old', 'only', 'satisfaction', 'life', 'well', 'lived', 'not', 'yet', 'incredible', 'moving', 'piece', 'art.The', 'story', 'so', 'simple', 'deeply', 'personal', 'connection', 'easy', 'Starting', 'age', '60', 'when', 'Professor', 'officially', 'old', 'man', 'former', 'students', 'birthday', 'party', 'party', 'two', 'things', 'happen', 'First', 'must', 'drink', 'very', 'large', 'glass', 'beer', 'one', 'breath', 'Second', 'students', 'ask', 'Maadha', 'kai', 'Are', 'ready', 'back', 'Madadayo', 'Not', 'yet', 'Not', 'yet', 'ready', 'die.Like', 'characters', 'story', 'too', 'loved', 'professor', 'felt', 'something', 'would', 'be', 'missing', 'world', 'day', 'Madadayo', 'not', 'come', 'ringing', 'back', 'response', 'are', 'villains', 'life', 'death', 'struggles', 'sharp', 'pains', 'Just', 'wonderful', 'people', 'being', 'excellent', 'other', 'making', 'best', 'brief', 'time', 'alive', 'Madadayo', 'also', 'deeply', 'rooted', 'Japanese', 'culture', 'sympathies', 'first', 'Kurosawa', 'film', 'have', 'seen', 'where', 'feel', 'have', 'deeper', 'understanding', 'due', 'time', 'spent', 'living', 'Japan', 'enkais', 'scenery', 'values', 'familiar', 'familiarity', 'nostalgia', 'are', 'largely', 'what', 'Madadayo', 'about']",N/A
