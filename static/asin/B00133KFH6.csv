Unfortunately, we were profoundly disappointed in this movie.  What could have been a wonderful store was fatally flawed by the open dishonesty of the adults.  First, rather than trying to work through the system to adopt David, when he shows up at their doorstep, they take him in and then have to hide David from the authorities.  They openly lied to the social worker when she suspected he was with the engineer and his wife.  Could any responsible person even remotely think they would have any chance at adoption after deceiving the authorities about the child?In defense of the engineer's wife, knowing that she was dying of cancer, she would know that she'd have no chance at adoption.  However, even that was selfish.  Here is a boy who had just lost his mother, and now the engineer's wife was trying to cultivate a loving relationship with the boy - only to leave him with another sudden loss of another significant woman in his life.  Such selfishness is inexcusable.  Could the boy ever form a mature relationship with a woman . . . to whom he would subconsciously be constantly expecting some tragedy to befall?For those with adopted kids, the movie is worth watching, but not one I would make an extra effort to seek out.  The thought kept occurring to me that this movie must be Kevin Bacon's effort to counteract any lingering impression of him as a child molester in the movie 'The Woodsman.'  In the end, he does go to the authorities with David, but we are fortunately spared the separation from him that David would certainly face after his surrogate parents deceived the system.",1,Fatally Flawed,1224979200,"10 26, 2008",2008,1742,"['wife', 'looked', 'forward', 'seeing', 'move', 'have', 'two', 'adopted', 'children', 'family', 'are', '36', 'adopted', 'children', 'Unfortunately', 'were', 'profoundly', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'What', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'wonderful', 'store', 'was', 'fatally', 'flawed', 'open', 'dishonesty', 'adults', 'First', 'rather', 'trying', 'work', 'system', 'adopt', 'David', 'when', 'up', 'doorstep', 'take', 'then', 'have', 'hide', 'David', 'authorities', 'openly', 'lied', 'social', 'worker', 'when', 'suspected', 'was', 'engineer', 'wife', 'Could', 'responsible', 'person', 'even', 'remotely', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'chance', 'adoption', 'deceiving', 'authorities', 'child', 'defense', 'engineer', 'wife', 'knowing', 'was', 'dying', 'cancer', 'would', 'know', ""'d"", 'have', 'chance', 'adoption', 'However', 'even', 'was', 'selfish', 'Here', 'boy', 'who', 'had', 'just', 'lost', 'mother', 'now', 'engineer', 'wife', 'was', 'trying', 'cultivate', 'loving', 'relationship', 'boy', 'only', 'leave', 'sudden', 'loss', 'significant', 'woman', 'life', 'Such', 'selfishness', 'inexcusable', 'Could', 'boy', 'ever', 'form', 'mature', 'relationship', 'woman', 'whom', 'would', 'subconsciously', 'be', 'constantly', 'expecting', 'tragedy', 'befall', 'adopted', 'kids', 'movie', 'worth', 'watching', 'not', 'one', 'would', 'make', 'extra', 'effort', 'seek', 'out', 'thought', 'kept', 'occurring', 'movie', 'must', 'be', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'effort', 'counteract', 'lingering', 'impression', 'child', 'molester', 'movie', 'Woodsman', 'end', 'go', 'authorities', 'David', 'are', 'fortunately', 'spared', 'separation', 'David', 'would', 'certainly', 'face', 'surrogate', 'parents', 'deceived', 'system']",Rails and Ties

Can't blame you really, it didn't make it to many screens, and there is a good reason, it was deplorably boring and depressing. However I am sure you guess from the title what the movie revolves around.After wondering if we will ever be saved by the suffering of Kevin Bacon movies that endlessly arrive at our doors, we are brought again to the helm of quashed-talent, only to be left short with a why-oh-why did this ever make it past pre-production. A solid cast couldn't save 'Rails and Ties', and a film like this has no saving grace and goes to show talent does not necessarily flow through the genes.'Rails and Ties' is the directorial debut of Alison Eastwood, none other than Clint Eastwood's daughter. With that aside, Rails and Ties tells the story of a train Conducter who's wife is fighting her own battle with terminal cancer, who slams into a car of a woman who drove it onto the tracks to commit suicide, and the boy of the now dead mother, who narrowly escapes from the wreckage, and yes as predictable as you may imagine, the couple wants to more or less, adopt the lad. The kid (played rather well by Miles Heizer) goes looking for the conductor for revenge and on ensuing sappy drama onfolds. Kevin Bacon's character let's the very adorable lad move in, fully aware he is illegally haboring the boy, all in the midst of missing persons flyers throughout the town.There is nothing short of nothing here. The film can't be saved by Harden and is so depressing throughout, it makes you want to go out yourself and drive to a railroad crossing and bon voyage.Saw it as it's premier at the Boston Film Festival, 2.5 at best.",2,"Clint Eastwood's daughter directorial debut, and boy is it disastrous!",1206403200,"03 25, 2008",2008,1678,"['Hmmm', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'much', 'film', 'Ca', ""n't"", 'blame', 'really', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'many', 'screens', 'good', 'reason', 'was', 'deplorably', 'boring', 'depressing', 'However', 'am', 'sure', 'guess', 'title', 'what', 'movie', 'around.After', 'wondering', 'will', 'ever', 'be', 'saved', 'suffering', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'movies', 'endlessly', 'arrive', 'doors', 'are', 'brought', 'again', 'helm', 'quashed-talent', 'only', 'be', 'left', 'short', 'why-oh-why', 'did', 'ever', 'make', 'pre-production', 'solid', 'cast', 'could', ""n't"", 'save', ""'Rails"", 'Ties', 'film', 'saving', 'grace', 'show', 'talent', 'not', 'necessarily', 'flow', 'genes', ""'Rails"", 'Ties', 'directorial', 'debut', 'Alison', 'Eastwood', 'none', 'other', 'Clint', 'Eastwood', 'daughter', 'aside', 'Rails', 'Ties', 'story', 'train', 'Conducter', 'who', 'wife', 'fighting', 'own', 'battle', 'terminal', 'cancer', 'who', 'car', 'woman', 'who', 'drove', 'tracks', 'commit', 'suicide', 'boy', 'now', 'dead', 'mother', 'who', 'narrowly', 'wreckage', 'yes', 'as', 'predictable', 'may', 'imagine', 'couple', 'more', 'less', 'adopt', 'lad', 'kid', 'played', 'rather', 'well', 'Miles', 'Heizer', 'looking', 'conductor', 'revenge', 'ensuing', 'sappy', 'drama', 'onfolds', 'Kevin', 'Bacon', 'character', 'let', 'very', 'adorable', 'lad', 'move', 'fully', 'aware', 'illegally', 'haboring', 'boy', 'midst', 'missing', 'persons', 'flyers', 'nothing', 'short', 'nothing', 'here', 'film', 'ca', ""n't"", 'be', 'saved', 'Harden', 'so', 'depressing', 'want', 'go', 'out', 'drive', 'railroad', 'crossing', 'bon', 'voyage.Saw', 'premier', 'Boston', 'Film', 'Festival', '2.5', 'best']",Rails and Ties

1140213,A328S9RN3U5M68,B00133KFH6,Grady Harp,"[8, 9]","RAILS & TIES, under the guidance of first time director Alison Eastwood, tackles an implausible subject of multiple tragedies resulting in repairing personal breaks and with the able assistance of a groups of excellent actors makes a finely tune, sensitive study of little lives struggling against major odds.  It is well conceived, well written (Micky Levy), well acted and sincerely moving.Tom Stark (Kevin Bacon) is a train engineer, married to his job as well as being married to his nurse wife Megan (Marcia Gay Harden) who is facing the ugly fact that her breast cancer is terminal.  The cancer has spread beyond Megan's body into the tenuous space that keeps a marriage glued: Megan attempts to hide her desperate need for emotional support by continuing to work as a nurse and Tom takes on extra train runs to avoid the reality that face him at home. The other side of the story is equally sad: young Davey Danner (Miles Heizer) cares of his psychologically shattered mother (Bonnie Root) and unknowingly accompanies her on a jaunt to 'see the train'  - a ploy well planned by the suicidal mother to drive in front of an oncoming train to end her life along with Davey's.  The conductor of the train is of course Tom Stark, and when Tom first sees the car on the tracks, he keeps to company policy that recommends gradual slowing rather than the danger of an abrupt stop: the result is the death of Davey's mother  but Davey escapes the crash while trying to pull his mother from the car.  The tragedies mount: Davey is left homeless, being placed in a foster home run by the cruel 'mom' (Margo Martindale) only to  escape to find the 'killer' of his mother; Tom is put on leave for the incident; Megan gets the final word that she has very little time left and is ready to leave the distant Tom.  It is this inadvertent entrance of Davey into the lives of Tom and Megan that results in a healing of three souls who are desperate for the connection of love.While some my find the story implausible and saccharine, others will appreciate the manner in which Eastwood holds rein on the story, playing it for quiet honesty instead of explosive situations. Both Bacon and Harden deliver the quality of sophisticated performances that have marked their careers, and the remainder of the cast gives strong support - especially Eugene Byrd, Marin Hinkle, Bonnie Root, Margo Martindale, and of course Miles Heizer. This is a tough story to tell but the film holds an indelible mark on the viewer.

Like, how about ""Kind Woman,"" my favorite Buffalo Springfield song, in the background at one point--lovely song, perfect placement? Among the most annoying aspects of much contemporary cinema (and TV too for that matter) is the spacious houses that the middle class live in. Roseanne's blue-collar kitchen was the size of the kitchen at the White House. This film is cramped, moving from a  small disheleved apartment to a small, crowded house, with a garage usurped by a model train. These are the lives of ordinary folks, living as best they can.The gripe against this film is probably that ""things are never so simple."" But I would argue that they often are, and only our narcissistic conceit makes them appear more complicated. People do best when they have someone to love and someone to love them. When a childless couple has allowed a wall to be erected, a child can enable them to not only focus on that child, but on each other as well. Love is, as I repeatedly say, not a feeling, but an action. This couple, broken and lonely and scared and isolated, found a way to look outside themselves at something larger. And in doing so, by placing someone other than themselves at the center of their universe, were able to remember why they married 15 years earlier. And the fact that Kevin Bacon had no father makes the pro-family message even more poignant. We learn how to father from our fathers; when two fatherless boys meet, one can grow into the father role, but only with lots of encouragement and love from his wife.Now, this film is far from perfect. Kevin Bacon, looking indeed like a young Clint, is given too little to do. I realize he is the brooding loner, who had to be goaded into dating his future wife, but there is too much silence and stasis in here. The ending was both predictable and way too pat. But the emotions were real. They worked. My wife wept several times throughout. Life isn't smooth. Easy. Or simple. But it can be worked on. It can be improved, even in ugly circumstances.

1140224,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B00133KFH6,Roland E. Zwick,"[0, 0]","As ""Rails and Ties"" opens, locomotive engineer Tom Stark (Kevin Bacon) is having the kind of day most of us wouldn't wish on our own worst enemy; his 41-year-old wife, Megan (Marcia Gay Harden), has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer, and a mentally ill young mother has committed suicide by parking her car directly in the path of the train he is conducting.  As is customary in such cases, Tom is put on temporary suspension pending an investigation of the crash.  He also has to come to terms with the imminent loss of his wife, who laments the fact that the couple never had a child and that she will die without ever having truly lived.  Meanwhile, the dead woman's 11-year-old son, Davey (Miles Heizer), who has miraculously escaped the tragedy (it was intended as a murder/suicide), seeks Tom out to confront him about running over his mother, but stays to find a surrogate family of sorts with Tom and Megan - with all the messy legal ramifications that that entails.Needless to say, given the plot as outlined above, ""Rails and Ties"" isn't exactly designed to be a passel of upbeat fun.  Still, those with a taste for serious, thoughtful, humanistic dramas will find much to cherish in this film.  The Micky Levy screenplay focuses, primarily, on the complex marital relationship of Tom and Megan, as they struggle with why Tom has never been able to fully commit himself to either the marriage or the prospect of being a father.Given all the various tragic elements that meet up in this single drama, the movie could easily have become awash in sentimentality and bathos.  Instead, the subtlety and restraint of Alison Eastwood's direction, along with the richly understated performances (especially by Harden), keep the suds from rising too much to the surface.  The result is a movie that deals authentically and truthfully with some highly unorthodox and rather touchy subject matter.

It's the story of four peoples lives that are changed by circumstances.  One part of the story is to do with breast cancer, the other with depression.  Both stories intertwine with each other through a bizare accident.  You could also say that it is a story of two women who must cope with personal tradgety, and how they each deal with it.  The acting is good but certainly not great other than the scenes that involve Miles Heizer (David), the pre-teen son of one of the women.  I found that his acting was very well done, especially in four different scenes where he had to act with different and somewhat difficult emotions.  For this, I think he should be commended.  Marcia Gay Harden I thought did a very good job with her part in this movie, as a woman who has to deal with breast cancer which has become terminal.  Some of her scenes are very realistic, having known people close to me who have suffered with this terrbile desease.  Lastly there is Kevin Bacon, and I could leave it at that.

This will most likely be a must see for any train people (both scale models and in passenger size). I can see the story has already been laid out in the other reviews, boring some and impressing others so I will stick with a production review.Kevin Bacon portrays hidden emotional tangents as well as always, he looked similar to his character from Woodsman (an often skipped but worthy film). His trademark walk/swagger shows through a couple of times but his performance was believable and in the end, convincing since he had to go from being emotionally stunted to a single parent in one week. Marcia Gay Harden was outstanding and gave her best performance to date as a dying, childless woman in a defunct marriage who had always yearned for a child. The child actor (Heizer) gave his first big performance in film here, and he does not disappoint. The roles of being caregiver to his suicidal mom, to a grieving homeless kid, to the acceptance of the man who drove the train that killed her, could not have been easy. He stumbles a few times but has the early workings and innocent face of a young River Phoenix.The deleted scenes were so relevant to back story and the kid's time being homeless, they should have been left in just to give something to the lead characters past and present dilemmas. The two actors (in these deleted parts) gave wonderful performances but appeared nowhere else in the film; I cannot even find their credits listed.At times, customers ask for a film that will uplift them and not make them cry, this film will not be the one I hand them. If they ask for that prolific ""good"" film with a solid story and believable characters, Rails and Ties will be on the list. The ending has been seen as a happy one, but I disagree. Spoilers following - their ambiguous stroll into that agency could only lead to misery, legal entanglements, people being fired, and probable separation - but I suppose it was the only way it could end realistically. The Eastwoods are known for their unhappy endings though, and I hope this DVD does not get overlooked.",4,Sorrowful film that stays real in the end...,1213488000,"06 15, 2008",2008,2182,"['roller', 'coaster', 'film', 'not', 'stray', 'away', 'difficult', 'movie', 'topics', 'suicide', 'cancer', 'will', 'most', 'likely', 'be', 'must', 'see', 'train', 'people', 'scale', 'models', 'passenger', 'size', 'can', 'see', 'story', 'already', 'been', 'laid', 'out', 'other', 'reviews', 'boring', 'impressing', 'others', 'will', 'stick', 'production', 'review.Kevin', 'Bacon', 'hidden', 'emotional', 'tangents', 'as', 'well', 'always', 'looked', 'similar', 'character', 'Woodsman', 'often', 'skipped', 'worthy', 'film', 'trademark', 'walk/swagger', 'couple', 'times', 'performance', 'was', 'believable', 'end', 'convincing', 'had', 'go', 'being', 'emotionally', 'stunted', 'single', 'parent', 'one', 'week', 'Marcia', 'Gay', 'Harden', 'was', 'outstanding', 'gave', 'best', 'performance', 'date', 'dying', 'childless', 'woman', 'defunct', 'marriage', 'who', 'had', 'always', 'yearned', 'child', 'child', 'actor', 'Heizer', 'gave', 'first', 'big', 'performance', 'film', 'here', 'not', 'disappoint', 'roles', 'being', 'caregiver', 'suicidal', 'mom', 'grieving', 'homeless', 'kid', 'acceptance', 'man', 'who', 'drove', 'train', 'killed', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'been', 'easy', 'few', 'times', 'early', 'workings', 'innocent', 'face', 'young', 'River', 'Phoenix.The', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'were', 'so', 'relevant', 'back', 'story', 'kid', 'time', 'being', 'homeless', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'left', 'just', 'give', 'something', 'lead', 'characters', 'past', 'present', 'dilemmas', 'two', 'actors', 'deleted', 'parts', 'gave', 'wonderful', 'performances', 'appeared', 'nowhere', 'else', 'film', 'can', 'not', 'even', 'find', 'credits', 'listed.At', 'times', 'customers', 'ask', 'film', 'will', 'uplift', 'not', 'make', 'cry', 'film', 'will', 'not', 'be', 'one', 'hand', 'ask', 'prolific', 'good', 'film', 'solid', 'story', 'believable', 'characters', 'Rails', 'Ties', 'will', 'be', 'list', 'ending', 'been', 'seen', 'happy', 'one', 'disagree', 'Spoilers', 'following', 'ambiguous', 'stroll', 'agency', 'could', 'only', 'lead', 'misery', 'legal', 'entanglements', 'people', 'being', 'fired', 'probable', 'separation', 'suppose', 'was', 'only', 'way', 'could', 'end', 'realistically', 'Eastwoods', 'are', 'known', 'unhappy', 'endings', 'hope', 'DVD', 'not', 'get', 'overlooked']",Rails and Ties
