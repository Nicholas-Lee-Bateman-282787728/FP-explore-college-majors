1268513,AA7W0CFRXF46L,B002HFWBI0,elfdart,"[3, 3]","being erica is a show about a woman who is disappointed with where her life has ended up and as a result ends up seeing this therapist who sends her back in time to reconcile herself with regrets she has about her past. i thought the concept for the show was pretty interesting and i thought that the events of the past she went back to reconcile were relatively universal landmarks that are relatable to the audience. she gets sent back to situations like her bat mitzfah, her first sexual experience, the university group that could have landed her her dream job, event that went both well and not so well with friends and family, and in one episode she was even sent back to before her birth to better understand her parents.one of the things i liked about this series was that at no point in any of the times erica goes back in time is she able to alter the chain of events that have happened. she has a list of regrets that the therapist, tom, sends her back to and she may change her perspective or may do something different from what she did in the past, but the resulting action that happened originally will still happen. the only difference is that she understands the situation for what it is and comes to realize that she is not to blame, or if she is, to own up to her faults and change her perspective or current actions to make things right. so really, even though this sounds sort of like a science fiction with all the time travel, it is more of erica's rumination of her life and the actions she takes to own her life and make it what she wants it to be.i thought that the characters were interesting and sufficient attention was paid to each of the minor characters. everyone in the show is given a story (minus erica's boss, who is discussed more in the second season) and everyone is given a little bit of depth. we learn about erica more and more with each episode as we see her struggle with her past, so needless to say that erica grows as a character and who we see at the beginning of the series is somewhat altered from the person who we see at the end. an interesting show to say the least.",4,pretty good,1268265600,"03 11, 2010",2010,2119,"['being', 'erica', 'show', 'woman', 'who', 'disappointed', 'where', 'life', 'ended', 'up', 'result', 'up', 'seeing', 'therapist', 'who', 'back', 'time', 'reconcile', 'regrets', 'past', 'i', 'thought', 'concept', 'show', 'was', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'i', 'thought', 'events', 'past', 'went', 'back', 'reconcile', 'were', 'relatively', 'universal', 'landmarks', 'are', 'relatable', 'audience', 'sent', 'back', 'situations', 'bat', 'mitzfah', 'first', 'sexual', 'experience', 'university', 'group', 'could', 'have', 'landed', 'dream', 'job', 'event', 'went', 'well', 'not', 'so', 'well', 'friends', 'family', 'one', 'episode', 'was', 'even', 'sent', 'back', 'birth', 'better', 'understand', 'parents.one', 'things', 'i', 'liked', 'series', 'was', 'point', 'times', 'erica', 'back', 'time', 'able', 'alter', 'chain', 'events', 'have', 'happened', 'list', 'regrets', 'therapist', 'tom', 'back', 'may', 'change', 'perspective', 'may', 'do', 'something', 'different', 'what', 'did', 'past', 'resulting', 'action', 'happened', 'originally', 'will', 'still', 'happen', 'only', 'difference', 'situation', 'what', 'realize', 'not', 'blame', 'own', 'up', 'faults', 'change', 'perspective', 'current', 'actions', 'make', 'things', 'right', 'so', 'really', 'even', 'sort', 'science', 'fiction', 'time', 'travel', 'more', 'erica', 'rumination', 'life', 'actions', 'own', 'life', 'make', 'what', 'be.i', 'thought', 'characters', 'were', 'interesting', 'sufficient', 'attention', 'was', 'paid', 'minor', 'characters', 'everyone', 'show', 'given', 'story', 'erica', 'boss', 'who', 'discussed', 'more', 'second', 'season', 'everyone', 'given', 'little', 'bit', 'depth', 'learn', 'erica', 'more', 'more', 'episode', 'see', 'struggle', 'past', 'so', 'needless', 'say', 'erica', 'grows', 'character', 'who', 'see', 'beginning', 'series', 'somewhat', 'altered', 'person', 'who', 'see', 'end', 'interesting', 'show', 'say', 'least']",N/A

Is it the Therapist/Angel/? constant use of quotations?  Is it the kicking soundtrack that is in sync to the time period?

1268516,A2PVZJY7E6454H,B002HFWBI0,"Lyn ""Lyn""","[14, 14]","We really love this series. It is about a 30 something girl (Erin Karpluk) who feels she isn't where she hoped to be by this age and her friends have passed her by. She has many regrets and thinks life could have worked out differently if she hadn't made a series of bad decisions. She does however have good friends including a separated male friend (Tyron Leitso), and an interesting Jewish family. Into her life walks a therapist- sort-of. He is of no fixed address in that his office can just turn up at any time when she is going about her business- or he will appear in the street dressed as some other profession. Is he an angel or a wise aspect of herself???Whatever he is, he has the power to throw her back into the pivotal regret points in her life so she can relive them and make other choices. While this doesn't necessarily change her history she grows and makes different choices no based on what she learns. This isn't all fairy floss either as her changed decisions may cause friction now rather than happy endings. Therapist also is a great quoter of wise sayings. In short this makes you think and is brimming with wisdom served in an easily digested package with some nice people to hang out with.We hope they keep making this series for years. This is season 1 but season 2 is now being made. We cant wait. btw I don't think it's even been shown on Australian TV where I am and we were lucky to stumble across it on DVD.

Being Erica may end up being another series like Firefly that many will be left wondering why they never heard of it.  It is witty, fun, full of wisdom and has a touch of sci-fi to it.  One of the downfalls of Being Erica may be that each episode is not a stand alone story encapsulating a large theme but is instead a story that requires, for the most part, the viewers to have watched most episodes to appreciate current ones.  This doesn't hold true for every episode as long as you have seen some of what transpired in the past but is generally true.
