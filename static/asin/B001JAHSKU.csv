It still played in my machines so no problem with the discs.  There are many reasons I would recommend the fifth season  (Jake turning into a surly teen, Jenny McCarthy (Melissa's sister) in a bravura performance, and the death of Teddy (Robert Wagner).  The real gem in this collection is a cultural exchange of CBS writers.  The episode centering on the wedding crime scene, was written by CSI writers, and has many of the CSI earmarks; down to the &#34;Who Are You&#34; theme song, aMENded by the male choir singing &#34;Men Men&#34;, in lieu of the usual &#34;Hoo Hoo&#34;.  Oh, and don't ask me what was on Teddy's Hoo Hoo, in that episode.  In the special features, there is a CSI episode written by Two and a Half Men writers.  A funnier than usual episode featuring Katey Sagal and Diedrich Bader as a Roseanne Barr/Tom Arnold couple; one of which dies...and that's probably all I should say without spoilers.
