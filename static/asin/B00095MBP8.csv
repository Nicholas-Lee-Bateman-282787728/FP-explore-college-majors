902004,AQ8DU6XVA3USJ,B00095MBP8,"Alejandra Vernon ""artist & illustrator""","[12, 14]","Bettina May and Go-Go Amy are a simply delightful duo. They are perfect vintage models with an updated twist. Both absolutely gorgeous and with flaming red hair, Go-Go Amy also has jet black highlights in her hair (stunning when hanging down in ringlets) and sports some nifty tattoos.They give you excellent tips, and modern techniques to achieve the vintage ""pin-up"" look. The makeup is really quite simple, and one you'll need to learn if you want to be an actress or dancer (retro is so ""In""!) or just have fun at your next party. The bright red of course is the way to go, on lips and fingernails. Most important of all, are the cat eyes! May demonstrates on Bettina the easiest way to get the ""cat eye"" line beyond your eye lids, and how to apply those stunning false eyelashes.The posing section is humorous and instructive, and the duo shows us how to make the most of our assets. I love the ""vowel"" smiles and expressions, and now I know the trick of why the pin-up girls looked so good kneeling back on their heels. It's quite  a little secret! (you have to have strong thigh muscles...and sit up a couple of inches from your heels, so the flab on the back of your thighs doesn't spill over, and your thigh muscles look long and lean!).This is a very cute and instructive DVD from these 2 delightful glamour gals. You'll enjoy every second of its 80 minute length.",5,Move Over Betty Grable...Here Comes...Me!,1281398400,"08 10, 2010",2010,1374,"['Bettina', 'May', 'Go-Go', 'Amy', 'are', 'simply', 'delightful', 'duo', 'are', 'perfect', 'vintage', 'models', 'updated', 'twist', 'absolutely', 'gorgeous', 'flaming', 'red', 'hair', 'Go-Go', 'Amy', 'also', 'jet', 'black', 'highlights', 'hair', 'stunning', 'when', 'hanging', 'down', 'ringlets', 'sports', 'nifty', 'tattoos.They', 'give', 'excellent', 'tips', 'modern', 'techniques', 'achieve', 'vintage', 'pin-up', 'look', 'makeup', 'really', 'quite', 'simple', 'one', ""'ll"", 'need', 'learn', 'want', 'be', 'actress', 'dancer', 'retro', 'so', 'just', 'have', 'fun', 'next', 'party', 'bright', 'red', 'course', 'way', 'go', 'lips', 'fingernails', 'Most', 'important', 'are', 'cat', 'eyes', 'May', 'Bettina', 'easiest', 'way', 'get', 'cat', 'eye', 'line', 'eye', 'lids', 'how', 'apply', 'stunning', 'false', 'eyelashes.The', 'posing', 'section', 'humorous', 'instructive', 'duo', 'how', 'make', 'most', 'assets', 'love', 'vowel', 'smiles', 'expressions', 'now', 'know', 'trick', 'why', 'pin-up', 'girls', 'looked', 'so', 'good', 'kneeling', 'back', 'heels', 'quite', 'little', 'secret', 'have', 'have', 'strong', 'thigh', 'muscles', 'sit', 'up', 'couple', 'inches', 'heels', 'flab', 'back', 'thighs', ""n't"", 'spill', 'thigh', 'muscles', 'look', 'long', 'lean', '.This', 'very', 'cute', 'instructive', 'DVD', '2', 'delightful', 'glamour', 'gals', ""'ll"", 'enjoy', 'second', '80', 'minute', 'length']","How to be a Pinup Model, with Bettina May and Go-Go Amy: Complete instruction in the makeup, hair styling and accessories required for the retro '40s/'50s pinup girl look!"

The techniques are pretty basic, stuff most people have probably seen before, but they add tips on how to use modern styling tools to create vintage looks. They use foam rollers for a wet set, which is good thinking.Another reviewer mentioned the editing, and it's definitely at a slower pace than most  tutorials I've seen. Each look is made up of one long shot, and that's appropriate for a vintage piece, convention-wise. I don't meant make it sound like the production value is low, because it's fine, but there are some little quirks about this video:  ladies look sort of nervous on camera, the camera is handheld, and there's a lot of big band going on.

Makeup, hair, and cheesecake-posing; exactly what the video promises. I loved the hairstyle secion the most. They do an entire hair set, and then when she is combing the set out, it's real-time and I got the sense of the fifties, no cellphones, no rush, pretty night-table, sweet smiles. I felt like I was at a sleep-over and we were doing our hair in Grease. I adored the big hair-rolls they demo'd. These two women fully embrace the fifties lifestyle. And they portray a sexy-lady without apology. The make-up section was a bit long in the tooth, but great for beginners. The posing section was really nice and encouraging too. It's very girls-night-out-with-class and the production value, tho simple, was just right; great, authentic 50s set-dressing, good audio, and most of all inspirational. If you like the fifties and want to try your hand (gams?) at cheesecake photos, or even just want to investigate the fifties look - and outlook - this is a comforting, stylish & feminine place to get started.",5,Retro-Cute from Start to Finish,1279584000,"07 20, 2010",2010,1138,"['Keeping', 'mind', 'pure-retro', 'loved', 'how', 'meandering', 'pace', 'was', 'not', 'mtv-flash', 'editing', 'honestly', 'very', 'fifties', 'Makeup', 'hair', 'cheesecake-posing', 'exactly', 'what', 'video', 'loved', 'hairstyle', 'secion', 'most', 'do', 'entire', 'hair', 'set', 'then', 'when', 'combing', 'set', 'out', 'real-time', 'got', 'sense', 'fifties', 'cellphones', 'rush', 'pretty', 'night-table', 'sweet', 'smiles', 'felt', 'was', 'sleep-over', 'were', 'doing', 'hair', 'Grease', 'adored', 'big', 'hair-rolls', 'demo', ""'d"", 'two', 'women', 'fully', 'embrace', 'fifties', 'lifestyle', 'portray', 'sexy-lady', 'apology', 'make-up', 'section', 'was', 'bit', 'long', 'tooth', 'great', 'beginners', 'posing', 'section', 'was', 'really', 'nice', 'encouraging', 'too', 'very', 'girls-night-out-with-class', 'production', 'value', 'tho', 'simple', 'was', 'just', 'right', 'great', 'authentic', '50s', 'set-dressing', 'good', 'audio', 'most', 'inspirational', 'like', 'fifties', 'want', 'try', 'hand', 'gams', 'cheesecake', 'photos', 'even', 'just', 'want', 'investigate', 'fifties', 'look', 'outlook', 'comforting', 'stylish', 'feminine', 'place', 'get', 'started']","How to be a Pinup Model, with Bettina May and Go-Go Amy: Complete instruction in the makeup, hair styling and accessories required for the retro '40s/'50s pinup girl look!"
