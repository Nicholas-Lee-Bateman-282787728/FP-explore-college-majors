763120,A259W5KIP41XFL,B0000AGWSC,Jennifer A. Everhart,"[1, 5]","Let's just say I am a huge fan of the works of music legend, John Williams, most notable for the scores of Jaws, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, E.T., Jurassic Park, Home Alone, Harry Potter, the list goes on. I also enjoy Christmas as well. The time of good will, family, friends, and giving. Speaking of which, I also received the Home Alone boxed set in my stocking as well as others. This Box set includes all four Home Alone movies in two cases with two movies per case. The original film was released in 1990. It was directed by Chris Columbus, written and produced by the late comic legend John Hughes. It stars Macaulay Culkin as a troubled boy called Kevin McCallister whose family doesn't understand him. After a tiff with the mean older brother Buzz (Devin Ratray) stealing Kevin's pizza, he wished for his family to disappear. The wish came true since his family accidentally left him behind while rushing to the airport for a Christmas vacation in Paris. Kevin sees what it is like to be on his own for the first time, especially when a duo of thieves, Harry and Marv (Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern respectively) are robbing homes and the McCallister house is next. Kevin discovers this and sets up comical traps to defend his home and leads to get them arrested in the end. Kevin's mother, Kate (Catherine O'Hara) realized they accidentally left Kevin behind and was determined to find him at all costs, with the help of Gus Polinski (John Candy). On Christmas morning, Kevin's family makes it back and they and Kevin reconcile. The sequel, Lost in New York, picks up where the first left off one year later and almost everyone has returned, with some newcomers. After Buzz plays a payback prank on Kevin for accidentally trashing his room in the first during a Christmas Pageant, Kevin wished to be on his own again. The next morning at the airport, Kevin was duped into hitching the wrong plane and found himself in New York. Kevin borrows his family's money to check into the Plaza Hotel, but the concierge, Mr. Hector (Tim Curry), suspects that the credit card was stolen ans sends his employees to get him. If that's not enough, the Wet Bandits escaped from prison to plan a heist at Duncan's Toy Chest and Kevin hones his trap-setting skills to save the charity money with more violent and clever traps that were still hilarious. Kevin's family finds him again and everyone wins except the Wet Bandits. The first two were just as good as one another, but in slightly different ways. The first has more of a holiday feel to it and the second was a little darker, edgier, and more serious for a Christmas movie, but they are similar. The third tries to bring in a new protagonist, Alex Pruitt (Alex D. Linz) who was left home alone with chicken pox while his mother runs errands, and uses traps and tricks to stop a gang of thieves from getting their hands on a lethal missle microchip hidden in a remote truck that can lead to world domination. When it would feature completely different characters, almost everyone dropped out, especially Culkin. Only John Hughes and Raja Gosnell stayed on. The third wasn't that good, but at least not horrible. It may have provided with a few yutz, but I missed everyone else and it was basically a clone of the first. Then we get to the made-for-T.V. fourth spin-off film and it just flat out sucks. It is when Kevin (Mike Weinberg) visits his father, Pete, and his girlfriend, Natalie, with a smart house that is being targeted by Marv (French Stewart) and his new sidekick (Missi Pyle) and Kevin deals with them once again. The continuity was messed up, the jokes and traps are not funny, everyone was miscast and different, and it was plagued with cheap one-liners like ""House, clean yourself up. Well, at least I tried"", for example. Same story, same climax, what a load of poo-poo platter, and probably the worst Christmas movie since Santa Conquers the Martians and The Star Wars Holiday Special. French Stewart playing as Marv was absurd. When Stern played Marv in the first two, he was a funny doofus with a hilarious scream, but he knew the fourth was gonna blow. With Stewart as the character, he was criminal mastermind instead, and that just ruins the movie for me. When it comes to his other piece of trash sequel, Inspector Gadget 2, I say I'd come to expect that. Get this for the first two, but sell the fourth while you have the chance.",3,Only in it for the first two,1261785600,"12 26, 2009",2009,4401,"['Let', 'just', 'say', 'am', 'huge', 'fan', 'works', 'music', 'legend', 'John', 'Williams', 'most', 'notable', 'scores', 'Jaws', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'E.T.', 'Jurassic', 'Park', 'Home', 'Alone', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'list', 'also', 'enjoy', 'Christmas', 'as', 'well', 'time', 'good', 'will', 'family', 'friends', 'giving', 'Speaking', 'also', 'received', 'Home', 'Alone', 'boxed', 'set', 'stocking', 'as', 'well', 'others', 'Box', 'set', 'four', 'Home', 'Alone', 'movies', 'two', 'cases', 'two', 'movies', 'case', 'original', 'film', 'was', 'released', '1990', 'was', 'directed', 'Chris', 'Columbus', 'written', 'produced', 'late', 'comic', 'legend', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Macaulay', 'Culkin', 'troubled', 'boy', 'called', 'Kevin', 'McCallister', 'family', ""n't"", 'understand', 'tiff', 'mean', 'older', 'brother', 'Buzz', 'Devin', 'Ratray', 'stealing', 'Kevin', 'pizza', 'wished', 'family', 'disappear', 'wish', 'came', 'true', 'family', 'accidentally', 'left', 'rushing', 'airport', 'Christmas', 'vacation', 'Paris', 'Kevin', 'what', 'be', 'own', 'first', 'time', 'especially', 'when', 'duo', 'thieves', 'Harry', 'Marv', 'Joe', 'Pesci', 'Daniel', 'Stern', 'respectively', 'are', 'robbing', 'homes', 'McCallister', 'house', 'next', 'Kevin', 'up', 'comical', 'traps', 'defend', 'home', 'get', 'arrested', 'end', 'Kevin', 'mother', 'Kate', 'Catherine', ""O'Hara"", 'realized', 'accidentally', 'left', 'Kevin', 'was', 'determined', 'find', 'costs', 'help', 'Gus', 'Polinski', 'John', 'Candy', 'Christmas', 'morning', 'Kevin', 'family', 'back', 'Kevin', 'reconcile', 'sequel', 'Lost', 'New', 'York', 'up', 'where', 'first', 'left', 'off', 'one', 'year', 'later', 'almost', 'everyone', 'returned', 'newcomers', 'Buzz', 'payback', 'prank', 'Kevin', 'accidentally', 'trashing', 'room', 'first', 'Christmas', 'Pageant', 'Kevin', 'wished', 'be', 'own', 'again', 'next', 'morning', 'airport', 'Kevin', 'was', 'duped', 'hitching', 'wrong', 'plane', 'found', 'New', 'York', 'Kevin', 'family', 'money', 'check', 'Plaza', 'Hotel', 'concierge', 'Mr.', 'Hector', 'Tim', 'Curry', 'credit', 'card', 'was', 'stolen', 'ans', 'employees', 'get', 'not', 'enough', 'Wet', 'Bandits', 'escaped', 'prison', 'plan', 'heist', 'Duncan', 'Toy', 'Chest', 'Kevin', 'trap-setting', 'skills', 'save', 'charity', 'money', 'more', 'violent', 'clever', 'traps', 'were', 'still', 'hilarious', 'Kevin', 'family', 'again', 'everyone', 'wins', 'Wet', 'Bandits', 'first', 'two', 'were', 'just', 'as', 'good', 'one', 'slightly', 'different', 'ways', 'first', 'more', 'holiday', 'feel', 'second', 'was', 'little', 'darker', 'edgier', 'more', 'serious', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'are', 'similar', 'third', 'tries', 'bring', 'new', 'protagonist', 'Alex', 'Pruitt', 'Alex', 'D.', 'Linz', 'who', 'was', 'left', 'home', 'alone', 'chicken', 'pox', 'mother', 'errands', 'traps', 'tricks', 'stop', 'gang', 'thieves', 'getting', 'hands', 'lethal', 'missle', 'microchip', 'hidden', 'remote', 'truck', 'can', 'lead', 'world', 'domination', 'When', 'would', 'feature', 'completely', 'different', 'characters', 'almost', 'everyone', 'dropped', 'out', 'especially', 'Culkin', 'Only', 'John', 'Hughes', 'Raja', 'Gosnell', 'stayed', 'third', 'was', ""n't"", 'that', 'good', 'least', 'not', 'horrible', 'may', 'have', 'provided', 'few', 'yutz', 'missed', 'everyone', 'else', 'was', 'basically', 'clone', 'first', 'Then', 'get', 'made-for-T.V', 'fourth', 'spin-off', 'film', 'just', 'flat', 'out', 'sucks', 'when', 'Kevin', 'Mike', 'Weinberg', 'father', 'Pete', 'girlfriend', 'Natalie', 'smart', 'house', 'being', 'targeted', 'Marv', 'French', 'Stewart', 'new', 'sidekick', 'Missi', 'Pyle', 'Kevin', 'deals', 'once', 'again', 'continuity', 'was', 'messed', 'up', 'jokes', 'traps', 'are', 'not', 'funny', 'everyone', 'was', 'miscast', 'different', 'was', 'plagued', 'cheap', 'one-liners', 'House', 'clean', 'up', 'Well', 'least', 'tried', 'example', 'Same', 'story', 'same', 'climax', 'what', 'load', 'poo-poo', 'platter', 'probably', 'worst', 'Christmas', 'movie', 'Santa', 'Conquers', 'Martians', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Holiday', 'Special', 'French', 'Stewart', 'playing', 'Marv', 'was', 'absurd', 'When', 'Stern', 'played', 'Marv', 'first', 'two', 'was', 'funny', 'doofus', 'hilarious', 'scream', 'knew', 'fourth', 'was', 'gon', 'na', 'blow', 'Stewart', 'character', 'was', 'criminal', 'mastermind', 'instead', 'just', 'movie', 'When', 'other', 'piece', 'trash', 'sequel', 'Inspector', 'Gadget', '2', 'say', ""'d"", 'come', 'expect', 'Get', 'first', 'two', 'sell', 'fourth', 'have', 'chance']",Home Alone: Complete Caper Collection: (Home Alone / Home Alone 2: Lost in New York / Home Alone 3 / Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House)

This set holds a special place in our hearts, because it was filmed in Winnetka, one of our neighboring communities near our home in Illinois.  We are big fans of anything John Hughes has ever made, and this one is one of our favorites.  The young Macaulay is the perfect character for the part of an overlooked at times because of a large family, yet very grown-up for his age because of his older siblings, young boy.  The home this movie was in, recently was put on the market and sold for a few million dollars.  There was a news article on one of our local channels who interviewed the elderly couple who owned the home and had said the house in the movie was made to look like it had an entrance in the back leading to the basement, which in fact was not an entrance at all.  It was a shed or some other outdoor structure original to the home.  It fascinated to me to learn this.  It looks, for all intents and purposes, like the basement entrance was always there.  But, that's Hollywood for you.....  The movie and it's sequels are like a blast from the past to me.  They bring back many happy memories of when our kids were little and how we used to do things together as a family.  Now everyone, well almost everyone is grown up and on their own.

All the fans that love the movie as much I as do can all be happy because it's finally out on DVD.Home Alone tells the story of Kevin McCallister. He's one of the youngest memebers of the McCallister family and he gets a lot of crap put on him. The family is planning on going to Florida for a special Christmas. He is left home by accident. The McCallister neighborhood is being hit by robbers. The robbers know the McCallister's are in Florida and plan on taking the house. Will Kevin be able to stop the thieves or will they rob his house? You'll just have to watch that and find out.Macaulay Culkin is awesome in the movie. It's one of the best movies he ever did, and for a while he was a house hold name in the early 90's. He did such a good job playing Kevin. After watching it I think half the kids in America wanted to be left Home Alone to see if they could stop bad guys. I know I did.Joe Pecsi is funny in the movie. I think it's one of the better roles he ever did. He doesn't do a lot of family films. Joe will leave you in tears as you see him and his partner endure the beating they take.Home Alone is a great family film. It's a great christmas film. Every kid in the world should see this movie.

And like all of the previous sets, they have ignored the fact that the first 2 movies where the best, the first Home Alone is a 4 or 5 star comedy, and part 2 wasnt as good, but it's still ok. The first 2 where smash hits, and great movies, you might even call them classics. But where poorly misstreated when they where brought to DVD. First off, there in Fullscreen, not Widescreen, they dont look like they have been remastered too good. And there is no bonus features apart from a trailer.Why is there no bonus features with home alone 1 & 2? There is plenty to put on them, there where heaps of featurettes done when both of the films came out, so where are those now? And why isnt there any reunion footage, or audio commentery or something? The trailer also shows clearly that there is a few deleted scenes and alternate takes or extended scenes... so where is all that stuff? Why is it the only disc with bonus features is part 3 and 4. Part 4 was ok, but no where near as good as the other 2, and part 4, god, dont get me started on how bad that movie was. Yet they fill the 2 useless ones with heaps of bonus features, but cant go find the bonus features you would actualy want to see.Dont bother buying this box set. Unless you dont care that there are no bonus features, and you just want the movie's themself, then ok, by this. or wait a few months for another box set edition to come out thats just a different cover on the box.20th century have got to release the first 2 with the much awaited bonus features, other wise, well, there what the French call, Les Incompidont.",1,Still ripping us off,1104624000,"01 2, 2005",2005,1791,"['Dont', 'get', 'low', 'rating', 'confused', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'rated', 'stars', 'again', 'rip', '20th', 'Here', 'why', '100th', 'box', 'set', '4', ""'Home"", 'Alone', 'films', 'together', 'previous', 'sets', 'have', 'ignored', 'fact', 'first', '2', 'movies', 'where', 'best', 'first', 'Home', 'Alone', '4', '5', 'star', 'comedy', 'part', '2', 'wasnt', 'good', 'still', 'ok', 'first', '2', 'where', 'smash', 'hits', 'great', 'movies', 'might', 'even', 'call', 'classics', 'where', 'poorly', 'misstreated', 'when', 'where', 'brought', 'DVD', 'First', 'off', 'Fullscreen', 'not', 'Widescreen', 'dont', 'look', 'have', 'been', 'remastered', 'too', 'good', 'bonus', 'apart', 'trailer.Why', 'there', 'bonus', 'home', 'alone', '1', '2', 'plenty', 'put', 'where', 'heaps', 'featurettes', 'done', 'when', 'films', 'came', 'out', 'so', 'where', 'are', 'now', 'why', 'isnt', 'reunion', 'footage', 'audio', 'commentery', 'something', 'trailer', 'also', 'clearly', 'few', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'alternate', 'extended', 'scenes', 'so', 'where', 'stuff', 'Why', 'only', 'disc', 'bonus', 'features', 'part', '3', '4', 'Part', '4', 'was', 'ok', 'where', 'near', 'as', 'good', 'other', '2', 'part', '4', 'god', 'dont', 'get', 'started', 'how', 'bad', 'movie', 'was', 'fill', '2', 'useless', 'ones', 'heaps', 'bonus', 'features', 'cant', 'go', 'find', 'bonus', 'would', 'actualy', 'want', 'see.Dont', 'bother', 'buying', 'box', 'set', 'dont', 'care', 'are', 'bonus', 'just', 'want', 'movie', 'themself', 'then', 'ok', 'wait', 'few', 'months', 'box', 'set', 'edition', 'come', 'out', 'thats', 'just', 'different', 'cover', 'box.20th', 'century', 'have', 'got', 'release', 'first', '2', 'much', 'awaited', 'bonus', 'features', 'other', 'wise', 'well', 'what', 'French', 'call', 'Les', 'Incompidont']",Home Alone: Complete Caper Collection: (Home Alone / Home Alone 2: Lost in New York / Home Alone 3 / Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House)
