Chapdelaine ""film collector""","[23, 25]",i don't agree with anyone who thinks this season is awesome. most of the skits are only 15 minutes in length. once again cheap fox won't buy the music rights. there is sections (i think) that have been either doctored or just cut out. you'll be watching an episode and you'll see the screen mismatch up for a brief moment. you'll think it's your eyes but it's not. thank you fox for butchering all of the seasons of in living color. even though my review isn't that great i still believe that in living color was and is one of the best sketch comedy series on t.v. so they're all still worth buying.,2,i don't agree !,1130716800,"10 31, 2005",2005,599,"['i', 'do', ""n't"", 'agree', 'anyone', 'who', 'season', 'awesome', 'most', 'skits', 'are', 'only', '15', 'minutes', 'length', 'once', 'again', 'cheap', 'fox', 'wo', ""n't"", 'buy', 'music', 'rights', 'sections', 'i', 'think', 'have', 'been', 'either', 'doctored', 'just', 'cut', 'out', ""'ll"", 'be', 'watching', 'episode', ""'ll"", 'see', 'screen', 'mismatch', 'up', 'brief', 'moment', ""'ll"", 'think', 'eyes', 'not', 'thank', 'fox', 'butchering', 'seasons', 'living', 'color', 'even', 'review', ""n't"", 'great', 'i', 'still', 'believe', 'living', 'color', 'was', 'one', 'best', 'sketch', 'comedy', 'series', 't.v', ""'re"", 'still', 'worth', 'buying']",In Living Color - Season 4

So much more.  Is there a reason, is my memoery playing games with me.  NO.  This is not in living color.  This is In living color with no soul.  The music has been changed into Techno rap that seems just strange.  In living color was known breaking Hip Hop into the mainstream.  But those great songs are gone.  I asked myself the fly girls seem lame. its not the fly girls its the music thier dancing to.  Where are all the music Videos  Shabba ranks Mr Ugly man,, vanillia ice.

He did make some comebacks on Men On Fitness and Handi Man, which were the classics.  Keenan and Marlon were only on there for half of a season.  This was truly the last season of In Livin' Color because after this, all the Wayans sibilings were gone.  What really made this season suck were cutting off the original sketches that were funny :  The Whitney Houston, Boys II Men, Joe and Latoya Jackson's parody to Michael's ""In the Closet"", The Jackson Bunch, Prince (WHY THEY DO THAT!?), and Michael Jacksons Black & White (BIG BIG MISTAKE!!!!!! - I'M MAD CUZ THAT WAS THE BEST AND FUNNIEST IN LIVING COLOR SKETCH!!!!!!).  Total Ripoff!  They don't edit these sketches when they play them on BET (they are on BET now) so for those that did'nt buy this DVD, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH THAT DOES NOT GIVE YOU THE COMPLETE EPISODES!!!

924508,A2E7TODV6TJFQR,B000A9QKSW,Steven Baum,"[0, 0]","I was a fan from day 1 & still find the show funny. The show was a launching pad for many comedy stars including Jim Carrey, the Wayans family & Jamie Foxx! The sketches had many memorable characters that fans grew to love. Jamie Foxx as a real ugly woman will make you wet your pants. Jim Carrey as Fire Marshall Bill still makes me laugh, even though the Fox network took a lot of heat over the playing with fire & was responsible for killing the character. The series was still good in season 4, but was loosing its edge as Damon Wayans was leaving. The show also had good musical groups who were chart toppers at the time & of course there were the Fly Girls who Rosie Perez made famous. Bottom line, buy it if you can find it.
