In the meantime, Nick is the personification of goodness and the Christmas spirit. He treats Beth's son as his own and helps those he meets. In other films, Guttenberg's style of acting might seem awkward or goofy, but it fitsSingle Santa Seeks Mrs. Clausperfectly. The only problem is that the movie ends a bit too quickly.

CLAUS on the Hallmark Channel and liked it well enough that, now, I want to throw my two cents in. Steve Guttenberg (POLICE ACADEMY, THREE MEN AND A BABY, COCOON) plays Nick, the bachelor offspring of the real Santa Claus, who, in a year's time, is slated to take over his old man's traditional position. But, first, he needs to get himself a wife and he needs to do it before Christmas eve. In search of such, he journeys to sunny California and bumps into Beth (Crystal Bernard, WINGS), an overworked ad exec and single mom, who is very practical and doesn't believe in Santa Claus. What follows is Nick's courtship of Beth and her little boy Jake, who, by the way, though liking Nick a lot, seems to be the only one to notice something weird about him. Of course, since a movie isn't a movie without some conflict, what we get is a harried Beth, constantly being pressured by her boss about various work projects, who must ultimately decide between her vocational advancement and her personal life.This being a Christmas family movie and a Hallmark one, at that, it tends to suffer from being a little too treacly. But Guttenberg's warmth, boyish likability and his chemistry with the lovely Bernard go a long way to make the sometimes cloying sentimentality palatable. There are nice touches here as Nick covertly applies his magical abilities to make things and the people around him better (Nick magically enabling a store Santa to communicate with a deaf girl is particularly neat). But, seemingly, what works best for Nick is his innate, jovial charm and indiscriminating friendliness to everyone. Just witness his easy rapport with the child actress who couldn't remember her line and was subsequently yelled at by the old actor playing Santa for a commercial.There are no special effects to speak of, and, really, none are required. The performances of the actors and the cute premise are endearing enough that the viewer is swayed early on to suspend belief and buy into the unlikely plot. Of course, it helps that it's shown predominantly around the holidays. I honestly had fun watching this movie, which, in my opinion, is superior to the boorish SANTA CLAUSE 2. And, thanks to the reviewers here, I just found out that there's a sequel; so I'll just have to keep my eyes open for MEET THE SANTAS.",4,"""I'm gonna have Santa for a dad!""",1167004800,"12 25, 2006",2006,2362,"['just', 'caught', 'engaging', 'SINGLE', 'SANTA', 'SEEKS', 'MRS.', 'CLAUS', 'Hallmark', 'Channel', 'liked', 'well', 'enough', 'now', 'want', 'throw', 'two', 'cents', 'Steve', 'Guttenberg', 'POLICE', 'ACADEMY', 'THREE', 'MEN', 'A', 'BABY', 'COCOON', 'Nick', 'bachelor', 'offspring', 'real', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'who', 'year', 'time', 'slated', 'take', 'over', 'old', 'man', 'traditional', 'position', 'first', 'get', 'wife', 'do', 'Christmas', 'eve', 'search', 'such', 'sunny', 'California', 'bumps', 'Beth', 'Crystal', 'Bernard', 'WINGS', 'overworked', 'ad', 'exec', 'single', 'mom', 'who', 'very', 'practical', ""n't"", 'believe', 'Santa', 'Claus', 'What', 'Nick', 'courtship', 'Beth', 'little', 'boy', 'Jake', 'who', 'way', 'liking', 'Nick', 'lot', 'be', 'only', 'one', 'notice', 'something', 'weird', 'course', 'movie', ""n't"", 'movie', 'conflict', 'what', 'get', 'harried', 'Beth', 'constantly', 'being', 'pressured', 'boss', 'various', 'work', 'projects', 'who', 'must', 'ultimately', 'decide', 'vocational', 'advancement', 'personal', 'life.This', 'being', 'Christmas', 'family', 'movie', 'Hallmark', 'one', 'suffer', 'being', 'little', 'too', 'treacly', 'Guttenberg', 'warmth', 'boyish', 'likability', 'chemistry', 'lovely', 'Bernard', 'go', 'long', 'way', 'make', 'sometimes', 'cloying', 'sentimentality', 'palatable', 'are', 'nice', 'touches', 'here', 'Nick', 'covertly', 'magical', 'abilities', 'make', 'things', 'people', 'better', 'Nick', 'magically', 'enabling', 'store', 'Santa', 'communicate', 'deaf', 'girl', 'particularly', 'neat', 'seemingly', 'what', 'best', 'Nick', 'innate', 'jovial', 'charm', 'indiscriminating', 'friendliness', 'everyone', 'Just', 'easy', 'rapport', 'child', 'actress', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'remember', 'line', 'was', 'subsequently', 'yelled', 'old', 'actor', 'playing', 'Santa', 'commercial.There', 'are', 'special', 'effects', 'speak', 'really', 'none', 'are', 'required', 'performances', 'actors', 'cute', 'premise', 'are', 'endearing', 'viewer', 'swayed', 'early', 'suspend', 'belief', 'buy', 'unlikely', 'plot', 'course', 'shown', 'predominantly', 'holidays', 'honestly', 'had', 'fun', 'watching', 'movie', 'opinion', 'superior', 'boorish', 'SANTA', 'CLAUSE', '2', 'thanks', 'reviewers', 'here', 'just', 'found', 'out', 'sequel', ""'ll"", 'just', 'have', 'keep', 'eyes', 'open', 'MEET', 'THE', 'SANTAS']",N/A

Despite the fact that the description of the DVD states that it includes close-captioning, that is not the case!

Not only did I waste my time and money, but I also can't enjoy the movie I wanted to see.  There are two problems related to the subtitling issue.  The first is the problem I found with Single Santa; the description states there is captioning when there is not.  The second problem is one I have found in many other cases; the description does not give any information about captioning so I pass up the purchase only to learn from a friend or relative who has the DVD that captioning is included.  All nine seasons of Perry Mason fall into this category.  All are subtitled, but you will never know it by reading the descriptions unless they have been updated recently.  Also, there may be several seasons of a TV show offered for sale, but the descriptions include subtitling for only one season.  When the same company produced all the DVDs, is it likely only one would include captioning?  Who knows, but without information, I am forced to pass up these purchases.
