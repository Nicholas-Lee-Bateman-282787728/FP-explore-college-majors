Interspersed is a fun and revealing interview with the artist discussing the songs, his involvement in the writing process, and many other entertaining tidbits that will fascinate fans. The sound and picture are glorious. The performance is unforgettable.

Home location, barn setting was nice, serene images and laid back style. JT is great at this type of thing and the fans should love this.

I would like to say something about the people no longer with us. First Brother Don Grolnick. Carlos Vegas were both very important in James's music at the time. Valerie Carter and the backgrand singers are very good. James is really my most favorite singer in the last 40 years. I don't know when sweet baby james came out but I was A fan. I would like to say that James was my favorite of all the singer songwriters. I miss carly and him singing together.,5,big james taylor fan,1242518400,"05 17, 2009",2009,560,"['have', 'been', 'big', 'james', 'Taylor', 'fan', 'years', 'man', 'can', 'sing', 'better', 'almost', 'anyone', 'have', 'seen', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'something', 'people', 'no', 'longer', 'First', 'Brother', 'Don', 'Grolnick', 'Carlos', 'Vegas', 'were', 'very', 'important', 'James', 'music', 'time', 'Valerie', 'Carter', 'backgrand', 'singers', 'are', 'very', 'good', 'James', 'really', 'most', 'favorite', 'singer', 'last', '40', 'years', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'when', 'sweet', 'baby', 'james', 'came', 'out', 'was', 'fan', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'James', 'was', 'favorite', 'singer', 'songwriters', 'miss', 'carly', 'singing', 'together']",N/A
