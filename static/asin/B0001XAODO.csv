Season one is by far better.  I love the characters,especially Matt, who is not even a character.  Now I just want to be his friend.  This is a great buy but it is a little pricey.  Forty dollars is a little too expensive.I think the premise of the show is good and well thought up.  Kip the gay guy is by far the funniest and does the best acting job.  Ashleigh the rich Snob is hot as all and does a great job as well.I would recommend you buy this right now because it is hours of entertainment joking the reality shows we love",5,Hilarious,1090022400,"07 17, 2004",2004,650,"['started', 'watching', 'season', '2', 'missed', 'out', 'season', 'one', 'think', 'show', 'very', 'clever', 'laughing', 'Season', 'one', 'far', 'better', 'love', 'characters', 'especially', 'Matt', 'who', 'not', 'even', 'character', 'Now', 'just', 'want', 'be', 'friend', 'great', 'buy', 'little', 'pricey', 'Forty', 'dollars', 'little', 'too', 'expensive.I', 'think', 'premise', 'show', 'good', 'well', 'thought', 'up', 'Kip', 'gay', 'guy', 'far', 'funniest', 'best', 'acting', 'job', 'Ashleigh', 'rich', 'Snob', 'hot', 'great', 'job', 'well.I', 'would', 'recommend', 'buy', 'right', 'now', 'hours', 'entertainment', 'joking', 'reality', 'love']",The Joe Schmo Show - Season One Uncensored

While watching the show I thought man it would be nice to see the uncensored version of the show and to see some extra behind the scenes footage . When the DVD came out saying uncensored I went and bought it expecting everything to be shown and every word to be said. Well every word is said but everything is not shown. Is it just me or is that false advertising or what? I would have also like to have seen more bonus features but even though I still give the DVD 5 stars because the show itself is fun to watch. The 2nd season is on right now and to me it looks even better then the first one. Can't wait till it is on DVD and I hope the don't lie this time about the uncensored version.

Matt is just an all around great guy and without him in the center of everything, this just would not be as funny or enjoyable as it is.Contrary to what others seem to have said in reviews, this version is ""uncensored"" - the only time you see the mosaic are when it was intentionally done for humorous purposes and not for censor purposes (ie. when Kip is obviously wearing a nude colored undie on the catwalk... the mosaic is left in ""covering"" his naughty bits, because obviously it wouldn't have been as funny to see him walk down in nude underoos.

816096,ARJIAB8SLWAOU,B0001XAODO,"George Buttner ""Agent0042""","[12, 12]","That's from Matt when he saw Tawny Roberts when doing the commentary for the uncensored finale. Just one of many funny things on a very funny DVD.First, you'll get to watch all the episodes without logos, commercials, promos over the closing credits or other such nonsense. This is great in itself and even if you've been a regular watcher of the show (maybe more than once), I think you'll still laugh. For more fun, try using your DVD's pause / slow motion feature during the director's meetings to pick up things you might not have noticed before.The special features are pretty sweet. One of the best ones is what I mentioned above - a commentary on the finale by Matt Kennedy Gould and executive producer Rhett Reese. Since the finale also includes a look-back at the entire season, you'll get to hear their thoughts on that as well. You'll also catch up on how Matt's doing now and some of his deepest thoughts on what during the show.As for the actual bonus features section, you get Deleted Scenes, Chocolate-Covered Models featurette, the Making of a Meal and additional Eviction footage. Of these, I'd have to say that the most interesting and revealing is definitely the Eviction footage. You get the complete commentary of what the cast had to say to Matt after they were &quot;evicted,&quot; plus Matt's full commentary afterwards. You'll recognize the bits and pieces that were shown during the program, but this is the chance to see the entire thing and pick up a lot of stuff that got cut before. Of the Deleted Scenes, the two funniest are Matt's Breakdown and a Fish Story from Kip. The breakdown is very funny and almost alone makes the DVD worth it.Finally, to those who are complaining about the censorship, I just have to say that I don't think it's any big deal. For one thing, when they censored Brian's nipples, that was a joke. And, come on, do you really want to see Brian's naughty bits anyway? Or Kip's? If that's the only thing you're tuning in for, then it seems you're not appreciating everything the show/DVD has to offer. Oh, and by way of explanation, the main cast of the show probably had contracts that said they couldn't show that --- at least for the stuff that wasn't just a joke.",5,&quot;Uncensored Version...

It's really interesting to hear actors talk out of character about their preformences, it makes it audiences identify better, with these people and enjoy the show. The Schmo Matt, is a really cool guy to watch and it's very amusing to see him try his heart out on a show that is rigged.The games and elimination ceramony were pretty well done, minus one episode where (SPOILER) two people were eliminated, where the two people with the highest amounts of votes were sent away. I feel they should've voted twice.Surprisingly the ""host"" of the show captivated my interest and helped carry the show in some areas (the sign of a good host). Also the inclushion of Jerri and the fake tv exceutive were interesting as it helped bring in different more level personalities and not close to over the top acting. However as one who eventually liked Jerri after her third Survivor season, I'm kind of annoyed that the producers made Jerri oveerplay her ""bitch"" card and then give one contestant a high score dispite her saying (in character) ""Out of all the suckyness that sucked the least"".The ending and the reflection chapter, was actually very entertaining to watch bringing the show to a much better conclusion.

There are only a few exceptions that are actually any good, and those are the ones that should remain.My hatred of the reality genre basically stems from the fact that most networks think that they can just prepackage a show without hiring any professional actors or anything like that, they don't have to hire writers to actually use their brains or things of that nature, and that was just plain sloppy.Then the 'Joe Schmo Show' came around, a reality show that only ONE person thinks is real.  The premise of the show reminded me of 'The Truman Show' starring Jim Carrey, sort of.I thought that this show was truly, TRULY excellent.  Because this show simultaneously paid homage and poked fun at the reality genre.  And even though there were writers on the show and actors, there were still moments of unpredictability on the part of Matt that would surprise everyone; the cast, the crew, and the audience watching.I think what I liked best thing about the show was the fact that Matt Kennedy Gould was such an incredible human being.  He was someone that you can't help but like.  He's definitely the kind of person you want to have as a best friend, or a brother, or if you're a girl you definitely want to date or even marry the guy.This show is definitely awesome, and I can't wait to see what they'll do for an encore with 'Joe Schmo 2'.",5,Joe Schmo is Joe Cool in my book!!,1087171200,"06 14, 2004",2004,1590,"['Just', 'when', 'thought', 'reality', 'shows', 'could', ""n't"", 'get', 'more', 'ridiculous', 'blue', 'Joe', 'Schmo', 'Show.I', 'always', 'thought', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'bloody', 'anyway', 'think', 'networks', 'really', 'need', 'cut', 'out', 'are', 'only', 'few', 'exceptions', 'are', 'actually', 'good', 'are', 'ones', 'should', 'remain.My', 'hatred', 'reality', 'genre', 'basically', 'fact', 'most', 'networks', 'think', 'can', 'just', 'prepackage', 'show', 'hiring', 'professional', 'actors', 'anything', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'hire', 'writers', 'actually', 'use', 'brains', 'things', 'nature', 'was', 'just', 'plain', 'sloppy.Then', ""'Joe"", 'Schmo', 'Show', 'came', 'around', 'reality', 'show', 'only', 'ONE', 'person', 'real', 'premise', 'show', 'reminded', 'Truman', 'Show', 'starring', 'Jim', 'Carrey', 'sort', 'of.I', 'thought', 'show', 'was', 'truly', 'TRULY', 'excellent', 'show', 'simultaneously', 'paid', 'homage', 'poked', 'fun', 'reality', 'genre', 'even', 'were', 'writers', 'show', 'actors', 'were', 'still', 'moments', 'unpredictability', 'part', 'Matt', 'would', 'surprise', 'everyone', 'cast', 'crew', 'audience', 'watching.I', 'think', 'what', 'liked', 'best', 'thing', 'show', 'was', 'fact', 'Matt', 'Kennedy', 'Gould', 'was', 'such', 'incredible', 'human', 'being', 'was', 'someone', 'ca', ""n't"", 'help', 'like', 'definitely', 'kind', 'person', 'want', 'have', 'best', 'friend', 'brother', ""'re"", 'girl', 'definitely', 'want', 'date', 'even', 'marry', 'guy.This', 'show', 'definitely', 'awesome', 'ca', ""n't"", 'wait', 'see', 'what', ""'ll"", 'do', 'encore', ""'Joe"", 'Schmo', '2']",The Joe Schmo Show - Season One Uncensored
