1370754,A19K5DILM15WU3,B003XM707S,Alex,"[945, 957]","There is some false information in the reviews for this. First off, this box set is not missing any episodes of the series ""Scooby Doo, Where Are You!"" The ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"" series originally ran for two seasons, broadcast from 1969-1970. Both of those seasons are here, amounting to 25 episodes.The success of the series lead to an hour-long series in 1972 called ""The New Scooby-Doo Movies."" This series is partially available on DVD, but is not included in this set.Scooby-Doo returned in 1976 with 16 new half-hour episodes that were paired with another Hannah-Barbara show (Dynomutt, Dog Wonder) in a series called ""The Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt Hour."" The 16 episodes were later retitled ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" for reruns and are sometimes referred to as Season 1 of that series. These episodes aren't included, but are available separately.In 1977, 8 more episodes were produced under a 2-hour package called ""Scooby's All-Star Laugh-A-Lympics."" These episodes were also rebroadcast as part of ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" and are referred to as Season 2 of that series. Scoobs also appeared in 16 30-minute segments of the ""Laff-A-Lympics"" series with other Hannah-Barbara characters. None of these episodes are in this set.Which leads to 1978, when 16 more episodes were produced under the name ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"" 8 of these episodes were broadcast with the original series' opening and closing credits. When the lineup changed, the remaining 8 were aired under a package called ""Scooby's All Stars."" Like the `76 and `77 episodes, when these episodes were reaired, they were listed as part of ""The Scooby-Doo Show"" and are often referred to as Season 3 of that series, in addition to being known as Season 3 of the original series. These are also sometimes called the ""lost"" episodes. Since they were originally aired under the name ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"", Warner released them on DVD as the third season of the original series and included them in this set.Based solely on the seasons that were produced under the name ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"", this box set collects those 41 episodes produced from 1969-1970 and 1978 and presents them as ""The Complete Series."" It's not a lie. It's not false advertising. It's just not a compendium of every Scooby-Doo series that ever existed, which is what some people think it is.The packaging of this release is cardboard, but is fairly sturdy. It's definitely not a toy. A plastic version was previously made and has been out of print for a few years. That version housed the discs in cardboard sleeves, prone to scratching. In this release, all 8 discs are housed in an extra-wide DVD case, presenting them more securely than the previous release. This case fits nicely inside the drawer that slides out from the back of the Mystery Machine packaging.If you're a big fan of Scooby-Doo, this is a nice way to collect all of the ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"" episodes. This is the original series and is still considered the best Scooby-Doo series ever made. If you're looking to collect every episode of Scooby animation that's ever been made, this won't be the last Scooby-Doo set you purchase.",5,What Every Scooby-Doo Fan Needs To Know About This Release,1366588800,"04 22, 2013",2013,3161,"['false', 'information', 'reviews', 'First', 'off', 'box', 'set', 'not', 'missing', 'episodes', 'series', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'series', 'originally', 'ran', 'two', 'seasons', 'broadcast', '1969-1970', 'seasons', 'are', 'here', 'amounting', '25', 'episodes.The', 'success', 'series', 'lead', 'hour-long', 'series', '1972', 'called', 'New', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Movies', 'series', 'partially', 'available', 'DVD', 'not', 'included', 'set.Scooby-Doo', 'returned', '1976', '16', 'new', 'half-hour', 'episodes', 'were', 'paired', 'Hannah-Barbara', 'show', 'Dynomutt', 'Dog', 'Wonder', 'series', 'called', 'Scooby-Doo/Dynomutt', 'Hour', '16', 'episodes', 'were', 'later', 'retitled', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Show', 'reruns', 'are', 'sometimes', 'referred', 'Season', '1', 'series', 'episodes', 'are', ""n't"", 'included', 'are', 'available', 'separately.In', '1977', '8', 'more', 'episodes', 'were', 'produced', '2-hour', 'package', 'called', 'Scooby', 'All-Star', 'Laugh-A-Lympics', 'episodes', 'were', 'also', 'rebroadcast', 'part', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Show', 'are', 'referred', 'Season', '2', 'series', 'Scoobs', 'also', 'appeared', '16', '30-minute', 'segments', 'Laff-A-Lympics', 'series', 'other', 'Hannah-Barbara', 'characters', 'None', 'episodes', 'are', 'set.Which', '1978', 'when', '16', 'more', 'episodes', 'were', 'produced', 'name', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Where', 'Are', '8', 'episodes', 'were', 'broadcast', 'original', 'series', 'opening', 'closing', 'credits', 'When', 'lineup', 'changed', 'remaining', '8', 'were', 'aired', 'package', 'called', 'Scooby', 'Stars', '76', '77', 'episodes', 'when', 'episodes', 'were', 'reaired', 'were', 'listed', 'part', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Show', 'are', 'often', 'referred', 'Season', '3', 'series', 'addition', 'being', 'known', 'Season', '3', 'original', 'series', 'are', 'also', 'sometimes', 'called', 'lost', 'episodes', 'were', 'originally', 'aired', 'name', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'Warner', 'released', 'DVD', 'third', 'season', 'original', 'series', 'included', 'set.Based', 'solely', 'seasons', 'were', 'produced', 'name', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'box', 'set', 'collects', '41', 'episodes', 'produced', '1969-1970', '1978', 'Complete', 'Series', 'not', 'lie', 'not', 'false', 'advertising', 'just', 'not', 'compendium', 'Scooby-Doo', 'series', 'ever', 'existed', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'packaging', 'release', 'cardboard', 'fairly', 'sturdy', 'definitely', 'not', 'toy', 'A', 'plastic', 'version', 'was', 'previously', 'made', 'been', 'print', 'few', 'years', 'version', 'housed', 'discs', 'cardboard', 'sleeves', 'prone', 'scratching', 'release', '8', 'discs', 'are', 'housed', 'extra-wide', 'DVD', 'case', 'presenting', 'more', 'securely', 'previous', 'release', 'case', 'nicely', 'drawer', 'out', 'back', 'Mystery', 'Machine', 'packaging.If', ""'re"", 'big', 'fan', 'Scooby-Doo', 'nice', 'way', 'collect', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'original', 'series', 'still', 'considered', 'best', 'Scooby-Doo', 'series', 'ever', 'made', ""'re"", 'looking', 'collect', 'episode', 'Scooby', 'animation', 'ever', 'been', 'made', 'wo', ""n't"", 'be', 'last', 'Scooby-Doo', 'set', 'purchase']","Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete Series"

1370775,A2Z65D8FBYDY63,B003XM707S,Donald J. Wurzelbacher,"[0, 0]","I chose to give this complete set five stars because this is a wonderful family-friendly cartoon program. Some very young children may be afraid of the ghosts in the stories (which is understandable) but I would say by the time they reach seven years they would probably find it a fun show to watch when they are in the mood for some laughs. I wouldn't doubt that they will soon be singing the catchy theme song as well. In recent times the Scooby gang have dealt with relationship issues, Velma definitely has slimmed down and drawn much more attractively than these original cartoons. But I prefer these originals: Lots of laughs and not meant to be very serious. After all, it's a talking dog who, with Shaggy, has an appetite that can never be suppressed. These original cartoons are innocent fun with nothing to concern parents of young children (who are old enough to laugh at the ghosts, not cry). I'm glad this series has become available to DVD. I was watching it on Boomerang network for a while but that is no longer an option for me. I am in my 50s and I still enjoy this hilarious series. I hope to watch it with my grandchildren as well as my own children. For me, Halloween is a great season to pull out this series. My ONLY concern is the packaging. I may decide to use my own disk cases and make my own 'boxed set' that not only will last longer but also saves more space on my shelf.

(despite the fact that the third season was officially titled The Scooby-Doo Show).This show is a part of many people's childhood regardless of what generation they are apart of. Originally airing in 1969 it became a classic and that's why even as a child growing up in the nineties I remember watching this series every morning almost religiously. It became so loved that its various incarnations have continued to air from 1969 to this very day in 2012. It also spawned three live action movies and countless animated movies. All that aside, Scooby-Doo Where Are You? is where it all began and what some (myself included) regard as the best. The atmosphere was dark and spooky, the characters were simplistic but well defined and the monsters were still fresh, as were the mysteries.This new complete series set, is being put out for those who didn't get a chance to pick up the original Mystery Machine Collector's Edition set during its limited edition run. Like that set this one contains three seasons of Scooby Doo, 41 episodes in total spread across 7 discs. It is not technically complete as it is missing 8 episodes (the same as that set was), but it does carry over all the special features from that set.Season 11 What a Night for A Knight2 A Clue for Scooby-Doo3 Hassle in the Castle4 Mine Your Own Business5 Decoy for a Dogknapper6 What the Hex is Going On?7 Never Ape and Ape Man8 Foul Play in Funland9 The Backstage Rage10 Bedlam in the Bigtop11 A Gaggle of Galloping Ghosts12 Scooby-Doo and a Mummy Too!13 Which Witch is Which?14 Spooky Space Kook15 Go Away Ghost Ship16 A Night of Fright is No Delight17 That's Snow GhostSeason 218 Nowhere to Hyde19 Myster Mask Mix-Up20 Jeepers It's the Creeper21 Scooby's Night with a Frozen Fright22 The Haunted House Hang-Up23 A Tiki Scare is No Fair24 Who's Afraid of the Big Bad Werewolf?25 Don't Fool with a PhantomSeason 326 Watch Out the Willawaw!27 A Creepy Tangle in the Bermuda Triangle28 A Scary Night with a Snow Beast Fright29 To Switch a Witch30 The Tar Monster31 A Highland Fling with a Monstrous Thing32 The Creepy Case of Old Iron Face33 Jeeper's, It's the Jaguro34 Make A Beline Away From That Feline35 The Creepy Creature of Vulture's Claw36 The Diabolical Disc Demon37 Scooby's Chinese Fortune Kooky Caper38 A Menace in Venice39 Don't Go Near the Fortress of Fear40 The Warlock of Wimbledon41 The Beast is Awake at Bottomless LakeThis set will contain all the special features released on the two individual sets AND an eighth disc that was included in the previous complete series set.Previously Released Special Features Included In This Set:*Featurette: Scooby-Doo's Ultimate Fans*Get the Picture: How to draw Scooby and the gang*Funky Fashions*Music Video: America Loves Scooby-Doo*Scooby-Doo Street Smarts*Scooby Challenge Trivia*Hannah Barbera from H to BSpecial Features Exclusive To This Set (and the previous limited edition release):*Scooby-Doo The Whole World Loves You: Focuses on Scooby's continued popularity and fans continued love of the character. Features interviews with various writers, directors and actors who have worked on Scooby TV and Movie projects over the last 40 years. (20 mins)*The Eerie Mystery of the Scooby-Doo History: The executives and creative team behind the show discuss how it originally came to be from their point of view. (10 mins)*The Scooby-Doo Gang, In Their Own Words: Featurette focusing on the original voice cast of Scooby-Doo and how they originated the characters' unique voices. (5 mins)The best reason for fans to buy this complete series set, aside from the eighth disc and its bonus materials, is the unique packaging.

Is it worth double dipping on a set I'm sure most of us fans of Scooby probably already have? Well, yes and no. Scooby Doo! Where Are You: The Complete Series is a awasome yet equally flawed set, with the discs coming in filmsy plastic sleeves and the so called ""new"" bonus disc not being completely new.Scooby Doo! Where Are You: The Complete Series comes with eight discs. The three seasons are spread over the first seven. These are the exact same discs that have been released before, except for Season 3, which is now three single sided DVDs instead of one single sided and one double sided DVD. What is there to be said about these episodes? These are the best of the best, the originals. In my opinion, some of the best Scooby episodes are from the first two seasons. Even season 3, even though it's techincally The Scooby Doo Show and not part of Scooby Doo! Where Are You, is pretty good. The eighth bonus disc comes with three new featurettes. ""The Eerie Mystery of the Scooby-Doo History"" focuses on the history of the show and how it went from ""Mysterys Five"" to the Scooby Doo we know and love today. ""The Scooby-Doo Gang, In Their Own Words"" all about the original voice actors and how they came up with the voices for their characters. These two featurettes are nice and all, but they are not techinally new. Both of these are from the Scooby Doo/Dynomutt Hour: Complete Series set. It seems to me that Warners was just to produce any more new material, and just dumped these on here. ""Scooby-Doo The Whole World Loves You"" is the only new bonus material here, and is the best out of the three. This featurette features people involved with various Scooby projects talking about the popularity of the character amd why Scooby has survived for over forty plus years.Now, the reason to buy this set is, of course, the packaging. The Mystery Machine is really cool looking, especally on the shelf. And one of the best things about it is that it can double as a toy. The wheels move and everything{though you can't remove the two Scooby and Shaggy figures]. The back opens up to reveal the eight discs in plastic sleeves, which is the only downside to the packaging. The sleeves the discs come in are HORRIBLE. Very flimsy and cheap. I felt like they were going to fall apart on me when I took the discs out.Yeah, I wish WB hadn't skimped out on the extras, and wish the discs came in something more sturdy, but I think the good outweighs the bad with this set. The packaging is awasome and the one new featurette is at least woth a look. If you're looking for a gift for someone or even if you already have the previous release, I strongly reccomend this set.Content: 10/10Special Features: 7/10Packaging: 9/10Overall: 9/10",4,A Awasome Yet Equally Flawed Set,1293062400,"12 23, 2010",2010,2827,"['Recently', 'had', 'chance', 'pick', 'up', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'Complete', 'Series', 'DVD', 'worth', 'double', 'dipping', 'set', ""'m"", 'sure', 'most', 'fans', 'Scooby', 'probably', 'already', 'have', 'Well', 'yes', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'Complete', 'Series', 'awasome', 'yet', 'equally', 'flawed', 'set', 'discs', 'coming', 'filmsy', 'plastic', 'sleeves', 'so', 'called', 'new', 'bonus', 'not', 'being', 'completely', 'new.Scooby', 'Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'Complete', 'Series', 'eight', 'discs', 'three', 'seasons', 'are', 'spread', 'first', 'seven', 'are', 'exact', 'same', 'discs', 'have', 'been', 'released', 'Season', '3', 'now', 'three', 'single', 'sided', 'DVDs', 'instead', 'one', 'single', 'sided', 'one', 'double', 'sided', 'DVD', 'What', 'be', 'said', 'episodes', 'are', 'best', 'best', 'originals', 'opinion', 'best', 'Scooby', 'episodes', 'are', 'first', 'two', 'seasons', 'Even', 'season', '3', 'even', 'techincally', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Show', 'not', 'part', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'Where', 'Are', 'pretty', 'good', 'eighth', 'bonus', 'disc', 'three', 'new', 'featurettes', 'Eerie', 'Mystery', 'Scooby-Doo', 'History', 'history', 'show', 'how', 'went', 'Mysterys', 'Five', 'Scooby', 'Doo', 'know', 'love', 'today', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Gang', 'Their', 'Own', 'Words', 'original', 'voice', 'actors', 'how', 'came', 'up', 'voices', 'characters', 'two', 'featurettes', 'are', 'nice', 'are', 'not', 'techinally', 'new', 'are', 'Scooby', 'Doo/Dynomutt', 'Hour', 'Complete', 'Series', 'set', 'Warners', 'was', 'just', 'produce', 'more', 'new', 'material', 'just', 'dumped', 'here', 'Scooby-Doo', 'Whole', 'World', 'only', 'new', 'bonus', 'material', 'here', 'best', 'three', 'featurette', 'people', 'involved', 'various', 'Scooby', 'projects', 'talking', 'popularity', 'character', 'amd', 'why', 'Scooby', 'survived', 'forty', 'years.Now', 'reason', 'buy', 'set', 'course', 'packaging', 'Mystery', 'Machine', 'really', 'cool', 'looking', 'especally', 'shelf', 'one', 'best', 'things', 'can', 'double', 'toy', 'wheels', 'move', 'everything', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remove', 'two', 'Scooby', 'Shaggy', 'figures', ']', 'back', 'up', 'reveal', 'eight', 'discs', 'plastic', 'sleeves', 'only', 'downside', 'packaging', 'sleeves', 'discs', 'come', 'are', 'HORRIBLE', 'Very', 'flimsy', 'cheap', 'felt', 'were', 'going', 'fall', 'apart', 'when', 'took', 'discs', 'out.Yeah', 'wish', 'WB', 'had', ""n't"", 'skimped', 'out', 'extras', 'wish', 'discs', 'came', 'something', 'more', 'sturdy', 'think', 'good', 'bad', 'set', 'packaging', 'awasome', 'one', 'new', 'featurette', 'least', 'look', ""'re"", 'looking', 'gift', 'someone', 'even', 'already', 'have', 'previous', 'release', 'strongly', 'reccomend', 'set.Content', '10/10Special', 'Features', '7/10Packaging', '9/10Overall', '9/10']","Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete Series"
