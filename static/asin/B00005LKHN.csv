663513,A31I3HXMD5H1EL,B00005LKHN,Benjamin J Burgraff,"[6, 6]","""Hercules"" (""La Fatiche di Ercole""), the French/Italian 'epic' that launched champion American bodybuilder Steve Reeves into meteoric, if brief, film stardom, is unabashedly low-budget, with laughable special effects, but it still holds up as entertainment surprisingly well, after 50 years, and, was the foundation of the 'sword and sandal' genre of films, that continues to this day.While this edition of the film has problems (when will a digitally remastered version of ""Hercules"" be offered, in the widescreen format it was filmed in?), the print is the best I've seen. The story, loosely based upon ""Jason and the Golden Fleece"", offers a dubbed Reeves as demigod Hercules, who renounces his status as a deity (while keeping most of his superhuman strength) for the chance to help mankind, and win the love of young princess Iole (lovely Sylva Koscina). When he befriends Jason (Fabrizio Mioni), foretold to overthrow Iole's father (Ivo Garrani), the sly old ruler says he'll abdicate, IF the famous fleece can be recovered. With a crew of legendary heroes (including Gabriele Antonini as the young Ulysses), Jason and Hercules embark on their epic quest, aboard the 'Argos'.Packed with battles with creaky mechanical 'monsters' and less-than-ferocious beasts (including a rather docile lion), Reeves' handsome face and incredible physique are displayed to great advantage; his acting skills, while not great, are certainly no worse than his successor in the genre, Arnold Schwarzenegger. Forget, too, the 'urban legend' that his voice was dubbed because it was tinny and high-pitched; it was actually quite close to the dubbed one (remember, Cecil B. DeMille nearly cast him as Samson, so it couldn't be THAT bad!)If you're looking for superior fantasy, Don Chaffey and Ray Harryhausen's superb 1963 ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (featuring Nigel Green as an aging, less heroic Hercules) is certainly the film to choose; but I recommend ""Hercules"" if you want to just have fun, and enjoy the 'ride'.

663515,A3HMOQO8J0SOC3,B00005LKHN,"bix lang ""pastafagiole""","[135, 146]","Ah, yes! Those were the days! Disregard the dubbed-in dialogue and hokey plot lines. The orginal 1957 &quot;Hercules&quot; is a treasure of fantasy and fun. To those Americans who possess a sense of the past (what used to be known fondly as &quot;nostalgia&quot; prior to the MTV generation and its contemptuous stance toward anything that occurred prior to the maturation of Jennifer Lopez's big, fat posterior), Johnny Weismuller was Tarzen. Bela Lugosi was Dracula. Clayton Moore was the Lone Ranger. And Steve Reeves was Hercules. Long before Arnold there was Steve Reeves, the prototype body builder who in the 1940s and 50s surpassed what Charles Atlas initiated a generation earlier. A scrawny, unathletic kid who was teased unmercifully, Reeves decided to do something about his predicament. He made body building and fitness a way of life. Between 1945 and 1950, Reeves won every body building competition and award in the universe, and he did so without the use of steroids or any other drugs. It didn't take long for Hollywood to come calling. After being considered and then turned down for the role of Samson (for being &quot;too muscular&quot;) in the 1949 MGM production of &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; opposite Heddy Lamarr, Reeves spent a few years playing mostly forgetable parts in a number of films before achieving celluloid stardom in his adopted home, Italy. In 1957 Reeves portrayed the legendary Greek hero Hercules in the film of the same name, and repeated the role in its sequel, &quot;Hercules Unchained,&quot; two years later. Reeves was extraordinarily handsome with black wavy hair and piercing blue eyes. With his beard and spectacular physique, Reeves looked exactly like the image of the Greek demigod as it had been depicted for thousands of years. So ingrained became his image in the minds of movie fans, that the names &quot;Steve Reeves&quot; and &quot;Hercules&quot; became synonomous. For a time in the late 1950s and early 1960s he was the highest-paid movie star in the world. To kids growing up in an innocent age of malt shops, high school dances, science-fiction comics, and &quot;Father Knows Best,&quot; Reeves was the epitome of wholesome manliness. He became the idol and inspiration for a whole new generation of weightlifters and body builders, including Lou Ferrigno, Franco Columbo, Reg Park, and old Arnold himself. He enchanted young and old alike as Hercules and as a number of other legendary Greco-Roman characters. In the late 1960s while still fit as a fiddle, very popular, and only in his early 40s, Reeves was asked by Sergio Leonne to star in a series of Spaghetti Westerns. But Reeves decided to leave the acting business. His place was taken by Clint Eastwood, and the rest is history (there's that anachronistic word again). Reeves continued living in Italy where he could be spotted daily &quot;power-walking&quot; (rapidly walking while carrying light weights in his arms) around all the famous sites in Rome. By the 1990s he and his wife returned to America where they raised horses and lived quietly on a beautiful ranch in Southern California. Reeves still looked great into his seventies and remained a steadfast advocate of drug-free athletics. Which is why it was so shocking to hear of his sudden death from cancer in 2000. Supposedly, Reeves visited his physician and was diagnosed with an accutely malignant form of cancer. In two weeks, he was dead. Upon hearing the news, I couldn't accept the fact of his passing. &quot;Steve Reeves dead? Can't be.&quot; He always seemed so invincible. How time marches on. But the image of Reeves as the prototype celluloid demigod will endure. In the hearts and memories of many a young boy in the 1950s and 60s, there was no more popular person in the world than Steve Reeves. In many ways, Reeves may well have been the last great role model of an America that used to be. Malt shops are gone. Early sci-fi classic films with thoughtful plots like Howard Hawks' &quot;The Thing From Another World&quot; and Robert Wise's &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; are now considered archaic by a generation whose attention span is measureable in nanoseconds. High school dances long ago devolved into loud, coarse, uncivil environments known as &quot;clubs.&quot; There are no TV shows even remotely resembling the quaint idealism of &quot;Father Knows Best.&quot; Yet certain images from yesteryear remain transfixed eternally in the minds of those still thoughtful enough to remember. Steve Reeves will always be the one and only &quot;Hercules.&quot; So long, pal.",5,When Times Were Simpler and Steve Reeves Was Hercules!,1064707200,"09 28, 2003",2003,4589,"['Ah', 'yes', 'were',

Reg Park was good for 2 movies. The also great Gordon Scott could have taken him far ( Hercules and the princess of Troy, buy it ). But it was Mr. Reeves who bought him to life. That's the good. The bad is that as the story goes Mr. J.L. who brought the movie to the USA, did not like the first dubbed version. He had it redone to improve the weak voices that were first used. I remember having the early VHS version and just loving the memories as my father had taken me to see the movie when first released. I remember buying a later VHS version and being shocked at the difference between the two. When I finally found the widescreen laserdisc I was disappointed to find that it was this inferior version. The main tall tell sign between the two versions that I know is that Hercules father is called Jupiter ( this version ) rather than Zeus ( other ). After hearing the stronger version with the voice actor who is unknown to me, but who did almost all the strongman dubbing for most movies, it is hard to hear that higher pitched voice and fully enjoy this film. Also the beautiful Sylia Koscina's part is poorly done. The rest is acceptable. This version has some wording that is just plainly a poor translation. Of course since this is it for now this is a must have dvd for those of us who have waited for this to come out. The transfer is acceptable but is too dark at certain points, and that's to be expected from Retromedia, as well as other the usual other slight problems with their dvd's.  Perhaps some other company ( Criterion ? ) will read this and go ahead with the other version which would do justice to the power of this cult classic. Also Hercules Unchained is long overdue in widescreen.

Steve Reeves does a creditable job of playing Hercules, while the rest of the cast includes several well-known Italian actors of the period, some of whom are recognizable from Biblical epics co-produced in Italy.The story revolves around Hercules' efforts to return the rightful heir to the throne of Iolcus, a small city-state where the king had been murdered and replaced by his brother several years earlier. Hercules encounters many individuals from Greek mythology: Jason, Ulysses, Laertes, Castor, Pollux, Argos, Pelias, and several others. He performs many heroic deeds: rescuing a beautiful Princess (Sylva Koscina) from runaway horses, fighting lions and bulls bare-handed, and searching for the golden fleece, among others. He also encounters Amazon warriors and Sirens. Although there is considerable deviation from Greek legend, the story is well done and follows a consistent  narrative.Quality wise, the enhanced DVD is very good, with a clear, sharp image and well-saturated colors - though the sound track is noisy. Mario Bava was the director of photography, so the camera work and lighting are above the norm. Recommended.""Mole Men Against the Son of Hercules""I was so unimpressed I did not watch it all the way through.
