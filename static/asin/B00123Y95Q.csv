Its not by any means a good movie, but its not bad either.  In short, a group of high school kids decide to ditch a dance and hang out at a supposedly nefarious apple orchard, only to find out that it is, in fact, nefarious.  There's absolutely nothing new about the story, and it was pitifully predictable.  The acting was so so, but the acting of the guys was especially bad.  But...the production values were pretty good; it did not feel like a low budget flick (which it is) and the camera work and lighting were generally good.  Despite the weak acting and awful story/dialogue, there was something entertaining about the movie.  Again, there are scores of movie that merit attention far before this one, but if you've worked through those already, you won't necessarily be disappointed.",2,Overall weak but mildly entertaining,1287792000,"10 23, 2010",2010,952,"[""'re"", 'horror', 'junkie', 'have', 'flexed', 'netflix', 'account', 'so', 'far', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'nearly', 'movie', 'people', 'have', 'heard', 'movie', 'time', 'not', 'means', 'good', 'movie', 'not', 'bad', 'either', 'short', 'group', 'high', 'school', 'kids', 'decide', 'ditch', 'dance', 'hang', 'out', 'supposedly', 'nefarious', 'apple', 'orchard', 'only', 'find', 'out', 'fact', 'nefarious', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'new', 'story', 'was', 'pitifully', 'predictable', 'acting', 'was', 'so', 'so', 'acting', 'guys', 'was', 'especially', 'bad', 'production', 'values', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'did', 'not', 'feel', 'low', 'budget', 'flick', 'camera', 'work', 'lighting', 'were', 'generally', 'good', 'weak', 'acting', 'awful', 'story/dialogue', 'was', 'something', 'entertaining', 'movie', 'Again', 'are', 'scores', 'movie', 'merit', 'attention', 'far', 'one', ""'ve"", 'worked', 'already', 'wo', ""n't"", 'necessarily', 'be', 'disappointed']",The Caretaker
1134601,A3IKLTT9JQACCI,B00123Y95Q,Becky Rose,"[11, 12]","A teen horror for the faint of heart.  It's more in the vein of ""When a Stranger Calls"" (the remake) and ""Disturbia""(but without the big budget) both of which I really liked, but also had humor.  Overall, I thought it was funny.  It has that 80's movie vibe.I'm a big Jennifer Tilly fan and think she's a comedic genius.  As always, she delivers with her quick wit and a purring feline voice.  When Miss T. arrives, she brings loads of enjoyment, but she's not the star - she's in about 30 minutes of the film.  Her character is completely off her rocker (and a rip on Mary Kay Letourneau, the teacher that married her student she had sex with when he was 12 years old).Attractive actors all around.  It's laced with teen issues and dialogue and a crazy authoritative figure.  I would have liked to have seen some romance (there was none).  The kids are likeable and out to have some harmless fun, but it wouldn't be a scream fest if they all made it back to the dance without meeting an untimely death.I liked the backstory on `The Caretaker' and how everything comes full circle.  He's kind of a serial killer with a big heart.  Too big of a heart actually.And who knew saline implants light up?  I learned something new from this film (and my husband hit rewind three times).  That and what a fruit picker is.  It's a metal device used to pick the fruit in trees that you can't reach.

1134602,A1DURK17MGKBEB,B00123Y95Q,Ben Wasden,"[3, 3]","The Caretaker is as middle of the road and as average as a teen slasher can get. There's a group of attractive teenagers. It takes place on a holiday. Halloween, to be specific. And there's a killer with a backstory stalking them. Oh, and there's very little gore. Still, as a die-hard slasher fan, I did get some enjoyment out of this.Jennifer Tilly is probably the best thing about this movie, other than the Caretaker himself. She is at her campy best here, playing a sex bomb teacher who tries to seduce one of her hunky students. Also, there is some humor. The character of Topher farts not once, but twice in the films duration. He even burps in one scene!See The Caretaker if you enjoyed the Prom Night remake or Sorority Row, because it sort of reminded me of both of those in tone.

1134603,A33EN2ZL2MS0CI,B00123Y95Q,Compay,"[8, 10]","The Caretaker is about what you'd expect for most straight-to-video horror flicks.  It's basically a slasher flick with an attractive cast, though it wouldn't satisfy the appetite of your average horror fan.The movie has a simple plot, bland cinematography, a fairly predictable ending, and an unusual lack of gore.  Despite being a slasher movie, most of the kill scenes are fairly tame and uneventful.  There's also a noticeable lack of blood in a movie that's based on a psychopathic killer preying on teens.What makes The Caretaker watchable is really the cast.  All of the actresses in the film are beautiful, from curvy Lola Davidson (the only actress with a nude scene) to sexy Jennifer Freeman from ""My Wife and Kids.""  What interested me most was that the film starred the smoking hot Jennifer Tilly.  It's impossible to believe that she's now in her 50's, as Tilly looks incredible in this film.  Expect an amazingly sexy Tilly in a seductive outfit, which is honestly the most redeeming aspect of the film.If you're a fan of Judd Nelson, you might as well pass on this film.  Nelson unfortunately has only about three minutes of screen time in the movie.  I can't help but think it's a little deceptive that he doesn't get top billing in the movie credits, but his name appears on the DVD cover.Overall, The Caretaker is at best an average horror flick.  It's not especially scary, and it's very mild as far as slasher films are concerned.

They tell the story of an obsessively jealous man, who locked up his wife, and after she birthed their child, he killed her. An innocent plan to scare the girls goes awry, when they find their limo driver dead, stumble upon another dead dude in the house, and then they start getting plinked off one by one.Miss Perry (Jennifer Tilly), a teacher from the school, shows up and further confirms the truth of the story, but has her own agenda and tries to seduce Topher, who gets whacked before she can finish.One by one, they meet the wrath of The Caretaker's weapon, a metal fruit picker. The only one left standing is Ella, the new girl in town, who's picked up by her father (Judd Nelson), but what becomes of The Caretaker?Hot chicks, a little nudity, a maniac killer, and Jennifer Tilly and her cleavage, need I say more? Although the kills were pretty lame, and the murder weapon even lamer (but original), this was a decent movie. It's one that appeals to a wide audience, zoning in on the teen horror fan (although it has an R-rating), as the blood and gore are fairly tame, the storyline is relatable (teen stereotypes and antics), and it's packed with good looking young actors. But, me being the analytical movie watcher I am, I didn't quite understand The Caretaker's motivation to kill, was he just a psychopath who couldn't control his obsession, or simply just the bad grapefruit of the bunch?It's a film I'd watch again, and maybe another viewing will bring more to light. I would've liked to have seen some special features offered, maybe an interview with Jenn and Judd or some outtakes, and also a chapter selection, but outside of the language selections, this was a bare-bones DVD.For more reviews, see [...]",3,It caters to a teen audience...,1204243200,"02 29, 2008",2008,2005,"['Humor', '3Blood', '2Nudity', '2Minutes', ""FF'ed"", 'thru', 'noneOverall', 'rating', '3.5Memorable', 'quotes', 'Derrik', 'look', 'boob-o-lanterns', 'Instead', 'going', 'Halloween', 'dance', 'Topher', 'Snail', 'Ricky', 'take', 'ladies', 'Ella', 'Chloe', 'Sonya', 'abandoned', 'house', 'where', 'Caretaker', 'once', 'lived', 'tell', 'story', 'obsessively', 'jealous', 'man', 'who', 'locked', 'up', 'wife', 'birthed', 'child', 'killed', 'innocent', 'plan', 'scare', 'girls', 'awry', 'when', 'find', 'limo', 'driver', 'dead', 'stumble', 'dead', 'dude', 'house', 'then', 'start', 'getting', 'plinked', 'off', 'one', 'one.Miss', 'Perry', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'teacher', 'school', 'up', 'further', 'truth', 'story', 'own', 'agenda', 'tries', 'seduce', 'Topher', 'who', 'whacked', 'can', 'finish.One', 'one', 'meet', 'wrath', 'Caretaker', 'weapon', 'metal', 'fruit', 'picker', 'only', 'one', 'left', 'standing', 'Ella', 'new', 'girl', 'town', 'who', 'picked', 'up', 'father', 'Judd', 'Nelson', 'what', 'Caretaker', 'Hot', 'chicks', 'little', 'nudity', 'maniac', 'killer', 'Jennifer', 'Tilly', 'cleavage', 'need', 'say', 'more', 'kills', 'were', 'pretty', 'lame', 'murder', 'weapon', 'even', 'lamer', 'original', 'was', 'decent', 'movie', 'one', 'appeals', 'wide', 'audience', 'zoning', 'teen', 'horror', 'fan', 'R-rating', 'blood', 'gore', 'are', 'fairly', 'tame', 'storyline', 'relatable', 'teen', 'stereotypes', 'antics', 'packed', 'good', 'looking', 'young', 'actors', 'being', 'analytical', 'movie', 'watcher', 'am', 'did', ""n't"", 'quite', 'understand', 'Caretaker', 'motivation', 'kill', 'was', 'just', 'psychopath', 'who', 'could', ""n't"", 'control', 'obsession', 'simply', 'just', 'bad', 'grapefruit', 'bunch', 'film', ""'d"", 'watch', 'again', 'maybe', 'viewing', 'will', 'bring', 'more', 'light', 'would', ""'ve"", 'liked', 'have', 'seen', 'special', 'features', 'offered', 'maybe', 'interview', 'Jenn', 'Judd', 'outtakes', 'also', 'chapter', 'selection', 'language', 'selections', 'was', 'bare-bones', 'DVD.For', 'more', 'reviews', 'see', '[', ']']",The Caretaker

1134611,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B00123Y95Q,Thomas M. Sipos,"[3, 5]","THE CARETAKER is a very short, very low budget affair. Only an hour and 17 minutes long (not including credits).These generic teenagers meet outside a school dance on Halloween night. And they stay outside. We never go into the building and see the dance itself. (I said this was a low budget affair.)How low budget? Only a few locations. Most of the film was shot at and around a farmhouse (a few rooms and a field) and inside a limo. Then brief scenes outside the Halloween dance, and in a girl's bedroom, and in a ""gym"" (it could have been the producer's basement.)Anyway, the teens meet up outside the dance. The guys had rented a limo, and they take the girls to an abandoned farmhouse, where they'd planned to scare the girls. But it turns out their ""scary story"" of an insane caretaker is real ... and the caretaker has returned from the asylum (or wherever) that very night ... and, as you might guess, the body count mounts.The DVD box's marketing is pretty brazen, calling THE CARETAKER a ""classic teen scream."" Based on what?The box brags about the film's ""ensemble cast of ridiculously good-looking kids."" Well, no. They're good-looking, but only in a bland, generic sense. No one displays any charisma or outstanding beauty.The cast's bland good looks are matched by their bland acting, as they mouth bland, flat writing.The film's promo material says the film is low on gore. It also positions THE CARETAKER as the next SCREAM, promising ""laughs and camp.""Yes, it's low on gore. But it's also low on laughs.THE CARETAKER is a numbingly unoriginal film, even by slasher standards. I suspect this may be intentional. As ""camp,"" it probably hopes to satirize horror film clich&eacute;s.Bad choice. This film is not funny. And for good reason. These slasher film clich&eacute;s were old when SCREAM satirized them in 1996 (though SCREAM had more energy than THE CARETAKER). These clich&eacute;s had already been targeted by 1981's STUDENT BODIES.There's nothing left for THE CARETAKER to satirize. Its targets are so old, I couldn't even find any attempted jokes until nearly an hour into the film, when the Jennifer Tilly character started babbling idiotically. I then thought, okay, I'm probably supposed to laugh at this. I can see how somebody might think this is funny, in an insipid sitcom sense.Tilly's character is so dummied down, she just mugs for the camera -- no real acting. Judd Nelson has a few minutes of screen time in a cameo.I suspect (I'm guessing here) that the ""jokes"" are supposed to be that the characters (mostly teenagers) are stupid. But many horror films are already so full of stupid teenagers that ""satirizing"" stupid teenagers becomes difficult. THE CARETAKER's stupid teenagers aren't really any dumber than any typical horror film's teenagers.THE CARETAKER does attempt to ""update"" its story, such as when the teens say, ""This happened in, like, ancient times. Like, the 1980s."" (Ho! Ho! -- How's that for belly laughs? That's about as funny and original as this film's dialog gets.)There's nothing new in THE CARETAKER, either as satire or as horror.It's an okay film, I guess.
