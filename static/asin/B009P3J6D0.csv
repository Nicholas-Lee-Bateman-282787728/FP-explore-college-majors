1601129,A106YXO3EHVD3J,B009P3J6D0,"DR SHOCK ""MR. KIA RETURNS! ;-b""","[2, 2]","I grew up watching this cute and funny show. A show about a recently widowed father and his young son. The chemistry between Bixby and Cruz are really what make this show such a treat. Of course the supporting cast is also good with Mrs. Livingston the Asian housekeeper, Uncle Norman and Tina two friends of the two. Even the dated late 60's theme doesn't hurt this show because the real values haven't changed or at least they shouldn't have.The show holds up surprisingly well and all 24 first season episodes are here on this four disc set. They look quite good too and it doesn't appear that anything is cut out as they run around 26 minutes each. The theme song is also unforgettable and is an important part of the lead in for each episode. Nilsson wrote and performs the catchy number and he adds variations of the theme throughout the episodes.Season2 is very good, but I personally like season 1 the best because I think the show works best when Eddie is younger, but that's not to say this season doesn't has some great episodes.If you've been looking for this show look no further as this is about as good as it's going to get. WB has released the other two seasons and they are a bit expensive, but I really enjoyed seeing this again. ......people let me tell ya 'bout my best friend!",5,THE FIRST SEASON IS THE BEST BUT IT'S GREAT TO SEE THIS SHOW RELEASED TO HOME VIDEO!,1399593600,"05 9, 2014",2014,1297,"['grew', 'up', 'watching', 'cute', 'funny', 'show', 'show', 'recently', 'widowed', 'father', 'young', 'son', 'chemistry', 'Bixby', 'Cruz', 'are', 'really', 'what', 'make', 'show', 'treat', 'course', 'supporting', 'cast', 'also', 'good', 'Mrs.', 'Livingston', 'Asian', 'housekeeper', 'Uncle', 'Norman', 'Tina', 'two', 'friends', 'two', 'Even', 'dated', 'late', '60', 'theme', ""n't"", 'hurt', 'show', 'real', 'values', 'have', ""n't"", 'changed', 'least', 'should', ""n't"", 'have.The', 'show', 'up', 'surprisingly', 'well', '24', 'first', 'season', 'episodes', 'are', 'here', 'four', 'disc', 'set', 'look', 'quite', 'good', 'too', ""n't"", 'appear', 'anything', 'cut', 'out', 'run', 'around', '26', 'minutes', 'theme', 'song', 'also', 'unforgettable', 'important', 'part', 'lead', 'episode', 'Nilsson', 'wrote', 'catchy', 'number', 'variations', 'theme', 'episodes.Season2', 'very', 'good', 'personally', 'season', '1', 'best', 'think', 'show', 'best', 'when', 'Eddie', 'younger', 'not', 'say', 'season', ""n't"", 'great', 'episodes.If', ""'ve"", 'been', 'looking', 'show', 'look', 'further', 'about', 'as', 'good', 'going', 'get', 'WB', 'released', 'other', 'two', 'seasons', 'are', 'bit', 'expensive', 'really', 'enjoyed', 'seeing', 'again', 'people', 'let', 'tell', 'ya', 'best', 'friend']",The Courtship of Eddie's Father: The Complete Second Season
1601130,A2U7BHVRDGDDMK,B009P3J6D0,for the record...,"[3, 3]","This 60's series was a real game-changer in terms of father/son dynamics in tv sitcoms: a far cry from the &#34;Leave It To Beaver&#34;/&#34;Father Knows Best&#34; paradigm, this show felt real, not a &#34;situation&#34; comedy - the humor came from real experiences, told with grace and style. Its innocence, unflinching honesty, and above all, stellar acting from the entire ensemble made this a standout then, and it remains as timeless, enjoyable and frequently poignant as anything comparable on television today - although you'd be hard-pressed to find anything on tv today that even comes close. I related to this show as a child, and as an adult, I find even more to enjoy here - so much so, that I'll even forgive the perfunctory laugh-track (which this show probably could've done without - and would have made it even more groundbreaking.) But that's a minor quibble. Those opening dialogues between Bill Bixby and Brandon Cruz were priceless - what kid (me included) could watch this show and not wish for such a loving, beautiful relationship. And the incidental music by Harry Nilsson was the icing on the cake. Highly, highly, highly recommended. A television milestone along the lines of &#34;Julia.&#34;",5,Brilliant and Timeless!,1386979200,"12 14, 2013",2013,1220,"['60', 'series', 'was', 'real', 'game-changer', 'terms', 'father/son', 'dynamics', 'tv', 'sitcoms', 'far', 'cry', '34', 'Leave', 'Beaver', '34', '/', '34', 'Father', 'Knows', 'Best', '34', 'paradigm', 'show', 'felt', 'real', 'not', '34', 'situation', '34', 'comedy', 'humor', 'came', 'real', 'experiences', 'told', 'grace', 'style', 'innocence', 'unflinching', 'honesty', 'stellar', 'acting', 'entire', 'ensemble', 'made', 'standout', 'then', 'timeless', 'enjoyable', 'frequently', 'poignant', 'anything', 'comparable', 'television', 'today', ""'d"", 'be', 'hard-pressed', 'find', 'anything', 'tv', 'today', 'even', 'close', 'related', 'show', 'child', 'adult', 'find', 'even', 'more', 'enjoy', 'here', 'so', 'much', 'so', ""'ll"", 'even', 'forgive', 'perfunctory', 'laugh-track', 'show', 'probably', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'would', 'have', 'made', 'even', 'more', 'groundbreaking', 'minor', 'quibble', 'opening', 'dialogues', 'Bill', 'Bixby', 'Brandon', 'Cruz', 'were', 'priceless', 'what', 'kid', 'included', 'could', 'watch', 'show', 'not', 'wish', 'such', 'loving', 'beautiful', 'relationship', 'incidental', 'music', 'Harry', 'Nilsson', 'was', 'icing', 'cake', 'Highly', 'highly', 'highly', 'recommended', 'television', 'milestone', 'lines', '34', 'Julia.', '34']",The Courtship of Eddie's Father: The Complete Second Season

I loved its charm and innocence, and Bill Bixby seemed to be America's favorite dad at the time.

I am very thankful this adorable television series was released to DVD and I hope that eventually we will see Season 3 available for purchase to complete the collection.

1601132,A19YT97IYC101S,B009P3J6D0,"J. L. Alberti ""Just A Film Fan""","[3, 3]","This is a well made series that really captured an outstanding relationship between a father and his son. This season seems to shift the focus from Tom's work to his personal relationships. Not that the first season didn't but there is far less about him balancing his job and being a father. He seems to have licked that issue so he doesn't have to make decisions on what is important.When told he was good with kids the very humble Tom Corbett replies, &#34;Kids are good with me, I'm just lucky.&#34; Wow! I don't remember my dad or any of my friend's saying that. In the late 60's, early 70's this wasn't a normal attitude. It was still nurturing mom and working dad so COEF was ahead of it's time. While the movie ended with Eddie getting a mom, the series did not see that as a means to an end. Tom's romantic failures bring him closer to Eddie and make him realize how tough a job his wife had.The first season was an MOD and the discs were typical DVD-R. These appear to be pressed discs so maybe the 1st season showed Warner the should be made en masse. The price is the same, however.No complaints here. All the episodes look very good for their age.
