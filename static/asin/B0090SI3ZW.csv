He actually did the score to the movie Ghost Dog years back, and that was a very cool movie with a tantalizing, thought stimulating sound.The problem is I'm not really a big Kung Fu fan, but I had to see this because of Rza.  The fight scenes were certainly overkill, with blood squirting out like fire hydrants.  The sexual content was also overdone and distracting, unless your the type of person that enjoys porn.I did like the Rza's character though.  Kind of a subdued, outsider with a good heart.

1580232,ATHNYP7D3RW1A,B0090SI3ZW,A. Gavin,"[0, 0]","I must preface by saying that I like Kung Fu movies -- and I've seen my share of them. The Man with the Iron Fists has the body of a new style Chinese Martial Arts film like House of the Flying Daggers, the brains of Enter the Dragon, and the soul of Machete -- although it's not nearly as much fun as Robert Rodriquez's similar riff on the Mexican Gangster film. Fists isn't really a Chinese film at all, although plenty of the talent is from the Middle Kingdom, but instead is a re-envisioned fantasy of the Kung Fu genre through the eyes of Wu-Tang mastermind and rapper RZA. He wrote, directed, and starred.There's a lot to like in this film (as a Kung Fu fan). The characters are pretty memorable in a comic book, kung fu, video game kind of way. They each have their own weapons, powers, and gimmicks. A few of them are even well acted (or over acted) like Russell Crowe's entertaining performance as Jack Knife or Lucy Liu as Black Widow. Many have bad hair.RZA and his titular character forms the weakest link. He's just flat. His voice over is hard to understand and the rapper voice narrating Kung Fu feels totally out of place. But his music's good. And despite some nearly incoherent editing and minimal storytelling, the overall style is pretty decent.The villains are pretty darn cheesy, particularly the heavy metal fright wig hair styles of the Lion Clan, but whatever, it's a campy almost spoof of the Kung Fu genre. It's gory as hell too, but despite numerous brothel scenes, strangely chaste (no nudity at all). Hmmm, there's that weird violence is better than sex thing. What gives? A big chunk of backstory on RZA's character shoved into the middle of the film is a total snooze-a-rama, but other than  that, the action scenes are exciting and the brothel scenes funny, so if you like the genre, go for it. Just remember, it's just no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and not even up to the standards of Kung Fu Hustle.Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimed",2,More than a little cheesy,1363824000,"03 21, 2013",2013,1991,"['must', 'preface', 'saying', 'like', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'movies', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'share', 'Man', 'Iron', 'Fists', 'body', 'new', 'style', 'Chinese', 'Martial', 'Arts', 'film', 'House', 'Flying', 'Daggers', 'brains', 'Enter', 'Dragon', 'soul', 'Machete', 'not', 'nearly', 'as', 'much', 'fun', 'Robert', 'Rodriquez', 'similar', 'riff', 'Mexican', 'Gangster', 'film', 'Fists', ""n't"", 'really', 'Chinese', 'film', 'plenty', 'talent', 'Middle', 'Kingdom', 'instead', 're-envisioned', 'fantasy', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'genre', 'eyes', 'Wu-Tang', 'mastermind', 'rapper', 'RZA', 'wrote', 'directed', 'starred.There', 'lot', 'like', 'film', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'fan', 'characters', 'are', 'pretty', 'memorable', 'comic', 'book', 'kung', 'fu', 'video', 'game', 'kind', 'way', 'have', 'own', 'weapons', 'powers', 'gimmicks', 'few', 'are', 'even', 'well', 'acted', 'over', 'acted', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'entertaining', 'performance', 'Jack', 'Knife', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Black', 'Widow', 'Many', 'have', 'bad', 'hair.RZA', 'titular', 'character', 'weakest', 'link', 'just', 'flat', 'voice', 'hard', 'understand', 'rapper', 'voice', 'narrating', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'feels', 'totally', 'place', 'music', 'good', 'nearly', 'incoherent', 'editing', 'minimal', 'storytelling', 'overall', 'style', 'pretty', 'decent.The', 'villains', 'are', 'pretty', 'darn', 'cheesy', 'particularly', 'heavy', 'metal', 'fright', 'wig', 'hair', 'styles', 'Lion', 'Clan', 'whatever', 'campy', 'almost', 'spoof', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'genre', 'gory', 'hell', 'too', 'numerous', 'brothel', 'scenes', 'strangely', 'chaste', 'nudity', 'Hmmm', 'weird', 'violence', 'better', 'sex', 'thing', 'What', 'big', 'chunk', 'backstory', 'RZA', 'character', 'shoved', 'middle', 'film', 'total', 'snooze-a-rama', 'other', 'action', 'scenes', 'are', 'exciting', 'brothel', 'scenes', 'funny', 'so', 'like', 'genre', 'go', 'Just', 'remember', 'just', 'Crouching', 'Tiger', 'Hidden', 'Dragon', 'not', 'even', 'standards', 'Kung', 'Fu', 'Hustle.Andy', 'Gavin', 'author', 'Darkening', 'Dream', 'Untimed']",N/A

I mean I honestly believe there was great vision here and you could cherry pick some amazing imagery through-out the film, but the actual movie between those still shots was quite horrible.I think if the movie had fewer characters, RZA could have focused on developing more of a story. Not to mention, there seems to be a lack of details plaguing the entire film. Like bad guys who could act, for instance. Bautista was the only bad guy who could act worth a damn and he barely spoke. This is sad, because that's not saying much as he's a goddamn WWE wrestler. attention to detail in all of the scenes tying the movie and story together was needed tbh. This movie could have and should have been better. This was supposedly the product of what the RZA learned after &#34;studying&#34; under Tarrantino. I mean WTF were you guys doing?The CGI effects were mostly halfassed and mostly not needed. Bautista's brass body effect , for instance, could have been done much better or at least more sparingly with some imagination to greater effect.(I would have warned spoilers, but this turkey is already rotten)The greatest crime to the cinema here was the sound track. At times the music just did not match what was happening on film. Instead of helping you immerse into a scene, it only further disconnects you and that's just bad. And I don't mean the hiphop; that stuff was actually good. I mean some of the other music was just wrong for the scenes they were placed in. I expected more than this from RZA.All said and done. I hope RZA works on more movies and learns from this. I saw a movie I could have loved if it had been done right and I hope to see more that come closer in the future.

Wasn't able to see it in theaters, but was excited when it was available on video.  When I saw who handled it I thought ""Aww S***!  Here we go."".  It's the RZA's Homage to the classic Kung Fu flicks He loves.  This could be just be me, but I saw elements of Ninja Scroll in this flick.I'll try to break this review down to the best of my abilities.THE GOOD:The characters were very creative. RZA is the skilled village black smith with story narration.  Russel Crowe as Mr. Knife was quite amusing.  His weapons were neat.  Lucy Lui owns/owns a brothel, but her true identity & intentions is reveiled towards the end.  Former wrestling star David Bautista as Brass Body.  Need I say more?  Rick Yune as X-Blade, a walking swiss army knife, so to speak.  Plus a few more.The action was incredible.  At times, over the top with its numerous graphic scenes.  If all you care about is action, this movie would be up your alley.THE BAD:The plot.  Though there was one, it was scattered.  Highly unorganized.Though this movie was capturing the spirit of the kung fu genre, it really isn't a Kung Fu movie.  The fight scenes didn't really display much kung fu in my opinion. The fight scenes were over the top, but not really kung fu.  I can see where kung fu fans had a hard time with this.The editing, how can I put this, was SLOPPY.  What little kung fu that was displayed, was stunted due to the editing.Fast editing cuts work, if done right.  At times, it made the movie look like a complete mess.Then there's the RZA.  If he plans to star in a movie he directs, I would hope he'd spend extra time on his choreography in the future.  His fighting, or lack there of, was a kiddy pool filled with misery.  To make it worse, they tried to hide his handicap with special effects.I don't how well it would've done without Tarantino's name slapped on it, but all and all I did enjoy the movie.  It's worth a watch.  RZA pays his respects to Kung Fu flicks in his own vision.  I have no issues adding it to my collection.

1580303,A24PMZJF0LHGCW,B0090SI3ZW,Gilby Mitnick III Jr.,"[6, 29]","I have always been a huge fan of the Kiwi actor, Russell Crowe, ever since he, back in 2005, confronted the American singer called Moby in a bathroom and a/s/sailed him with a bunch of anti-American slurs. I think that alone qualifies Crowe as the greatest actor the world has ever seen...if you do not count Carrot Top, Pauly Shore and Tom Green, of course! I'm glad to see him back in this martial arts movie conceived of by none other than RZA, who is a rapper from the Wu-Tang Clan and a 110 percent, hardcore Obama voter, to be sure.This highly poetic movie that is best enjoyed like you would a fine glass of wine centers around RZA, a blacksmith, who fashions highly complex weapons of destruction for a small village located inside of Chinatown. After a person who is planning to commit treason (also known as a traitor) menaces the village, the blacksmith teams up with both good guys and bad guys to defend the community of wonton soup-enjoyers. As you can see from this plot description alone, this movie will likely be the movie nominated for the most Oscars, on account of its extreme, arthouse quality and attention to method acting.Since this is a martial arts movie, I was not at all surprised to see Carl Douglas make several cameos while singing Kung F/u Fighting, which was easily...easily the sole highlight of this entire train-wreck of a film. I am, nonetheless, a little bit worried about the implied racism with his cameos because they are essentially a black man singing about Asian people in Kung F/u Fighting, which means two minority groups are mercilessly referenced...true racism if I ever saw it! However, a small upside was the brilliant and inspired casting of Dave ""The Manimal"" Bautista as one of the rice-eating villagers in this funky tale. I was especially impressed with him powerbombing, bodyslamming and spinebusting Russell Crowe and the rapper from Wu-Tang Clan several times over. That is surely powerful filmmaking at its most awesomest.I am going to go out on a small limb here and make a prediction: The Man with the Iron Fists will easily sashay away with the Best Picture Oscar in 2013. You heard it here from me first, people. Just remember that when all those a-h/o/l/e/s at Entertainment Tonight are taking credit for making this prediction when Oscar season rolls around, okay?

Here he expands his influence by conceiving, writing, composing the musical score, directing and starring in this very strange movierama ,THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS.Madame Blossom summarizes the plot by saying `Power belongs to no one, until it is seized through sex or violence.'  One critic was able to give the pan for the story as follows: `In Jungle Village, the leader of the Lion's clan Gold Lion is summoned by the Governor (Terence Yin) and assigned to protect his gold that will be transported through the village. However he is betrayed and murdered by the greedy Silver Lion (lawyer/actor Byron Mann) and Bronze Lion (Cung Le). Gold Lion's favorite son Zen Yi, a.k.a. The X-Blade (Korean American famous fashion model Rick Yune), seeks revenge and heads to Jungle Village, but he is defeated by Brass Body (Dave Bautista) and rescued by the local Blacksmith Thaddeus (RZA). Meanwhile the Gemini Female (Grace Huang) and the Gemini Male (Andrew Lin) protect the Governor's gold, but they are vanquished by the army of Silver and Bronze Lion. The Blacksmith is abducted by the Lions and has his arms severed by Brass Body. However he is saved by the British Jack Knife (Russell Crowe), who is the emissary of the Emperor, and he manufactures iron arms for Thaddeus. Meanwhile the Governor sends the Jackal army to fight against the Lions and they hide the gold in the brothel of Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu). However, Madam Blossom and his girls form an army of black widows and together with Jack, Zen Yi and The Blacksmith, they fight against the Lions.Great costumes, extraordinary hair styles for men, pretty sets, flying action and blood blood blood are the main attractions here.  The story is supposedly set in feudal China but much of the dialogue and situations are very much of this decade. Filmed in Hong Kong and the US the characters are basically an Asian mix of what appears to be a cluster of American actors. One is left wondering how such people as Russell Crowe, Pam Grier (she plays RZA's mother) and Lucy Liu (and what did the publicized Quentin Tarantino do in this picture?) connected to this extended Oriental rap session. But in the end, if silly dialogue and absurd fights and lack of plot make for a colorful evening's escapist entertainment, then here it is.

1580318,A2HVL790PBWYTU,B0090SI3ZW,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[1, 4]","RZA waited a long time to tell this story, this brainchild of his, inspired by untold hours of viewing kung-fu flicks during his formative years. The Shaw Brothers as baby sitters? Sure, why not. RZA grew up sort of a historian on kung fu pictures, this guy from Brooklyn who can go toe to toe, trivia for trivia, with Hong Kong action cinema experts like Bey Logan. And how does RZA's THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS stack up against classics like THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN, MAD MONKEY KUNG FU, and THE FIVE DEADLY VENOMS?Okay, THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS isn't the best martial arts film released stateside this year (That would be Iko Uwais's THE RAID: REDEMPTION). Whereas THE RAID: REDEMPTION grounded itself in vicious but realistic combat sequences, RZA's pet project is more steeped in the bizarre and the fanciful. A mythical element creeps in. In RZA's personal vision of wuxia, a fighter's flesh can transmutate into metal. A laborer, by dint of will power, can animate his prostheses. It's a fun show.In the 19th century, the freed slave Thaddeus Henry Smith (RZA) made his way to feudal China, and in the tiny Jungle Village has made a home. Thaddeus is a gifted blacksmith, a peaceful, quiet man. Except that the rough characters in Jungle Village frequently contract his metal-shaping services. And so the blacksmith reluctantly perverts the lessons he'd learned, and he forges jagged weapons of mayhem. Thaddeus's only haven lies in the arms of Lady Silk (Jamie Chung), a courtesan in the local brothel. He dreams of earning enough gold to buy out Lady Silk's contract from the brothel's madame (Lucy Liu). Then they'd go away together. So he keeps on making killing weapons. He turns a blind eye to his conscience.RZA's blacksmith is only one character in a plot that revolves around the Governor's gold shipment, and how all manner of hooligans go all out to obtain it. The central villain is the duplicitous Silver Lion (Byron Mann) of the Lion clan, him what just ruthlessly betrayed his leader, Gold Lion. Fast approaching is Zen Yi (Rick Yune), revenge-inclined son of Gold Lion and wearer of a suit of nasty blades. Today Silver Lion and his minions ride roughshod over Jungle Village. And is it a coincidence that Jungle Village is one of the stops in the gold shipment's itinerary? Does a bear crap in the woods? Is RZA fond of letters in caps?I admire RZA's efforts. Dude's a quadruple threat: he wrote, scored, directed, and acted in this movie. Those into martial arts movies may be aware of RZA's rep as a hardcore addict of kung fu cinema. RZA's been known to drop an audio commentary or two for past DVD releases (like THE 36TH CHAMBER OF SHAOLIN). Don't be surprised when RZA manages to rep the Shaolin Temple in a flashback sequence. Me, I enjoyed THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS. I wish that RZA hadn't been so understated in his performance. As the prohibitive protagonist, the sleepy-eyed RZA needed to generate more energy, more life. Thankfully, Russell Crowe picks up the slack, provides the swagger and the big personality as the enigmatic (and amusingly lecherous) Englishman, Jack (or ""Mr. Knife""). Jack Knife is shady, his motivations murky. All we know is that he loves women and that he always brings a gun to a knife fight. You're kept guessing until the third act just which side he'll fall on. THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS is packed with amped-up wire-fu theatrics. The violence is brutal but so exaggerated it achieves an almost cartoonish vibe. Set your eyeballs on alert for cameos by Pam Grier and Hong Kong legend Gordon Liu. MMA fighter Cung Le has a supporting bit as Bronze Lion. As a bonus for the theater goer, THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS is presented by an onscreen Quentin Tarantino, after which he introduces a trailer for his upcoming DJANGO UNCHAINED.",4,"""When you forge a weapon you need three things: the right metal, temperatures over 1400 degrees, and someone who wants to kill.""",1352505600,"11 10, 2012",2012,3807,"['RZA', 'waited', 'long', 'time', 'tell', 'story', 'brainchild', 'inspired', 'untold', 'hours', 'viewing', 'kung-fu', 'flicks', 'formative', 'years', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'baby', 'sitters', 'Sure', 'why', 'not', 'RZA', 'grew', 'up', 'sort', 'historian', 'kung', 'fu', 'pictures', 'guy', 'Brooklyn', 'who', 'can', 'go', 'toe', 'toe', 'trivia', 'trivia', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'action', 'cinema', 'experts', 'Bey', 'Logan', 'how', 'RZA', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WITH', 'THE', 'IRON', 'FISTS', 'stack', 'up', 'classics', '36TH', 'CHAMBER', 'OF', 'SHAOLIN', 'MAD', 'MONKEY', 'KUNG', 'FU', 'THE', 'FIVE', 'DEADLY', 'VENOMS', 'Okay', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WITH', 'THE', 'IRON', 'FISTS', ""n't"", 'best', 'martial', 'arts', 'film', 'released', 'stateside', 'year', 'would', 'be', 'Iko', 'Uwais', 'THE', 'RAID', 'REDEMPTION', 'RAID', 'REDEMPTION', 'grounded', 'vicious', 'realistic', 'combat', 'sequences', 'RZA', 'pet', 'project', 'more', 'steeped', 'bizarre', 'fanciful', 'mythical', 'element', 'creeps', 'RZA', 'personal', 'vision', 'wuxia', 'fighter', 'flesh', 'can', 'transmutate', 'metal', 'laborer', 'dint', 'will', 'power', 'can', 'animate', 'prostheses', 'fun', '19th', 'century', 'freed', 'slave', 'Thaddeus', 'Henry', 'Smith', 'RZA', 'made', 'way', 'feudal', 'China', 'tiny', 'Jungle', 'Village', 'made', 'home', 'Thaddeus', 'gifted', 'blacksmith', 'peaceful', 'quiet', 'man', 'rough', 'characters', 'Jungle', 'Village', 'frequently', 'contract', 'metal-shaping', 'services', 'so', 'blacksmith', 'reluctantly', 'lessons', ""'d"", 'learned', 'jagged', 'weapons', 'mayhem', 'Thaddeus', 'only', 'haven', 'lies', 'arms', 'Lady', 'Silk', 'Jamie', 'Chung', 'courtesan', 'local', 'brothel', 'earning', 'enough', 'gold', 'buy', 'out', 'Lady', 'Silk', 'contract', 'brothel', 'madame', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'Then', ""'d"", 'go', 'away', 'together', 'making', 'killing', 'weapons', 'blind', 'eye', 'conscience.RZA', 'blacksmith', 'only', 'one', 'character', 'plot', 'Governor', 'gold', 'shipment', 'how', 'manner', 'hooligans', 'go', 'out', 'obtain', 'central', 'villain', 'duplicitous', 'Silver', 'Lion', 'Byron', 'Mann', 'Lion', 'clan', 'what', 'just', 'ruthlessly', 'betrayed', 'leader', 'Gold', 'Lion', 'Fast', 'approaching', 'Zen', 'Yi', 'Rick', 'Yune', 'revenge-inclined', 'son', 'Gold', 'Lion', 'wearer', 'suit', 'nasty', 'blades', 'Today', 'Silver', 'Lion', 'minions', 'ride', 'roughshod', 'Jungle', 'Village', 'coincidence', 'Jungle', 'Village', 'one', 'stops', 'gold', 'shipment', 'itinerary', 'bear', 'crap', 'woods', 'RZA', 'fond', 'letters', 'caps', 'admire', 'RZA', 'efforts', 'Dude', 'quadruple', 'threat', 'wrote', 'scored', 'directed', 'acted', 'movie', 'martial', 'arts', 'movies', 'may', 'be', 'aware', 'RZA', 'rep', 'hardcore', 'addict', 'kung', 'fu', 'cinema', 'RZA', 'been', 'known', 'drop', 'audio', 'commentary', 'two', 'past', 'DVD', 'releases', '36TH', 'CHAMBER', 'OF', 'SHAOLIN', 'Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'surprised', 'when', 'RZA', 'rep', 'Shaolin', 'Temple', 'flashback', 'sequence', 'Me', 'enjoyed', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WITH', 'THE', 'IRON', 'FISTS', 'wish', 'RZA', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'so', 'understated', 'performance', 'prohibitive', 'protagonist', 'sleepy-eyed', 'RZA', 'needed', 'generate', 'more', 'energy', 'more', 'life', 'Thankfully', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'up', 'slack', 'swagger', 'big', 'personality', 'enigmatic', 'amusingly', 'lecherous', 'Englishman', 'Jack', 'Mr', 'Knife', 'Jack', 'Knife', 'shady', 'motivations', 'murky', 'know', 'women', 'always', 'gun', 'knife', 'fight', ""'re"", 'kept', 'guessing', 'third', 'act', 'just', 'side', ""'ll"", 'fall', 'MAN', 'THE', 'IRON', 'FISTS', 'packed', 'amped-up', 'wire-fu', 'theatrics', 'violence', 'brutal', 'so', 'exaggerated', 'almost', 'cartoonish', 'vibe', 'Set', 'eyeballs', 'alert', 'cameos', 'Pam', 'Grier', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'legend', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'MMA', 'fighter', 'Cung', 'Le', 'supporting', 'bit', 'Bronze', 'Lion', 'bonus', 'theater', 'goer', 'THE', 'MAN', 'WITH', 'THE', 'IRON', 'FISTS', 'presented', 'onscreen', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'trailer', 'upcoming', 'DJANGO', 'UNCHAINED']",N/A

The intended audience is for people who want to watch a kick ass movie with awesome kung fu fight scenes and they fail miserably at that. None of the characters have any charm or ""coolness"" about them that all classic kung fu movies have. Russell Crowe, is the only one with any grit or screen presence but even his notable acting chops and charisma can't elevate this sorry excuse of an action movie.You know why people love old school kung fu movies? Because of the action, the stars that perform amazing kung fu moves, the wacky but charming stories/characters are always secondary to the action. We love action movies and if you give us this in spades, we will endure any plot holes, annoying characters, cheesy comedy bits, terrible dialogue and non-existent or plausible character development or twists.There is too much wire fu and flashy, close up editing that robs the viewer of any appreciation of the physical skills or fight choreographed intricacies. We see lots of blood and gore (decapitations, mutilations, blood squirts, skull and knee smashing) but we hardly ever see any actual fighting! We see people fly (via obvious use of wires) on top of a table, yell, and then we see a semblance of limbs flailing around but mostly a close up an ugly face. That killed any leniency I had already built up before seeing this boring dreck of an action movie.Would Jackie Chan be so loved if we never actually saw his death-defying stunts and brilliant fight scenes due to MTV ADD like editing? Would Bruce Lee be a movie star icon if we never saw his inhuman speed and power in its entirety? Or better yet would Van Damme be better regarded in his early days if they didn't constantly do a close up of his ass every time he threw his otherwise awesome kicks?Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon had 10x the fight choreography and talent than this dreadful homage to the old school chop socky flicks. Kill Bill has 10x the charm and wit than this garbage.The Raid: Redemption is the current king of modern martial arts movie for me and bonafide classic and a benchmark that all modern kung fu movies must aspire to...this movie is like a generic mid-90's direct-to-video kung fu movie but a needlessly HUGE budget.

However, the movie was still loads of fun and Rza has definitely proven that he has great cinematic vision.  Expect many filmmaking imperfections, but enjoy the fun ride.Thaddeus (director Rza) is a gifted blacksmith whose talents are contracted by local warring clans.  He is pure of heart and wants nothing more than to purchase the freedom of his courtesan wife Lady Silk (Jamie Chung) from the brothel madame Blossom (Lucy Liu basically reprising her Kill Bill role).Thaddeus becomes mixed up in a plot to steal a large shipment of gold.  The main villain is Silver Lion (Byron Mann), who betrays the Lion clan leader with the help of Bronze Lion (Cung Le; Dragon Eyes).  Zen Yi (Rick Yune; Ninja Assassin), the son of the murdered clan leader, sets out to stop Silver Lion with his armor of retractable blades.  Also in the mix is Jack Knife (Russel Crowe), the most interesting and charismatice character (outside of combat) with an interesting taste for bachelor party shenanigans (i.e., Asian call girls, liquor and opium).The fighting in the movie was a mixed bag that will largely disappoint martial arts movie fans.  As the oddly bewigged lion clansman, Cung Le was sadly under-utilized.  He never gets to looks good or show off.  Not even in his finale fight against Lucy Liu.  The choreography presents a mix of very cool and very silly kung fu combat maneuvers.  Sadly, by and large the action is filmed way too close-up.  For me, the combat highlights should all be credited to Bautista's Brass Body.  He seemed to have the coolest scenes, obviously the coolest F/X because of his ability, and some of the most fun choreography that was filmed so that we could actually see it.Despite my complaints about much of the action, the kung fu theater feel was maintained undeniably well.  Rza captured that tone perfectly.  There was also a festive display of spewy-fun gore.The dialogue is dreadfully dry (except for Crowe's delivery).  Rza, God bless him for trying, can't act or effectively narrate.  His character was not only understated, but lacked the lines to justify his purpose.  It seems that Rza was going for a mood-driven film with stylized combat like Bunraku or The Warrior's Way.  I could see his goal, but his meant-to-be-poetic blacksmith character was clearly the weak link in synthesizing this quasi-arthouse-ful conceptual grace.  Rza tries to use a Shaolin Temple training flashback to corroborate Thaddeus' focus and combat ability.  Still, I found him to have zero combat credibility when facing Iron Body--a character who actually earned my respect on screen.The score (also by Rza) was cool during the first scene (a fight scene).  But I noticed less effective use of music later in the movie.  I'm not hating, it was a neat score.  But this was disappointing as I expected to have some awesomely rap-scored fight scenes, but some of them had combat volume drowning out the music, rendering it ineffective even at times that louder music would be appropriate.Director Rza--of the Wu Tang Clan--was always a devout fan of Hong Kong cinema's kung fu theater.  While his direction is clearly fledgling and his scoring ability nothing to his own rapping talent, his passion for classic kung fu movies manifested the greatest strength of this film: the kung fu theater ""feel"" of it all.  His excellent theatrical homage includes some classic kung fu movie components such as the iron body (brass body in the movie) focus style, techniques that are named after characters (e.g., the Gemini stance), the betrayal of one's master and the revenge that follows, the house of mirrors fight (which was unfortunately brief), traps and poison darts, fighters exploding from the ground in ambush and semi-flying combat maneuvers.  Perhaps the most fun was when all of the brothel whores turn out to be ninja-savvy combat-chic assassins.  Rza also covered the bases of kung fu weaponry, including bladed fans, bladed sleeve extensions, chain-fighting, various blades and good-old kung fu.This movie shouldn't have been written AND directed AND scored AND starring Rza.  However, the movie was still loads of fun and Rza has definitely proven that he has great cinematic vision.  I'd like to see him collaborate with more experienced film makers before attempting another solo venture like this.  But I am so glad that I got to see it anyway, imperfections and all.  This was a good debut considering his complete lack of experience since yet more experienced hands have failed to produce such entertainment time and time again.",4,"Rza has definitely proven that he has great cinematic vision.

The rapper takes credit for directing and writing this movie, but I highly doubt it.

The Blacksmith, unexplained, was far more compelling when he was a mystery. They need to leave some of the backstory unexplained, so that your imagination fills in the details, and overwhelm us with groovy action and bloodshed! When they do that the viewer spends allot more time thinking about the movie (ie-the Clone Wars, mentioned in the first 3 Star Wars movies (chronologically, not the stupid episode numbers, the ones from the 70's and 80's); my imagination was supplying a far more interesting scenario than the one Lucas came up with)).

It's easy to fall in love with because it's obviously supposed to be over-the-top and cheesy, but at the same time nothing really feels memorable. To be honest I don't think I've actually seen a kung-fu movie so this is probably my first, but upon doing some research apparently what we see in The Man With The Iron Fists is pretty standard as far as martial arts films go.The story is a little difficult to explain due to the fact that it lacks any sense of direction. Basically we start off with the leader of the Lion clan, Gold Lion, getting assassinated. This leaves his two subordinates, Silver Lion (Byron Mann) and Bronze Lion (Cung Le), to take his place as leaders of the clan. Gold Lion was a leader who believed in peace while Silver Lion has a lust for war. In an effort to eliminate all traces of Gold Lion, he sends assassins to eliminate Gold Lion's only son, Zen-Yi aka The X-Blade (Rick Yune).After word got out that Gold Lion was assassinated, a mysterious man by the name of Jack Knife (Russell Crowe) arrives at Jungle Village. The viewer doesn't learn who he is or why he's there until the final 30 minutes or so. Until then he's staying at The Pink Blossom, a brothel run by Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu). Jack is probably one of my favorite characters because of his personality. He gives off this very calm, cool, collective vibe that Crowe does a wonderful job of pulling off. He's here for business and he doesn't have time to waste.My main reason for seeing this was RZA. Up until now he's appeared in some small roles here and there, but The Man With The Iron Fist is the first time he's getting the chance to play a major character. RZA plays an unnamed blacksmith who makes weapons for the rival clans. He's not on any specific side, he's just trying to save up enough money so he can leave Jungle Village with Lady Silk (Jamie Chung), his girlfriend and a prostitute at the Pink Blossom. I think the goal was to make this blacksmith the main character, but any effort to pull that off was eliminated when he's absent for majority of the first half.I think that's where I kind of got turned off. I enjoy films that follow a specific character/set of characters throughout the entire film. The Man With The Iron Fists is one of those films that jumps back and forth between multiple people. You have Silver Lion, Jack Knife, Madam Blossom, Brass Body (Dave Batista), and the blacksmith. Because there's so many key characters it's hard to form any sort of connection with any of them. That's not to say that they're all empty shells. On the contrary, I already mentioned my love for Jack, but Madam Blossom proves to be a pretty badass character and Brass Body (cheesy name aside) is interesting as well. The thing is that they only get brief spurts of screen time here and there which makes it hard to really care.My biggest issues, however, were the special effects and the predictability of the story. There's a scene within the first five minutes where a man is being attacked by a pack of wolves against what appears to be a barn door. It's obvious that these ""wolves"" are as fake as they come. In fact, these effects are so bad that when it cuts to this scene the color scheme changes from dark and solid to light and washed out. Then the fake blood used throughout the movie is just awful. There's been movies where the fake blood looks like fake blood, but this didn't even resemble blood at all. Whenever there was a spurt of blood erupting from a mouth, stab wound, etc. it looked like cherry soda. Part of me feels that this was intentional just to add to the cheesiness, but either way it just didn't do it for me.Then there was the story. Don't get me wrong, there were some things that I wasn't expecting, but majority of the time I said ""This is probably going to happen."" and sure enough it did. For example, there was a scene where the Lions stayed at The Pink Blossom and the women were ordered to ""entertain"" them. Right away I said ""Lady Silk is going to get Brass Body"". You wanna know what happened? Brass Body came into her room and wound up beating her to a pulp. I mean I understand that this is normal to include things like this because we've seen it done so many times in the past, but don't you think it's time that someone breaks the cycle?What really drives this film though is the performances from the cast members. It's clear that RZA is still a developing actor so don't expect some breathtaking performance, but considering that this is his first major role he did a solid job. Russell Crowe gave a great performance as Jack which more than makes up for his lackluster effort in Broken City. Rick Yune and Lucy Lui gave great performances as well, as did David Bautista, Byron Mann, and Jamie Chung. A lot of great performances from a pretty well-rounded cast.Overall Score: 6/10 - To be totally honest I expected more from The Man With The Iron Fists. From start to finish it felt really cluttered and directionless and the ending felt sudden and underwhelming. If you're a fan of kung-fu movies and you know what to expect then it would be very easy for me to recommend this to you. For everyone else I would advise you to go in with an open mind. While I personally can't say that I'll ever watch this again, I don't regret taking the time to experience it because when it's all said and done it was a nice ride.",3,6/10 -

1580348,AWAXS66YMHMNW,B0090SI3ZW,"J. Thomason ""Movie Family""","[6, 8]","One man's opinion - Let me start by saying I watch movies... a LOT of movies.  On a given week I can easily view 15-20 movies - being permanently disabled has given me a lot of time on my hands.  Secondly, I LOVE BAD MOVIES... not all bad movies, but generally speaking the cheesier the better.  I love it when a bad movie crosses that invisible line between simply terrible to a new paradigm - what I like to call ""So bad, it's good"".  Need an example, ""Battle Beyond the Stars"" or as I like to call it John Boy in Space!!!  It's terrible, it's wonderfully, joyfully, nay, tearfully terrible.  Watch virtually ANY Christopher Lee horror film from the 60s or 70s.  You probably get the picture so I'll move on.  I bought this supposedly ""Tarantino"" film expecting bad - I wasn't disappointed (in that).It really didn't take very long to realize the only thing Quentin Tarantino had to do with this film was to make money off his name.  The filming of this movie had nothing of his quirkiness or well thought out scenes, none of his witty script-craft, and none of his skill in bringing a film to the silver screen.  What does appear on screen is a movie, poorly shot, poorly acted, poorly scripted, poorly organized, poorly scored.  The ""short of it"" in Texas parlance can be summed up thus - a hot mess, bless their hearts.How could this huge mistake have happened you might ask yourself (I sure did).  When a film goes this far off the ranch you have to start with the basics - who wrote the film - they are ultimately responsible for what's presented.  The film was written by Robert Diggs (East Coast Rapper and Wu-Tang Clan leader) and Eli Roth (of 'Hostel' and 'Hostel:Part 2' fame (ya, I missed those two too)).  The film was directed by Diggs... and stars Diggs as well (or as he self-styled RZA - a moniker which in this movie's case should stand for Razzle (Dazzle) since the film has so little substance and so much flash).  Mr. Razzle Dazzle also was responsible for the soundtrack (I know, big surprise there too).  RZA was clearly over his head in every way imaginable, the writing is sluggish and uninspired, the directing is amateurish, the soundtrack commits the ultimate sin - its so poorly married to what's happening on screen it pulls you out of the movie, and the acting was flat.  I can almost forgive RZA for his performance and ever-present hip-hop / hood-inspired language (what direction is 'Norf' anyway?  That's right, I'm 'axing' you), but the deplorable job done by both once A-List stars Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu leaves much to the imagination (and what you fill in for their apparent lack of enthusiasm wasn't good).  Crowe would seem to be going the way of Marlon Brando (all the girth and half the talent) and Liu's performance is a text book example of how she has gone from Lucy Liu to Lucy Who?  If I could give the film no stars I would.  It's not worth the cardboard it came wrapped in.  I hope Tarantino enjoyed the cash given to borrow his name and I sincerely hope he actually reads the next script before cashing the check - in this business we call show, reputation is everything and this was most certainly NOT a Tarantino film.  One or two of these and his fan base will take a walk (I hope your listening Mr. Tarantino, I'm still a fan... for now).  In summary - Hot Mess, RZA=Razzle Dazzle, Lucy Who? and DON'T BUY THIS FILM, DON'T EVEN RENT IT - just walk away... run if you're able.Bad movie, BAD movie - BAD MOVIE.

1580361,ADY1E4CAPP1W1,B0090SI3ZW,LopsidedMidget,"[0, 0]","This is a movie that will have a niche following and will have everyone else sitting there wondering what they just saw. The Man With The Iron Fists is entertaining. That's about the best that I can say about it.Plot: Seriously disjointed. At an attempt to make the plot surprising and intriguing RZA overextended himself and created a ton of scenes that do not flow together at all. You can leave this film and come back 15 minutes later only to have the same ""what happened"" experience that everyone that sat through the entire movie will have.Acting: This is probably one of the strong points in the film. Lucy Liu and Russell Crowe are both entertaining, even if Crowe is larger than life and his character is one of the awkward points in the story. RZA isn't terrible at acting in this film, but he seems like he doesn't fit well into his character's skin and it was very evident. He seems to have a half asleep expression throughout the film that's distracting and actually takes a lot away from his character.Style and Visual Effects: You'll know 5 minutes into this film if this is something that you are interested in. The ""kung fu"" is exaggerated and about as far as you can get from what it would look like/be possible in real life - many punches never connect and many enemies go flying due to said punches. It is similar to kung fu hustle/warrior's way style, but taken another step in the direction of unbelievable.Music: This was actually a strong point in this film. If nothing else if you know RZA's style and you enjoy the music then you'll like this soundtrack.Overall: Entertaining, but I wouldn't watch it again. I feel like there was a lot of potential and talent in this film that wasn't tapped. RZA needs a more simple (it could have been very simple) story line to direct. He attempted to create a film that would surprise and awe the audience. Instead, he created a film that baffled and confused most viewers. Without making a lot of your own judgements on things (not always bad if the plot is explained well) the plot will make no sense at all.

1580368,A3QTB346UKG6TV,B0090SI3ZW,Mantis,"[2, 2]","Man, where to begin?  Firstly, I am a life-long fan of martial arts films.  Everything from Kurosawa's 1943 (Judo vs Jujitsu) classic ""Sanshiro Sugata"", to the modern gore & brutality of 2011's ""The Raid"", and just about everything in between.  I fell in love with film fighting during the '80s, when I was allowed to stay up late to watch ""Kung Fu Theater"", featuring traditional Chinese fighting styles and costumes.  My discovery was probably not too long after the film's 1st time writer/director, RZA, began his own obsession with this particular brand of escapism.  When I first heard that RZA was writing and directing a kung fu movie, I could barely contain my excitement.  A while later, when I finally saw the first trailer for it, I could hardly contain my contempt.  It looked awful.  After unfavorable reviews started pouring in, I thought it best to cut my losses and avoid seeing it at all.  Many months passed until just last week, when it was available for checkout from my local library.  A trusted source's recent reserved recommendation sealed the deal.  I lowered my expectations and had a go.  I gotta say, there was some pretty cool stuff going on here.  Was it still disappointing?  Yes, but if I came away with anything, it's a sincere hope that RZA continues in this profession.  My man leapt right into the 35th Chamber of filmmaking, and while not graduating, I think he showed the monks he means business.In Jungle Village (kind of a late-1800s, Chinese version of Mos Eisley from ""Star Wars""), powerful clans converge to steal a large portion of gold that will be escorted through town via the governor's order.  Knowing of the cutthroats that reside there, the governor has requested the extra security of the Lion clan.  The clan's leader, Gold Lion (Chen Kwan Tai, ""Dragon Tiger Gate"") agrees until his lieutenants, Silver (Byron Mann, ""Belly of the Beast"") & Bronze (Cung Le, ""Dragon Eyes"") betray and murder him.  Seems they want the gold for themselves.  Not taking the other clans too seriously, it seems the only real threat to their plan is Gold's son, Zen Yi, aka the X-Blade (Rick Yune, ""Ninja Assassin""), and eventually Thaddeus (RZA, ""Coffee & Cigarettes""), the town's blacksmith, whose business is booming with weapon requests for the impending rumble.  There are many other characters, including Russell Crowe  (""L.A. Confidential"") as the Englishman, Jack Knife, and Lucy Liu (""Kill Bill"") as the owner of the local brothel that EVERYONE frequents.I refuse to call out RZA for plagiarism because these types of films borrowed from one another quite liberally and I recognized most of his source material.  The majority of this picture was borrowed from ""The Kid With The Golden Arm"" (1979), ""Flag of Iron"" (aka ""Spearman"", 1980), and ""Crippled Avengers"" (1978): movies starring the group of 6 actors known as the Venom mob (from their most popular film together, ""5 Deadly Venoms""), who worked for the Shaw Brothers studio in the mid-to-late '70s, specifically for the late director Chang Cheh (""One Armed Swordsman"").  Elements are also borrowed from other Shaw flicks, like ""Cave of the Silken Web"" (1967) and ""The 36th Chamber of Shaolin"" (1978).The fight scenes?  It saddens me to report that, well, frankly, they suck.  The bullseye (or at least its periphery) of RZA's target audience is more-or-less me and had the kung fu been good I would've been absolutely enamored with this film.  Dreadful use of wires, editing, CGI gore, and slow motion totally sink the action.  RZA and co-writer Eli Roth (""Hostel"") developed original weapons for the film and they're pretty sweet.  If only they had figured out a way to shoot the scenes where these items were utilized.  Rick Yune, Cung Le, and WWE/MMA fighter Dave Bautista (as Brass Body) are really the only ones that get to show off any good moves but they're still disappointing due to poor handling.The Universal DVD contains both R-rated and Unrated versions, coming in at 96 & 108 minutes, respectively.  The image is colorful and splendid with a nice 2.40:1 widescreen picture.  Spoken languages are available in English, Spanish, and French, with subtitles in English or French.  Special features include: deleted scenes, ""A Look Inside..."", ""Path To The East"", and ""On The Set With RZA"".  I really can't recommend this as a martial arts film but I can as a slice of kung fu nostalgia for old-school fans.  The casting was excellent and the acting, story, score, and direction were actually much better than I expected.  Sets & costumes were well done, too.  Really, everything but the action, which is kind of a big deal for this genre.2012",3,"old-school sensibility, contemporary shortcomings.",1374451200,"07 22, 2013",2013,4647,"['Man', 'where', 'begin',

Mccullough ""Argento Fan""","[0, 0]","Iron Fists' bloody and hyper real opening title sequence is perhaps the best evidence of what RZA had in mind when he started developing his love letter to East Asian cinema, and there's no denying the film's clever use of wirework and sublime imagery to sell that notion. The production's use of authentic Chinese locations also offers a sense of visual grandeur.Where Iron Fists falls apart is in its contrived mythology. While it's obvious that RZA and co-writer Eli Roth spent a lot of time developing this complex universe filled withwarring clans, mystic ideologies and thorough backstories, none of those ever become fully realized over the course of the movie, even with the Unrated Edition's extended runtime. Instead of a restrained, balanced narrative, the director spends more time cramming in as many tributes to past works as he can, without establishing his own unique style. As a result, Iron Fists becomes less of a modern spin on a classic genre and more of a muddy, bombastic tribute video.That's not to say the film isn't without SOME  entertainment value.

1580375,A2WCRX5OQM6FED,B0090SI3ZW,"Mike Sehorn ""The Phantom Projectionist""","[1, 2]","As the first mainstream American kung fu movie to be produced in about ten years, I promised myself to see it. I wasn't sure what to make of its first-time director, but by and large I was excited for it. However, I ended up not getting to see the picture until recently, and by then, some trepidation had built up for me, based on the lukewarm reviews I had come across. I'm glad for them, because this would have been a pretty big letdown otherwise. ""The Man with the Iron Fists"" is an entertaining action flick and certainly not bad, but stylistic choices by the filmmakers hinder what could have been a very good adventure and dilute it to mere little more than a visually interesting time-killer.The story: an assortment of warriors, assassins, and various deadly individuals - all in pursuit of treasure - descend on a small town overseen by a unique blacksmith (director and rap star Robert ""RZA"" Diggs)...Director and leading man RZA is a hardcore fan of traditional kung fu flicks, and producer-in-spirit Quentin Tarantino is big on retro repackages. They have fine ideologies, but I'm fairly certain that the movie could have been made without being so ridiculously hokey. The cheesy opening titles, the recycled Shaw Bros. sound effects, the cartoon gore, and a good deal of the dialogue are constant reminders that the filmmakers didn't take their product very seriously, and I'm a bit resentful for it. Not only does this seem to act as a waiver for any technical shortcomings (see the unrated version, mainly), but all of this had already been done better a decade ago with Tarantino's ownKill Bill. Guys, it's *okay* to fill a movie full of cool things; you don't have to account or apologize for it with comedy.And there certainly is a good deal of cool things to be found here. Artistically, the movie is a success, with great sets and unique costumes. Many of the special weapons I had never seen before. The storyline is juicy, and it moves at a swift comic book pace that I find appealing. And the casting is, for the most part, full of winners. Rick Yune (Ninja Assassin) as a main hero, Lucy Liu as the deadly madam of a brothel, and ex-WWE star Dave Bautista as a monstrous enforcer - good. Byron Mann (Street Fighter) as the lead villain, Kwan Tai-Chen (The 5 Deadly Venoms) as his ill-fated father, and MMA champ Cung Le as the former's main henchman - very good. David Wu (Legend of the Black Scorpion) as a creepy assassin and the singular Gordon Liu as the teacher of RZA's character - fantastic. RZA himself gives a much better performance than expected. I have no idea what Kurt Russell is doing in this movie, but in the end, his performance as the horny gunslinger is endearing.Of course, the best action cast in the world is only as good as its action scenes, and disappointingly, I think these fights could have been better. They could have been a lot worse, of course, but considering the amount of talent involved and that they're wrangled by Corey Yuen - one of my favorite action coordinators - they definitely fall short of their potential. There isn't a single fight scene that I can point to as an example of a great cinematic brawl. Part of this is due to the style in which they're choreographed; I'm not a huge fan of wire-fu. Nevertheless, the wirework shows some ingenuity (e.g. the Gemini fight), and in the end, the biggest drawbacks of the brawls are that too few of them feature any amount of satisfying back & forth action and that too many of them feature an overabundance of slow motion and CGI enhancements. These are clearly supposed to be Hong Kong-styled fights, but come off more as Americanized Hong Kong knockoffs.With that said, there are several good (not great) fights, among them the showdown between RZA and Bautista's characters, which is better than it has any right to be in my opinion. I think that's the best way to approach this movie - with low expectations, so that you're pleasantly surprised at the highlights and not too disappointed by the shortcomings. For his junior outing as both an actor and a director, RZA does a good job, but I think he was held back by both the ambitiousness of this project and the influence of the folks who were supporting him (read: writer-producer Eli Roth). I'd be interested in watching the sequel that's set up during the credits, but that one will have a lot it needs to build on if it's going to be better than this.",3,"""That must be very good opium""",1371859200,"06 22, 2013",2013,4429,"['first', 'mainstream', 'American', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'be', 'produced', 'about', 'ten', 'years', 'promised', 'see', 'was', ""n't"", 'sure', 'what', 'make', 'first-time', 'director', 'large', 'was', 'excited', 'However', 'ended', 'up', 'not', 'getting', 'see', 'picture', 'recently', 'then', 'trepidation', 'had', 'built', 'up', 'based', 'lukewarm', 'reviews', 'had', 'come', ""'m"", 'glad', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'pretty', 'big', 'letdown', 'otherwise', 'Man', 'Iron', 'Fists', 'entertaining', 'action', 'flick', 'certainly', 'not', 'bad', 'stylistic', 'choices', 'filmmakers', 'hinder', 'what', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'very', 'good', 'adventure', 'dilute', 'mere', 'little', 'more', 'visually', 'interesting', 'time-killer.The', 'story', 'assortment', 'warriors', 'assassins', 'various', 'deadly', 'individuals', 'pursuit', 'treasure', 'descend', 'small', 'town', 'overseen', 'unique', 'blacksmith', 'director', 'rap', 'star', 'Robert', 'RZA', 'Diggs', 'Director', 'leading', 'man', 'RZA', 'hardcore', 'fan', 'traditional', 'kung', 'fu', 'flicks', 'producer-in-spirit', 'Quentin', 'Tarantino', 'big', 'retro', 'repackages', 'have', 'fine', 'ideologies', ""'m"", 'fairly', 'certain', 'movie', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'made', 'being', 'so', 'ridiculously', 'hokey', 'cheesy', 'opening', 'titles', 'recycled', 'Shaw', 'Bros.', 'sound', 'effects', 'cartoon', 'gore', 'good', 'deal', 'dialogue', 'are', 'constant', 'reminders', 'filmmakers', 'did', ""n't"", 'take', 'product', 'very', 'seriously', ""'m"", 'bit', 'resentful', 'Not', 'only', 'seem', 'act', 'waiver', 'technical', 'shortcomings', 'see', 'unrated', 'version', 'mainly', 'had', 'already', 'been', 'done', 'better', 'decade', 'Tarantino', 'ownKill', 'Bill', 'Guys', '*okay*', 'fill', 'movie', 'full', 'cool', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'account', 'apologize', 'comedy.And', 'certainly', 'good', 'deal', 'cool', 'things', 'be', 'found', 'here', 'Artistically', 'movie', 'success', 'great', 'sets', 'unique', 'costumes', 'Many', 'special', 'weapons', 'had', 'never', 'seen', 'before', 'storyline', 'juicy', 'swift', 'comic', 'book', 'pace', 'find', 'appealing', 'casting', 'most', 'part', 'full', 'winners', 'Rick', 'Yune', 'Ninja', 'Assassin', 'main', 'hero', 'Lucy', 'Liu', 'deadly', 'madam', 'brothel', 'ex-WWE', 'star', 'Dave', 'Bautista', 'monstrous', 'enforcer', 'good', 'Byron', 'Mann', 'Street', 'Fighter', 'lead', 'villain', 'Kwan', 'Tai-Chen', '5', 'Deadly', 'Venoms', 'ill-fated', 'father', 'MMA', 'champ', 'Cung', 'Le', 'former', 'main', 'henchman', 'very', 'good', 'David', 'Wu', 'Legend', 'Black', 'Scorpion', 'creepy', 'assassin', 'singular', 'Gordon', 'Liu', 'teacher', 'RZA', 'character', 'fantastic', 'RZA', 'much', 'better', 'performance', 'expected', 'have', 'idea', 'what', 'Kurt', 'Russell', 'doing', 'movie', 'end', 'performance', 'horny', 'gunslinger', 'endearing.Of', 'course', 'best', 'action', 'cast', 'world', 'only', 'as', 'good', 'action', 'scenes', 'disappointingly', 'think', 'fights', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'better', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'lot', 'worse', 'course', 'considering', 'amount', 'talent', 'involved', ""'re"", 'wrangled', 'Corey', 'Yuen', 'one', 'favorite', 'action', 'coordinators', 'definitely', 'fall', 'short', 'potential', ""n't"", 'single', 'fight', 'scene', 'can', 'point', 'example', 'great', 'cinematic', 'brawl', 'Part', 'due', 'style', ""'re"", 'choreographed', ""'m"", 'not', 'huge', 'fan', 'wire-fu', 'Nevertheless', 'wirework', 'ingenuity', 'e.g', 'Gemini', 'fight', 'end', 'biggest', 'drawbacks', 'brawls', 'are', 'too', 'few', 'feature', 'amount', 'satisfying', 'back', 'forth', 'action', 'too', 'many', 'feature', 'overabundance', 'slow', 'motion', 'CGI', 'enhancements', 'are', 'clearly', 'supposed', 'be', 'Hong', 'Kong-styled', 'fights', 'come', 'off', 'more', 'Americanized', 'Hong', 'Kong', 'knockoffs.With', 'said', 'are', 'several', 'good', 'not', 'great', 'fights', 'showdown', 'RZA', 'Bautista', 'characters', 'better', 'right', 'be', 'opinion', 'think', 'best', 'way', 'approach', 'movie', 'low', 'expectations', ""'re"", 'pleasantly', 'surprised', 'highlights', 'not', 'too', 'disappointed', 'shortcomings', 'junior', 'outing', 'actor', 'director', 'RZA', 'good', 'job', 'think', 'was', 'held', 'back', 'ambitiousness', 'project', 'influence', 'folks', 'who', 'were', 'supporting', 'read', 'writer-producer', 'Eli', 'Roth', ""'d"", 'be', 'interested', 'watching', 'sequel', 'set', 'up', 'credits', 'one', 'will', 'have', 'lot', 'build', 'going', 'be', 'better']",N/A

When I saw the trailer for Man With The Iron Fists it looked like a movie tailor made for me. Boy was I wrong.I watched the first half of the movie before growing bored and wandering out of theater. During the many hours I spent watching the first half - or at least it seemed that long - I saw absolutely nothing to indicate that any actor or stunt-man appearing in the movie had ever had a martial arts lesson. Seriously, the fight choreography looked like what a bunch of school boys, with absolutely no martial arts background, might put together trying to copy what they saw in Kung fu Theater. Maybe there was some martial arts in the 2nd half of the movie, I didn't make it that far. I later learned that there were a couple real martial artists in this movie. Based on what I saw on the screen, I never would have figured that out.What Iron Fist did have, in abundance, was lots and lots of bright red fluid. I couldn't begin to tell you how many limbs were severed in the first 15 minutes. There was one scene where one ""martial artist"" rips the arms off another ""martial artist"" using something that was possibly some kind of tiger style. There was a guy in a suit full of switchblades that does a lot of jumping and spinning and severing of arteries. There's also Russell Crowe who seems to know even less about fighting than the uncoordinated ""martial artists."" But he has a pair of scissors with a pistol grip that he uses to disembowel his clumsy opponents.The sets and cinematography were first rate, impressive but not impressive enough to make up for the terrible writing, directing and fight choreography. The costumes looked like a lot of thought and a lot of money had gone into them. Iron Fist had a $20 million budget, and was shot in China where that kind of money will go pretty far. It's a shame that RZA didn't spring for a first rate choreographer. But it's also a shame that the movie wasn't better written and directed. The real shame of it is that all the ingredient to make a good kung fu movie were in place, the only thing missing was a recipe and someone who knew how to mix them.If you're a fan of simulated blood, simulated amputations and simulated disembowelments - and couldn't care less if anyone on the screen could actually kick their way out of a paper bag - this is the movie for you. If you want to see some actual martial artists with real skill and real choreography, get yourself some Shaw Brothers kung fu DVDs and skip watching this steaming pile.",1,A steaming pile that's all gore factor and no kung fu,1357689600,"01 9, 2013",2013,2544,"[""'m"", 'huge', 'fan', 'old', 'time', 'kung', 'fu', 'movies', 'When', 'saw', 'trailer', 'Man', 'Iron', 'looked', 'movie', 'tailor', 'made', 'Boy', 'was', 'wrong.I', 'watched', 'first', 'half', 'movie', 'growing', 'bored', 'wandering', 'theater', 'many', 'hours', 'spent', 'watching', 'first', 'half', 'least', 'seemed', 'long', 'saw', 'absolutely', 'nothing', 'indicate', 'actor', 'stunt-man', 'appearing', 'movie', 'had', 'ever', 'had', 'martial', 'arts', 'lesson', 'Seriously', 'fight', 'choreography', 'looked', 'what', 'bunch', 'school', 'boys', 'absolutely', 'martial', 'arts', 'background', 'might', 'put', 'together', 'trying', 'copy', 'what', 'saw', 'Kung', 'fu', 'Theater', 'Maybe', 'was', 'martial', 'arts', '2nd', 'half', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'make', 'far', 'later', 'learned', 'were', 'couple', 'real', 'martial', 'artists', 'movie', 'Based', 'what', 'saw', 'screen', 'never', 'would', 'have', 'figured', 'out.What', 'Iron', 'Fist', 'did', 'have', 'abundance', 'was', 'lots', 'lots', 'bright', 'red', 'fluid', 'could', ""n't"", 'begin', 'tell', 'how', 'many', 'limbs', 'were', 'severed', 'first', '15', 'minutes', 'was', 'one', 'scene', 'where', 'one', 'martial', 'artist', 'arms', 'martial', 'artist', 'using', 'something', 'was', 'possibly', 'kind', 'tiger', 'style', 'was', 'guy', 'suit', 'full', 'switchblades', 'lot', 'jumping', 'spinning', 'severing', 'arteries', 'also', 'Russell', 'Crowe', 'who', 'know', 'even', 'less', 'fighting', 'uncoordinated', 'martial', 'artists', 'pair', 'scissors', 'pistol', 'grip', 'disembowel', 'clumsy', 'opponents.The', 'sets', 'cinematography', 'were', 'first', 'rate', 'impressive', 'not', 'impressive', 'enough', 'make', 'up', 'terrible', 'writing', 'directing', 'fight', 'choreography', 'costumes', 'looked', 'lot', 'thought', 'lot', 'money', 'had', 'gone', 'Iron', 'Fist', 'had', '20', 'million', 'budget', 'was', 'shot', 'China', 'where', 'kind', 'money', 'will', 'go', 'pretty', 'far', 'shame', 'RZA', 'did', ""n't"", 'spring', 'first', 'rate', 'choreographer', 'also', 'shame', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'better', 'written', 'directed', 'real', 'shame', 'ingredient', 'make', 'good', 'kung', 'fu', 'movie', 'were', 'place', 'only', 'thing', 'missing', 'was', 'recipe', 'someone', 'who', 'knew', 'how', 'mix', 'them.If', ""'re"", 'fan', 'simulated', 'blood', 'simulated', 'amputations', 'simulated', 'disembowelments', 'could', ""n't"", 'care', 'less', 'anyone', 'screen', 'could', 'actually', 'kick', 'way', 'paper', 'bag', 'movie', 'want', 'see', 'actual', 'martial', 'artists', 'real', 'skill', 'real', 'choreography', 'get', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'kung', 'fu', 'DVDs', 'skip', 'watching', 'steaming', 'pile']",N/A

RZA plays an under-the-radar metal smith in a Chinese province circa 1870.  He had escaped slavery with the help of his mother (Pam Grier) and hopped on a boat for China.  It sunk with everyone on board drowned but for Blacksmith as he is known.His main job is to fabricate the unusual armament for the local thugs.  In a thin plot, a shipment of gold is being transported to the governor over land, protected by a top notch group of guardians.  Also interested in the gold is a mysterious caucasian named Jack Knife (a portly Russell Crowe) and the owner of the high end brothel, Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu).  Rick Yune plays one of the good guys known as The X-Blade because of his ability to fling various sharp instruments at his adversaries.  He's headed to the village as well to avenge his father's death at the hand of the aforementioned thugs.Numerous battles take place always involving magical feats of jumping and suspension in midair.  Some of the weapons are admittedly pretty cool, but much of the action sequences are nothing special in this day and age of photo trickery.

Clark""","[4, 5]","Having watched several of the Shaw Brothers classics during my day, I can definitely see where Rza got his inspiration for this movie. The only problem is, he created a bad Kung Fu fantasy instead of putting out a memorable film. As many people have already described this film in detail, I'm not going to go into the plot. But suffice to say, Rap music doesn't belong in a 19th century period piece. It just doesn't. Rza would have been better off getting the film properly scored instead of creating a Rap soundtrack for the background music. It was very distracting.Second, Rza choosing to have an African American character in the film, working as a blacksmith, might have worked. The only problem is, he chose to play the role himself. I have to agree with what others have already stated. Rza is not a very good actor in general. Add to that his street flare as he delivers his lines, and you have a mismatch character who doesn't really belong in the story. As a result, It was difficult to buy into his role. Had he picked a seasoned actor instead, it might have worked out. But as is, this film was likely a life long dream of his, so I guess he had to fit himself in somewhere. In retrospect, it was a mistake.I commend him, however, for tapping into the Asian American acting pool for his lead roles. Lucy Lui did well enough, as did Ricky Yune. Jamie Chung also appears in the film as Rza's love interest, but she doesn't really get enough screen time to leave her mark. It seemed like she was mainly there to give Rza's character a connection to the film. Russell Crowe also  appears  and his acting is always good. But in this case,  he seemed out of place. His character was odd and seemed to be written in just to have an excuse for more star power on the screen. At least, that's the way it seemed to me.The martial arts were OK, but they don't hold a flame to the HK classics from the 70's and 80's. My advice is, if you want a good Kung Fu flick, just go to the source. Either check out some Shaw Brother's films or look for some filmed  by Golden Harvest Pictures. They have real Kung Fu stories that work while showcasing excellent Kung Fu. Rza's  version is more of a Kung Fu parody that pays homage to the genre, but doesn't really hit the mark.In the end I gave the film 2 stars. Rza did manage to insert some of the  ideas you expect in a Kung Fu flick. He also enlisted the aide of  Asian American actors, so he gets another star for that. But overall, this is not a great film. It's just too far out of the norm to be a good Kung Fu flick. All you're left with while watching this film is a lingering hope that it might improve.

Knife,Lucy Liu as Madam Blossom,David Bautista as Brass Body,Jamie Chung as Lady Silk,Cung Le as Bronze Lion,and Byron Mann as Silver Lion.This film is a throwback to the 60s and 70s Hong Kong films that have inspired many producers,directors and actors over the years.Those films were originally for the most part fantasies,some serious others not.Some could even be considered Chinese westerns.They made big stars out of many of the actors in their home countries.What we in North America saw was oft times poor,faded prints with horrible dubbings into English.They became a joke and the plots,to us,were mostly forgettable.They have been lampooned consistently over the years since.This film plays it all very straight but uses the same style as those old Hong Kong pictures.Unfortunately the story is as lame as any of the poorest Hong Kong films and drags interminably to the end.The story finds the setting in China,in a time of feuding clans.The emperor has a shipment of gold traveling across the country and the head of the lion clan intends to protect it for him.However two of his underlings kill him and take over,and they scheme to steal the gold.Thrown into this mix is the son of the slain leader,X Blade,Jack Knife a mercenary British soldier who,with X Blade,converge on Jungle Town and meet up with a black,blacksmith,whose specialty is forging weapons of the finest calibre.Since the lion clan is no longer in the picture the governor sends the Gemini squad to protect the gold.They arrive in the town with it and hunker down in the hotel/brothel run by Madam Blossom.The lion clan kill the Gemini`s and commandeer the gold.They also sever the blacksmiths arms,who ends up forging iron fists onto his stumps.He teams with Jack Knife and X Blade to try and take down the lion clan.The clan makes a deal with the madam,who has the gold in storage beneath the brothel.She knows its a promise they will never keep so she strikes back first by killing almost all of its members the night before they are to leave.Arriving outside the city a platoon of well armed soldiers sent by the Emperor enters the town and are paused outside the brothel and ready to level it if the gold is not forthcoming.The three fight and defeat their enemies and Jack Knife,in the nick of time,appears to stop the soldiers from firing.The film ends as all three go their separate ways.In an epilogue X Blade`s wife is kidnapped by members of a bird clan and he must rescue her.He returns to the blacksmith for help.As in the old Hong Kong films the fights usually don`t take much time to break out and this film is no different.It also uses those,now,cheesy stunts and close ups of faces distorted in rage to propel things along,like the old Hong Kong-ers(the memories just come flooding back!).When the fights resume in earnest near the end of the film at the climax,they now use a more modern style to stage them,with quick camera movement,action freezing and the like.In between we have this long and drawn out plot as each character and group are introduced.We even get back stories on some of the characters.One such borefest is the backdrop to the blacksmith`s story.As if things weren`t going slowly enough,they had to insert that story to slow things almost to a halt.If this film had been sending the entire Hong Kong genre up,or was doing it in a visually stylistic interpretation ala Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon,this film may have stood some chance of being half decent.As it is,to actually have the nerve to play this thing ``straight``,is to commit filmic suicide.Sorry Mr.Diggs,this is bad.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include deleted scenes and some featurettes.This disc also contains the theatrical AND the extended versions.All in all a film that falls totally flat and into its Hong Kong rice bowl.If you,like I,were expecting a bit of imaginative tricks and style ala Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon,then think again.Just because it has Tarantino`s name attached,doesn`t mean it is on Tarantino`s level.",2,This is a flat

The audio options include English 5.1, Spanish 5.1, and French 5.1. There are English, Spanish and French subtitles. It would have been cool if there was Cantonese and/or Mandarin audio to really give it that old school kung fu feel.The dvd gives us the theatrical 96 minute version of the film and an unrated extended version that runs 108 minutes. I'm glad Universal presented these on one dvd and didn't first release the theatrical and 6 months later release the unrated like so many studios do.Extras include 5 deleted scenes that total 24 minutes. There are also 3 fluff featurettes: 'on set with RZA' (5 minutes), look inside mwtif (2 minutes), and path to the east (2 minutes). I would like to have seen a commentary track with RZA and Eli Roth. Better yet a 3-way commentary featuring RZA, Eli Roth, and Tarantino. QT's commentaries and always entertaining and informative.The end of the movie teased a sequel that looks like it would be really out there. I'm really hoping that the films flat box office performance (it made just a little over the $20 million it cost to make) doesn't prevent the sequel from getting made.",4,Anyone remember watching Black Belt Theatre on Saturday afternoons?,1397692800,"04 17, 2014",2014,1651,"['Anyone', 'remember', 'watching', 'Black', 'Belt', 'Theatre', 'Saturday', 'afternoons', 'movie', 'off', 'same', 'old', 'school', 'kung', 'fu', 'vibe', 'classic', '70', 'Shaw', 'Brothers', 'classics', 'colorful', 'costumed', 'larger', 'life', 'characters', 'crazy', 'weapons', 'top', 'fighting', 'remind', 'something', 'would', 'see', 'Venoms', 'movie', 'really', 'surprise', 'considering', 'RZA', 'love', 'movies', 'wonderful', 'homage', 'classics.The', 'movie', 'presented', '2:40', 'anamorphic', 'widescreen', 'excellent', 'colorful', 'transfer', 'audio', 'options', 'include', 'English', '5.1', 'Spanish', '5.1', 'French', '5.1', 'are', 'English', 'Spanish', 'French', 'subtitles', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'cool', 'was', 'Cantonese', 'and/or', 'Mandarin', 'audio', 'really', 'give', 'old', 'school', 'kung', 'fu', 'feel.The', 'dvd', 'theatrical', '96', 'minute', 'version', 'film', 'unrated', 'extended', 'version', '108', 'minutes', ""'m"", 'glad', 'Universal', 'presented', 'one', 'dvd', 'did', ""n't"", 'first', 'release', 'theatrical', '6', 'months', 'later', 'release', 'unrated', 'so', 'many', 'studios', 'do.Extras', 'include', '5', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'total', '24', 'minutes', 'are', 'also', '3', 'fluff', 'featurettes', ""'on"", 'set', 'RZA', '5', 'minutes', 'look', 'mwtif', '2', 'minutes', 'path', 'east', '2', 'minutes', 'would', 'like', 'have', 'seen', 'commentary', 'track', 'RZA', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'Better', 'yet', '3-way', 'commentary', 'featuring', 'RZA', 'Eli', 'Roth', 'Tarantino', 'QT', 'commentaries', 'always', 'entertaining', 'informative.The', 'end', 'movie', 'teased', 'sequel', 'would', 'be', 'really', 'there', ""'m"", 'really', 'hoping', 'films', 'flat', 'box', 'office', 'performance', 'made', 'just', 'little', '20', 'million', 'cost', 'make', ""n't"", 'prevent', 'sequel', 'getting', 'made']",N/A

1580438,A1DUT6O3BWXEJ,B0090SI3ZW,"Shawn Gordon ""gordy the ghoul""","[0, 1]","When a movie is ""presented by"" Quentin Tarantino, written by the RZA and Eli Roth and stars Russell Crowe and Lucy Liu you have a right to at least expect it to resemble a professionally made film. The new would-be Wuxia epic the Man With the Iron Fists is like an amateur production ,a bastardized cross between a Shaw Brothers martial arts adventure and a feature length movie trailer. Full of hype and missed potential, this is no better than any random cheaply made direct-to-DVD movie without big names. In this case so much talent, equals so much waste.First time director RZA is a well known fan of classic martial arts films, his rap group the Wu Tang Clan used a great deal of wuxia imagery in their music, starting with their name. If RZA does in fact love the genre, this is a bad representation of that, treating the wuxia genre as little more than a joke, one that`s not funny either. In a post Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon-era, the desire to apologize for martial arts movies would seem to no longer be a needed defense.Wuxia, the current cool in thing for westerners to call the martial arts genre, in Chinese it means heroic or chivalrias martial arts stories.  Wuxia pictures have been around nearly as long as movies themselves, but only recently have they ascended to there rightful place in Western film culture. The genre is now excepted, with critically studies that have allowed the once ghettoized genre a well deserved appreciated,These movies share much in common with the American western, easterns if you will, and like the western many of the best folk tales told in their culture have unfold on film within this noble genre. It is also worth noting that a lot of these movies are nearly as good as the classic American westerns, especially the HK Shaw Brothers titles of the 60's and 70's and directors  such as Cheng Cheh, King Hu and Li Chuai Ling are comparable to the likes of Sam Peckinpah, John Sturges or Anthony Mann, Now we add this movie to the association, one that is not only an embarrassment, but an insult, the Man With the Iron Fists takes the accomplished merits back several decades.The script is ludicrous, jumbled, disoriented and rambling. Eli Roth came on board to help RZA form and finish his screenplay, I can't imagine he did a lot of  the finished work, while not a tremendous writer. Roth's work usually is far more creditable than this.The dialogue in the Man With the Iron Fist is excruciating, spoken with corny sincerity. This no doubt is meant to be ""homage"" to the old English dubbed kung fu epics of the past, now does that not sound like a mistake. It just doesn't work when the lips match up with these unspeakable lines of discourse.Russell Crowe adds class and credibility, which are otherwise sorely lacking. Crowe has top billing, but plays a rather thankless supporting role, but offers an occasional distraction from the rest of the frivolities. Crowe also has never looked so out of shape, with his full beard and middle age spreading he's starting to resemble Orson Welles. Just why did Crowe do this film, it's mind-boggling to think of such a talented actor and huge movie star wasting his offerings on this.Lucy Liu is likeably enthusiastic, but the role is under developed and she's left floundering. Part of the reason for this is that the whole movie is terribly misogynistic, the woman are all whores and are either treacherous or just merrily in the way, one character is both. Liu's presence will also no doubt make viewers recall the far superior Kill Bill.The rest of the cast is a liability, ""WWE superstar"" Dave Bautista once again shows he has no acting skills what so ever. UFC champ Cung Le is still failing at his attempts to be a movie star. Rick Yune and Jamie Chung have to little screen time to make much impact as token Asian heroes. Pam Grier, Gordon Liu and Chen Kuan-tai show up in pointless cameos that just remind you of better movies you could be watching. As an actor RZA is better than he is a director, but not noticeably so. Playing the film's title character and narrator, like his direction, RZA speaks a lot, but says little.Is it too much to ask for the Man With the Iron Fists  to at the very least be a fun guilty pleasure, but no such luck. The movie lacks any sort of post Tarantino-style of self aware humor, or any intentional humor at all. The film is too brutally gory for it's own good , it is also unnecessarily profane, which does not keep with the genre's traditions, but seems designed to appeal to the hip-hop crowd. It is all so predicable, terribly derivative and worst of all boring. It is a long ninety-six minutes when a martial arts movie lacks even the credibility of a Kung Fu Panda flick.Cheaply made and very much looking it, I have to seriously wonder if RZA's intentions were not to make a bad movie. If so, he has succeeded beyond his wildest dreams. This is not like Tarantino and Rodriguez's Grindhouse, which had a lot of fun making bad movies better. The Man With the Iron Fists manages to make good movies appear bad.In theory this movie should have rocked, but it does anything but. RZA proves to be a lousy writer, a half assed actor and worst no filmmaker. RZA allegedly spent some seven years trying to get this made and the original run time is said to have been four hours long, I do have to ponder if it was any more coherent, but glad I don`t have to find out.  .RZA does fill the movie with an effective audible soundtrack, from hip-hop numbers to Cantonese pop tunes, not to mention a nicely rousing score. The movie looks good, it's visually striking with clever editing and good photography, but lousy action sequences in a dull and unpleasant turkey. The tagline is that this puts the f.u. in kung fu, that's not clever, that's just being honest.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com",1,puts the f.u. in kung fu alright,1362441600,"03 5,

His plan is to leave the area with his prostitute girlfriend Lady Silk (Jamie Chung) to whom he gives his money to put away for when they escape. There are two villages/ clans that are in battle with each other, the Lions and the Wolves who come complete with their own puns. The emperor asks the head of the Lions, Gold Lion (Kuan Tai Chen) to take a shipment of gold to a northern village as some sort of peace offering (plot isn't important in this film). He is betrayed and killed by his two deputies, Silver and Bronze Lion. I think you see where this naming thing is going...move over James Bond.Zen Yi, The X-Blade (Rick Yune) decides to avenge his father's death while Silver Lion has declared war on the Wolf Clan and the Geminis escort the gold. To add to the confusion, Silver Lion has hired the impenetrable Brass Body (Dave Bautista) to hunt Zen Yi while Jack Knife (Russell Crowe) a British killer fortune seeker hangs out at the very colorful brothel called the Pink Blossom run by Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu).This film includes a modern hip-hop sound track complete with MF and N words. The martial arts fighting ignores the laws of gravity. The blood squirts are over the top bright red. Zen Yi has spring loaded 8 inch spikes that pop out of 2 inches of armor. The fighting is extremely choreographed. Of course there is the signature Tarantino restaurant scene and split screen. No weird flashbacks. RZA didn't copy that.

Kill Bill, its sister film from the presenter of this film Quentin Tarantino, has its intriguing parts with anime and action but lacks a sense of direction and consistency.Iron Fists' is Wu Tang Clan's the RZA's first effort and deals with a trio of three fighting spirits, one a blacksmith, one a neglected warrior, and one a sleazy traveler/assassin who tries to secure gold from a brigade of bandits. The film, in my opinion, is better than what the critics say which have often tend to lean negative or mixed on it. What it does strongly is provide a very wicked, superfluous sense of style and direction in its narrative and something compact and grand about its plot devices and action too. Yet, amid its pluses, lies a rather formulaic, occasionally ill-paced, uneven use of Mandarin and Cantonese with English, and sometimes forgettable film that can mostly go away out of your critical mind if watching it in the background and drinking beer with a few mates.Thankfully, the never-seen-in-theaters DVD version expands more of its dense yet simple environment allows the audience more into the world of what the RZA pays homage to in terms of classic Asian martial arts cinema like Bruce Lee. Another nod to the RZA for trying to bring something wild and silly enough that it counteracts with the kind of same-old action movies these days that are full of white noise, like Taken 2, and lack a sense of uniqueness.A word of advisory goes is those reading, please by all means do not take this film very seriously unless you are one who believes in the philosophies of the Wu Tang Clan or promote Buddhism, only at certain parts.""",4,The nay-sayers are slightly wrong here.
