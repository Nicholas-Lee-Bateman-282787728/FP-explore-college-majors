850299,AFTEDMW813PAW,B0002Y4TEM,D. Gorman  &#34;Crystalline Structure Moon&#34;,"[4, 5]","You know, I was going to be generous and give this a 3 star rating even before I saw any other reviews because after all this is SUPPOSED TO be a low-budget, cheap, cheesy '80s slasher flick and I only paid 8 bucks for it, so why not?  Sure, the script, acting, special effects, sound and picture quality are all absolutely wretched, and I would never put MY name on anything that was so poorly made.  But like I said, it's only a cheap, cheesy slasher flick, and they needed to save all the money they could so they could buy as much red fingernail polish (that they used to simulate blood) for all the bloody corpse scenes.  okay, so a psycho killer maniac escapes from a mental institution, goes to the nearest college and starts killing people at random.  Sure, it's not an original premise, but what do you expect from a movie called ""Splatter U.""?  And if I ever escaped from a mental institution, that's exactly what I'd do!  As I said, the script, plot, acting, special effects and production values are all horrible, and if I was to rate this movie solely on those qualities, this film would rate ""A BIG FAT ZERO!""  But since I happen to like low-budget, cheap, cheesy, worthless '80s slasher flicks (simply for the excessive gratuitous violence, if nothing else), allow me to break down my rating system for you:1 Star:  Because one of the actresses looks a lot like a girl I know and have a crush on in real life.  I'm still trying to get her to go out with me, but that still has to be worth a star.1 Star:  For all the gruesome deaths and gratuitous violence.  After all, that's why you watch movies like this.  Right?  And they had to have gone through a fortune in red fingernail polish to make all that fake blood.  That HAS to be worth a star!1 Star:  Was going to be awarded for the obligatory topless and/or shower scene, but they didn't have one!  Imagine making a movie like Splatter U. without even one obligatory nude shower scene!  But, I'm still feeling generous, so I'll give a star out because a few of the girls were cute and they all had those ""real cool"" '80s hairstyles.  Girls with '80s hair has got to be worth a star!So there you have it!  Three stars for this distinctive slasher flick!  If you like this kind of thing, you'll have a blast.If not.......well, just look out behind you!",3,"If I ever escape from an asylum, I'D go there!",1217289600,"07 29, 2008",2008,2319,"['know', 'was', 'going', 'be', 'generous', 'give', '3', 'star', 'rating', 'even', 'saw', 'other', 'reviews', 'SUPPOSED', 'TO', 'be', 'low-budget', 'cheap', 'cheesy', ""'80s"", 'slasher', 'flick', 'only', 'paid', '8', 'bucks', 'so', 'why', 'not', 'Sure', 'script', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'sound', 'picture', 'quality', 'are', 'absolutely', 'wretched', 'would', 'never', 'put', 'MY', 'name', 'anything', 'was', 'so', 'poorly', 'made', 'said', 'only', 'cheap', 'cheesy', 'slasher', 'flick', 'needed', 'save', 'money', 'could', 'so', 'could', 'buy', 'much', 'red', 'fingernail', 'polish', 'used', 'simulate', 'blood', 'bloody', 'corpse', 'scenes', 'okay', 'psycho', 'killer', 'maniac', 'mental', 'institution', 'nearest', 'college', 'killing', 'people', 'random', 'Sure', 'not', 'original', 'premise', 'what', 'do', 'expect', 'movie', 'called', 'Splatter', 'U.', 'ever', 'escaped', 'mental', 'institution', 'exactly', 'what', ""'d"", 'do', 'said', 'script', 'plot', 'acting', 'special', 'effects', 'production', 'values', 'are', 'horrible', 'was', 'rate', 'movie', 'solely', 'qualities', 'film', 'would', 'rate', 'BIG', 'FAT', 'ZERO', 'happen', 'like', 'low-budget', 'cheap', 'cheesy', 'worthless', ""'80s"", 'slasher', 'flicks', 'simply', 'excessive', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'nothing', 'else', 'allow', 'break', 'down', 'rating', 'system', 'you:1', 'Star', 'one', 'actresses', 'lot', 'girl', 'know', 'have', 'crush', 'real', 'life', ""'m"", 'still', 'trying', 'get', 'go', 'out', 'still', 'be', 'star.1', 'Star', 'gruesome', 'deaths', 'gratuitous', 'violence', 'why', 'watch', 'movies', 'Right', 'had', 'have', 'gone', 'fortune', 'red', 'fingernail', 'polish', 'make', 'fake', 'blood', 'be', 'star', '1', 'Star', 'Was', 'going', 'be', 'awarded', 'obligatory', 'topless', 'and/or', 'shower', 'scene', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'one', 'Imagine', 'making', 'movie', 'Splatter', 'U.', 'even', 'one', 'obligatory', 'nude', 'shower', 'scene', ""'m"", 'still', 'feeling', 'generous', 'so', ""'ll"", 'give', 'star', 'out', 'few', 'girls', 'were', 'cute', 'had', 'real', 'cool', ""'80s"", 'hairstyles', 'Girls', ""'80s"", 'hair', 'got', 'be', 'star', 'So', 'there', 'have', 'Three', 'stars', 'distinctive', 'slasher', 'flick', 'like', 'kind', 'thing', ""'ll"", 'have', 'blast.If', 'not', '.well', 'just', 'look', 'out']",Splatter University

850301,A1EM1PEMH6OYDU,B0002Y4TEM,"J. Cook ""Scabboy""","[11, 17]","Splatter University is one of those so bad it's good school slasher movies. The movie really doesn't have much going for it with the acting and directing, but it has blood and lots of it. The movie is cheesy, and some of the acting was so friggen bad that it was hilarious. The cast was full of nice looking girls, but not much in the bar ass department. Aw, shucks. The movie also did a great job with introducing some great potential killers, but for some reason, for me, the real killer made himself obvious. With that being said, I still thought the ending of the movie was great, even though the heroine was killed.When you think of school slasher movies, you usually think of a lot of bare t n' a, sadly this movie didn't have very much of that (but it did have a lot of teases). Some of the camera work was really shaky and overall bad, the directing and editing really lacked as well, but in a very weird way, it added a lot to the cheesiness of the movie. The killer, in my opinion, even though they tried to introduce other potential killers, was very obvious. But, perhaps that was intentional. I also really disliked that the would be heroine Julie (Francine Forbes), the leading lady of the film, get's killed in the climax of the movie. She was the cutest cast member, and the one I was rooting for!I loved this movie. It wasn't as cheesy as the Slumber Party/Sorority House Massacre movies, as well done as Slaughter and Hell High, or as funny as Return To Horror High, but it was great. The movie had a lot of blood, (intentional and unintentional) humor, chicks, bad hair-do's, bad acting and everything else you would want in a cheesy drive-in-style movie. I would highly recommend this for fans of the above listed movies, and of course to gore hounds. The movie had a lot of that, and it was very well done (for the era), which can be a rarity. One other thing that confused me was that the DVD cover had photos of two deaths on the back, both of which are not in the movie.

Let's look at the good and bad as far as I see it:Pro's:1. Good gore effects2. Horrendous acting and dialogue (it's seriously laughable, at least I did)Con's:Everything else. Seriously, this movie was shot on 16mm then blown up to 35mm. It has no redeeming value and is a slow mover but the gore is entertaining.

850304,A3JTBJC5WSEZ7Q,B0002Y4TEM,Thomas M. Sipos,"[1, 1]","SPLATTER UNIVERSITY is a pretty inept film, yet I love it.A young woman takes on a teaching assignment at a ""university."" The sets look more like a bottom-of-the-barrel community college to me. Actually, it looks like a high school building, but I suppose it could pass for a low rent community college.A previous teacher had been killed last semester, and now the killings start again. Students as well as teachers are killed. There's not much more to the plot. It's a slasher film. There's a body count of stupid victims. What more do you need?The acting is awful. Many of the lines are delivered in wooden tones. Some actors chew the scenery. I don't think most of the cast performed in anything else, though the lead actress went on to host a lot of infomercials under another name.The special effects are not very special. Mostly just blood tossed about. When a knife goes into a victim's body, the body looks like a sandbag or sack of flour, with a blouse over it. That is to say, the ""body"" looks very stiff and shapeless. Obviously not a human body.But that's okay. That's what suspension of disbelief is for. I can overlook the poor effects and accept that it's a human body.The DVD's visual quality is acceptable, but not that great. It's kind of grainy. But this is because the film was shot on 16mm, so it's likely the best you'll ever see of this film. Happily, the film's graininess supports the story's ""streets of New Jersey"" grittiness.SPLATTER UNIVERSITY is very entertaining. I've seen it many times. Shot in New Jersey, it's full of strong New Jersey accents and stereotypes. Many of the guys sound Italian (of course, there's one named Tony), and they're always making sexist remarks toward their girls. One of those girl's has HUGE HAIR, the sort the 1980s were famous for. She also wears 1980s punk leather clothing.That's another fun aspect to SPLATTER UNIVERSITY. It's a time capsule of politically incorrect, fashion catastrophe, 1980s New Jersey.SPLATTER UNIVERSITY was Troma Film's contribution to the 1980s slasher bandwagon. I'm not a big fan of Troma films. Most of them have too much lame humor. But SPLATTER UNIVERSITY andMother's Dayare my two favorite Troma films, because the horror elements are able to hold their own -- the humor is merely some added spice (unlike in some other Troma films, where the humor is so pervasive, it overwhelms the horror).",3,"poorly made, but very entertaining -- a nostalgic look at 1980s New Jersey",1384560000,"11 16, 2013",2013,2389,"['SPLATTER', 'UNIVERSITY', 'pretty', 'inept', 'film', 'yet', 'love', 'it.A', 'young', 'woman', 'teaching', 'assignment', 'university', 'sets', 'look', 'more', 'bottom-of-the-barrel', 'community', 'college', 'Actually', 'high', 'school', 'building', 'suppose', 'could', 'pass', 'low', 'rent', 'community', 'college.A', 'previous', 'teacher', 'had', 'been', 'killed', 'last', 'semester', 'now', 'killings', 'start', 'again', 'Students', 'as', 'well', 'teachers', 'are', 'killed', 'not', 'much', 'more', 'plot', 'slasher', 'film', 'body', 'count', 'stupid', 'victims', 'What', 'more', 'do', 'need', 'acting', 'awful', 'Many', 'lines', 'are', 'delivered', 'wooden', 'tones', 'actors', 'chew', 'scenery', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'most', 'cast', 'performed', 'anything', 'else', 'lead', 'actress', 'went', 'host', 'lot', 'infomercials', 'name.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'not', 'very', 'special', 'Mostly', 'just', 'blood', 'tossed', 'about', 'When', 'knife', 'victim', 'body', 'body', 'sandbag', 'sack', 'flour', 'blouse', 'say', 'body', 'very', 'stiff', 'shapeless', 'Obviously', 'not', 'human', 'body.But', 'okay', 'what', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'can', 'overlook', 'poor', 'effects', 'accept', 'human', 'body.The', 'DVD', 'visual', 'quality', 'acceptable', 'not', 'great', 'kind', 'grainy', 'film', 'was', 'shot', '16mm', 'likely', 'best', ""'ll"", 'ever', 'see', 'film', 'Happily', 'film', 'graininess', 'story', 'streets', 'New', 'Jersey', 'grittiness.SPLATTER', 'UNIVERSITY', 'very', 'entertaining', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'many', 'times', 'Shot', 'New', 'Jersey', 'full', 'strong', 'New', 'Jersey', 'accents', 'stereotypes', 'Many', 'guys', 'sound', 'Italian', 'course', 'one', 'named', 'Tony', ""'re"", 'always', 'making', 'sexist', 'remarks', 'girls', 'One', 'girl', 'HUGE', 'HAIR', 'sort', '1980s', 'were', 'famous', 'also', '1980s', 'punk', 'leather', 'clothing.That', 'fun', 'aspect', 'SPLATTER', 'UNIVERSITY', 'time', 'capsule', 'politically', 'incorrect', 'fashion', 'catastrophe', '1980s', 'New', 'Jersey.SPLATTER', 'UNIVERSITY', 'was', 'Troma', 'Film', 'contribution', '1980s', 'slasher', 'bandwagon', ""'m"", 'not', 'big', 'fan', 'Troma', 'films', 'Most', 'have', 'too', 'much', 'lame', 'humor', 'SPLATTER', 'UNIVERSITY', 'andMother', 'Dayare', 'two', 'favorite', 'Troma', 'films', 'horror', 'elements', 'are', 'able', 'hold', 'own', 'humor', 'merely', 'added', 'spice', 'other', 'Troma', 'films', 'where', 'humor', 'so', 'pervasive', 'horror']",Splatter University
