It deals with some heavy topics such as death and classism. But it does so in a very gentle and appropriate way. It also emphasizes the importance of honesty, work ethic, friendship, and creativity. The majority of the movie makes you feel so good about the friends and the loyal dog.In case you are afraid of a sad ending, there is a very dramatic climax which leaves you feeling gutted, but then is followed with a montage to remind you of all the wonderful things leading up to it. Lastly you are brought back to present day with the friends greeting each other and happily revealing what has become of their lives.It is a real shame that the movie wasn't distributed more. It is difficult to find but worth the effort.",5,"A beautiful, touching story",1258156800,"11 14, 2009",2009,847,"['are', 'many', 'emotions', 'wrapped', 'up', 'movie', 'joy', 'watch', 'kids', 'age', '7', '9', 'gave', 'two', 'heavy', 'topics', 'such', 'death', 'classism', 'so', 'very', 'gentle', 'appropriate', 'way', 'also', 'importance', 'honesty', 'work', 'ethic', 'friendship', 'creativity', 'majority', 'movie', 'feel', 'so', 'good', 'friends', 'loyal', 'dog.In', 'case', 'are', 'afraid', 'sad', 'ending', 'very', 'dramatic', 'climax', 'feeling', 'gutted', 'then', 'followed', 'montage', 'remind', 'wonderful', 'things', 'leading', 'up', 'Lastly', 'are', 'brought', 'back', 'present', 'day', 'friends', 'greeting', 'other', 'happily', 'revealing', 'what', 'become', 'lives.It', 'real', 'shame', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'distributed', 'more', 'difficult', 'find', 'effort']",The Dog of Flanders VHS

We were thinking, ""La-tee-da, a happy movie, with beautiful Japanese animation (in the tradition of Kiki's Delivery Service and Totoro), about a boy and his dog . . ."" And boy, were we in for a loo-loo of a surprise. I never cried so much at an animated movie, I gave myself one mondo killer headache, attempting to retain some composure for my child's sake, but lost it in the end, and we both sat there, in her room and cried together. She summed things up pretty well, when she said, ""Mommy, sometimes sad movies are still beautiful."" And this one is a beautiful story indeed.The movie is about a poor,young boy and his love for his dog.(and vice versa) He lives an oh-so-humble, but happy life with his aging grandfather. The movie tells the story of how his life then changes, based on the actions/thoughts of those around him. It's also about art/love and the beauty of art, as the young boy, the center of the movie, Nello, loves to draw, and does it well. He longs to see some of the paintings of Reubens,but cannot afford the cost of viewing the paintings.I guess the overall message of the movie is that, God is beauty and art and love and the three of these things are all one giant amorphous blob of , well, blob of goodness . . .and that human lives are fragile and finite.I wouldn't recommend this for the very young, and would suggest parents view the entire movie (with tissue nearby) before showing to the kiddies.",5,"Oh Boy, Did I Cry, And How!",1047427200,"03 12, 2003",2003,1528,"['Where', 'do', 'start', 'giving', 'anything', 'away', 'watched', 'movie', 'yesterday', 'daughter', 'were', 'thinking', 'La-tee-da', 'happy', 'movie', 'beautiful', 'Japanese', 'animation', 'tradition', 'Kiki', 'Delivery', 'Service', 'Totoro', 'boy', 'dog', 'boy', 'were', 'loo-loo', 'surprise', 'never', 'cried', 'so', 'much', 'animated', 'movie', 'gave', 'one', 'mondo', 'killer', 'headache', 'attempting', 'retain', 'composure', 'child', 'sake', 'lost', 'end', 'sat', 'there', 'room', 'cried', 'together', 'summed', 'things', 'up', 'pretty', 'well', 'when', 'said', 'Mommy', 'sometimes', 'sad', 'movies', 'are', 'still', 'beautiful', 'one', 'beautiful', 'story', 'indeed.The', 'movie', 'poor', 'young', 'boy', 'love', 'dog', 'vice', 'versa', 'oh-so-humble', 'happy', 'life', 'aging', 'grandfather', 'movie', 'story', 'how', 'life', 'then', 'changes', 'based', 'actions/thoughts', 'also', 'about', 'art/love', 'beauty', 'art', 'young', 'boy', 'center', 'movie', 'Nello', 'draw', 'well', 'see', 'paintings', 'Reubens', 'can', 'not', 'afford', 'cost', 'viewing', 'paintings.I', 'guess', 'overall', 'message', 'movie', 'God', 'beauty', 'art', 'love', 'three', 'things', 'are', 'one', 'giant', 'amorphous', 'blob', 'well', 'blob', 'goodness', '.and', 'human', 'lives', 'are', 'fragile', 'finite.I', 'would', ""n't"", 'recommend', 'very', 'young', 'would', 'suggest', 'parents', 'view', 'entire', 'movie', 'tissue', 'nearby', 'showing', 'kiddies']",The Dog of Flanders VHS

First Off, this is the EDITED VERSION, and ONLY the EDITED VERSION! Scenes were cut from the original Japanese theatrical release to 'tame the violence to the dog' sequences, which were some important moments. Also, the original Japanese dialogue is nowhere on this disc.But for some reason, the VHS release comes in either edited and dubbed, or widescreen uncut japanese with english subtitles.My opinion is to go for the subtitled uncut version on VHS. Either that or somehow find the original series that aired on Japanese TV years ago to get the full story.This movie is an absolute treasure in many Japanese childrens' childhoods, and now pioneer disgraces the DVD format.5 stars for the movie, and 4 stars gets retracted for the butchering.",1,Pioneer DVD Shames The Movie,1052265600,"05 7, 2003",2003,850,"['classic', 'World', 'Masterpiece', 'Theater', 'series', 'seriously', 'botched', 'Pioneer', 'Entertainment', 'First', 'Off', 'EDITED', 'VERSION', 'ONLY', 'EDITED', 'VERSION', 'Scenes', 'were', 'cut', 'original', 'Japanese', 'theatrical', 'release', ""'tame"", 'violence', 'dog', 'sequences', 'were', 'important', 'moments', 'Also', 'original', 'Japanese', 'dialogue', 'nowhere', 'disc.But', 'reason', 'VHS', 'release', 'edited', 'dubbed', 'widescreen', 'uncut', 'japanese', 'english', 'subtitles.My', 'opinion', 'go', 'subtitled', 'uncut', 'version', 'VHS', 'somehow', 'find', 'original', 'series', 'aired', 'Japanese', 'TV', 'years', 'ago', 'get', 'full', 'story.This', 'movie', 'absolute', 'treasure', 'many', 'Japanese', 'childrens', 'childhoods', 'now', 'pioneer', 'disgraces', 'DVD', 'format.5', 'stars', 'movie', '4', 'stars', 'retracted', 'butchering']",The Dog of Flanders VHS
