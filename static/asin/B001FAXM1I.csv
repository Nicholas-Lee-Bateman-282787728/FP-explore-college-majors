I could not believe the dogs were donated by the owners for the war effort.  I think the people donating the dogs, this was the family pet not donated by breeders.  Unbelievable!  The photos of the dogs and their handlers were beautiful, black and white photos.  The dog of choice for the Marines was the Doberman. The dogs were very handsome and almost appeared to know exactly what they were doing and how they were helping the war effort.  Almost every dog came home.  To hear the marine handlers tell their story was great.  I felt sorry for the one marine handler who gave the dog back to the original owner and when the marine went and visted the dog the owner was annoyed. The dog lived out his life guarding a lot in a liquor store in Chicago.  Even the dog cemetary in Guam was very moving.

1188339,A28IO5BJIV1DPB,B001FAXM1I,TaeKwonDodo,"[2, 2]","This documentary summarizes the story of the MArine war dog platoon in WWII and their actions in the Pacific Theater, from the first days of early training to the actual experience in conflict. We see surviving veterans, including Dr William Putney, DVM- the first vet/head of the platoon- discuss their memories of the war and the dogs that served alongside them.I watched this documentary on the Military Channel, and then promptly ordered my copy of the DVD. As a dog lover myself, I can attest to the incredible love and loyalty that grows between a dog and his human companion. I can imagine how deep and strong that bond can be between a young soldier, far from home and probably frightened and lonely, and the dog that he has been assigned to care for during a war when so many other human emotions fall to the wayside. The dogs clearly saved many lives, and were invaluable to the soldiers in so many other ways. They were heroes too, and I can only applaud Dr. Putney's determined effort to see these dogs recognized for their service. Unfortunately the war dogs of Vietnam had no such advocate on their side, and countless numbers of them were left behind when Saigon fell.I would also recommend that you read Dr. Putney's book - ""Always Faithful:A Memoir of the Marine Dogs of WWII"".  The book fleshes out some details, and many of the dogs and handlers mentioned in the book an be seen on the DVD",4,More war heroes that are often forgotten,1260230400,"12 8, 2009",2009,1408,"['documentary', 'story', 'MArine', 'war', 'dog', 'platoon', 'WWII', 'actions', 'Pacific', 'Theater', 'first', 'days', 'early', 'training', 'actual', 'experience', 'conflict', 'see', 'surviving', 'veterans', 'including', 'Dr', 'William', 'Putney', 'DVM-', 'first', 'vet/head', 'platoon-', 'discuss', 'memories', 'war', 'dogs', 'served', 'alongside', 'them.I', 'watched', 'documentary', 'Military', 'Channel', 'then', 'promptly', 'ordered', 'copy', 'DVD', 'dog', 'lover', 'can', 'attest', 'incredible', 'love', 'loyalty', 'dog', 'human', 'companion', 'can', 'imagine', 'how', 'deep', 'strong', 'bond', 'can', 'be', 'young', 'soldier', 'far', 'home', 'probably', 'frightened', 'lonely', 'dog', 'been', 'assigned', 'care', 'war', 'when', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'human', 'emotions', 'fall', 'wayside', 'dogs', 'clearly', 'saved', 'many', 'lives', 'were', 'invaluable', 'soldiers', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'ways', 'were', 'heroes', 'too', 'can', 'only', 'applaud', 'Dr.', 'Putney', 'determined', 'effort', 'see', 'dogs', 'recognized', 'service', 'Unfortunately', 'war', 'dogs', 'Vietnam', 'had', 'such', 'advocate', 'side', 'countless', 'numbers', 'were', 'left', 'behind', 'when', 'Saigon', 'fell.I', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'read', 'Dr.', 'Putney', 'book', 'Always', 'Faithful', 'Memoir', 'Marine', 'Dogs', 'WWII', 'book', 'out', 'details', 'many', 'dogs', 'handlers', 'mentioned', 'book', 'be', 'seen', 'DVD']",War Dogs of the Pacific
