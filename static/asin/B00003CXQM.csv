532830,A2DRHY9HJ4DE1F,B00003CXQM,Ahmed,"[6, 12]","This movie is neither creative nor thought-provoking, all because it's not an original idea. It's just this big copy of different fictional masterpieces that have come together to create a catastrophe! They just mixed TV shows in together namely Crystal maze and Xena Warrior Princess. They really tried to copy Tomb Raider's (the game) levels only insulting the artists that created the game with their pathetic attempt to make a great fantasy flick! They tried to make such a great Star Wars kind-of-movie only to make a disaster of the cinema industry. They had would-be light saber fights and even this weird podrace. The costumes and the sets make this statement even more obvious!The make-up was horrible. The lighting was terrible and it ruined one of the only good things about this feature-the cinematography! And what's with the colours? Most of the film was dull green, red, and orange in color (sets, costumes)! The costumes were another thing that needed professional help. What happens when the costumes from ""Star Wars Episode I"" meet ""The Lost World""? A nuclear meltdown- a fiasco, also known as ""Dungeons and Dragons""!They could have made such a good movie because the title is pretty good. It sounds like something you'd want to see but you realize that it's really not something you'd want to see, 4 minutes into the movie. Worst scenes were the ones with the main characters. In the DVD special feature option, the alternate ending the director decided not to use was a whole lot better and more realistic than the surreal so-called surprising ending he decided to use! The deleted scenes in the DVD were the best scenes in the movie- some of them were actually okay (but not amusing enough to make me laugh). I would call this a kiddy movie but I would just be insulting and embarrassing the kids around the world!I shouldn't forget the sound. The sound-editing was hopeless, i.e. it can't be fixed (it was that bad). As for the score, the crew don't know what musical sequence they are supposed to use. When someone dies this cheerful score starts in the background with fanfares and chimes!If you really want to know, the plot revolves around this empress that needs to use these scrolls so she can find this thing to control these fake red dragons but the bad guy also wants it. So her mentor's librarian and two commoners help her find it in one of cinematic history's most disappointing adventures! Some war! My sister's fights with me last longer than that! One of the best things about this movie was that it ended so quickly!Who wrote this? The script-every line in the script was messed up. Either they computer didn't print the script out properly or the writers are just plain bad! They're untalented and can't distinguish between good and bad. But there was one thing I really liked and appreciated! The font they used for the ending credits was fascinating!Now let's look at the cast! Jeremy Irons (Propion)-word of advice, stick to doing voices like Scar's in ""The Lion King"" because this may be news to you but you can't act! Thora Birch (The Empress), I can barely hear your soft whispery voice but it really doesn't matter because you really don't have anything important to say. You try to dress like Queen Amidala but you will forever offend her. Your speeches are uninspiring, tedious, simple, and completely pointless! You tried so hard to become the next Queen Amidala and I pity you, I really do. You acted so badly that I couldn't even laugh at you! Your speeches are so memorable- I'll never forget how stupid and uncalled for  they all were! They were the exact opposite of Al Pacino's speech at the end of ""Scent Of A Woman"".  As for you Zoe McLellan (Marina), you need acting lessons like the rest of the cast. I have yet to spot a scene where you don't have this traumatized and puzzled expression on your face! But Kristin Wilson (Norda) is one person I feel really bad for. She was the only person that gave a reasonably good acting performance. Unfortunately for Wilson, the whole movie was stupid.  As for the movie's main character, Justin Whalin- you should really stick to TV shows because you don't know how to act and your performance was laughable. At least Scary Movie's Shorty (Marlon Wayans) did what he does best. Acts mad! As for Bruce Payne (Damodar), you're a payne in the ***! First question: ""What is with you and that blue fluorescent lipstick?"" Question #2: ""Are you really this lifeless in real life?"" You sound like you have a thousand frogs stuck in his throat!The movie was a mixture of dim-witted characters that were just wannabes of other famous characters. The characters tried to imitate Xena, Queen Amidala, Darth Vader, Lara Croft, Hercules, The Amazons, and Indiana Jones among others, only to fail miserably! The cast can't even cry. The tears were so phony, it would have been more realistic if they drained an ocean and splashed their faces with water to form tears. Even the laughs are fake, they sounded like the ones Dr. Evil's crew do in Austin Powers (and they have an excuse because they're supposed to sound fake). In short, this is the worst cast ensemble in the history of motion pictures! Everyone's (except Kristin Wilson) acting was so awful that it was upsetting. Did the casting people actually hold auditions for this movie or did they just pull people off the streets?This movie is so unbelievably surprising (not in a good way) that it would be the Oscars' worst nightmare but the Raspberries' dream come true! The D&D; crew did a good job of making sure they do the worst of everything the Oscars look at before nominating a film. Just for the record, I didn't feel like finishing this movie and I only did for the sake of this review to warn all those who dare to rent such a pathetic piece of work!",1,This movie was so

532831,A9998RE3AEA95,B00003CXQM,Alex,"[16, 19]","After a dark and ominous opening narration, we see a great mage's chamber, almost completely taken up by the standard Giant Twirling Machine (a la ""Dark Crystal""). Cut to a wild-eyed Profion (Irons), who paces toward the camera and STARES. But wait! he's just staring at the machinery behind us. Lightning sparks, and the wheels spins faster: a wand is being charged. Profion extatically darts to the machine, plucks the scepter, and proclaims: ""Yes! At last!""""Release him!"" Profion commands. A henchman gasps; he's never to be seen again. Henchmen spin flywheels. A grate is raised, revealing an irate dragon. The beast spits fire, causing henchmen to scatter. Cut to one tripping and falling. Cut to another catching fire. Profion points his wand and rasps: ""You are mine now! Come to me!"" His blue-lipped right-hand man looks on admiringly.  Then the spell is broken and the dragon gets mad. Profion crushes the beast with a portcullis and covers his face in frustration. There's always another day.Thus begins a movie that does a disservice to the already-marred name of fantasy cinema, a genre with a ""Conan"" for every ""Willow."" ""Dungeons & Dragons"" is a relentlessly idiotic action-comedy that is best compared to Power Rangers: there's a lot of special effects and colorful scenery, but it's little more than computer-game grapics and some plastic armor on the orcs. To add insult, the movie has nothing to do with the game.Alright, I take that back: there are a few things.  There's a tiny, meaningless cameo of a beholder; and a hold spell is mentioned (though it's performed with rope); even the kingdom of Izmer looks like something an amateur DM threw together.But all the nostalgia in the world won't prepare you for the ""heroes"": a young queen (Birch) who ambles about spouting populist nonsense (""I do declare that you now all equal!""); a pair of young enterprising thieves, Ripley (Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans), whose lingo and body language mark them as refugees from ""Scary Movie""; an oddly mangy and gangly dwarf, whose function is to a) run around waving an axe and b) to furrow his brows disapprovingly; Marina (McClellan), who knows about three spells and, I guess, is supposed to be the love interest for one of the thieves (not Wayans); and, lastly, Norda the elfin seeker, who appears to have been shoe-horned into the movie. This sorry bunch has to travel to a distant ruin to recover the Wand of Red Dragon Control for reasons unknown to the viewer (the charaters teleport INTO a scroll, and reappear with their mission explained to them).Two questions inevitably arise: who lights the torches in the Antius Maze if no one's ever gotten through? and, more interestingly, how did Profion sneak that first dragon into the castle?In addition, the movie is infinitely quotable: ""I've never seen a scroll so hard to decode! It's very ancient!"" (just like a sage to say that) ""You've gotta believe it, they're framing us."" (a bit too modern, no?) and, perhaps the best, ""Do not let them escape or you will suffer a fate far worse than that which has been inflicted upon me!"" (try yelling that in one breath!).One scene is especially memorable: Ripley is surrounded by Damodar's troops, and decides to hold the scroll hostage by setting it on fire: ""Clear the way and I'll put it out."" The scroll catches fire - but doesn't burn.Oh, alright, one last one: as Ripley and Co. leave the elfin lands, two masked natives speak in gibberish in the movie's one scene with subtitles. ""Does he know of his untapped potential?"" one blurbles. ""He soon will,"" replies another.",1,I haven't laughed this hard in ages.,1011744000,"01 23, 2002",2002,3590,"['dark', 'ominous', 'opening', 'narration', 'see', 'great', 'mage', 'chamber', 'almost', 'completely', 'taken', 'up', 'standard', 'Giant', 'Twirling', 'Machine', 'la', 'Dark', 'Crystal', 'Cut', 'wild-eyed', 'Profion', 'Irons', 'who', 'camera', 'STARES', 'wait', 'just', 'staring', 'machinery', 'Lightning', 'sparks', 'wheels', 'faster', 'wand', 'being', 'charged', 'Profion', 'extatically', 'machine', 'scepter', 'proclaims', 'Yes', 'last', 'Release', 'Profion', 'henchman', 'gasps', 'never', 'be', 'seen', 'again', 'Henchmen', 'spin', 'flywheels', 'grate', 'raised', 'revealing', 'irate', 'dragon', 'beast', 'spits', 'fire', 'causing', 'henchmen', 'scatter', 'Cut', 'one', 'tripping', 'falling', 'Cut', 'catching', 'fire', 'Profion', 'points', 'wand', 'rasps', 'are', 'mine', 'now', 'Come', 'blue-lipped', 'right-hand', 'man', 'admiringly', 'Then', 'spell', 'broken', 'dragon', 'mad', 'Profion', 'beast', 'portcullis', 'face', 'frustration', 'always', 'day.Thus', 'movie', 'disservice', 'already-marred', 'name', 'fantasy', 'cinema', 'genre', 'Conan', 'Willow', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'relentlessly', 'idiotic', 'action-comedy', 'best', 'compared', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'colorful', 'scenery', 'little', 'more', 'computer-game', 'grapics', 'plastic', 'armor', 'orcs', 'add', 'insult', 'movie', 'nothing', 'do', 'game.Alright', 'take', 'back', 'are', 'few', 'things', 'tiny', 'meaningless', 'cameo', 'beholder', 'hold', 'spell', 'mentioned', 'performed', 'rope', 'even', 'kingdom', 'Izmer', 'looks', 'something', 'amateur', 'DM', 'threw', 'together.But', 'nostalgia', 'world', 'wo', ""n't"", 'prepare', 'heroes', 'young', 'queen', 'Birch', 'who', 'spouting', 'populist', 'nonsense', 'do', 'declare', 'now', 'equal', 'pair', 'young', 'enterprising', 'thieves', 'Ripley', 'Whalin', 'Snails', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'lingo', 'body', 'language', 'mark', 'refugees', 'Scary', 'Movie', 'oddly', 'mangy', 'gangly', 'dwarf', 'function', 'run', 'around', 'waving', 'axe', 'b', 'furrow', 'brows', 'disapprovingly', 'Marina', 'McClellan', 'who', 'three', 'spells', 'guess', 'supposed', 'be', 'love', 'interest', 'one', 'thieves', 'not', 'Wayans', 'lastly', 'Norda', 'elfin', 'seeker', 'who', 'have', 'been', 'shoe-horned', 'movie', 'sorry', 'bunch', 'travel', 'distant', 'ruin', 'recover', 'Wand', 'Red', 'Dragon', 'Control', 'reasons', 'unknown', 'viewer', 'charaters', 'teleport', 'INTO', 'scroll', 'reappear', 'mission', 'explained', '.Two', 'questions', 'inevitably', 'arise', 'who', 'torches', 'Antius', 'Maze', 'one', 'ever', 'gotten', 'more', 'interestingly', 'how', 'did', 'Profion', 'sneak', 'first', 'dragon', 'castle', 'addition', 'movie', 'infinitely', 'quotable', ""'ve"", 'never', 'seen', 'scroll', 'so', 'hard', 'decode', 'very', 'ancient', 'just', 'sage', 'say', ""'ve"", 'got', 'ta', 'believe', ""'re"", 'framing', 'bit', 'too', 'modern', 'perhaps', 'best', 'Do', 'not', 'let', 'escape', 'will', 'suffer', 'fate', 'far', 'worse', 'been', 'inflicted', 'try', 'yelling', 'one', 'breath', '.One', 'scene', 'especially', 'memorable', 'Ripley', 'surrounded', 'Damodar', 'troops', 'hold', 'scroll', 'hostage', 'setting', 'fire', 'way', ""'ll"", 'put', 'out', 'scroll', 'catches', 'fire', ""n't"", 'burn.Oh', 'alright', 'one', 'last', 'one', 'Ripley', 'Co.', 'leave', 'elfin', 'two', 'masked', 'natives', 'speak', 'gibberish', 'movie', 'one', 'scene', 'subtitles', 'know', 'untapped', 'potential', 'one', 'soon', 'will']",Dungeons & Dragons

It lacks everything that LOTR has-believeable,sympathetic characters,passionate romance,menacing villains,and stirring battles. It's hard to tell if ""Dungeons and Dragons"" were made as a parody,or if it were (gasp!) taking itself seriously.Thora Birch is Savina,the drag queen-imitating Queen of Izmer. She wants everybody to be equal-magical and non-magical people alike. She's like Dumbledore,in a way. The evil archmage Profion,a dastardly hammy Jeremy Irons (and the sole actor who seems to be having a rip-roaring fun time) takes away her royal scepter. He wants raw power. Of course,he believes magical people are superior to non-magical ones. He's like Dumbledore's boyfriend,Grindelward,in a way. Savina needs the Rod of Savrille to conqueror the bad guys&rule; over the red dragons. Who will come to the rescue? Two ""loveable"" ""comedy relief"" bandits,Ridley and Snails. The haplessly named Snails is a stereotypical Uncle Tom character. Ridley and Snails get in a bar fight,romance a dowdy librarian,encounter villains...including Profion's right hand man,Blue Lips. In the end,Ridley is ""The Chosen One."" Snails sacrifices his life for equality,and Ridley is healed by Dr.Who,Tom Baker,in a lackluster Lothlorien lookalike. There's a cheesy battle at the end as well. Snails' friends dissolve into sand,or bubbles,or glitter (from the flop Mariah Carey movie of the same yr?),or Colombian White Lady...huh?This could've been a FUN,cheesy movie like ""Krull"",which had some creative ideas and energy.

We've been waiting for almost 30 years for the definitive D&amp;D movie to come along and vindicate us in front of all those stupid jerks in high school who called us &quot;geeks&quot; for playing D&amp;D. We wanted them all to see what we were so worked up about, and this movie just didn't do it.It's still a fun movie, though, and the DVD has some GREAT features like the &quot;maze&quot; you have to navigate to make it to the Special Features Menu. The actors definitely gave it their best (it's too easy to overlook Marlon Wayans performance as pure throwaway slapstick), but they weren't quite up to the task. Except for Jeremy Irons, of course. That man took this as an opportunity to chew more scenery than the dragons! The film needed someone more experienced than Courtney Solomon to reign him in.  Nevertheless, the first-time director did a very whiz-bang job on his first gig.  Bravo!I first saw the movie on opening day with 30 friends, fellow gamers, and spouses.  Our &quot;better halves&quot; were actually less disappointed than we were; they didn't have all their hopes and dreams hanging on it.All in all, the D&amp;D movie will forever be enshrined on many a Geek's shelf, right up there with &quot;Highlander,&quot; &quot;Blade Runner,&quot; and all the other movies that make us obsessive-compulsive fanboys.

Don't waste your money on this one, but it might be fun to watch with a group of drunk friends if you can catch it on cable.The level of bad acting and/or overacting in this film doens't compare to anything I've ever seen, except maybe for Xena or Hercules or other such shows dubbed &quot;Cheesy Adventure Shows.&quot; They are the ones that are fun to watch, but so mind-numbing that it suprises me that I can rememeber how to work the remote control once they're over. This movie is very much like those.The story, about two theives sucked into journey to find a magical artifact that will help save a kingdom of rival mages from civil war, was not quite boring, but far from engrossing. It lightly touched on the &quot;mythology&quot; of the game from time to time, but never paid it the tribute that was due. The character development was mostly non-existent, so by the end I found myself not really caring what happened to any of them. And the casting... I'll take &quot;Movies that Marlon Wayans Should Not Be In&quot; for $400, Alex. Wayans doesn't ruin the movie himself, but just becomes part of a long list of negative qualities that make this film the abomination that it was.The worst part of all is this: After being around for decades, D&amp;D has a built-in audience. This is probably what New Line was counting on for profits. What they failed to realize is that the players take their game serioulsy, and unfortunately the makers of this movie didn't. The movie became more of a mockery of the game than anything else. Bad move, even if they were going for a more comical or playful angle. If New Line makes the same mistake with Lord Of The Rings, they will find themselves strongly hated after the holidays, and sadly bankrupt by mid 2002.The only reason this gets two stars from me is becuase if you watch this movie with the attitude that it's &quot;just another cheesy adventure show,&quot; you may actually enjoy it. Grab a beer, and prepare to laugh at how horrible the movie is, MST3K style. However, if you are a follower of the game or the mythology of D&amp;D, then this is a sad waste of time.

After all my years of growing up with Dungeons and Dragons and they throw this movie at me.  Were the movie done right it could have been very magical, but it was utterly horrible.  Lets examine some of the aspects that made this movie fail.Marlon Wayans as Snails was a very funny character that was just played all wrong within the movie.  The fact that they killed off his character to gain some emotion from the audience did not work, because it was not believable.  His battle scene with Damodar was horrible to look at and I actually laughed at the death scence.Justin Whalin as Ridley Freeborne was actually a good character to focus on the movie, but his part was written all wrong.  And the fact that he basically saves the entire movie is just not believable.  Were they trying to follow some aspects of D&amp;D?  A Theif/Master Swordsman played by a human?  And then to wield a two-handed sword?  Not likely...maybe a Half-Elf..Zoe McLellan as Marina of Pretensa was frightfull to watch.  She was way to overly dramatic throughtout the movie especially at the scene were she yells at Ridley telling him that the empress wishes to make everyone equal.  Who is she trying to fool?  She is pretty, but no actress.  You best bet for future work is the become a maxim covergirl.Lee Arenberg as Elwood (Dwarf Warrior)......I am not even going to go there.  His part in the movie had no meaning and no purpose.Thora Birch as Empress Savina was a bold move to spark interest in the movie seeing as she was part of the excellent movie, American Beauty.  Thora's being in the movie did not even help the least bit.  And then there is the fact that she was barely written into the movie....Jeremy Irons as Profion was one of the worst parts to play.  He played his character as a mad, insane cry-baby that did not want to share its candy with the rest of the people.  Do he seriously think he could ever rebound from his role in Lolita?Bruce Payne as Damodar was the greatest and funniest part of the movie!  Talk about someone flunking evil character 101 class, he could not even get it right.  Be sure and give a good laugh at the scene where he tells one of this warriors not to mess up in capturing Ridley in a bar or they will suffer a fate worse than that was bestowed on him.I cannot believe they tried to milk the D&amp;D genre with this movie.  I am glad it bombed because it was a movie that was rushed, and not worthy making.

And someone wake Thora Birch up: She seems to have slipped into some sort of sleepwalking coma.Having said that, the ""Dungeons & Dragons"" movie wasn't as horrible as I'd heard it made out to be.

Sets were Far Too Busy; Effects were Far Too Computerised, (I don't think there was a single shot in the film that didn't have something computerised in it) and the Acting...My God, the Acting. I'll need a whole Paragraph to express my feelings about the Acting.Firstly, ""Dungeons and Dragons"" doesn't feature Actors; It features ""Over Actors"". Everyone, Absolutely Everyone in the film Overacts. From the Leads to the Extras, from the Shakespearian Trained Actors (Jeremy Irons, Bruce Payne), to the Square Jawed Heroes (Justin Whalin, Thora Birch), to the So Called Comic Relief (Marlon Wayans). They all Chew the Scenery.The Special Effects simply look Fake, there is no easier way to put it. If we, the audience, are expected to Care about the characters, and what is going on, we have to believe (at least a little) that what is happening.. IS Happening. The Effects are a Constant reminder that we live in the age of Computer Graphics. Instead of thinking ""Dragons are Attacking that Man"", I was thinking ""That Man is Standing in front of a Blue Screen on a Sound Stage"". The Effects may look Cool here and there, but they never once look Real. If this same Special Effects company made ""Jurassic Park"", it would have Flopped Big Time.The film Blatantly Steals some scenes, or elements from the Infinitely Superior ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" films (any Star Wars or Indy fan should Easily be able to pick out at least 5 such instances) in a pathetic attempt to leach off their Popularity.. It doesn't work, not by a Long Shot.

The new young Empress Savina (Thora Birch), with the idealism of youth, has resolved to make things better for *all* her people, not just the nobility and the mages who make up her Council.  But Profion (Jeremy Irons), a powerful mage who has been trying to gain control of the gold dragons (something confined so far to Savina, by virtue of her scepter), leads a parliamentary revolt against her.  Two young thieves, Ridley Freeborn (Justin Whalin) and his best friend Snails (Marlon Wayans), are attempting to burgle the mages' stronghold when they're discovered by Marina Pretensa (Zoe McLellan), a young apprentice mage and librarian who has just come into possession of a map that shows the way to an artifact that may be critical to Savina's cause.  The problem is that Profion knows about it too, and when he sends Damodar (Bruce Payne), his enforcer, to seize it, the three young people find themselves on the run and up to their necks in affairs beyond their control.  Allying with a dwarf (Lee Arenberg) and a tough elven Ranger (Kristen Wilson), they set off to follow the map, knowing that the only way they can stay alive--to say nothing of aiding the Empress--is to beat Damodar and Profion to their goal.  I thought the special effects rather good--especially the climactic battle between the gold and red dragons--and the costumes and scenery particularly nicely done.  In addition, Ridley and Snails' friendship is a core part of the story and supplies some of the funniest and most affecting scenes.  Of course this isn't D&D as TSR imaged it--maybe TSR should try filming their own game! (after all, they know it better than anyone else does)--but as a fantasy-adventure I found that it succeeded on its own terms.",4,"It may not be the real D&D, but it's fun fantasy just the same",1299801600,"03 11, 2011",2011,1910,"['Most', 'reviewers', 'do', ""n't"", 'seen', 'like', 'movie', 'found', 'interesting', 'suspenseful', 'say', 'nothing', 'well', 'supplied', 'perils', 'magic', 'good', 'vivid', 'background', 'new', 'young', 'Empress', 'Savina', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'idealism', 'youth', 'resolved', 'make', 'things', 'better', '*all*', 'people', 'not', 'just', 'nobility', 'mages', 'who', 'make', 'up', 'Council', 'Profion', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'powerful', 'mage', 'who', 'been', 'trying', 'gain', 'control', 'gold', 'dragons', 'something', 'confined', 'so', 'far', 'Savina', 'virtue', 'scepter', 'parliamentary', 'revolt', 'Two', 'young', 'thieves', 'Ridley', 'Freeborn', 'Justin', 'Whalin', 'best', 'friend', 'Snails', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'are', 'attempting', 'burgle', 'mages', 'stronghold', 'when', ""'re"", 'discovered', 'Marina', 'Pretensa', 'Zoe', 'McLellan', 'young', 'apprentice', 'mage', 'librarian', 'who', 'just', 'come', 'possession', 'map', 'way', 'artifact', 'may', 'be', 'critical', 'Savina', 'cause', 'problem', 'Profion', 'too', 'when', 'Damodar', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'enforcer', 'seize', 'three', 'young', 'people', 'find', 'run', 'up', 'necks', 'affairs', 'control', 'Allying', 'dwarf', 'Lee', 'Arenberg', 'tough', 'elven', 'Ranger', 'Kristen', 'Wilson', 'set', 'off', 'follow', 'map', 'knowing', 'only', 'way', 'can', 'stay', 'alive', 'say', 'nothing', 'aiding', 'Empress', 'beat', 'Damodar', 'Profion', 'goal', 'thought', 'special', 'effects', 'rather', 'good', 'especially', 'climactic', 'battle', 'gold', 'red', 'dragons', 'costumes', 'scenery', 'particularly', 'nicely', 'done', 'addition', 'Ridley', 'Snails', 'friendship', 'core', 'part', 'story', 'supplies', 'funniest', 'most', 'affecting', 'scenes', 'course', ""n't"", 'D', 'D', 'TSR', 'imaged', 'maybe', 'TSR', 'should', 'try', 'filming', 'own', 'game', 'know', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'fantasy-adventure', 'found', 'succeeded', 'own', 'terms']",Dungeons & Dragons

The D&D; franchise had tons of film-wise interest in the 80s but the producers never accepted and then people stopped asking.The director Courtney Soloman raised the money for this film all by himself which is pretty amazing considering the effects and rights to D&D.;The story had a good chance but it needs a serious injection of fast-paced filming and epic style camera work. These things would have improved the film. This and a little more seriousness from wayan's character mixed with a different ending (maybe the main character being knighted or something.)But after going all out on the production and character design they decided to play it subtle. This film would have been better not subtle in the emotion of the story department.The empire is in flux. The new empress wants equality for her people. But the scheming wizard (jeremy irons) wants to rule and so devises a plan to depose her and crush the empire under his boot.Enter Ridley and Snails, two thieves just trying to get by in a city where those without magic are little more than servants. They decide to rob the magic school and get their big score, but when Jeremy Irons makes his move the two thieves, a young soceress and a disgruntled dwarf get caught up in the race to find a magic rod for the empress with dark soldiers on your heels or lose life and limp in the coup de'tat.This film was expected to be better but if you don't take the possible ideas on board and just watch the film it is actually not a half bad movie.Lets face it, after the build up, everyone would be going in ready to launch critisisms at this but rather than get an epic, they got a normal film and it shocked the life out of them.Its worth a look.

Attempting to make an epic story through the inclusion of the powerful dragons, the plot quickly devolved into nonsense.

His bumbling sidekick, played comedically by Marlon Wayans, is enjoyable but dies all too soon to suit mood of the movie.

Irons, an otherwise good actor, is an overactor in this film.  Thora Birch, who gave a great performance in American Beauty, is slow, almost as if she was reading while acting.  Actually, everyone thought that Wayans was going to be in his worst, most unbearable performance of his life (aside from Scary Movie), was the best one in this movie.  He was funny, and somehow was the one that made this movie bearable until he dies later in the movie [sorry for the spoiler, but anyway, you're better off watching this film when it gets to TV].  Zoe McLellan, a beautiful actress, doesn't really shine in this movie (could've been given a better script).  The acting in the movie is so bad that when Wayans dies, my friends and I all laughed after the ridiculous reaction from the movie's hero.As for the story itself, it has a good main plot, telling the story of good vs evil in a way only fantasy movies can.  People who have played the games before (I have played only the computer versions) will recognize various elements in the movie, from spells, monsters, and people to items and dragons.  Those who complain about the movie not being accurate to the game should remember that if it had been so faithful to the game, they may have had ended up with a Super Mario Bros. movie or a Street Fighter.To summarize, please, do not buy this movie.  For the morbidly curious, or if you don't care that much about acting, rent it.  Otherwise, wait for it to come to TV.

The dialogue was just horrible... truly horrendous... it was worse than Titanic's dialogue.  The acting was atrocious  with the only bright spots being Richard O'Brien (Rocky Horror's Riff Raff) and Tom Baker (Dr. Who).  Marlon Wayans put in a truly offensive performance of a Stepin Fetchit kind.  The main highlight was the Thieves' Guild maze sequence with the anti-Indiana Jones ending.  That was a nice touch, but the rest of the movie was pretty awful.  Thora Birch was particularly terrible with a performance that looked like she slept through.  I must admit it was amusing to watch Jeremy Irons, a great actor, suffer through such poor material, though.I give this movie two stars, rather than one, because it might prove useful to make fun of with some friends, but if you have fond memories of playing D&D; back in junior high school like I do, then this movie will disappoint.

Dragonlance?  Spelljammer maybe?  But no, the movie was set in an original world, apparently unrelated to the published settings the gamers are most familar with.  ""That's not so bad"" I thought, ""A lot of original campaigns are very imaginative and compelling.""  Unfortunately, this movie was neither.The low points of this movie have been repeated again and again by other reviewers, but I echo them as valid.  The characterization was abominable.  Birch's empress was screechy and pouty, hardly giving the impression of a strong ruler with revolutionary ideas.  Irons' villian was embarrassingly hammy.  The dwarf is so poorly characterized he doesn't even seem to have a name, he is simply known as ""the dwarf.""  The worst perfomance, however, was handed in by Wayans.  His cowardly, incompetent ""comic relef"" harkened back to the African-American stereotypes featured in movies from the 30's and 40's.  All he needed to say was ""yassa"" or ""feets don't fail me now."" to complete the picture.The worst thing about this movie, however, was how the writers gave a token nod to the game without capturing any of its depth or details.  Fans of the game are supposed to recognize the beholder in one scene which is employed as a watchdog (and an incompetent one at that).  An audience member who would recognize a beholder, however, would also realize how ridiculous it is for one to occupy that role!  Likewise the dragons are basically an effect on the screen.  We are given no hint that dragons posses personalities, intelligence or any sense of granduer.  The movie basically treats them as flying war machines.I could go on and on about the movies' difficiencies, including the sloppy editing and the plot which perfectly fails to draw the viewers in, but that would be belaboring the point.  Suffice it to say that this movie is best forgotten, except by those who are convinced that D&D; is a tool of Satan.

A Solinas ""ea_solinas""","[2, 2]","Take every cliche in the world of high fantasy, shove it in a blender with paper-doll characters and an incoherent plot, and add the most obnoxiously annoying sidekick who never said ""meesa"" and ""yousa.""Yeah, this is one of THOSE movies, the movies that everyone says is one of the worst ever made, but you never quite believe it until you force yourself to sit through it. ""Dungeons and Dragons"" has more ham than a pig farm, ridiculously poor acting and more cliches than you can count (oh look, distracting the guards by throwing a rock!).The evil mage Profion (Jeremy Irons) wants to overthrow the pure-hearted Empress (Thora Birch), and her only chance is to get the Rod of Savrille (it's French?) which controls red dragons. But the only scroll showing where the Rod is has fallen into the hands of a prissy young mage named Marina ((Zoe McLellan) and a couple of pathetic thieves, Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans).For some reason, they end up chasing after a mystical ruby that... is somehow connected to the rod, although I must have missed that part. They're also joined by a snooty elf in a metal cone bra and a sloppy dwarf, and being chased by Profion's evil blue-lipped minion, and must find the Rod first otherwise magic/the world will be destroyed, blah blah blah.Pretty much every aspect of this movie seems as if it was dreamed up by a ten-year-old boy coming off an RPG bender, with a heavy dose of ""Star Wars"" as well.  But no, it was director/producer Courtney Solomon, who apparently was trying to make this movie as over-the-top and ridiculous as possible. Even worse: it's played straight.So what does it have? Leaden direction, silly action scenes (how many times can Marina club someone with a torch?!), goofy CGI, silly costumes (shoulderpads of DOOM!) and a story that meanders along with random side-trips (Ridley has to run through a ridiculously easy maze). And the editing is so choppy that the characters seem to be teleporting.And the script... dear Lord, the script. I want to set my own brain on fire when I hear the Empress' ""rousing"" speech to the Council. The dialogue from the villains is even worse: ""Give me what is mine!"" ""NEEEVVEEEERRRRR!"" ""You're as stubborn as your friend!""And this movie contains two kinds of acting: wooden and hammy. There is no in-between, although a few actors (Kristen Wilson) actually manage to be both. Jeremy Irons (who needed this job for home renovations) apparently realizes that all hope is lost in the first scene, so he starts chewing scenery like a rabid wolverine. He's actually kind of fun to watch.Sadly, nobody else is. Whalin is embarrassingly hammy as a bratty, self-absorbed thief, McLellan is actually fairly likable as a prissy mage, and Birch stands around in glittery costumes and talks in a bland monotone (in one scene, her eyes actually flick upwards as if she's thinking, ""How long until I get paid?""). Robert Miano also has a brief but hilarious role as a mage with a thick Bronx accent (""Do ya undastand the consequences of ya actions?"").But Snails... oh man, Marlon Wayans will make you want to dig your brain out with a poniard. His character is annoying, screechy, whiny and borderline racist, and actually manages to be MORE annoying than Jar Jar Binks. Even the writers seem to have gotten tired of him.""Dungeons and Dragons"" will drain your will to live with ghastly writing, acting, and direction.

532869,ARNEUO7BF3J55,B00003CXQM,E. David Swan,"[0, 0]","Dungeons and Dragons is the kind of theatrical release that you just cannot believe could make so many mistakes. The word that kept going through my head the entire time was Why. Why would Jeremy Irons, an accomplished actor, act in such a ridiculous exaggerated manner that it would make Rita Repulsa of Power Rangers wince in embarrassment? Why would the writers try and rip off the mind numbingly boring political backstory The Phantom Menace used one year prior? On that note why would they have Marlon Wayans play a character every bit as annoying as Jar Jar Binks? Why would Zoe McLellan be cast in such an important role when she doesn't even have the acting chops to run around convincingly?Dungeons and Dragons had the unfortunate timing of coming out just 1 years prior to The Fellowship of the Ring, a movie that showed the world how to do fantasy right. Although the two movies were both made by New Line Cinema the differences are profound. The armor and weapons in this movie look like rubber, the green screening is unconvincing and the CGI is just horrific. When I think of D&D; one of the first creatures that pops into my head are Beholders. These are rare, powerful and highly intelligent creatures. In this movie they act more like guard dogs and the CGI is so bad it just makes me wish they hadn't even been included. Fellowship of the Ring had a bigger budget ($93m vs $45m) and a year for advancements in technology  but those excuses simply do not come close to explaining the lightyears of differences in visuals. Plus, Fellowship almost assuredly had a bigger casting budget.The fight choreography is amateurish, the music is bland and forgettable, the storyline plods along and the acting is often terrible.  The producers can't even figure out what their target audience is. D&D; probably peaked in the late 70's and 80's which would put its biggest fans at around 30 years of age when this film came out but the film is clearly aimed towards children. Except that there are moments of gruesome violence and like The Phantom Menace the plot is overly complicated for a child.So is there anything of redeeming quality in this film? Somehow Justin Whalin manages to retain his dignity throughout although I don't think this film helped his career.  Jeremy Irons cartoonish overacting is absolutely mesmerizing and the wizard Profion is a surprisingly competent villain. My favorite, however, was Bruce Payne as Damodar. Although Payne seems to be taking cues from Irons when it comes to overacting, I found myself enjoying the scenes with Damodar. Unfortunately the film continually shoots itself in the foot. Payne gives a decently emotional performance in one scene but he's paired up with Zoe McLellan whose leaden delivery kills any impact. In fact McLellan may be the single worst actress I have ever seen in a theatrical release of this size. She's certainly not terrible to look at but she spends the whole film with her eyes bugging out of her head delivering lines like she's reading them straight from the script.As a usage of the D&D; license this film is a waste. There are a few elements like the Beholders and a Lich and a whole bunch of Dragon's but it feels more like a cheap cash in. The group is rounded out with a Dwarf and Elf but they are so superfluous that their inclusion seems desperate.  They couldn't even bother to make the Dwarf short for God's sake. For me this movie wasn't as painful as say the 1998 Avengers movie or *Ugh* Battlefield Earth which was just a visual and aural nightmare but it could have been so much better. I think there was a kernel of potential but in the end it amounted to very little. I felt more sorry for the film than angry because there is a certain earnestness to it all. I may even watch it again someday if only to see Jeremy Irons give the greatest overacting performance in history.",2,Another Shaming of the D&D License,1377475200,"08 26, 2013",2013,3872,"['Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'kind', 'theatrical', 'release', 'just', 'can', 'not', 'believe', 'could', 'make', 'so', 'many', 'mistakes', 'word', 'kept', 'going', 'head', 'entire', 'time', 'was', 'Why', 'Why', 'would', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'accomplished', 'actor', 'act', 'such', 'ridiculous', 'exaggerated', 'manner', 'would', 'make', 'Rita', 'Repulsa', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'wince', 'embarrassment', 'Why', 'would', 'writers', 'try', 'rip', 'mind', 'numbingly', 'boring', 'political', 'backstory', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'used', 'one', 'year', 'prior', 'note', 'why', 'would', 'have', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'play', 'character', 'bit', 'as', 'annoying', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'Why', 'would', 'Zoe', 'McLellan', 'be', 'cast', 'such', 'important', 'role', 'when', ""n't"", 'even', 'have', 'acting', 'chops', 'run', 'around', 'convincingly', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'had', 'unfortunate', 'timing', 'coming', 'out', 'just', '1', 'years', 'prior', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'movie', 'showed', 'world', 'how', 'do', 'fantasy', 'right', 'two', 'movies', 'were', 'made', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'differences', 'are', 'profound', 'armor', 'weapons', 'movie', 'look', 'rubber', 'green', 'screening', 'unconvincing', 'CGI', 'just', 'horrific', 'When', 'think', 'D', 'D', 'one', 'first', 'creatures', 'pops', 'head', 'are', 'Beholders', 'are', 'rare', 'powerful', 'highly', 'intelligent', 'creatures', 'movie', 'act', 'more', 'like', 'guard', 'dogs', 'CGI', 'so', 'bad', 'just', 'wish', 'had', ""n't"", 'even', 'been', 'included', 'Fellowship', 'Ring', 'had', 'bigger', 'budget', '93m', 'vs', '45m', 'year', 'advancements', 'technology', 'excuses', 'simply', 'do', 'not', 'come', 'close', 'explaining', 'lightyears', 'differences', 'visuals', 'Fellowship', 'almost', 'assuredly', 'had', 'bigger', 'casting', 'budget.The', 'fight', 'choreography', 'amateurish', 'music', 'bland', 'forgettable', 'storyline', 'plods', 'acting', 'often', 'terrible', 'producers', 'ca', ""n't"", 'even', 'figure', 'out', 'what', 'target', 'audience', 'D', 'D', 'probably', 'peaked', 'late', '70', '80', 'would', 'put', 'biggest', 'fans', '30', 'years', 'age', 'when', 'film', 'came', 'out', 'film', 'clearly', 'aimed', 'towards', 'children', 'are', 'moments', 'gruesome', 'violence', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'plot', 'overly', 'complicated', 'child.So', 'there', 'anything', 'redeeming', 'quality', 'film', 'Somehow', 'Justin', 'Whalin', 'retain', 'dignity', 'do', ""n't"", 'think', 'film', 'helped', 'career', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'cartoonish', 'overacting', 'absolutely', 'mesmerizing', 'wizard', 'Profion', 'surprisingly', 'competent', 'villain', 'My', 'favorite', 'however', 'was', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'Damodar', 'Payne', 'be', 'taking', 'cues', 'Irons', 'when', 'overacting', 'found', 'enjoying', 'scenes', 'Damodar', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'continually', 'shoots', 'foot', 'Payne', 'decently', 'emotional', 'performance', 'one', 'scene', 'paired', 'up', 'Zoe', 'McLellan', 'leaden', 'delivery', 'impact', 'fact', 'McLellan', 'may', 'be', 'single', 'worst', 'actress', 'have', 'ever', 'seen', 'theatrical', 'release', 'size', 'certainly', 'not', 'terrible', 'look', 'whole', 'film', 'eyes', 'bugging', 'head', 'delivering', 'lines', 'reading', 'straight', 'script.As', 'usage', 'D', 'D', 'license', 'film', 'waste', 'are', 'few', 'elements', 'Beholders', 'Lich', 'whole', 'bunch', 'Dragon', 'more', 'cheap', 'cash', 'group', 'rounded', 'out', 'Dwarf', 'Elf', 'are', 'so', 'superfluous', 'inclusion', 'desperate', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'bother', 'make', 'Dwarf', 'short', 'God', 'sake', 'movie', 'was', ""n't"", 'as', 'painful', 'say', '1998', 'Avengers', 'movie', '*Ugh*', 'Battlefield', 'Earth', 'was', 'just', 'visual', 'aural', 'nightmare', 'could', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'think', 'was', 'kernel', 'potential', 'end', 'amounted', 'very', 'little', 'felt', 'more', 'sorry', 'film', 'angry', 'certain', 'earnestness', 'may', 'even', 'watch', 'again', 'someday', 'only', 'see', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'give', 'greatest', 'overacting', 'performance', 'history']",Dungeons & Dragons
532870,A2F89BTWLSEEKF,B00003CXQM,Edward M. Erdelac,"[5, 8]","I'll tell you why I like this movie...this is strictly fun popcorn fare and meant to evoke those late night Saturday sessions of failed seduction rolls and munching down cheesy puffs while alternately guffawing and sweating over the fate of an alter ego who exists only in the mind's eye and on a piece of paper much worn from erasing hit points and changing stats.D&D; the movie is just for fun.  Anybody looking for any deep meaning should look elsewhere.  Yes, it does owe a lot to Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Star Wars.  The main character of Ridley has about two dozen Harrison Ford moments throughout the film.  No its not completely a full immersion in fantasy, but then again neither were most of the D&D; campaigns I played in.  Think of all the moments somebody would crack a joke or toss in a geeky line from a movie while you were playing this game - the filmmaker didn't try to create a fantasy world, he tried to portray the game as it was...a fun night of bickering and mishaps with the occassional monster and bit of melodrama thrown in.There was no way this could please every fan, because each D&D; fan had his own memories.  There were those who loved a lot of magic, and those who liked hack and slash, and those that were straight on roleplaying.  Maybe I only enjoyed this movie because the bumbling but ultimately heroic thief was always the kind of character I liked and played.  Anyways, don't try to see this as anything staggering or high-reaching as Excalibur or (sigh...) Lord Of The Rings, just enjoy it for what it is - there is a good deal to like...The acting is way way over the top - but its fantastic in that regard.  The villains are of the mustache-twiddling egomaniacal comic book variety (particularly Jeremy Irons, who is so wild you can't even understand his evil wizard's ranting sometimes under the roaring of the dragons `Their blood will RAAAAIIINN from the SKIIIESSSS!' reminded me of  `We're gonna RAIIIN on you, Warriors!').  Demadar (sp?) speaks in an exaagerated cold rasp through the whole movie and goes around with a parasite in his head (and when Marlon Wayans mocks him late in the film its pretty funny)!  Marlon Wayans plays his typical scared brutha (a role he seems to have been born to play), and the guy who played Rosie The Eternal Flame in Freaked as the dwarf plays it to the hilt, gobbling turkey legs and in one hilarious scene (one of my favorites) stares at the camera and says `That's no way to do business. Mmmmm.'  And rolls his eyes.  Thora Birch is appealing as the mage if not particulalry memorable, and the elven chick is purdy, as she is meant to be.  These are archetypes from a game system, not really living characters with pasts of their own - they are the beautiful but aloof Elven Ranger, the crass and surly Dwarf Fighter, the likable but selfish Thief, etc...and no game of D&D; is complete without them.The production design ain't too bad - obviously it reflects the look of the new 3rd Edition rulebook, with elements that don't really belong in any time period.  But the golden coin-mail of the empress at the end makes her look stunning, and the other costumes (particularly in the Thieves' Guild scene) look cool as well.  Even the props are great - the Red Dragon Control Rod in particular, and did you notice that cool Michaelangelo-like mural of the mage using the Rod as he observes from a cloud?  I wonder where that painting is now...The FX - not nearly as overblown as you might expect.  This director went to the Star Wars school sure, but it was the original trilogy, not the new garbage.  We don't linger or drool over CGI fluff for too long (like we do in some other recent fantasy movies I could mention).  We get nicely detailed establishing shots to give us a sense of place, and a big dragon battle at the end, which I think comes off rather well - the best since Dragonslayer - and not nearly as bad as Dragonheart.  Yeah, the Beholder is floating around in broad daylight - but so what?  Its a Beholder!  Highlights:  The Thieves' Guild Maze, The Dragon Fight at the end, Ridley and Snails breaking into the Mage Tower and getting caught.The story - not nearly as terrible as some would have you believe.  Its linear, it makes sense most of the time, and its no frills. If there are flaws, they are the fault of market-minded producers who changed the director's original vision (as in most movies).  If you watch the extra material interview, you can tell his heart was in the right place when he did this.  As for the very ending, no it doesn't make a lot of sense - unless you consider this....D&D; is a game.  This movie is based on a game.  Therefore it could be surmised that the characters are all people playing a game (that's why the three main characters are so young).  When the one character who died has his name disappear from his tombstone, and when we are told `Your friend waits for you' and they are all spirited away in a flutter of pixie dust, I like to think that its because the night is over.  The game is ended for now (its nearly dawn).  Yes, your friend is waiting for you.  He died early on in the night, so he made a food run and is now back with pizza and is waiting in the real world.  Thus `we'll stop here' and go eat and talk about the night's adventures and what's next, and probably a little of real life too.  If you look at it that way, this movie's not so bad.My eleven year old son and I watch this movie and have a ball - even he knows when the actors are too much, and we laugh about it.  The dragon fight is awesome, the swordplay exciting, Marlon Wayans is funny, and the rest of the cast is passable and good looking.  A good family movie and a light bit of fun.",3,"Not That Bad, and Great Family Fare",1051056000,"04 23, 2003",2003,5714,"[""'ll"", 'tell', 'why', 'like', 'movie', 'strictly', 'fun', 'popcorn', 'fare',

The acting deserves an award, the kind given to the most promising high-school thespian in a small town. Lines are repeated and expressions are worn, but it's not enough.Fortunately, this is an action flick. Acting is secondary. There are enough melee scenes for any pubescent lad to get his testosterone blazing. Plenty of choreographed fight scenes &amp; clever effects. Stop action animation is better than we saw in 50's B movies. But, an important point was overlooked--everything in the movie is new. Clothes are clean, just off the costumers' sewing machines.Let's not forget the villain, Profien. Not at all convincing, more of a geek. Banal, not convincingly evil. This, then, is perhaps the most real part of the movie. True evil rarely wears horns &amp; carries a pitchfork. On the other hand, if you see a bald guy with blue lips &amp; an attitude ... Run!I wouldn't let a child less than 8 or 9 watch this movie, and nobody that young without an adult in the room. There are some intense scenes which a younger child could find disturbing. Unfortunately, most people old enough not to be disturbed will be old enough to be bored.Pretty much a two star movie all around.

I just rented it yesterday-seeing that I had a free rental coupon- and saw it that night.  From the very start you could tell that this movie is going to be-what's the word?-corny.  They could of made it better if they improved on the acting and it could have been better if they lost the cheesiness of the movie and possibly loose the jokes/humor and instead made it serious.  On the other hand, the scenery was good but I thought they could've shown more of it.  Unlike many of the viewers I am not familiar with the Dungeons and Dragons game, but I did hear someone say that the way they potrayed it was all wrong and is really a serious game rather than the childish(?) humor of Snails ect. in the movie.  In fact I didn't even know their was going to be a sequel until the end.  I wonder how that will do?  Maybe they are working to improve it??

So instead, I'm giving you the complete list of things I noticed while watching the movie. Enjoy!The basic storyline is this (sorry if it's hard to understand, but the runes that I'm translating from are a little hard to read): There's this evil guy named Profen (as in Ibuprofen) that exaggerates EVERY scene that he's in, flapping his hands around like some amateur actor. I'm not exaggerating. To show how evil he his, he sets loose this dragon. But the dragon, sensing how stupid this guy is, ignores his commands. Appalled by the dragon's disrespect, Profen kills the dragon in a scene that looks very reminiscent of the Rancor scene in Return of the Jedi.Back in the town, there are two guys, our two heroes. Well, actually, there's only one hero, the other is ""comic-relief"" ala Jar Jar Binks style. In short, the ""comic relief"" is VERY annoying.The two main characters decide to break into the magic guild's tower. Now that sounds like something Robert E. Howard's Conan would do, right? But our two main characters don't handle it as well as Conan would have. In fact, they end up meeting a feisty mage (magette, magess, whatever) that reminds one of Princess Leia. The main character acts like Luke in some parts of  the movie and cocky like Han Solo in others. He acts like Han Solo in this part, where they get confronted by a guy with a liking for blue lipstick and a claw that looks a lot like Predator's. Actually, Mr. Blue Lips was an ex-band member of KISS.They (the good guys) fight, they get away, they go to this village where there is this bar scene (Oh, that looks like that scene in Star Wars!) and they meet this weird guy with a purple head that looks kinda sorta like the Elephant Man.Then they meet this elf that looks like Michael Jackson.There's an Empire and a Senate.A place where the Senate meets that looks like the setting for The Muppet Show.The Phantom Menace introduced Princess Amidala. Well, this movie introduces her sister, Princess what's-her-face, and yes, her costume does change with every scene, and each time she changes her outfits get more and more ridiculous.I was about to bet that Prince was going to have his own little role.I was also about to bet that Mr. Blue Lips (who ALWAYS whispers) was going to say at some point, ""I see dead people.""There are multiple scenes that reek of the Indiana Jones trilogy. Going through gauntlets, stepping on the right stones at the right time (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade). Scampering over bare floor, trying to get an ancient relic, spiked ceilings coming down (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom). And finally, to complete the trilogy, standing in front of a ruby, legs straddled-like, scratching the chin (Raiders of the Lost Ark). Yeah, I'd say that the makers of this movie raided a lot from other popular movies, as if they were thinking ""Hey, if we borrow all the cool parts from other cool movies, then our movie will be cool!""Other Irks:The funeral for Annoying as Jar Jar Binks-nuf said.The ""grand finale"" is  a big flop.And, finally, the fact that they force you to play this stupid puzzle game in the DVD edition, just so you can watch the deleted scenes.Well, give or take a little black magic, that's what's in this movie . . . .NOW WHAT ABOUT MY HEAD!",1,NOW WHAT ABOUT MY HEAD?,1030147200,"08 24, 2002",2002,3413,"['Most', 'seem', 'agree', 'movie', 'fun', 'poke', 'fun', 'when', 'movie', 'bad', 'really', 'hard', 'write', 'serious', 'review', 'So', 'instead', ""'m"", 'giving', 'complete', 'list', 'things', 'noticed', 'watching', 'movie', 'Enjoy', 'basic', 'storyline', 'sorry', 'hard', 'understand', 'runes', ""'m"", 'translating', 'are', 'little', 'hard', 'read', 'evil', 'guy', 'named', 'Profen', 'Ibuprofen', 'EVERY', 'scene', 'flapping', 'hands', 'amateur', 'actor', ""'m"", 'not', 'exaggerating', 'show', 'how', 'evil', 'loose', 'dragon', 'dragon', 'sensing', 'how', 'stupid', 'guy', 'commands', 'Appalled', 'dragon', 'disrespect', 'Profen', 'dragon', 'scene', 'very', 'reminiscent', 'Rancor', 'scene', 'Return', 'Jedi.Back', 'town', 'are', 'two', 'guys', 'two', 'heroes', 'Well', 'actually', 'only', 'one', 'hero', 'other', 'comic-relief', 'ala', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks', 'style', 'short', 'comic', 'relief', 'VERY', 'annoying.The', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'decide', 'break', 'magic', 'guild', 'tower', 'Now', 'sounds', 'something', 'Robert', 'E.', 'Howard', 'Conan', 'would', 'do', 'right', 'two', 'main', 'characters', 'do', ""n't"", 'handle', 'as', 'well', 'Conan', 'would', 'have', 'fact', 'end', 'up', 'meeting', 'feisty', 'mage', 'magette', 'magess', 'one', 'Princess', 'Leia', 'main', 'character', 'acts', 'Luke', 'parts', 'movie', 'cocky', 'Han', 'Solo', 'others', 'Han', 'Solo', 'part', 'where', 'get', 'confronted', 'guy', 'liking', 'blue', 'lipstick', 'claw', 'lot', 'Predator', 'Actually', 'Mr.', 'Blue', 'Lips', 'was', 'ex-band', 'member', 'KISS.They', 'good', 'guys', 'fight', 'get', 'away', 'go', 'village', 'where', 'bar', 'scene', 'Oh', 'scene', 'Star', 'Wars', 'meet', 'weird', 'guy', 'purple', 'head', 'kinda', 'sorta', 'Elephant', 'Man.Then', 'meet', 'elf', 'Michael', 'Jackson.There', 'Empire', 'Senate.A', 'place', 'where', 'Senate', 'meets', 'setting', 'Muppet', 'Show.The', 'Phantom', 'Menace', 'introduced', 'Princess', 'Amidala', 'Well', 'movie', 'sister', 'Princess', ""what's-her-face"", 'yes', 'costume', 'change', 'scene', 'time', 'get', 'more', 'more', 'ridiculous.I', 'was', 'bet', 'Prince', 'was', 'going', 'have', 'own', 'little', 'role.I', 'was', 'also', 'about', 'bet', 'Mr.', 'Blue', 'Lips', 'who', 'ALWAYS', 'whispers', 'was', 'going', 'say', 'point', 'see', 'dead', 'people', 'are', 'multiple', 'scenes', 'reek', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'trilogy', 'Going', 'gauntlets', 'stepping', 'right', 'stones', 'right', 'time', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Last', 'Crusade', 'Scampering', 'bare', 'floor', 'trying', 'get', 'ancient', 'relic', 'spiked', 'ceilings', 'coming', 'down', 'Indiana', 'Jones', 'Temple', 'Doom', 'finally', 'complete', 'trilogy', 'standing', 'front', 'ruby', 'legs', 'straddled-like', 'scratching', 'chin', 'Raiders', 'Lost', 'Ark', 'Yeah', ""'d"", 'say', 'makers', 'movie', 'raided', 'lot', 'other', 'popular', 'movies', 'were', 'thinking', 'Hey', 'borrow', 'cool', 'parts', 'other', 'cool', 'movies', 'then', 'movie', 'will', 'be', 'cool', 'Other', 'Irks', 'funeral', 'Annoying', 'Jar', 'Jar', 'Binks-nuf', 'said.The', 'grand', 'finale', 'big', 'flop.And', 'finally', 'fact', 'force', 'play', 'stupid', 'puzzle', 'game', 'DVD', 'edition', 'just', 'can', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes.Well', 'give', 'take', 'little', 'black', 'magic', 'what', 'movie', '.NOW', 'WHAT', 'MY', 'HEAD']",Dungeons & Dragons

I really hoped the film would bring some legitimacy to the hobby in the eyes of the general public.  But what Courtney Solomon has produced here is a festering heap of bad storylines and poor acting.All you need to do is watch the extras on the DVD to see just how incompetent Mr Solomon is.  A hardcore gamer himself, Courtney explains his vision for the movie.  To produce a story that was appealing and satisfying for gamers and non-gamers alike.  Sure he might get an E for effort and passion but as the writer and director of this tripe Courtney Solomon has failed miserably.Firstly lets look at the story.  Now fantasy stories are generally among some of the richest in fiction.  From the Lord of the Rings, to Anne McCaffrey's work to D&amp;D spin offs like Dragon Lance and the Forgotten Realms, fantasy books are always full of rich settings and compelling characters. So why did a novice screenwriter like Solomon decide to try his hand at writing the screenplay?  Surely an adaptation of Weis &amp; Hickman's Dragon Lance Chronicles, Douglas Niles Moonshae Trilogy or R.A. Salvatore's Icewind Dale Trilogy would have offered great settings and characters that are already established.  An adaptation of anyone of these series would also have guaranteed a flow on audience that were familiar with the novels but may have never actually played the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game.Recent successes like Blade, X-Men and Spiderman have shown that comics and fantasy stories can be turned into great movies with the right script and cast.  Failures like Gor, the Punisher and Captain America show just how bad these tales can be when you get the ingredients wrong.  Solomon's Dungeons and Dragons definitely falls into the later category.  The script only serves to alienate both the general public and the existing D&amp;D fanbase by throwing is into a confusing setting full of shallow characters.And the acting! Good God! The two stars with top billing, Thora Birch and Jeremy Irons, obviously don't want to be there.  Birch's performance is stunningly bland and average while Irons over acts and stinks it up at every available opportunity.  Justin Whalin is completely disposable, a store mannequin would have done a better job.  Marlon Wayans is ludicrous in his comedic side role as Snails.Although some of the effects, like the dragon dogfight, are interesting they are not enough to save the movie.  Some of the effects like the Beholders are completely superfluous and do nothing to advance the story or characters.Don't get me wrong I really tried to defend this movie to my friends before and after it's release, both as a half decent flick and then as a fun piece of B-Grade Schlock like Gor or Hawk: The Slayer.

I saw it once on a date at the cinema (she liked it), and a couple of times on video/dvd when I was trying to show just how horrible it was to friends. It is a film that gets worse with every viewing. There is always something new to be appalled by every time you watch it.Do not own this movie, it will infect other movies you own with its badness. Even milk will go off in close proximity to this drek. If (like me) you are a completist and have to see it ""just to see what they did"", borrow it or hire it (but then complain that the disc wouldn't play on your machine so that you can exchange it for something else).This movie commits the cardinal sin of being boring. It has a clunky script, questionable costume choices and as an adaptation of D&D;, unforgivable. I know nothing about how to light a movie set, so when I notice that a scene has no atmosphere, there's something wrong.The cast could or might be OK in other circumstances, but with rubbish lines and a bad director, are left to flounder. I don't think I've seen Thora Birch since. Jeremy Irons, rather than flounder, clearly went insane for the duration of this shoot. His performance is, ahhh... colourful. Olivier's Richard the Third on crack? X 1000?The extras of this give a fairly good picture of why this film stinks. Yes, I watched them. The director's mummy bought him the director's chair, and he clearly shouldn't be trusted with sharp objects, let alone Jeremy Irons. Although the director professes a love of D&D;, he clearly was never a dungeon master or ever read a fantasy book. And therein lies the problem with basing a film on D&D; the game is based on any number of sources and worlds, so what do you choose?And where were the monsters? D&D; if its about anything, is about the monsters! OK we had some 2nd drawer CGI dragons (they're a given), and a beholder very shyly ran across screen in one scene, but what about the rest?!

I put off watching it for so long for this reason, but it was enjoyable enough.Comparisons to the LOTR trilogy are inevitable, so I'm not going to avoid it. I didn't really like the LOTR trilogy. It just seemed to be a bunch of movies that everyone was forced to like and if you didn't then there must be something wrong with you. Yes, they are much, much better made than the rather quaint D&D;, but if you want a smaller, unassuming fantasy ride then don't completely rule this movie out.The visual effects and production design of D&D; are very similar to Paul Anderson's Mortal Kombat. Yes, it looks fake, but with just a little bit of suspension of disbelief you'll not even notice. I have a feeling that Courtney Solomon tried really hard to make it a good film but his talent doesn't extend as far as his enthusiasm.In terms of character and story it is all pretty bland and generic. There's nothing in this movie that you haven't seen somewhere else. The actors do their best with the tepid dialogue and almost manage to not look embarrassed. The best thing about the film is it's surprisingly ferocious (maybe a bit too OTT) sound design. And the Dragon fight at the end was impressive for a medium budget film.I was actually surprised to find Joel Silver's name on the closing credits. I will assume that without him the film would have been a REAL stinker.

Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans displayed relatively good acting (at least they were cast in the right parts). The dragons were fun to watch. And the costumes were good. The downsides are that the plot was undeveloped. The characters could have been better. With the exception of a few parts, the dialogue was really bad, and as a budding writer myself, I know what I'm saying. And Thora Birch. She looks her part, but after I listen to her say her lines (or speeches), I begin to think that she must talk very quickly in real life and the director was trying to get her to slow down and inunciate. She was too obviously trying to speak clearer than normal, when in my mind an actor really should strive to at least sound like themself, unless they are faking an accent. Also, when she wasn't yelling at the pace of a snail, she was talking quietly but sounding like she was whining. I like her work in other films, but there are better suited actresses for her part. Two and a half stars for this film. Rent before buying.Might be a disappointment for die hard fantasy fans, but not for die hard dragon fans :) Oh one more thing: Maybe some others didn't feel the same, but I actually thought that this movie would be about the game, as in people playing the game.

The moive itself has some redeeming value by the fact that Doctor Who veteran Tom Baker makes a cameo as an ancient elf who heals the main hero.

Anyways, although I don't enjoy the paper and pencil game, I was looking forward to Dungeons and Dragons hoping for a good solid fantasy movie to let my imagination run wild, well, unfortunately that wasn't exactly what I got.In the Empire of Izmer existed two social classes, the rich and powerful mages who rule on high and the poor lowly commoners that cannot wield magic.  The child empress Savina believes in her soul that everyone should live equally, but the council of mages fearing the changes that is coming with her reign, manipulated by the evil archmage Profion who wishes to control the power to summon the gold dragons, decided to order the empress to step down and give up her scepter.  A mixed group of adventurers were then recruited by the empress to find the Rod of Savrille, it has been told that this Rod will enable its holder to control red dragons, to help her expose Profion's cheme and trachery.Well, D&amp;D definitely had a lot of special effects, most of it were pretty good, but you realize a lot of them are cheap and not convicing looking at all, fortunately it wasn't often enough to ruin the experience.  The acting is a bit lacking, Jeremy Irons as the evil Profion was a little too intense that borderlines ridiculous.  Marlon Wayans provided the comedy relief as the thieve Snails, he managed to be funny without being overly annoying.  Thora Birch portrayed the Empress Savina, she did a good job with the little screen time she had.Well, the bottom line is to keep your expectations low, I can't speak for those hardcore D&amp;D gamers, but as a casual movie-goer this wasn't a bad time spent in the theater, I recommend going to the matinee show and be glad you saved a few dollars for next winter's Lord of the Rings.",3,A fairly good film for the average movie-goers,976233600,"12 8, 2000",2000,1881,"['like', 'playing', 'RPG', 'D', 'amp', 'D', ""n't"", 'really', 'cup', 'tea', 'can', 'say', ""'m"", 'not', 'biased', 'when', 'writing', 'review', 'Anyways', 'do', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'paper', 'pencil', 'game', 'was', 'looking', 'forward', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'hoping', 'good', 'solid', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'let', 'imagination', 'run', 'wild', 'well', 'unfortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'what', 'got.In', 'Empire', 'Izmer', 'existed', 'two', 'social', 'classes', 'rich', 'powerful', 'mages', 'who', 'rule', 'high', 'poor', 'lowly', 'commoners', 'can', 'not', 'wield', 'magic', 'child', 'empress', 'Savina', 'soul', 'everyone', 'should', 'live', 'equally', 'council', 'mages', 'fearing', 'changes', 'coming', 'reign', 'manipulated', 'evil', 'archmage', 'Profion', 'who', 'control', 'power', 'summon', 'gold', 'dragons', 'decided', 'order', 'empress', 'step', 'down', 'give', 'up', 'scepter', 'mixed', 'group', 'adventurers', 'were', 'then', 'recruited', 'empress', 'find', 'Rod', 'Savrille', 'been', 'told', 'Rod', 'will', 'enable', 'holder', 'control', 'red', 'dragons', 'help', 'expose', 'Profion', 'cheme', 'trachery.Well', 'D', 'amp', 'D', 'definitely', 'had', 'lot', 'special', 'effects', 'most', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'realize', 'lot', 'are', 'cheap', 'not', 'convicing', 'looking', 'fortunately', 'was', ""n't"", 'often', 'enough', 'ruin', 'experience', 'acting', 'bit', 'lacking', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'evil', 'Profion', 'was', 'little', 'too', 'intense', 'ridiculous', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'provided', 'comedy', 'relief', 'thieve', 'Snails', 'managed', 'be', 'funny', 'being', 'overly', 'annoying', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'portrayed', 'Empress', 'Savina', 'did', 'good', 'job', 'little', 'screen', 'time', 'had.Well', 'bottom', 'line', 'keep', 'expectations', 'low', 'ca', ""n't"", 'speak', 'hardcore', 'D', 'amp', 'D', 'gamers', 'casual', 'movie-goer', 'was', ""n't"", 'bad', 'time', 'spent', 'theater', 'recommend', 'going', 'matinee', 'show', 'be', 'glad', 'saved', 'few', 'dollars', 'next', 'winter', 'Lord', 'Rings']",Dungeons & Dragons

Having very little to do with the games, it's a wonder the producers didn't at least get charged with larceny for this pathetic mishmash of action, drama, comedy, and love story.  How do I hate thee, let me count the ways...First and foremost, the acting in this film is ludicrous.  Thora Birch as Empress Savina is everything Natalie Portman's character in Star Wars isn't.  In other words, just the bad parts.  Like boredom, incompetence, and naivety.  Justin Whalin is Ridley Freeborn, the primary protagonist, and let's just say there's a reason he's best known for his role in Child's Play 3.  Marlon Wayans is his fellow thief named Snails, a cowardly character inserted for comedic support; his presence and performance took black actors back a decade and serve as the reason he's only permitted to do Scary Movie sequels.  With how he helped ruin the GI Joe movie, I have to wonder if he hates a person from the 80s or the entire decade.  Not surprisingly, the best performance is turned in by Jeremy Irons.  All fire and brimstone, his screaming rage is convincingly directed at the opposing characters despite the probability of it actually being directed at his cast-mates.The special effects are more short bus special than anything.  Video game CGI with cartoon dragons and painfully obvious green screen sword fights.  I'm talking choreography sub-par to Mighty Morphin Power Rangers garbage.

As a long-time D&D; gamer and fan of sci-fi and fantasy films alike, I went to this movie hoping for the best but expecting the worst.  Needless to say, my expectations were not disappointed even if my hopes were dashed.First, there's the acting--or lack thereof.  It really says something about a film when Tom Baker of Dr. Who fame delivers the best performance on screen.  Jeremy Irons should have his Oscar revoked as his is by far the worst performance, with less-than-convincing sneers and bad guy leers.  Justin Whalin isn't terrible, but the Wayans kid--ick.  People in the theater literally CHEERED when he was seemingly rid of and booed at his eventual return.  Not a single character endeared himself or herself to the audience.Then there are the props... for a Hollywood production, one would hope that magical staves, gems, etc. would look fairly realistic, but instead it's clear they are all made of plastic.The film is not set in any recognizable D&D; millieu despite the abundance of interesting settings.  Nor does the magic used conform in any way to the spells familiar to gamers; an apprentice mage casts some kind of dimension door spell left and right simply with her magic dust.  The dragons, presumably the focus of the film, actually appear only anticlimatically, and the ""dungeons"" explored by the main character could be solved by a three year old or even a mildly retarded dog.The special effects are the lone grace of this film, as the dragons are done fairly well, and the magical spells aren't too poorly done, either.The DVD version's special features, which include deleted scenes, are decent.  The alternate ending in particular is of interest; the director apparently thought it ""too depressing"" and mentions a third ending so terrible they even left it off the DVD, yet I think the alternate ending would have at least left audiences with something--if not the groan the theatrical version did, then at least a somewhat shallower scowl.I've yelled at a few films in my day in the theater, but this is the first film that the entire audience joined me.  Please, do yourself a favor and check out all the other fantasy films available before viewing D&D.;  Maybe some day a decent adpation of Dragonlance will be available, but until then, relegate this flick to your ""bad movie night"" pile.",1,The film that almost set fantasy movies back 20 years...,1047427200,"03 12, 2003",2003,2487,"['Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'such', 'poor', 'film', 'nearly', 'set', 'fantasy', 'filmmaking', 'back', 'twenty', 'years', 'thankfully', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'saved', 'field', 'long-time', 'D', 'D', 'gamer', 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'films', 'alike', 'went', 'movie', 'hoping', 'best', 'expecting', 'worst', 'Needless', 'say', 'expectations', 'were', 'not', 'disappointed', 'even', 'hopes', 'were', 'dashed.First', 'acting', 'lack', 'thereof', 'really', 'something', 'film', 'when', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'Dr.', 'Who', 'fame', 'best', 'performance', 'screen', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'should', 'have', 'Oscar', 'revoked', 'far', 'worst', 'performance', 'less-than-convincing', 'sneers', 'bad', 'guy', 'leers', 'Justin', 'Whalin', ""n't"", 'terrible', 'Wayans', 'kid', 'ick', 'People', 'theater', 'literally', 'CHEERED', 'when', 'was', 'seemingly', 'rid', 'booed', 'eventual', 'return', 'Not', 'single', 'character', 'endeared', 'audience.Then', 'are', 'props', 'Hollywood', 'production', 'one', 'would', 'hope', 'magical', 'staves', 'gems', 'etc', 'would', 'look', 'fairly', 'realistic', 'instead', 'clear', 'are', 'made', 'plastic.The', 'film', 'not', 'set', 'recognizable', 'D', 'D', 'abundance', 'interesting', 'settings', 'magic', 'used', 'conform', 'way', 'spells', 'familiar', 'gamers', 'apprentice', 'mage', 'kind', 'dimension', 'door', 'spell', 'left', 'right', 'simply', 'magic', 'dust', 'dragons', 'presumably', 'focus', 'film', 'actually', 'appear', 'only', 'anticlimatically', 'dungeons', 'explored', 'main', 'character', 'could', 'be', 'solved', 'three', 'year', 'old', 'even', 'mildly', 'retarded', 'dog.The', 'special', 'effects', 'are', 'lone', 'grace', 'film', 'dragons', 'are', 'done', 'fairly', 'well', 'magical', 'spells', 'are', ""n't"", 'too', 'poorly', 'done', 'either.The', 'DVD', 'version', 'special', 'features', 'include', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'are', 'decent', 'alternate', 'ending', 'particular', 'interest', 'director', 'apparently', 'thought', 'too', 'depressing', 'third', 'ending', 'so', 'terrible', 'even', 'left', 'off', 'DVD', 'yet', 'think', 'alternate', 'ending', 'would', 'have', 'least', 'left', 'audiences', 'something', 'not', 'groan', 'theatrical', 'version', 'did', 'then', 'least', 'somewhat', 'shallower', 'scowl.I', ""'ve"", 'yelled', 'few', 'films', 'day', 'theater', 'first', 'film', 'entire', 'audience', 'joined', 'Please', 'do', 'favor', 'check', 'out', 'other', 'fantasy', 'films', 'available', 'viewing', 'D', 'D', 'Maybe', 'day', 'decent', 'adpation', 'Dragonlance', 'will', 'be', 'available', 'then', 'relegate', 'flick', 'bad', 'movie', 'night', 'pile']",Dungeons & Dragons

Let's face it, Dungeon and Dragons was loosely based on Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. If they can made a decent movie out of Tolkien's trilogy, there is no reason why they could not have made a good Dungeon and Dragons movie. And this movie is far from good. Perhaps it will be one of those movies which is so bad that it became good and will achieve cult status.Well, history will take care of THAT. But it cannot change the fact that for all the hoopla and publicity surronding this movie, it was all ado about nothing.Let's say that when this movie ended, I was pratically running out of the theater covering my face, ashamed of being seen watching this wreck.And how bad is this wreck? The moment the movie started and you heard a voice over telling you what the movie is going to be about, you know you are in trouble.The first scene immediately set alarm bells in my head that this is going to be one stinker of a stinking cloud spell. When you see that the extras can't even turn a wheel convincingly....uh oh. Jeremy Iron's epileptic fits of overacting and Bruce Payne's blue lipstick doesn't exactly help things. Thora Birch who has proven herself a good actress all of a sudden seem to have forgotten how to act. Most of the cast were also saddled with really inane dialogues. The best example....the debate in front of the mage council between Irons and Birch.The story itself need a lot to be desire. Considering the wealth of material and story plots already written in the various Dungeons and Dragons novel based on well established worlds like Faeraun and Greyhawk....all we got is Empress Savina attempting to grant equal status to non mage citizens??? Have Lolth the Spider Queen trying to take over the world and have the Empress sent a squadron of heros to oppose her....ANYTHING!The only member of the cast who came off well was Zoe McClellan....but even she have more than her fair share of bad moments.The special effects are adequate...but when it came to the monsters...such as the dragons and Profion's imp, as well as the beholders....I have seen computer games with more convincing details.Considering it is a low budget movie to begin with, I may sound too harsh. But nothing excuse bad acting and bad story telling.Ultimately, Dungeon and Dragons is really a movie that is marginally, if not superficially based on the game.

I'm familiar with only the Saturday morning cartoon and a couple of the books.  Being a fan of sci-fi and fantasy, I was always aware of D&D;, but never pursued any interest any it.  Having said that, I was surprised at how decent this movie really was.  Granted, there are a ton of films that are a lot better than this fantasy flick, but it was a nice way to kill a little time on a Saturday morning.  There were some good and some bad things about this film.  Here's a look at all of them.First of all, the guts of this story were very good.  The tale of two thieves and their cohorts seeking out a powerful sceptor has been told before, but it is played out very well in this movie.  It's plays out at a rather quick pace and never gets boring.  Justin Whalin, Marlon Wayans, and their group are all excellent in this film.  Bruce Payne was also a perfect foil to their plans.  I actually felt a little sorry for his character.The special effects were okay considering the massive amount used in this picture.  They don't take away from the story at all.  The battle of the dragons was done pretty good, though I wish we would have been given a larger dose of the action.It was very nice to see Tom Baker on the screen.  Fans of the BBC series ""Doctor Who"" will remember him as the beloved fourth Doctor.  I'll be honest and say that I didn't recognize him initially, but when I realized who he was, it felt good to see him once again.The movie gets pretty ugly when, unfortunately, Jeremy Irons or Thora Birch enters the frame.  Irons seems to be overacting in an attempt to be the dreaded nemesis he is supposed to be.  It's funny how sometimes Irons can be such a brilliant bad guy, and then stumble his way through a film such as this or ""The Time Machine.""  Birch is completely out of character in this movie.  She is such a good actress in her other films(American Beauty, Ghost World, etc.), but she doesn't seem to be able to grasp the character she is playing.  I would think that such a radical character would have been played with more emotion, or at least some emotion.  The ending is abrupt and uneventful.  Sure, the bad guy gets his in the end, but the ending only serves as a point to quickly shut the movie down.Once again, the real story, the better story, is between Whalin, his friends, and the character portrayed by Bruce Payne.  Had they been the entire focus of the film, it probably would have been much better.Recommended to folks who enjoy fantasy but don't take it too seriously.  In other words, if you play dress-up on days not associated with Halloween or a Renaissance festival, you probably won't like this.",3,Better Than I Expected,1103500800,"12 20, 2004",2004,2731,"['First', 'let', 'say', 'have', 'never', 'played', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'game', ""'m"", 'familiar', 'only', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'cartoon', 'couple', 'books', 'Being', 'fan', 'sci-fi', 'fantasy', 'was', 'always', 'aware', 'D', 'D', 'never', 'pursued', 'interest', 'Having', 'said', 'was', 'surprised', 'how', 'decent', 'movie', 'really', 'was', 'Granted', 'are', 'ton', 'films', 'are', 'lot', 'better', 'fantasy', 'flick', 'was', 'nice', 'way', 'kill', 'little', 'time', 'Saturday', 'morning', 'were', 'good', 'bad', 'things', 'film', 'Here', 'look', 'them.First', 'guts', 'story', 'were', 'very', 'good', 'tale', 'two', 'thieves', 'cohorts', 'seeking', 'out', 'powerful', 'sceptor', 'been', 'told', 'played', 'out', 'very', 'well', 'movie', 'out', 'rather', 'quick', 'pace', 'never', 'boring', 'Justin', 'Whalin', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'group', 'are', 'excellent', 'film', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'was', 'also', 'perfect', 'foil', 'plans', 'actually', 'felt', 'little', 'sorry', 'character.The', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'okay', 'considering', 'massive', 'amount', 'used', 'picture', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'away', 'story', 'battle', 'dragons', 'was', 'done', 'pretty', 'good', 'wish', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'given', 'larger', 'dose', 'action.It', 'was', 'very', 'nice', 'see', 'Tom', 'Baker', 'screen', 'Fans', 'BBC', 'series', 'Doctor', 'Who', 'will', 'remember', 'beloved', 'fourth', 'Doctor', ""'ll"", 'be', 'honest', 'say', 'did', ""n't"", 'recognize', 'initially', 'when', 'realized', 'who', 'was', 'felt', 'good', 'see', 'once', 'again.The', 'movie', 'pretty', 'ugly', 'when', 'unfortunately', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'frame', 'Irons', 'be', 'overacting', 'attempt', 'be', 'dreaded', 'nemesis', 'supposed', 'be', 'funny', 'how', 'sometimes', 'Irons', 'can', 'be', 'such', 'brilliant', 'bad', 'guy', 'then', 'stumble', 'way', 'film', 'such', 'Time', 'Machine', 'Birch', 'completely', 'character', 'movie', 'such', 'good', 'actress', 'other', 'films', 'American', 'Beauty', 'Ghost', 'World', 'etc', ""n't"", 'seem', 'be', 'able', 'grasp', 'character', 'playing', 'would', 'think', 'radical', 'character', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'played', 'more', 'emotion', 'least', 'emotion', 'ending', 'abrupt', 'uneventful', 'Sure', 'bad', 'guy', 'end', 'ending', 'only', 'point', 'quickly', 'shut', 'movie', 'down.Once', 'again', 'real', 'story', 'better', 'story', 'Whalin', 'friends', 'character', 'portrayed', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'Had', 'been', 'entire', 'focus', 'film', 'probably', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'better.Recommended', 'folks', 'who', 'enjoy', 'fantasy', 'do', ""n't"", 'take', 'too', 'seriously', 'other', 'words', 'play', 'dress-up', 'days', 'not', 'associated', 'Halloween', 'Renaissance', 'festival', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'like']",Dungeons & Dragons

Despite bad critical reviews I thought I'd try it since critics rarely seem to like this genre, but I sat for however long (too long) in a movie theatre, napping &amp; waiting for SOMETHING good to happen.  There was ONE spot that I found vaguely interesting, not for its acting, or the impact on the plot but because it reminded me of a Tarot card (the hanged man) and I thought that was kind of clever-- but because the hanged man means trial by ordeal that one comes through, the reference made me expect something deep &amp; interesting later from this reference, which never happened.... Really, the only trial by ordeal was paying to see this movie, and I did not come through the trial improved.

An attempt to depose the young empress, Savina, is made by an evil power-hungry mage, Profion, and his henchman, Damodar (the latter we see again in the sequel: D&D; Wrath of the Dragon God-Elemental Might).  In an effort to save the kingdom of Izmer, an adventuring party is formed consisting of two thieves, a mage, and a dwarf.On the positive side:1) The plot as a whole was not bad at all; it was an interesting story, which included some fascinating artifacts, such as scepters and rods, with the power to control Gold Dragons and Red Dragons respectively.2) Overall, the special effects were pretty good.  The beholder, the dragons, and the final battle over the city were quite enjoyable.On the negative side:1) The benevolent empress, the evil wizard, and the attempted coup d'etat, had Star Wars written all over it.  There is so much originality in this AMAZING game called D&D; that the last thing one needs to do is ""borrow"" themes from others!2) The choice of actors and the acting itself were way below average to say the least.Marlon Wayans in a Dungeons and Dragons movie... Should I say more?The orange-haired dwarf was just sad.  His general appearance, his poor accent, and his choice of lines were pathetic.To call Jeremy Irons' role ""limited"" would be an understatement; it's more like non-existent.  He is the movie's ""heavy artillery"" and he doesn't have more than 10 minutes on screen.  It's ridiculous.Neither Damodar nor his blue lipstick seemed to belong in this movie.As for the actress playing the elf, had she read any Tolkien or D&D; novels prior to attempting to play her character?In short, the cast is badly in need of acting lessons!3) The dialogues were way below average.  Why? The writers should know...4) Most of the creatures encountered throughout the movie were out of a Star Wars or Star Trek universe and not a D&D; world.  What is wrong with these people?  Last time I checked there were plenty of entries in all the D&D; Monster Manuals that have been published over the years.The film would have been so much better if the actors could act and if the writers/director had the ability to... write and direct!  A shame really...I have to say that I was more than a little disappointed with what seemed to be a parody of Dungeons and Dragons, mocking all those who love the game and scaring away those who might otherwise have developed an interest.  SHAME!  If moronic shows like Xena and Hercules have fans (!!!), if Harry Potter and Narnia books can be turned into blockbuster movies, then D&D;'s Forgotten Realms-Dragonlance best-selling novels and Greyhawk adventures should really take off no problem (that is if the work is done properly).In a nutshell, if you keep your expectations low, it might provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it. 2 Stars",3,Why does he have to live in the end???,1136073600,"01 1, 2006",2006,2896,"['So', 'was', 'long', 'awaited', 'long', 'overdue', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'movie', 'attempt', 'depose', 'young', 'empress', 'Savina', 'made', 'evil', 'power-hungry', 'mage', 'Profion', 'henchman', 'Damodar', 'latter', 'see', 'again', 'sequel', 'D', 'D', 'Wrath', 'Dragon', 'God-Elemental', 'Might', 'effort', 'save', 'kingdom', 'Izmer', 'adventuring', 'party', 'formed', 'consisting', 'two', 'thieves', 'mage', 'dwarf.On', 'positive', 'side:1', 'plot', 'whole', 'was', 'not', 'bad', 'was', 'interesting', 'story', 'included', 'fascinating', 'artifacts', 'such', 'scepters', 'rods', 'power', 'control', 'Gold', 'Dragons', 'Red', 'Dragons', 'respectively.2', 'Overall', 'special', 'effects', 'were', 'pretty', 'good', 'beholder', 'dragons', 'final', 'battle', 'city', 'were', 'quite', 'enjoyable.On', 'negative', 'side:1', 'benevolent', 'empress', 'evil', 'wizard', 'attempted', 'coup', ""d'etat"", 'had', 'Star', 'Wars', 'written', 'so', 'much', 'originality', 'AMAZING', 'game', 'called', 'D', 'D', 'last', 'thing', 'one', 'do', 'borrow', 'themes', 'others', '2', 'choice', 'actors', 'acting', 'were', 'way', 'average', 'say', 'least.Marlon', 'Wayans', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'movie', 'Should', 'say', 'more', 'orange-haired', 'dwarf', 'was', 'just', 'sad', 'general', 'appearance', 'poor', 'accent', 'choice', 'lines', 'were', 'pathetic.To', 'call', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'role', 'limited', 'would', 'be', 'understatement', 'more', 'non-existent', 'movie', 'heavy', 'artillery', ""n't"", 'have', 'more', '10', 'minutes', 'screen', 'ridiculous.Neither', 'Damodar', 'blue', 'lipstick', 'seemed', 'belong', 'movie.As', 'actress', 'playing', 'elf', 'had', 'read', 'Tolkien', 'D', 'D', 'novels', 'prior', 'attempting', 'play', 'character', 'short', 'cast', 'badly', 'need', 'acting', 'lessons', '3', 'dialogues', 'were', 'way', 'average', 'Why', 'writers', 'should', 'know', '4', 'Most', 'creatures', 'encountered', 'movie', 'were', 'out', 'Star', 'Wars', 'Star', 'Trek', 'universe', 'not', 'D', 'D', 'world', 'What', 'wrong', 'people', 'Last', 'time', 'checked', 'were', 'plenty', 'entries', 'D', 'D', 'Monster', 'Manuals', 'have', 'been', 'published', 'years.The', 'film', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'so', 'much', 'better', 'actors', 'could', 'act', 'writers/director', 'had', 'ability', 'write', 'direct', 'shame', 'really', 'have', 'say', 'was', 'more', 'little', 'disappointed', 'what', 'seemed', 'be', 'parody', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'mocking', 'who', 'love', 'game', 'scaring', 'away', 'who', 'might', 'otherwise', 'have', 'developed', 'interest', 'SHAME', 'moronic', 'shows', 'Xena', 'Hercules', 'have', 'fans', 'Harry', 'Potter', 'Narnia', 'books', 'can', 'be', 'turned', 'blockbuster', 'movies', 'then', 'D', 'D', 'Forgotten', 'Realms-Dragonlance', 'best-selling', 'novels', 'Greyhawk', 'adventures', 'should', 'really', 'take', 'off', 'problem', 'work', 'done', 'properly', 'nutshell', 'keep', 'expectations', 'low', 'might', 'provide', 'evening', 'entertainment', '2', 'Stars']",Dungeons & Dragons

The casting is awful, the acting atrocious, the writing is phenomenally bad.  The sets and costumes rest uneasily in that wretched zone between camp and simply inept.And then there is the plot.  Of course, the scale of the drama is truly grand, the writers were not afraid to embrace the tired cliche of every bad fantasy novel, of the unlikely band of heroes tasked to save the Universe and face the ULTIMATE MENACE.  Yet the plot frequently stumbles down even this well worn path, as each scene seems more jarringly unlikely and hackneyed than the one before it, to the point that one quickly loses any sense that there is a plot at all.By contrast, even basic Dungeon-crawls can actually make for pretty interesting and dramatic stories.  In fact, I think this is where a lot of D&D; fans were really let down.  Even if only due to the random element introduced by the dice, the twists and turns of a reasonably good rpg session can be far more nuanced and interesting than your typical fantasy movie or TV series.I think most people who have played an RPG at one time or another have thought of this, perhaps leading to the greatest hope that was dashed by this incredibly bad film: a real D&D; game could probably have been the basis for quite a good plot.  But this movie bore little if any resemblance to even the most hackneyed D&D; game ever played by anybody over the age of puberty, and rather than advancing the fantasy genre forward, it definately took it several steps back.On a more technical level, the completely ridiculous props and costumes which would have raised eyebrows in an Ed Wood film don't help much in the suspension of disbelief department, and the very clunky CGI rounded out the general feeling of complete disconnect.Even if you are the sort of person who likes almost any kind of science fiction or fantasy fare, avoid this, it will leave a bad taste in your mouth.  This is quite simply one of those films you just can't go along with no matter how much you might want to.  It's worse than the Postman, or Waterworld, or the worst Xena episode you ever saw.  I'm only giving it one star because I can't give it zero or negative stars.  I would actually for the record prefer to give this negative 5 stars.This is another classic blunder of marketing by WOTC, which goes back to earlier PR efforts in the history of the game and it's previous owners (TSR).  Once again they managed to make their fairly interesting game look completely stupid, following in a noble tradition including a really bad cartoon series or two and going all the way back to the botched 60 minutes interview where the reasonably benign Gary Gygax somehow came across like Charlie Manson.  I'm certain they could not have done a worse job of marketing this game to the mainstream if that was their original plan.  I guess the question is: what is their plan?",1,The word 'Terrible' simply isn't harsh enough,1139788800,"02 13, 2006",2006,3537,"['cliche', 'say', 'particular', 'movie', 'worst', 'ever', 'made', ""'m"", 'sure', 'worse', 'films', 'have', 'actually', 'been', 'produced', 'just', 'cant', 'think', 'right', 'now', 'even', 'sitting', 'here', 'trying', '5', 'minutes', 'put', 'perspective', 'recent', 'made', 'Sci', 'Fi', 'Channel', 'movie', 'Mansquito', 'was', 'masterpiece', 'compared', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'movie.Apparently', 'crackpot', 'nobody', 'guy', 'wrote', 'screenplay', 'even', 'directed', 'travesty', 'film', 'was', 'as', 'much', 'genius', 'self-salesmanship', 'utter', 'incompetent', 'filmcraft', 'blunders', 'inherent', 'here', 'range', 'systemic', 'minutely', 'technical', 'one', 'sense', 'least', 'film', 'consistent', 'casting', 'awful', 'acting', 'atrocious', 'writing', 'phenomenally', 'bad', 'sets', 'costumes', 'rest', 'uneasily', 'wretched', 'zone', 'camp', 'simply', 'inept.And', 'then', 'plot', 'course', 'scale', 'drama', 'truly', 'grand', 'writers', 'were', 'not', 'afraid', 'embrace', 'tired', 'cliche', 'bad', 'fantasy', 'novel', 'unlikely', 'band', 'heroes', 'tasked', 'save', 'Universe', 'face', 'ULTIMATE', 'MENACE', 'plot', 'frequently', 'down', 'even', 'well', 'worn', 'path', 'scene', 'more', 'jarringly', 'unlikely', 'hackneyed', 'one', 'point', 'one', 'quickly', 'sense', 'plot', 'all.By', 'contrast', 'even', 'basic', 'Dungeon-crawls', 'can', 'actually', 'make', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'dramatic', 'stories', 'fact', 'think', 'where', 'lot', 'D', 'D', 'fans', 'were', 'really', 'let', 'down', 'Even', 'only', 'due', 'random', 'element', 'introduced', 'dice', 'twists', 'turns', 'reasonably', 'good', 'rpg', 'session', 'can', 'be', 'far', 'more', 'nuanced', 'interesting', 'typical', 'fantasy', 'movie', 'TV', 'series.I', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'played', 'RPG', 'one', 'time', 'have', 'thought', 'perhaps', 'leading', 'greatest', 'hope', 'was', 'dashed', 'incredibly', 'bad', 'film', 'real', 'D', 'D', 'game', 'could', 'probably', 'have', 'been', 'basis', 'quite', 'good', 'plot', 'movie', 'bore', 'little', 'resemblance', 'even', 'most', 'hackneyed', 'D', 'D', 'game', 'ever', 'played', 'anybody', 'age', 'puberty', 'rather', 'advancing', 'fantasy', 'genre', 'forward', 'definately', 'took', 'several', 'steps', 'back.On', 'more', 'technical', 'level', 'completely', 'ridiculous', 'props', 'costumes', 'would', 'have', 'raised', 'eyebrows', 'Ed', 'Wood', 'film', 'do', ""n't"", 'help', 'much', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'department', 'very', 'clunky', 'CGI', 'rounded', 'out', 'general', 'feeling', 'complete', 'disconnect.Even', 'are', 'sort', 'person', 'who', 'almost', 'kind', 'science', 'fiction', 'fantasy', 'fare', 'avoid', 'will', 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'quite', 'simply', 'one', 'films', 'just', 'ca', ""n't"", 'go', 'along', 'matter', 'how', 'much', 'might', 'want', 'worse', 'Postman', 'Waterworld', 'worst', 'Xena', 'episode', 'ever', 'saw', ""'m"", 'only', 'giving', 'one', 'star', 'ca', ""n't"", 'give', 'zero', 'negative', 'stars', 'would', 'actually', 'record', 'prefer', 'give', 'negative', '5', 'stars.This', 'classic', 'blunder', 'marketing', 'WOTC', 'back', 'earlier', 'PR', 'efforts', 'history', 'game', 'previous', 'owners', 'TSR', 'Once', 'again', 'managed', 'make', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'game', 'look', 'completely', 'stupid', 'following', 'noble', 'tradition', 'including', 'really', 'bad', 'cartoon', 'series', 'two', 'going', 'way', 'back', 'botched', '60', 'minutes', 'interview', 'where', 'reasonably', 'benign', 'Gary', 'Gygax', 'somehow', 'came', 'Charlie', 'Manson', ""'m"", 'certain', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'worse', 'job', 'marketing', 'game', 'mainstream', 'was', 'original', 'plan', 'guess', 'question', 'what', 'plan']",Dungeons & Dragons

532912,A18RQ2URRGIIEA,B00003CXQM,"M. Hart ""Sci-Fi Fan""","[5, 8]","In December, 2000, two friends talked me into seeing what is probably one of the worst films that I have ever paid to watch in a theater: Courtney Solomon's abysmal directorial debut called &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.  With absolutely no previous directorial or acting experience in film or television, Courtney Solomon was hired to spend a $35-million budget and direct a film written by two nearly equally inexperienced writers, Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwright.  Topper Lilien and Carroll Cartwrights' only previous film writing experience was for the 2000 German production of &quot;Where the Money Is&quot;.  (Topper Lilien also wrote for the canceled, 1998, single-season TV series &quot;Maximum Bob&quot;.)  What was the management of the production company New Line Cinema thinking when they funded this trio to create a live-action film based upon the popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons game created by E. Gary Gygax?  Afterall, this is the same production company that superbly brought J.R.R. Tolkien's classic trilogy &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to life on the big screen.  Clearly, not much thought went into this box-office flop, but Courtney Solomon's ownership to the rights of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons game was probably a pivotal factor.The plot of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; can be summarized as follows: The Kingdom of Izmer is divided into the magic-wielding Mages and the poor commoners.  Empress Savina (Thora Birch) wants to change the status quo by extending equality to the poor, but the evil mage Profion (Jeremy Irons) wants to depose her.  After Profion takes a magic scepter that controls the golden dragons from Savina through political maneuvering, Savina must find the mythical Rod of Savrill, which controls the legendary red dragons.  Drafted into helping her are the apprentice mage Marina Pretensa (Zoe McLellan), the two thieves Ridley (Justin Whalin) and Snails (Marlon Wayans). a dwarf named Elwood (Lee Arenberg) and the elf Norda (Kristen Wilson).  Profion is assisted by the powerful soldier Damodar (Bruce Payne), who fights Savina's ragtag allies.Sadly, mediocre computer-generated special effects could not transform this poorly scripted, dismally directed and inferiorly acted film into an entertaining and enjoyable experience.  Instead, I felt like I had lost two hours of my life for nothing.  Hence, the best rating that I can grant this film is 1 star.  My advice to anyone who hasn't yet seen the film is not to waste any time watching it, but if you are genuinely interested, rent a copy first before buying it.  Most of the actors who performed in &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; have gone on to act in other films, but not surprisingly, neither Courtney Solomon nor the films two writers have done any work in film or television since.If you want to see a better film featuring dragons, my suggestions include Matthew Robbins' 1981 film &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, Rob Cohen's 1996 film &quot;Dragonheart&quot; or even Rob Bowman's 2002 film &quot;Reign of Fire&quot;.  (&quot;Reign of Fire&quot; isn't as good as my first two suggestions, but is much better than &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.)",1,"What Inexperienced Directing &amp; Writing, &amp; $35-million Create",1067472000,"10 30, 2003",2003,3177,"['December', '2000', 'two', 'friends', 'talked', 'seeing', 'what', 'probably', 'one', 'worst', 'films', 'have', 'ever', 'paid', 'watch', 'theater', 'Courtney', 'Solomon', 'abysmal', 'directorial', 'debut', 'called', 'quot', 'Dungeons', 'amp', 'Dragons', 'quot', 'absolutely', 'previous', 'directorial', 'acting', 'experience', 'film', 'television', 'Courtney', 'Solomon', 'was', 'hired', 'spend', '35-million', 'budget', 'direct', 'film', 'written', 'two', 'nearly', 'equally', 'inexperienced', 'writers', 'Topper', 'Lilien', 'Carroll', 'Cartwright', 'Topper', 'Lilien', 'Carroll', 'Cartwrights', 'only', 'previous', 'film', 'writing', 'experience', 'was', '2000', 'German', 'production', 'quot', 'Where', 'Money', 'Is', 'quot', 'Topper', 'Lilien', 'also', 'wrote', 'canceled', '1998', 'single-season', 'TV', 'series', 'quot', 'Maximum', 'Bob', 'quot', 'What', 'was', 'management', 'production', 'company', 'New', 'Line', 'Cinema', 'thinking', 'when', 'funded', 'trio', 'create', 'live-action', 'film', 'based', 'popular', 'Dungeons', 'amp', 'Dragons', 'game', 'created', 'E.', 'Gary', 'Gygax', 'Afterall', 'same', 'production', 'company', 'superbly', 'brought', 'J.R.R', 'Tolkien', 'classic', 'trilogy', 'quot', 'Lord', 'Rings', 'quot', 'life', 'big', 'screen', 'Clearly', 'not', 'much', 'thought', 'went', 'box-office', 'flop', 'Courtney', 'Solomon', 'ownership', 'rights', 'Dungeons', 'amp', 'Dragons', 'game', 'was', 'probably', 'pivotal', 'factor.The', 'plot', 'quot', 'Dungeons', 'amp', 'Dragons', 'quot', 'can', 'be', 'summarized', 'Kingdom', 'Izmer', 'divided', 'magic-wielding', 'Mages', 'poor', 'commoners', 'Empress', 'Savina', 'Thora', 'Birch', 'change', 'status', 'quo', 'extending', 'equality', 'poor', 'evil', 'mage', 'Profion', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'depose', 'Profion', 'magic', 'scepter', 'golden', 'dragons', 'Savina', 'political', 'maneuvering', 'Savina', 'must', 'find', 'mythical', 'Rod', 'Savrill', 'legendary', 'red', 'dragons', 'Drafted', 'helping', 'are', 'apprentice', 'mage', 'Marina', 'Pretensa', 'Zoe', 'McLellan', 'two', 'thieves', 'Ridley', 'Justin', 'Whalin', 'Snails', 'Marlon', 'Wayans', 'dwarf', 'named', 'Elwood', 'Lee', 'Arenberg', 'elf', 'Norda', 'Kristen', 'Wilson', 'Profion', 'assisted', 'powerful', 'soldier', 'Damodar', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'who', 'fights', 'Savina', 'ragtag', 'allies.Sadly', 'mediocre', 'computer-generated', 'special', 'effects', 'could', 'not', 'transform', 'poorly', 'scripted', 'dismally', 'directed', 'inferiorly', 'acted', 'film', 'entertaining', 'enjoyable', 'experience', 'Instead', 'felt', 'had', 'lost', 'two', 'hours', 'life', 'nothing', 'Hence', 'best', 'rating', 'can', 'grant', 'film', '1', 'star', 'advice', 'anyone', 'who', ""n't"", 'yet', 'seen', 'film', 'not', 'waste', 'time', 'watching', 'are', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'rent', 'copy', 'first', 'buying', 'Most', 'actors', 'who', 'performed', 'quot', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'quot', 'have', 'gone', 'act', 'other', 'films', 'not', 'surprisingly', 'Courtney', 'Solomon', 'films', 'two', 'writers', 'have', 'done', 'work', 'film', 'television', 'since.If', 'want', 'see', 'better', 'film', 'featuring', 'dragons', 'suggestions', 'include', 'Matthew', 'Robbins', '1981', 'film', 'quot', 'Dragonslayer', 'quot', 'Rob', 'Cohen', '1996', 'film', 'quot', 'Dragonheart', 'quot', 'even', 'Rob', 'Bowman', '2002', 'film', 'quot', 'Reign', 'Fire', 'quot', 'quot', 'Reign', 'Fire', 'quot', ""n't"", 'as', 'good', 'first', 'two', 'suggestions', 'much', 'better', 'quot', 'Dungeons', 'amp', 'Dragons', 'quot']",Dungeons & Dragons

I've been playing D&amp;D since 1986, so I do understand and like the game...but this movie has precious little to do with the game at all.  The acting was terrible...Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans should bury their careers after this.  Jeremy Irons was clearly in it for the money, and poor Thora Birch looked like a little girl playing dress-up in mommy's evening gowns.  The script was just plain stupid, not to mention disjointed and muddled.  The direction was amateurish at best.  The only good part of this eyesore was the special effects...and they weren't exceptional at all, just adequate.  When I saw it at the theater the audience clearly hated it.  People were walking out, laughing at the big dramatic parts and sitting silently through the &quot;comedy&quot; bits.  When Snails was killed people were cheering and applauding; I haven't seen a character that stupid and obnoxious outside of Jar Jar Binks (and Marlon Wayans should be ashamed of himself for taking such a demeaning role).  It's also sad that the game emphasizes teamwork, while the movie does not.  The so-called &quot;labyrinth&quot; is just a series of rooms opening on to one another.  The big dungeon at the end was a let down.  The fights are almost all human vs. human; some monsters from the game show up but they're mostly window dressing, on view for a few seconds at most.  (The one exception is the dragons, but even then they're wasted.)  If it had been less violent, it could have been a half decent children's movie...this flick has an overall juvenile feel to it, like a bad Saturday-morning TV show.

On Xmas Eve 2000, my theater hadn't yet gotten Cast Away or Crouching Tiger, but it did have my third choice, D&D.;Well, I've never been so intricately close to D&D; that I would have been labeled a sinner in the 80s, but I have ALWAYS loved medieval fantasy, and many of the D&D; stories and characters. So, I had the feeling going to the film that I would have a good old popcorn munching time with one of my favorite genres. No decent movies about medieval times had come out in a while, so what better than D&D; to end the drought?Well, I left the theater laughing. Not at the movie, but at myself for having such high hopes. It had potential, I'll say that. I chuckled at a joke or two, I liked some of feel, like magicians and thieves and whatnot. But in the end, it felt like a washed out, Lord of the Rings lite. And who would have known that LOTR would indeed come out a year later and absolutely blow everyone's socks off?The main problem with D&D; is its basic plot. Several characters band together to retrieve a magical item and defeat the wizard. Ok, sounds fair. But the characters are so wooden and stereotypical, I just didn't care. The thieves are rebels who believe in justice and equality. The wizards are old and power hungry. The dwarf likes beer and fights. The elves are delicate and mysterious. And that's about the most we get to know anybody, although the main two characters (thieves) get more screen time and somewhat anachronistic dialogue. I admit I was surprised by a death halfway through, and surprised again at what happened / didn't happen with the dead at the end of the film. But outside of that, it's pretty stock stuff. And don't look for Jeremy Irons to save the film, he overacts here with the best of them. Although I did enjoy his last scene or two involving his magic and the dragon battle.I guess bottom line is that it's worth a see if you're a real D&D; or fantasy fan, but other than that, it's not that great, and if you've seen Lord of the Rings by then you've already seen better.

Thankfully, it isn't too hard for a non-D&D; fan to understand. But I found the film to be much too mediocre and basically another stack of cliches, useful only to satisfy a friday-night spot for an adventure flick.I can't recall much of the exact storyline, as I drifted in and out of day-dream-land during most of the movie (yes, it can be somewhat boring). But I can assure you, the basic plot is all too familiar. Cutting it down to the essentials, there is something worth a lot of power (and also alot of money, depending on what your interest is) that both the good guys and the bad guys want, and predictable enough, they must race against time as well as each other to obtain it. Among all of the cheesy adventure antics that remind me of a sc-fi-channel original series, there is also a love story that evolves throughout the film (as if that would be unexpected).The acting is -- as most reviewers have pointed out -- quite distracting because of obvious lack of either acting talent or director talent (but no matter whose fault, there's no reason to point fingers, because they probably all were equal contributors to it's cheesiness). Most scenes will make you cringe with cliche action-movie lines and pathetic attempts at showing the character's emotion. But, before long, I found myself adapting to the corny world of the movie and it didn't distract me as much. Dungeons and Dragons is actually a decent fantasy flick if you can just train yourself to ignore it's overflow of cheesiness. One move D&D; successfully executed was adding in plenty of humor. The terrible acting seemed a little more at home because the film in general takes itself quite lightly.But one negative thing is for sure worth mentioning, and that is the fact that dragon fans will be disappointed. This movie focuses much more on the people than the monsters -- especially excluding the dragons. The obviously CGI-constructed dragons only appear at the very beginning of the film and a few shots in the last 15 minutes of the film. I'm not going to take shame in it, I'm a fan of dragons. No matter the age, dragons are a dark and fantastic treat to see on the screen. But I must warn those who haven't seen it that, while the story line can revolve around them at times, the actual involvement of dragons is scarce.As far as DVD features go, there are some deleted scenes and step-by-step demonstrations on the CGI construction of the few parts the dragons are included, but not much to jump up and dance about. The best feature would have to be the documentary on fantasy games (mostly, of course, having to do with D&D;).Overall, D&D; is a very average corny fantasy/adventure flick that is definately only worth rental money. If you want an interesting storyline and more dragon-time on screen, you'll have to look someplace else. Regardless, I think anybody can enjoy this as a treatment to afternoon boredom.",3,A Very Average Fantasy/Adventure Film For Such A Cult-Status Theme As D&D,1123286400,"08 6, 2005",2005,3027,"['reviewer', 'one', 'who', 'never', 'played', 'D', 'D', 'game', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'much', 'idea', 'what', 'expect', 'movie', 'Thankfully', ""n't"", 'too', 'hard', 'non-D', 'D', 'fan', 'understand', 'found', 'film', 'be', 'much', 'too', 'mediocre', 'basically', 'stack', 'cliches', 'useful', 'only', 'satisfy', 'friday-night', 'spot', 'adventure', 'flick.I', 'ca', ""n't"", 'recall', 'much', 'exact', 'storyline', 'drifted', 'day-dream-land', 'most', 'movie', 'yes', 'can', 'be', 'somewhat', 'boring', 'can', 'assure', 'basic', 'plot', 'too', 'familiar', 'Cutting', 'down', 'essentials', 'something', 'lot', 'power', 'also', 'alot', 'money', 'depending', 'what', 'interest', 'good', 'guys', 'bad', 'guys', 'want', 'predictable', 'enough', 'must', 'race', 'time', 'as', 'well', 'other', 'obtain', 'cheesy', 'adventure', 'antics', 'remind', 'sc-fi-channel', 'original', 'series', 'also', 'love', 'story', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'unexpected', '.The', 'acting', 'most', 'reviewers', 'have', 'pointed', 'out', 'quite', 'distracting', 'obvious', 'lack', 'acting', 'talent', 'director', 'talent', 'matter', 'fault', 'reason', 'point', 'fingers', 'probably', 'were', 'equal', 'contributors', 'cheesiness', 'Most', 'scenes', 'will', 'make', 'cringe', 'cliche', 'action-movie', 'lines', 'pathetic', 'attempts', 'showing', 'character', 'emotion', 'long', 'found', 'adapting', 'corny', 'world', 'movie', 'did', ""n't"", 'distract', 'much', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'actually', 'decent', 'fantasy', 'flick', 'can', 'just', 'train', 'ignore', 'overflow', 'cheesiness', 'One', 'move', 'D', 'D', 'successfully', 'executed', 'was', 'adding', 'plenty', 'humor', 'terrible', 'acting', 'seemed', 'little', 'more', 'home', 'film', 'general', 'quite', 'lightly.But', 'one', 'negative', 'thing', 'sure', 'worth', 'mentioning', 'fact', 'dragon', 'fans', 'will', 'be', 'disappointed', 'movie', 'much', 'more', 'people', 'monsters', 'especially', 'excluding', 'dragons', 'obviously', 'CGI-constructed', 'dragons', 'only', 'appear', 'very', 'beginning', 'film', 'few', 'shots', 'last', '15', 'minutes', 'film', ""'m"", 'not', 'going', 'take', 'shame', ""'m"", 'fan', 'dragons', 'matter', 'age', 'dragons', 'are', 'dark', 'fantastic', 'treat', 'see', 'screen', 'must', 'warn', 'who', 'have', ""n't"", 'seen', 'story', 'line', 'can', 'revolve', 'times', 'actual', 'involvement', 'dragons', 'scarce.As', 'far', 'DVD', 'features', 'go', 'are', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'step-by-step', 'demonstrations', 'CGI', 'construction', 'few', 'parts', 'dragons', 'are', 'included', 'not', 'much', 'jump', 'up', 'dance', 'about', 'best', 'feature', 'would', 'have', 'be', 'documentary', 'fantasy', 'games', 'mostly', 'course', 'having', 'do', 'D', 'D', '.Overall', 'D', 'D', 'very', 'average', 'corny', 'fantasy/adventure', 'flick', 'definately', 'only', 'worth', 'rental', 'money', 'want', 'interesting', 'storyline', 'more', 'dragon-time', 'screen', ""'ll"", 'have', 'look', 'someplace', 'else', 'Regardless', 'think', 'anybody', 'can', 'enjoy', 'treatment', 'afternoon', 'boredom']",Dungeons & Dragons

My other was that a D&amp;D movie would be made. Unfortunately I got this. I have been a fan of the game many years and have held it as the authority on fantasy so I expected that a D&amp;D movie would hold the same standard. As soon as I saw the preview I knew it would not prove true. I expected the movie to be darker,drearier, and with more hardcore battle scenes, more like Braveheart.While the production was that of a Xena episode, the movie does have good qualities, hence the three stars.It does have great fantasy elements and some role playing elements. Unlike most people, I thought that Wayons and Whalin were great together and did have a companion like chemsitry.Irons on the other hand, who is the more known actor, was horrible. I have never seen somebody overact so bad.I cringed at his delivery. This movie is simple fun that I would recommend to fans of the fantasy genre, due to the lack of fantasy movies, but not to anyone else.In the World of Dungeons and Dragons there are many good worlds and products. Unfortunatly this movie will label all D&amp;D products and stigmatize any efforts to make another.There is no end to how many D&amp;D movies that could be made. I will buy this movie despite it's shortcomings.If you feel empty after this movie and are looking for the authority on fantasy I think DRAGONSLAYER, RECORD OF LODOSS WAR, and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, will give you what you are looking for.

They decide to help a pretty student mage search for the rod of Savrille which will help the empress by letting her control the red dragons and thus defeat Archmage Profion who is leading the revolt against her.My Opinion:  I was disappointed by D&amp;D. I had even heard the bad reviews before seeing it, so I was prepared. When are they going to learn that special effects do not make up for a good story, characters, and plot. I am a huge fantasy and science fiction fan. I wanted so badly for this to be good, but the story just wasn't there.  The plot was convoluted and hazy and the characters undeveloped. The humor was misused and poorly timed. The Saturday morning cartoon by the same name was far superior because it had good stories and characters (If you haven't seen any episodes of this one, watch for it. It's on from time to time). Basically the movie is just really disappointing to a fan. By using the name Dungeons and Dragons, they got our hopes up.

Kelly ""snakeoil_sean""","[0, 0]","When I went to see this movie in the theaters (and I did), it hadn't been too long since I'd gone through the tragedy now known as Episode 1: The Phantom Menace.Needless to say, I'd become accustomed to setting the bar quite low for established licenses and being a fan of both movies and role playing games for decades+ years had given me a pretty comprehensive range of the best and worst of both.So, all that said, what was my initial reaction to Dungeons & Dragons the Movie? Pretty good, actually.While I would have liked just as much to have seen a re-imagining of the '80s cartoon show or an interpretation of one of the established campaign settings from TSR's (now WotC/Hasbro) catalog of games, I was willing to give the generic party of fantasy tropes a chance because I had seen it so many times on screen or on the table top and knew that good stories can also rise from humble (if uninspired) origins.What we got was kind of a mixed bag. The look of the film with settings, costumes, effects etc. was pretty decent in execution and presentation. The actors were in no way terrible with a few memorable performances (particularly Bruce Payne's blue lipped lackey character and the maniacal Jeremy Irons) even if the protagonists weren't that compelling (except for Lee Arenberg aka the Dwarf).The story was the sort of/kind of epic tale you might expect from your DM at the beginning of a new campaign or module, but didn't exactly come together in a way that felt like it paid off in the end.Over all, the story just feels like a squandered opportunity considering the enormous amount of source material and story telling capability that came with this license.After I bought the DVD and got to watch a lot of the behind the scenes extras and unfinished scenes, I think I had a better idea of what Mr. Solomon was going for with his story and regret that the additional scenes hadn't been able to be integrated into the film.To that point, I should probably give the overall score on this movie closer to 3 stars, but with the DVD extras that helped to fill in some of the gaps and gave me a better appreciation over all I'm setting it at a ...Soft 4, definitely worth checking out if you're a fan of the swords and sorcery flicks or rpgs, but check your expectations at the door.",4,How to enjoy watching this movie.,988934400,"05 4, 2001",2001,2294,"['When', 'went', 'see', 'movie', 'theaters', 'did', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'too', 'long', ""'d"", 'gone', 'tragedy', 'now', 'known', 'Episode', '1', 'Phantom', 'Menace.Needless', 'say', ""'d"", 'become', 'accustomed', 'setting', 'bar', 'quite', 'low', 'established', 'licenses', 'being', 'fan', 'movies', 'role', 'playing', 'games', 'decades+', 'years', 'had', 'given', 'pretty', 'comprehensive', 'range', 'best', 'worst', 'both.So', 'said', 'what', 'was', 'initial', 'reaction', 'Dungeons', 'Dragons', 'Movie', 'Pretty', 'good', 'actually.While', 'would', 'have', 'liked', 'just', 'as', 'much', 'have', 'seen', 're-imagining', ""'80s"", 'cartoon', 'show', 'interpretation', 'one', 'established', 'campaign', 'settings', 'TSR', 'now', 'WotC/Hasbro', 'catalog', 'games', 'was', 'willing', 'give', 'generic', 'party', 'fantasy', 'chance', 'had', 'seen', 'so', 'many', 'times', 'screen', 'table', 'top', 'knew', 'good', 'stories', 'can', 'also', 'rise', 'humble', 'uninspired', 'got', 'was', 'kind', 'mixed', 'bag', 'look', 'film', 'settings', 'costumes', 'effects', 'etc', 'was', 'pretty', 'decent', 'execution', 'presentation', 'actors', 'were', 'way', 'terrible', 'few', 'memorable', 'performances', 'particularly', 'Bruce', 'Payne', 'blue', 'lipped', 'lackey', 'character', 'maniacal', 'Jeremy', 'Irons', 'even', 'protagonists', 'were', ""n't"", 'compelling', 'Lee', 'Arenberg', 'Dwarf', '.The', 'story', 'was', 'sort', 'of/kind', 'epic', 'tale', 'might', 'expect', 'DM', 'beginning', 'new', 'campaign', 'module', 'did', ""n't"", 'exactly', 'come', 'together', 'way', 'felt', 'paid', 'off', 'end.Over', 'story', 'just', 'feels', 'squandered', 'opportunity', 'considering', 'enormous', 'amount', 'source', 'material', 'story', 'telling', 'capability', 'came', 'license.After', 'bought', 'DVD', 'got', 'watch', 'lot', 'scenes', 'extras', 'unfinished', 'scenes', 'think', 'had', 'better', 'idea', 'what', 'Mr.', 'Solomon', 'was', 'going', 'story', 'regret', 'additional', 'scenes', 'had', ""n't"", 'been', 'able', 'be', 'integrated', 'film.To', 'point', 'should', 'probably', 'give', 'overall', 'score', 'movie', 'closer', '3', 'stars', 'DVD', 'extras', 'helped', 'fill', 'gaps', 'gave', 'better', 'appreciation', ""'m"", 'setting', 'Soft', '4', 'definitely', 'worth', 'checking', 'out', ""'re"", 'fan', 'swords', 'sorcery', 'flicks', 'rpgs', 'check', 'expectations', 'door']",Dungeons & Dragons

I've nothing against it or anything (I don't think it's nerdy or whatever), it's just never been my bag. But I was VERY excited when I saw this movie was being released. Why?Simple - the Dungeons and Dragons cartoon, which was by far the coolest cartoon of the 1980's. It smoked He-Man, Thundercats and any other contender and became one of THE best experiences of childhood. So while a movie based on the board game would have been cool, I was secretly hoping for a movie based on the cartoon. Come on - Hank and his flaming bow and arrow? Sarcastic Eric and his shield (you'd think the Dungeon Master would have thrown a SWORD in there too?), Bobby the Barbarian.. and let's not forget the uber bad-ass - Vengar himself. Let's face it folks - done right, it would have been AWESOME.But we didn't get that - we got, well.. who knows? The plot is so incoherent and amateurish it could have been based on a game of Hungry, Hungry Hippo's. And whilst great acting is never the prime goal in these sorts of movies, special mention MUST go to the utter lack of any conviction the actors here have in their performances, coming across as just stepping out of a Snow White pantomime.And then there's Jeremy Irons. Bit of a superb actor is our Jeremy, and I'm sure he thought at first he had signed up to a classy fantasy movie, thinking perhaps of Sir Alec Guiness in Star Wars. Then he read the script and saw the talentless monkeys he was working with and went full out into giving the worst performance of his entire career, not so much saying his lines as yelling them and spitting at the camera in an attempt to hide his embarrassment. Easily the best thing of the movie.The producers obviously thought it was going to do well judging by its laughably hopeful ambiguous ending. Not a chance in hell, guys.

532947,A3IP0R4JOD4R5G,B00003CXQM,the masked reviewer,"[8, 11]","Once upon a time in a land not so far away, a callow youth named Courtney Solomon had a dream. So he saved his pennies and at the tender age of 20, secured the film rights to DUNGEONS & DRAGONS, and thence pursued his Holy Grail: a big-screen version of the much-loved neo-medieval role-playing game. For 10 long years he wandered in the Holly Wood in search of the all-important Green Light, until one day he chanced upon the Lord of High Concepts (Sir Joel of the Silver). A meeting was taken and thence, ""a Courtney Solomon film"" was born.Talented actors signed on for big paychecks, but now, so close to his dream, the novice filmmaker refused to allow his vision to pass into the hands of those more experienced, and he himself assumed the director's chair. Some $43 million later, he had his tale of the fair Empress of Izmer, whose rule is threatened by an evil mage, or magician. With the help of a dwarf, an elf, an apprentice mage and two thieves, disaster was averted . . . in Izmer. (Alas, the same can not be said of the tale itself, which stinketh like the breath of a dyspeptic dragon.) But for we collectors of BAD MOVIES WE LOVE, there is a happier ending.Laboriously expository and defiantly incomprehensible, DUNGEONS & DRAGONS seems to involve the hunt for an enchanted ""rod,"" a threat to the prevailing ""fabric of magic,"" the fight for democracy in the kingdom of Izmer, and the ritual humiliation of actors. In ascending order of ignominy: haughty apprentice mage bland Zoe McLellan; Skywalkerish commoner Justin Whalin (the new Sean Patrick Flanery or the new Robert Sean Leonard? Discuss); his bumbling sidekick Marlon Wayans (a black character straight out of Hollywood's 1938 playbook); Glenn Close-channeling Jeremy Irons; and fair-minded empress Thora Birch, (who models a series of headpieces cribbed from '70s disco album sleeves and throughout sustains the impression of having learned her lines phonetically.)Those schooled in the arcana of the phenomenally successful fantasy role playing game can best rule on whether Solomon's live action adaptation is a faithful depiction of its obsessive world of elves, dwarfs, and winged things, but even a babe in dungeonland can see that the leading fire breather in this malty brew of heroics and minutiae isn't a computer generated creature, but Jeremy Irons as the archvillain Profion. All goggle-eyes, exaggerated double takes and full-throated oratory, Irons howls, whispers and rages, as he struts about in Olivier's 'Hamlet' eyeliner. Luxuriously bellowing immortal lines like ''You! Are! Mine! Now!', he attacks and guzzles every shred of scenery as if he were playing King Lear at a suburban community theater. ""With a dragon army at my command I can crush the empress!"" he cries joyfully, bending at the waist and making little claws out of his hands. (It's Bad Movie Nirvana!)As Irons henchman Damodar, Bruce Payne runs a close second. A bald and burly centurion, Payne goes through the movie wearing metallic blue lipstick, (an obvious but puzzling reference to Petula Clark), terrorizing heroes Whalin and Wayans, whose destiny is to save the world - or whatever. Aided by a lissome elf and a grumpy dwarf, our heroes embark on a quest involving glowing rubies and secret scrolls. With his long, chestnut lashes, cherubic cheeks and silky complexion, Justin Whalen is significantly prettier than his female love interest Zoe McLellan - the wholesome, magic-wielding librarian. Despite this obvious fact, McLellan decides to join them, and luckily, after she kisses Whalen her glasses disappear and her backswept math-girl hairdo is magically transformed into a hipper center-part. Our heroic group must battle Payne for possession of a powerful thingummy that can control red dragons, which may or may not be bigger and meaner than the regular green kind. The thingummy itself is called a ""rod,"" but strongly resembles my friend's old Dragon Bong.

Well, maybe D&amp;D isn't as bad as Legend. But what really makes it reek is the producer had the rights and was assumedly developing the story for TEN YEARS, and this spasm inducing excuse for a movie is the result. Let us note that I am not biased at all towards D&amp;D; to the contrary, I rather enjoy role playing. But nothing could make me enjoy this. In one word, the single most painful experience in the entire movie is the script. It is bad. You could release it in Arabic and have Saddam Hussein begging for mercy in twenty minutes. Example: &quot;Boy I'd like to give those mages some payback!&quot; &quot;Do you REALLY think you can steal MY DESTINEY?!&quot;  &quot;All people deserve to be free and equal.&quot; THE WHOLE MOVIE IS LIKE THIS! Watching it with earplugs would probably make D&amp;D about 50% more enjoyable. The story is your usual ho-hum about an evil mage (played, unbelievably, by Jeremy Irons) wanting to take over a kingdom by controlling a bunch of dragons. It's boring, and worse, a little incoherent. Special effects range from a blue-lipped warrior with snakes coming out of his ears to a guy getting sucked down into instant cake mix. Some fight scenes look alright, some look crappy, and some contain a woman wearing armor that only Madonna could be comfortable in.

532949,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B00003CXQM,Tsuyoshi,"[3, 3]","Probably I am one of the very few people who went to see this rather disappointing film in Japan.  Its release date was same as that of much-talked &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; so why did I care to see it?  Because, one of the cast is Thora Birch, one of the best  young actersses up in America.  And the poster of the film in Japan displayed her name in VERY large letters alongside with  that of, of course, Jeremy Irons. Unfortunately, those two talented people are THE disappointment.  One is acting too much, the other too little (which is which, you already know).  Moreover, as is seen in films like &quot;Mortal Kombat &quot; or &quot;Street Fighters,&quot; another big problem is the lack of script, not the story.  Anyway, as this is based on roll playing game, the story must be about the fight between the good and the evil, but  the film does not have any other way of staging it than relying old tricks which we have seen in films like &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; (such as a cave full of deadly tricks) in  much better form.  However, having said these things,  as a fan of adventure films, I enjoyed watching it pretty much, thanks to  two surprisingly good leads (Justin Whalin and Marlon Wayans) and Zoe McLellan, whose fresh presence is suitable for  strong-willed heroine much needed in this kind of tale, (though she deserves much better script). Special effects are not particularly  special, but good enough to keep you awake, and  some gimmicks are based on good ideas (like a map that swallows you up)  After all, it is very easy to be cynical, especially when you remember the  lamentable results of the films based on any kind of games  (remember &quot;Super Mario Brothers&quot; ?) but you cannot always expect &quot;Matrix.&quot;  Or can you?

However, contrary to what the majority of other reviewers have written, it wasn't a completely terrible movie, either. The film had a built in fan base from all of us RPG's and former RPG's and the expectations were so high that it was a major letdown.I won't try to explain the plot because it's so convoluted. Needless to say it involves some dungeons, lots of dragons, jewels, thieves, magic, swords, and colorful costumes. Also, the movie is heavily inspired by STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES.There is a lot of over-the-top acting here and lots of cheesy dialogue. However, for a movie like D & D, this really shouldn't be a complaint, do you know how much cheesy dialogue and over-the-top actions come out of players mouths during a gaming session. Or have you actually listened to how much cheesy dialogue people speak in real life for that matter?The character of Snails in the film is really annoying. However, he's also one of the more enjoyable characters just because he doesn't fit in with the norm of this world.The dragon fight near the end of the film is great. It would have been nice to see it done bigger, but it's still a pretty cool fight.The most confusing part of the movie is the end. I still haven't figured out what went on.Overall, an average fantasy/adventure. It was brought about by a first-time director and all of the mistakes of that first outing are clearly seen.

532952,AFYU5LXHZO5M3,B00003CXQM,"Vilbs ""vilbs""","[3, 5]","Like everybody else... I feel the need to qualify the beginning of my review by saying that I have been a fan of DnD and fantasy for well over a decade.  When I first heard this movie was coming out I was extremely excited, and friends and I went to see it on one of the first nights.  When I left.... well, I wondered how, after soooo many years of waiting and finally getting a real big screen debut for the genre, they could drop the ball so very very badly.  The worst part is, there was a really good movie in there somewhere, just dying to get out.  They clearly did their work on the special effects, which were excellent, but they tripped very badly with the dialogue and storyline.  Even the casting (take away the dialogue) wasn't all that bad.  Everybody certainly looked the part, but it all ended up feeling very contrived.  The comic relief was heroically unfunny, and the ""serious"" scenes turned out to be the true cause for amusement.Now, several years (and viewings), later, I don't hate the movie.... I just look at it as a wasted opportunity.  Had they really done their homework on this one, I truly think this could have launched the fantasy genre into the mainstream, but as it is I think it did more harm than good.  It reinforced the idea that DnD is stupid, hokey, and a game played only by strange repressed teenagers.  I had hoped that this could open the door for things like the ""Dragonlance"" Chronicles, or some of the ""Forgotten Realms"" storylines to make it into production (much like X-Men did for the comic book genre).  Alas, such will have to wait.All told, this is an average movie that fans of fantasy, with suitably low expectations, can enjoy.  It could have been so much more, and I think that is where a lot of the fans venom is coming from.  Try to enjoy it for what it is, because our movie options in the genre are severely limited, and despite its flaws there are some redeeming qualities that make it fun enough to watch.... that being said, I've also heard rumor that the movie gets that much better after a couple beers.

The only problem is, it's NOT the movie we've been waiting for. There must be some sort of mistake.All right, we're all big D&amp;D fans, aren't we? That is, anyone that sits through this whole thing had better be one, or you'll probably need a 'remove paralysis' spell cast on you at the end of it. Anyone familiar with the franchise will know that the true power of D&amp;D lies in the imagination, the development of characters, and plot- in that order of importance. Well, I suppose there is some sort of a plot mixed away in the screenplay, but it looks like someone cast 'blur' on that element of the film. Characterization? I suppose there was a hint of a romance between the hero and heroine (kissing and such, but nothing naughty), and yeah- there was the comic relief guy- who happened to be impaled and tossed off a wall much to the greater amusement of the audience. Other than that, your villains were obviously villains and your good guys were obviously good guys. Very black and white, plain, and childishly simple. Imagination? Naah.So we have a lot of dragons, I suppose, especially at the end. Boy was the firebreath flying in that part. Oddly enough, the city is still quite a city when they're done with their fireball frenzy. We should look up those architects for terror-proof buildings. The world is a completely new one, and no, that isn't a good thing. I have heard or read about a million suggestions that they redeem the D&amp;D license on the silver screen by making a movie adaptation of Icewind Dale. I heartily agree. Not only did this new world lack the development of Faerun, but everything you did see in it seemed no different.Onward to the D&amp;D aspects of it. If they had changed the title to something else, say- 'Attack of the Killer Fire-breathers,' you probably wouldn't be able to tell it was D&amp;D. Okay, so the guy tells the girl that she's just a 'low level mage.' Cute, but that's where the game ends and the follies begin. There's some magic here and there that's recognizable- the mages chucking their fireballs at the end, and the dimension door that 'low level mage' is somehow able to cast even though it's a 4th level spell, which requires... okay, enough of that. Poor Snails just gets buried, no 'raise dead' or 'resurrection' for him. Then again, who wanted him back?I found myself actually cheering for the bad guys, which was unfortunate because they were all idiots. At least they were less stupid than the heroes, though. You get the feeling they're evil, but only when they feel like it. Obviously, they aren't aware of the experience penalty a change of alignment incurs on their character. As for the confrontations between the good and evil, they are so cliche it is painful. The hero just has to give up the thing-that-ends-the-world for the life of his girlfriend, but then *gasp* the evildoer double-crosses him! He lied! Son of a- ! My, my, it looks like we're going to need a sword duel to settle this.So, here is the debut of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, that pinnacle of role playing games, now in movie format. If you haven't played the game before- or a computerized version of it- please do NOT think it's like the movie! No, it's really much better than that, because even the dumbest dungeon master in history could think up a more enjoyable adventure! For those of you that start shoveling popcorn the moment a special effect plays, maybe you'll get plenty of reconstituted butter sauce down on this one. Little kids, feel free to check it out, but unless your parents (heaven forbid) let you watch a PG-13 movie, you're probably going to have to wait until you come of age, and then you probably won't enjoy the movie anymore on account of your newfound measure of maturity. For those above age five, view at your own risk.

532956,A1ZQ73CSBW9XOI,B00003CXQM,"""zebisjeb""","[1, 1]","Just how sad can a movie based on a famous role playing game be? Sitting through this shameful excuse for an adventure/fantasy film was so sad, my eyes watered as if I was cutting onions for two hours straight. Dungeons &amp; Dragons was such an embarrassment in so many different areas, I should have kept a tally on how many times my cheeks blushed bright red! The only enjoyment I endured while watching this eye sore came from my mouth as I endlessly commented put-down after put-down. Here's a short list of cons I thought might help your decision of whether to watch or buy (or neither)...please notice, not a single pro is too been seen:1.) To Be Or Not To Be, It AIN'T: The acting in D&amp;D is so horrible (which caused 75% of my blushing), it makes Xena, Hercules, and campy fantasy/adventure shows alike, look like Shakespeare classics. If you dare watch the film, take notice to endless mugshots and smirks while delivering the cheesiest and entirely unoriginal dialouge and one-liners. The body language they use while delivering such lines as, &quot;Pick on somebody your own size!&quot;, urges you to yell at the screen, &quot;OH MY GOD THAT WAS LAME!&quot; with pride and not give a dang if you're once again yelling at the TV, like your grandmother, knowing the actors can't hear you.2.) Can you believe Jeremy Irons actually has an Oscar?: What's this guy doing in this atrosity? Something I find quite humorous is the fact that Irons is taking this evil mage role to heart, speaking in an accurate accent and such, all the while the rest of the cast isn't at all playing off it. Their poor acting, without the slightest idea of what genre/style of film they are in, makes Irons look like a fool and comes off as over-acting.3.) Wayans + girly screams + playing a kleptomaniac = What the heck? or possibly, &quot;Barf bag anyone?&quot;: Another unwise casting decision at the least, which seems to be the film's weakest link. Marlon can be a funnyman...in comedy movies. D&amp;D shouldn't need &quot;comic relief&quot;, nor should it contain it. Plus the fact that theives are swift, intelligent, and commonly naive. Marlon has one right. But come on! He's clumbsy, sharp as a butterknife, and worst of all annoying in this role. Though the actual game's theives are most commonly elvenkind, that doesn't matter too much. What chaps my rear is the weapons at Marlon's disposal. A sword?! Give me a break. That clumbsy goof would cut his own head off...which doesn't sound too bad an idea.4.) Plot? Really?! Where..?! Show me..!: I think that last sentence says it all. I got that notion in the first 10 minutes, and that's being generous considering 9 minutes was spent telling myself to not worry and that it could get better. That's the last time I listen to my Homer Simpson conscience.5.) Special Defects: That's right. I swear they had something, then they lost it. Towards the end of the film Red Dragons are fighting the Gold Dragons up in the sky. The whole time I'm wondering why are they concentrating on the foreground where the actors are instead of the background where the main event is taking place..? Until...they show me why. A close up on the dragon's head lies the truth...which is: they surely didn't hire on the same dude who did the DRAGONHEART films. These dragons and special (ugh) effects are an additional 10% of forceful blushing. After seeing these &quot;special effects&quot; I'm sure you'll say the same thing I did...&quot;I heard the movie only lasted in the theaters for about 4 weeks (give or take a week), which if you think about it, is 3 weeks more than what was spent on the &quot;special effects&quot;.&quot;6.) The DVD will gross more than it did at the box office, but that isn't saying much: I'm sure the extras on the D&amp;D DVD could sway somebody to buy it, plus hardcore D&amp;D fans will probably faithfully stand by in it's defense no matter how bad they thought it truely was. I however, will deny/decline to anyone who asks me if I've seen it, want to see it, or want to watch it with them. Special Editions are becoming the ultimate excuse for many bad movies, which in fact is what NEW LINE does quite often. The special extras may be a treat, and yes, NEW LINE does make quite the DVD when it comes to &quot;special editions&quot;, thus is where my 1 STAR rating comes into the picture. But after seeing this disaster, would you really want to watch the whole thing over just to hear a commentary? Then, since the DVD has two commentaries, would you really want to watch it again, just to hear the second commentary? If you did, I could guarantee this: Your eyes would burn, your ears would automatically go deaf 5 minutes into a commentary, your attention span would mimic that of an newborn kitten, and you will be staring at your own reflection in a puddle of your own (or someone else's, depending on how many people are watching with you) vomit that lays at your feet. Recommendation? Sure, I got one: Skip D&amp;D and save yourself the cash it costs for eyedrops, hearing aids, uppers, and most importantly kaopektate. (NOTE: The remaining blushing (15%) was caused by waking up the day after viewing D&amp;D, realizing it wasn't all just a horrendous nightmare.)",1,"There Are 2 O's In POOR, But How Many Are in
