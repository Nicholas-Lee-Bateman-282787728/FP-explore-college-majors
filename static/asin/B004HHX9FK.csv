Paul was always good at memorizing his lines in WWE but wasn't the best at acting them out. I always felt Dustin Rhodes is WWE's best actor, but regardless, he did ok. Ariel Winters did a good job aswell. The start of the film is a tad confusing, because we don't know why he was in jail and how he got there, but that is explained (sort of) in the end.Is it a family friendly movie? Well, that depends on what family you are showing it too. There is a little bit of violence and lots of guns.

1408281,AZ2YLC0GWTAH2,B004HHX9FK,D.P.,"[5, 5]","Triple H makes his WWE Studios debut as he plays Ray Bradstone who used to be a wheel-man for a group of bank robbers led by a man named Larue (Kevin Corrigan) but was caught & served a prison sentence where he rehabilitated himself via advice from a radio show & knowledgeable books.  He gets released with the goal to leave his past behind him, including refusing to be acknowledged by his past nickname of ""Ray Ray"", & set things right with his daughter Sally (Ariel Winter) & ex-wife Lynne (Annabeth Gish).  After the difficulties of being an ex-con in the real world effected Ray as his family kept telling him that they've moved on while he couldn't find a job & lost everything he had in a fire, he agreed to do another job with his old crew but had a change of heart at the last minute & ditched the crew during the robbery and stowaway on his daughter's class trip to New Orleans.  When the Larue & the robbers discover that Ray left them & the police chase them, one of the robbers drop the bag of money next to the school bus Ray is on by accident & it gets loaded on the bus that Ray just happens to be on making Larue think that Ray set them up to take the fall while he gets away with the money.  So while Ray uses this trip to try to reconnect with his daughter, he has to deal with so many other issues such as the trip's supervisor Ms. Miller (Yeardley Smith), Larue on his tail, the police also looking for Ray assuming that he was was part of the robbery, and dealing with the kids on this trip from the ""spoiled"" Paris Hilton type to a ""brainiac"" to a prankster.This was WWE Studios second attempt at a family comedy after Knucklehead with the difference here being that this was more humorous with the dialog more than just physical comedy.  One of the reviews for the movie stated that this movie is a modern day ""Kindergarten Cop"" which I have to agree with as it was a good overall family comedy that I enjoyed & would recommend for a viewing.",3,"""The Game"" Plays The Chaperone",1301097600,"03 26, 2011",2011,1967,"['Triple', 'H', 'WWE', 'Studios', 'debut', 'Ray', 'Bradstone', 'who', 'used', 'be', 'wheel-man', 'group', 'bank', 'robbers', 'led', 'man', 'named', 'Larue', 'Kevin', 'Corrigan', 'was', 'caught', 'served', 'prison', 'sentence', 'where', 'rehabilitated', 'advice', 'radio', 'show', 'knowledgeable', 'books', 'released', 'goal', 'leave', 'past', 'including', 'refusing', 'be', 'acknowledged', 'past', 'nickname', 'Ray', 'Ray', 'set', 'things', 'right', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'Ariel', 'Winter', 'ex-wife', 'Lynne', 'Annabeth', 'Gish', 'difficulties', 'being', 'ex-con', 'real', 'world', 'effected', 'Ray', 'family', 'kept', 'telling', ""'ve"", 'moved', 'could', ""n't"", 'find', 'job', 'lost', 'everything', 'had', 'fire', 'agreed', 'do', 'job', 'old', 'crew', 'had', 'change', 'heart', 'last', 'minute', 'ditched', 'crew', 'robbery', 'stowaway', 'daughter', 'class', 'trip', 'New', 'Orleans', 'When', 'Larue', 'robbers', 'discover', 'Ray', 'left', 'police', 'chase', 'one', 'robbers', 'drop', 'bag', 'money', 'school', 'bus', 'Ray', 'accident', 'loaded', 'bus', 'Ray', 'just', 'be', 'making', 'Larue', 'think', 'Ray', 'set', 'up', 'take', 'fall', 'away', 'money', 'So', 'Ray', 'trip', 'try', 'reconnect', 'daughter', 'deal', 'so', 'many', 'other', 'issues', 'such', 'trip', 'supervisor', 'Ms.', 'Miller', 'Yeardley', 'Smith', 'Larue', 'tail', 'police', 'also', 'looking', 'Ray', 'assuming', 'was', 'was', 'part', 'robbery', 'dealing', 'kids', 'trip', 'spoiled', 'Paris', 'Hilton', 'type', 'brainiac', 'prankster.This', 'was', 'WWE', 'Studios', 'second', 'attempt', 'family', 'comedy', 'Knucklehead', 'difference', 'here', 'being', 'was', 'more', 'humorous', 'dialog', 'more', 'just', 'physical', 'comedy', 'One', 'reviews', 'movie', 'stated', 'movie', 'modern', 'day', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'have', 'agree', 'was', 'good', 'overall', 'family', 'comedy', 'enjoyed', 'would', 'recommend', 'viewing']",The Chaperone

This one was the first one to star Triple H and over all it was good. This is a great one for kids as it has that classic family film vibe to it. This like other WWE movies suffered from the stigma that is wrestling attached to it. That really isn't fair because it stands well on its own, especially as a family comedy. Not a classic like some others in the genre but it is still a good film.Ray Bradstone (Triple H) is fresh out of prison and is looking to reconnect with his daughter Sally (Ariel Winter). The only thing is his daughter wants nothing to do with him. She felt abandoned by him when he was sent away to prison after a failed robbery. Ray's former partners want him back in the gang as their get away driver. After a string of bad events he is lured back into that life. But at the last minute he bails on the plan and joins his daughter on their field trip. As luck would have it the robbers plant the bag of stolen money on the bus. Thus setting up a fun family ride as the robbers are on the chase, and Ray is trying to reconnect with his daughter.I enjoyed this movie more so than I thought I was going to, my brother and I thought it was funny and good family flick. Triple H may have a way to go as far as an actor but he does a pretty good job here. You can tell he had a good time while making this movie and had a good time with his co stars. Speaking of co stars Ariel Winter was good as his daughter in this film and her behind the scenes stuff was really good. Also she can really sing and provides for the soundtrack. Kevin Corrigan and his partner in the film are funny as is Yeardley Smith and the guy trying to get with her. But of course the kids are the real stars of this along side Triple H and they all do a fine job here.Written by first time screenwriter [it seems] S.J. Roth and directed by Stephen Herek [who has directed films you have seen] this actually tuned out to be a good flick. It is in that same vein of films like ""Kindergarten Cop"" and such. That seems to be the one every one compares this too, and it is in that same category. It has some good special features on it as well. Like a good commentary track with Triple H, Yeardley Smith, and Ariel Winter, full of some funny stories. There is also a lot of behind the scenes features and a music video from Ariel. Over all this was a good film from the WWE, while not the best it was still good. I would highly recommend this to any one looking for a good family film.",4,GOOD FAMILY FILM,1322179200,"11 25, 2011",2011,2607,"['CHAPERONEI', 'have', 'honestly', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'WWE', 'films', 'productions', 'thus', 'far', 'am', 'happy', 'say', 'enjoyed', 'one', 'as', 'well', 'one', 'was', 'first', 'one', 'star', 'Triple', 'H', 'was', 'good', 'great', 'one', 'kids', 'classic', 'family', 'film', 'vibe', 'other', 'WWE', 'movies', 'suffered', 'stigma', 'wrestling', 'attached', 'really', ""n't"", 'fair', 'well', 'own', 'especially', 'family', 'comedy', 'Not', 'classic', 'others', 'genre', 'still', 'good', 'film.Ray', 'Bradstone', 'Triple', 'H', 'fresh', 'prison', 'looking', 'reconnect', 'daughter', 'Sally', 'Ariel', 'Winter', 'only', 'thing', 'daughter', 'nothing', 'do', 'felt', 'abandoned', 'when', 'was', 'sent', 'away', 'prison', 'failed', 'robbery', 'Ray', 'former', 'partners', 'want', 'back', 'gang', 'get', 'away', 'driver', 'string', 'bad', 'events', 'lured', 'back', 'life', 'last', 'minute', 'plan', 'daughter', 'field', 'trip', 'luck', 'would', 'have', 'robbers', 'plant', 'bag', 'stolen', 'money', 'bus', 'Thus', 'setting', 'up', 'fun', 'family', 'ride', 'robbers', 'are', 'chase', 'Ray', 'trying', 'reconnect', 'daughter.I', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'so', 'thought', 'was', 'going', 'brother', 'thought', 'was', 'funny', 'good', 'family', 'flick', 'Triple', 'H', 'may', 'have', 'way', 'go', 'as', 'far', 'actor', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'here', 'can', 'tell', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'making', 'movie', 'had', 'good', 'time', 'co', 'stars', 'Speaking', 'co', 'stars', 'Ariel', 'Winter', 'was', 'good', 'daughter', 'film', 'scenes', 'stuff', 'was', 'really', 'good', 'Also', 'can', 'really', 'sing', 'soundtrack', 'Kevin', 'Corrigan', 'partner', 'film', 'are', 'funny', 'Yeardley', 'Smith', 'guy', 'trying', 'get', 'course', 'kids', 'are', 'real', 'stars', 'along', 'side', 'Triple', 'H', 'do', 'fine', 'job', 'here.Written', 'first', 'time', 'screenwriter', '[', ']', 'S.J', 'Roth', 'directed', 'Stephen', 'Herek', '[', 'who', 'directed', 'films', 'have', 'seen', 'actually', 'tuned', 'out', 'be', 'good', 'flick', 'same', 'vein', 'films', 'Kindergarten', 'Cop', 'such', 'be', 'one', 'one', 'too', 'same', 'category', 'good', 'special', 'features', 'as', 'well', 'good', 'commentary', 'track', 'Triple', 'H', 'Yeardley', 'Smith', 'Ariel', 'Winter', 'full', 'funny', 'stories', 'also', 'lot', 'scenes', 'features', 'music', 'video', 'Ariel', 'was', 'good', 'film', 'WWE', 'not', 'best', 'was', 'still', 'good', 'would', 'highly', 'recommend', 'one', 'looking', 'good', 'family', 'film']",The Chaperone

This one here stars Jean-Paul ""Triple-H"" Levisgue (however its spelled) who is just released from prison, and the first thing he does is asks a friend to drive... wait, wasn't that the exact same opening to The Games' other movie ""Inside Out""?, it's like Hunter must have it in his contract that he will not make a movie unless he is freshly released from prison, and drives a friends car once he's out? Anyway... The Cerebral Assassin's been on the inside and talking to some radio doctor and explaining to her that once he's out, he will get his wife and kid back in his life and a be a better man.
