My friend and I had an argument and he gave it back, and I thought &#34;Figures. He knows I hated that movie.&#34; So it sat on my shelve collecting dust until just a week ago when I got so bored for something to watch I took it out and played it again. This time I watched the whole movie. It starts out like an annoying documentary with the actors giving commentary on their experiences with using Ecstacy My first thought was, &#34;Who the ^*&^ cares?&#34; And then when this commentary carried on halfway through the movie, &#34;What the %$(^?&#34; But I was so bored that I was willing to sit through even this and I must admit, people are right when they say &#34;Good things come to those who wait.&#34; Or at least it was right this time. It has a really slow build up but if you too can be patient, you will not regret it.",3,This actually turned out a lot better than I thought it was,1386806400,"12 12, 2013",2013,973,"['actually', 'turned', 'out', 'lot', 'better', 'thought', 'was', 'had', 'actually', 'quit', 'watching', 'got', 'mad', 'movie', 'gave', 'away', 'friend', 'friend', 'had', 'argument', 'gave', 'back', 'thought', '34', 'Figures', 'hated', 'movie.', '34', 'sat', 'shelve', 'collecting', 'dust', 'just', 'week', 'when', 'got', 'so', 'bored', 'something', 'watch', 'took', 'out', 'played', 'again', 'time', 'watched', 'whole', 'movie', 'out', 'annoying', 'documentary', 'actors', 'giving', 'commentary', 'experiences', 'using', 'Ecstacy', 'My', 'first', 'thought', 'was', '34', 'Who', '^*', '^', '34', 'then', 'when', 'commentary', 'carried', 'halfway', 'movie', '34', 'What', '%', '^', '34', 'was', 'so', 'bored', 'was', 'willing', 'sit', 'even', 'must', 'admit', 'people', 'are', 'right', 'when', 'say', '34', 'Good', 'things', 'come', 'who', 'wait.', '34', 'least', 'was', 'right', 'time', 'really', 'slow', 'build', 'up', 'too', 'can', 'be', 'patient', 'will', 'not', 'regret']",Rolling
1234498,A3EXWV8FNSSFL6,B001RXB4Q8,Daniel G. Lebryk,"[0, 0]","Rolling is a dramatic film dressed up to look like a documentary about a group of heavy ecstasy users. Each character is introduced through an interview. They each seem to be unrelated to eachother. But as the film plays out - surprise, surprise - they end up connected in some way. Each act of the movie is about some aspect of ecstasy. I learned all the new words, that had interesting ecstasy use meaning. I learned how to and how to not buy the drug. What to do when you don't have money to buy the drug. What the etiquette is for sharing or not sharing the drug. How the drug will make me feel. Where I should take the drug. And what kinds of parties are the best for getting the drug.If it sounds a bit like a drug lesson, that's pretty accurate. The director also tried to use visual clues for how a person might feel when taking the drug. It was all horribly cliched camera techniques - blurry slow shutter effect, ultrafast motion, choppy video, blurry focus or fuzzy views, and bright colors. Frankly the drug movies of the 60's and 70's did a better job of creating this feeling.This film is just way too predictible. There are absolutely no surprises. The characters are just plain old annoying. I was so tired of listening to Rain complain about life and being miserable and pregnant. Summer had gorgeous eyes, but stupid self-centered words came out of her mouth. The blond guy that was supposed to be gay and a cross dresser, at least had some decent things to say. But he kept falling in and out of character and there was a very long moment of him putting on women's clothes, but when he goes out he's dressed in jeans and a little top. Clinton was just a dumb pig when he spoke. The older African American guy tried to sound like Tim Meadows, but was just dumb.There wasn't a single character that I felt any connection with. This was a big group of people that spend an hour and a half figuring out how to buy ecstasy and then go to a rave party to take the drug. That's it, the film was nothing more. All very boring and mostly annoying.From a technical standpoint, the director bought his film stock from a bargain bin somewhere. There were extremely underexposed and grainy shots butted up against fine grain perfectly exposed shots. The filming was bright and colorful, I will admit that as a positive.If you are a huge fan of this drug, are potentially a bit addicted to it, and go to parties every night; then this film is absolutely perfect for you. Maybe you would like a bit of drug culture education; yes this film might help. If you're moderately normal, this film will bore you to no end.The film appears to be not rated. Please don't subject younger viewers to this movie. There's no nudity, although that would have added a level of interest in this film. There's strong language. And surprise, there's a ton of drug use. So parents be aware.Its not so awful it is one star. But it is a bad movie.",1,A Bad Movie,1252540800,"09 10, 2009",2009,2930,"['Rolling', 'dramatic', 'film', 'dressed', 'up', 'look', 'documentary', 'group', 'heavy', 'ecstasy', 'users', 'character', 'introduced', 'interview', 'seem', 'be', 'unrelated', 'eachother', 'film', 'out', 'surprise', 'surprise', 'end', 'up', 'connected', 'way', 'act', 'movie', 'aspect', 'ecstasy', 'learned', 'new', 'words', 'had', 'interesting', 'ecstasy', 'use', 'meaning', 'learned', 'how', 'how', 'not', 'buy', 'drug', 'What', 'do', 'when', 'do', ""n't"", 'have', 'money', 'buy', 'drug', 'What', 'etiquette', 'sharing', 'not', 'sharing', 'drug', 'How', 'drug', 'will', 'make', 'feel', 'Where', 'should', 'take', 'drug', 'what', 'kinds', 'parties', 'are', 'best', 'getting', 'drug.If', 'bit', 'drug', 'lesson', 'pretty', 'accurate', 'director', 'also', 'tried', 'use', 'visual', 'clues', 'how', 'person', 'might', 'feel', 'when', 'taking', 'drug', 'was', 'horribly', 'cliched', 'camera', 'blurry', 'slow', 'shutter', 'effect', 'ultrafast', 'motion', 'choppy', 'video', 'blurry', 'focus', 'fuzzy', 'views', 'bright', 'colors', 'Frankly', 'drug', 'movies', '60', '70', 'did', 'better', 'job', 'creating', 'feeling.This', 'film', 'just', 'way', 'too', 'predictible', 'are', 'absolutely', 'surprises', 'characters', 'are', 'just', 'plain', 'old', 'annoying', 'was', 'so', 'tired', 'listening', 'Rain', 'complain', 'life', 'being', 'miserable', 'pregnant', 'Summer', 'had', 'gorgeous', 'eyes', 'stupid', 'self-centered', 'words', 'came', 'mouth', 'blond', 'guy', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'gay', 'cross', 'dresser', 'least', 'had', 'decent', 'things', 'say', 'kept', 'falling', 'character', 'was', 'very', 'long', 'moment', 'putting', 'women', 'clothes', 'when', 'out', 'dressed', 'jeans', 'little', 'top', 'Clinton', 'was', 'just', 'dumb', 'pig', 'when', 'spoke', 'older', 'African', 'American', 'guy', 'tried', 'sound', 'Tim', 'Meadows', 'was', 'just', 'dumb.There', 'was', ""n't"", 'single', 'character', 'felt', 'connection', 'was', 'big', 'group', 'people', 'spend', 'hour', 'half', 'figuring', 'out', 'how', 'buy', 'ecstasy', 'then', 'go', 'rave', 'party', 'take', 'drug', 'film', 'was', 'nothing', 'more', 'very', 'boring', 'mostly', 'technical', 'standpoint', 'director', 'bought', 'film', 'stock', 'bargain', 'bin', 'somewhere', 'were', 'extremely', 'underexposed', 'grainy', 'shots', 'butted', 'up', 'fine', 'grain', 'perfectly', 'exposed', 'shots', 'filming', 'was', 'bright', 'colorful', 'will', 'admit', 'positive.If', 'are', 'huge', 'fan', 'drug', 'are', 'potentially', 'bit', 'addicted', 'go', 'parties', 'night', 'then', 'film', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'Maybe', 'would', 'like', 'bit', 'drug', 'culture', 'education', 'film', 'might', 'help', ""'re"", 'moderately', 'normal', 'film', 'will', 'bore', 'end.The', 'film', 'be', 'not', 'rated', 'Please', 'do', ""n't"", 'subject', 'younger', 'viewers', 'movie', 'nudity', 'would', 'have', 'added', 'level', 'interest', 'film', 'strong', 'language', 'surprise', 'ton', 'drug', 'use', 'parents', 'be', 'aware.Its', 'not', 'so', 'awful', 'one', 'star', 'bad', 'movie']",Rolling

WTF??? did i just spend actual money on this???!! But then when they all go to the rave the movie starts to come alive and becomes interesting, there's great music and the characters make u laugh, there's definitely drama in the end but overall its not too bad, the rave part is really good.

1234500,A19ZXK9HHVRV1X,B001RXB4Q8,Roland E. Zwick,"[2, 2]","**1/2""Rolling"" is a low-budget independent film focused on a handful of young Angelenos who have all had experience with the drug Ecstasy.  Done in the style of a you-are-there docudrama, the movie alternates between traditional dramatic sequences and staged interviews with the characters who speak directly to the camera about the drug and the effect it's had on their lives.  (The term ""rolling"" refers to the high one gets when tripping on the drug).The movie certainly means well, and there are definitely some lessons to be learned from the characters' experiences.  And, in all fairness, director/co-writer Billy Samoa Saleebey doesn't engage in quite as much melodramatic finger-wagging as the material might have warranted.  But the amateurishness of the execution - the jittery, handheld camera, the time-lapse psychedelics, the unconvincing performances, the lackluster writing - robs the movie of much of its impact.  Somehow, when all the characters do is party and talk about partying, there isn't much room for them to grow and develop into compelling and engaging figures.  As a result, we become detached observers rather than fully engaged participants in the scene - and that, given the urgency of the subject matter, is simply unacceptable.",2,well-intentioned but leaden social drama,1273622400,"05 12, 2010",2010,1260,"['**1/2', 'Rolling', 'low-budget', 'independent', 'film', 'focused', 'handful', 'young', 'Angelenos', 'who', 'have', 'had', 'experience', 'drug', 'Ecstasy', 'Done', 'style', 'you-are-there', 'docudrama', 'movie', 'traditional', 'dramatic', 'sequences', 'staged', 'interviews', 'characters', 'who', 'speak', 'directly', 'camera', 'drug', 'effect', 'had', 'lives', 'term', 'rolling', 'refers', 'high', 'one', 'when', 'tripping', 'drug', 'movie', 'certainly', 'well', 'are', 'definitely', 'lessons', 'be', 'learned', 'characters', 'experiences', 'fairness', 'director/co-writer', 'Billy', 'Samoa', 'Saleebey', ""n't"", 'engage', 'quite', 'much', 'melodramatic', 'finger-wagging', 'material', 'might', 'have', 'warranted', 'amateurishness', 'execution', 'jittery', 'handheld', 'camera', 'time-lapse', 'psychedelics', 'unconvincing', 'performances', 'lackluster', 'writing', 'robs', 'movie', 'much', 'impact', 'Somehow', 'when', 'characters', 'do', 'party', 'talk', 'partying', ""n't"", 'much', 'room', 'grow', 'develop', 'compelling', 'engaging', 'figures', 'result', 'become', 'detached', 'observers', 'rather', 'fully', 'engaged', 'participants', 'scene', 'given', 'urgency', 'subject', 'matter', 'simply', 'unacceptable']",Rolling
