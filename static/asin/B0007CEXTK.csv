This was such a great show, every one having a moral to it and lesson on how to treat our fellow man or animal.  The only disappointment is the cursing in the show.  It is gratuitous and unnecessary.  So, if you don't mind up to 7 or 8 hell's and damn's and a few ""oh my G - - "" in the episodes then I'd buy it.  For us, we'd rather not listen to it and won't purchase another season.  Such a shame, it is a wonderful show!!  I guess Michael Landon (who is one of my favorites) was trying to prove he was not really an angel and attract others by adding in the language.  It isn't needed and takes away from the show.........especially one with Heaven right in the title.  That being said.....I loved A Divine Madness and the Pilot episode.  We were all disappointed in the episode A Child Of God where a preacher states that you don't have to belive in God to get to heaven, God is not looking for recognition.

I have wanted to purchase Highway to Heaven for a long time but it has been for sale at astronomical prices, so when amazon had the first season for $12.99 I jumped on it. This DVD set was put out by Mill Creek.NO subtitles. I doubt there is closed captioned either but I have no way of knowing.  The DVD's are in paper sleeves in one big stack. My BIGGEST complaint (next to no subtitles) is the picture is DISTORTED. It looks like it was filmed widescreen and no compensation. Everything is squished down and wide, so Mill Creek really screwed up and didn't fix the ratio somehow.Obviously this has not been digitally corrected in picture or sound.

We want our children to see what real T.V. and good T.V. shows really are and because we love this T.V. series, its clean fun and inspiration! Great for family time! We cut the cord on cable and now view TV though our DVD collection or watch though Netflix on our Roku. We just grew tired of paying for paid TV with nothing good to watch.We could not find this show on Netflix and decided to purchase this set individually as it was more affordable to purchase that way. Which is okay for us as we like to take our DVD's with us while on the road as it makes for some fun times. This has also come in handy when we are out and have to wait for long periods of time..So back to the reason we went ahead and purchased this collection. Due to the garbage on T.V. these days, looks like many people are looking for great T.V. shows and are turning to shows like this again. Many people are tired of paying for trash T.V. so they have found other ways to view T.V. the way they want to. Looks like this is the growing attitudes with paid for TV these days.. And I know many like this show so it is in demand!Anyway, our family loves this show and glad that we were still able to find this show for a decent price.. We don't want to spend too much money out of our budget. We are just glad to be able to watch T.V. the way we want to and not have to pay for crap TV. We are tired of today's T.V. shows.. It's really sad that such a good method of influence has turned into trash T.V with the exception of National Geo, Animal plant etc.. Any way, if you want clean T.V. this is it!I can say since we cut cable off we have a better free life.. seems like we have more family time and time to do the things that we want to do. Plus we pay for the shows that we want like The Cosby show and Touched by an Angel since it is not on Netflix. I am glad that this T.V. series is available on Amazon.This T.V. Series teaches a lot of great lessons and also entertains you.. Miss those days of shows like this. So if you are looking for clean great family fun, this show is for you.. You will not be disappointed. Our children love this show!If you are looking for more shows and T.V. like this, try Sky Angel Fave T.V. you will find so many great shows similar to High Way To Heaven and Touched By An Angel.Happy viewing! Can't wait until the rest of the DVD's are released. We need real T.V. to come back.. We will not pay for paid for T.V. with all of the trash that is on it.We will update once we receive all of the seasons as we have ordered seasons 1-3 because we want moral T.V. to watch.. and because we love this show.*********update******we received our order and all three seasons are great!

879624,ABAZFH25304ZG,B0007CEXTK,John M Spangler,"[16, 17]","If anyone can pull off being an Angel on television is Charles Ingalls, err, I mean Michael Landon. Charles Ingalls from Little House, or Johnothan Smith from Highway To Heaven. He was amazing in both roles, but I really like the thought of Landon being an Angel and Highway To Heaven is the way to go from that standpoint! Landon inspired us all as being being the most inspirational father (Charles Ingalls) on the beloved Little House on the Prairie series. But thankfully after the ""New Beginning"" aired, he decided to take his talents to his own show, Highway To Heaven. Make no mistake, this series rocks. Landon always seem to have a spirit that brings the heart home and mangages to tearjerk my girlfriend everytime he goes on-screen. Victor French along for the ride is just the icing on the cake for the series as the both of them seem to mesh as they did so well on Little House.Landon's talents are endless as he proved for years. As he did with Little House, he wrote, produced, directed and of course acted throughout Highway to Heaven as playing an angel to help people. While some of the stories are a bit iffy, it strives with wonderful acting, tearjerks throughout and of course Landon is just fun to watch as being the perfect Angel sent down from heaven to help people cope with their problems.  While I was still very young when this series started in the 80's, I'm not aware of the edits and cuts they made for the DVD collection. But nonetheless, this is great stuff and Landon is the perfect Angel and I wish stuff like this was still on TV. This is something I want my kids to watch, and knowing this is Landon before he dies, it's just that much more touching to the heart. Victor French also died shortly after the series which is a sad ending to the series in reality, but the stay was worth everything.

Ouellette ""ljoyce12""","[75, 80]","""Highway to Heaven"" is one of my all-time favorite television programs so I was pleased to learn about the DVD release of Season One.  Michael Landon and Victor French shared a great friendship as Jonathan and Mark and their scenes together are priceless.  It's too bad that many of them have been cut from this collection as these are the syndicated episodes of ""Highway to Heaven"".I have two of these episodes on old VHS tapes.  When they aired on NBC-TV, the episode ""Going Home, Going Home"" was approximately two minutes longer than its DVD counterpart; ""Another Song for Christmas"" was approximately three minutes longer.  Think about this:  If each show is missing between two to three minutes and you multiply this by the season total of 24 episodes, you get the equivalent of one missing hour of programming!  And for the most part, the scenes dropped are those memorable buddy moments between Jonathan and Mark.The syndicated episodes of ""Highway to Heaven"" closed with a tag for Genesis Entertainment.  On the back cover of the DVD box is a logo for Genesis International.  It would seem, presumably, that these are the same entity.All I can say regarding this DVD set is that I'm glad I kept my 20 year old VHS copies of ""Highway to Heaven"".  I have scenes that others will NEVER see and that's unfortunate.  Mr. Landon's work was the best thing that ever happened to television and it should also be the best thing that ever happened to TV on DVD.

One is an angel named Jonathan Smith and is partner is Mark Gordon an ex-cop from Oakland.  I like that this shows that there are people out there willing to help no matter what the cost and helping brings people together like nothing else can.

Michael Landon became a master of orchestrating stories of sentiment, feeling, and genuine love.

Landon proved that there isn't any way to be too sentimental when it comes down to treating people with love and respect.I loved Highway to Heaven when it was on television for its great, heart-felt stories...of people in need, people who felt that nobody loved or wanted them, people who felt lost and confused...Landon's Jonathan Smith and companion Mark Gordon spread a little light around to those people.One nice thing about watching this show...you always felt good at the end of the episode.",5,Landon brought heart to television,1114905600,"05 1, 2005",2005,977,"['Something', 'do', ""n't"", 'really', 'find', 'television', 'today', 'heart', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'became', 'master', 'orchestrating', 'stories', 'sentiment', 'feeling', 'genuine', 'love', 'Ever', 'Little', 'House', 'Praire', 'used', 'elements', 'help', 'people', 'realize', 'love', 'world', ""n't"", 'people', 'DO', 'care.I', 'truly', 'believe', 'Michael', 'Landon', 'was', 'man', 'creating', 'television', 'was', 'ahead', 'time', 'People', 'often', 'scoff', 'series', 'being', 'too', 'sentimental', 'Landon', 'proved', ""n't"", 'way', 'be', 'too', 'sentimental', 'when', 'down', 'treating', 'people', 'love', 'respect.I', 'loved', 'Highway', 'Heaven', 'when', 'was', 'television', 'great', 'heart-felt', 'stories', 'people', 'need', 'people', 'who', 'felt', 'nobody', 'loved', 'wanted', 'people', 'who', 'felt', 'lost', 'confused', 'Landon', 'Jonathan', 'Smith', 'companion', 'Mark', 'Gordon', 'spread', 'little', 'light', 'people.One', 'nice', 'thing', 'watching', 'show', 'always', 'felt', 'good', 'end', 'episode']",Highway to Heaven - Season One
