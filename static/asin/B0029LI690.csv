1256909,ANCOMAI0I7LVG,B0029LI690,Andrew Ellington,"[3, 4]","I admit, I kind of liked the first `Chipmunks' movie.  It was harmless fun.  Having grown up on the cartoon and really loved some of the movies as a kid, I was secretly excited to see this and so when I was forced to watch it on a long car-ride with my girls, I was happy.  It was funny; borderline stupid but funny.  I wasn't moved to see any of the sequels though.  It's not like the first movie was a revelation, and usually when a decent but dumb kids movie has a sequel, it is a mess.Alas, this came on TV and my daughter went crazy and I was forced to watch it.`Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakuel' is a total mess.  It has a very clich&eacute;d premise that continues to deliver one poorly conceived joke or plot point after another.  The gags feel recycled from the original film with less gusto, and the regurgitated use of David Cross (who is a terrible actor and should be homeless on the street by now) is irritating.  Jason Lee is replaced by Zachary Levi (my only guess is that Lee had scheduling conflicts and so his character was given minimal scenes) and the Chipmunks are dropped in school where teenage girls can swoon over them and teenage boys and become jealous.  I'm being serious.  The teenage boys actually think that these rodents are going to steal the girls away from them to the point where they give them swirlies and threaten to beat them up and stage ridiculous pranks (the trash monitor thing was particularly unfunny) to make them feel embarrassed.  While this is going on, the Chipettes show up and Ian, the evil manager from the first film, swoops them up in order to make money for himself and the Chipmunks and the Chipettes have a sing off while Alvin battles his priorities.And LOL at that horribly annoying girl from the Taco Cabana commercials being in this movie!UGH, this was awful.  It was just dumb from start to finish and a terrible excuse for children's entertainment.  I have no problem letting my girls watch movies that are beneath me as an adult because they are kids and one cannot expect them to appreciate films directed at adults, but children's films can be smart and engaging and enjoyable for all ages, and this is just NOT.  Also,  I found the Chipette's suggestive gyrating to be sending a very poor message to my four year old.Seriously.",1,Squeak; I choked!,1339977600,"06 18, 2012",2012,2303,"['admit', 'kind', 'liked', 'first', 'Chipmunks', 'movie', 'was', 'harmless', 'fun', 'Having', 'grown', 'up', 'cartoon', 'really', 'loved', 'movies', 'kid', 'was', 'secretly', 'excited', 'see', 'so', 'when', 'was', 'forced', 'watch', 'long', 'car-ride', 'girls', 'was', 'happy', 'was', 'funny', 'borderline', 'stupid', 'funny', 'was', ""n't"", 'moved', 'see', 'sequels', 'not', 'first', 'movie', 'was', 'revelation', 'usually', 'when', 'decent', 'dumb', 'kids', 'movie', 'sequel', 'mess.Alas', 'came', 'TV', 'daughter', 'went', 'crazy', 'was', 'forced', 'watch', 'it.', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'Squeakuel', 'total', 'mess', 'very', 'clich', 'eacute', 'premise', 'deliver', 'one', 'poorly', 'conceived', 'joke', 'plot', 'point', 'gags', 'feel', 'recycled', 'original', 'film', 'less', 'gusto', 'regurgitated', 'use', 'David', 'Cross', 'who', 'terrible', 'actor', 'should', 'be', 'homeless', 'street', 'now', 'irritating', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'replaced', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'only', 'guess', 'Lee', 'had', 'scheduling', 'conflicts', 'so', 'character', 'was', 'given', 'minimal', 'scenes', 'Chipmunks', 'are', 'dropped', 'school', 'where', 'teenage', 'girls', 'can', 'swoon', 'teenage', 'boys', 'become', 'jealous', ""'m"", 'being', 'serious', 'teenage', 'actually', 'think', 'rodents', 'are', 'going', 'steal', 'girls', 'away', 'point', 'where', 'give', 'swirlies', 'threaten', 'beat', 'up', 'stage', 'ridiculous', 'pranks', 'trash', 'monitor', 'thing', 'was', 'particularly', 'unfunny', 'make', 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'going', 'Chipettes', 'show', 'up', 'Ian', 'evil', 'manager', 'first', 'film', 'up', 'order', 'make', 'money', 'Chipmunks', 'Chipettes', 'have', 'sing', 'off', 'Alvin', 'priorities.And', 'LOL', 'horribly', 'annoying', 'girl', 'Taco', 'Cabana', 'commercials', 'being', 'movie', 'UGH', 'was', 'awful', 'was', 'just', 'dumb', 'start', 'finish', 'terrible', 'excuse', 'children', 'entertainment', 'have', 'problem', 'letting', 'girls', 'watch', 'movies', 'are', 'beneath', 'adult', 'are', 'kids', 'one', 'can', 'not', 'expect', 'appreciate', 'films', 'directed', 'adults', 'children', 'films', 'can', 'be', 'smart', 'engaging', 'enjoyable', 'ages', 'just', 'NOT', 'Also', 'found', 'Chipette', 'suggestive', 'gyrating', 'be', 'sending', 'very', 'poor', 'message', 'four', 'year', 'old.Seriously']",N/A

1256913,A2582KMXLK2P06,B0029LI690,B. E Jackson,"[1, 1]","The Squeakquel is probably a tad better than the first Alvin and the Chipmunks if for no other reason than because the first one is all about showing us what it's like to see animated chipmunks interacting with real humans in a real environment, so it mainly keeps things simple focusing around Dave, the chipmunks getting into constant trouble, and keeps things closer to home for the most part.The sequel... oh alright, FINE!  I'll say it again- the Squeakquel, is less about Dave (who only makes a couple brief appearances) and more about the chipmunks going to a public school with teenagers.  While there, they join a music class and a football team, and even participate in a dodgeball match.The female chipmunks are definitely hilarious, and are basically the same as the regular familiar gang of Alvin, Theodore and Simon.The storyline is about the chipmunks (including the three girls) getting the opportunity to perform on stage and put up a sing and dance show for the audience.  Of course obstacles happen to come along and stand in the way of achieving such an amazing dream.The humor is about the same as the first movie, so if the first one drove you delightfully crazy, this one will as well, haha.I really have nothing but positive things to say about the sequel.  It's just as outrageous and hilarious as the first one with a storyline that packs excitement, sincerity and even a little bit of character development involving Simon and Alvin getting into a personal conflict over school matters.A great movie for everybody in the house, this is sure to make everyone crave for a third film in the series.  The only negative is that the lack of Dave means a lot less ""ALVIN!!!!!""That's the only complaint, truthfully.

1256915,A25HYPL2XKQPZB,B0029LI690,Bill Garrison,"[4, 13]","I certainly didn't intend to watch the first Alvin and the Chipmunks movie, but as my kids watched it, I found parts of it to be humorous and enjoyable. Dave Seville, played by Jason Lee of MY NAME IS EARL fame, was perhaps the best part for the adults. It was fun to watch his interactions with his furry little singing friends. Then the sequel came along. I didn't want to see it, but went along with the family for a Christmas outing.The first thing wrong is that Jason Lee and Dave Seville is not in this movie at all except for the first five minutes and last five minutes. Why? What did he have to do that was so important? So, when he's in it, he's doing his trademark ""Aaalllvvviiinnn"" yell as much as possible. The rest of the movie is horrible. The chipmunks are sent to high school where the jocks feel immediately threatened by them. The three rodents get involved with different groups and all kinds of ""hilarious"" hijinks ensue. And then the Chipettes show up. They bring nothing to the movie either.David Cross as Ian is back as well. He was funny in the first, but his act grows old in the second. As the credits rolled, I saw all kinds of famous people like Justin Long, Anna Farris and Amy Polhler lent their voices to the Chipmunks. Why?As it is with most kid movies, your kids will probably enjoy watching it once. But for the adults, it will be one of the worst movies you will ever see.",1,Bad movie!

But I slowly began to hate it because it seemed like everywhere I went, the movie was playing! It got annoying, there are only so many times you can here the Chipmunk Christmas song.Now when I saw the teaser for the second movie with my family, we all laughed at it, and I automatically knew I wanted to see it. The first one may have been annoying at times, but this one was going to have the chipettes in it, so it should be a little bit better (I've always been a chipettes fan), and.... I was right.This movie was way better than the first one. It had humor, action, and some good lessons about family and friends. And the chipmunk romance made me smile. I liked the songs too, especially the songs the chipettes sang. The song at the end, ""We Are Family"" was so catchy, I uploaded it to my iPod a week later!I loved it, and if you need another reason to see it, my 7 year old cousin enjoyed it too.

The producers could've really saved money by just getting the same people to do the talking and singing voices and nobody would've been able to hear the difference. Like Dakota Fanning in New Moon, I hope Jason Lee was well paid for about his fifteen minutes of screen time but the character should've been written out entirely if all they were going to use him for was uninspired slapstick that wasn't even funny when I saw it in Son of the Pink Panther. I do wish that each of the Chipettes got to interact with their male counterparts but the Simon-esque Chipette hardly features at all (the Theodore girl features a little more but they're mainly just background when compared to the lead and if it weren't for the sake of having all three characters, they could've done the whole movie without them). I do remember watching the cartoon series in the 90s, it wasn't my favorite thing (I think Pokemon or Power Rangers was the ""in thing"" at the moment but for the life of me I can't remember) but it was still enjoyable. One reason I probably remember enjoying it over this mess was the fact that the Chimpmunks and their female knock-offs were about the size of a small child and attend school. Not the literal size of the animal and still attend school! There's suspension of disbelief and then there's shear stupidity! How can anyone believe that actual chipmunks could go to school and be immediately accepted without the Board of Health getting involved? The CGI is unconvincing (but not outright silly looking as the blue cat things in Avatar) and makes me respect the puppetry and miniatures used in films past (like the older Bond films, Little Shop of Horrors, Batman, Superman, etc.) The plot is a rehash of the first, just with the inclusion of the Chipettes, but is actually not as obvious, like Blues Brothers 1998- er I mean 2000. Another thing that bugs me (but actually more against the first than this); how did the soundtrack to that beat out Sweeney Todd and Mamma Mia! for best soundtrack at the Grammys? At least for the other two, you could understand the performers and enjoy the song (regardless of what you people think of Brosnan's singing ability). This is a pretty harmless film for kids, like a 10 year old, but I think that's because they don't know any better and I can only hope that they listen to the songs performed by the original artist when they get older and develop a taste in music and film.",2,They Give Me Such A Headache!,1271030400,"04 12, 2010",2010,2713,"['Riddle', 'What', 'point', 'hiring', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'Jesse', 'McCartney', 'Anna', 'Faris', 'Christina', 'Applegate', 'Amy', 'Poehler', 'when', ""'re"", 'gon', 'do', 'raise', 'pitch', 'voices', 'point', 'unrecognition', 'top', 'get', 'other', 'people', 'do', 'singing', 'anyway', 'producers', 'could', ""'ve"", 'really', 'saved', 'money', 'just', 'getting', 'same', 'people', 'do', 'talking', 'singing', 'voices', 'nobody', 'would', ""'ve"", 'been', 'able', 'hear', 'difference', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'New', 'Moon', 'hope', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'was', 'well', 'paid', 'fifteen', 'minutes', 'screen', 'time', 'character', 'should', ""'ve"", 'been', 'written', 'out', 'entirely', 'were', 'going', 'use', 'was', 'uninspired', 'slapstick', 'was', ""n't"", 'even', 'funny', 'when', 'saw', 'Son', 'Pink', 'Panther', 'do', 'wish', 'Chipettes', 'got', 'interact', 'male', 'counterparts', 'Simon-esque', 'Chipette', 'hardly', 'Theodore', 'girl', 'little', 'more', ""'re"", 'mainly', 'just', 'background', 'when', 'compared', 'lead', 'were', ""n't"", 'sake', 'having', 'three', 'characters', 'could', ""'ve"", 'done', 'whole', 'movie', 'do', 'remember', 'watching', 'cartoon', 'series', '90s', 'was', ""n't"", 'favorite', 'thing', 'think', 'Pokemon', 'Power', 'Rangers', 'was', 'thing', 'moment', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'remember', 'was', 'still', 'enjoyable', 'One', 'reason', 'probably', 'remember', 'enjoying', 'mess', 'was', 'fact', 'Chimpmunks', 'female', 'knock-offs', 'were', 'size', 'small', 'child', 'attend', 'school', 'Not', 'literal', 'size', 'animal', 'still', 'attend', 'school', 'suspension', 'disbelief', 'then', 'shear', 'stupidity', 'How', 'can', 'anyone', 'believe', 'actual', 'chipmunks', 'could', 'go', 'school', 'be', 'immediately', 'accepted', 'Board', 'Health', 'getting', 'involved', 'CGI', 'unconvincing', 'not', 'outright', 'silly', 'looking', 'blue', 'cat', 'things', 'Avatar', 'respect', 'puppetry', 'miniatures', 'used', 'films', 'older', 'Bond', 'films', 'Little', 'Shop', 'Horrors', 'Batman', 'Superman', 'etc', 'plot', 'rehash', 'first', 'just', 'inclusion', 'Chipettes', 'actually', 'not', 'obvious', 'Blues', 'Brothers', '1998-', 'er', 'mean', '2000', 'thing', 'actually', 'more', 'first', 'how', 'did', 'soundtrack', 'beat', 'out', 'Sweeney', 'Todd', 'Mamma', 'Mia', 'best', 'soundtrack', 'Grammys', 'least', 'other', 'two', 'could', 'understand', 'performers', 'enjoy', 'song', 'regardless', 'what', 'people', 'think', 'Brosnan', 'singing', 'ability', 'pretty', 'harmless', 'film', 'kids', '10', 'year', 'old', 'think', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'better', 'can', 'only', 'hope', 'listen', 'songs', 'performed', 'original', 'artist', 'when', 'get', 'older', 'develop', 'taste', 'music', 'film']",N/A

1256926,A2FRKEXDXDN1KI,B0029LI690,Dennis A. Amith (kndy),"[24, 27]","When Ross Bagdasarian Sr.  created the Alvin and the Chipmunks, I often wonder if he knew at the time of how popular those characters, their music and the animated series would be for American pop culture.Popular for the music, it was in 1961 when the three went from being puppets to an animated show.  Bagdasarian using his stage name Dave Seville, the music composer and father/caretaker of three talented chipmunks who tend to get into a little mischief.  The animated series ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" is one of those animated series that has been part of the childhood of several generations.  An even more animated series continued throughout the '80s and '90s.And as ""Alvin and the Chipmunks has been a part of the childhood of children for five decades, for this generation of children, they are now getting acquainted by Alvin, Simon and Theodore through their animated CG films.  And what a remarkable success the first film had been for Twentieth Century Fox as ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" made over $361 million worldwide (the budget of the film was $60 million).Needless to say, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" earned their right for a sequel and before Christmas 2009, the $75 million dollar sequel ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" made even more money than the first earning over $442 million worldwide and now, this popular film which introduces us to the female chipmunks ala ""The Chipettes"": Brittany, Eleanor and Jeanette and featuring more star-power providing the voices for the characters.VIDEO:""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (Widescreen 1:85:1).  Immediately, the first thing that catches your attention is the wonderful CG animation of the chipmunks and how they flawlessly work with the real life backgrounds and props.Many scenes are shot outdoors and with very good lighting indoors that a lot of the detail can be seen in the trees, the plants, outdoor areas to the pores in the skin of the humans and of course, seeing the fur of the chipmunks with such detail.  The film looks absolutely vibrant and detail is very good for this film.  Skintones are natural, blacks are nice and deep and I saw no problems with artifacts, DNR or blurring.AUDIO & SUBTITLES:""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio, English 5.1 Dolby Digital Descriptiive Audio and Spanish/French 5.1 Dolby Digital.  The film is dialogue and music driven through the center and front channel speakers.  But there are special effects such as Alvin tossing a Wiimote into the TV, a wheelchair falling off Toby's car and various sound effects like that.  Surround channels tend to utilize the crowd ambiance much more in the film.But since the film is primarily dialogue and music driven, dialogue is clear and understandable while the music definitely comes alive with the lossless audio soundtrack.Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French and Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES:""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" features the following special features:* Munking History: 50 Years of Chipmunk Mischief, Mayhem & Music - (09:20) A special feature on the creation of ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" and various clips of the chipmunks in animated format.* Munk Music Machine - Allows viewers to select only the music-based portions from the film.* Meet the Chipettes - (8:35) The Chipette voice talent Amy Poehler, Anna Faris and Christina Applegate talk about their characters and how and why Janice Karman created the Chipette's.* Rockin' Rising Stars - (6:20) A featurette about the inclusion of the band Honor Society and singer Charice Pempengco into the film and their experience of working on a film.* Music Mania - (9:02) The making of the music competition segment in the film.* Meet the Stuffies - (3:08) The cast and crew talk about their experience working with the ""stuffies"".* Shake Your Groove Thing! with Rosero - (8:59) Choreographer Rosero and crew show off choreography for the song ""Shake Your Groove Thing!"".* Music Videos & Sing-Alongs - Featuring sing-alongs for ""Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),"" ""We Are Family"",and ""Shake Your Groove Thing"".* Music Videos - ""You Really Got Me"" featuring Honor Society & ""The Song"" featuring Queensberry.* A-l-v-i-n-n-n-n!!!

Talent and crew talk about their experience of working with Alvin, Simon and Theodore.* A-NUT-omy of a Scene - (2:39) How the stuffed animals are used for the choreography portions on the film to help guide the animators and the talent.EXTRAS:""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" comes with a DVD and a digital copy of the film.  The DVD is presented in widescreen 1:85:1, English 5.1 Dolby Digital, English 5.1 Dolby Digital Descriptive Audio, Spanish and French Dolby Surround.  Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish.The digital copy works with portable Media Players and works with iTunes.JUDGMENT CALL:I grew up with ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" and can easily remember watching the television series during my younger years and have watched a fair share of the anime series on DVD as well, introducing it to my seven-year-old son who absolutely loves the first film.Sure enough, we watched ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" and he was laughing and enjoying the film.  As for me, I enjoyed the humor of the film and granted, I may not be the intended demographic for this film, but as a parent, watching my son and seeing him enjoy characters that I grew up with as a child was definitely a fun, family moment.  In fact, he enjoyed the film so much that we watched it for a second time (along with the wife) and continued to laugh at the jokes and hijinks... ""the dutch oven"" joke was just hilarious!I definitely enjoyed the picture quality of this Blu-ray release and how alive the lossless audio soundtrack (especially from the music) coming through my speakers.  Needless to say, there are plenty of music featured in ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" and again, watching my son bop to the songs, I have no doubt that this film will do the same for the children watching this film.  Also, for parents, there are plenty of special features and fun sing-a-longs and if you are commuting, you also get a DVD and digital copy of the film as well.Overall, ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" was an entertaining film which I enjoyed much more over the first film.  The addition of the Chipettes was pretty cool and definitely enjoyed the animation and overall storyline for this sequel.  As mentioned earlier in my review, there is a good number of star power in this film and a lot of of music covers.  Definitely interesting to see ""Chuck"" actor Zachary Levi in a more comedic role and also to see Filipino singer Charice Pempengco jamming on the film as well!  But of course, the star power behind the voices of Alvin and the Chipmunks and the Chipettes did a wonderful job.  For Amy Poehler, Anna Faris and Christina Applegate, the three did a wonderful job.If you are a parent looking for a fun, family film...you can't go wrong with ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" and if you are an adult who grew up with Alvin and the Chipmunks, you'll definitely enjoy this film as well! Definitely recommended!",4,"Blu-ray: Hilarious and fun for the entire family!

Also, the villain, Ian (David Cross), seems more interested in being goofy than a real villain. The high school setting also takes away from the plot and seems out of place. I suspect the film would have been better had it focused more on the Chipmunks and less on the humans. That being said, this is a fun movie and should appeal to kids.

Granted, it wasn't anything brilliant, but it was funny & entertaining enough for a watch or two. Then I decided to watch this movie with the family. The results? ALVIN! WHY DID YOU MAKE SUCH A BAD MOVIE?!?The major problem with the film is the fact that it takes place in High School for most of the movie. That's right, a regular high schol, with famous Chipmunks, and the Princible is a secret huge fan of the group. The film then proceeds to play out like a generic newcomer-to-high-school-film. As in, the Chipmunks struggle to gain acceptance, get bullied, blah, blah, blah. Oh, then at one point, Alvin decideds to turn his back on his friends, and they get mad at each other. Then there's Ian, and he has the Chipettes. Oh, and Jason Lee is in the hospital, so the video-game addicted Zachary Levi has to ""look after them.""Really, at such low expectations, Chipmunks didn't really have that much to live up to, but it fails to even reach this high bar. Everything is so uninspired, and much of the jokes fell flat. Granted, the movie did provide enough laughs for the rest of the family for them to get through it, but after a while, it just became painful.

This is why David Cross' character Ian worked so well, he was everything Dave wasn't, they represented opposite sides of the same coin.There is a lame attempt to do this with bringing in Toby, aunt Jackie's grandson, but not only is he not really a good father figure, and this is not because he's a horrible person but he is just too absent literally and figuratively because of his gaming habits, but because of the nature of his character, he just isn't around much, so there is no one around to balance the wackiness of Ian (who now, seems to be nothing but a caricature of his character in the first film), the Chipmunks, the newly introduced Chipettes, and the rude classmates and weirdo fan girl principle at their new school.  This makes the movie feel like nothing more than one of the lesser and not-so-good made for tv Disney Channel movies.  It takes all of the worst elements of the first movie, crass humor, slapstick, ect and magnifies them by ten times and this might have been okay had Dave still been in the film, Dave is the glue of the family and without him the message of the family sticking together felt more than a bit hollow and the script in general just felt very sophomoric and without a real heart this go around.The first movie warmed my heart and the music numbers were not only fun because the music was good, but the music numbers also had a lot of satire in them, and that is one of the other major things this film is missing, it will definitely appeal to the younger crowd, but unlike the first film that had a lot of humor and satire targeted at adults, this film has pretty much zero.  The first film walked a fine line, it was a rare film for children that could appeal to adults too because it was smarter than average in its examination of the music industry, but yet still included enough zaniness for the kids to enjoy.So, if you are looking for something to distract the kids, this might work, but its not really going to keep the adult viewers highly interested...God Bless ~Amy",3,Loses Most of its Charm the Second Go-around.,1279497600,"07 19, 2010",2010,2930,"['first', 'new', 'Alvin', 'Chipmunks', 'film', '2007', 'was', 'panned', 'critics', 'most', 'part', 'was', 'very', 'well-received', 'families', 'due', 'mostly', 'familial', 'bond', 'Dave', 'Chipmunks', 'basis', 'what', 'problematic', 'sequel', 'took', 'out', 'Dave', 'making', 'have', 'accident', 'beginning', 'benefit', 'concert', 'only', 'put', 'small', 'bits', 'check', 'was', 'so', 'injured', 'stuck', 'country', 'was', 'injured', 'moving', 'would', 'cause', 'more', 'harm', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'share', 'low-brow', 'humor', 'Simon', 'eating', 'Theodore', 'poop', 'Alvin', 'joking', 'little', 'hairs', 'Dave', 'wear', 'Alvin', 'showering', 'dishwasher', 'singing', 'Dontcha', 'somehow', 'just', 'felt', 'like', 'boys', 'being', 'boys', 'was', 'part', 'what', 'made', 'relationship', 'work', 'Dave', 'boys', 'needed', 'fatherly', 'figure', 'keep', 'line', 'why', 'David', 'Cross', 'character', 'Ian', 'worked', 'so', 'well', 'was', 'everything', 'Dave', 'was', ""n't"", 'represented', 'opposite', 'sides', 'same', 'coin.There', 'lame', 'attempt', 'do', 'bringing', 'Toby', 'aunt', 'Jackie', 'grandson', 'not', 'only', 'not', 'really', 'good', 'father', 'figure', 'not', 'horrible', 'person', 'just', 'too', 'absent', 'literally', 'figuratively', 'gaming', 'habits', 'nature', 'character', 'just', ""n't"", 'around', 'much', 'one', 'around', 'balance', 'wackiness', 'Ian', 'who', 'now', 'be', 'nothing', 'caricature', 'character', 'first', 'film', 'Chipmunks', 'newly', 'introduced', 'Chipettes', 'rude', 'classmates', 'weirdo', 'fan', 'girl', 'principle', 'new', 'school', 'movie', 'feel', 'nothing', 'more', 'one', 'lesser', 'not-so-good', 'made', 'tv', 'Disney', 'Channel', 'movies', 'worst', 'elements', 'first', 'movie', 'crass', 'humor', 'slapstick', 'ect', 'magnifies', 'ten', 'times', 'might', 'have', 'been', 'okay', 'had', 'Dave', 'still', 'been', 'film', 'Dave', 'glue', 'family', 'message', 'family', 'sticking', 'together', 'felt', 'more', 'bit', 'hollow', 'script', 'general', 'just', 'felt', 'very', 'sophomoric', 'real', 'heart', 'go', 'around.The', 'first', 'movie', 'warmed', 'heart', 'music', 'numbers', 'were', 'not', 'only', 'fun', 'music', 'was', 'good', 'music', 'numbers', 'also', 'had', 'lot', 'satire', 'one', 'other', 'major', 'things', 'film', 'missing', 'will', 'definitely', 'appeal', 'younger', 'crowd', 'first', 'film', 'had', 'lot', 'humor', 'satire', 'targeted', 'adults', 'film', 'pretty', 'much', 'zero', 'first', 'film', 'walked', 'fine', 'line', 'was', 'rare', 'film', 'children', 'could', 'appeal', 'adults', 'too', 'was', 'smarter', 'average', 'examination', 'music', 'industry', 'yet', 'still', 'included', 'enough', 'zaniness', 'kids', 'enjoy.So', 'are', 'looking', 'something', 'distract', 'kids', 'might', 'work', 'not', 'really', 'going', 'keep', 'adult', 'viewers', 'highly', 'interested', 'God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

Unfortunately, for some of the audience, the second film does not necessarily live up to the fun of the first.There are two audiences for Chipmunks films.  The first are, of course, the children.  In this case, the third generation of kids who are fans of David Seville's creations.  The second are the older fans who grew up with the music and the cartoons.The kids (and in some cases, grandkids) generally loved this movie.  There was a lot of action and fun as Alvin, Theodore and Simon rollicked through High School and eventually learned some important life lessons.  The older fans, like my husband and I, may well be somewhat disappointed.Why?  My husband and I, who grew up with the original Chipmunk craze, came to one conclusion:  Dave is missing.  In the first part of the film, Alvin manages to sideline Dave (Jason Lee) and he's only seen at the very beginning and end of the show.  Instead of Dave, the trio had Dave's slacker cousin Toby (Zachary Levi) as their guardian and Toby just didn't really care about the furkids like Dave does.Of course, we had a return of the evil manager, Ian (David Cross) who was staging his renaissance by representing the three-girl Chipettes, but they just were pale female imitations of the Chipmunks.If you're looking for a holiday film for the kids, this is a decent choice, though I'd actually recommend Disney's excellent THE PRINCESS AND THE FROG instead.Rebecca Kyle, December 2009",2,The kids enjoyed it,1262044800,"12 29, 2009",2009,1500,"['One', 'good', 'film', 'sequel', 'Squeakquel', 'case', 'Unfortunately', 'audience', 'second', 'film', 'not', 'necessarily', 'live', 'up', 'fun', 'are', 'two', 'audiences', 'Chipmunks', 'films', 'first', 'are', 'course', 'children', 'case', 'third', 'generation', 'kids', 'who', 'are', 'fans', 'David', 'Seville', 'creations', 'second', 'are', 'older', 'fans', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'music', 'cartoons.The', 'kids', 'cases', 'grandkids', 'generally', 'loved', 'movie', 'was', 'lot', 'action', 'fun', 'Alvin', 'Theodore', 'Simon', 'rollicked', 'High', 'School', 'eventually', 'learned', 'important', 'life', 'lessons', 'older', 'fans', 'husband', 'may', 'well', 'be', 'somewhat', 'disappointed.Why', 'husband', 'who', 'grew', 'up', 'original', 'Chipmunk', 'craze', 'came', 'one', 'conclusion', 'Dave', 'missing', 'first', 'part', 'film', 'Alvin', 'sideline', 'Dave', 'Jason', 'Lee', 'only', 'seen', 'very', 'beginning', 'end', 'show', 'Instead', 'Dave', 'trio', 'had', 'Dave', 'slacker', 'cousin', 'Toby', 'Zachary', 'Levi', 'guardian', 'Toby', 'just', 'did', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'furkids', 'Dave', 'does.Of', 'course', 'had', 'return', 'evil', 'manager', 'Ian', 'David', 'Cross', 'who', 'was', 'staging', 'renaissance', 'representing', 'three-girl', 'Chipettes', 'just', 'were', 'pale', 'female', 'imitations', 'Chipmunks.If', ""'re"", 'looking', 'holiday', 'film', 'kids', 'decent', 'choice', ""'d"", 'actually', 'recommend', 'Disney', 'excellent', 'THE', 'PRINCESS', 'AND', 'THE', 'FROG', 'instead.Rebecca', 'Kyle', 'December', '2009']",N/A

O'Blenis,"[0, 1]","Featuring lovable characters, a relatively simple but highly effective plot, and more laughs and charm than most recent comedies could dream of obtaining, the second installment in the new adventures of Alvin, Simon and Thoedore outdoes its predecessor and hits a high point as probably 2009's best comedy.Alvin And The Chipmunks: The Squeakquel sends the three chipmunks, now international pop music sensations, to a place more terrifying than any grueling world tour or high-hype press conference: school.  With their adoptive dad Dave injured after a stunt goes awry at one of the concerts, the chipmunks are left in the care of clueless relative Toby, leaving the three l'il furballs to navigate the perils of the educational system on their own.  Meanwhile, a trio of female chipmunks - Britney, Jenette and Eleanor - inspired by the original Chipmunks's success, set out to make it big themselves, but fall under the sway of Alvin and company's dastardly ex-manager.  Not surprisingly, the new trio ends up in the same school as the originals, where they become unwilling competitors in a rivalry sparked by the ex-manager, as well as opposing each other in a contest to represent the school at a regional music talent contest.The perils of school affect the 3 original chipmunks in different ways: all three are targeted by bullies, but Alvin is the most likely to fall in with the 'wrong crowd'.  Simon is, of course, the star brain, and that leaves poor Theodore as the most 'fish out of water' character.  For those worried that the 'bullying' angle will be too upsetting or depressing for younger viewers, fear not.  I don't think it's letting any cats out of any bags to say that the good guys come out on top in this; the scene where Alvin and Simon come to the aid of a persecuted Theodore, that alone is worth the price of the DVD.  Speaking of Theodore, although I love all six chipmunks in here, there is undeniably something special about Theodore.  He's so pure in his good will and earnest innocence that he steals the most scenes of any character in the movie.Great animation (especially on the facial expressions), highly entertaining 'chipmunk-ized' versions of familiar songs, genuine laugh-out-loud moments and tonnes of cute appeal all raise this up to one of 2009's gems.  Among recent comedies it has few rivals -Ponyo (Two-Disc Edition)is actually the only 2009 one that equals its comedic value, and that isn't even considered a comedy (hence Squeakquel's claim to the 'best comedy' title).  There were a few others, both in the 'kids' sections and in the 'regular' comedy sections that were also good, but overall I didn't think 2009 was the best year for humorous fare (other genres of movies had a far better year, in my opinion).  A movie like Alvin And The Chipmunks: The Squeakquel, though, make up for a Lot of lost ground.

But the Chipmunks unexpectedly meet their match in three singing chipmunks known as The Chipettes.

1256992,ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T,B0029LI690,Tsuyoshi,"[1, 2]","The singing Chipmunk trio comes back in ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel."" This time three chipmunks Alvin, Simon and Theodore go to school, and Alvin even plays football before his cheering fans. The film also introduces the Chipettes, three singing female chipmunks Brittany, Eleanor and Jeanette (from the 80s TV series), and the Chipettes are tricked by an evil (and disgraced) former producer Ian (David Cross reprising the role).But why do they have to be in high school? Why does the film have to repeat the same storyline about the kids / animals deceived by a greedy adult? I think I know who the film's target audience is, but why references to ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Silence of the Lambs""? And pole dance? (Incidentally, ""Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" also has a parody of ""Lambs."" So what is going on in Hollywood?)I am not surprised if Jason Lee as Dave, who should be one of the key characters of the franchise, looks very reluctant to come back, staying out of the story for most of the film. There are also some episodes about the chipmunks' new guardian Toby (Zachary Levi) and his romantic interest, a subplot you don't care.There are slapstick bits in ""The Squeakquel."" Many of them. I like slapstick humor. I like Buster Keaton films and ""Tom and Jerry"" cartoons. The gags of ""The Squeakquel"" include breaking and throwing things. That is OK with me, but in this film they are not just things, but an old lady's wheelchair (broken), Dave's leg (broken) and poor chipmunks themselves (not broken, but thrown into a toilet and a trash can). Maybe we are supposed to laugh, though I found the idea of chipmunks and high school bullies is not very funny.The film's special effects are just OK. The voices of the Chipettes are provided by Amy Poehler, Anna Faris and Christina Applegate, but I don't see the point of casting them when their voices are post-processed to suit the characters. Finally, the film is directed by Betty Thomas, director of Eddie Murphy's ""Doctor Dolittle.""

While this one as well as the first installment were not given much of a fair fight amongst critics, like in the film the true fans of The Chipmunks...and The Chippetes have spoken.The Squeakuel picks up where the first one left off and the best part about sequels, is there is a chance for more character development. This movie brought alot of the TV series into it byt sending the boys off to school and fitting in with kids their age. I have to say I did not expect them to end up in High School, but then again we really don't how old they are in the movie. The boys now have to face the everyday challenges of life, fitting and more importantly knowing what comes first in life. Adding the Chippetes into this second film is a treat for us fans of the 1980's show. The girls were very well voiced and had the characterisitcs of their animated counterparts...well not so much Brittney...yet. While they didn't get as much face time as I would have wanted they did play an important role in the movie and now there is a 3rd installment in the works so I am wondering what is going to happen.
