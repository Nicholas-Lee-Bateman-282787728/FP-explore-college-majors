The movie seemed to be forced along from scene to scene without the moments being able to naturally evolve. I'm not sure if it was poor direction or just personal preference, but Weaver's character seemed like it needed to be more external, rather than the quiet crazy. Her ability doesn't shine until she is covered in latex and prosthetics.All in all, it was okay, but I have no desire to see it again.

The creators of this movie made something special of it.

430439,A3IRBCCB3I5PPD,630464972X,"Anastasia McPherson ""Bibliophile""","[2, 2]","The original fairy tales of Renaissance and Medieval Europe were dark, gothic tales perfect for a time when overland travel could kill you and villages were cut off from each other by deep, dark, dangerous forests. The tales were often based on gossip that traveled many miles and many years, changing in the telling. For example, some etymologists think that Sleeping Beauty was based on the murderess, Countess Bathory, who bathed in the blood of virgins to keep herself young and was walled up alive as punishment. Traveling decades through the forests of Europe, the tale became one of a Sleeping Princess, locked forever in sleep behind unscaleable walls or thickets too deep to pass.By that standard, this cinematic version of the Snow White tale is one of the best ever as it relies on a psychological take and a real understanding of the dangers of Medieval Europe but at the same time retains the magic of fairy tales in a believable way. Snow White is the beloved daughter of a lord whose mother dies giving birth to her. Some years later, the father remarries and while the daughter and step-mother had the usual competition things might have been fine had not the step-mother lost her child in childbirth and was subsequently unable to bear another. The grief drove her to crazed jealousy and dark magic. Snow White, here called Lily is lost in the forest and the terrible living conditions and desperation of the common people is addressed and with a lighter hand than might be expected.This is also a beautiful piece in that the settings, the costumes, the cinematography are all beautiful without sacrificing the dirt and detail and hardship of those times. A wonderful production, so good that I am considering adding it to my permanent collection rather than just renting it. I am a huge fan of the original fairy tales and modern takes on those classics and this more than satisfies both appetites. Highly recommended to fans of Once Upon a Time, Princess Bride, The 10th Kingdom and literary retellings of fairy tales.

She is a convincingly evil and complex villain who paves the way for a very dark fairy tale.

Then again, she is also a witch.The performances of younger actors, Snow White and her darling, are not as wonderful - they seem to be there mostly for the scenery. Then again, this movie is mostly about scenery, of particular kind: blood, guts, hearts, and poisoned apples (how could I forget about that!)It's a good, well-executed horror movie that is only on the surface rooted in an innocent children's tale.

All goes well until Hoffman's daughter Lilliana (played as a child by Taryn Davis) grows into a stunning young woman (Monica Keena) whose beauty and shining innocence threatens the vice-like grip which Claudia holds over her husband and the entire court.When Claudia's only child is delivered stillborn, she blames Lilly for her baby's death and the estrangement of Friedrich's affections.  Following a grisly attack on her life, Lilly flees into the forest where she's taken in by a group of miners (of which only one is a dwarf); but Claudia's magic mirror will never let her escape the wrath of the spurned stepmother...Dark, intense, moody and quite gory in places, this SNOW WHITE won't be everyone's cup of tea, but I appreciated the Germanic storybook look of the piece, and the sensational performances of Weaver and Keena, adding a realistic flavour to their characters; this is a particularly brave turn from Ms Weaver.

I've never seen her in a costume like this and she is nothing short of stunning in it. Herperformance in it is flawless as always, and the expressions she uses are priceless.I admit I'm a great fan of hers and if you like her, you'll love her in this story.Sam Neill plays the part of the father. He does a fair job of playing this part. I don't know if the script was written this way, but he seemed pretty milk toast to me. I expected more of a man than this. He seems pretty mamby pamby as the father. That's just my impression of him.To be honest I bought the movie because of Sigourney Weaver and the theme of the movie. Sometimes I like darker stories and this one really caught my eye.If you like my review then you should at least watch this movie or go rent it, and decide if you want to buy it. If you don't like my review then watch it anyway and make up your own mind.

430453,A1MC6BFHWY6WC3,630464972X,D. Blankenship,"[2, 2]","Being a fan of fairy-tales; true fairy-tales that have not been ""made pretty"" by Disney and his ilk, and loving a film with strong gothic overtones and a touch of magic; I was rather well satisfied with this version of the tale of Snow White. Tastes range wildly and if you search long enough you are bound to find films that meet yours precisely. This was the case for me when I stumbled across this one. While this movie most certainly got mixed reviews when it was released (and still is it would seem if the reviews here are any indication), I personally found this one to fit my personal taste perfectly.This 1997 version of the classic pretty well sticks to the one as collected by the Brothers Grimm. Yes, there are variations, but of the dozens upon dozens of renditions of this story on film, each has its own twist. At least this one kept to the overall mood, time and place the Brothers placed theirs. The origins of this story were quite likely German but most of the countries in Europe have there own. This film was shot in the Czech Republic and in Barvaria, and if for no other reason than to see the scenery; the wild woodland and ancient castles, then the viewer should consider this one.This film is not wildly known which surprises me somewhat as the acting in it is wonderful. Sigourney Weaver plays a perfect wicked step-mother and Monica Keena fits the role of Snow White perfectly. Weaver's classic beauty blends well with the drop-dead gorgeous Keena. The supporting cast is made up of very talented actors...not a dog performance among them did I spot. (Well, there was of course a dog in this movie, but even he did a good job of playing his part). The costuming is some of the best I have seen in recent years.Anyway, this is a very, very dark version of this particular fairy-tale; very dark indeed. I am at a bit of a loss as to how to classify it. It most certainly is not a horror picture as there is really very little to be frightened of. To call it a movie of ""terror"" is stretching the definition of terror a bit far in my opinion. Yes, there is blood, death and some rather disturbing scenes, but nothing that I would call over the top. I suppose if you stick to the premise of just what a ""fairy-tale"" is, you would be pretty safe. These old folk tales where made to scare children; and indeed adults, into doing what was write. They were passed on word of mouth from generation to generation before they saw print. They were told around the fire at night to show the fate of those who break the rules or willfully follow their base human nature. They were meant to teach that there were some very dire consequences for bad behavior. This movie most certainly does the job fairy-tales were made for.For me this was a completely different version of this old tale but one that is just as valid of the dozen or more I have seen or read. I was entertained and to be quite frank, that is the only reason I really watch movies for.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks",5,"FOR SOMETHING A BIT DIFFERENT - Another well done version of an old, old tale.

The  period on which the movie focuses was one in which many men, with children, lost first wives, not to divorce, but to the very high death rate  in childbirth. That the father's second wife happens to be a witch is simply a mask, a defense against recognizing that both females in the situation, wife and daughter, are competing for the love of the husband-father, both hate  the other, both use the tools at their disposal to try to destroy the other. On the whole, the stepmother gets a bum rap. Whether or not she came  prepared to share the husband with his daughter, the daughter, being the more naive and innocent, is the more overtly hostile, to a degree that would take a Saint not to react. In this case, the stepmother is anything but a Saint. The point of the story, is that  the  daughter also was no Saint, she simply had fewer weapons at her disposal until she was forced to mingle with the rough crowd who represent the 7 dwarfs. From her interactions with them, she returns in order to destroy her rival, pitting her youthful vigor (and relationship with her father) against the evil wiles of her stepmother. The denouement is a vigorous scene, the nature of which I cannot disclose.Appropriately the two key roles are wife and daughter, ably handled by Weaver and Monica Keena, respectively. Sam Neill has little to do and does little. Others in the cast play subordinate roles with competence. While there is a certain murkiness in some of the more active scenes, on the whole photography and scenic design facilitate the development of the central theme.While not a must-see film by any means, it is an entertaining and interesting one, worth a look-in.",4,"Somewhat Muddled, but worth watching",1375660800,"08 5, 2013",2013,1765,"['harsh', 'story', 'based', 'difficulties', 'inherent', 'daughter-stepmother', 'relationship', 'period', 'movie', 'was', 'one', 'many', 'men', 'children', 'lost', 'first', 'wives', 'not', 'divorce', 'very', 'high', 'death', 'rate', 'childbirth', 'father', 'second', 'wife', 'be', 'witch', 'simply', 'mask', 'defense', 'recognizing', 'females', 'situation', 'wife', 'daughter', 'are', 'competing', 'love', 'husband-father', 'hate', 'other', 'use', 'tools', 'disposal', 'try', 'destroy', 'other', 'whole', 'stepmother', 'bum', 'rap', 'not', 'came', 'prepared', 'share', 'husband', 'daughter', 'daughter', 'being', 'more', 'naive', 'innocent', 'more', 'overtly', 'hostile', 'degree', 'would', 'take', 'Saint', 'not', 'react', 'case', 'stepmother', 'anything', 'Saint', 'point', 'story', 'daughter', 'also', 'was', 'Saint', 'simply', 'had', 'fewer', 'weapons', 'disposal', 'was', 'forced', 'mingle', 'rough', 'crowd', 'who', 'represent', '7', 'dwarfs', 'interactions', 'order', 'destroy', 'rival', 'pitting', 'youthful', 'vigor', 'relationship', 'father', 'evil', 'wiles', 'stepmother', 'denouement', 'vigorous', 'scene', 'nature', 'can', 'not', 'disclose.Appropriately', 'two', 'key', 'roles', 'are', 'wife', 'daughter', 'ably', 'handled', 'Weaver', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'respectively', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'little', 'do', 'little', 'Others', 'cast', 'play', 'subordinate', 'roles', 'competence', 'certain', 'murkiness', 'more', 'active', 'scenes', 'whole', 'photography', 'scenic', 'design', 'facilitate', 'development', 'central', 'theme.While', 'not', 'must-see', 'film', 'means', 'entertaining', 'interesting', 'one', 'look-in']",Snow White:a Tale of Terror VHS

They were able to save Lilli. A few years later her father (Sam Neill) is remarrying to Claudia (Sigourney Weaver). Lilli is resentful and something is afoot with Claudia. The relationship between the two women becomes more strained over the years and Claudia is resolved to get rid of Lilli and bring the entire estate, along with her husband, down.This is a pretty creepy flick. I'm not certain of the exact story behind Claudia. The mirror plays an important part. It's like a Dorian Grey/vanity thing. But during one address she invokes her mother and asks what she thinks of the distance her daughter has come in life and stature. What's with that!? But she is a witch. She can cast spells and drive various sources of nature. She's scary in an unstable mind kind of way. Lilli is a bit of a brat which posed problems for me later in the movie. When she escapes being hunted in the woods by Claudia's men, and gets lost is when she meets the seven. One is a dwarf but as a band they live on the outside. They work a mine, have poor living quarters and are dirty, mean and resentful of authority. She treats them with disdain and they want her for the ransom she'll bring. So when she become compassionate toward them and starts to fall for the Gill Bellows member of the group, it seems out of character and rushed.This is generally a good movie. It has a good look and feel to most of it. Some of the sets aren't up to par and some of the wardrobe looks too much like costumes. Simon Boswell handles the music so it's up to snuff. It's just a bit disjointed for me. It needed a bit more time to let things happen and some smoothing out of the script. Weaver gives the strongest performance. Monica Keena is Okay as Lilli. Sam Neill has long worn out his welcome with me so I cannot comment on his performance. Gill bellows is decent enough in a role that doesn't give him much room to breathe. A big surprise for me is the director. Michael Cohn only directed 3 movies of which this was the third. What happened to him. There seems to be plenty of talent here?

Monica Keena stars as Lili, who is meant to be Snow White, and she does a great job. (Why wasn't nudity included in the scene where she is bathing at the beginning, since the filmmakers felt they had to put that in?) Sigourney Weaver stars as the evil Claudia, meant to be a stand-in for the Queen, and she also plays the part admirably. However, the mirror image of Claudia is never explained and therefore smacks of magic, as this is meant to be a real version of Snow White. Sam Neill also does a good job as Lili's father, though his part is sorely under-written. And that brief sex scene made no sense whatsoever.

The Prince has become a castaway thief, the dwarves are outlaws, and so on. It is a dark tale coming from the dark past that we call dark because it believed in the devil and in its constant and permanent presence one way or another. Magic was necessarily black magic and the marvellous necessarily was antichristian and satanic. The story is in no way surprising except for the people who have only encountered Disneyland Snow White in their life. Reality is slightly more perverse. The great power of this film is purely artistic : the lights, the setting, the special effects, and the horror that is always clearly stated and never really shown, leaving a great share of work to your own imagination. Horror for sure but no gore. In such a film stepping from reality into fantasy, from normality into horror is happening without you even knowing it or feeling it. One moment your are in normal life, the next moment you are in a fantastic world. Nothing as chnaged and yet a small detail, the lights, the sound track, a noise, nothing really and yet. When the witch is looking at herself in her magic mirror, at times we know which is the real witch and which is the reflection, but at other times we just don't know any more and I am even sure that at times we are wrong and the reflection looks more real than the real face. That is what good fantasy is : so much part of real life that we can't differenciate real life from imagination and hallucination. The objective is clear : to produce in us the conviction that horror is part of our daily life and that we don't even know about it because horror is just as real as all the rest, horror is part of our real life. Which means in the end that there is no escape from horror, only the necessity for us to be ready and prepared for it.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",5,Normal terror in real life,1117929600,"06 5, 2005",2005,1901,"['fairy', 'tale', 'sure', 'tale', 'anyway', 'fairy', 'become', 'witch', 'Prince', 'become', 'castaway', 'thief', 'dwarves', 'are', 'outlaws', 'so', 'dark', 'tale', 'coming', 'dark', 'call', 'dark', 'believed', 'devil', 'constant', 'permanent', 'presence', 'one', 'way', 'Magic', 'was', 'necessarily', 'black', 'magic', 'marvellous', 'necessarily', 'was', 'antichristian', 'satanic', 'story', 'way', 'surprising', 'people', 'who', 'have', 'only', 'encountered', 'Disneyland', 'Snow', 'White', 'life', 'Reality', 'slightly', 'more', 'perverse', 'great', 'power', 'film', 'purely', 'artistic', 'lights', 'setting', 'special', 'effects', 'horror', 'always', 'clearly', 'stated', 'never', 'really', 'shown', 'leaving', 'great', 'share', 'work', 'own', 'imagination', 'Horror', 'sure', 'gore', 'such', 'film', 'stepping', 'reality', 'fantasy', 'normality', 'horror', 'happening', 'even', 'knowing', 'feeling', 'One', 'moment', 'are', 'normal', 'life', 'next', 'moment', 'are', 'fantastic', 'world', 'Nothing', 'chnaged', 'yet', 'small', 'detail', 'lights', 'sound', 'track', 'noise', 'nothing', 'really', 'yet', 'When', 'witch', 'looking', 'magic', 'mirror', 'times', 'know', 'real', 'witch', 'reflection', 'other', 'times', 'just', 'do', ""n't"", 'know', 'more', 'am', 'even', 'sure', 'times', 'are', 'wrong', 'reflection', 'more', 'real', 'real', 'face', 'what', 'good', 'fantasy', 'so', 'much', 'part', 'real', 'life', 'ca', ""n't"", 'differenciate', 'real', 'life', 'imagination', 'hallucination', 'objective', 'clear', 'produce', 'conviction', 'horror', 'part', 'daily', 'life', 'do', ""n't"", 'even', 'know', 'horror', 'just', 'as', 'real', 'rest', 'horror', 'part', 'real', 'life', 'Which', 'end', 'escape', 'horror', 'only', 'necessity', 'be', 'ready', 'prepared', 'it.Dr', 'Jacques', 'COULARDEAU']",Snow White:a Tale of Terror VHS

Munyon,"[6, 7]","You need to have an open mind to take the sentimental version of the classic Snow White story and throw it out the window, then go outside and get it, and bring it back inside.  Shake it up and down, turn it inside out, use consummate professional actors and actresses, have great sets that include a forest, and then take considerable poetic license.  Having said that, this 1997 version of Snow White had some incredible creativity, impressively thought out adaptations (including what they did with the magic mirror - this version has it as part of an ornate wardrobe cabinet instead of the oval depiction typical to most sets for Snow White), and although there is absolutely zero chemistry between Sam Neill and Sigourney Weaver, there isn't supposed to be.  It was a marriage of nobility and propriety, not one of love or passion.  Sigourney plays the role of Lady Claudia, the evil stepmother, and although I find Sigourney otherwise profoundly attractive, she exudes repulsiveness in this film just like it is meant to be done - even before her transformation into the old crone (witch).  Sam Neill has a clueless character part that appears dull and weak, but again, that is what was meant to be portrayed.  There is no real steal-the-show, stand out performance that leaves all the others behind, and somehow there seems to be a flux of camaraderie among the cast that buoys this film along wondrously.  It definitely isn't for anyone who is easily given nightmares, for there is believable evil and foreboding nastiness beyond anything Walt Disney would have sanctioned.  But, if you want a fresh perspective on a classic story, this film definitely is a banquet in that direction.  Not to put too fine a point on it, I found myself wanting the ornate wardrobe cabinet, but without the magic and evil.  Great costumes, great set, great acting, and well written.  Purists won't care too much for this version of Snow White, but I found it exhilarating and innovative.  Two thumbs up, and five stars.

She manages to win their hearts in time and eventually returns to challenge her step-mother.This is a very dark telling of the Snow White story.  It is more tragic than many tellings in that the step-mother is mad and not evil.  The girl who plays Lillian is excellent.

(Well she's not called that here, she's a duchess or something, but you know the character I mean.)She is/was never a great beauty, so when she wants to remain the greatest beauty in the land, it simply doesn't wash for the audience.While they can (and do!)dub her inexplicable singing, they just can't dub her looks.And while the costume designer has tried to artistically clothe everybody in browns, russets and yellows, it must be said that yellow just is NOT Ms. Weaver's colour, ...AT ALL!She's given a series of what look like over embroidered, sprigged and frilled huge duvets to wear that cover her completely and literally drain what little colour she has in her complexion.(And I kept waiting for her to utter ""Get away from her you bitch!)Secondly the girl who plays the Snow White character (Lilly?) isn't exactly endowed with looks that are anything to be envious of, well apart from her youth I suppose. She also is not served well by wardrobe, specially when she appears in what is supposed to be her dear dead mother's dress she has found in the attic. It's meant to be a show stopper, detracting from her stepmother's predilection for public singing, but looks more like a crumpled up old charity-shop cast-off. This was an opportunity for the designer to shine, ...but they blew it bigtime!And for some reason she's almost a dwarf herself, ...tiny! Specially when standing next to the tall, but MOST uncharismatic Prince in the very worst orangutan-orange Prince Valiant wig.Thankfully, he DOESN'T get to marry Snow White, here but SPOILER, SPOILER, ..SPOILER, takes a rather unorthodox exit from the castle's upper window via a very long first step!He's never portrayed as anything of a brain, and if it was left up to him, Snow White would have been buried alive! He even pashes The Wicked Stepmother at one stage!It's an.....""uncomfortable"" scene to say the least, ....but wait a bit, there's an even more unsettling scene to come. More about that little corker later on!Interestingly, the dwarfs are not really dwarfs at all, (well apart from one), but a roving band of outlawed peasants digging for some never identified substance in a rather shaky mine. The gang contains nasty ones, nice ones and in a departure from the original storyline, ....a heroic hairy-chested one who was forced to watch his family burned at the stake and had his own face disfigured by the christians trying to press-gang him into the crusades. Nice to see christianity portrayed in its true colours for a change, eh?But do keep your eye on this bloke, ...he's da man!!!The settings are suitably storybook, ...the forests sometimes shown in fairly lurid technicolor tones that are somewhat disconcerting, but the intention is obviously to give the whole thing a fairytale quality.The sets are good overall, especially the large armoire that contains THAT mirror, which is an absolute ripper! (Forget that mundane old wardrobe in ""The Lion, Witch and the...!) The fastening of this dresser is absolutely stunning, ...and most chilling just by way of its clever and sinister design. You won't forget it easily.It would have fascinated, yet scared the hell out of any kid sneaking around stepmother's bedroom.As mentioned before, there are a few departures from the old story we are all familiar with that hold interest. Special effects are also quite good, and NOT overused for a change.Now sorry about this next bit, but it's SO bizarre that I've got to mention it. It's the one I referred to before. Brace yourselves here.At one stage when The Queen has immobilised everybody in the castle with poison, she goes to her husband (Sam Neil, ..he's in bed), uncovers his otherwise helpless body, and manually masturbates him to orgasm! Yes, you read right!In what can only be described as something of a departure from the original material, the storyline at this stage has her in need of some of his ""seed"" to re-animate her previously still-born baby that she has bizarrely secreted away for years!Weird, ...or what? Apparently, she manages to successfully do just this too, ....using her ""gatherings"". Talk about test-tube babies....Surely the pages where this happens must have been missing from my childhood copy of Grimm's Fairy Tales? I'm sure I would have remembered THAT bit!There are in fact a couple of instances throughout the movie that suggest a fair bit of material has been edited out that would have explained certain sequences left in. Carelessness on the editor's part I would suggest.I quite enjoyed watching this, in spite of it's fairly obvious failings.Interesting that Snow White does NOT end up being kissed by that soppy Prince, or living happily ever after with him either .(He's such a wooden, unromantic dolt!) Just goes to prove that when the chips are really down, women prefer hairy-chested, down-to-earth blokes who are good in a crisis, rather than primped and preened self-obsessed Prince Charmings!And visually much of it is quite engrossing.Also good to see CSG effects not dominating a movie, ...as we have so come to expect these days.This version is NOT exactly for young children which is a plus for we adults, although are any of the Grimm's tales in their original forms all that suitable for les enfants?Eight or nine year olds upward should be able to watch this with going into bedroom jitters.

430476,A3V6Z4RCDGRC44,630464972X,"Lisa Shea ""be the change you wish to see in t...","[4, 4]","Released in 1997 as a TV-Movie, Snow White - A Tale of Terror is clearly a movie which influenced the 2012 movie Snow White and the Huntsman. In both cases they move away from the bird-and-bunny filled Disney version and stick more closely to the dark roots of the Grimm world. In Tale of Terror, despite its implication that this is some sort of a Freddy Krueger bloodbath, it's really much more psychological.Sigourney Weaver is brilliant as the stepmother tasked to come into the family of father-plus-daughter. She tries her best, even bringing the young girl a new puppy. But, as we know can happen with newly formed families, all did not go smoothly. The young girl resents the intrusion on her father's affection. The new stepmother gets frustrated and jealous of the father's adoration of his daughter, who reminds him of his dead wife. And, trapped in a single location for long years on end, the emotions build and build.So rather than an evil, nasty, out-to-slay woman from the very beginning, Weaver's character is far more intricate. This means if you're hyped for a super-action film you might be disappointed here. The build is far more subtle, as the little things in life (along with a few not-so-little things) build up to finally push her over the edge into madness.The movie is set in a late medieval era with hints of fantasy in it. Not entirely historically accurate, but after all, this is a fairy tale.SPOILER ALERT TO FOLLOW - BOTH FOR HUNTSMAN AND TERRORI watched this and Huntsman in ""reverse order"" - I saw Huntsman first and then this one. When I watched Huntsman I was not pleased with the storyline that she had a love who adored her for years. Then she meets a ""rougher guy"" and in only a few hours she decides he's the one for her. In watching Terror, I see that this was probably the source for that situation. Here we have Snow White deeply in love with a kind, well traveled, intelligent doctor. He proposes marriage to her, and she accepts.And then she ends up with the ""seven dwarves"" - and one of them is a rough, handsome guy. So it seems that literally the second time she talks with him they are kissing. By the time the Queen/Crone shows up a few scenes later, Snow White is stating she's in love with him.So the doctor shows up and is immediately worried about her. Yes, he momentarily falls for the Queen's seductions - and then he's off looking. He finds her and brings her home. But it's clear that she doesn't really care any more. She only wants the guy-of-the-moment. And then, conveniently, the doctor is slain, but nobody even cares. She's just happy that she's back with her dwarf. It doesn't even seem like she looks to see if the doctor is OK.I'm not fond of storylines where a decent, noble, reliable, steadfast guy is thrown under the bus because some new hot-stuff guy has shown up for a minute or two.So I'll give it 4/5 because I like most of the movie in general, but it loses a star for the Doctor / Dwarf situation.",4,Great Movie with Issues.

430478,AUFK6UT2DU87H,630464972X,"Meredith L. Burton ""Bookworm""","[4, 4]","""Snow White"" has always been my favorite Grimms Brothers fairy tale.  The story is rich in imagery and examines rivalry between parents and children and a young girl's awakening to maturity.  ""Snow White - A Tale of Terror"" is a frightening an realistic examination of this familiar tale.  Be warned, this version is not for children! The writers utilize scenes from the original Grimms story, which was not meant for children anyway.  Instances of cannibalism, gore, and torture are graphically portrayed.  This movie plumbs the psychological depths of the fairy tale and the characters are far from being ""cookie cutter"" models.  Each character is developed very well and they are not all good or all evil.The primise of this movie concerns a nobleman, Frederic Hoffman, and his wife Lilliana.  After a carriage accident, Lilliana is near death.  She pleads with her husband to save their unborn baby, and he performs a searean section.  The child survives although the mother loses her life.  A few years pass, and Fredric marries again.  Lady Claudia (Sigurney Weaver), is a well-intentioned woman who strives to make her husband happy.  However, from the beginning Frederic's little girl, Lilliana, resents her stepmother.  As the years pass, the resentment and hostility between the two females grows: finally culminating in Claudia's giving birth to a stillborn child.  Claudia learns she can no longer have children, and her irrational mind, caught within the throes of mental anguish, immediately blames Lilli.  Spurred on by an evil  mirror which belonged to her eccentric mother, Claudia orders her mute brother, Gustav, to take the now teenaged Lilliana into the forest and kill her.  But wait! You think you know the rest of the story? Think again! In this version, as in real life, Prince Charming's are few and far between, and ""little men"" cannot always come to the rescue.  It is up to Lilli to rescue herself!The acting in this movie is magnificent! Sigurney Weaver is exceptional as the ""wicked stepmother,"" taking the word ""evil"" to a whole new level! Monica Keana does a wonderful job portraying Lilliana: a ""Snow White"" with an edge.  The other performers are just as excellent.""Snow White - A Tale of Terror"" is surprisingly moving.

430479,A2M1N8G4W4END8,630464972X,Michael R Gates,"[111, 114]","The cutesy Disney cartoon this ain't.  Although the BASIC story structure remains, SNOW WHITE: A TALE OF TERROR is an interpretation that is much closer in tone and mood to the original somber tale by the Brothers Grimm, and in many ways it is actually even darker.  Instead of a kiddie flick, then, what director Michael Cohn and crew serve up is a top-notch gothic horror film.In this gloomier version of the famous fable, many of the familiar elements are wryly skewed.  For example, the seven men who house the heroine (here called Lilliana, or Lilli, rather than Snow White) during her sojourn in the forest are not cutsie dwarves--although one is actually dwarfish--but are instead a bunch of grubby, ruffians who earn their living working mines.  At first they want to use the girl to obtain a ransom from her wealthy father, but they soon develop a sort of fatherly affection for her.  Another clever twist occurs when the hero revives Lilli after she has fallen comatose from eating the cursed apple.  Instead of awakening her with an enchanted kiss, he repeatedly pushes on her midriff out of desperation, thereby dislodging the piece of fruit with a sort of primitive version of the Heimlich Maneuver.  Such changes in narrative and characterization are perceptively clever and make the tale much more realistic and believable than its animated ancestor.  However, despite this deliciously sardonic tweaking, remaining at the story's core is its familiar and enduring moral, to wit, that basic goodness will always triumph over hatefulness and vanity because the latter are ultimately self-destructive.In the role of the wicked stepmother (as well as her evil mirror's reflection), Sigourney Weaver delivers a superbly malevolent performance as she schemes to destroy her beautiful stepdaughter.  The lovely Monica Keena--most recently seen by horror fans playing the buxom Lori Campbell in 2003's FREDDY VS. JASON--does a very affecting job as the object of Weaver's disdain (i.e., Lilli), and Gil Bellows is very convincing and interesting as the hero and tacit love interest.  Sam Neill does a fine job as the heroine's mostly clueless father, and the film's realism is further bolstered by outstanding supporting performances from talents like Brian Glover, Frances Cuka, David Conrad, Anthony Brophy, Christopher Bauer, and numerous others.With SNOW WHITE: A TALE OF TERROR, director Michael Cohn and scripters Tom Szollosi &amp; Deborah Serra recreate the tenebrous tone of the Grimm Brother's original story while, at the same time, they subtly thumb their noses at the saccharine, white-washed Disney interpretation.  Mike Southon's beautiful cinematography is deliberately on the warm side of the spectrum, generating a autumnal ambiance perfectly suited to the plot.  And the creative art direction by Peter Russell, outstanding pseudo-medieval production design of Gemma Jackson, and clever &quot;period&quot; costume designs from Marit Allen and Charles Knode add detail to the film that greatly enhances both the spooky ambiance and the fairy-tale quality of this twisted fable.The DVD from Universal Studios Home Video offers a clean, crisp digital transfer in the original widescreen aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  (Alas, it is only letterbox widescreen and not anamorphic, but it still looks beautiful.)  The only real bonus feature is a trailer for the film, which curiously identifies it using one of its numerous alternate titles.  The disc is very reasonably priced, though, so fans of old-fashioned gothic horror or grim Grimm fairy tales are hereby advised to add SNOW WHITE: A TALE OF TERROR to their collections.",4,Grimmer than Grimm,1078790400,"03 9, 2004",2004,3641,"['cutesy', 'Disney', 'cartoon', 'ai', ""n't"", 'BASIC', 'story', 'structure', 'SNOW', 'WHITE', 'TALE', 'OF', 'TERROR', 'interpretation', 'much', 'closer', 'tone', 'mood', 'original', 'somber', 'tale', 'Brothers', 'Grimm', 'many', 'ways', 'actually', 'even', 'darker', 'Instead', 'kiddie', 'flick', 'then', 'what', 'director', 'Michael', 'Cohn', 'crew', 'serve', 'up', 'top-notch', 'gothic', 'horror', 'film.In', 'gloomier', 'version', 'famous', 'fable', 'many', 'familiar', 'elements', 'are', 'wryly', 'skewed', 'example', 'seven', 'men', 'who', 'house', 'heroine', 'here', 'called', 'Lilliana', 'Lilli', 'rather', 'Snow', 'White', 'sojourn', 'forest', 'are', 'not', 'cutsie', 'dwarves', 'one', 'actually', 'dwarfish', 'are', 'instead', 'bunch', 'grubby', 'ruffians', 'who', 'earn', 'living', 'working', 'mines', 'first', 'want', 'use', 'girl', 'obtain', 'ransom', 'wealthy', 'father', 'soon', 'develop', 'sort', 'fatherly', 'affection', 'clever', 'twist', 'when', 'hero', 'Lilli', 'fallen', 'comatose', 'eating', 'cursed', 'apple', 'Instead', 'awakening', 'enchanted', 'kiss', 'repeatedly', 'midriff', 'desperation', 'thereby', 'dislodging', 'piece', 'fruit', 'sort', 'primitive', 'version', 'Heimlich', 'Maneuver', 'Such', 'changes', 'narrative', 'characterization', 'are', 'perceptively', 'clever', 'make', 'tale', 'much', 'more', 'realistic', 'believable', 'animated', 'ancestor', 'However', 'deliciously', 'sardonic', 'tweaking', 'remaining', 'story', 'core', 'familiar', 'enduring', 'moral', 'wit', 'basic', 'goodness', 'will', 'always', 'triumph', 'hatefulness', 'vanity', 'latter', 'are', 'ultimately', 'self-destructive.In', 'role', 'wicked', 'stepmother', 'as', 'well', 'evil', 'mirror', 'reflection', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'superbly', 'malevolent', 'performance', 'destroy', 'beautiful', 'stepdaughter', 'lovely', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'most', 'recently', 'seen', 'horror', 'fans', 'playing', 'buxom', 'Lori', 'Campbell', '2003', 'FREDDY', 'VS.', 'JASON', 'very', 'affecting', 'job', 'object', 'Weaver', 'disdain', 'i.e.', 'Lilli', 'Gil', 'Bellows', 'very', 'convincing', 'interesting', 'hero', 'tacit', 'love', 'interest', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'fine', 'job', 'heroine', 'mostly', 'clueless', 'father', 'film', 'realism', 'further', 'bolstered', 'outstanding', 'supporting', 'performances', 'talents', 'Brian', 'Glover', 'Frances', 'Cuka', 'David', 'Conrad', 'Anthony', 'Brophy', 'Christopher', 'Bauer', 'numerous', 'others.With', 'SNOW', 'WHITE', 'TALE', 'OF', 'TERROR', 'director', 'Michael', 'Cohn', 'scripters', 'Tom', 'Szollosi', 'amp', 'Deborah', 'Serra', 'recreate', 'tenebrous', 'tone', 'Grimm', 'Brother', 'original', 'story', 'same', 'time', 'subtly', 'thumb', 'noses', 'saccharine', 'white-washed', 'Disney', 'interpretation', 'Mike', 'Southon', 'beautiful', 'cinematography', 'deliberately', 'warm', 'side', 'spectrum', 'generating', 'autumnal', 'ambiance', 'perfectly', 'suited', 'plot', 'creative', 'art', 'direction', 'Peter', 'Russell', 'outstanding', 'pseudo-medieval', 'production', 'design', 'Gemma', 'Jackson', 'clever', 'quot', 'period', 'quot', 'costume', 'designs', 'Marit', 'Allen', 'Charles', 'Knode', 'add', 'detail', 'film', 'greatly', 'spooky', 'ambiance', 'fairy-tale', 'quality', 'twisted', 'fable.The', 'DVD', 'Universal', 'Studios', 'Home', 'Video', 'clean', 'crisp', 'digital', 'transfer', 'original', 'widescreen', 'aspect', 'ratio', '1.85:1', 'Alas', 'only', 'letterbox', 'widescreen', 'not', 'anamorphic', 'still', 'beautiful', 'only', 'real', 'bonus', 'feature', 'trailer', 'film', 'curiously', 'using', 'one', 'numerous', 'alternate', 'titles', 'disc', 'very', 'reasonably', 'priced', 'though', 'so', 'fans', 'old-fashioned', 'gothic', 'horror', 'grim', 'Grimm', 'fairy', 'tales', 'are', 'hereby', 'advised', 'add', 'SNOW', 'WHITE', 'TALE', 'OF', 'TERROR', 'collections']",Snow White:a Tale of Terror VHS

Lilli's new stepmother, Claudia (Sigourney Weaver), is obsessed with her own vanity, in more ways than one. She is determined that no one around her will be as attractive as she, or steal her new husband's attention away from her for even a moment. Soon, Claudia is with child, and when the baby is born dead, Claudia places all her anger and blame on Lilli. In her distraught condition, a new character emerges to take advantage of the situation. Something evil lives within the doors of Claudia's heirloom Vanity. Her mother's wicked mirror begins to tempt and guide Claudia into a life of cruelty and witchcraft. In no time, she has Lilli running for her life at every turn. The lovely young girl soon finds herself living with a nest of outcasts in the forest who spend their days working in a mine and their nights in unrest. At first, they are cruel to the girl whom they see as a spoiled ""princess,"" but after saving her more than once, and at much sacrifice, they grow to love her. But the wicked Claudia has a final trick up her sleeve: an apple that will put Lilli in her coffin and test the loyalty of her newfound friends.Snow White: A Tale of Terror, is one of the best versions of the classic fairytale I have ever seen (second only to the Disney telling)! Without discarding the black magic, this live-action Snow White story takes a much more realistic view on the events of the well-known fable. The film works perfectly as both a fairytale, AND a scary movie (yes, it gets pretty intense at times), thanks to the rare and enchanting charm and beauty of Monica Keena and the outstanding performance of Sigourney Weaver. You've never seen such a wicked stepmother as this! The characters are developed in such realistic ways without leaving unanswered questions of why they feel the things they feel. The entire film is totally believable. Beautifully shot in perfect locations with wonderful sets and costumes, this movie is a feast for the eyes as much as a thrilling adventure.

I realize this is the original version of the classic but I didn't enjoy this movie at all. I can kind of see why it's not very popular. I think I vaguely remember it from years ago but it's not a movie anyone seems to remember or know of. I can't remember if this was in theaters or just on video.I think Weaver did a great job as the queen but the film was too slow, dark and boring to me. Scenes switched here and there and a lot of the film was very confusing. I watched it twice to make sure I was giving it a chance but I just couldn't get myself to like it. The acting was very good and the characters were okay but the film itself was just too slow.I was surprised I didn't like it since I love period movies based on classic tales but this didn't do it for me. Also the story was supposed to be scary and it wasn't. It looked more like a vehicle to showcase Weaver's skills at playing evil than to focus on the story. They showed the queen more than Snow White which really threw me off.This wasn't my thing but I won't say others shouldn't watch it. Maybe this is one of these films that comes down to matter of opinion. Some people might think it's great and others will not be able to stand it.

So having waited until the mood was right and darkness had fallen all around, and combed down the hairs on the back of my neck in anticipation, I plugged in the disk and sat back, ready for the goosebumps.It couldn't have started out better, with dark woods and snarling wolves and terrified horses and carriages and miscarriages and Poe-sque manors.. I settled deeper into the couch and pushed my popcorn a notch away to make sure I wouldn't knock it over if I got too startled.And then the movie was over. Perhaps Siggy was called over to focus on Alien Resurrection, and stop wasting her time on fairy tales. The rest of the movie seemed like a waste of time and celluloid. I couldn't blame them for trying, but it never got more than a lifted eyebrow from me. Too formulated, too sterotypical gothic, too predictable, too well defined, too belabored. There were tons of opportunities to make your skin crawl - the witch makeover, the mutely sinister Gustaf, the creaky mirror cabinet, getting lost in an eerie forest, medeival castles and dungeons. But the director only succeeded in making it all too iconic, too futile, too contrived. In the end, there is nothing very remarkable when you tout a different 'spin' of a well-told tale, but good being good and bad being bad and the former triumphing over the latter in just precisely the way you would expect.I see all the other glowing reviews of this movie, and wonder if there is something I missed. Perhaps. But a good movie shouldn't let you miss anything. It should hold you with a glittering eye. As did Alien. 1, 2, and Resurrection (well, almost). Even when I watch them today for the nth time. To be brutal - I think Sigourney was wasted.

430495,A37AV0MSYOEAPP,630464972X,spackar,"[1, 7]","Overall I very much enjoyed ""Snow White, A Tale of Terror"". I thought that the acting and cinematography were excellent. I love the dark, gothic atmosphere of the film. Sigourney Weaver did an excellent job as the increasingly mad witch, Lady Claudia. I have three main points of contention with the film:1. The accents! This film has such a realistic look and feel of the middle ages. However the actors speak in American accents! They should have cast British actors or at least insisted that the cast speak in British accents. That would have been much more appropriate.2. Monica Keena is miscast as Lilliana/Snow White. Snow White should be a gorgeous young woman on the cusp of adulthood. Monica Keena is too short, does not have a womanly figure, and as cute as she is, she is simply not pretty enough to play Snow White. Overall she is too girlish.3. Sam Neill as the nobleman father of Snow White.In keeping with the original story, the production should have kept him a King, not merely a nobleman. Additionally, I found Sam Neill to be a rather dull choice for his role. I would have preferred a younger, more handsome and romantic actor. He simply does not seem like someone who would inspire such obessive love and devotion in Lady Claudia.",3,Mixed Review,1256256000,"10 23, 2009",2009,1252,"['Overall', 'very', 'much', 'enjoyed', 'Snow', 'White', 'A', 'Tale', 'Terror', 'thought', 'acting', 'cinematography', 'were', 'excellent', 'love', 'dark', 'gothic', 'atmosphere', 'film', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'did', 'excellent', 'job', 'increasingly', 'mad', 'witch', 'Lady', 'Claudia', 'have', 'three', 'main', 'points', 'contention', 'film:1', 'accents', 'film', 'realistic', 'look', 'feel', 'middle', 'ages', 'However', 'actors', 'speak', 'American', 'accents', 'should', 'have', 'cast', 'British', 'actors', 'least', 'insisted', 'cast', 'speak', 'British', 'accents', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'much', 'more', 'appropriate.2', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'miscast', 'Lilliana/Snow', 'White', 'Snow', 'White', 'should', 'be', 'gorgeous', 'young', 'woman', 'cusp', 'adulthood', 'Monica', 'Keena', 'too', 'short', 'not', 'have', 'womanly', 'figure', 'as', 'cute', 'simply', 'not', 'pretty', 'enough', 'play', 'Snow', 'White', 'Overall', 'too', 'girlish.3', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'nobleman', 'father', 'Snow', 'White.In', 'keeping', 'original', 'story', 'production', 'should', 'have', 'kept', 'King', 'not', 'merely', 'nobleman', 'Additionally', 'found', 'Sam', 'Neill', 'be', 'rather', 'dull', 'choice', 'role', 'would', 'have', 'preferred', 'younger', 'more', 'handsome', 'romantic', 'actor', 'simply', 'not', 'seem', 'someone', 'who', 'would', 'inspire', 'such', 'obessive', 'love', 'devotion', 'Lady', 'Claudia']",Snow White:a Tale of Terror VHS

This film is actually quite good with a solid script and some excellent performances by all the principles, especially the actress playing Snow White as well as Sigorney Weaver and Gill Bellows, who has a handful of lines but has a terrific energy onscreen.  Even the smaller supporting roles are inhabited by character actors you'll recognize who bring depth to their parts.The film is beautiful, gothic and spooky in the best Medievel ways.  This film is actually much better than the newer version with Charlize Theron and Kristin Stewart, mainly because of a stronger script and a MUCH better actress playing Snow.  My only wish was that they would have spoken in period language with English accents instead of contemporary English with American accents.  Even so, you get used to that rather quickly.

430500,A1K2GGPMA6GK6U,630464972X,Zombilicious,"[4, 4]","Based on the classic fairytale with a darker twist.  A little girl's father remarries a nasty step mother.  The step mother tries to have her killed and girl is forced to flee.  She gets lost into he forest and stumbles across some guys who take her in.  The step mother finds her and tricks her into eating an apple.  Later she is awakened by ""prince charming"" ......and then returns to face her stepmother.Very good movie with Sigourney Weaver, a beautiful dresser, and zombie-like servants.  The ""dwarves"" were turned into a band of runaway criminals (with unfair convictions). Behind it all there is a little bit of romance,  a little bit of suspense and some general creepiness.Up until the middle, the movie presents the tale with a realistic twist in the sense that the step mother does not have supernatural powers.  At first it seems like she just went insane and paranoid.  The step mother miscarries a child, which gives her a mental break where she starts talking to mirrors and accusing everyone of conspiracy, etc.Around this time, the movie goes down a little and they spin it into the typical fantasy/witchcraft tale.  As it turns out, the step mother does possess magical powers that she uses against snow white.  This in itself isn't too terrible because that's how the well-known story goes.  However, I found it a little disappointing because  I think it would have been ten times better if they kept going on the realistic side.",4,dark and twisted fairy tale,1152230400,"07 7, 2006",2006,1449,"['Based', 'classic', 'fairytale', 'darker', 'twist', 'little', 'girl', 'father', 'nasty', 'step', 'mother', 'step', 'mother', 'tries', 'have', 'killed', 'girl', 'forced', 'flee', 'lost', 'forest', 'stumbles', 'guys', 'who', 'take', 'step', 'mother', 'tricks', 'eating', 'apple', 'Later', 'awakened', 'prince', 'charming', 'then', 'returns', 'face', 'stepmother.Very', 'good', 'movie', 'Sigourney', 'Weaver', 'beautiful', 'dresser', 'zombie-like', 'servants', 'dwarves', 'were', 'turned', 'band', 'runaway', 'criminals', 'unfair', 'convictions', 'little', 'bit', 'romance', 'little', 'bit', 'suspense', 'general', 'creepiness.Up', 'middle', 'movie', 'tale', 'realistic', 'twist', 'sense', 'step', 'mother', 'not', 'have', 'supernatural', 'powers', 'first', 'just', 'went', 'insane', 'paranoid', 'step', 'mother', 'child', 'mental', 'break', 'where', 'talking', 'mirrors', 'accusing', 'everyone', 'conspiracy', 'time', 'movie', 'down', 'little', 'spin', 'typical', 'fantasy/witchcraft', 'tale', 'out', 'step', 'mother', 'possess', 'magical', 'powers', 'snow', 'white', ""n't"", 'too', 'terrible', 'how', 'well-known', 'story', 'However', 'found', 'little', 'disappointing', 'think', 'would', 'have', 'been', 'ten', 'times', 'better', 'kept', 'going', 'realistic', 'side']",Snow White:a Tale of Terror VHS
