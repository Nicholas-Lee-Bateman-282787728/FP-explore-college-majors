175197,A1CNDQIH0RRHS1,1419827154,Adrienne B.,"[0, 0]","I feel this movie really tears at one's emotions in a good, happy way. It's about an orphan boy who believes that one day he'll find his parents through the use of his music. It has a really great story, even though a lot of it is hard to believe. Like the fact that the boy never had any musical training, but can pick up a guitar for the first time and automatically just start playing it like a pro, or how he had never seen a note written down before in his life yet somehow is able to write an entire musical score in a half a days time.I do want to say that the music in it is amazing. Very catchy, yet emotionally powerful.All the same, this is a great family movie which is enjoyable and fun to watch as long as you dont pay too much attention to how impossible some of what happens really is.

The story begins with Keri Russel and Jonathan Rhys Meyers playing Lyla and Louis, 2 individuals involved in music in different ways.  Lyla is with the philharmonic and Louis is in a band.  They meet one night, have a deep connection and then Lyla is forced away by her father.  Lyla becomes pregnant and ends up in an accident.  Her father tells her the baby died, but we then turn to the baby turned into an 11 year old at a boys home.  The story then becomes about Evan (August Rush) and his journey throughout New York in order to play his music to find his parents.  There are some really great moments in the movie, but you have to be able to put doubt about Lyla hearing Evan's symphony and knowing that is her son aside and just enjoy the movie.",3,Decent Movie,1361836800,"02 26, 2013",2013,862,"['Let', 'be', 'up', 'front', 'right', 'now', 'movie', 'more', 'faith', 'music', 'connecting', 'everybody', 'anything', 'story', 'Keri', 'Russel', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'playing', 'Lyla', 'Louis', '2', 'individuals', 'involved', 'music', 'different', 'ways', 'Lyla', 'philharmonic', 'Louis', 'band', 'meet', 'one', 'night', 'have', 'deep', 'connection', 'then', 'Lyla', 'forced', 'away', 'father', 'Lyla', 'pregnant', 'up', 'accident', 'father', 'baby', 'died', 'then', 'turn', 'baby', 'turned', '11', 'year', 'old', 'boys', 'home', 'story', 'then', 'Evan', 'August', 'Rush', 'journey', 'New', 'York', 'order', 'play', 'music', 'find', 'parents', 'are', 'really', 'great', 'moments', 'movie', 'have', 'be', 'able', 'put', 'doubt', 'Lyla', 'hearing', 'Evan', 'symphony', 'knowing', 'son', 'aside', 'just', 'enjoy', 'movie']",N/A

And boy, does this film deliver!I wasn't surprised to see Nick Castle's hand in the screenplay, as he is an old hand at finding magic in our cynical world (he wrote and directed ""The Boy Who Could Fly""); here, we have the story of two incredibly gifted musicians, a Julliard-trained cellist (Keri Russell), and a self-taught Irish rock singer/composer (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), who bond under the stars in New York City, then are torn apart by families with their own agendas. She carries his child, but after an accident, her ambitious father (William Sadler) steals the newborn, dumps the baby into social services, and announces to the daughter that the child had died. What is MEANT to be, never happens, the lives of both musicians unravel, and they soon give up their gifts, for mundane careers...as their unknown child (the remarkable Freddie Highmore) grows into a musical prodigy, on a mission to find them.The bulk of the film deals with the child's search, and the remarkable people he meets along the way, from a sympathetic welfare worker (Terrence Howard), to a gifted child guitarist and his Fagin-like mentor (Leon Thomas III and Robin Williams, who is creepy, but excellent), and finally, a powerful child gospel singer, and her pastor (Jamia Simone Nash and Mykelti Williamson). Dubbed 'August Rush' by Williams, the boy harnesses his prodigious musical talents, even as his parents individually renew their own musical careers, and are drawn back to New York City, and a tear-inducing, spectacular climax. Predictable? You bet, but I dare you not to be moved, anyway!The performances are first-rate, particularly from the child actors, and the music is awesome.

The basic ingredients make this so: a healthy helping of a cute young kid (Freddie Highmore,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory), a dose of a busted-up, romantic, musical couple (Keri Russell,Scrubs, and Jonathan Rhys Meyers,Match Point), and the sprinkling of a slimy vagabond (Robin Williams,Happy Feet).Highmore has come a long way in his short life. Having immensely enjoyed his portrayal as Peter inFinding Neverland, I have followed the career path of this super-young-star with interest. Most recently he's starred inThe Golden Compassand The Spiderwick Chronicles, two blockbuster films. Whoever his agent is, they've done a fantastic job.But Highmore has never taken on a role quite as focused as August Rush before. He tended to be overshadowed by the larger than life actors that played beside him (Johnny Depp, Anjelica Huston, etc.). But this time, the focus is all on his character, Evan/August Rush. His name change from Evan to August is affected by the wayward homeless musician ""The Wizard"" played by Robin Williams. The slime-factor is high for Williams here, higher than I've ever seen from him. This also made the story much more interesting and made you dislike Williams' Wizard character in the extreme.The love story between Lyla (Keri Russell) and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is executed well if a bit distant and unrealistic. Their one night stand that results in a pregnancy becomes the culminating factor that binds all of the characters together. Well ...that ...and music, of course.Evan (Highmore) is lost amidst the U.S. orphanage industry until he eventually makes good his escape. He carries with him only his belief that music will somehow connect him with his unknown parents. He's lived music his entire, short life, so whenever he comes into contact with an instrument (be it a guitar or a piano) he quickly grasps its workings and can play it within moments. A prodigy, he's soon called by those that know him. Pulling him away from his dreams, however, is The Wizard, a man who wants to personally capitalize on Evan's astounding abilities by prostituting him to the highest bidder ...the highest bidder willing to pay his manager (i.e., The Wizard).Juilliard is offered up to Evan, and he quickly surpasses all those before him. But he still hasn't found his parents (who are also musicians), and a concert in New York's Central Park soon beckons them together. It's so sweet it'll make your eye-teeth ache.Even with its overly-sweet beginning, middle, and end, August Rush is something of a must for those who enjoy unique musical playing and the process of melodious discovery.Just don't eat any chocolate while watching it.",3,Too Sweet For Some...,1205366400,"03 13, 2008",2008,2774,"['***CONTAINS', 'SPOILERS***Schmaltzy', 'predictable', 'AUGUST', 'RUSH', 'will', 'still', 'manage', 'please', 'most', 'movie-goers', 'basic', 'ingredients', 'make', 'so', 'healthy', 'helping', 'cute', 'young', 'kid', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'dose', 'busted-up', 'romantic', 'musical', 'couple', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'Scrubs', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'Match', 'Point', 'sprinkling', 'slimy', 'vagabond', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Happy', 'Feet', '.Highmore', 'come', 'long', 'way', 'short', 'life', 'Having', 'immensely', 'enjoyed', 'portrayal', 'Peter', 'inFinding', 'Neverland', 'have', 'followed', 'career', 'path', 'super-young-star', 'interest', 'Most', 'recently', 'starred', 'inThe', 'Golden', 'Compassand', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'two', 'blockbuster', 'films', 'Whoever', 'agent', ""'ve"", 'done', 'fantastic', 'job.But', 'Highmore', 'never', 'taken', 'role', 'quite', 'as', 'focused', 'August', 'Rush', 'before', 'tended', 'be', 'overshadowed', 'larger', 'life', 'actors', 'played', 'Johnny', 'Depp', 'Anjelica', 'Huston', 'etc.', 'time', 'focus', 'character', 'Evan/August', 'Rush', 'name', 'change', 'Evan', 'August', 'affected', 'wayward', 'homeless', 'musician', 'Wizard', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'slime-factor', 'high', 'Williams', 'here', 'higher', ""'ve"", 'ever', 'seen', 'also', 'made', 'story', 'much', 'more', 'interesting', 'made', 'dislike', 'Williams', 'Wizard', 'character', 'extreme.The', 'love', 'story', 'Lyla', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'Louis', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'executed', 'well', 'bit', 'distant', 'unrealistic', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'results', 'pregnancy', 'culminating', 'factor', 'characters', 'together', 'Well', 'music', 'course.Evan', 'Highmore', 'lost', 'U.S.', 'orphanage', 'industry', 'eventually', 'good', 'escape', 'only', 'belief', 'music', 'will', 'somehow', 'connect', 'unknown', 'parents', 'lived', 'music', 'entire', 'short', 'life', 'so', 'contact', 'instrument', 'be', 'guitar', 'piano', 'quickly', 'grasps', 'workings', 'can', 'play', 'moments', 'prodigy', 'soon', 'called', 'know', 'Pulling', 'away', 'dreams', 'however', 'Wizard', 'man', 'who', 'personally', 'capitalize', 'Evan', 'astounding', 'abilities', 'prostituting', 'highest', 'bidder', 'highest', 'bidder', 'willing', 'pay', 'manager', 'i.e.', 'Wizard', '.Juilliard', 'offered', 'up', 'Evan', 'quickly', 'still', ""n't"", 'found', 'parents', 'who', 'are', 'also', 'musicians', 'concert', 'New', 'York', 'Central', 'Park', 'soon', 'beckons', 'together', 'so', 'sweet', ""'ll"", 'make', 'eye-teeth', 'ache.Even', 'overly-sweet', 'beginning', 'middle', 'end', 'August', 'Rush', 'something', 'must', 'who', 'enjoy', 'unique', 'musical', 'playing', 'process', 'melodious', 'discovery.Just', 'do', ""n't"", 'eat', 'chocolate', 'watching']",N/A

In the wind... in the air... in the light. It's all around us. All you have to do is open yourself up. All you have to do... is listen.=============================August Rush is a fairy tale of a film, a really inspiring story of a boy in an orphanage who dreams of finding his parents--hearing music in the world and also inside himself that leads him ever onward in his quest. Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) likes music ""more than food"" and he has talent to burn. He is a musical prodigy with an incredible gift.He goes to New York where, drawn to the music, he finds the lair of Wizard (Robin Williams)--a Fagin-like entrepenuer, but instead of grooming pickpockets like Aftful Dodger, he grooms buskers like Arthur (Leon Thomas III). Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace is a complex character, creepy and malevolent--but not entirely evil as he does believe in the power and grace of music. It is just that, when faced with someone as talented as Evan, he can't resist the temptation to exploit his talent. He does, however, give the boy a guitar and a flashy stage name: August Rush.--------------Wizard: You know what music is? God's little reminder that there's something else besides us in this universe, a harmonic connection between all living beings, every where, even the stars.======================Robin Williams, master of comedy, is also adept at playing creepy sociopaths, such as Seymour Parrish in One Hour Photo or Rainbow Randolph in Death to Smoochy. His Wizard is perhaps his best creepy sociopath yet, and he wins the best of show award here.Meanwhile, Evan's mother Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell), a cellist, is trying to find him, and his father, Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is trying to find Lyla. Louis is also a musician, naturally, and he sings and plays bass in a rock band. When the cops try to take down Wizard's squat, August rushes off and seeks sanctuary in a Gospel church. He hears some really good Gospel singing there, especially from a young girl named Hope (Jamia Simone Nash). She teaches him to read music, and about one second later he starts writing his Opus One, August's Rhapsody in C Major. Hope sees his music and goes to tell the Reverand about it. When they find him at the church organ, they hear his obvious talent and send him immediately to Julliard.If this all sounds a little hard to swallow, it isn't. The film spins its fairy tale with such finesse that you are perfectly willing to suspend your disbelief. The music is great, especially the parts where August Rush discovers the guitar. Some really great singing by Jamia Simone Nash and Leon Thomas III, who both, by the way, have sung on The Backyardigans (who are HUGE to the toddler crowd, just ask my great nephew, Casson Hunter Porter). I wondered if Leon Thomas III was related to Leon Thomas who is known for his work with Pharoah Sanders, particularly the 1969 song ""The Creator Has a Master Plan"" from Sanders' Karma album. Thomas's most distinctive device was that he often broke out into yodeling. This style influenced James Moody and Tim Buckley, among others. It would have made for a really good story, but apparently the two Leon Thomases are not related.Nevertheless, August Rush is quite inspiring, and fun for the whole family. Freddie Highmore did a fantastic job as August Rush, and I see that he was also Charlie Bucket in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Peter Llewelyn Davies in Finding Neverland--both with Johnny Depp. Add to that August Rush, and the young Mr. Highmore has made quite an impressive fairy tale triptych.^^^^^^^^^^^^^Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Edition)(2005) ....

I like to imagine that what I hear came from my mother and father. Maybe the notes I hear, are the same ones they heard, the night they met. Maybe that's how they found each other. Maybe that's how they'll find me.

My apologies to everyone who loved it, but the truth is that I hated it. It's not that the film maker didn't know how to make a movie; it's that the film he spent so much time creating was simply trite.I don't care about the film not being believable. I can handle fantasy, even in realistic settings. The problem is the film's premise about music being a kind of Star Wars like Force that binds the world together. I love the idea that the kid can hear music in everything, but it just becomes silly by the end. The way everything resolves is not only ridiculous but predictable. The film is basically a cross betweenForrest Gump (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition),Mr. Holland's Opus, andOliver Twist.In other word's we've seen it all before. We've seen it done better.

175241,A18G7GG53G2X8A,1419827154,Chris Pandolfi,"[232, 242]","""August Rush"" is a fairy tale. It doesn't have princes, princesses, evil stepmothers, witches, or big bad wolves, but it's a fairy tale nonetheless. And as such, it tells a story that resonates so strongly with its audience that it casts a magic spell. This movie is told in the language of music, and it exemplifies the harmonic connections between people, the rhythmic bonds that can never be broken in spite of distance and time. It's also told in the language of faith, of the belief that love will indeed conquer all. No, this is not a realistic idea, but that's not the point. Isn't it nice that we have films like this to escape to when realism is bringing us down? Isn't it wonderful when we find that one film that can raise our spirits? ""August Rush"" was that film for me, and I recommend it to anyone in need of a rejuvenating emotional boost.The film stars Freddie Highmore as an orphan named Evan Taylor, a quiet yet determined musical prodigy. He was born as the result of a chance encounter between two musicians: an Irish rock guitarist named Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and a classically trained American cellist named Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell). While living in New York City, they met and separated through twists of fate--Lyla's controlling father (William Sadler) doesn't take the news of her unplanned pregnancy very well, and when she's hit by a car and injured, he uses that opportunity to make her believe that her baby did not survive. In reality, the baby was delivered and put into the legal system as a parentless orphan. Lyla and Louis go their separate ways, believing that they would never see each other again.In the present day, their eleven-year-old son Evan lives in an orphanage with a number of broken-spirited boys. They're so disillusioned that they bully him into believing as they do. They constantly tell him that no one is coming for him, that his ability to hear music in everything makes him nothing more than a freak. And they will not stand for his belief that he actually hears the music of his parents calling out to him. But Evan refuses to sink to their level of hopelessness; he runs away to New York City, where the music seems to be beckoning him towards his destiny. It's there he meets Wizard (Robin Williams), a shady musician who houses a number of musically inclined children in an abandoned theater. He, too, is beaten down by life, so much so that he uses these children for his own financial gain. When he discovers Evan's natural ability to play the guitar, he gives him the pseudonym August Rush and forces him to perform in parks and on street corners.Lyla, meanwhile, is living in Chicago as a music teacher. Single and without any children, she seems complacent yet stable in her new life. But all that changes when (1) she's offered a change to once again play with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, and (2) she learns that her baby did not die eleven years ago. With a powerful yet unexplainable determination, she travels back to New York on a quest to find her long lost son, a quest that will hopefully be added by her playing of the cello. Hoping to help find Evan is Richard Jeffries (Terrence Howard), a social worker who met the boy when he was still living at the orphanage.And then, of course, there's Louis, who has since gone on to be a businessman in San Francisco. His band members haven't forgiven him for leaving, least of all his brother, Marshall (Alex O'Loughlin). But worst of all, Louis hasn't been able to forgive himself, and upon seeing footage of himself performing on stage, he remembers the love he felt for Lyla. The memory is so strong that's he vows to reunite with her. This journey of finding lost love leads him from Chicago back to New York City, where he's inspired to rejoin with his band and restart his singing career. Much like his son--whom he doesn't know exists--Louis is a gifted guitar player; one can hear his passion and energy with every chord, and his music operates at the same frequency as Lyla's cello playing.As you can probably tell, most of the film thrives on serendipity, and it gets more and more prominent with every passing scene. A kind-hearted pastor eventually takes Evan in, and when made aware of his musical genius, they send him to the Julliard School of Music. He composes a piece within the first six months of his stay, one that the faculty believes is good enough to be performed. Thus sets into motion the events leading to one of the most satisfying endings of any movie I've seen this year, a scene so touching that I was in awe. As I listened to Evan's ""August's Rhapsody,"" I felt as if I had been enveloped in the folds of hope, love, and happiness; the earthiness of the chimes blended perfectly with the smoothness of the violins and the energy of the guitars, all of which made his unwavering faith in the power of connection perfectly clear.This is the magic of ""August Rush,"" a film so wonderful that I cannot recommend it enough. It's a modern day fable with a timeless message, and it comes across so well that I never once stopped to consider how implausible it is. Plausibility doesn't even come into play, here. What does come into play is the emotional impact, the sense that we can get something out of it if we surrender to pure fantasy. Evan opens the film by saying, ""Music is all around us--all we have to do is listen."" This is one of the year's best films, and if you keep that quote in mind when seeing it, you'll be more inclined to agree.",5,The Music that Brings Us Together,1195516800,"11 20,

175242,A1OVYZPXPB0RKB,1419827154,"C.J. Darlington ""Author of Thicker Than Blood...","[27, 28]","11-year-old Evan wants nothing more in life than to find his parents, or for them to find him. Labeled a freak by his fellow boys home residents it isn't long before he finds himself on the streets of New York in search of the mother and father he never knew. Like a fish out of water, the sights and sounds of the city that never sleeps are at once overwhelming and intoxicating. In every thumping foot, squealing tire, barking dog and rattling chain he hears a rhythm. Music. Harmonics no one hears but him. He knows if he just follows the music somehow his parents will find him. What he doesn't know is that his parents have no idea he exists.Ten years ago his mother, Lyla (Keri Russell), a gifted celoist, was a young prodigy herself when she met Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), the talented lead singer and guitarist for an Irish rock band. Immediately they share a bond, and their night together changes everything. Can the power of music bring this family of strangers back together again?Don't let the somewhat un-inspiring title August Rush fool you. This movie is a heart-warming film with a rich narrative, visually diverse settings, and a lush original music score. Freddie Highmore's spot-on performance as Evan, who soon takes up the moniker August Rush, immediately invokes our sympathy. We truly care what happens to this bright-eyed, innocent boy who hasn't let himself become jaded by his harsh environment. (If he looks familiar it's probably because of his Charlie and the Chocolate Factory or Finding Neverland fame. He played the lead child roles in both.)But it's not just Highmore who carries this movie. Every actor nails their role beautifully. Keri Russell (perhaps known best for the TV show Felicity) is a natural on the screen, skillfully bringing to life the character of Lyla both as a naive young woman and a passionate mother. Robin Williams' supporting role as a music pimp to a brood of unwanted yet musically gifted children cinches that he can play the deeper roles right alongside his lighter comedy ones. You'll also want to take notice of Terrence Howard's performance as social worker Richard Jeffries, a man in the system who genuinely cares for the kids under his care but often finds his hands frustratingly tied.A few times suspension of disbelief is called for as August Rush is more about the fantastic than the realistic. It's a little hard to believe Evan is able to play both the guitar and organ like a master (not to mention conduct an orchestra) without ever having seen or touched the instruments before in his life. But you really don't mind. This movie has enough heart to carry it above and beyond those moments. Its portrayal of music's magic, that powerful tug on the human heart and soul, sets it apart from your average film tackling the same subjects.Parents will appreciate the filmmaker's tact in portraying Lyla and Louis' one-night stand. No more than the beginnings of a passionate kiss are shown. A few swear words (h-- and d--) probably aren't appropriate for youngsters since several are uttered by children, but they really did have their place in showing you the hard existence of some of the street kids.August Rush reminds us that amidst the hardships there truly is some good left in this world.

This is a delightful story about how he finds his parents, two musically gifted people, who don't know his existence.  Aside from the great soundtrack, the juxtaposing of classical cello and electric guitar, and the riffs Evan/August creates on his guitar, there is also the poignant searching of Evan for his parents, and later his mother for him, and his father for his mother.  The three souls are joined and connected through music.

I must admit that the first time I saw this movie, I was very bored at first.  And, the love story clich&eacute; is nothing original.  ""Oh noes, my rockstar boyfriend is gone!!""  Seen it all before.But, honestly, I got something much different out of this movie than most people seem to have gotten.  While other people seem to be focused on the love story, or that August is a musical prodigy, or that he is bound and determined to find his parents, or what have you, all of that seemed secondary to me.  To me, the real story is how music affects us all, no matter who we are or what kind of music we make.  August's dad is a guitarist and a rock singer who quits his music only to return later, because his life is incomplete without it.  His mother is a classically trained cellist who becomes a music teacher as well as a performer.  Wizard turns to music as a means to an end (teaching the children to play so they can make money for him) and as a source of comfort (playing the harmonica when he loses his best student).  All of the professors at Julliard are moved by the music that August creates.  Is music not the real star of this movie?  Freddie Highmore's character is just a facilitator.

He has never known or met either of his parents, yet he has known most of his life that he was not supposed to be orphaned and both of his parents wanted him. He can hear things all around him, in musical tones whether it be words, wind chimes, the sound of honking horns or birds chirping, it all has a musical resonance to him. The kid is a profound musical prodigy waiting to develop. Although he has never played a musical instrument, the music is inside of him. His belief that his parents are out there somewhere and love him, as well as the music he feels his parents somehow gave to him, drives Evan to run away from the orphanage in search of them. What he finds is much more than he imagined was hiding inside of him all along.There he meets a con artist whose street name is ""Wizard"" (Robin Williams), who once a prodigy like himself shares his ability to hear music in everything around him. Evan chances upon a guitar and masterfully begins to play as his natural talent becomes quite evident. ""Wizard"" changes Evan's name to ""August Rush"", partly to promote the boy's talent, and partly to disguise him as he learns Evan is a runaway and there is a search being conducted to find him. Through a course of events, the two are seperated and Evan (now ""August"") hides out in a church orphanage where his talent is quickly discovered and he is soon enrolled at Juliard School of Music where he composes a masterpiece the school solicits the New York Symphony Orchestra to perform.Evan's parents were Lyla Novacek (Keli Russell) who at the time was an accomplished Cellist with the New York Symphony, and Louis Conelly (the very talented Jonathan Rhys Meyers) an Irish singer and songwriter, who met on one magical night in New York and fell deeply in love with each other. Due to horrible circumstances the two never met again. Both talented musicians left their field of music and pursued other avenues of life. One in San Francisco, the other in Chicago, far from the child neither one knows even exists. Can the faith that drives a child who thinks he can hear his parents through the music they gave him, possibly compose a reconnection of these three lives?This movie is fantasy, and oftentimes throughout, it suffers moments of great lack of reality, nevertheless by then the viewers attention is captured in the awe of it's magic, and reality is no longer expected. The film is charming and pulls on the heart of the viewer to let go and believe in fairy tales. The music in this film is incredible. Highmore (""August"") gives a stellar performance of his character and steals the show completely. Not far behind him is the performance of Jonathan Rhys Meyers (""Louis"") and Keli Russell (""Lyla""). All three of these actors were perfectly suited for the part in which they were cast, performing with incredible feeling and unique talent. The well orchestrated cast of supporting actors, including Robin Williams, give very good performances of their characters as well, bringing the script together in perfect harmony.The DVD offers a scene selection feature as well as a few additional scenes which were edited out of the production. Most of these scenes fit perfectly into the script and a couple of them would have been helpful in their original place. The only negative I can give this film is that the ending was rather disappointing. It builds up for 113 minutes and just as the viewer is expecting to see the end result of a masterful script, the movie ends abruptly. The rest is left to your own imagination. Although it was all spelled out, and the right characters were in place for the moment they belonged in, the film does not deliver the visual crescendo the viewer is longing for. The audience is left screaming for an encore that is never given.

The story of a young boy who has been left to his own resources, and discovers a haven called music is inspiring and dramatic; I can most specifically relate to using music has a source of hope and promise as a boy!The story proceeds with a series of flashbacks that explain how the situation developed that put our talented hero in an orphanage. His love of music, which was strictly generated within him, serves as a focal point for living that helps compensate for the difficulties which life has placed before him.August is blessed with a remarkable talent for music that places him in the child prodigy category. Having no one that cares enough to help him, he must find music in all that surrounds him; as he listens to the ordinary sounds of life he translates that into music in his mind.A basic part of his belief system is a complete, unshakable confidence that his parents love him and want him back. This notion is ridiculed by the other boys in the orphanage but his confidence is not compromised by that.The story takes a big turn when August, who is actually named Evan Taylor, decides to follow the music and finds himself in the totally strange surroundings of New York City. This is where a boy street musician, the ""Artful Dodger"" character, befriends him and takes him to meet the ""Fagin"" character who in this story is called The Wizard, very well played by Robin Williams.The pace of the story picks up from this point onward; the lives of all three, the mother, Lyla, played by Keri Russell, the father, Louis, played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and the son, August/Evan, played by Freddie Highmore are being drawn together by their shared love of music. I will only say that the ending does not disappoint!The copy we watched last night was loaned to us by a friend; I placed an order for a copy of our own this morning with Amazon. I'm already looking forward to seeing it again. By the way, the sound on the disc is very good; there are instrumental solos including a pipe organ that sound fabulous, as well as an unusual blending of rock and classical music used to show the dramatically different lives lead by Lyla and Louis.We thoroughly enjoyed the movie and found it captivating!",5,Music as a Stabilizing Influence on Life,1276473600,"06 14, 2010",2010,2350,"['parallels', 'movie', 'Oliver', 'have', 'been', 'pointed', 'out', 'other', 'reviewers', 'way', 'charm', 'movie', 'story', 'young', 'boy', 'who', 'been', 'left', 'own', 'resources', 'haven', 'called', 'music', 'inspiring', 'dramatic', 'can', 'most', 'specifically', 'relate', 'using', 'music', 'source', 'hope', 'promise', 'boy', 'story', 'proceeds', 'series', 'flashbacks', 'explain', 'how', 'situation', 'developed', 'put', 'talented', 'hero', 'orphanage', 'love', 'music', 'was', 'strictly', 'generated', 'focal', 'point', 'living', 'compensate', 'difficulties', 'life', 'placed', 'him.August', 'blessed', 'remarkable', 'talent', 'music', 'child', 'prodigy', 'category', 'Having', 'one', 'enough', 'help', 'must', 'find', 'music', 'ordinary', 'sounds', 'life', 'music', 'mind.A', 'basic', 'part', 'belief', 'system', 'complete', 'unshakable', 'confidence', 'parents', 'love', 'want', 'back', 'notion', 'ridiculed', 'other', 'boys', 'orphanage', 'confidence', 'not', 'compromised', 'that.The', 'story', 'big', 'turn', 'when', 'August', 'who', 'actually', 'named', 'Evan', 'Taylor', 'follow', 'music', 'totally', 'strange', 'surroundings', 'New', 'York', 'City', 'where', 'boy', 'street', 'musician', 'Artful', 'Dodger', 'character', 'meet', 'Fagin', 'character', 'who', 'story', 'called', 'Wizard', 'very', 'well', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams.The', 'pace', 'story', 'up', 'point', 'onward', 'lives', 'three', 'mother', 'Lyla', 'played', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'father', 'Louis', 'played', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'son', 'August/Evan', 'played', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'are', 'being', 'drawn', 'together', 'shared', 'love', 'music', 'will', 'only', 'say', 'ending', 'not', 'disappoint', 'copy', 'watched', 'last', 'night', 'was', 'loaned', 'friend', 'placed', 'order', 'copy', 'own', 'morning', 'Amazon', ""'m"", 'already', 'looking', 'forward', 'seeing', 'again', 'way', 'sound', 'disc', 'very', 'good', 'are', 'instrumental', 'solos', 'including', 'pipe', 'organ', 'sound', 'fabulous', 'as', 'well', 'unusual', 'blending', 'rock', 'classical', 'music', 'used', 'show', 'dramatically', 'different', 'lives', 'lead', 'Lyla', 'Louis.We', 'thoroughly', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'found', 'captivating']",N/A
175257,A3UM5IR9AZL1WZ,1419827154,"David Crumm ""Editor of ReadTheSpirit magazine""","[4, 4]","In the end, Faith is a yearning for Home that's stronger than Death itself. Many of the great spiritual sages have said this in some form, including Robert Frost, Frederick Buechner, Rob Bell and Jesus himself.Of course, this all depends on how we conceive the idea of ""Home"" -- and ""August Rush"" takes the evolving ""music video"" genre into a transcendent, higher plane to explore one boy's profound yearning for a ""Home"" he never even knew, first hand. If you want something to be thankful for this year, buy this gloriously inventive movie that uses music as a metaphor for this abandoned boy's transcendent desire to reunite his shattered family.Freddie Highmore plays August Rush, whose fantastical musical gifts turn the whole story into a fable about the deepest human desires for Home. The movie borrows liberally from ""Oliver Twist,"" with Robin Williams playing a desperate and, eventually, an absolutely despicable Fagin-like character. Williams is a street-savvy con man who teaches abandoned children to become street musicians in the hope of someday striking it rich by managing a true musical star.At first, this Fagin discovers and befriends August -- but, when the boy's musical talents blossom, he winds up nearly destroying the boy.While that may make the movie sound like a rewarming of leftover storylines, the homage to Charles Dickens only adds to the fairy-tale quality of the film. In fact, it's the magical fusion of musical styles throughout the movie -- from rock and folk to classical to jazzy new renditions of natural and urban soundscapes -- that make this a theatrical experience you won't want to miss.Note to Rob Bell fans! If you love Rob's Nooma film, ""Rhythm"" -- well, ""August Rush"" is like a feature-length meditation on Rob's ""Rhythm"" theme. It's not as theological as Rob's reflection -- but it's the same message loud and clear with similar creative elements in the storytelling.""August Rush"" opens with the abandoned boy who will become famous as a musical prodigy standing all alone in a lush green field of chest-high grasses, conducting the breezes that paint swirls in the moving sea of green and raise whooshing sounds into a symphony of natural noise.He narrates the opening sequence, inviting us to: ""Listen! Can you hear it? The music? I can hear it everywhere,"" he says. ""In the wind. In the air. In the light.""By the end of this film, you'll be hearing it, too, and soaring with little August as high as you'll let this glorious music carry you.",5,"A Glorious Vision of the Realms to Which ""Music Videos"" Can Take Us!",1205020800,"03 9, 2008",2008,2496,"['end', 'Faith', 'yearning', 'Home', 'stronger', 'Death', 'Many', 'great', 'spiritual', 'sages', 'have', 'said', 'form', 'including', 'Robert', 'Frost', 'Frederick', 'Buechner', 'Rob', 'Bell', 'Jesus', 'himself.Of', 'course', 'how', 'conceive', 'idea', 'Home', 'August', 'Rush', 'evolving', 'music', 'video', 'genre', 'transcendent', 'higher', 'plane', 'explore', 'one', 'boy', 'profound', 'yearning', 'Home', 'never', 'even', 'knew', 'first', 'hand', 'want', 'something', 'be', 'thankful', 'year', 'buy', 'gloriously', 'inventive', 'movie', 'music', 'metaphor', 'abandoned', 'boy', 'transcendent', 'desire', 'reunite', 'shattered', 'family.Freddie', 'Highmore', 'August', 'Rush', 'fantastical', 'musical', 'gifts', 'turn', 'whole', 'story', 'fable', 'deepest', 'human', 'desires', 'Home', 'movie', 'liberally', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'playing', 'desperate', 'eventually', 'absolutely', 'despicable', 'Fagin-like', 'character', 'Williams', 'street-savvy', 'con', 'man', 'who', 'abandoned', 'children', 'become', 'street', 'musicians', 'hope', 'someday', 'striking', 'rich', 'managing', 'true', 'musical', 'star.At', 'first', 'Fagin', 'discovers', 'August', 'when', 'boy', 'musical', 'talents', 'blossom', 'up', 'nearly', 'destroying', 'boy.While', 'may', 'make', 'movie', 'sound', 'rewarming', 'leftover', 'storylines', 'homage', 'Charles', 'Dickens', 'only', 'fairy-tale', 'quality', 'film', 'fact', 'magical', 'fusion', 'musical', 'styles', 'movie', 'rock', 'folk', 'classical', 'jazzy', 'new', 'renditions', 'natural', 'urban', 'soundscapes', 'make', 'theatrical', 'experience', 'wo', ""n't"", 'want', 'miss.Note', 'Rob', 'Bell', 'fans', 'love', 'Rob', 'Nooma', 'film', 'Rhythm', 'well', 'August', 'Rush', 'feature-length', 'meditation', 'Rob', 'Rhythm', 'theme', 'not', 'as', 'theological', 'Rob', 'reflection', 'same', 'message', 'loud', 'clear', 'similar', 'creative', 'elements', 'storytelling', 'August', 'Rush', 'abandoned', 'boy', 'who', 'will', 'become', 'famous', 'musical', 'prodigy', 'standing', 'alone', 'lush', 'green', 'field', 'chest-high', 'grasses', 'conducting', 'breezes', 'paint', 'swirls', 'moving', 'sea', 'green', 'raise', 'whooshing', 'sounds', 'symphony', 'natural', 'noise.He', 'opening', 'sequence', 'inviting', 'Listen', 'Can', 'hear', 'music', 'can', 'hear', 'everywhere', 'wind', 'air', 'light', 'end', 'film', ""'ll"", 'be', 'hearing', 'too', 'soaring', 'little', 'August', 'as', 'high', ""'ll"", 'let', 'glorious', 'music', 'carry']",N/A

175262,A1JV4QKTEB7QBL,1419827154,"Diana F. Von Behren ""reneofc""","[4, 7]","Whether or not the implausible plot of director Kirsten Sheridan's 2007 ""August Rush"" makes much sense or not, the film moves with its own frenetic momentum; the urgent momentum of the music heard inside the head of its main character Evan Taylor a.k.a. August Rush (played by the serious Freddie Highmore of ""Finding Neverland""), musical genius extraordinaire of the caliber of a latter-day Amadeus Mozart.Ordinary sounds like that of the grass blowing in the breeze and the wind hitting an old brass wind chime filter through this child's brain and transform to melodies of symphonic perfection.  From the first few opening frames of the film, there is no doubt in the mind of the viewer that Evan definitely possesses that quirky quality akin to all masterminds, be it the mathematical autistic savant speaking in logarithms or yet another John Nash hearing aliens speak to him through glimpses of magazine and newspaper text.  Through almost monotonous repetition, Sheridan insures that the audience immerses itself in sensing yet not fully understanding this wondrous creative treat--how often do we get to explore the mind of someone of higher perceptive powers?Making use of his unique gift, Evan, living in a home for boys, decides that hearing his personal compositions will provide the means to bring his parents to him in a lyrical happy-ever-after.  We hear his music too (thanks to Mark Mancina's soundtrack) and like the fairytale rats of Hamlin follow this Pied Piper to the streets of New York City where Evan becomes synonymous with Dicken's Oliver Twist complete with an acoustic guitar toting Artful Dodger and somewhat manic-prone-to-violence Fagan (a cowboy hat wearing mutton-chopped Robin Williams.)As Evan wanders through the arch in Washington Square and the abandoned Filmore East Theatre in pursuit of his music, we flash back and forth from the moment of his conception by rock star Louis (the ever intense Jonathan Rhys Meyers) and classical cellist Lyla (America's sweetheart Keri Russell.) Separated by factions that again seem conjured from a world replete with evil stepmothers, the two live their floundering lives in different cities fully conscious of the black hole created by their estranged existences.As Evan's musical ability purrs into a startling fifth gear, the trio moves steadily towards each other like a convergence of heavenly bodies in the night sky in a somewhat wannabe facsimile of a Christmas miracle exemplified with a hopeful magical star. ZZZZzzzzzzz . . .Bottom line?  Although ""August Rush"" assembles a fine group of actors to play out one boy's musical rhapsody with all the trimmings, the overall presentation seems overly slick--dusted with a coating of improbable sweetness that may work for family fare if a double dose of sugar is in order but does not contain enough real poignancy to satisfy an adult viewer.  Instead, the film mirrors a tale out of Dickens with all the convenient serendipity and none of the genuine menace to elicit human response or concern.  Highmore pours on the spacey-ness with an almost beatific grin and glow that the best of the litany of saints cannot duplicate while Russell and Rhys Meyers come together with a too-perfect simplicity that moves like a sticky snowball at the light speed of the music.  Williams plays this one too over the top for me--he tries for three dimensional when only one is needed.

175267,A3UAVYY80HNFZW,1419827154,drefractor,"[5, 10]","August Rush is set around the feel-good magic of mystical musical bonds that occur between 3 of the 4 main characters of the movie; a family physically separated but spiritually aware of one-another. Their link is pure wondrous fantasy and there's nothing wrong with that, but then we are presented with the mechanism with which the 3 will be united -- it is there that I find a huge difficulty in liking this movie.I love music as a listener and performer and have always felt that it has a magical quality to it. But a good fantasy (for me) always takes an element of magic, such as the mystical musical bond between Lyla and her son and her one-night-stand lover, and presents its protagonist with some sort of challenge to perfect the magic.Yet no fantasy challenge arises. Lyla's son, Evan, is simply magical, except when he's not, who's to tell? His instant, and I do mean instant guitar and pipe organ playing skills and musical notation skills were pure fantasy without effort. Evan, aka August Rush picks up a guitar for the first time and with no fine motor skills training channels the ghost of Michael Hedges (check him out if you liked Evan's style of guitar playing; frankly, I was offended by the artistic rip-off as the physically demanding and technically challenging techniques that Evan just pulls out thin air were invented by the late Mr. Hedges). He is befriended by a kindly reverend and a young girl, a refugee in the church, and immediately learns how to read and score music with no tutelage. There were opportunities to spend a few movie minutes here and there to make Evan's transformation from a non-musician to a guitar playing god more believable, but the director went for a lazy  prefab genius/magic boy route more often then not. Even when Evan/August winds up a musical ""student"" at his mother's alma-mater, Julliard, he is shown to be teaching the teachers almost from the get-go; no strain to perfect his magical musical ability.But there is something, nay, somebody in Evan's way, somebody preventing him from uniting with his mystically gathering family. That somebody is a money-grubbing, lost-soul ex-musician, played by Robin Williams. This promising character could have added much more to the story. How did he lose his soul, could he get it back? Did he have a mystical tie to Evan's parents other than mere happenstance? In what way was his nickname, the Wizard, warranted? We'll never know, the character is instead used as a throw away impediment to Evan's quest to find family. And is about as menacing as a junk yard dog on a leash when he's not being a sympathetic character. In short, the ""wizard's"" story is a tepid voyage to nowhere.So August Rush veers between reality and pure fantasy, with neither faction presented with any sort of conviction -- no hint of real struggle or conquest or even surprise as Evan is united with his mother and father at the end.I find it interesting that there are so many high ratings for this movie, while at the same time reviewers frequently acknowledge that this movie is full holes (Those mentioned above are by no means an exhaustive list). Is this the price of a nice feel-good movie; to be sold on the idea that intellect and emotion are entirely at odds? If there's anything we should have learned by now from Disney/Pixar, it's that you don't have to overly dumb-down stories to your children to get them to appreciate fantasy and happiness; and adults shouldn't have to dumb-down their expectations for movies that appeal to all.Great heart-warming spiritual premise merits two and a half stars, but the vision is sorely muddled by the half-baked efforts of the writers and director.",2,5 stars? 4 stars?

Watched this on DVD late last night and loved every single frame of the movie. It's so good that if I could lick the movie, I would.Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) is a musical prodigy who grows up in an orphanage believing that his parents are still alive. So he sets out on a quest to create music that will draw his parents to him. Along the way, he gets picked up by the ""Wizard"" (Robin Williams) who wants to exploit his musical talents for money. His parents are actually the famous concert cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an Irish guitarist and lead singer from a rock band. He's the result of a ""one-night-stand"" 11 years ago. Lyla's father lied to her that the baby had died when in truth, he sent him to an orphanage.The entire movie feels so unreal that it's almost like a song, a concerto. It celebrates music as the ultimate wordless communication between us. It celebrates the harmony of the universe, the music of the spheres, the sounds of the winds and the rhythms of our heartbeats.

Yes, it is a modern ""adaptation"" of OLIVER TWIST. Yes, Robin Williams' character of Wizard is creepy beyond belief (for a better dark portrayal, check out his anarchist character on a late episode of Law & Order: SVU from this past season-it ran in April/May). Yes, the characters of Lyla and Louis don't age in 10 years (how old are they supposed to be when they meet? 18, 20? Who knows?). I say all of these things to state that although we KNOW these things are highly unlikely to happen, that doesn't take away from the message of the film.I enjoyed the sweeping view of NYC and it's outlying suburbs, all of the kid's inherent musical genius, and the universal THEME of wanting to belong to someone or something (in August/Evan's case, his family).I knocked off 1 star because I thought Keri Russell could've shined a bit more and shown more range as Lyla Novacek. Also, I didn't see a need for Terrence Howard's social worker. Anyone could've played that part ably (perhaps I'm biased, but I haven't liked anything Howard's done since ""The Best Man""). Jonathan Rhys Meyers was a revelation as Louis Connelly though. What a talent (singing and acting)! The look that he gives August/Evan in the park after playing ""Dueling Guitars"" is so fraught with emotion-he knows this kid is special; he just can't put his finger on WHY.The ending could've been extended a bit, and the DVD is short on special features (nothing at ALL about how the music came together for the film-what a shame since it's such an integral part of the movie).

These reviewers, if you read them are obviously music teachers or musicians that are the epitome of the bully in the orphanage. They have issues and can't accept that it's a movie and is fantasy. It is not based off real people. These people would try to force anyone with talent better than themselves to deny that talent out of jealousy. Fine, it is very exagerated that our boy can pick up sheet music and just know how to read it and compose a song in less than 1 day but like I said. It's a movie.On to the review:I love this movie. I am not going to start flashing names of artists they were copying for Freddie Highmore's style of playing but there are originators of it out there for longer than you think.As we begin, we have Evan - Aka August Rush (Freddie Highmore) in an orphanage and he is bullied for being different. Flash to 11 yrs earlier to Keri Russell (Celebrated Julliard celloist) and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (budding Rock star) meeting and having a one night stand. Keri is controlled by her father William Sadler so the relationship doesn't take off.Back to Evan in the present - He leaves to find his parents by ""following"" the music.Terence Howard is the child services rep trying to find him.Robin Williams is the person who takes him in which is the ""Oliver Twist"" part. He gives Evan the name August Rush as a stage name but also to hide him from the authorities in order to use his talents. Not his best work but the character was not supposed to be outright violent or dangerous.

175279,AJWDOCM9BLAQ3,1419827154,Fernando,"[7, 14]","I'd have enjoyed this movie more if... well, if it had been better! I was expecting a serious movie and was dealt a Dickensian (1/2 of this story is Oliver Twist), Hollywood fairy-tale where actors are merely props for the movie's symbolism: Keri Russell is sublime and disciplined classical music and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers is hip and emotional Rock and Roll. A short-lived fling gives birth to Freddie Highmore, a super-gifted, musically inclined child who integrates both of his parents' artistic temperaments. They move through life longing for one another, both parents unaware of their boy's existence. Robin Williams plays an interesting character, the only complex one in the movie, who comes into Highmore's life during his time of need, gives him a name but whose relationship must eventually be abandoned. Williams' character also represents, to me, the stages of a career in music which in the end goes bad: Inspired and driven by love of the art initially, which then turns materialistic and self-destructive.The original aspects could have, if they had been done correctly by writer/director Kirsten Sheridan, been interesting, yet from the writing board to the final product much was lost. What is beyond reproach are her sets and shots; she has the ability to create in her movies a world one wants to live in. I absolutly love her use of colors and light. Yet, using actors as chess pieces to tell a story is just bad film-making, I'd have expected better from her.The problem is that once a writer or director decides to make symbols out of characters, the actor is trapped into playing the same note (and isn't that ironic?). That premise leads the movie to make several unbelievably stupid choices: After Rhys-Meyers abandons his super-hip band in New York (there was talk about ""going back to Ireland"") he finds an unlikely, super-cushy job in California. This type of overtly-privileged fantasy life is fine for the OC or 90210, not for a movie that wants to be deep. I can -grudgingly- let that go but when he runs into a former band mate years later we find that although the band broke up after he left, somehow they ALL end up living in California and within driving distance of each other! This is just insulting your audience. Beyond that, August Rush is just enervatingly sentimental; I haven't rolled my eyes at a movie so much since the English Patient.This movie has heart, is beautifully shot, family friendly and even something you might enjoy if you are in the right mood. It is about a universe of sounds and how harmony brings us together, about integrating all the notes in our scale and the value of art, discipline, emotion and Love. Too bad there's a droning single note throughout the movie and an excessive amount of emotional sap that makes August Rush easy to be cynical about.",2,Same Note Sammy,1219017600,"08 18, 2008",2008,2820,"[""'d"", 'have', 'enjoyed', 'movie', 'more', 'well', 'had', 'been', 'better', 'was', 'expecting', 'serious', 'movie', 'was', 'dealt', 'Dickensian', '1/2', 'story', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'Hollywood', 'fairy-tale', 'where', 'actors', 'are', 'merely', 'props', 'movie', 'symbolism', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'sublime', 'disciplined', 'classical', 'music', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'hip', 'emotional', 'Rock', 'Roll', 'short-lived', 'fling', 'birth', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'super-gifted', 'musically', 'inclined', 'child', 'who', 'parents', 'artistic', 'temperaments', 'move', 'life', 'longing', 'one', 'parents', 'unaware', 'boy', 'existence', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'interesting', 'character', 'only', 'complex', 'one', 'movie', 'who', 'Highmore', 'life', 'time', 'need', 'name', 'relationship', 'must', 'eventually', 'be', 'abandoned', 'Williams', 'character', 'also', 'stages', 'career', 'music', 'end', 'bad', 'Inspired', 'driven', 'love', 'art', 'initially', 'then', 'materialistic', 'self-destructive.The', 'original', 'aspects', 'could', 'have', 'had', 'been', 'done', 'correctly', 'writer/director', 'Kirsten', 'Sheridan', 'been', 'interesting', 'yet', 'writing', 'board', 'final', 'product', 'much', 'was', 'lost', 'What', 'reproach', 'are', 'sets', 'shots', 'ability', 'create', 'movies', 'world', 'one', 'live', 'absolutly', 'love', 'use', 'colors', 'light', 'using', 'actors', 'chess', 'pieces', 'tell', 'story', 'just', 'bad', 'film-making', ""'d"", 'have', 'expected', 'better', 'her.The', 'problem', 'once', 'writer', 'director', 'decides', 'make', 'symbols', 'characters', 'actor', 'trapped', 'playing', 'same', 'note', ""n't"", 'ironic', 'premise', 'movie', 'make', 'several', 'unbelievably', 'stupid', 'choices', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'abandons', 'super-hip', 'band', 'New', 'York', 'was', 'talk', 'going', 'back', 'Ireland', 'unlikely', 'super-cushy', 'job', 'California', 'type', 'overtly-privileged', 'fantasy', 'life', 'fine', 'OC', '90210', 'not', 'movie', 'be', 'deep', 'can', '-grudgingly-', 'let', 'go', 'when', 'former', 'band', 'mate', 'years', 'later', 'find', 'band', 'broke', 'up', 'left', 'somehow', 'end', 'up', 'living', 'California', 'driving', 'distance', 'other', 'just', 'insulting', 'audience', 'Beyond', 'August', 'Rush', 'just', 'enervatingly', 'sentimental', 'have', ""n't"", 'rolled', 'eyes', 'movie', 'so', 'much', 'English', 'Patient.This', 'movie', 'heart', 'beautifully', 'shot', 'family', 'friendly', 'even', 'something', 'might', 'enjoy', 'are', 'right', 'mood', 'universe', 'sounds', 'how', 'harmony', 'together', 'integrating', 'notes', 'scale', 'value', 'art', 'discipline', 'emotion', 'Love', 'Too', 'bad', 'droning', 'single', 'note', 'movie', 'excessive', 'amount', 'emotional', 'sap', 'August', 'Rush', 'easy', 'be', 'cynical']",N/A

""August Rush"" is lovely fairy tale about a little boy, Evan Taylor, who has grown up in a state home, who is a musical prodigy.  Unbeknownst to him, he is the son of two musically gifted parents (played by the wonderful Kerri Russell and the brilliant Jonathan Rhys-Myers.  Evan is convinced he is still loved and wanted by his parents, and rightfully, as his mom was tricked into giving him up by her duplicitous father.  We meet the young lovers who connect on a rooftop, discussing music and the connection it is in their lives, only to be spearated.  Evan is sent away, his mother thinking he died in her emergency delivery.  Evan think he can reach them through music and he hears music in the most mundane of sounds.  The opening is a bluray delight(between image and audio) with Evan ""conducting"" the wheat colored fields of his orphanage as the wind pours through it.  He runs away one night to find his parent, convinced if he can play his music where it can be heard they will find him.  He meets a street grifter (a wonderfully dispicable Robin Williams) who tries to exploit his gifts to line his pockets and even gives him the stage name of August Rush.The movie relies on a lot of coincidences and leaps in credibility, but the fairy tale tenor of the story makes this permissible as we feel we are watching a fable, but the genius of the movie is the realistic look and feel of the film and characters.  Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) is brilliant.  The film is set on his shoulders and he delivers.  He is winning, lovable, and as an actor, Highnmore has a poise well beyond his years.  The film is by turns, funny, aching, lyrical, and ultimately it has its moments of sheer joy, and it earns every one of them.The films was a must-have for me on Blu-ray between the gorgeous cinematography and fabulous meoldic score by Mark Macina.  The film is stunning in 1080p.  There is not a single flaw on the print or the high-def transfer.  Blacks are inky, colors have wonderful saturation, and there is a light veneer or grain in the image retaining the film-like look.  The Dolby TrueHD sound is a revelation, as opposed to the lossy standard track.  The scene where August plays his rhapsody the church organ is booming, exciting, with enormous detail added.  This is a fine example of how high def only enhances and serves the story rather than special effects and explosions.  The current price of this disc makes it a no brainer if you are a fan of the film.  To those new to it, this is the way to see it.  It's perfectly suitable for children (my 8 yr old LOVED it), although it is not a children's movie.

175292,A328S9RN3U5M68,1419827154,Grady Harp,"[53, 61]","AUGUST RUSH will not go down in history as a profound film: many will even go so far as to dismiss it as kitsch, maudlin, and a simpleton take off on 'Oliver Twist', and other pejoratives. For this viewer the little film is tender and frequently requires suspension of belief, but in the end the idea of the story does indeed bring a tear to the eye.Based on a story by Paul Castro and Nick Castle and transformed for the screen by Castle and James V. Hart, the premise is that of a fairytale, but an unusual fairytale built around the impact of music.  On one magic night in New York City classical cellist Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and popular Irish guitarist/singer Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) meet on a rooftop, languishing in their own disappointments with life and finding solace in each other's arms, and that night Lyla becomes pregnant, never to see Louis again, and struggling to keep her baby despite her father's demands to abort.  Lyla delivers her baby boy, but the child is immediately taken away (Lyla is told the child was stillborn).  'Evan Taylor' AKA August Rush (Freddie Highmore) is placed in an orphanage, longing for parents he believes he can 'hear' in the music of the spheres. Compelled to find his parents he escapes the orphanage after eleven years and is taken in by  Faginesque Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace (Robin Williams) who teaches his street urchins the fine art of pick pocketing and playing music on the streets as buskers.  Renamed August Rush, Evan has uncommon musical talents and rapidly becomes a big money maker for Wizard while at the same time being discovered as a potential pupil for Juilliard by Reverend James (Mykelti Williamson) and his girl singer Hope (Jamia Simone Nash) with assistance from kindly social worker Richard Jefferies (Terrence Howard).  August Rush composes a rhapsody that is to be played in Central Park, a chance to place his music before the world and attract his parents, both of whom have returned to music careers after eleven years absence and learn of the existence of August Rush, their 'unknown son'. And yes, the ending is a happily ever after one...Kirsten Sheridan directs with a sure hand and a keen eye toward make believe.  The cast is strong, especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers, and the musical score, a very mixed bag, provides a suitable background for the story.  This is one of those movies that asks us to go along with a lot of improbable events, but the pleasure of the experience is worth the journey.

175296,A2HVL790PBWYTU,1419827154,"H. Bala ""Me Too Can Read""","[6, 11]","Plot SPOILERS now.Lyla (Keri Russell, of FELICITY), a concert cellist, and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), an Irish musician, meet on a New York City roof one evening. What with the moon being full, the two fall in love. And further shenanigans of the heart go down. But, the next morning, Lyla's controlling father speedily puts the kibosh on the romance before it really has a chance to flourish. When Lyla becomes pregnant with Louis' child and delivers, her father puts the baby up for adoption and tells Lyla that her baby had died. Louis's heartbreak and Lyla's tragedy cause them both to give up playing their music, even though Lyla would become a music teacher. So that was eleven years ago.Cut now to the present, as a young orphan named Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) flees the Walden County Home for Boys. Evan is a weird kid, able to hear music from the most routine of noises in his environment. But he loves music more than food and believes that his parents aren't dead, that, in fact, if he follows the music, it'll lead him to his parents. He ends up following the music to New York City, and ends up in the clutches of Maxwell Wallace, more flashily known as the Wizard (Robin Williams).The Wizard is an aging street hustler who takes in street kids with musical talent and makes them busk for a living (the Wizard gets a good cut of their earnings, you dig). Hanging out with the Wizard and his underaged worker bees, August Rush (as the Wizard would rename Evan) learns to play music for the first time, starting with the guitar. Further events unfold, and, soon enough, a pastor in church sees August wailing away on the pipe organ and is so impressed that he gets him into Juilliard. And from there it's a short step to this newly discovered musical prodigy conducting his own symphony to the New York Philharmonics in an outside concert in Central Park.So many coincidences here that Bollywood is jealous. So, meanwhile, Lyla has discovered that her son is alive and begins a desperate search for him. She ends up in New York. Simultaneously, Louis has regained the itch to play his music and rejoins his old band. He also ends up in New York. And, by the movie's climax, everybody ends up in Central Park.SPOILERS end.Here's my two cents: Let's not get it twisted, AUGUST RUSH is meant to be a fable. And you have to buy into the film being a fable if you're gonna enjoy the viewing experience. Otherwise, it may get on your last nerve. Is this movie manipulative? Yes. Is AUGUST RUSH so ""sweet"" a film that diabetics aren't medically cleared to glimpse even its trailer? Hells, yeah. Do coincidences pile on more ridiculously than L.A. traffic on the 405 Freeway? Fo'shizzle! But I'm still giving it three stars. Mostly, I guess, it's 'cause I'm a sap, a sucker, a target audience. I just dig feel-good films and pictures which cling to the idea (or wish) that there's a higher purpose to things. That love and magic and music can carry the day. That wouldn't exactly suck, would it? Sue me, I got that optimist schtick going on.But this is the part now where I kind of kick the movie in the groin. Thing is, man, are we ever asked to accept so many inconsistencies and leaps of logic. Yes, clearly AUGUST RUSH is intended to be a fantasy film, but even the most fantastical of fantasies must have some grounding, some rules to follow. AUGUST RUSH, in several scenes, just doesn't play fair. Since this is a fable, I get that Evan is able to suddenly, masterfully play the guitar (after messing about with it some during the night). I can swallow that. And the same with the piano. But I draw the line at Evan all of a sudden capable of composing maniacally after merely glancing at a music sheet (Is there, somewhere, a deleted sequence where he at least first studies notes and stuff for a bit?).Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell punch in with some very good acting. And I truly wish they could've gotten more scenes together, as their characters are very engaging and rootable. The high points for me are actually the scene with Meyers and Russell having their cute meet and the scene with Meyers and Freddie Highmore dueting on guitars (easily the musical highlight of the film). Come to think of it, the musical sequences happen to provide some of the better parts of this film. And if Meyers is really doing his own singing, then color me truly appreciative. Freddie Highmore was pretty good inFinding Neverland (Widescreen Edition)and inCharlie and the Chocolate Factory (Widescreen Edition). Here, he's the eponymous lead, but his acting, while sensitive, borders on being too precious. Next time, maybe ease up on the ethereal. The other two actors of note are Terrence Howard and Robin Williams. Howard is woefully underused as a concerned social worker and Williams is irritatingly overused (Seriously, Robin, what the hell happened? You were a decent actor for a while.). But Howard barely makes an impact, while Robin Williams checks in with one big fat hairy false note after another. He really doesn't do a good enough job of sinking into the skin of his role. So, when all's said and done, all I see is Robin Williams playing Robin Williams, and playing him awfully. I pretty much cringed everytime dude was on the screen.A bit of fine tuning here, a bit of scene cutting there (like, all of the Robin Williams scenes), and, who knows, this could've been a much better film (Another thing that grated on me was the sappy and too abrupt ending). Still, if you can buy the outrageous premise and tolerate the incessant cloyingness and the rampant sentimentality...If you can not be annoyed at the film's blatant and clumsy attempts to orchestrate the audience's emotions (since every film does this)...And if you keep to heart the fact that AUGUST RUSH is a fable and so deserves a break from the Department of Keeping It Real, well, you might end up enjoying this. Me, even though I'm a bit horrified at the sheer over-the-topness of it all, I'm still leaning towards being generous. I see that this film wears its heart on its sleeve, and I salute that. And that it decided to go all balls out for what it wants, and that it fully commits to its music. Respect to that. I give props to the movie's hopeful message, which is that music unites. I'm just glad Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Keri Russell were there to ground things. AUGUST RUSH, ultimately, ends up being flawed magic. But still magic.And, by the way, that nine year old girl, Jamia Simone Nash, is a star waiting in the wings. She's got impressive pipes.",3,"Let's not get it twisted, AUGUST RUSH is a fable.

175305,A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ,1419827154,Jason,"[11, 22]","August Rush is a heart-warming, albeit painfully slow at times, story of an orphan boy - a pseudo-Oliver Twist - named Evan Tayler who is the definition of a socially awkward child.  While walking around the streets of New York he meets a wise talking, Boondocks-esque musical prodigy named Arthur who leads him to a group of other musical prodigies.  Evan is escaping from the life of social custody, and following the music in his ears has led him to this unlikely family of vagrant musicians, each with their own speciality (I think I saw a didgeradoo at one point).These kids are living in an abandoned playhouse, and under the tutelage of a ghetto pied piper named Wizard (Robin Williams) who musically pimps all of the gifted youngsters under his watch.  And, wouldn't you know it, young Evan is a friggin guitar genius; so, he fits in quite well.  In no time at all he usurps Arthur for the Alpha position in the drifter family, and the prefered musical prostitute bringing in cash to Wizard - the musical, philosophical pimp who will do anything to keep his new found meal ticket.(Yes, you read all of that right, and it's just as ridiculously unbelieveable as I have mentioned.  It's ""Ben Affleck saving the world in Armaggedon""-ridiculous.)Meanwhile, we find out that Lila and Louis, both socially awkward musicians in their twenties, meet randomly one night at a lame party.  Louis is a guitarist for a somewhat popular band, and he doesn't seem to like crowds.  Yeah, a guitarist who doesn't like crowds.  Lila plays classical music, and the two have a incredibly pointless, random night together - sort of a poor man's Serendipity - and then they part ways the next morning.Oops, he knocked her up.  Nevermind, it didn't happen.  Oh wait, yeah it did, but the father forged her signature up and gave the baby up for adoption.  (I only put it this way because this is the manner in which the movie gave these facts to the viewer)In the end, Lila and Louis discover that Evan is their kid, and he is now a successful composer named August Rush who has attended Juilliard and is about to have his own symphony in Central Park...at eleven years old...where his mother just happens to be playing the cello after an 11-year hiatus...and the father just happens to be driving by after playing a gig during his recent refound love of music.  The entire ordeal is done with more foreshadowing and preposterousness than Dolly Parton walking around the corner.  Amongst all the barely connected storylines, they are all reunited happily ever after...despite the eleven year separation.It's a feel-good movie great for the whole family, and by feel-good I mean completely unbelievable.

They stated that the directors had ""no musical knowledge"" and that the story made no sense.  I guess my question to the cynics would be what do you want in a movie?!?!?  Absolute authenticity in every respect?  The fact is simple...  When watching this movie it is impossible to be emotionally moved to the highest degree.  When you are not crying in happiness you are raptured by the possibility that a child like August could exist.

The term ""fairy tale"" keeps getting applied to this film, but real fairy tales are carefully crafted allegories, not excuses for insipid and unbelievable storytelling. To say that it is just overly sentimental is also far too kind because this kind of ""product"" is, of course, the result of multiple test-screenings and demographic considerations. In fact, if ever a movie wanted to pander and please every possible viewer / paying unit, it is this one. Stretched beyond thin, it is as if it was robotically assembled; ""pull heart-string A, add sweeping music, insert flashback B (in slow motion), etc."" And it STILL manages to sink even lower with yet another one-dimensional portrayal of a human, as caricatured by Robin Williams (who is as naturally ""street"" as Kathy Lee Gifford)!Most offensive, however, is that ""August Rush"" ultimately purports to be about the universality and power of art as a mysterious and yet uniquely human language. Yet in it's air-tight bubble of calculated cliches and manipulative schmaltz, it has completely suffocated the very elements that allow for true art to exist. There is no better example of this than in how the film repeatedly illustrates the boy's relationship to music. In the very opening scenes, the director has chosen an internal voice-over to verbally explain how August feels about music in his world, rather than employ the almost limitless language of cinema to creatively show it. Oh, we get lots of sweeping MTV crane and helicopter shots, but this is not what I'm getting at. In this opening voice-over, August explains how music and rhythm is present in almost every facet of nature itself. It's hardly a new idea, but a potentially challenging and beautiful one to consider. Still, the filmmakers won't allow you to actually experience or engage with this philosophy first-hand, which they could have. Instead, for every visual example they provide; the wind, the birds, the urban environment, etc., they have chosen to lay ACTUAL music over, drowning out whatever discoveries you might have shared with August for yourself.This film has nothing to do with art, or even human beings, really. It's a total betrayal of its subject matter and mistrusts its audience on every level. It offers no challenges or discoveries and, without these, there can be no fairy tales, only mounting successions of highly improbable coincidences, delivered D.O.A., in a pantomime of wonder.

Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) was the member of a rock band. There was a connection between them the second they met and on that day a musical genius was conceived.

He was in a home for boys where his gift was not appeciated because they saw him as freakishly different. He wanted to be with his birth parents, not placed in someone's home. He had no anger because they gave him up, but was consumed with thoughts of where they could possibly be and he kept believing he could follow the music that would lead him to them.I enjoyed August Rush. Maxwell 'Wizard' Wallace (Robin Williams)bothered me a bit, though. He acted like he cared about Evan but he didn't really want this boy to be happy. He deceived him and tried to fill his mind with doubt. Wizard's thinking was all messed up because he was scarred by the foster care system.

175332,A1EHTFVSD0H7I6,1419827154,Kelly Klepfer,"[7, 8]","This is a powerful film. When I saw the previews I didn't feel the need to rush to opening night, obviously, but I knew I'd see it eventually and that I'd probably like it. I expected a somewhat emotional string playing feel-good movie along the lines of a long line of those that have gone before it. The previews didn't do it justice.If you love music, if you love creativity, if you love against-all-odds feel good stories, you are going to want to see this film.The impossibility of the yeah-right plot actually works if you get pulled into the story. Imagine a scene from Hook with the Lost Boys, imagine Fievel gazing at the moon singing ""Somewhere Out There"" and Pinocchio's longing to be real, and his imprisonment, and you get a sense of Evan aka August Rush's journey to becoming found. Add Mr. Holland's Opus and you have an idea of the pulling together of events into a symphonic ""no way, but if it could happen that would be so cool"" finale. There is a some cheese and some serious emotional strumming going on, but because the film is full of longing, searching, and seeking, which is pretty much the human condition, I found August Rush to be soul-marking like all things beautiful and poignant. If you are moved by music and art, if stories of lost being found, and wrongs being righted, and the good guys getting a break, then August Rush is for you.Very little bleeping language, and sex is completely behind the scenes. Who says a film has to have sex and f-bombs to work? There is a bit of violence, a fight between brothers with thrown fists and some blood. A few scenes are scary because one particular character is emotionally unstable and throws a mean temper tantrum, so really sensitive kids may have an issue or two.The entire film is love honoring and respectful of humanity, beauty and the audience. God is treated with respect as is the church. I saw so many spiritual allegories that I quit counting so I could absorb the film. The only things that bugged my cynical self were too many blank faced closeups. And when the laws of reality make something not even close to possible, i.e. during a packed-out, standing-room-only concert, two characters walk parallel through a mass of people toward the front of a stage and can actually get through and unmolested at that.Otherwise, it's a keeper.",4,Better Than the Previews Imply...,1201910400,"02 2, 2008",2008,2324,"['powerful', 'film', 'When', 'saw', 'previews', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'need', 'rush', 'opening', 'night', 'obviously', 'knew', ""'d"", 'see', 'eventually', ""'d"", 'probably', 'expected', 'somewhat', 'emotional', 'string', 'playing', 'feel-good', 'movie', 'lines', 'long', 'line', 'have', 'gone', 'previews', 'did', ""n't"", 'do', 'justice.If', 'love', 'music', 'love', 'creativity', 'love', 'against-all-odds', 'feel', 'good', 'stories', 'are', 'going', 'want', 'see', 'film.The', 'impossibility', 'yeah-right', 'plot', 'actually', 'get', 'pulled', 'story', 'Imagine', 'scene', 'Hook', 'Lost', 'Boys', 'imagine', 'Fievel', 'gazing', 'moon', 'singing', 'Somewhere', 'Out', 'Pinocchio', 'longing', 'be', 'real', 'imprisonment', 'get', 'sense', 'Evan', 'aka', 'August', 'Rush', 'journey', 'becoming', 'found', 'Add', 'Mr.', 'Holland', 'Opus', 'have', 'idea', 'pulling', 'together', 'events', 'symphonic', 'way', 'could', 'happen', 'would', 'be', 'so', 'cool', 'finale', 'cheese', 'serious', 'emotional', 'strumming', 'going', 'film', 'full', 'longing', 'searching', 'seeking', 'pretty', 'much', 'human', 'condition', 'found', 'August', 'Rush', 'be', 'soul-marking', 'things', 'beautiful', 'poignant', 'are', 'moved', 'music', 'art', 'stories', 'lost', 'being', 'found', 'wrongs', 'being', 'righted', 'good', 'guys', 'getting', 'break', 'then', 'August', 'Rush', 'you.Very', 'little', 'bleeping', 'language', 'sex', 'completely', 'scenes', 'Who', 'film', 'have', 'sex', 'f-bombs', 'work', 'bit', 'violence', 'fight', 'brothers', 'thrown', 'fists', 'blood', 'few', 'scenes', 'are', 'scary', 'one', 'particular', 'character', 'emotionally', 'unstable', 'mean', 'temper', 'tantrum', 'so', 'really', 'sensitive', 'kids', 'may', 'have', 'issue', 'two.The', 'entire', 'film', 'honoring', 'respectful', 'humanity', 'beauty', 'audience', 'God', 'treated', 'respect', 'church', 'saw', 'so', 'many', 'spiritual', 'allegories', 'quit', 'counting', 'so', 'could', 'absorb', 'film', 'only', 'things', 'bugged', 'cynical', 'self', 'were', 'too', 'many', 'blank', 'faced', 'closeups', 'when', 'laws', 'reality', 'make', 'something', 'not', 'even', 'close', 'possible', 'i.e', 'packed-out', 'standing-room-only', 'concert', 'two', 'characters', 'walk', 'parallel', 'mass', 'people', 'front', 'stage', 'can', 'actually', 'get', 'unmolested', 'that.Otherwise', 'keeper']",N/A

Evan,whose name is changed to ""August Rush"" by a Faginesque Robin Williams,learns instantly to play the guitar like a pro and his genius is discovered and exploited when he brings his tips back to Robin Williams, who houses UNDETECTED street urchin musicians in an abandoned Manhattan Theatre.The final and biggest hole occurs at the end when Jonathan Rhys Meyers is musically drawn to the concert in the park where Evan ""August"" is conducting his inspired rhapsody that just came to him.Meyers serendipitously pushes his way to the front of the enormous crowd there to find Keri Russell after eleven years,he grabs her hand,nods to August....hello? did anyone ever tell him that HE was the father of this child?For all of the smart editing and clever ideas that this film had, the story itself is pure ridiculous.The only thing that impressed me was that Jonathan Rhys -Meyers performed his own vocals.Highmore and Russell very obviously are not really performing and the quick edits hope to dazzle the viewer and keep them off balance from that fact.Some of the cuts of Russell playing both the Bach E Major Concerto and The Edward Elgar Concerto are deplorable with incorrect hand positions and simply on the wrong strings.Some people won't notice or even care about such things, but when you study music this film is like a history major seeing Ben-Hur with a wrist watch on! The editors were savvy to cut in and out in the music sequences in order to get that dizzying effect of the swirling of music, but all the guitar and cello coaching did not remotely pay off for me.Meyers was believable because he did his own work.This threw the believability factor of this film off for me.Meyers was spot-on, while Highmore and Russell were not.Why not find three REAL musicians?Was this film destined to end on the right note? Yeah...there was never a doubt about it.It struck all the wrong chords with me.Cheesy and hokey are words that come to mind,but,hey,it's only a film .You won't get upset with my humble opinion as long as you are flowing with the rhythm of the universe.I am obviously out of sync and freely admit it!Here come the hateful votes...I can feel you wanting to push that button!",2,My out of sync review of the universal sounds of AUGUST RUSH,1199923200,"01 10, 2008",2008,3636,"['certain', 'beat', 'universe', 'certain', 'music', 'one', 'atuned', 'will', 'bring', 'everything', 'just', 'right.Evan', 'Taylor', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'fiber', 'being', 'orphan', 'voice', 'parents', 'musicians', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'call', 'out', 'night.He', 'never', 'known', 'have', 'never', 'known', 'fact', 'Russell', 'dead', 'Meyers', 'never', 'was', 'informed', 'pregnancy', 'as', 'far', 'could', 'tell', 'talking', 'wind', 'watching', 'moon', 'moving', 'wheat', 'fields', 'etc.I', 'could', ""n't"", 'buy', 'earnest', 'film', 'one', 'minute.I', 'found', 'story', 'be', 'so', 'full', 'holes', 'swiss', 'cheese', 'had', 'better', 'consistency', 'film.I', 'understand', 'premise', 'film', 'certainly', 'not', 'merit', 'will', 'only', 'suspend', 'belief', 'only', 'so', 'far.AUGUST', 'RUSH', 'seemed', 'be', '2007', 'version', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'Annie', 'neat', 'sharply', 'edited', 'soundtrack', 'make', 'up', 'totally', 'implausible', 'premise.As', 'musician', 'who', 'went', 'conservatory', 'couldnot', 'buy', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'performing', 'Elgar', 'Cello', 'Concerto', 'much', 'less', 'getting', 'invite', 'prestigious', 'Central', 'Park', 'Concert', 'eleven', 'year', 'hiatus', 'cello.Only', 'being', 'sync', 'universal', 'rhythm', 'could', 'have', 'pulled', 'one', 'off.Jacqueline', 'DuPre', 'as', 'talented', 'was', 'could', 'not', 'have', 'done', 'lifetime', 'Evan', 'name', 'changed', 'August', 'Rush', 'Faginesque', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'instantly', 'play', 'guitar', 'pro', 'genius', 'discovered', 'exploited', 'when', 'tips', 'back', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'who', 'houses', 'UNDETECTED', 'street', 'urchin', 'musicians', 'abandoned', 'Manhattan', 'Theatre.The', 'final', 'biggest', 'hole', 'end', 'when', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'musically', 'drawn', 'concert', 'park', 'where', 'Evan', 'August', 'conducting', 'inspired', 'rhapsody', 'just', 'came', 'him.Meyers', 'serendipitously', 'way', 'front', 'enormous', 'crowd', 'there', 'find', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'eleven', 'years', 'grabs', 'hand', 'nods', 'August', '.hello', 'did', 'anyone', 'ever', 'tell', 'HE', 'was', 'father', 'child', 'smart', 'editing', 'clever', 'ideas', 'film', 'had', 'story', 'pure', 'ridiculous.The', 'only', 'thing', 'impressed', 'was', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', '-Meyers', 'performed', 'own', 'vocals.Highmore', 'Russell', 'very', 'obviously', 'are', 'not', 'really', 'performing', 'quick', 'edits', 'hope', 'dazzle', 'viewer', 'keep', 'off', 'balance', 'fact.Some', 'cuts', 'Russell', 'playing', 'Bach', 'E', 'Major', 'Concerto', 'Edward', 'Elgar', 'Concerto', 'are', 'deplorable', 'incorrect', 'hand', 'positions', 'simply', 'wrong', 'strings.Some', 'people', 'wo', ""n't"", 'notice', 'even', 'care', 'such', 'things', 'when', 'study', 'music', 'film', 'history', 'major', 'seeing', 'Ben-Hur', 'wrist', 'watch', 'editors', 'were', 'savvy', 'cut', 'music', 'sequences', 'order', 'get', 'dizzying', 'effect', 'swirling', 'music', 'guitar', 'cello', 'coaching', 'did', 'not', 'remotely', 'pay', 'off', 'me.Meyers', 'was', 'believable', 'did', 'own', 'work.This', 'threw', 'believability', 'factor', 'film', 'me.Meyers', 'was', 'spot-on', 'Highmore', 'Russell', 'were', 'not.Why', 'not', 'find', 'three', 'REAL', 'musicians', 'Was', 'film', 'destined', 'end', 'right', 'note', 'Yeah', 'was', 'never', 'doubt', 'it.It', 'struck', 'wrong', 'chords', 'me.Cheesy', 'hokey', 'are', 'words', 'come', 'mind', 'hey', 'only', 'film', '.You', 'wo', ""n't"", 'get', 'upset', 'humble', 'opinion', 'as', 'long', 'are', 'flowing', 'rhythm', 'universe.I', 'am', 'obviously', 'sync', 'freely', 'admit', 'Here', 'come', 'hateful', 'votes', 'can', 'feel', 'wanting', 'push', 'button']",N/A

Funny thing too, for I used to like seeing Freddie in his other films: maybe he just isn't up to this particular part, for all he does here is widen his eyes with inexpressible delight every time he hears *music,* and then, as if that wasn't enough, those eyes widen further every time he hears mere *sound.*  Nick Castle, the screenwriter, is always bad with kids: he is the madman responsible for HOOK and also he directed the horrid movie version of DENNIS THE MENACE and should have been exiled to Neptune for those crimes.  And sorry, little Freddie just doesn't look like he could possibly be the son of Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.Speaking of which, for me the picture lost dramatic plausibility the minute rich girl Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) lays eyes on emo musician Louis Connelly (Rhys Meyers) in the shadow of Washington Square Arch.  He invites her to climb up and sit by him.  Sorry, if he were the last man on earth you wouldn't catch me sitting on a high parapet next to Jonathan Rhys Meyers, I'd be too afraid he'd just tip me over the side of the building.  ANY stranger, but especially Jonathan Rhys Meyers.  There's something sinister and creepy about him, though maybe Lyla's drawn to him because of a similar streak in her own father (Bill Sadler, the sheriff from ROSWELL), who has a strange fixation on her that leads to terrible consequences.I kept thinking there must have been scenes deleted from the movie, scenes covering the character arc of little Arthur (Leon Thomas III), whom we first see as the prize prodigy of crazy Wizard (Robin Williams), busking in Washington Square Park like a tiny rock star.  As the film progresses, it's rather like ALL ABOUT EVE, with Evan Taylor/August Rush gradually supplanting poor Arthur in Wizard's affections, and becoming super famous and desired, while Arthur just stands there looking glum.  Does he resent the white boy's success?  Is it a parable for American race relations--August even gets to keep the very guitar Arthur once played?  I think so, but it's almost as if they wanted to keep this aspect of the film muted--and in general, black children AND adults are nothing but helpful and kind to the lad of mysterious origins, August Rush, even saving his life on more than one occasion.  This must be why poor Terrence Howard (whom I hope they paid a huge sum to) gets to appear in the film as the helpful, kind social worker.  When you see him, your heart swells with sympathy, feeling sorry for the man who was once going to be the next big thing in the movies, and now he's playing a distant second or third fiddle to Freddie Highmore, sob.",3,Mozart Under My Bed,1227139200,"11 20, 2008",2008,2885,"['wish', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'was', 'better', 'actor', 'otherwise', 'could', 'have', 'really', 'fallen', 'picture', 'big', 'way', 'perforce', 'screenplay', 'had', 'keep', 'returning', 'more', 'interesting', 'byways', 'focus', 'August', 'plight', 'heart', 'sank', 'time', 'Funny', 'thing', 'too', 'used', 'like', 'seeing', 'Freddie', 'other', 'films', 'maybe', 'just', ""n't"", 'up', 'particular', 'part', 'here', 'widen', 'eyes', 'inexpressible', 'delight', 'time', '*music', '*', 'then', 'was', ""n't"", 'enough', 'eyes', 'widen', 'further', 'time', 'mere', '*sound', '*', 'Nick', 'Castle', 'screenwriter', 'always', 'bad', 'kids', 'madman', 'responsible', 'HOOK', 'also', 'directed', 'horrid', 'movie', 'version', 'DENNIS', 'THE', 'MENACE', 'should', 'have', 'been', 'exiled', 'Neptune', 'crimes', 'sorry', 'little', 'Freddie', 'just', ""n't"", 'look', 'could', 'possibly', 'be', 'son', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers.Speaking', 'picture', 'lost', 'dramatic', 'plausibility', 'minute', 'rich', 'girl', 'Lyla', 'Novacek', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'eyes', 'emo', 'musician', 'Louis', 'Connelly', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'shadow', 'Washington', 'Square', 'Arch', 'climb', 'up', 'sit', 'Sorry', 'were', 'last', 'man', 'earth', 'would', ""n't"", 'catch', 'sitting', 'high', 'parapet', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', ""'d"", 'be', 'too', 'afraid', ""'d"", 'just', 'tip', 'side', 'building', 'ANY', 'stranger', 'especially', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'something', 'sinister', 'creepy', 'maybe', 'Lyla', 'drawn', 'similar', 'streak', 'own', 'father', 'Bill', 'Sadler', 'sheriff', 'ROSWELL', 'who', 'strange', 'fixation', 'terrible', 'consequences.I', 'kept', 'thinking', 'there', 'must', 'have', 'been', 'scenes', 'deleted', 'movie', 'scenes', 'covering', 'character', 'arc', 'little', 'Arthur', 'Leon', 'Thomas', 'III', 'whom', 'first', 'see', 'prize', 'prodigy', 'crazy', 'Wizard', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'busking', 'Washington', 'Square', 'Park', 'tiny', 'rock', 'star', 'film', 'rather', 'ALL', 'ABOUT', 'EVE', 'Evan', 'Taylor/August', 'Rush', 'gradually', 'supplanting', 'poor', 'Arthur', 'Wizard', 'affections', 'becoming', 'super', 'famous', 'desired', 'Arthur', 'just', 'looking', 'glum', 'resent', 'white', 'boy', 'success', 'parable', 'American', 'race', 'relations', 'August', 'even', 'keep', 'very', 'guitar', 'Arthur', 'once', 'played', 'think', 'so', 'almost', 'wanted', 'keep', 'aspect', 'film', 'muted', 'general', 'black', 'children', 'adults', 'are', 'nothing', 'helpful', 'kind', 'lad', 'mysterious', 'origins', 'August', 'Rush', 'even', 'saving', 'life', 'more', 'one', 'occasion', 'must', 'be', 'why', 'poor', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'whom', 'hope', 'paid', 'huge', 'sum', 'appear', 'film', 'helpful', 'kind', 'social', 'worker', 'When', 'see', 'heart', 'sympathy', 'feeling', 'sorry', 'man', 'who', 'was', 'once', 'going', 'be', 'next', 'big', 'thing', 'movies', 'now', 'playing', 'distant', 'second', 'third', 'fiddle', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'sob']",N/A

What a rush as it flows through your mind!  Freddie Hightower who had a memorable part inThe Golden Compass (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)and was named ""Best Young Actor"" twice by the Broadcast Critics Association for his roles inFinding Neverland (Widescreen Edition)& ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"" nails his part as Evan Taylor/August Rush.  His pure dedication toward following the music and how that always leads him to a better place is amazing.  Yes, there are a lot of incidents that could be viewed as ""unrealistic"" such as Freddie suddenly being able to write in musical notation after a 1-minute lesson from a little girl.  For me, I let these go as telescoping a time sequence.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers plays Louis who has a charged one-night-stand with Keri Russell's character Lyla which results in the orphan scenario.  Rhys-Meyers won the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a mini-series for ""Elvis.""  Keri Russell was stunning in the independent filmWaitress (Widescreen Edition).  Since both Lyla & Louis are musicians, it follows that August's superb musical talent flowed from and connects him to his parents.  Terrence Howard has a subtle role as the social worker Richard Jeffries who seems behind the curve in helping the boy.  We get a sense of an overloaded social services system where people fall through the cracks.  Howard is an incredible actor from his appearance inAngel Eyesto what National Board of Review called a ""Breakthrough Performance"" inCrash (Widescreen Edition)to his Oscar-nominated performance in ""Hustle & Flow.""  He makes the small role shine.  William Sadler from the ""Roswell"" TV show plays Lyla's dad Thomas Novacek.  He is really the heavy in the film with forging Lyla's name on an important document.  Robin Williams who earned his Oscar for ""Good Will Hunting"" has a difficult task as Wizard.  On one hand, we see his inspiration in music.  On the other, he's very greedy.  We want him to be nicer.  Marian Seldes has a nice cameo as the Dean of Julliard.  I found the film enthralling.  By the end as the parents are drawn through the crowd toward their son by the music, tears were rolling down my cheeks.  ""August Rush"" is a sentimental and romantic film that has grains of truth that are also inspirational.  This is a film I want to own.

It's directed to your inner child. Plausibility doesn't come into play but rather we are encouraged to surrender to pure fantasy. We are also provided with an ""escape from realism"" that brings us down. It raises our spirits, giving us an emotional boost that most of us can benefit from.All three of these actors were perfectly suited for their parts Freddie Highmore (""August"") Jonathan Rhys Meyers (""Louis"") and Keri Russell (""Lyla"").

August Rush has an amazing cast including Freddie Highmore from ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", whom has proven to be one of the most intriguing young actors of this generation.  He has yet to degrade himself as other young actors like Dakota Fanning have, he sees no need to prove his artistic credibility, because he is just great as he is.  It is his performance as the orphaned child August Rush that elevates this film to a whole new level that it would not be at with an actor of lesser capabilities.The story story takes cues from Oliver Twist, but don't expect a straight-ahead modern adaptation, but the elements of Oliver Twist are to pick out if you have read the book or are familiar with the story, but it is not a direct adaptation.  In August Rush, a young cellist named Lyla, whose father keeps her on a short leash, falls in love with an Irish musician Louis, and has a one-night stand.  Through events that neither of the characters wanted they are separated, but Lyla has become pregnant from the encounter, and loses the child.The bulk of the story revolves around Evan Taylor AKA August Rush, who is on a quest to find his parents by following the music.  The movie is rich with excellent music, it is a rare film that can utilize music in such a poignant way.  Music is a universal language, and this music shows us how music speaks to us and is used to communicate.  As a musician, I found this movie absolutely enthralling, but even my tone-deaf buddies loved the music and the story and heart behind the movie.Don't be turned off of this movie because of its lack of promotion or critical hype, it is one of the best movies to come out in the last year and is a welcome departure from the confusing art house movies and bloody horror movies that litter the market today.God Bless ~Amy",5,One of the Best of 2007,1206576000,"03 27, 2008",2008,1988,"['rare', 'movie', 'can', 'be', 'predictable', 'sentimental', 'still', 'be', 'heartwarming', 'touching', 'exactly', 'what', 'August', 'Rush', 'August', 'Rush', 'amazing', 'cast', 'including', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'Spiderwick', 'Chronicles', 'Charlie', 'Chocolate', 'Factory', 'whom', 'proven', 'be', 'one', 'most', 'intriguing', 'young', 'actors', 'generation', 'yet', 'degrade', 'other', 'young', 'actors', 'Dakota', 'Fanning', 'have', 'need', 'prove', 'artistic', 'credibility', 'just', 'great', 'performance', 'orphaned', 'child', 'August', 'Rush', 'film', 'whole', 'new', 'level', 'would', 'not', 'be', 'actor', 'lesser', 'capabilities.The', 'story', 'story', 'cues', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'do', ""n't"", 'expect', 'straight-ahead', 'modern', 'adaptation', 'elements', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'are', 'pick', 'out', 'have', 'read', 'book', 'are', 'familiar', 'story', 'not', 'direct', 'adaptation', 'August', 'Rush', 'young', 'cellist', 'named', 'Lyla', 'father', 'short', 'leash', 'love', 'Irish', 'musician', 'Louis', 'one-night', 'stand', 'events', 'characters', 'wanted', 'are', 'separated', 'Lyla', 'become', 'pregnant', 'encounter', 'child.The', 'bulk', 'story', 'around', 'Evan', 'Taylor', 'AKA', 'August', 'Rush', 'who', 'quest', 'find', 'parents', 'following', 'music', 'movie', 'rich', 'excellent', 'music', 'rare', 'film', 'can', 'utilize', 'music', 'such', 'poignant', 'way', 'Music', 'universal', 'language', 'music', 'how', 'music', 'used', 'communicate', 'musician', 'found', 'movie', 'absolutely', 'enthralling', 'even', 'tone-deaf', 'buddies', 'loved', 'music', 'story', 'heart', 'movie.Do', ""n't"", 'be', 'turned', 'off', 'movie', 'lack', 'promotion', 'critical', 'hype', 'one', 'best', 'movies', 'come', 'out', 'last', 'year', 'welcome', 'departure', 'confusing', 'art', 'house', 'movies', 'bloody', 'horror', 'movies', 'litter', 'market', 'today.God', 'Bless', '~Amy']",N/A

Despite being a fairly new release, it has achieved some sort of cult status on the home video circuit, and I predict that in a few years it will be up there with 'Field of Dreams' as a constant seller on DVD.That said, I am not one for sappy mediocrity and obvious sentimentality, and this movie has loads of it. From the opening five minutes to the absolutely useless climax (yes, I know it worked for many viewers, but I thought it ruined the film), every scene is worked in such a way that you can't help but see the end coming from a mile away.Jonathan Rhys Meyers is a fine looking human being, but he looked awkwardly out of place and insensitive in his role here, played out with obviously no passion. Far better is Keri Russell who plays the female lead - this is one actress who has so far been underutilized in general, and here she is no different. Freddie Highmore takes all the credit in his breakthrough performance here - its a finely nuanced performance by a young actor we should see more of.On the surface, ""August Rush"" is the sad tale of a child who believes his birth parents are out there somewhere. Both his birth parents are musicians, and the child inherits their musical genius. The final scene is a spectacle, where the young boy 'brings together' his parents under a brilliant night sky, all while conducting a symphony. Its glorious, beautiful, etc, but somehow it still did not move me. I guess the really bad performances by Meyers and Russell during the last five minutes really capsized the film, which is a pity. The last scene, which SHOULD be really powerful, just comes and goes.In the right hands, ""August Rush"" could have been an epic classic that could stand the test of time, and become a movie masterpiece. The way it is right now, its a sentimental middle-of-the-road film that could have been so, so much more.Three Stars.

I'm a 54 year-old musician who believes music can found everywhere (one of this movie's themes).  I really related to the early part of the movie ""August"" is hearing melody and rhythm in various natural sounds (like the wind blowing through a field of grain)  When I was a teenager, long before the advent of sampling, I used to hear music in steam vents at an asphalt factory I worked at on the Pugent Sound.  I wanted to find a way to capture and execute that sound on strips of recording tape triggered by a keyboard (similar to a Mellotron in mechanics). I really do get the idea.  But then the movie disintegrates into a series of sappy situations and ""awakening"" events that are just too far fetched; this was perhaps the lamest, sappiest and most unbelievable drivel I have ever watched in my life.  Come on, did a junior high school drama enthusiast write this screenplay?A good movie, especially fiction, has to find a way to suspend belief.  August Rush fails miserably. Sure, a savant could start playing an instrument almost immediately.  But a savant (even Mozart) couldn't sit down and start writing musical notation without even 5 minutes of study to understand the lexicon used.  That's just preposterous.  And even if the kid could do that impossible feat, how would he know the ranges and tunings of the various instruments when writing those parts.It's too bad because with just a modicum of care and research this movie actually could have been made a little more believable.  The idea about music being every where really intrigued me and that's why I watched it.  August Rush was simply awful and an ordeal - a whirlpool of Karo corn syrup.  Yuck.

Robin williams is also very effective.  The music in this movie is eclectic.  If you don't like one tune you're bound to like one of the others.  This film took me by surprise.

Well, August Rush left me feeling that way! I vaguely remember when this movie was released, and not hearing a thing out it. But when it was released on DVD, I said ""what the heck, give it a try"". It was surprisingly, one of the best, well written and well thought out movies that I have read in a long time. I simply loved the story, the acting, the music...everything.Evan (AKA August Rush) was always sure about two things in life, (1) he heard music in everything, and (2) his parents were looking for him! Starting with vivid imagery and personal narrative, Evan describes how he feels about his life and music, while always feeling different from everyone else. As he begins his personal journey, we see how truly special he is. We soon learn the story behind his birth (one night of passion between two musicians, Louis and Lyla), and how he was eventually put up for adoption, by Lyla's very over protective father, who thinks it is in her best interest. Escaping his group home and ""following the music"", Evan has a series of misadventures as others discover his genius. During his journey, Evan never gives up faith that he will find his parents. And while some try to use Evan (the Wizard, played by Robin Williams), some try to help him (Terrance Howard), some try to find him (Lyla), some befriend him (two lovable and equally talented kids) and some discover him (his unbeknowest father, Louis).Since so many others have reviewed this movie, I won't say too much more except to watch this movie.

When he runs away to New York to find them, he takes up with a group of kid street musicians led by the sometimes nurturing, sometimes dangerous, and always exploitative Wizard (Robin Williams). Under Wizard's guidance, the boy takes on the name August Rush, and while in New York he hones his skills at a genius's pace in the hopes that his long lost parents will follow the music to find him. Meanwhile, only just discovering that her son did not die at birth, August's mother (Keri Russell) is already on the search with the help of a caring social worker (Terence Howard), while August's father (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) is seeking to find her, the lost love he has never forgotten.When I first saw trailers for ""August Rush"", I had no idea that it was based on ""Oliver Twist"", something that quickly became obvious when watching it. However, I also underestimated how touching it would be, and that's even though I expected it to be very good from the get-go. Regardless of the fact that its story is predictable (if you know Oliver Twist at all) and slightly sappy (not as sappy as I was afraid it might be, though), this is one heck of a movie! It'll bring you to tears a lot. In fact, it'll send you up and down throughout as you root for August and his family to finally come together. But what makes this one so different than just being a modern-day Oliver Twist is the fact that August Rush is a musical prodigy, and this is well woven into the story and a huge part of it. It's significant enough to make the film as much about the love and magic of music as it is about modernizing a classic. So, don't be put off by the fact that the tale is an old one. The brilliant cast, music, and engaging story will soon have you forgetting that you're on a journey you've been through before.The DVD is double-sided for widescreen and fullscreen and comes with a selection of deleted scenes as the only bonus features.

Alex would have been cast as the lead of this film, but was told that a ""bigger name"" was needed. Alex was still fairly new to the industry in the US after being a leading man in Australia. I admire his bravery, coming to the US and basically starting over from scratch. He is a brilliant talent, and should have had the lead in this movie. Since JRM was chosen due to his ""bigger name"", the part of Marshall Connelly was made larger for Alex since he made such an impression. In my opinion, as always, Alex outshines everyone else in this film. I saw it at the theater and then bought the DVD - just for Alex. Alex is Australian and can do any accent - his Irish accent as Marshall is impeccable. I actually have a friend who is Irish, and she said that it was funny that Alex's accent was better than JRM's, since JRM is Irish.  Alex also plays his own guitar and sings in the scenes where they show the brothers' band days, and his talent shines through there as well.I have known people who didn't know who Alex was when they saw August Rush (Moonlight had just premiered. Then when they did see him in Moonlight and in some of his other movies later, they said, ""oh, that's the guy I liked so much in August Rush!""

To be honest, I'm generally more a fan of action, horror, teen comedy, etc.  So ""August Rush"" does not fit into my ideal of a good movie (and, for examples, I consider movies like The Dark Knight, Blade, Underworld, Oh Brother Where Art Thou, Friday the 13th, and American Pie great movies).  However, this movie was good as far as being a feel-good movie.  I have been stressed out, sick, and just generally sad over the past couple months, so this movie helped to lift my spirits quite a bit.Admittedly, it is unrealistic and the plot depends wholly and completely on tons of deux et machinas.  Everything that happens just happens.  The father of the boy is never actually told that he is Evan's (August) father.  And until that concert in the park, the boy doesn't know that either of them are his parents, and yet he does know (what?).  The timeline of 11 years also does not help to make it realistic.What this movie is trying to get across is that the boy is drawn by the music.  As a musician myself, I can relate to this sentiment.  It is true that music is out there, everywhere, and it controls those of us who listen.  The following line from Led Zeppelin's ""Houses of the Holy"" says it best:""Let the music be your master.  Will you heed the master's call?""That is the idea this movie tried to get across, and it's effort was good, if rushed and unbelievable.Finally, I think this would have been much better as a novel.  At least, as a novel, there'd be much more room to explain much of what seemed like well-planned coincidences and serious and obvious deux et machinas.So why do I give this movie 4 stars?

The movie tells the story of Evan (Freddie Highmore), a young orphan in a boy's home somewhere in New York state. Evan insists that he can hear music everywhere, that he knows his parents want him and will find him, that he doesn't want to be placed with a new family because he's already GOT a family.Rewind 11 years to meet Lyla (Kerri Russell), a famed cellist, with a controlling father and an engagement to play with the New York Philharmonic. After her big performance, she meets Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), the lead singer in a band, at a party. The two instantly click and share a passionate night together. However, the next day, Lyla's father forbids her from seeing Louis again and ships her off . . . somewhere.Lyla later discovers she's pregnant due to her encounter with Louis, but cannot find him. A car accident late in her pregnancy lands her in the hospital. While Lyla is still unconscious, her father gives her baby up for adoption. When she comes to, he tells her the baby died as a result of the accident. The baby, of course, is Evan.Back to the present - Determined to find his parents, Evan runs away from the orphanage. ""Following the music"" lands him in New York City, where he meets all sorts of unsavory characters, discovers his own musical talents, and searches for the missing pieces of his family.While I think the initial concept of this movie was a decent one, it suffered in the execution. Too many plotpoints were thin or didn't make sense. Too many things seemed sooooo improbable that it kept me from fully engaging in the world of the movie. And it was so sugary sweet that I almost got a toothache.All performances were pretty solid (though one does wonder why Louis' Irish brogue hasn't softened at least a little after living in the U.S. for 10+ years).

Yeah, right. I'd like to see this couple in five years when her habit of alphabetizing the canned goods is driving him nuts, and his leaving the toilet seat up is making her crazy.Leave your common sense at the door if your going to watch this, because you'll be asked to believe that a healthy white male baby wouldn't immediately be fought over by multiple families who want to adopt him, but would instead be placed in some mythical home for orphan boys, which hasn't existed since Oliver Twist, that a hospital system would allow a child to be given up by the mother with just a signature, and not a lengthy conversation about why she doesn't want to keep her baby, and that a grown crazy man is housing multiple street urchins who stay with him voluntarily.

175396,A6EPTBZ75YMKW,1419827154,Olivia Joy,"[1, 1]","""August Rush"" is a ""magic movie"".  It's a movie about the power of love and music, which ultimately seem much more powerful in this film than they are in real life.The story is about Evan Taylor, a boy who lives in a home for children without parents.  Evan knows that his parents are out in the world, though, and he desires to find them, through the power of music, which he says they ""gave to him"".  And indeed, this music is very powerful as he sets out on a journey to find his parents--just two people--in New York City.If I told anymore, I would give a lot of the story away.  So I'll just say, this movie is a feel-good film.  Practical thinkers probably won't enjoy it as much, since there isn't much practicality in it.  It's a Hollywood movie to the core--true, deep love is portrayed as a one night stand, and events take place that would never happen in the real world.  But that's what movies--and music--is for, right?  To transport viewers and listeners to a different world.  And if so, ""August Rush"" does a pretty good job of it.(I also like to add in a bit about content in the films I review.  As a 16-year-old Christian girl, I always appreciate reviews that shed some light on the objectionable content in a film.  So below is a summary of things parents might want to take into consideration.)Love between two people in this film is portrayed as one night together on a rooftop of New York under the stars.  You never actually see anything, but you know they did more than kiss because the girl is pregnant later on.  All you see are the two of them lying on a couch on the roof in each other's arms.A few d-words are spoken, mostly by a little boy.  God's name is used in vain a few times.  If you watch the deleted scenes, there is one that shows a character yelling out God's name and the d-word at a little kid.The character played by Robin Williams is a little threatening at times.  While he ""cares"" for the street kids, his character doesn't really come across as caring.  Instead, he seems like a greedy, abusive sort of man.  You wonder if it was supposed to be implied that he was on drugs.  Either that, or the dude was just kinda doodly in the head.",4,A new kind of fairytale,1228176000,"12 2, 2008",2008,2184,"['August', 'Rush', 'magic', 'movie', 'movie', 'power', 'love', 'music', 'ultimately', 'seem', 'much', 'more', 'powerful', 'film', 'are', 'real', 'life.The', 'story', 'Evan', 'Taylor', 'boy', 'who', 'home', 'children', 'parents', 'Evan', 'parents', 'are', 'out', 'world', 'find', 'power', 'music', 'gave', 'indeed', 'music', 'very', 'powerful', 'out', 'journey', 'find', 'parents', 'just', 'two', 'people', 'New', 'York', 'City.If', 'told', 'anymore', 'would', 'give', 'lot', 'story', 'away', 'So', ""'ll"", 'just', 'say', 'movie', 'feel-good', 'film', 'Practical', 'thinkers', 'probably', 'wo', ""n't"", 'enjoy', 'as', 'much', ""n't"", 'much', 'practicality', 'Hollywood', 'movie', 'core', 'true', 'deep', 'love', 'portrayed', 'one', 'night', 'stand', 'events', 'take', 'place', 'would', 'never', 'happen', 'real', 'world', 'what', 'movies', 'music', 'right', 'transport', 'viewers', 'listeners', 'different', 'world', 'so', 'August', 'Rush', 'pretty', 'good', 'job', 'also', 'like', 'add', 'bit', 'content', 'films', 'review', '16-year-old', 'Christian', 'girl', 'always', 'appreciate', 'reviews', 'shed', 'light', 'objectionable', 'content', 'film', 'So', 'summary', 'things', 'parents', 'might', 'want', 'take', 'consideration', 'Love', 'two', 'people', 'film', 'portrayed', 'one', 'night', 'together', 'rooftop', 'New', 'York', 'stars', 'never', 'actually', 'see', 'anything', 'know', 'did', 'more', 'kiss', 'girl', 'pregnant', 'later', 'see', 'are', 'two', 'lying', 'couch', 'roof', 'other', 'arms.A', 'few', 'd-words', 'are', 'spoken', 'mostly', 'little', 'boy', 'God', 'name', 'used', 'vain', 'few', 'times', 'watch', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'one', 'character', 'yelling', 'out', 'God', 'name', 'd-word', 'little', 'kid.The', 'character', 'played', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'little', 'threatening', 'times', 'cares', 'street', 'kids', 'character', ""n't"", 'really', 'come', 'caring', 'Instead', 'greedy', 'abusive', 'sort', 'man', 'wonder', 'was', 'supposed', 'be', 'implied', 'was', 'drugs', 'dude', 'was', 'just', 'kinda', 'doodly', 'head']",N/A

I would give this movie 5 stars for the entire movie, save the conclusion which was unbelievable but still moving.  I rented it on demand and will buy to add to my collection of other ""feel good"" movies.  This is one to keep and great for the entire family.  I think children would really enjoy it as well.  I felt it conveyed the way we musicians feel and ""hear"" music - or unfortunately for many people - who don't.

It's not a musical, but it's a movie about music, where music forms the emotional backbone of the story. It's not a fantasy, but the story it tells has elements that can only be described as fantastic. It's not a 'family film' is the traditional sense, though it is a movie the the whole family can watch, enjoy, and appreciate on many levels.'August Rush' tells the story of a young boy, conceived on a magical night between a pair of star-crossed lovers who seem to be fated never to meet again, and given up as an orphan at birth. Despite his hard life, the boy has a faith that is challenged at every turn. It is not a faith in a God or gods, not even a faith that his parents will find hom someday. What this boy believes in more than anything is a force that shapes his life and the story he tells us: he believes in music.The boy's faith leads him to a story which is nothing less than magical. It leads him to New York, to discover his own talent for music, to new friends, to people who would use what he brings for their own ends, to those who actually care for him.  His belief and his ability and his determination lead him to hear the music all around him, and to express it in his own way.'August Rush' tells a story that isn't heard very often today, a story of hope and belief and music and the simple ways that magic can be a part of our lives.

Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) doesn't get a decent night's sleep in the orphanage because of it.  His fellow inmates call him freak because he believes both his parents are living and they'll come for him--if only he call out with the music that connects them.As he says, ""I believe in music the way some people believe in fairy tales."" So, Evan decides after eleven years and some days to escape the orphanage and go find the music--and his parents.Even ends up in New York City with zero street smarts.  He really doesn't even know how to cross the road. A fortunate encounter puts him near Arthur (Leon G. Thomas III), a street busker his age who's willing to help--for a price. Arthur introduces him to Wizard (Robin Williams) who gives musically talented street kids a place to stay in exchange for half their take. The Wizard quickly discovers that Evan, who he renames August Rush, is a prodigy and is making some plans for the lad.Meanwhile, we learn that Even's mom Lyla Novacek (Kerri Russell) had only been with Louis Connelly (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) one night. The Julliard educated cellist was in an accident while pregnant and her father decided to sign her name and give up her son--telling Lyla that he'd died.  Instead of the stage career her father envisioned, Lyla mostly gave up music and taught--til Julliard called her for a special concert in Central Park.Louis has always longed for Lyla, the girl who got away.  He gave up his music and became a manager.  When he brings a girl to meet his family, they play a song he'd written for the band after Lyla's departure from his life.  He's determined to find Lyla.  When he believes she is married, he ends up in New York with no particular goals in mind except to find his music again.""August Rush"" is just as much about the musical ties that bind us as the three people whose stories it tells.  In my opinion, the best performances were the kids: Evan-August, Arthur and Hope (Jamia Simone Nash). This trio kept you captivated and cheering.Of course, the soundtrack is fabulous.  You have Kaki King on the guitar as well as vocals from John Legend and John Ondrasik (Five for Fighting fame).

It's a story that is very well done, very tenderly told and incredibly inspiring and uplifting.The music is wonderful and the acting is all first-rate. As another reviewer said, I'm not one for movie soundtracks, but this is one I plan to order straight away. The 11-year-old musical prodigy (played by Freddie Highmore) is a delightful actor for the part and while I'm one of those people who doesn't really care for flicks with cutesy kids, this movie melted my heart into a puddle of tears.It also provides a keyhole peak at how truly gifted musicians ""hear"" and experience the world. Speaking as someone who has struggled and struggled to write a few simple books, it was a pleasure to have an insight on how a true genius views the typically laborious process of creation.The prevailing theme that I took from this movie is this: If we could strip away the many layers of fear, doubt, regret, guilt and all those other dark, burdensome emotions then it'd be easier for us all to find our own ""Insular tahiti.""I highly recommend ""August Rush"" for anyone who has a heart and I recommend it even more for people who want to see a movie that leaves them with a reassuring hope that sometimes, things really are ""too good NOT to be true.""",5,Not since Forrest Gump...,1197849600,"12 17, 2007",2007,1563,"['Not', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'Have', 'cried', 'so', 'much', 'movie', 'Not', 'Forrest', 'Gump', 'have', 'left', 'movie', 'feeling', 'so', 'touched', 'very', 'core', 'August', 'Rush', 'sweet', 'captivating', 'story', '11-year-old', 'musical', 'prodigy', 'power', 'simple', 'persistent', 'steadfast', 'faith', 'make', 'impossible', 'POSSIBLE', 'story', 'very', 'well', 'done', 'very', 'tenderly', 'told', 'incredibly', 'inspiring', 'uplifting.The', 'music', 'wonderful', 'acting', 'first-rate', 'reviewer', 'said', ""'m"", 'not', 'one', 'movie', 'soundtracks', 'one', 'plan', 'order', 'straight', 'away', '11-year-old', 'musical', 'prodigy', 'played', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'delightful', 'actor', 'part', ""'m"", 'one', 'people', 'who', ""n't"", 'really', 'care', 'flicks', 'cutesy', 'kids', 'movie', 'melted', 'heart', 'puddle', 'tears.It', 'also', 'keyhole', 'peak', 'how', 'truly', 'gifted', 'musicians', 'hear', 'experience', 'world', 'Speaking', 'someone', 'who', 'struggled', 'struggled', 'write', 'few', 'simple', 'books', 'was', 'pleasure', 'have', 'insight', 'how', 'true', 'genius', 'typically', 'laborious', 'process', 'creation.The', 'prevailing', 'theme', 'took', 'movie', 'could', 'strip', 'away', 'many', 'layers', 'fear', 'doubt', 'regret', 'guilt', 'other', 'dark', 'burdensome', 'emotions', 'then', ""'d"", 'be', 'easier', 'find', 'own', 'Insular', 'tahiti', 'highly', 'recommend', 'August', 'Rush', 'anyone', 'who', 'heart', 'recommend', 'even', 'more', 'people', 'who', 'want', 'see', 'movie', 'reassuring', 'hope', 'sometimes', 'things', 'really', 'are', 'too', 'good', 'NOT', 'be', 'true']",N/A

175438,A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB,1419827154,"Sarah ""Eat Dessert First""","[3, 5]","""August Rush,"" directed by Kirsten Sheridan (daughter of Jim Sheridan,In America), tells the tale of a lonely orphan (Freddie Highmore,Finding Neverland (Widescreen Edition)) who happens to be a musical prodigy (quite possibly an autistic savant). Lost in the system and tortured by the other boys for his strangeness, Evan clings to the music he finds running through him and the harmonics he can hear in nature. He's afraid to leave the boys' home, even though a new caseworker (Terrence Howard) seems to really connect with him. But one fateful day, Evan follows the music to New York City in an attempt to find his parents; he's sure that he can hear their music out there, and that he will find them through music.We also meet  Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell), a gifted cellist from a sheltered life, and Louis (Jonathan Rhys Meyers,The Tudors - The Complete First Season), a rough-around-the-edges Irish singer, as the two are drawn together for a night of rooftop hanky-panky under artificial moonlight (and the constant strains of Van Morrison'sMoondance). Throughout the film, we see what happens in the eleven years after that one-night-stand; Lyla becomes withdrawn and stops performing publically, and Louis quits the family band in order to pursue a business career. Both are miserable (and conveniently single). Look for the  cameo byMoonlight - The Complete Series's Alex O'Loughlin as Louis's brother. Keri and Jonathan both give strong performances (Jonathan in particular is a captivating screen presence). Jonathan sings his own material; he also performed on-screen inVelvet Goldmine.Based on the first part of the movie looking at Evan's lack of social skills, his high-level language, his introverted nature, and his interaction with the world around him, it seems quite possible that he's an autistic savant (Aspgerger's, perhaps). He doesn't have the skills needed to keep him safe on the streets, so he falls in with Wizard (Robin Williams). The film's setup is classic Oliver Twist: orphan (Evan) falls under the ""tutelage"" of Fagin (Wizard). Wizard has his large gang of orphaned street kids busk on corners, turning over their wages to him. Evan, who's never picked up an instrument in his life, suddenly masters the guitar (the first of the movie's dubious musical choices) and busks for Wizard. This questionable casting choice results in Williams donning cowboy getup, but still playing straight Williams; it doesn't work for the role, since as a PG-rated film Williams isn't allowed to be as violent as the role demands; I kept seeingPatch Adams - Collector's Editioninstead of Wizard. Also, I found the role of Wizard to be a disturbing one; to me, there seemed to be suggestions of pedophilic elements present (in one scene, Wizard and Evan are stretched out next to each other, and in another outtake, he has his arms wrapped around Evan in an embrace).  He comes across like a child pimp, making phone deals to sell Evan off to the highest bidder. It's unfortunate for Williams' character; Wizard has some of the deepest discussions about the nature of music and musical genius only to turn out to be so cruel.  He sets Evan up in a prime busking spot, but after a police raid, Evan's on his own once more, where he falls in with a minister who admits him to Juilliard. The climax revolves around Evan's ultimate quest to be reunited with his unknown parents; his first symphony will be performed in Central Park, attended by thousands of people. The ending is the film's biggest letdown; modern-day fairytale, I can understand, but there's absolutely zero payoff (although you can use your own imagination to fill in the blanks). Just one more frame would have sufficed.The film falters the most when it comes to suspension of musical disbelief; there are so many errors in the scenes showing musical notation and instrument playing by actors. The three leads are all dubbed; Keri had a cello double, Rhys Meyers had a guitar double (although that's him singing), and Highmore had Kaki King as his guitar double (the incredibly incongruous shots of her much larger hands on the guitar were jarring). All of the musical scenes are pieced together in a way that felt like an MTV montage. It felt like the whole crew knew nothing about music; even if he were a prodigy, there's NO WAY that Evan could be writing in perfect musical notation within five minutes of looking at a book (writing in his own homegrown notation, yes, but perfectly scoring everything on the first try?). Ditto with picking up the guitar and pipe organ and playing perfectly after one minute.  Also, for a first-year untested Juilliard student to be selected to compose a major symphony in the park? And the most jaw-dropping: throughout the movie, NO ONE stops to find out Evan's real name or identity (last time I checked, you're required to have a name and address when enrolling in a college, especially in one as prestigious as Juilliard). For a film that revolves around music, the lack of attention to detail ruined it for me, athough the love story between Lyla and Louis was handled tenderly.The film seemed too hampered by the PG rating; if it had been allowed to stretch its wings a little, it would have been more effective in its telling. For example, Louis's rough-and-tumble Irish family is prone to dust-ups, but no swearing . Evan is threatened by the other boys, but nothing beyond name-calling (most likely, some arm-twisting or beating up was no doubt involved). Lyla's evil jerk of a controlling father does the unthinkable, but that moment is simply brushed off in a nanosecond; more time to gauge the effect of this life-changing decision on Lyla would have added greater emotional depth.  Freddie Highmore's generally spaced-out, glassy-eyed look carries him through most of the film feeling as though he's an Aspie; there's precious little emotion emitted other than when he's wrapped up in musical ecstasy. He's purely detached (and the numerous extreme close-ups of his dilated eyes was just creepy during the concert scene).Overall, ""August Rush"" could have benefitted from a rewrite, a few reshot scenes, and tighter editing; the great performances are all there, they just need a little polishing. As a modern-day fairytale, it works on some levels but not others; it doesn't have quite enough teeth for the seriousness of some of the issues involved. The music is beautiful, but the combination of these smaller flaws added a few sour notes.

Everything has been said in the 60+ reviews already on this page and mine will likely never even be read!Why? Because this movie engages the senses (an amazing score, lush cinematography) and touches the heart from start to finish in ways quite unexpected and rare for films these days. It's a stunner and it makes you want to stand up and clap with joy, (or go on record on Amazon with an enthusiastic review!!)It is a beautiful fable, a metaphor for a deep and abiding truth that we are all interconnected and can 'listen' and 'hear' the harmonic of love that connects us.  The talented young actor who carries this film (Freddie Highmore) expresses the purity, innocence, and sense of wonder that lies within each of us -- evoked so beautifully in this timeless fable of 'yearning for Home' and 'dreams come true.' And any viewer (of any age - even the most jaded and cynical, I promise you) can relate to this universal theme and (perhaps in spite of oneself) feel uplifted.This simple little film is a beauty.

175444,A2IG2FG7L85RMU,1419827154,Stanley H. Nemeth,"[35, 74]","This film has been widely classified as ""a fairy tale"" for our times. But a fairy tale, as Bruno Bettleheim pointed out long ago, contains gritty elements of psychological realism and represents symbolically through its ogres and witches the dangers which all children confront on the road to maturity.""August Rush,"" on the other hand is just an indulgent exercise in New Age Wish Fulfillment. It could more accurately be classified not as a fairy tale but, to put it mildly, as ""a vast betrayal of life."" Consider in this regard its opening. A rock musician scores after a first meeting with a classical cellist on the rooftop of a Greenwich Village flat. She learns after their one-night-stand that she's pregnant. Naturally, these two individuals of low responsibility, separated after their only encounter by a controlling Hollywood-type parent, continue to hunger for each over an eleven year period. Yeah, right! Similarly, the controlling parent allows his erring daughter to bear the child, but then forges her signature to give it up for adoption. Shades of pleasing everybody, ""Juno"" or ""Murphy Brown"" style. Out of wedlock liasons are given a pass, so as to be thought daring, but pregnancies are then carried to term, so as not to the offend the pro-life section of the audience. This is once again the Hollywood mentality, trying to have things both ways, beginning with the seemingly daring, but landing on a very neat, conventional trajectory.The film, sad to say, goes from bed to worse. Children, I'm sure, would quickly see through its escalating preposterousness. Some weak-minded adults, on the other hand, interested in instant uplift, might be inclined to find it ""spiritual"" and ""exhilarating."" As Oscar Wilde said in another context, ""only a man without a heart"" could fail to laugh at the trials and tribulations of the characters in ""August Rush.""The only bearable performance, for my money, is that of Freddie Highmore, a talented child actor. Unfortunately, however, he may be finding himself, like Haley Joel Osment earlier, pushed into bad roles that undermine his ostensible skills. ""August Rush,"" I'd argue, is Freddie Highmore's ""Pay It Forward."" One hopes he or his agents exercise a better choice over scripts in the future. The worst performance in the film, not surprisingly, comes from Robin Williams, who became an act rather than an actor in ""Good Will Hunting,"" and has yet to recover. Just like Dustin Hoffman in recent roles, he's here playing yet another caricature of a weirdo to diminishing effect. The one star is for Freddie Highmore.",1,"""Bad!

175446,AZCDCO6KK2T81,1419827154,"Steven Hedge ""Movie Fan""","[5, 9]","I have rarely ever felt so positive and negative about a film as I did with this one.Amazon's synopsis of the film is good, so I'll be brief here with that.  The story is a rather shameless retelling of Dickens'Oliver Twist, but rather than finding parental love via handwritten notes like Oliver did, Rush finds it via musical notes.  There is even a Fagin-like character who appears to both love and care for the lost boys within his grasp as well as abuse and take advantage of them too.  With Little OrphanAnnieoptimism and spunk, Rush never loses sight of his goal to find his parents through music which is ""everywhere.""The film excels when it is not preaching and focuses on the music as the source of love and inspiration.  As soon as the music elements of the film stop, so does the audience's interest with its cliche-ridden dialogue, manipulative and unbelievable plot twists, and some hammy acting.The Hits and Misses of 'August Rush' are as follows for this reviewer (and, yes, I know that I am in the minority with my opinions on this film)The Hits:(1) The music is absolutely soaring, inspirational, and delightful to the point where one literally feels like he or she is on a cloud when hearing it and watching the actors perform it.(2) The cast are nearly all top-notch.  Freddie Highmore is outstanding in the lead and you will know him from countless films already in his young career.  Jonathan Rhys-Meyers and Keri Russell as his parents are perfect as is Terrence Howard as a dedicated social worker.(3) The story's feel good approach, new age philosophy, and ""Oliver Twist"" plot are both a hit and a miss with this film as they are handled at times very delicately and sincerely (through music mostly), and at other times they are handled too heavily and preachy to be any good at all when it shifts away from music to dialogue and plot emphasis.The Misses:(1) The big miss in this film is the casting of Robin Williams as the Fagin-like character.  He is just too over-the-top, which he often is lately, and appears to be just phoning in his performance with his trademark antics.  He's completely unbelievable in the role and he doesn't seem to even care that he is.  He is a complete distraction in the film as well as a total disappointment, and I'm a big Robin Williams fan; however, I find him desperate for attention these days with silly movies and even sillier performances.  His acting here reminds one of the kind of performances that big name actors give in films they consider to be in between their big films in which they are the star.  It's a small paycheck in between the big paychecks and it keeps their name out there.(2) The film suffers greatly from being very uneven.  The second the music stops, the story spirals into various lame attempts to manipulate the audience.  See #3 in my hits for clarification.(3) The dialogue is hokey and saccrine to the point of being cringe inducing.  I felt like I was watching a musical version ofThe Brady Bunch.(4) While the star, Freddie Highmore, gives a bravura performance, it will nag at you as to why he speaks with a British accent.  Yes, I know he IS British, but the story is in America and even though his father speaks with a Scottish accent, he never knew him growing up and he was raised in a New York orphanage.  I guess that is part of the spiritual, new age feel of the film in which his father has influence over him without ever having met him.  See what I mean by hokey?Many will be totally forgiving of this film's flaws in favor of its messages of love, hope, and inspirational music that can guide us in life.  I'm okay with that if that is the kind of person you are.  I've been known to do that too and did so with Neil Diamond's version ofThe Jazz Singer; however, I can't with this film.  Three stars doesn't mean I didn't like it.  The film is okay enough, but if I were to watch it again, I would end up fast forwarding to only the musical elements in the film (as I imagine some doing with ""The Jazz Singer"").  I found the rest of the film tedious, shamelessly manipulative, and a lame retelling of 'Oliver Twist'.  This is just my impression of this film that has a strong following and is rather loved by most, but to each his own.",3,August Rush is a very mixed bag.,1215561600,"07 9, 2008",2008,4245,"['have', 'rarely', 'ever', 'felt', 'so', 'positive', 'negative', 'film', 'did', 'one.Amazon', 'synopsis', 'film', 'good', ""'ll"", 'be', 'brief', 'here', 'story', 'rather', 'shameless', 'retelling', ""Dickens'Oliver"", 'Twist', 'rather', 'finding', 'parental', 'love', 'handwritten', 'notes', 'Oliver', 'did', 'Rush', 'musical', 'notes', 'even', 'Fagin-like', 'character', 'who', 'love', 'care', 'lost', 'boys', 'grasp', 'as', 'well', 'abuse', 'take', 'advantage', 'too', 'Little', 'OrphanAnnieoptimism', 'spunk', 'Rush', 'never', 'sight', 'goal', 'find', 'parents', 'music', 'everywhere', 'film', 'excels', 'when', 'not', 'preaching', 'focuses', 'music', 'source', 'love', 'inspiration', 'As', 'soon', 'music', 'elements', 'film', 'stop', 'so', 'audience', 'interest', 'cliche-ridden', 'dialogue', 'manipulative', 'unbelievable', 'plot', 'twists', 'hammy', 'acting.The', 'Hits', 'Misses', ""'August"", 'Rush', 'are', 'reviewer', 'yes', 'know', 'am', 'minority', 'opinions', 'film', 'Hits', '1', 'music', 'absolutely', 'soaring', 'inspirational', 'delightful', 'point', 'where', 'one', 'literally', 'cloud', 'when', 'hearing', 'watching', 'actors', 'perform', '2', 'cast', 'are', 'nearly', 'top-notch', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'outstanding', 'lead', 'will', 'know', 'countless', 'films', 'already', 'young', 'career', 'Jonathan', 'Rhys-Meyers', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'parents', 'are', 'perfect', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'dedicated', 'social', 'worker', '3', 'story', 'feel', 'good', 'approach', 'new', 'age', 'philosophy', 'Oliver', 'Twist', 'plot', 'are', 'hit', 'miss', 'film', 'are', 'handled', 'times', 'very', 'delicately', 'sincerely', 'music', 'mostly', 'other', 'times', 'are', 'handled', 'too', 'heavily', 'preachy', 'be', 'good', 'when', 'shifts', 'away', 'music', 'dialogue', 'plot', 'emphasis.The', 'Misses', '1', 'big', 'miss', 'film', 'casting', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Fagin-like', 'character', 'just', 'too', 'over-the-top', 'often', 'lately', 'be', 'just', 'phoning', 'performance', 'trademark', 'antics', 'completely', 'unbelievable', 'role', ""n't"", 'seem', 'even', 'care', 'complete', 'distraction', 'film', 'as', 'well', 'total', 'disappointment', ""'m"", 'big', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'fan', 'however', 'find', 'desperate', 'attention', 'days', 'silly', 'movies', 'even', 'sillier', 'performances', 'acting', 'here', 'one', 'kind', 'performances', 'big', 'name', 'actors', 'give', 'films', 'consider', 'be', 'big', 'films', 'are', 'star', 'small', 'paycheck', 'big', 'paychecks', 'name', 'there', '2', 'film', 'suffers', 'greatly', 'being', 'very', 'uneven', 'second', 'music', 'story', 'spirals', 'various', 'lame', 'attempts', 'manipulate', 'audience', 'See', '3', 'hits', 'clarification', '3', 'dialogue', 'hokey', 'saccrine', 'point', 'being', 'cringe', 'inducing', 'felt', 'was', 'watching', 'musical', 'version', 'Brady', 'Bunch', '4', 'star', 'Freddie', 'Highmore', 'bravura', 'performance', 'will', 'nag', 'why', 'British', 'accent', 'Yes', 'know', 'British', 'story', 'America', 'even', 'father', 'Scottish', 'accent', 'never', 'knew', 'growing', 'up', 'was', 'raised', 'New', 'York', 'orphanage', 'guess', 'part', 'spiritual', 'new', 'age', 'feel', 'film', 'father', 'influence', 'ever', 'having', 'met', 'See', 'what', 'mean', 'hokey', 'Many', 'will', 'be', 'totally', 'forgiving', 'film', 'flaws', 'favor', 'messages', 'love', 'hope', 'inspirational', 'music', 'can', 'guide', 'life', ""'m"", 'okay', 'kind', 'person', 'are', ""'ve"", 'been', 'known', 'do', 'too', 'did', 'so', 'Neil', 'Diamond', 'version', 'ofThe', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'however', 'ca', ""n't"", 'film', 'Three', 'stars', ""n't"", 'mean', 'did', ""n't"", 'film', 'okay', 'enough', 'were', 'watch', 'again', 'would', 'end', 'up', 'fast', 'forwarding', 'only', 'musical', 'elements', 'film', 'imagine', 'doing', 'Jazz', 'Singer', 'found', 'rest', 'film', 'tedious', 'shamelessly', 'manipulative', 'lame', 'retelling', ""'Oliver"", 'Twist', 'just', 'impression', 'film', 'strong', 'following', 'rather', 'loved', 'most', 'own']",N/A

175455,A25QJBK33C4O0R,1419827154,"terpfan1980 ""Barry""","[6, 9]","August Rush would probably be considered an interesting film for most, but a fascinating film for music lovers.  A somewhat whimsical tale of a gifted child that never knew his parents.  Gifted in that the child hears music all around him, calling to him, almost begging to be recorded and played for others to enjoy.  Never knowing his parents because he was given up for adoption as a baby.  Hoping to somehow connect to his parents and feeling that perhaps music can bring everyone together.Jonathan Rhys Meyers (of The Tudors and other works) is the father he never knew.  Working with his more natural accent as an Irish rock and roll band member.  Keri Russell (Felicity and others) is the mother who was a featured member of the Philarmonic.  The two 'hook up' at a party, but are kept apart by her father.  Both are obviously gifted musicians in their own right, so they will of course produce a child prodigy.Mixed in along the way are roles for Robin Williams, Terrence Howard and others that cross paths with the various characters here.  Can fate bring the proper parties together, or can there be no happy ending?  I've probably spoiled (unintentionally) that with my review title, but you've also probably already figured that by the time you read this review or any of the others here (or perhaps you saw the trailers for this film when it was in theatrical release).The film didn't last that long in theatres, apparently not being able to find it's own voice amongst the rush and crush of other choices that potential movie-goers had to spend their entertainment money on.  That's a shame as parts of the film would be wonderful to view on a big screen.  Not that the high definition transfer for the Blu-ray is bad (nor will the same transfer that will be used for the HD DVD release be), or even the image (by what I've seen) for the DVD version.  No, they translate just fine to the smaller screen, but perhaps could be better enjoyed on a larger canvas.The film is obviously about music and the music dominates throughout.  Not overwhelmingly so, but it's obvious that sound is a key element here, and dialogue is used more sparingly in conveying the message and interaction between the characters in the story.  The music is well choosen throughout, and helped to earn the film an Academy Award Nomination for one of it's musical selections.  Unfortunately for this film, there was strong competition from several films, so the prize went elsewhere and the film continued to be largely ignored without the 'bump' of being an Oscar winner.I've rated the film at 3 stars.  Yet again, I think this is a film that deserves a little better, but not that much better.  Some will quite obviously find it quite enjoyable and think that it deserves more.  I understand that thinking and wouldn't argue with those that love the film.  I think most people would enjoy it once through, but not feel compelled to watch it repeatedly.  I could be wrong, but part of what might convince me to purchase a film like this on disc would be having more to explore on the disc.  Unfortunately the studio apparently didn't feel compelled to add much to the disc for this particular under-performer.  A selection of deleted scenes is all that is there.  No making of, no mini-documentary on selecting the music for the film, composing or performing the music, making the actors look believable in being gifted musicians, or anything else.For most people, I'd recommend renting first.  You may throughly enjoy the film and wish to purchase, but you also may feel it was not something you wished to spend too much money on owning.  Try before you buy here if you can.A quick nit to pick here on the film.  The use of time within the film, showing events of the past to set up how these characters got to be where they are in modern time is fine, but in showing the characters before the title character is conceived and born the parental characters are later surprisingly unchanged and apparently haven't aged a bit.  I realize that depicting a passage of a little more than a decade isn't easy, but at the same time people change.  You don't appear the same at 20 as you would at 30, or at 25 versus 35.  I wish film makers would put a little more effort into noticing such little things so they don't become distractions to films like this, and so that viewers are given more of a sense of a passage of time.",3,A feel good film for music lovers,1205971200,"03 20, 2008",2008,4406,"['August', 'Rush', 'would', 'probably', 'be', 'considered', 'interesting', 'film', 'most', 'fascinating', 'film', 'music', 'lovers', 'somewhat', 'whimsical', 'tale', 'gifted', 'child', 'never', 'knew', 'parents', 'Gifted', 'child', 'hears', 'music', 'calling', 'almost', 'begging', 'be', 'recorded', 'played', 'others', 'enjoy', 'Never', 'knowing', 'parents', 'was', 'given', 'up', 'adoption', 'baby', 'Hoping', 'somehow', 'connect', 'parents', 'feeling', 'perhaps', 'music', 'can', 'bring', 'everyone', 'together.Jonathan', 'Rhys', 'Meyers', 'Tudors', 'other', 'works', 'father', 'never', 'knew', 'Working', 'more', 'natural', 'accent', 'Irish', 'rock', 'roll', 'band', 'member', 'Keri', 'Russell', 'Felicity', 'others', 'mother', 'who', 'was', 'featured', 'member', 'Philarmonic', 'two', ""'hook"", 'up', 'party', 'are', 'kept', 'apart', 'father', 'are', 'obviously', 'gifted', 'musicians', 'own', 'right', 'will', 'course', 'produce', 'child', 'prodigy.Mixed', 'way', 'are', 'roles', 'Robin', 'Williams', 'Terrence', 'Howard', 'others', 'cross', 'paths', 'various', 'characters', 'here', 'Can', 'fate', 'bring', 'proper', 'parties', 'together', 'can', 'there', 'be', 'happy', 'ending', ""'ve"", 'probably', 'spoiled', 'unintentionally', 'review', 'title', ""'ve"", 'also', 'probably', 'already', 'figured', 'time', 'read', 'review', 'others', 'here', 'perhaps', 'saw', 'trailers', 'film', 'when', 'was', 'theatrical', 'release', '.The', 'film', 'did', ""n't"", 'last', 'long', 'theatres', 'apparently', 'not', 'being', 'able', 'find', 'own', 'voice', 'rush', 'crush', 'other', 'choices', 'potential', 'movie-goers', 'had', 'spend', 'entertainment', 'money', 'shame', 'parts', 'film', 'would', 'be', 'wonderful', 'view', 'big', 'screen', 'Not', 'high', 'definition', 'transfer', 'Blu-ray', 'bad', 'will', 'same', 'transfer', 'will', 'be', 'used', 'HD', 'DVD', 'release', 'be', 'even', 'image', 'what', ""'ve"", 'seen', 'DVD', 'version', 'No', 'translate', 'just', 'fine', 'smaller', 'screen', 'perhaps', 'could', 'be', 'better', 'enjoyed', 'larger', 'canvas.The', 'film', 'obviously', 'music', 'music', 'Not', 'overwhelmingly', 'so', 'obvious', 'sound', 'key', 'element', 'here', 'dialogue', 'used', 'more', 'sparingly', 'conveying', 'message', 'interaction', 'characters', 'story', 'music', 'well', 'choosen', 'helped', 'earn', 'film', 'Academy', 'Award', 'Nomination', 'one', 'musical', 'selections', 'Unfortunately', 'film', 'was', 'strong', 'competition', 'several', 'films', 'prize', 'went', 'elsewhere', 'film', 'continued', 'be', 'largely', 'ignored', ""'bump"", 'being', 'Oscar', 'winner.I', ""'ve"", 'rated', 'film', '3', 'stars', 'Yet', 'again', 'think', 'film', 'little', 'better', 'not', 'much', 'better', 'will', 'quite', 'obviously', 'find', 'quite', 'enjoyable', 'think', 'more', 'understand', 'thinking', 'would', ""n't"", 'argue', 'love', 'film', 'think', 'most', 'people', 'would', 'enjoy', 'once', 'not', 'feel', 'compelled', 'watch', 'repeatedly', 'could', 'be', 'wrong', 'part', 'what', 'might', 'convince', 'purchase', 'film', 'disc', 'would', 'be', 'having', 'more', 'explore', 'disc', 'Unfortunately', 'studio', 'apparently', 'did', ""n't"", 'feel', 'compelled', 'add', 'much', 'disc', 'particular', 'under-performer', 'selection', 'deleted', 'scenes', 'there', 'No', 'making', 'mini-documentary', 'selecting', 'music', 'film', 'composing', 'performing', 'music', 'making', 'actors', 'look', 'believable', 'being', 'gifted', 'musicians', 'anything', 'else.For', 'most', 'people', ""'d"", 'recommend', 'renting', 'first', 'may', 'throughly', 'enjoy', 'film', 'wish', 'purchase', 'also', 'may', 'feel', 'was', 'not', 'something', 'wished', 'spend', 'too', 'much', 'money', 'owning', 'Try', 'buy', 'here', 'can.A', 'quick', 'nit', 'pick', 'here', 'film', 'use', 'time', 'film', 'showing', 'events', 'past', 'set', 'up', 'how', 'characters', 'got', 'be', 'where', 'are', 'modern', 'time', 'fine', 'showing', 'characters', 'title', 'character', 'conceived', 'born', 'parental', 'characters', 'are', 'later', 'surprisingly', 'unchanged', 'apparently', 'have', ""n't"", 'aged', 'bit', 'realize', 'depicting', 'passage', 'little', 'more', 'decade', ""n't"", 'easy', 'same', 'time', 'people', 'change', 'do', ""n't"", 'appear', 'same', '20', 'would', '30', '25', 'versus', '35', 'wish', 'film', 'makers', 'would', 'put', 'little', 'more', 'effort', 'noticing', 'such', 'little', 'things', 'do', ""n't"", 'become', 'distractions', 'films', 'so', 'viewers', 'are', 'given', 'more', 'sense', 'passage', 'time']",N/A

175461,A2GJ98824GGXGP,1419827154,Timothy Kearney,"[0, 0]","I have to admit, I stayed away from AUGUST RUSH due to the commercials and the negative reviews that appeared in my local newspapers and on some local television shows. It looked like it would be a bit too syrupy and critics warned it was too far fetched. I decided to save the money and wait for the DVD. After seeing the DVD, I'm sorry I waited so long to see this film. It's enchanting and heart warming and an all around feel good flick.The story focuses on Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore), a young boy growing up in a New York home for children. His conception is the result of a romantic evening involving a classically trained musician  Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and Louis Connolly, an Irish born member of  Celtic musical group (Jonathan Rhys Myers). Due to tragic and cruel circumstances, the young Evan is placed up for adoption but never seems to find a family. After being bullied at the home, Evan sets out to find his parents, believing that the music will guide him and the most of the film revolves around his journey.Critics are correct in stating that the story is far fetched, and there are quite a few gaps and questions that remain unanswered, but this is the case with many movies, and we still love them, the reason being the actors make the film convincing and we tend to ignore the flaws. The reason AUGUST RUSH works is due to the wonderful performances of the actors, particularly the young Freddie Highmore. His performance is so appealing, we hope for the bets for the young man, knowing all the while that the film will have a happy ending. We also feel for Keri Russell's Lyla and Rhys Meyer's Louis Connolly is an all around good guy as well. Robin Williams' character ""Wizard"" is a bit creepy and a bit too one dimensional, to Williams' credit he does do his bets to bring the character to life. Another notable performer in the film is Leon Thomas III who plays Arthur, a gifted child performer living on the street who rescues the young Evan while unknowingly placing him in danger.In many ways, AUGUST RUSH has a number of similarities to OLIVER TWIST (the novel more so than the musical film OLIVER!), Evan being similar to the innocent Oliver Twist, Wizard being similar to Fagin ,an d Arthur, a street child similar to The Artful Dodger, and some of the challenges the young Evan faces are Dickensian-like. Yet just as readers root for Oliver and want the best for him, the same holds true for the young Evan.

175469,A1ULFDXVXS2ALX,1419827154,Victoria A. Grossack,"[1, 1]","This is a different sort of movie for me.  I tend to prefer movies with great dialogue and watertight plots - and this movie, although it has some important dialogue, is also significant for the dialogue that it leaves out.  It also has a plot that is so surrealistic that it requires suspension of belief.  And the montages, as everyone is rushing towards the concert in Central Park, are beautiful but I can't help asking things like, ""How did Mr. Jeffries get there in time?  Where was August's tuxedo?""It was also interesting to watch the scenes which were deleted.  They contained talk and exposition - but the movie is a fairytale which requires faith rather than logic.  Another missing scene (not one of the deleted) why didn't Lyla, Louis and August say anything to each other at the end?  The answer was that words were insufficient - music and video had to capture what could not be expressed in words.I recommend that watchers put aside their attachment to wit and logical consistency and pay attention to what works in the film. The film has the interesting premise that the universe is connected to each other through sound and music.  (I think it might be connected on other dimensions as well.)  We just need to listen, and we might become aware.And, if you watch the movie carefully, you will pick up certain gems.  For example, it is Wiz playing down below when Lyla and Louis spend their only night together.  The expressiveness of the faces of the actors who play Louis and August are absolutley fabulous.  The one real musician - the girl who plays Hope - makes our spirits soar when she sings.Appreciating this film requires a different approach.  It's like having to stand back when looking at paintings by Monet and Renoir.

I also really enjoyed the fact that this film's universe isn't violent or cruel.  What a relief after the mean and vicious characters we've had to pay money to watch in other pictures this past season!  And I really like young Freddie Highmore.  It's good to see him in a picture where he's able to shine on center stage.As to the plot, the similarities to ""Oliver Twist"" are too many to go un-noticed.  A young street musician plays the role of the Artful Dodger, bringing Our Hero back to an abandoned theater swarming with orphaned street kids.  The gang is headed up by a slimey, Fagin-esque Robin Williams, to whom the kids give the money they earn as street buskers.  Instead of a sympathetic magistrate, we have sympathetic social worker and a sympathetic minister of the gospel.As in the Dickens novel, our young hero gets a taste of the good life at the Julliard School of Music, but Fagin (oops, Williams as ""The Wizard"") is tipped off by the Dodger, and drags our hero back into the street life.  Everything works out in a happy ending, though, and Oliver (oops, August) is happily re-united with his family.I guess what keeps this from being 5 stars for me is just the blatantness of the story-lifting, and the predictability of it from that point of view.

I had to turn it off at about the hour mark when the kid, upon getting his hands on a guitar for the first time, banged out music worthy of a skilled musician. Even used a piano style technique on the fretboard that would at least have gotten a nod from Eddie Van Halen. Please, give me a break. I get it. It's a fantasy. Maybe science fiction? Of course it takes hours of study and effort to get anything resembling music out of any instrument. Ok, maybe not a kazoo. I guess the sale of musical instruments will skyrocket now.
