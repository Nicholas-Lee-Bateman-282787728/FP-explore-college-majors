913798,A1IL6W1NK05UW9,B0009VBU3Q,"C. Baker ""cbaker""","[23, 25]","Rayful Edmond III probably is the most notorious drug dealer in Washington, D.C. history.  In the early 90's when he was arrested for running a criminal enterprise the trial riveted the area, or at least me.  From news accounts he started drug dealing at an early age - in fact his entire family has a history of organized criminal activity dating back to the fifties.  I read a newspaper account that claimed he was bagging cocaine for his father at the tender age of 3.This docudrama uses news clips, interviews with Edmond associates and undercover cops, televised interviews with Edmund himself, and reenactments to tell Edmond's life story.  For the most part it is okay but the choice of music is sometimes questionable and the arrest scene staged for this film was a bit silly and overblown.This docudrama appears to be told from the point of view of Rayful Edmond.  It tries to make Edmond out really not to be that bad of a guy.  His associates describe him as a peaceful, fun loving guy throwing money around to all his friends and neighbors.  For example, he settled a violent gang war because it was hurting both his business and the rival gang's.  And all those witnesses schedule to appear at this trial that got murdered?  That was somebody else not Edmond!  Give me a break!  This guy had connections to the Columbian drug lords and was crafty enough to broker drug deals from jail.  I find it incredulous to claim he didn't have anything to do with witnesses getting knocked off or that he wasn't part of all the violence that gripped DC because of drugs in the late `80s and early `90s (and still does today).So I have to give this so called documentary a thumbs down.  It seems too slanted toward making the best case possible that Rayful Edmond was just a guy with a different line work.  If it had told this story and the other side of the story then I'd sing its praises, because who knows?  Maybe there is more to Edmond than news accounts make him out to be.  But this documentary certainly doesn't make a very convincing case for it.",2,Give Me a Break!,1123545600,"08 9, 2005",2005,2058,"['Rayful', 'Edmond', 'III', 'probably', 'most', 'notorious', 'drug', 'dealer', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'history', 'early', '90', 'when', 'was', 'arrested', 'running', 'criminal', 'enterprise', 'trial', 'riveted', 'area', 'least', 'news', 'accounts', 'started', 'drug', 'dealing', 'early', 'age', 'fact', 'entire', 'family', 'history', 'organized', 'criminal', 'activity', 'dating', 'back', 'fifties', 'read', 'newspaper', 'account', 'claimed', 'was', 'bagging', 'cocaine', 'father', 'tender', 'age', '3.This', 'docudrama', 'news', 'clips', 'interviews', 'Edmond', 'associates', 'undercover', 'cops', 'televised', 'interviews', 'Edmund', 'reenactments', 'tell', 'Edmond', 'life', 'story', 'most', 'part', 'okay', 'choice', 'music', 'sometimes', 'questionable', 'arrest', 'scene', 'staged', 'film', 'was', 'bit', 'silly', 'overblown.This', 'docudrama', 'be', 'told', 'point', 'view', 'Rayful', 'Edmond', 'make', 'Edmond', 'really', 'not', 'be', 'bad', 'guy', 'associates', 'describe', 'peaceful', 'fun', 'loving', 'guy', 'throwing', 'money', 'friends', 'neighbors', 'example', 'settled', 'violent', 'gang', 'war', 'was', 'hurting', 'business', 'rival', 'gang', 'witnesses', 'schedule', 'appear', 'trial', 'got', 'murdered', 'was', 'somebody', 'else', 'not', 'Edmond', 'Give', 'break', 'guy', 'had', 'connections', 'Columbian', 'drug', 'lords', 'was', 'crafty', 'enough', 'broker', 'drug', 'deals', 'jail', 'find', 'incredulous', 'claim', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'anything', 'do', 'witnesses', 'getting', 'knocked', 'off', 'was', ""n't"", 'part', 'violence', 'gripped', 'DC', 'drugs', 'late', '80s', 'early', '90s', 'still', 'today', '.So', 'have', 'give', 'so', 'called', 'documentary', 'thumbs', 'down', 'too', 'slanted', 'making', 'best', 'case', 'possible', 'Rayful', 'Edmond', 'was', 'just', 'guy', 'different', 'line', 'work', 'had', 'told', 'story', 'other', 'side', 'story', 'then', ""'d"", 'sing', 'praises', 'who', 'Maybe', 'more', 'Edmond', 'news', 'accounts', 'make', 'be', 'documentary', 'certainly', ""n't"", 'make', 'very', 'convincing', 'case']",The Life of Rayful Edmond - Rise and Fall Vol. 1

While Nancy Reagan cried ""Just Say No"" and mandatory minimum prison sentencing and conspiracy laws were lurking just around the corner, a young Rayful Edmond III started his path to become the most notorious and successful drug kingpin in the DC area.The film profiles his life from a child selling drugs on street corners; rise to lavish fast-paced lifestyle enjoying the best money could buy; and fall - the infamous drug bust that took down Edmond and 30 family members friends and associates.  A bust made possible by an organization breach on the highest level - greed and disloyalty of both his childhood school mate and confidant, and a woman he trusted immeasurably.But his reign was not over.As did Avon from HBO's ""The Wire"", Edmond continued to run his empire from behind bars, using Columbia drug dealer contacts made while serving two life sentences, to expand his drug trafficking operation.  In turn he received additional 30 years to his sentence.But still you have to ask if it's truly over.If you are from the DC area and have heard buzz about Edmond; the film leaves rumors unaddressed, perhaps to protect the innocent and maybe the guilty as well.  Nonetheless, what is revealed what many are unaware of - his childhood, and family ties to crime dating back to the 1950's, painting a picture of one who never stood a chance to think of aiming to excel anywhere outside of the only world he knew.No matter where you are from, if you like crime, social & cultural, or biographical documentaries, you will find this film an interesting, great start for new Director-producer Kirk Fraser.Other than shameless plugs for a clothing line owned by the co-producer, the flow of the film was targeted - hitting the mark.A definite must-watch intriguing story of wealth, self-indulgence, disloyalty, and tragedy - an overall great depiction of Edmond's life.",4,Tarnished Platinum Life,1124323200,"08 18, 2005",2005,1971,"['Rise', 'Fall', 'Rayful', 'Edmond', 'III', 'only', 'place', 'could', 'North', 'East', 'DC', '1980', 'Nancy', 'Reagan', 'cried', 'Just', 'Say', 'No', 'mandatory', 'minimum', 'prison', 'sentencing', 'conspiracy', 'laws', 'were', 'lurking', 'just', 'corner', 'young', 'Rayful', 'Edmond', 'III', 'started', 'path', 'become', 'most', 'notorious', 'successful', 'drug', 'kingpin', 'DC', 'area.The', 'film', 'life', 'child', 'selling', 'drugs', 'street', 'corners', 'rise', 'lavish', 'fast-paced', 'lifestyle', 'enjoying', 'best', 'money', 'could', 'buy', 'fall', 'infamous', 'drug', 'bust', 'took', 'down', 'Edmond', '30', 'family', 'members', 'friends', 'associates', 'bust', 'made', 'possible', 'organization', 'breach', 'highest', 'level', 'greed', 'disloyalty', 'childhood', 'school', 'mate', 'confidant', 'woman', 'trusted', 'immeasurably.But', 'reign', 'was', 'not', 'over.As', 'did', 'Avon', 'HBO', 'Wire', 'Edmond', 'continued', 'run', 'empire', 'bars', 'using', 'Columbia', 'drug', 'dealer', 'contacts', 'made', 'serving', 'two', 'life', 'sentences', 'expand', 'drug', 'trafficking', 'operation', 'turn', 'received', 'additional', '30', 'years', 'sentence.But', 'still', 'have', 'ask', 'truly', 'over.If', 'are', 'DC', 'area', 'have', 'heard', 'buzz', 'Edmond', 'film', 'rumors', 'unaddressed', 'perhaps', 'protect', 'innocent', 'maybe', 'guilty', 'well', 'Nonetheless', 'what', 'revealed', 'what', 'many', 'are', 'unaware', 'childhood', 'family', 'ties', 'crime', 'dating', 'back', '1950', 'painting', 'picture', 'one', 'who', 'never', 'stood', 'chance', 'think', 'aiming', 'excel', 'anywhere', 'only', 'world', 'matter', 'where', 'are', 'like', 'crime', 'social', 'cultural', 'biographical', 'documentaries', 'will', 'find', 'film', 'interesting', 'great', 'start', 'new', 'Director-producer', 'Kirk', 'Fraser.Other', 'shameless', 'plugs', 'clothing', 'line', 'owned', 'co-producer', 'flow', 'film', 'was', 'targeted', 'hitting', 'mark.A', 'definite', 'must-watch', 'intriguing', 'story', 'wealth', 'self-indulgence', 'disloyalty', 'tragedy', 'overall', 'great', 'depiction', 'Edmond', 'life']",The Life of Rayful Edmond - Rise and Fall Vol. 1

Rayful Edmond was the biggest drug dealer in the history of Washington, D.C.  His family had been involved in illegal activities when he was a youngster and this laid the path for his own ""career path"".  In the cocaine explosion of the mid 1980s he reportedly made $300,000,000 a year distributing poison to Americans including many within his own community.We see the ""rise"" of Edmond's rapid accumulation of material goods and expansion of his ""operation"".  He bought several expensive cars and gambled thousands of dollars ""as a joke"".  It covers his closest friends who became instrumental in his arrest and ultimately testified against him in court and the ridiculous trial.  The epilogue states that while incarcerated, Edmond became involved with the notorious Medellin drug cartel (which was itself connected to CIA asset Barry Seal.)  Perhaps it is not a shock that in order to help his mother get out of prison he became a government informant.I will say one thing which is that the story has a lot less glamorized violence than other similar stories.  In clips from the TV news show ""DATELINE"", Edmond seems remorseful and says he wasn't trying to get anybody killed but that he didn't have the foresight of that aspect of his ""business"".  He seems sincere that he wasn't trying to get anybody murdered but of course he was the ""king"" of selling a toxic substance to drug addicts.  In the special features, the director and producer state that they are trying to show people the error of Edmond's ways and that there are other options besides drug dealing.  Whether you think they succeed or not, it at least shows more self-awareness than other similar DVDs.The movie is very well made in that it cuts between ""dramatizations"" and interviews with Raymond's former associates and people at various levels of law enforcement who were on the Edmond case.  The makers of this DVD went the extra mile to get the news footage from the time and various interviews with Edmond.  The music is mostly repetitive ambient music similar to the TV show 'UNSOLVED MYSTERIES"".  Occasionally there is sort of religious sounding music (for example in the arrest scene) which is intended to make the turning points of the story seem like major events in history.  Edmond seems like a smart man, I wonder what he could've accomplished if he had chosen a different path.  I will check for Kirk Fraser's movies in the future.",3,"""the Babe Ruth of crack dealers?""",1174867200,"03 26, 2007",2007,2602,"['LIFE', 'OF', 'RAYFUL', 'EDMOND', 'RISE', 'FALL', 'VOL.1', '2005', 'directed', 'Kirk', 'Fraserapprox', '75', 'minutesThis', 'probably', 'best', 'recent', 'slew', 'documentaries', 'high', 'profile', 'drug', 'dealers', 'Rayful', 'Edmond', 'was', 'biggest', 'drug', 'dealer', 'history', 'Washington', 'D.C.', 'family', 'had', 'been', 'involved', 'illegal', 'activities', 'when', 'was', 'youngster', 'laid', 'path', 'own', 'career', 'path', 'cocaine', 'explosion', 'mid', '1980s', 'reportedly', 'made', '300,000,000', 'year', 'distributing', 'poison', 'Americans', 'including', 'many', 'own', 'community.We', 'see', 'rise', 'Edmond', 'rapid', 'accumulation', 'material', 'goods', 'expansion', 'operation', 'bought', 'several', 'expensive', 'cars', 'gambled', 'thousands', 'dollars', 'joke', 'closest', 'friends', 'who', 'became', 'instrumental', 'arrest', 'ultimately', 'testified', 'court', 'ridiculous', 'trial', 'epilogue', 'states', 'incarcerated', 'Edmond', 'became', 'involved', 'notorious', 'Medellin', 'drug', 'cartel', 'was', 'connected', 'CIA', 'asset', 'Barry', 'Seal', 'Perhaps', 'not', 'shock', 'order', 'help', 'mother', 'get', 'prison', 'became', 'government', 'informant.I', 'will', 'say', 'one', 'thing', 'story', 'lot', 'less', 'glamorized', 'violence', 'other', 'similar', 'stories', 'clips', 'TV', 'news', 'show', 'DATELINE', 'Edmond', 'remorseful', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'get', 'anybody', 'killed', 'did', ""n't"", 'have', 'foresight', 'aspect', 'business', 'sincere', 'was', ""n't"", 'trying', 'get', 'anybody', 'murdered', 'course', 'was', 'king', 'selling', 'toxic', 'substance', 'drug', 'addicts', 'special', 'features', 'director', 'producer', 'state', 'are', 'trying', 'show', 'people', 'error', 'Edmond', 'ways', 'are', 'other', 'options', 'drug', 'dealing', 'think', 'succeed', 'not', 'least', 'shows', 'more', 'self-awareness', 'other', 'similar', 'DVDs.The', 'movie', 'very', 'well', 'made', 'dramatizations', 'interviews', 'Raymond', 'former', 'associates', 'people', 'various', 'levels', 'law', 'enforcement', 'who', 'were', 'Edmond', 'case', 'makers', 'DVD', 'went', 'extra', 'mile', 'get', 'news', 'footage', 'time', 'various', 'interviews', 'Edmond', 'music', 'mostly', 'repetitive', 'ambient', 'music', 'similar', 'TV', 'show', 'MYSTERIES', 'Occasionally', 'sort', 'religious', 'sounding', 'music', 'example', 'arrest', 'scene', 'intended', 'make', 'turning', 'points', 'story', 'seem', 'major', 'events', 'history', 'Edmond', 'smart', 'man', 'wonder', 'what', 'could', ""'ve"", 'accomplished', 'had', 'chosen', 'different', 'path', 'will', 'check', 'Kirk', 'Fraser', 'movies', 'future']",The Life of Rayful Edmond - Rise and Fall Vol. 1

Rayful quickly moved on to wholesaling kilos of cocaine when he secured a Colombian connection through the infamous Cali Cartel. His real claim to fame came when he got busted again after being sent to prison, dealing multiple kilogram shipments of coke, while in the feds at USP Lewisburg. This time through a Medellin Cartel hookup he developed while inside. The feds said Rayful was dealing more cocaine from inside then he ever did while he was on the streets. Rayful turned snitch though, tarnishing his legacy in the process. Still he is a certified street legend. His life and times are what rappers portray in their hip-hop gangsta fantasy videos. Rayful has remained a legend in DC and in the annals of gangster lore and is one of the most infamous characters from the crack era.Check out the interview Rayful's enforcer Antonio Jones gave in the new F.E.D.S. magazine for more insight on this street icon whose name has been celebrated in the lyrical lore of hip-hop.",4,A Legend Tarnished,1335398400,"04 26, 2012",2012,1162,"['good', 'documentary', 'celebrated', 'Washington', 'DC', 'drug', 'lord', 'Rayful', 'Edmond', 'who', 'rose', 'prominence', '1980s', 'retailing', 'crack', 'cocaine', 'open', 'air', 'drug', 'market', 'nation', 'capital', 'Rayful', 'quickly', 'moved', 'wholesaling', 'kilos', 'cocaine', 'when', 'secured', 'Colombian', 'connection', 'infamous', 'Cali', 'Cartel', 'real', 'claim', 'fame', 'came', 'when', 'got', 'busted', 'again', 'being', 'sent', 'prison', 'dealing', 'multiple', 'kilogram', 'shipments', 'coke', 'feds', 'USP', 'Lewisburg', 'time', 'Medellin', 'Cartel', 'hookup', 'developed', 'inside', 'feds', 'said', 'Rayful', 'was', 'dealing', 'more', 'cocaine', 'then', 'ever', 'did', 'was', 'streets', 'Rayful', 'turned', 'snitch', 'tarnishing', 'legacy', 'process', 'Still', 'certified', 'street', 'legend', 'life', 'times', 'are', 'what', 'rappers', 'portray', 'hip-hop', 'gangsta', 'fantasy', 'videos', 'Rayful', 'remained', 'legend', 'DC', 'annals', 'gangster', 'lore', 'one', 'most', 'infamous', 'characters', 'crack', 'era.Check', 'interview', 'Rayful', 'enforcer', 'Antonio', 'Jones', 'gave', 'new', 'F.E.D.S', 'magazine', 'more', 'insight', 'street', 'icon', 'name', 'been', 'celebrated', 'lyrical', 'lore', 'hip-hop']",The Life of Rayful Edmond - Rise and Fall Vol. 1
913803,AEM0E9A4XGYFH,B0009VBU3Q,K. Reynolds,"[6, 9]","I originally planned on giving this documentary a 3.5 stars rating, but remembered that this docufilm is the up and coming Kirk Fraser's debut as a director. Coming from a director with limited resources and a limited budget, This film supersedes all expectations. So let's give this young man a break. Fraser really did his homework for this project and it shows.Rayful Edmonds was not only the biggest dope dealer in the D.C. area, he was arguably within the top 10 list of this entire country's most notorious drug dealers. The killing sprees and increased murder rates of the mid-to late 80's to the early 90's in D.C. can be directly attributed to Rayful Edmonds and his hand in the colossal influx of cocaine and later crack. This DVD highlight's Edmonds' origins and keeps you glued to the tube for the Mach speeded rise to the top in the 80's. I liked the fact that this documentary provided so much credible info on those who surrounded Edmonds, who played a major part in his downfall later on. Fraser was able to provide the audience with some exclusive interviews with Rayful (previously recorded) as well as rare FBI wire tap audio bytes, which has his mother and other associates speaking in pig-Latin to confuse the Feds. The police and FBI agents who were assigned to infiltrate and bring down Rayful's operation are also interviewed. This DVD is very informative and I've heard so many urban legends behind this sad figure who destroyed so many lives in this country.I've seen other documentaries that highlighted Notorious criminals throughout my time, and I must say I was impressed with this one in particular...simply because it does not glorify Edmonds and the activity he was involved in. It's sad that so many of us glorify these individuals like Gods. Rayful Edmonds is responsible for more deaths than the average man can fathom.As for the negatives. I would have liked to have seen more information unfolded on Rayful's personal life. I've heard numerous stories about his ""questionable"" sexuality and behaviors, I would have liked to have seen that brought to the light. The actors providing the re-enactments looked nothing like the actual people who they were portraying in the film. Rayful was slim and fit, and the guy they selected to play Rayful looks like a low budget version of a cross between Ruben Studdard and Gerald Levert. In addition, Fraser could have done a much better job in making the clothing, fashions, music, etc...more complimentary to the era of the 1980's. Everyone in the film is dressed in 2005 fashion, so this throws the audience off quite a bit. Especially for those unfamiliar with this story. And since we're on the subject of fashion...the co-producer of this film, who actually used to run with Rayful, shamelessly plugs his hideous looking clothing line called All_Daz throughout the entire film. No one outside of the DC area is going to wear that junk, so why bother plugging it? That took major points away from this one really hitting a home run.I currently live in the DC area, and I was lucky to get my hands on this on its release date. This was sold out in every media outlet in the DC/Baltimore/Northern Virginia area for an entire month. Ultimately, I was impressed and I am looking forward to Fraser's upcoming documentary on the Len Bias story.",4,The Washington D.C.

I give kudos to the director for using actual news footage from the various local and national media outlets and for interviewing officers and agents involved in the case.I just wish the director would've put forth more effort in utilizing an actor who actually resembled Rayful and that the actors used in the documentary wore gear reminiscent to the late '80's (a track suit wouldn't have been too hard to find or Madness gear) instead of All_Daz gear (this clothing line wasn't established back then, but since the owner is the producer of the film, now I know why it was used - can you say self promotion).Hopefully volume 2 will be better....",2,Just didn't dig deep enough...many inadequacies...,1182816000,"06 26, 2007",2007,1137,"['teenager', 'growing', 'up', 'suburbs', 'MD', 'back', ""'80"", 'were', 'used', 'hearing', 'name', 'Rayful', 'Edmond', 'III', 'name', 'was', 'synonomous', 'hustling', 'drug', 'trade', 'Washington', 'DC', 'mean', 'was', 'Kingpin', 'When', 'finally', 'got', 'hands', 'DVD', 'was', 'anxious', 'see', 'Back', 'then', 'knew', 'about', 'Rayful', 'were', 'various', 'rumors', 'existed', 'wanted', 'know', 'truth.All', 'documentary', 'was', 'good', 'got', 'truth', 'guess', ""'ll"", 'never', 'know', 'give', 'kudos', 'director', 'using', 'actual', 'news', 'footage', 'various', 'local', 'national', 'media', 'outlets', 'interviewing', 'officers', 'agents', 'involved', 'case.I', 'just', 'wish', 'director', 'would', ""'ve"", 'put', 'forth', 'more', 'effort', 'utilizing', 'actor', 'who', 'actually', 'resembled', 'Rayful', 'actors', 'used', 'documentary', 'wore', 'gear', 'reminiscent', 'late', ""'80"", 'track', 'suit', 'would', ""n't"", 'have', 'been', 'too', 'hard', 'find', 'Madness', 'gear', 'instead', 'All_Daz', 'gear', 'clothing', 'line', 'was', ""n't"", 'established', 'back', 'then', 'owner', 'producer', 'film', 'now', 'know', 'why', 'was', 'used', 'can', 'say', 'promotion', '.Hopefully', 'volume', '2', 'will', 'be', 'better']",The Life of Rayful Edmond - Rise and Fall Vol. 1

Dealing pot at 14, his parents guiding him, what else was there for him to do but grow up and become a bigger dealer than his folks were. His weakness was his trusting of too many around him and allowing them to get too close and therefore vulnerable to attack from the feds.
