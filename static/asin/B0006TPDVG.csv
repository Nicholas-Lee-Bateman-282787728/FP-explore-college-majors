874070,ASLUAG34KUJPQ,B0006TPDVG,D.S. Chen,"[1, 1]","I hadn't seen any Brazilian films before I saw the dark but powerful ""City of God.""  ""God is Brazilian"" was very different emotionally, but no less creative and thought-provoking.God is eager to go on vacation, and needs to leave Creation in the hands of a caretaker saint while he goes roaming the galaxy.  While Brazil is one of the most religious (read: Roman Catholic) countries on Earth, it has never had one of its natives recognized as a saint.  God has come to South America's largest country disguised as a native to try to find someone who might be a likely candidate for sainthood:  an overachieving young man named ""Quinca das Mulas.""Of course, God needs some human help as he journeys through the Brazilian countryside... but his companions are certainly no angels themselves.The most prominent theme of this film is the constantly-evolving relationship between God and somewhat wayward humanity.  The character of Taoca (Wagner Moura) exemplifies different aspects of that relationship. His brash but likeable character chides and argues with God along their journey.  He's somewhat religious and yet - confronted with the Almighty - is hardly afraid to put in his ""dois centavos"" on various topics.  His attempts to use psychoanalysis on God were hilarious.  Antonio Fagundes made an excellent, cranky old God who was not without a sense of humor.  The lovely Paloma Duarte was great as the troubled Mada.The colorful backdrops of the Brazilian countryside certainly enhanced this film.  It was interesting to see parts of Brazil that foreign visitors to Rio or Sao Paulo rarely ever venture to.",4,"A colorful, lively and thoughtful film",1173052800,"03 5, 2007",2007,1610,"['had', ""n't"", 'seen', 'Brazilian', 'films', 'saw', 'dark', 'powerful', 'City', 'God', 'God', 'Brazilian', 'was', 'very', 'different', 'emotionally', 'less', 'creative', 'thought-provoking.God', 'eager', 'go', 'vacation', 'leave', 'Creation', 'hands', 'caretaker', 'saint', 'roaming', 'galaxy', 'Brazil', 'one', 'most', 'religious', 'read', 'Roman', 'Catholic', 'countries', 'Earth', 'never', 'had', 'one', 'natives', 'recognized', 'saint', 'God', 'come', 'South', 'America', 'largest', 'country', 'disguised', 'native', 'try', 'find', 'someone', 'who', 'might', 'be', 'likely', 'candidate', 'sainthood', 'overachieving', 'young', 'man', 'named', 'Quinca', 'das', 'Mulas', 'course', 'God', 'human', 'help', 'Brazilian', 'countryside', 'companions', 'are', 'certainly', 'no', 'angels', 'themselves.The', 'most', 'prominent', 'theme', 'film', 'constantly-evolving', 'relationship', 'God', 'somewhat', 'wayward', 'humanity', 'character', 'Taoca', 'Wagner', 'Moura', 'different', 'aspects', 'relationship', 'brash', 'likeable', 'character', 'chides', 'God', 'journey', 'somewhat', 'religious', 'yet', 'confronted', 'Almighty', 'hardly', 'afraid', 'put', 'dois', 'centavos', 'various', 'topics', 'attempts', 'use', 'psychoanalysis', 'God', 'were', 'hilarious', 'Antonio', 'Fagundes', 'made', 'excellent', 'cranky', 'old', 'God', 'who', 'was', 'not', 'sense', 'humor', 'lovely', 'Paloma', 'Duarte', 'was', 'great', 'troubled', 'Mada.The', 'colorful', 'backdrops', 'Brazilian', 'countryside', 'certainly', 'enhanced', 'film', 'was', 'interesting', 'see', 'parts', 'Brazil', 'foreign', 'visitors', 'Rio', 'Sao', 'Paulo', 'rarely', 'ever', 'venture']",N/A

He travels (mostly on foot) across a portion of Brazil searching for a man he hopes to make a saint who will take his place while he goes on holiday. While God, played by the incomparable Antonio Fagundes, takes this road trip, he is accompanied by Taoca played by Wagner Moura and Mada, played by Paloma Duarte. The theological conversations between God and Taoca alone are worth the price of admission. Genuine questions are asked and answered sometimes with exasperation and mostly with a degree of humor. And a sidebar benefit - we are treated to a travelogue of beautiful Brazil!This is a warm, upbeat, optimistic story and I can't think of a better person to play God. Mr. Fagundes is a superb actor.

First, I have seen ""BBB"" and I can put the two in context. (There is a great visual gag involving satellite dishes that connects to ""BBB"") Second, I have lived in Brazil. I know where Carlos Diegues is coming from.I think Brazilians really believe God is Brazilian. After all, Brazil is Paradise. God's frustration, expressed in this movie, is Brazil's frustration. As emphasized in the movie, Brazil does not suffer from hurricanes, tidal waves, earthquakes, etc. It suffers from people. Yet, this movie does not get bogged down in despair. It's Brazilian!
